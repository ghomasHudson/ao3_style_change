On September 14
The cousins met during those three days in England and were actually in good terms. As it turns out, without Petunia's hatred of her sister, Vernon never hated Harry and Dudley never emulated his parents in his treatement of his cousin. Since Petunia never had to spoil Dudldey and hurt Harry to make sure her own son never felt overshadowed or inferior to his cousin, Dudley never grew up as a bully. He had a temper like both his parents, was prone to fights when angry, but he never hurt others for the sake of it. He also never became the size of a baby beach whale; sure, he was chubby, but not morbidally obese!
Immediately, the French delegation burst into applause and cries of delight. Despite her muggleborn status, the girl had been the contender for the spot. Even if some looked down upon her for her blood status, none could deny her skills or her cunning mind. She was called
''Ah! I see! Harry, I know you don't want to get anyone in trouble with the Ministry over in Britain and that you think the safer route is the best. Sometimes, it is, but this is YOUR life. No one else's. This is your future! No matter where you go to study, so long as you do your very best, no one that matters will be disappointed. The second you choose to lead your life in a certain way just to please someone else or in fear of what others will think, then you have forfeited your life.'' said the man with a soft and wise voice. ''Besides, Durmstrang's dark arts program is very mild compared to it's reputation. They first teach you the difference between light and dark spells and then, they teach you the consequences of the spells and jinxs you learn. In fact, the first year, all you learn is how dangerous the dark arts are and a few spells. They teach you that even if the magic is dark that it isn't evil. And if, at the end of your fifth year, you don't want to continue, then you can drop the course completely.''
“For Beauxbâtons Academy of Magic, the champion is one Miss Lilianne Delacoursière! Congratulation, my dear! You are our first champion!”
Uagadou was in third place, but only accepted students from Africa or had to have African roots; which Harry did not have. Durmstrang and Koldovstoretz (the russian school) were neck-to-neck at forth place. The Russian school, unfortuanetaly, was not a good idea as the school was far and had an even worse relationship with Britain than America. The irony of it all was that muggle America and muggle England were allies in a cold war against Russia (or URSS), while magical America and magical Russia were allies in a cold war with Englad. Russia refused to have any students that had any ties with England and his Ministry within his borders. It only left Durmstrang!
“First, thoses are abraxans, not pegusies. Second, how on earth do you expect to pass your Care for Magical Creatures OWL if you can't even tell the difference?” snorted a second year Ravenclaw in disbelief (not that anyone could blame the kid).
“If you are my guardian angel, than I might not be too upset with dying.” purred Harry with the Potter trademark sexy smirk.
Chapter 6
Today was the day that he was to announce which school he wished to attend. He had many different options to choose from. Almost all of the Great Eleven Magical Schools in the world had accepted him; only Mahoutokoro and Koldovstoretz had refused his guardians requests. The honorable Japanese school had refused his acceptance due to the fact that despite the soul leech was gone, his magical core was grey from birth and Harry did not speak one word Japanese; therefore, inilligible for the mandatory interview with the school's headmaster. The Russian school reason for Harry's refusal was not something anyone could have planned for.
Before Blaise could sit with the rest of Slytherin House, Granger still had one more question to ask. How did he know so much about the other schools? Blaise simply replied that he had many cousins that attended the two schools and that he was the only one of the Zabini clan to have ever attend Hogwarts. Satisfied, Granger let him go and made her way to her table.
The couple refused to accept any form of payment, stipend or allowance from the bank, the trust fund for Harry or from any other sources. Rose insisted that she could provide her nephew with everything and if the rest of the Vaux De Villiers family felt it was unfair that they should pay for everything for the child and not receive anything in return, she would raise the money herself. She had more than enough to provide for her nephew and herself. No. It would be better to invest the money in Harry's future. The only thing that would be taken out of Harry's vaults would be either heirlooms, journals from previous family members and possibly the portraits of his parents. Nothing else!
"Yes, that's better. I want to look at all of you, though." Potter investigated Draco's face. Then his hands brushed against his chest and Harry bend his knees.
"What was that about?", Draco asked.
The waiter came to their table and cleared his throat. He blushed a bit. Poor man.
"I was having a row with Ron. Said some very nasty things. He said mean things too. And I got very angry, I was stressed. I was having nightmares every night,  I was sleep deprived. And then I see that fucking bug eavesdropping, inside my own home. Ron was supposed to make the wards safe, but he was an irresponsible tosser like always and forgot. And then I just... I fixed her in animagus state and stomped on her. It wasn't even a spur-of-the-moment thing. I really wanted to kill her. I was so angry. And she was annoying. I am a terrible human being. I killed someone because they were annoying me. The Dursleys,  well that's understandable after what you've been through. But I am just plain evil, Harry."
"Do you like swallowing cum, Potter?", Draco asked and chilled his voice down, so that it wouldn't betray him.
"Do you mean when we were bashing each other's heads in at Hogwarts or when I was a death eater? Because, I'm not sure I want to reminisce."
This is written from the perspective of an emotionally abusive man.
Ginny growled lowly. "I thought we wanted to have coffee and a proper date and such nonsense. I'm going to shag you in a stall in the loo if you keep going like this."
Enjoy.
"Because I used to be your arch enemy at school?"
"Well it's not going to happen, Nott. I will self-sabotage the shit out of this, like any rational adult would. Because I'm too selfish to actually break up with him just because he is too good for me."
"I've got to go now. To see someone", Hermione said and blushed.
"Are you telling me you like my glasses?"
"Look, you don't even have to see her. But I thought you got along well?", Hermione said.
"Uh, Belial Nott, Harry Potter. Potter, Nott"
"No... I mean yes, we talked about it, I just." Draco swallowed.
"I give up, Malfoy. "
"Traitor", she mumbled. "I was about to get popcorn."
"I think I'll have to find a permanent, magical solution for that problem sooner or later."
"I want to hurt you."
"Tell me no and I'll stop immediately."
Probably it was just Draco being practically a virgin. Falling for someone because the orgasms felt like love. Thinking that sticking your penis into someone's arse was intimacy because it was so bloody intimate.
"Who is it?", someone yelled from the bedroom. Oh no. Harry had a man over. How awkward.
"Your, uh, glasses, Potter."
"About what?", Draco asked, somewhat confused.
Belial had been to the cinema once and thought it was mental what those muggles did without magic.
"I'm going to ask her if she wants that."
When he woke up in the morning, Potter was gone and he felt well rested and eerily calm, as if he didn't just done something absolutely terrifying. He couldn't remember the last time he had felt calm instead of numb. Potter came into the room, a towel wrapped around him.
A very sleepy Harry entered the room.
"Listen, there's two sides to every story, right?"
Belial wanted to make quipped remark, but for some strange reason, his tongue was stuck in his mouth. He coughed and took a gulp of blue wine.
"I kind of... stepped on her."
"Oh, they are. And muggles have a lot of stories about witches. Wildly inaccurate, of course. Do you want to see it?"
Ginny, Ginny, Ginny, Ginny... It was really interesting how the witch had gone from being an occasional shower-thought to being so very important. When had it really begun, that attraction, Hermione wondered. Back when they slept in the same room in the burrow and she heard those soft noises one night? She had opened her eyes just a little bit, but it was enough to see Ginny's pale skin and how she was writhing in the moonlight, probably thinking of Harry. And Hermione had felt like an intruder. But really, it had been hard to look away. Back then, Ginny was still flipping the bird at school-bullies and buzzing with energy, throwing bat-bogey-hexes left and right. Now she was a Quidditch-star and a bit more calm when off the broom. When she walked into the cafe, fashionably late and hair artfully tousled despite the crisp side-cut, Hermione's breath hitched. She was wearing a rough leather jacket and boots and she looked like she had just jumped out of one of her fan's magazines. There were always screaming teenage girls swooning when there was a match, and sometimes they even snuck onto the training pit. She grinned at Hermione and before she could fret over the appropriate way of greeting the other witch, she kissed her softly on the lips. Hermione's knees felt decidedly wobbly now.  "Hi", she said breathlessly. Ginny sat down.
"Where is she?"
"Shit. Is this a one-night-stand?"
Hermione nodded. "Yes. You really shouldn't have. But I forgive you."
"Belial. I shouldn't have done that. I'm so sorry. I thought this would be fun. And maybe I wanted to see what it was like. With you and Potter. But I should've talked to you."
Draco went into the cellar and looked at the object. It was wrapped into a black piece of cloth. It moved. That startled Draco a bit, but it wasn't anything that much out of the ordinary. But then, it sneezed. And even though that wasn't that uncommon for old, charmed objects, something about that sneeze sounded decidedly less like an object and more like a subject. Draco put on his dragon-hide gloves and took off the black cloth. Under it, there was a big, round globe and in that globe a tiny creature that Draco had read about, but never seen. To his knowledge, fae draconis had gone extinct seventy years ago. But this one looked alive. And very, very angry.
"Water under the bridge. Let's get drunk on elven wine and forget about it. Maybe I can do something about that tension", Draco said and smirked. Belial was not sure, what that sentence implied, but it did definitely not alleviate any kind of tension. There was no simple way to ignore the fact that Draco was fit. And not in the usual understated way that made it easy to deal with. Fit in the I-want-to-jump-you-right-now kind of way. Bad idea. Very bad idea. Was this Draco trying to get back at Potter? And if so, did he even care? And more importantly, did he see double entendres when there were non? Draco quirked an eyebrow. Belial realized that he had just been sitting there, silently squirming and contemplating Draco's charms for about a minute. He blushed. He looked around the apartment, just to not look at Draco too closely. There was a telly on a little nightstand.
"Don't  be ridiculous, Potter."
"Oh nothing. You don't want to hear this."
He missed her sometimes. But the problem with being a murderer was that you couldn't tell anyone.
Hermione started crying again. Harry patted her back.
"Anytime, Potter", he said.
"What type of movies do you like? I have quite the collection", Draco said and got down on his knees to pull out a drawer with plastic books, all of the same size. His trousers stretched over his small but firm arse. Belial forgot to breathe. He choked and took another sip of wine. Then he sat down beside Draco to look at the books. Their arms touched. He could smell his perfume. My neighbour Totoro. Four weddings and and a funeral. Witches of Eastwick.
"No, I mean: that's not too forward."
Hermione should've returned by now. It wasn't right. It was true that he had been a bit harsh with her, but she just had this infuriating energy around her, this silent superiority. It would've made anyone mad. And it wasn't as if he had ever laid a hand on her. No matter how much nagging there was, he had always hit the wall or a table, never her face. And he had never cheated on her. That had to count for something, right? Oh well. Maybe it was time to get her the flowers she so clearly needed and apologise. Ron put on his coat and got some colourful tulips from the station. Then he apparated to Harry's front door. He was still not over the fact that Potter apparently allowed Hermione into his wards but not him. And they had been best mates for such a long time!  If Harry wasn't an arse-bender, he would've been jealous. He rung the doorbell and it yelled into the house that Ron was at the door in a rude, thick Liverpool accent. No one opened. Then, there were muffled voices and steps. Harry opened the door in a bathrobe.
"Oh. Yeah, sorry about that. But you did it first."
"No, we just met today when Potter was vandalizing the shop", Draco replied hastily. "This isn't a date."
"Damn, Potter. That's grim."
"You know Harry Fucking Potter? I,  of course you do, he was in your year at Hogwarts, right? I think Theo told me something about the two of you on, don't remember what, though", Belial answered.
"Oh Harry. Do you think we're redeemable?"
"Enjoyable activities like arse bending, what the fuck do you think we do? We sleep together."
"I am knackered,  Belial. I think I'll go to bed now. And don't worry, we're okay, we're mates. I just. I Need to go to bed now."
"Yeah, yeah. Straight as an arrow, that one", Belial said and chuckled.
"Are you coming over here, or..?" Potter moaned, two fingers still scissoring inside him. Draco came over and took Potter's wet hand away from his bum. Then he placed his cock on his stretched hole and slid in easily. It felt great and fucking Potter into a sofa was exhilarating, but it was somehow less intimate then the eye contact and the kissing. Potter moaned and came all over Draco after he had repeatedly hit his prostate. When Potter clenched his buttocks around him, Draco came, too. Through the satisfaction,  the climax had somehow felt anticlimactic to Draco. Potter scourgified them both. Then he cuddled up and rested his head on Draco's lap. "Should I leave soon?", Draco asked awkwardly.
"Oh Merlin! Does anyone know about that?"
"Why?", Draco asked.
He looked at her, baffled.
"Fine, but you'll have to apparate me there."
"Good morning,  gentlemen. Can I offer you some tea?", he asked.
"That I can't stop watching your mouth and stop doing that indecent thing with your tongue, Potter."
Sorry. So, Harry Potter was fucking sorry. And didn't just sod off like everyone else did, but stayed here and graced him with his pity.
Draco pinched the bridge if his nose.
Draco knew it was a mistake to keep sleeping with Potter. The constant rejection festered like mold in an unwashed cauldron. But every time he tried to stay away, hours felt like days and days like weeks. He wanted to not seem desperate, not call for month, ditch a date from time to time, but he couldn't bring himself to pretend. He went out alone and tried to have a good time, he smiled and drank until his eyes hurt. And after a few sleepless nights and then returning to Potter whenever he called like he had accio'd him there, Draco came up with a plan. A petty, juvenile plan.
"Want to down our coffee, apparate back to your place and see if we still fit into our Hogwarts-uniform?", Hermione asked and wiggled her eyebrows suggesitvely. "Yes please!", Ginny croaked. "I was joking but I guess we could actually do it", Hermione said. The waiter came back with their beverages. He seemed a bit more calm now. Hermione gave him an apologetic grin. He turned beet red again and left for the kitchen. "Maybe we should tone it down, that poor man looked like he had trouble breathing", Hermione mentioned. Ginny shrugged and gulped her coffee down with an impressive speed. "He's fit, he can join us", she said. Hermione did not like that thought much. Yeah, it was kind of hot but she wasn't really ready to share Ginny with anyone. Oh no. They should probably talk. Have The Talk. Relationship talk. Or they could not. And then probably end up like Harry and Malfoy. That would be awful. She staightened up. Time to Gryffindor this situation into clarity. She sighed. Ginny looked at her in  worried way. "Hey, luv. Is there something wrong?" Hermione pinched the bridge of her nose.
Potter shrugged.
"Uh. That's flattering, Malfoy", Potter replied and raised his eyebrows. Oh no. What was happening? Was he trying to fucking flirt? With...with him?
Ron scourgified the messy table, but it wasn't of much use. His place was rotten. Since Hermione had left, everything had gone to shite. Yesterday, he had seen a sodding doxy in the curtains. Couldn't manage to catch the bugger either. He had punched several holes into the wall and didn't even bother to fix them. Actually he never had. It had been Hermione who healed his hand and reparo'd the walls, under constant nagging. She also fed Pig. Now the bird was just a constant bother, chirping at him from the dropping-encrusted cage. "You can't even wipe your own arse without a mother or wife taking care if you!", she had shouted before she packed her bags. But it was really her fault. If he wasn't so traumatised by the whole Skeeter affair, if he could've had a social life, he wouldn't be in such a state. But Hermione had to selfishly ruin his whole life and now she had left him alone, after all he had done for her. Suffered her arrogance, her sloppy, unappealing clothes, her migraines when it was time to shag. "Would you take care of me, Ron?", she'd say in this horribly meek voice. She should've been grateful. There were wizards who didn't last more than a few minutes. He could go for more than half an hour. Just because she wasn't woman enough to come from normal sex, that didn't mean that he would play childish games with her like school-girls at Hogwarts did because they didn't have a cock to satisfy them. He would sometimes rub her a bit, as a special treat. That should've been sufficient. But she started to be as frigid as she looked with those clothes that looked like she had stolen them from professor McGonagall. Honestly, would it kill her to make an effort once in a while? She could be good looking with her curves and long legs. A bit of make-up, a hair-straightening charm and she would be a real beauty. But the oh-so-intellectual Hermione was apparently above such frivolity. And now she was at Harry's place. Maybe he could give her a makeover. Weren't gays good at that sort of thing? She was probably telling tales of how everything was Ron's fault. Harry had become such a twat after the war. Couldn't take a joke, all serious. As if he was the only one who lost people to Voldemort. There was still a gaping hole in Ron's heart were Fred used to be.
"I kind of dumped him just a few hours ago. I'm surprised he's not here, trying to annoy me further, actually."
"By doing what?"
He tried to make puppy eyes.
Draco nodded. Though he was pretty sure that a lot of people at the ministry would gladly pin something on a former death eater with no friends or influence. And he was easy prey, had always been, even though he had thought of himself as the big bad wolf when he was younger.
"Listen, Harry. You probably have to arrest me if I tell you."
Potter grinned and took Draco's hand. It felt very unreal. The whole day had been a constant stream of absurdity and so it made sense to go home with Potter. It was the next logical step, even. And Potter was attractive, there was no doubt about that. Draco had never really considered it much, but he had been obsessed with his (disgusting) hair and his (stupid, smug) smile throughout his teenage years. Now that the hate for his flaws was mere annoyance, the rest of the emotions in the mix that had looked only like anger and contempt resurfaced and it looked as if he had had been nursing a gargantuan crush since basically first year at Hogwarts. Harry Potter's flat was fancy and impersonal, like something out of an owl-mail-catalogue. But focussing on Potter's furniture was hard when the hand holding his was still there and, oh Merlin, what was Potter's other hand doing on his hip, how did it get there?
"He literally wore a rainbow bracelet", Potter remarked.
"Exactly what you would imagine it to be like. She was raving mad."
"No."
Draco didn't know what to say or think.
Draco hadn't slept in the same bed with an other person, ever. Even as a baby he had slept in a crib. At Hogwarts, his bed had had silencing charms on it, so that he wouldn't wake the other boys with his screams at night. And now, he was lying in Potter's bed, next to someone who he hadn't really known two days ago. Draco stared at the ceiling. Potter's arm was still wrapped around Draco's waist and it was heavy, now that he was sleeping. But Draco didn't dare to move and wasn't even sure if he wanted to. It smelled strange, foreign, not like the lavender soap that he used for his sheets, a bit like pines. The lingering smell of firewhiskey was still there, too. Draco didn't like it, it reminded him of his father when he was most broken.
"Hi Belial. Do you fancy coming over to my place for a drink tonight?", Draco asked him through the floo.
"First of all, no, what a load of cheap, he just likes fucking me. Second of all, even if he were, which he isn't, I told him I don't do relationships."
"You'll never find anyone like me again, you insufferable shrew!", Ron yelled.
"Only if you want. You can sleep here, if you like."
"Oh, that's a shame."
"What the fuck are you doing with Draco, then?"
Draco wanted to scream. He looked at Harry,  ready to tell him sod off,  but instead he froze when their eyes met. It somehow felt way to private, it hurt.
Petunia and Vernon had screamed at each other in agony. Like Harry had screamed the first few times that Vernon had forced himself on him. And Petunia had to watch this time, couldn't pretend to not hear, couldn't look away and do nothing.

"Oh, that sounds nice. You've never called me by my first name before."
Draco kissed him back. I want to own you, he thought.
Hey Mione, Ron is here. With flowers and half-arsed apologies. You want to see him or can I kick him in the face?
"I said out. You don't want to make me angry, do you?", Hermione said calmly, but her eyes were scary. It reminded him of something. When had he seen her like this? It had been right before she stomped on that beetle. He nervously swallowed.
"Yes,  I am Nott, Potter."
It hadn't been hard to make the investigation disappear. Not for an auror,  not for The Boy Who Lived.
Draco blinked.
Draco pulled Potter's hair.
"So what?", Hermione mumbled. "Dating is hard."
"Why wouldn't I?", Potter replied with a crooked smile.
Draco had thought that it was better to get it over with. She had petrified him after pulling his trousers off his nervous erection. Now every time sleep took over, Draco was petrified again. And the horrors of his past mixed into new nightmares. All the violence he had seen, all the pain. And that was probably what happened to all dark wizards. It was the price you paid for being what you are. The darkness inside him, it had been there before Bella, even before his mother had trained him with stinging hexes not to slouch when he was five and punished the house elves for Draco's mistakes in etiquette. Wrong spoon? Go and iron your hand, elf.
"No, you don't", Draco said and snogged him again. He half-heartedly wiggled a bit under him, but it was less trying to get free and more trying to rub his cock on Draco's. Then it was biting and frotting and laughing and wrestling with Draco always on top, and more frotting. Potter took their cocks into his hand and rubbed them and Draco came on his fingers. He tried giving head for the first time and was quite proud that it worked. When they were done, Potter got up and made coffee for them. It was all a bit too good to be true.
"Tell me about it", Draco said and nodded.
"What? Why do you not know that? I thought she was staying with you!"
"I want to tell you what to do."
"I'm sorry, Ron. I just don't want to be with you anymore."
"You obviously don't know me very well."
"Have you seen my glasses, Malfoy? I just ran into a door."
And if someone called him at three in the morning, he knew what to expect. "I don't need anyone. And no one needs me. And I like it like that", Harry told his owl. It hooted affectionately. He gave her an owl treat.
"For what?"
It felt good to see Potter like this. It felt good to have an illusion of control. Draco pulled his hair and he moaned softly, leaning into Draco's hand like a kitten.
"Is it hurt?", Draco asked softly.
That year, Harry learned many of life's lesson.
Unless your name was Molly Weasley, née Prewett. Molly was outraged that her son Charlie would marry a complete foreigner instead of a good and pureblooded english rose. She tsks at the Montracue's traditions, she argued with the choices of the bride, she butted into the preparations and undermined everything about the new home of the couple. Molly buldozed her way in and changed everything that Valeria had decided to make the home they would live in more like the Burrow (thus more English-like) and the wedding the way SHE wanted it. It didn't help that Ron and Hermione were helping her along. After Charlie had been called forth, along with his father, to his father-in-law to be told that if he didn't reign in his mother that there would be no wedding, the dragon-tamer put his foot down and told his mother to back the hell off.
It was amusing to watch his friends have so much fun and Marco couldn't help but feel a bit jealous. He didn't have anyone to dance with... Oh wait! There was that Gypsy boy from Durmstrang coming his way. Before the other boy could say anything, Igor immediately asked him for a dance. Not because he was interested in the other, both were straight and had no interest in men, but because he wanted to dance and the Spanish young man was a good dancer. So, why the fuck not?
Rose Vaux-De-Villiers, née Evans, was a woman who had seen many disturbing, dangerous, vile and horrifying things done by humans being to their fellows because of greed, lust and pride. She had worked for many years in a domain that forced her to witness such acts of cruelty and, to her everlasting shame, had done a few of them.
When Draco returned to Beauxbaton, he immediately was assaulted by upper years who didn't take kindly to the fact his father's cousins had made a very good deal of the back's of their parents. Thankfully, Madame Maxime had a ZERO tolerance policy on bullying and had the two upper years publically apologize, then publically ripped into them and then... Suspended them for three weeks, put them on probation once they came back with a charm that kept them away from Draco and revoked any privilige or placement in school related activities. During this year, Marco Gomez, the half-veela best friend of Draco, showed him more of his culture and his people's beliefs; while Lilianne and Draco both thaught one another how to naviguate through each other's world. Draco had changed since the year before; where once he was arrogant and snobby, now he was calm and appreciated what he had (Lilianne had told me how she lived with her three older brothers, her four cousins and aunts, uncles and grand-parents in an appartement in the poorer district of Paris). If at Hogwarts, Draco would have been the most popular Slytherin, at Beauxbaton, he was a loner with close and loyal friends.
''What happened?'' asked Rose with a monotone voice.
Dumbledoor tried to reason and manipulate Ragnok into seeing that little Harry's health, life and wellfare were best when in his hands. Ragnok was not impressed. In fact, he was down right furious. To suggest that a goblin could not care and treat a magical child properly, regardless of it's species, was down right insulting and shed doubt on the abilities of goblins to raise their own little ones. To truly make sure that Albus Dumbledoor had little to no influence in his young ward's life, Ragnok issued a recall of all the books, heirlooms and objects that belonged to the Potter family, as well as the exact location of Harry Potter before the end of the week. Should Dumbledoor refuse to comply, the charges of thief, of kidnapping and of child endangerment would be filed with the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and the seizure and immediate closure of the Dumbledoor's family vault.
Once the meal was over, the Hogwart Headmaster asked some kind of surly, bitter and old man to bring in the “impartial judge”. Once the “judge” was near the head table, after a small dramatic and unnecessary pause, the old man pulled a ratty sheet off the “judge” to show off a intricately ornated silver and glass trophy that spouted blue flames, coating the Great Hall in a ominous blue tint.
“I asked the same questions, so I could get the full picture. Apparently, our Bonding Contract would be heavily in my favor and that if you died, then the Headmaster would become Regent of your Houses, since a woman isn’t allowed to do so. Which is completely untrue, I checked. To make sure that happens, the Headmaster intends on me being pregnant before the end of the year. That way you would be in the wrong and would have to agree to a HUGE bride price for
(The English Dragon), had made it's way through the high society of Paris and all the way to Beauxbaton Academy. No one ever dared to make a fool out of a Malfoy after that. It was once back home that he had locked himself in his room to cry all the tears his poor eyes could shed.
The woman did not take this lightly and strucked her son for his disrespect. Instead of folding in and be shocked by such a gesture from his own mother as Narcissa had hoped, Draco kept his head held high and sneered down his nose to the woman who gave birth to him. All respect, all admiration and all love he had for her was gone from his eyes; only disdain, anger and disgust remained. Narcissa Ophelia Malfoy, née Black, no longer was the mother of Draconis Lucius Malfoy. She felt it in her bones, in her magic and, most importantly, in her heart. She had crossed a line and there was no going back. By refusing to listen to her son's plea, by insulting him, by trying to emotionally manipulate him and by striking him, she had broken all ties to her son.
The young man with raven locks looked around the garden in which the party was held; enjoying watching Alcazar dancing with some french girl named Lilianne. The young man had many qualities and skills, but dancing was not one of them unfortunately. Yet, it didn't stop him from enjoying a dance or two with beautiful girls. This french girl seemed to be the kind of girl that enjoyed life and didn't care what others thought of it. She seemed like the type of girls for Alcazar. The young man prefered to laught at himself than to try and be cool; it's what made Harry like the other boy so much as children. Alcazar didn't care if he looked silly or what others thought of him.
Many people in the crowd sighed in exhaustion at the bickering pair. For seven long years, they had to put up with this and honestly, the only reason neither of them ever got hexed or cursed was the protection that Dumbledore extended to the two of them. They could do no wrong in his eyes and everyone with a brain, and even those with only half of one, knew that they only reached their status because of the man, not on their own. Their behaviours, the fighting and their attitudes would never had gotten them any favours, as much from the teachers as the students.
Then came the discussion of Harry's discipline, both Rose and Alexander did not believe in physical punishment. They did not believe that hitting, insulting or beating a child would teach him anything other than how to improperly deal with his anger. They did believe in making a child do some chores like weeding the garden when he did something wrong or something of the likes when a child misbehaved. They believed in a strict set of rules, clearly defined and understandable. They believed that a child could make his own mistakes, but that didn't mean that he could not be punishned.
So far, any subjects touched upon the couple and the goblin agreed. It helped that the couple were responsible and cared for Harry. They did not approve of laziness and mediocrity; they viewed that doing the bare minimum was an insult to one's parents who worked all year round to give you the best that they could afford. If one had no desire or interest in a subject or area, than it was one's duty to find such an area or subject to make sure that one's parents did not worked their bottom's off for nothing. The only subject that they did disagree on was Harry's education.
“Honestly, Ron! We are here to welcome the Beauxbâtons and Durmstrang delegations! Didn't you here what Professor McGonagall said? Now, stop whinning and stand up straight, we are Head Boy and Head Girl. We need to give a good example for the younger years!” snapped Hermione Granger, never realising that no one was looking at the two of them as models.
Deputy-headmistress Minerva McGonagall was so very thrilled when she saw the letter of acceptance of Harry Potter. Oh, how she was impatient to have him as a student! She couln't wait to see what kind of person he was. Would he be like his mother; smart, reliable and level-headed, good at charms and arithmancy? Or more like his father; fun-loving, prankster, cheeky and good at transfiguration?
“Good. I will place your tattoo myself, then you can leave and rest. I believe tomorrow will be an exhausting trial of patience and diplomancy for you.” said the man before smilling down at his favorite student (not that he would ever say such a thing out loud).
“What? Like Blackbeard?” asked a first year muggleborn from Gryffindor.
Lost in his thoughts, Harry never noticed the blond that had walked up to him until said blond started poking his chest. Looking up from his glass, Harry was met with two breath-taking molten silver eyes. Blond locks, surrounding an angelic oval face with high cheekbones and a lovely small nose, that caught the light of the sun and shone like liquid silk. Almost as tall as him, lithe body with lean muscles and a smile that mocked, charmed and challenged him, Harry was almost speachless.
snake that he was, he had bypass the Headmaster (fully knowing the man would have obliviated the girl and make the whole thing seem like a small spat instead for what it was) and spoken directly with Minerva, Madam Bones and had contacted the girl's parents. Before he even knew what was going on, the Board of Governers had been made aware and had forced him to expel the three kind, if misguided, boys since they were going to Azkaban.
“Elite Potter, I know you are an adult. I know you don't appreciate being treated as a child, but this is for your protection. Herr Dumbledore has asked multiple times to have you come to his office as soon as the feast ended tonight. When I refused, Herr Dumbledore tried to arrange a meeting, again with you alone, for tomorrow morning. No matter what I said, the man would not let go and has tried to use many underhanded reasons. If he comes to you and tried to make you come to his office alone and you feel threathened in any way, shape or form... I give you permission to use force and magic to defend yourself. I have written permission from the French government, of which your are a citizen, that allows you to use any types of magic to defend yourself, barring the Unforgivables. The permission is a temporary tattoo that will rest on the back of your right hand. I expect you to never abuse your privilege and to use it wisely. Do I make myself clear?” asked once more the Headmaster, knowing full well he didn't have to worry about such things from his Elite.
Ragnok was quite impressed by this muggle. She clearly cared a great deal about her nephew and was willing to marry a male to ensure the survival of a young not her own. This Rose human was about to bound herself to a male only to help her nephew and her friend. Her friend would receive his inheritance, thus continuing the financial expansion of the Vaux De Villiers House's fortune and making sure that the Potter Heir and fortune were well looked after and taken care of; even if it meant she could never leave her mate and find the one she loved.
“Ron and Hermione are suppose to convince you that I’m the girl for you and to do that by
The blond angel looked startled and let out a small snort at the corny pick-up line. Not one of Harry's best to be honest, but it did help if the light blush on the other's cheeks was any indication. Recovering quickly, the blond introduced himself as one Draco Malfoy, their host's son. Ever the gentleman, Harry took the angel's right hand and placed a chaste and delicate kiss upon his knuckles and with the warmest and most charming voice the dark headed man could muster, introduced himself with a roguish smile. Once more the blond angel was caught off-guard and blushed beautifully, before recomposing himself.
Draco had wished for a drama-free school year, but his wishes were ignored during the Yule break. During the traditional Malfoy Yule Ball, Narcissa had decided that it was time for Draco to appear on the market and had invited all the pureblooded witches of proper lineage (no muggle blood or poor people) and all the pureblooded wizards of marying age. It wouldn't have been too bad; his father was very strict and demanding of his suitor, so practically no one was good enough for Draco. Less time dancing and chatting with utterly borish and pretentious brittish fools. The only families who could really have a chance of being chosen were the Greengrasses, the Parkinsons and the main branch of the Zabini family. The Greengrass sisters did not care for Draco and he for them; if only Pansy and Ricardo felt the same.
Many had trusted Gorgowitz without questions simply due to the fact that he had been at the school for longer than anyone and as a veteran, they instantely believed his words.
To the goblin's surprise, the man was right. Hogwarts was no longer a good option for Harry. The education given to the students was severely lacking and useless. As a magical guardian and as a professional goblin banker, he could not send his ward to such a substandard school without shaming his ancestor and his nation. Such a poor decision would be a bad investment on his part; and Ragnok did not become the financial advisor and guardian of one of the Most Ancient and Noble families by making such bad decisions. But where to send Harry, if not Hogwarts.
”. Even Harry, someone who didn't take pleasure out of other people suffering, had laught and enjoyed the torment of the old man. Some would say that it was petty and juvenile, but after spending seventeen whole years away from his homeland in exile, out of fear of being kidnapped or harmed or bewitched by the man and his sycophants, Harry had no remorse. It didn't help that uncle Alexander had confess to the slandering of his family by Dumbledore shortly after the boy had entered Durmstrang.
“Thank you for coming to me and telling me this. I know it cannot be easy for you to be drag into this whole thing and to go against your mom like this. Thank you so much! I’m glad I have a friend like looking out for me. Is it alright with you if I share the memory of our conversation with other people? My Headmaster and my family will want to know to prepare themselves, just in case.” Gently asked Harry, pulling out of the hug.
“I’m glad you were chosen. No offense to Draco or his skills, but had he been a competitor, I would be too distracted by him to give a proper performance.” Said Harry with a smirk while leaning against the wall. “I’d constantly be trying to flirt with him and in turn give the win to Hogwarts. I just couldn’t keep my hands off of him… or my lips.”
Such a response would have been unacceptable at their school. If the Headmaster gave directions, you kept your mouth shut and obeyed. Especially when it came to security, it wasn't there because the authority figures had nothing better to do on a saturday night. Honestly, such lack of discipline from the English was not giving a good image of their school.
Heir Hadrian James Potter, son of James Charlus Potter and Lily Amarylis Potter, née Evans, nephew of Lady (or Madame as they say in France) Rose Iris Vaux De Villiers, née Evans, and of Lord Alexander Simon Vaux De Villiers, and ward of Ragnok, Third son of Bloodspear and account manager of the Most Noble and Ancient House of Potter, had a very big decision to make.
And so, on the Christmas break, pretending to be so very ill as to not go to the, Merlin-awfull, Parkinson's Ball; he then, once his parents were gone, he used the Floo to get to his family's townhouse in Paris. He met up with his friends and left for downtown Paris where Lilianne presented one of her many cousins who was a bouncer for a rather sketchy club. Unbeknown to any of the fifteen year olds, they had just walked in a bar where a fist fight ring was put in place for the night's fight. Once the fights started, Draco used his allowance (50 galleons a month; or, 375$ in Muggle currency) to make bets. Somehow, someway, Draco managed to turned his small pittance (his words concerning his allowance) into a small fortune of 2087. 35$. Where did those 0.35 pence come from? He had no idea, but he had won them. After two hours of betting, drinking and the occasional dancing with very dangerous and muscular men, Draco and his friends were the life of the party. Until the police decided to raid the place, forcing the teenagers to flee by the back door.
Poor Lilianne had a lousy dance partner, but that didn't seem to bother either of them. She seemed to like how the young man enjoyed himself and wasn't so self-concious about others opinion of him. Having a good time with good company was more important to him and this sort of confidence was what Lilianne loved. They danced their hearts out and flipped off all those who had nothing better to do than mock them or were so insecure with themselves to let loose and have fun.
as the french call him. He is said to be the best duellist in all of Beauxbâtons and a language genius who can speak over 21 human languages and 6 magical ones. He already has departments in the French Ministry of Magic fighting to get him to work for them, on top of the Language Guild and the Potion Academy of the ICW offering fully payed apprenticeships. He refused them and offered them to other students who are just as skilled but not as well-off financially or as connected as his family is. He is respected and popular within the french society.” explained Blaise Zabini, surprising Hermione, Ron and Ginny, as he appear from behind them.
Love potions, compulsion spells and even sabotaging, bullying and threatening anyone that you may like. The Headmaster gave them the task to become your friend and turn you against your family. You have to be careful! Ron is average and isn’t much of a threat, especially if you get him angry. He’s easy to rile up and his arrogance will give you half of the win in a duel. Hermione is the real problem. That girl is the best student of her year and is very powerful. She knows a lot and has huge ego. She isn’t above using complicated and dangerous magic if it helps her get her way.” Explained the redhead as tears began to well up in her eyes and her limbs started to shake from the terror of the situation.
“Oh, it definitely was a compliment! My cousin Isabelle assisted to the match and had near front-row seats. She said it was like seeing... Oh, what was it again? Ah, yes...
Filius Flitwick always had a soft spot for Lily and would have loved to have such a studious student who clearly loved duelling. He could have trained him as an apprentice, but he understood that Albus would never allow anyone else being a mentor to Harry Potter. Besides, Harry wanted to learned and wanted to make sure he had a good education, something that Filius totally understood and agreed with. So he would help the boy in his quest for knowledge.
Petunia nearly jumped out of her skin as she heard her husband coming out of the bathroom; in a panick, the woman looked around frantically to spot a hiding place for the child before her husband saw him. Her eyes fell on the cupboard under the stairs and her mind was made up. She barely had time to close the door before Vernon made it down the stairs. Hushering him to the kitchen, she prayed that the baby would stay silent until her man left for work. It didn't take long before Vernon left in his shiny new car.
Harry's first year was the beginning of his true fame; not the one that was spunned by a meddling Headmaster. Upon his first week, he was jumped at least four separate times by upper years whose families had to leave England after the Dark Lord's fall. He didn't win any of the fights, but he gave as good as he could and managed to break more than one nose in the process. He excelled in most of his classes; especially duelling, runes and defense. The only classes he didn't seem to agree with him were the dark arts class and history. Before the end of the first semester, Harry Potter was known as the most powerful first year in the school. By the end of the school year, the ravenhead boy was considered a genius in duelling and a prodigy in runes. He passed the second year exam with ease; he was now entereing third year in runes. He was friends with a boy by the name of Alcazar Montracue from Romania; a good boy from a middle class upbringing with (unfortunately for him) five sisters.
Since the incident, Lord and Lady Malfoy have become almost paranoid at the idea that their son could one day fall into such a trap by a more skilled manipulator, so they made sure to be as vicious and as protective as possible whenever someone approached them about Draco's future. Draco was always warned in advance to beware of certain people; thus saving him from many gold-diggers and their families.
Third, Sirius Black... The man had been freed by the Weasley twins for over seven months now and had refuse any summons, letters or requests to meet with him. He knew that Sirius was with Harry Potter and could convince him to come to Hogwarts, but Albus couldn't reach him and place compulsion spells or manipulate him. He had though that with Lord Voldemort's return (even if no activity was observed. The dark wizard had been quite peaceful and silent in the last years since he stole the Philosopher's stone.) and the reformation of the Order of the Pheonix that Sirius would come running back to avenge his bestfriend and his wife's deaths, but no. Sirius had just written him a letter explaining that he was taking his time at knowing Harry and making sure the boy had a good life and was safe. So long as Harry was alive and safe, the man considered that he was sticking it up to Lord Voldefarts.
Seeing this, Harry immediately took her in his arms and tried to console her. This was both surprising and expected at the same time. Harry knew fully well that Dumbledore had prepared something to try to control him like a puppet. That he would use sex and love as manipulation tools was a given. They were powerful tools if you knew how to use them. Many before had tried that very same tactic with him and countless others at Durmstrang in order to gain his inheritances and titles. Harry suspected that many had the exact same plan as Dumbledore and said so to Ginny to calm her down.
The scene before the young ravenhead could be described simply as the most disgusting thing Harry James Potter had ever witnessed in his entire life. Alcazar had his pants ripped from him, exposing his buttom for the world to see, unconcious with a belt thightly wrapped around his neck while the abuser had just started to lower his zipper. Two and a quarter years of martial duelling training kicked in and Harry started trading fire with the old teacher. Fat and old, but surprisingly, fast and powerful, the man was a very dangerous opponent. Hiding behind a piece of furniture, Harry decided to go all for it; he had nothing else to lose and his friend needed help right now! He sent a spell above his teacher's head to distract him and once the old man looked up, using all that he could muster up in terms of magic, he send the most powerful
It had been his first heartbreak and it hurt him like a bitch. He had his friends by his sides and during the summer, his parents were there for him. That summer, his father expressed how proud he was that his son hadn't fallen into such a trap and had bounded with his son over heartbreak and girls.
Questions: 2 - Should Voldemort appear sooner? If so, how, in what capacity and what should he do? Is he a lord? Is he part of the Ministry? Or is he a simple spectator? Does he influence the Tournament.
It was also that year that Draco felt for the first time attraction to someone. He began to have a crush on Béatrice Montpellier, a pureblood with long blond hair and pale blue eyes. They played around each other for awhile before they, shyly, became a couple. It was Draco's first love and he was the perfect gentleman. He was attentive, kind, sweet and always willing to help her whenever she needed help... If only she had been the same. You see, Béatrice would betrothed to an old and foul smelling man once she graduated and she absolutely hated the very idea of such an union; so she decided to look for a younger and more malleable target. And hold and behold, the perfect chump fell unto her lap in the form of the Malfoy heir. She stringed him along and used emotional manipulations to have Draco write to his father to have a betrothal contract made with her parents. Now, Draconis Lucius Malfoy may be thirteen, may be in love for the first time and may not be as experienced as older boys, but he was no fool. The second Béatrice asked that he write to his father for a betrothal contract if he really loved her was the moment alarms began to ring in his head. He was raised by a Slytherin family to become a Slytherin; he knew what manipulation was when he saw it. And so, he wrote to his father to explain his situation. Two days later, Béatrice broke up with Draco before the entire schooll when she learned that her parents had decided to remove her from schooll and have her privately tutored since she was clearly incapable of being faithful to her betrothed and respectful of her family's honor by trying so pathetically to trap a great and noble family like the Malfoy. Plus, they were English. What was the girl even thinking?
The boys kept in contact through letters and photos throughtout the years, much to Marjorie's dispair. Despite the fat woman's nasty comments and sneers, Rose always received Dudley and Marjorie two weeks every summers and one week during Christmast to see her only other nephew. Just like Harry, Rose wrote letters, called on the phone and sent gifts and photos to Dudley throughout the year. They were not as close as they could have been, but Dudley never felt abandonned by his mother's family; after all, if Vernon and Petunia hadn't already stated that their son's guardianship was to go to Vernon's sister in case of their demise, Rose would have taken Dudley in no matter what. So Rose and Harry kept in touch with Dudley and grew a small relationship together.
''Greetings. I am Ragnok. I am the late Lord Charlus Fleamont Potter's financial adviser and current magical guardian of Heir Hadrian James Potter. I am here to speak to the person who took my ward.'' said the goblin without missing a beat, oblivious or not caring about the shocked face of the human residing in the mansion.
“Every year group has a Representative that is the spokeperson for them at the montly meetings with the other Representatives and the staff of the school. A Secretary that takes notes of every complaints, grievances, solutions or ideas from the year group. A Treasurer that takes care of raising money for activities or school outings that the year group might want, they also make sure to keep the books and keep tracks of any donations given, be it money or something else. And than there is the LawWizard that makes sure that every students follow the rules, makes sure that any dispute between students doesn't escalate and is the one who enforce punishment when the year group decides someone did something really bad. They even elect special judges and lawyers for students to debate any dispute, while the ten, randomly selected, students make up the jury. Every year, they have elections and you can only be re-elected in “officce” after three years have pass, to fight off corruption.” explained Blaise to a captivated audience who was completely blown away by how different the French school fonctionned.
''Of course! Nobody will force you to take classes you don't like after your OWLS! The reason why Durmstrang kept on his dark arts program when all other schools dropped it was because the school believed that children need to know both the good, the bad and the ugly of magic and what happens when someone abuses any side of it. The dark arts classe also teaches the appropriate way of using spells and the dangers link to it.''
Harry got up and made his way to his Headmaster to shake his hand. As was proper protocol for any champion. The man clasped the forearm of his student and placed a firm hand on his shoulder, signalling his blessing and approval of the competitor. By clasping, Harry’s forearm instead of simply shaking his hand meant that his Headmaster was recognising him as a warrior and not just as his student. It touched the young man deeply to be recognised as such in a public setting.
She clearly loved her nephew and cared for his safety and health; she took immediate actions to make sure that her nephew could be safe and sound. She understood (maybe not in it's entirety) the ramifications of the duel between young Harry and Lord Voldemort and proceeded to make sure that her nephew's future was not in danger. Futhermore, her blood relation to Lily Potter, her obvious love for her nephew and the scattered toys and youngling necessities only made the blood wards all the more powerful. No one could offer better protection to young Hadrian than Rose Evans, soon to be Vaux De Villiers(except perhaps, Lily Potter herself).
''Really? I thought it was a core class?'' said Harry, surprised at this news.
Pride and joy swelled the older man's heart. Since the moment he laid eyes on that little baby boy all those years ago, Alexander never was the same again. He became silly and cared less about his statuts and his reputation; caring far more for Harry's well-being and happiness. He invested himself in his community and grew the desire to have a family. Unfortunately, he couldn't have biological children, but he had found a son in his nephew by mariage.
Both Rose and Harry ignored him at the best of their abilities. Why should they pay attention to that brat?
Many witches, young and old, requested dances and Harry always danced with grace and without complaints. Even when his partner was a bold eleven year old who asked to dance. Harry could be seen either on the dancefloor or at a table discussing with various people. However, even the best gentlemen need to take a breather and so the young wizard made his way to the buffet with his friend Igor. He was parched and needed a glass of water before he collapsed.
Immediately, Harry started on his letter of refusal. The faster he wrote this letter, the faster they could leave Rennes for Berlin. It did not take too long as it did not need too much explanations.
Immediately, the champion made his way to Lilianne and held his hand to shake hers. With a big smile, the French girl took the hand and offered her well wishes; then Harry did the same. The champion was absolutely excited to have been chosen and had never even thought that they could be. They had only entered because his friends had persuaded him to do so and had promised to do it with them.
The Durmstrang student applauded with grace and curiosity at the young woman’s skills. Muggleborns were not accepted in Durmstrang and many of the students came from Old Blood and some from blood-purist families. Many had prejudices against those of Muggle descent and seeing that one was just accepted as a champion over many other of so-called purer blood, it led to reflection and no small amount of curiosity. If she proved to be skilled and powerful, then she might be worth marrying into a branch family or a third or younger son of a main branch. Power was power, regardless where it came from and it was not to be spat upon.
McGonagall was disappointed to say the least, but understood the young man's decision; she just hoped to be able to hide this letter from Albus long enough to keep Harry safe and into the school of his choice. He clearly liked Runes and Duelling; classes that were either cancelled a few years after the war or were only thaught during third year and the whole curriculum was substandard to that of the other schools in the world. No matter how many times the current teacher tried to change the curriculum or offer new ways to teach without costing anything to the school, Albus and the Ministry would have none of it. It would be unfair to the students who couldn't keep up and no one would be interested in such a hard class.
After his name was cleared and after Sirius had paid the twins for their part, Ragnok had invited the ex-convict to meet Harry in France. Completely ignoring Albus Dumbledore's attempts to speak with him and attempts to stop him from leaving the country, Sirius made it to France and finally had a chance to meet his godson. Harry and Sirius finally were able to bound as they should have been. They were joined by the end of summer by a man named Remus Lupin who turned out to be an old friend of Sirius and James.
(At minight in the streets of Paris), a very innoncent and beautiful song... So long as you were too young or too stupid of understand the very strong sexual innuendo behind the words. Thankfully, Draco was neither and began to sing; he swayed his hips and purred his words out with a breathless voice.
Once the song was over, Draco sauntered out of the stage and went to his friends. There he was met by the manager of the Blue Covent who insisted to pay him for his show as it had brought in many customers and to ask him to come back. Draco politely declined and explaining why he couldn't come back, since he was technically a minor. The manager payed the teenager and was about to escort the trio out when none other than Ricardo Zabini showed up to “congradulate” the beautiful performer he had the delight of watching.
The Vaux De Villiers were the pride of the dark families of France. The name had become over the centuries something typically french; if you truly wanted to explore France, you had to go see the great castle of
Why twenty-one instead of seventeen? Because at seventeen, you are a child that still make stupid mistakes that could impact the future. You just got out of Hogwarts and now, with all the money you could possibly dream of and little to no supervision, you would most certainly spend it all on frivolous things. Furthermore, at seventeen, you were more influencable than you would be at twenty-one. At twenty-one, you have more experience in the real world. You have a better graps of responsibilities and you had time to make mistakes and learn from them. It wasn't ideal, as you could still make mistakes, but at least the purcentage was significantly lower.
Harry didn't know what to think. This was something he had never thought of; this certainly put things into perspective. If this is what he was going to learn at Durmstrang and no where else, than it changed to game. Besides, his uncle was right, he couldn't just take on a school where he would be miserable and might not be treated right just because of the Ministry and Dumbledore's need to control everything! The people around him hadn't work and scheme just for him to bend to the old man's will! This was his life! He would call the shots and screw to hell anyone who disagree with it!
Albus looked at the students all waiting for the names of the competitors to be called out by him. All looked at him. All were focused on him. As they all should be. While the vast majority looked at him with excitement, awe, respect and joy; many more were looking at him with either mistrust (mostly Slytherins), disgust (again, mostly Slytherins) and bewilderment (the visiting students who could not believe this man would wear such hideous garments at such an official event). Albus almost frown when he saw Harry bloody Potter sneer at his robes and whisper something in that dirty Gypsy boy’s ear. What was wrong with his robes? They were all the rage in London!
''I will take custody of Harry and leave the country as soon as I can reach a certain friend of mine. I will be taking Harry with me as I leave. Now write the letter and fetch one of your friends. I need to make a few phones calls.'' said Rose as she pulled out two pieces of papers and making her way to the toddler on the floor.
“If I could have a moment of your time, the cup will soon be announcing the names of the champions. Again, I must warn all students that should your name be chosen as a champion, you will have to compete or face dire consequences. However, should the chosen champion be under the age of seventeen, the Ministry and the organisers of the Tournament would be declaring this Triwizard Tournament of 1997 officially cancelled and the student shall be expelled for ruining the competition.  There is a reason we made sure that only those in their seventh year and were of age could participate. The tasks are extremely dangerous and deadly. They are not unsurmountable, but they were made in mind for those who have already pass their sixth year. Now, ladies and gentlewizards… The first champion of the Triwizard Tournament of 1997 is…”
Questions: 1- Who do you want as Hogwarts champion? I already know who will be Durmstrang's and Beauxbâtons, but not sure on Hogwarts. It has to be a boy.
Said a little voice in her head. What could she do? What should she do? She didn't known!
And so, the two battled it out in a fight of wits and charms. Pansy fought viciously and simperly, but Ricardo was simply more apt, more experience and had more talent than her. Narcissa favored Ricardo and gave her blessing to the man to court her baby boy. Lucius was more cautious than his wife and did not allow the man to simply walk in the gardens at night with Draco, to Narcissa's frustration.
It took every once of strengh and training in Rose not to break down in tears. She couldn't fantom how someone could be so cold and heartless as to announce that their sister had lost her life in such a manner. And that was nothing compared to what the man was asking Petunia to do to little Harry! The man, basically, told her to neglect and treat Harry like less than family and delibrately left the boy in the hands of a woman he had to know hated magic. Why else would he remind her of all the magical things that Petunia wanted but Lily had in such a way?
''For example, at Ilvermorny you will learn the spell
Pansy was not a beauty, not on the outside nor on the inside. She was vicious, ignorant, lazy and spoiled. She did not believe that witches should work . Having a rich, powerful and influencial husband was to pintacal of THE DREAM every witch should aspire to and Draconis Lucius Malfoy was that price to aim for. She would be the next Lady Malfoy, then Lord Malfoy Sr would get into a small accident, then she would convince her new husband that his mother conspired against his heir and himself in order to have her exiled and then she would be THE unofficial queen of England.
It was during the exchange of vows that Sirius finally realised that Remus John Lupin was the man with whom he wished to spent the rest of his life with. So, he made his way through the city of Bucharest and found a jewelery shop; it was there that he found the perfect ring for his darling. A beautiful platinum ring shaped like a howling wolf with blue diamond for the eye of the wolf, just like his. It had a twin with a yellow diamond for the other wolf's eye, just like Remus's. It was perfect for Remus! Sirius invited his lover to the fanciest and most expensive restaurant in Romania to have all of the restaurant to themselves. After dining by candlelights, Sirius got down on one knee and asked his love if he would do him the honor of being his husband. Next morning, Remus and Sirius announced the news to the Vaux de Villiers and to Harry.
The two rivals met on a cold weekend of May, on the planes of Tuscany and, with Alcazar as his second, Harry fought the duel of his life. No rules, no hold-backs, no limitations aside from the Unforgivables; anything else was permitted. Half-way through, however, Ricardo cheated and had four of his friends, plus his second, attack his opponents. Alcazar and Igor wasted no time in coming to their friend's aid, taking each two opponents. The duel took less than fifteen minutes and resulted in Harry's camp victory. Despite ruining his reputation and his family's good name, Ricardo refuse to honor his end of the deal and fled the field, only to be stopped by Blaise who handed over the promised prize to the victor.
“Now, ladies and gentlemen, this cup is the impartial judge who will decide who will become the champions for their school. Now, because of the high mortality in the past, the various Ministries involved, the three Head of schools participating and the many concerned parents, the only people allowed to participate will be seventh years who are seventeen years old. No one else is to enter. No exception.” the old man warned with a stern stare at the audience to impress his warning, not that it stopped the grumbling of the younger years; which shocked the Durmstrang delegation.
''I was told that young Hadrian has a soul leech in his scar and that you were unable to have it remove due to technical issues. I will come with you both to have the abomination remove, however, you must bound as soon as possible. The news of the soul leech in the Brittish Wizarding World will not be kept silent from anyone very long and if you are both married; one with the blood of late Lily Potter, née Evans and the other a Pureblood, they will not be able to do anything. After all, Rose bounded herself to a wizard to afford a proper education worthy of young Hadrian's status. Then, brought the youngling to a healer to make sure he was in good health. Add to this that you both accept to follow what many would call an invasive and insulting protocol, will show that you both have young Hadrian's best interest at heart.''
Even Sirius and Remus were looking forward to going back to England. If only to shock the Purebloods with their recent marriage. They could already see the faces of the uptight and elitist bigots when they would announce to the world that the very eligible bachelor, Sirius Orion Black, was now off the market and happily married to a male werewolf. What excited Sirius however was the prospect of seeing his cousin Narcissa’s face when she would discover that her son would never inherit the Black Lordship. The woman had been insufferable since his release to name her son his heir, since he was the closest male heir to the main line. Completely disregarding (just like Alexander’s aunt) the fact that Sirius, as part of his godfather’s oath, had decided to name Harry his heir and had blood-adopted him. I mean, how else would he have gotten so many titles, on top of those he inherited from his father?
It didn't take long before the toddler with a raven's nest for hair raised his head and looked up at his aunt and a bright smile came across his face. He raised his little pudgy arms and made a grabby hands motion to have his aunt raise him up. Without waiting, Rose took Harry in her arms and gave him the bigest hug she could give him without being crushed. She placed a small kiss on her nephew's forehead to offer a bit of comfort to her now orphan nephew.
for a reason. She was quick, nimble, vicious and swift in battle. While second best duellist to Draco Malfoy in her year, Lilianne was the best under heavy pressure. Her strategic mind and skills was what made the decision for the Goblet of Fire.
No one had questions and so, they were let go. Madame Maxime and Lilianne left the small room together after promising to sent Harry’s regards to Draco, making the young man smile. This caused a bit of a problem with Dumbledore. Immediately, the man requested (read demanded) to speak privately with Harry as he had some important information to tell him. Headmaster Anker wasted no time to tell his English counterpart that he was not going to have a private conversation with one of HIS students without his presence; especially as said student was their school’s champion. It was unethical and improper! How many times would he have to repeat himself?
Now Albus was truly screwed. He had to give up the books, the Invisibility cloak and Harry to Ragnok or face a cell in Azkaban. No amount of manipulation, of sweet talk or grand-fatherly wisdom would save him now. However, if he could place a few more blocks and tracking spells on the boy before handling him over to the goblins... Ah! No. That would not due. Ragnok must have thought of that possibility and demanded to know the location, but forbide Dumbledoor to ever see or retrieve Harry. He could not be in the same room, he could not communicate with the child's guardians, he could not send one of his friends to see the child or communicate with the child or it's current guardians. Dumbledoor could only give the adress and that was it.
Not many country could say that they were proud of their Dark Lords; Germany had all but kicked out the Grindelwald family after their black sheep had started the war and Spain still refused to acknowledge that they had the most Dark Lords than any other country in all of Europe (more than two per centuries in the last millenia; far more than all the Eastern countries put together during the same lapse of time). France, however, made sure that everyone knew that they had their very own Official Dark Lord whom they could consult and work with if a situation arised that had any connection to the dark. For every consultation, the Head of the Vaux De Villiers would receive compensation for disturbing his precious time. They were the closest thing to royalty since the French Revolution (Surprinsingly, the only conflict that the Vaux De Villiers have never engaged in).
the cutting spell. Now this spell can cut through many things, from tissues for the seamstress to a tree for the lumberjack; and that is it. At Durmstrang, you will learn it's darker cousin
While his plans were not going as he had wished them, they were not completely ruined. There was still hope. He could still win back his pawn and his glory. If only that Petunia bitch had simply listen to him and not given the boy away. Curse her and her sister to hell!
This, of course, was quite painful to Dumbledoor's ego as he had thought that he had manipulated the Potter prat into giving him his fortune, but now he had nothing. However, the worse had yet to come. Filling to become Harry's only magical guardian, Albus learned that Charlus Potter had once again beaten him to it. Before his death, the man made his son relenquish to him his right to choose a magical guardian other than the child's godparents. In other words, since Sirius Black was now in Azkaban (unfornate, but necessary to his plans) and Alica Longbottom, née MacMillan, in St-Mungoes, it was Charlus Fleamont Potter that decided who would be the Boy-Who-Lived's magical guardian. And boy did Albus get the shock of his life! As it turns out, no one but the goblin Ragnok could choose where could Harry live, where he could persue his magical education, how he was raised and what rituals he could perform or have perform on him.
''Yes, I am. I am aware that I am not a magical like my nephew, but I am marrying a wizard who will help me take care of my nephew. In exchange, I help him obtain his heritage by marrying him. Alexander will teach Harry how to managed his estates and his heritage and make sure that Harry has all the necessary shots and medical treatments. He does not have children and he would love to raise Harry.''
Harry just couldn't keep his eyes from the muscular thighs, chests, stomachs and bottoms of his teammates. Before he could realise it, he was hard and leaking; he had to hide his erection and hope none of his teammates would notice. Unfortunately for him, his team captain had notice and wanted to help. Making sure that Harry's back was snug against his chest, Nicolai Ransovski began to let his hands roam his seeker's body, causing shivers down his spine. Nibbing and sucking at Harry's neck, he wrapped his hand around his seeker's cock and began to move up and down. A couple of strokes was all Harry needed to get his first orgasm. Slumping against the wall to hold himself up, the young man just let himself be dryhumped by his captain as the older boy rubbed agaisnt his crack. Before his captain finished, Harry had time to cum again. It had been the young man's first sexual experience, but certainly not the last with his captain.
There were plans and contingencies in place should Harry fall for such a trap. In fact, the very same day he turned seventeen and taken his Lordships, he had designed a Will and made sure to give a copy to Gringotts, to his aunt, to each of his uncles, to each of his best friends, to the Ministry (both French and British) and even to his own Headmaster. He had already chosen his heirs in case he died without one. Should a girl come up and say that she was pregnant with HIS child, he would demand a paternity test on the babe and only marry her if she could prove the child was his. He had stipulated in the Potter Family Charter that any Potter who wanted to get married had to be verified by the goblins for potions, spell, hexes and others.
However, the young man panicked and started to resist arrest just as a, new of the force, auror lost his cool and began to lay hexes after hexes on the resisting fellon. Both sides tried to stop the fight from getting worse, but it did not matter, as the auror cast a stupefy strong enough to send the man backwards and have him crack his head on a rock hidden in the grass. This infuriated the Gypsies! After the young auror was pulled away from the scene by his superior, the remaining aurors spent five hours trying to calm the community down. An apologie was made by the Hungarian Law Department, but the auror did not lose his job since he was simply doing as protocole dictated. As you can imagine, it did not sit well with the Gypsie communities in Hungaria. Controversy sparked. Eastern Europe was divided on the issue. People started to blame the Gypsies and saying that they should not be allowed to move so freely between countries as it could lead to smuggling (ironically, the man was arrested because he was high on drugs at the moment and was only facing two weeks in jail); others said that the young auror should be charged for man-slaughter and put in prison. Obviously, Igor supported the Gypsies side of the controversy and said that the auror should have stopped when his superiors told him to stop. Unfortunetally, Alcazar supported the side of the government.
It took Ragnok less than two minutes to properly locate the old Dursley house; three more minutes to find out that Dumbledoor's spy was now dead due to the inherent stupidity of surburban housewives; and one hour to locate Harry's new home. Without so much as taking a moment to breath, Ragnok flooed to 37 rue de Montmartre, Paris, France.
his privacy during this difficult time for him. It was so nice to see how
Ever since first year, when she had met Parvati and Lavender, she had discovered an infinite number of ways to turn her old and sometimes raggity clothes into her own fashion design. Many had fallen in love with her design and had asked for her to create similar outfits. She had worked hard and delegently to be where she was today. She had learned all the magic she could, from charms to potions to transfiguration to muggle designers, to always be one step closer to her dream. She remembered the book on business and finances and the fashion magazines from around the world, both muggle and magical, the twins had gotten her and all the times they had helped her buy what she needed. She didn't want to throw all of that away just because her mom's outdated views on what a witch was supposed to be. She didn't want seven kids, she didn't want to be fighting the good fight for the light and for an old man who wanted to sell her off to his supporters as if she was a prize to gain. So, she vowed to herself that she would tell Harry of the plot as soon as she could. Her friend didn't deserve to be trapped like this and neither did she.
It wasn't the most subtle of threats, but he had to impress the consequences of what the actions of his friend would be if he dared to hurt Lilianne. Many in the past had their friends vouched their caracthers, hoping that it would make them seem less threatening and ingratiate themselves towards Lilianne or Draco. It never worked, due to the fact that the blond knew perfectly well that mates looked out for one another and that Marco would do the same for him if asked. Therefor, it wasn't a stretch to assume that the others would do the same.
The man was a dispecable bastard of the worse kind. Knocking up a fifteen year old girl (there was an unspoken truth that the fourty-two year old man had drugged the girl to get what he wanted), forcing her to marry him, abandonning his child and wife two days after the birth of his heir to celebrate in the dirtiest brothels of Paris, infecting his young wife with syphilis and then castrating his heir when his father had threathen to kick him out of the family and make his son the rightfull successor, killing all other potential heirs and forcing his wife to raise his illegimate daughter... Was it any wonder that the man got killed by his own family magick? With no available heir, uncle Alexander had blood-adopted his nephew and had been able to save his House.
So dance the night away...
. It never went further, but it helped her narrow what she was looking for in a man. Now, just because some of them acted proper and charming did not mean that once they were refused something for the first time in their life that they would take it calmly... They tried to force the young woman to comply to THEIR wishes, only to be visited by an enraged English Dragon. They never did managed to find the left testicule of Nathaniel Rougemont...
“Grades don’t define who you are. I don’t have the top spot in my year and I was chosen. I think the Goblet chooses those that have an equal amount of power, skills and ingenuity, and are capable of using it all to achieve greatness. If grades were the only requirements, then I know at least two other people would have been chosen over me. The Trials are meant to test your endurance, your cunning and strength of conviction. If you were chosen over anyone else in your school that put their names down, it’s because you are capable and worthy to bring honor to your school.” Reassured Lilianne, who just couldn’t help but like this really nice young man.
“Wait… what? Why would he do that? What would he gain if I were to marry you? If you did become my wife and we lived together, you would be force to follow MY directives. You would not be allowed to take money out of my vaults unless I gave you a sum by hand, you would not even be able to see your family without my permission. That’s how the law works in England! You would be my property for lack of better words. How does he expect to control me?” asked Harry, confused and quite pissed.
Unfortunately, her other nephew didn't appreciate not being the center of attention and began to wail and throw a temper tantrum. Rose steadily ignored the boy and proceed to take some baby food to feed Harry. It only made Dudley angrier; to make sure that everyone knew it by throwing his toy at his aunt's head. It never Rose as she caught the toy mere inches from her head and kept the toy in her hand. This did not made Dudley any happier; it made things worse.
“Headmaster, I know you don’t like me and that you don’t recognise my authority, but let me be very clear. If you keep on harassing Lord Potter or keep on hurting our country’s reputation, I will have you thrown out of Hogwarts and out of the Wizengamot so fast; you won’t have time to say Lemon Drop. Do I make myself clear?” asked Marvolo in a tight and strained voice, demanding an answer.
” declined to attending this event.
Molly was planning her daughter's wedding with the Boy-Who-Lived. She had been so disappointed when she had learned that the boy had been at Charlie's wedding as a friend of the bitch's brother. At least, her precious Ginny had a chance to meet the boy and try to seduce him. Thankfully, the Triwizard Tournament was going to happen next year! Ginny was going to have more chances to seduce him. Everything was going according to plan... If she only knew how wrong she was!
to be exact, we will have the traditional Weighing of the Wands. Where a professional Wandmaster will come and inspect your wands to make sure that they are in order. We will then have a small press conference. If there is any subject, you do not want the press to ask about, please warn your respective Headmasters and we will make sure to explain this to the press. If the press does insist on those subjects, we will be throwing them out. Now, is there any questions?” explained Leeman with a large smile.
It would not be until it was far too late that Albus Dumbledore would hear word that Harry wasn't coming to Hogwarts. He, of course, ran to the Minister of Magic to have him force the goblin Ragnok to change Harry's school, but the goblin was on vacation and not returning until September the second (No, mister Minister, Ragnok didn't leave just to spite you and your ministry. No, we can't overturn this decision. No, we will not call him back from his much needed vacation, the first one he took in the last twenty years. No, we cannot look into his files to see which school Mister Potter is going to attend. Because, that's against the law and would be breaking the Goblin/Wizard peace treaty of 1813. Yes, we know who you are...). Unfortunately for Dumbledore and Fudge, word of Harry Potter's decision not to attend Hogwarts made it to the Prophet and everyone was up in arms. Thousands of howlers were sent to Ragnok (which the goblin simply destroyed before the letters even had time to explose), to the Minister (he had no chance) not doing anything to bring back their boy hero and to Dumbledore for allowing such a thing to happen.
Harry smirked, put a little banshee figurine on the shelf and rubbed his hand on his trousers.
"We could talk about my ridiculousness at my place,  Malfoy."
Harry nodded.
"Feelings are scary."
Harry just shrugged.
Harry scratched his nose. Floor calls were exhausting.
"Why me, Harry?"
Today, Circe's apples would arrive, golden orbs that would make a room break out into quarrels.
Now, why did he argue so hard about that? It was none of his business anyway and Nott had never introduced any girlfriends to him, so what Potter said might be true. Harry had finished his drink and determinedly tried to drink the ice cubes now. He took one into his mouth and crushed it with his teeth. It sounded awful. Draco stared at his pink lips.
It was probably part of it. Did he tell Belial all the same phrases, did he scratch his back? Did he kiss his nape? Draco felt how Potter opened his belt, saw him kneel in front of him with that perfect impersonation of love on his face. Then there was a swirling tongue, a warm throat and the feeling of getting sucked dry, as if all his self-preservance was sucked into Potter's mouth.
"Yeah, maybe. I guess. I'm glad to have you back, though. And I guess I'm just as evil. I didn't just kill the Dursleys, I tortured them and planned it all out. Maybe we could try to be better, what do you say to that?"
"What?"
"So, I am distracting."
"That's still twenty minutes away", Harry said and tugged on Draco's trousers.
"Hullo Ron."
"Muggles can be rapists too, you know?"
"Have you tried it with a bloke?" Potter said and had the audacity to look him directly in the eyes while doing so.
There wasn't a lot of people who were allowed to call Harry at work. Mad-eye, Minerva and Belial. That was it. Oh, and Draco, but he didn't know that.
"Sure. But have a cuppa first", Harry replied. She accompanied him to the kitchen and he boiled the kettle.
"This is a raid", the head auror snarled.
"Potter."
"Apparently, it's impossible to find someone to shag who is not off-limits."
"Just... It would be too much drama, ok?"
"Stay here, Hermione. You'll have to put up with my lovers though."
"That was so good, Malfoy. I didn't know that about you."
"Sure. Good to hear from you, mate", he answered, slight relief in his voice. Draco had been a bit cold recently.
"Come to my place, then."
"Harry, I'm sure we'll figure this out."
"I'm sorry, man. I misunderstood."
Just because you were selling semi-dark objects, you didn't have to have a dirty and badly lit interior.
"No. I haven't tried much at all, I was busy working."
"Well. It doesn't have to", Belial said. His voice sounded broken.
When he woke up, he was in front of his apartment, soiled and gritty.
This chapter has a consensual BDSM scene in it, there is a very detailed description of spanking and the inner monologue of a conflicted dom.
Draco knew he shouldn't call Potter. He knew he had to protect himself from him. But the problem with having been numb for such a long time was, that feeling good was addictive. And Potter didn't have to know how much it bothered him that he was fucking Belial. Maybe Draco could pretend to be someone who could just smile and share. But the thought of Potter's hands on Belial was torture. Did he smile at him the same way he smiled at Draco? Did he take his glasses off to give him head? Did they kiss? Of course they did, kissing was part of it. To imagine them kissing was like taking a bludger to the stomach. Did they cuddle in their sleep, did they drink out of the same cup of tea? Were they holding hands in public? Did Potter tell Belial about Draco's little habits, were they laughing about his childish crush? It was absolutely unbearable to think about. And he still wanted to call him. He could play dumb and Potter wouldn't know how pathetically jealous Draco was. Potter would let Draco touch him again, Potter would flirt and smile at him like he always did, because to him, nothing had changed. The whole storm in a teacup would go unnoticed. But Draco wouldn't hope anymore. He wouldn't get used to it, because it would end eventually with Potter leaving him. Enjoying it while it lasted was his only option. It felt like the first time he had to get to platform 9 3/4. But this time, it wasn't a magical barrier, it was just a solid, concrete wall and he was running into it head-first. Draco went to the mirror and practiced care-free facial expressions. Hi there, Potter. Everything is fine. I'm not heart-broken at all. His eyes looked pink again. Breath in. Breath out. And now, calmly to the floo, stiff upper lip. He made the call and Potter answered it immediately, no time to practice the words in his head anymore.
"Then don't think about it. Nobody is making you come to my house and insult my guests."
Draco scourgified the plates. Harry basically jumped him and snogged him so hard he tasted blood. "Draco", he mumbled.
There was a cracking noise and Hermione was in the kitchen, a bag of books on her shoulder. She looked good. Her brown hair was in a long, thick braid. Her oversized sweater and boots were as shrew-like as ever, but somehow it looked more deliberate to Ron now, after not having seen her a while. More sexy librarian, less unkempt.
"As in "we fuck" or as in "we sleep next to each other and I'm oblivious to the effect it could have on precious, wonderful, baby gay Draco"?
"See you around Nott", Nott said to Potter.
Harry had become an Auror because he didn't know what else to do, once Voldemort was gone. He knew he should've felt relief, but all he had felt was exhaustion. When Ginny left him, he had nodded and told her that he understood.And she had cried and swore to stay his friend, no matter what. "Figures", she had said when Harry came out as gay.
When he had done it with Pansy, he had stayed on top. She didn't mind, she liked it, even. He had been rough and brutal about it, and he had wanted her to say no and tell him that he was a weird, perverted bastard, but she didn't. She had just moaned into his shoulder.
"No."
Potter fell asleep immediately. And miraculously, Draco did too after a while. He dreamed of nothing.
"Will you stop wearing glasses, then?"
"Breakfast, anyone?"
"Yes. Do you like movies?"
"For what?"
"Please do. I'll do whatever you tell me to."
"Hi Weasley", Draco said and helped himself to a cup of tea. "Trying to make up with Granger?"
"But nobody knew."
"Well let's just say a lot. I like hook-ups."
"Well, I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings."
"She's not here at the moment. But I can tell her you were here."
"Who would've thought", Draco replied dryly.
"Why are you doing that, Potter? It is very distracting."
Then he grabbed his shaft and swirled his tongue around the tip. Draco moaned. Pansy had given him some hurried blow jobs at Hogwarts, but it had felt nothing like this. His heart was beating in his throat, and everything Potter did felt so intense that it bordered on pain. He took his whole lenght inside, relaxing his throat, but still choked a bit. Then he stopped sucking him. Draco was a bit disappointed.
Potter swallowed the rest of the ice cube and grinned. It was somehow even worse than the chewing. It was crude and a weird type of humour that Draco just didn't quite get. Potter ordered an other drink.
"How can you stand it? Me buggering you?"
Draco really wanted to stay.
"Exactly like you, actually."
"No. I want to do it again."
Belial laughed bitterly.
"Hey Malfoy, glad you could come."
"Please, please fuck me, Malfoy, I want you so bad!", he said. You don't want me, you want my cock, Draco thought. But you will get it, like you always do, you'll get what you came here for. Draco pulled his finger out and  shoved Potter off his lap. And then he fucked him. Careless, probably painful. Fucked him like a rag doll, holding him by his hair. And Potter took it, screaming and holding on to Draco's arms. Draco pulled out when he felt that he was close to coming. He squirted white come on the dark bruises. He rubbed it into him. It was territorial and stupid and naive. Those bruises would let any other man know that Draco had been there.
Draco concealed his panic with manners.
"Maybe."
Potter's eyes darkened. He likes the truth, Draco thought to himself. He likes when I tell him. I think I'll do that. Maybe he wants me to hurt him. I can do that, too. I would like that. I would like to smash him.against the wall. I would like to spank him and make him scream.
"Do what you want. Just don't kill me", Potter said and he sounded like he meant it. It was a bit scary but it filled Draco with anticipation.
"For old time's sake."
Belial looked at the two of them and smirked. "I think I forgot to water my plant. I have to go home now. Enjoy your date."
"You did WHAT!"
Draco smiled, non-commital.
It was Belial's fault, really. He had wanted to go out tonight, Draco had merely suggested the Hog's Head. As far as pubs went, they had the best Firewhiskey. And that they went there at nine was pure coincidence.
"Hey, so, Malfoy,  I know you and Potter aren't exclusive, but are you really cool with me and him shagging? Because, I will stop immediately if it bothers you. I wouldn't want to risk our friendship over this, it's just sex", Nott told Draco over a pint, and it was like a bludger hitting him in the chest. He bit his tongue so hard that he tasted blood, and that was the only reason he didn't start crying in the middle if a crowded pub. When did Potter even find time to fuck other men? Did he use a time-turner? Did he squeeze it into his lunch break? Draco stared at Belial in shock. It made sense. Belial and him. They were flirting in front of him the first time they met. So why did this feel like fiendfire? Why couldn't he open his mouth and say something,  anything, to Belial.
"How about you stop being so shitty and work on deserving him?"
"Fine. And you?"
Oh boy.
They all ate in awkward silence.
Potter saw him and waved. "Come on, Belial. Let's greet Potter."
"What the fuck, Harry? What does this death eater scum do in your apartment?"
"Oh fuck. Draco. Shit. Are you ok? You didn't... He didn't tell you?"
Potter moved next to him, his brows furrowed. Then he spasmed and screamed, a weird,  high-pitched scream.
"What? You just said you forgive me. I already apologised. What more do you want?"
"That you could be like that."
"Well I guess you're not used to this type of thing."
"Do you want it to be?"
"You're an absolute arsehole and you can go fuck yourself, because I'm not going to do it for you, Potter."
"Don't worry, Potter. We all have nightmares from the war. Me, too."
Draco didn't know how to react to that. No part of it made sense. They were casually talking about this, much like he heard talk others about the war. And the saviour, the hero, had lived a nightmare similar to Draco in his youth, apparently. But it sounded worse. Aunt Bella hadn't been around much, and Potter had been raised by his uncle.
"Hermione. I'm so sorry", Ron said. "Forgive me Please!"
"I'll wait for her here if that's alright with you."
"You're going to end up a spinster with that attitude. Or do you want to fuck around, like Harry? That might work for queers, but no straight wizard wants a slag", Ron shouted.
"He's dead now."
"Yes, sure. What do you have?"
"I genuinely like it up the arse. I even like it rough, as long as I chose to do it."
"Of course. You have to give up because you're wrong."
"It's funny how it's not just the war. How everything cruel and bad just merges into one giant monster of pain."
Darkness. And in the shadows, his mistakes, ready to scream at him as soon as he closed his eyes.
"Wow."
When Draco was done sweeping, there was the noise of apparating. Five aurors stood in the shop, wands raised.
"Uh, hi Granger", he mumbled and ruffled his hair. Harry thoughtlessly un-ruffled it in a very boyfriend-like manner indeed. Then he kissed Harry good-bye and walked into the fireplace.
The last thing he heard was laughter.
"Shit. The other thing, then."
I have been summoned to an inquiry about our merchandise by the ministry of magic. I trust that you keep the business running in my absence. I expect to return to a clean shop, anything that doesn't entice our esteemed and proper customers should be cleaned up immediately.
Draco nodded and tried to smile, but it just didn't work. His face didn't obey his instructions.
"I've wanted to do this since fifth grade", Potter murmured and then he touched Draco's lips with his. Draco had never felt a beard while kissing, but quite liked the roughness of it. Potter was rough with him, nipping at his lips and grabbing his hair. And then he felt his tongue and tasted firewhiskey. Draco leaned into him, pushing his tongue into Potter's mouth and burrying his hands in the mop of tousled hair. He felt Potter's erection pressing against him. They were nearly the same highth and their cocks were frotting against each other. Draco grabbed Potter's bum. It was softer than he would've thought, a bit bouncy even.
"I'm sorry. I see how important the things you did were. I shouldn't have taken you for granted."
One of the aurors didn't have his wand out and was fiddling with his thumbs instead. Draco looked into his face and froze. It was Potter, unmistakably, still the same face with his messy hair and those glasses that never seemed to stay put. Draco felt something he hadn't felt in years. Hot, juvenile anger bubbled up inside him. So there was Potter, holier-than-thou St. Fucking Potter, and raided his place? Really? He crossed his arms and was close to snarling something along the lines of searching his arse for dark magic, but then remembered that it wasn't a good idea to anger the people who might close this place down if he had forgotten even a single apple outside of the hidden department that only activated if you said the right words.
None of the Head of Houses regretted not informing the Headmaster sooner about Potter's refusal to attend Hogwarts, but all of them wondered how it would have been to have him as a student. His reputation as one of the best of Durmstrang Institute, his duelling skills and his prodigy-level graps of Runes made him seemed like such a pleasant student to teach. Loosing such a promising student all because of the Headmaster's ridiculous needed to control everything and his foolish plans, was a bitter, hard and digusting pill to swallow. As if the school's standing amongst the Great Eleven Schools wasn't enough, Hogwarts had been loosing more and more students every year to other schools around the world or the vocational schools here in England. It was heart-breaking!
Now, why does of all this matter? Well, Rose was a woman who knew how to fight, survive and kill without ever being caught. Add on to this, her protectiveness and her vindictiveness, you have a powerful and dangerous enemy. She was not going to stand around and let her nephew be used and manipulated by gold-digging, wand-waving, entitled, arrogant and delusional fools like Dumbledore and his sycophants.
Draco had met the man before and had not been impressed; the man gave off a perverted and predatory feeling. Not the good kind either, the kind that told the blond that Zabini was not a man who would hesitate to raise a hand on his lovers and would not understand the meaning of the word no. Fortunately, Marco was there to save Draco as he grabbed him by the waist, pulled him close to him and began laughing loudly, before pulling him towards the exit with a bouquet of rose in one hand and a loud proclamation that he was the one going home tonight with the most beautiful “girl” in all of France.
Only after this discoveries did the affair blow down. It did show a deep problem in the Eastern European countries however. It showed that not all were accepting of the different castes of society and the different communities. It also showed just how little people knew about the Gypsies and how much discrimination they faced on a daily basis. Alcazar eventually came to apologise to Igor for his insensitive remarks on his people; he had thought that it was obvious that the Gypsie caravan was smuggling things for the black market to survive and that the Gypsie communities sheltered any criminals who asked them for help. This had pained Igor greatly to think that his best-friend thought so poorly of his people and culture. Harry tried to mend the broken rift between them by forcing Alcazar to spend his summer in Igor's community in order to learn and break the prejudces he bore towards the Gypsies. As president and co-owner of his father's company, Alcazar was not in a position to refuse such an order. Their friendship was never the same after that. In some part it became stronger by learning and understanding the others way of life, in other parts, it was weaker than ever by the break of trust and betrayal. They slowly and surely made up.
“Of course! I like you Harry, but I love Blaise and I want nothing to do with that stupid plan of theirs. It’s so wrong and creepy that they would do this! I just need a few moments to center myself. You should leave first, and then I’ll leave in a few minutes. No need to make people gossip. I know the Disillusion spell.”
''Neither is Dudley! I am taking care of Harry, because no one fed him, changed him or comfort him after he JUST lost his parents! I didn't pay attention to Dudley because he was throwing a temper tantrum just because he wants to be the center of attention.'' snapped back Rose, insulted that her sister would dare scowl her for for not indulging her stupid kid. ''I said that I would going to take care of Harry and that is what I am going to do. Since, you are clearly too incompetent to take care or notice of anyone else than your own child. I will take care and notice this child and no other.''
Her door bell rang to announce a visitor. Expecting to see Petunia at her door to welcome her into the neighborhood, however, it wasn't. Instead, it was Miss number 5 Privet Drive. She brought a casserole and offered her the last new gossip on the street. According to her, Petunia and her family left for America after her husband received a promotion and the family left in less than three days later. It was all strange and rather suspicious as everyone knew that Vernon was an asbismal employee at his job and there was no way that he could have a promotion. So it was everyone's guess as to why the Dursleys left so fast. Obviously something scandalous.
“Don't worry about Alcazar. He has no intention of ever hurting your friend. He isn't one for one night-stands or bragging about which girls or how many he brings into his bed. Alcazar has five sisters, twelve aunts and sixteen female cousins. The last thing he would want for them is to become another trophy on some bloke's hunting board.” reassured the Durmstrang student as he looked on his friend on the dancefloor.
''I... I don't know, uncle. Ilvermorny is great and all, but I know I'll have a hard time with keeping my temper in check. I know they don't really take the british very seriously and sometimes it goes into bullying, but... they don't teach the dark arts and...'' said Harry with a small voice; he didn't want to offend his uncle who technically was a dark arts master.
! I must say that I admire your work. The Rougemont family had been out of control for years. Believing themselves above the law and the Ancient Laws of our world. With the patriarch's friendship with the previous gouvernement, it was impossible to do anything without commiting political suicide. Yet, you came and defeated their younguest and most powerful heir in single combat and was able to get out of it glorified. The Malfoy family was perhaps the only one who could do it. Not even the Vaux-De-Villiers wanted to get into that mess, we didn't have the political capital or strengh to do so. I am disapointed, however, that I was not able to see the duel. I heard it was spectacularly bloody... What a shame!” complimented Harry with a quick glance towards the blushing angel at his side, before turning his gaze to the dancefloor and hiding his smirk with a sip of his drink.
This had infuriated James and Albus. They had thought that with the vast wealth of the Potter family, they could do so much good for the future. They could sway the werewolves to their side, they could help muggleborns and their families move into new safehouses, they could arm themselves, they could build-up influence and combat that of the Death Eaters in the Wizengamot without having to sit to boring and long sessions. Yet, Charlus Potter's will was absolute. The man had declared his son inapt at the role of Lord of House Potter and left everything to his grand-child for it's 21
. Here is the paperwork and the contract to take care of young Hadrian. Like I said, I will need a report every fortnight to make sure of the state of Hadrian's developement and well-bieng. I will come once a month, randomly unannounced, to see for myself the progress going on. I will speak privately with youg Hadrian and what he tells me will be confidential. I want to make sure that there is no loopholes or possibilities for the Brittish Ministry of Magic to take young Hadrian from us. ''
She tore the letter open and began reading. It would be an obvious understatement to state that she was shocked at the content of the letter, but she couldn't, for the life of her, blame the child. Hogwarts standards had dropped significantly for quite some time now. Many of the classes that she had during her school days where removed; Albus managed to convince the Board of Governers and the Education Department to removed these classes that were so important to the students. Hogwarts international standing was the lowest in the Great Eleven Magical Schools and it only kept falling. The students were lazier and more prejudiced with every year passing.
It was during third year that Draco really started to come out of his shell. With the chance of studying Enchantement and new languages such as Russian, German and Chinese, Draco started meeting new people and started to make a name for himself. Slowly but surely, with his ease in Chinese and Russian, Draco became a very dedicated and appreciated student and sometimes tutor for other students. He even offered English turoring lessons and became the English teacher's assistant, earning him a bit of cash for his help (Lucius Malfoy often bragged to his Death Eater friends about his son's accomplishements) and some good impression from his teachers that will be getting him far in his future.
First, it had been the Marauders. Oh, she had loved thoses boys with all her heart! Sure they were responsible for a large part of her grey hairs, but they had been good boys. She bitterly cursed herself for not reigning them more and being a better Head of House. For, while they had been good-hearted boys, they also were bullies. She was not blind to their faults nor hers. She knew she should have done more. As for the twins... She gave them the discipline that she never given to the first group of pranksters; she, however, failed to see where their interests lied and encouraged them to pursue their dreams. It pained her that they weren't the only students she had failed, either. She felt old in her bones, so tired that even waking up was too much effort, she barely had any joy in her work at all and she was so sick and tired of dealing with Hermione Granger's holier than thou attitude and Ronald Weasley agressive and disrespectful behaviour.
The next morning, Draco took a long shower, went down to breakfast with his parents. Thankfully, neither of his parents ever found out about his wild night; it would not have been pretty if they had. His father may have understood even if he would most certainly disapprove; his mother... Best left unsaid! Hopefully, she will never find out.
Harry wanted to so badly to get into the good grace of the Malfoy heir; both, because he wanted to help his friend's chances to have something with the girl that clearly made him happy, and because the young man was drop dead gorgeous. Skilled duellist, infamous reputation, an aura of confidence that showed that Draco knew his place in the world without being arrogant or narcissitic, all wrapped up in a beautiful body that spoke of hours of training.
Everyone turned around and saw and squeletal warship rising from the depth of the lake. Large black sails rolling down and puffing up as they caught wind to bring the ship to shore, several yellow lights escaping from the multitude of portholes and the very intimidating 100 glimming and fully operational canons and at the top of the mast, the Durstrang Institute of Magic floated in the wind, made for one hell of an impressive entrance. Then, out of nowhere, as they were but a half a mile away from shore, the canons on deck rose facing the sky and, in a loud and deafening sound, each shot three times to signal the ship's arrival.
(Magical elementary academy), but insisted on teaching her nephew about the muggle world.
Now was time to dance.
Ragnok and aunt Rose were deeply agaisnt him learning the Dark Arts as this could give a reason to the British Ministry of Magic to take him away from his aunt, uncle Alexander and uncle Ragnok. However, if he went to Durmstrang he would have to learn them. He didn't know if it was worth it; maybe Ilvermorny wouldn't be so bad...
''Mr. Ragnock, do you really believe that Harry would be safer at Hogwarts? With Dumbledoor as it's Headmaster? During the man's tenure, more than half of the electives have been removed, the teaching posts cut by more than half, the standards of education are a joke, bullying is waved off with a ''
Thankfully, the Durmstrang delegation had agreed to a few class shared with the Hogwarts students. Albus knew that Harry had taken Defense, Ancient Runes and Potions. All classes that had either Hermione Granger or Ronald Weasley in them; they could interact and befriend Harry, leading him to the Light. Through young Ronald, Harry would meet young Ginevra and she could seduce him. He would have to send Granger and the Weasleys to investigate this relationship between the Malfoy brat and Harry.
Third year was the year Harry Potter's name started to make it's way into the high ranks of the European countries. It all started with creepy looks and an uncomfortable behavior from one of the teachers, one Ivan Gorgowitz. A fat, balding old man that taught Card Magic,a branch of magic that uses special card to either predict the future (with dubious accuracy), connect with the spirit world (more than once proven to be true and rare) and help transmit messages from the gods, the deads or something else that was never human or good to the living. Dark magic for some, but for the Magical Gypsies, a true gift from the gods. It was during that year that Harry met Igor Vanslow, a brilliant Card Mage from a gypsie family. During the entire year, Harry, Alcazar and Igor noticed a strange pattern emerging within their year peers and the upper years as well. Boys from lower class families where often put into detention with Professor Gorgowitz, as they were apparently trouble makers and the teacher had such a efficient ways to deal with them. They entered as normal students, but left hollow and terrified husks. It took the trio less than a term to figure out what was going on. The man was sexually abusing the young boys who had no political power to fight against the man or be taken seriously by the Headmaster Karkaroff. Harry never liked the man, but when his friend and him had discovered that he willingly turned a blind eye to the abuse... Well, lest just say it didn't take long before Uncle Alexander was made aware of the situation. Two hours after Harry had sent his letter, Igor came running to him to tell him that Alcazar was in detention with Gorgowitz and according to his cards, the man was going to be the boy's death if no one helped him. With adrenaline pumping through him, ignoring whom he bumped into and dragging furious teachers after him, Harry raced to the teacher's private quarters and burst in at the very moment where Alcazar lost conciousness.
As Harry was making his way to his quarters, Headmaster Anker called out to him and asked him to meet in his office. Curious, but knowing that any questions would be answered, Harry made his way to the captain's quarter and sat down on one of the chairs. Soon, the Headmaster and the rest of the staff that had came with the delegation entered the office and sat in front the Head's desk. Understanding that this was a serious meeting, the dark haired youth wondered where the other Elites were. Surely, if it was so important that it could not wait until morning, the others would have to be warned.
Once Petunia fed and changed her own son, she made her way to her contact book and look through to find her sister's number. It took her less than four tries before her sister finally picked up the phone.
The word had to be air-quoted because Albus Dumbledore had replied that the entire event was pointless since they would all meet at his school for the tournament. He added that if such an event was to take place, then the trip and stay of the students attending the event should be payed by the host as it would be unfair to FORCE his students to go to another country just for some party, especially as some students didn't have the money for it. Oh, yes! Because, requesting a portkey for France that lasted for 18 hours and that was freely given to any Brittish citizens as part of the economical trades the two countries had together, was such a hardship! Because, it was an affront to invite students to attend a party! A party that many of both school had declined to attend for various reasons without ever facing reprecussions for it! Because, it was horrible of them to host an event that promoted international cooperation and friendship in a non-competitive atmosphere... Please, could someone read the objectives of the Triwizard Tournament to Harry again!
It got bad and it got worse. It got so bad that Igor and Alcazar refused to speak to each other for three whole months. It was after Yule that the whole affair came to a head. It was discovered that the victim was consuming drugs during the caravan trip and had had mistaken the aurors for monsters, thus resisting arrest; it was also discovered that the young auror had been told horribly racist and false stories by his mentor, a man with a deep seated mistrust and hatred for the Gypsie community, and had thought that the man he had killed was going to use some dark curse on them. His behavior was strange and he was speaking in giberish.
If Granger's nagging and condescending attitudes or Weasley's laziness and poor manners didn't alienate them from everyone in school, then their bigotry, their bullying ways and their loud screeching did the trick. The professors were actually counting down the days where they would no longer have to deal with thoses two. Snape had promised himself to get smashing drunk and visit the most high-end brothel in Knockturn Alley to celebrate. Flitwick had swore to take up a sword and enter the Pit (an colleseum-like arena where goblins duelled and settled dispute) to finally release the pent-up fury and anger that stewed and was rotting inside of him. Sprout had declared that she was going to Hawaii as she always had dreamed of; she figured that she had deserved it, just for putting up with the meltdown and tears of her badgers for seven years due to the redhead's constant bullying and never being able to do anything about it. McGonagall... She did not care what people say, what people thought or about anyone else... She was going to retire, period! She had had enough of this! No more!
The answer to her question came in the form of a letter. Taking it from Petunia's trembling hand, Rose began to read and pray that whatever deity in the universe that the Chief Wizard of the Wizengamot and Headmaster of Hogwarts never crossed her path.
Americans viewed Brittish magicals as imbreded, arrogant, ignorant, irrelevant, out of date fools that prided themselves in their own pathetic mediocrity. They hated Albus Dumbledore and his politics, they hated how condescending the Ministry for Magic was, they hated how the old families looked down upon them for being descendants for Muggle-borns, Half-bloods and poor families. that left Britain in the hopes of opportunities, of escaping persecution and of a better life. All knew that Brittish wizards and witches were mercilessly mocked, degrated and spoke to with condescention by the Americans. Regardless of their age, gender or blood-status! No Brittish were spared. So Ilvermorny was out! Brittish students were not very welcomed there.
Now was time to enjoy life.
Eveything was going well for the Boy-Who-Lived, until Alcazar stated that he could not return next year due to his father's monetary problems. Apparently, Ricardo Zabini had not digested the idea of being pranked well and had targeted his opponent's friends as a mean of revenge. Furious and disgusted, Harry sent a Howler to the Zabini shit and challenged him in a duel. If Harry won, then Ricardo had to give him the presidency of the company that Alcazar's father worked for; if Ricardo won, Harry had to marry the other boy's sister and let HER have complete and utter control of all his inheritance. Not stupid, the ravenheaded boy sent letters to his uncles and told them to write new wills to take him out as their heirs should he lose. Just to be on the safe side.
'' attitude, there is war between their houses, muggleborns are insulted and bullied with little to no help at all from the staff and the student's NEWTs results are abysmal compared to any other school in the ICW. Hogwarts may have been the greatest school in the world at one point, but now it is a joke. They rank 11
Ricardo Zabini needed to get Draco Malfoy's hand or he would be disowned by his family. After the humiliation of the Potter incident, as the elders of the family called it, Ricardo's hold on the family was weaker than a newborn babe. There was talk about putting his second cousin, Blaise, at the head of the family and it was something that almost everyone wanted. Ricardo had lost a major financial deal in with the most powerful and important Eastern European potion ingredient company in a bid to black-mail Potter after his little prank at the European Duelling Tournament. Then, he lost the company and a chance to get Ricardo's sister, the ugly Annamaria, into a respectable and profitable mariage with his little duel on the planes of Tuscany. His refusal to honor the deal made cast a reputation of faithlessness and back-stabbing onto the family. If he could bring Draco into the family, the third richest and influencial heir of all of Europe, he could keep his “crown” and get even with Potter once and for all. He would seduce both parents (he was a master at it), then would make himself the official suitor of Draco and have some “alone time” with him. It would be easy then to make sure that the boy obeyed him and married him; pretty and sheltered boys like him didn't have what it took to stand up to someone who had the audacity to physically strike them (Oh, how wrong he was). He would intimidate the boy into marrying him and would then gain complete control of the Malfoy fortune; he would have to get rid of the parents, of course, but that was child's play for him.
See you in a minute.
Draco is here.
Mr. Malfoy,
"It's Hermione."
"Kinky."
"Oh, we were just taking the piss, but you wouldn't know about that, Mr. Serious Straight Man."
"Yes, probably. It's funny though..."
"Insolent slut", Draco said and pulled down his pants. Then he grabbed Harry's hair and rammed into his well-prepared arse. Harry moaned and grabbed the kitchen table. Draco stopped moving until Harry was desperately moaning, hungry for friction. And then he mindlessly pumped into him, everything else a blur. Work didn't matter, nothing mattered, just the in and out and Harry's damaged voice. Draco came to work a bit late, with swollen lips and blushed cheeks. But it didn't really matter because the store was still closed. And that was odd, because his boss was supposed to open today, and he was not usually late. Draco shrugged and got into the shop to make it ready for business.  An owl came in after him and hooted. It gave him a letter.
"How about other girls?"
His reflection looked at him with red-rimmed eyes.
"Yes, Malfoy, oh Merlin, yes!", Potter said and tried to get more friction.
"Of course not."
"I can't stand it when I'm not in control. I didn't let Pansy ride me, ever."
"I think I'm going to leave now", Belial said. And Draco just nodded in silent understanding. Belial didn't know what he had expected, but somehow this was worse than everything else.
Then they tidied up together in silence.
"Ron, would you unclench your arse and put those poor flowers down? You're not doing them any favours by squeezing them like that."
"Wow. Do you use protection?"
"That's not what I meant."
Potter got rid of his robes and unbuttoned his shirt. It looked almost vulnerable, his bare chest in the pale light. When he peeled off his trousers, his cock bounced. Draco had seen his fair share of naked people, the whole Slytherin team had not been shy in the locker room. But in his whole life, he had never seen anyone as naked as Potter. It was obscene, this nakedness. Raw. Draco sat down on his sofa.
"Nonsense."
"I… didn't think it meant so much to you."
"Just don't fuck his friends without asking him, how is that hard?"
"Well, yes, but she's still my ex."
Harry opened the door wordlessly.
"I really should have."
"Well, well, well. Put a stick up my arse and call me a broom. You're dating Ginny Weasley, aren't you?", Draco said, grinning and pointing at her with the spatula.
"Yeah well. Bad idea probably. But if you change your mind, I'll be at the Hog's Head at nine pm."
Potter nodded, his lips slightly opened. His cheeks were flushed and his tangled hair was damp.
"Spoiled brat", Draco said, but it was technically true. Twenty minutes were twenty minutes.
"You might be, Hermione. What happened to Ron?"
I am sorry about how I am updating this, I am having technical difficulties. I'm trying to work on it and hope that I will manage to post whole chapters from now on, not weird edits that stop mid-sentence.
"How can I woo you then, my fair Prince?"
"You fell in love with him and now you're heart broken. Fuck. Draco, I didn't know. I wouldn't have touched him. You know that, right? I'm so fucking sorry,  mate."
"If you think I'll idly stand by while you ruin Draco, I'll show you what a protective Slytherin will do to get back at shitty exes, and I will enjoy every minute of it."
"Debatable, but go ahead."
"Not like that, Hermione. I just... did something wrong to."
"Since he felt used and had feelings for me and I did not feel the same way about him and he is a sane person who notices these things, he stopped seeing me", Draco said with a defeated smile on his face. "Now back to Hermione, please."
"Hi there, ' Mione", he said and yawned.
"Out", Hermione said. And her wand sparked menacingly. Had that been there the whole time?
Best regards,
What were they still writing? Where was Hermione? This was terrible. There was a noise, and then a freshly showered Draco Malfoy entered the room.
"What?", she asked no-one in particular.
"That man is as gay as they come, Malfoy."
"It's just generally distracting me."
"Potter? Potter. Wake up. You're home, you're safe", Draco said and shook Potter's shoulder. There were tears on his face. It was exactly what Draco woke up to every night, but it was scary to see it on someone else. Potter woke up and looked around, disoriented.
"Do you want to bugger me, Malfoy?", Potter asked and his words went straight into him, hot, burning emotions flaring up. Draco could do nothing but nod silently. Potter wordlessly, wandlessly, summoned lube. Draco had never managed to do that, but of course Potter could. Then Potter sat down on the sofa and rubbed lube on his cock. He spread his arse cheeks and rubbed the lube on his hole, moaning lightly. It looked graceful, somehow. Leave it to Potter to look elegant while spreading his arse open for Draco. And, sweet Circe, was he fingering himself? Of course he was, his digits sliding in and out, lube shining on them. Draco pulled his own cock a bit.
Belial looked at Draco and had pity written all over his face.
"Hey, Belial! Are you okay?" Draco asked, his voice suddenly closer to his usual tone, a bit shy. There was still white, sticky liquid in his face. It looked pretty.
"Why are you nice to me?", said his mouth.
"No, she never tortured me or anything."
"What does that have to do with anything?"
"That's the point."
Potter moaned lightly and took off his glasses. Then he took off his robes. Draco helped him and started undressing himself hastily. Potter was pale under his clothes, but there was hair on his abdomen, a trail to his cock, that was slightly shorter but thicker than Draco's own.
He had started with Dudley. The favourite, the one Petunia had doted on. He made them watch, silenced and tied down by spells. And then he had crucioed him with the wand that he had nicked from the last raid.
"I don't know why I said that, I don't even know if it's true", he murmured. Now why had he said that? What was it about Potter that made him blurt out any unfinished thoughts that came to his mind whenever he was there? It was a disgrace.
"Me. What does it look like, honestly?"
When Hermione looked into Ginny's eyes, they had a slightly dazed expression. She bit her lip and whimpered lowly. It was interesting to Hermione, what that expression did to her. With Ron, she had been a bit more submissive, careful to not hurt his fragile ego. It backfired most of the time, but whenever she was a bit more self-confident, Ron would whine about her being bossy. With Ginny, she didn't feel like toning it down in the slightest. But Ginny was just as dominant as her, which, the last time, had ended in a delightful play-fight. There was biting and scratching and even some choking involved. After putting up a good fight, eventually Ginny melted into Hermione's pulling and pushing, still clawing at her back, but mewling in a desperately horny, slightly defeated way. When she had started to kiss her way down to Hermione's wet cunt, Hermione realised that she had not been on the receiving end of oral sex since she had dated Viktor back in fifth year. And oh, had she missed it. But that wasn't the only reason she screamed like a Banshee on fire. It was just so right- Ginny felt right. Her tongue was so smooth, her sucking so devoted- the enthusiasm with which she moaned into her and burried her head between her legs.
He stood there, petrified.
"No, I will not, and I am trying very hard right now to even make a show of compassion for that liar, but I'm very shocked that you did it. I guess someone had to, but still. Do you need help? Have you gotten rid of the body? Can I do anything?"
"Bitch", he uttered under his breath.
"Yeah, good luck with that."
His mind was the first to break. He had collapsed so easily, he was so weak.
"Will you arrest me?"
Belial looked ready to strangle him through the floo, so Harry just aguamenti'd the fireplace. Nott was right of course. Harry knew he was being an absolute dipshit. But if Draco expected him to play the doting boyfriend for him, just because he was being a good lay, and cute, and had scrunched his nose in an adorable way when he was thinking, and snogged him into pillows and made his nightmares better and was absolutely ridiculously perfect for him, he was so wrong.
Hermione smirked. "Look, Ginny. I know who you are and I've known for a while. We talked about all the first date stuff already anyway. And as much as I enjoy our talks, I have to admit that there are other wonderful things that I would enjoy doing with you that include less talking and a few notice-me-not-charms and muffliatos", she said and pinched Ginny's thigh. Hermione looked at the short hair above Ginny's left ear and remembered longingly how good it felt against her skin. The last time she couldn't help but stroke it while Ginny was driving her mad with that wicked tongue of hers.
"I thought that it was my idea, to be honest."
Contains a description of a dissociative episode.
"Do you want to see one?"
"Malfoy!", he screamed, a one-word-sentence, a whole poem of faked devotion. And Draco gave him more slaps, loud and hard and awful, filled with longing disappointment. And Potter just moaned and rubbed his hard cock on Draco, took it all. His buttocks had purple hand-marks on them. Draco spread him open and spat on the dark pucker. It elicited an other moan, an other horny wiggle. He slid his fingers in without a lubrication spell, slowly, determined to make him beg for Draco's cock. Potter whimpered.
"No. And I wouldn't have told you if you weren't kind of in the same boat."
"Hi Malfoy."
"Good."
Draco thought about it. For the first time. Of course muggles raped and killed and robbed each other, just like wizards did. Somehow they had always seemed too weak to do it. The muggles Draco had seen at the gatherings were mostly just screaming and begging for their lifes.
"Yes. She was my first. And she petrified me."
This is a femslash chapter.
"Would you put them on for me?"
Harry and Malfoy looked at Hermione, checking on her. But she stood tall.
"Oh, this is a very bony clavicula. And this is a nice, pale chest. And I think I see a pink nipple. I will taste it now", Potter whispered against Draco's skin. Then he started to swirl his tongue around a nipple, which left Draco temporarily breathless. He ran his hand through Potter's hair again, moaning as the man lightly bit his sensitive flesh. When he couldn't take the teasing anymore, he pushed his head down lower.
"Malfoy. Just to make myself clear. I came here because I wanted to date you. I asked you out because I want to shag you senseless and if you think that's too forward, please tell me so", Potter said confidently.
Draco stroke a stray hair out of his face in a very Malfoy-like gesture. So either the real Draco or a very good impersonator, then. Maybe he just behaved differently towards him because of his going with Potter.
"Ron said that I brought us into this situation and I should do what he says."
But I wanna!
"I don't know."
"No, he's not. He's all big and muscular and such."
Draco didn't respond.
"I just might."
"That's cold."
Just an hour later, his owl came back with a note.
"See you around, Potter", Potter replied.
Of course, Potter was already there, sipping on a drink at the bar on his own. And it would've been rude to just leave him there all by his lonesome.
"Wow, Hermione. Are you deliberately dressing like that to drive me crazy?", Ginny muttered. Hermione blushed. Because, yes, she was deliberately dressing like that to drive her crazy. And it wasn't especially hard to dress like that. Ginny had told her about having a thing for the stereotypical library-lesbian-look and well, that was basically all of Hermione's wardrobe anyway. The things that Ron liked to see her in were the exception to that rule and she always felt a bit as if she were playing dress-up in those. So, if she wanted to look her absolute best for Ginny, which she absolutely did, she just put on her favourite clothes and felt sexy in them. Never underestimate the power of attitude. And nice short fingernails. Instead of answering, she just smiled. "Wow, you fucking tease, you absolutely know! I'm shocked!", Ginny lamented in mock terror. Hermione grinned. "I'm also wearing a very conservative skirt that is riding up under the table", she said and squeezed Ginny's knee.
Petunia, Vernon and Dudley were in different facilities but they had all lost the ability to do anything but very basic tasks.
Potter's hands on him. He stopped trying to grasp the concept of it. He closed his eyes. Potter was standing so close that Draco could feel his body heat radiating off him. The other man pulled him closer by the hip. Draco touched Potter's back and rubbed up and down. It felt firm under the fabric of his robe. Draco opened his eyes again. And Potter's face was so, so close.
Ron felt very insulted when Harry pulled out a parchment, spelled to transfer messages. Harry scribbled something on it. Ron looked at it, but it looked like gibberish. Probably spelled to only make sense to the person it was intended to be for.
This chapter contains porn and some mixed feelings. If you wondered about why I'd put slow-burn on this, it's because the relationship part of this is still far, far away.
"Usually?!"
It hurt. It shouldn't but it did. Why did people think he was such a stone-cold bugger? Well, usually they were right, but Draco had always seemed different somehow. Safe. Maybe because he wasn't flirtatious and didn't have many friends, it had always felt profound, an honour that he decided to spend time with Belial. It made him feel like he had an inkling of what was going on behind the facade.
He walked over, slowly and elegantly, like it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. And maybe it wasn't. Maybe Potter did things like this all the time, a different man for any day of the week. Potter wiggled a bit and Draco felt his own cock getting hard again. Those round buttocks, he saw the fuzz on them. He cupped Potter's bum and jiggled it a bit, just because he could. And then he smacked him so hard that his hand started hurting. Potter helped and dug his fingers into the arm-rest.
Draco still stood there without moving, staring at the spot where Potter had been.
Oh. Well that is one unwelcome surprise. I'll handle this myself. Don't bother with the kicking, I'm perfectly able to hex him on my own.
"Well I like it when you call me Potter. Does something to me. Whatever. So. You fucked Belial. Good for you. Yes, good. You. Uh. Was that a one time thing?", Harry asked without looking at Draco.
It worked. She hadn't been a hundred percent sure,  he could've changed the wards after all this time of fake fighting from her side. She wondered if he just didn't bother or if he kept her in the wards for old time's sake.
"Well, I bet you had to beat Nott off with a stick."
Hermione had given him a lop-sided grin and a hug. "Good, Harry. I'm glad you know that about yourself now."
"Spoilsport", Ginny muttered. "What did I do?", Hermione said, genuinly puzzled. "Oh, it just brought me back to when we were still at Hogwarts and Harry was clumsy and spilled that juice all over you... Ok you probably do not remember that as vividly as I do." Hermione arched her eyebrows. "Weren't you with Harry back then?" Ginny chuckled. "First of all, I was a horny teenager and second of all, Harry is gay and I was already very much bi back then", Ginny said. "And that face you made... and you were clearly not wearing a bra." Hermione gave Ginny a wicked smile. "I rarely do. And if so, more for, well. Embellishment. Not for practical reasons. Not with those wee tits", she said and shook her upper body playfully. There was not a lot of jiggling. Ginny still made a little choked noise. "On second thought I still feel like a horny teenager sometimes", she whispered.
She took a look around. His flat hadn't changed much, it still was impersonal and cold. But it wasn't as cold as it used to, and there were a few touches that made it look as if someone was actually living here.
"Can I come in? Maybe wait for her? Catch up?"
"It's not a date. I'm not into blokes. Why does everyone think that?", Draco said absentmindedly. Harry looked away. "Oh", he said with something in his voice that sounded an awful lot like disappointment, which made no sense at all.
"Fuck you, Potter."
"I might."
"But Draco! Why would you do that?", Harry asked with a decidedly whiny undertone.
Potter sat on his knees and waited. Draco came closer, stroked the damp hair out of his face and put the glasses on him. He lunged toward and pinned Potter to the bed, kissing him. Potter laughed, out of breath, and tried to wrestle out of Draco's hold.
He apparated to work. He opened up the shop in the morning and closed it in the evening,  because he had no social life at the ripe old age of twenty-three.
"Well I'm not. I mean. Yes I am adult but I'm not over you", Draco said in this weird voice that belonged to his autopilot. And what about that awful phrasing?
"You won't be in trouble. Your boss, maybe. But not you."
"I take it that Hermione has told you what happened between us?"
"How can you not know that?"
"Hi Malfoy. Let's skip the drink and go to mine, yeah? And how about tonight, I really want to see your pointy face again. I'll pick you up after work if you don't protest immediately."
"Scoot, scoot, Granger. Go get her", Draco said and winked at her. Hermione groaned and hurried out.
"You're a really nice otter",  Nott said and winked at Potter before apparating away.
"I kind of dated Malfoy's best friend. Wait, what did you do?",Harry explained and then turned to Draco furiously.
"Oh. I think I'll just get going, then", he said and entered the room. He was in pyjamas, which meant he was more likely a boyfriend than a hook-up, and he was also Draco Malfoy.
He had watched Dudley scream and it hadn't felt as good as it should have, because Dudley had also been a victim somehow. But he had still helped his parents beat him and imprison him and hadn't helped him when he was reduced to a broken, sobbing puddle of blood and broken bones on the floor.
"So, how have you been?", he asked, awkwardly cheery.
"Oh, definitely. I've seen one on a big screen once."
Harry behaves like an arsehole and Draco has a major meltdown.
"You didn't tell Draco shit about us. And I asked him about his feelings and he is absolutely devasted."
"Of course you're not Potter. I am Potter, you're Nott, or are you not Nott?"
"I killed the Dursleys."
"Sure, love", Potter said and smiled at him with tjose bright-green eyes in full attack mode. It hurt  to look at him. Draco felt something close to a hunger pang. When Potter came out of the floo and brushed his clothes off, Draco tried to look at anything but his eyes.
"Sure. I will." Draco apparated home and cried into his pillow. He cried until his mouth went dry and he felt hung over and defeated. And then he pulled the blanket over his head and stayed like this. He couldn't move at all. For the first time since he had met Potter at the raid, he was petrified again.
"Hey Potter, how are you doing? Fancy getting a drink Saturday night?, Draco" Or "Hello, Potter, would you like to go out for a drink Saturday evening? Malfoy" He wrote and rewrote until his owl started to hoot impatiently and tapped it's talons on the window. He gave up and picked one letter at random.
Saint Potter, the whore, the slut, the succubus. He swallowed it all, looking as if it tasted like butterbeer instead of glue.
He came in through the fireplace. Draco grewted him with an unusually warm hug. Draco's apartment was decorated with candles, and it looked less frugal than Belial would've imagined it. There was a decanter with blue fairy wine, and some elegant wine goblets next to it. Draco smiled at him and made intense eye contact. Which was not normally his style. Maybe he wanted to work around the awkwardness? It was strange how attractive he looked in the dim candle light. He was as blond and slender as ever, everybody's type, probably. But Belial had always had looked at him in a brotherly way. Well, not solely in a brotherly way. But noticing his twinkish qualities under the influence of alcohol was only natural. But now it was somehow more obvious. The cat-like elegance. The hip-bones, visible under the rather tight muggle shirt he was wearing.
Hermione,relieved to not be the target of Harry's fury anymore, relaxed a bit.
Ginny ordered a coffee in a somewhat strained voice, because Hermione was still kneading her leg under the table. "A pumpkin spice latte for me, please", Hermione said. The waiter took the order and stumbled back to the kitchen, holding his notebook in front of his crotch discreetly.
He blushed. Draco took out his wand and levitated the chair to it's corner.
"Yes, I like it. A lot. Do you want me to lick you clean?", Potter asked with a lingering voice.
"Try me."
More porn, but also talk of child sexual abuse, nightmares, alcoholic parents, more internalized victim-blaming and weird coping.
"Harry. You sure are one hell of a friend. It was years ago. That's why Ron and I thought it would be better not to be associated with you."
After they were done trashing the place, they left again. But Potter didn't. Why? Why didn't he leave? He just stood there, pretending to clean his glasses.
"I cast protective spells on both of us before we even got here, Malfoy. I'm surprised you didn't."
"Nott isn't gay, come on", Draco huffed. Harry just looked at him incredulously.
"Not like me, you didn't."
"It's not?", Potter asked, smiling at him. Draco's heart skipped a beat. Potter was joking, of course. He was messing with him, laughing about his flushed cheeks and flustered fidgeting.
"Hermione, why did you hide? Has someone found out?"
"I didn't mean it like that", he managed to say.
"I don't know. For hurting our friendship?"
Narcissa was never the mad, cackling one. She was the one who made sure her son always had the best of the best, the most expensive brooms and the most expensive taste, and Narcissa loved him the Black way. Family first, blood is thicker than water. And the centuries of twisted minds in the Back family culminated into a kind of love that either made you into a perfectly trained puppet or bruised and bit and raped teenage boys. Though Draco was still not sure it qualified as rape, because aunt Bella hadn't made him have an erection. And she had told him she was doing him a favour. In her own twisted mind she probably was, since she didn't crucio him or anything of that sorts. She just gently finished herself on top of him and un-froze him so that he would finish. Which he did. And that was ultimate proof that part of him must have wanted it in the first place. In his sleep, Bella was still riding him whenever he had an erection, kissing away his silent tears.
"Oh."
"Well clean up then, you incredibly arrogant tosser!", Draco screeched. Oh no. Where had that emotion come from? What had happened to the pleasent numbness? Why were there so many feelings, why did it burn, why did it hurt? Draco felt his eyes getting hot. What was that? He wasn't going to cry, was he? He hadn't cried in years. Not since his mother had died.
"All done. See you tomorrow", he said and rudely apparated without waiting for Draco to reply.
"Harry. I need to tell you something important."
"Bella didn't rape me. Not really. I. You know. Orgasmed."
"Hi, Potter. Would you like to come over here?"
Draco came in with some fresh buns and eggs.
Belial Nott, Theodor's elder brother, had been a somewhat good acquaintance over the last two years and they occasionally drank some firewhiskey together. They had met when Belial had bought some spying fancy noodles from him, a thing that was usually added to gift baskets. It worked as long as they weren't cooked and eaten, which was usually infinitely. Because they were technically not a spying device but a perfectly edible food,  they weren't outlawed by the ministry.
He knew how to reject an invitation politely,  he knew a dozen ways to do it, but somehow his mind went blank.
"I didn't know you were meeting someone here. Am I crashing a date or something? You could've just told me you know", he said and raised his brows.
