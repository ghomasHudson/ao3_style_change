‘Yes, please, Harry,’ Millie confirmed, placing the other outfits on a chair in the corner of the room.
‘Good.’ Draco could hear the smile in Harry’s voice, and he felt a similar one creep across his own face.
‘Good, good,’ Malfoy mused as he walked back into the room. He came to a stop in front of Harry and pulled out his wand, casting a spell over Harry which he recognised as one of their diagnostic spells when lights appeared all over his skin, thin threads of colour that gathered at his chest.
‘Okay,’ Harry said slowly, thinking. At first, he’d talked about his nightmares, too. Ron and Hermione had sat with him through many nights, holding him as he shook and told them haltingly what he’d dreamed about. But then, as the nightmares had gradually reduced in frequency, he’d found ways to cope on his own. He’d pace, or listen to the wireless to try and distract himself, or simply get up, condemning himself to a day of yawning and weariness with the hope that at least he’d be too tired to have a nightmare the following night. He’d got used to coping that way, but maybe he could try talking again.
Draco breathes out on a heavy laugh. “Not interested in a game of I, Spy, then?” His  voice is muffled, his gloved fingers covering half of his mouth. Harry tilts his head up to watch him better. Draco’s gaze is still focused on the landscape, or lack thereof, before them. Harry lets his eyes wander, up past Draco’s head, to the top of the hideout, before he follows Draco’s line of sight.
His grades are better than they’ve ever been, at least, with all the free time Draco has. Turns out being a social pariah is excellent for one’s academic pursuits. Who would have though it? His father would be proud of him for studying so hard, if his father gave a toss about anything these days other than trying to restoring the family’s obliterated reputation. It’s never going to happen, and Draco doesn’t care much for it anymore. His name is dirt, far filthier than any impure blood Draco was raised to loathe. Draco’s world has been tilted on its axis and he doesn’t know if it will ever feel right again, but he is certain at least that being a Malfoy means nothing and blood purity means even less.
It’s down a flight of stairs, then a left towards the river, and Draco’s almost there. The building used to be a house, he thinks, something small and rundown. As a bar, it’s been around since the '80s, a little safe-haven for the undead and the unholy, those who aren’t especially popular amongst the wizarding and Muggle communities alike. Werewolves, Succubi, bloodsuckers like Draco, and all manner of other beings that Draco never knew existed: the Baubai and Strigoi, the Wendigo and fae Changelings. It’s amazing how small his world had been, growing up the privileged only son of rich, pure-blood high-society flyers. All his fear was displaced towards Muggles and the threat they supposedly posed, when there were so many other things that wanted to take a bite of him.
He felt stupid, he thought. Stupid, and huge, and turned on. He suddenly missed his old body, as he listened to Draco stir, or at least Harry missed what his body used to do. It had been far less unpredictable; other than the odd bout of food poisoning, some achy joints, a few weird reactions to cheese, Harry felt like his body had become pretty reliable since Hogwarts. At the moment he felt like he didn’t know what his body was going to throw at him next.
It all feels so normal, deceptively usual, and Harry feels wrong-footed by it. Even more so than he already was. "You’re here," Harry repeats.
Potter rucks up Draco's top slightly, then kisses him low on his stomach. His hair tickles at Draco's belly as he nods, belatedly agreeing with Draco's statement as if dropping to the floor wasn't a clear enough statement of intentions. "I want to do this," he states breathlessly, fingers at the fly of Draco's jeans. "Good?"
“Up,” Draco mumbled again, and Harry inched further forwards on his knees, cock bobbing as he gripped the headboard. His gasp was embarrassingly loud when Draco pulled him down to sit fully on his face.
Draco twists his mouth, then stands away from the wall, straightening up to his full height. Now, they’re almost eye to eye, Draco’s inch or so of extra height giving him only a small advantage. Harry feels a shiver run through him all the same.
Potter's frown is equal parts confused and sleepy. "Berlin?" He clears his throat. "I've never been, to be honest. Why?"
And at worst, it’ll chew up all his indoor plants and throw up on his bed in the morning, and then Harry’ll have the inspiration for a sequel.
"Oh, fucking hell," he mutters, head cradled in one hand as he sits on the sofa, holding his phone in the other.
Draco finds himself genuinely shocked to uncover this. He knows where she is, now, and what she does. He has a vague idea what she looks like, which is all immensely valuable information to be able to pass on to his client. To pass on to
Draco sniffed, that small smile still dancing around his lips as he looked at Harry from underneath his pale fringe. He straightened, then Summoned both potions, handing one to Harry.
He stretches out, blinking his eyes open slowly. The blankets are a warm cocoon around him, and the temptation to let himself go back to sleep is strong. Before he can slip off again, the bed dips beside him. A warm hand lands at his shoulder, surprising Harry enough to make him somewhat alert. He rolls over onto his back. Draco’s hand is dislodged by the motion.
"Quit what?" she asks innocently, stirring her tea and letting the spoon chink against the glass. Harry narrows his eyes.
It's clear that's what he's doing. In the booth Draco occupied the night before, Potter is sat with a pint of glistening lager perched atop a plain black coaster. He doesn’t look up when Draco enters but his posture is tense. He’s aware of the room, of what’s going on around him. It’s busy in here tonight, for a Wednesday. Draco would bet that Potter knows Draco’s arrived, that he clocked it the second Draco walked in. Potter’s always been far more astute about his surroundings than he’s appeared.
He’ll never understand what it was that made the one who bit him want to turn him, either. They barely talked. A shared drink under dim club lights, cigarette smoke and alcohol fumes and teenage angst fogging Draco's senses. They stumbled outside, and Draco felt giddy with rebellion, and heartsick too, and just a little bit regular sick from that last tequila sunrise. There was so much kissing, and it was brilliant, and then.
“Shit, let me sort you ―” Draco tried to move his hand between them to grip Harry’s prick, but Harry stopped him, pulling Draco’s hand to land on the bed beside his head. Harry was
“Please,” Harry says, feeling exhausted from the barrage of information, the late hour, and the strange flip flop of emotions tumbling around inside him. He’s never been so giggly and so cranky at the same time before.
Draco’s quiet for a moment, and when Harry looks up he finds he's watching him, eyes narrowed and expression hawkish. “And let me repeat myself, Harry,” Draco starts, his voice low. “I can think of worse things to wake up to.” He leans forward to pick up his own tea cup. Harry stares at the shadows of his collarbone.
Draco's finished jotting down his notes and sipping on his tea when Potter stirs. His hair is a riot, having been slightly damp when he went to sleep, and there are pillow creases on his cheeks. He rubs at his eyes and then reaches for his glasses on the side table. He looks around the room, seeming vaguely surprised to take in his surroundings, and for the briefest moment Draco wonders if Potter will regret this. Regret talking to Draco about such personal things, regret sleeping with him, regret all of it. It's a horrifying thought, and thankfully one that dissipates as Potter looks at Draco and smiles. Draco smiles back, relieved and pleased. He twirls the feather quill in his fingers, the nib resting against his paper pad. It leaves an ink smudge there, but it's no matter.
“Ah!” Harry’s lips lifted into a grimace, twisting in pleasure he screwed his eyes shut, his hand flying over his leaking cock. His balls were tight, his thighs burning as he rocked back and forth, Draco’s tongue pressing in deeper, driving him wild.
"Oh," Harry says out loud. He's…still pretty shocked, but also quite underwhelmed. It's a really boring answer, and also one that totally makes sense.
Draco sighs, tapping long fingers against the bar counter in front of him. His gin and soda water sits barely touched, ice cubes sweating. Every now and again he can hear them clink as they melt, shifting around in the glass. It's an annoyingly posh glass, even by Draco's standards, and he was raised on blown Venetian crystal. There's a sprig of rosemary in there too, nestled in with a sad sphere of sliced cucumber. Draco wants to petulantly lob it across the room at the couple sat in a booth nearby, so clearly having a lovely evening. So clearly
Draco pauses, having just slipped his fingers under the hem. His hair is tousled, a damp mess across his sweaty forehead. His cheeks are flushed, the pupils of his grey eyes blown large, almost eclipsing the irises. He's never looked more desirable to Harry, his chest heaving and his brow furrowed in confusion, and yet none of these feelings are new to Harry. He's old friends with this want, had it for company for a while now. He's suddenly desperate to know how it is for Draco, too. If this all he'll get, one night of experimentation for Draco, perhaps, of toying with the way the bond makes them feel, then Harry will take it. He'll take it with both hands, and treasure it. But he knows what he would prefer.
He completely avoids talking about The Dreaded Drunk Text, or the fact Draco still hasn’t replied, and he isn’t sure if Aggie takes mercy on him and lets him get away with avoiding it because he looks so terrible, or if she’s too preoccupied with one of her biggest clients dropping a stonking change of plans on her lap right before deadline. Given the way their relationship works, it honestly could be both.
Harry struggles up onto his elbows so he can look down at Draco's face. The apples of Draco’s cheeks are pink as ever, framed by Harry's thighs. Harry reaches out and runs his hand through Draco's hair, down his cheek. It's soppy, and ridiculous, the way Harry feels right now. He grins down at Draco, his smile lopsided and sex-drunk, then shrugs as best he can while leaning back on one elbow and with one leg pretezelled up against the bed. He must look like a complete knob.
“Yeah.” Draco ran his clean hand over his mouth, then Summoned his wand, cleaning the both of them up. “That was great,” Draco mumbled, voice thick as he curled closer. He kissed the top of Harry’s spine, then his nape. Harry breathed a laugh, turning onto his side and letting Draco take up the space behind him.
Draco chuckles, breathless as he keeps his pace and ruts down against Potter as if he were fucking him for real. Draco wants to, but not right now. Right now he wants nothing more than this, getting off in his bed like desperate teenagers.
“Do it,” Harry repeated, “I want you to, to ―” Harry pressed his lips together, trying to curb the stream of filthy nonsense that wanted to fall out of his mouth. He felt ‘
Draco stares at the figure in the room, just a dark shape in the already dark night, and wonders what it is, what it wants. If it
Harry thinks it looks like it fades to an icy blue in places, a lilac, even orange hues mixed in there. It illuminates the landscape, a prism of otherworldly colour as it streaks across the sky. The light fragments across the dewy grass and sparse shrubs, a kaleidoscope of abstract colours. He can’t pull his eyes away.
Besides, it doesn’t seem urgent. The figure has moved closer to him each day, and Draco still recognises it as humanoid in form. It seems like it’s made of shadows, or just of something that isn’t quite there. Like it occupies the spaces where nothing else exists, fills what hollows it can find. His eyes struggle to make it out, but he knows it’s there, and he knows it’s getting closer. It seems drawn to him, whatever it is, as he lies motionless in his bed. It’s featureless, except for eyes that catch the light, and shadowy fingers that touch the edge of Draco’s bed, that crease the sheets as it clenches them in a barely-there fist. It doesn’t feel threatening, but perhaps that’s just a lack of self-preservation on Draco’s part. It’s certainly unsettling, and it’s certainly no ordinary dream. This is something that isn’t coming from Draco's mind.
He can tell it's not going to take long, the stress of the evening making him ache for a quick release, the thrill of an orgasm. The familiar scent is maddening to him, getting under his skin and intensifying every stroke of his hand, every time his thumb bumps against the plummy head of his cock and his toes curl against the water-warmed shower tiles beneath his feet. He feels his breathing grow off kilter, sensation skittering up his spine as the pleasure seems to reverberate through him, ecchoing off the walls of the shower stall and back under his overheated skin. He shuts his eyes, throat working around a soundless gasp and groan as his balls tighten and his cock twitches in his hand.
Across the table, something flashes in Draco’s eyes. Harry feels a brief flash of emotion skitter along his spine in its wake. “I assure you, I will, thank you,” he says, his voice is soft and low, his eyes dark. “You’ll be sure to do the same for me, won’t you, Harry?” Draco runs his finger around the edge of his teacup. It comes away wet. “You’ll let me know, should you...
Draco’s right. It’s past noon, and Harry’s still in his PJs. Which means he’s in his pants and some ratty socks and a vest with a hole over one nipple that Harry’s had since he was fourteen and which was once white but is now a sort of off-putting grey-beige colour. Greige. He should really throw it out, but there’s a pineapple on the front riding a skateboard, and Harry’s fond of it. He should also try and write something today, Harry
He tries to focus on the fact that at least he's self-aware about being a fucking moron as he steps back into the welcoming, seedy gloom of The Opal Cauldron the very next night.
“And second, your parents have been married now for thirty years, so I think someone needs to revisit that math.”
Or really, another slow and uninterrupted wank would do it. Harry feels his cheeks growing warm at the memory of this morning, and the conversation that ensued. He runs a hand over the back of his neck, as if he can scrub the heat away. He feels a little unsteady with it, overheated as warmth pools quickly in his belly, creeps down his thighs.
She was right, on both counts. Astoria didn’t come back from France, and Draco was ill in the bathroom at Miss Eventide’s, and then again after Harry Apparated them both to Draco’s house, and then
Harry makes an unhappy face. His reflection in the mirror makes it right back at him. God, he looks awful, bags under his eyes and his hair sticking up on the side he’s slept on, like the wing of some bedraggled, dying bird. He’s been sleeping loads lately, so he’s not sure he has any right to look so crap. But then again,
They walk up to the bar, waiting for the sole barman to amble their way. He's serving a blonde woman with elaborately coiffed hair, and her companion, whose almond-shaped eyes seem to be surveying the room with as much distaste as Draco is. Thank Merlin he's not the only one who doesn't enjoy being smothered in perfume and seventies furniture.
He looks at his ginger cat, curled in her basket and half asleep. "How about 'Martha'?" he asks, voice soft. "Can't keep just calling you 'Cat', can I?"
for it, like he’s done this a hundred times and is grateful to be doing it again. His hands grip at Draco’s hips as he swallows him down enthusiastically, bobbing his head in increasing fast movements. He doesn’t take Draco down fully, but it’s close, and it’s
Okay, that's a lie. He's in a booth and almost finished his elderflower martini when Draco sees him, but in his defense, Potter was wearing a fucking ugly motorbike helmet when he first strolled through the door.
“I’m getting some, ah,” Draco laughed, a breathless huff of air that Harry felt over his face as he dropped his hand back to the bed again. “Some very mixed messages here.”
Draco wasn’t following Harry out to the greenhouses at night, but Harry might have been following him.
Draco cringes, cheeks flushing again. "Oh god, yes, sorry, I’m being incredibly impertinent. I just, I got here a while ago and"—Draco’s hair falls over his ears and into his face as he gesticulates while he talks—"sort of took over your house, I guess." He makes a face at himself.
“Right. Um.” Harry sincerely hopes his face doesn’t look as hot as he currently feels. “Is that...everything then?”
"Excited?" Draco asks, as he motions towards the door. There’s a heavyset bouncer standing to the left, but there’s no queue. The man doesn’t look like he’s even bothering with IDs. His sole purpose appears to be to loom confrontationally and deter away any people who aren’t deliberately seeking this particular establishment out. Draco feels his mouth twist in distaste. This whole place is already giving him the heebie jeebies. It’s one thing to be a Dark creature. It’s something else entirely to be
It’s powerfully exciting. More than ever, he wants to help. He wants to solve this for Potter, just as he wanted to help as soon as he learned Potter was searching for something. It feels good to have a purpose.
“She does looks lovely,” Draco agrees. “She’s an angel. And yes she has.” He lets the dog down on all four legs, where she rushes around his calves, sniffing him all over. Satisfied, she trots over to her day bed and flops down, happily watching them. “She’s not had as much lopped off as you, mind.”
Agatha slowly looks at the ginger cat sitting on Harry’s window sill, then back to Harry. He’s still in his pants. Not the same ones as yesterday, at least, but these ones are infinitely uglier. He looks like he’s losing the plot, which in the literary sense (ha!) he has actually lost. Agatha seems to agree with Harry’s self assessment. She sighs the deeply resigned sigh of all those who have had to deal with Harry while trying to write his third novel and shuffles past him, her scarf trailing limply over one shoulder.
Draco’s quiet for a long moment while he gathers his thoughts. There’s so much to take in, to unpack here, that he feels almost numbed by it. None of this makes sense in regards to what he previously understood as possible. He focuses on the words being exchanged at hand, and not on the broader questions building inside him.
“Well.” Draco presses his hands to the arms of the chair palm down, then flexes his fingers. He lets them settle around the shape of the wood. “We’ll stay at mine. It’s closer, and I’ve got Nettle to look after.” He looks up at Harry, the expression in his grey eyes both hard and tired at once. “Alright, Potter?”
Harry snorts a laugh. "There really isn’t much to talk about. But by all means"—he gestures at the nearly empty jug—"ply away." He sighs at Ginny’s unimpressed look, then shrugs. "There really isn’t. I’ve written nothing, I’ve got a meeting with Aggie in two days to finally admit I’ve got nothing and beg for more time, and in the meantime, I’ve maybe got a thing for Malfoy but he’s in a different country and we never see each other in person these days so fuck knows if it’s, like, mutual, and anyway I’m not going to bring it up and make things weird, so." Harry shrugs again, face red and heart a bit sore. He takes a swig of his drink, polishing it off. "Like I said, nothing much to talk about," he finishes lamely.
His own cock hard and aching in his trousers, Draco leans forward, towards the unmistakable line of Potter’s cock. He takes his time, giving Potter a chance to tell him to stop, but then Potter’s hand comes to tangle in Draco’s hair and his hips shift forwards slightly, bringing his cock closer to Draco’s mouth.
As Malfoy walked away to cast his Patronus, Harry stood up gingerly, relieved to find his legs weren’t too shaky, and began to cast Stasis charms over the rest of the objects in the room. They’d have to come back another day to finish off, and deal with that jewellery box too. Everything was fine, until Malfoy stepped through the bedroom door onto the landing.
Malfoy was beautiful, all long limbs, a scattering of blond hair over his lightly muscled chest. Seeing everything he’d been dreaming of for so long lit a fire within Harry, and he couldn’t wait any longer. Malfoy seemed just as desperate as Harry as they fell onto the bed in a tangle of limbs, his hands all over Harry’s chest and back, his body pressing Harry’s against the bedsheets. Harry had never experienced the feeling of Malfoy’s weight on top of him, and he revelled in it, in the way their bodies lined up as their hips began to move together, the drag of Malfoy’s cock against his incredible, pleasure already building after so long without this feeling.
‘Oh, sorry.’ Harry had the grace to look contrite, as though he had suddenly realised that it was in fact quite late. ‘I’ll go then.’
‘I think whatever curse was on that jewellery box did more to us than we first thought,’ Malfoy said, his voice grim, his face set. ‘I want to examine it, will you be all right for a moment?’
‘I don’t know,’ Draco mumbled, head still firmly in his hands. ‘I suppose I’ll have to - if I don’t everyone will know why, and I won’t have anyone thinking I’m too cowardly to face my ex.’
‘I didn’t either. I didn’t know if you’d want to see me. At least I know now why you’ve been avoiding me for the past few months.’
‘All right,’ Malfoy nodded, ‘dinner then. Friday? Work pub nights have rather lost their appeal over the past few weeks,’ he added with a wry smile.
‘We don’t think so—reports from neighbours suggest that she was having memory problems, that a lot of the time she couldn’t keep track of things, so we presume the daughter thought she could sneak things into the house and her mother would never notice them.’ Malfoy’s tone was harsh, his words dripping with disdain for the daughter’s actions, and Harry hated how much that pleased him.
A small influx of customers kept Draco busy for the next twenty minutes or so, and he barely had time to process the fact that Harry Potter, his childhood enemy and not-so-former crush, was currently sat in his cafe, drinking a ridiculous hot chocolate confection, and seemingly deeply absorbed in an apparently Muggle novel. It was a scenario he had never even been able to contemplate before, it seemed so out of the realms of possibility, but it was apparently happening, and his brain did not know how to deal with that fact.
‘What if I want to tease you?’ There’s a laugh in Potter’s voice, and part of Draco thrills at hearing it, knowing that he’s the one causing it. It’s not something he ever thought he’d be able to do.
‘Eventually, yes. I know it might sound silly to you, but I was nervous, at first, to mingle in Muggle society. I had no idea how to act, what to say, how not to give myself away. And there was a part of me that wondered if my father hadn’t been right about us having something to fear from them—he’d told me about the weapons they use, how destructive they can be, how they wouldn’t hesitate to use them against us. I know now that that was all nonsense, of course,’ Malfoy said, when Harry opened his mouth to rebut the idea. ‘But you can understand how I would be wary, having grown up hearing that.’
‘Can I—’ Harry starts, then hesitates briefly. The look in his eyes is almost too much for Draco to bear, but Draco waits, desperate to hear what Harry wants to say.
‘Ok,’ Draco replies, stretching his sore limbs and standing up. He feels better once he’s standing, less vulnerable than when Potter was looming over him.
Settling back down on the sofa, accidentally slightly closer to Harry than he had been before, Draco poured two generous measures of whiskey, clinking glasses with Harry before taking a sip, the drink burning and warming his chest.
Potter doesn’t respond. Instead, he grips Draco tightly by the hips and pulls him back to meet his mouth, just rough enough. And then he’s devouring Draco. It’s the only way to describe how Potter goes at him, licking and sucking until Draco is swearing and nearly shaking with the need to come. He’s damn good at this, and Draco spares a moment to wonder just how Potter got so good—surely not with other whores?—before Potter’s skilled tongue has him reduced to just sensation.
Every time he sees that Potter’s booked an appointment, excitement flutters in his stomach as he wonders what the night will have in store for them. Potter’s far more adventurous than Draco had expected, and weeks fly by in a blur of blindfolds, hands tied to bedposts, and more mind-blowing orgasms than Draco can count.
‘It doesn’t feel like enough, most days,’ Malfoy replied. He looked down at his lap, twisting his fingers together. ‘I—I don’t know how to make up for what I did, what I was part of.’
‘I—’ Harry briefly considered lying, pretending that it was a one-time thing, that he’d never touched Malfoy other than the incident she’d stumbled upon tonight, but he couldn’t. She deserved so much—a better husband, for a start—that the truth was the least he could give her.
‘Right, well I’ll leave you all to it,’ Harry continued, heaving himself off the sofa with a grunt. ‘Enjoy your lesson, Ted, and I’ll see you next week.’ With a quick ruffle of Teddy’s bright blue hair and a hug for Andromeda, Harry was gone, leaving Draco behind to try and get his thoughts away from Harry and back onto the dull topic of inheritance.
Draco nodded awkwardly, unsure of what to say, but relieved to hear that Andromeda was less keen on the lessons than Narcissa was. It meant he wouldn’t have to try so hard to avoid her overhearing what he was going.
After a month, Pansy comes to visit. She too had fled Britain after the war, settling herself in Monaco where she’s become somewhat of an it girl, dating a string of gorgeous men and women and swanning around on yachts. Draco had been planning on visiting her this summer, as he always does—it’s good to get away from the city in high season—but he hadn’t, first caught up in Potter, and then caught up in missing him.
‘Speaking of wives, I should talk to Astoria,’ Ginny said, getting out of her chair and going to the dresser where they kept their parchment. ‘I presume she isn’t aware of her husband’s life-saving heroics?’ she tossed back over her shoulder at Harry.
‘Ah yeah, Teddy did say something about history lessons—he, um, didn’t seem too interested in them though to be honest.’ Harry laughed awkwardly. ‘What do you mean you’re trying to do them differently though? Surely the history is just the way it is?’
It was just a kiss, Harry told himself afterwards, as he walked aimlessly around London, not ready to go home yet. Just a kiss, a harmless kiss that meant nothing. The first time had been to save his life, this time just a kiss to get it out of his system. He could live with that, couldn’t he?
had run headlines screaming about his unsuitability for such a role, and at the time Harry had vehemently agreed—why in Merlin’s name would anyone think appointing an ex-Death Eater was a good idea? After a while, though, the headlines had died down and the wizarding world seemed to accept the idea of Malfoy as a Healer. They’d even accepted his sexuality, barely mentioning it beyond the odd throwaway line in articles that were far more concerned with his ex-Death Eater status. Harry had been very jealous of that at the time, when his own bisexuality was still being picked over by the press endlessly. One of Harry’s teammates had been treated by Malfoy not long after he had joined St Mungo’s and had sworn that Malfoy was responsible for getting her back on her broom so quickly. That didn’t mean Harry was happy to be treated by him though. He had a lot more history with Malfoy than most, after all.
And that makes Draco gasp, need hitting him like a sledgehammer. He’s always known about the power of words—he’s a dirty talk aficionado—but none have affected him quite so much as those words coming from Potter.
When Malfoy looked back up, his cheeks were tinged with pink. ‘It’s all right,’ he sighed. ‘We manage. I visit a lot. Even with all his many faults, she really did love my father. It shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise that a love like that can break you.’
Malfoy took the hint and walked over the threshold, his arm brushing Harry’s as he passed. Just that simple touch sent shivers down Harry’s spine, and he felt dazed as he closed the door. The snick of the lock echoed loudly in the otherwise silent hall as Harry turned to face Malfoy. Only a few paces separated them, and Harry’s body burned with awareness of their proximity. It felt like so long since he had touched Malfoy, the two months since that last night dragging on for eternity. Malfoy’s face was half in shadows, the dim light from the sconces on the walls making it hard for Harry to see his expression, but he thought that he saw a familiar look of hunger, of want, on Malfoy’s face.
‘How often should I do them?’ Harry asked, massaging his sore arm with his other hand in a vain attempt to relieve his muscles.
‘I don’t understand,’ Harry said, mind racing as he tried to figure out what had happened, flickers of pain licking at his nerves like a flame, everywhere apart from where Malfoy was touching him.
‘I know, it’s alright,’ Draco said, kissing Harry once again to show that he wasn’t annoyed. ‘I’ll see you next weekend for the next trip out? It’s a good one—I’ve been saving this place for weeks.’
‘At least you’re trying,’ Harry said eventually. ‘That’s more than most did.’ The majority of the Death Eaters had never repented, sure that their views were right, and had either wound up in Azkaban or had voluntarily left the country when it was clear that there was no place for them in British wizarding society any longer.
‘You look in shape enough to me,’ Harry said without thinking, looking up and down Malfoy’s body. Malfoy’s Healer’s robes were open, revealing the smart shirt and trousers he wore underneath, but even when the robes were done up fully they couldn’t quite disguise the long, lean lines of Malfoy’s body. He wasn’t overly muscled, and not as broad as Harry, but his body still made Harry’s mouth water.
‘Well, I am mostly here,’ Malfoy said, laughing, his eyes crinkling and his face lighting up in a way that made Harry’s stomach twist. ‘And I have to do a lot of training, and studying to keep up. With the little time I have left, I read a lot. I try to travel when I can. I see my mother, my friends.’
‘That’s—that’s good,’ Harry murmured, afraid that speaking too loudly might break this quiet bubble of intimacy that had formed around them. He opened his mouth to speak again, but the sound of a Monitoring Charm going off in the room next to them made him jump and broke the moment. Malfoy looked away and gestured for Harry to keep walking.
‘Yes,’ Pansy says simply, before adding, ‘we might have had a little fling when I visited a few years ago and we’ve kept in touch.’
‘It feels a lot better,’ Harry said, placing his wrist in Malfoy’s outstretched hand. Malfoy’s palm was cool against Harry’s skin, and Harry felt the hairs on his arm stand on end, his skin prickling with awareness. Malfoy hummed as he turned Harry’s hand over, his fingers gentle as they examined Harry’s newly healed bones. Harry couldn’t look away from Malfoy’s elegant hands on his arm.
When Potter complies, reaching a hand down to stroke Draco’s cock, Draco is done for. With a loud moan he comes, leaving streaks on the window, but he can’t bring himself to care because Potter is coming too, his spunk filling Draco as his stuttering hips coax out the last of Draco’s orgasm.
Draco’s good mood vanished immediately however when Teddy asked what was on the lowest floor of the Ministry, replaced with churning anxiety and guilt. Draco was unable to come up with a reason not to take Teddy there—it was only one floor down—and so on shaking legs, he lead the way to the courtrooms. He hadn’t been back here since his father’s sentencing. Since the last time he’d seen his father.
‘Do yours, Draco!’ Teddy had come back up to them, and stood looking expectantly at Draco, while Harry’s stag continued to dance behind him.
Even as Harry spent his evenings and weekends pulling apart the threads of his life, thoughts of Malfoy continued to occupy a corner of his mind. Knowing that he needed time to process and decide what he wanted from his life, Harry avoided Malfoy at work, dodging him in corridors and refusing to look his way during meetings. He wanted nothing more than to tell Malfoy what was going on, but he couldn’t—he and Ginny had agreed that they would keep it quiet, and he was determined to keep at least one promise he’d made to her. So he made excuses every time Malfoy tried to talk to him at work, pleading too much paperwork or an urgent case, dashing out of the room even as his fingers itched to touch Malfoy’s skin and the desire to kiss him threatened to overwhelm him.
‘I can’t discuss an individual’s treatments, but you’d be welcome to ask her if you want.’ Malfoy paused. ‘I’m aware that you may wish to get a second opinion before you take my advice.’
‘You really want me to fuck you, then?’ Potter says, bringing his finger to his mouth and sucking on it. Draco moans at the sight, and Potter seems to take that as a yes. He hurriedly strips himself of his own clothes, and Draco gets a quick glimpse of Potter’s muscled chest and the dark hair that leads down tantalisingly to his hard cock. But then Potter’s turning him, arranging him so that Draco’s palms are pressed against the cold windowpane, his arse brushing against Potter’s cock.
‘He does have a head, it’s just not properly attached.’ Of course Harry had been filling Teddy’s head with tales of Gryffindor and its ghost. ‘Every house has its own ghost though, so whichever house you’re in you’ll get to see one.’
‘I’m not trying to be mysterious, you dick,’ Harry said, before sighing and messing up his hair even further with one hand. ‘Fine,’ Harry sighed. ‘I quit the Aurors, a few days before I first came here.’
‘And you’re going to do it right there, rather than in your corner?’ Draco said, deciding that he wasn’t going to let Harry wrong foot him, that he was going to give as good as he got.
It’s dark by the time they fall silent, the room lit only by the pale, weak beams of the streetlights coming through the uncovered windows. They’ve shifted as they talked, and now they’re facing each other, bodies curled in mirror images of the other, close but not quite touching. It’s almost unbearably intimate, far more so than anything they’ve done with each other so far. Sex is one thing, but this is more than Draco’s shared with anyone.
Potter doesn’t speak as Draco begs, his fingers still idly tracing patterns on Draco’s stomach, but his eyes never leave Draco’s face, and Draco can tell he’s affected. Just when Draco thinks he can’t take much more of this, Potter takes mercy on him, tugging Draco’s joggers down before surging to his feet. Draco’s prick springs free—he never wears boxers beneath joggers, preferring the way the fabric clings to his bare cock—and Potter runs a fingertip through the liquid that’s pooled at its head.
That night, Harry had the best night’s sleep that he’d had the whole time he’d been in hospital, the Skele-Gro a low burn under his skin rather than a raging inferno, and he woke feeling refreshed and almost like he was getting back to normal. The pain in his wrist was nearly entirely gone, and even the watery porridge he was served for breakfast couldn’t dent his good mood.
It was late by the time Harry fell into a fitful sleep on the sofa, where he’d settled after he’d grown tired of pacing the house, and he woke up early the following morning, back protesting at his choice of bed, stomach churning at the thought of the day ahead of him. He’d made his decision the night before, and though it broke his heart to think of losing her, he couldn’t keep lying to her, couldn’t keep treating her so badly. She deserved a husband who loved her, with all his heart, and though it hurt to admit it, Harry knew that wasn’t him, not anymore. All that was left to do was tell her.
‘Yeah, Teddy might have mentioned that. I—uh—well, I thought maybe I could come along? On your trips that is, to help out with the Muggle stuff.’ Harry actually looked nervous as he waited for Draco’s response, his expression losing some of its easy confidence as he nibbled on his lip.
As they got closer and closer to the Snitch, Harry regained the advantage, edging ahead of Thorebourne slightly. It wasn’t by much, but it could be enough to change the course of the match. That knowledge gave him enough of a rush to make him push that little bit harder, knowing his goal was within reach. The Snitch thankfully levelled off before they could get dangerously close to the grassy pitch below, and Harry continued to pursue it, weaving through the Chasers who were still furiously trying to score goals. Clearly they were just as aware as Harry of how tightly balanced this game was.
It was good, so good that Harry couldn’t help thinking that maybe this wasn’t the first time Malfoy had done this, and even that thought could only turn him on more, the image of Malfoy on his knees for other men, practicing the skills that he was using to such devastating effect on Harry somehow only making him more aroused. The sound of Malfoy undoing his own zip made Harry open his eyes, the sight of Malfoy pulling out his own cock and starting to stroke it in time with the movement of his mouth on Harry almost enough to make Harry come there and then, pulling yet another groan from his lips.
When that isn’t enough, Harry moves so that he can see Draco properly, one wet hand coming to cradle Draco’s face.
‘And now?’ Harry asked tentatively. He was almost nervous—for some reason it was suddenly extremely important to him that Malfoy’s view on love hadn’t remained so pessimistic.
‘Is it any good?’ Malfoy asked, inclining his head towards the book. It was the first non-medical conversation Malfoy had started without prompting from Harry.
Draco smiles to himself as the door opens, and he adjusts his position against the window frame, stretching out his legs to make them look even longer than normal. He looks back out at the street as the door closes and his client enters the room. And then—
‘It’s not that long to wait now and you’ll know. Just remember that whatever anyone says, each house has good qualities. People might say Slytherins are all evil or Hufflepuffs are all boring, but they’re wrong—there are good Slytherins, and Hufflepuffs aren’t even slightly dull.’
love it, I’ll have my tea in it thanks.’ Draco laughed, handing it to Harry along with a rather more boring Chudley Cannons mug for his drink.
A small smile on her face, Millie shook her head at Draco, before turning and walking over to the shelves and pulling out several different materials.
‘What about this?’ Draco said, bringing another fabric up to them and holding it up against Harry’s chest. ‘The colour would go with my robes.’
They’d stopped walking as they got more involved in their conversation; Harry was glad to be able to concentrate just on Malfoy rather than on the increasing throbbing in his hip. The wall he was now leaning against provided some much needed support as he took the weight off his sore leg, but Malfoy was still standing close by, just in case.
Harry awoke to the familiar, and welcome, sound of Ron and Hermione bickering, their voices low in an attempt not to disturb him. The bright lights had been turned down to a dim glow, and it no longer hurt his eyes to have them open. He looked around the room, taking in the sterile white walls and floor that he hated every time he came to St Mungo’s, the lone floral painting on the opposite wall that only served to highlight how bare the rest of the room was, and the two uncomfortable-looking armchairs that held his best friends.
‘I have no idea, Potter,’ Malfoy said finally. ‘Maybe it’ll be enough. The only way to know for sure is to test it.’
‘Is that what you think love is like?’ Harry blurted out. To him, love was everything, the most powerful force in the world. Malfoy’s tone suggested he felt very differently.
‘I’m sorry, Harry, that sounds awful.’ Malfoy’s voice was soft, and one hand unfurled from its grip on his mug, coming to rest gently on top of Harry’s. The touch sent sparks down Harry’s arm, and he looked up, locking eyes with Malfoy. The startled look on Malfoy’s face suggested that he’d felt it too.
‘Really?’ Harry couldn’t help asking, totally powerless to stop the smile that was spreading across his face.
Confused at Draco’s reaction, Harry hurried to pull his invitation out of the stack of memos on his desk. The cream card the invitation was printed on was thick and heavy in his hands, an elegant swirling pattern bordering the words:
Harry lost track of how long they sat there, talking about nothing and everything. Even once Malfoy moved his hand away the sense of closeness that had built between them remained. Malfoy talked to Harry about the book he was reading, about Pansy’s latest disastrous attempt at trying to fit in in the Muggle world, about his recent trip to Ecuador. Harry was once again pleasantly surprised by how
They lingered in the valley for hours, Harry casting spell after spell, beaming at the way they were all so much stronger than usual, Teddy shouting requests for different spells he wanted to see. Draco mostly sat, cradled in the grass, watching, laughing, soaking up the magic that surrounded them, luxuriating in the sensation. He couldn’t stop watching Harry, the crackle of his magic, already so naturally strong, amplified by the waves of magic around them, washing over Draco’s skin and making him want, and ache, and burn. It was so much more than that though, more than just desire, more than just a physical need. Draco knew Harry was feeling it too, his looks increasingly heated, each glance sending a shooting star of pleasure up Draco’s spine with the promises they contained. Part of Draco wanted to grab Harry and Disapparate there and then, to take him home and let the tension building between them explode, and part of him was content to wait, each minute deliciously increasing the anticipation.
Once Draco is pushing back on Harry’s fingers, taking them with ease, Harry stops. Draco’s body misses the sensation immediately.
Hours later, they walked back to Harry’s room, the hospital coming alive for the day around them. Even though Malfoy had been valiantly fighting off yawns for the last half hour or so, he insisted on accompanying Harry in case his leg gave in. By the time Malfoy left Harry, tucked up in bed, his body aching from the exertion of walking so far, all thoughts of Harry’s nightmare had faded into nothingness, replaced instead by the looping memory of Malfoy’s laugh as they’d talked.
‘What’s wrong, Potter?’ he said, his heaving chest and panted words giving away the haste with which he’d come to Harry’s room. ‘Does something hurt?’
‘After all, Potter, no one will ever believe that we’re a real couple if our robes don’t work together,’ Draco said one day as they had a tea break.
‘As you wish,’ Malfoy said, before turning to Grace. ‘So as you can see from the chart, Mr Potter here has broken multiple bones, quite seriously, and as such requires an intensive course of Skele-Gro. As noted here’—Malfoy pointed at something on the chart—‘Mr Potter has already received one dose and is due another now.’
A bright flash lit up the room as his spell connected with the box, an ear-splitting screech emanating from inside it. Harry reeled backwards from the force of the shockwave that ripped across the room, his hands reaching up in an ineffectual attempt to shield his ears from the piercing noise still reverberating around the bedroom. Malfoy fell to his knees, the lack of advanced warning meaning he was hit harder than Harry, his face contorted with pain.
‘Start with three times a day, if you can. Listen to your body though, don’t push too hard, that’ll only set you back.’ Malfoy stood up and picked up the Skele-Gro beaker, passing it to Harry. ‘Don’t forget to take this, too,’ he added.
Draco’s words hung in the air for a long minute, and then a smile slowly spread across Harry’s face, and he was moving, shifting so that he was fully facing Draco, and his face was coming closer and closer. And then Harry kissed him, the touch of his lips so light and gentle that Draco almost thought he’d dreamed it. But then Harry kissed him again, and Draco knew he wasn’t dreaming. This kiss was deeper, more intense, and Draco couldn’t help the gasp that escaped him as Harry’s mouth opened, his tongue flicking along Draco’s lips. That gasp seemed to be what Harry had been waiting for, as he moved even closer, bringing one hand up to tangle in Draco’s hair, the other snaking round Draco’s waist, pulling their bodies as close together as they could get given their awkward positions on the sofa.
Harry dozed on and off for several hours, time losing meaning as he drifted in a semi-conscious haze. He was aware of people coming in and out of his room to check on him but was too tired to talk, even when Malfoy returned. There was somebody else with him, a young woman who looked as though she was recently out of Hogwarts. Malfoy talked quietly to her as he cast diagnostic spells on Harry, the sound of her quill as she wrote down whatever Malfoy said nearly louder than their voices. Most of the words Malfoy used didn’t make sense to Harry, either too technical or lost in Harry’s fogged brain, but even when his eyes slid shut again, powerless against the sleep that was trying to pull him under, Harry could hear the kindness in Malfoy’s tone as he explained Harry’s treatment to the woman. It was markedly different to the coldness that had been present in Malfoy’s voice when he spoke to Harry, and in his potion and sleep haze, Harry found himself curious about how a callous, cruel boy could turn into a man who spoke like that while willingly treating a man he was supposed to hate.
Draco nodded again, hoping that his face conveyed that he understood what she was saying and that he agreed, that he wouldn’t teach Teddy all the terrible things he had been taught. Andromeda seemed to understand him, as she left the room with a small smile, leaving Draco sitting alone, listening to the sound of her encouraging Teddy to stop playing and come and talk to his cousin.
‘Nah,’ Harry said, once again perusing the menu. ‘I fancy a hot chocolate, I think. It’s bloody freezing out there. Think I’ll try the peppermint one. Thanks.’
Draco nodded, disappointment flooding him even as he realised the sense in what Harry was saying. If Teddy woke up in the morning to find Draco still here he would be confused, and it would then be terrible if this tentative new thing between them didn’t end up working out. Every fibre of Draco’s body ached to stay, to spend the night taking Harry apart and putting him back together again, but the sensible, rational part of his brain knew that Harry was right.
Harry shot him a confused look - Draco normally loved socialising at these events, working the room like a seasoned professional. Draco caught Harry’s expression, and explained.
Despite his nerves at teaching a child for the first time and Teddy’s sugar rush, Draco thought their first lesson went relatively well. He began by explaining what pure-blood meant, and the way that historically pure-blood culture had kept to itself, distrusting anyone outside of a small group of families. Draco had found an old book in the Manor library that showed the initial grouping of pure-blood families, the basis of what became the Sacred Twenty-Eight, and he told Teddy about the descendants of these families, those who had been Draco’s friends and those who Teddy might meet when he started at Hogwarts. Teddy perked up at the mention of Hogwarts—clearly Draco had been right in thinking that he was desperate to start school—and Draco found himself going off on a tangent about how Hogwarts had been founded, and the debate that Salazar Slytherin had started.
Harry stormed out of the bathroom, his earlier good mood vanished entirely, the door slamming behind him, and walked straight into Malfoy.
The bell above the door rang as Harry let himself into the shop, sighing as a wave of warmth passed over him, his exposed hands thankful for the reprieve from the cold outside. At the sound of the bell, Draco walked out of a back room.
It shouldn’t be. They’re supposed to hate each other, supposed to have years of history between them that make something like this impossible, but that doesn’t matter, not when Potter is stalking towards him, making Draco step backwards until his back hits the long windows that line the room.
‘I think so, or at least could be,’ Malfoy said, his simple honesty taking Harry’s breath away. ‘Our divorce will be announced soon, once the legal arrangements are dealt with.’
‘Charming as ever, Potter, no wonder you don’t normally bring a date to this kind of thing,’ Draco laughed, before starting up the path to the house.
Malfoy didn’t come back to see Harry again that night, but he was with Harry in his dreams anyway, his face alight with the same excitement as when he’d been talking about his ideas for Harry’s treatment. Harry dreamed of Malfoy’s hands on his arm again, at first massaging Harry’s wrist, then drifting higher, over Harry’s collarbone and then down Harry’s chest. His fingertips ghosted across Harry’s skin, a trail of goosebumps erupting in their wake. Harry’s stomach muscles twitched as Malfoy ran his hands over them, desire building in his gut as Malfoy’s fingers nudged the waistband of his boxers. Malfoy’s hand was just about to slip under the material to where Harry wanted it most, when a sudden spasm of pain ripped through him, pulling him unceremoniously out of sleep.
Harry had been searching for the Snitch for well over two hours now without even a sighting. Judging by the frustrated expression on the face of Thorebourne, the opposing Seeker, she was having no luck either. The Chasers below them were trading goals, taking it in turns to edge ahead on points before the other team pulled them back to level. The crowd was loving it, the shouting and singing only getting louder as the points racked up but no clear leader emerged. Harry, however, was tense. The only way this ended was if the Snitch was caught, and it needed to be by him.
‘Uh,’ Harry hesitated. What was Malfoy asking? Harry had known he was bisexual for a long time, but he’d never actually had sex with another man before, and he had no idea how to answer Malfoy’s question. ‘I dunno,’ he settled on eventually.
stitched above the crossed wand and bone embroidered on her robes, marking her out as a Trainee Healer. Harry had a vague feeling she was the one he’d heard Malfoy talking to that first day, when he’d been half asleep. As Harry struggled to prop himself up slightly higher on his pillows, Malfoy gestured at her, and she took a step closer to the bed. She glanced quickly at Malfoy, and at his nod, she turned to Harry.
‘Fuck, it’s good to be out of that room,’ Harry said. The low rumble of Malfoy’s resulting laugh travelled through his side where they were walking close together as Malfoy helped him along the corridor.
By unspoken agreement, neither of them mentioned what had happened in Millie’s shop the next day. Their interactions for the first hour of the day were slightly stilted, tender, uncertain, as they tried to carefully tiptoe around the new dynamic between them. Harry was beginning to worry, scared that he had ruined a valuable friendship, but then they got swept up in work, and as they discussed potential theories on their latest case, the tension melted away. Harry couldn’t completely ignore the new dynamic between them, but over the following few days he grew used to it, and found himself enjoying the excitement and nerves of having a crush, something he hadn’t felt in a long time. He didn’t feel the need to do anything about it; it was enough to simply spend time in the same place as Draco, occasionally catching his eye and letting the butterflies fill his stomach, returning home every evening with a mind full of Draco and nothing else, each night drifting off to sleep to imagined scenarios of Draco in bed next to him.
He sets his flask between his bent knees, and folds his arms across his chest, gloved fingers pressing against his ribs. He thinks it’s definitely cold enough to justify sitting this close, trying to glean Draco’s body warmth. Perfectly normal.
“Fuck,” Harry shut his eyes, mouth falling open as he felt the warm, wet slide of Draco’s mouth, his tongue, against his hole. He sighed at the pleasure of it, the low build of warmth in his belly as Draco’s lips locked over him, mouth moving in a semblance of a kiss. Harry’s knees smoothed along the bedsheets as he spread his legs wider, pressing himself harder against Draco's face.
"This was as useless as everything else I've done. Everyone else I've spoken to," Potter says into the night air, as if Draco isn't there, or more accurately, as if Draco hearing it doesn't matter anyway. Draco isn't sure if he's flattered or bothered by this. It means he's either insignificant, or Potter's comfortable with him.
Draco takes a moment to consider. Potter's hand is warm against Draco's chest through his t-shirt. There's desire in his eyes and colour on his cheeks. He's exactly as alluring to Draco as he ever was, the boy who rejected his friendship, the teenager who constantly challenged him, the hero who saved his skin from ravenous Fiendfyre. And now, this man standing in front of Draco, shrouded in secrecy and hiding from the world but offering something of himself to Draco, and only to him―his company, his interest, a glimpse into his secluded world. If this is it for them, the only night they spend together before Potter disappears once more, then Draco wants this. He can be whatever Potter needs tonight; he's glad to be. It's more than Draco ever thought he would get, more than he’d dared dream of. He'll take it in both hands, and with the surests of grips.
which the sod kept pointedly saying over morning tea. Bugger that, and bugger Stephens, and most of all bugger herbal tea, because it was no substitute for coffee and Harry was fucking
"Yeah." Harry means to say more, something blithe or a joke, but he's already rocking his hips back against Draco's fingers, taking them in deeper. Draco's hand feels like a brand against the back of Harry's thigh as he leans against it, holding Harry open for him.
“Mmhmm. That, and my arse has gone numb. Speaking of which.” Draco pats the log he’s sitting on. “Have a seat, stop perching there on your haunches like a dying phoenix. You’re stressing me out.”
“No.” Harry glared at the shape of the wardrobe. He sighed. He was being moody. And he did want a wank. “Sorry I woke you,” he said.
Harry stares miserably at his traitorous phone screen, swaddled in his huge pile of blankets. He thinks about ringing Draco, but he doesn’t. He never wanted to make Draco feel uncomfortable because of Harry’s feelings, or to put him in a position where he would have to reject Harry. And now, in a fit of tipsy thoughtlessness, Harry has done exactly that. Calling Draco would only put him even more on the spot if he’s trying to think of a way to let Harry down gently, and Harry only feels more sick at the thought of it.
The night air is crisp and their footfalls are one of the few sounds punctuating the quiet night before Potter speaks. They’ve been walking for nearly an hour, letting excitement and booze settle in their stomachs, letting the very early morning chill soothe them. At least, Draco is. Potter looks like he’s deflating somewhat, but not necessarily in a bad way. The surge of the adrenaline that comes from bad news, and a good fuck, often leaves one feeling muted in the aftermath.
Harry’s quiet a beat, momentarily taken aback by Draco’s directness. “Not if you don’t want it to. I mean.” Harry clears his throat, deciding to repay Draco’s directness in kind. “I don’t want it to end here.”
Harry didn’t start a fight, though. He didn’t acknowledge Draco at all, as Draco walked closer, his feet trudging blindly forwards even though his brain was saying it might be smarter to stop and go back to the castle. It’s only when he’d walked right up to him, that Draco realised Potter was crying. His feet finally did stop working then, the surprise belatedly making them behave.
"Even more than I do, I think," Draco mutters again in that almost admiring tone. It's as if he's talking to himself, can't hold it in. "I can feel it, what this is like for you."
Potter nods. "Trying to. The problem is no one understands what’s going on with me. People aren’t Horcruxes. People don’t host… fragments of Dark souls for most of their lives." Potter spreads his hands, another helpless gesture. "There’s scant, if any, information on what the fuck I’m
Harry scribbles in reply. He's lying on the sofa, distracted, Midsomer Murders on the telly and typewriter balanced on his belly. He's going to write. He's got the proper page inserted and everything, his plotting notes sprawled on the coffee table and floor and under the sleeping cat. He's just also quite invested in how detective Barnaby will solve the current murder spree tearing through the sleepy town this week. It's hard not to get drawn in when someone's been killed by a wheel of cheese to the head. Draco's cryptic numeric queries just aren't that pressing in comparison.
"You might need to relax." Draco shuffles forward on his knees, kissing the base of Harry's cock again.
“Can’t see that far without my glasses. They’re still in the other room.” Harry resists the urge to stick out his tongue and say
Potter blinks several times as if composing himself. He looks like he is struggling with what he is about to say.
When he opens the backdoor that evening, he finds that the cat is waiting for him, blinking benevolently after having apparently ripped up Harry’s herb bed. He can see what looks like flower petals hanging out of its mouth, which means it's had a go at the geraniums, too. Lovely. Harry decides to let it in anyway. At best, he’ll have some company while he doesn’t write a book.
Maybe if he’s lucky the tea leaves will spell out what the hell he’s supposed to be doing with himself. Harry knows, deep down, that that’s an awful lot of pressure to be putting on the tea.
"It’s something." Draco folds one arm across his stomach, mirroring Potter’s posture. He keeps the other outstretched, fingers curved around his glass. "It must be. You’re
Draco’s room is only a door or so down from Harry’s, a short walk during which Draco doesn’t let go of Harry’s fingers, pulling him along. Draco’s room is darker than the guest room he put Harry in, and Harry makes a surprised noise when he steps onto plush carpet.
you?" Potter’s voice lifts a little, incredulous. "Do you need the money? Are you that hard up for work?" His words are somewhat harsh, but the tone of his voice isn’t. Potter just looks wary and genuinely confused.
"I mean." Harry runs his finger across Draco's cheek, down to his lips. "It's not as if I'll be able to hide it if I don't like it." He plucks playfully at Draco's full lower lip as if strumming a guitar string, watching Draco's mouth curve into a smile in its wake.
meet most nights. It is a little bit organised, enough so that Harry would notice if Draco didn’t turn up at some point tonight.
"Do you feel that?" Harry gasps again, his hips shifting again against the bed. His cock is hard and full between his legs, tenting out his joggers.
"You’re such a shit." Agatha fills up the tea pot, and Harry rests his hip against the counter. They both watch as the leaves happily float out of the strainer, staining the water, ruining the tea. Those bastards, Harry thinks fondly.
The bed shifts again abruptly as Draco finally breaks eye contact, leaning up off the bed, and Harry finally breathes out. Draco clears his throat, a flush painting his cheeks and the dip of his collarbone visible above the collar of his shirt a soft pink. He licks his lips, then runs his fingers through his hair.
“An astrological anomaly induced bond,” Harry repeats, deadpan, as the Head Healer of the Magical Malfunctions ward finishes announcing his prognosis.
"On the floor?" Draco interjects, smiling wryly. "I’m afraid that’s the only other option in this place. And I’m also afraid that the rules of hospitality, ingrained into me since childhood, won’t stand for it." Draco runs both hands through his hair, pushing it back and then tucking it behind his ears. "I’m certain I came out of the womb and my mother was likely showing me around the house, explaining where the amenities were and to make myself at home."
He and Draco seem to dance around each other, pottering around this enormous house and acting as though nothing has changed between them, and ostensibly, it hasn't. On the outside, they're acting as they always do. Internally though, Harry's insides are squirming, his belly swooping every time he catches a whiff of Draco's cologne or feels the trickle of Draco's emotions run down his spine. It's maddening. It's brilliant.
“So you did.” Draco smiles at Harry, head tilted down as he continues rubbing at his eye like an overtired toddler. He doesn’t answer the question, just as Harry didn’t either. His smile lingers though, and he doesn’t look away as he reaches for the doorknob and then gestures for Harry to enter.
Another kiss against his neck, Draco’s fingers trailing lower until they reached the line of Harry’s pants; he couldn't be bothered wearing much else to bed these days. Draco hummed as he traced the outline of Harry’s erection. “What do you want?”
Draco nods, although it pains him somewhat to do it. He knows Potter will be fine. He’s capable, and he’s done this on his own before, clearly, before Draco dropped him into this particular dive and managed to finagle this meeting. He’s still reluctant to see him leave.
Potter's well-researched notes are just as barren in this regard. They are instructive, but devoid of any revealing clues. Draco wonders if they were created specifically to be given to him, and if there are another set of far more revealing notes sequestered away somewhere in Potter’s accommodation. Notes with scribbles in the margins, with more details about why Potter is looking for someone like Darya, why Potter has been following a chain of people to get to her―what exactly he’s searching for answers to. Merlin knows, Draco’s case notes are always covered in tangents and details.
It’s not very polished, but it’s the most Harry’s written in at least six weeks, and it’s also absolutely not what he’s meant to be writing. Harry’s counting it as a win anyway. Maybe he can pen a book of short stories, or something. That’s better than nothing. Even if all the short stories are really
Harry rests his head back against the open cupboard door, then lets his hand drop down from rummaging around and onto the counter top. "This is the pasta shelf anyway," he murmurs in reply.
"Nothing, Malfoy." Potter's voice is heavy, and resigned. "She knew nothing. This was as useless as…" He breaks off and swallows thickly. Draco stares at his throat, watches his Adam's apple bob. There's a hectic colour on Potter's face, a flush coming from his chest to his neck and higher. It's the kind that happens to Draco when he's trying not to cry. Draco's chest suddenly aches.
With the added element of the bond coursing between them, muddling what’s coming from Harry and what’s Draco, things should be more confusing. Strangely, though, Harry feels just the opposite. For the first time in the year or so that Harry’s been parsing these feelings and instincts out, he feels with certainty that there is something there, that it’s not just him.
Harry manages a sort of grimacey face back at him. “Wait, we’re coup― case number seven?” Harry asks, incredulous. His head is
He slips both hands lower, over Harry’s hips and just above the curve of Harry’s arse. He tugs him closer, his thigh bumping up against Harry’s hardening prick. "Uh huh," he says cheekily, as Harry sucks in a gasp. "This is slow?"
Potter rolls his eyes, mutters something Draco can’t quite catch. Before Draco can ask, Potter goes on. "I’ve been. I'm looking for someone. Some… thing." Potter meets Draco’s eyes, his expression final.
"Well, when you put it like that." Draco moves his glistening fingers closer, slick with lubricant. Harry wants to spread his legs wider, open his hips even further, but this is it. He holds his breath, then lets it out slowly, keeping his breathing even and trying to relax his body as much as he can. Draco looks at him as he presses his middle finger inside, pushing past the resistance at Harry's rim. Even though Draco's fingertip is inching inside him now, the eye contact somehow feels more intimate to Harry. He clenches his free hand in the bed sheets, his other resting on Draco's bare shoulder.
Back leg thrust in the air, and tail wagging ever so slightly, the cat yawns and begins to groom its own arse.
Draco hums. "So greedy, Potter," he says, almost admiringly. He pulls his finger out entirely then presses his index finger up against his middle. He circles them both around Harry’s rim. "You really do like this, don't you?" He presses forward with both fingers.
Draco tilts his head to the side. The movement reminds Harry of a curious bird. “I’m not sleeping now,” answers Draco simply. He taps a piece of rolled up parchment against his left leg, before crossing it over his right. He resumes the tapping once more. “How did you sleep?”
Draco hums, muttering another spell sotto voce. "I can tell." He kisses at Harry's thigh again, lips moving to the base of Harry's cock. Harry jerks, surprised by the feel of it. He jerks again, his entire body on edge, as Draco sucks one of his balls into his mouth. He release it with an audible, wet sound and a low sigh, rubbing the knuckles of his cupped fingers over Harry's perineum.
“Making us go through the motions, you mean,” Harry gripes. He wrangles his thermos flask out from between his knees, and gulps down a warm mouthful. He looks at Draco, then taps the top of Draco’s flask with his index finger pointedly.
he writes, smiling to himself. It's an old joke between them, something Harry blurted out when he first found out Draco actually worked instead of lying around all day eating soft cheese and grapes, which is what Harry assumed posh gits did for a living. He's kept doing since he discovered how marvellously it pisses Draco off. Some parts of their friendship are still quite childish.
. Where you’ve been, why you’ve gone ghost on the wizarding public that so adores you." Draco crosses one ankle over the other, leans back in his chair. "That’s all," he finishes sweetly, as though he hasn’t just asked for something quite monumental. Whatever. In for a Sickle, in for a Galleon.
Draco doesn't want to make any promises about how they are going to figure this out, how they can find a fix for what is going on. He doesn't want to lie, even though he feels confident they can uncover
Potter nods, leading them towards what appears to be large public gardens. He hands Draco the cigarette, putting both hands up against the closed entry gate. It’s locked, as, of course, it would be at this hour of night. Potter moves his hands over the gate, feeling it out. "More than one," he says abruptly. It takes Draco a moment to reconnect his focus back to their conversation.
It takes more than a bite to make a vampire, Draco knows this. Draco can bite all of London, take a sip from everyone he can lay his teeth on, and they will be as vampiric afterwards as the cucumber slice Draco just petulantly bit into. That's not how this works.
If he waited, his father might have cooled down and let Draco stay. He already looked regretful when Draco marched past him, but Lucius won’t be the first to say something. His mother would have demanded a resolution, had she known. But Draco is many things, and while Slytherin cunning and self-preservation are top of that list,
Harry gasped when Draco lifted him again, licking down his perineum. Draco hummed, mumbling the wandless cleaning charm they often used, and Harry started at the sudden tingling of the spell working him over; he’d almost completely forgotten that himself.
The smoking man spits as Draco strides past him, but Draco doesn't take it personally. It appears to be more that this man is just revolting, and not that he's taken issue with Draco in particular. Small blessings, really.
He casts it away to the back of his mind, where all perplexing puzzles and unsolved issues live, and throws himself into finding Potter’s mystery person instead.
"The bathroom is through there," Draco says once he’s taken Potter upstairs. This flat is small, just one floor that Draco has rented. It has everything he needs. He isn’t such a fan of opulence these days as he once was in his youth. "If you’d like to shower?" Draco offers.
“Sure it is!” Harry replied enthusiastically. “I mean, it’s better than flipping a coin, innit? This way, we don’t have to decide who carries the baby. We just, you know.” Harry mimed drinking. “Take an equal dose, at the same time, and then ―”
"You’re quick," he says, with a small and achingly sad smile. "Yep," he confirms. "Me." He sighs, low and heavy. "It was there since the beginning. Some… bit of him." Potter looks revolted, and beyond that, almost despondent. He sniffs again, then looks back towards the statue. "It’s gone now," he states. "Out of me. They’re all gone, destroyed." Potter runs his hand over his mouth, leaves his cupped palm half covering his lips. "I saw it die," he says quietly. "And him." He breathes in deeply, then leans back against the park bench. "And we thought that would be it."
good a host, after all. Surely any Malfoy worth his salt can charm the icy touch off the floorboards.
, oh shit don’t touch me,” Harry ended on a whine, feebly slapping Draco’s hand away as he reached for Harry’s cock again.
“I thought….” Harry frowns. “Sometimes I did. But mostly I just wasn’t sure if I was seeing what was there, or just what...I wanted to see.”
They lapse into silence, but not an uncomfortable one, as they each serve themselves some breakfast. Draco elects for scrambled eggs with salmon and chives, the flecks of finely chopped green herb sitting starkly against the soft, fluffy yellow. Harry feels mildly overwhelmed by the amount of choice before him. They're only two people and yet there’s eggs, cold meats, a platter of sliced fruit and French pastries. He idly fingers his knife and fork and tries to make a decision. Across the table, Draco eyes him off.
He Summons his parchment and quill, settling back against the windowsill he’s perched on. He balances the parchment on one knee.
“Yes,” Draco deadpans. “It’s a little known secret that the Malfoys are actually from Cheapside. This accent, my hair, it’s all a lie,” Draco adds, crisply.
“I weigh about four hundred pounds right now,” Harry complained. It didn’t stop him from rubbing up against Draco’s thigh. God, he had nice legs. They’d been all skinny and matchsticky back at Hogwarts, when Draco had that growth spurt and it was like his body had been through a pasta roller and left him all long and haughty and scrawny. Puberty was the worst. Now, after a few solid years of professional Quidditch training and a regimented diet, Draco’s legs were bloody magnificent. Harry kept rubbing his stiff prick against the warm muscle of Draco’s thigh. He kind of wanted to rub his face on it now, too.
self-preservation, at the end of the day; the Manor is full enough of weighty ghosts and failed expectations as it is. Time for a new beginning on his own two feet.
to feel it. They're on the same side, he and Potter. There is history between them, as there always will be, but Draco doesn't need to condemn himself for his attraction the way his teenage self would have.
“Yes, well, can it not run through me so forcibly when I’m trying to work?” Draco gripes, unimpressed.
He slips under the sheets as Draco flicks the lamp off with a wave of his hand. Harry sighs at the feeling of soft, clean bed covers against his bare skin. He’s not sure if Draco’s had them recently laundered, or if it’s just the fact that Harry’s always found being in someone else's bed to be an exciting experience, but they feel cool and crisp against his warm skin. He stretches his legs out as he lies on his back, rolling his shoulders to try and settle himself to sleep. Beside him, Draco faces the wall, his back to Harry. Harry stares at the sharp silhouette of Draco’s shoulder in the dark, wanting to curl up behind him, but not quite sure of how it would be received.
His heart sinks into his stomach and right out of his arse into the floor and the molten core of the earth as he reads what Drunk Harry has sent to Draco.
Draco lifts one shoulder again in the same self-assured gesture. "I seem it because I am. Whoever, or whatever it is, I can find them," he repeats. "It's what I do."
"Merlin," Draco mutters, deflating as soon as the man is out of earshot. He leaves it at that, certain that if he starts complaining about this establishment he'll never be able to stop.
Draco didn’t want to come back to Hogwarts after the war, and once he’s there, his feelings don’t change. The castle feels wrong, and Draco feels wrong in it. He can’t shake the sensation that he shouldn't be here, and that it’s trying to expel him, spit him back out. He doesn’t blame it, really. Half the castle is still in ruins, its magic and stones ripped apart. Draco knows he did that, in one way or another; he opened up the wound that let the infection into the castle. It makes sense that as the castle mends itself it would try and cast him out with all of the other dark magic and filth the Death Eaters forced inside it. At least, that’s how Draco sees it.
Potter's hands snake up the back of his top, under his desperately too-hot jacket to touch equally warm skin, and Draco suppressed a shiver. Potter's thigh presses against Draco's thickening cock and his kisses falter as he breathes out a groan. Draco feels the vibrations of it across his lips, through the fingers he has spread over Potter's neck. Their rhythm doesn't falter, settling into a deeper grind. Potter's fingers press against the small of Draco's back as their hips roll against each other to the pounding bass of the music.
"Shit," Harry breathes out as Draco moved back in quickly, pressing his face against Harry's bare stomach and breathing in deeply.
Feet shoved in his shoes, and self pity shoved forcefully aside, Draco heads outside of his dorm room, fingers of his right hand curled into a fist and shoved into his pocket too, for good measure.
"Yeah, but not playing it professionally. Hated all the crowds, and the pressure." Ginny makes a gagging face, then pretends to shudder. "So I quit, and I got a lot of sad looks from people, and disappointed ones too. But it was worth it. I felt so much lighter afterwards." She pats Harry’s thigh. "I’m not telling you what to do, love. Just, making sure you know that, like. Saying no is an option, for your meeting on Thursday. A real actual one. Keep that in mind, yeah?"
He rarely dreams now. He doesn’t need to rest the way he did when he was human, and mortal, and bound by what seems now an incredibly restrictive recovery schedule. Sometimes it feels like his body is in a kind of conservation mode that his mind isn’t limited by. He doesn’t need to eat every day, or possibly at all, although he still enjoys it. He’s not sure he even needs to sleep during the day, but he absolutely must avoid the sun. He stuck his hand out a window once, when he was still learning how to be this new creature and wanted to test his own limits―see what was really true and what belonged between the pages of gothic fiction. He quickly discovered, through searing heat and excruciating pain, that the sun is indeed deadly to his kind. That part has not been exaggerated.
to. Apparently, reigniting a genocidal war, attempting murder after murder, and dropping their family in a collossal pile of steaming shit is somehow trumped by Draco liking cock.
blood for that matter. It won’t kill him, but it is toxic, and will make him powerfully sick. Vampires don’t feed on each other, and they don’t drink the blood of corpses. It’s useful to be able to tell who is who, in that regard.
Something flashes in Potter’s eyes, and he looks away. Draco doesn’t know what the expression is. "The people who matter know where I’ve been." Potter’s voice is soft but his expression surly. He sounds a little guilty, and extremely defiant. Draco quickly looks away before bringing his drink to his lips. He struggles to swallow his mouthful.
That thought rather blanks out Draco’s mind. He can tell Potter isn’t a vampire. Draco can sense his own kind, although he’d be fucked if asked to explain how. He just knows when other vampires are around, can pick up their presence in the air around him as though he had little supernatural antennae on his head. Draco thinks it’s a survival mechanism. Vampires are a bit like wild jungle cats, in a way. Solitary, territorial, silent and instinctively predatorial. They don’t like being around each other, not really, although they will tolerate it for the sake of bars like this one, for passing on information, or for company should eternal life get truly, unbearably lonely. It’s useful to know where the others of his ilk are, as well as making sure that they don’t feed on each other. If there’s one thing Draco knows it’s that undead blood is not good for him, or
It hadn’t worked out between them, although the sex had been fun and friendship had happily survived the breakup, and now Harry was rather back at square one―with a crush on someone he wasn’t sure what to do with. No one was trying to kill him at the moment, at least not as far as he was aware, but apparently the cosmos were still playing funny buggers with him, which was just his luck.
‘It can be. But then some days are so rewarding that it makes all the tiring days and late nights and no social life worth it.’ Malfoy’s face was earnest, leaving Harry in no doubt that he meant what he said. ‘It feels good,’ Malfoy continued, ‘to be able to do something good. It’s about the only thing that lets me sleep at night.’
‘Isn’t it incredible?’ Draco asked, smiling at the delighted look on Teddy’s face as he luxuriated in the feeling of true, unadulterated magic. Even the less powerful version that Teddy was feeling was still something beyond compare, like nothing he would have ever felt before.
From then on, Harry always stayed in the cafe while he drank his drink, and occasionally indulged in a pastry, always with a book open in front of him. Draco was fascinated - he’d never expected Harry to be a reader, but clearly he loved to lose himself in a good book. Draco had lined one of the walls of his cafe with bookshelves, filled to the brim with books for his patrons to choose from. By necessity they were all muggle books - he couldn’t risk one of his muggle customers accidentally stumbling across a mishelved wizarding book - but Harry didn’t seem put off. After his first perusal of the shelves, he stopped bringing his own book and started to pick them off the bookcases, taking each book home to finish but always ensuring that he brought it back the next time he came in. Draco didn’t like to admit it, even to himself, but he started to look forward to discovering what Harry would pick, and he found himself bearing Harry’s taste in mind when he browsed second hand bookshops for more additions to the cafe’s shelves.
By the time Draco got Teddy back to Andromeda’s they were both exhausted but happy, and Draco couldn’t help but think how grateful he was that Harry had suggested the idea of trips out. It was going to make all the difference to the lessons, and Draco couldn’t wait for the next one.
‘OK,’ Harry said, hands coming to the hem of his t-shirt ready to pull it off. ‘Can you, um, turn around?’ he added, noticing Draco still stood nearby, his eyes on Harry.
The Snitch was flying upwards now, drawing them higher and higher above the pitch. It was cold this high up, a fine wet mist clinging in the air, and Harry’s hands stiffened as he clenched his broom handle tightly, his knuckles pink and aching. He hoped desperately that the Snitch would change course, stop climbing higher. If his hands got much colder, he wasn’t sure if he’d be able to even reach out to grab it. Thorebourne was almost neck and neck with Harry now, and he turned his head slightly to see her flash him a wicked smile. Her face was alive with the adrenaline that Harry could feel coursing through his own veins, and it only spurred Harry on more. He didn’t want to lose this.
It wasn’t even that much of a lie. He felt awful. He’d hardly slept, seeing Malfoy every time he closed his eyes, and when he had finally managed to drift off, he’d woken early with a pit in his stomach at the thought of seeing Malfoy again. They hadn’t managed to finish everything in the house the previous day, so they’d have to go back and ensure all the dark magic was gone, before sealing up the house and then writing up their report for the client. The last thing Harry wanted to do was to go back to that house and work next to Malfoy, trying to pretend that nothing had happened between them. If he was off work, someone else would get sent to help Malfoy—no one would risk leaving the job unfinished until he was back.
‘And when can we start the rest?’ Harry said once he’d taken the Skele-Gro. The taste never got better, and it still set his eyes watering.
‘I knew nothing I did would make up for what I’d done. I’ll have to carry that with me for the rest of my life,’ he said, slowly and clearly, his eyes locked on Harry’s. ‘But I had to try. I had to try and be better than—than my parents, than the boy they brought me up to be. This felt like one way I could do that.’
Harry wrenches his gaze away from Draco’s fingers long enough to glance up at his face, taking in the mischievous grin on his face as he watches Harry writhe under his touch. Harry opens his mouth to say something but then Draco’s hand tightens round his cock, squeezing the head just enough to send a bolt of pleasure racing up Harry’s spine, and he gasps instead, all words forgotten.
‘And then what would you want me to do?’ Draco has his ideas about what Potter might say next, but it doesn’t matter really—he’ll do whatever Potter wants.
They both fell silent then, Harry’s brain racing as he tried to find a loophole, any way to avoid this. It’s not like he
‘I want to fuck you,’ Harry blurted out, nerves racing through his system as he spoke the words he’d been longing to say for so many weeks.
The weather was grim the next day, endless grey drizzle cloaking the city in a shroud of mist, a sea of umbrellas surrounding Harry as he walked from the Ministry to Diagon Alley. He could have Apparated to avoid the rain - Draco had, shaking his head and muttering about Harry being completely incomprehensible as he went - but he had wanted the walk to clear his head and, if he was honest, to delay what he was about to do. All day Draco had been chatting about the tailor they were going to visit, ‘a genius with fabric’ apparently, who would make Harry the best dress robes he’d ever own. Draco was extremely excited; Harry was extremely nervous. Buying robes together, letting Draco have input into what he wore, and maybe even watch him try them on, seemed far too intimate to Harry. But there was no way he was getting out of it, however long he dawdled on the damp streets of London so, steeling himself, he entered the Leaky Cauldron.
‘That’s nice,’ Malfoy said, causing Harry to turn his head to look at him. He seemed genuine, which somehow shocked Harry, even though everything he’d learned about this new Malfoy should have prepared him for that.
Draco had to hurriedly brush the tears from his cheeks when Harry finished talking to Teddy and suggested that they leave, hoping that Harry hadn’t spotted it but knowing from the look on Harry’s face that he had. As they made their way out of the courtroom, Harry’s hand brushed against Draco’s shoulder, a light touch that could so easily have been imagined, but Draco could still feel the imprint of that hand as they left the Ministry, a phantom presence that set his nerves alight. His physical awareness of Harry only increased when they slipped into an alley behind the Ministry so that Draco could Side-Along Harry and Teddy to their next destination, Draco’s stomach flipping as he wrapped a hand around Harry’s arm in preparation for Disapparition.
Malfoy nodded at Harry’s words, his lips twitching up into a smile that made Harry’s stomach somersault. ‘I know it won’t be easy,’ Malfoy said, his tone sincere, ‘but I want to try too.’
Draco had decided to focus on magical life for their next trip after their Muggle-focused day the weekend before. To further build on what he'd told Teddy while they looked at the Houses of Parliament he planned to start the day with a quick trip to the Ministry. Despite the fact that much of Draco's work was top secret, he had confirmed with his boss that it was alright to bring Teddy to his office for a quick visit, although he’d had to swear on his life that he wouldn’t take Teddy into the Department of Mysteries or talk about his job in too much detail. After that he was hoping to take Teddy to Gracebourne Estate, where generations of Blacks had got married, along with many other pure-blood families. What he hadn't planned on was seeing Harry. And yet there he was once again when Draco arrived to pick Teddy up; this time both of them sat on the sofa listening intently to a Harpies match on the Wireless.
As Harry began to explain how exactly the kettle worked, Draco found his attention drifting, distracted by Harry’s bare chest and the way his hands moved as he talked. He might have hated the idea of being in charge of Teddy’s
He appeared on a gravel pathway leading up to a large, beautiful country house, the facade lit up and the pathway illuminated by small flickering candles. A slow trickle of people passed him, couples arm in arm dressed in their finest, all chatting excitedly as they made their way into the ball. Harry’s nerves only increased at the sight, as the reality of what he was about to do hit him. All night he was going to have to pretend to be in a relationship with Draco, while trying to hide that he desperately wished he was. This was the stupidest idea he’d ever had. He was on the verge of just giving it up as a bad job and running away to hide at home, when a crack announced Draco’s arrival. It was even worse than Harry had imagined. Draco looked - well, he looked incredible. He’d adamantly refused to tell Harry what Millie was making for him to wear, so Harry wasn’t even slightly prepared for what he saw. Draco was wearing icy platinum robes that perfectly complemented his pale skin and hair, and the way the robes fitted him - Merlin, if Harry hadn’t wanted him already, he definitely would now.
‘I was, uh—I was thinking, maybe I’ll come back?’ Potter says, to Draco’s great surprise. He looks nervous, fiddling with his fingers, a line forming between his eyebrows as he frowns.
Legs still a bit wobbly after the way Potter had so thoroughly fucked him, Draco casts a quick cleaning charm before stumbling over to the other sofa, lying down on his back and staring up at the ceiling. If Potter’s not in any hurry to leave, well. Draco’s not exactly going to kick him out. They’ve probably got time for another round, and Draco definitely wouldn’t be opposed to that.
‘Well,’ he said, clearing his throat slightly. ‘I suppose I should go. Astoria will be waiting for me.’ Harry didn’t miss the way Malfoy didn’t meet his eyes as he mentioned his wife.
Malfoy’s professional blankness slipped slightly at Harry’s words, his eyes flashing. ‘You should trust me because I take my job seriously,’ he snapped. ‘I took an oath to treat anyone who needs help, which, unfortunately, includes you. I will treat you and do it well, whatever my personal feelings towards you. Besides, no one will get you back on a broom as quickly as I will, believe me.’
‘Well only one of us joined a pro Quidditch team after school, while the other one of us ran themselves ragged working all the hours in the day, leaving no time for exercise, let alone flying, so I think I have a pretty good idea who would win,’ Malfoy said with a wry smile.
‘A few months,’ Harry said, closing his eyes as he spoke, too cowardly to see the look on Ginny’s face at his confession.
Harry practically floated home, the grin that had spread across his face as soon as he took to the air still firmly in place. Despite the lingering aches, his body felt better than he’d expected, and he was filled with hope that he would soon be match fit. High on adrenaline and excitement, Harry chucked his kit in the corner as soon as he got home and rushed to find a piece of parchment. He’d nearly written to Malfoy on multiple occasions since he left hospital, always changing his mind at the last minute, but today he was too happy and hopeful to listen to the little voice in his mind that pointed out all the reasons not to do this. He wanted Malfoy to know that his efforts in the hospital had paid off, that Harry was flying again. That Harry was still thinking about him.
Harry nodded again, not looking away from Malfoy even though the intensity in his gaze was doing strange things to Harry’s insides. He’d suspected that Malfoy had changed, quite dramatically, in the years since the war, but it was quite another thing to have it confirmed, to hear Malfoy condemn himself so roundly.
‘I—,’ Potter looks momentarily lost for words, his eyes darting about as he seems to search for an excuse for his presence.
Potter gapes at Draco, his eyes wild. He doesn’t deny it though, and that’s all the confirmation Draco needs.
Hot water fell all around them, cloaking them in a curtain of water, the noise drowning out the increasingly desperate sounds Harry was making as Draco continued to wreck him just with kisses. Harry had kissed his fair share of people over the years, but no one had ever kissed him like this; no one had made him feel so much through such a simple act. Draco’s hand wrapping around his throbbing cock made Harry cry out, already so close to the edge, and he nearly sobbed with relief when Draco sank to the floor and swallowed him down. It didn’t take long for Harry’s legs, already tired from the match, to start shaking as pleasure rushed through him, and Harry reached blindly for the cubicle wall, needing something to ground himself with as he lost himself in the feeling of Draco’s mouth on him.
Draco spent the next week trying to decide how to tackle his lessons with Teddy. He saw him occasionally, but they certainly weren’t close, and Draco had never been good with children, so he had no idea how to even begin planning out their sessions. He took the Floo to the Manor one evening to borrow the Pensieve that had sat, untouched, in his father’s study since Lucius had been dragged off to Azkaban following his trial. Once home, he spent the night revisiting painful memories of his own
'Yes,' Draco blurted, his need to not leave Harry yet overpowering his normal tendency to think before speaking. 'I mean, yes, that would be nice,' he added, cursing the blush that he could feel warming his cheeks.
Laden with cups of steaming tea and a hot chocolate for Teddy, as well as several large bags of Muggle sweets that Draco had never seen before, they made their way to the living room, ready for film night. Teddy was already settled on the sofa, but moved over to let Harry sit down, and Draco followed suit when Harry insisted there was enough space for him. There wasn’t, not really, but Draco sat anyway, his body immediately pressed against Harry’s, a shiver running through him at the contact.
Harry eventually rolls away, but he doesn’t get up and leave like Draco is used to. Instead, he stays next to Draco, seeming totally at ease with his nudity and what they’ve just done. He starts to stroke Draco’s wrist, his fingers making Draco shiver as they slowly explore the flowers tattooed there. To Draco’s relief he doesn’t say anything. He knows Harry is aware of what the flowers cover, but he doesn’t want to discuss it, not now. Not when he’s so happy and at peace.
Normally when Pansy comes to Paris, her visits are a whirlwind of cocktails and shopping and dancing late into the night, but instead of immediately dragging him out to some fancy gala, Pansy pushes Draco into his living room and makes him sit down.
Potter breathes, almost completely unconsciously, his eyes wide with shock as he looks down at Draco.
The only way Harry could make it through the day was to keep reminding himself that this was temporary, just the lingering effects of the dream making him see things that weren’t really there. He’d had sex dreams before, and had never ended up fancying the people in them, so the chances of it happening this time were so tiny as to not be worth worrying about. It had just been too long since he’d been intimate with anyone, and Draco was an attractive man who he spent nearly every day with - it made sense that he would be the focus of Harry’s dream, especially now that they were pretending to go on a date together. It meant nothing more.
Draco pulls away, shaking his head in what looks like disbelief. "I can't believe this." He breathes out in a laugh, before resting his forehead against Harry's thigh. Even that feels maddening right now.
“Harry,” Draco responds, stopping in front of the third door he comes across. Nettle trots past them, slipping into another room a door down which must be Draco’s, given the way she confidently enters. Harry feels so oddly fond that she sleeps in his room. He never pegged Draco as an animal person, but now it’s another piece in the collage of Draco that Harry’s been making in his mind―all those strange and unexpected pieces that seem to slot together and somehow make perfect sense.
"No," Potter says on a laugh. He's looking down at Draco's hand. He slowly traces a finger over Draco's knuckles. "I've nothing else here. I can leave whenever you're ready."
Dimly, he feels he should be scared of this. His body feels struck still, his throat tight, his voice gone. There’s something sitting in his chest that feels like anticipation, though, not fear. Harry’s certain he can still recognise what true fear is. His wand is vibrating in his pocket, the emergency signal shooting back to The Ministry as it detects something wrong with its possessor, but even that isn't enough to worry Harry.
Harry replies, wracking his brains for the few things he might know about Australia. Dudley, and for a while there his Aunt Petunia, used to be mad for an Australian soap opera, and Harry can vaguely recall a lot of beaches and very attractive people having dramas and outdoor meals and owning a lot of bathing suits.
Draco blinks, then frowns. He opens his mouth to argue, but stops when he feels Potter's hand on the crook of his elbow.
The sooner he leaves as well, the sooner he can put off thinking about the fact he’s just told Potter where he lives.
"Ohhhhh," Harry says out loud again, this time in understanding. ParchText is rubbish the further away the writers get, lagging as much as a day or two between messages. Which is fine, except that Harry's got rather used to instant gratification when it comes to chatting with Draco.
"I want to." Draco presses his hand against Harry's sternum, lets it slide down his chest. A duel shudder runs through them as Draco pinches at Harry's nipple. "Fuck. Can I, Harry?"
"Yes, well." Draco forces a smile to cover his nervousness. "I could, of course, also send you there alone with her information, if you prefer. As your hired investigator, though, it would make sense I go with you. I have friends in some very low places. It may be useful." Draco bites his lip. He watches the play of emotions across Potter's face and tries not to overthink this.
Potter raises one eyebrow, having observed the exchange. There's a smile ghosting around the corners of his lips. "Not getting in the way of something, am I?" he asks playfully.
short, and based on things Harry can see in his garden, and people he used to hate in school and now really doesn’t.
When there's a knock at the door he startles, grabbing the window frame with one hand and almost dropping his smoke with the other.
“Boo.” Draco lips quirk into a half-smile as he places his hand into his lap. He’s shirtless still, wearing the same silk dressing gown from the previous morning hanging open. He’s slipped on a pair of black boxer briefs, too.
Harry licked his lips, looking down at his slightly less hard cock as Draco counted in his head. At least the introduction of the Malfoys senior had taken the edge off Harry’s need to come, he thought, clinging to that silver lining as he tried very hard not to think about wedding nights and Draco’s parents. He gripped himself again, stroking his cock and running his hand over Draco’s belly, down the soft thatch of slightly damp hair between his legs. He tugged on it lightly.
He spends his days sending photos of his food to Dean, fielding motherly concern from Hermione and dick jokes from Ginny, while whining at Draco and generally getting nothing done.
Harry knows he was in a brilliant mood after his frank and caring dressing down by Ginny, and that he gushingly told her all about how much he liked Draco and how much they talked, and oh god he went on a bit about the kisses Draco sent, because Harry is an idiot who has no filter when he drinks. He doesn’t know why he felt the need to ride that happy wave all the way to his phone and splash his feelings across the globe at Draco and ruin everything. Lovely.
He scans across the words in front of him as well as he can without his glasses, trying to absorb the blur of medical jargon. He can’t understand half of it, but he can get the gist well enough.
Harry huffs, scooting closer on the sheets so he can fit his body behind Draco. Just as before, he doesn’t feel any magnificent surge when their bodies touch. He does feel comforted, though, warm at all the places they touch―his knees tucked in the backs of Draco’s, his chest against the back of Draco’s shoulders, his flaccid prick pressed against Draco’s arse. It’s intimate, in a way that Harry can’t separate from the way the bond felt, and the way he just usually feels about Draco.
Draco’s entire body tenses; he hadn’t even noticed he was doing it. He forces himself to relax, then slowly pulls his hand away. His heartbeat is still too loud in his ears, but the anxious need to run is ebbing back down into something calmer. Draco flexes his fingers, then feels something warm settle in his chest when Harry loosens his fingers but doesn’t let go of Draco’s wrist.
"No touching," he whispers, his smile so beautific it makes Harry’s breath catch in his throat. "Isn't that the rule?”
“God.” Harry huffed a laugh, settling back against the pillow. “I’ll go and have a wank in the loo,” he grumbled, a little self-deprecating and a lot embarrassed.
Draco bursts a laugh, solid and genuine. "Only glimpses. Hardly watching." He bites his lip, looking down at his notepad, at the books. He carries half a library with him these days, shrunk into a small briefcase. He got several out when he awoke, strewn around him now. He isn't best sure how to broach this subject with Potter, of what he's been doing. He decides against his usual bluntness.
Draco keens, resting his forehead against the inside of Harry's thigh. "You're close, Harry." It's not a question.
"Oh, Harry." Ginny sighs, then kisses him on the temple. "You’re the bravest person I’ve ever met, and the kindest person, too. You’re such a good friend to me. Just. Be a bit kind to
“Fuck, I’m so sorry,” Harry apologises emphatically. “I had no―they didn’t mention not to, I didn’t think that―”
. He catches Harry eyes straying down to it and Draco stiffens, alarmed that Harry will notice. The light is dull though, coming only from Harry’s wand, and Harry doesn’t say anything. Draco relaxes. He reminds himself that no one else is obsessing over his arm. Just Draco.
In a burst of inspiration, that may or may not actually be a burst of anxiety, Harry quickly fires off a,
Potter's laugh sounds shocked. "A bit, yeah." He bites his lip, then lets out a sigh. This time it sounds less heavy. There's almost a tone of excitement in it now.
The sudden thought of Draco being able to feel what he is feeling via the bond makes that same feeling in his stomach lurch and plummet.
goes unsaid. His mind is whirring, the cogs in his head spinning faster than he can keep up with. He thinks he’s just now fathoming the true depths of Potter’s loneliness. A vision of the figure in his room each night flashes into his mind, unbidden. He blinks, still not ready to put a name to what he now knows it must be. "We thought we could find out what it meant together. We used to do that, she and Ron and I." Potter trails off. Draco doesn’t want to ask, to point out that Potter is here alone, that he’s searching without his friends. It feels too harsh right now to state the obvious. There must be a reason for it, and Draco is certain it will be nothing good.
Draco licks his lips, looking away. "Tit for tat," he explains, his voice rough. He clears his throat before he speaks again, feeling oddly uncomfortable. Exposed. "I think I rather owe you, as it were. For… services rendered. In the Room of Requirement." Draco swallows again, his throat feeling tight. He holds Potter’s gaze, but he can’t say the words, ‘
Potter stops in front of a blessedly free cubicle, turning to face Draco. "Is this okay?" he asks, inclining his head towards the open cubicle door. There's a bloke nearby who gives them a vaguely interested up and down. He'll assume they're planning to do lines, or do each other, neither of which seem to be a surprising occurrence here.
He braces himself on his elbows to get better leverage, Potter's thighs rubbing against his hips and his breath hot and erratic against Draco's lips. "It's fine" He kisses Potter again, deep and hungry. "Not insensitive. Just, surplus to requirements," he explains. He means it too; it really is fine. He's done it before, bitten someone while getting off. For some people it's a powerful rush, submitting like that. For Draco, it can be euphoric. But it's alarming, too, to combine feeding with sex, and it truly is not necessary. If his carefully collected control were ever to slip, he worries it would be in the throes of either anger or passion. Draco perishes the thought.
), at 1am. It’s twenty to, now, but Draco has been here since midnight. He’s restless and excited, and not a little bit nervous as well. The sun set hours ago, and Draco was already awake hours before that, eager to leave behind strange dreams of dark figures―eager to see Potter again.
Harry blinks, taking Draco’s words in. "I died once," he says after a moment, shrugging one shoulder.
?" Harry flaps his hand, his face turning red and into the expression of a constipated gargoyle at the same time. "No, why would you ask that?"
It has almost no grammar, and a lot of spelling errors, and definitely reads like a drunk text. It also absolutely reads like an honest confession, which is obviously the worst thing in the world.
Draco turns his sneer, preciously aimed at the room, towards Potter. "No," he says crisply. "Just because I drink blood doesn’t mean I have no taste, Harry."
Draco hummed, then slapped Harry’s thigh gently. “Sit up here,” he gestured at his face, pulling Harry more fully on top of him. He bit his lip as Harry stared incredulously down at him.
The first time Draco came out here at night, he didn’t expect anyone to be around. It was his little hidey hole, his safe spot. He didn’t think anyone else bothered to come back behind the greenhouses, not where the vegetation was so overgrown and full of the threat of gnomes, and spiders, and brambles in cloaks.
It’s deeply unsettling, but strangely Draco doesn’t find himself frightened. He doesn’t know what this being is, or what form it takes. It looks like shadow and silhouette now, appears threatening in its ambiguity, its lack of distinguished form. But anything would, Draco reasons. He senses nothing from it. He’s not sure if it wants something, or what it even is. It’s humanoid, he can tell maybe that much from the general shape of it and the gleam of what seems like eyes. Draco thinks he can make out hunched shoulders, perhaps. Like someone crouched in the corner of his room. It’s like trying to see a shape in a dark ocean, though. Nothing is really clear enough to put his finger on it. Still, nothing really scares Draco about it, either, although he thinks perhaps it should. He’s not easy to frighten these days, is the thing. One of the few perks to having already suffered at the hands of a dark being is that he's not sure any others can truly hurt him now. He's not tender meat anymore.
Across from him, Draco looked puffy-eyed and sleepy, his cheek creased from the pillow and his mouth twisted in that soft little half-smile he always wore when he was just waking up and hadn’t remembered that he was raised to always look haughty and like he had half a lemon stuck up his nose. His hair was sticking up on the side he’d slept on, an enthusiastic testimony to how well Draco had been sleeping, and his skin was warm as he rested his bare shoulder against Harry’s. Harry’s cock twitched and he stifled a groan, lifting one leg to try and hide it. He felt the tickle of Draco’s hair as he turned, then kissed the bump of Harry’s shoulder.
“God.” Harry nodded, letting Draco ease his underwear down. The curve of his stomach pressed against the flat of Draco’s as Draco kissed him. “You have training tomorrow,” Harry said breathily against Draco’s lips. He rolled his hips again, felt Draco press the flat of his palm against the damp material at the head of Harry’s cock.
The figure is in the room, unmistakable in its shapeless presence—just a gleam of watchful eyes, a stirring in the air.
“Oh, fuck.” Draco relaxed against the sheets, one heel running over Harry’s back as Harry ran his lips and then his tongue around Draco’s hole. Harry did it again, felt a shiver of arousal run through him as he felt the muscles in Draco’s arse and legs tensing, felt Draco’s hands curling into his hair and pulling his face closer to his body. “Jesus, Harry,” he muttered.
. What he doesn't have is any fucking idea why Potter is looking for her, or what he might want from someone who dabbles in this. More than dabbles, even. Someone entrenched in these darkest of magical arts.
Draco tilts his head, a smile still lingering around his lips. He folds his arms around his waist. The collar of his white vest hangs low around his collarbone and his grey silk dressing gown open. “Oh, it’s not as dire as all that, Potter.”
Harry groans. His good mood completely evaporated, he sets his phone down. His hands feel a bit shaky, and his stomach feels wrong. He takes a deep breath. He’s probably overreacting, he tells himself. Draco is busy, he has a whole house to de-ghoul, and so what if he would have usually responded by now, or initiated a conversation? Perhaps he’s not sure what to say, given that Harry has made everything spectacularly fucking awkward for him. Harry runs his fingers through his tangly hair, and then rests his elbows against the table, his chin and mouth smooshed into his palms. He blows a miserable raspberry, eyes wide and frantic. He needs a fucking Time-Turner.
“Maybe members of the Black family are just especially fertile,” he said in a low voice, leaning down to run his lips over Draco’s. The movement brought his flagging erection into contact with Draco's arse, and Harry bit his lip, sighing. “We’ll find out soon, anyway.” He brushed his mouth against Draco’s, felt him hum in response.
He sets his phone down with his shaky wobbly hands, and then gets up to make some tea and go and panic at Ginny about what he’s done, while he waits for Draco to reply.
He crawls into bed, out of habit more than necessity, and lies there in the predawn half-light. He imagines his toes are drifting off to sleep, then the balls of his feet, his calves, and keeps going as far up his body as he can before his mind switches off. This is what he needs to do to make himself sleep these days. His body simply won’t do it otherwise.
Agatha purses his lips. "So, this whole ‘getting away from London’ thing isn’t helping with the writer’s block at all, then?"
"Any of it." Draco breathes in deeply through his nose. "All of this. But specifically, the fact that it feels like I'm sucking my own prick."
