“M’gonna… cook ‘im.”
“For what?!”
“Oh Merlin.”
Harry was gone. Draco found out from Charlie, the town baker, who had given him an apologetic look and told him the traveler had stopped using the spare room in their shop over a month ago. Draco just nodded and tried to ask for the bread he’d been sent to get, but his cracking voice gave him away. Charlie took one look at him and sent him home with a free bag and a short pat on the back.
“Those are only used for the royal family, though,” Pansy glanced up from her work. “Is something the matter?”
Draco watched helplessly as Potter drew his wand, and with a practised wave conjured up a cupcake. On top was a single burning candle, flickering in the breeze.

That was before the
on about?”
“Don’t you dare.” Harry’s grinning, he knows he is. He snatches a cookie from the top of the tower before becoming Draco in. “Make yourself at home.”
you like you. I’d like this to be a date.”
A good place to start, indeed. And when he climbs over the glass so Harry can clutch him closer, it gets even better.
“... December 5th?”
Or would he? Had Harry even liked him that much from the beginning? Courtings never lasted long, usually skipping to marriage fairly fast, and that’s what everyone insisted Harry had been doing— building up to ask Draco to court, at the very least. Even Draco had somewhat believed it. Had hoped.
He was grinning when Draco reached him, his face aching from the force of his smile. Harry opened his arms to hold him, certain that just this once circumstances didn’t matter.
Draco felt dizzy with happiness.
“Jesus fucking Christ, Potter!” And Harry’s too surprised at Malfoy’s use of Muggle jargon to dodge the magazine he smacks him over the head with. “I’m asking you out, you daft wanker!”
“Er, Hermione picked them.” Harry rubbed the back of his head awkwardly. He knew as much about shoes as he did about wines.
interested’ yet. It’s an intoxicating feeling.
“Another bouquet from the meadow,” he snorted. Green eyes narrowed playfully.
an ‘if’ for me, I’d still choose you. You’re a good ‘if’.”
“‘It’s going to eat me’?” he finally said.
Harry lets him lead from there, and they wander together deeper into the maze of bushes. He takes Draco’s hand and Draco winds their fingers together mindlessly. Harry’s palm is sweaty, but it’s still nice. The wisteria runs alongside them and overhead, and somewhere he can smell jasmine. There used to be a tree of the sweet flowers around here years ago but Draco has trouble believing it’s survived this long. There’s no hope of finding it even if it is still growing— there’s nothing to see but the path branching off in all directions, each turn disappearing into the shrubbery.
“Do you think I’m the wrong choice?” Harry asked, because even if it tore him apart he had to know.
Harry had never unzipped that quickly in his life. He held the edges open, and Draco turned around to eye him before he hummed in satisfaction and leaned in against Harry’s chest. His head landed on Harry’s shoulder, his forehead pressed against the side of Harry’s neck, and Harry hurried to wrap his jacket as far around Draco as it would go.
“It’s not even a sexy jumper,” Ron muttered beside him. “Not even fitted.”
Harry’s just getting on a roll with his embarrassed self-loathing when there’s a knock on his door. He sighs and prepares himself for some form of chewing out before he opens it.
A frappuccino, as it turns out, was worryingly expensive, melted frighteningly fast, and contained about as much coffee as it did caramel. But Harry felt immensely proud of himself while carrying it through the Atrium. Draco was usually such a paragon of good taste and luxury, that most people assumed he’d enjoy something more authentic, like one of those itty-bitty sipping coffees. Harry was the only one who fully appreciated Draco’s love for sugar. He tried not to smile in the lift.
“Tacky romance novels don't count.”
Just then, as he made eye contact with Hermione, the air was rent by a shrill—
“Well,” Draco sniffs. “You could have owled.”
Draco felt his cheeks heating up, and he glanced away. There was a beat of silence during which neither moved.
The bus stopped at a light, throwing them forward a bit, but it was as good an excuse as any for Harry to wrap his arms tighter around his grumbling parcel.
“Pea for… Poppy? Penelope?”
Draco’s such a perfect sleeper: he curls into a tight ball, hands clasped against his chest and knees pulled up towards his chin. He’s never stolen a blanket, never snored, never kicked— he stays still as a statue, sleep-soft and warm under the covers. With the way he tucks his head, he even fits perfectly in the cradle of Harry’s body on cold nights. There’s nothing Harry doesn’t love about it.
“What?” he sighed.
“So you didn’t agree only to please me?”
“What are you on about, Malfoy?”
“Would you mind—”
Both of them knew there was no arguing with that.
The night before their wedding, there was a heavy knock on Draco's door. Riven stepped in after a moment of silence.
“Don’t,” Harry snapped. “Do
“Draco, I like you,” Harry says. Draco’s cheeks are absolutely burning. He thinks he could dance. He’s terrible at dancing. “Like,
“He’ll run away.” Draco chews his lip, wondering why Harry doesn’t just hand Pea to him before he remembers they are indeed in the midst of a pandemic. “Right, six feet apart.”
“Draco—“
“Well,” Harry said, “he hasn’t said anything about it. Didn’t even look at me differently.”
“What chivalry,” Harry heard him mutter, but his cheeks were pink again, and he lifted his hands to tuck them under the dangling ends of the scarf. Harry’s heart sped up at the sight.
Sure enough, a small green flame was flickering cheerfully against the shell of Draco’s left ear. Portable Floo.
“Thank God, Pansy,” Draco jumped up. “I thought you’d left me here to die.”
“I absolutely mind. It’s terrible. Cease immediately.” But Potter just stared for a second before snorting. Surprised, but feeling lighter than he had in months, Draco hesitantly cracked his own smile.
In theory, there was nothing wrong with his answer. But when Draco started and glanced at him in bemusement, Harry suspected he might be missing something. Hermione elbowed him and tapped her ear with a snort.
“I’m sorry.” Draco just nodded. “I understand if that’s your choice. I have one request to make, however. If you won’t have my hand, perhaps we can still be friends? I enjoyed your company today, and I don’t get the chance to spend time with many people outside of the court. I’d like to visit you again, if that’s alright.”
Draco stood up from where he’d been sitting in the waiting area outside the Head Auror’s office. He’d had a short meeting before Harry’s in which Robards had promised him compensation for all lost property and a small bonus. Harry wasn’t sure why he’d waited, however. A large part of him wished it was out of concern, but the more likely scenario was that he wanted to see Harry get his.
“No! No, it’s not that,” even though Draco rushed to say it, he didn’t think to lie. Riven had not yet shown a cruel or unlikable side. “Like I’ve said, I simply don’t know you, Your Highness. I cannot marry someone I’ve never even held a conversation with.”
“Why on earth not?”
“If you’re suggesting I go home with you—”
“I worked hard on my tits,” she complained. “And he doesn’t even care? What’s so wonderful about Draco? He’s so
“If it makes you feel better, I haven’t been anywhere but the store and a few runs for three weeks.”
Which is why he knows it must be him. It simply isn’t possible that Draco talks in his sleep.
“Well, that’s—” he paused. Hesitated. “I suppose... I’m glad you’re alive as well.”
“Yes, Your Highness. I’m sorry, but it is.”
Harry’s cheeks grew hot. He bit his lip to curb his smile, too caught in Malfoy’s implications to think of a witty reply.
it were— then by all traditional standards it would qualify as a disaster. They’re adults, dammit.
“Hm. Ron told me.”
The lift started to sink.
“I’m sure you must have been wondering where I disappeared to, these past few weeks.” His voice was stilted.
“What the bloody fuck?! ”
The roses sat among the bouquets, their deep red the brightest spot of color in the rain. Harry wanted Draco to have things like that—to have roses every morning he wanted them. To fill his  life and his house with things that showed him how much Harry cared. Things that would make his every moment brighter, that would remind him how much he meant to someone.
One thousand roses, as it turned out, was just enough to fill an office. Harry shrunk them down to fit in his robes and made his way quietly through the Ministry. He took the stairs, determined not to be discovered, although the halls were quickly emptying at this hour. Harry himself should have long since been at home and in his dress robes, which meant Draco was certainly gone at this point.
“Potter on his knees in my lab,” Draco mused. Harry almost choked at his words. “That’s certainly a picture. I think it just might make up for losing a day’s work.”
“Don’t think about it,” Ron urged. “Come on, just put something down.”
“Your explanation had better start improving,” Draco forced out. “Before I rip that look off your face.”
“I see.”
“Er, been getting a bit tired of ‘Malfoy’, honestly,” Potter said. “Is that alright? If you mind, I don’t have to.”
“Muscles of steel—”
“Get laid, Thomas,” Pansy snorted “Anyway, it’s my turn. Ronald, truth or dare?”
“Yeah, fine, thanks,” Harry calls over his shoulder as he shoves everything away in one bag and manages to stand. “You know how—”  and oh
“Harry wants to make love to him,” Hermione admonished. “He wants to take Malfoy on picnic dates and feed him breakfast in bed, isn’t that right, Harry?”
“Have you read the—”
, yes,” Malfoy says far too calmly. “Harry Potter’s star-crossed romance, so on and so forth. Dashing title, isn’t it?”
“Alright, Harry?” Pansy called from the register. He grinned as he made his way up to the counter.
People were parting down the center of the street, but there was no procession like those held when the king came through. They were only making room and showing respect.
“Idiot!” Hands were at the collar of his shirt and shaking him violently. “Useless, stupid, tosser! You absolute bloody cockup, are you fucking insane? Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid! Can you hear me yet, Potter? Can you? How fucking dare you— no, don’t touch me, I say! Don’t fucking touch me— I’m talking to you, you daft arsehole! Utterly useless, reckless, infuriating—”
“Harry. Harry Potter.”
But then Harry sucks in a short breath, and his lips part, and he’s kissing Draco back. Warm hands come up to cup Draco’s cheeks and
He rushed around the counter, snatching his wand up along the way, and grabbed Harry’s still-outstretched hand, yanking him quickly out of the room. He slammed the door shut on their way out and whipped his wand across it in a complex figure-eight. A golden net rose to the surface of the door.
“Can I... think about it?” He heard himself whisper. The words hung between them in frosty clouds.
“What are
“Look where my choices got me, Potter.”
Draco was quiet for a minute. “Like a date?”
“Just fuck traditionalism, I guess,” Dean’s comment brought Harry back to the game. “I've always thought Purebloods were more… conservative.”
“How shall I return Pumpkin to you?” Harry asks. “Can I set him down, or…?”
“—as friends. Because my intended date ran out the door before I could even get his address.” Harry’s still smiling, and then he reaches out and takes both of Draco’s hands in his, and Draco can’t even think. “I know it’s a little far-fetched to assume you’d be interested in me, Potty Potter and all that, but are you? A little?”
“Draco Malfoy, will you marry me?”
“Oh my fucking Merlin, he’s asking you out!” Cho shouts over the cubicle wall. Harry and Malfoy both jump.
“Draco! Hi!”
“Liar,” Draco whispered.
They pause at episode four to order Indian, then promptly remember that everything is closed and have to settle for instant ramen. The wine is gone by then so Harry pours them both pineapple juice. Draco’s pretty sure that if this were a date—
“Are we seeing the same story right now?” Harry asks. He’s really not getting the reaction he wants— from himself or from Malfoy— and he just needs to be sure.
“Here,” Harry said on instinct, unwinding his own scarf from around his neck. “A real above-average act for you. Some knight-in-shining-armor stuff right here.”
“Try me.” He narrowed his eyes.
“Ok,” Draco nodded. “Can I have two, ah, three days? Just— to think.”
.” He wiped at a cheek he hadn’t even realized was wet in frustration. “There was— is— a man who used to stay in our village. He came almost a year ago, he stayed above the bakery.” He could feel Riven’s tension, but he had to speak before he lost the words. “He used to visit me at the market. He was the first to bring me wildflowers.” Draco’s throat was seizing up. “He was strange and frustrating. He made me laugh, he always wore a cloak that drowned him. Everyone thought we were headed somewhere. I suppose I believed them. Suppose I was also wrong."
“And that’s enough reason to ask me out for coffee?”
Draco didn’t seem surprised by the question, just disappointed it had finally been asked. His brows tilted up and his mouth pressed tight, and Harry had never wanted to hold him close more than in that moment.
. “I want him to—I don’t know, say
They’re in the gardens at the Manor, somewhere back past the lily ponds but before the rose bushes and the fields. He can’t even see the house from this far away, and it makes Draco feel a bit fae, a bit enchanted— the only thing around is flowers. Harry bumps into the low hanging wisteria and they both snort as petals come drifting down around them.
Draco really doesn’t understand what’s happening. He’d resigned himself to a lifetime of solitude and misery. This turn of events is messing with his head. “What about Ginevra?” he finally asks.
Queen Lily had other ideas. “You’re too kind. But we cannot accept this. Will one hundred silvers be enough?”
Blaise rolled his eyes none too subtly at his friend’s antics. “Rather than continue making a tit of yourself, you could help me get these necklaces untangled.”
“Staples,” Malfoy says out of the blue. He looks like he regrets his volume, and it occurs to Harry that he probably feels just as uncomfortable. This is the first time they’ve spoken beyond polite greetings in four years, and neither is sure what to expect. It makes Harry feel better, somehow, to know that he’s not the only one feeling utterly wrongfooted.
Well, perhaps if he did a good enough job of this, he might have some hope of redeeming himself in Draco’s eyes. An act of penance and all that.
“Gentlemen,” Malfoy says cooly, and Harry thinks his cheeks must be the color of Malfoy’s hair.
“So what else have you been doing other than baking?” Harry says when he comes back. “My mum’s hung this horrid cross-stitch in my bathroom because she thinks that’s an appropriate quarantine hobby and I just want to make sure you’re safe from the horror of bunnies with top hats.”
He’ll tell Potter just a little later, about the bond and their relationship. For now, Draco just lets himself be held by his mate, sinking into the feeling of wholeness, of completion. It’s enough, now that he has a chance at forever.
The queen pursed her lips. Draco wondered if he had overstepped.
“I want in his
Fuming, he turned to the last place where he knew he’d be sure to get some peace and quiet. He trudged through the familiar corridors and up spiraling stairs upon stairs with a solemn sort of resignation.
Harry didn’t know what to say. Draco’s eyes were wide as he himself struggled to put together a sentence, no doubt as shocked as Harry, if for slightly different reasons.
“One dashing young rogue,” Blaise said. “With eyes like emeralds—”
“I—no, not really.” Malfoy frowned, picking at a thread on Harry’s scarf. “There’s a lot of that around Soho lately. That’s all well and good for Pansy, but I’d rather men didn’t buy me drinks just to fuck me.” He hesitated just long enough for Harry to feel bad about buying Malfoy drinks while thinking something just along those thoughts. “Sometimes I’d rather they lend me clothes when it’s cold out.”
“I need to talk to you,” was all he said before turning and walking back down the steps. Draco glanced around in confusion before slipping into his boots and pulling a cloak around himself. He called to his mother that he’d be a minute before following Riven outside. The prince was leaning against the wall facing away from him, but turned presumably when he heard the crunch of snow under Draco’s feet.
“I’m going to have my lawyers riding your arse so hard, you won’t be able to sit for a week,” Harry says.
“I dropped it!” Harry pushes away and starts looking around desperately. The box lies by his knee, but the ring is nowhere to be seen. Draco watches in growing disbelief as Harry peeks under bushes.
, curse the word. If he asked to court you would you agree?”
The house was warm when Narcissa welcomed them inside with tears and smiles. Dinner was warm too, with far too much laughter and happiness hanging heavy like perfume on the air. Riven was warm when he hugged Draco by the door, whispering goodbye and his love.
“Please, Draco. I could never be angry with you, I only want to help. Whatever that means, whatever you need.”
“Will do, sir,” Harry said. He’d long since learned that Robards rarely meant half the things he said, including favorites like ‘you’re fired’ and ‘pray a Death Eater finds you before I do’. When there were no more insults forthcoming, he quickly made for the door, shutting it just in time to hear the thud of a paperweight against the wood.
Harry didn’t deign to give that a response. Draco had finally shifted, turning just enough that Harry could catch the way his hair fell over his eyes while he spoke. His eyelashes caught in the strands with every blink, and he tossed his head as if to shake his fringe back into place, hands busy with the papers in front of him. Harry wondered how soft his hair might be—if Draco would enjoy having it brushed, if he’d like someone to run their fingers through it. Or perhaps he’d want Harry to pull it, forcing his head back and baring that long line of pale throat. Harry bit his lip at the picture that made, quickly schooling his thoughts into something a little less likely to get him kicked in the bits by Ron.
“I wasn’t going to.”
. Still, Draco hadn’t given him any outright rejections. Every screwup seemed to stem from circumstances and Harry’s own inability to think with Draco in the room—there was no indication that Draco was averse to (or even aware of) his efforts.
“I wasn’t serious.”
“Maybe he’s thinking?” Ron offered.
“What about you freezing to—”
“I think you’re beautiful,” Riven looked awfully perplexed for a lunatic. It was a shame he really was quite handsome. “And I’m asking you to marry me. Have I been unintentionally unclear? I thought I was rather blunt.”
,” Draco said, a bit louder this time, and it vibrated through Harry’s chest.
“You didn’t.”
Harry frowned. “Well, if you take your time and know what you’re doing, yes. I’ll go over it a couple times.”
Hermione, Harry decided, was both the largest advocate of active listening and simultaneously its worst practitioner. She had her head stuck in a file when he arrived on Floor One to fetch her for lunch, and she stayed glued to her paperwork all the way through the Ministry, oblivious to Harry’s inner turmoil.
“Since you ‘feel this way about an idiot like me’, right?” Harry was still grinning like a loon.
“Does
“I’m fine, never better,” Harry said, in what he hoped was a casual tone. Ron snorted beside him, so to emphasize the casualness of how fine he really was, Harry slipped his arms into his pockets and leaned back against the wall.
“It’s nothing. Just unfounded worries.” He took a breath.
On Thursday, Draco hurried past Harry’s desk on his way to lunch, only sparing a brief moment for a subdued, “Hello, Potter.”
Harry snorts, then laughs before he can help it. He likes Draco’s message and that should be that, but this feels ridiculous. Draco’s right across the hall, two walls over, and it’s already half past five. Harry manages ten seconds of bad decision making before he caves.
“Harry,” Ron said seriously. He shifted his chair so he was breaking Harry’s line of sight, and clasped his hands in a businesslike manner. “I’m going to say this once, as your friend and your partner. Ask him out, or, by Godric, I’ll file for a reassignment.”
“I was trying,” Harry says against the corner of his mouth. “We’re on the same page that this is somewhat, sort of, in some manner a date?”
“We’ll be fine, love,” Pansy said. “We’ve both run the stall before.”
like he was interested in the bus—the bus that was meant to carry them far, far away from one another. Eventually. After a half-hour ride, of course.
“So,” Harry says instead, “Auror work. Are you looking forward to it?”
“You better not be, after everything else.”
When he made it to his desk, however, the first thing he noticed was the look on Ron’s face. Harry had never seen him express more than one emphatic emotion at a time. But today his frown was dejected, guilty, and sympathetic all at once.
“No, er, this is my first time out in like two weeks, to be honest.” Harry’s thrilled with the conversation, truly, but that news does get him a bit worried.
“Granger, that’s fascinating,” Draco sneered. Harry winced. “Really bloody genius, in fact. I’m ever so grateful you shared that tidbit information with us. Now if you’d be so kind, leave my soulmark to me.” He spat the last part out as he untangled himself from his blanket and stood. “I’m going to bed. This game is childish.”
“Oh, no problem,” Harry says quickly before he can even consider where he’s supposed to get cat food. “Is there a particular brand or anything…?”
know by now?” Harry asked, resigned. He supposed that’s what he got for approaching Draco so often these past few weeks, but he’d hoped things were still in the vague rumor stage.
“I’d really rather we were both sober for this conversation. It’s pretty clear I cocked it up last time.” He grins sheepishly at Draco, his smile all crooked.
“You know,” Ron said, “usually people say that when they want someone else to fix their problems for them.”
He makes it four blocks before he realizes he hasn’t locked his door, there’s no bus needed, and the turn to Sainsbury’s was two blocks back.
“What?” Draco coughed. Blaise shot him another look. “No, of course not. Why?”
“No,” he stammered. “I couldn’t.”
“You’re lucky I came,” she said, already starting to help Blaise with the display cases of rings. “I got held up at home, and the crowds were hectic, that’s all. You should go check on your mother.”
“No, he means it literally.” Hermione seemed to have gotten her bearings again. “There's a second half to the symbol. It's a mark of duality.”
He’s acting entirely serious, and Harry has to take a deep breath to keep from ripping something—namely, the paper staring up at him.
But the air was cool, the Soho lights were glowing red and pink and blue from down the street, and their little bus stop was empty save for a soggy newspaper and what looked to be a dry and happy rat. Harry hadn’t gone over to investigate—there was plenty of room for him and Malfoy at their end of the awning, thanks very much.
In the same way that he’d never been able to follow his own train of thought back from conclusion to origin, Harry would never be able to explain how he ended up at a bus stop near Leicester Square with Draco Malfoy. The things that stuck out to him like pins in a corkboard were the softness of Malfoy’s hair under streetlights, the cold brush of wind-born rain against his cheeks, and the way Malfoy murmured happily, “Hackney for you too? I’m near Dalston Junction. We can catch the thirty-eight.”
Ron doesn’t seem inclined to help him out.
Then there were the other deaths. Around him, people were still crying, some from wounds and others from grief. The dust was settling but the air was still thick with the static of spells. If he had believed in muggle Hell Harry would have vowed that this wasn’t it. No one deserved this.
“Oh,” Harry said miserably. “Thanks for the honesty.”
Harry finds him behind an obnoxious glass desk on the top floor of an equally obnoxious glass building. There is an array of succulents spread on the left edge of the desk and a silver MacBook rests on the right. The center is crystal clear in every sense of the word, offering a view of leather-clad legs, and Harry briefly entertains the idea of smashing that ostentatious desk cleanly in half.
“Currants!” He shrieks directly in Harry’s ear, and it’s a wonder Harry doesn’t slap him. He does yank his hand out of Draco’s grasp and stumble his way out of bed, cursing a blue streak.
Harry didn’t bother reminding him that he was, in fact, twenty-four, and several inches taller than Robards himself. He just stared at the far wall and tried to think of lovely things, like what Draco’s jumpers might feel like and whether or not he liked watching the stars at night.
“Speaking of people showing up,” Blaise commented idly. “Have you seen Harry recently?”
“I’m not on duty,” Harry snaps.
“What do I know?”
Harry found out later, to his utter dismay, that Draco had dined with Zacharias
When a knock finally did sound at the door and Draco flung it open, however, Riven did not step inside. He looked tense, his hands clutched tight at the edges of his fur cloak, his head down.
“Is there someone already in your life? It wouldn’t offend me. I’m only satisfying my own curiosity.”
“Wanker.”
Disappears again. Fuck.
“Yes,” he managed to get out before Harry claimed his mouth again, his overjoyed laugh getting swallowed up in the process.
“The only thing that would hurt me is seeing you in pain,” Riven said quietly. “Tell me what’s wrong.”
“Of course,” Harry lifted his hand and ran a thumb slowly over Draco’s chin and up to trace his lip, marvelling at the fact that it seemed he was allowed to. “But you know we’re not an ‘if’, right? This one thing, this can be certain. I’d like that.”
“Well,” Mother said, looking around the room once more. “It appears I’ve stumbled into something, and I’d rather remain unaware of it. Scorpius, would you like to go to the park?” Though she spoke to Scorpius, her eyes caught Draco’s, and he nodded his approval.
“You know that doesn’t matter to me,” Draco said, giving his most sincere look. Thinking back on his earlier brainstorm with Hermione, “Have you told him yet?”
Harry dropped his utensils, took a deep sip of his drink and leaned back. “That’s a loaded question.”
“I don’t know what homeschooling means to muggles, but in the pure-blood world it’s the equivalent to muggle conversion therapy,” Draco explained, while Treasure finished the cigarette, emptying the filter into a nearby ashtray.
Draco navigated the towering piles of fabric with the ease of having been to Guillaume’s Bespoke Tailoring many times in his adult life. He suppressed a smile at one overturned heap; the latest customer had obviously not had the same amount of luck.
“That
“I have a
“Well?” Harry asked.
was the reason he liked Mondays so much.
Draco stabbed a piece of butter chicken. “Of course he’s cute, he’s my son, after all.”
Harry sat on that question for a moment. “Come to think of it, yeah. They bring it up every time we get together. Your point?”
“See?” I point.
Draco frowned, not sure why his proffered answer upset Harry so much. Shaking his head, he moved onto the next question. “Have you dated any men we might know about?”
“Really?” Her hands paused in laying out the cartons of take-out Chinese.
“He doesn’t want to steal me away, Mother,” Scorpius inserted the knife. “Trust me.” Twist.
The boys play a drinking game, Baz and Simon reveal their enemies-to-lovers backstory, and no Draco's not taking notes why do you ask that?
“Definitely not,” Harry says. Running his hands through his hair. “It’s not fair for me to tell you his story while he’s not awake to defend it.” He remembers the origin of this line of thought. “But you’re not wrong. Perhaps there was always something deeper to my suspicions.”
Draco cleared his voice. “I hate to interrupt the flirting, but what’s the plan here?”
“Um,” The server interrupted. “Can I take your order, please?”
“So, where were we?” Pansy asked.
“I’ve been demoted to my maiden name?” She asked, her tone sharp but her hand trembling on the champagne flute.
, my heart sings, and I give him a smile against his frown.
“Do you want to ask me questions?” Potter prodded.
“Truce?” Harry offers.
He smiled back. “No. Sometimes, when you’re handed a win, you just take it.”
“Hi Harry, Mr. Malfoy. I think it’s about time for bed,” Teddy said.
“Except for… that,” Baz’s blush stains his cheeks; he’s recently fed.
“Your magic resonates on a different frequency than ours.” Turning to Baz, “That is likely why you are unable to access your magic here. It cannot locate the normal markers. There is nothing for it to grab hold of.” She faces me. “I cannot say for certain, but you are not entirely non-magickal, Mr Snow. Wings and tail aside. But I would hesitate to call you a wizard, or a mage. No, you are something rather more instinctive. I would be curious to know the particulars of the spells your Mr Mage used to give you magic; I suspect it altered your DNA somehow. The capacity to do magic, in your own way, is still inside but it appears dormant.”
Harry has a gift for Simon and Baz.
Draco nodded, and, without another word other than the spoken name of his home, left Harry behind.
Draco shot him one back, hopeful it didn’t contain the level of concern he felt. “Are you sure you’re ready for this?” He asked.
” Draco nearly tripped as he extricated himself from the barstool, grasping Harry’s arm. “This will teach those two-timing sluts to walk out on us.”
Feeling brazen, Draco scanned Potter from his feet to his head, letting his pleasure show on his face.
“Wish and you shall receive,” Draco mused, before bringing the tray to the table in front of Scorpius.
“Potions class, of course, requires no innate magickal prowess. It does help at times, such as lighting the fire under the cauldron or stirring, but even a Squib can manage basic potions.”
Harry allowed Draco to fall to the ground with an undignified grunt.
Hogsmeade day! Featuring: butterbeer, blood lollipops, George Weasley, and, you know. Other things.
“About time!” She’d basically shouted. “Do you think Astoria would allow you a more active role?”
But when Hermoine met with Potter, that was a secret she never shared.
Things seemed to be calming down, so of course this was when Mother arrived.
Astoria laughed. “Yes, right up there with elbows on the dinner table: discussing genitals before dessert. Not exactly the pinnacle of pure-blood etiquette.”
Harry smiled. He took Draco’s hand, drawing it to his chest.
used to have god-like displays of magic.
Harry had tried to stay out of it at first, leaving the arrangements to Ginny instead. Until he figured out it was Draco with whom they battled. Then, Harry took a lead role in negotiations. He relished the back and forth conducted second hand through lawyers. He picked fights over details he couldn’t have cared less about, to Ginny’s increasingly dismayed reactions. Perhaps his ignoring her wishes had been the final nail in the coffin of their relationship.
She laughs abruptly, then coughs to cover up her errant chuckle, “Go to class. I assure you, I am well-qualified to maintain their safety.” Harry stands, his hands clenching and unclenching at his side. In a softer voice, “Mr Potter. I promise. No harm has befallen a student this school year. I intend to maintain that record.”
“To Draco Malfoy, the gay uncle I never wanted,” Harry raised his glass.
After her departure, Scorpius excused himself to change clothing, leaving Harry and Draco alone again in the living room.
Also, I will accept suggestions for crossover experiences. If there’s something in particular you want to see. I can’t promise it’ll make it in, but I’ll certainly try!
“Just think,” Draco told Scorpius. “When you hit third year, you’ll be able to tell your classmates you’ve already been to Hogsmeade.”
“You want me to answer or do you want to take this one?” Simon asks.
Draco smirked, “Think of it as a middle finger.” Ignoring Harry’s curious gaze, Draco led him to the X only Draco could see. “All right, Harry. Click your heels together three times and think of home.”
And with that, the three of them found themselves in Hogsmeade.
story broke.
“We’ve received no official comment from either Mr Malfoy or Mr Potter, and the Acropolis Wedding Resort refuses to respond to owled inquiries. However, anonymous hotel staff have confirmed that the two men spent several hours drinking in the hotel bar and have yet to request room service--”
Harry drank from his self-refilling cup, leaning against a brick wall while Draco and Treasure sat in plastic patio chairs and shared a cigarette. “Tell me the story of how you two met.”
“My hero,” Draco drawled.
This was it. The moment Harry could choose to be brave again. He forced his arm to cross the distance between them, grasping Draco’s hand in his own. “You don’t have to be.”
Maybe if he had, Harry wouldn’t be drinking alone on his wedding night.
Then, we’re spelled apart.
“Weird,” Simon twitches his lips as if swishing mouthwash.
so much.”
It’s only then that Draco glanced up at the entryway to the kitchen, his mother watching intently.
Harry glared.
“Now now,” Draco warned. “Don’t make me a relative. After all, I have many kinks but incest isn’t one of them.”
“What’s two inches?” Harry asked.
Hangovers, lift rides, and Draco's Career Options.
Hermoine leaned forward and placed her hand on Draco’s forearm. “Draco, is it,” She swallowed. “Is it bringing up bad memories?”
But despite her support, he still didn’t know what he wanted in his career, or what to do about Scorpius.
Simon looks up, like he’s forgotten the other two men were in the room. “Oh yeah. Well, his mom visited me.” After a beat, “As a ghost. She’s dead.”
“Did I do something wrong?” Harry asked.
Harry laughed. “Oh, Draco. I’ve never said this out loud before but,” His eyes drug the length of Draco’s body before settling on the tantalizing bulge of his crotch. “I am so, so gay.”
To Scorpius’s credit, he appeared to be more awed than repulsed by the saggy, elderly house elf worshiping at the feet of his young master.
Draco eyed the beautiful liquid that would cure his headache with undisguised lust.
“Of course he did.”
Draco worried how he’d get Scorpius through the Floo, given their complete lack of communication so far. But Scorpius seemed to listen to his instructions, even if he didn’t look at Draco or respond beyond a slight head nod when Draco asked if Scorpius understood.
Yes, despite Draco’s hatred of the book and subsequent avoidance, he knew that cover like he knew the grip of his wand.
“Come on,” Harry interrupts their fuck-me-eyes. “How did you get together?”
He gives Baz a pointed stare.
“Hmm?” He answered, looking back at the two staring faces of his friends. “Oh, sorry. Did you remember I was here?”
“What?” Harry said, unintelligently as always.
“Actually, I was kind of hoping you’d take a look at something else as well.”
She nodded, eyes wide with anticipation.
Harry nodded. “I’ve already made my decision, and I’m not interested in sitting on it any longer. Plus, this way I can keep you and Scorpius out of the papers.”
They took pity on the girl, who seemed barely old enough to have graduated Hogwarts, and ordered drinks, white wine for Draco and a Firewhiskey cocktail for Harry.
In some ways, Draco’s counters to Harry’s points felt like the dying gasps of an opinion he no longer held. Seeing the look on Harry’s face about a boy needing his father… well. Maybe Draco related to that a bit more than he cared to admit.
,” Draco begged, transfixed in the entrance by the horrifying notion.
Harry picked the book up, stroking the cover almost reverently. “You’re not a fan of this book, are you?” Harry asked.
With a growl, Draco pushed Harry back on the bed, attacking his neck with teeth and tongue and
, Potter. You didn’t grow up with parents who taught you to value ambition over all else.”
Pansy topped up Harry’s mimosa. “Sweetheart, best to let him get his pout over with. From someone who has sucked his cock to someone who
“A new boy.” She waggled hers back at him.
“Of course,” Mother said, kneeling down to take her grandson in her arms. “I’m always here for you, you only have to ask.”
He inhaled. “Work, please.”
Scorpius and Draco looked at each other, and Draco got the sense that both he and his son were wondering the same thing: if the other wanted to spend time together. As the adult, Draco decided to leap first. “Thank you, Mother. That’s exactly what I’d like.”
The hauteur revived Draco from his Potter-induced stupor, and he smirked, then spelled away Harry’s glamour.
Blaise so…” She ended her sentence in a shrug.
Smiling at Guillaume’s exasperated tone, Draco peeked to see what sort of customer was driving him mad today. And promptly lost his breath at the gorgeous, half-naked man on Guillaume’s stand. Dressed only in a pair of black pants, the tanned limbs flailed as Guillaume’s magical measuring tape wound its way around the man’s lean and muscular body. Draco’s eyes had barely taken in the sandy blonde hair when a familiar voice escaped the strange man’s mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco tried not to let it bother him that Scorpius’s current proximity was due in large part to Potter’s influence. “We went to school together. We met at Hogwarts.”
Draco inhaled sharply. “
“I told you, Story. I’m happy for you. You don’t have to convince me; if he’s your one, I’ll stand by whatever decisions you need to make.”
Harry shrugged. “I may or may not have bribed one of the employees to give me a heads up whenever a story about me is going to hit.”
He rolled his eyes. “Salazar, Granger-Weasley. I consent to this hug. Now come over here and mother me properly.”
“Oh, Potter, you almost make me regret I’m a married woman,” Pansy purred. “Except, by keeping your hair I can fuck you
“Well, uh,” I clear my throat. “I mostly just meant the tied up part.” I press my hips against his to prove my point.

“Chocolate chip waffles!” Scorpius cried with a fist pump. It was hard for Draco to remember the sullen, quiet boy he’d been upon first arrival.
Malfoy scoffs.
Draco sat up straighter, dusting imaginary dirt off his tailored robes. As if he didn’t already know he looked fantastic.  “Lavender, have I mentioned how gorgeous you look today? I’d ask if you’d done something different with your hair, but, come to think of it, you always look rather fetching.”
Harry allowed the victory. Draco could win the battle; Harry had his eyes on a bigger prize.
“Lavender said the same thing,” Draco said. It took him a second to realize what he’d inadvertently done, and less than a second to turn the tables and revel in the awkwardness he’d introduced to the table: Hermoine trying not to look petty, Ron trying not to look guilty. Draco pressed his luck. If he was going to be forced to talk about this book, he might as well have some fun with it. “In fact, she thought the main character sounded kind of steamy.”
Harry responded with a shrug, the animal. Draco ignored the tingling sensation on his nose which was certainly from leftover butterbeer bubbles and nothing else.
Draco loved Lavender but he
“Thanks?” Draco asked.
Simon opens his mouth, like he’s going to mention I’m flammable, but I shut it down with a leg pinch.
“For your sake, let’s hope so,” Pansy said, her eyes darting over to Draco. “Draco, would you mind giving Potter and I a few minutes alone? I need to ask him a few questions.”
Simon blushes a bit, and nods.
were obsessed with Harry Potter?”
“Then
Draco sighed. “I know you’re not trying to be difficult here, Harry. You just want to protect this little piece of privacy you have left. Probably one of the few things the public doesn’t know about you, right? It feels sacred, this secret, and it’s not like anyone has to know. Unless,” Here Draco fixed a curious eye on Harry. “Unless there's someone? A reason you’d need to come out? A relationship?”
A crowd of rambunctious 20-year-olds piled into the bar, filling up the empty seats with shouts and laughter. Draco ran his hands through his hair, tousling it from its normally immaculate state. Eyeing the setting sun, he said, “Perhaps we should go home. It’s been a long day, and I could use the solitude.”
, Hermoine. It’s the ethics! It’s the morality! It’s putting a golden spin on an evil man and the evil men who followed him!”
“We weren’t keeping it from you. It’s just not something we share with anyone,” I explain.
Draco swallowed.
Potter gave Draco a curious look, and it dawned on him that Potter had not actually been privy to Draco’s internally monologued tale of potentially poisoning the three most famous wizards in Great Britain.
Draco nodded. “I think I have enough to work with.”
Harry woke in the morning to the familiar sensation of someone cuddled in his arms. He thought of Ginny and instinctively pulled back. But when he saw blond hair instead of red, Harry paused in his retreat. Draco snuggled deeper into the crook of Harry’s neck, releasing a sigh of content that Harry’s heart met with a clench. Not even trying to stifle the surge of protectiveness that surged in his chest, Harry brought his hand up to the base of Draco’s neck, carding his fingers through the silken strands, and bringing his lips to Draco’s forehead in a chaste kiss.
It’s sad to think I don’t have the kind of magic
“Yes, of course, Potter,” Draco huffed. “How else am I ever to fill up the scrapbook I purchased for the sole purpose of documenting our probably insane venture into mutual like?”
“What?” She said, pausing in her handover to gaze at him curiously.
“Hah hah, Draco. Very funny. Now please, I can barely breathe in this thing.”
broken
Pansy scanned Harry. “Seriously, Potter. Let Draco do you this favor. You won’t regret it.”
She gave him a knowing stare. “I suppose for some people that’s especially true.” Then, she sipped her tea. “But even though I had Harry’s, I needed my own approval to feel truly ready for the job. So I put myself on trial in my mind and cross-examined myself until I felt objectively sure I would accomplish great things.”
Draco watched Scorpius pause for a second, give his father an unreadable glance, before tearing away from his breakfast.
“Yeah, I know, the wording didn’t quite work out, did it?”
“A boy.” He raised an eyebrow.
“No,” Draco countered. “Better make it Italian. Frankie’s?”
The ‘or something else’ lingered in the air, but Draco dismissed it. “Scorpius, would you want to—” But Scorpius is already halfway to the monkey bars.
“Draco,” Harry said. When the other man wouldn’t look up, “Draco!”
Draco barely had time to wonder.
Pansy tutted. “Oh, you mean
“Huh,” Harry said. “I hadn’t noticed, but, yeah. Looks like it’s provided us with a gentle wind.” He smiled. “Neat.”
He shrugs, then waves for me to continue.
“This is why you wanted Scorpius to stay with me,” Draco said, pressure in his chest building. He felt anger, grief… gratitude. “You wanted him to build a relationship with me before introducing him to your boyfriend.”
“Kreacher must apologize for not having more options, Master Draco. And for not serving you at the formal dining table. Kreacher was unaware,” Here Kreacher shot Harry a venomous glare, “That he would have the honor of serving a member of the House of Black today. In the future, and with better notice, Kreacher promises meals more fitting of your station.”
“Fine. When you’re ready to flirt, let me know,” Draco winked.
“Hmm. What did you have in mind?”
“Pick it up,” Draco commanded, and he watched Harry comply without complaint, his finger falling on the change that had upturned Draco’s life.
She pulled back and tutted. “Seriously, did you get any sleep at all?”
A small snippet of life after the happy ending.
She hums but doesn’t respond; outside her office, she’s adopted a more commanding tone. Still, I’m sure she’s committing the fact to memory.
Draco smirked, his face a vision of triumph. This one battle had been real where the others were fabricated. From the day Harry learned of their shared wedding venue, the one thing he’d wanted was to secure the penthouse for his wedding night.
When their Headmistress pulls us by our metaphorical ears to her office, I’m again floored by their brand of magic. So is Simon, who watches Pranking Parkinson
later. In the meantime, Boy Who Went to Therapy, tell me: why am I perfectly content being Granger-Weasley’s secretary, when I could theoretically run my own department?”
“How do you burn a pancake?” Harry asked, his chin over Draco’s shoulder in an intensely familiar manner.
Fuck.
She kissed him again, right in the spot he’d just cleaned, then settled back in her chair. “How about we alternate? One week on, one week off. That’ll give you a chance to build your relationship, while we ease Scorpius into my new one.”
Especially when the Baz in the mirror smiles and the Baz in my arms leans deeper into my embrace. It’s like I have two of him, but it’s still not enough.
Harry opened his mouth as if to say something, then closed it again. Draco rolled his eyes.

“Weasley,” Draco smiled. “Pleasure as always, though I didn’t know to expect you.”
A small weight lifted off his shoulders as he recognized the nervous tick they both shared. Pansy was a bitch. A bitch who bought inappropriate books for his son and invited his whatever-Harry-was into her home. But she was his oldest friend, after all. She could be there for him. Despite the intruder.
Blaise shook his head, his normally dark skin pale and grey. “I read the book twice, and there was nothing like that…” In a whisper, “Are you saying that really happened?”
He relaxed his jaw a fraction, then poured himself a cup. Pansy raised an eyebrow at his detente, which Draco ignored by flopping down at the table with a dramatic sigh and throwing Scorpius’s copy of ‘The Wrong Sider’ face down at Pansy. Then, he waited.
“Really, Snow?” Baz asks, turning toward me so I can see his trademark eyebrow raise and sneer.

Simon shakes his head. “To think I followed you there, thinking you were plotting my demise.”
“That quack of a professor!” He declared, still shouting although they were now the only ones in earshot on the vast grounds around them.
“But you do against his reputation? His house?”
“H-Hagrid… it’s illegal to own dragons.” Neville whimpered like he was really wishing he didn’t need to point that out, eyes positively bugging out of his head at the creature in front of him as it turned and warbled in a distinctly baby-like way for a lizard at the Gryffindor when it heard him speak.
Less afraid he was going to rip up his supposed family heirloom, he went to town morphing it different ways until it suited him a bit better. He kind of liked the idea of a cloak but it being invisible was a real downer—it

And Professor Flitwick is incredibly nice, although he did fall off his stool when he read my name.” Harry babbled happily, tacking that last part on with a frown. He’d been mentally debating telling the tiny professor to call him Monroe like he did with everyone who made a big deal of his famous status, however Flitwick got over it pretty quickly, so Harry had let it slide.
then his parents loved him, but they did not know him.
“So. What was it?” He questioned lightly, referencing the book Theo had spent that visit so interested by.
He thought in numbers because that was all he could do. Two hours before the Dursleys woke up, four dreamless sleep potions left, eleven calming draughts, ten days before the stasis charms wore off on them all, ten weeks before the next school year started, seven more books until he’d read through his stockpile of textbooks to take his mind off things… he could go on.

that though… Harry had done a little tour of the nearby compartments to scope out the kinds of people he’d be going to school with and get a vibe for what kind of people were in each house. He hadn’t clung to Neville but the boy had trailed after him, saying he’d never found a compartment to sit down in since he’d been looking for Trevor this whole time. Harry didn’t mind the company as Neville… well, hadn’t made a sound other than trail after him and quietly answer when spoken to—he
“You can jump right in—we’re just stretching a bit before we get into it, and then doing some drills to start. This is the beginner’s group so you’ll find people of all levels here, and then once you get comfortable enough you can go join those crazies as you like,” She explained, nodding across the pitch where the other group was already mid-mock game and Seamus was already shouting something unintelligible from this distance.

“Yes Mother; see you at three,” Draco slipped away from his parents without much further ado and suddenly Harry found himself being dragged by the sleeve of his invisibility cloak through the crowd, Draco seeming to know exactly where he wanted to go first.
“I mean probably, if you’re not overly bookish.” George allowed. “Aside from Creatures those are the two hardest by far, among most of the classes Hogwarts offer even, and also the classes happen at the same time I think.”
Harry did not know what possessed him to blurt out the truth like that, but he couldn’t regret it when Draco’s pale complexion when a steady shade of creamy pink—the tips of his ears darkening to a heated rose.
He was very, very covered and it got every hair on his body standing straight up. Nightmares that had stolen weeks of sleep from him seeming to echoing uneasily in the corners of his clouded mind and got his heart pumping far too hard. His breathing wasn’t coming out right, though he only vaguely recognized that.
“Except McGonagall.” Harry corrected, and at his questioning look continued. “She listens to me when I talk Transfiguration and actually responds as if I’m an equal. Think that’s why I like her so much.”
“People take the house rivalries way too seriously.” He muttered darkly under his breath. “If Gryffindor keeps acting as prejudiced as the Slytherins, I’m going to start rooting for Hufflepuff.”

Being a werewolf-sympathizer means you won’t be getting any public jobs and no matter what reputation you have in Slytherin, most of the house won’t deal with you. Get the picture?”
He enjoyed it quite a bit, and he took the time to read at least some of the papers Axeclaw had given him. Most of it was financial terms he didn’t get and would have to look up, so he started making of list of terms he’d need to understand before he did much with this information.

So, after a reasonable amount of time Harry poked and prodded Hagrid with Neville’s help until the man collected himself enough to put his handkerchief away and be lead from the third floor as quickly as they could cajole him to go.
“I don’t need a fancy palette to know eating sugary wax isn’t pleasant.” The Gryffindor shot back.

It wasn't like he ever ate with the rest of them anyway, and they didn't consider salad food at all (a 'precursor to food' Vernon had once called it, rather poetically) so even if they did see him setting aside some leafy greens or other vegetables, so long as his chicken or beef or other 'main entree' helping was sufficiently tiny to their standards of what he 'deserved', they were fine.

Be it the iron-clad grip he now held on the blond’s arm or the tone he spoke with promising a thousand painful deaths, or maybe even the fire he felt in his eyes as he turned and commanded Draco’s now too-forced-to-be-natural blank gaze to meet his own… whatever it was, the blond was still and shut up to listen.
He had his own journal out in front of him, but as he brushed the feather end of his quill over the page languidly as he considered taking a note, he quickly realized he wasn’t hearing anything Binns was saying to even know what the write.
The only thing they had in common was that they were formidable opponents or allies to have, and that the Dark Lord had never tried to mark the two as his before. No one in either of the two families had a dark mark on them, but the reasons for that were not exactly similar.

Dean and Seamus knew they were on the pitch and came down to meet them later in the morning to join in, and since it was obvious they hadn’t heard yet, Harry had decided to graciously fill them in.
His first weekend at Hogwarts passed in a haze of gold, and Harry loved it. He did manage to get his homework done, but it was a close thing when Draco kept wandering outside to enjoy the weather and explore the quidditch pitch, walk around the whole lake to inspect every little rock and creak along the way, and then spend the hours in which the sun cast long shadows across the expansive school grounds sitting high up in the pitch seating and explaining more about his favorite sport.
And woke in a dark shed, breathing harshly and wondering numbly if anyone had heard him.
Harry grinned with more confidence than he felt, wondering how

“And we can’t have that, now can we.” Blaise smirked, flickering his gaze to the very distinctive locks atop his head that Harry made no effort to pretend he wasn’t very proud of. Vain, even.
“Yeah. All of it was news to me though—my relatives aren’t mentioned once, yet had all these people in it I’ve never met.”
“Of course I am!”
Having spent an exorbitant amount of time in the bathroom but fully pleased with himself and feeling better about the day, he slipped back out and was amused and saddened to see no one else had even twitched in their sleep yet although the sky was lighter outside and sunrise was probably within the half hour now. With a sigh he went back to his area and sorted through his clothes, quietly putting things away in his wardrobe

As expected, the younger woman frowned deeply.
Essentially, the basics of Transfiguration she taught them as they started getting the hang of more difficult spells last semester, is that a Transfiguration spell was influenced by bodyweight (a), viciousness (v), wand power (w), concentration (c), and a fifth unknown variable (Z) that was kind of a ridiculous answer when you were talking about literal math.

He wasn’t really one for journaling unless it was for a class like Draco had taught him to but thought he might want to give it a try for lack of better options over the summer. He clearly knew he’d be bored out of his mind without practical magic, classes, politicking with the Slytherins, quidditch, or football to distract him—he knew he’d have chores, shopping, and cooking galore to do but he could do that blindfolded at this point so it wasn’t

“Ya got yer firs’ potions class then tomorrow. Prepared for it?” Hagrid chirped conversationally, and Harry played for time by taking his time on his sip of tea—a huge task given the size and weight of the massive tea cup.
, he mocked himself mercilessly as he scratched the paper a little too hard with his quill as he told Draco about how he was tired from chores which is why his handwriting was so shaky—not the lack of food making his hands tremble like a tuning fork. He’d lied and said he simply got his chores done quicker so he could write during the day. He’d lied through his teeth when he said Hedwig was just mad at him for not needing her this summer thanks the journals which is why she was over at Malfoy Manor permanently for now.

but he forced himself not to beam anyone in the head this time. As he whipped around though, there was flash of heat in the air that caused Ron to take another stumbling step back, bumping into an upper year walking behind him.
“Would it be possible to sell of the furniture and clothes in there? I wouldn’t even know how to start doing something like that and would think Gringotts would be experienced in liquidating people’s assets.”
“You were closer to death this time, but so far as fixing your injuries this go around was much simpler. Cuts and blood replenishing spells are easier than broken bones, and the complexity last time was your organs. No punctured or popped orangs this time, just a lot of cuts and bruises, no matter how serious they were.” She explained calmly.
“Yeah, my shoulder just hurts,” he lied immediately, not willing to get into the guilt he felt itching at his stomach. He hadn’t had any regrets since coming to Hogwarts… actually, no, he hadn’t had any regrets since he’d decided to be on his own side, refusing to let anyone manipulate or beat him into following any path that wasn’t his own.
“He doesn’t want to keep it a secret, so why are you?”
What was still a bit unsettling about his mother’s line though, was the linear pattern he’d noted before. Most siblings, if ever there were ones, were faded lines instead of names if even he could see those faint lines at all. There was thick bold ink over his and Lily Potter’s name, then his grandmother Mary who married a Robert whose name was… well it was clearly

The twins’ parents seemed nice enough. Mrs. Weasley had even sent him a Christmas present last year, so despite probably going to be far closer to Ron than he’d like, he also be getting closer to the twins which wasn’t bad at all. They might be willing to help…
“Of course they do—the house teams play against each other. Commuting to international wizarding schools to play quidditch is excessive outside of the professional league,” Draco sniffed.

Speaking of, at just about 15 minutes from the point they’d need to leave in order to wander around this castle and find the right classroom, and the Great Hall was very much full of students who were essentially done with their meals and chatting away happily, McGonagall began going down the Gryffindor table handing out time tables. A minute or so later, Ron finally made his appearance with a very annoyed looking red headed prefect practically dragging him by the ear.

Albus had not always done right, by Poppy. She’d disagreed with many of the things he’d done, but she was retired and here to care for the children of this school, and despite it all Albus had always had the same ultimate goal in mind despite how much she hadn’t liked some of his choices or actions. They had spent so many hours over the years discussing what to do about children that needed help out of their homes, going over the painful details about how or why it was possible or impossible to save one child or the other… and always she’d thought him just as heartbroken as her when it became clear someone
“We’ll leave you to it; let us know how it goes.” Dean waved them off happily as Blaise practically dragged Harry back to snake territory in eagerness to see whatever it was Harry had up his sleeve go down. Harry waved back at his roommates, particularly a rather baffled looking Neville.

He was thin. Not like lithe and delicate thin, but a slightly too boney and pointy thin. Thankfully you could barely notice it in his face despite it being definitely not as round as it used to be after all of Hogwarts’ feasts last year. It hadn’t been nearly long enough without food to make his cheekbones stick out too much, but his neck and his collarbones gave it away instantly. The shadowed dips of his collarbone in particular and the hollows of his shoulders were so unnatural they caught the eye, and it was pretty obvious what caused it. Reluctantly taking his shirt off to take a look, he also saw it on his ribs and in the dips of his hips. Luckily not

They stayed out and played for several more hours, and slowly but surely the football club learned where he was—and also started to hear the rumors themselves so joined in not only to play but also confirm for themselves that the rumor was true. Luckily the club at least had long since gotten over their hesitation in just talking to him themselves—he wasn’t a celebrity or some strange creature, he was part of their club and got just as dirty as the rest of them playing games. He missed goals and got outrun by better players and also gloated playfully when he made a good steal or a successful goal, he wasn’t a teacher or an authority figure or anything more than a

to stay out of sight and hung around the train station until the next train to London came in.
“Oh my god, Theo are you okay?” He was very convinced that Theo was going to faint in a second but as he took a step to move towards him, Draco jumped up and got in front of him again, hands instantly on his shoulders and shaking him slightly—and it startled enough that Harry just let it happen in surprise.

Draco blushed and huffed out a sigh. "Fine I suppose you are right as always, Mother. But what about the press? I do not want to be the reason why Harry gets assaulted by them. Can you imagine the article titles? I am sure they would use "Death Eater Corrupts the Wizarding World's Saviour" as a title or something very similar to it."
For some reason that confession seemed to be the final straw that broke Blaise, because he gave up trying to squash Draco and literally sunk to the floor in absolute

I like Hogwarts, everything is very happy and playful what with the twins and everyone able to goof off. I think… you, trying to get everyone to talk to each other between houses last year has been actually working you know. What with the football club and people making friends between houses… I mean there’s only been like two big fights between Slytherin and Gryffindor that I know of this year and I’m pretty sure it was a daily thing this time last October.”

I mean, before you get to Hogwarts it’s not tracked as it’s considered accidental magic, but then once you go to Hogwarts they say you’re not allowed to use magic at home but in practice it’s only ever enforced at muggleborn residences. Which means I can practice magic all I want over the summers and yet muggleborns can’t.”

He didn’t plan on messing with his health just because these potions tasted like actual vomit in any case. If they could magically fix him and get him back into shape enough to play quidditch in only a couple short weeks, then by all means he’d down a hundred of these nasty things.
He admitted that he’d always liked how Harry was unrepentant and accepted the ramifications of how he acted with never-ceasing grace, but now that Draco realized Harry would happily accept

to an unbelievable level that quickly turned into something like fire racing up his wrist as the blade cut much deeper into his skin of his palm then he was expecting it to, and Harry forced himself not grind his teeth together but instead take deep breathes and try to center himself. Yeah it hurt but it wouldn’t soon, so he just dealt with it by clenching his other fist so tightly he felt his fingernails pinch into his skin there sharply.
Harry could figure that lack of an answer out pretty quickly though.
Blaise seemed unwillingly to get chummy at first, be it the Malfoy reputation or something else, but he was a chatty person and he had a sharp wit that couldn't be contained, and so Draco was his only outlet. By default it got them on speaking terms at least, if not even on reasonably friendly terms too.
“So… they just didn’t let you

“That’s a horrible idea.” Theo commented almost conversationally, and Harry nodded in total agreement.

Or, it did, but not the hair he thought was his for half a second.
And frankly Harry wasn’t interested in continuing it at a better time either.

Neville looked at him like he’d grown another head. “You

He must’ve figured the punishment wasn’t worth the hassle of lugging himself out to the shed to even bother, when he could tell his parents to order Harry to come inside and they’d do it in a heartbeat.

horrible something must be, but who had lived a very sheltered life so far and therefore even his most creative fantasies were pathetically, naively tame to Harry’s reality.
Harry wasn’t going to concede the war so easily though; he could choose his battles just as carefully if need be.
Neville lifted his head slightly as if hopeful at this prospect, but dropped it quickly before he could meet either of their gazes—especially the girl’s who was now staring at him expectantly. He probably didn’t have the nerve to ask an upper year for this favor and the girl’s insistence was probably the only reason he’d let himself be dragged around disrupting every compartment on the train. And he was going to be dragged around some more if her expression said anything, and he wasn’t going to enjoy it one bit.
“What the heck!? I like to keep it covered—and keep your hands to yourself please.” He was just this side of outright snapping at this guy but tried to keep his composure as he waved his arms to get him to lean back in his seat, on edge and watching his hands now in case he tried it again. He wasn’t
“What?” He shifted a bit uncomfortably in his seat, and she elaborated.
“Draco is probably mad, huh?” He asked his owl as he stroked her white feathers rhythmically, and the look she gave him implied that was probably a bit of an understatement. “Hedwig…”

“Because my better friends don’t need to bribed to back me up when I come up with crazy plans.” Harry cut the sharp tone off in a second, Neville remaining perfectly quiet on his other side as they left the castle and walked down to Hagrid’s hut and letting him deal with Draco’s complaining. Said Slytherin’s cheeks turned a rosy pink in indignation that Harry would dare say that, but green eyes cut off his report with a glare before he could attempt to respond to that.

And just because I’m nice, I’ll tell you about a special little subsection of the list that took the pride of being part of the 28 to new heights—meaning the families that were so tyrannical about being pureblood that actually resorted to inbreeding within their family just to avoid anyone they deemed contaminated with muggle blood. Those would be the Blacks, the Lestranges, and the Gaunts. I would
Draco blinked at the sudden change in conversation, but just furrowed his brow to try and remember.

“There never was a will reading, and there won’t be one unless you can’t read or specifically request it. Will readings are an old practice put into place in case not all attendees were literate and needed to have it read to them. It’s an ancient practice, and some wizards insist on it for some reason but on the most part those who are grieving a dead relative don’t want to rehash it in public. Nor does Gringotts like the spending of time in such a way.” He explained, and Harry calmed a little at the explanation.
as he looked at himself in the mirror and realizing he’d never just looked at himself in the mirror…he found himself going at least one step farther than he ever would've before, and embarrassingly enough a good portion of it was because of what he thought Draco might see in him when they met up in a couple weeks. He caught himself too many times thinking of what face Draco would make to see this or that… and had to quickly shake it off, reminding himself he was doing this to be

He was so out of it, but he pressed his palms into the grass beneath him, marveling at it’s smell and it’s fantastic color.
Harry was 100% ready to do just that, but then suddenly he remembered he had to do something. He couldn’t quite remember what it was, but his whole life he’d had practice forcing himself out of bed if he had something to do, because it was usually doing some chore for the Dursleys and if he
Blaise, of course, noticed immediately what he was doing and grinned like that wolf he was when he’d pointed it out.
“Hogwash!” Hagrid burst out, causing Harry to jump a bit in surprise. “What downrigh’ ‘orrible muggles—yer Lily and James’ child and ya don’ even know wha’ they look like! Absolute cobswallop!”
Remembering a bit too late why he wanted to be in Slytherin, he snapped his head back over to the other side of the hall and seemed to lock eyes with a gray gaze, somehow finding him immediately amongst the crowd. Draco, for all his boasting of Slytherin’s cleverness, was very easy to read… and his big eyes were clearly disappointed. His smile was real and he was clapping, but Harry saw he’d been holding out to the hope that maybe they could’ve both been in Slytherin.
“You’re pale as a sheet.”

He even tried to finish the night off on a high note with treacle tart but the sugar on an otherwise empty stomach just made his headache worse.
“Right… I didn’t want to know. Not sure I want to know even now…”
and Blaise dodged—but Draco was clearly training hard to be on the quidditch team because he had him by the back of the robes and then they were just shoving each other, bickering quietly with Blaise trying to finish a sentence and Draco kicking him to make him shut up before he could.

cared like he was pretending to, so it could only be condescending and frankly Harry just didn’t have the time for it.

magic was more valuable and lucrative than being a jack of all trades. He’d have to see how the rest of his classes went this week, but Transfiguration had promise.
But in the mean time… he needed to at least try to get out himself.
Now, he was fully, completely sunk into said trap, and he suddenly felt a wave of helplessness about that.
Whether Mr. Malfoy noted that or not, he gave nothing away as he answered.

tell if the flap of material on the back was supposed to be a hood or not but he certainly made it one. Satisfied with that, he turned towards the color and was pleasantly un-surprised to find it just as receptive: he lightened the dull hue until it was mostly just that beautiful iridescent silver with rainbow hues tossed in. Honestly it looked like an oil puddle in a parking lot after a rainstorm, but it was somehow beautiful when it shone subtly on gracefully rippling fabric that seemed light as air and gracefully slippery like wisps of smoke.
Thursday was a bit hazy as he recovered from his brainstorming session, but after Potions on Friday he felt refreshed enough to start back in on his work and the break really had cleared his mind to give him a new perspective.

Harry might’ve given him a pass if he were doing it for conniving purposes, like a Slytherin would to get ahead—to each their own ambition after all. However the sheer distaste on Draco’s face meant he probably wasn’t doing it for reasons a Slytherin would actually approve of.

Hufflepuffs would be less interested since they were content to study themselves and not panicked to get top marks like some other students, unless they were fifth years before their OWLs and they didn’t exactly want or need detailed notes on first-year topics when there were bigger fish to fry, so to speak.

She didn’t respond though, and after a beat of silence Axeclaw answered instead.
He knew “Malfoy Manor” where Draco lived was kind of obvious, but he thought the “il Nido” that Blaise called his house was just the Zabini heir being dramatic as hell. “The Burrow” was a less scary name for sure, but he hadn’t pegged the Weasleys as being one of those purebloods to

Actually talking about it seemed… so hard, right now.
“I want to bring something up that’s probably going to cause controversy, and also the Minister will try to bury it by any means necessary if he can.” He admitted rather hastily and not shockingly she semmed a bit taken aback.
“Professor McGonagall!” he chirped, grinning as she came around the curtain to his hospital bed. It was probably lunch break Monday judging by the time, and Harry felt pretty much healed apart from the fact Pomfrey wasn’t about to let him go until tomorrow—or the fact his arm was still bound up so tight he couldn’t really use it
“Yes, I’ll write it out but you’ll need to take a two types in the morning, one before bed. I will also send you along with a couple dreamless sleep potions, and several calming draughts as I said.

I’ll also write out a list or reputable shops and brewers I would suggest buying from if you can.” She explained gently.

And what a farce of a study session it’d been: he wrote a letter, Theo was clearly just staring at his notes while thinking deep thoughts over this new development, and Harry hadn’t even pretended to not be just listening to the snakes and writing things down in his journal that gave all three of them extreme anxiety every time he did so.
The Malfoy heir seemed to give it some serious consideration… before giving in with a sigh.
No… no, she was fairly certain she understood Gryffindors.

Severus winced as the thought finally formed—the one he’d been avoiding thinking of for weeks now.
Two letters a day and Harry decided it was entirely worth taking the risk on Draco—he seemed entirely unwilling to talk about his family’s history or his parents in general, and Harry was content to avoid those topics too. Instead they kept to light topics, Draco explaining about the wizarding world and Harry explaining about the muggle one, talking school and hobbies
The older woman’s eyes flickered, the tight line of her lips dropping a bit. “You didn’t hear the announcement?”
Goblins were fair.
“They did. Which, would imply there’s nothing amiss.” The boy looked triumphant and Minerva knew she was going to have to resort to honesty here. She stood before his desk pointedly and he paused in his victory to pay attention to what she was going to say. “To be frank, Mr. Potter, even though it seems to be fine I am still concerned you’re pushing yourself too far, for no good reason.

Harry had spent a long time fully believing his parents were drunks—nobodies. He consciously knew that wasn’t true, ever since the day he met Hagrid the first time. Ever since people around him started to speak about his parents, and not only that, but they spoke about his parents with gentle,

to see a familiar blond head a distance in front of them, with a group of two others all wearing green and silver ties come up from an inconspicuous door that seemed to lead down. He remembered Draco mentioning the Slytherin dorm was in the dungeons and was wondering if he’d ever get a chance to sneak in and see it for himself because he wondered how they’d keep a place like that warm. Magic probably, be he was curious none the less.
“Harry,” He was ripped from his thoughts sharply by the headmaster who was still by his bed, and had a grandfatherly expression on his face that Harry instantly hated from the sheer concept that he assumed it was more patronizing than caring. The old fart didn’t even know him after all, there was no way he

when they didn’t speak for weeks, and he figured out how to get around it—he was off fighting his own battles with Slytherin’s politics in any case, and so Harry didn’t have to think about him all too often other than to enjoy his presence when they were together and slowly piece together his ‘operation fox’ idea. Harry could be himself with Draco, which meant he could live his life the way he pleased, Draco doing the same and living his own life, and the two of them would still be there in the moments they wanted to enjoy each other. But neither of them had to
a morning person. His preferred sleep schedule would be somewhere between 3am-1pm, if not longer given the chance, but he forced himself to function like a relatively normal person so as not to miss meals and, since coming to Hogwarts, classes. People always assumed he was a lazy if he slept in, despite the fact he probably got more done after midnight than anyone else his age, but he was still trying to build his reputation amongst his peers so he attempted to wake at normal hours when he could.
“It wasn’t your fault the barrier broke at the worst time possible.” Harry forgave him with a slightly more earnest smile. “Although I should thank you too, I mean… I didn’t know them, but I knew they were right on the other side of the barrier and were kind of the only adults I even semi-trusted at the moment so…”

“No more cruel than life has been to him.” Poppy gave a glare for all she was worth, her wand not so much as wavering. Steady as only a medic’s hand could be. “I am a healer. I will do what needs to be done. I cannot face Albus on this, he has too many connections—and I taught him occlumency myself so I couldn’t even get through his mind if I tried. You however… your mind is too open and if he is getting information on Harry through you, do not dare think our years of friendship will stop me from protecting a child.”

“Why not?”
"Teach?" He repeated, confused.
Harry was thankful that Draco didn’t even hesitate or pause to give his admission of weakness any more attention or importance than necessary as he took a pinch and tossed it into the fire. Harry just hung onto his arm closely as they spun once more into the fire.

Severus had very little left to be truly loyal to. The most he enjoyed another person was Draco, who was oblivious to his dark past and continued internal struggles and looked up to his godfather for his potion making skills alone. Potions had always been his fail safe—he’d been the youngest potions master in history and his genius at this art was one of the only things he had left, so the fact his godson looked at him and didn’t see a weak death eater, a Dumbledore pawn, a terrible teacher… but simply a good potions master… that was enough.

He huffed, letting his head rest on the trunk and Hedwig nipped gently at his ear curiously.
“Hagrid definitely will, and I’d be shocked if all the professors weren’t made aware before breakfast tomorrow.” Harry pointed out. “There isn’t really much we can do for tonight.”

Seamus was forgoing digging in but took a bite of his bacon with a conflicted, thoughtful look on his face. "…guess you're right." He eventually got out with a bit of patience on Harry’s part. Eventually he seemed to come to some conclusion and shrugged. "Getting along with them sounds like a lot less effort than hating them too, 'specially if we're going to have a bunch of classes with them."

“I—uh—yeah! Thank you!” he perked up, taking a few seconds for his brain to stop short-circuiting but then getting back to it at full steam. “That’s so awesome, I was so excited to meet you!

Today was no place for emotions. He had to get this done, he had to obtain an insane amount of information in only a couple hours, and he could not back down or chicken out like last time when he’d read his parents will. He was going to be surrounded by Slytherins who would think nothing of a blank face and calculated questions.
Harry felt

“Shit, that means we lost.” Draco did some quick math, and realized it was actually close but with that deduction it was definitely a loss for them—and

You could always tell when they’d had enough, as their leaves fluttered a bit as if waving off any more for now.

didn’t want to know.
Blaise blinked out of his thoughts as the stands around them picked up in volume, and only a couple seconds later the announcer for the day was booming his voice across the pitch, announcing the teams. Ah, it was starting.
“Harry!” Draco eeped in shock, but automatically wrapping his arms back around him in a hug. Harry was thankful he didn’t instinctively get hexed for his moment of impulse because he knew the Slytherin was definitely more on guard for personal attacks than hugs in general.
Hedwig had put her leg out for him to tie the letter to but when he froze, she put it back down and hooted in annoyance at him.
“…so?”
True to what she’d heard, Sirius’ cell was with what could be considered the ‘highest priority’ prisoners. She recognized many as death eaters, but made sure not to visibly turn her head towards them. Checking the few cells before her target, she saw many lifeless bodies sprawled on the ground of the dingy, bare cells. Either in sleep, exhaustion, hopelessness, soulessness, or death—she didn’t know and if they weren’t eavesdropping on her then she didn’t care.
He both figuratively and literally exploded in their faces; unbeknownst to him that snapping sound he vaguely half-heard in the back of his head was actually his magic cracking under the force of extreme stress, and it unleashed itself in the form of an intense heat wave that crackled the once-green grass around them into slightly crispier, browning lawn. His anger and rage not only felt unbearably hot while trapped inside of him and demanding an outlet, but it also

Harry just laughed in his face as they made their way out of the Great Hall. The only reason he felt comfortable telling Blaise about Fluffy now when he’d kept it hidden last year was that Hagrid had told him he’d actually moved Fluffy into the Forbidden Forest now that he was no longer needed to protect the Philosopher’s stone since it’s destruction. And
He didn’t know for certain what the figure had wanted, but his instincts told him his death would’ve been high on its list of priorities, and Harry was not one to ignore his instincts as they hadn’t failed him yet. If that thing could kill a unicorn, a super-fast ultra-magical being of pure goodness, then a measly first year was probably easy pickings.
“What… were his war crimes?” He couldn’t stop himself from asking.
Draco paled.
"No offense Apples, but it’s a bit tiny and sparkly for a supposed grown man’s hand-me-down." Fred pointed out, him and George having regained themselves somewhere in their conversation.

He could tell his year mates thought he was insane when he walked into History a couple minutes late with a mega-watt smile on, although only Neville had the good sense to just sigh and ignore it as he slipped into the seat he’d saved beside him. He didn’t care though, that was far too much fun.
Honestly, he just needed a day.

He needed to have more power in his house, because if he had power, even if people disagreed with his choices they wouldn’t go speaking behind his back or excluding him like this. But how the heck was he supposed to get power? He was a first year for god’s sake, and he’d already dug himself into a fine hole less than a month into the school year. His family had money, yes, but from watching Blaise he knew that would only get him so far. The Malfoys were the richest in the country of course, but the Zabini family had old money, which seemed to stretch farther and in more areas of the world than just magical Britain.

usually connected to his bubbling temper problems that most students got to see in full detail in one way or another over the past school year. Almost no one ever had accidental magic problems once they got their wand and started using it, as that outlet was supposed to calm the bursting magic growing inside of you with no proper way to be released into the world. Control or not, the fact he still had issues like that at Hogwarts, no matter how minor they were, spoke to the size of his magical core and everyone liked to bring it up when they could even if he didn’t care about it at all.
“Speaking generally, I wouldn’t say Ravenclaws are
“Yeah same. I know what I want, no idea how to get it.” He gave another put-upon sigh and shot him a vaguely annoyed look that made no sense to Harry at all. It wasn’t the first time he’d been given that look though so he let it go. “Guess we’ll have to work it out.”
Thankfully the goblin didn’t care and had looked it up, and told him in no uncertain terms that one of the charters of Hogwarts was having a legal guardian—to attend you needed to be (1) magical and of the right age for an appropriate magical core size, and (2) paying the tuition and agreeing to follow school rules, one of said rules being that underage students

He bellowed as loud as he could, getting a foot up thanks to Vernon holding him but his arm to plant his foot in the man’s stomach and kick for all he was worth. It probably wasn’t that hard given the state he was in, but the man was fat and probably thought a push up was a type of bra for how fit he was. The bulbous man gasped in shock and dropped him, and Harry felt panic mixed with unwarranted hope flood him as he hit the ground and tried to run.
"That's amazing; magical medicine is truly a miracle." He was actually very stunned at the total lack of evidence of what was a pretty gnarly injury, before grinning up at him reassuringly. "How's the nerves though? Still interested in learning to fly?"

At least it was refreshing to see Draco leading the charge and people actually fall in line, as despite how bratty he acted he never actually got his way all that often. At the very least Harry could admire how Draco was confidently leading a Gryffindor and two well-known pureblood heirs into snake territory and he didn’t even seem remotely concerned about what he was facing.

Still, Lucius would have to do more, but this was a decent start. And predictably, it helped Draco’s position first—and Severus was certainly not complaining about it helping his own either. Even if the expectation was that he’d use it to protect his godson, but he’d been planning on doing that anyway.
He wrapped up his Contrair Alley shopping at the hairdressers, because he figured it’d put him in a good mood to finish off the day.

“Speak a little louder Weasley, people in London didn’t hear that.” He snapped out of his thoughts to see Draco glaring at Ron from across their little group huddled before the doors, pretty much everyone eyeing the two uneasily. The ginger-haired boy was turning a dusty red color while Draco was doing his somehow-looking-down-at-you-without-being-taller thing again.
“Harry, I love you. Marry me?”
“Are they silencing charms?” He wondered aloud as he didn’t bother sitting just yet, unabashedly just turning around to inspect the room more as the snakes just watched him in amusement.
People like Flint though…
the mental voice tisked.
Severus needed to pour himself another round just to get through the clouded thoughts that senseless wish assaulted him with. Of all that could’ve—

, by the way. Something called a feather-light charm that meant no matter what he put into it, it didn’t feel any heavier than when it was empty, a protection charm that would have it hold up for a guaranteed thirteen years, and a security charm that would shock anyone who tried to forcefully remove it from him in addition to the it’s-there-again-every-morning charm that was on his pouch. It was also magically semi-bottomless, the saleslady explaining that the space inside of it was as big as a “quidditch pitch” both length/width
. He watched Draco go with one last parting smile and something wry in his muddled gray eyes. By the time he turned around again though, three of his new dormmates were staring at him with eyes like saucers.  "What?" He demanded.
Her smile could’ve cut ice as she brushed down the front of her robes briskly. “Turel informed me when she tended to your wrist that it wasn’t the only injury you have on you. I asked you to stay for tea because I’ve also summoned our family healer to see to you more thoroughly.” She inclined her head gracefully towards him. “And you will not resist.”
than he had in a long while—less out of breath going up Hogwarts’ many stairs, able to go longer in the football club, even taking walks around the lake to breathe in the fresh air while the warmer weather lasted. The most critical potions were definitely still the dreamless sleep drafts though—he always had a calming draught on him but hadn’t actually needed to use it for quite a while with everything else distracting him in a day.
“Huh. I think I like Severus for that reason too. Even when I was little and he was just starting to teach me potions, the fact I was like six didn’t excuse any mistakes I made and he’d treat me like a real student, not just a kid.”

and were not going to tell him, and after their talk this afternoon he now knew
cut, it was not in anyway unreasonable either.
Draco’s eyes lit up when he heard potions and he forgot to keep his sulking posture as he sat straighter. "Well as I said Snape is my godfather and I know him pretty well. He loves potions a lot but he can be pretty sour in personality sometimes, and despite how good a potions master he is he's kind of odd as a teacher. Just be careful and take things seriously in his class and I think you'll be fine."
Not a good day to realize he recognized those symptoms.
The first years all missed it, but the upper years who were still shamelessly listening in and hyper-aware of the first year Slytherin sitting at their table for the first time in…
He wanted to tell Draco not to be embarrassed, because a small part of him was actually
Harry couldn’t get his thoughts together, but Petunia’s face crumpled into something nasty and bitter and acidic and she hissed at him.  “Just
“Draco, there are some abominable muggles in this world. Muggles who fear those more powerful than them react in fear and aggression most often—that is why the statue of secrecy is important even if we are more powerful. Their sheer numbers and the kind of brilliant stupidity they can come up with when panicked and riled up is truly remarkable.”
Blaise pressed his lips into a thin line and turned to Draco dryly.
“Axeclaw!”
"I've met a cute snake or two in my life." He allowed coyly, turning his back on them to keep walking. Or he would’ve if Draco didn’t have a coughing fit beside him, catching his concern. “You okay?”
Nothing would fix this.
Pleased with himself he looked around the class, most of the Slytherins were waiting patiently with their brooms already in-hand and the few others who Harry had guessed were purebloods seemed to have confirmed this for him by also being experts at this already. As he watched, several others finally got their wiggling brooms on the ground to lift shakily into the air and reached out their hands to grab it—one or two stragglers still had defiant brooms on the ground and one person’s broom hadn’t even twitched.

Draco made a face. “It’s a stupid rule, but even Father doesn’t find it worth making a fuss over it. Mother is always scared I’m going to break my neck or something when I go out flying so that’s probably why. Anyway, just because we can’t have brooms doesn’t mean we can’t fly—there are school brooms I think, and flying lessons first years can take.”

There was that saying, where when you were about to die your entire life flashed before your eyes, but Harry found that to be surprisingly untrue. There were tons of things he probably should’ve been thinking at that moment as the wand inches from his eyes flickered with magic, the sinking defeat he felt convincing him for one long moment that he was going to die, the sickness from blood and pain that dug fiercely into every part of his being…

The other, which a defeated George held, had deep grey accents while the overall color was a bright and cheery mint.
The funniest part though was that Draco was clearly going to argue that before visibly halting mid-thought and reconsidering, and then getting super annoyed when he couldn’t actually confirm that
“Hm… maybe I was right about the blibbering humdinger after all.” Luna commented lightly, and Harry gave a weary sigh as Colin howled in pain at his still-defiant broom below them.
"We've got five siblings, two of which are younger and one who is a priss who never liked to fight dirty. We can cool it for now until we're all a bit better," One of them had said when Harry warned them not to blow over the many first and second years they were playing against. The only other third years on the field were in the beginner's course, after all. They seemed genuinely okay with taking it easy and not going all out too, but then again Harry hadn't met anyone quite as playful and laid back as the twins, so he didn't worry too much about it

Apart from those two houses, he made a concerted effort to try and get to know Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff too, but the Ravenclaws weren't really into talking about much other than books they read or classes, and Harry could contribute to a point but was quickly out-paced the times he tried to join their study sessions in the library or in their groups they hung out in while they waited for class to begin. They weren't against speaking to him, but if he couldn't contribute to the intellectual conversation going on he was glossed over in the course of the conversation, and it happened a lot. He was earning himself a reputation with Transfiguration, and of course Lu and his year mates seemed to be all in to chatting about things other than academics at times, but it was slower progress with that house than he’d thought it be.
he could figure out a way to prevent actually being expelled if the Malfoys protecting him—again, Draco was spoiled so while he himself had nothing to offer to his parents in exchange for their help, if Draco asked for something he would definitely get it even if that meant going against the Ministry. They’d been a dark family until recently after all, it probably wouldn’t even be that hard for them.

Now though, he was starting to realize something as Neville used one finger to lift the tip of his watering can spout up to stop any water from hitting the plant he’d been about to dunk in fresh rainwater.
. Given that Hagrid was his #1 fan he kept that thought to himself though.
The healer seemed to get it and instantly backed off, now on the other side of the chair Narcissa had recently vacated, putting her wand on the seat cushion and putting her hands up. “Hey, kid… Harry—I didn’t mean it, I’m a bit of an oaf like that but I’m not actually gonna stun you, I just get a lot of tough kids to deal with. Draco is your friend, right? I’ve treated him his whole life, used to have to threaten hanging him by his toes from the tree outside to get him to sit still most days.” She let out a smooth flow of words at an even tone, and Harry couldn’t help but imagine a tiny Draco being an even tinier brat than he currently was for this rather gruff woman, and against his will found it a bit amusing.
The blond looked quite relieved at that, his tense shoulders dropping a bit. “Sorry… for grabbing you. I thought you were going to walk away,” he admitted with a flush of embarrassment. Harry rolled his eyes and plopped back down on the bench, tugging on Draco’s sleeve to get him to sit down beside him too.

Either way, with Harry as her protector then Luna was going to be safe from house bullies at least, but her overall life would be far more complicated. Not that she would care, but Lu was not stupid enough to think he wouldn’t get caught in it eventually.
The plan was simple, for as stupidly ballsy as it was.
Of course they’d very subtly eavesdropped on that conversation—they would not be Slytherin parents if they didn’t— but it really told them nothing they didn’t already know or suspect. Having some things confirmed for certain was nice, but it only meant they really should be doing something about this now, and as they exchanged blank looks with one another, it was clear they were on the same page.
“Hedwig they didn’t let me out since you left. It was the whole summer practically… it was so dark.” He all but whispered as if it were shameful, and she cooed lowly—bumping her head into his gently.
There was only so much worrying you could do alone though, and it’d eaten at him all break until he finally set eyes on Harry to see he wasn’t dying in a puddle somewhere, but even though some of his fears were soothed it wasn’t nearly as fixed as he thought it’d be. He just… wasn’t sure how things were actually broken or how to go about fixing this thing that he couldn’t put a finger on in the first place. Given his parents utter lack of commentary on meeting Harry earlier that day, he knew they were up to something as well but probably had way more awareness of the situation than him which was kind of annoying.
Slytherins were the ones who kept to themselves and gleefully let those around them sink or swim depending on how well that individual traversed the dreadful waters of the world. Gryffindors were supposed to act first, think later—and usually they were thinking with their foolhardy hearts, which only made them so easy to manipulate.
