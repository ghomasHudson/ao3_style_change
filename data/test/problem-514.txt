Planning began again after that. The Ministry had to be put under the Dark Lord’s control, and they had to find Potter. Many suspected he had been secreted away at an Order hideout but no one could agree where, and it had been four days since Potter had slipped from the Dark Lord’s grasp. Many felt that time was running out, much like the Dark Lord’s patience.
Bathilda was stumbling around the room, lighting candles clumsily, her fingers fumbling with the matches. Draco had to tread lightly as the carpet seemed to be caked in thick dust and the room smelt of mildew and damp, like it hadn’t been aired out in a very long time. Potter’s nose wrinkled where he still stood by the door and Granger looked like she wanted to gag. Potter stepped forward and muttered something Draco couldn’t quite hear from where he was standing, and then he took the matches from her and lit the candles.
,” they chanted as they went in a wide circle, Draco meeting Potter shoulder-to-shoulder at the end. Granger stood in the middle of the clearing and cast some further charms silently, her eyes focused on the dome of the ward over them as her wand shot sparks of silver into the air which caused small starbursts to appear on the dome. It was unlike anything Draco had seen before, and he watched her, fascinated.
Above them, a wrought iron and crystal-laden chandelier swayed slightly in the breeze caused by the door slamming, and several portraits seemed to jolt awake in their frames, frowning in confusion. One of them, a tall, willowy woman with strawberry blond hair, gasped when she spotted Draco in their group.
“You’ll need to think of something happy,” Potter said, tapping his wand to his chin. They were two days away from their trip to Godric’s Hollow and Potter had decided that Draco should learn how to do the Patronus Charm, just in case.
They stepped back into the corridor, and it was clear that things had gone south in the minutes they’d been hidden away. The walls and ceilings trembled without stopping, dust raining over them, filling the air and Draco could see, reflected in the window panes, bursts of red and green light that looked close enough to the castle that it must mean that the Death Eaters were close to the castle now – too close. There was a roar and the giant brother of Hagrid that Draco had only had the pleasure of meeting not too long ago went past, swinging a stone gargoyle around like a club.
“And why would that be?” Hermione asked coolly, tilting her head – Draco suppressed a shiver, the gesture too reminiscent of his aunt.
“He really is,” Harry added, reaching out a hand to Draco who laced their fingers together and stepped in close. Longbottom studied their interlocked fingers for a second before nodding once and reaching out a hand to Draco, who took it.
"AND PLEASE, NO MUD ON THE CARPETS," Delphinia shouted after them, causing a rise of sound from the portraits around her. They ignored it.
He opened his eyes to a scene of celebration. He blinked and looked around – he was standing under a marquee strewn with fairy lights and flowers. There was distant laughter and the sound of glasses clinking together, but it felt like it had before – like his fingers were numb and everything was so distant.
“Think of everything you could do with it, Harry,” Draco pleaded but he could tell that Harry would not be swayed.
“Malfoy?” Hermione said politely as she approached and Malfoy looked up with a start, frowning. His gaze flicked between Hermione and Harry and his shoulders tensed.
“They won’t let us leave without a fight,” Draco told Hermione out of the corner of his mouth. She nodded.
“There’s only one other place I’ve seen that book,” he said and Granger perked up, interested again, “And that was in my father’s vault in the Manor. That book is
“There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,” Voldemort announced, holding the Hat aloft. “There will be no more houses. The emblem, shield and colours of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slytherin, will suffice for everyone, won’t they, Neville Longbottom?” he tauntingly asked Neville, who held his ground, his chin lifted defiantly. Voldemort pointed his wand at Neville and his stance became rigid and still. He took a step forward and forced the Sorting Hat onto Neville’s head until it slipped down below his eyes. Draco raised a hand to his throat as the crowd around him shifted, ready to move. The Death Eaters on the other side noticed, and raised their wands menacingly.
Hermione lay next to him on her side, coughing and shuddering and Weasley was on his hands and knees, panting, but Harry was already on his feet, breathlessly casting their usual warding spells, shuddering every now and then with the cold.
They held Harry steady while he jerked and moaned, and Draco smoothed back his damp hair, making soothing noises while Ron frowned at him. Draco gave him a challenging look and Ron gave him only a small smile in return, saying, “You really do care about him, don’t you?” Draco paused and then nodded.
“- an’ Dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter’s life, not his soul. He’ll be easier to kill if he’s been kissed first!” and from the other Death Eaters, there were noises of agreement. Draco sank back further into the wall and tried not to panic.
!” she cried and the noises Potter made were inhuman. Whether it was just his body responding to whatever he was seeing or the pain, Draco didn’t know, but he pressed Potter’s shoulders into the ground even as he jerked and writhed. Granger sobbed next to him and Draco could smell blood and flesh burning and Potter’s white eyes stared at nothing until Granger leaned back, retching.
An all-out brawl was building in the Great Hall. The bodies of the dead had been tucked away somewhere, who by Draco didn’t know, but he watched as another Death Eater and Protector of Hogwarts alike took up arms against each other. Neville let go of his arm to join in a fight with Fenrir Greyback, who bared his bloody teeth as Neville raised his wand. Draco raised his too.
behind him. With a wave of his hand, the fire in the hearth came to life and crackled merrily, casting the room into a warm glow as Harry sat down on the sofa. Australians put a lot of emphasis on casting wandless and silent magic, and he had learned a few spells in his time abroad.
failure, didn’t–” Father’s hand shot out of nowhere and smacked him hard across the jaw. Draco’s head snapped to one side and his eyes instantly filled with hot tears as his skin pricked with heat from the blow.
"Pardon me?" he asked through gritted teeth. Luna's hold on Harry's arm tightened. Belinda left the room fairly quickly.
“Barney Weasley. I thought he’d be useful in tracking Potter, but just my luck, he’s not heard from his cousin in years,” he said bitterly and Weasley coughed again.
There was the rumble of movement from many people and he stayed tucked behind the sofa even as he heard Slytherin house leave their dormitories. He waited until it had been quiet for a few minutes, and then peeked around the sofa – and froze.
He had dropped the boys off at King's Cross, but hadn't taken them to the platform, as he had been running late for a meeting with the other Heads of Department. He had bid them goodbye and then found a quiet place to Disapparate. Between then and when McGonagall had floo'd him, he didn't know what had happened. No one could figure out if the boys had managed to get on the train or not. Harry told Dumbledore about the scorched message, and Malfoy had conjured an image of it for Dumbledore to look over.
“It is customary for the Headmaster to extend his personal congratulations to the new Head Boy and Girl for their exemplary contribution to Hogwarts,” Snape began and Draco raised an eyebrow. “You have both been chosen as you represent the ideals of this school – hard-working, studious, the best of your year–”
“You see? Harry Potter is dead! Do you understand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!” the Dark Lord shouted and Ron and Draco spoke at the same time.
“It’s a cat – or a bird. If it was a Death Eater, we’d be dead by now,” he said and Draco had to agree with him. “But let’s get out of here, and we can get back under the cloak,” he said and Granger nodded. They set off again towards the gate, Draco following in Potter’s tracks until they slipped out of the kissing gate and back onto the icy pavement. Draco reached out and took Granger’s sleeve in one hand and slipped the cloak over her before doing the same to Potter on his other side.
He shook his head to rid himself of the memories and looked around at the maze again and the scarce stones laid down on it. Except – one was out of place. A line across the pale stone showed where it had been laid previously and set down, but the line was above the ground level now, looking almost as though someone had lifted it.
“Are they here? Mama, do you see them?” the little girl with bright red hair asked her mother, holding tightly onto her father’s hand and bouncing on the tips of her toes to get a better look.
“The opposite. I’m working to prove that being a Pureblood means nothing. That magic is a lucky combination of genes that anyone could have, and that while being born into a Magical family means you have a higher chance of being a Wizard, it’s by no means a guarantee. It’s actually been… quite liberating,” he said, pausing for a second to catch Harry’s gaze. They looked at each other for a long moment and then Harry looked away.
The plans were complete. Draco lay in the dark on the floor of the living room, running through the plans in his head again. Ron and Draco would be disguised by Transfiguration (against Harry’s protests that Draco should wait here, which Draco had fought back with saying that he knew the most about the Lestrange vault out of all of them expect the goblin,
Once Weasley was done, his nose short and broad, a thick brown beard upon his chin, Draco stepped forward and let Hermione work on him. He felt like someone was slowly dropping cold water down his neck as the Transfigurations settled over his skin one by one. His eye colour was changed to a warm hazel, his lips thinned, his white-blond hair turned dark and curly. Once he was done, he would look like a Potter cousin.
“No,” he breathed into the quiet of the utility room, his eyes closed, his head tilted back. He could feel his hair, past his shoulders now, brushing across his shoulder blades as he moved. Harry leaned away for a second and used his hands to pull Draco’s borrowed t-shirt up and over his head, dropping it to the ground. Draco took the opportunity to do the same, ducking his head to press open-mouthed kisses to Harry’s collarbones. Potter took a shaking breath and dropped his head back against the door, tangling his hands in Draco’s hair.
Draco woke with a start, sitting bolt upright. Someone was pounding a fist on his bedroom door, the door shuddering with each blow. Draco gasped, trying to catch his breath from being woken up with a fright, and picked up his wand with shaking fingers.
There was one perfect second of silence and then the tumult broke around the hall. The sun set the Great Hall ablaze as the crowd surged forward, Draco, Ron and Hermione at the forefront, running for Harry. They met him with arms outstretched, and Draco, desperate, kissed every part of Harry’s face that he could reach, yelling incomprehensible things in his ear as Hermione sobbed and Ron bellowed in victory.
Draco came back inside after a mid-morning walk across the beach with Dean to find the trio padding down the stairs back into the sitting room, grim looks on their faces.
“I’m just surprised. I never thought you’d have one,” he said and Hermione sniffed, lifting her tea to blow across the surface lightly.
“Could you get a fire going?” she asked Draco, who nodded and began to collect twigs and dry leaves from around them. He had to laugh at himself slightly – a year ago and he wouldn’t have dreamed about doing anything like this, but here he was, scrounging around on the ground for twigs and leaves and sticks that he could use to get a fire started without any magic.
“It’s better,” he whispered and Potter nodded, letting go of his wrist again as Granger came running. The pain came clawing back and Draco couldn’t help the animalistic howl of pain that came out of him, his back arching off the ground as his arm felt like it was about to burst into flame. Potter reached for him again and the pain went as soon as Potter touched him. “You,” he murmured and Granger was in the tent then, crouched next to him, muttering charms as she waved her wand in a figure of eight over his body. She sighed next to him and he heard her hair brush the side of the tent as she shook her head.
"Hidden Words spell, apparently. Why?" he said, and Malfoy shook his head. Harry looked up, watching Malfoy look over the image.
“I’m going to get a drink. Hermione?” he asked, and she asked for a pint of coca-cola if they had any. Harry hesitated a second but turned an enquiring gaze on to Malfoy.
. Draco shut the door on his parent’s unconscious bodies and tapped the door knob, locking it. He crept back down the hallway, his mother’s wand tucked into the waist of his trousers, his own wand held up in front of his face.
“Thank you for coming, Draco,” Snape said, fishing through the stack of letters on his desk, before withdrawing one and holding it out for him. Draco took it and slipped into the seat he had occupied the first time he had visited this office. It had already been opened, the Malfoy crest in peacock blue wax already broken.
“There’s no point getting pissy with me over it. Come on, think of something happy! What about stomping my nose in on the train?” Potter suggested and Draco scowled at him. A year ago, that memory would have sent Draco into fits of giggles, but now the memory was soured and felt strange to think of. He shook his head. “Nothing at all?” Potter frowned at him and Draco turned away, closing his eyes and thinking.
No, that wasn’t quite right. He was floating, insubstantial above the scene that played out below him.
“Why did you ask us to come with you, Mrs – Miss – Bagshot?” Granger asked, her own voice louder now, as though she was speaking to someone who was profoundly deaf. Bathilda ignored her entirely, turning slightly and shuffling back towards the hallway. With a jerk of her head, she seemed to be signalling to Potter to follow.
It had been quiet when Draco had visited with Pansy and Blaise in August, but now it was silent. Boarded up windows lined the street, the store fronts shuttered and discarded newspapers paved the cobbled road. From most lampposts and windows, Harry’s face watched from Wanted posters. Crouched in doorways, huddled together for warmth, were people dressed in ragged and torn robes, their faces in rictus’ of desperation.
“Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me!” Voldemort continued. “He intended that Snape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you, little boy – I reached the wand before you could get your hands on it, I understood the truth before you caught up. I killed Severus Snape three hours ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly mine! Dumbledore’s last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!”
“Did you say you got away from the Snatchers with a spare wand?” Potter asked Weasley after a moment of silence while Hermione studied the locket. He started and then pulled open his rucksack and offered up a slim, pale wood wand, handing it over. Potter gave it an experimental flick and the lights in the tent went out with an audible ‘
“He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk,” she told the school primly, and shouts and cheers erupted from the Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables. There was a rustle of noise from the Gryffindor table and Draco looked to see Potter edging his way slowly along it, eyes scanning the table. He tapped Blaise on the shoulder and pointed – Blaise nodded and they wound their way around the tables, heading for Gryffindor.
“So," Ron said, eyeing Draco shrewdly over his mug of tea. Draco shifted uncomfortably in one of the squishy armchairs in the living room of Grimmauld Place. “What are your intentions towards Harry?” he asked, and Harry choked on his tea while Hermione slapped Ron’s arm.
“Oh, have you seen the papers?” Pansy said suddenly, reaching into the bag at her side and pulling out of a copy of the
“We’re trying to keep magic to a minimum,” Potter explained, adding a few more twigs to the fire, which crackled merrily. “We should be covered by the wards, but – just in case.” He shrugged. Draco nodded and wrapped his arms around himself, shivering slightly. Potter’s expression didn’t change but he jerked one chin over to the tent.
“I don’t think so. It took me all this time to find you, at least. I don’t imagine Snape will have an easier job,” he said, cradling the mug of tea and bringing it close to his chest, holding it to him. He suddenly felt very tired and drained.
!” Blaise said and his forearm seared cold and hot, causing Draco to gag again until it stopped and his arm no longer burned with pain. “It’s not bleeding so much now,” Blaise murmured, dropping his arm.
“You didn’t know what that mark was until a minute ago,” Draco pointed out with a sneer and Weasley looked like he wanted to smack him, though he resisted.
“I think you’ll find my father is being treated more like the red headed step-child these days, if you’ll” – and he shot Weasley, who looked outraged, an insincere smile – “-forgive the expression,” and Potter shot out a hand to grasp Weasley’s upper arm as he started forward.
“They were, but I didn’t see them. Come on, I’m sure we can find them before we have to get back on,” Draco explained, offering his hand. Harry smiled and intertwined their fingers, heading for the nearest exit.
“And you won’t even talk to me,” Draco said thickly into Potter’s shoulder, and he stiffened slightly. “You won’t even
"Well, thank you. And yourself? From what I heard, you were studying just around the corner from here?” Malfoy asked, and Hermione nodded, looking pleased that Malfoy knew.
Bellatrix found him in the crowd, and her smile tightened at the edges, turned into a rictus while Mrs Weasley still pummelled her with curses.
The next morning, Draco scrambled out of his tent, shivering. He had not been allowed into Potter and Granger’s tent (though he could see it was a wizarding one every time one of them opened the flap), but Granger had helped him pitch his own now that the magic had worn off. She had cast a warming charm over it, since Potter had taken Draco’s wand with him into the tent without a word, and had bid him goodnight. But now it had worn off and Draco was shaking in his borrowed jumper and jacket. He looked over and saw that Potter was sitting down in front of the fire again, stoking into life. He looked pale in the winter morning light, dark smudges under his eyes and he blinked slowly at Draco as he approached, as though his eyes couldn’t quite focus even behind his glasses.
“Why bother crying about it?” Pansy asked on Draco’s other side. She had a Slytherin scarf artfully draped around her shoulders and she wound the tassels on the end round and round her fingers. “It’s not like they can go running off into the woods to find her, is it?” she said with a wicked grin. Draco couldn’t contort his face into a reaction they would approve of, so he instead stood.
The Death Eaters scattered and Draco risked peeking over the stone fence. It looked like three had gone one way, and another three the other, all six of them sprinting the length of the main road. A single Death Eater stood silhouetted against the light from the Three Broomsticks, his hands on his hips while he watched the others run around looking for them.
“Shall we go for a drink?” Hermione asked, brushing down her skirt, and Harry and Draco nodded. The walk over to the
Hermione stormed in first, her face a picture of fury, her jaw clenched so tightly Draco could see a vein popping in her temple. She flicked her wand aggressively and the lights of the tent flared around them, making Draco blink in the sudden light. Behind her was Weasley, pleading and defensive at the same time, his backpack hanging off one shoulder. His jacket, Draco could now see, was sodden through and his hair was plastered to his head.
“What is this?” he asked, and he turned Potter back onto his back and pulled at the jumper over his chest. They were changing back, the Polyjuice effect melting off them. Granger’s curls slipped free from the bun and Potter’s hair grew back in, wild and curly. Draco pressed a hand to it, thankful, but turned to Granger. “Something’s burning hot on his chest,” he said and she gasped.
!” Draco murmured and with a yelp, Harry was hoisted into the air by his ankle. He swung wildly for a second, hitting a suit of armour that burst into replicas. Weasley and Hermione screamed in pain as the replicas forced more hot metal at them, and Draco took a few hurried steps back as the tide of objects made its way over to him. Biting his lip to stop himself from shouting at the sensation of coins burning his shins, he directed Harry carefully through the air.
“I thought I was doing the right thing,” he said quietly into the room and his father, from somewhere near the fireplace (and therefore, near the decanter of whisky) scoffed. His mother sniffed loudly and petted his hair – he resisted the urge to duck out of her grasp. From the dining hall, Hermione let out a scream and Draco jerked involuntarily, though his mother hushed him and pulled him close again. “What’s going on?” he asked and his mother crooned at him.
“It probably is,” Draco whispered, just loud enough to be heard over the crunching of the snow underfoot. Potter bobbed his head in acknowledgement.
“Oh, about an hour or two ago. I wanted to make sure I knew where we were going, and read a little to take my mind off things,” she said and Harry raised an eyebrow.
“Fine, thanks. You?” Harry asked, trying to keep his voice neutral and light. Cameron squirmed in his chair a little and Harry felt his stomach clench. He knew what was coming. “Cameron-,” he tried to say ahead of his ex-boyfriend, but Cameron beat him to the punch.
"They were taken by a dark wizard. Death Eater, we think. Someone who lost a son during the War. Look, here's the message they left," and Ron conjured the same image that Thompson had shown the bullpen, the scorched writing on the brick pillar. Malfoy studied it, frowning.
Wasn’t he? Wasn’t he about to be? Wasn’t some final innocent part of him about to be killed off, irrevocably broken and marred, all for a cause that Draco never signed up to support? He stared at Dumbledore, who slid further down to the floor, weak.
He slipped back into the cottage behind the others. Fleur stopped him in the kitchen and pressed a mug of tea to his cold hands, and then Draco joined the others in the sitting room.
The song ended and they slowed, coming to a stop in the middle of the tent. Granger clapped and Potter stepped away, his gaze looking anywhere but at Draco.
“Yes, you too,” he said and then he gave them a final smile before squeezing between them and exiting the building, his hair shining gold for a second in the doorway.
“We know,” she said quietly. “It's why one of the terms is that he can have it after we’re done with it, using it on the Horcruxes,” she explained but Draco shook his head.
“I can’t stay long, I must get back,” he said, even as he sunk into the chair and took the goblet of wine that Bill offered him. They all took goblets that Bill filled and they stood around the table, goblets raised high. “To Teddy Remus Lupin,” Lupin said, grinning at them all. “A great wizard in the making!” and they all toasted to the new baby.
Potter’s green eyes had gone unfocused again as he thought, and Draco nearly wanted to poke him as he lapsed into silence. Hermione called his name but Potter didn’t blink until he suddenly jerked, nearly sending the bench he and Draco were sitting on toppling to the ground.
“Again, Malfoy,” he hissed in Draco’s ear and Draco shrugged him off angrily, raising his wand again. He channelled the fear he felt, the humiliation and the shame at what he was about to do, and pushed it down.
With a surge of emotion that threatened to break him, Harry shook off Hermione's hand and reached forward, taking Draco's shirt in his fist and pulling him close, catching his mouth in a searing kiss. His glasses were crushed awkwardly into his nose, and his hand was trapped between them, but Harry felt something inside himself surge to life again, even as the rest of him felt like he was lost and alone in the dark.
“Do you know much about Regulus Black?” Potter asked. He was sitting on a bed this time, in the room where Draco had left him in the last dream. The edges of Draco’s vision were fuzzy, like something was keeping him from fully seeing where he was, but he still kept looking around, looking for a clue. For what reason, he didn’t know.
The world exploded. They had all stood together for a moment of peace, Harry, Draco, Hermione, the Weasleys with the two Death Eaters at their feet and then the world fell away in a burst of noise and light. Draco felt like he was falling, or maybe he had been thrown, the sensation so reminiscent of those dreams from so long ago that he thought for a second he was in one. But it wasn’t, and he hit a stone wall so heavily that time stopped.
"He is right," Malfoy eventually said, and Harry gaped at him. "If they're anything like we are, they'll have a plan all of their own," he continued and Harry shook his head.
"You got rid of the Malfoy then?" Malfoy eventually said, leaning back against the wall by the door. Ron shot him a venomous look.
Draco stood on the sidelines with Potter while they battled it out. Curiously, Weasley seemed to be taking charge of their campaign. Every other evening he would decide where they were moving to, and the next morning they would pack up and follow him to the next forest, the next field, the next riverbank.
!” came a shout and Crabbe went flying backwards, landing in a sprawl in front of the fireplace. Goyle, confused, turned to look and caught a boot to the face, knocking him unconscious. Draco, retching, rolled onto his front and howled in pain when his forearm landed on the stone floor. “Merlin, what have they done to you?” he heard and then he was being pulled to his feet.
“Oh, I’m not going to bite just yet. We’ll see if she’s a bit quicker at remembering her name than Barney. Who are you, girly?” Greyback asked Hermione who was whimpering but still spoke.
“YOU FOOLS!” came a hideous shriek through the halls of the Manor and Draco flinched. He was safe in his room, but the scream of pure fury rang through the hallways as though the Dark Lord was standing directly outside of his bedroom. “HE GOT AWAY. HOW?? HOW?? FETCH ME THE WANDMAKER,” he screamed and the whole Manor seemed to vibrate with the noise of it. Draco fell back in his seat, fear clutching at his chest.
“Actually – it’s where I lived. With my parents,” Potter said to his hands and Draco felt like a fool – of course! He had heard the place referred to enough times to know what Potter was talking about. Godric’s Hollow had been where the final stand of the Dark Lord had taken place, where Harry Potter had become The Boy Who Lived. He gave a small nod, feeling the corners of his mouth tug down.
!” Rowle began to scream anew and twist on the floor in agony and the snake, Nagini, lifted her head slightly and tracked his movements, as if mesmerised. Next to Rowle, Dolohov stirred a little and then seemed to fall back into unconsciousness. From the trickle of blood pooling around Dolohov’s open mouth where it rested on the slate, Draco imagined that Yaxley had got to him first. As the Dark Lord let out a
“Dobby has no master!” the elf squealed, his voice carrying over Bellatrix’s cries of fury and the banging coming from the library door down the hallway. “Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!” he shouted and Potter groaned next to Draco.
The night Granger had found him. Entering the clearing through the wards and seeing Potter sat there, alive and well, and the hope that rose within Draco in that moment. He lifted his wand, his eyes still closed, and tried again.
It was blissfully domestic and in many ways, it was unlike anything Draco had ever thought marriage would be. In his youth, he imagined marrying a wife he would see for dinner and maybe the occasional romp in her bedroom until she bore him a Malfoy heir, and then they would lapse into the disinterested silence that had permeated his parents’ marriage. But with Harry, he found a companion and a friend. Harry challenged him, and Draco did the same in return, but when there had been tears, there had also been laughter.
"Long and blonde - but you don't think-," Ron began, his eyebrows shooting up towards his hairline, but Malfoy stood up, breaking the connection of his and Harry's hands. Harry looked up at him, and he was white, all blood drained from his face and he looked down at Harry with a terrified glance. He ran to the office door and threw it open, shouting to the room at large.
“I’m really not sure,” he lied as the train continued forward on their journey to Scotland. Hours passed and he barely spoke, preferring to watch the countryside slip by. The trolley witch came through and while the others bought cauldron cakes and pumpkin pasties, Draco couldn’t stomach the idea of eating. He felt a bit nauseous even smelling the food.
Instantly they were raised up into the air. Draco yelped and took hold of Harry’s waist, feeling himself slip back. Harry lurched forward and took hold of the dragon’s scales and spine, gripping onto them. Behind him, Hermione whimpered and grabbed onto the back of Draco’s cloak as the dragon pointed its nose up and flapped once more.
“Then they spot me. If I get spotted, it's better than any of you three being seen too. It’s the best option,” he said, standing up as well as tugging his jumper straight. His hair was starting to dry and the end tickled the back of his neck. “We need to get going. The sooner we get to Hogwarts, the more time we have to search.” He gave Harry a look, who nodded. He reached into the Mokeskin bag looped around his neck and pulled out the cloak, shaking it free.
“They want Granger,” he said as soon as his mind settled, and Potter looked up and around at him. His hair was once more a riot but his eyes were keen. He looked Draco over once, and then nodded and turned back to the window.
“Come out of there with your hands up!” came a rasping voice through the new darkness of the evening. “We know you’re in there! You’ve got half a dozen wands pointing at you, and we don’t care who we curse!” and Draco felt a shock of fear go up his spine – Fenrir Greyback.
In the afternoons, he went to the library at Birrarung Marr. The University itself was hidden in the Yarra Ranges, and designed to be eco-friendly and blend with the rainforest surroundings. The Library was a modern mix of wood and glass, partially reclaimed by the vines growing up the side of the building, but Harry thought it had it’s charm, especially in comparison to the Hogwarts Library which smelled constantly of dust.
"My dear Harry - if there were any two boys most likely to survive a kidnapping, it would be the sons of you and Mr. Malfoy here. I have no doubt that they have caused endless mischief for their captor, and that they will be returned to you soon enough. Have faith, my dear boy - in yourself and in your sons. They are rather remarkable children, after all," he said and Harry nodded dumbly, while Malfoy just gaped at the portrait. Dumbledore gave them both one last smile and then disappeared out of the frame, leaving them alone.
“Hermione, I’ve been short-listed!” he shouted down the phone and there was a moment of confused silence before Hermione shrieked and Ron swore in the background, obviously startled awake.
As Harry spoke the final word, a red-gold burst of light fell across his face. Draco looked up at the enchanted ceiling, blinking in the light cast from the new day as the sun crept over the sill of a nearby shattered window. The air tensed around them all for a second and then the tension snapped at once;
“Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me,” the Dark Lord announced and with a flick of his wand, the Sorting Hat burst into flame. There were screams from the crowd and from Neville himself, and Draco jerked forward, about to run to grab him when another shout wrought the dawn in two.
“… now found ourselves another secure location, and I’m pleased to tell you that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening. Evening, boys!”
“Look at the size of her; I think we could overpower her if we had to,” he said. He hesitated for a second. “Listen, I should have told you, I knew she wasn’t all there. Muriel called her ‘gaga’,” he said and there was a low moan from the other room, which made both Draco and Granger jump, Granger clutching Potter’s hand. He eased her grip off and gave her a small smile. “It’s okay,” and he went to the sitting room, Granger following behind, Draco following after her. Granger's hand fluttered behind her back as though reaching for him, and he gently touched her arm as he squeezed past into a corner, making sure not to disturb anything, settling into a corner next to a chest of drawers.
“He’s having a vision,” he told Hermione who had looked over in alarm, and she crawled forwards on her hands and knees, helping Draco get Harry onto his side in case he started convulsing again. Ron came too and rested a hand on Harry’s shoulder, keeping him steady.
Draco watched the disturbed dust float around the stairs and then he lost track of where Harry was. He stood alone at the top of the stairs for a long moment and then went down them, slipping silently into the Great Hall behind Oliver Wood who gently laid another body down in the line. Draco recognised him, underneath all the blood.
!” Granger said, tears streaming down her face now. Her voice was high and sharp and Draco took an involuntary step back. She swiped a hand under her eyes furiously. “You come back after weeks –
Harry and Voldemort shouted at the same time, thrusting their wands forward. Golden flames erupted between them as the spells met with a cannon-like blast of noise. And Draco watched as the Elder Wand flew from Voldemort’s hand, pushed out of it by the rebounding force of the spell, and sent it in a wide arc over the circle. Harry, his Seeker skills keen and instinctual, snatched it from the air with his free hand as Voldemort rolled back on his heels and then began to fall, his arms outstretched, his eyes slitted as he hit the floor with a very-human
The barman was silent, as though processing the news, before he sighed. “I’m sorry to hear it. I liked that elf,” he said finally, before turning away to light some of the lamps around his room.
’, finishing the chapter on Ancient Macedonian Wizards that had travelled with Alexander the Great. Hephaestion had always been something of an idol to Draco.
He had taken a seat in one of the study rooms at the top of the library, writing out a list of books to request, when one of the librarians knocked on the room’s glass door. Harry looked up and smiled as Rachel opened the door, a package held in one of her hands.
“Harry, here!” Granger called and Draco whipped around to look at her. She was two rows of tombstones away from Potter and he had already begun to wade over to her, lifting his knees high to get through the heavy snow. Draco followed, his heart pounding.
“Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,” said Lee, his voice tight from trying not to laugh. He cleared his throat before speaking again. “Listeners, that brings us to the end of another Potterwatch. We don’t know when it will be possible to broadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: the next password will be ‘Mad-Eye’. Keep each other safe, keep faith,” Lee said somberly and Potter’s jaw tightened slightly. “Goodnight.” The radio’s dial twirled and then the lights went out.
“Wait,” Draco whispered and Hermione gave him a shocked look. The pieces were joining up now. That moment on the Astronomy Tower.
“You might as well get your tent pitched,” she said and he nodded, picking up his backpack and setting it up opposite where Potter was beginning to work on their tent. He unpacked the tent and laid it out, threading the poles through. As he was about to wrestle the poles into their marks in the bottom fabric, Potter came to help him.
“How did he die?” he asked and she frowned. Her hair was beginning to escape the chignon it had been in all day and tendrils fell around her face, framing it. He could see then, beyond the exhaustion and the fear, the young woman she had once been.
don’t think important enough to mention.” Draco’s heart felt like it swooped and he suddenly felt a pang of fear. To be as isolated as they had been, it felt like the war was something distant. They hadn’t heard of any deaths, but then they hadn’t had the opportunity either. Potter was leaning forward in his armchair, his fingertips pressed to his mouth, looking gravely concerned.
“Potter, it can’t be any more dangerous than having the Dark Lord skulking about your house for the entire summer holiday,” he said and Potter rolled his eyes. Draco’s hands tightened on the mug, the heat almost searing his palms. “I’ve spent the last six months of my life living in abject terror every day. I’ve been made to torture people. I’ve been made to sit quietly at dinner as he rambled on about how he was going to kill you. I have been spat at, and kicked, and threatened, and, by Merlin, whatever you’re doing here is not going to be anywhere near as dangerous as that,” he spat and Potter looked shocked, his eyes wide, the green bright against the winter that surrounded them.
“Read it!” he shouted, pulling something free from inside and storming back over, shoving a piece of parchment in front of her, nearly upending Weasley’s bowl of soup. “Read it! Dumbledore has the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn’t need a cloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one.” His hands shook so hard that something jumped out of the pouch and rolled away, heading towards Draco, who leaned down and picked it up.
Isobel, a prideful Ravenclaw, involuntarily pressed the Head Girl badge pinned to the front of her robe closer to her chest and leaned back in her chair, as if trying to get away from Snape. He held the silence for a minute longer.
He was about to shout and lash out when he caught sight of Ron next to him. He glanced around and realised that he had been pulled under the invisibility cloak, Hermione and Harry sandwiched under it as well.
Belinda bustled in a few minutes later with a tray of tea and pastries, and tutted at the mess, but found a spot on top of a filing cabinet to settle the tray and then left them to it. They sat in silence while a warming charm kept the tea hot.
“Nobody. There are no more Horcruxes,” he announced and Draco looked around for Ron and Hermione. They caught his eye and sidled over. Hermione gripped his hand tightly in hers. “It’s just you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good…”
“We have Harry Potter,” he explained in his raspy voice and Father perked up, his eyes suddenly more confused than they had been. He stepped closer to the group but his shadow obscured Potter’s face.
“I have a final question for Mr Potter, though this does not relate to his examination answers,” Fellow Williams said, and Harry nodded, swallowing the nerves he felt. The Fellows in the room shifted in their chairs in anticipation as Williams drew himself up. “Why this subject, Mr Potter?” he asked, focusing his gaze on Harry. Harry was startled to see that his eyes were green, like Harry’s own, and it mollified him a little. He sat a little straighter in his chair, taking a breath, settling back into that knowledge again.
Fleur called for everyone to come sit and they all took their places, sat elbow-to-elbow. There was a low murmur of conversation but everyone was looking at Fleur, who was merely playing with her food, glancing up at the window every few minutes. Her face broke into a relieved smile as Bill reappeared at the front door, looking windswept from the storm rolling in outside.
“‘Allo,” he said simply in a stuffy French accent, and Travers withdrew, looking charmed by their foreign guests.
“I thought you might have one,” Potter said without any preamble. He sounded curious rather than resentful, and Draco shivered as Potter lightly traced the curve of the snake with the tip of one finger. He looked tired, and his hair was a riot of curls, his t-shirt lightly grimy as though he hadn’t been able to do any laundry for a while. He met Draco’s gaze and settled back on his heels, allowing Draco to sit up.
“Look, I’m going to go to the Slytherin common room,” he said finally and Hermione frowned at him. “
Weasley justified his disappearance by telling them he had been taken by a bunch of Snatchers as soon as he had landed, but had escaped soon after and had been looking for them ever since. Hermione interjected now and then will snide remarks, her voice pitched with a lofty, superior air that made Draco raise his eyebrows at her. She ignored him. Draco had tuned out the conversation and was staring at the curve of Potter’s hands wrapped around the blanket he held around himself, when one word caught his attention, and he looked up.
A soft rap on his door caused Draco to unfurl himself from his seat by the window and pad to the door. He cracked it open and his mother was waiting there for him, her back turned to the door – it was a habit they had all adopted. Don’t leave your back unguarded to the hallways, lest a stray jinx be sent your way.
“You’d need to ask Harry. I’m not going to be the one to tell you,” she said with a slightly petulant tone, as if he was picking up the thread of an argument that had been going on for far longer than he would ever know. He gave her a small smile and left her to the books and notes.
without the venom that had coloured it throughout their school years, but it was still a shock to hear it.
"We don't know it was a kidnapping yet, Sir, unless you know something we don't," Thompson said a bit snidely, walking around the edge of his desk, reaching out one hand placatingly towards Harry. Harry reached instead for the front of Thompson's deep burgundy robes and grabbed a handful of fabric by his throat, hauling him close.
“Harry, this symbol – it connects Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Godric’s Hollow. I really think this is worth looking into,” Hermione said earnestly. Potter looked up at her and then turned and looked out into the darkness of the forest around them. Draco stood from the dining table and went to lean against the central pole, his arms crossed over his chest. Weasley gave him a sideways look but didn’t say anything. “Harry – please,” Hermione whispered into the quiet and eventually he turned around, taking a deep breath and nodding.
“Pardon me, sir,” Isobel interrupted and Snape turned his cold black eyes on her. If she flinched internally, she did not show it. “But surely, if you were choosing the best out of our year, Hermione Granger would be Head Girl, not me?” she asked and Snape’s lips pursed, as if he had just sucked on a lemon. Draco leaned back in his chair, suddenly a little afraid for Isobel.
Hermione turned from adding tea bags into the mugs laid before her, giving him an exasperated sigh. “Harry-” she started but Potter was too excited. He stood from the armchair, his hand slipping away from Draco’s side, up onto his feet in the centre of the tent.
“Frankly, it’s been terrifying, sir. Especially this last day,” he added and Dumbledore made a small huff of laughter.
"The trunks! Where were the trunks found?!" he asked the assembled Aurors, most of who gaped at him as though he were the recently risen dead. Eventually, one of the junior Forensic Wizards, Manco, responded.
“Draco’s come home, Bella,” Mother began to say but Bellatrix’s attention had been caught by the group bound in front of the fireplace. Her eyes glinted manically in the light from the fire.
“Er – what – ?” Ron asked, confused, and Draco echoed the sentiment. He must’ve only been asleep for a few minutes at that, but it felt like he had missed an entire conversation.
“We need it. For what we’re doing now. We need the book,” he said firmly and Draco shut his mouth. He took a steading breath.
The storm howled around them as Harry slipped his hands inside Draco’s shirt, stroking his thumbs along Draco’s ribs, sliding higher and higher until they flicked against Draco’s nipples, causing him to gasp into Harry’s mouth, pressing closer to him.
"Like your Dad said, we'll see you soon, okay? Be good boys, listen to your teachers, and do your homework," he said and the boys nodded. He pulled them in, dropped kisses on both of their heads, and then let them go. "Go! Have fun!" he said and the boys nodded, and jumped on to the train, just as the whistle sounded again.
They made a strange funeral procession, and they paused to carefully place Fred’s body in a niche where a knight had one stood. Ron knelt down to close his brother's eyes and then straightened. Draco checked that the body was well hidden and then nodded.
After a few minutes, it was obvious that Potter wasn’t coming back any time soon. Draco stood up and edged over to their tent, poking his head into look around. Potter wasn’t in the living area or over by the other sleeping area, though there was furious whispering coming from the closed off area where Granger had been sleeping. He took a step into the tent, though he thought he should probably return to the fire, and his eyes fell once again on the pile of books on the dining table. A Sneakoscope rested on its point in the middle of the table, still and quiet. A few titles jumped out at him, including ‘
“We were so worried!” she cried into his hair and he gingerly patted her on the back. “I know I told you to run, but where did you go? No letters, nothing!” she drew away and with a pang he had to look away from her tear-streaked face.
“You have fought valiantly,” a high, cold voice pierced the room and they all stilled. The Dark Lord was speaking. “Lord Voldemort knows how to value bravery. Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste. Lord Voldemort is merciful.” Hermione scoffed at that. “I command my forces to retreat immediately. You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured.
As he moved, he thought of all the places that Harry could be. The Gryffindor common room? No. Room of Requirement again – no, it was too damaged. After all that the Dark Lord said in the Shrieking Shack, the revelation that Snape had been the Master of the Elder Wand, and that the Dark Lord needed him to d–
“There’s no such thing, Harry!” she said, focused on this supposed unbeatable wand, and Potter shrugged one shoulder. “Even if it did exist, you’d then have to assume that the Resurrection Stone did as well, and that would be ridiculous! No magic can raise the dead,” she added and Potter gave her a look over his shoulder.
“I’m staying, Professor,” Draco heard and he craned his neck to see that Daphne Greengrass had stood. Another student, her sister, stood up as well, a little further way up the table.
“You know me!” His voice was resentful and petulant. “Fenrir Greyback! We’ve caught Harry Potter! And” – a smile crept into his voice, though it wasn’t a pleasant one – “your son!” he added and Mother gasped.
“It’s a busy platform. Are you nervous about going to school?” she asked and Tatiana looked offended.
Hermione was waiting for him just beyond the doors, a smudge of ink on her jaw, her hair falling loose of the chignon and curling around her face. She gave him an enquiring look without speaking and Harry gave her a reassuring smile - he was confident in the answers he had given. She gave him a relieved smile back, and Harry knew she felt the same.
“I’ve got food,” Aberforth said and he ducked out of the room. Harry came and sat on the arm of Draco’s armchair and Draco patted his thigh, tilting his head to rest it against Harry’s ribs. Aberforth reappeared a minute or so later with a large loaf of bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of mead, which he set down on the small table in front of the fireplace.
“Disgusting!” Ron shouted and Neville nodded weakly, before they abandoned the body to join another fight.
Heavy footsteps rounded the bar and then Aberforth stood at the end of it, looking at Draco, who felt very small in comparison. He had an unkempt look to him. His grey hair was past his shoulders and his beard was halfway down his chest, but behind the grimy spectacles that were perched low on his nose, Draco thought his eyes were familiar.
Happy? What moment about his life had been happy? Was it the day he received his Mark, trying to stifle the cries and swallowing around the tears as his father held him knelt to the floor and the Dark Lord burned that mark into his arm? No – that was the opposite of happy.
There was only one portrait that remained mostly serene, directly behind the Headmaster’s desk. Albus Dumbledore, his long beard nearly down to his knees, was crying silently. Painted silver tears slid from behind his half-moon spectacles and he looked at Harry with pride and gratitude, enough to fill Draco’s heart. Beside him, Ron sniffed and rubbed his nose roughly on the back of his sleeve while Hermione wiped her tears from her cheeks and gave a small bob of a curtsey, awkward, as the Headmasters and Headmistresses continued their standing ovation.
“Where are you?” Draco asked and Potter hummed, non-committal. He stepped around Draco and wandered out of the room. Draco followed him, the room around him dimming and growing dark as Potter walked away. Whatever place he was in, it must’ve been held together by Potter only, and as Draco walked in his wake, the house around them appeared and disappeared, slipping by in their path. Potter led him up some stairs and into another dingy room. It was decorated, Draco could tell that much, but everything was still blurry, like Draco was looking through a rain streaked window. If he had been awake, it would’ve given him a headache.
“Hermione stabbed it! Thought she should, she hasn’t had the pleasure yet,” he said, Draco taking the cup from his hand and turning it over in his own, running his thumb over the ruined object. A thousand years old and utterly destroyed.
“He’s dead,” Harry said blandly and Aberforth’s expression didn’t change. “Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.”
. He fetched his book from the window sill and opened it to the last page he could remember reading and then stared at the page blankly, not taking the words in.
A second, louder bang, went off and there was a small noise of pain. Draco craned his neck to look and his eyebrows shot up – Neville Longbottom was sprawled in the No-Man's-Land between the two sides, his wand landing just beside Harry. With horror, Draco watched as the Dark Lord turned his attention to Neville, who was pushing himself up to his knees.
“Thought we’d find you here,” Crabbe said into the silence. Draco whirled around, fingers already around the hilt of his wand.
Like that child on Christmas all those years ago, Harry went to stand in front of the mirror, and stared at its reflective surface.
The applicants all milled around the atrium, some gathered around the tea making facilities like the hot water urn held all the answers, some sat in the scattered chairs, elbows braced on their knees while they stared into space. Harry and Draco shucked their coats and hung them up on the provided coat hooks, looking around the room at their fellow nervous candidates.
“Godfather, Harry!” Bill said from the head of the table, collecting the goblets left there. “A real honour. Congratulations!” he said and Harry, grinning, began to collect goblets as well, helping to clear the table, following Bill into the kitchen. As soon as the door was closed between them, Weasley rounded on Draco again.
“Likely a Parkinson or a Greengrass. A great-grandmother was a Bulstrode, so that’s too close to marry into that family again,” he said primly and Potter looked up from where he was hunched over and grinned at him. Draco gave him a foul look too. “Oh, please. It’s not like I’m actually going to marry anyone,” he said waspishly and Potter frowned at him.
“I left Hogwarts today. Went on the run. It’s… I couldn’t stay there anymore. I didn’t want to. I want to help you,” he said and Potter made a small noise next to him. Draco looked over at him but Potter was frowning at something in the middle distance. Draco looked behind him but there was nothing.
" a young Scorpius screamed, a child in pain. Harry forced himself to stand upright, to move towards the stairs, but the room warped and twisted and he stumbled. He dragged himself towards the staircase, determined to go downstairs, to reach the boys, but the bannister turned into a snake and nipped at his hands as he tried to grasp it.
“I need to get cleaned up,” Hermione murmured, more to herself than anyone else. “I told him that was an Erumpent horn, didn’t I?” she suddenly snapped to the air and Weasley and Potter groaned next to her. “I
“It means… memory. That they live on in the memory of those who still live to remember them. They’ll only
Harry just stared at the image floating overhead, leaning heavily against Hermione. He stared until the words all blurred together, until they blended into the brick, until it looked like they weren't there at all.
“Let’s go, Ron will be waiting up for us,” Hermione said, taking Harry by the arm and leading him away from the Hall. They collected their things from the makeshift cloak room which had been set up, pulled on their coats and then stepped out into the brisk night air, the stars clear in the sky above them. Hermione stood for a moment studying them but then shook her head.
The air turned cold around him and Draco felt like his breath had been stolen away. He gasped, clutching a hand to his chest and he risked another look around the wall. A group of dementors, ten or so, were gliding down the road, coming from the direction of the Shrieking Shack. He had to act fast. Though his hand shook, Draco fished his wand out of his jumper and raised it. He thought of Harry, Ron and Hermione and the laughter they had shared at the lakes edge.
He pulled away, breathing deeply, and Draco blinked at him, his lips bruised red and his eyes glazed over slightly.
“What would we even call them?” Draco asked and Harry grinned, turning to look over his shoulder, his green eyes bright and vivid in the September sunlight.
“I did. I didn’t want to. But He had – the Dark Lord – He had threatened my parents. He was going to kill them and me. I was – I wanted to save them,” he managed to choke out and his voice sounded strained even to his own ears. Granger’s gaze turned a smidge sympathetic while Potter still watched him with mistrust. “I regret it. If I could do it all over again, I would’ve taken Dumbledore’s first offer of help. I would’ve disappeared with him that night. But I made a mistake – a mistake that I will have to live with the rest of my life. I hate myself for it,” he admitted.
“Let’s get lunch, I can sort it out later,” she said, striding off towards the sunlit outdoors. Harry and Malfoy followed, knocking shoulders as they went through the door, both of them squeezing inwards slightly. Harry felt heat rise on his cheeks, and mentally chided himself. He was not a schoolboy anymore!
“You thought you did, but you were wrong,” Harry said and the crowd around them stirred, as though awoken from a trance. A gasp rose in the air, and held there.
“All finished,” Hermione said quietly after a few minutes and Draco stepped back. Harry made an approving noise and Draco shot him a glare – he held up his hands in surrender.
Hermione and Draco were waiting for him outside, their heads bent close together. Draco looked almost like he was pleading, and Hermione looked flustered, but they both smiled at him as he approached, standing from their seats.
He was stopped by his mother at the library door, pulled into the room on stiff legs and once the door had been shut, his mother fell on him, sobbing.
Distantly there was the muffled creak of a lock being jimmied open and then two doors down from where Draco was crouched, he saw someone come out onto the street, turned into shadow from the light falling from the doorway.
“The locket?” he asked and Potter hummed to himself. Would all conversations in this dreamscape be this disjointed? The scene around him wavered slightly, as though Potter was changing the landscape around them, and Draco closed his eyes for a second. Potter mumbled something that Draco couldn’t quite make out.
“But did you hear what Fred said?” he asked excitedly. Draco assumed it was a contributor that he had missed while being outside. “He’s abroad! He’s still looking for the wand, I knew it!”
and the single wisp of silver smoke fell limply from his wand and then was carried away on the chill wind.
“Dobby – did Potter have anything to do with you working here?” Draco asked and Dobby froze like someone had hit him with a Body-Bind Curse. Draco sipped his tea and shrugged when Dobby looked over his shoulder at him. “It doesn’t really matter, I suppose, though I am glad you’re here, Dobby. I think I need a friend right now,” he added quietly and Dobby’s ears drooped slightly as if in sympathy. He set down his tea cup and leaned forward in the stool, so that he and Dobby were nearly eye-to-eye. Dobby turned slowly, as though he knew that Draco was waiting for him, and then he met Draco’s eyes and gave a sniff.
“Sometimes. But then sometimes not. They get overshadowed by other dreams. I’m sorry I can’t remember,” Potter told him solemnly and Draco only nodded. Potter shifted forward slightly, so now their knees were touching. “Did it hurt less when I touched you?” he asked and Draco realised he was talking about the burning Dark Mark.
After, Dumbledore leaned back in Madam Hilda's chair and looked like he was lost deep in thought. Malfoy made him and Harry cups of tea from the still-warm teapot that Belinda had brought in while Dumbledore thought, and they both waited with baited breath.
behind him that made Draco nearly jump out of his skin. He whirled around, wand brandished, to see a house-elf balanced on the cracked leather armchair by the fireplace, looking cautious. But not just any house-elf–
Hermione shrieked, bouncing a little on the balls of her feet. “Wha–? Tonks – Tonks has had the baby?” she asked in a breathy high-pitched voice and Lupin finally managed to free himself from his cloak, dropping it in a sodden heap on the ground by his feet. His smile could’ve lit up the whole room.
“I can do that,” Draco said, letting go of Potter’s shoulders. He still trembled and jerked but not as viciously as before. The woods around them were dark and he could hear owls hooting softly in the distance, along with the sound of rushing water close by. “Go wash your hands. I’ll do this and then we’ll get the tent up and get him inside,” he said and she nodded, passing him the vial. She stood shakily and stumbled off to the sound of the water.
If Granger was choosing their hiding locations (and Potter would do well to let her), she was likely choosing locations that would be passed off by Dark Wizards as insignificant Muggle locations, but would probably have deeper meaning. Shoving the remains of his turkey and cheese sandwich into his mouth, Draco hefted the backpack back onto his shoulders and fished his wand out of the front of his jumper, where he had shoved it for safekeeping. He balanced it on the palm of his hand and choked out ‘
!” and Draco cursed him silently. They would know, and they did, and the Death Eaters fell back, crowing “It’s him! It’s Potter!” into the night.
“‘Ow you?” Weasley said in a rough imitation of a vaguely European accent and Draco shook Travers' hand politely.
“We should close his eyes,” Luna said softly and Potter jumped, turning to look at her. She held one of Fleur’s coats around her shoulders like a blanket, and she knelt on the ground and used two fingers to close Dobby’s unseeing eyes. She smiled and stroked one finger down the side of his slack face. “There. Now he could be sleeping,” she said. Potter, standing alone in the grave, reached up and Dean and Ron carefully passed Dobby’s body into Potter’s waiting arms and he lowered him into the ground, adjusting him before turning and climbing out.
“I agree. I’ll let Hermione know,” he said before standing. He stretched, baring a line of pale skin across his abdomen as his shirt rode up, before lowering his arms and holding Draco’s wand out to him, hilt first. After a moment of hesitation, Draco took it. The wood was warm from where Potter had been holding it, and the wand practically hummed in his hand. Potter left, disappearing into the tent, and Draco took his place in front of the fire.
“No idea,” he said coolly. “Maybe he was born that way? Merlin knows I’d hide in the woods if I was that ugly,” he said and a few of the Snatchers chuckled. “We need to go to Malfoy Manor, Greyback. I’m sure my father will reward you handsomely for taking me home to him, safely,” he added and Greyback’s eyes caught the light and flashed yellow. He turned and kicked Potter in the side, turning him onto his back with a gasp. Draco looked away.
“That’s exactly what I was going to say,” she said and Draco felt a bit pleased with himself. The coldness of the first few weeks of travelling with Potter and Granger had ebbed, though hadn’t completely thawed, but he thought he might have cracked Granger finally. She turned her attention to Potter. “Anyway, I thought you might’ve made the connection with the name. The village is named after him, after all,” she said and Potter gave her a weary if affectionate smile.
"I didn't realise. It sounds so - pathetic to say it now, how could I have not realised? But when your parents tell you to do something, you do it, because they love you and you love them and you don't even realise that there might be something that they place higher than you," Malfoy had said once and Harry had nodded solemnly, realising something about his own relationship with Dumbledore in that instant.
The platform was heaving, as it was every September 1st, but Draco could see a pocket of redheads nearby and he pulled Harry in that direction. Around them, students greeted them as they went past – “Hi Professor Malfoy!” “Happy September 1st, Professor Potter!” – and Draco smiled and waved as his name was called. They finally breached the crowd, and found who they were after.
“The unbeatable wand, Harry!” Ron exclaimed and Potter lifted his head weakly, his eyes rolling as he spoke once more.
“Now, we won’t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr Malfoy,” Greyback rasped menacingly and Father waved a dismissive hand, nearly catching Potter on the chin.
“Wait – Death Eaters?” Draco asked, feeling his mouth go suddenly dry. Potter scoffed and Hermione touched his shoulder as she edged by.
“Come on,” Hermione said, her voice muffled by the hands over his ears. He lowered his hands, and the Dark Lord ’s voice had gone. He reached up his hands and they pulled him to his feet. Hermione looped an arm around Ron’s as they followed the group leaving the Great Hall. Blaise joined him, hovering closeby as they wound their way out of the entrance hall and into the cold dawn light.
And when the Aurors came knocking, Harry had told them the truth. His husband had tried to kill their sons. Harry had shut the door behind them, while Malfoy was dragged, crying, from the house.
Malfoy moved some of the files to the side and sat heavily on the couch, long legs splaying out in front of him. Harry settled in behind his desk and slowly began picking his way through the files, making some space in front of him.
A figure on a broomstick, unknown even to Draco, swooped close to the motorbike and raised its wand – before Draco could even think to intervene, Hagrid had shouted “NO!” and launched himself from the motorbike, his weight dragging the Death Eater’s broom into a spiralling free-fall even as Potter watched, aghast.
Potter had gone to sleep and if Draco looked behind himself into the tent, he could see the lump that was Potter bundled under bedclothes on the bottom bunk.
“She’s in with the Magical Fellows now. She was nearly vibrating off the walls,” Harry said with a smile and Draco gave a huff of a laugh. “Shall we go inside?” Harry said, gesturing, and Draco nodded, following him indoors and out of the cold.
They clung on, flat to the dragon’s back and nearly vertical, as the dragon climbed higher in the cave before he dove for the passage opening, belching flame that blew the passage open. Draco pressed his head to the dragon’s back as Hermione screamed, “We’ll never get out, it’s too big!” behind him, but the dragon didn’t hear her because it clawed and fought its way through the passage. Draco kept his eyes closed and Harry ahead of him coughed as Hermione tucked herself in tighter to the dragon’s back – he couldn’t see Weasley.
Draco tried to memorise these last moments. How Harry’s hand felt in his own. The sound of his breathing. The way he walked. The thud of his pulse in his wrist. Draco tried to capture how the light fell on Harry’s dark curls and turned them burnished for a second. How his eyes were the lush green of grass in summertime. Even the lightning bolt scar, which fractured down his forehead in white streaks, coming to stop just above his right eye. He was beautiful, and tragic, and Draco couldn’t even find the strength to scream at the injustice of it all.
“Well, cheers!” he said, lifting his pint glass. Hermione smiled and tapped her glass to his. “Well done to us for getting invited to take the fellowship exams,” he continued, bringing the glass to his lips and taking a drink.
Draco ducked and weaved and timed his curses with Neville so that Fenrir never got a moment to stop, never got to reply. Some time during the fight, Ron had joined in as a herd of house-elves stormed past, their little voices raised in a battle cry. Fenrir snarled and snapped and swiped at them with his claw-like nails until Draco remembered a spell that he had seen in one of his father’s books before.
“Morning all,” Harry greeted them jovially, shaking Ron and Viktor Krum’s hand, kissing Hermione and Ginny on the cheek while Draco did the same. “Excited for the new year, Sasha?” he asked Viktor and Ginny’s oldest son. Aleksandr Krum, known as Sasha by many, had taken after his father, with a beaky nose and a surly disposition, but even he grinned at Harry.
"There will be something in the trunks," Luna said, cleaving the quiet in two. She looked at Harry from where she had been stood in the middle of the room, her penetrating gaze catching his own. "There will be, Harry. There will be something for the Aurors to find, something to lead them to the kidnapper,"
He looked like a man who had just discovered the meaning of life. His expression lifted, his eyes wide, his cheeks flushed with this revelation. Draco almost hated the moment that Hermione spoke, breaking the silence and saying his name once, pityingly, as Potter dove for the knot of damp clothes on the floor and wrestled the Mokeskin pouch out of his sodden t-shirt.
“Here you go,” she said, passing Potter his mug and then Draco his. She sat down on the log with her back to the tent and settled the book on her lap, flipping to a few chapters in. Draco tilted his head to try and read the cover. His eyebrows shot up as he got sight of it – ‘
“Draco, ‘elp me with ze dinner, mm?” Fleur suggested, dragging her eyes away from the place where her husband had stood. Draco nodded and followed her into the kitchen, helping to carry a terrine of soup over to the formal dining table where Hermione was laying the last of the spoons. It wasn’t nearly big enough for the current number of occupants of the house, but better than the kitchen table which barely sat three of them.
Draco sighed into it, his eyes fluttering closed. Potter’s lips curved in a smile against his and Draco broke the kiss to wipe at his face with the cuff of his jumper.
“Right, on the train everyone,” Ron announced as there was a surge of activity. Harry and Draco jumped inside, turning to help load trunks into the carriage. Soon the children were all settled, exchanging goodbyes that might have been a little tearful with their parents.
He was reading a recipe for Tarte Tatin by the dim light overhead when someone else entered the kitchen. It was Potter.
“He shouldn’t have snapped,” he whispered to her and Granger shook her head, tendrils of borrowed mousy brown hair breaking free from the low bun Granger had tied it in.
He took them to the courtyard as instructed, and the albino peacocks who preened by the fountain stared at him in judgement until he went back inside. He thought for a second and then tapped his wand to one of the tapestried walls. With a small
“They must’ve been here for weeks,” she hissed and Draco nodded. “The room must have expanded as more and more students needed it. Look-” she pointed at a hammock that hung under a Hufflepuff banner. “That one looks brand-new,” she said and based on the plump white pillow and pristine sheets, Draco agreed with her.
“And how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything?” Weasley asked with bite and Hermione, in her desperation, raised her wand.
’. By the time the Fellow at the front of the hall called the end of the exam, Harry’s hand ached fiercely and his back was tense from sitting so still for so long. He stretched out his hand as the papers were collected, and stood when they were dismissed by the Fellow, making his way out of the hall.
Malfoy had been given potions to drink and pills to take and then two weeks later, Harry had come home to find him knelt by the bath tub in the second floor bathroom, lazily drawing patterns on the waters surface.
“Well, what else can I say?” Weasley replied, his hands outstretched as if in surrender. Draco drew back even further and then slipped inside the tent. It was warmer inside, though not by much, and he sat down heavily on the bunk that Potter had claimed, fisting his hands in the fabric of his jumper as he sat. The conversation outside grew louder as the trio approached the tent.
“Yes, Dobby is hearing about things upstairs, sir. Like Harry Potter is missing, and that Professor Snape is now Headmaster. There are many changes upstairs,” he added a bit sadly and Draco nodded. Dobby stacked the firewood next to him and looked around for any logs that might have rolled away and Draco remembered suddenly that his father had mentioned Dobby’s disappearance exactly once – ‘
Granger found them still sitting out there when she woke up a few hours later. Draco was finishing his chapter on the Court Magicians of the Tudor Dynasty when she slipped out of the tent, her hair pulled back into a messy bun, a cup of tea in her hands. She gave Potter a smile, Draco a nod of acknowledgement and sat down on the other leg.
Without a second thought, Harry reached over with his other hand and placed it firmly on Malfoy's stomach. He tilted his body inwards, towards Malfoy, angling his legs so that their knees locked together. Malfoy's grip on his hand tightened for a brief second, and then relaxed.
He scooted around, still sprawled on the floor, and Granger was there, her arms crossed over her chest, her wand balanced delicately between her fingers. She eyed him with something similar to curiosity tinged with pity.
Draco had been embraced by the wider Weasley family as well. They spent their Christmases with them, were included as ‘Uncle Harry’ and ‘Uncle Draco’ and had vowed to Molly Weasley that they would keep her various grandchildren out of trouble (or as much as was possible to do so). He was even gifted with a new Weasley jumper every year, which Ron had declared as good as an adoption.
The lessons had been normal to begin with, but now October was well and truly underway and there had been changes. Many of the professors were still teaching the same, though all now were in the habit of barring their doors (Draco had heard a rumour that it was because a Ravenclaw third-year was taken from a Charms lessons directly to the Ministry of Magic and hadn’t been heard from since), and none of the professors engaged in talk about what was happening around the school.
Lupin was smiling, and he raised his goblet again “To new beginnings,” he offered and they all drank. The bubble burst around them and chatter started up again as Potter looked about ready to climb under the table under Weasley’s scrutiny.
The next wave was upon them, Ginny, Neville and Luna screaming for joy, and then the Weasleys and Hagrid and Kinglsey and the professors, all of them bloody and broken, shouting and screaming and stamping their feet. The noise was a cacophony around them and when Harry could finally focus on one person, he turned his gaze to Draco and smiled, wide and beautiful, before pulling him into a kiss. The sound did not waver, the celebration did not die, and Draco grinned against Harry’s mouth and pulled him closer.
“I won’t,” he promised, and Weasley nodded once before leaning back in his chair. Fleur had cracked the door of the kitchen open but had seemingly been rebuffed and was back at the table, tapping her fingers in a drum on the surface. Eventually, Harry reappeared, looking a bit like a scolded child, and he sat down in his chair, listing a little bit. Draco tilted his head a little and the world spun a bit more than expected – the wine had gone to their heads, clearly.
He wished he’d had the presence of mind to take the invisibility cloak, but with the school in darkness, it was fairly simple to skulk through the shadows down to the dungeons. He’d only had to hide twice, once when Mrs Norris came skittering up a corridor on the fourth floor, and once again in the entrance hall when the ghost of the Bloody Baron glided by. Thankfully, he hadn’t seen any teachers as he’d gone through the school.
“Tatiana, what is it?” she asked, brushing her daughter’s hair back. Tatiana looked up and around nervously. She was pale with blue eyes, a smattering of freckles over her nose and cheeks.
Another Weasley appeared, judging from his red hair and he surveyed the scene with a stricken face. He was about the same height as Weasley – Ron – but his hair was long and tied loosely at the base of his neck. Draco realised that he knew this brother, he recognised him as the groom from the wedding – Bill.
He didn’t actually mean to go to the library and so he headed for the dungeons, hoping to find a quiet corner to catch his breath. He still wasn’t sleeping very well, trying to avoid Potter at all costs, though occasionally his body failed him and he fell into fitful sleep. When he did dream, he dreamed of nothing at all, and that was somehow worse. Between the knowing and not-knowing, Draco was drained.
“No tryouts for first-years Lily, remember?” Ginny said and Lily pouted. When she had been born, Harry and Draco had gone to visit Ginny at St Mungo's, and there, while she held the squirming bundle, Ginny had asked if she would be allowed to name her new daughter after Harry’s mother. Harry had agreed, tearful. Draco had also been tearful when Ginny had asked if he would like to be Godfather.
Luna, who had been watching Draco, turned to look at Dean. “Oh, me? I got taken off the train going home for Christmas. Ginny was there,” she told Ron, who stared at her. “She tried to put up a fight but I told her to sit down. I left quite quietly, I think. I didn’t want to scare anyone,” she added with a soft smile. Ron gave her an affectionate look. “I was surprised to see you here, Draco,” she said and Draco looked at the group of them in the sitting room. Hermione, pale, had dozed off on the sofa, her legs drawn up to her chest, a blanket wrapped around her.
“You have blood on your forehead,” she told him, pointing at the spot. He wiped a hand over it and it came away red. “Go wash off in the stream. I’ll get some tea going,” and she went to the kitchen, looking dazed. Draco stepped out into the dark woods and headed for the rushing water.
“There’s some spaghetti bolognese on the stove if you want some,” Potter said and Draco bobbed his head in acknowledgement. He wasn’t too hungry after just waking up so he settled himself on the other armchair and drank from his mug of tea, listening to the quiet noises Granger made as she read. It was Potter who broke the silence.
“I’m sorry,” Draco muttered stupidly and Potter laughed against his cheek, the sound a bit wet from the tears.
"They're just up ahead, Harry. I can feel it," he said and Harry gave a shuddering gasp, taking a second to compose himself. Draco gave him a small encouraging smile. "We need to get going. My father will know we're here," he told Harry, who nodded. The Aurors around them started up the hallway again, Draco leading the way, while Ron and Hermione came up behind Harry, following him down through the corridor that seemed to run the length of the house.
“Well, this changes things, doesn’t it?” Greyback whispered into the dark clearing and Draco felt a thrill of fear climb up his spine. No one spoke. Around then, the Snatchers had frozen, their tent raided, and the group of bound prisoners collectively held their breath, waiting for their fate to be sealed. Greyback moved again and crouched in front of Potter, who leaned back, his head brushing the back of Draco’s.
“Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?” Harry asked, his voice carrying over the hush of the room. Voldemort passed Draco, he and Harry moving slowly in a perfect circle. It seemed like the world had fallen away except for the two of them, and when Harry spoke, it was only to Voldemort. “Accident, when I decided to fight in that graveyard? Accident, that I didn’t defend myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to fight again?”
“No idea!” he shouted back, and then they settled in again, tucking themselves low over the dragon's back. It was flying them more and more North, Draco could tell by the North Star that began to twinkle overhead as the sun slowly sank on their left.
“The name is ironic,” Potter said with a smile. “Witch Wood. Hermione says it’s not actually named for witches, it’s a tribe name that got turned over so many times that it became Witch, but I think it’s funny.” He offered a hand to Draco and pulled him to his feet. His hand felt warm and real in Draco’s own. “It’s dangerous. I don’t want you to find us. I want you to go home, and be safe. So many people aren’t safe because of me,” Potter said quietly, letting go of Draco’s hand and stepping away.
“Welcome home, Master Mafoy,” the gate announced in a loud, clanging voice, and then swung open. The group was pushed forward, up the driveway between high hedges that muffled the crunch of the gravel beneath their feet. Draco could hear the calls of the peacocks around them, but kept his eyes trained on the door up ahead. The group stumbled a bit as Potter seemed to trip behind them, but Draco kept going, kept walking towards the door that opened a crack and let light spill onto the driveway.
“The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,” he said, his voice weary and quiet. He was talking about the Resurrection Stone, Draco realised. “I dropped it in the forest. I don’t know exactly where, but I’m not going to go looking for it again. Do you agree?”
"Harry," Dumbledore greeted him with a smile, and he then turned his gaze to Malfoy, who looked away. "Mr. Malfoy. I am sorry to hear about your sons," he said and Harry choked a little, his throat constricting. Malfoy knocked their shoulders together.
Harry felt his knees give way and he held on to Hermione's robes as he stumbled her yelp of alarm causing all the Aurors to turn to look at them. Thompson scowled.
And once that was done and his face stung in the winter air, he sat back on the cold damp ground and cried.
“Dumbledore had my Cloak, the night my parents died!” his voice was loud and shaking, and Draco reared back from him. He looked slightly manic again, as if he could see all the pieces lining up. “My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the cloak! This is why! He wanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow!” He somehow got his leg free from the bench and now stood at the head of the table, his hands gesturing wildly as he spoke. “Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric’s Hollow…” Potter turned on his heel and wandered into the centre of the tent, turning sharply once more to cry out, “He’s my ancestor! I’m descended from the third brother! It all makes sense!”
“These are the service tunnels for Hogwarts house-elves, Master Draco,” Dobby explained. “We is using them to get around the castle to clean, but also to fetch supplies. We can leave the castle this way,” he said and Draco followed him through the narrow space. It was well lit but cold and Draco realised they must be between the walls of the castle. He tried not to think about it too much for fear of developing claustrophobia.
Potter began to protest but he was cut off by a shout from the tent. Draco whipped his head around to try and look as someone came out of the tent, the sword of Gryffindor held aloft. Draco felt his mouth go dry. “Hey! Look at this, Greyback!”
“It is you! If they find out who they’ve got – ! They’re Snatchers, they’re only looking for truants to sell for gold–” Dean began to explain but he was cut off when Greyback approached them again.
"I dinnae agree with this, Po'er," he announced to this, squaring his shoulders. Harry nodded, and Begbie's expression softened. "But, it's yer sons. Try nae tae ge' killed, mind," he said finally, before turning himself and Disapparating away. Malfoy gaped after him.
“Where is everyone?” Hermione whispered, even as Ron led them into the Great Hall, one of the doors barely hanging on its hinges, the other creaking open as Ron pushed it.
Harry was confused. Their letters had been intimate, in a way. Harry rarely expressed his fears in written form (Merlin knows the Daily Prophet would have had a field day if they had somehow got hold of one of the letters), but Draco reciprocated and expressed his own thoughts in the same way. Harry was about to say something about it, when Draco spoke.
“We won’t all fit under the cloak,” Draco told him and silence fell. The Gryffindors shared glances between each other and Hermione shook her head.
He had been living in ignorant bliss, he could see that now. All this time with Potter and Hermione, he had thought that the world had just crystallised around them, breaking and reforming as they moved through it, fundamentally unchanged. He could see now how very wrong he had been. Muggles, wizards and goblins alike, dead at the hands of Death Eaters, who had once counted Draco in their ranks.
“No. It’s terrifying, actually,” Draco replied and Potter made a small, sympathetic noise. “Are you safe? Wherever you are?” he asked and Potter nodded, distracted as he curved one line around Draco’s bare foot. They were both in pyjamas, Potter in his boxers and t-shirt, Draco in his matching flannel set.
They wound their way out of the Eastern gallery, where his bedroom was tucked away, and down to the Stone Stairs. While the house had evolved and grown with the whims of the Malfoys who had come before, there had always been the Stone Stairs. The stairs were worn and darkened where the feet of generations past had walked up and down them, and now there were Death Eaters sprawled over them. One of them was even reading, a leather-bound tome which could have only come from the library. Draco clenched his jaw at a particularly rough page-turn. It felt sacrilegious, like a desecration.
“That was all I wanted to say,” Snape replied coolly, dismissing him once more as he turned his hooked nose back down to the paperwork strewn across his desk. Draco rose, a biting remark forming on his tongue, but he swallowed it down. He nodded curtly once and then left the office once more, scowling to himself.
“The Death Eaters are at your house?” he asked and Draco nodded. He edged closer until he was standing by the foot of the bed, leaning against one of the bedposts.
“For my sins,” he said, dabbing his eyes with the back of one sleeve. He sniffled. “I’ve been travelling with them for a few months now. Left school to find Potter and help. Though I think I’ve done more harm than good,” he added and Bill Weasley unfolded his arms and clapped him on the shoulder.
! Don’t touch anything,” he shouted at the others just as Griphook opened his mouth to say something. Even as Draco said it, Weasley took a step back and knocked a golden plate to the floor, which split into others and he swore as they burned away at his shoe. Draco’s feet were growing warm from the coins, but he forced himself to remain as still as possible.
Spells zipped across the night sky over a suburban scene of identical houses, sending up red and blue and green and gold sparks. It looked like fireworks and he begged, in his mind, for the obviously Muggle neighbours to stay inside.
“Mother was going to take me shopping in Paris,” Blaise said mournfully, glancing over his shoulder – behind them, Crabbe and Goyle Senior kept watch, walking a few steps behind. Draco had been sent out into the world with minders, and he was fully cognisant of this. One toe out of line and he would be shut up in the Manor again for the last few weeks of summer. The trip was a reward for his… compliance when it came to the Rowle
Harry wrestled the Horcrux out of the wet jacket he had just taken off, and put it down in front of them on the grass. It glowed in the last rays of the sun and Draco studied it while the other drained the last of their juice.
“Mibby, please be fetching some sandwiches and drinks for Master Draco,” he asked the house-elf Draco had met on his first visit. She gave him a concerned look but then nodded and went to one of the counters. Dobby made his way to stand in front of Draco and snapped his fingers. With a
“What’s the matter darling? You look even more peaky than you did a minute ago,” she said with concern in her voice as she stuffed the paper back into her bag.
They sat in silence for what seemed like another hour. Eventually Potter stood and left the fireside again, returning a few minutes later with two mugs of tea, one of which he handed to Draco who took it gratefully, cradling it in his hands as he turned another page of ‘
"We came as soon as we could. We need to help," Ginny said by way of explanation, her eyes locked on Harry's. Luna sat down next to Harry and threaded one of her arms through his, leaning over to rest her cheek on his shoulder, humming quietly to herself.
!” and there was an almighty crash as Greyback was bodily thrown across the room from the force of the spell.
“Not sure where,” he said, glancing over at the bunkbed through the darkened tent. He could see Potter sprawled out on the lower bunk, one hand reaching over his head, and above him he could make out the lump that was Weasley huddled under the blankets. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Hermione give him a sad smile.
Whereas October in Australia was promising to be warmer, with less rain and more sun, October in England was threatening the opposite. Cold bit at Harry’s nose and cheeks as he waited in the All Souls Quadrangle, breathing in the fresh October air. Hermione had already gone into her Viva, and Harry was next. The other candidates, both Magical and Muggle, waited inside the building, but Harry was keeping an eye on the gate from Radcliffe Square.
“Not a bad little haul for one night,” he was saying. “A Mudblood, a runaway goblin, three truants and the Malfoy boy. You checked their names on the list yet, Scabior?” he asked and Scabior spoke from a little way away.
“It was the best I think Dobby could find. I’m grateful for it though. It’s just a shame any heating charms run out before morning…” he said with a sigh and Potter hesitated but he nodded and walked away. Granger poked her head out from the tent.
Aberforth fixed Harry with an impenetrable stare that betrayed nothing of his thoughts and emotions and then he turned his gaze away before standing and facing the portrait over the mantlepiece.
He was still tall, taller than Harry had remembered, but the boyishness of his face was gone, leaving his face with a defined jaw and high sweeping cheekbones. His hair was shorter than Harry had remembered, cut for practicality rather than style. His clothes were an odd mix between muggle and wizard - dragonhide boots with a Barbour waxed jacket. Harry felt a bit faint at the sight of him.
“… Are you okay?” Potter asked and it was like a dam burst. Draco couldn’t hold back anymore and suddenly the tears were burning in his eyes, flowing hot down his cheeks.
“I’ll go get some drinks. Same as yesterday?” Malfoy said, standing. Harry glanced up at him, but the protest died in his throat. Malfoy looked almost hopeful, and Harry nodded, closing his eyes as Malfoy walked away. Hermione cleared her throat after a minute and Harry opened his eyes.
. And if he had ill-will, he would’ve been burned by the wards,” Granger said from beside him, casting a look over Draco who raised an eyebrow at her. She shrugged one shoulder. “We can’t be too careful. Do you want some tea, Harry?” She turned her attention back to Potter and though he didn’t take his eyes off Malfoy, he nodded once. She made her way up to the tent and slipped inside, leaving them both outside. It was just starting to lightly snow and Draco blinked as the snowflakes caught on his eyelashes.
“No,” Seamus Finnigan replied in his lilt. Harry gave him a studying look, like he had struggled to recognise him as well. Draco turned away and didn’t listen as Finnigan spoke, studying the room and it’s occupants more.
“Let me! I can get us in!” he called and the group turned and shuffled around until Draco was facing the wrought iron gate. Draco cleared his throat. “I, Draco Malfoy, have returned home,” he told the gate which contorted and wound itself into a facsimile of a face.
He had been quiet for the last few weeks, always the one outside of a conversation, his eyes unfocused as though he were looking back on a time and place none of them knew about. If you put food in front of him, he would eat it, and he would follow instructions but Draco could tell that Potter wasn’t really present right now. His mind was drifting and with Weasley and Hermione back to being friends (though possibly grudgingly, in Hermione’s case), Draco felt the silence more often than not. He had not yet reached the point where he could exist comfortably with them all in silence, and he felt like Potter needed to anchor him in some way, though he couldn’t tell him that.
"Not much movement overnight I'm afraid," he said, and Harry scowled at him. He felt Malfoy touch his elbow in a quelling gesture and Harry took a deep breath to calm himself.
"Draco?" she called, leaning forward on her garden swing, and Draco stepped forward, his eyes scanning around him as he walked towards her, wary.
“What’s happened?” he asked, shucking the travelling cloak he had borrowed from the coat rack. Potter turned a stony expression on him and Hermione looked worried.
The house-elves were diving back into their serving hallways just as Mother entered the dining room to take stock. The company may not be deserving of it, but every night she had the table set formally, with crystal wine goblets that had been smashed more than once, either by accident or intent.
“I know, that’s why they’ll be Apparating directly into the bar,” he said simply and Aberforth looked like he was about to protest. “Just send them down the passage when they get here, will you? Thanks a lot,” he said.
“All right!” Potter shouted, and he dropped the wands in his hands. Weasley did the same, raising his hands to shoulder height.
“It’ll come to you. There’s always happiness to be found,” Potter said simply and Draco bobbed his head in agreement before they lapsed into companionable silence, Draco reading his book and Potter observing the world around them.
Hermione woke him at the crack of dawn - quite literally. Harry squinted at the window in his room as Hermione bustled out and he could just see the pink fingers of dawn creeping up behind the London skyline. He showered in the ensuite and dressed in a navy suit and tie, ran a comb through his hair without hoping for any miracles, and then made his way downstairs, charming his gown to shrink to fit in his pocket as he went.
The cottage loomed out of the darkness like a shipwreck under the waves. The hedge was wild around it, and there was rubble, large stones and pieces of singed wood, peeking through the snow-laden grass. The cottage, to Draco’s great surprise, was still standing, though was mostly covered in dark ivy and snow. The right side of the top floor looked like an explosion had blasted through it, the plaster on the front of the building still blackened with soot after all this time. The window panes had shattered, either by the force or in the intervening years, and Draco saw the remaining fragments twinkle in the dim light from the stars.
He changed quickly and climbed into bed, pulling the drapes shut around his bed. He settled down to sleep, but, like it had done during his sixth year, it eluded him. And when he finally did fall asleep, hours after Blaise, Crabbe, Goyle and Theodore Nott had all gone to sleep, he did not dream.
“Finnigan,” Carrow eventually said and Seamus Finnigan stood up from the cluster of Gryffindors, his face pale but his eyes determined. He moved to join Draco in front of the desks and held himself stiffly, as though he was waiting to pounce. Draco couldn’t look him in the eyes.
He shook his head, trying to clear it, and looked up to see the snake on the floor, eyeing him hungrily. She curled around herself, an undulating mass, and Draco had to choke back the urge to scream. The Dark Lord stood next to her beside the fireplace, the only light source in the room, and before him, to Draco’s left, were two moaning figures, huddled on the floor.
“Sorry, no, but look!” she said, pointing at the dark stone she was crouched in front of. Potter stooped down and Draco came in next to him, squinting into the darkness to see the name carved into the lichen-spotted granite. ‘
She pulled back the fabric to reveal that locket, the one that had been hanging from the bedpost all those nights ago, burning white hot in the centre of Potter’s chest. It looked like it had basically melted into his skin, red and angry blisters appearing along either side of it.
After paying, Harry nodded his thanks to the bartender and shoved his wallet in his pocket, and picked up the glasses, winding his way back to the corner where Hermione sat. She looked up as he approached and closed her book again, taking the offered glass from his hand.
“Are we going down?” Draco eventually asked as he felt his stomach drop slightly. Harry shifted slightly and craned his head to look – Draco checked as well. The deep cool colours of mountains and valleys patchworked the land below and they grew closer with every second. The dragon began to bank, turning itself in great spiraling circles, apparently aiming for one of the smaller lakes below.
"I hope it's not as dreary on the inside as it was when I left," he murmured and Harry scowled at him, storming off towards the front door steps. He pulled his wand free of its concealed pocket and tapped it against the door, which clicked open. Inside, the lights flared to life, a gentle welcoming glow which Harry felt at odds with.
He dreamed still. Most nights, he begged Potter to let him know where he was. Draco found he could, in some ways, control the dreams. He allowed Potter to see where he had been, to see the forests and woods that Draco had walked through until his heels blistered and his boots, worn for the Herbology class he had never attended, cracked, the leather softening. Still, Potter would not reveal where he was.
“What is that supposed to mean?” she asked testily and he was about to reply but Potter interrupted them.
There were noises of agreement, though Hermione’s could also have been of protest, and then Harry shouted “NOW!” and let go.
“I’m Draco Malfoy,” he murmured to their bones and the wind shifted, as though they could hear him. “I – I haven’t been a very good person. My family isn’t a good family. I’m sure we’re responsible, in some way, for your deaths. I’m –” and he gulped in cold winter air, tears stinging his eyes. “I’m so sorry. Your son – he’s
“Yes, Master Malfoy?” she asked, and he crouched until they were at eye level, her eyes wide in wonderment.
“Surely you can see that she’s just trying to survive, Draco,” Snape hissed, leaning forward in his chair so suddenly that Draco flinched back. One corner of Snape’s mouth was raised in a sneer. “After the events of June, she–”
The house tables were gone, and survivors were crowded into the room, standing in groups in various states of injury. Madam Pomfrey was amongst them, dabbing wounds with smoking dittany and resetting bones with taps of her wand. Draco could see the heaving flank of a centaur on the platform as he turned to survey the room. Behind him, Harry had stopped dead.
trunk," he said and it lifted into the air and began wobbling towards him, catching briefly on the doorway to Albus' room. He cast the same spell at Scorpius' trunk and set off down the stairs, both trunks drifting lazily behind him.
“How was the lake?” Hermione asked as she fished out three bowls from the cabinets in the kitchen. She paused for a second after setting them on the side and then grabbed another, before reaching for the paper bag – she pulled a silver flask out and began to unscrew the lid that was inlaid with the Hogwarts crest.
“I thought I would better serve the Dark Lord by trying to find Potter myself. Unfortunately I have been – unsuccessful,” he added a little reluctantly and Greyback let out one of those bark-like laughs again.
There was a shout from behind him and Draco saw Death Eaters begin to chase the fleeing motorbike, calling out to each other, though he couldn’t make out what they were saying. Another Thestral careened out of nowhere and Draco fell back, though they weren’t close to him. He blinked as yet another Potter on the Thestral shouted something over the noise. Sat in front of him, Kingsley Shacklebolt shouted something back, his wand drawn and firing off spell after spell as the Thestral dove and weaved between the Death Eaters. They disappeared into the darkness, a group of Death Eaters chasing after them.
. He sighed and disentangled himself from the bedding, swinging his legs over the side and standing. He wouldn’t be able to go back to sleep for a little while, otherwise he’d risk falling straight back into the nightmare. He padded over to the dresser against the wall and rummaged through his backpack laid atop it, pulling out some books. It had been extended with Hermione’s handy charm that she had taught him a few years ago, and Harry always thanked his stars for her.
“Maybe they’ll be too scared to tell him?” he suggested and Draco grinned. Harry’s hand smoothed down Draco’s back, “Maybe they’ll cover up–”
“I know,” he replied solemnly and Ron turned away, wiping his eyes again. Harry was there too and Draco realised that all three of them were crying. Hermione’s bottom lip was quivering, and tears streamed down her face. Ron was just leaking tears, silent and shaking and Harry was gasping with barely controlled sobs. Draco pulled Harry to him, tucking his head under his chin, and Harry took a shuddering breath. They all took a second to get themselves under control.
"The only party we think could fit what we're looking for is Rothbart Yaxley. He supposedly died during the Battle of Hogwarts, but his body was never recovered. His son, Fergus, died too, though his body was found in one of the corridors on the fifth floor. Ron has a theory that Yaxley Senior might've survived," she explained, Yaxley's name glowing gold from the wall.
“Surely there have been whispers,” Blaise encouraged and Draco sniffed, shifting a little in the armchair, uncomfortable. There had been rumours all summer, but he had managed to keep Potter’s secrets so far.
The street was quiet and nearly empty. The few other shoppers around scurried past them, their eyes averted, and Draco knew what they saw. He had been dressed up for the occasion, in a dark shirt and trousers, a high-necked cloak clasped around his neck with a serpent pin. He certainly looked the part of the Death Eater Scion. Blaise was dressed more casually than them both, in a linen shirt and trousers, but his high sweeping cheekbones and rich umber skin told even the most casual observers who his mother was, and exactly why she shouldn’t be trifled with. Cecelia Zabini was the most terrifying woman Draco had ever met.
And if he had chosen to live in Australia for a little bit of anonymity, well, that was his decision alone.
“His name was Tom Riddle,” she told him gently and he took a shaky breath. “He’s just a man. Or he will be, once we find the rest of these Merlin-damned Horcruxes,” she said viciously, turning back to her book. “Harry also thinks he’s searching for something else – a wand?”
"I WILL KILL YOU, MALFOY!" he screamed into the dark abyss of the house, and somewhere behind him, he heard Begbie drop his hands into his face. So much for the element of surprise.
This was Draco’s home, but it didn’t feel like that anymore. The comfort he had once found by being enclosed in the stone walls of Malfoy Manor had long since disappeared during the course of this last hellish summer. Everywhere he turned, he found unfamiliar faces skulking in rooms or stalking down corridors and he had taken to hiding in his rooms, hoarding what books he could snatch from the library while it was empty, and feigning sickness whenever his mother asked him to join her and their
Did they, any of them, really trust each other? Could they rely on each other in a fight? Draco didn’t think so. He thought that half of them would sell their Grandmothers for a minute of the Dark Lord’s time. He thought the Dark Lord might accept their trade, in some cases.
With his expression relaxed, Harry could see the boys in him. They had both inherited his blond hair (though Scorpius' was darker and Albus' curled), though both boys had Harry's bright green eyes. But there was something about their faces, sometimes - the catch of the light of their cheekbones, the curves of their smiles, that reminded Harry so much of Malfoy that it ached, just for a second.
, apparently. The twin turned to his brother, elated. “You actually are joking, Perce… I don’t think I’ve heard you joke since you were–”
“What do you seek, young Mr Malfoy?” the Baron asked in his low, gravelly voice. Draco had only heard him speak once before. It had been when he had spent the night sleeping in the Great Hall with the rest of the school after Sirius Black had broken in on Halloween in his third year. He had been awake, listening to the hum of whispers around him, when he had heard the Baron speaking to someone else, pleading it sounded like.
Draco clung to the desperate hope that Snape didn’t know. Because if he had known, surely he would’ve put a stop to it. Surely he wouldn’t allow students to be tortured as part of a teaching curriculum?! Draco held fast to that hope. Despite what Snape would tell him in his office now, Draco had to tell him of the torture going on in his classrooms.
“Oh yeah, I remember,” Potter said, having noticed his shudder. “You tortured Rowle, didn’t you?” he asked and Draco had the presence of mind to be a bit shocked by the bluntness of the question, but he nodded.
“Narcissa isn’t here, Draco,” the Dark Lord said with a chuckle and Draco’s heart dropped. He had hoped maybe one of them was in a darkened corner of the room, but without them near… “Stand up, boy,” the Dark Lord snapped and Draco clambered shakily to his feet. “Yaxley, his wand,” and from behind Draco, Yaxley forced the slim length of wood into his shaking hand. “You may go, Yaxley. Go back to the Weasley house, search for the blood traitors,” the Dark Lord commanded him and the door shut behind Draco with a final-sounding
“Do you think we should have children?” Draco asked, waving as Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Viktor began to slip away from them, the platform falling away. The question had come up a few times in the last year, and it was one Draco dwelled on at night when he couldn’t sleep. Harry, warm and real, hummed next to him, slipping his fingers through Draco’s.
“I should head off. I’m due back in France this week,” he said with a smile and Hermione nodded, reaching out a hand. Malfoy hesitated but then took it, and they shook.
“On that note, I think it best to end the class for the day,” Slughorn said with a wheeze. As his classmates began to pack up their things, Slughorn called over the class. “Stay behind Mr Malfoy, please,” and Draco gave Blaise a long-suffering look. Blaise, supportive as ever, merely shrugged and lifted his satchel onto his shoulder and filtered out of the room with the other students. Draco wound his way around the classroom to stand next to Slughorn’s desk. “Unchopped bitter root in an Exstimulo Potion, Mr Malfoy? I’m sure you know better,” Slughorn said chidingly, as he lowered himself into the chair behind his desk, the leather creaking.
“Not as yet. He should be here on the hour, according to Bellatrix,” Mother said and Snape made a noise of acknowledgement. The carriage clock on the stone fireplace showed that they had mere minutes before the Dark Lord came.
He stepped through the small doorway and nearly fell to his knees. The library was double-storied, a small balcony running the length of the room, bookcases above and below it, and each row crammed with books. One section had chains running down it, and another section was kept behind a glass door, but the rest of the books were organised and freely available.
“But what if they spot you!” Hermione said desperately, her eyes wide and pleading and Draco shrugged on shoulder.
Harry held up his hands and all fell silent, the portraits slipping back into their seats, eager to hear what Harry had to say, though Harry only had eyes for Dumbledore’s portrait.
But between the howling wind, the crashing waves and the quiet, desperate noises that Harry made, it had been perfect.
“Very well,” the Dark Lord said, his voice acidic. “If that is your choice, Longbottom, we revert to the original plan. On your head be it,” he said dangerously and then he raised his wand. There was a moment of silence while they waited for the result and then something came careening out of one of the castle’s broken windows, landing with a thud in the Dark Lord’s outstretched hand. He shook it roughly and Draco gaped as the Sorting Hat, dusty from disuse, unfurled in the early morning light.
But now, a year to the day since the boys had been kidnapped, he smiled at Harry from behind his toast and glanced up at the ceiling, where a muffled banging signalled that one of the boys was attempting to move his trunk.
"Mr. P!" Belinda shouted through the door, which was pulled ajar, and Harry looked over. She had poked her head through the gap, a pained look on her face. "I've a man here to see you Sir, said it's important, won't take no for an answer. Tall, skinny, blond - actually, if I didn't know better, I'd say he looked just like Scorpius, Sir, just a bit more… pointy," she commented and there was a noise of outrage from the person just outside the door.
“Not until tomorrow morning,” he said and Hermione nodded, reaching out and looping her arm through his.
“I can’t see them, though. And I need to find–” he went quiet and Draco studied him, watching until the Knut dropped and Potter sprang up from the plinth. “Come on, come on, we need to find–!” he shouted as he ran back for the staircase, Draco taking off after him, diving into the sea of students who were fleeing the castle.
He lay in the dark as dawn began to creep over the estate, but he didn’t go back to sleep. He listened to the noise outside and pushed himself up onto his elbows when two Death Eaters stopped to talk just outside his room.
“So, when do we have to be there?” Harry asked, checking his watch. Hermione pulled out a large wad of paper from her satchel and opened it up to the top page, scanning it quickly.
“RON!” Granger screamed into the panicked crowd. “Ron, where are you?!” The sound of rapid popping broke through the screams of the crowd and masked and robed figures appeared on the dancefloor – Death Eaters. Draco pushed through the scene, trying to keep up with unknown Weasley and Granger as they waded through the crowd, though Granger started sounding more and more terrified as they continued. He couldn’t see Potter anywhere, but Granger was not calling for him. Draco realised as he moved, the dream seemed to shift and turn around the mysterious cousin, and with a frown, he tried to figure out who he might be.
“Did Dobby let you out?” Draco hissed at Potter who nodded, touching his shoulder to lean in front of him and look inside the drawing room.
“Fine, we’ll go. But Draco–” he said and Draco looked over at him, an eyebrow raised. “You have to stay with the tent. If Lovegood’s an avid supporter, he’ll probably curse you on sight,” he pointed out and Draco thought about protesting but he conceded the point.
“It’s about the mark, isn’t it? The one from the book and on the grave. Didn’t you say Viktor Krum had told you it was Grindelwald’s mark?” he asked Potter who nodded.
“You know what, little girly? This picture looks a hell of a lot like you,” Greyback said and Hermione squeaked.
Harry, bare-chested, stirred next to him and blinked up at him sleepily. The oval mark left behind from the Horcrux burning into his chest had a shine to it in the dim light. A wash in one of the working basins had uncovered cuts and bruises that neither of them had noticed, and Draco could see one on Harry’s chin, red and raw.
He let the stairs carry him down to the open corridor and then he pressed his face to the cool stone next to the gargoyle, which sniffed in derision at his obvious emotional state. His mother’s letter was still clenched in his hand, but he didn’t need to reread it to understand it’s meaning.
He found the stream not too far away and crouched down next to it, sticking his hands in first. It was piercingly cold and his fingers instantly ached with it, but he splashed the water up his arms and then cupped some in his hands and splashed his face with it.
What he had done was unforgivable, and Harry had made sure that his name was stricken from every record, every piece of paperwork relating to the boys, made sure that he couldn't contact them or talk to them, or even come within 100 feet of them.
“Took you long enough, Greyback!” he shouted over the clearing. The Snatchers who were holding him loosened their hold in shock and Draco shrugged them off, tugging his jumper straight. “I’ve been trying to get someone to help me for ages,” he said, his voice changing to cool and measured, the mask of the Heir of Malfoy slipped back on. He felt his features smooth into haughty neutrality and he could see Hermione gaping at him from where she was being propped up between two Snatchers. He gave her a blank look and turned back to Greyback, who was watching him with something like confusion.
“So,” Granger began, cradling the mug in her hands. Draco held his close too, enjoying the warmth. “Why are you here?” she asked Draco, giving him a look over the fire. The firelight caught her skin and made it glow in the darkness. Draco took a long sip of tea, even though it was still hot enough to scald the top of his mouth.
“Then we shall begin. Fellow Braithwaite, I believe you had a question regarding Mr Potter’s answer in General I?” he said, looking across the circle and the Fellow sat there nodded.
“I’m fine. It’s just… well, it made me think of when we were running from the Ministry of Magic, that’s all,” she said, kicking off her heels and letting them land with a clatter at the foot of the stairs. Harry toed off his shoes and nudged them to one side, following Hermione through to the kitchen. She paused at the fridge and frowned. “Would you like something alcoholic or not?” she asked and Harry sat down at the kitchen table.
“No, I don’t think so,” he said and Granger made a noise of agreement. Draco gaped at the pouch, the cloak now hidden therein.
“Would sir be liking some Headache Tonic?” it asked in a squeaky voice and Draco stared at it for a second before nodding and taking the glass, draining it in two gulps. He held the empty glass out and the house-elf took it from him. “Can Mibby be getting sir another glass?” she asked and Draco shook his head.
“I can’t be sure, Father,” he said, trying to keep his voice even. “He’s been hit by some curse, I can’t tell,” he added and his mother made a soothing noise.
“Dumbledore said it. He said fear of the name increases fear of the thing itself. I won’t be scared to say his name,” he said firmly and Draco’s heart swelled a little to hear it, and he nodded.
you,” Draco said back, wiping a hand under his eyes furiously. “He gave me hope,” and he hiccupped a sob, tears building and streaming down his cheeks now. “He saw that I was capable of the change he once underwent. He gave me hope and it was dashed a second later and I will never,
"Oh Merlin, Albus," he said, pressing his face into his son's mop of hair. He released him after a second, holding his son slightly away from him, studying his features. Albus had a cut lip and some crusted blood under his nose, but aside from general grime on his skin, he looked to be in one piece, though very tearful. He looked up at Harry again and started crying, telling Harry something unintelligible, and Harry brought him in for another hug.
"They're not your sons. You… you walked away, you signed all the paperwork, you didn't raise them. Merlin, you didn't even turn up for their first journey to Hogwarts, you can't possibly think that they're your sons," Harry spat out at him, shaking Luna off and rising to his feet. Malfoy scowled at him, his eyes ablaze.
“Well it’s not done yet Isla, but let’s go see where they’re at with it. It’s this way,” she said sweetly and the little girl, Isla, skipped along next to them as they walked down the path. A stone maze? Draco turned and followed them at a discreet distance, trying to not look like someone who was desperately lost. The walk was gently sloping but Draco was so exhausted that by the time they reached the plateau, he was nearly out of breath. He paused behind the family as they surveyed the site.
“Potter!” Draco shouted into the woods. Frost bit at his nose and ears and the leaves were crunchy under his boots as he trudged further in the forest. The trees didn’t answer his call and he turned in a circle slowly, trying to find that tell-tale glimmer of wards, but none showed in the dimming light. Annoyance flushed through him and he shucked his backpack, letting it fall to the ground behind him. “For Merlin’s Sake, Potter, I know you’re in this godforsaken forest with Granger, let me in!” he shouted into the silence.
“We’d heard,” he said and Draco sighed. “I thought you’d be pleased. He’s your favourite teacher, isn’t he?” he asked and Draco quirked an eyebrow at him.
“An interesting choice,” she commented and Malfoy made a small noise of agreement, but didn't elaborate any further. Hermione paused for a moment, lingering a bit too long while waiting for Malfoy to fill up the silence, before she spoke again. “Well, I read Jurisprudence at Magdalen College, just down the road,” she said, making a vague gesture with her free hand to outside somewhere. “And Harry, well he-,”
Goyle screamed as he was hauled onto the broom behind Draco, sending them pitching. A great Chimaera of flame hissed at them as they rolled too close and swiped it’s giant claws at them as Harry righted them, pulling them into a steep climb that felt too slow, too heavy. Goyle’s hands were heavy on Draco’s hips, holding on tightly, as Harry forced them into a sharp turn.
“It doesn’t hurt anymore,” he murmured and Potter made a small sound and rolled his head back, exposing the long line of his neck. Draco looked away as Potter blinked sleepily, his eyes slitted as if he was fighting sleep off for the moment.
There wasn’t a queue at the bar and the bartender was quick to serve him Hermione’s requested wine and his pint of pale ale, and Harry felt a pang of nostalgia. Nothing could replace an English pub, though the Australians had definitely tried - it wasn’t quite the same, though.
Potter stirred when Draco appeared and he blinked up at him from the floor. He sat up and frowned, though he didn’t reach for his glasses, which were folded neatly next to the line of cushions that had been pulled onto the floor to make a makeshift mattress. His hair was a riot, much like always, though made worse from sleep and the fight with Rowle and Dolohov. But his eyes caught the pale moonlight coming in through the thin curtains and gleamed bright in the darkened room. And his scar, that famous scar, which fractured down from his hairline to his right eye, positively glowed.
“I told them you were brave, and kind. That you made people want to be better, just by virtue of being around you,” he admitted and Potter gave him a brilliant smile.
? Granger charged on with her story. “His father abandoned his mother while she was pregnant, and then she died shortly after childbirth. He was raised in a Muggle orphanage in London – yes,” she cut him off before he could ask, “We did try to visit it, but it’s since been razed to the ground and replaced with an office building. He was taken from the orphanage at 11 and went to Hogwarts and has basically spent the time since trying to erase any mention of his Muggle heritage. He even killed his father and grandparents, did you know that?” she asked and Draco shook his head, stunned.
“Oh,” Ron said, sounding dejected. “Yeah… Well, I’m hungry!” he added defensively and as if on cue, his stomach rumbled loud enough for them all to hear.
“Lovegood called them. Luna – she was taken from the train on the way home. She’s being kept hostage by them, due to his pro-Potter message,” she explained and she cast a pained look at Potter, who was running a hand roughly through his hair. “He thought if he could give them Harry, he could get Luna back,” she added quietly and Draco nodded. He didn’t know Luna Lovegood well – he had heard the mutterings about her from the Ravenclaws and knew her as a friend of Potters, and of course they were distantly related through their mothers, but he had never spoken to her. Still, the idea of her being snatched from the train was somehow painful.
Albus' football cleats were kicked into a corner by the staircase, still muddy even after Harry had told him repeatedly to put them in the utility room. A stack of Scorpius' books were piled precariously on the bottom step, awaiting their owner to return them to their place on the bookshelves in his room upstairs. One of their jumpers, knitted by Mrs. Weasley, lay crumpled over the banister. Harry reached for it, stumbling to take it down and bring it to his face, and he buried his nose in it. He inhaled.
“Help,” he wheezed, trying to push it off and then hands were on him, pulling the stone away, and then Hermione was pulling him to his feet, her face bloodied and tearstained. “What – Who–?” he asked, her expression instantly recognisable – grief. He prayed with all his might for the second it took her to tell him. ‘
“You’re hiding then,” Draco asked, feeling a wash of relief go over him, and Potter nodded, tugging his t-shirt straight. He was only wearing his boxers and the t-shirt, obviously using them as makeshift pyjamas, and Draco glanced down to see he was still wearing the trousers and shirt he had tortured Rowle in. One cuff was stained with blood and he shuddered as he remembered the screams.
“-join you when hell freezes over!” Neville was saying, upright now, and he pushed a fist in the air. “DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY!” he shouted and there was an answering cheer from the crowd, breaking whatever charm had been placed for a second time. Draco watched, his heart thudding wildly in his throat as the Dark Lord surveyed Neville through narrowed eyes.
than what I had. And you don’t think he was capable of change? What about me? Do you think I’m capable of change?” he said desperately, and he could see dawning horror on Hermione’s face. His throat constricted and his eyes stung and one of his hands shook. “Do you think I’ll be a Dark wizard forever? I’m seventeen you know, the same age he was – am I now set in stone? Am I cursed forever to be a bad person because of one,-” and he stuck one finger up as Potter gaped at him. Draco was suddenly furious. “– one stupid
“It’s about as good a lead as we have,” he admitted and Potter’s face fell a little. He turned back to Hermione.
"Draco," Harry said quietly, almost like a moan, looking down at the floor. Draco paused and looked over his shoulder, down at the floor and at Harry's anguished expression. He stepped back a few steps and took Harry's hand in his own, held it tight.
“You made it?” Draco asked, his voice sounding distant even to his own ears. Blaise nodded and heaved himself up to stand, coming over to Draco and looking down at the bodies before him as Draco turned back to look at them.
!’s), kept silent as Harry panted and swung forward once more. The heat was crawling up Draco’s ankles now, the suit of armour’s replicas causing a domino effect of items being knocked and springing into ten or more duplicates. Weasley and Hermione were already treading on plates and goblets and carriage clocks, making noises of pain.
“He fell off a sofa in the common room, Madam Pomfrey, and I’m concerned he might have hit his head,” Blaise said smoothly and Draco nodded. Pomfrey sighed and lifted her wand, lighting only the tip.
“I could ask you the same question,” he said icily and Potter gave him a warning look. Draco decided to charge ahead regardless. “Didn’t you walk away months ago? Why are you back now?” and Weasley gaped at him.
The arms around Draco tightened and he hiccupped once, coming back to himself. He looked over Harry’s shoulder to see the body of Snape still lying there, and he looked away.
Rain lashed the windows as Draco took a step back. Harry opened hazy eyes and looked at him with a half-lidded gaze. His lips were bruised and swollen, and his chest heaved. Draco studied him hungrily and nodded his head. “I want to,” he said firmly and Harry’s brain took a second to catch what he said, but then he grinned and pulled Draco back to him.
, you mean?” Draco replied in a harsh whisper, the words strangled and something in Snape’s expression softened.
“It burned tonight. It’s not normally this dark,” Draco said, pushing his hair back away from his face.
“Can you carry ‘Ermione?” she asked Ron, her voice softly accented. Her silver blonde hair was tied in a practical plait down her back and she had her arms wrapped around herself. “Zere is a spare bedroom upstairs if you can take her?” she suggested and Ron nodded. He looped an arm under Hermione’s knees and her back and lifted her, tucking her against his chest. Unconsciously, Hermione turned to hide her face in his neck and wound an arm around his neck. Ron flushed red but looked stoically ahead as Fleur led him upstairs.
"Why aren't they doing anything?" Hermione muttered, annoyed, from behind Harry, and he resisted the urge to whip around and glare at her. If she thought she was feeling impatient-!
“It was very strange, Draco. I could’ve sworn that just before you fell off the couch, you shouted ‘Potter’,” Blaise said with a chuckle and Pomfrey’s wand froze for a second before drawing another rune. Laguz.
“Well, they keep on the move, don’t they? Like us,” he said proudly. “Speaking of, I think we should go to–” he started, but Potter cut him off.
“Have you –” Harry breathed and Draco tried to catch where Potter was going with the question while his body ached. “Have you ever, um–?” Harry tried again, placing a hot kiss on Draco's sharp jaw, and Draco understood what he was saying.
“You look very smart darling,” she told him in an undertone and if he had been twelve, he would’ve been strutting all the way to dinner, but now the idea of sticking out like a sore thumb plagued him. Too many times to count, he had been jeered at and called names at the dinner table, words that the Death Eaters wouldn’t have dared to say had he not fallen from grace.
“You were looking for me?” he asked, going for a light tone as he stepped out from between the statue and bust. Snape surveyed him, taking in his pale skin, the dark smudges under his eyes, the jumper he had worn three days in a row, despite the blazing summer heat, because it was all too much right now.
, Harry would reflect later. Every day he returned to Malfoy Manor after spending the morning with Hermione at Grimmauld Place, and Draco would greet him enthusiastically and kiss him, before handing him books relevant to his research, and they would spend the rest of the afternoon sat in comfortable silence reading, trading the occasional kiss when passing books over for the other to read interesting passages. If Mrs Malfoy thought anything strange was going on, she never mentioned it, but she started to smile broadly whenever Harry appeared on her doorstep, and Harry came to enjoy seeing her eyes wrinkle in the corners as she smiled.
. So I will be – for him. For me. Because that’s what Harry Potter does – he makes you want to be so much better than you are,” he admitted to them, the first people to ever hear this confession, and the leaves in the yew tree overhead rustled in acknowledgement. He bowed his head, and then took a breath and blinked to clear away the tears, and then pulled the cloak back on over his head, turning to catch up to Granger and Potter. Behind him, the white marble shone in the snow and the petals of the roses and lilies rustling in the wind.
had the Elder Wand?” Draco asked into the silence left in the wake of that revelation. Ron’s mouth was open, apparently he was about to ask the same thing. Draco shook his head. “Where did he keep it though? Surely it wasn’t with him the whole time?” he asked and Potter gave him a grim look. Draco gaped and then shook his head, looking around in a panic. “We need to go then. If we leave right now, we might be able to get there in time!” he said and Ron frowned at him.
“Likewise, Malfoy,” Hermione replied to his greeting, elbowing Harry sharply in the ribs, shaking him out of his reverie. He hissed and glared at her, but her gaze remained impassive and trained on Malfoy. “How have you been?” she asked, stepping closer. She was trying to engage Malfoy in conversation, and Harry was stunned to see that Malfoy was actually going for it, if the fact that he had leaned forward was anything to go by.
“They caught up with us at West Bilney Woods. Dirk got lazy, didn’t set up the wards properly. Him and Ted – well, they took the brunt of it,” Dean said softly and Ron patted his shoulder sympathetically. Dean blinked rapidly and took a sip of his tea. “What about you, Luna?” he asked.
They Disapparated the following morning, leaving Draco to feel like a mother sending her children off to war. Potter gave him an encouraging smile, Hermione gave him a hug, Weasley nodded brusquely and then they stepped out of the wards, disappearing into the early morning light.
After a year of being back in Grimmauld Place, Draco had long since gotten used to the boys' quirks and charms. Scorpius was a bit of an insomniac, while Albus slept like the dead. Albus was loud and brash and laughed hard, while Scorpius was quiet, reserved, and fairly emotional. Albus' anger burned hot and bright for a short amount of time, while Scorpius could hold a grudge like it was a sport. And some of these things, Draco had learned the hard way. When he had been cornered in the kitchen on Sunday morning, and had a very formal conversation with the boys about Harry, during which they both subtly threatened to make his life very miserable if he hurt their Dad, Draco had been left feeling both proud and fond of his boys, and could see exactly why the Sorting Hat had put them both in Slytherin. (He also believed every word they had said and vowed never to so much as make Harry a bit upset if it meant preserving his own life.)
“You wanted to see us, sir?” Isobel asked and Snape looked up from the papers on his desk. He laid down the handsome peacock feather quill he had been using and gestured for them to take the seats in front of the desk. Isobel tucked her robes around her neatly as she sat down, while Draco just lowered himself into the chair.
“You’re reading my letters?” Draco asked, his voice quavering a little. Snape sniffed, his expression neutral.
“We need to get the snake,” Draco said after a few seconds of silence. Harry’s hands were fisted in the jumper he wore, and he felt him tighten his grip, pulling the fabric taught. “That’s it. Just the snake, and then it’s all over,”
As the meal drew to a close, many of the Death Eaters were pleasantly buzzed on the wine and were languidly draped over their chairs, talking amongst themselves, largely ignoring his family which had given them food and shelter throughout the summer. But there was an energy in the room, a feeling of anticipation clogging the air, and Draco felt a thrill of adrenaline every time the dining room door opened. Inevitably it had been a late-comer or an elf bringing more food, but he couldn’t resist looking up every time the large oak door creaked. As the wine bottles began to run dry, the door opened once more, and Severus Snape slipped in.
His office was in disarray, with files lain across every surface, and one wall requisitioned for some sort of Case Summary which included a very complicated spider diagram (possibly showing the connections between several Death Eater families), and list of names, with a few crossed out. Harry recognised Hermione's handwriting, Merlin help him.
“Give me Harry Potter,” the Dark Lord intoned from everywhere and Draco’s head whipped around, spotting Harry further down the table, his face tilted upwards to the ceiling which still calmly reflected the night sky, at odds with the words around them. “And none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded. You have until midnight.”
“‘The Tale of the Three Brothers is a story – a story about how humans are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as hiding under the invisibility cloak, we’d have everything we need already!” she snapped and Weasley gave her a petulant look.
“About what?” he replied and she cast a look around the room, as if to check that no one was listening.
,” he said and the spell fizzled and died before it could even leave his wand, sending a feeble spark drifting to the floor. He could feel the Dark Lord’s eyes trained on him and he shivered but tried again, thinking not of the writhing human in front of him but the fear that had fuelled him all summer, fear that had turned into resentment, that had turned into
Hermione and Ron listened keenly as well, and all three of them made appropriate noises of shock and awe as Harry explained in detail what he had seen. Harry paused to take a breath.
"Encouraging words, there," Ron murmured, and Harry nodded. He turned to look at Ron and Hermione, and they looked at him expectantly. His mouth felt dry and his grip flexed on his wand, while he thought of the words he wanted to say.
” me and nearly killing me in the process,” Potter said with another laugh. “I set him free actually – hid a sock in the journal and your dad threw it at him. You should’ve seen his face,” Potter said with another laugh and Draco felt his jaw go a bit slack.
!” Amycus cried. The red light flared and Longbottom began to convulse but he didn’t scream. He fell back onto the floor hard enough to knock his head and still, Longbottom didn’t scream. Amycus kept pushing him, and still Longbottom remained silent.
"How was last night?" she asked him quietly, and Harry tucked his face into her bushy hair for a moment, taking a second to pretend they were young again, though they had never been carefree.
Blaise was right, it wasn’t as bad as it had been. The ruined red flesh was gone, but his arm was still weeping blood from the lines carved there, dividing the Dark Mark. A large ‘T’.
“Thank you, sir,” he said, his voice catching. There was a beat of silence. “I’m sorry, for what I–” he began but Dumbledore held up a hand and stopped him.
“You’ll get there,” Potter said and Draco huffed. He gave him an encouraging smile. “You will. It took Hermione ages, longer than you would think it would. You haven’t failed yet, you’re still trying,” Potter scuffed his shoe against Draco’s again and Draco gave him another scowl. “Do you know what Patronus your family has? Sometimes it can help to picture one you’ve seen before,” Potter suggested and Draco rolled his eyes.
die when there’s no one left who remembers them,” he explained quietly and Potter began to blink rapidly. Draco watched, his heart clenched in sympathy, as Potter’s borrowed face crumpled and the tears began to fall. Draco tightened his hand on Potter’s shoulder even as it shook with suppressed sobs. Granger, her own bottom lip trembling, reached out and took Potter’s hand and Draco longed to do the same, to provide comfort, but hidden under the cloak he couldn’t.
“Yes. I weaned myself off it over these last few weeks,” he admitted and Potter quirked an eyebrow but his wand was still raised. Granger bustled out of the tent with three mugs balanced in her hands. She passed one to Draco and then took a seat on another log that had been rolled up and handed Potter another mug, giving him a withering look until he dropped his wand into his lap, where Draco’s now rested.
“Draco’s in the library, Mr Potter, if you want to follow me,” she said, glancing over her shoulder as she turned down a narrow passageway. Harry followed and she led him down a dark corridor to a door set in against the wood panelling, knocking on it once, pausing to listen for a reply. There was no answer that Harry could hear, but Mrs Malfoy opened the door anyway, poking her head in. “Draco, Mr Potter is here,” she said and then she stepped back and gestured for Harry to enter, before walking away.
The minders, for all their lurking, did help with his trunk and once it was loaded onto the train, he gave a perfunctory farewell to his bleary-eyed father and then climbed aboard the Hogwarts Express
“Do you want to stay here Friday night then?” Hermione suggested and Harry gave a small smile, though he knew she couldn’t see it.
Creevey, McGonagall had called him. He had tried to hide behind a group of seventh-years, what seemed like years ago. He was dead now too, so small compared to the others.
“Miss Granger is not here, Miss MacDougal,” Snape said icily and Isobel kept a neutral expression on her face. “She was not on the train coming to school yesterday, and we have not been able to locate her since August. It was decided, between myself and the board of governors, that it was likely that she would not be returning to school this year, and so, you find yourself in the enviable position of being Head Girl. If you don’t like it,” Snape ground out, sharp and cutting, “you are welcome to return your badge to me now and we will find a suitable replacement,” and then he let his words hang in the air.
“An invisibility cloak?” he said in disbelief and Potter nodded. Draco stepped forward and reached for the empty space where Potter’s body would be. His hand met something solid and he held it for a second while Potter watched his face.
“But it must have been a Patrous,” she finally said, returning to the story. “Couldn’t you see who was casting it? Didn’t you see anyone?” She rounded on Harry, who quirked an eyebrow at her. He tugged the blanket tighter around himself. “And it led you to the sword! I can’t believe this! Then what happened?” she asked, turning back to Weasley, who explained he saw Harry jump into the pool and then dived in after him after it became clear something was wrong. Draco rolled his eyes – typical Gryffindor, leaping headfirst into danger without thinking it through. If they had both drowned and he and Hermione had discovered them… Draco gave an involuntary shudder and Potter looked over at him.
“Good morning. You have three hours to complete your Specialised 1 paper. Please turn over your papers and begin,” the Fellow from the night before announced to the hall. There was a wave of rustling paper noises and then the hall fell silent.
"You remember where it is, don't you?" he asked, and he didn't wait for a reply as he turned on his heel and Disapparated away.
“You sound like Hagrid,” Weasley said, stretching his arms out in front of him and wincing as the new skin pulled taut. Draco noticed that Weasley’s strange, winding scars had also reformed. Dittany couldn’t heal everything, the scars over his chest attested to that. Weasley continued, “It’s a dragon, Hermione, it can look after itself. It’s us we need to worry about,” and Hermione blinked at him, frowning.
“Let’s go this way,” she whispered, gesturing down a dark street which led away from the village in the opposite direction they had come in from. They turned again and began walking, careful to keep themselves covered by the cloak, even as Potter jostled Draco. The village square gave way to more cottages decorated with multicoloured lights and Christmas trees watching from the darkened windows.
“I know,” he said with regret. Draco wrapped his arms tighter around himself and shivered. “Hermione, I’m sorry, I’m really–”
“Harry,” he said, reaching out a hand. They shook, though it felt oddly formal after their weeks of letter writing. “Has Granger gone in already?” he asked, jamming his hands into his coat pockets, his nose pink in the cold.
!” he shouted and he raised his wand. Something huge and horned fell out of it, charging towards where the owl and stag had disappeared from, its head lowered, and soon it disappeared from sight. The second the Death Eaters were distracted by the Patronus, Draco had snuck through the shadows and down the side street of Aberforth’s building. He ducked down behind the bins and waited.
and a particularly severe bust of Crispus Malfoy, his six-times great-grandfather. He craned his neck around Aphrodite’s legs and watched as Snape let himself into the long gallery, closing the door quietly behind him.
Draco did not take his seat yet. His father’s back was to him and he watched as his father pushed up the table cloth and dug his nails into the finely polished wood of the dining table, before he relaxed, and then dug them in again. The wood would be scarred now, but Draco couldn’t find it in himself to care. No one would ever see it under the pristine tablecloths laid out every night.
"Oh, Merlin, you came," he murmured, righting Belinda without really looking at her. Malfoy scoffed.
“Let me look,” Draco said, reaching for him but Weasley took a step back, obviously mistrustful. “Oh for Merlin’s sake – If I was here to kill or injure any of you, I would’ve done it long ago. Let me look!” he snapped, hand outstretched, and when Weasley looked to Hermione for reassurance, she gave him an encouraging nod. He still looked like he’d rather do anything else, but he lifted one side of his jumper and shirt and Draco saw some mottled bruises forming over his lower ribcage. “Episkey might take the edge off, but it’s not going to heal it. We’ll have to wrap you,” he said, and Weasley made a pained noise as he breathed in and out. “Hold still –
Voldemort, stuck in the sea of fleeing wizards, was backing into the Great Hall, cursing and shouting instructions to his followers, but none of them seemed to hear him and if they did, they ignored him. Death Eaters fought students and teachers alike in every corner, and Draco caught a glimpse of Ernie Macmillan jinxing Dolohov as he and Neville were finally pushed into the Great Hall.
“STOP OR SHE DIES!” Bellatrix screamed and Draco held his wand up and edged closer. Bellatrix was supporting Hermione, whose head lolled against Bellatrix’s shoulder, a small silver knife pressed to her throat. Draco could see that the arm of Hermione’s jumper was wet and bloody and he took a step forward. “STOP, DRACO!” Bellatrix screamed, pressing the blade closer – a red line appeared under it. She laughed as Draco raised his hands in the air. “Betraying your family for Mudbloods and vermin, Draco – really?” she sneered and he shrugged one shoulder.
"Wiltshire, just outside Amesbury," she said and Malfoy turned back to face the group in the office - he looked as though he had seen a ghost.
“Move!” Amycus snapped at Finnigan who had managed to heave himself up onto all fours. Draco rushed to help him, but Finnigan swatted him away.
“Easy, Greyback,” Scabior called over them and Greyback grinned at him, his sharp teeth glinting yellow in the wandlight.
“You can… get back to… after,” Harry added weakly, Ron turning away to pick his dropped fangs and broomstick too.
“Defense Against the Dark Arts has lost the Defense element to it. Now it’s all about the Dark Arts. And Amycus Carrow – that’s the new professor – has us cursing each other. Or rather, he has the Slytherins cursing everyone else. I went to tell Snape but I overheard him…” He trailed off and Granger raised an eyebrow.
“Thank you, Miss Parkinson,” Professor McGonagall said in a clipped voice that betrayed her barely restrained fury. “You will leave the Hall first with Mr Filch. If the rest of your house could follow,” she said and there was a pause.
“The Chamber of Secrets was only a story though, wasn’t it?” Weasley piped up, settling himself into one of the clean armchairs, sending dust spilling over it. Draco fought not to tell him off. “What if what Lovegood was saying is true?”
“Under-age students must leave!” McGonagall told the table sternly and a few of the younger years stood reluctantly. “I am doing this for your own good – Creevey, Peakes, get up, you are both under-age,” she snapped at two blond boys who had tried to hide behind a group of seventh-years. They reluctantly stood and left, casting glances back at them.
Back in the present, before he could say anything further, there was a knock on the door. Malfoy slid away from the desk and settled himself onto the sofa, picking up a stray file and opening it. Harry watched him for a second, before waving his hand at the door - it opened with a click, revealing Hermione, Ron, Ginny and Luna behind it. They trooped into the office like soldiers reporting for duty, but Hermione broke away from the group and went behind Harry's desk to pull him into a hug.
“Could I have a word, actually?” he asked and Hermione gave him a stern look but disappeared inside the pub, leaving them both on the cobbled street outside. Once Hermione was definitely inside, Draco turned to Harry. “I wanted to ask if you’d like to come to the Manor tomorrow? I’m working on the assumption that you won’t be returning to Australia before you hear about the Fellowship,” he said, almost shyly and Harry smiled.
“Well, well,” Greyback said, his voice a little less confidently now, almost concerned. Could Harry’s lies get them out of this? “If you’ve telling the truth ugly, you’ve got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry. I expect your father will reward us just for picking you up,”
“I’m… I’m fine,” he told her, more to convince himself than her. She didn’t look convinced at all, but she only nodded and then walked away. Hermione patted his hand sympathetically.
“We put up wards. No one can find us with them, or at least that’s what Hermione says,” Potter explained and Draco made a noise of acknowledgement in the back of his throat. They fell into silence again.
The next day was much the same. Draco woke up just as the sun was coming up overhead. He made a batch of porridge on the stove, drizzling a little of the honey that Hermione bought off a farm a few weeks ago over two bowls and then he joined Potter in the doorway. He offered one of the steaming bowls to him, and Potter took it with a smile. Draco sat down on the canvas floor next to him and suppressed a shiver from the chill air that swept over him.
Ron now had all the files out of Harry's filing cabinet, and was meticulously going through them, trying to find a Death Eater whose son had died in the War. Unsurprisingly, there were quite a few of them, and the pile of files for these individuals was slowly building up.
Around dawn, he saw Harry slide out of his sleeping bag and followed. Harry woke Weasley, avoiding Dean and they quickly changed in the semi-darkness before creeping out into the garden. The stars still shone, albeit weakly, overhead as they wound their way to the overlook, Harry holding Draco’s hand in the early morning light. Dobby’s grave, with it’s headstone reading ‘Here Lies Dobby, a Free Elf’, had become part of the landscape now, and a few green shoots were appearing from the now flat earth.
It was a compact but dense patch of woodland. He followed a narrow path inside and the ground was littered with mossy boulders, with no flat surfaces on which to pitch a tent. He ducked under branches and slipped over stones, whispering Potter and Granger’s names as he went but with no response. No response. Overhead the wind rushed through the branches and he thought he could hear the distant barking of dogs, though they disappeared as soon as the wind died down.
“We’ve only got half an hour until midnight, so we need to act fast! A battle plan has been agreed–” Kingsley said and Draco nodded and frowned and pretended he was listening, but he wasn’t. He studied the remaining students and the adults who lingered. There were maybe a hundred and fifty of them in total, if he had to round up. The teachers, the remaining members of the Order of the Phoenix, the seventh-years who had stayed behind and the sixth-years who were in their majority. Draco studied them and tried to imagine them as hardened fighters, but it was no use. He could not imagine them going toe-to-toe with Dark Magic and winning.
“You wish,” he replied, trying to keep his tone playful and Potter smiled at him. Draco crossed his arms over his chest. “What’s your plan?” he asked and Potter looked away from him, back out the window.
“-And Ron stabbed it with the sword!” he said and Hermione gaped at him for a second before turning back to Weasley.
!’ as Hermione hit him on the arm. “Hey, where’s Ginny?” Ron asked and Draco broke from Harry, looking around, frowning.
them," Malfoy snapped angrily, his hands clenched into fists around the edge of the desk. Harry stared at him, and he visibly deflated, hunching over and shaking his head. When he next spoke, his voice was much quieter, "I loved them so much it hurt. I still do," Malfoy explained with a desperately sad smile. "I dream about them most nights, dream about holding them, about kissing their faces. And I wanted to be
“Changed password, at this hour?” he heard Slughorn mutter to himself as he walked through the common room. Draco could hear as Slughorn went from dormitory to dormitory, banging on the doors. “Wake up! Up, all of you! To the Great Hall, immediately!” he was shouting and Draco felt a thrill of fear go down his spine. What had happened?
’s been for you all along! It keeps telling everyone they have to help you!” he said, his voice pitched high and a little excited. Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco wound his way through the castle to the seventh floor, and then to the gargoyle that guarded the entrance to the Headmaster’s Office. It was at rest, still and resolute, and did not even open its eyes when Draco approached.
“You don’t understand. He’s not what he says he is,” he tried to explain to them, but Crabbe shrugged one shoulder.
“We were. I broke up with her last summer. I didn’t want to be… if something happened to me…” Potter seemed to struggle internally for a long moment, worrying his bottom lip with his teeth before he sighed again. “I thought it’d be easier. If we weren’t together,” he finally said and Draco made a small noise of acknowledgement.
“Where did you get this?” Harry asked, pointing to the mantlepiece. Draco was confused for a moment, thinking that Harry was pointing to the portrait, but then he noticed the small rectangular mirror propped up underneath the portrait, wedged up against the frame. He frowned at it.
Potter shuffled over to stand in front of him, and then balanced on one leg, kicking out one trainered foot to knock against Draco’s well-worn boots. Draco looked up at him through his hair and Potter tilted his head, trying to give him an encouraging look.
“He’ll find a way out of it. Goblin’s don’t negotiate like humans do. They have different concepts of what ownership means. The sword,” and he jabbed a finger at Potter. “Is goblin-made. By goblin reckoning, it should have returned to them after Gryffindor died, because they are the original owners, and Gryffindor essentially paid them for the pleasure of borrowing it for his lifetime. They are not going to let us walk out of Gringotts with that sword if they can help it,” he told the trio fiercely and Weasley threw his hands up in the air in exasperation.
A few hours later, Draco sat in the same place Potter had been all night, on a cushion in the tent doorway. He was wearing every jumper Dobby had packed for him, and every pair of socks too, but the cold still bit at his nose and he shivered every now and then. The bluebell fire, as Hermione had called it, had been topped up and it crackled merrily as he cupped the jar in his hands.
"I'll be in my office. Tell me the second something happens," he said and then he and Malfoy made their way into Harry's office. Bel gave them both a smile as they walked past her, and Harry knew she'd be back soon enough with some tea and a spot of breakfast, maybe a croissant or some porridge, though neither Harry or Malfoy had the appetite for it.
“I’m sorry, but to hear you talk about your research…” he said, leaning forward to pick the book up from where it had fallen on the floor. “When did you put all these notes in?” he asked, turning the pages carefully, each one neatly annotated.
’, the Pureblood families with no muggle heritage. Draco nodded, and reached over to open the book somewhere in the middle.
Granger stuck her head out of the tent and Draco looked up at her. “Sugar or milk, Malfoy?” she asked.
“Don’t you feckin’ touch me,'' he growled, and shakily he lifted himself to his feet, using Pansy’s desk to pull himself up. She squealed and leaned back in her chair like he was infectious and Finnigan staggered back to the cluster of Gryffindors who were watching Longbottom helplessly.
