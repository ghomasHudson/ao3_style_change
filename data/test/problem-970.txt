Alone in the kitchen, Harry worked to get himself under control. His eyes fixed unseeing on the abandoned sandwiches, the full coffee cups on the table as he turned the new information over in his head. By the time Draco finished in the shower and returned to the bedroom, a towel wrapped under his arms, Harry was sitting cross-legged on the bed. “We can get more,” he said to Draco’s back.
“Please don’t hide anything else?” Harry asked. “I want to know. I love you, Draco, no matter what you look like. I didn’t fall in love with a penis, I fell in love with you.”
Harry interrupted. “Shouldn’t the potions come first?” he wanted to know. “Wouldn’t it be easier to live as a woman if you look like one?”
She looked at him, her eyes catching the silver moonlight and reflecting it back. “I’d be the test,” she said. “Someone has to be. Maybe they’ll call it the ‘Draco process’ or something.”
She gestured at the empty cups of the bra, her face twisting. “What’s the point?” she asked. “I don’t have anything to put in this.”
“I saw Luna last week,” Harry said, snatching back his hand from Xenophilius’s clammy grip. He wondered how on earth Xenophilius had their floo address. “What can we do for you?”
Harry reached over the table to grip Draco’s chin firmly in his hand. He forced Draco to look at him, his eyes searching his boyfriend’s. “Did you sleep with someone else?” he asked roughly.
Sam nodded once. He stood with his back braced against the door. Harry twitched himself, loosening his wand. He didn’t like having his exit blocked. “The effects, as far as we know, would be permanent,” Sam told them, launching straight in without further pleasantries. “I should get that out of the way. No going back.”
She faced away from the full length mirror as she stripped out of her clothes, shedding trousers and shirt and boxers and socks in a pile. When she reached for them, the silk of the knickers felt almost illicit beneath her fingertips. She was shaking as she pulled them on, trying not to fall over as she hooked them round one large foot, then another. She closed her eyes so she wouldn’t have to see her big, male body against the delicate scrap of clothing, and so she wouldn’t have to see Harry, watching her. She could still feel his eyes on her.
Harry sat in the quiet of Ron and Hermione’s kitchen a while more before he couldn’t bear it any longer. Torturing himself wasn’t helping anything. He had to know.
Harry just smirked, raising Draco’s hand to kiss it. “Aurors are never really off duty,” he reminded Draco. “After we’ve eaten, we should go shopping.”
“No idea,” Harry said. He glanced up. “Are you actually considering working for Xenophilius? Putting together stories on wrackspurts and crumple-horned snorkacks?”
Ron didn’t say anything, and for a moment, Harry wondered if he’d actually spoken, or just thought he had. When Ron wheeled abruptly, Harry wondered if he’d offended Ron somehow. His friend stomped into the kitchen and began thumping about with the kettle.
The soft cups sat empty on her chest, the fabric tenting up over her nipples. She squinted down at her chest and promptly shut her eyes again. “It looks stupid.”
Ron found them on the sofa when he flooed in. “Oh!” he said. “Sorry. Just coming to check you were okay, Harry. I’ve put in the incident report.” He peered down at Draco, tear-stained and puffy-eyed. “Erm…” he said hesitantly. “Um, what’s wrong?”
The healer calling Draco ‘Mr Mafloy’ grated on Harry. He stood. “Thank you,” he said, forcing the words through gritted teeth. “Come on, Draco. We need to think about this.”
Harry had left the pile of underthings in a heap on the floor. Suddenly, Draco hated them. He snatched up the lacy knickers and garter belt, the tiny, barely-there bra that sagged against his flat chest and the soft silk of the stockings. Only yesterday, he’d sat touching them, enjoying the feel of the silk and lace under his fingers. He’d been considering putting them on when Harry had come home early from a case. Flustered, Draco had shoved them under the bed instead of putting them away under a concealment charm behind the books in his bedside table. Stupid.
“It wasn’t always like this- sex in the dark with the curtains shut. We used to get it on anywhere, anytime. Sex with the curtains open. Sex in the shower. Sex in the storeroom at the Ministry. But then, you stopped wanting to. Why?”
“Just because some of us actually have table manners,” Draco muttered darkly as she pushed some curry around her plate with a piece of naan.
“Not you. Just Harry,” Hermione sighed, rolling her eyes ceilingward. “You can go home and start the tea. I’m starving. Come on, Harry.”
Jack grinned. “Hormones. Nightmare.” He leaned down to take a stack of pamphlets from his satchel. “If you’re going to start taking the potions, you’ll need to tell people,” he told Draco. “People will notice the changes. Friends, family, work. I’ve got some stuff here with advice on how you might do it. Some people will be fine with it. Most won’t understand. Some will get angry. Be prepared for that. You might lose friendships, but you’ll find out who your true friends are.”
“Never mind?” Draco arched an eyebrow, but her voice trembled. “I should never have told them. I should have just carried on as I was!” She tried to stay calm, tried to control her emotions like she saw Harry do so often, but she couldn’t. For the third time that day, she broke down in tears.
“No, you don’t,” Harry said softly. She heard the blankets rustle as he got up from his perch on the bed. His hands settled on her waist. “You look lovely.”
Sam nodded. He fished in his pocket and pulled out a card. It was inscribed with only his first name, followed by a Ministry floo address. “Let me know,” he said, and left as abruptly as he’d arrived.
Harry didn’t want to give Draco time to change her mind. Whilst she was in the shower, Harry flooed Ron and Hermione. Hermione answered, kneeling awkwardly in front of the fireplace that currently housed Harry’s head. “Harry!” she cried. “How are you? What happened with Draco?”
“We can transfigure the sofa if you want, though,” Hermione offered. “You’re always welcome, Harry- anytime. Just because we’re having a baby doesn’t mean we’ll ever not have time for you.” She reached across the table to put her hand over Harry’s. “But I really think you need to sit down and have a proper talk with Draco tomorrow, when you’ve had a chance to calm down and think things through.”
“I’m just saying,” Hermione mused, “that I don’t think it’s outwith the realms of possibility that he’s telling the truth.”
He winced as Harry snorted. “So you expect me to believe that you just like wearing women’s underthings?” he asked, the sarcasm dripping from every syllable. “Seriously, Draco?”
“He won’t put the dosage up,” she moaned, tucking her head against Harry’s shoulder. “I ask and ask…”
“They’re your friends,” Draco mumbled in the general direction of her plate. “Why don’t you tell them?”
She put her head down on his lap and stretched her legs across the remainder of the sofa. Her sock-clad feet hung off the end. She was wearing the socks with crups on them. He smiled. His fingers petted at her soft hair. “Alright,” Jack said, his voice low and soft. “Just relax now. Try not to fight me.” He put the tip of his wand to Draco’s temple.
That woke Harry up as effectively as a bucket of ice water. “Draco, love, it’s completely untested,” he said. “You’re not a mouse, or a crup. Who knows what might happen?”
Draco cringed in on himself, waiting for the inevitable explosion. “I want to be a woman. I don’t just want to wear the clothes- I want to actually be a woman.”
“Coffee,” Draco said. Harry closed the bedroom door after him. She took a deep breath before she pushed the blankets back and pulled her knees up. She screwed her eyes closed as she shoved the mirror down between them. She took in another lungful of air and held it as she opened her eyes to see what that part of her looked like now.
That just made Draco blush more. “They suppress male essences,” she said quietly. “And they have female ones in them.”
Harry gave up on breakfast. “Where are the… the things?” he asked, not really sure what to call the underwear.
“Oh, love,” Harry sighed. He shuffled along the bed until he was behind Draco, pulling him back against his chest and kissing his temple. Draco sagged back against him as if all his bones had been vanished. Then the tears came, great wracking sobs that eventually gave way to hiccoughing little cries. Harry pulled Draco into his lap and rocked, shushing with nonsense noises. He kissed Draco’s head again and again, smoothed the wet blonde hair away from Draco’s scarlet face as he sopped up the tears with the edge of a blanket.
Harry went over to kiss her soundly. “Leave it a bit, think about it,” he advised, murmuring the words into her hair before he tucked a strand of it back behind her ear. He was sure that she was just over-excited about Jack bringing the essence potions- when she had time to think straight, she’d realise that she didn’t want to work for Xenophilius.
It took a long time for Harry to work up the courage to ask his next question. It had been bothering him for months- if truth be told, ever since Ron and Hermione had told him that they’d be having a baby. “Do you want kids?”
Jack put his wand to her temple and muttered a spell for sleep. Harry expected her to relax, but she didn’t. “Didn’t it work?” he asked.
Draco broke the seal and read it as Harry cracked two eggs into the pan. “It’s from George Weasley,” she said in surprise. She glared at Harry over the top of the parchment. “What did you say?”
“Since forever,” Draco admitted. “I went to see a healer about it, a few years ago. Just before we, well, got together. To see if I could change. Or if she could make it stop.”
“What?” Harry upset the open bottle of cleaning potion when he started. Draco snatched it up before too much of the potion could escape, using the dishcloth to wipe up the spill.
Harry felt his cheeks heat as he remembered. That had been the first function they’d attended as a couple, and they’d spent a happy half-hour in the storeroom behind the curtains. They could hear the chatter from the ballroom even as Harry had emptied himself into Draco’s delicious arse. He’d stumbled through his speech, half-hard again just thinking of his come still inside Draco. Luckily, he wasn’t known as much of a public speaker anyway, so he didn’t think anyone really noticed the difference
After a while, Jack sat back against the armchair, one ankle resting on the opposite knee. He steepled his fingers in front of his lips and just looked at Draco for so long that she started to squirm. “I’d like to do a mind scan,” he said.
Hermione let out a sigh. “Honestly, Harry, how do you two actually function? We’ll see you at half six. And we’ll bring the food. You always get the spicy stuff, and the baby’s not keen.”
Harry didn’t think he’d sleep, but he was lulled by Draco’s deep, even breaths beside him. When he opened his eyes, sunlight showed around the edges of the curtains, and Draco was nowhere to be seen. Luckily, it wasn’t hard to track him down. Harry followed the smell of coffee and bacon to the kitchen.
He’d become used to the softening of her body over the last few months. The hard planes of the Draco he thought he’d known had slowly melted away into the slight give of the body she wanted to have, her chest rounding slightly and her hips filling. The softer places were more now, though her ribs seemed too protrudent, her spine too knobbly. “It feels like she’s thinner,” he told Jack. “Like, really badly thin.” Like Harry-in-the-cupboard-under-the-stairs thin, but he kept that thought to himself
She pinned him with her gaze for a moment longer. “He’s offering me a job at his shop,” she said. “I didn’t write to him. How does he know I’m looking for a job?”
Draco stared into the swirling, moving depths of the potion Sam had provided, hypnotised. It looked innocuously small, barely bigger than one of her daily essence potions. “It’s what I want.”
Her face had filled out, fleshing over her cheekbones a little, but she still had a knifeblade of a nose. Her jaw was still ‘strong’ rather than ‘delicate’. Her adam’s apple still bobbed in her throat when she swallowed. She met Harry’s eyes in the mirror. “No more boy in a dress,” she said, her voice cracking. She winced and took the potion, gulping it down without hesitation.
“Do your parents know?” Harry asked. He knew that they didn’t know Draco was with him, but did they know that their son should have been a daughter?
Hermione nodded. “Yeah. They’ve changed the sex of a mouse. Well, several mice. And they’re looking for human trials.”
“Just the truth.” Ron paused, his mouth twitching as he thought. “You should talk to Hermione,” he said eventually.
“You’re already transitioning, though,” Harry said. “Why go for something so untested when you’re getting there anyway?”
She gave Harry the Mini Egg mug. Harry had the same mug at home- he and Hermione had made it a running tradition to give each other muggle easter eggs with novelty mugs since they’d left Hogwarts.  She had the Smarties mug; the first one he’d bought her.
! She’d always avoided using that term in her head, forcibly turning her internal monologue to male pronouns, male terms. She’d always been far too afraid that she’d slip up, somehow out herself.
Draco’s mouth opened and closed like she was a fish. Harry moved to wrap an arm around her shoulders. “It’s a big decision, Mr. Lovegood,” he said carefully. “Maybe Draco could get back to you soon?”
“We, er, sort of got rid of the spare bed, mate,” Ron said. “Had to make room for the cot and the other baby stuff.”
Draco gasped like a fish out of water. His heart pounded in his ears. “It’s not like that!” he wheezed. “I never… I would never cheat on you!”
“No, Harry. Sorry. I wish I could tell you otherwise, but no. There’s no potion nor spell that can do what you ask and give someone reproductive organs. If it was, the infertile witches would be queuing ‘round the block for it.”
Draco fiddled with a loose thread on Harry’s sleeve. “Maybe. I thought you thought I was weird for this. You don’t even like me much.”
She had a little moment of fear when Harry pulled out his wand and aimed it at her. Her nerves were jangled from the events of the last twenty-four hours, and anyway, no matter how comfortable you might be with someone, being at immediate wandpoint was scary.
“Oh, I suspect I’ll be discussing it at length with Jane,” Harry said mildly. “But I’m not horrified.” Draco tried not to feel discomforted at that- she should have expected it. Jane was Harry’s counsellor- it might have taken two years after the War for Hermione to cajole him into talking to a professional instead of trying to find solace in a firewhiskey bottle, but now he wouldn’t give up his sessions with her for anything. They’d gone from weekly to fortnightly to monthly in the intervening years, but his therapy afternoon was block-booked in his calendar at work. If there was ever a time Auror Potter was truly off duty, it was when he was in Jane’s cosy office. “Look,” Harry said. “I think you should make another appointment with the healer. I’d like to come with you, if I can. Maybe things have changed in the last few years- maybe there are better potions now.”
A couple of days later, Draco and Harry waited in one of the Ministry meeting rooms on the atrium level. Visitors couldn’t go into the Department of Mysteries, and even with the weight of Harry’s Auror clearance, he suspected that they were nervous about having Draco in the Ministry at all, let alone poking around whatever the Unspeakables did.
“I burnt them.” Draco’s voice was small, each word sounding like a question. His shoulders hunched in on themselves as he studied the table.
“You can do better,” Ron said, flinging himself into the armchair. “You were too clever to be working for that rag anyway. You’ll get a better job.”
“That’s rubbish, mate.” Ron was Harry’s field partner with the Aurors when they were on-duty and best friend in perpetuity. He pushed a new pint towards Harry.
Jack nodded to her chest. “I reckon that looks like a pretty respectable B cup,” he told her with a grin. “Nothing to be sniffed at. You’ve got some eating to do before you don’t look like you’re on the verge of starvation, though.”
“Yes,” Harry said with a glance at Draco. Draco looked calm, so Harry figured she’d known this before. If she was fine with it, he was fine with it, he decided.
“She told them at work,” Harry said. “About going on the essence potions, being a woman. They fired her.”
“Do you want to go out for dinner tonight?” Draco continued merrily, oblivious to Harry’s silence. “It’s that or go shopping, and I just frankly can’t be arsed with shopping and cooking.” He leaned over Harry to kiss the other man’s cheek, then froze. In Harry’s lap was a bundle of black lace and satin.
“Okay, that’s what I thought.” Ron frowned. “Merlin’s balls, that’s bloody mental.” He took another shovelling mouthful of curry, deep in thought as he masticated. “Does that mean you’ve got a cock or a pussy?”
“Then get on with it,” Draco’s gasp drew out into a long moan as Harry cupped his hand over a breast. Clumsily, she reached for her wand to close the curtains, plunging them into murky twilight.
“Do whatever you like,” Hermione said, putting her mug in the sink. “You know your way around the kitchen if you want anything.”
“Good morning to you as well, Draco,” Jack said, smiling in spite of himself. He scratched his beard. “Or evening… I’m so muddled by the damn time zones. Yeah, I’ve got ‘em. Hold your horses.”
, Draco.” Harry didn’t doubt Draco anymore. There was no way anyone would go to these lengths to cover up an infidelity, and if nothing else, Draco’s utter despondence confirmed it. “I wish you could have told me.” He sighed. “I suppose that’s why you don’t like me looking at you?”
Harry traced the lines of Draco’s body with his eyes. Jack was right. Her feet didn’t go anywhere near the end of the bed anymore. She was shorter. He tucked her tangled hair back behind her ear. Her face was rounder, her nose and jaw subtly changed. He ran an appraising hand down her body.
Draco winced at the flatness of Harry’s tone. “Why on earth would I want to sleep with a woman?” he whispered. “I’m not attracted to women.”
Harry was secretly very impressed when Draco agreed to the mind scan. He found it hard enough to talk about what was in his head with Jane, and that was just talking, not showing. It had taken months for him to feel comfortable enough with her to really open up, and here Draco was willing to let someone she’d just met into her head. “I’ll be in the kitchen,” he said, feeling like this probably wasn’t something he should be here for.
Xenophilius finally seemed to get the idea, and after another round of handshakes and raptures of delight at seeing Harry, whirled away in the floo.
“Come and have a cup of tea,” Harry suggested. “Just… get dressed first. I’d rather not have Jack looking at you in all your naked glory.”
The healer Harry found was an American. He arrived by international portkey three days later. “God, Harry, the cost!” Draco hissed as they made the man coffee in their kitchen whilst the healer waited in the living room.
Draco was fast asleep on their sofa when he let himself into the flat. The fire had died to embers, but the streetlamp outside let in enough light for Harry to see the tracks of dried tears down Draco’s cheeks, his closed eyes swollen. His hair was in disarray, tangled around his head instead of pulled back in the neat braid he usually slept in. He was still in his work clothes.
Three hours later, Harry wiped the sponge over Draco’s forehead, dripping cool water in rivulets down her ears and neck. She whined, raising a weak hand to try to bat away the sponge. “How’s she doing?” Jack asked from the bedroom doorway.
Three nights later, Harry woke up to moonlight falling across the bed. The curtains open, spilling the light of the full moon and the streetlamp across the sheets. Draco wasn’t beside him; she was on the floor at the foot of the bed, her knees drawn up to her chest as she leaned her back against the footboard. “Draco?” Harry muttered, sitting up.
Draco had half-finished her tea when she frowned and put a hand to her belly. “Something happening?” Jack asked, eyeing her appraisingly.
She stared at the face staring back at her from the mirror- utterly familiar, and yet, somehow utterly not. It was a bit like looking at a much younger Draco, she thought, but all wrong. Round, pink cheeks, a delicate nose and a narrow pointed chin marked out the highlights of her face, though she could see that she did look too thin. Her mouth was a little fuller, she thought, but her eyes were the same. Her hair was a birds-nest mess. Jack cleared his throat. “If I were you at the moment,” he said, “I’d be wanting to use that mirror to take a quick look at other bits of myself.” He stood. “Private bits.” Clearing his throat again, he gave Harry a pointed look.
“Well, maybe it’s just an act.” Harry knew he sounded sullen. “Maybe it was all an act.” He drained the rest of his pint. “God, I don’t think I could stand the sight of him at the moment. Could I kip at yours tonight?”
She considered the question. “Really odd,” she said. “Everything feels weird.” All her bones felt like they’d been ground down to dust and glued back together again. Every muscle and ligament ached as if she’d run a marathon the day before. Her guts felt tied into beautiful sailor’s knots. She winced a little as she brought her hand up, cupping it against her much-expanded chest.
“No,” Ron said. “Just… about stuff. She always says the Department of Mysteries has the best library there is. If there’s anything about changing your, you know-” Ron blushed and gestured vaguely about his own body- “it’ll be there.”
Harry clutched Draco’s tense body a fraction closer as she whimpered in her sleep. “Well, that’s something.”
“Yeah. If it makes you happy, then yeah. I don’t care what you wear, Draco. If you want to wear a spacesuit, I don’t mind. You can wear whatever you like.”
She didn’t want to disappoint him. He was so sweetly excited about their purchases. “I want to see,” he told her. “Please, don’t be shy. I want to see what you look like in them.” He held out the sky blue underwear set he’d liked so much, his green eyes wide and pleading.
“Here. This one,” Harry said. She turned back towards him to find him holding up a silvery-grey skirt in some sort of silky, flowing fabric. “It matches your eyes,” Harry said, and Draco thought she could detect just a hint of shyness in his voice.
“You’re in too much pain, love,” Harry murmured into her neck. “Let him help. Sam said it would be okay if we needed to.”
“We can buy more,” Harry repeated patiently. “From wherever you got them. It’s Saturday: maybe we could go out into muggle London. No one would know us there, so we can buy what we like.”
She finally put the bacon in her mouth. Only when she’d carefully chewed and swallowed it did she answer. “No. Shop work?” She shuddered. “It’s beneath me.”
“I think you need to entertain the possibility,” Hermione told him. “Like I said before, Draco is quite feminine, as men go. Maybe they really are his. Maybe it’s something he likes.”
Harry rolled his eyes up to glance at the clock on Hermione and Ron’s living room wall. “Half six?” he suggested. “Is Indian okay? I don’t think we actually have any food in.”
She laughed, low and throaty. Her voice was deep, for a woman, Harry thought. Lighter than it had been, but it still sounded like Draco to him. He was pleased. “Just… be gentle?” she asked. “I’m a bit sore.”
Draco shrugged his hunched shoulders. “Thought you wouldn’t like it,” he muttered. “It doesn’t matter. They’re gone now.”
“Thanks,” Harry said, smiling through his distraction. “I’m going to stay up a bit longer if that’s okay?”
“Sure. I don’t see much point in waiting about for you to get used to being called a woman first; your mind’s pretty clear. Now, it’s still not a quick process,” Jack warned. “It’s not an overnight thing. Might be a year or two before you’re happy with what you look like, and there are some things we can’t ever change- you’re always going to be tall- but it’s a start.”
The wizard who entered the nondescript meeting room was short and mousy, nondescript in himself as the room was. A classic Unspeakable, Harry thought. Couldn’t pick him out of a crowd. He nodded to Harry and then to Draco before turning his wand into each corner of the room, flicking shielding and privacy spells into every nook and cranny. Only then did he turn back to them. “Potter. Malfoy. I’m Sam. Granger told you what I’m working on?”
They found Draco at the kitchen table, sheaves of parchment in piles around her as she put together the next edition of the Quibbler. Somehow, in just a few issues, Harry could see a change creeping into the publication. The crumple-horned snorkack sightings had been pushed to the back pages to make way for an exposé on Gringotts being used to facilitate Muggle money laundering. Hermione dropped into a dining chair like a stone. “Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry?” she demanded. “I’ve been in the testing labs all afternoon. I’m parched.”
Harry looked at the blob of ink spreading out over the parchment from Sam’s quill. He’d understood barely one word of that. What did these squiggles have to do with being male or female?
“Say he had come to you and said he wanted to wear women’s clothes- what would you have done?” Hermione pressed.
Draco haunted the flat for a week, sending out letters of enquiry for any company she thought would be likely to hire her. The owl came back empty-clawed from every missive.
“Of course,” Harry said. “But we can adopt. You know that. You don’t need to go through with this just because of children, or some societal expectation.”
Ron scoffed. “‘Course not. But that’s different. He’s Harry. And he’s not gay, strictly speaking. He likes witches too.”
“Sit down and eat something,” Harry said, pointedly looking at Draco’s plate of food, cut up into little pieces, but not actually any less than it had been. “Yes, I’ve met him before. He’s crackers.”
Hermione blew on her hot chocolate, then took a careful sip. “Maybe you should think about it before you talk to him,” she said. “You are going to talk to him?”
“The Potter one wasn’t.” Harry put the milk bottle on the coffee tray. “Let me do this for you, love.”
“No… talk now,” Draco mumbled, his eyes sliding shut again. His head slumped forward. “Just… need to wake up…”
“You should,” Harry said, grabbing Draco and pulling her head down so he could kiss her crown. “I want to. Come on, the healer’s waiting.”
Healer Jack (“Oh, no, first name terms! None of that stuffy ‘Healer Jenkins’ nonsense.”) listened as Draco haltingly explained her predicament. He asked questions, so many questions, and Draco forced herself to answer them even when they seemed irrelevant. How long had she felt like she was a woman? What was her childhood like? How did she feel about the war? Did she have women’s clothes? Did she ever wear them? Just inside the flat, or outside too? What about her name- was that the same name she’d always had?
Hermione swirled her lemonade around in her glass. “Why is it so unbelievable?” she asked. “Draco’s never been, well, the most masculine of men.”
The press of the fabric on the over-sensitised skin was almost too much- just below the edge of pain, but somehow delicious too. She peered down to see that the cups of the bra no longer hung empty, but filled with swollen flesh. Her swollen flesh.
Draco charmed the bag so the name of the shop didn’t show as they wandered Camden Market. They’d always liked it here- Harry had thought it was because they certainly weren’t the only gay couple there, but now he wondered if Draco had liked seeing people who might have been male, but might have been female too. You got all kinds of people in Camden Market.
Sam nodded, making more of an effort to move slowly. He pulled a piece of parchment and a self-inking quill from his pocket and began to sketch. “See,” he said, “the human genetics- the code of life, if you will- is made up of something the muggles call chromosomes. They’re in every cell of your body, for wizards and muggles alike. They’re the blueprint for everything in the human body.” He drew twenty-three squiggles on the page before he tapped his quill on the very last little squiggle. “This one here- that controls if you’re male or female. Males have two different chromosomes here- an X and  Y. Females, they have two Xs. So, we yank out the Y, stick in an X instead, and replicate it all over the body. Congratulations. It’s a girl.”
Harry went through to the kitchen as soon as he got in, shedding his robes on the sofa and his shirt on the kitchen threshold. He’d pulled down the box of healing supplies he kept in the top cupboard before he realised Draco was home and following him. “You’re hurt!” she said, spotting the clumsily applied dressing on his arm.
“What about the other ones?” Draco asked, gesturing to the twenty-two other squiggles. “What do they do?”
Draco stared at Harry, who shamelessly stole one of Draco’s chips. “I’m still waiting for you to panic and run,” she said. “You’re… you’re being too calm.”
“Can somebody explain what the bloody hell’s going on for muggins here?” Ron asked. “Because I think I might know, but I can’t wrap my brain around it.”
Harry’s lips compressed to a tight line. He carefully counted out five breaths before he said “Never mind, love.”
“Why did you never tell me?” Harry asked. He reached out to touch Draco’s damp shoulder. “You never said anything.”
Draco’s hands traced out a shape in the air above her flat stomach, almost unconsciously. Harry recognised it as an approximation of a pregnant woman’s shape. “Hermione getting pregnant?” he guessed.
Harry shook his head. “Just kept thinking,” he said. “God, Hermione, I love him. I thought he loved me. How could he do this to me? Couldn’t he have done me the credit of telling me, not going behind my back?”
Draco trailed him as he went back to the kitchen for more tea. “I’ve never actually spoken to him before,” she said. “I thought it was an act to sell his silly paper.”
Jack spread his hands. “Harry, Draco… you’ve gotta understand. This ain’t that common. There are only six healers in the world who’ll oversee this sort of thing, and we ain’t overrun. Most of them don’t specialise. Hestia Bewick- she’s a gynaecologist, a lady parts doctor. This ain’t her bread and butter. Only me and Healer Ashraf, in Pakistan, specialise completely. We don’t see no other patients except those that want to change their sex, but the other four? It’s just a sideline. There’s not the interest in research for new potions and spells.”
“It’s not right,” Harry muttered. “We have magic, we should be able to do this stuff. If we just tried harder...”
Jack laughed. “No, Draco. Not mad at all. I can see that this ain’t just some passing fancy, too.” He fiddled idly with his wand, drumming it off his knee. “I’ll need to get a few calculations done- I’ll need your weight and height and so forth. I’ll need a blood sample- and I’ll need to see you at least every month to begin with to check that the dosages are right, but I reckon I could have a supply of essence potions with you by next week.”
With quick movements, Harry scooped the bacon out of the pan and into two sandwiches. The plates clattered as he set them on the table; Draco had barely moved. “Sit down,” Harry said, his voice sounding gruff in his own ears.
A week later, Harry and Draco sat nervously in matching chairs in front of the healer’s desk, in her office on the 18th floor of St. Mungo’s.
Her whine reached a crescendo as she shook her head. “No potions. You said no potions! Sam said no potions.”
Harry and Hermione both whacked at his head, each getting an ear. Draco put her head down on her folded arms and howled with laughter.
Hermione smirked a little, just the way she always did when she was right. Ron called it her ‘cat with the cream face’. “I knew it!” she crowed. “I knew he wouldn’t cheat on you!”
She snickered. “I didn’t say he wasn’t, and I don’t doubt you know it very well,” she said. “I’ve seen you two sneaking off before- I can’t believe how brazen you were about it at that ministry ball. You practically missed your speech.”
Her cock spang free of its confines, the little knickers unable to contain it as it too engorged with blood. She canted up her hips to yank them off, the elastic digging uncomfortably into her rapidly growing erection. Her hand brushed against the placket of Harry’s trousers, where his own erection strained against the fabric. “Fuck, Draco,” Harry said hoarsely. “I really, really want to fuck you.”
Pressing down the scream that was building in his chest, he hurled the lot into the fire, then collapsed down onto the hearthrug, the wool tickling his nose as he sobbed like the world was ending.
“Draco’s fine,” Draco said, glancing up at Hermione, and apparently liking what she saw in her face.
The bed transfigured from Ron and Hermione’s sofa was comfortable. It really was. He couldn’t blame a bad mattress or not enough blankets for his sudden insomnia. He got up when he heard someone in the kitchen. Ron’s borrowed pyjamas pooled around his feet as he walked- he hadn’t bothered to transfigure them into his own size.
With a frown, Jack felt her ribs too. He waved his wand in a complicated movement over her body. “I think she doesn’t have enough body fat, so her body’s pulling too much to redistribute,” he said. “At least her bone density still looks okay.”
A niggle in her mind told her that this couldn’t actually be real. At any moment, Harry would announce his disgust and go, her brain told her.
“First off, erectile dysfunction,” Jack said, holding up one finger. “Far be it from me to meddle in your sex life, but warned that it’s not unusual for someone to be unable to maintain an erection after they start with the potions. It’ll look a little different, down below, too. And fertility.” He raised a second finger “It sounds like you guys want kids?”
The floo chimed again a few seconds before Jack stepped through. Draco bounded over to him. “Do you have the potions?” she asked.
She didn’t have the heart to deny him. “Fine,” she teased, rolling her eyes again. “You can wear a skirt the colour of my eyes if you insist.”
She climbed up onto her knees and turned to face him. Kneeling by the bed with the moonlight behind her, catching her platinum hair, she looked like an angel about to say her nightly prayers. “No more potions, Harry,” she said, her voice full of wonder. “No more potions every day for the rest of my life. I could look like I’ve always wanted, feel like I’ve always wanted. I could have babies! Children of our own! Don’t you want that?”
Harry shrugged a shoulder. “That’s okay. But they’d be okay with it too. I’d better go and clean up the breakfast dishes before Hermione declares us both slobs and says we can’t be trusted not to poison ourselves.”
“Oh,” Harry looked disappointed, and Draco loved him for trying. “I’d hoped- you’re supposed to be the best.”
He clasped his arms around her waist as he rested his cheek against her shoulder. “Did you sleep at all?”
As the clock crept closer to six thirty, Draco hummed with nervous energy. She kept leaping up to pace the room, casting her book aside. Even when she was sitting looking at it, she didn’t turn the pages. Her eyes kept skimming over the same paragraph, unable to take in the words. Harry pretended to watch television, but if he’d been asked the plot of the murder mystery, he couldn’t have answered. He kept an eye on Draco as she flinched with every crackle of the fire.
“You sound like you’ve been screaming,” Harry told her from his perch on the end of the bed. “You did scream a bit.” She spared him a sympathetic glance. He was pale, with dark shadows under his eyes. His hair clumped as if it had been soaked in sweat.
“It hasn’t even been three months,” Harry told her. “Jack said it would take at least this long to really start seeing any changes.”
Draco finished off the bandage with a spell to weave the ends together. “I got fired,” she said quietly.
“Yeah,” Draco said softly. She stared into space, her eyes fixed on the wardrobe but her vision somewhere else entirely. “But I can’t have them. There’s no way for me to carry them- I don’t have the right organs.”
She took a long gulp and sighed in contentment. “I’ve been talking to some people at work, and I think I might have something that could help you. It sounds like it might be similar to muggle gene therapy, but Sam- the principal unspeakable on the project- was pretty vague. Everything’s pretty vague within the department.”
“Nothing bad,” he grunted, gingerly beginning to pull the dressing off and trying not to let the sticking charm take half of his arm hair with it. “Had a bit of a skirmish with some moonsugar dealers. Curse damage though, so it’s a bit slow to heal.”
Distantly, he heard Harry calling his name, then the door slamming, the force shaking the ornaments on the mantelpiece and sending the snitch that lived there rolling off its pedestal and over the hearthrug. It nudged against Draco’s foot and came to rest. He opened his eyes, the firelight splintering wildly through the mist of his tears.
Harry took the potion bottle from Draco so he could grip her hands. “They fired you because you’re changing your sex?”
Harry kicked her under the table. “Draco’s a bit nervous,” he explained. “She’s got something she wants to say, but she’s scared you might not be supportive.”
Harry tried to eat some of his bacon sandwich. The bread felt like cotton-wool in his mouth, the bacon like greasy string. He gulped a mouthful of coffee to try to wash it down; he burnt his tongue. “Fuck,” he swore.
Draco hardly ate. She shuffled with nervous energy, glancing at the clock every few seconds. She leapt up when the floo chimed with an incoming visitor, knocking the table and upsetting Harry’s (thankfully empty) Crunchie-themed mug. Harry, too, spared a glance for the clock. Jack wasn’t meant to be here for another half an hour. He followed Draco into the living room at a more sedate pace.
“Are you sure you’re okay with the physical changes too?” Jack was frowning. He’d reluctantly given the course of treatment his grudging blessing, but he insisted on staying, if only because he was determined that a trained healer should be present. “Periods, for a start, and all the mess and problems that might come along with them? Contraception? Childbirth, if you choose it?”
“Vaguely,” Harry said. He knew better than to tell an unspeakable that you knew what they were up to. It made them twitchy. Well, twitchier. “You think you can change someone’s sex.”
Draco grumbled incoherently. “I think we should let her sleep a little longer,” Jack whispered. “She should wake naturally without the spell keeping her under. You should go and have your breakfast.”
She was jolted out of her reverie when Harry tugged on her hand. “What do you think?” he asked, and she realised he’d pulled her over to a stall. He was holding out a gaudy pink and turquoise peasant skirt.
“I think we’ve got a pretty good idea already, Draco,” Hermione said kindly. “It’s okay. You can tell us.” She paused, looking thoughtful. “Can I still call you Draco?” she asked. “Would you prefer a different name?”
“I tried to tell her once,” Draco said. “I was little- maybe twelve? Pansy had just had her first monthly. God, I was jealous. She got to have the pretty clothes, then she got to be this amazing fertile being. She could make life. All I made was trouble.”
Draco put her hand on Harry’s arm. “No, Harry,” she said. “Stop. This… this is fine. It’s better than what I’d have had from Bewick. The world isn’t ready for the ‘Harry Potter charitable fund for transsexual research’.”
Sure enough, blood was staining the field dressing, the healing spell he’d used unable to knit the wound. “You’re supposed to have healers for this sort of thing,” Draco admonished, taking over the removal. “This looks like Weasly just slapped it on in the heat of the moment.”
“We can adopt,” Harry said, kissing Draco’s hairline and being rewarded by her tipping her head up so she could see him. “I always thought I might like to adopt a kid or two. Give them a good childhood. Better than I had.”
“Next week?” Draco squeaked, unable to contain her excitement. Harry felt a broad grin plaster across his own face. He squeezed Draco’s hand tight. She’d have what she wanted.
“What should I call you?” Harry repeated. “Do you have a girl’s name you’d prefer? And shall I use ‘she’ and ‘her’ instead of ‘he’ and ‘him’? I don’t know how to do any of this, love. You’re going to have to help me.”
Harry flushed. He should have, he realised. He should have read up more on this. He probably should have asked Hermione for help finding information- he hadn’t the first clue where he would have looked. He shook his head.
Draco couldn’t move; couldn’t speak. He gripped the back of the chair to keep from falling as his heartbeat pounded in his ears.
Harry drew patterns in the condensation that had gathered on the scarred pub table. “I gave him the chance. He could have come clean- maybe if he’d just come clean, we could work on it. But not this rubbish about liking women’s underwear.”
“So, do your bits turn inside out, or what?” Harry asked. He pretended to be very interested in his fried egg. “Sorry, that sounded a bit crass. I’ve just never even thought about this stuff before.”
Draco sat on the edge of the bed, his back to Harry. His long blond hair was still wet, plastered against his back. “It’s… it’s not just the clothes,” he said, his voice very small. “I mean… I did wear those, a couple of times. But I hated how I looked in them.”
“Do you want to see?” she asked, her fingers fretting at the knot in the dressing gown’s tie. He knocked her shaking hands aside to disentangle it, but did not pull the fabric apart. That was for her to do, he decided.
Xenophilus cocked his head, looking at Draco as if she were quite possibly a crumple-horned snorkack in disguise. Suddenly, his head whipped around so he could catch Harry firmly in his cross-eyed gaze. “Well, Harry Potter.” If he’d looked at Draco like she was a museum exhibit, he looked at Harry like he was the last person one would expect to find in Harry Potter’s living room. He stepped forward, clutching towards Harry’s hand. “Oh, how marvellous,” he said. “My Luna will be pleased that I have seen you.”
Draco nodded sharply, her cheeks stained pink. Harry spoke for her. “Yeah,” he said. “I think that’s a good idea.” Maybe they could figure something out. He hadn’t thought of a surrogate. Maybe they could have one kid with Draco’s sperm, and one with his. Maybe there was some way to mix them up, magically.
“Have you tested it?” Harry asked. “I know you lot. You make stuff that you don’t understand and leave it lying around.” He could almost feel the creepy aura of the veil even being near this unspeakable. He shuddered.
“I know,” Harry said, taking a seat beside Draco. He’d long ago given up asking Hermione how work was going. She could never answer. “What does this have to do with me?”
Draco tucked her hand into the crook of Harry’s arm as they wandered the stalls. She didn’t try to hide her grin. She thought that this was possibly the happiest she’d been in years-
“Not the ones where we only messed with chromosome 23,” Sam said. “The other ones… well.” He spread his fingers, his meaning clear.
The mind scan took only a couple of minutes. “All done,” Jack said quietly as he took his wand away. “You just sit up when you’re feeling up to it.”
“Seems that way,” Sam replied. “As if you’d been born a girl. You’d look like one, sound like one, even bleed like one. Got some puppies out of the crups three months back. Seem like normal puppies.”
A shrug rippled through Draco’s shoulders. “I didn’t want to think about my body. Didn’t want to see it. Didn’t want you to see it. ”
Draco supposed she’d have to be. It was Harry all over. “I suppose so,” she said. She rolled up her sleeve. “Didn’t you say you needed blood?”
“I know,” Harry told her. He curled protectively around her, a parenthesis around her body. His sponge left a damp patch on the sheets.
Draco’s tone was mocking as she answered.“‘This is a traditional newspaper with traditional values, Mr Malfoy,’" she parroted in a parody of the head clerk at the
“And he just expects me to believe that he likes wearing women’s underwear!” Harry complained, staring into the dregs of his pint. “Like that’s more likely than him having a witch in our bed!”
Draco flushed a delicate pink, making Harry smile. He reached across the table to brush her cheek. “I love it when you blush,” he said, his voice slightly hoarse.
Xenophilius nodded serenely as if to unheard music as he gazed out of their windows. “Lovely view,” he informed them. “But tell me- do you ever get Wyrgrizzels in those trees?”
Peeling back the covers, Draco climbed in next to Harry. “I just want it to be quicker,” she admitted. “Some days I think loads has changed, but some days, I just feel like a boy in a dress.”
Harry hissed as the air hit the angry red slash on his forearm. “He did. No point bothering the healers. They can’t do anything. Not the first time I’ve had a cursed would, love. It’s not even that big. It’ll be gone in a day or two.” He used his uninjured hand to gather up the cleansing potion, uncorking it with his teeth and slopping it over his arm. The potion hissed and bubbled, burning away germs and impurities.
Harry wheeled to face Draco, taking her by the shoulders. “She shouldn’t have called you Mr,” Harry told her. “That’s not right.”
“They aren’t paying attention,” Harry said. “We’re just that couple that comes in every few weeks. We’re not interesting any more.”
Draco tried to shake his head, but Harry’s grip was too strong. Tears were threatening at the edges of his eyes again. “No,” he whispered. “I’d never… I only want…”
She hummed in agreement. She hoped he’d be up for using the engorgement charms again in the future. She’d liked it.
Draco had never been able to hide blushes. It was one of the things Harry loved, and, he realised now, that he’d missed the most. In the dark, he couldn’t see the crimson spread across Draco’s cheeks when Harry hissed dirty words into his ear. Now, though, Draco wrenched his face away from Harry’s hand, turning his cheek to try to hide his flushed face. “I wore them a couple of times.”
“It won’t last long,” he said by way of apology. His fingertips danced lightly over her chest, then, carefully, he dipped one below the edge of the cup to graze against her nipple. She groaned low in her throat, and then Harry’s hands had reached behind her, undoing the clasp of the bra and letting it fall to the ground. “As pretty as that is, I will always prefer you naked,” he told her. Pressing her back until her knees hit the edge of the bed, he tumbled her onto it, branching himself on his arms above her. His dark head dipped, his tongue laving gently over her engorged nipple. It sent a clenching need straight into her belly even as she hissed through her teeth.
Three hours later, Draco sat up in bed, propped up by a mountain of pillows. “How do you feel?” Jack asked.
Silence stretched on for long moments. Draco wondered if Harry was waiting for him to say more, but somehow, he couldn’t bring himself to. He waited for Harry to tell him to pack his things and go. Harry struggled to get his thoughts in order. Eventually, he asked, “Since when?”
He returned the bed to a sofa, leaving the blankets, pillows and pyjamas folded on the end. He pulled a sheet of notepaper off the pad by the phone and scrawled a note to leave on top.
But then, there were other considerations. Over the last year or so, Draco hadn’t wanted to make love with the lights on. Harry had given up trying. Shower sex hadn’t happened in a good while, even though they’d done it almost every day when they first moved in together. Harry had thought that maybe it was just them getting over the new relationship honeymoon phase. Maybe it was something else. Oh God, just how long had Draco been sleeping with someone else before Harry had noticed? Or was there something changed in Draco himself?
“About the potions,” Harry clarified with a vague wave of his fork at Draco. “About, I don’t know, growing girl parts or whatever they do. What do they do?”
Harry frowned. “Of course I do. I love you. I want you to be happy, and you’re hardly going to be happy if I’m calling you something you’re not.”
“Perfectly normal,” he assured Draco. “Look, this is a lot to take in. If you give me the nod, I’ll get started on those potions. If you change your mind, you can floo me. You can always floo me if you want to talk about anything. I’ll come back with your first supply in a week. If you still want to go ahead, we’ll start there. I’ll check up on you in a week, check the dosages. If you’re steady on that dosage in a couple of weeks, we’ll push the checkups back to monthly. If you decide you don’t want to carry on- I don’t think you will, but if you do- you can come off the potions. No harm done.”
An hour later still, Draco sobbed in pain, curled into a tight ball, her knees pulled to her chest. “It hurts!” she wailed.
Ron glared at Draco. “What I like or think doesn’t matter. I have no problem with you. I don’t get it, but you make Harry happy, and that’s enough for me. What you do with your body is your business. Can’t see why anyone would want to be a woman, but you were always bloody weird anyway.”
Draco’s movements were uncoordinated and sleepy as she pressed herself back up to a sitting position. She slumped bonelessly against Harry’s side. “So?” she asked. “Am I mad?”
Sam hitched his shoulders. “Boys are girls now. Girls are boys. Seem happy enough. Can’t talk to them to ask. Haven’t been able to crack the talking to animals yet.”
Harry kissed Draco’s head again. “They know it’s important,” he said. “Besides, Hermione would kill him if he was nasty, and she’s mean when she gets riled up right now.” He glanced at Jack. “Hermione’s pregnant. It’s made her short tempered. Not that she’ll believe it.”
The healer’s mouth tightened like she was sucking on lemons. “Unlikely. In any case, that’s a conversation for a long time in the future. If Mr Malfoy can manage to live as a woman- and that’s an if, not a when- we can discuss the next steps.”
They went out for lunch. Draco had used the last of the bread for their abandoned breakfast, and neither of them wanted to countenance cold bacon sandwiches. So, hand in hand, they ventured out into muggle London. Draco had had to use glamors to hide her puffy eyes, but she smiled broadly as they wandered down the road to a favourite cafe.
Ron bounced up from his desk as Hermione waddled into the Auror’s office. “‘Mione! he gasped. Questions tumbled from his lips. “Is everything okay? Why are you here? Do we need to go to St. Mungo’s? Is it time? You should have sent someone to fetch me! Here, let me get a chair…”
“No, I’ll be fine,” she muttered distractedly, reading George’s letter again. “Go to work. He said he wanted to talk to me alone anyway.”
Healer Bewick looked at him over the edge of her spectacles, reminding Harry strongly of Madam Pince. “This is not a process to be taken lightly, Mr. Potter. Some of the changes wrought by these potions are irreversible. It must be taken slowly, to give enough time to allow the patient enough time to change his or her mind before things become permanent. After a while on the potions- anywhere from six months to two or three years, depending- then we can talk about more permanent changes like breast augmentation and changing the appearance of genitals.”
“I think so,” Sam said. “If we tested this on you, you’d need to let us keep an eye on you. See what the effects are, see what the effects on fertility might be. Should warn you though, the process looks like it could be pretty painful. All the test subjects survived, but they didn’t look too happy about it at the time.”
He dug into his meal with gusto, piling his plate high. A few mouthfuls in, he glanced around the table. “What’s wrong with you?” he asked his dinner companions. “Are none of you going to eat?”
Harry picked up a glass from the draining board, filled it, and handed it over. “What’s going on, Hermione?” he asked.
Sam held out his hands, showing he was unarmed. “Sorry,” Harry murmured, putting his wand on the table in front of him. “Professional reflex.” Even if Sam didn’t know him, or of him, he was wearing his Auror robes.
“Hey!” Harry scrambled to his feet, pulling her into his chest. Her skin was cool and smooth against him. “Stop that! You’re not broken. And Ron won’t be nasty.”
“I think it’s a lovely name,” Harry said. “You can be called whatever you like. But you do want to be ‘she’, not ‘he’?”
Harry shrugged. Over the last couple of hours, he’d run over imagined scenario after imagined scenario. Maybe he’d go home to find Draco in their bed with the witch. Maybe it would be better just to go back, gather up his stuff and leave...
Sam squinted at his inky messes as if they were a foreign alphabet. “Everything,” he said. “We’re trying to pin down magic. Haven’t been able to yet. Seems to thread through almost everything. Except that last pair. X and Y- they’re the same, no matter what we do. Muggles and wizards have just the same X and Y.”
Draco tried again, a little louder. “It’s mine.” He swallowed hard. His head was swimming, making him dizzy. Reaching behind him, he grasped blindly for the chair and used it to support himself. He closed his eyes to try to shut out the swaying world around him. “I bought them. For me.”
Draco jumped, his hand setting the frying pan rattling across the hob. “Careful!” Harry admonished, already rushing forwards to turn off the gas before Draco could burn himself or set fire to his sleeve. Draco stared at him, his expression wary as if he was waiting for Harry to vanish at any moment. Vanish, or possibly attack him. “So,” Harry said. “We should talk.”
Draco made quick eye contact with Potter, who looked away quickly. Draco grimaced as he realized he was most likely here to witness the fate of his arch-rival from school, to finally see him get his comeuppance.
“They didn’t have anywhere else to go.” Harry felt the need to defend himself, for some reason. He had made some bad decisions before, but he knew this wasn’t one of them. Malfoy was his soulmate, he had shown remorse, he was someone Harry knew could be trusted. “I have so much room in Grimmauld, it was nothing, really.”
“I truly, wholly, and completely saw no options other than to follow orders. The one time I had an out - Dumbledore offered it to me in his last moments - I was too late. I was ready to surrender, to end the suffering, but the rest of the Death Eaters were already there. I had no way of getting out of the situation. Snape had followed through with his promise to Dumbledore and killed him,” Draco was crying now, he didn’t think of that moment often. He regretted not turning his wand over sooner. He regretted not going and speaking to Dumbledore. He regretted so
“Mr. Boy Who Lived!” Harry exclaimed, laughing again. Malfoy’s face was alight with laughter, a way Harry hadn’t seen it in years.
Draco was overtaken with a sense of overwhelming deja vu. He had been in the Wizengamot before, but the set up was exactly like his dream from the night before. Kingsley Shacklebolt stared down at the three of them from the center of the benches, and was surrounded by the same faces from the dream. The exact same faces, in the exact same seats.
“Potter.” Draco started. His mind drifted to the dream from the night before. Now that he knew Potter had actually testified at his trial, it seemed even more possible that it was a soulmate dream. But he still couldn’t bring himself to believe that he would be bonded to Potter.
Harry sighed, rubbing a hand over his face. “Maybe? I don’t know what would be good for us Hermione. There’s barely an us right now to be discussed.”
The cuffs binding his wrists together disappeared. He stood up and reached for Narcissa. They embraced, his arms around her waist. He buried his face in her shoulder, tears streaming down his cheeks. The feeling of relief filled him from his toes to the tip of his head, his chest heaving in sobs. He would never have to return to Azkaban.
. Next to it laid Harry’s wand and the Hawthorne one he had been holding onto since the end of the war. Suddenly he remembered the events of the day prior.
“So who is it, then?” Hermione said, as soon as the two of them sat down. Harry jolted, looking up from where he was fiddling with his napkin.
“No need to thank me. You both saved my life,” Potter responded, returning his hand to his pocket. “I actually - er. I was hoping to have a word with Malfoy, uhm- Draco.” He looked past Narcissa, and made eye contact with Draco. He smiled slightly.
Shacklebolt took in the number of hands and clarified, “We will do this in order of ranking, those highest will speak first. Speaking out of turn will have you ejected from this proceeding, as I do not want this court to get out of hand. First, my own question. I only have one. What do you mean he surrendered a moment too late?”
He felt a sudden urge to cry, a lump catching in his throat as he sat down at a random chair towards the end of the table, away from his food and Narcissa. He stared at the letter, looking up only when he heard the chair across from him pulled away from the table. Malfoy sat down. His eyes only glanced at Harry quickly before returning his attention to the letter. Harry watched as he ran the pad of his fingertips over the wax seal.
It was the closest Malfoy had come to admitting he did want to come back, and wasn’t just doing it because he felt he had to. Although, maybe his definition of good news was different from Harry’s.
What he wasn’t taught about the effect of dementors was the thoughts they put in his head of hurting himself. It was no wonder most people died in Azkaban, they probably killed themselves, egged on by the swarming dementors the amplification of any negative thoughts. Draco had considered trying to remove the mark before being locked up, but since then there were days where it was all he would think about.
“Huh?” He looked up at Harry. Malfoy was so absorbed in the letter he seemed to have forgotten he existed.
Potter gave him the biggest smile yet, and Draco hesitantly smiled back. Potter looked back towards his mother, who Draco had forgotten was standing there. Her eyes were wide in shock, but also seemed to understand that this was what made the most sense for their family now. She nodded slightly at Draco.
“I can, actually,” Narcissa spoke up first. Draco whipped his head to look at her, and her face was colder than he’d ever seen it. “I can’t believe you have the audacity to come here and act as if you have any right to be treated better than any other criminal. You made the choices that led us here. You gave up your family for a cause that lost. You gave up our
Harry nodded. He turned away a little, smirking right back at him. “Well, I’m sure the letters will come at dinnertime. So we’ll see then.”
The days in Azkaban dragged on, going slower than even his sixth year did. He could barely track day or night, the cloud coverage making what was meant to be the daytime just as dark as the night. Every morning he woke up to the sounds of other prisoners sobbing and screaming in agony. They were soon joined by his own, as the dementors tormented him. Day in and day out.
“That depends fully on how the rest of our trial went. So, unfortunately, your guess is as good as mine. My greatest hope is that your age will give you a reduced sentence,” She nodded to herself, and Draco gulped. If even his mother thought he would be doing time in Azkaban, then hope truly was meek.
“I still can’t believe you spoke in his favor. If you just weren’t going to testify at all I might understand but-”
The thought crossed Draco’s mind, suddenly, that this could be a soulmate dream. The fact that it was Potter’s birthday, and the strange perspective of the dream. It would make sense, except that it was impossible. If he even has a soulmate, there was no way it would be Potter. Fate couldn’t be so cruel. Draco Malfoy, bonded for life to a man who would hate him forever.
They waved a last goodbye, and Granger and Weasley went to one floo while Potter went to a separate one.
“Now, today we will hear the final witnesses in the cases of Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco Malfoy. These testimonies will be given by the accused themselves. Following their testimony, the court will decide their punishments.” Shacklebolt explained. “We will begin with Lucius Malfoy. You may approach the podium.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Always the fucking martyr. You had every right to assume that was true. I didn’t give any indication it wasn’t, until I said so. Anyway. What's the situation going to be with other Slytherins returning?” He sat back down on the bed, this time gesturing for Harry to join him.
Despite this, and despite the feelings of dread that the dementors amplified, he knew he couldn’t give up. He spent the little time he had a clear mind during the day thinking of what he would say during his defense. He ran his fingers up and down his ribcage, counting the bones, trying to keep the dangerous thoughts at bay, and thought of how to sum up his experiences in a sympathetic manner.
“Maybe I am. But so are you. You always raised me to be just like you, father. If I’m a disgrace, what does that make you?” Lucius stared at him, unable to say anything before a guard stepped up to them, eyes wide in some form of shock.
Potter’s birthday. What a strange detail to add to a dream, As if Harry Potter would have to spend his birthday in court, testifying for Draco Malfoy.
“The way you got it from me. That worked, didn’t it? No magic involved. So try to keep it away from me. I’ll fight you for it.” Malfoy explained. He kept eyeing his wand, not even glancing at Harry’s face or other hand. He slipped his hand containing the Hawthorne wand behind his back. Malfoy was forced to make eye contact with him.
He was going to die alone, here, shivering on the concrete floor barely staying alive. Nourishment spells only did so much. His mouth was dry for lack of water, and his ribs were visible through his shirt. He counted them each day in an effort to keep sane. If he looked at his ribs he wouldn’t think so much about tearing off his left forearm.
Harry’s mouth dropped open, “Clear? If anything you’ve purposefully kept your answer incredibly cryptic just because you like to fuck with me!” He took in Malfoy’s new gait, his arms crossed and smirking. “Like you’re doing now.” Harry chuckled a little and Malfoy’s grin spread. “Fuck me.”
“Yes. The reason we are here right now. Perhaps she told you that all furniture was poisonous, and that’s why you’ve chosen to deliver the news from the floor.” Malfoy teased him, and now it was Harry who was trying to cover his smile. He laughed a little, running his hand through his hair awkwardly. All this, just because Malfoy didn’t have a shirt on. He needed to get a grip, and fast.
“Great!” She smiled brightly at him, patting his hand. “Oh- I almost forgot the entire reason I wanted to have lunch.”
“Ah, Harry! Good evening.” Narcissa said, smiling more pleasantly at him than she had since the night they moved in. Malfoy himself was pointedly silent, staring at Harry. Harry adjusted his collar self-consciously, hoping he wasn’t as obvious as he felt.
His skin was dark. His hands were jarring to look at, so different from the near translucency his skin had reached in prison.
Harry decided it wasn’t something to fight about, at least not right now, so he dropped it, still smiling at Malfoy. Malfoy was looking back down at the letter in his hand, trying to hide a smile.
Malfoy rolled his eyes again, but fought down a sly smirk. Harry ate his breakfast with a small smile. Maybe he was being too obvious again, but Malfoy seemed placated by it this time. Progress.
“It’s no problem.” He still hadn’t moved, propping himself up on his palms on the bed. Malfoy looked at him quickly, and licked his lips before biting down on one, eyes at the floor.
“It’s fine. I won’t say anything to him. This is your business,” she said, reaching over and placing a hand over his. “But for the record, I think he will be as accepting as I was.”
Maybe Harry had just looked at him too openly. He was never good at hiding his feelings, truly Gryffindor in the way he wore his heart on his sleeve. He probably had been far too fond, looking up at Malfoy. It was the only thing he could think of that would make Malfoy leave like that, like he was mad.
. Draco nodded quickly, turning back to his father. Lucius was as shocked as he was, maybe more so. His mouth hung open like a fish, and he floundered for something to say. Draco schooled his jaw, “She’s right. You were wrong, father. You have to admit that, or you will die in Azkaban. You might die there anyway.”
There was no way the court would agree, Shacklebolt was simply being optimistic, giving him false hope-
Rubbing his hand over his face one more time, he stood up and made his way to the bathroom. He brushed his teeth and washed his face, going back to his room to get dressed. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.
He sat down next to Malfoy, his feet still planted on the ground, so Malfoy was a little behind him on the bed. “We aren’t sure.”
The guard waved his wand, detaching their cuffs from the bench, and then relinking them to an invisible rope extending from his belt. Arms awkwardly in front of them, the Malfoy’s walked into the courtroom.
On his mind, though, were a few other issues. All of them surrounding who he was going to tell about the situation. So far, he hadn’t told anyone that Malfoy was his soulmate, so no one knew they were living together. He wasn’t sure how to broach the topic with anybody. He knew he had to tell them (Hermione and Ron were only going to believe he “wasn’t feeling up to going out” for so long) but he was terrified of their reactions.
“The court will now vote on the verdict of Lucius Malfoy. All in favor of life in Azkaban without parole?” Shacklebolt said, and every hand in the court shot up. Draco’s heart sank. He never wanted to see his father again, but he couldn’t help the pang of sympathy and pain from knowing his father would stay in that horrid place forever.  He wanted to
Hermione chuckled a little. “Even if he isn’t, do you really think McGonagall wouldn’t listen to you?”
He realized if he had just turned 18, that meant it had been a month since the Battle of Hogwarts. A month since he was arrested. A month since he had arrived here. As he stared down at his wrist, thinking of plan after plan to remove the damned thing, he jolted as he realized he was already losing touch with reality. He needed a happy thought. He started counting his ribs. He thought of his mother, tried to conjure any positive memory. He came up with a small one, from when he was a boy, of his mother kissing his forehead goodnight.
to never see him again, not be forced into it because his father was losing his mind in the worst place on earth.
who was cooking breakfast, and he would avoid having another discussion with his house-elf about how he prefers to cook for himself or not at all in the mornings.
Potter stripped down to his pants, preparing for bed. (Which Draco did not try and take note of. He just...saw it by accident. His chiseled chest, the scar over his heart. His large- no. He didn’t notice that at all.) He finished what was left in his glass, stumbling slightly as he got to his bed.
Theodore Nott had been sentenced to Azkaban, Harry knew, so he wouldn’t be there. He apparently had been even more directly involved in the Death Eater operations than Malfoy, doing most of the torture at Hogwarts. Goyle, Zabini, and Parkinson, however, were all free or on probation.
The dementors could see all the way into the deepest and darkest parts of his brain, the fears he had never even acknowledged with the war going on. They taunted him with his guilt, day after day reminding him of the horrific things he’d bore witness to, the things he’d done.
Harry shook his head, laughing a little, and Malfoy started laughing too, and then they were both laughing - at this table in Grimmauld Place, the entire situation so absurd there was nothing to do except laugh.
“I thought we established you aren’t entitled to that.” Now Harry rolled his eyes, not letting the goading get to him. He did feel his cheeks heat slightly, though.
“Oh yeah, the things we have in common. Being forced into a war too young. Trauma from that war. Feeling responsible for the tragedy of war-”
Harry frowned at the sudden seriousness, but smiled when he remembered the letter in his hand. “I was right though.”
He looked at Malfoy then, making eye contact with him for the first time since entering the room. Malfoy looked surprisingly serious but nodded at him. “That’s good, I guess.”
Draco had never heard the story told in such plain language. His wand fell, he was only seeking protection for his family. It was all true, and of course knew it was true, and that was the only explanation for why this was happening. His own subconscious had put these words into Potter’s mouth. No other person would believe this story.
, lighting Harry’s face. He looked down then, and for the first time seemed to notice the position they were in. His eyes widened, and he climbed down quickly. Harry thought he could see a flush rising up his neck, but he cast
Harry rolled his eyes slightly, noting how she wouldn’t admit that she missed him as well. He smiled at her. “Okay, that’s fair. I’ll come out to pub night this week.”
“I don’t think you did anything wrong. He’s the one who forced you into the fight,” she noted, “I think you should try talking to him again. Try and figure out what you have in common.”
His mother pulled back first, gripping his shoulders. She looked in his eyes and wiped the tears from under them. He sniffed in a breath, before releasing it shakily. “I can’t believe it,” he whispered.
When Harry finished reading his letter, he looked up at Malfoy. He was already flipping through the rest of the welcome letter. He mouthed along as he read through quickly, he almost looked excited.
She smirked as Harry’s heart stuttered in his chest. He could return to Hogwarts in two weeks, if he choose to. He wouldn’t have to go right into the Aurors. He could have a somewhat normal school year. “Oh my god.” He was aghast. Hermione took his hand again.
“In favor?” Shacklebolt repeated Draco’s own thoughts, and murmurs traveled through the gathering of witches and wizards.
“It’s not ideal, but I don’t want to overwhelm him. I think I might’ve already done that.” Harry confessed. “I like him much more than I expected, Hermione.”
“Happy Birthday, Harry. I know we aren’t celebrating until next week but we got you something for today anyway, open it at home.” Weasley said, handing Potter a small wrapped gift. Potter smiled slightly.
Harry himself ran his fingers over the edge of the letter, realizing it would be the last one he ever saw until he had his own children. It was surreal, staring at the red wax seal. After all of the trials of the last year, the absolute hell he had gone to, after
Harry took the opportunity to talk. “You look like shit.” Fuck, maybe he needed to work on breaking out of old habits before he attempted this. “I mean, you look tired.”
Too many times he’d caught himself staring at Malfoy, and he had always just attributed it to his suspicious nature. All of sixth year made more sense too - he knew something was up with Malfoy, and technically he was right. But it was only because of how much he already knew about Malfoy’s habits that he noticed in the first place. He lost interest in
“I understand that, and I agree, it’s not the best time. But I will tell you that - at the least - you need to come out with us more. He misses you something terrible, but he’s not too keen to admit it.”
Somebody sat next to him. He looked up to see his mother, in the same position as him, in the same grey Azkaban uniform. Their eyes met, and Draco immediately felt a longing he didn’t know was there, to be held by his mother, to have her tell him everything was going to be okay.
Malfoy nodded, and seemed to mull over the idea. He stared down into his lap, rubbing his mark again. “Have you told everyone about us?”
” he whispered. The writing on the bottle shimmered, before it went dark again. Potter closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep.
“How are you?” Harry responded as he sat down, Kreacher immediately placing a plate in front of him. Harry began levitating the food to his plate.
? “-I propose a year of probation, with any infraction an automatic sentence of five years of house arrest and five years probation. All in favor?”
“It’s Malfoy.” He finally blurted, causing Hermione to cough into her coffee, dripping it on the table. He winced. “Sorry, could’ve warned you.”
Hermione’s eyes widened, her eyebrows shot up. She seemed more taken aback by this news than by the fact that Malfoy is his soulmate. “That’s nice of you.”
Malfoy shut the door behind him, and Harry stood there awkwardly. The guest room he had given to Malfoy didn’t quite look lived in, the comforter on the bed was rumpled but that was the only sign of life. Every other part of the room - the desk, the wardrobe, even the nightstand - appeared to be untouched. It was exactly as Harry had set it up the morning before inviting Malfoy to live with him. It felt impersonal, like Malfoy had no plans to stay there long term.
Not to mention all those weird thoughts about his hair and eyes gleaming in the sun, or noticing how thin he got sixth year, or noticing his height (Yesterday was the first time Harry was taller than him. It was a little strange. A little nice.), or the times he had to stop his eyes from lingering on his arse.
“First order of business. The court has agreed that due to the fact that your entire family was involved in this war, reparations must be paid. Malfoy Manor will be seized. In addition, you will have to pay out your vaults until you are left with a maximum of 5,000 galleons or every single victim from the war has received their fair due. Every family involved is paying as such,” Shacklebolt announced. Draco swallowed tightly. He knew in his heart that the manor would most likely be seized, but 5,000 galleons? That was so little. His entire way of life, everything he had known, would shift. If he stayed out of Azkaban, that is.
“Wake up, let’s go!” The guard was yelling, rattling the door frame. “It’s your trial. Get up now.” She gestured for Draco to approach the bars at the front of the cell. He stood up on shaky legs. “Give me your hands.” He put his hands through the bars, and she spelled his wrists together. Then she pushed them back through the bars and unlocked the door.
He finally settled on a green sweater Luna had bought him - the color apparently “brought out his eyes" - tucked into a pair of black jeans. It was certainly more fancy than he usually wore to dinner. He would be shocked if Malfoy didn’t notice, but he hoped it was casual enough that he might not tease him too much.
Potter went straight for the Wizengamot, sitting beside Granger and the Weasel, behind the head of the court, Kingsley Shacklebolt.
What a strange twist of fate, that Harry would be bonded to someone he had once so despised. If three years ago, someone had told Harry that his soulmate was Malfoy, he would’ve laughed harder than he ever had. Even the remote concept that he would ever look at Malfoy romantically was laughable. So much had changed in three years, though.
The dream was confusing Draco now. If it was simply to give him false hope about his trial, a nightmare to look back on as he spent his time in prison, why on earth would he have to sit through Granger lecturing about the prison system?
When Hermione asked him for lunch for the third day in a row, Harry knew he had no choice but to say yes. At breakfast, he informed Kreacher that he wouldn’t be joining them for lunch. Malfoy overheard, and scoffed.
Draco felt his eyes water as she spoke, honored that his mother would indict herself in his defense. When she sat back down, she stopped for a moment to lean down and kiss his forehead. A tear slid down his cheek, and he sniffed a breath in, swallowing around the lump that had formed in his throat.
The door swung open. Malfoy was standing there, pajama bottoms slung low on his waist, no shirt on, arms crossed over his chest. Harry’s breath was gone too quickly for his own liking. His eyes drifted down Malfoy’s chest, ghosting over the faint scars there, down to the line of his joggers.
They stood there, looking at each other, Malfoy still gripping his wrist, his eyes sincere. Harry looked down, nodding a little. “Sorry.”
“No, the other Draco Malfoy,” Potter said, rolling his eyes with a smile. Draco had to bite down a smile. Potter’s sarcastic nature hadn’t been broken by the war, apparently. He seemed to think Draco was mad though, as he added, “Sorry, sorry. That was rude. Yes, you. I assume you also know what this is about?”
After eating, Potter moved back to his couch, grabbing a book off of a side table and reading, his glass of whiskey present again, refilling four or five more times. The hours passed quickly, the moon rising in the sky. Potter stood up and stretched, and looked at the small bottle on the table.
, c’mon get it right,” Harry corrected, laughing despite himself. Malfoy snorted quietly, trying to cover it up. They made eye contact with each other for the first time since starting the laughing fit, and it died down. Harry was sure he was blushing. Malfoy just looked so shockingly pretty when he was happy. His face flush from laughter. Harry took a deep breath, willing his blush to go away. “I, er. I did want to give you something.”
Draco felt like he was on a roller coaster. He had woken up that morning in Azkaban, and now was being offered a space to live with his soulmate, who just happened to be fucking
He ran over his plans, day after day, his fingers running over his chest, and days turned into weeks, until suddenly he had spent two months on the floor of his cell, and his verdict would be given tomorrow.
The smirk was gone, Malfoy’s face had closed off again. He rubbed over his Dark Mark, which Harry had barely noticed until now. It was faded now, pink scar tissue instead of a deep black mark. Malfoy scratched at it. “And why would it matter to me if you returned to Hogwarts? Unless you’ll be kicking us out while you’re there, in which case-”
Potter entered the pit in front of the overwhelming presence of the entire Wizengamot. He approached the podium, an automatic
Potter, his father had filled him with ideas that Potter would be the next Dark Lord. Only a truly dark force could have defeated Voldemort as a baby, Lucius claimed. And then there were the school years - every waking moment Draco was considering new ways to get under his skin, bother his friends, get his attention.
“I assume that’s a yes? She’s sending out the official invitations today. Ron and I were already planning to go.”
Potter braced himself on the podium. He took a deep, ragged breath in. He seemed tired, but pushed through for the sake of the trial. He looked at his hands again, and Draco took in the tense way his forearms bulged, the sleeves of his robes rolled back. He could feel the tension sitting in his lower back, unsure of how he had missed it before.
Of course, this wasn’t true. His soulmate could just be younger than him, and they would share a dream the night of his soulmate’s 18th birthday. But dementor’s didn’t care about logistics. And in Azkaban - cold, alone, and afraid - neither did Draco.
Malfoy sighed and opened the door. “Yes, well, come in I suppose.” He stepped back into the room, and gestured like a doorman. Harry chuckled a little, which made Malfoy’s serious cadence crack just slightly.
His hand was suddenly free, Malfoy letting go to take the wand in both of his hands, admiring it. He was still sitting astride Harry’s lap, but Harry wouldn’t dare interrupt him to say something about it. The way he looked at the wand, the way his face lit up, Harry was in awe. Laying there, underneath Malfoy for the first time, and seeing his reaction to something so important, it solidified everything for Harry. He was ready to make this work if Malfoy was, even if it was certainly going to be a lot of work.
Harry pulled at his hair, groaning, and leaned against the wall next to Malfoy’s door. Okay. He could do this. He could have an adult conversation with his soulmate about their future. He just has to knock.
Then simultaneously, “Three,” and they both tore open their letters. Harry pulled out the thick stack of papers, and began reading.
“Just checking, Potter. We might be soulmates but I’m not going to jump into bed with you right away.”
He smiled slightly at the guard. She glared back at him. He dropped his eyes to his feet. She wrapped her arm through his, and side alonged them to the guest entrance of the ministry.
“I mean, sure, but just because you have this weird obsession with him doesn’t mean he doesn’t deserve Azkaban.”
over going through with the orders he had. “I considered death almost every day. But I knew once I was dead, my family would suffer even more for my betrayal.” His voice cracked, throat closing around a sob. He blinked back tears forming in his eyes.
“I’m. Bad at this. I’m sorry, I don’t know how to be nice to you,” Harry tried to explain. Malfoy just sighed, rolling his eyes. He crossed his arms over his chest and stared at Harry. “I know that sounds crazy. But it’s just a big adjustment. I’ve hated you because I was told to hate you, and now I’m realizing how much I didn’t actually hate you. But my brain still behaves that way.”
“Call me Narcissa, please,” she walked over, offering her hand. Potter shook it. Draco stood awkwardly, unsure what to do. “We can not thank you enough for testifying in our favor.”
“Harry, I’ve made breakfast. Come down and join us,” Narcissa said from outside, and then her footsteps left. He didn’t seem to have a choice. He quickly pulled on some sweatpants and a tank top, and tried to make his hair somewhat presentable.
Harry considered this. He hadn’t really thought much about what to talk to Malfoy about, just that he wanted to talk to him. He wanted to laugh with him again. The way that Malfoy looked with a genuine smile on his face, Harry wanted that back. Maybe Quidditch was the right answer.
Malfoy grabbed his wrist before he could get to the door. “It’s not. I won’t say I haven’t thought about it, but I just. I thought you would assume the worst.”
Draco turned around to see Potter standing there, hands in his pockets. He looked distinctly more disheveled than Draco had ever seen him. His hair was it’s normal mess, but there were dark circles under his eyes and his gaze seemed hollow. He wasn’t wearing robes, just a ratty T-shirt and baggy jeans. He bit his lip and looked at the floor.
Harry thought this over. He hadn’t really considered what Malfoy’s life would be like outside of Grimmauld Place. Obviously, he knew it wouldn’t be a breeze, but he had known Malfoy wasn’t evil for a while now, he often forgot not everyone agreed with him.
“Anyway. She told me that McGonagall is inviting anyone who didn’t get a chance to finish their time at Hogwarts back this year. I want to go back, but I wanted to talk to you about it before the invitations came today.”
Potter. He was dreaming from Potter’s eyes, just going about his day. Why? What purpose could this dream serve, the day before his fate was revealed? Why would his subconscious want to show him a mundane day in the life of the Saviour?
“We assume they’ll be invited back if you are, but we don’t know if they’ll come back. Most of them are in France or something.”
“That’s settled then. One year of probation,” Shacklebolt banged his gavel twice, “Court dismissed.”
The one year Draco’s life didn’t revolve around Potter- when he was focused more on the Vanishing Cabinet and his impossible task of killing Dumbledore - Potter was following him around, tracking him. Ended up slashing him to bits.
He placed the bottle on his bedside and stared at it. He placed his glasses next to it. He grabbed his wand, cast a quick
Harry ventured down and sat across from both of them, serving himself some eggs and pumpkin juice. Narcissa and Draco were already eating, and the table was quiet.
Before he could finish putting his wand down, Malfoy was on him. He jumped on his back, and Harry screamed. Malfoy reached an arm around him and reached for the wand. Harry switched the hand he was holding it in, and then threw Malfoy off of his back onto the bed.
In favor?! Draco couldn’t believe it even as the words escaped his own lips. This wasn’t a nightmare or a dream, it was a tease, a horrible vision of what could be. What he wished was the truth of his situation. It was a hope he hadn’t even dared to entertain.
Potter took a deep breath, and Draco tried to think of how Potter could know that. He hadn’t realized he was there on the astronomy tower, Draco thought he was alone. His last moment to change sides was something he thought over often, and he never remembered seeing Potter. This dream was inventing impossible circumstances to show him a totally different life.
Draco realized that he was watching his own court proceedings. That for some reason, in this horrible dream world, Potter was observing his own trial, and he would have to watch the witness testimonies against him.
The dream was strange. He woke up in the morning, in a house vaguely familiar to him but he couldn’t place it. He went through the daily motions, but never once looked in a mirror. His eyes avoided them like the plague, head bent over the sink to brush his teeth, and turned away completely as he got dressed.
close to surrendering to Dumbledore. He regretted taking the mark every day when he saw it again. He even considered offering his forearm as reparations, but he thought that might come across as far too drastic.
She smiled sadly at him, “Hello, my dear. Are you ready for today?” Her voice was meek, almost unrecognizable.
“Until I’m comfortable? Don’t you assume I’d want to scream it from the rooftops? My reputation could use the boost.” Malfoy asked him, scoffing. Harry was taken aback. He hadn’t considered that as a reason Malfoy would want to tell everyone about them. Quite angry that he would consider using him like that, Harry stood to leave.
“Thanks, Hermione. I’ll do that.” They both walked towards the floo. Hermione grabbed a handful of the powder and stepped into the fireplace.
“I know that. I would do it even if you weren’t my soulmate. You deserve the same chance as us to finish schooling, if you want to.”
Harry nodded, spinning his spoon in his near empty coffee mug. “Yea, that would make sense. I don’t see why they’d have a problem,” he began to get excited, he and Malfoy could
go back. He would rather die than end up there, wallowing away for the rest of his life. Just those two months would require so much healing.
He ate breakfast. Small, hot oatmeal, but food. He could taste it more than any other dream before. The pumpkin juice seemed to actually soothe his dry throat.
“I never thought I’d see another one of these.” Malfoy said, mostly to himself. Harry’s eyebrows raised at the vulnerable statement, but when he went to comment he was met with an icy Malfoy glare. So he let him have his moment.
“I don’t know for sure that you’ll be invited, but considering the outcome of your trial I can’t imagine you wouldn’t be, and even if you aren’t I can send an owl to McGonagall-”
“Seriously, Malfoy! You have to disarm me.” Harry went and grabbed his wand, holding it out for him to take.
was always too weak, or the countless times he had been on the receiving end of that curse. Draco watched an imaginary trial where the court slowly seemed to actually understand his circumstances.
Nights in Azkaban didn’t usually include dreams. If his sleep was deep enough to have imagery, it was typically a nightmare. A full night’s sleep was rare - but Draco managed to get lucky the night before his trial.
Lucius seemed to have finally understood the fight was lost. He hung his head, scowling at the floor. A guard came behind him and dragged him out.
“Count of three?” Harry offered, slipping his finger under the lip of his envelope so he was ready to open it. Malfoy did the same and nodded.
He looked in worse shape than he had in sixth year. The bags under his eyes from lack of sleep, the thin lines of his cheekbones, even his hair looked duller than its usual platinum shine.
Malfoy’s eyes rolled and he huffed, exasperated. “I thought I’d made it abundantly clear that if I was invited I would be attending.”
Lucius approached the podium. His defense was very thin, claiming he was under the imperius curse again. Draco watched as the court shook their heads, not buying the story.
“Can I help you?” His eyes snapped back up, meeting Malfoy’s harsh gaze. “You’ve been pacing out here for ages as if I couldn’t hear you.”
“Draco, Narcissa, can you believe the audacity they have to shove me around? As if I don’t know the proceedings of this court. I served on it for decades,” Lucius huffed, turning to his family for sympathy.
Malfoy’s face turned serious, his back straightened. His body language closed off immediately. “And what would that be?”
“No, that was just an added bonus.” She winked at him. “I have news from McGonagall. She’s inviting anybody who didn’t have a chance to finish their schooling to return to Hogwarts on the first.”
Back then, he’d thought his soulmate would be a dashing man that would come and save him from his family. Somewhat like his own white knight. He wanted a tall strong man to fall in love with him and take him from his brutish father, like the fairy tales he had heard the muggleborns at school discussing. Someone named Cinderelly, or something like that, who was saved by her very own Prince Charming. Draco had always wanted that. He imagined his prince would be French, and all of his french lessons from when he was younger would finally pay off.
Hermione’s face fell slightly, and she pulled the side of her lip between her teeth. “I’m not sure. If the Wizengamot allows it, I can’t imagine he wouldn’t be.”
Harry grabbed the wand, wanting the awkwardness to disappear as fast as it had come. Fuck Malfoy for bringing up sex so soon. Fuck himself for making it more serious than it needed to be. “I just wanted to return this.” He held out the wand.
Harry gave the owl a small piece of meat from the shepherd's pie, and sent it on its way. When he turned back to grab his letter, Malfoy had already picked up his own. He was just standing next to the table, staring at it in his hands. Harry reached for his own, standing opposite him.
“Quite good. Waiting on the post.” Malfoy finally spoke up, as he took a bite of the shepherd's pie. He looked directly at Harry, his mouth turning up so slightly Harry almost didn’t catch it.
Harry ate his eggs slowly, trying to catch Malfoy’s eye again, but he didn’t look up throughout the entire meal. Narcissa continuously glared at both of them, and Harry eventually resorted to also staring at his food, scared of her watchful eye. He wasn’t sure why she was mad at him too, but he didn’t want to be on the receiving end of that glare again.
At the end of the court proceedings, Shacklebolt dismissed Potter and the rest of the court. Potter went back and met with Granger and Weasley, who were waiting for him at the door back into the ministry.
He sat that day, staring at it. He wished for any way to perform magic; if it meant he could sever his arm. Leave the ugly thing behind. He would miss his fingers, sure, but he would never miss that mark. He was going to die alone because of it, he was going to wither away on the floor of a derelict cell in a stone prison because of it.
“I guess. I guess it makes some sort of sense, doesn’t it?” Draco offered, shrugging. Potter smiled.
He had always known he was gay, a few experiences with Pansy in third year confirmed that for him if he’d had any doubts. And he wouldn’t lie and say he had never noticed that Potter was attractive. Objectively, he’s just Draco’s type. Tall, dark, and handsome. A powerful wizard. A little rough around the edges. But when you’re drafted into opposite sides of a war - thoughts of romance kind of go out the window. He hadn’t given much thought to his soulmate since he was fifteen.
Draco stared at his mother, jaw slack in shock. She had never so much as disagreed with Lucius in front of him, let alone do...
“I will never be Minister for Magic. The only thing more corrupt than Wizarding Prison is Wizarding Government.”
When lunch rolled around, Harry was fidgeting with his shirt for a while in the mirror, trying to figure out how to broach the topic with Hermione. He would have to come right out and say it, or else she would be jumping in with advice that doesn’t apply. He’d have to be quick.
“France is ‘nothing special,’ are you serious? I mean- wait. Are you planning to come then? If they will?”
No. This was just another cruel trick. He had truly lost his mind, the dementors had affected his psyche too much. His subconscious was torturing him in tandem with the actual torture.
Surprise! I'm back! Now, the chapter after this one still isn't done, so we aren't going back to our original posting schedule, but I thought it'd been long enough and I wanted to give y'all a bit of a gift. Hope you enjoy!
“The Chosen Boy,” Malfoy added through giggles, then rolled his eyes. He seemed to be enjoying the moment but also slightly bewildered.
Malfoy chuckled, “Yea, I suppose Pansy and Blaise would’ve left as soon as possible. But if they’re invited, I bet they’d come back.”
Arriving back at home, Potter sighed and dropped onto his couch, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes. He took the gift out of his pocket and opened it.
Malfoy’s eyebrows raised at him in shock, his mouth falling open a little. “Why are you sitting on the floor? You look like an idiot.” He bit his lip, poorly trying to hide a smile. His chest shook with a laugh.
Malfoy flushed, and sucked in his cheeks. His eyes glanced down at Harry’s hand before quickly meeting his eyes again. “Let’s see if I get an invitation.” he said again, slowly, each consonant a sharp sound. It was Harry’s turn to flush. Malfoy smirked at him, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Who’s your soulmate? I assume that’s why you disappeared directly after your 18th birthday?” She gave him a pointed look, and he realized how stupid he’d been to underestimate her. Of course she already knew his reasoning, she’s Hermione. He shook his head and let out a breath, running his hand through his hair. The barista delivered their drinks, giving him a few extra seconds to gather himself.
“Fine. You can fight me for it. But if I win, you have to take my wand and disarm me, okay?” Harry agreed. He placed his wand back on the nightstand.
Okay so, we have officially caught up to where I am in writing this fic. I have two more chapters written but not edited, so there will likely be a chapter next week but I make no promises as of right now. My beta has been going through some shit so that's why they haven't been edited yet, so it kind of depends on whether or not they get around to reading over what I have written in the next week. I will try to post a new chapter on the Friday after it's done, to keep up at least a little with the posting schedule I have made. So sorry for the wait but I want this fic to be as good as possible! I hope you all understand!
Narcissa’s kind face turned hard again at the mention of the post. Malfoy obviously told her about the invitations. He was still smirking at him though, and that made Harry feel better about Narcissa’s apprehension.
The dream continued in kind, members of the court asking Potter questions upon questions about what he witnessed Draco do. There were things that were just impossible for him to know, like his cowardice in front of Voldemort, the way his
Hey guys! Just a heads up, we're starting to catch up to what I have finished already. If we do catch up, there may start to be a delay in chapters because I want this story to be the best it can possibly be, which means taking my time on it. Hopefully I'll be able to keep up and there won't be a delay, but I wanted to put this disclaimer here now rather than it be a shock a few chapters from now. Thanks for all your support!
Harry woke up in his own bed, in his own house, to the smell of bacon wafting up from the kitchen. Kreacher must have started on breakfast without his permission. He sighed, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. He reached for his glasses on his nightstand and saw the bottle, now filled with shimmering gold glitter, that read
“Draco Malfoy, you can now approach the bench for your defense,” Shacklebolt stated, slamming the gavel down again to bring order to the whispering court. Draco stood up, trying to appear as strong as his mother did. He took a deep breath, trying to regain his composure.
Harry definitely looked like an idiot, jaw slack, trying to gather his thoughts. There was a reason for him being here, but it escaped him now. All he could think about was his surprising desire to kiss every scar on Malfoy’s chest, right up to his lips.
“What do you mean a buzzing needle??” He asked, concerned. “Why would muggles make a buzzing needle to put pictures on themselves?”
He was still staring at the note when Pansy joined him. “What-“ She asked, looking over his shoulder before stopping in her tracks. “He made things?” She asked, hesitantly.
“No, Potter. Technically I am in my city. And you are invading it with your unwanted presence.” He said, pulling Pansy into the café without another word.
Every time Draco had come around, he had tried to gloat him into an argument but it was like nothing bothered him. And that was what was starting to piss him off.
"Keep your bright eyes looking up to the sky now. Chin up, be proud. Walk strong like a soldier onto the Battleground. Breathe in, breathe out. Don't give up, Don't quiver, You're enough.
“Excuse me,” She glared at him, a towel twisted up onto her head. “ You are going to eat something that you don’t know what is in it?” She asked, watching him as he popped it into the microwave,  pressing the buttons indicated in the note.
"Ah yes, the Great Harry Potter in Slytherin colors. I think the Gryffindors would have a stroke." Draco muttered sarcastically. Harry looked over at him, taking in everything as the other stood there, slightly self conscience. "Is there something on my face?" Draco asked after a bit.
Harry nodded, standing up and pulling the other into a tight hug. "You will have me and Pansy by your side."
Pansy laughed, “What, not liking how they depicted you as this helpless damsel in distress that needed strong heroic Potter to save you and break you of your evil ways, and the sordid love affair you two have been having?” She giggled, leaning against the chair. “I subscribed to the Prophet just because of those articles. I like to read them in the morning, so much more versatile then harlequin romances.”
He stared at the glasses laying so innocently next to his book. They didn’t look out of place, but quite the opposite… Like they belong there..
“Pansy? Dear? Where is Draco?” Came the voice of Narcissa Malfoy. Pansy jerked awake as the door knob jiggled. She turned, kicking Ginny off the other side of the bed next to the wall. The redhead fell in a pile of blankets with a huff, moving to say something when the door opened.
"How was your nap?" Harry asked him, pulling his uniform and robes from his trunk and pulling his shirt off.
“Don’t you dare cut it.” Pansy snapped, standing in the doorway. He froze, placing the scissors down. “Why? Why shouldn’t I cut it?” He asked her, looking at her in mirror.
I hope everyone liked this chapter. I worked really hard on it as it had a lot of elements to it. a lot of the tags come into play with this new chapter. I think the next chapter will either be right before harry's bday or harry's bday and then time skip another few weeks.
Hermione turned to Pansy, raising an eyebrow. “Looks like someone doesn’t it?” The dark haired woman purred with a smirk.
“I don’t know what happened, exactly. He just stopped being Draco. Right after your party.” She told him straight out, a frown on her face as she stared at him.
Stephanie disappeared behind a curtain and Pansy sat down next to him. “Don’t freak out but there will be a buzzing needle.” She told him.
“So I want to talk about your birthday.” Hermione smiled as she received her food. “I don’t want to do anything.” He groaned.
“ENOUGH!” He yelled, hitting the table with enough force to make it wobble on its legs. Pansy jumped a bit, looking at him. She stared at him before looking away. “You should go talk to Andy at least.”
“I’m going to go home…” He whispered after a long silence, getting up from his spot. He threw his cup in the trash before grabbing his shoes. He slipped them on, grabbing his wallet and phone from the table and walking out.
“What you did, it’s all over the papers. It’s all everyone can talk about. It’s blown up completely.” She told him.
He had called Chris soon after, hanging out with him a bit when they went out. He was a part of a muggle band and had invited both him and Pansy to watch the show a few times. After a week, Draco had even let the muggle boy talk him into getting multiple piercings along his ear lobes and one in his eyebrow. The next time he had seen the other, after Pansy’s makeover, the man had looked like he was going to faint.
He stayed on his side of the large bed, staring up at the ceiling for a while before turning to watch the other sleep. He didn’t remember when he closed his eyes, but it wasn’t long after that he felt a heavy weight on his chest. He opened his eyes, peering down at him with a small smile as the other cuddled into him, still sound asleep. He hesitantly wrapped an arm around him, pulling him close. Just like that evening, his anxiety was instantly zapped from him. He closed his eyes, slowly drifting off to one of the better nights of sleep he had had in a very long time.
Sitting in his empty kitchen, the silence around him deafening as he tried to swallow his meal. He finally gave up, grabbing a glass from the cupboard and opening one of the bottles he had bought. He poured almost a full glass of the strong dark liquid. The smell was a little rancid, burning his nostrils as he closed the bottle back up. He bit his lip before he took a big gulp. He gagged, coughing as the liquid burned his throat all the way down. “Bloody fuck what is this??” He yelled, looking over the label again before taking another gulp hoping it would be better than the first. It wasn’t, but the burn didn’t feel as bad. Actually his thoughts had become meddled and everything that had been suffocating him not even a few seconds ago seem to have just simply vanished. Like an switch had been flicked off.
He let out a sigh. She had an opportunity to get out of this mess, and he wasn’t going to let her be dragged down by him. She hadn’t even talked to any of their other friends. She hadn’t used magic since the Battle. All because of him.
Ron sighed, wiping at his face. "Fine. I just, I don't understand why everyone is so cozy with Slytherins now." He frowned.
“Sorry… She’s been in shambles ever since... you know… “ He said with his own sigh. “Hermione reckons she’s become over protective as a coping mechanism.”
“Yeah… He hasn’t yelled at us like that in a while..” James nodded, scratching the back of his neck. “Is that stuff he said true.. about you and him?” He asked.
When they got home, Harry disappeared into his room and never came back out. Draco didn't attempt to go after him.
It wasn’t long before green flames erupted from his fireplace in the kitchen. Harry sighed, turning but the person emerging was not who he expected.
Harry moved, pulling himself out of the pool. He leaned down, offering the blond his hand. “Come on.” Draco raised an eyebrow, reaching out with his left hand without thinking. The skin in the middle of his tattoo was red and puckered as if irritated from a cut or some kind of injury. Harry’s eyes flickered to it a second before Draco smirked, taking Harry’s hand and yanking him back into the water. He pulled himself up out of the pool, wringing the water out of his tank before heading back inside.
“What in the name of Salazar are you wearing?” Lucius hissed, staring at his son. Draco was still wearing Harry’s shirt and a pair of ripped skinny jeans. “Muggle clothes.” Draco replied, his head held high and the mask back in place.
He was pulled from his thoughts when Andromeda came back with a blue haired baby boy on her hip. She sat him down in his swing, letting the contraption lull the other to sleep. Draco took a long sip from his cup, watching her as she sat down in the chair to his right. “Are you alright?” She asked, worried.
“Why wouldn’t you let him in? You know what he did during the war! You know how he saved our lives, my life. How he helped me defeat Voldemort! He had no choice during the war! Like I did! He lied to numerous Death Eaters, to his own family. Went against everything he knew to just end the war. He did everything he could to keep his family safe during the war!” He yelled.
Harry frowned at that, trying to think of a solution. “I will handle this.” He told her, moving  out of the booth. Pansy nodded. “He’s at his house, but his parents are there.” She warned. Harry nodded.
He remembered the marks on the blond’s arm, vividly, and it worried him. But Malfoy wouldn’t try to kill himself, would he? He wasn’t like him, he was better. He wasn’t like him…
Harry came back a few minutes later with microwave dinners and tea. He sat the tray down before turning the telly on low. He settled on a horror movie before he settled down next to Draco. He ate as the other ranted about the movie, taking the mickey out of the muggle movie and its portrayal of magic.
Harry chuckled breaking some more eggs in the frying pan. “American muggle show about a teenage vampire slayer named Buffy.”
“No, it’s fine. He’s asleep right now.” Harry ran his fingers through the other’s hair lightly as he talked.
“We aren’t off probation.” He said, turning to him. “Father, don’t you understand at all? We are here because people died. People died and it’s our fault.” He said, turning to him. “People died. I almost died,  my friends died. Why do think no one comes to visit?” He asked him, his mother covering her mouth in shock. “Pansy got disowned by her parents just because she refused to leave my side.” He said, feeling tears running down his cheek.
“You wanted to tell me the other day didn’t you?” He asked her. Ginny sighed. “I did want to tell you.”
"You won't have magic until we get to Hogwarts, and you are still on probation until October." Harry reminded him. Draco nodded. "You have my wand, right?" He asked, a little worried.
He might not understand his feelings for the other, but he wasn't going to let anyone cross him when it came to the blond. He might not be able to say Draco was his, but in his mind he had already claimed the other. Merlin help the poor sod that tried to fuck with what was his.
She turned to face him. “What do you want to do?” She asked him. Harry took a moment, standing there thinking about it. “I don’t know what I want..” He finally said softly.
Harry clutched his left fist as Chris held down his arm as he pressed in the color and the final touches. "You know... He doesn't like me like that." Chris told him as he worked.
“You said that he fixed your stove and made you breakfast, so I just assumed that you were close.” She said, faking ignorance on the subject.
“What are you playing at?” Draco asked Pansy as the other sipped her tea. “Not playing at anything.” She said through closed lips. “Potter is looking at me again.” He hissed, staring straight at her. Pansy smirked. “Just like old times.” She muttered.
Pansy let go out Draco, biting her lip to keep from laughing with the other. Draco stood up straight, brushing himself off before whacking her with the spoon again. “Stir the sauce.” He demanded.
Pansy shrugged. “I’m not sure. He’s probation is over in two months, I don’t see why they wouldn’t let him.”
Harry sighed, looking over the packed platform. He met worried and pitiful eyes and he immediately dropped his graze. Maybe he was the one that wasn’t ready for this. He had been so worried about Draco that he hadn't even given a thought to his own self and how he would feel about being back, back in Hogwarts. Back with people.
“He-“ She started out but paused, trying to figure out how to word it. “He wasn’t there, his body was there but it was like he didn’t register what was going on. He was empty. He was void of anything that made him who he was.” She explained.
Draco frowned, knitting his eyebrows together before his mouth turned into a wide O. Harry chuckled again, placing the rest of textbooks and  other things inside before closing the lid and locking it. "Are you ready?" Harry asked him, looking up from the trunk.
“Are you insane? My parents are home.” He yelled, staring at him unbelievingly. Harry grinned, throwing himself over the railing and settling down in front of him in the small space. He gave him a smile. Draco rolled his eyes.
“Yes, it’s actually very bloody funny. Cissy owled me last week and begged me to teach her how to make “muggle fire.”” She said, using air quotes and making Harry laugh even harder. “Muggle fire??” He wheezed in between laughs shaking his head. “Okay, this is enough for me. I am fine with this. I wished I could have seen his face when they told him.” Harry said after he had calmed down a bit then went on to finish his tea. He felt better than he had felt in a long while.
Draco gave her a slight smile as he slowly moved back into his seat. “Is… Potter coming over here?” He asked hesitantly.
Harry blinked. “My head hurts…” He whispered, tears spilling down his cheeks, his breathing coming in panicked bursts. Draco sat there for a moment before sighing. “Harry, it’s just a headache…” He said softly, moving his fingers up to message his temples.
“I went to Potter’s.” He admitted, sitting down on bed next to her. “You look confused.” She said, settling down next to him.
WaffleswithSpain's marauders videos are literally my headcanon marauders. Especially "We are the Marauders". So check it out if you are curious about how they look in the pictures from the box.
Ron walked over to his side, biting his lip. “I read your message… Hermione is busy with the birthday planning. Apparently the place that she was going to have it at canceled on her.”
Two days later when he was cleaning out the kitchen of the garage apartment, he walked through the sitting room and accidently knocked one of the boxes over. He gave a heavy sigh moving to clean it up. He froze, staring at the yellowing muggle journals that had spilled out. The same lined paper that was used on the notes that had been tucked into Sirius’s box.
“I… I’ve been reading Remus’s journals. It’s been helping me through a lot of things actually.” He admitted. “It makes me cry sometimes..”
Hermione laughed at the expression on his face. “Seamus and Dean are going to be there. They just came back from Ireland. Needed to get away. Luna also said that she will be able to come. I haven’t been able to get in touch with Neville though.” She nodded. “I have a place to have your party but if you aren’t up to see anyone, we can really not do it.” She assured him.
“Malfoy?” Harry asked, standing up slowly. “What are you doing here?” Though that was not the question he wanted to ask the other.
fit looking legs underneath a motorbike. The legs were clad in dirty acid washed denim and a pair of old trainers. He cleared his throat. “Hello?”
Draco sat on the bed, staring around him for the longest time. He didn’t know what to do with himself. He had never been on his own before. What was he supposed to do? He didn’t even know where to start… He closed his eyes tightly, trying to quell the rising panic and the strong urge to run back to his mother. His eyes snapped back open at the sound of a knock on the doorframe.
“The muggle food thing, that produces fire and you cook on it.” He told him with a huff, as if Harry was a complete idiot.
“I’m sorry, mate..” Sirius said to James before the other could even open his mouth. “I just thought.. maybe if you let it go, you wouldn’t be so miserable.. I miss happy Prongsy-poo.” He said softly.
Also I am seriously dating myself with this fic. I have to remember what all I did in the late 90's. I was completely obsessed with Buffy the Vampire Slayer when I was in middle school and high school. I used to watch it when it came on in the mornings before I went to school. I still am obsessed and to get in the head space, I completely marathon the series again.
He got Zach to help him return the part before he went back to pick out the part that Malfoy probably needed if his stove wasn’t working. He left the store after paying for the purchase, standing there biting his lip. He knew that Malfoy lived in Camden, but he didn’t really know where exactly.
“Missed you too. Things have been weird lately.” He told him as Ginny entered the kitchen. She gave him a peck on the cheek before grabbing a mug.
“To see the band that played on your birthday, Go get ready.” She ushered. Harry looked at her for a moment. “I don’t want to go to a crowded concert hall.”
“Oh… that’s good.” Ron smiled and bumped his shoulder lightly with his own. “Don’t worry about me, Mate. I’ll always be alright.” He told him.
Seamus smiled. “Bloody right shock, I was in.” He said with a shake of his head. “Went weak at the knees and nearly fell over, bastard.” He said fondly. “It was the best snog of my life.” He concluded.
“How-“ Harry started to ask but was cut off. “You have the same look you did before you left last year.  And after last night, you really do need to get out.” He paused a bit. “I know I do… I’m spending the summer with Charlie…” He said with a slight smile. “Ron and Ginny here are going to look after the shop for me. You can too if you want.”
“How did you get my address?” He asked, biting his lip as Harry’s shirt rode up a bit, showing off a scar. Pansy pulled out her mobile and started to text Granger, a smirk on her face.
Harry looked him over uncertain before looking back at Hermione and Ron. Hermione went to  say something but the compartment door slid open and Luna floated in. There seemed to be a line of people peeping and waiting outside the compartment and whispers poured in.
“Harry… it’s fine…” He said with a sort of half smile. “Actually Hermione said you might do it.” He chuckled. Harry gave him a weak smile. “Really now?”
“I got a letter today.” She told them quietly. “I’m assuming all of you got one too.” She said, looking over everyone. There was a collective yes from the group. “Draco didn’t.” She told them.
“It’s really none of your business, to be honest.” Harry told him. “You don’t have to come over, you don’t even have to look at him. But he will be living in my house for the short time before we go back to Hogwarts.”
It didn’t take much to know what the red head was talking about. “Maybe.. I just want to be unnoticeable for a bit.”
Harry walked up towards the blond’s house, looking it over from the corner. He swallowed over the lump in his throat before noticing him sitting crotched in the corner of the balcony. He smiled softly, moving up to stand a little bit from the door.
“I’m moving in.” She said sternly. Before Draco could object the microwave went off and he switched out the containers.  “But seriously, are you going to eat it?” She asked again, poking the container.
“You don’t think it would be too much?” She asked him, turning around. She was dressed in a black tulle dress that was almost completely silver with the waterfall of sequins.
Hermione pushed the sleeves of her shirt before reaching into her bag. Pansy caught a glimpse of  the scar on her arm, barely making out the word ‘
“It’s the only breakfast we have.” He whispered to her, watching the container go around on the turn table.
Draco spotted Pansy, lounging in a chair, wearing a tiny black bikini, large black sun hat and large designer shades. She was laughing at something… Ginny had said. The redhead was in a pair of swim shorts and a halter top. Across from them were Dean Thomas… and Seamus Finnigan . They were both in board shorts and drinking a beer each. Dean had an arm around Seamus’s shoulders possessively pulling him close. Talking with Longbottom next to Ginny was Luna Lovegood. She had a blue sparkling one piece on with an indian print wrap tied around her waist.
"I was pushed to pick something. I just picked what sounded cool. I wanted to do it at the time, but now, I just want peace." He told him. "The only ministry job I would take would be the one that Hermione is thinking of joining. The department of International Magical Cooperation."
“Back in my sixth year at Hogwarts, he didn’t know it, but he saved my life by appearing in the tower. If he hadn’t shown, I wouldn’t have hidden, nor would have Snape appeared. I would have surely been captured by Death Eaters that night and tortured by Voldemort. A month before the Battle of Hogwarts, me, Hermione and Ron were captured by Bellatrix and a bunch of other death eaters.” He paused, taking a deep breath as he clenched his fists together to still their shaking.
“And the way he looks now…” Seamus trailed off, shaking his head. “Oh, I think everyone knows how you feel about the way he looks.” Dean teased, making the other turn red a bit. “Shut it.”
She shook her head. “Not that I know of. His birthday is in, I think a day or so,  so he’s spending some time with friends. He invited me and Teddy, but I don’t know about going.” She chuckled.
“Everything.. Everything scares me… “ He chuckled, his throat tightening. “Everyone is so excited and celebrating and I’m… I’m not happy.. I don’t like the idea of going back.. Going back and seeing it… I see it enough in my head…. And in my dreams.. I don’t need to see it in real life..” He choked out, blinking the wetness from his eyes.
"Makes two of us." He chuckled dryly, pulling the covers down. "I was just reading." He said, motioning to the pillow. Draco nodded. "I'll just go."
Harry stopped what he was doing, taking his face in his hands. “You are not a bad person. Just a person that had bad things and bad choices put upon them. You did what you had to do. The world isn’t black and white.” He told him, looking at the last piercing, unsure of where it went.
After two hours in Kingsley’s office and another hour quarrel with the Head of the Wizengamot, Harry was finally granted the letter and sent off to talk with McGonagall. If and only if she agreed with the arrangement to let Draco back to Hogwarts, Harry would then be given custody of Draco’s wand. He was not allowed to give it to the blond until they were back at Hogwarts and the blond was to be kept under the terms of his probation until September 1
He stared at the other for a very long moment before setting his mug down. “How do you do it?” He asked him, sitting up straight.
“When we were in the room of requirement, he saved my life again by going against his friends who had been trying to kill me.”
“Why do I have a feeling I’m going to feel like hurting you when you finish that sentence?” He asked with a groan.
“Defensive.” She smirked. “At least now I know what to say when you become extra prat-ish.” She laughed, letting go of his arm and skipping off down the pavement. “Draco and Potter sitting in a Tree!” She sang loudly as she went.
Harry sat there, trying to breathe, hands shaking as Draco hurried over. Once he was in reach, Harry wrapped his arms around him, burying his face into his shirt. He pressed the side of his face against his chest listening to the other's heart beat for a bit, his breathing ragged. He felt the tears rolling down his cheeks before he even realized he was sobbing, holding the blond hostage in his meltdown. Draco looked down at him, terrified before slowly wrapping his arms around Harry. He pushed his fringe off his forehead, wiping at his tears. "Shush..." Harry clung to him as the sobs were retched out of him. He yelled himself hoarse long before his tears dried up.
Ginny choked on her drink, sputtering a bit before grabbing a napkin and wiping up her mess. Pansy chuckled a bit as Ginny turned as red as her hair. "Someone has an imagination." Pansy purred in her ear.
He shot up, biting his lip. If Pansy got a letter, surely Potter had been the first on the list. And the others… Everyone was going back. Everyone but him..
"How original." She rolled her eyes before looking at her mobile. "Ginny should be over in a bit. I should get dressed." She told them. "Yeah, I should get dressed too, going to see Andromeda." Draco said, hurrying out of the kitchen and disappearing up the stairs.
Draco was the first to wake the next morning, blinking awake and looking around him. He had become used to new surroundings when he fell asleep around Potter. He was a bit surprised when he found that he was still on the couch, snuggled on top of a snoring Harry. He chuckled a bit, sitting up and hitting Harry’s mobile to find what time it was. He nearly knocked it off the table when he saw a picture of himself pop up with the time. He hit the button again, staring at the picture. He remembered from when it had been taken. It had been at the birthday party, he knew because of his outfit.
Andromeda nodded. “Yes, well, my sister can be a bit unthinking when it comes to the bigger picture.”
After another two hours of dealing with the Wizengamot, because they were one hundred percent sure that the letter was fake and refused to hand other Draco’s wand. McGonagall and Kingsley had to come down and confirmed everything before the wand was signed out into Harry’s custody.
He nodded, making sure that he sat with correct posture and on the edge so he didn’t leave an imprint. Andromeda gave him a knowing smile. “You can relax Draco, I have a toddler. Spilt tea and sofa impressions are the least of my worries.”
Spending time alone in Andromeda’s cottage was very cleansing for Draco. He felt like there, with no one around, he didn’t have to be on guard all the time. He could just
“No.. It’s fine.. He would love that someone was reading them.” Harry told him as the blond joined them at the table.
“Of course you aren’t. You’re not fragile by no means, nor are you made of glass. An ungrateful stubborn git but not fragile.” He said, crossing his arms.
Draco was sitting rather uneasily on the soft couch, a steaming mug of tea in front of him. He looked around the sitting room, taking in the vast amounts of muggle things around him. He saw photographs of what  he assumed was his cousin Nymphadora along with what must had been Andromeda’s husband. There was a large bookcase of muggle books that he was itching to investigate, but he stayed where he was. He looked down at his tea, shifting it a bit. She had been a bit startled when she saw him in her kitchen, thinking that he had been Potter.
Draco looked down at the shirt, running his fingertips over the fabric. He laid down on his side, pulling the shirt up to his chest and burying his face into it. He inhaled deeply smelling a rich mixture of rum, grass and body spray.
Though, technically, Draco’s parents weren’t breaking their parole. Or that was what the Auror she had seen had told her. They weren’t using magic, nor were they living in a magic community in Scotland, even though the cousin in question was a witch. She had ran into Granger there and begrudgingly accepted her invite to lunch. She didn’t mind Granger,
fit and tan naked torso, covered in grease and sweat went along with those legs. Draco bit his lip as the other emerged fully. Green eyes locked with grey and they both froze in sheer shock.
Draco struggled against the blanket Harry had just tucked around him, clumsily sitting up. “No. Harry. I’m sorry.” His voice was heavy and slow with sleep. “I should have told you. I’m sorry. I understand if you want to...”
His thoughts were interrupted by Hermione. “Would you really mind if he was into it?” she asked. “I mean, it’s fine if it is a big deal to you, but is it a big enough deal to end the relationship?”
needs an editor. My Luna’s been on at me for years to get someone to help. Bit of a nightmare, really. Spend half my time putting the damned thing together. No time to go exploring. Reckon you might be just the one for the job.”
Draco had tipped his head back to look at the uninspiring white ceiling. “Knickers don’t fit right when you have a penis,” he said, his voice quiet. “Bras don’t fit right when you don’t have breasts to put in them.”
He tipped his head to the side to appreciate her from a new angle. “Of course it’s what I fell in love with,” he said. “I fell in love with you- all of you. Not just the shape of you.”
He pulled out a seat at the kitchen table, watching Hermione as she added sugar and cocoa to the milk. She had to reach over her round belly to stir. She seemed to sense his eyes on her. “This baby likes to turn somersaults in the middle of the night,” she said. “Ron says it’s going to be a seeker, but I think it’s more likely a beater if the punches and kicks are anything to go by. Possibly a boxer, to be honest. A warm drink tends to put them to sleep.” She reached up to pull two mismatched mugs from the cupboard, carefully pouring the hot chocolate.
