“You do realise that you’re supposed to be miserable,” she pointed out. Harry’s smile faltered.
“Why on earth did you come back to school if you had no intention of actually learning anything?” she asked, sounding aghast. Ron shrugged.
“I’ve fantasised about it for so long, Harry. Long before we kissed, before I even realised that I had feelings for you,” Draco admitted, his hand relentlessly stroking Harry’s slick prick back and forth. “I’ve wanted you for so long, I couldn’t believe that you would want me, too. I still can’t believe it sometimes. I just want to give you everything, Harry. Everything of me…”
“Well, clearly you’re not eating enough. You’re practically skin and bones! We’ll get you fed before we go shopping.”
“Where did you go?” he asked breathlessly. “I was looking everywhere for you.”
“I can try,” he argued weakly but Ginny snorted a derisive laugh.
Minerva glanced up at the old headmaster’s portrait hanging above her desk, his bright blue eyes twinkling down at her behind his half-moon spectacles. It was easy for him to look so relaxed in such a time of crisis, she mused. He was just a painting now, free from the pressures of headship. Lucky bugger.
“How does this feel?” he asked, sounding out of breath.
Draco worried his lip. Myrtle made it sound so easy. He envied her confidence in him because he certainly didn’t feel it.
“The play’s a romance, isn’t it? Think about it: if she gets the part of Juliet and you’re Romeo, you’ll need to spend all of your free time rehearsing together.”
“You called, ma’am?” he replied, his voice hoarse with age.
“I’m not trying to defend them, I just think that it’s important to try and understand why people act and think the way that they do,” she explained calmly. “Goyle’s been brought up to hate people like us, especially people like me. The fact that he’s even willing to shake hands with us, that tells me that there’s a chance that his views might change.”
Draco screwed up his face in distaste. “That was disgustingly sentimental.”
“Prefect’s carriage,” Neville explained. “Here, let me help you with your trunk…”
Myrtle clicked her tongue disapprovingly. “Oh, here we go again. Honestly, you sound like a broken record.” She put the back of her hand on her forehead and said in a high-pitched, dramatic voice, “Why, oh why must I feel this way about Potter? He’s so handsome and kind but he hates me so! Potter can never know the way I feel about him! How can I temper this burning passion inside of me? Oh, how I looooove Harry Potter!”
“He wouldn’t be sitting there looking so bloody miserable if it weren’t for us!” said Ron irritably. “We pulled him out of that fire—a fire that Crabbe started—so he should be thanking us!”
“On the contrary,” Draco persisted. “I’m sure you’ve heard it a hundred times or more already, people forever telling you that they
“I’ll let you know,” Harry assured him.
“I know, but—”
“Umm...no.”
“Good work, Mr Potter!” said Hestia approvingly. “Very good work, indeed. Mr Malfoy, would you mind coming over here and giving Miss Weasley a hand?”
A few of the students rolled their eyes at Hermione but she took no notice of them. She looked quite pleased at receiving such high praise.
Harry very much doubted that.
The lion’s eyes snapped open and it let out a ferocious roar. The students' screams were drowned out by the angry lion’s cry as they scrambled over each other to escape the classroom. Meanwhile, Harry, Ron and Neville rushed forward, wands drawn and ready to do battle with the king of beasts. Ron rugby-tackled Hermione to the ground and used his body as a protective shield.
“Alright. Have a fun trip—with Harry,” she giggled, waving him off before she floated over to the newspaper to pore over the obituaries.
Harry grinned and, after checking that the coast was clear, grabbed Draco’s hand and pulled him towards what looked like an ancient, gnarled willow tree, except this one had cherry blossom pink branches and green leaves with red spots. They pushed their way through the low-hanging curtain of branches, letting the leaves fall back into place and obscuring them from any prying eyes.
Draco still looked in two minds about whether he wanted to join Harry. He glanced uncertainly between the thestrals and the pitch black wooded path that led up to the castle.
Ginny’s smile fell. “We’ve been over this, Harry…”
Harry flashed Draco an apologetic look before lifting the end of his trunk and wheeling it over to the car. Mr Weasley's eyes narrowed when he looked at Draco before he turned his attention back to Harry and his luggage. Draco lifted the end of his own trunk and turned his back on Harry and the Weasleys, walking down the busy street without looking back. He wandered aimlessly for a few minutes, trying to find a quiet spot to Apparate from, which was a deceptively difficult task in central London. Eventually, he found a deserted alleyway behind a McDonald’s, took a firm grip of his trunk and clenched his eyes shut just before he Apparated.
Madam Pomfrey pulled a cotton gown—identical to the one that she had given to Draco—over Harry’s head. “Get into bed, Mr Potter, you’re going to be here for the rest of the evening.” Harry tried to protest but the matron was having none of it. “I’m sorry, but your health and wellbeing are my top priority. You may return to your lessons if and when I deem you well enough. For the time being, you are prescribed bed rest. Mr Malfoy…” she said, turning her attention to Draco. “How are you feeling now?”
“Urgh, fine. I’ll see what I can do.”
“Students,” Madam Pomfrey confirmed, popping each boil and squeezing the pus out of them without even batting an eye. “Yes, they happened across a plate of Canary Creams left outside of the Slytherin common room and some students were foolish enough to eat them. Usually, the transformation only lasts a minute but someone has tampered with the biscuits and the students have been stuck like that since last night.”
Hermione cocked an eyebrow at her boyfriend. “I thought you wanted Ginny to play Juliet?”
“And...clearly I’m wasting my time making polite conversation with you,” she noted, leaning back in her chair. “Alright, I’ll be frank with you: in this morning’s lesson, you didn’t engage in class at all. I gave you the benefit of the doubt and put your reluctance to participate down to the fact that it’s a subject that you’re unfamiliar with. But you obviously left your script behind on purpose, and now I’m concerned that this is a pattern of behaviour I’ve to expect for the rest of the year. Personally, I prefer to tackle a problem head-on, so I invited you here to have a little chat about what’s expected of you in my lessons. I have to ask: do you have an issue with the curriculum that I’ve set out?”
“I think so.”
Luna nodded in agreement. “It seemed like Romeo and Juliet really were in love with each other, didn’t it?”
The group continued to argue with Draco about his hazy recollection of events while they queued to enter the premises. Despite the cold weather, a lot of tourists were still hoping to visit the world’s oldest scientific zoo. When they finally entered, Hermione unfolded a map of the park that she’d picked up at the ticket window.
by Laura Thorn sounds like her kind of thing…” Draco’s voice trailed off as he spotted something alarming in the shop window. “Oh, bugger.”
“For the saviour of wizardkind, it’s remarkable how oblivious you are,” he drawled. Ignoring the affronted expression on Harry’s face, he lowered his voice to barely above a whisper, “Haven’t you noticed anything different about some of your fellow classmates?”
“Alright,” he said. “Clearly, this isn’t working.”
Harry was silent for a moment, wondering the same thing. What memories could have upset the likes of Gregory Goyle so much that they would cause him to burst into tears in the middle of class?
“Really?” he replied mildly. “Congratulations.”
Evidently, Ron was keen to put as much distance between himself and Draco as possible. As Ron and Hermione left the Great Hall, Draco waited until they were out of earshot before saying to Harry, “I take that Weasley isn’t happy about us.”
“So, just to be clear, Mr Potter had no knowledge or involvement whatsoever in your group’s activities?” asked Professor McGonagall.
“Me?” he asked, surprised.
Harry laughed. “Yeah, Hagrid’s got many talents but cooking isn’t one of them.”
don’t care what they think.”
Draco frowned. “Why?”
Liv still looked uncertain. “Are you sure?”
Harry looked absorbed in his own thoughts for a few moments before his eyes suddenly widened and a smile spread across his face. Grabbing Draco’s hand he gave it a slight tug.
“You’re not angry?”
The train journey back to London was as unusual as it was unremarkable; it was the first time he and Harry had ever voluntarily boarded the train together. It was strange, sitting in a compartment with two Gryffindors, but Neville proved to be palatable company, even if he did bore on about his house plants for most of the journey. Harry just nodded and smiled along, seemingly content to just listen to Neville talk while Draco read his book. The journey might have been dull but it was infinitely better than being cramped in the toilet cubicle for hours on end.
“Why do I have to play Lady Capulet?” Zacharias whinged. “I’m a bloke, shouldn’t I play Lord Capulet instead?”
“I don’t know.”
“They’re bad luck,” Draco bit out defensively, looking anywhere but at the winged creatures. “They bring all sorts of horrible misfortune to those who can see them and I’ve had quite enough of that lately, thank you very much.”
“Probably. I think Dad only offered to pick us up so that he had an excuse to show off his new car,” Ron explained.
“While I will be adopting certain elements of Professor Burbage’s old lesson plans, I will be including some newer elements to the curriculum. One thing Professor Burbage and I have in common is a passion for the Muggle world, which was why I was so keen to take up this position. I have a lot of experience in Muggle-Wizard interpersonal relations, and my hope this year is to share my knowledge and expertise with you all.”
Ron opened his mouth to speak, then seemed to think better of it and quickly closed his mouth again. He gave a careless shrug and crossed his arms. “Alright, even if that isn’t the case, I think it’s worthwhile reminding you that Malfoy’s been nothing but a foul git since the day we met him. Have you forgotten how hellish he’s made life for you here over the years?”
“I did knock, you must not have heard me,” she said, waving towards the classroom door. “I didn’t mean to startle you.”
While Draco still preferred the Slytherin Dungeons, the fact that you could throw open Harry’s bedroom window and fly out from one of the castle’s highest towers was quite a thrill. Harry’s grip around Draco’s waist tightened as he flew faster and higher, his whoops of excitement carried away in the wind. Draco would never admit it—certainly not to Harry—but the Firebolt was much better than his Nimbus 2001; he was flying faster than he ever had done before, so fast that his hands slid across the smooth polished handle, but he gripped tighter and leant forward, pushing the broomstick to its limits. He felt like his eyes were being forced into the back of his head at the sudden acceleration, the cold air stung his cheeks and his heart hammered in his chest again, this time out of sheer exhilaration. He kept his gaze fixed straight ahead but everything was a blur. The grey of the school rushed into the white of the clouds as they reared upwards, disappearing through the chilly clouds and in an instant, Hogwarts was gone. Moments later, they punched through the other side of the clouds and he blinked rapidly as his eyes struggled to adjust to the crystal clear blue sky consuming his field of vision.
Draco bunched his hands into fists and glared at Myrtle. “I do not sound like that!”
“Not to worry, Hermione. Losin’ ma cabbages is a small price to pay fer gettin’ rid of You-Know-Who once and for all!” he said brightly. “I just count ma blessins that we’re all here together now. I’m so glad ye’s decided to come back this year! I’ve missed you lot.”
“When the war started, Colin and I couldn’t come back to school. Then we got the letter from the Muggle-Born Registration Commission. We’d heard what had happened to other folk who’d gone to the Ministry...so we went into hiding. For
“I suppose not…” he said slowly. “Does that mean that I can’t take the piss out of you anymore? If I’m being completely honest with myself, I’m not sure I can manage that.”
“Our next role,” Liv continued, putting an end to the discussion. “Benvolio, nephew to Lord Montague and friend to Romeo will be played by...Ginny Weasley.”
Not surprisingly, her query was met with silence. Only Hermione Granger’s hand shot up into the air. Liv struggled to suppress a grin at how enthusiastically Hermione was waving her hand in the air.
Ron peered at Ginny’s script and snorted. “Very clever of Luna to pick the role with the least amount of lines.”
“It really is unfair! We’re both single, attractive women—where are we going wrong?” Hestia lamented.
“You started out as a Junior Assistant in Muggle Relations—I contacted Myra Curio, she spoke very highly of you.”
They introduced Hagrid to Asha, who Fang gave a curious sniff before losing interest and flopping back onto his pile of cushions. Hagrid laughed as Asha scurried up his arm and took refuge in his shaggy black beard, only two wide grey eyes visible amongst the mass of wiry black hair.
he thought—but Draco’s expression hadn’t been taunting or smug. If anything, he looked jealous. But almost as soon as they had locked eyes, Draco lowered his head and strode out of sight. Harry frowned to himself:
Liv clinked her cup against Hestia’s and downed the last dregs at the bottom of the tankard before placing it carefully on the table again. Checking her watch, she was surprised to see that it was so late in the evening.
he thought miserably. Maybe what he really needed was a holiday.
Ron shook his head with confusion. “I still don’t understand how you couldn’t know something like that about yourself. I mean, I’ve known that I like girls since...well, since as long as I can remember. It just seems to me like you fancying blokes has come out of nowhere.”
Liv’s face burned red and she lowered her gaze as she realised what she had just said. She seemed to have momentarily forgotten that this was a job interview, but Minerva appreciated her speaking honestly about her feelings.
Looking relieved to get off stage, Harry sheathed his wooden sword and hurried towards the nearest balcony stairwell. Draco quickly shoved his letter into his school bag out of sight and opened his script before Harry could ask about what he had been writing. A minute later, Harry appeared, a big smile on his face as he flopped into the empty seat to Draco’s left.
“Is that a promise?” Harry replied silkily. Draco’s smile grew licentious.
“Well, apart from the fact that you look more like a pauper than a prince—” Harry rolled his eyes at that comment. “—the real issue is the language; it’s a bit beyond your capabilities.”
“You don’t look fine,” she pressed. “In fact, you seem quite poorly. Do you have a fever? You should go see Madam Pomfrey and—”
“I will.”
“Oh?” said Harry interestedly. “For how long?”
Draco stepped back out into the corridor and slammed the compartment door shut behind him. He had to get as much distance between him and his friends (
“I suppose you heard all of that?” he huffed.
“That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? Because it’s what your parents expect of you. It’s clear that you’re not happy about returning and under the circumstances, I can understand why,” she continued. “It will be of no interest to you to hear this, but I know from personal experience what it feels like to be afraid of disappointing your parents. We often end up doing things that are expected of us but seldom do what makes us happy.”
“Nobody thinks you’re mental. They’re staring at you because you’re Ron Weasley, the war hero,” Harry countered. An uncertain but hopeful smile teased Ron’s lips.
“I haven’t had the chance to try it out yet,” he said, holding the broomstick out to Draco. Draco looked between the broomstick and Harry.
“Don’t worry, Professor, I’ll make sure Potter behaves himself,” Draco simpered, earning himself an annoyed glance from Harry.
“You’d be a fool not to,” he argued. “Potter’s a prime example of that, isn’t he? He was destined to vanquish the Dark Lord, and he did just that. Prophecies are not to be trifled with.”
“You’re still angry at me,” she stated quietly, interrupting his train of thought. Draco shoved his hands in his pockets and avoided his mother’s penetrating gaze.
Still a little flustered by Hestia’s seemingly innocuous actions, she blinked. “The what now?”
will know that gender roles are something that Shakespeare explored more in-depth but we can look at that in more detail another day. I thought for our production, it would be interesting to subvert tradition and have women in traditionally male roles and vice versa.”
“We better go,” Ron said, throwing his rucksack over his shoulder and kissing his mother on the cheek. “Bye Mum. We’ll see you at Christmas.”
Neville snapped. He leapt to his feet, pulled the glass tank down and sat it on his lap, peering desperately inside for the slippery amphibian, but the tank was indeed empty. Neville closed his eyes and groaned. “He’s escaped. Again! How does he keep doing that?”
“I must ask what on earth possessed you to buy a rat as a pet?” he asked huffily. “They’re vile little creatures.”
“If I profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: my lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss,” said Harry with a nervous note in his voice. Draco smiled at him.
Harry snorted. “Hardly! But let's be honest, my being there isn't going to go down well with the other Slytherins, is it?”
Draco felt like he was speaking a foreign language dishing out compliments so freely, but Hermione looked pleased nonetheless.
“Fuuuuuuck, you’re so good at that,” Draco groaned. Harry hummed approvingly, sliding his red, wet lips back and forth along the shaft, just the way Draco liked it—the way Harry liked it, too. Keeping a firm hold of Harry’s hair with his right hand, he used his left hand to stroke Harry’s cheek, rubbing the pad of his thumb over his taut lips. “I want to watch you touch yourself while you suck me off.”
“Um…Madam Pomfrey?”
“Did I tell you that I love you?” he simpered before biting into his sandwich.
“Of course.” After another awkward pause, Narcissa cleared her throat and began cautiously, “Draco, I know that you’re still angry with me for sending you back to Hogwarts...”
Hermione scrutinised Harry’s appearance for a moment. “The short sword is also historically accurate, so that’s fine.”
“Thank you, Douglas. A pleasure as always,” he turned to leave and as he disappeared through the velvet curtains he said silkily, “See you at school, Potter.”
“You do realise that Veritaserum is a strictly controlled substance,” said Snape. “You could lose your wand for this.”
Harry watched with quiet awe as Draco performed a head-spinning corkscrew manoeuvre through the air before landing gracefully in front of him, looking extremely impressed with himself.
“Not that confident, if I’m honest,” he admitted.
Happy Valentine's Day, everyone! This week's chapter is short and sweet, I promise next week's will be more substantial. Enjoy!
They came to a stop a few meters away from the Apothecary and Harry groaned. Several journalists and photographers were standing outside the shop looking around impatiently for someone—looking for Harry. Ron turned around and began heading back up the cobbled street.
“Why do you get to go first?” Draco whinged. Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath, it was taking all of his willpower not to knock Draco on his arse with a Bat-Bogey Hex.
“Just give me a minute,” said Harry irritably. His heart pounded painfully in his chest as panic and fear rose up inside of him. It was no use trying to clear his mind when all he could think about was how Draco was going to have a field day wandering through his memories.
“Yes, Professor,” she replied confidently. “I know it’s a little unorthodox, but I think it'll be just what the students need right now.”
“You can’t be serious!” Pansy Parkinson cried.
“Which toilet is yours?” asked Luna.
“What is?”
“She daren’t!” piped up Phineas Nigellus Black suddenly, no longer feigning sleep. “I earned my place here; you can’t remove us based on your own personal prejudices!”
“No, this has all happened a few days ago,” said Myrtle sullenly, floating over their heads. “I was sitting inside one of the drains, minding my own business, when I heard an awful racket. I came back here to investigate and found it like this.”
“Owl me so that I know that you have arrived safely,” she instructed him, her voice a little strained with the effort of keeping her emotions in check. Draco nodded and stared at his feet.
I went to the wrong grate! One time and it was
“Everything that I hate,” she agreed. “Well, I did pop along to Sir Nicholas’s Deathday Party for a bit, but then they all started complaining about how hungry they were. I got so bored listening to them whinging, so I thought I’d come check out what was happening up here instead.”
“I…” he panted, his voice strained. “I just need a minute…”
? I’ll gladly reimburse him the money.”
, she thought ruefully.
Dennis clenched his fists in his lap, scrunching up the photograph. “Then he gets a message from Dumbledore’s Army: Harry Potter’s returned to Hogwarts and it was time to make a last stand against Voldemort. Colin came back here to fight.” Dennis looked up at Harry then, his red eyes streaming with tears. “He came back for
“Do you have a quill?” asked Draco. Harry thought this was a strange request but thought better than to argue with him. Sifting through his school bag, he pulled out fistfuls of stationery, parchment and crumbled biscuits, dumping everything on the desk as he rummaged around the bottom of the bag for his quill. Draco scrunched up his nose in disgust at the assortment of knick-knacks.
“We?” he asked sounding confused. Draco sighed and lowered his mirror.
“Oh. Is that where I’ve wandered into?” she replied, mentally kicking herself for sounding so stupid.
“Now, no more escape attempts!” she warned, wagging a long index finger at them. “I need to go track down the others before I can figure out how to change all of you back. Please, be patient. And be quiet, for Merlin’s sake! I can’t even understand what you’re trying to say. Oh, what is it now?”
“Have you been here all day with Harry?” Myrtle floated through the curtain around Draco’s bed to get a closer look at the other boy before reappearing a few moments later, a mischievous grin on her face. “I think he’s gotten more handsome since the last time I saw him.”
“No, I just didn’t think you’d want to me to see you and Luna...you know…”
“—I saw Lavender die and I didn’t do anything to help,” sobbed Parvati onto Padma’s shoulder. “I could have helped but I was too scared to move!”
“I know that,” she said gently. “But it’s easier to be angry at you than everyone else, isn’t it? They’re hurting right now, but they’ll come around eventually. It’s just going to take some time.”
Looking up from the draft letter he had resting on his lap, he watched as Harry, Ginny and Ron strode across the stage, rehearsing one of their scenes. He wasn’t acting in any scenes today so had settled himself in one of the balconies, taking advantage of the free time to finally write back to his mother. He’d been meaning to do it for a few days now but what with all of his homework, rehearsals and sneaking about the castle with Harry, Draco had very little spare time to do anything else. Okay, perhaps he had been avoiding writing her a letter but better late than never, he reasoned.
“We both know my eyesight is infinitely better than yours. Honestly, my life could be in danger and you’re rolling your eyes at me! Where’s your sense of compassion? If I didn’t know any better, I’d think that you were enjoying this...”
“We’re not supposed to do a lot of things,” Draco shot back lazily. “But if it bothers you that much, go tell Slughorn. I’m sure he’ll give the golden boy Potter a free pass.”
I commissioned the very talented
“Maybe,” said Draco interestedly. “What exactly did you have in mind?”
“I didn’t mean to let them out,” Draco murmured apologetically, but Madam Pomfrey waved her hand dismissively.
“Uh...maybe we should rehearse somewhere else,” Harry said carefully but his suggestion fell on deaf ears as the two Slytherins stood inches apart glaring at each other. The last thing that Draco wanted was to fight with Theo; he was an exceptional duellist for one thing and he didn’t want to get his arse handed to him in front of Harry. Unfortunately, the only other person that Theo currently disliked more than Draco was Harry Potter, so there was a high chance that wands would be drawn at any moment. This really wasn’t how Draco had planned on spending his weekend. Harry watched curiously as the two Slytherins stared each other down for a few tense moments before Theo turned to him.
“To teach everyone a lesson,” he explained. “Everyone in this school is trying to convince themselves that everything is fine. I just proved that it isn’t.”
“Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,” he teased. “Which mannerly devotion shows in this, for saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch. And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.”
“You take that back!” he demanded.
“I remember my lines just fine,” said Harry. “That’s not what I’m worried about.”
“Yeah, you two put on quite a performance,” Ginny added, smirking at Harry who bowed his head, suddenly very interested in the contents of his plate.
Harry’s stomach dropped. “W-what?”
“Yeah, he reminds me of you,” said Ron angrily.
“Are you going or not?” Harry asked irritably. Draco rolled his eyes and strolled past him.
Draco followed Harry up the marble staircase. They glanced at each other from time to time, sharing a nervous smile as they walked in amicable silence. A curious expression formed on Draco’s face and he asked, “Potter, have you brushed your hair?”
“Alright, I suppose there’s no harm in giving it a go.”
“Not much longer, sir,” the tailor assured him, pinching the fabric around the sleeves. “Just a few more minor adjustments…”
“Working hard, I see?” she said accusingly.
“I know that! I was at the Ministry hearings, I heard all about it,” she snapped, waving her hand dismissively. “I still don’t trust him, Albus.”
“I’m sorry if you two had a falling out,” he said.
“It’s alright,” said Draco unenthusiastically. “The animals here are a bit tame for my liking. Have you ever been to the Arcanus Zoo in Wiltshire?”
Harry looked as though he wanted to say something then but instead he chewed his lip and bowed his head. Assuming that their short but civil conversation had concluded, Draco levitated the script in front of his face again and proceeded to read in silence. However, Draco only managed to read a couple of lines when Harry spoke again.
“I’d rather not,” he muttered to himself, tossing the script into the nearest bin.
“So, you moved back to Britain and took up a post in the Ministry at the Muggle Liaison Office where you have worked for the last seventeen years,” she continued, perusing the parchment.
“How’s Trevor faring these days?” asked Harry. Neville sighed and rolled his eyes.
“Are you being serious right now?” asked Harry incredulously.
“Fuck yes,” Harry panted, a surge of arousal coursing through him at the thought of Draco pleasuring himself, thinking of him.
“It’s not boring!” she snapped. “It’s romantic. And that’s not even the best part.”
Draco hesitated. “Well, I just thought...since it’s me…”
“It’s scary,” he admitted, his voice barely a whisper. “I feel like I’m not in control of anything—my future, my life...my mind. I hate it.”
“But how much longer is it going to take?” Phineas pressed. Minerva shot him a sharp look.
favourite team, Ronald!” Hermione retorted. “It might surprise you to learn that your sister’s her own person; you’re not guaranteed to like all of the same things in life. That also goes for people she wants to spend time with and what team she supports. The sooner you learn that, the better.”
Both boys retreated back into their changing rooms, tossed the clothing over the top of the curtains to one another and reemerged a couple of minutes later in each other’s costumes. Much to Ron’s fury, Draco looked like a Roman dignitary in the Shakespearean costume: elegant and regal with skin like pale marble, he resembled one of the sculptures commonly found in the ancient world.
“Looks like they’re almost finished,” he said quietly. “There weren’t many students left waiting at the side to be sorted. We should slip in after the ceremony’s wrapped up.”
“The money would certainly be better than a teacher’s wage at the very least,” Minerva chuckled. “You are a talented young woman with an illustrious career ahead of her. Why would you throw all of that away to take up a position at this school?”
“I saw you and Mr Malfoy lingering by the punchbowl during the festivities. Why didn’t you pour any for yourself?” she asked.
“What in the name of Merlin are you doing?” he asked.
“Mr Malfoy?” she asked. She looked between the two former enemies and shook her head. “Well, you gentlemen certainly keep unexpected company these days.”
“Because I asked them not to.”
The classroom stared blankly back at her and she waved her hand dismissively. “Not to worry, we’ll get round to talking about their contribution to Shakespearean theatre another time. So...who would like to kick things off today? Any volunteers?” She scanned the reluctant faces of her students for a volunteer and, finally, Harry raised his hand. Liv smiled at him, “Excellent! Mr Potter, would you and your group come stand in front of my desk, please?”
Draco swallowed, blinking past the visions of the last time this happened- of the blood, the water, the white
The first thing Draco noticed about his new suitemates as he eyed them warily across the Great Hall was how infuriatingly different they looked—
/I miss the days when I simply knew I loved her./
"It's like a storm cloud," Draco said, yanking Harry's head closer.
Tears prick at his eyes, and he feels overwhelmed. He wants to tell her, desperately. To have someone know, to understand.
"I don't care," Harry lied.
Draco huffs a laugh and brings his book closer to his face. "I suppose the great kindness and compassion of the Chosen One even applies to-"
Harry takes an unsteady step back and sags against the wall. "You left," he says.
"Ok," Harry said calmly. The Great Hall seemed silent as he slipped the paper off the box and opened it, the sound of his breath catching in his throat seemed to fill the room. "Is this—?"
Next update should take much less time.
"Go to sleep, Draco. You're drunk."
He opens his mouth, then closes it. Then opens it again. “How was I supposed to tell you?” he says.
"What are you thinking?" Draco asked softly.
“You cast a spell you didn’t know the
He can feel is breath, hot on his neck, and the faint tickle of one of his curls…
Attached on a small slip of parchment were the names of his new roommates, the last sick joke McGonagall must have orchestrated.
“Oh Merlin,” Pansy mumbles, color rushing to her face. “I’m sorry.”
“I won’t. I wouldn’t do that to you.,” She walks toward him hesitantly, wrapping her arms around him awkwardly. “I’m so sorry.”
"He doesn't
Harry shrugged, and Draco's face fell almost imperceptibly.
He looks up, barely, head bobbing and eyes struggling to focus on his face. “W-Who-“
. The smile Draco sees him flash his friends. The face he makes when focusing in class, soft and full of wonder. Draco just wants to protect it— that warmth was something he couldn't stand to see fade, even with his resentment. Harry protects the entire school, even Draco more than he protects himself, and it hurt Draco. Who was protecting
The suite was more comfortable than he had thought it would be, and the colors more neutral. There was a large sitting area inside on the right, spilling over to the area in front of the kitchen ahead on the left. Stools sat at the island, posed for a lazy breakfast or midday snack, all still empty when Draco climbed to the tower. He had been hoping to beat his suitemates here by taking an old secret passageway through the kitchens. Most of them stopped at the base of the tower to visit with friends, but he suspected Pansy would be up soon. He had failed to answer her last letter, and there was no telling the price she would demand the injustice.
"Where were you last night, mate?"
“I have something for you,” Luna says. She lifts her bag off the floor, bright with enchanted sunflowers in eternal bloom. She lifts a book from inside. “I think you’d make a wonderful writer.”
His hand trembles as he clutches the wand, a silver wisp leaking from it weakly and bleeding into the air under his father’s watchful eye.
“J-Just this once,” she mumbled, swinging the door open hesitantly. “But if anything,
“Like what?” asked Ron huffily.
The door creaked open and when Harry turned in his seat to see who it was, he was shocked to see Hestia Jones enter with Dennis Creevey by her side. What the hell was going on?
Harry chuckled, “Yup.”
time to spare if you two hadn’t ‘gotten lost’ on the way to our room.”
“Th-the what now?” Liv stammered, her hands shaking as she flicked through the lurid-coloured folder.
“Oh. Well, hello then,” Liv laughed nervously. Good lord, why couldn’t she just speak like a normal person in social situations? “Um...would you like a cup of tea?”
“What do you think of this Shakespeare malarky?” he asked. “I’ve never even heard of the bloke before.”
Draco was far from alright. With his eyes clenched shut, his normally alabaster skin had a sickly grey complexion, and his breaths were coming out in short, sharp gasps. Harry grabbed Draco by the shoulders and realised that he was shaking, but Draco roughly pushed him away.
“It’s a nice day,” said Ron, peering out of the nearest window. “Fancy sitting down by the lake for a bit?”
“I suppose I better,” he sighed. “I’ll admit that my grasp of Muggle cultural references is fairly limited. I might need your assistance on this one.”
The Three Broomsticks was always packed on a Saturday afternoon but they managed to find a small table in the corner of the pub to themselves. After Hestia shed her heavy cloak and scarf, she made her way to the bar to get the first round of drinks while Liv patiently guarded their table and seats. A couple of the students caught her eye and waved and she smiled politely in return. Her smile widened as Hestia quickly returned clutching two foaming tankards of Butterbeer.
Draco opened his mouth to reply but Harry shushed him as they approached the entrance to the Great Hall. Draco gaped at Harry in utter disbelief.
Ron’s gaze flitted towards Draco and annoyance flashed across his face before he sighed and muttered, “Sure. Whatever.”
“What are you doing?” he hissed.
“You really think so?” he asked uncertainly.
“Oh no, the fault is mine!” Liv protested quickly. Without thinking, she thrust out her injured hand to Hestia then quickly dropped it before holding out the uninjured one instead. “Liv Tonks.”
“So that’s why you’re being so friendly with him?” asked Ron. “For the play?”
Professor McGonagall’s eyes narrowed. “No shenanigans from either of you. Is that understood?”
Draco smirked. “Oh? Anyone that I know?”
character—”
“Fine, you go first if it’s so important to you,” he replied through clenched teeth.
Liv nodded in agreement and declared, “No man could perfectly reveal human nature and the desires of the heart more than William Shakespeare. He perfectly captures the pathos of adolescent romantic love: Romeo, who declares it is pointless to attend the Capulet masquerade ball because he could never
“Right. Well, if you could please stand on the stool, sir,” he instructed politely but firmly.
Draco scoffed. “Certainly not! Merlin, you’re quite the narcissist, aren’t you? Besides, I’m supposed to be dressing up as someone from the Muggle world. Your magical abilities might be somewhat lacking in certain areas, but you’re no Muggle.”
Luna gave Myrtle a serene smile. “Don’t worry, we’ll get this fixed for you in no time.” She drew her wand and pointed it at the broken shards of mirror that littered the floor,
Harry frowned and sat upright. “No right? You’ve spent hours waltzing around in my head seeing my worst memories. I manage to get past your defences for a split second and you freak out!”
doing here?” he asked accusingly.
he thought to himself.
Suddenly, the mug on Liv’s desk exploded and shards of ceramic flew in all directions, drenching the desk in tea. Liv jumped in fright and immediately attempted to mop up the mess with the sleeve of her robes but then, seemingly remembering that she was a witch, drew her wand and vanished the broken mug and spilt tea in the blink of an eye.
Draco downed his drink as an excuse to exit the conversation that was hitting a little too close to home and headed to the bar for a refill. Thankfully, he didn’t have to wait long for his drink. He slid the money across the bar and took a sip from the chilled glass, enjoying the heat of the whisky burning his throat. He felt someone step up to his right side and say, “A pint of bitter, please.”
Turning his back on Ron’s bed, Harry was surprised to face Seamus, who was attempting to tip-toe from Dean’s bed back to his own. Seamus froze mid-step when he noticed Harry watching him, a look of mild panic written across his face. It took Harry’s sleep-addled brain a few seconds to realise what Seamus had been up to and a tense silence followed as Seamus waited to see what Harry’s reaction would be. Harry sat his wand on top of the bedside table and turned away without saying a word. A moment later, he heard the creak of Seamus’s mattress and although Harry kept his eyes shut, he was too awake to fall back to sleep now.
“Do you know what time it is?” she demanded.
“What people?”
“This…” she said flatly, jabbing the page with a bony index finger. “This is part of your plan?”
“Is everything alright, Myra?” she asked, concerned. “If the rum punch is an issue, I’ll tell Dirk to make himself scarce…”
“Mal,” Hestia repeated thoughtfully. “That’s a nice name.”
“Why did you help me?” he asked in an accusatory tone.
It took all of Harry’s willpower to resist rolling his eyes at the derisive comment. He may see Snape in a new light after viewing his memories in the Pensieve, but that didn’t make him any more fond of the man. “Would you rather I just called you Snape, for old times’ sake?”
It was taking all of Harry’s willpower not to hex Draco right there and then. He should have known better than to try and be friendly with Draco. Clearly, he was enjoying tormenting Harry, just like he always had. So much for friendship, or whatever it was…
Draco roughly ran his hand through his hair and shook his head. “I don’t know...it could be a number of things. What am I going to do?”
“Oh. Hi Harry, I didn’t know you were here,” he said sheepishly.
Draco fell back onto the soft bed, laughing hard. It was the most fun he’d had in as long as he could remember. It was strange that he was enjoying himself with Harry of all people, but he tried not to think about it too much; he just wanted to enjoy the moment while it lasted. Draco let out a contented sigh and looked at Harry.
“Dunno,” Harry shrugged. “Whatever it is, it’ll be no substitute for Quidditch.”
“I’d rather you didn’t.”
Ron scowled and turned his attention to Harry, lightly jabbing him on the arm. “Since when have you and Malfoy been pals?”
“Hestia!” she said breathlessly, trying to lean casually on the shelf to her left then immediately straightened when the bookcase wobbled dangerously. “What are you doing here?”
There was an audible
“Have you had the chance to fly again since we were last here?” asked Harry, following Draco as he waded through the grass to the centre of the pitch.
when Hermione cleared her throat to get his attention. He glanced up over the top of his magazine to look at her.
What did Harry know about fashion? He’d spent most of his life wearing Dudley’s hand-me-downs, so he didn’t feel like he was the best person to get fashion tips from. But rather than argue this point, Harry gave Neville a quick once-over and thought that he looked like the kid from the Milkybar commercials, but said that he looked like John Wayne instead. Neville, not knowing who that was, looked confused, but Harry assured him that it was a compliment. When they reached Liv’s class they found her waiting outside the classroom for them.
Gratitude momentarily flickered across Draco’s face and he nodded. It was gone as quickly as it had appeared but Harry had seen it and gave him the faintest of smiles before Draco began to speak.
so before we begin the lesson I’ll put you all out of your misery and announce who will be playing each role,” she continued. “First, I’m pleased to announce that the role of Juliet’s Nurse goes to...Luna Lovegood.”
Liv scoffed, “There’s been rumours for years, Myra, you can’t believe every one that you hear.”
Pansy smiled sadly at him. “We wouldn’t be Slytherins otherwise. Self-preservation is paramount.”
“Don’t pretend that you’re not just as competitive as I am. It’s one of your few admirable qualities. If you weren’t so impulsive, I dare say that you’d make a good Slytherin.”
“You’re in no position to be making fun of anyone,” Harry reminded him coolly. “Your name and your reputation are in the gutter. Your father is too ashamed to even show his face in public anymore and after everything that happened, I’m surprised that you can. Despite everything that’s happened, you haven’t changed a bit. You’re so insecure that you’ve spent years making fun of me and my friends, just to make yourself feel better, so the only joke here is you.”
In an instant, the noise of the city was drowned out by the wind roaring past his ears as he spun blindly through the blackness, but just as suddenly, the wind dissipated and his feet hit ground quite different from the one he’d just left behind. Draco didn’t immediately open his eyes. Instead, he listened. Here, he had to strain his ears to detect any sound. He could just pick up the
“Lost?” Ginny chanced. Harry nodded. Ginny gave him a sympathetic pat on the arm.
Muggle-Born, I should say—so I read some of his plays in primary school.” At the surprised expression on Harry’s face, Myrtle’s eyes narrowed. “Why do you look so shocked? Don’t think I’m clever enough to know who Shakespeare is, do you?”
Draco gave Harry a searching look. “So, how do you feel about me?”
“My only love sprung from my only hate!” she despaired. “Too early seen unknown, and known too late! Prodigious birth of love it is to me, that I must love a loathed enemy.”
Yes, watching everyone be driven to distraction by his successes would be incredibly satisfying. Everything else aside, this was Draco’s last opportunity to annoy Harry Potter as much as possible before they would part ways, probably forever. It seemed like too good an opportunity to pass up.
“Of course, they’re not as good as The Weird Sisters,” he drawled. “Or as good looking, I imagine.”
“Hi,” he greeted her a little too brightly.
Harry wasn’t able to concentrate during the lesson, either. He couldn’t help but wonder why he always seemed to find himself in these awkward situations. The prospect of acting in front of the whole school was much more daunting than playing Quidditch. He was a natural at flying and his quick reflexes made him an ideal Seeker. Quidditch was fun. Quidditch was easy. Acting, however, was foreign to him and he felt completely out of his depth. He experienced similar feelings of confusion and anxiety when his name had been read out of the Goblet of Fire. The upside was that at least there was a fairly low chance of being killed while performing a play. Despite his initial panic, Harry quickly rationalised the situation: so this result was unexpected, but it wasn’t the end of the world. He’d been through a lot worse than learning a few lines and wearing a ruff collar.
Ginny patted him reassuringly on the back but made no attempt to hide her wicked grin. “Don’t worry about it, it’s only acting! And now that you two are friends, it’ll make this a lot less awkward, won’t it? It’ll be like kissing me.”
It went without saying that they would have to be quiet, lest the poor shopkeeper found them as they would most definitely get kicked out, and wouldn’t that be embarrassing. Still, the risk of getting caught wasn’t enough to dissuade Harry from engaging in a very quick and very quiet hookup with his boyfriend. On the contrary, the risk of getting caught made it more exciting. But Harry wasn’t worried about getting caught because he knew he could be quiet if he needed to be. He’d spent several years sharing a dormitory with four other teenage boys: he had ‘keeping quiet’ down to an art form now.
“He hasn’t been located anywhere on the school grounds, therefore, Professor Jones believes that he is currently hiding in the Room of Requirement,” Snape explained without elaborating who they were talking about. “She is heading there now.”
“Oh. Okay.”
“Take my portrait down if it so pleases you. All that I ask is that I be rehomed in the Slytherin Common Room. I may as well be where my endeavours are appreciated,” huffed Severus.
“You’re smarter than you look.”
“I hope you understand why I had to ask.”
Harry choked on his coffee and kept his head bowed, trying to hide the guilty expression on his face behind the latest issue of
Liv’s smile broadened as an excited murmur spread throughout the crowd and she continued. “Since we’ve been learning about Muggle society and culture this semester, that will be the theme of this year’s costume party: famous Muggles! Whether it be real people or famous characters from Muggle literature, this is an opportunity to show what we’ve learned so far this year, and to show our appreciation and admiration for our Muggle brethren. There will be Muggle-themed party games as well—bobbing for apples, wrap the mummy, and a graveyard scavenger hunt—and, of course, a prize for best costume! Further information about the festivities will be posted to the notice boards in each house. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact myself or Miss Jones. Thank you!”
are,” she countered. “Being gay isn’t a big deal.”
“Well, excuse me for not taking style tips from someone that dresses like my great-aunt Druella,” Draco bit back.
Hestia smiled warmly at her. “No problem. I’m Hestia, by the way, Hestia Jones. Sorry, I haven’t even properly introduced myself and I’m already causing injuries to my fellow colleagues.”
Draco watched the barman duck under the bar to retrieve a clean pint glass before turning to find Liv by his side.
“You can’t really expect me to wear this,” he griped.
“Her name was Hedwig,” he replied shortly. “She died.”
“Eventually. Until then…” Professor Switch drew his wand and transfigured a piece of chalk into a large white cowboy hat. He gave it a once-over before placing it on top of Neville’s head. “There we go! Much better.”
“I’m sorry I haven’t been to see you recently,” he said as sincerely as possible. “I’ve been quite busy…”
“For as long as we need it,” said Draco casually. “Hopefully all day.”
Draco nodded. She carefully turned his hands over and inspected the damage. “My first thought would be that you had a slight mishap in Potions class, but the day’s lessons haven’t even started yet. Did someone do this to you?”
“I don’t believe this,” Ron despaired. “First you two make friends and now this! What next? Actually, don’t answer that, I don’t want to know.”
Draco didn’t respond, but a little bubble of happiness swelled inside of his chest at those words. Although he still felt apprehensive about showing physical affection in public, he cast a swift glance over the other students to make sure nobody was watching before pressing a quick kiss to Harry’s cheek and pretending to read his script again. It wasn’t the full blown type of affection that he knew Harry wanted, but it was something that Draco was working on building up gradually.
Hestia raised her tankard in the air. “Cheers to that.”
“You have your moments,” she joked and a mischievous grin spread across her face. “So tell me, is Harry a good kisser? I bet he is!”
Minerva raised her eyebrows in surprise. “Yet you still went to work?”
“Well, I am!” Draco insisted. “And you know that I’m telling the truth.”
“I wasn’t hiding!” he replied defensively. “I was...well, I’m sure you can guess. Just get out of my way, will you?”
“Malfoy,” said Harry again. “During the Welcoming Feast, he wasn’t sitting with his friends. I figured it was because we turned up late and there was no room for him at that end of the table, but he’s been sitting on his own during meal times. Come to think of it, he hasn’t sat next to Nott and Goyle during any classes, either. What do you suppose is going on with them?”
“Oh god, keep talking like that and I’m gonna blow my load,” Harry warned, already panting for breath.
After their fourth drink (or was it their fifth?), Liv was beginning to feel pleasantly tipsy and Hestia’s cheeks had an appealing rosy glow to them. The conversation had moved on from books and classwork and they proceeded to commiserate on their lacklustre love lives. Normally, Liv would have shied away from discussing that particular topic, but drinking copious amounts of mulled Butterbeer would loosen anyone’s tongue.
Just then the hospital door swung open again and Draco felt his pulse race a little quicker as Harry came in, closely followed by Professor Sprout. It was embarrassing enough being covered in a gross, sticky yellow pus in front of the whole school; the last thing he needed was for his nemesis to see him covered in bandages. He could easily imagine Harry running off to tell everyone what an idiot he looked (if the shoe was on the other foot, it’s what he would have done). Draco tried to use the script to shield his face from view but let it fall back onto his lap when he noticed that the sleeves of Harry’s robes were badly burnt. Draco felt a pang of sympathy in the pit of his stomach when he saw that the skin on Harry’s hands and arms was red and blistered and his face was etched in pain. Madam Pomfrey dashed to Harry’s side and beckoned him over to the bed next to Draco’s.
The guards weren’t the only ones to give Hermione and Ron an unwelcome reception. As they made their way down the vast marble hall, every goblin that caught sight of them glared at the pair. Hermione stepped closer to Ron and whispered, “They don’t look very happy to see us, do they?”
A wide grin spread across Draco’s face and he picked up his own ball. He was never one to turn down a challenge. But much to Draco’s annoyance, Harry succeeded in throwing the next two balls into the bedpan whereas he only managed one. In true tactless Gryffindor style, Harry cheered and punched the air in celebration.
Ron speared the cheesy tortilla and plopped it onto his plate before tucking in. Draco grimaced at his atrocious table manners but said nothing. The fact that Ron had spoken to Draco in an almost friendly manner wasn’t lost on him, and given how low he was feeling right now, he was rather grateful for it.
“That my sister is out-of-bounds.”
Draco snorted. “I think that whomever your sister chooses to talk to is entirely up to her, Weasley.”
“I will eventually,” he said, tossing the pillow back onto the bed. “I’m not ashamed of who I am, but the less they know, the better. Things are complicated enough with my parents at the moment, it would be better to wait until after I’ve graduated and moved out of the Manor before I speak to them about it. What about you? Do Weasley and Granger know?”
“Because it interests me and I enjoy watching Weasley get angry,” he admitted, unable to tear his eyes away from the trio as their argument grew more heated.
“It’s a common misconception, but the play isn’t about fate or destiny—it’s about the human condition,” she argued. “Shakespeare believed that people are governed more by their faults than their strengths—it’s a theme that’s present in many of his works.”
Draco met his mother’s keen gaze. “I am. Happier, I mean.”
“Fine,” said Draco mildly. “Let’s swap costumes and see who wears it better, shall we?”
“I’m fine,” he replied quickly, trying to keep his voice steady. “I’ll try my best not to outshine you.”
Professor Switch nodded in agreement. “It also explains how varied people’s symptoms are. There are a lot of factors to consider: an individual's body mass, their degree of tolerance, the rate of digestion, the time they drank the punch…”
“Mal.”
“Would you like to hazard a guess?” Snape sneered.
“You really think so?” he asked uncertainly.
“You won’t if you keep carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders,” she warned. They both sat at the foot of the tree, Ginny sitting cross-legged in front of Harry while he rested against the trunk again, avoiding her gaze. She gave him a searching look.
“Serenity isn’t a place, Harry, it’s something that you need to find within yourself.”
“You know, it’s hard to concentrate on fixing my hair when you keep nattering in my ear like a bloody Augurey,” Draco said testily, trying to change the subject. Harry grabbed him by the shoulder and made Draco face him. This drew a few curious glances from his classmates, but he didn’t care.
“Oh. Yes, right...” she hesitated before trying to take a bite out it but her teeth clacked off of the solid surface like it was made of stone. Hermione winced and carefully sat her cake back onto the plate. “It seems I’ve not got much of an appetite, I’m afraid. I’ve been feeling a bit under the weather today.”
Harry’s fist had barely connected with the door when it suddenly flew open. He recoiled slightly as he came face to face with an extremely irritable Hermione.
Harry James Potter’s tale was one as old as time itself: a young boy who believed that he was unexceptional in every way until one day his life is changed forever. The once-ordinary boy achieves extraordinary things and embarks on many adventures; it’s a familiar story that we’ve all read before, stories that Harry himself read as a child. Long story short, he beat the bad guy, saved the day and got the girl, and they all lived happily ever after.
“H-Harry,” he stammered. “Slow down, I’m gonna…”
Professor McGonagall waited patiently, giving Dennis plenty of time to respond, but he just stared back at her and refused to speak. Professor McGonagall sighed and said, “Turn out your pockets, please.”
“If you’re going to disband one house then you’d have to get rid of all of them,” she argued.
“You shall find me apt enough to that, sir,” Harry replied evenly. “And you will give me occasion.”
Harry did as he was instructed and raised his arms either side of him, posing like a scarecrow. The tailor drew his wand and gave it a slight flick. A small gasp escaped Harry’s lips at the sudden appearance of several measuring tapes floating above his head. He watched with interest as they uncoiled themselves like white snakes and proceeded to take measurements, slithering along his arms, legs, waist and collar. Several lengths of black cloth and a box of silver pins then flew out of a nearby drawer and began pinning themselves to Harry’s body. He couldn’t help but smile to himself at the elegant dance of fabric, tape and pins floating around him as they constructed a basic outfit; no matter how mundane, he would forever be enchanted by magic in all its forms.
“Sorry about that. It was the quickest way of getting rid of him short of hexing him,” he explained. “I didn’t think he’d still be here. He usually goes to Hogsmeade with the others.”
“Piss off, Malfoy!” he spat.
Draco opened his mouth to argue but quickly closed it again when he couldn’t think of a counter-argument. He hated to admit it but Myrtle had a point.
McKinley hesitated a moment before nodding. “Yes.”
by J.R.R. Tolkien,” she read aloud with a curious frown creasing her forehead. “What’s this about?”
Harry smiled warmly at Luna. The painting was even better than he could have imagined and Myrtle’s reaction was just what he had hoped it would be. For the most part, anyway...
“What?” asked Harry curiously.
“What are you doing here?” Harry blurted out without thinking.
“Look, I know that things between us have been...awkward, lately…”
“What’s wrong with my masculine virility?” he demanded.
Harry sidled his way past the crowd to stand next to Hermione. “What’s happening? Is the door locked?”
“Oh?” she said interestedly. “What did he do?”
“Exactly!” she said brightly. “Your parents got over that little snafu with You-Know-Who, I’m sure they’ll get over you having a boyfriend.”
“Bollocks.”
“With an attitude like that, are you sure you’re not a Slytherin?” Draco teased, earning him a foul glare from Ron.
Harry raised his eyebrows in surprise. “Really? What did your parents say when you told them that you were gay?” When Draco didn’t answer, a look of understanding dawned on Harry’s face. “You haven’t told them, have you?”
“Yes, but for some reason, getting a bite out of someone else’s always tastes so much better,” Draco reasoned before running his tongue around the melting edge of the cone.
A devilish grin spread across Draco’s face as he added a speech bubble beside Harry’s head and wrote in elegant sloped handwriting,
“I suppose it is nicer than my last toilet,” she mused. “But it’s just not the same. It’s not the one I
Draco shook his head. “She did nothing of the sort. I came over here of my own accord.”
“Ah. Well, nothing’s changed there, then,” said Ron cheerfully.
“O happy dagger, this is thy sheath: there rust, and let me die.”
Hermione looked thoughtful for a moment before saying, “Merlin was in Slytherin and he was one of the greatest wizards of all time.”
“And you never will be,” Draco shot back. “Not unless you learn to get your emotions under control.”
Despite the weather, Liv always loved visiting Hogsmeade. Having grown up in a secluded Muggle seaside town, she had always anxiously looked forward to the school day trips to the only all-wizarding village in Britain, relishing the opportunity to immerse herself in the magical world and its culture, which still felt relatively foreign to her then. The chance to spend time in the village again was one of the benefits of taking up the teaching post at Hogwarts and she was relieved to find that even after all of these years, Hogsmeade had remained relatively unchanged; Honeydukes was still packed with excitable, sweet-toothed students, Madam Puddifoot’s Tea Shop was still open for business, and the Hog’s Head Inn remained the homestead to a host of shady and interesting characters. It was just as magical as she remembered.
“Yeah, he told me what happened,” said Harry. “He feels really bad about what he said to you.”
Yaxley’s pale blue eyes lingered on Liv’s left hand. “Am I to presume correctly that there isn’t a Mister Tonks waiting for you at home?”
“Mmhmm.”
“A peck on the lips? That’s how I would kiss my grandmother,” he said, sounding annoyed. “You’re supposed to be in love with me, for Salazar’s sake.”
Liv did as she was instructed and sat in the seat on the opposite side of the table, giving her boss a puzzled look.
“Like this?” Draco pressed his fingers in deep enough to brush against Harry’s prostate. Harry’s eyes flew open and he cursed loudly, causing a devilish grin spread across Draco’s face. “Does that feel good?”
“Why does everyone assume that he’s the one who did anything? It was actually my fault, if you must know.”
A sly smile spread across his face. “Sneaking off somewhere quiet so that I can have my way with you.”
“I do have something new to show you, actually!” said Neville excitedly, grabbing Harry’s attention again. On the table in front of the window sat a small potted plant which Harry thought looked like a bonsai tree. Neville sat the pot on his lap so that Harry could take a closer look.
“So, are you finally going to tell me who you fancy?” she queried. Liv let out a nervous laugh.
Harry’s brain seemed to have stalled. Surely, he had misheard her. He watched as though detached from his own body as Liv slipped the new script into his outstretched hand, wished him congratulations and walked to the front of the class again. He stared at his script, genuinely shocked that Liv had picked him for the role, even if Draco wasn’t. Not that he thought that he’d performed badly during his audition, but there were others who seemed more keen to be in the play than he was. For instance, Seamus patted a disappointed-looking Dean on the shoulder and Zacharias looked as though he wanted to throw his script at Harry’s head. Before he could voice his confusion, Liv was speaking again.
“Yes, I quite agree. I had the opportunity to work with her myself during my Ministry days. So, you worked your way up the ranks until you were appointed the Department Head two years ago upon Myra’s retirement,” Minerva looked up from the parchment and gave Liv a searching look. “It’s a very impressive C.V. You’ve achieved a lot for someone so young.”
“Yeah, it took me longer than I care to admit to realise that I just had to use wandless magic to Summon it,” Harry laughed. “So, we’re good?”
“Me neither,” he admitted. “But life has a funny way of proving us wrong.”
“Careful, Weasley, that almost sounded like a compliment,” he joked.
“Speak for yourself,” Draco chuckled. “You’re a wanted man, Zorro. There’s a large bounty on your head. I ought to slap some cuffs on you and collect the reward."
meet a woman to match the fair Rosaline, falls head over heels in love with Juliet the moment he lays eyes upon her.”
who’s the bad influence?” he teased. “Your list of crimes are as long as my arm: Lewd conduct. Public nudity. Solicitation…”
“Ron, you shouldn’t be telling us what memories you saw!” chastised Hermione.
“He really is a vile git. I mean, what do they even talk about?” he asked aloud to nobody in particular. “They’ve got nothing in common!”
“Draco, what’s wrong?” he asked again, feeling a stab of panic rise up in him at Draco’s odd behaviour. Draco seemed to snap out of his trance and his eyes flitted towards Harry’s.
“We have been through this before, Minerva,” said Albus angrily. “Draco Malfoy was a mere pawn in Voldemort’s schemes. He was not the one who killed me.”
“I know but...why are you rehearsing?” Harry pressed. “Surely you’re not actually interested in acting in the play?”
“Bloody hell, Harry…” he croaked, collapsing back into his seat.
“And I’m still trying to wrap my head around that,” he shot back. “I haven’t allowed myself to think about having those things everyone else wants for a really long time; a job, a home, a family—what was the point of torturing myself wanting things that I could never have?”
Harry snatched up the robes from the floor and tossed them at Draco’s head. “Never mind that, hurry up and grab your stuff or else we’ll be stuck travelling back to London together.”
"You don't know what a piggyback ride is?"
After a summer spent almost entirely alone, he was ready to have an actual conversation with his friends, to see how they were really doing outside of the letters they sent embossed with their initials. Still, when the letter finally arrived to announce his official return to the school, Draco felt sick.

Of all the wizarding world's celebrities, the Boy Who Lived Twice was unprecedented. But what else could they have expected from a man who rose from the dead? Merlin, who hopped right back up and defeated the Dark Lord? If you believed the news, there was no wizard more desirable for your trial, charity, or gala on the planet, and it was almost impossible to disagree.
But enemies don’t stay with you through sleep. Villains don’t save the life they’re trying to destroy.
"You said-"
"The bond's just-" He added carefully, standing. "A little tight."
," Draco sputters.
Draco looks at him skeptically and his eyes narrow. “Being gutted doesn’t exactly tickle, Potter,” he mumbles. “But no, since Pomfrey healed me it mostly just itches.”
Thanks for your continued support.
It's different this time. There is no long slash, no scrawled "sorry" in Harry's messy hand, just short scratches, as if he had reached through a shattered window, and silence. Which is somehow worse. Because Draco had sat in the stands, saw Harry stumble and fall, hands grasping Cedric's body, heard him shout the words he knew would destroy him.
Harry Potter,
Fear burned bright in his chest, and instinctually he jerked his arm away, holding it to his breast. “I don’t know what you mean.”
"Pffshh. They're not going to kick me out."
"What about the Room of Requirement?"
"It'll be worth it," Draco said, behind the curtain.
He steeled himself against the lash back, ready to fall into the old patterns from past years, prickly and comfortable in their familiarity. Still, Harry simply turned, standing stick-straight and stupid, mumbling something along the lines of "Oh, well. You know."
Harry startled, giving his dresser a fleeting glance and wrinkling the paper in his hands. "I—uh—yeah."
Much love.
"Pomfrey's just checking his vitals before he leaves."
"As worried as I am about Draco, that's not what I'm worried about," Hermione said hesitantly.
"Narcissa Malfoy is coming to Hogwarts," Hermione said. "And she's convinced that the best thing for Draco is removing the bond."
He was tired of being so overwhelmed, trapped in a path he didn’t choose and couldn’t abandon. He wanted to fight, but he didn’t want to be the reason for fighting. He didn’t want it to depend on him.
Pansy Parkinson,

"Did you have breakfast?"
“Please.”
It's penned carefully as if Draco were writing a formal correspondence, though the ink seeps into the pores of his skin
Luna has her hands cupped together in her lap, staring out across the lake at the stillness and the fading light bleeding over the water.
"Let me see the boy's arms," he said. Draco's eyes were wide in fear, his eyes fixed on the still-running faucet.  Lucius sighed and reached out to Mr. Parkinson.
,” Hermione whispers, and more bandages unravel from her wand. They sit together in relative silence, Draco's sleeves pulled up to where Hermione can help him heal the superficial cuts matching Harry's wounds. Hermione's fingers brush over the faded ink of a long-ago sketched Saturn as she wraps his deeper wounds with the bandages. Harry sleeps on bed, arms bandaged and stitched up, blood partially replenished by some spell Draco had never heard before. They had moved him back to his room after Hermione checked that his roommates were gone. Draco was still amazed with Hermione’s spellwork.
"Sorry," he mumbled, looking away. He slid back from his stance over Draco, sitting with his knees placed protectively in front of him.
He turns, and Draco’s hands shake, his chest aching. “Wait.”
The most important development in the suite for Harry turned out to be not Malfoy, but dinner. At McGonagall’s suggestion, eating outside the Great Hall was a pleasant break from the swarm that always zeroed in on him and the others. Sometimes Seamus, Dean, and Pansy slipped out to sit at their respective house tables. Still, it was usually the five or six of them together.
"Did you like your gift?"
"And then what? Continue hiding out in the kitchen?"
"Did you think you could just- just
, because at least it involves two men- he wasn't feeling all that interested in the incredibly low-cut dresses on the others, or any series of novels with a "Dick Ripper".
Draco feels his stomach drop at the word. "About the cutting," he mumbles. “Not that we’re… whatever we are.”
Draco heard Harry gasp, and then mutter, “Nothing to say.”
Draco felt like he was on fire, the warmth of Harry's skin and lips made his breath come quicker. He had waited so long to see Harry like this, his eyes glazed over with pleasure, but this wasn't how he pictured it.
Pansy takes a cautious step forward, and shrugs off her sweater to reveal the writing on her own arm, beautiful and curved, the color of the ink changing by letter or by word. Swirls and designs surround the words and flow down her arm. She’s quiet for a moment, and her heart twinges in her chest. “I… Mine is Luna.”
The blood tastes like rust, and he sees his father's arm rear back to strike him, hears the spraying water of the broken sink, and he is being eaten away— the rotting wood of the manor; the maggots on the bird— /if you take away all the things you've been told you are and there's nothing left, are you still living?/
"I wanted to be loved! I wanted to be safe," Harry says breathlessly. "I
"I was born in July." Harry replied. Draco rolled his eyes.
“It’s not your fault. He makes his own decisions.”
"What?" asked Ron.
Draco’s chest is tight, and he feels like he’s choking on his empathy, eyes heavy and nails digging into his palms. He could have

It's underlined a few times and despite the pain of his leg, Harry smiles. The other writer had never been anything but proper with his language, and Harry's chest felt tight with the thought that he might care,
"Pansy said its not good for a bond to be formed on lies."
He heard Draco take a deep breath, eyes finally settled onto his own.
, Draco thought deliriously.
He scrambles up from the floor and leans over the bed, the frame digging into his stomach, and wraps Harry in his arms before he can consider the consequences. His fingers trail Harry’s arm and smooths circles on his shoulder. Harry stifles a sob, and turns onto his side, hands releasing the sheets in favor of clutching Draco’s shirt, his face shoved into the bed. And-
“I understand you're already healed, but the dittany will help with the scarring."
"Come, meet your betrothed, Draco. This is Pansy Parkinson and her father." Draco bowed warily, exactly as his father had instructed him to. He took the girl's left hand and pressed his lips to the back of it. As she drew back, Draco swore he could see flowers etched under the gold.
Sure, she knows what happened to make her this way, but it doesn't make it better. She met the Dark Lord. Pansy would never put Luna in that kind of danger, no matter how much she cared for her; so she stops. Luna still writes— about the creatures she loves so dearly, the weather, anything at all to keep in contact.
There’s pity in her eyes as she takes a step back. “The war won’t go on forever,” she mumbles.
He is alone- as flightless as the bird. Trapped in a closet that can only lead to death, and yet he cannot open it.
Draco glanced at Harry, unsure. "I'll wait outside then." Harry said.
He stares at the floor, hears the ticking of the common room clock and the wind moving through the hall. “I don’t know if you want me to try.”
But Harry wasn't letting up.
Draco takes a deep breath and lifts his wand from his pocket. “I’m going to cast a charm- it’ll allow you to talk to me when I leave. If you stop talking, I’ll come back.”
__________
Harry leans forward just as Draco leans back, bracing his hand against his chest. "Think about what you're doing for a minute."
Her arm drops an inch, and her eyes are glued to the mess of Draco’s arm. “Are you-?”
Harry presses his lips together and stares at him meaningfully. “There won’t be one.”
He pulled Draco back down, but he just smirked and ghosted his lips over Harry's. He made a desperate noise,
scrawled just under it.
This is a direct continuation of the last chapter, as well as some with my lovely girls. Let's hope I'm better with the smooches!
"It's a good surprise," Harry insisted. The boy just stared at him. "C'mon."
Harry stirs on the bed and Draco’s ears go pink.
"It just feels like a hangover-" (
"What exactly does a courtship entail?" Harry asked. Draco felt a spark of irritation in the back of his throat.
"That's better," Draco said, turning to Harry. "You look like I'm about to torture you."
Headmaster Minerva McGonagall, Order of Merlin First Class
, to help Harry. No one else knew. How could they?
Draco smiles.
Draco ground his teeth, and scrubbed more harshly at the material, the spot simply refusing to fade.
Pansy looks at her, curious, and Luna smiles at her. “You deserve to tell your story too.”
Harry mumbles something under his breath and draws back, resolving to stare at him creepily as he reads, chin resting in his hand. Eventually, Draco closes the book, dogearing the page and frowning at him.
There’s a silence for a moment, before he feels writing again.
“Potter,” he says. “It’s fine. I promise.”
"You must be joking," Hermione sighed. Harry stared at her dumbly. "The bond, Harry! An unfinished bond is dangerous!"
"Well no," he said apologetically. "A crest isn't technically active or recognized by the state until a bond is completed."
"He gave me a gift today," Harry mused. Hermione rolled her eyes.
He feels nauseous. He doesn’t hear the words that are spoken, but panic fills him. Not Harry.
"Merlin no, did you?" Seamus said, laughing.
Draco Malfoy,
Ron was following their banter, looking confused and slightly frightened.

She walked up to the carriages, her head still reeling. Every part of her screamed to find Luna— even without a face to put to the name. Even with the danger. Even with the Dark Lord looming.
Her hands are soft on her face, and her lips are gentle and seeking, and Pansy trembles as she wraps her arms around her, warm and soft, and never close enough. She always feels safe with Luna, but all she feels now is anxiety. She clings to her and tangles her hand in her hair, quiet and desperate to hold on. Luna moves to look her in the eyes.
Harry is silent, and he stares at his hands, fiddling with his fingers. “I found it in a potions’ book. I didn’t think, I was just so
"I don't know how to help him," Pansy says.
“I wish we would have come together,” Luna says softly.

, she writes, and she means it. She's sure this time.
Draco gnaws at his lip and fidgets, muttering a stunted 'thank you' under his breath. The room doesn't respond, naturally, so he settles into the chair and sips his tea. He wishes he had brought his book, or perhaps a foot of parchment so he could finish his analysis of transanimal transfiguration processes for McGonagall, but when he turns to look out the window, he sees a small bookshelf off to the side, stuffed full of paperback novels. He glances at the door worriedly, remembering the room's purpose, and hexes the doorway for good measure. No one should be able to get in but himself, but he doesn't want to take chances, especially when the stakes are so high.
"Is he okay?" Harry blurted. No one answered.
In this chapter I:
"A bond usually settles about fifteen days after completion."
Harry shrugged. "What else are we supposed to do?"
"It's not like I'm sucking you off or something," Draco pointed out.
"I swear I'll hex your lips shut if you don't get out." Draco said calmly. Mauve scurried through the door, glancing back to see Draco with his wand raised. "She's no Rita Skeeter," he said after she had gone. "And you're no good with the press."
Just like the Dark Lord would take his.
"I was afraid you'd never find me," Luna mumbles.
“Draco?”

He moans and swallows. "I
All my love.
“Harry wouldn’t-“ She stops, her eyes drawn to his bloodied robe, she circles and faces him, wand still pointed at him. “Is that blood?”
Draco watches Harry's cheeks flush, and he turns back to the desk. There's a light clack on the table and looks over to see a ruler on the table. "Could you throw that to me?" Harry asks.
his room too, so he finally raised a reluctant hand to knock on the door, pushing it open. Potter turned from his trunk at the foot of the bed on the left, taking a sudden step back.
"Quit."
"Really? I thought you would."
“You’re not going anywhere,” Draco promises, and he opens the door to the third room. He still can barely see through the darkness, but he can just barely make out the shape of one of the beds by the window.
Pansy leans against the wall, watching Draco pull and prod at the collar of his robes.

"Could we speak alone," Harry sputtered.
"Step aside." Parkinson demanded, eyes fixed on Draco
Eventually, Harry’s eyes open, and he flinches back from Draco’s hand, painfully, and stares at him from below. He bends his arms, hissing at the strain, and looks away from Draco, pulling up the bedsheets over his arms. His fingers tangle in the sheets, and Draco shifts in the chair, eyes fixed on the ground.
his fault. Harry sighed.
I was wondering if any of you lovelies would like to see other things I've created for this fic, character boards and the like. I really want to get more involved with you guys, maybe you can bully me into working on this more often.
"I'm going!" Draco sputtered. Draco's gray eyes were bright and anxious in the afternoon light, his hair like a halo atop his head. The Slytherins watched Draco's receding figure, and with every step he took he could feel the eyes of his friends on his back. He looked straight ahead, trying to ignore it, even after his eyes met that of a certain brown haired boy. Draco's innards flipped and his hands shook. How was he going to do this?
He needs someone. He's not safe and he knows it. The night before still looms in his mind, a reminder that today could never have come at all.
“I love you,” Pansy says. “Please remember that.”
"Voldemort," Draco whispers, and fear claws at his chest. He's waiting for the rush of wind that brings a Death Eater in its wake, the bright burning of the mark on his arm, but nothing comes.
"Are you?"
He sees the edges of the bandages on Draco’s wrists and he drops his arm almost as an afterthought.
to say something- instead, he fiddles with the edges of his sleeves.
"What?"
There’s a dry heat burning at the back of his throat, and he swallows.

wants to.
This couldn't be happening.
entertaining the image of Draco's white-blond hair mussed and fanned across the emerald pillows on the couches.
That boy doesn’t want him. He never has. He never will.
Their last meeting was more somber than she would have thought, their hands clutching one another’s in the dark of the broom closet, rehearsing kind memories of when they were both in bloom. Draco had led them to serve the new headmaster, to seek out those who worked against her, and in the name of Albus. It was too dangerous for them to meet.
, he thinks. Harry pauses by the fireplace and turns back to look at him and Draco immediately looks back down at his book.
A few seconds later, the door rattles, and he jumps up from his chair and grabs his wand,
“Thank you,” Draco says. Hermione nodded warily in response. He waited a moment before speaking again, anxious to break the silence of the room. “Did you know that he did this?”
Harry's hand slides up to the back of Draco's neck and his fingers push into his hair. Goosebumps raise on his neck and down his arms.
"I lived with my cousin," Harry mumbled. "He was almost like a brother." But terrible.
Luna smiles sweetly, like she always does, and walks to her slowly, raising a hand to brush back Pansy’s hair from her face. Pansy can smell the dried flowers woven into her hair.
"And I don't really particularly care what they think," said Draco.
Across the great hall, Pansy's hand curled into a fist as she felt the familiar tickle of writing on her arm. She fought against raising her sleeve to look at what Luna had said. She glances up, looks for Luna, though she doesn't even know her face. She doesn't see Luna's eyes on her, or how she bites her lip. She doesn't know the incandescence she sees surrounding Pansy, or how the air almost contorts around her.
"He sucks the cock of someone twice his age?" Harry says flatly. He watches Draco's face turn nearly purple and stifles a laugh.
It was almost like Harry was speaking just behind his ear. “Can you tell me where she is?”
He was hollow and sick, and his arm felt heavy with its new marking.
"It's ours," Draco replied. He shot a weary glance to the open space beside Harry. "Do you mind-?" Draco motioned vaguely to the spot.
The room slips back into silence again, and Hermione follows his gaze, looking over at Harry. “I don’t think he’s going to want to see me when he wakes up.”
—————
"What the fuck are you getting at?" Draco sneers. "You think this was my
"What about the whole blood-purity issue?"
Harry hisses as he runs his fingers over the raised skin at his shoulder, the brush of them calming the skin beneath. "Lucky for you that the bond doesn't transfer magical wounds, huh?" Harry snorts. Draco's face falls and his hands fall to twist at his sides, tense with the burning thought of sectumsempra still fresh in his mind. The new scars on his chest itch and he tries to steel himself. His face goes blank, but he's too late, Harry's frowning at him. "What's-" There's a long moment and Harry bites his lip. "Right, whoops."
Harry finds the script just below the flowers, about an hour later.
"I am happy," Draco said, and it was true.

is Harry glad it is, he must be rubbish at kissing because Merlin no one else ever felt this good. Harry was frozen under Draco's ministrations till the boy rolled his lower lip into his mouth and bit down, hard. Harry sucked in a breath, pushing back, hearing Draco make a small sound of approval. Draco twisted a black curl between his fingers, breath like fire as he forced himself closer to Harry.
"Lose what?"
Draco passes the first and second door, and then steps past a bathroom. He’s shaky, and he can’t imagine what he’s going to say to Granger when he does find her. Harry goes silent again, and Draco takes a deep breath.
"Soul-bonding? The three gifts? It's very romantic."
"A wedding? With the cake and the white mess?" Draco asked. "I won't wear white, it makes me look terribly pale."
“…Granger?” he whispers. He hopes most of the students are gone for the holiday. “Hermione?” He takes a step into the room and the old floorboards creak under his feet. He suddenly feels a wand digging into his ribs.
“That was fucking stupid.”
"Is anyone opposed? Anyone at all?" she asked.
Pansy thinks.
Biology. That's all that was between Harry and himself.
"It's not hurting you, is it?" Harry asked. "I still don't know how this whole bond thing works."
"It's beautifully made. But I don't speak Latin."
Harry winced at the memory. "But your mother—"
"What about him, mate?" Ron asked.
"It's just how they were."
The closer he gets to Gryffindor tower, the more panic burns in his chest. His fingers shake on the banister of the staircase, and he nearly trips over the steps as his pace quickens. The blood begins to leak through the material of the dressing gown, dripping down his wrists.
"What is it?"
"Stop," Harry warned.
Draco Malfoy was well and truly
And then there was
“I don’t want to go,” he says.
“Pansy,” she hears.
Ron mumbled something under his breath, prickling like an owl delivering spam mail, and Hermione stared at them for a moment with wide eyes before sighing.
"Why can't you just Accio it?"
"I'm sure you can discuss the more intimate details at a later date."
"Please, you're not eight stone wet."
something whispers.

"As your room shows," said Draco. Seamus scoffed and shot an accusatory look at Harry, who shrugged.
Draco frowned at his mother's stressed expression, and the smile that didn't reach her eyes. He rolled his sleeve back down.
," said Ron defensively.
- to ground himself. Someone shuffles outside the bathroom, brings their fist against the locked door.
"Does he love Harry?"
"But they're my mates."
..............
"How's he feeling? You probably shouldn't be apart for long," said Hermione.
"Potter."
"You're not going to complete the bond, are you?" Draco said, his fingers trembling. Harry felt a twinge of pain in his chest, a tightness he couldn't ignore. "You're going to make me lose it, aren't you?"
“I know Gryffindors aren’t the smartest bunch, but I thought you knew I didn’t want you dead.”
And then Draco hears a spell he's never heard before.
"Draco," Harry urged.
As always, I love you all and thank you for reading.
But this. The future he thought they could have had. Them, together, an echo of domesticity that poisons his dreams, anything they could be always plagued by what they were.
"He tried to kill you!" Ron insisted, voice lowered.
"McGonagall teaches Transfiguration, and I'm not overly fond of your Head of House."
"No, you're fine. Good, actually."
“I’ll still write to you.”
"Do you feel okay?"
“I can’t do this,” she whispers, and her voice is soft and pleading. “I love you, but I can’t do this. Not now.” She strokes Pansy’s hair out of her face.
"I mean that not being with you kills me more than being with you, and if you don't want this, I understand," Draco mumbled.
She huffs and stalks over to him, taking his hand. “Hold still, I’ll fix it.” Pansy unbuttons his left cuff, straightening the sleeve. Her fingers move quickly over the plush fabric, but not quick enough for her to miss the curling black lines underneath the cloth. She glances up at Draco, studying his face incredulously. “No fucking way.” She moves to pull up his sleeve, and Draco flinches back.
She imagines it tastes something like freedom, like autonomy, like everything she’s wanted for so many years, and right now it looks like Luna. Her wild white-blond hair and the flowers and ribbon she weaves into it. Her small, warm hands, and the way she smiles when Pansy meets her eyes.
"When-" he starts, and then bites his tongue.
____________
"He doesn't know we're here," Draco whispered, breath hot on Harry's ear.
"I know," she said quietly, glancing at her nails.
Lucius led Draco back to their table, and he beckoned a house elf from the wall where they all stood. The elf poured their drinks as another placed their soup in front of each of them, careful not to shake the bowls.
She shifts away, her hand on the door. Pansy closes her eyes, and when she opens them, she’s gone.
And with them, Harry was no longer the Boy Who Lived.
"Ok," he says. "Ok."
Harry shrugged. "I'm pretty sure we learned it in Transfiguration at some point."
This is exactly the kind of place she hates to be. The bright lights, the magic buzzing in the air, and drama in the bathrooms. The way they all dress up, pretending that pretty clothes could make them pretty people, the same shit over and over, the one thing she thought she could come to Hogwarts to escape.
When Draco's face touched the coolness of the pensieve, images began to materialize before his eyes. He saw himself sitting with his head leaned against the wall of the kitchen, frowning, but with an uncharacteristic lightness in his face he had never seen before. It was so strange to see yourself through someone else's eyes.
"I saved your life! And when
Then came 31st August, when Potter stepped onto Platform 9 ¾ a day early, all smiles at the reporters vying for an exposé, who snapped photos and sputtered questions while shoving through the crowd. Draco assumed someone had finally taught him proper conduct, as he watched Potter turn to wave at a reporter on the front of the Prophet. There was no clear explanation, no interview, just the photos and McGonagall's declaration at the welcome feast that the eighth years would be "expected to protect one another's privacy," before dismissing them before the rest of the school.
Draco yawned and shoved his head further into the curve of Harry's neck as they shuffled down the hallway in the silence. Draco could feel Harry's voice rumble when he said 'This is it', just before he was gently lowered from his back. Harry took his hand and led him toward a covered stairway just ahead.
" He yanks up his own sleeve, three perfect plum scars surrounded by every aspect of the Milky Way he knows, and at the crook of his arm, flowers, crude and poorly drawn. Flowers for Harry's soulmate. "
/He can't die without knowing I love him./
Harry sleeps through breakfast and well into the time for lunch, and Draco sways in his chair, dark circles like bruises under each eye, still unwilling to leave him. At least he could do this for him. He had to.
Harry hums and flips the page, shrugging and leaning toward him. "What did you think was going to happen?"
Harry paused.
"Dizzy," Draco said, and fell forward onto Harry.
Biology, and now a freakishly large snake.
Even with the heat, Draco can’t find the will to pull away.
"Would you like a moment, Draco?" said Narcissa.
"Draco," Harry says.
). Her breath shakes, because how can just touching a person make her feel this way— complete and calm? Luna draws back to look at her, and her eyes are a misty blue she's never seen, but she wants to know.
Harry tensed at the few chuckles that followed.
"It's tradition."
And that boy. The boy he can’t have, rotted and filled with intentions not his own, who hid this from him for years, years after he knew who Harry was-
Draco felt warmth slowly filling his chest. Harry wanted him.
"I wish you would have told me. About the soul thing."
Luna’s fingers card through her hair, coming to rest on her shoulder.
Harry shakes his head weakly, his hand tightening ever so slightly on Draco’s wrist. “Please, no.”
"The boy who lived, always getting me in trouble."
Thanks for the encouragement! I hope you enjoy the chapter, hopefully no one is too OOC!
His hand stills. He doesn’t know what to write.

Draco ignores the marks for as long as he can, but one night he wakes up with his arm stinging and the metallic taste of blood in his mouth. He sees the red seeping through the light fabric of his nightshirt, pulls it up before it can get much worse. There, among the jotted notes, stars, and drawings is a straight red line, blood ebbing along the break. Draco slips out of bed and sits at his desk, taking out his older quill and writes neatly,
A voice said.
Snape stands and shoves the chair back, robes billowing. He turns, and Draco sighs under his breath. "Thank you," he says, rather loudly. Snape pauses, and Draco squeezes his eyes shut. "For healing me."
"Okay," Ron said awkwardly. "I'm a bit rubbish, but I can make the basics."
“Why aren’t mine as deep as his?” he asks, quietly.
up to me and then
She’s fading, fading, and Luna can’t see her anymore. The light that follows her, the magic. Can’t help her. Can’t reach her.
And Harry has
"I don't hate you," Harry said softly. Draco swayed, his feet slipping. Harry steadied him, Draco's eyes finally meeting his, glassy. "Are you
"You should really talk about this with Draco," she mused.
"No," Lucius huffed, not bothering to meet the eyes of the servant. Draco lifted his spoon and began to eat before hearing his father clear his throat. "Your napkin, Draco."
"You can stay in here till I figure out how to smuggle you out of here, but I'm not sure when the rest of the guys will be back."
,” he mumbles, and his voice wavers. He can only hear their breathing now, loud in spite of the low buzzing in his ears. “If we do this. If we- I don’t think I can-“
How could he tell him the truth? That the boy he thinks he loves is the one he hates? The one that mocks him in the hallways, spits words like acid, while the ones he wishes to speak rot in his mouth.
"Of course, you tit."
"Potter?!" he shouts, just as Harry's shoulder is hit with a strong Whipping Hex. "What the fuck are you doing here?"
"What does he fear? Regret? Just think harder, you'll figure something out. You always do."
that much." Guilt crawls into his chest, pushing against his lungs to make room for itself. His mouth tastes foul.
Harry is quiet, and his fingers loosen before they tighten again. “Don’t make me say it,” he says, low.
"Was Master Malfoy needing anything else?" asked the elf.
/I want to hate you,/ Draco thinks. /It's true. Am I somehow missing any semblance of self-preservation? He’s going to destroy me and I can’t stop it- I’m not sure I would./
, Harry thinks, but he can’t ask for that.
"Took you quite awhile to get here," Draco mumbled.
Certainty that what he wanted was what Harry wanted too.
I have no excuse for being gone for so long... nor why I have so much written for way later in this work (or a sequel? yikes). No excuse for the 2000 words I have written for hanahaki disease for these too (look out for that appearing maybe, I'm a shit, I know).
"Why?"
Footsteps came from the hall. "Mr. Malfoy? Is everything alright?"
Harry groans from the ground, clutching his chest, and Draco approaches cautiously, readying for his reaction. "I come here to think you poncy git!" he yells. "Why are
Luna writes
Harry moaned. "Not fair," he mumbled. Draco smirked, and Harry rolled them over, pressing him into the ground. He arched over the blonde, savoring his scowl.
When Draco first sees Harry, the sight sends something between an electric pulse and a tremor of fear through his body. A few days later he feels it. A light pressure on his arm that he knows is from the scratch of a pen.
"He may not be evil, but he's still a tit!"
"We should wait for Hermione," Harry said slowly.
"Can't I stay?" Draco asked, yawning.
He sees Snape's jaw set out of the corner of his eye, in the same way it does when Harry turns a warming draught into an instant-darkness powder, somehow not noticing the color change and stirring his cauldron anyway, all while Granger was in the lavatory. Snape's lip curls and sets the bottle on the corner of his side table, turned so the label clearly faces Draco.
Draco clenches his teeth and watches him roll about on the floor, his arms crossed. After a moment or two, Harry sits up, hands shaking to hold himself steady. Draco sighs, offers a hand, and yanks him up from the floor.
Pansy shakes her head and buries it in the crook of Luna’s neck. “I’m so sorry,” she whispers. “I’ll find you, after all of this.”
Okay... I know this chapter is heavy as hell, but it just had to be done. Please don't murder me.
Draco's eyes dart up to meet Harry's and then back down at his book. "It's no business of yours!"
"It's not really, Harry said, uncomfortable.
Everything, always too much, always closing in, and he can not be what they need him to be. He’s pitiful, he knows, and for the first time he tastes a hint of bloodlust, sees the appeal of pain, the gnawing urge to make something internal, external.
"Did you-uh-get a hangover potion from Snape or something?" Harry stuttered.
“Excuse you, I look amazing. It’s not my fault I didn’t have time for finishing touches.”
?” Her voice carries venom, but not enough to scare him back.
"That's one of the books from the shelf isn't it?" Harry grins wildly and laughs. "I can't believe you're still reading! You must have noticed-"
“And I, have lost your face,” Harry breathes, cut by a stuttering breath. “It slips between my fingers now.”
"You won't have a choice for much longer. Better to start early. I don't want to see you or Mr. Potter in here again."
There’s a hand on his arm, pulling him toward the doorway, and Harry’s fingers press into his arm, gently. Draco looks up at him, and Harry doesn’t meet his eyes. “What are you doing?” Draco mutters.
"Soulmates?" says Hermione.
He writes
He sinks further into the chair and rolls his eyes, and Harry slumps onto the couch opposite. "Aren't you supposed to be mad at me?" Draco mumbles, and pulls his sweater across his chest. The fire crackles between them and a log shifts and falls.
"I need time if you're going to call this off. I have to get stronger, have to build up the piece I'll lose-"
Draco drops his eyes dug his nails into his thigh under the sheets. “Dark magic leaves scars.” Not exactly a lie, but not the truth either. It could still be healed- If he wanted it to be.
"Popular place to hide, isn't it?" Draco asked. Harry looked up.
“It’s like a sick joke.”
All my love.
“I’m going to run to the bathroom,” she tells Draco. He nods at her, his eyes narrowing.
Tears slip from her eyes and she wipes them away, cursing under her breath and pulling her knees closer to her. "There's a lot. There's been a lot."
"Luna?" Pansy asks, and feels
Draco shrugged. "It's more of an annoyance than a pain. It'll be better once the bond settles a bit."He paused, gauging Harry's expression. "If it's completed, that is."
__________
"Lemme touch it."
"I'm not going to break the bond with Draco," Harry insisted. "I'm preparing to finish it, and I promise I'll do it soon."
all my love,
"Perhaps we can reconvene after dinner in order for Draco and Pansy to spend some additional time together?" Lucius offered.
P.S. : Some of you asked if I have a tumblr, and I would love to share more of the boys (and the girls!) with you guys! Moodboards, snippets, photos and such will be shared on there if enough people are interested in it. My tumblr user is aduare !  Message me and tell me how you found me if you do!
Hermione glowered at him, and Seamus's brows raised, but he fell quiet.
The wind blows harsh against their faces, but the warming charm does its job, the trees sway and the willow on the hill creaks over the sound of the animals in the brush.
"Is that the danger?"
Pansy hopes Luna will accept her as she is.
"And you meant it." It's not a question.
Mr. Parkinson must have nodded, but Draco was too busy watching the girl rubbing at her wrist to see it.
"Do you like it?"
And then a moment later
Hey guys!
There's nothing for a moment, and Pansy's stomach rolls and nearly drops. She needs this, needs Luna more than she ever thought possible. She has so many questions- does she know about Harry and Draco? Could she help them? Could they help them, and would that mean that they could be together, too? She misses the faint smell of herbs in Luna's hair, the enchanted flowers that were always in bloom, the gold flecks on her eyelids, her hair tangled over her shoulders, looping and twisting like the seaweed washed up on the shore.
Luna gets lost in the floating candles of the ceiling, the grand speeches of the headmaster, and the flood of students headed back to their respective houses, but by the time she reaches her dorm she feels Pansy writing back. She opens her trunk and takes out her mother's quilt, and her brand new self-inking quill. She spreads the quilt over the bed before sitting down and rolling up her sleeve apprehensively, quilt in hand.
He loves him. He’s known it for so long- but this should change things. And yet.
always
"Harry, mate! You around?" Ron yelled.
"I wish you would've told me sooner, you were alone all morning, weren't you?"
4. Remind you again to take care of yourselves and to please heed trigger warnings.
—" The sound of his name on Harry's lips filled Draco with more warmth then a hundred warming charms. He took hold of that feeling, and bowed to the green eyed boy.
Harry's Moodboard, includes some blood, TW!
His nails rake at his palms as Draco refuses to meet his eyes, and his arms tense at his sides. “But I
Harry commanded himself. His hand shook as he placed it on Draco's, eyes squinting as if their sudden joining might cause a massive explosion.
. He shies away from the shirtless men and fainting damsels and squats down to look at the bottom shelf.
"Tit? Twat."
. A log collapses into the fire and Draco's fingers clench on Harry's shoulder, just as he startles back.
Harry paused and sighed, adjusting so he could sit at the head of the bed with Draco. Draco grabbed his hand, moaning at the initial contact. Harry felt blood rush into his cheeks, as well as a stirring in his stomach at the sound.
"I'm going to complete the bond," Harry said urgently. "As soon as I can."
Well, excuse my French, but we really are in this b*tch now... I think you'll all be surprised by how cheery the next little section I have to post is. (Please look out for it, I had to spilt this chapter into two because it was so long, I know right- you think I'm lying)
He does resent him, to an extent. He resents Harry's apparent
not the kind of people who can be with people like them.”
Pansy was quiet, and her mother picked up her knife and began working again.
"No further questions, we are entitled to our privacy," said Draco.
Hermione, sitting with her arms crossed in front of her on the couch, stood and sighed, hands quickly moving to her hips.
I love all of you so much!
, something says, and he scowls. Draco stares into the bathroom mirror, foggy with the remnants of steam from the baths. He had washed the new wound well, cleaned it of blood and bandaged it tight under the towel around his waist. It didn't make him feel any better.
"You've seen one before?"
Could Draco?
(See the end of the chapter for
“You can’t tell anyone,” he says, panicked. “You can’t. I love him Pansy,
Harry thinks he may be going crazy. He dreams of dark, skeletal horses, and a boy with fair hair that never faces him. The dreams, however, are the least of it. Weird things have started following him around, and now words were appearing on his arms. Harry wanted to believe someone was speaking to him,
, about him, and the feeling of hope blooming in his chest sickened him. That hope had no reason to be there— it was just another cruelty seemingly offered out of benevolence. He felt it in every part of him. He had no name, no face to put the words to. His
His chest warms and the air seems thin. He wants to say he hates the sound of his name from Harry's mouth. He really,
Harry felt sick. Was Draco going to die because of him? Because he had said yes? Just because he didn't know what he was getting himself into? His heart beat faster in his chest.
"I don't know how to help you. I don't know if you want me to try."
"I've been looking everywhere for you," Harry said, standing. "I heard they threatened to curse you!"
"Don't," he huffs. He turns to him, his eyes still low. "Just stop."
“But what happens when someone wins?”
It was when people didn't believe the news, however, that things went batty.
"You're following me," he says plainly.
“And a-all the world is gray, you took the colors with you-“ Harry chokes out a sob, and his voice dissolves into heavy breathing again.
"What can I do to keep him feeling all right until I can complete it?"
Messy print, but an answer all the same.
Thanks for putting up with me!
His eyes flick away and panic curls in his lungs. "Fuck," he says. He turns suddenly and sits upright in the chair and a hand touches his shoulder, just barely, and he stands.
His father bought him a new waistcoat for the event, gray with silver stitching, that matched perfectly with the silver vest he received for his last birthday. The day of the gala arrived, and after flooing to a large room Draco had never seen before, they were seated for dinner. Lucius craned his neck, watching for someone in the well-dressed crowd. Draco saw his father smile and greet a large man, followed by a medium-sized girl with jet black hair. She wore a short-sleeved green dress, and an alarming number of loud golden bracelets on her left wrist. She rubbed at them nervously, eyes cast downward.
Pansy proved to be much more—not
Harry walks by him and Draco eyes him leerily. He can't ask him to leave, it'll just cause a fight and it could draw attention.
Harry looks up from his parchment and grins at him through his reflection in the window. When he finally lifts his quill again,
“His are worse than mine.
"I just— I didn't want you to be afraid of this because of that."
Lucius turned and found Mr. Parkinson standing where he had not long ago. "We're just finishing up here, I apologize for my sons behavior." Lucius let go of Draco's arm, now angry and red with black marks unfaded, resting his wet hands on the countertop.
"Well, I suppose I do." The crowd of students that had formed around them murmured to each other, watching as Harry stood and Draco straightened. "Could we get a minute alone?"
Luna smiles sadly, her fingers playing with Pansy’s hair. “I hope you do.”
"You don't want children?" Harry asked, timidly. His hand paused on Draco's head.
"What," Draco mumbles. He's really rather busy after all, with the stupid romance novel, and all that.
"You shouldn't draw on yourself Draco, you have plenty of parchment for that," She offered a strained smile.
It hurts, he’s been hollowed out and his insides ache, something feels absent. Something feels wrong.
"Bonding with Malfoy?" Ron asked loudly.
"What do you mean?"
"Merlin," he said, finally smiling. "Why didn't you say so?"
"I'm good," she replies. Luna opens her hands and shakes the firefly onto a leaf, still smiling wistfully across the lake. She hums and Pansy's fingers tremble.
Her mother shook her head. "I wasn't marked."
There’s a pang in his chest.
The pressure of being a Champion is getting to Harry.
"What," he says suddenly.
Draco opens his eyes and sees Snape nod shortly. "Since you're feeling so well, I'd like two feet on the process of brewing pepper-up potion before noon, where you'll take the practicum with the rest of the class."
Draco was still above him suddenly, frozen at his words. Harry heard him sniffle before he drew back, looking at him with his big gray eyes. He rested his fingers on Harry's shoulder, struggling to maintain eye contact.
“It’s not as if we were technically
"You should have gotten Pomfrey."
Draco chewed at the inside of his cheek, taking a deep breath through his nose
Draco stares out the window and watches the snow drifting slowly down from the sky blatantly ignoring the green eyes burning a hole through the side of his head.
Harry looked at him curiously, eyes focused on his.
"I hate you," Draco says, focused on the smug expression that was on Harry's face in Potions today. His stupid unkempt hair. The scar that lie under it. The scars on both of their arms. "I hate you," he says again. The green of his eyes. His ridiculously thick glasses. "I do." It's a lie, and he knows it will always likely be, no matter how many times he says it.
"Bugger," Harry mumbled, eyes fixed on Draco's pale feet. "Do you know the transfiguration spell?"
"Just give me a minute to find my cloak, and then I'll get you out of here." Harry rooted through his trunk, looking for the gossamer cloth. He dug through his winter garments and tossed them out by the handful, a growing pile of red and gold at his knees. "Draco, I think this'll do," Harry said, rising from his knees, the iridescent material clutched in his arms. "We can both fit under it. I'll walk you to the dungeons and come back."
Harry slipped down between the sheets and placed his head on his pillow, facing away from the other boy. They were both silent for a moment before Draco slipped down beside him, whispering in his ear and causing goosebumps to raise on his arms.
"What do you want, Potter? I came here to be alone."
, and there was no way to reverse it. There was no other way, no other choice. Not that he would have chosen Draco if he had one.
I'd just like to highlight that self-harm does not always equate to suicidal behavior, and often self-harm is used to avoid behavior that could be considered suicidal. The depictions of mental illness and deleterious coping mechanisms and behaviors I include in this work are based off of my personal experience and little else.
"I'll have Tuesday," Dean replied.
reaching
, his mind argued. "It's not that I don't want to-"
"It would be very painful for everyone involved in the bond. It would be," Hermione paused. "A huge trauma."
"Why don't I feel like that? Is it because I'm not bonded to you yet?"
“We’re in his house, I think we’re entitled,” She smirks, watching Draco roll his eyes and smooth back his hair, still ignoring the buttons.
He slips the rest of the way out of bed, kicking off the sheets still tangled around his sheets. Harry’s face is buried between the pillows, his grey shirt pushed up to his chest. Dark hair trails from his stomach down to the waistband of his boxers-
"Oh," he said. "It's you."
"I'm asking you on a date, Potter."
Suddenly, no one's looking at him; and they were much more interested in their feet, or the fireplace, or Draco's open copy of
he writes, pressing the quill much too hard into his arm.
"I know," he said.
"Shut up!" He hissed.
Luna shakes her head, bringing her hand to cradle Pansy’s face. She leans her forehead against Pansy’s, reaching for the hand that lies wrinkling the material of her dress and placing it on her waist. After a moment, in the quiet drone of the music from the ballroom, Luna begins swaying them back and forward.
Seamus grinned, trying to catch the eye of someone else in the group and failing. "Shouldn't we just enjoy it while it lasts, then?"
Draco stared at the messy lettering. What was he supposed to say to that?
"You don't have much time," said Hermione.
Hermione stood at his left, arms clutching a pile of books and papers for Draco. She lingered awkwardly off his shoulder, anxious for the interaction to come. Hermione took a deep breath. "For goodness sake Harry!" She said, exasperated.
"Of course not."
Draco snuggled into the crook of his neck, sighing slow. His palm lied open on his thigh, as if waiting for Harry's hand to join it.
He wakes around four in the morning to Harry pushing him off the bed accompanied by the sheets, and really that’s fine, because while he catches himself on the edge of the mattress just before he falls, he realizes exactly what he’s done. Sleeping with the enemy. Literally. Not even in the fun way. He spent the night cuddling Harry Potter and now he can float back down to earth and admit the mistake he’s made-
"I'll check and owl you first thing tomorrow," he said. "Style and color are not among his very few strengths."
"But I didn't draw them—" Draco started, and his mother's hand touched his own.
Thanks for being so patient.
When he opened the closet, he picked the left side to hang his robes, taking out a fistful of hangers to use for the clothes on his bed. When he turned, he almost smacked into Harry, who had an armful of things to take into the bathroom.
Draco’s heart aches, the words feel like they’re opening his wounds again.
"Harry?" Hermione asked. "Why are you laughing?"
"Ready?" Pomfrey asked. Draco nodded dimly. Pomfrey went through the motions, checking his heart rate, reflexes, and breathing. Draco sighed as she took her wand from where she had set it on the bedside table. "If you could just cast a simple spell so we can check that everything is working properly, I'd appreciate it. Any spell you know wandlessly is fine."
They’re silent, for another moment, until Pansy lifts her head. She wishes this moment would last forever.
" Draco sputters.
There's a twinge of something painful in his chest. For Harry to care that much about him made Draco remember just how painful it would be when he found out who he was.
Their pasts will never just be. There has been too much blood spilled between them, too little distance between comfort and harm.
"Don't worry," she says. "We'll do it together."
The rating goes up in this chapter not for smut, but because of some heavy description of self-harm. I’m not trying to be disgusting, and it is absolutely not gore, but as someone who has a lot of experience with it, it’s important to me that people understand the reality of it.
Harry’s breath is hot on his neck, and one of his curls is tickling his cheek. His hands are clawing at the front of his shirt again, and where his fingers press there’s a pang in his chest. He wants this. Fuck does he want this. If they weren’t fated to be enemies- if he could love Harry without risking his life- if this wouldn’t shatter him and wound Harry when the pieces fell.
Draco doesn't answer. Can't. The panic still coils in his stomach, burning, and his chest won't expand. He drops the quill on to the counter and his fingers shake as he holds the ledge of the sink tight in his hand, trying to do something,
"It's fine. Just maybe try not to take offense to everything I say?" Draco sighed. Harry's eyebrows knit in concern.
He thinks, and Harry bites his lip, and all at once Draco is struck by the need to
He struggles not to roll his eyes and instead closes them. "Of course, professor."
But Draco saw him, the haunted look in his eye, felt the overwhelming nausea when the true name of the Dark Lord echoed through the stands of spectators. He knew the truth, and he knew the overwhelming helplessness that came with the headlines of the "tragic accident" that had occurred during the Triwizard Tournament. He knew Harry was telling the truth, and there was no way Draco could tell him he believed him. Draco's hands are trembling by the time he lifts a pen back to his arm.
Where the strand touched the water it turned black, dripping thick into the bowl like ink. "So I just—" Draco started, his head nearing the surface of the pensieve. Harry nodded, his chest tight.
me out in the open, and then behind closed doors you what?
As he flips through the novel he sinks further into his chair, his cheeks warming just slightly. He's no blushing bride, but the captain was so vivid… and then that thing… with the rope… He shifts in his chair, trying to ignore the warmth in his cheeks.
The dreams might not be real, but the fear it inspired certainly was.
"You're so daft."
"Hey," he said. "I'm not. Not a virgin." Harry felt his stomach drop.
“He never told us he had a soulmate, let alone that it was you.”
,” He mumbles.
"Oh, is it?" Draco said, taking his shrunken luggage out of his pocket just for something to do. "Thanks for letting me know."
Naturally, the thing he's most nervous about. Harry thought, his mind helpfully offering memories of Draco asking 'Have you changed your mind?' and 'I feel like you're going to leave me.'. If he could give anything to Draco, he would want to give him certainty.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry nodded, fingers running over the material. He folded it and placed in the corner of the small box, picking up the second gift. "Thank you," he said. "It means a lot."
Harry looked up to see Draco staring at him, gray eyes alight with something like fire. His pink lips parted and then closed again, long lashes batting against pale cheeks. Harry felt a pang of something unfamiliar in his chest, something completely different then what he had felt before.
Harry knew Ron would give him that wide-eyed look he gave spiders, his mouth curling under, intensely disgusted by the thought of things that might of (
No words could be truer, but nothing could make them feel less dangerous.
Luna smiles and reaches out to her, hand suspended in the wintry air.
"Here's the deal," Hermione said. "We may not all be friends, but we have one thing in common: we're sort-of famous." She spared a glance at Harry and pursed her lips. "Some more than others."
“Oh fuck, I-“ Harry stops and takes a step back, his eyes widening in clear panic.
"Harry," Draco said, jolting from his position.
"There's things you can't understand without the bond- everything's just more, and when we're doing- this type or thing- I don't want to be alone in feeling that."
"Malfoy?" Harry mumbled, his eyebrows raised.
"Did you remember to do the Transfiguration homework last night?" Ron asked.
—————
"I do hope this all works out," Narcissa replied.
"Draco-" Harry started.
There’s a sense of relief at the word.
"Forgot I made a fool of myself?" Draco sneered.
"Merlin, could you be any more tense?"
"What-" Draco started, and Harry placed his lips on his jaw.
"Such a softy," Draco scoffed, and shifted over so he was half laying on Harry's chest.
"Wingardium Leviosa," Draco murmured, lifting the cup placed beside him. Pomfrey waved her wand, quickly and wordlessly ending the spell.
Harry grips his hand in his sleep, waking only to look around in panic before passing out again. Draco stares at his twitching fingers, his messy curls, his eyes finally falling to the blood-soaked bandages on his wrist, and it hurts.
. If you're not here and not in the dungeon, then where have you been?" Snape frowns, tapping his fingers on his bag.
The blood tastes like rust, and he sees his father's arm rear back to strike him, hears the spraying water of the broken sink, and he is being eaten away— the rotting wood of the manor; the maggots on the bird—
"Does it involve breaking the school rules?"
"Harry, it's time I tell you: the bond-" Draco started.
wanted to throw all that away, I did it again." He claws at his arm absentmindedly, and his body shakes with each breath. "Why else would I… why would I…" he glances down at his arm and pulls his hand back cautiously. His heart is racing, burning in his chest, and
The room numbers were gilded on the dark wood doors, the names of their occupants scrawled underneath in small, neat script. As he located room 303 in the back, left-most corner, he found the door already cracked open, and music spilling out quietly from the inside. He stood frozen for a minute, indecisive, but it
Pansy chokes on a laugh, eyes still stinging from before. "Oh, he's sick with it."
The pair ducked through the archway, Ron leading. "I can't believe you made us late aga-" Ron paused at the full common room. "What-?"
This is how you raise a child.
. "My apologies," Draco said, standing. "I'll go clean up."
His lips dragged along Draco's neck, nipping at the pale skin and turning it pink. Harry played with the hem of his shirt, sliding his fingers under his shirt. He sucked at the space behind his ear, fingertips gliding up his chest. Draco pushed him back, cheeks flushed, breath quick. His pupils were swollen, eyes focused on Harry. "You okay?" Harry asked.
His stomach grumbled at the smells wafting from the back of the kitchen.
He shakes his head and pushes past Harry and into the hallway, slamming the door behind him.
"White mess?" Harry echoed, glancing at Draco in confusion. "A wedding dress?"
"It's not exactly material, but it is a gift of sorts."
Harry walks forward, wand drawn. He hears the sobbing, sees the boy's eyes close, his sleeves pulled up to reveal pale arms covered in stars and planets.
“I’m still the same person,” he says, carefully. “Just because you’re seeing me differently doesn’t mean I’m actually any different.”
“We have to talk about this.”
"He wasn't supposed to know," Draco sobbed.
"Shut up, I couldn't think of the word."
Sometimes when he woke, there were new words on his arm, but even when there weren't Harry would write to the boy on the other side of his skin. It was a small comfort, but sometimes it seemed as if he was the only person that felt solid in those moments— the only person Harry could reach out to, even with Ron just feet away. His fingers often itched for a blade the closer the boy got, the aura darkness that surrounded him slowly overcoming him, even within the confines of Harry's mind. Somehow he felt the boy's destruction, he saw his depression, but just couldn't seem to explain it.
He glances down at the novel and snorts, but he retreats to his chair. Curling up with his lanky knees pressed against his chest and his tea balanced between his feet, he opens his book and settles into what's sure to be an incredibly disheartening experience.
"Why would I need to know how to transfigure shoes?"
He’s never felt like this. Like there will be no end. Every sound comes too loud and he doesn’t want to
Harry's just glad he's not as alone as he was.
Every time he faces him, sees the hatred in the eyes that follow him across the room-
Every moment of his life is another fucking reminder that he is the chosen one, meant to change this world tainted by darkest forces, and the boy he loves is one of them. A slave to one of them. He is overcome and empty and he was stupid enough to think that he could have this one thing, untouched by evil, safe, and free of everything he’s grown to hate so much.
Pansy just knows that she's scared.
All my love,
Everything is still, and he’s waiting for Harry to draw back. His lips press promises gently at the corners of Draco's mouth, like he's something fragile, like he's something good, like he's something
"What? No!"
It wouldn’t be right. It wouldn’t be
“Does Luna know?”
Draco takes a breath and a knot unties in his chest, the sense of unease fades from under his ribs, filled with warmth. "Oh," he mumbles. Harry yawns and repositions his book.
stupid because
does, they’ll use it against him. They’ll have to.”
"Did it, because of me."
"Nice place you got here," he says awkwardly.
Generally, Draco's plan was to avoid his roommates until it felt normal. He would establish his space, his chair in the living area where he currently sat, reviewing the first passage of his Advanced Potions book, and fade into the background in a few short weeks.
More coming to this chapter later today/tomorrow.
"O-Okay."
"You have to tell me more than that!"
"How long will that be?"
"No," he said loudly. "That all sounds absolutely fine."
"I don't know what I want," Harry blurted. He thought he saw Draco tremble. "Draco?"
"I thought you'd like to have it."
"I don't know what you want me to say," Draco breathes. "We don't get to have this."
"You're kidding," Draco mumbled. "Magic is always out of control when wizards are kids."
"Man up! Merlin, I'll jump up on the table and tell him myself!" Pansy shouted.
Let me know how you feel about this in the comments please!
he writes, but his fingers itch to know his safety, anxiety growing in the back of his throat like vines. He places the tray on the ground in front of the door, but by the time he rises, their eyes meet, fern green- somehow, he always forgets. His eyes drop and immediately dart to where he can see the edges of the wrappings under the sleeves of his light shirt. His hair is mussed and flat, as if he had just woken up, his eyes still heavy with sleep.
She keeps a journal now— instead of writing it on her arm.
She thought.
Draco leans over his washbasin, scrubbing what he can of the ink from his skin. He dabs around the wound and tries to heal it, to no avail. He guesses it can only be healed from his soulmate's side. He wraps it in a clean cloth and hopes it'll stop throbbing by morning.
"Go talk to him Harry!" She said, settling back into her book.
"Flitwick and Snape have been down there for nearly any hour trying to stop it!" Hermione said.
"It looks so fluffy," Draco moaned.
she reminds herself. Draco leans against the wall of the ballroom in his silver dress robes, his arms crossed across his chest.
"Harry James Potter, I would like to formally declare my intention, to enter into a courtship with you."
His fault.
something nagged).
"No! McGonagall nearly blew the top of the teapot we were transfiguring!"
Harry arrives in the medical wing at half past six, two nights before the end of the winter holiday, and stands outside of the curtains surrounding Draco’s cot. The whole wing smells of herbal remedies with a touch Skele-Gro, making him vaguely nauseous, and he can hear the drag of the ceramic plates from dinner on the standard plastic tray inside. His arms still throbbed under his sleeves. He had hid from Hermione all day, and he had barely convinced himself to walk down just to see
"It's dangerous for
Luna sees her as soon as she steps through the gate, and she cocks her head to one side as she watches Pansy slip to the ground before rising up to stare at a pale-skinned boy with a shock of white blond hair. She sees her eyes searching the groups of students— Searching for her friends? Could she be searching for Luna? She sees Pansy climb into the carriage, sees the thestrals drag it off. She feels like the sun. As soon as she reaches the great hall, she borrows a quill from a student sitting just a bit down the table. She rolls up her sleeve, ignoring the curious looks from her classmates.
about what he did to himself, but Harry was also a rational person. No one was coming to save him, the people in his life had made that abundantly clear. But with each night, the dreams of the boy grew more vivid, though no more words appeared.
There's a note of desperation in his voice and guilt grows in Draco's chest. He chews at the inside of his cheek and places his scone on the arm of the chair, bringing the book to rest in his lap. Silence stretches between them and Draco shoves his feet between the chair cushions.
Draco clenches his teeth together. He can’t roll up his sleeve with all the scars, but he reaches down to button his sleeve and straighten his sleeve. “It’s a boy,” he whispers. “I can’t have him, either.”
Harry rolled his eyes. "Git."
"Pull," Draco said, and Harry complied just slightly. "
Luna finds her on a Tuesday, and something is off. It feels final, and it shakes her to her core.
I hope this development will serve to inspire inter-house cooperation and tolerance.
Pansy’s eyes widen. “Draco… Who is it?”
Harry is quiet, and his fingers loosen before they tighten again. “Don’t make me say it,” he says, low.
Dean Thomas,
He can’t stay silent about the bruises on his arms, echoing his soulmate’s own. He knows those marks. He’s had them before, the dark impressions of fingertips, clutching both of their arms. He so desperately wants to know who hurt him, to protect him, and when he can’t do that, he wants to help him.
"All you need to know for now is that he's serious, and the second gift is from you. It's very important he isn't alone in the bond for long, but before you give him the second gift, you need to be sure of how you feel about him."
"Oh for godsakes," Draco said, pulling Harry's lips down to meet his own.
"He's fine. He passed out during Potions."
______
"Harry?" Draco asked. "You okay?"
"Did you like the second gift as well?"
She takes a breath, and it's almost full this time. It still stutters in her chest, suppressed by the hummingbird flutter of another pulse in her chest.
Silence for a moment before: "I can see the edge of your robes, Harry." said Draco.
"Just like old times, huh?"
Harry thought. And he wasn't wrong, both of them vying for control as if the building pressure between the two of them might overwhelm them both. Harry ran his tongue boldly along the other boy's lower lip, his fingers twisting the silky strands he had been caressing. Draco groaned at the slight pain, eyes opening wide. A twinge of arousal shot through Harry at the sound.
"Then what—?"
"And where would we be doing that?" Draco scoffed.
However, the summer's unexpected
"What's your point, Granger?"
He shuffled to the bathroom, wrapped a bandage from the cabinet around his arm. Looked in the mirror and pushed his white blond hair out of his eyes. He squeezed the edge of the sink, his knuckles white with the force of it.
"Potter, it's nearly noon."
"Are you feeling alright? I totally forgot-"
Blood rushed to Harry's cheeks (
he was making of himself tonight.
Deny deny deny.
? I thought I was the only one in Slytherin!”
“I’m sorry,” Harry says hoarsely. “I didn’t mean to do this.”
"You're falling behind."
, she reminded herself,
, she writes finally,
Draco watched as an invisible quill circled "who are you". Draco took a long breath.
Draco stands and grabs his wand, slipping on a dressing gown and shoving it into his pocket. He shuffles out the door of the hospital wing and pads barefoot across the stone floor, his breath heavy and chest tight with the newly-healed wounds.
"So?"
Draco glances away from him, watching a second-year Hufflepuff (
"Where's that Gryffindor bravery now? We're just kissing."
He took a
Harry shakes his head and wrings his hands. His eyes are like bruises on his face, and his cheeks are too sharp, too white. There’s a silence for a moment, and his hands twitch at the sides.
, no— But it is. Because it always is. Everything Draco is always comes back to him.
Luna was a beautiful name. It reminded Pansy of the moon and stars and everything she missed when she lived in the city during most of the year. She touched the words to her chest, and turned to sigh at the teal dress hanging on the door of her closet. Pansy prayed that Luna would accept her for everything she was— and wasn't.
“I can’t have her,” she mumbles. “Obviously. But I love her. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you.”
"I'm almost glad this happened," she started. "I don't think you realize how harmful a one-sided bond can be."
There's a chill in the room as he writes it, because no matter how much Draco wants to chart the stars and teach Harry their shapes, it's
"Pansy?" Luna asks, (and Pansy immediately loves how her name rolls off her tongue) "I missed you."
He’s supposed to kill a
Draco nodded, waited to hear the click of the bathroom door, dropped the hangers onto his bed, and ran off to find Pansy.
There were no candles, but from the back right corner of the office a bright ethereal light flooded from the open doors of a cabinet and toward them. As they drew closer they could see the slight mist rolling off the edge of a large ornamental bowl.
"Please, go get cleaned up. The guests will be here soon. We'll talk about it later."
Draco hurried through the door and stood, shaking, in the common room.
He’s supposed to kill the headmaster.
"Is a bonding ceremony like a muggle wedding?" asked Harry.
"Hermione, I know important it is, I just don't know what to give him. I can't think of anything that would be— well, enough."
. Harry thought.
A few seconds passed.
He runs.
"She's been down at breakfast for ages by now."
," Luna whispers. The warmth seeps over them, and Luna draws patterns in the sand between their legs.
"There's
Draco sighed and swung his legs to the side of the bed. He ran a hand through his hair, eyes still bleary with sleep. The white pajamas typical to the hospital ward hung limply off his steep shoulders. "I don't have any shoes."

, of course.
Draco's lips fell open, his eyes on focused on Harry's mouth. He leaned toward him almost imperceptibly, Harry unconsciously doing the same. He could feel his breath on his face, just a little faster than it should be, unknowingly mirroring it as they drew closer.
at the outburst, and suddenly Harry was happy for the privacy spell. He leaned against the headboard, avoiding touching Malfoy in any way.
Harry nodded his head, his smile twisting into a grimace. Hermione groaned.
Harry hears the splash of the water on the ground. Snape hovers over Draco, looks Harry straight in the eye, then down to his arm.
They fall into silence for a moment, both of them staunchly refusing to look at the other, until someone’s footsteps echo down the room and pass Draco’s bed. Harry coughs lightly, and tucks his hands into his pockets. “I came here to thank you, not to fight,” Harry says quietly. “You saved my life.”
Sorry this is so late, and so short! If you're still reading let me know with a kudos or a comment!
"I don't believe we particularly require anything at the moment."
“Show me your arm.”
Draco thought slowly.
Draco is quiet, still watching the boy as he jerks violently and suddenly heaves a slug onto the bedspread. His nose wrinkles, but he still refuses to turn back to meet Snape's eyes. He's always had the feeling that Snape could see right through him, any lie he might try to pass off. Now more than ever. The Dark Lord's right hand, sitting right at his bedside.
"I was," he admits.
Harry shifts against him again, closer this time, and lowers his head almost to Draco's shoulder hesitantly. "It's just tight. Don't you feel it?"
. Everything is still and there’s a ringing in his ears.
Luna feels it before she sees it.
He held his breath. He wasn't sure he'd get an answer.
Harry shifted his hips up into Draco's, hearing his breath hitch as he made contact. There was a pause, and then Draco dragged his hips across Harry's, shifting them down hard.
Harry stormed up to the Gryffindor tower, finding Hermione reading in the common room.
In addition: I've been neglecting my girls for a bit! Next bit is all about them.
She wrinkled her nose, frowning. "You accepted his intention," she said, reluctant.
They don't stop.
"A formal courtship is serious, Harry. I don't think even Draco would mess around with it. Strong magic."
Draco's cheeks feel hot despite the chill in the room, and he drops his eyes to the floor. He wants to lean into Harry's arms. He wants him to keep the cold at bay.
he did, it's tradition! At the start of the courtship the pursuer presents the gift of solicitude, which represent being serious about the relationship, which starts the bond, which honestly is rather dangerous."
That's right, I'm back! Sorry it took so long to post the second chapter, but I'm glad I got back to this piece, there's so much I want to do with it!
Draco knows he should have expected these kinds of sit-downs when he learned who his roommates would be, but that didn't stop him from wanting to run when Seamus stumbled out into the common area and shouted "Family meeting!"
"I suppose it wouldn't hurt," Harry murmured. "But I don't know that I like lads like
“Have to say something.” He stretches arms out to feel his way down the hall, wincing at the stretch under the drying blood. “
"I-I suppose," Harry replied, eyes wide. "If the bond is uncomfortable, that makes sense. You'll have to open it, though."
. She stood. Took her luggage from where it fell. She would stay calm. She would make it to the dorms. She wouldn't
"Well he isn't tied to a chair in the center of the Great Hall," Seamus offered. "Anymore, at least."
Draco awoke to whispers outside the curtains surrounding his bed and reached for where his wand on the bedside table, his hand meeting nothing but empty space.
On the occasions he had spared Potter a thought over the summer, Draco had always pictured him with his short hair, bangs hiding his scar, still just a tad too short to be pushed out of his eyes. But Potter hadn't cut it, after all, no—he had let it grow out, just brushing his shoulders. He had gained weight, lost the gaunt dip in his cheeks and sharp shoulders, and with it,
The blond boy mumbled something incoherent, and Harry hooked his arms under his knees, grunting as he stood. He could feel Harry's warmth seeping through his thin nightshirt, and his head drooped to rest on one of Harry's shoulders.
"I'm fine," She said, her voice still weak with what could only be explained as the complete absence of air.
A voice says. He sees Snape’s face over him, and Harry’s near the door, contorted in something that must be shock.
"Merlin, fine!" Draco wound his arms around Harry's neck, shifting over to sit behind him. "You better not drop me."
House arrest didn't lend itself to studying in the way it was supposed to in his head. His mother hadn't let him forget that he should be eating more, doing more, but he had just ended up curled in the library or deep in the garden, trying to ignore the events that had ruined his childhood home. The only time spent away was at Hogwarts, eight hours four times a week, spelling away the ruin and rebuilding the castle from the ground up. If anything changed, no one would see it. Same man, same scars, same fucking tattoo—he couldn't imagine that the same wouldn't hold true for Potter.
"Boys!" Hermione shouted. The boys turned to her. "Draco's in the hospital wing."
Draco doesn’t want to dance, and she wonders why they came together at all.
Ronald Weasley,
Draco shivered, put his quill down.
"I'll return, I wanted to speak to Madame Pomfrey."
His hand is sweaty around his quill, fingers tight as he lifts it, shaking, to his skin.

The day Pansy arrived to Hogwarts her legs collapsed on the walk to the carriage station, and she heard a brief snicker of "
“I missed you,” she adds.
"What I read is of no concern to-" Draco stops. "Merlin, then you've read it too!"
"Prove it." he challenged.
," he insisted again. "It's not like I'm going to break, I'm not the Weasley girl." Harry knew that should have made him mad, shouldn't have caused that streak of warmth in his stomach, but he couldn't feel anything except the burning desire to do
"The bond-mates take their last set of vows on front of all their friends and family," Narcissa said.
"I got the crest."
"Are you sure?"
“It’s okay,” Draco mumbles,
"Draco? Are you awake?"
"I would've thought you'd be good at it by now," Draco huffed.
"Afraid your cooking won't be up to snuff?" asked Seamus. "I hate cleaning; I would rather cook twice."
Harry was silent. So Draco never knew about his childhood. Just think of the insults he missed out on. Someday soon he would tell him about it, but not today. It wasn't that important anyway.
Draco flinched at his father's glare, hitting his wrist on the table in his rush to comply, spilling hot soup onto his sleeve. His

likely felt nothing toward him, even if that was something he couldn't accept. Harry took clean bandages, filched from the Hospital Wing, from the bottom of his trunk before he lifted his quill once more.
“You didn’t know?” Draco asks.
Due to new housing and patterns in returning students, your accommodations will be both mixed-gender and mixed-house. Slytherin only has two returning students for their eighth year, yourself and Ms. Pansy Parkinson, while many of the other houses have many more. As such, your housing, and Ms. Parkinson's, will be alongside overflow Gryffindor students.          You have been placed with Ms. Parkinson in the West Tower suite with five others.           Please contact us by way of owl if any questions arise before your arrival on the 18th August.
"Stop that," Harry hissed. "Now we're stuck here."
Luna shows. She can't wait anymore. She just wants to hold her. The classroom is dark and calm, but there's a chill in the air that makes its way through her thin clothes and into her shoes. She casts a warming charm carefully, rocking back and forth on her heels as she feels it settle over her.
"Is it for Draco?" she asked. Harry nodded again.
“Oh goodness!” the woman yelled.
He looks back down at his book with a slight smile and stares intently at the page, trying to find some logical reason to still be reading it when he could probably borrow some parchment from Harry to do his work.
Second Gift, Night Quidditch¿
I love all of you, thanks for sticking with me and my nonexistent update schedule!
"Ready?" Ron asked as he emerged.
. "Can you really just create a new family crest like that?"
Harry was silent for a moment, his fingers worrying the frayed edge of his robe.
They will always be covered in each other’s scars.
Draco thought that was fair.
"I'm sure you both lived in muggle luxury, whatever that could be."
Again, please watch for tags that may be triggers for you.
Harry licked his lips and pulled Draco down, slipping his hands into his hair, lips barely touching his. "I will," he mumbled, and crushed their lips together without a second thought.
"Because he
"I-" Harry started, taken aback. He stared at his hands, biting his lip.
. Am I dead?”
, Draco thought.
When Harry woke up, Draco was gone, the dorm was quiet, and rain ran down the windows of the tower. He rolled over into the now cool place where Draco had been, pressing his face into the pillow and pushing his hands under the pillow.
"Who cares about bloody tradition? Do you want to get yourself thrown out?"
