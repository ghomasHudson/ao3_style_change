Harry’s eyebrows pulled further down in the centre, a frown forming more from confusion than hurt, or anger. "Do you want to sleep with other people?"

"I visit my mother once a week. Usually, it's lunch in Diagon Alley, but this time I went to the Manor. Her request. So we're eating, and everything's going about as well as it can. She's snarking; I'm trying to be polite." Draco stood to walk the length of the room, leaving Harry alone at the table. He watched, rapt as he was treated to the view of Draco from the back, his arse perfect in his jeans as he ran a gloved finger along the stone walls.
“Good. Now, I was expecting jammy cookies. I’ll be waiting for them in the lounge.”
"Really?" He whispered, unbelieving as Harry nodded.
As the long summer days grew shorter, he decided to drink in as much of regular life as possible, taking up all invitations that came his way. He forgot to drench the laptop in the Magic-B-Gone potion Tom sent along with it, and it promptly went up in sparks, convincing Kreacher that it, and all other Muggle technology, was cursed. With a good lacquer of the potion, the phone survived, a dark-grey clamshell with an M embossed on the front in blue, which Harry took great pains to hide from the house-elf's view. When he owled a few friends his newly minted cell-phone number, it was nothing short of shocking when Dean actually rang him up. They popped to the cinema to watch a long, rambling film about pirates that Dean considered beneath him, and Harry enjoyed more than he was willing to admit.
Draco licked his lips and nodded at Harry to begin, and he got to watch his pupils grow at the precipice, at the moment that his hand gripped tighter and he squeezed the belt under that hand, metal and leather separating their skin.
"Oh, are joggers beneath you?"
"Oh my god Draco, shut up, won't you? I'm really trying here, and you can be so irritating," Harry opened his eyes to Draco's, bright with mirth. "It took me a while to figure it out, but I like you very much."
"I am sorry about Pansy's behaviour," he offered, taking the seat next to Harry. "Her parents are getting divorced, and she's not taking it well, clearly,” he sighed. "Personally, I think sixteen is the cut-off for being allowed to get your knickers in a twist over
"Harry, friend, what makes you say—"
"As loose as you can get, basically," he'd told Reza, his stylist.
"Okay, what does
"I'm sorry," Harry croaked at long last. They had all decamped to the living room, Hermione and Harry taking up acres of real estate on the worn, too-squishy couch, Ron nursing a whisky four-fingers deep from his favourite orange chintz chair.
Harry exhaled shakily. He was empty again and wished for bed. His own would be good—he should go off and be alone again.
"Wait," Harry interrupted Malfoy, watching his eyes refocus, "I'm lost. How does this have anything to do with what landed you in trouble with the Ministry?"
Draco glanced away. "No comment."
"Yeah."
Harry's stomach constricted at the thought. He'd been studiously ignoring the brief letter from Ginny telling him he had to come back that Sunday for dinner, or Molly and Arthur would disown him, and her for not doing a good enough job in wrangling him. He'd been remiss not to tell them in the first place, knew it was cowardice to continue hiding out from them for so long.
At last, water welled in Malfoy's eyes and on a blink of realisation, dripped down the damp sides of his face. Harry'd done a lot of things, but bringing him to tears was the cherry on top of the cake.
Whispered conversations continued around the room. Ginny must have said something lewd because she sent Neville and Dean into hysterics, which they tried to contain for the sake of the group. Harry kneaded his hands together, wondering what in the world Draco was getting at.
"Who told you what Velcro is anyway?" Harry covered for the awkwardness of the moment by babbling. "Just so I can, you know, go back in time and strangle them to death. I can tell you're going to be terribly annoying about it."
"It's the first thing I overhear when all I've done is set a glamour to cover my scar, you know.
In the beginning, he'd throw them out without a second glance. Lately, he'd read them and, more often than not, be unable to recollect writing them at all. They filled the time in-between obligations and were full of things he wished he could write to Draco—words that went beyond the stark numerals of their enchanted Galleons.
"Draco," he swallowed, trying to get Draco to look him in the eye, "you've got to listen to me—"
"Careful," Draco hissed, adjusting them himself. The sight of his black-leather glove so close to his balls made Harry's prick swell, a pulse he couldn't have predicted. Everything about Draco was a fucking turn-on to him—how could he have ever pretended otherwise?
"But you didn't," Ron said, and he looked at Harry with pity, and that was the only thing Harry couldn't stand.
"Malfoy, I, what—" Harry stammered.
"Mass breakout would be more like a family reunion," George muttered. Charlie sucked his teeth at him as Mrs Weasley gave him a frown that couldn't be argued with. "Excuse me," he said gruffly, not offering a further explanation as he stood and left the room. A quiet descended at the table, broken only by the Rajani's asking for help in levitating over more rolls until Ron spoke up.
, the numbers casting a faint glow onto the ceiling above.
The bridge of his nose wrinkles. “A Sangiovese should be paired with food.” He returns the glass next to Harry’s clenched fist.
"I heard about George," Harry said. Happy sounds emanated from the living room, but he wasn't listening to that. Harry tried and failed to ignore the continued sound of running water from the washroom down the hall.
had the room back in order in no time, and it wasn't long after that Hermione's grudging forgiveness was bought with Harry's spag bol and Ron whispering things that made her blush into her ear.
Draco sucked his teeth and stepped closer to the bed.
good it felt. The memories had started to seem too good, like the stuff of dreams, and yet here was, aching, his body stretched wide and filled up so well, so completely, that it was like the alchemy between them went as deep as their bones.
She took a drag; he stared at the ceiling again. They'd earned the break, had been holed up inside for a sunrise and a sunset, and were due to watch another sunrise through her narrow office windows any minute. Harry's eyes were dry—he summoned his designated glass of water from where he'd left it on her desk, a bright white monstrosity from Sweden, and tipped it back, some of it rolling down the sides of his face and onto his neck. He laid back and flexed his toes.
"I apologize," Draco said. "I didn’t mean to poke fun. Go on."
"Feelings and everything?" Ron said.
"Brilliantly," Harry choked out. It was a gift he’d cherish forever.
He didn't have the time for this. No pleasantries, not on his birthday. The hawks that circled him wherever he went were probably already there, just outside, and he couldn't risk them catching him buying Ogden's.
"Did something happen at the ball?"
"Hardy har har, it's a right surprise that I'm not more forthcoming then, is it?" Harry grumbled. He heaved an enormous chunk of cake into his mouth to assuage his petulant anger. The chocolate mollified him, if only very slightly.
Draco’s, hoarsely crying out in agony. The ecstasy comes later, for him. In the remembering.
"The old guard get a bit nervy when upstarts come in talking about
"Do you want to talk about any of it," Harry asked, "with me, I mean?"
His squinted at it, bringing it within inches of his face. "What am I looking at?" The page was written with so many abbreviations, numbers small and big, that Harry had no clear clue what it was on about.
The sheets rustled louder than Harry remembered. Perhaps it was all the turning about he was doing. Draco lay still, but Harry couldn’t fathom it, not with so many thoughts buzzing in his head.
was important, and how fucking sick was it that Harry had strung him along and let him believe that he was anything other than extraordinary?
"He was," Hermione nodded emphatically, messy curls shaking around her face, "it was wild!"
"Please, just—" Harry held it out so that his knuckles rested against Draco's chest. He was warm through the shirt, and Harry could feel his heartbeat, hard and steady. He didn't pull away.
Harry placed his hand to the crook of Draco’s jaw, cupping it. By the tempo of the vein thudding in his throat, Draco’s heart was speeding too, and that’s what it finally took.
"New Penny House?" he tried.
"Not so tight—
If Harry hadn't had a view to see how deeply Draco gripped his own thigh under the table, he wouldn't have known that he reacted to the news at all. As it was, all he did that was visible to anyone else was blink.
Malfoy snorted, which gave Harry the heart to continue.
They manoeuvred so Harry was on all fours and when he looked up and was confronted by a mirror behind the headboard, they caught each other’s eyes in it and smiled the way hyenas do. Of course, he’d need to see this. He’d probably never looked more debauched, a thick thatch of hair still pulled back and off to one side from where Draco had gripped it, the rest shooting off in literally every direction. And Draco—Draco really was his wet dream. Lips as pink as he was across the sharp rise of his cheekbones and nose—he’d burnt, somehow, in the afternoon sun. The look of concentration on his face as he conjured lube and pushed two fingers inside of Harry in a way that would be rough if he wasn't already loose, the smile on his face going lax as the muscles in Harry's back and thighs tensed at the intrusion and he gasped and then relaxed, Draco’s free hand rubbing his lower back.
"I want to." Draco bit his lips, purpled and chapped.
The thing about sex, though, was how it quietened the racing black thoughts in Harry's mind. It turned the dial on them down, and as Harry took Draco's cock into his mouth and closed his eyes in bliss at the salty taste of precome on his tongue, sucking til his cheeks hollowed, the taste alone was enough to shut the thoughts off completely.
He taps him twice on the shoulder.
"How long have you been waiting to say that to me?"
"Now, you're coming to mine for the night unless you're willing to let me know where your hermitage is? Hmm?"
"You smell like him," she said with a shrug, and Harry blinked slowly.
Harry gasped and arched to press into the feeling. They'd fucked last night and he could feel the dull ache it had left behind inside his body, and more thoroughly in the stretched tendons of his hips, which Draco had held wide-open, gripping at the backs of Harry’s knees, watching him come undone in a writhing mess below him. Harry was sure that they could go again, though he’d be sitting gingerly for it.
if you can ask a question, ask me—"
Harry sighed, kicking at the blankets to get under them. His whole plan of a nice, quiet nap was quickly disintegrating before his eyes.
"Fuck."
“You know you could have come too,” Harry whispered hoarsely. He’d had a few cigarillos, and his throat sounded like it had been tumbling rocks. “It was a lads night, and you’re a lad.”
"Yes, Kreacher! Please!" Draco yelled back. The moment was broken but not the promise of it. Harry touched his lips, the wild nature of that single kiss sending him reeling. He already needed everyone to arrive and then
Instead of answering, Draco cast his own
"Er, at that Cannons game last month," Harry said, feeling abruptly very hot, as though a thousand stage lights were suddenly aimed directly at him. He was glad that Ron already had a few pints under his belt, as his eyes and ears had become much more astute since they'd gone through Auror training.
it, every element of the house in superb condition. The rooms didn't react but instead anticipated needs, the temperature and lighting just so, the entire space smelling faintly of eucalyptus and cedar rather than varnish and paint fumes, as it should have following such intensive repairs as it had undergone. Harry gave Draco the tour late at night midweek, and they'd walked the rooms, a look of wonder on Draco's face. It was like old times, only now the rooms had distinct names, and Harry knew all their tricks. The stone that revealed a private sitting nook if you rubbed it in the right spot, and that the white of the walls in the owlery and of the bedrooms was subtly different, because of when one would be in the space and which direction the windows faced. He'd even been granted access at long last to the cellar, a door appearing one day where door simply hadn't been before. It was stuffed full of so many more weird and wonderful and sure, sometimes ghastly Black family artefacts that it would be years yet before he went through them all.
"I'm honest," Harry frowned.
Draco shook his head. "I don't want to talk about it with anybody, but I'm acquiescing to you on account of I love you, you dreadful, always-fucking-helpful thing. Oceans of secrets, remember," he said again.
he thought.
"Why aren’t you worried?” he asked. “About this?”
"Hey Andromeda," Harry gasped, covering for heartbreak with a grin that came easily whenever Teddy was around. "I thought I spotted a fuzzy tennis ball down here. I was wondering though—where's Teddy?"
Gaze glassy, but the faraway look was gone. He held Harry's eyes as he tilted his head, curious.
"Being twelve, I wasn't very good at hiding anything from anyone—plus I cut up my throat, using my wand to do it, which was so
"He's not in any trouble with the law, then?" Harry finally understood where Narcissa's line of questioning stemmed from. He shook his head gently, caught Lucius rolling his eyes over her shoulder.
"What?" Ron stood, watching as he dropped the bag to the floor at their feet and pulled him into a hug.
"Honestly, you've got a personal stylist, a vault full to bursting, and you're still in boot-cut denim. Potter, are you sure you're even gay?"
"Exactly, texting, thank you—he hasn't even texted you."
"How does that sound?" Draco asked, and Harry nodded, knowing his eyes were wide and probably telecasting his lust as well as the thrill of fear he felt. "It's alright to say no. Or not be sure."
"Is this alright?" he asked, and Harry hummed his assent as best he could, eyes watering at the effort of sucking Draco’s cock without reprieve. The way Draco looked at him, Harry was only too happy to settle in and take it. Draco was being greedy, but also gentle, and Harry found the combination lethally arousing. He blinked away tears, and as his vision cleared, he looked up, wanting to hold Draco’s eyes but instead got to watch his chin jut towards the ceiling as his head fell back with a wanton groan. Harry remembered him—
"I want to try," he said. His voice was deep and even. It made him seem surer than he felt. "But I’m scared that I’ll think—I’m scared I’ll remember things instead. That I’ll freeze up or, like,
Harry swallowed. The talk wouldn't go well; he already knew what he should do. What he should have done.
They didn't have long. The wet sounds of their bodies slapping together filled the room, with Draco's cries gradually gaining in volume as Harry let go and properly fucked him, as deep and as hard as he dared.
"I know you're awake," Draco whispered. He edged closer until the heat of his front enveloped Harry's back. When his breath warmed Harry's ear, it was the first time since getting into bed that he closed his eyes.
"Thanks," Harry said, rather than trying to smile again. "Why could it be weeks?"
Harry shrugged. "I think it's endearing that you pack with plans for books," and wasn't
Harry itched under his gaze. The man might be fooled by Harry's first lie, but he was too on the nose to be fooled by more, so Harry stayed silent instead. They were being passed by with glancing looks from about a dozen witches and wizards, most of whom Harry recognized as the proxies of Ministry higher-ups. Their faster than usual gaits and exhausted faces did the explaining for them that they, rather than those they represented, did most of the Ministry's real work.
"If this is what losing feels like, I have no intention of winning."
"There will be
"What about me? Mordred adores me, she signed off on it in an instant. Everyone in academia fucks off for the summer—that's when the real interns get left behind to stir the cauldrons."
—er, sorry! I'm so sorry, I wasn't looking—"
"Well, time's on your side, as they say. Give it some, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it, alright?" Harry nodded at her and waved a quick goodbye, left feeling grateful that in Andromeda, he'd found a mother-figure, however distant or awkward it had been at first.
"Now."
"Once this dress comes off, this princess vanishes."
. It steeled his resolution to have them meet because he knew that if someone gave Draco just one chance, he'd charm them every time. "Even more than he hates me, he loves you. Go," he said again, squeezing his hand for emphasis. "We'll all still be here, living our little lives when you return. December is going to test us. Shore up some strength while you can."
Harry Potter had touched him, and it was just as the need to escape overcame him that he felt a tap at his shoulder.
"Here," he said, to draw Malfoy's attention to his offering. A white flag, whether of peace or defeat, he wasn't sure.
"I'll let go of this mug and ruin the sheets if you don't take it from me in three, two, one and a half—"
Harry could taste something, violets again, only soapier, this time—the taste of Draco's magic tinged by his mood as it twisted around him. His thoughts were overtaken by Draco's will pushing into his mind, his voice clear inside Harry's head as though he were still speaking aloud.
he wanted this. He couldn't control the face he made or the little sounds of pain that escaped him as he got used to it, his hands tensed on the wood. Draco pumped in and out, no,
"Oh yeah," he replied. "You've no idea how glad the boys are that I didn't pick any of them for best man. Bill and Charlie have each had to do it five times.
Harry opened his mouth, but nothing came out. It felt as though a goose egg felt was lodged in his throat. He couldn't speak around it.
his brain supplied, and a noise came from his throat because there were still senses drawn from his body, though his body and he weren't one and the same anymore. Draco worked his body into a frenzy, rimming it and then he used his fingers again, deeper, until he had three inside, and on the one hand, Harry was thinking of how good it would be to fall asleep, here, in Draco's bed, fingertips pressing into a woodgrain that he could not feel, and on the other hand, he distantly felt so full that he couldn't comprehend more, but it wasn't enough.
Harry bit his lip to keep from laughing at how gently Draco placed his hands at her back, stooping to make the angle less awkward.
He hated crying, he reminded himself. He'd gone soft, and started to let himself feel all his feelings, and for what? It had weakened him, was all. He was weaker—he hadn't used to hurt like this. This kind of pain—that of missing someone not because they were gone, that final kind of gone, but because they didn't want you anymore—this was a pain he hadn't known before Draco, and inoculation against it was simple.
"What's the point anymore," Harry said, raising his hands in question. "Hmm? What's the point of hating you, now? What good does it do? What does it solve?"
. His ask always matches Harry’s need, and that’s the problem, isn’t it?
“The best is when you can feel yourself. Poking through from inside out.”
Harry stood and made Draco stand on the sofa, even convinced him to give a little jump and wrap his long legs around his waist, thighs digging in at his hips as he held on. He may have skipped his morning work-out, but walking up two flights of stairs with Draco attached to him ought to make up for it.
"You're so fucking beautiful like this, pet," he murmured, one hand pressing slickly into Harry's lower back, and for a moment, Harry
Harry shrugged. The lights from cars cut shapes across the ceiling as they passed in the night. A thumb, Draco's, rubbed over his knuckles, and that was the only feeling connecting him to this place, this bed. In his mind, he was outside, floating high above the cars and the buildings. He was the night sky—total, cold, black.
"It is my doing!" he exclaimed. "God, I was trying—
Draco's jaw tensed as he swallowed thickly. “You shouldn’t look at me like that or I'm liable to do bad things to you.”
Harry mewled like he lost his mind. It was undignified, but he was achingly hard, brought to a precipice and kept there, poised, ready to fall at any point but unable to go over by any action of his own. Draco repositioned his hands and pulled back, waiting. It burned a bit, and Harry knew that it would only be a minute before the muscles inside greeted the intrusion. Draco knew this too, and so was patient, holding still until the pressure on his cock loosened, and then he thrust in completely. It was like he pushed sound out of Harry, made him turn to press his cheek flat once more, though he couldn’t see anything for how his eyes were screwed shut.
"I've missed you like this, pet," Draco whispered directly into Harry's ear, and he sighed at the word, trained as he was to react this way when Draco said it. Harry wasn't sure if it was remembered pleasure or having sight taken from him, or the fact that the only thing between his being able to see or not was his willful submission, but as Draco made a loose ring with his fingers encircling his prick and gave the first slow pull of his foreskin down the shaft and then the languid, unhurried slide back up, he shuddered, twisting his face away.
His reply took the form of a healthy swig of his drink.
Harry wasn’t sure what to say to that, so instead, he nervously shook the ice in his empty glass, and then when he could tell it was annoying Draco, stopped that and worried his lip instead. What he wouldn't give for something to do other than small-talk.
He takes Harry’s right hand and guides it under the loose hem of his shirt to where cotton-gauze bandages keep the outside out.
"Roses," he said. He waited until Ron had Disapparated before he dared look over the edge of the car park. He sucked in a surprised breath and fell away, inching back to peer again, carefully, this time. It was to see a little spot of pink down below, a pale face looking up, wondering what had caused the familiar cracking sound in the cold winter air.
"That's not the point.
"You're selling yourself short, Harry." Hermione was just as studious at ignoring his signs of discomfort at the topic as she had been at ignoring Ron's close call. "You're a catch, honestly, crazed hero-worship aside. Blokes do look at you, and you never catch them at it. Muggles too—remember the last time I took you shopping? It's like you're blind to the fact—"
a good thing, in the long run.
"Five."
"You know what?
The first week was entirely strange. Though Harry remembered the contours of their previous relationship to one another, it was obvious that those rules no longer applied. Draco required devotion, didn't want but
"That I was telling the truth," Harry implored. He wiped sweating palms against the fabric on his thighs as Draco shook his head, on and on and on.
"Sorry, could we round back to the part before this whole college bit?" This was George, voice falsely bright and level. His grip on his pint glass shook from the pressure. It had been emptied and filled numerous times already, though never once yet with Draco's proffered mead. "Where were you then?"
“Can’t. House rules.”
"We don't talk about this enough," Draco said, a non sequitur until Harry thought about it for a minute.
"Stop," he warned through the smile threatening to form on his pouty lips.
Harry scoffed. “I’ve said worse, and you’ve survived.”
Harry’s own whingeing was of no use—he couldn’t whine his way out of conversations about Draco anymore. Ron gave him a solemn look, which didn’t mean anything good these days.
to make," the volume of Malfoy's voice spiked before he caught himself and tried again. "The point is that I have only recently decided to rejoin our society. I had reason to leave, and now I have reason to come back."
After a few minutes, he sighed as he did every morning. It was the signal that he was gathering strength to get up properly.
It had been a grey day in late May. Palms sweating, the moment before he'd walked out on stage, he'd seriously considering using those two words as the entirety of his speech to the graduating class. He'd practiced mouthing them along with various expressions in the mirror at home.
"Harry? Are you even listening to me?"
Draco gave him a curt nod and turned, "He'll have a gin and tonic, tall, light ice, extra lime, thank you. You can put him on my tab." They waited to collect their drinks, and then Draco had his hand at the small of Harry's back, escorting him over to a table near the side of a stage. Their shoes pulled against the checkerboard dancefloor, tacky with the spilled drinks of the night previous.
“Ministry,” Harry said quietly. Draco turned to him, and Harry expected frustration, but all he saw was fear turning to sadness.
“Swallow,” is a command whispered. Harry has to make do with imagining the flap of epiglottis covering Malfoy’s windpipe, and the contraction of all those other dark, glistening folds to move that bit of Harry deeper.
"Your wish is my command," Justin said, and they were off.
"Oh, yes, gods, you're good; of course you're so good, aren't you, Potter."
"Really?" Malfoy asked. Harry had hit a nerve.
"Doesn't matter to me. I know I'm a boy. It's a just bit of fantasy for everyone else," he said. As he went to step away, Harry's whispered "Wait," stopped him in his tracks.
"You know how I work, Harry," she said, voice dangerously light. Victoria Cresswell's personality was as sharp as her winged eyeliner, and Harry was in her bad books, had been all year. "Everything is settled on my end."
"I've got to stop by the portkey office before they close for the afternoon anyway; it's just you, know—on the way."
"Yeah, not my finest moment. And I expected him to go in on that, but he just cleaned me up and went on about asking for a bit of my time to apologize. Haughty, like, 'but you needn't even grant me that. Only know that I mean to someday and that I mean it'. And I must have just stood there gaping at him for so long that he kept going." She poked at a chunk of ice in her glass, eyes following her fingertip. "It was quite touching, actually."
“They’re a Muggle thing, then?” Draco asked.
powder in the school lab. “I cannot
"I will if you want me to next time. But I wasn't about to do it for Weasley's—Ron—for
Harry took a tentative step forward.
"Mate, come on. How many times do you want to be Witch Weekly's Most Eligible Bachelor, eh? You do want to date, right?"
"Is this a secret you’ve wanted to tell me?"
“Now we’re getting a lashing,” Ron laughed, and Harry felt a heat that had everything to do with a need to protect Draco from the hurt caused by ill-placed jibes rise up his chest. But Draco looked him in the eye and gave him the smallest of shakes of his head.
Malfoy nodded. Harry frowned, not sure how to answer. "I'm not really a big fan of nightlife, to be honest."
. But that was when he saw it, the diamond in the muck. He sat up from his relaxed pose, laying flat against the long bench that had once held half the Order over busy supper times. He absentmindedly brushed crumbs from his t-shirt as he re-read the words—the bacon sarnie had been eaten after all.
He had to be careful not to snap. His silence in the face of Pansy's smell had been bought by two articles—both negative—that had been published in the last week.
Harry sighed, rested his head on Draco's thigh. "Not nearly enough to not have my wits about how much I want to suck your cock," he said, and Draco laughed.
Harry tugged the chair closer to the edge of the bed. It was a smidge too short, but the seat raised at a tap of his wand. He wasn’t sure if it was Narcissa or Draco who reduced it between visits, and wouldn’t give either of them the satisfaction of asking.
"I'm going to try it tonight. I just—I don't want to freak out, or anything.” He pulled at the fingertips of his right hand. “So I'm telling you because I want to try, and I'll stay at the table at least a half-hour, and I promise, I won't go and—you know. Do anything about it."
“Laparoscopic surgery—”
Harry braced himself for a third attempt, muscles throughout his body tense at the expected pressure. Draco didn't push at all this time. He stopped with the cockhead slippery, feeling fat against the entrance to Harry's body. He licked the outer shell of his ear.
"That's purging, too."
Harry heard Hermione's command very clearly but refused to bow to pressure too quickly.
"I was always Harry Potter to them, I think. There's this weird level of deference I get. It's unnerving—like I could feel everyone staring, all the time, but no one would look me in the eye in the halls." Harry pushed his glasses up as he rubbed at tired eyes. "They were all too intimidated to join me for lunch in the canteen if Ron wasn’t there."
Harry frowned, thinking through the situation. It didn't add up, not quite.
He stalked off to the bathroom, and Harry could hear him grumbling even as he stood to slash and flicked on the water in the sink to brush his teeth, but it was Harry who smirked, as he knew then that he'd won the battle of the early riser.
"This summer, you say," Pansy said, humming to herself. "Sounds about right, him leaving the house for his quarterly allotment of a good time."
Ron stared bleakly off into the distance, a broken record stuck on a single word.
"Gollybean?" Harry asked, swallowing against a throat suddenly gone dry. Draco nodded, his fingers circling loosely around Harry's wrist now, and oh godfuckingdamnit Lucius Malfoy knew about him, about the feeling he got when he looked at Draco, he’d heard that they were dancing together, it was all over—
"Two meetings, both tomorrow. One is to see the space for the children's home, finally, over in Chapeltown. The other is right after, with Mr Sparks, to sign some paperwork. Other than that, family dinner on Sunday. And being wherever you need me to be." Draco looked to him, biting a lip. His features were well-schooled, face a wide blank. Harry couldn't help but add, "Trying to catch you at whatever it is you do to get your splits, because the thought of you so flexible is sort of
"Only Ogden's finest," Malfoy replied in what must be his haughtiest Lucius impression, "I'll Accio us the bottle."
"Did you really date?" Harry tugged Draco's hands more tightly around him. He was curious, though the tug of sleep also threatened to pull him under any minute.
"Who gave you permission to be here?" Her words were clipped, demanding. Harry was startled by the realization that Draco looked so much more like her than he did his father. He'd inherited her cheekbones; the way her skin stretched over them was all Draco. Strange too, how much she looked like her sister, as the ample amount of white that now streaked her long mane of black hair attached her readily to Andromeda.
"Something tells me you wouldn't even if you had good reason to," she eyed him knowingly. "Reza's already been by with your order for the next few months. You wouldn't be trying to alter it for any reason, would you?"
Harry's whole world shrunk down to the warm breath he inhaled and the press of—
"Good boy," he said, "up on your knees again, like before."
Malfoy sighed dramatically. "Oh, I'm sure you could find some lovely bloke or ten who wants nothing more than to spend all his time with you while you do your lonely push-ups or stare morosely into the distance or whatever it is you do all day. I imagine it takes a lot of time for you to contemplate another year of being the most beloved troglodyte the Ministry ever rubber-stamped into becoming an Auror, but you could pull if you only put some of that famous Potter-enthusiasm into it."
Draco helped him by stomping onto his pants and trousers to push them from his knees to his ankles. His hand found the back of Harry's neck, palm to spine as he pushed him over the edge of the sideboard, stopping only when Harry could see himself reflected in the cabinetry's darkly polished surface. Harry couldn't make out the words whispered behind him but felt the sudden, strange emptiness of a preparatory spell zinging through him, lube just as suddenly in him, a cool, awkward feeling. All the breath left his body in a gust, surprise stealing his breath. It wasn't hot, wasn't going to be pushed into him tenderly with teasing fingers, just there, utilitarian.
bump on his head, like—"
cute, thank you," which brought a rich pink hue to his cheeks and set him coughing up his cherry juice.
"I take a medium, firstly." Draco flipped back the covers and slipped in beside Harry, wearing another overlarge shirt—his in black, Harry's in horizontal stripes. "And maybe I enjoyed a slightly baggy fit when I purchased it."
"It's private," Malfoy said, "but, it's not—"
"Well," he answered, tipping his head back and forth as he raked his mind for an answer, "there aren't any doors in the toilets, so it was rather easy to find someone to polish my knob."
“What is it I've done, exactly? Do I not turn to you for companionship this way because I am beholden to a marriage that cannot be broken?”
"You're going to be okay." He plucked the corner of the jumper from Draco's shoulder so that the seam fell where it was meant to. "This isn't a test—"
"Don't you
That he needn't be waifish to be attractive. Harry wanted simple words and actions to be the answer. In that way, he thought, it could be easy.
For a moment, he was ready to shove Ron and tell him to fuck off and stop joking, but even at a distance, Harry recognized Draco's fluid movements; the way he swung his arms while demonstrating, how they appeared so loose and yet so controlled, elegant, perfect lines. Harry fumbled in his joggers' left pocket and came up with a cigarette, which he lit with barely a thought and took a pull on.
Ron sighed. "You know I can't say shite like you can, Harry. What I can say is that someone—"
Being used like this. To be dirty, sucking and gagging with the sweetest yet filthiest things being whispered, just for him. Only for him. To be a slut for someone who appreciated it. Who loved, if not him, at least what he could give them. And who better than Draco to give him that?
"Make it tight, now," Draco murmured, and Harry squeezed his thighs together obediently.
"You're going to regret that thought," Draco said, eyes narrowed to slits. "I can't tell if you actually
It was an ill-advised time to have gone in for another lick. Harry stopped and tried to clean his lips in a way that wasn't lascivious.
"You’ve got a swimmer's body," he said as he admired the sharp line of his shoulders and how intensely his torso narrowed at his waist, down to straight hips. Harry made a note to get Draco out of his trousers next he saw him—his legs were some secret thing he hadn't yet seen properly.
"Alright then," Harry licked his lips, thinking, "let's say I believe you."
"I like them," he said, attempting to contort in such a way that he could see the mark without a mirror. "I like it when you lose yourself, Potter. You're much more fun when you're not so buttoned up."
on himself, so he stood and joined him in the kitchen. From there he could see his feet, stockinged toes bunched up on the tile. He gripped the edge near the sink, white-knuckling it.
"I'll go," he said, "I'll be good and wear the outfit and the mask and everything. I promise to take questions and even smile for the camera the way you like so much. Happy?"
"Six," Harry huffed. The right shoulder would pop, eventually. There wasn't any point in pretending they didn't hurt.
"If you get frustrated, you can always ask for help, okay?" Harry softened his tone and approached the table, forcing calm as he fiddled with the tiny bits of plastic. Draco watched him, didn't thank him when he passed the newly beeping device over a minute later.
"Yes," Malfoy whispered, so close to Harry's ear that a shiver ran down his spine.
"Nice," she corrected. "Perfect. I take it you're not interested in the Gillyweed oil biscuits I brought, then?"
The smile spread as Draco looked up at Harry from underneath his long lashes.
Harry shrugged. He knew better than to ask if he could heal him then, nixed the very thought of asking. "Nothing. It's only, I think the word for it is died, for electronics. They can't really pass away, right? Since they don't have souls." Draco only frowned more deeply, and Harry got up to rummage through the cupboards for something to fix for dinner. "It's funny, people thinking that being Muggle-born, or raised away from magic must cause this huge rift, all this social strife and whatnot, and I think it's actually brilliant."
When Harry told Hermione and Ron what he wanted to do with his life, he knew he was on his own again.
"Potter?"
"You're a great mate," Dean said, slapping him on the back with one hand while spilling a bit of Carlsburg onto the concrete floors with the other.
"Duck massaman. The sauce came tinned, so you don't have to worry about chunks of peppercorn in, this time." Harry meant to smile but found he couldn't force it yet. He felt cold, rattled. "You look like shit," Ron said, eyeing him more closely as Hermione walked in, with a little, "Oh!" of surprise.
"I've almost done it. It's ten pounds, not a stone, but still," he whispered. "No purging in thirty-three days, either." The vein visible at the opening of his pale blue button-down shirt was filling and emptying at a dizzying rate, his worry made palpable. He looked expectantly at Harry, eyes wide.
"Don’t know how? This is how you learn." They stopped when there was gentle pressure, the metal making a divot into his throat. "One," he breathed, and Harry nodded to let him know he could drop the guiding hand. "One can be enough. Just pressure." He swallowed hard and caressed his bollocks through his pants, nearly died to see his eyes close as he panted through parted lips from his touch.
at his own trainers and gave them a thorough once over. Hewitt was the one who’d taught him to double-check your shoes before giving bad news to families. Good news, too—any news.
"Security checks? Are you listening to yourself? What—it's a matter of national security where I am on a Friday night?"
Draco replied softly. "I asked for it."
"Yes, really. Otherwise, I look like a ghost haunting the streets. Do you think a straight man has enough sense to ask for this haircut? These are this season's fucking Tom Ford sunglasses. You and I, walking together, it's obvious that we're—"
"Is that so?" Harry asked, and Draco hummed, pulling him in more tightly.
A somewhat elaborate mask was the last item laid out on his bed—dark grey satin ribbons attached to each side. Placing it at his face, the ribbons wandered to the back of his head, tying themselves into a flat bow.
"You can't keep seeing him," Ron cut in. "Simple."
Harry twisted his drink in his hands, guilty for having snapped at him.
"Not, um, enemies anymore—" said Harry.
"Don't go poking around in my mind," Harry warned.
privacy that was violated,
"It will be nearly impossible to prove any of it," he said, "but as far as I'm concerned, I only have to prove it to one person."
“Harry.”
"You knew that they were an excuse, right?" He raised an eyebrow, watching Harry’s reaction.
"Your lunch," Harry said feebly, holding out the bag, now deeply crumpled from its journey.
"Great game," he said, shaking his shoulder for effect. "We have
“I thought you might simply be big-headed, but now my money’s on a martyr complex,” Malfoy spoke softly. When Harry’s cheek quivered with an unprofessional smile, Malfoy leaned back, satisfied.
"If you can't talk about them, you can't let them go. You're brilliant at talking, Draco," he nudged his shoulder back. "Tell me you'll give it a chance."
Harry smirked. "I'm not helping you develop a timeline and stop prying!" Hermione rolled her eyes, but Harry noticed Ron ease back into his seat, no longer on high alert about Harry's beau.
"I won't forget it, mind you," Draco continued. He was pretending levity, as though they were only joking. "I wouldn't mind more of where that came from. You want to shag me like I'm a thing you own? Like you own me? Go right ahead."
Draco exhaled heavily, smashing his eyes closed.
"Please give me your cock," Draco ground out at last. He wrapped his hand around the back of Harry's neck to pull him close.
when he needed to be.
"I can tell he wants you," he repeated, voice barely above a whisper, "but I know how you like it." He began to pack his things to leave. "Check your coin when you get the chance."
“We’re taking supper in the garden tonight.”
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. His stomach was sour, and he wanted Draco to go just as much as he wanted him to stay, but a different version of Draco—one that was kinder and more pliable, less bloody difficult all the time.
Harry returned them. Insatiably hungry. Always ready to chase those eyes into poorly lit corners. To fight, or fuck. Sometimes both.
As always, Draco radiated heat that spoke to a fire burning under his snowy exterior. Harry tucked his feet in against his shins to warm them, cold from having poked out the end of the blanket.
The dimple deepened. "So it's Granger's doing then. I'll be sure to send her roses."
A sniffle, terrible in how simply it snips Harry’s heart in two. It doesn’t take a scalpel to dissect him; Malfoy’s depths of sorrow are cooking shears, and they do the job neatly, every time.
"Henry was the photographer they sent—you remember Henry, mucky teeth, sweater-vests? I swear he's been talking; every owl I've received in the last two days from media has had incontinence issues." Harry sniffed the air, recognizing that part of the musty smell was that of owl droppings, like a whiff of the owlery at Hogwarts had drifted into the generally pristine office. He swallowed a laugh, blurred his vision again when her simpering look turned to a scowl.
"Making amends," Neville added. "He's making them. And as Harry's friends, we're giving him this one chance to do it right."
He stopped as Draco slid his hand, now freed of the glove, back around to swirl at the base of Harry’s neck.
Harry enters and pauses, hand at the newel post at the top of the stair. He can’t miss it—the first thing worth noticing is a head of blue at the bar. He inhales in wonder—the head turns.
"I started to get messy. I didn’t even come out to them properly, just let the wrong pronoun slip out over dinner once, and then I got caught by Pimsy—my Father’s house-elf—sneaking someone in. A boy," he said. Harry couldn't quite read his expression, other than it contained a sadness that signalled another story altogether.
Draco was kept busy fielding questions from Teddy as Harry spelled food onto both of their plates. When Teddy's attention was pulled away briefly by Andromeda's rule about "No thank you helpings", whereby he had to try a bite of something before he refused a portion, Draco took a look to his plate, with its hill of creamy mashed potatoes and gravy, cut of roast beef, steamed vegetables, dressed salad and a buttered white dinner roll. He turned to Harry with an infinitesimal widening of his eyes that clearly indicated the panic that was ensuing inside him.
Harry broke off. The concept of raising Teddy as a son crashed into him as the most incredible opportunity, but the word in this context was rancid.
Harry pulled the cigarette from his fingertips and puffed on it. The smoke filled him, brought dizziness into the mix. He liked it, maybe. Maybe just because it felt different.
"You're a friend of Draco's, right?"
. One didn’t eradicate the number of prophecies and priceless artefacts he had and not expect some hard feelings, even a decade after the fact.
Harry aimed a
He took a deep breath, tried to redirect the conversation.
Harry sunk his head into his hands, still on the friendly side of exasperated, if only just. The night had started out on a jovial note, the entire Weasley extended family and what had to be all of Molly Weasley's living friends crammed into the Leaky Cauldron for her belated birthday celebrations. The venue's rental was Harry's gift, an extravagance that was an unfortunate requirement for him to be able to mingle without worry with those he loved in a public place. It had the added benefit of making all the attendees feel like stars as their photos were snapped on the way from the Apparition point to the front doors. Harry would never forget giving a masterclass in the 'casual wave and demure smile' to Ginny and Molly a couple years before, his effort leaving everyone else in attendance at the time in stitches and tears. Evidently, Harry was a bit of a natural in front of the camera, even though he felt like a nervous wreck most of the time. Ginny Weasley, on the other hand, was an unmitigated disaster.
, Potter, you're not making any sense—"
Harry considered this. The press of eyes around the room looking and finding him was becoming noticeable. The warmth of the room and the volume of the assembled crowd seemed to have suddenly crept up, and his hands began to shake.
Draco cocked his head. "Somewhere between a flock of widgeons and a warbler, by the sounds of it," he said before taking a bite.
"Say it again," Draco said, voice breaking around the words, like watching himself come into Harry's mouth was a sweet torture. "Repeat it, and say 'sir.' Would you do that for me?"
Draco snorted. "When something has the word 'sex' in it." This was met with mixed reviews from the men in the group.
to clean the blood, and then a longer spell, to heal the split. When she was finished, Harry ran a finger over the newly healed scab on his lip. "Where is he?"
"No Floo access, I suppose," Draco mused.
He dropped his napkin on the remains of his meal. Harry did the same and the plates disappeared. Dessert popped up to replace it—chocolate mousse with raspberries. Neither of them picked up their spoons.
"I can’t quite remember it all," Draco said.
"Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'll keep my bit short because nobody wants to hear me drone on."
Harry hung his head, knowing that the jig was up.
"Week after next," Draco answered.
Harry's cheeks darkened as the stare from the woman behind the desk continued, unabated.
"Didn’t you say that the Department of Mysteries wanted you?"
It was therefore unexpected when, only just beginning on the mastication journey with his latest sandwich monstrosity, he heard the front door slam, and then a bark of something like laughter.
Harry groaned, rolling onto his side.
"My doctor housed me on the eating disorder wing. She wanted me to be on the same meal plan as the ladies—I say, ladies, though there was another lad who joined us near the end of my tenure."
Harry found it difficult to swallow. He'd hinted before—
"What?"
"Is it serious?" Hermione took the far seat on the sofa, patting the space in the middle, and Harry followed her over and sat.
"What's that?" Ron asked. Harry rolled his eyes—privacy wasn't a strong suit of any of the Weasley's.
"Draco."
"I'm giving it till Christmas," Harry said tersely, as he'd said over and over again, and Ron rolled his eyes and sat at the foot of the bed, playing with the rag blanket folded next to him. His coup de grace was the notes he’d always wanted to share with Draco—proof that his care extended back into their shared history, long before he yelled an ill-timed
"Yes," Harry said, his voice rumbling low into Draco's ear as he straddled him again. Jumpers and t-shirts came off in an uncoordinated jumble until Draco’s fingers could roam Harry's bare chest, but he didn't crowd him, didn't card his hair or kiss his neck as he had before. Harry waited, tense beneath him.
"I am me, though," Draco countered.
“Say something!”
Draco gave no intention of talking either, using his nose to nudge a curl out of the way to lick the outer shell of Harry's ear, and Harry's brain turned fully off. He was paralyzed by lust, a shiver rippling down his spine like lightning.
"Which you do," started Harry.
"You're incredible, and I get a fraction of you." His throat was scratchy and closing up, but he needed to push these words out before they were caught inside him. "And I want so much more, Draco. I’ll take whatever I can get, but to be honest, I want all of it. "
"You’re getting petulant," Harry noted, watching as the comment worked him up further.
"A day in seems about right, don't you think?"
supposed to work. If Draco were there at his side, the two of them would wave to the cameras at the end of the night before they Apparated—where? Where was home? Could they date without rushing to move in together? If they did and broke up, who would move out? Harry didn't want to live in Grimmauld forever, but at least there, their privacy was secure. Would Draco's flat be safe from the media or rabid fans—god, he'd get death threats from the very beginning—and what of his career at the Ministry, his—
Draco had asked Harry to find his most recent chemistry workbook, and Harry hadn't needed to flip through it to make sure it was the right one, but he did, because it filled him with awe to see the work that Draco found mundane. The cover was dated, as all Draco's written ephemera was—
"That's enough of that for now, love, we'll devise a gross little portmanteau for them later. But, we can't foist a dinner party on the poor thing, look at him." She gave a pinch to one of Harry's cheeks, as though he were but a chubby baby. "He couldn't possibly, it'd take him months to put it together."
“I know what it says, I—”
He wanted to squirm his white maggot body away from wherever Harry was.
Harry revisited the rooms they frequented the next day and noted what had changed. A threadbare carpet, fulsome once again, his bare feet sinking into plush fibres. How the runners in the hallways were becoming pillowy soft, muffling his footsteps when he walked the halls. Where a window, once assumed to be stuck permanently closed, would suddenly open a crack, the earthy scents of fall rushing in to clear the stuffy air.
She exhaled, didn't bother with the rest of the lecture. "The impact his skull had, we're worried about the swelling that's to come, so we'll need to keep him under observation for a while. He hasn't responded as expected to the potions we've tried so far, so we're giving it some time." She took a deep breath and pulled a bottle from her breast pocket and rattled them at him.
"Ugh. It's in
"Sex isn't an apology, Harry," Draco said quietly, "and it's not a punishment. I've told you that I'm confused, I don't know what to believe, and I'm—I'm not thinking clearly. I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have done that." Draco squeezed himself tighter, arms wrapped around his impossibly small middle. "I'm not going to fuck you into absolution if that's what you're looking for."
Like a bird flapping its wings, a hopeful feeling went up inside him, and he wanted to stamp it out and smash it away.
"File that away for fucking later," he muttered under his breath, noting the desk where tidy piles of parchment, a glass jar with quills and ballpoint pens mixed together, and stapled A4 paper packets with long sections streaked with highlighter yellow were laid out neatly. It was an odd assortment of items for a pureblood, but he didn't have the headspace to spare to consider them more deeply.
The pitter-patter of conversation dried up all at once, making it all the more obvious when Andromeda lowered her cup and took a bracing breath.
“‘Course he can. Who in bloody hell is he going to mouth off about it? Unless he
"Always," he said, and Harry heard it as the promise he needed. "Always."
graphic in cracked screen print across the front and joggers with the waistband rolled down—was so far removed from the tight white shirts tucked into black tights that he wore when running through ballet exercises that he may as well be a completely different person.
Harry tapped a shoe on the tile. He reached for the larger gauged needle and syringe, and Draco’s wide eyes lit up.
He felt good. Almost
Draco to look at him like that, like he'd hung the moon. He licked at the slit of his cockhead, the taste of salt that he'd come to associate with Draco, specifically, and without any pretence sucked back on eagerly.
"That's okay by me," Harry said, a fizzy feeling alighting in his stomach at the words
Harry was glad that Draco had enjoyed the gathering, as private as they could make it; Harry told him he'd cancelled the reservation at the Shard for what was meant to be a surprise party without any issue, though the truth was he'd paid for the entire thing, dinner and all, having cut it too close to the deadline of the event.
"He'll come round. We'll talk again soon and," she tilted her head and gave him another one of her sad smiles, "I'm happy for you, Harry. Really. He does seem different now. And not surface-level different, you know?"
Harry looked around the canteens drab walls and pulled the laptop closer, crossing his arms around it and resting his cheek against it's closed face. The metal was cool; he closed his eyes.
Harry frowned—he’d been trained to notice things, and this seemed like an egregious lie to suddenly make up.
"How do you mean?"
"Will you help me, then? Because I can't help what I don't understand."
They stopped, quivering on the edge of laughter, or happy tears, or both, when the sound of a throat clearing pulled their attention away from each other and towards the healer that had walked in after Harry. His deep brown eyes crinkled with crows feet at the corners, his amusement clear at their reintroduction to one another.
Crosses, the kind meant to symbolize help and health; more, plenty, bounty. They added everything in neat columns as Draco tallied up what
"Have not," Harry gasped, choking on a bit of his own spit.
"I don't adhere to your silly rules about these things, and I don't even know what the silent auction is in support of—”
he was
"Is there anything special you'd like to do today, then?"
liked it when he was in charge, when he got to use Harry's prick how he liked, and it was breathtaking, how the lines of tension in his body relaxed into it as the stretch brought him the pleasure he'd envisioned. He canted his hips forwards, tilting his pelvis so the angle was better and through a combination of gravity and force deepened the breach, sliding slowly, slowly downwards.
"There will be weekly public
"Not fair, patently unfair! You can't gang up on me like this!"
The music played off his dance partner's MP3 thing through the stereo system was mesmerizing—fuzzy and looping, with great big beats pulsing at the rate of your heart. The music wasn't anything like the regimented opera and classical piano that Draco typically listened to when he practised at home. The way he moved wasn't anything like how he moved at home, either, and what he wore—a loose grey t-shirt with the
“Um, okay.” This wasn't the tack he'd expected, but Harry wasn't so thick as to disagree. He pushed up his glasses to wipe away the tears that had wet his lashline. "Yeah. Of course. Draco.”
"I worked bloody hard for this, Harry. Show up and be good. Or, rather, don't," she added slyly.
weddings."
"And then what," Harry asked nonchalantly, hoping not to give away how thrilled he was that Draco was planning on doing
"What drew you to it?" Harry asked. This was going fine, he thought, taking another measured sip. This was going great, considering what it was that they were doing.
"I'd be delighted to sit next to you, Teddy," he accepted with a smile. "We'll be right behind you. Find your Gran so you can wash that soot from your hands before you sit down."
“Oh, the gentleman prefers blonds, does he?" She took note and jotted this factoid down, or pretended to at least, just to make him sweat. "If you don’t want me to print that, blink twice for gingers."
“Uh, no. No. Can you not—”
"Ten points—to Gryffindor," Malfoy retorted. His red eyes ignored Harry completely, trained instead on the staircase over his shoulder.
"Perfectly normal," the healers said, and Draco nodded, and Harry nodded, and they went home and they didn't talk about it. The sleeping shirts were back, and after one grim attempt at mutual masturbation (Draco went soft and was nearly asleep by the time Harry finished), Harry had left the matter be. It had been only weeks since the incident, not months, and there were more important things at hand. Still, the amount of wanking Harry snuck into lunch-hours and the moments when Draco left and he had fifteen minutes before he had to be somewhere—he felt fourteen again.
The word buggering was used in headlines for the first time in decades. Then came every shred of information concerning Harry and Draco as a unit. Every event they'd attended "together" was pored over with a fine-toothed comb. Rumoured drug use and claims of excessive drinking abounded. Had Grimmauld Place been used as a perverted ground zero, an ultra-secret bathhouse for the wizarding bourgeoisie? People crawled out of the woodwork with anonymous quotes about sightings—the Halloween party, in particular, was a rich breeding ground for gossip, though nothing solid ever took shape.
"Coming," Harry yelled back. He was hidden by weeds and long grasses behind the Burrow, close enough to a gnome-hole that he could hear one mumbling epithets as it nibbled on the roots of the sweet grass it furiously ripped up. He'd only meant to take a look at a bit of fence that kept tipping over but once he'd mended it, the soft-looking fields and the evening breeze called to him to lay down for a while, so he did. Arms crossed behind his head, he settled in and let his mind wander, eyes trained on the wisps of white cloud passing by as another long summer day shifted smoothly to dusk.
, and that could take a good part of Friday day to do."
"Alaska," said Harry, at last. "Or France. Australia. Madagascar? I don't know; they're all new to me." Harry played with the condensation on his glass, fingers leaving blank trails between the water spots. "I mean, I've never taken a vacation, now that I think about it."
Harry shrugged. "I'm okay. I think the angry part might come later. It's alright. For you to talk about it."
"Look at this, Bensen up to it again," Draco said, shoving a section of the Daily Prophet under Harry's nose for inspection. "Saying regulations are needed to control the movement of trolls across borders." His tone implied that this was a self-evidently stupid concept.
"I asked you about this morning. It's Saturday," Harry said. Draco rolled his eyes.
"Fine, then, do it. I don't care." Harry's voice sounded cold, even to his own ears. He was embarrassing himself but couldn't stop now. "Do it so you can bring me to bed."
His arms jut at right angles out from his ribs, and Draco takes in the shiny red welts across both of his forearms.
“Right,” Harry said. He adjusted on his seat of stone, the cold leaching through denim. He gave a twist to his wand and the flames at the base of the washbasin flared, blasting dry heat against his face.
"No. Nope. Not doing this." Malfoy threw his cigarette and ground it out with a vicious twist of his heel before turning, marching away to wrench the door to the club open.
He withdrew his hand and stood back, wanting to laugh nervously, to say something to fill the air. Comment on the weather. Not that the staring-into-each-others-eyes for the last however many minutes hadn't felt, well, soul-baring. But now that the crisis had passed, Harry was utterly unsure of how the next part was supposed to go. The—heaven forbid—talking bit.
"—squeeze," Harry said into an empty room. He listened as Malfoy's booted footsteps fell heavily down the hall, then up a staircase. A door banged loudly into a wall. Then came the groan of water as it rushed through pipes.
Draco scoffed when Harry shook his head.
, but neither Harry nor Bill said it.
"Oh, gods," Draco whispered, "fuck, Harry. Fuck."
"Yours, all yours," Harry said, and Draco was grinding and barely pulling out anymore, pushing as deep as he could, snaking a hand between them to fist at Harry's cock, stiff against his belly. Draco's hand pulled frantically, jerking him to the point of no return.
"Take me home."
"What?"
part was when my darling boyfriend sang—do you know what karaoke is?" He asked the Healer, who nodded, lowering his wand. Draco was too elated by his story to notice that his expression was turning serious, but Harry caught it, and it winded him.
“Welcome back, Mr Potter,” the
"About that, it seems a bit steep considering I only asked you on the case yesterday. And if not that, what's so important that you've got to ring me this morning, then? I'm sorry I was ignoring you, I try to keep—"
wrong, and he knew it, because Draco wasn't replaceable. Not that this realization stopped Harry from losing time to looking, and to wanking with the voracity he’d skipped over during his teen years, often looking up and being surprised that the sun had gone down, hours simply gone, sacrificed to the search.
They looked at one another, and Harry was overwhelmingly thankful.
Bill smiled broadly, clearly amused. "I did honestly want to see that you were getting on."
"Look, I'll never be cross with you for saying it," Harry gestured towards the front room and followed Charlie inside. "I've got to ask though, was there anything else he wanted to say? Cause it's not me he should be passing messages along to."
"Last night. You were dosed by some idiot. What they wanted with you considering your lack of—let's be judicious and call it house-training—is anyone's guess. I couldn't leave you to die some tragic death, so I brought you here to watch over you."
"Do you want me to go into detail?" he asked.
"Is the window a reflection of what it's really like outside, or is it a simulation?" Harry asked. Collins turned to regard it, shrugged his shoulders.
"Guys, no, please, I just—" Harry started, but Hermione continued to speak over him.
"A good scream is just as good when you need it," she added sagely. Harry nodded as though this too made sense. Sometimes that was best with Luna—to just go along with the oddity for the time being. Her pearls of wisdom usually made sense in their own time.
of his arrival. He didn't seem interested in acknowledging Harry at all, and Harry took the long silence to even his breaths and holster his wand, casting a warming charm at his feet, though it wouldn't be enough to keep them from wrinkling from the wet pavers beneath them. Draco selected a new piece, a massive lampshade of blue-green glass, leaded panes of a repeating diamond shape, and he paced and growled with frustration when it didn't break the way he'd hoped for. It smashed with a kind of dull sound, rather than the tinkling of glass Harry had expected.
Harry returned to his letter to Luna, asking how sales were and if she was free for some flying in the coming days when the buzzing returned.
and then the line went dead, and his heart would sink again. So he clicked, and clicked, and clicked, and eventually gave in to temptation and set up a meeting with someone who described themselves just the way he wanted—
It was only kissing, but Harry could hardly trust his legs to keep him upright as he staggered back until the wall caught him, something sturdy in the assault on his senses.
"Don't be daft," he said, guffawing. "Could I summon Kreacher for another drink, Harry? Even the whisky tastes better now—or is this actually better whisky?"
"No amount of counselling could cure his brand of dickishness. Do wizards even do counselling? Is that a thing?" Harry wondered aloud.
, Potter?"
"I will once you start paying attention. The sooner you hold on to me, the sooner I can put you to bed, now come on."
"Don't worry about it," he said, "this was bound to happen eventually. The most important thing right now is that we both smile, alright? If they catch us doing anything other than smiling, they'll run a story breaking down how my frown speaks to how you're a tyrant, and your stony look gives away your, I don't know, black heart or whatever."
"Never better," he answered, following Draco out to take their places at the table.
Malfoy held his eye now. The air smelled like static and ozone. Harry had to be very, very careful.
"Within rules and reason, you know?"
"Hi," Harry responded. He was glad not to be touched too much; he felt sharp, on edge, like his skeleton didn’t quite fit inside his skinsuit. This was the feeling that made him avoid hugs, and conversations about how he was doing and sent him drinking till he couldn’t see. But that was before. It was a long time since his skin had crawled with the feeling. It wasn't until he raised a hand from his thigh that he realized from the dark stain left behind that his palms were profusely sweating.
Draco huffed a laugh and pressed a kiss to the spot behind Harry's ear.
Harry bristled at the thought. It was always like this—non-disclosure agreements fluttering in on even his most casual interactions with people outside his inner circle. Harry shook his head vehemently.
Kreacher tottered out with minimal grumbling, and the men were careful not to slip into a bemused discussion about his behaviour, as who knew where he'd really gone. Harry was quite certain that Kreacher spent more time hovering just outside rooms than in them.
"Teddy then, can we settle on Teddy?" With a healthy dose of nodding, Draco continued, "Well, Teddy, what happened to my hand was an accident. I was messing about with potions that I oughtn't to have been, and I got hurt. But it's alright now."
the word for it when Draco blushed under his wire-frame glasses and quickly changed the subject.
Draco gave him a look from beneath low lids. "Try again next week, and Victoria sends me our press clippings."
"Could have fooled me," Malfoy cut him off, "though your interview was something. Must be handy having the editor-in-chief of a major publication in your back pocket."
"How is it, then, by the way?" Ron ignored the barb and continued to feign nonchalance even though Harry could tell he cared very deeply about the subject at hand. "I know it doesn't count for much, and you're going to do what you're going to do in the end no matter what we say—"
And there was something wrong with him; there had to be, the way his cock leaked when the Dark Mark was hovering within the field of his vision as Draco gently fisted his hair, his other hand pulling his cock free. Its tip was dark pink as he took it in his own fist and pumped the length a few times. When Draco's hand dipped lower to fondle his bollocks, Harry leaned forwards and nuzzled against the hard shaft, filled with pleasure at the silky feel of it bumping against his nose, the wet streak left where it brushed his cheek. He inhaled, his eyes sliding shut.
"Don’t move," Harry spoke into the dip of her neck and shoulder. He had to let go of his own prick to hold her still, hand a wet anchor at her waist. Cissy flinched when their fingers touched, Harry's dipping just inside, turning one to three, and it was Harry's turn to chuckle.
"There, is that better?" Harry allowed something other than a scowl to slide across his face. So what if a photographer caught one photo of him almost-smiling at his boyfriend? It was dinner. He'd been under intense scrutiny all day, and now the part where he was in the spotlight was meant to be over. People couldn't expect him to spend the entire day and night stony-faced, could they?
Not that she could know that his reaction was prompted by his recent, sudden, unbidden, absolutely uncalled for and deeply unsettling attraction to a certain blond. No, he reassured himself; she didn’t know. She couldn't read his thoughts.
Draco grasped for it again as Harry stumbled back, staying just out of reach. He stopped and huffed, his bottom jaw jutting forwards, eyes wide.
them all, sharing a look with Draco. "You're all terrible—he clearly never did that. All this tripe is going to your heads."
Harry slapped Malfoy’s hands away and waited for a beat to ensure that he’d given up. The floorboard creaked as he knelt, and he stilled every part of his body other than his hands. Malfoy sat up, allowing Harry to unwind criss-crossed cord from the upper hooks of his boots before he continued down to loosen the rest.
She gave him a pained look, as though explaining something to a dim-witted child.
"Ghosts," Draco said cryptically. "Not the kind in the Great Hall right now. The kind that live with you. You were with Snape when he died, weren't you?"
She wrapped him in a tight embrace as they stood to leave, stray hairs tickling his nose.
Harry realized that Draco was muffling the sounds that kept trying to escape his throat. He brushed his lips against Draco's jaw.
"Just to slash. Ready to ship out? Has anyone lost any limbs? No? Mobiles, keys, wallets? Alright," he wrangled the most likely-looking jackets in the most likely-seeming directions, located a lost shoe for Padma, and lip-gloss of Pansy's off the floor, and had the group bundled up and completely out the door when a finger tapped him on the shoulder.
It was something he was working on. It didn’t mean he had to like it.
. The dot of maroon disappeared.
A thought came to Harry.
fine, so we stop turning over the rocks in his garden, so to speak.”
"This is fixable," he said, and the surety in his voice wasn't faked. "We can fix this. I believe that we can fix this."
"It's not right for me to get possessive of you," Harry said. He grit his teeth, trying to parse out how to turn his feelings into words that he could live with.
"I prefer to take my exercise the same way French women do." Malfoy shared a knowing look with Harry before he dropped his voice down and leaned across the table to whisper.
Draco redoubled his grip on the bit of leather connecting Harry’s biceps and pulled him down as he pressed his prick up, into his body. The feeling of absolute fullness made him thrum and groan unabashedly.
"That bad, eh? Hangover Cure not cutting it for you?"
Harry craned his neck back and let his laughter loose at the ceiling, the sound of it echoing back, the skylight a canvas of the blue-purple of orchids bleeding into the blackness of night.
"You're in charge," he said, and Draco rolled his eyes and turned, stepping out of the car and slamming the door. He stood in the cool spring air, stood straight as a pin and without a shiver, as though the elements couldn't sway him.
Charlie flicked a look over to Draco and Harry, and then back to Ron. "First, he's half-cut on Dad's stock of rye. Second, Andromeda and Ted are leaving, and he asks him if he's excited for dance class and when he says yes, he tells him to be careful because it's for ponce's and he should stick to quidditch instead."
"Bit late for that," Neville said, gripping his pint glass so hard that Harry was afraid it might implode.
"I couldn't stop looking at your mouth. It was driving me insane—
"Tough crowd," he said, sighing. "I'd say you've been given some dodgy ecstasy by someone who thought it would help them take advantage of you. It's probably cut with speed—everything in East London is at this point. Muggle drugs, nothing to worry about too much once you get some water in. It's generally quite fun, actually, ecstasy. A couple of years ago, I would have killed to be in your shoes. Free drugs! Though, not of the non-consensual variety, that's quite—" and then he cut himself off with a gagging sound.
"What in the fuck are you doing?" The blond swatted away Harry's hand. His hand, he realized too late, that had reached out without his brain permitting it.
"I can’t give you much, and I’m—I’m still basically a virgin, how it counts. I feel like I'm a disappointment and can’t keep up with you, and I don’t want to keep this up if you don’t want to as well. You don’t owe me anything. What we agree to is fucking, when convenient, and it's been fantastic. If it’s just fucking that you want, I’ll deal with that on my own." Harry swallowed around the pit in his throat, a scratchy, painful thing. He needed to force the last words out before he lost the nerve, so he closed his eyes and pushed through. "But I want, still. I want you, still, even though it’s wrong of me to think I deserve you."
"Uh, Ron? You okay there?"
"I know exactly who you are," he said gruffly, his thin top lip pulled back with disdain. Draco’s smile didn’t falter for a moment as he withdrew his hand and put it in his pocket, easy as could be.
As it was, he turned to the stalls to his left and kept walking. A young bloke in a Spurs jersey swayed as he washed his hands, blearily staring down at the water rushing over them. White and green tiles were missing where pipes from the line of urinals met the floor, more so as he continued walking. Five stalls, enough that they were never all in use at once, with the lights burnt out over the last two. Harry tucked his chin to his chest as he stepped to the last stall, eyes landing on a pair of well-shined dragon-leather boots. The sound of blood rushing filled his ears, breathing shaky as he steeled himself, summoning courage he didn't feel as he pressed open the door.
this, Harry was sure of it.
“Haven’t you ever burned yourself before?” Draco asks the question quietly. He tentatively releases Harry’s wrists, and when he doesn’t instantly pull his arms away, Draco steps back and crosses his arms. Gives him space.
"Now, are you going to tell me why you're up here exactly, or not?" Ron asked. Harry blinked and breathed, rocking back and forth until he could trust his throat to carry words up and out again without them cracking.
"They are. They're supposed to be. Remind me to never agree to back-to-back interviews by Floo ever again. My bloody
Harry gave a clenched smile, pissed that he was a head and a half shorter than the oaf that had played with Draco’s heart for so much longer than he’d had the chance to get to know him properly.
She'd had to practically hex him to go see a Mind Healer at first. Harry could see now that they hadn't been a good fit, and it hadn't been the right time for him, rather than that he'd been unfixable.
Draco leans forward enough to check that he hasn’t spilt any on the carpet, and sees that his partner has had the foresight to paint the inside of his trousers instead. A sticky mess for a Muggle to deal with, but whatever gets him off.
Harry heard the words but didn't understand them.
"That's what you're focusing on, out of all that?" Harry asked incredulously. Malfoy nodded. "
Harry pressed fingertips to the centre of his chest. "
"But what are you doing? Do you think it's somehow your job to keep the place open?"
"Jesus
"Indeed. He'll be perfectly safe there, I can assure you. Lucius Malfoy will already be visiting another property, I've been told."
"If possible. I’d rather not leave the two of us finding ourselves in these situations to chance, do you?"
Harry took his hand, heart beating in his throat as the bass pounded ever louder, and pulled him up to stand. "Let's find out."
Draco withdraws his hand from the cage. Harry lowers onto his forearms and Draco’s heart sings, knowing his good boy will be poised and ready for his master to play with him soon enough.
Harry smiled up at her. It was so
"How about a taxicab, then?" His voice wavered. It was dangerous, standing an arm's length away, even.
He gave an agonized groan and came as Harry tugged fast, faster, come pulsing out thick and hot across Harry's nose and cheek, his lips.
, who cries before a party, anyway?"
“S’my journal,” Harry mumbled into his chest. “And, and—s’bout me. It makes me happy if you’re happy,” Harry said. “You need anything,
"Trying to what, you absolute nutter?" Harry asked. Draco stared at the sky, exasperated.
He began balding from the stress of it at twenty, the shower drains suddenly a mess, as though he were grooming crups at home—an empty spot the size of a knut still hid inside the wild nest of his hair. By the time of his graduation ceremony at a tender twenty-two, he'd developed a predilection for panic attacks and a severe drinking habit.
He took a deep breath and let it out in a long sigh. When he faced Harry, he was the absolute picture of calm.
"Before you go," Justin reached out and touched his elbow.
, Harry was always quick to remind himself. He had no proof, of course, but it fit a pattern, the kind of pattern that only Harry had ever been able to see. Things around him cracked and broke all the time, and others were too kind to attribute the breakage to him, but he knew in his heart when things were his fault, and at least this time, he knew what he could do to fix it.
"Alright," Harry said. He knocked their shoulders together and stared at his trainers. "I'd hug you, but I'm drained, and I'm afraid I'll do it wrong."
Draco touched his own cheekbone, dragged the finger down to the corner of his mouth, and then along his jaw.
“Hi,” he says. When he passes the kitchen his nostrils flare and he falters.
"First cousin, once removed," Draco dried his cheeks and sat forward, elbows at his knees. "It’s a pureblood thing. You’ve got to keep tabs on who you’re related to lest you end up slightly more inbred than the rest of the Sacred Twenty-Eight."
story—suddenly, there he was. Draco, gripping the banister as he took the last few stairs, his eyes sweeping the room and locking onto Harry's.
He smelled divine, and as Harry pressed his cheek to the soft twill of his trousers, he couldn't help but think that like this, when they were alone, Draco became something divine to him. A god, worthy of worship if only to be able to gaze upon his feet. It became a pleasure to give him what
He opened his mouth to speak as Draco said, "Thanks for that."
Harry made a sound and nodded, swallowing hard. “I do. I like hearing you say fuck,” he added, looking up at the long line of Draco's torso above him.
"Not such a bad idea, actually. Ties in nicely with the push for a wing at Mungo's. And there's the added bonus for shaming the Ministry by beating them to it."
Draco rubbed at his eyes and shuffled down under the covers. "Time for bed, I think. We have about a half-hour before the Dreamless Sleep kicks in, but it's good to try to beat it to the punch.
"I will never hurt you, pet. I refuse," Draco said, his voice breaking on the last word.
"Right as rain," Harry called back. And it was. It really was.
"A urinal? Seriously, Potter?"
Home was safe, but it was also a trap, and an easy one to fall into. Victoria gifted him a laptop for Christmas, pre-doused in the potion to keep it from dying a similar death to his first one—
"That's what Hermione said." It took a second, but Ron cracked a little smile too. The water was still running, so Harry wasn't all there in the room with him, but he had enough wherewithal to add that he was sorry about what was happening.
"Just looking for something to transfigure into a toothbrush," Harry said, and then he caught himself, winced at the words. It was a lie, even if it felt like the right thing to say, it wasn't, not anymore. "No, that's not it, entirely. To be honest, I don't know what I'm looking for. What it is you don't want me to find?"
"Thing?" Malfoy offered the word.
did something to Harry, possessiveness spiking deep in his belly.
an explanation."
Long fingers gripped either temple, and fair eyelashes fluttered shut.
"Don't touch us; we'll have you nicked!" The shorter boy shouted as he struggled to his feet. His companion rolled on the ground, clutching at his head. It had taken most of the brunt of his backwards fall. His hands came away clean, not smeared red. Harry's stomach unclenched slightly.
"Take yours out now," he whispered, and Cissy obediently did. She was shaky now, cock filling out again, a thick bulge, wet spot growing.
Harry made tea mechanically, his hands moving between the tasks with practised ease that brought him back to childhood. He gathered vegetables for a crudité, creamed paprika into chopped eggs, and stuck a knife in a crumbly parmesan slab. He did so in ways that would make Aunt Petunia self-immolate if she could see him and which were, therefore, his preferred methods for doing so. Though his day had taken a turn to the surreal, the familiar motions brought him a dependable sense of calm.
“What?”
"You two are the fucking worst friends, it's friends off after this," he muttered, "I'm never telling you anything again." Hermione merely increased her volume to speak over him.
Harry frowned, confused.
“Draco? What’s the matter?”
"I'm asking now, and it's the only time I'll ask politely. What's happened, pet?" Draco waited patiently through the long pause.
"I'm aware. I'm on the board," Harry smiled through gritted teeth as his friends made appreciative sounds. Harry turned to stare at Hermione, hoping that he was appropriately telegraphing
“You have to let go,” Draco whispers. He watches, rapt, as his favourite dog plays with his favourite toy. He’s the cutest when he struggles to wag, to impale himself on the bulge of the plug. It doesn’t have much give and it isn’t small by any means, so struggle, he does.
"Thanks for leaving it out for me. I might honestly be dead without it." Harry gratefully took a bowl with shaky hands. Even with the potion, he was still delicate, studiously avoiding strenuous work and brightly lit rooms.
"He wants you. The way he's slobbering over you over there, it's disgusting."
"I took a look at who signed off on the requests. They started after you quit, and it was Chief Superintendent Moran who did it, but yeah. You can read into that what you will."
"I'm sorry but, you're a wizard, right? I, I'm not doing so well. I think I need St. Mungo's—"
Malfoy rears up as his frown deepens.
good together, don't you think?"
"Former," Harry blurted. Dean gave him a funny look.
, and Draco’s favourite,
Harry bit his lip as he thought about it. About the hidden things—the drawer next to his bed stuffed with pictures and locked with a Permanent Sticking Charm; the hearthstone hiding a preponderance of notes from the future he envisioned for them; the secret place that G had discovered, tucked away in the heart of the house.
"This is my stop then, too!" she squealed. Harry closed his eyes and prayed for patience, disembarking behind the three of them.
tomorrow. That for him, there was nothing casual at all going on. Harry knew that Draco thought he'd found control over their little lives, had tricked himself into the lie that life itself was controllable. And Harry pulled the practised smile back into place as he praised Matilda for her choice in the restaurant and avoided Blaise's meaningful looks because it was going to be up to Harry to wrest the illusion of control from Draco's hands.
A much more urgent soon was dealing with Draco's skewed sense of self and health and time. Harry quickly learned that even with a bladder painfully full, even that wasn't enough of a signal to Draco that perhaps he should stretch his legs, take a tour of his flat. That he would go eight, ten hours without pissing seemed impossible until Harry realized that Saturday that he'd done just that, literally not leaving the couch until Harry had noticed and forced him up, his face contorted with the sudden onslaught of pain once he noticed the pressure that had built inside him, the backlog making his kidneys sore. Like Harry, mornings seemed more manageable, and the day became more challenging as it progressed. Taking care of him was like minding a child, complete with reminders to get up and go to the loo, and forcing him to drink water. He had to be fought with to change out of the same singlet and jumper that he'd worn the day before and the day before that and the day before that.
"Oh fuck off, Pan, nobody invited you anyway." Draco sat at an elegant angle on the bed, sparing Harry a tetchy look that almost worked; he dropped his duelling stance, but not his wand-arm.
, and I don't know how to fix it." Harry looked to Blaise, blurry without his glasses, but could tell that he was being given a knowing smile. He took Harry by the bicep and gave him a bracing squeeze.
Draco waited rather than prodding, and after a few false starts, Harry found the words he needed. He spoke them to his navel.
"You two, you just love your little joke," Harry couldn't help but sulk. He sat up straight again, only to watch both Ron and Hermione dissolving into laughter over the incident for what felt like the hundredth time.
"And the yoga? You've been at that for over an hour, I assume? How many calories is that?"
"Oh, for fucks sake, it's the ink from my book.
of his flat.
"No, I'm sorry. That came out wrong."
, and all," he added sarcastically.
"I was accepted by the Ministry, by the way. I quite nearly signed the contract, and that's what dredged all this shite up. It's got to do with this," he said, brandishing his burned arm with a look of boredom.
"Your biography? At
Water feels impossibly good when you're high, and he ends up with palms to cool tile, and you finger him without intention. He winces but holds your hand still and pushes in for more. A swirl at the rim makes him hiss, his eyes smouldering pits of black.
"By a
Draco shook his head a little. "No. Normally I need to concentrate on listening in, but with you, it just happens. Happened—it wasn't like this at school. At school, I could barely hear you."
"Shut. Up."
"—the Ministry, obviously." Draco continued as though nothing happened, rounding the table and walking back as Harry fought to keep his breathing even.
"But I'm happy to try. What is it you want to talk about?"
"You were young," Mr Weasley offered.
"Let's go to yours," Harry mumbled. "I want to wake up in your bed tomorrow." Draco didn't say anything as they stepped up to the spot, grasping him close as he jumped them away.
Draco shrugged. He moved the settings before him around so everything sat at neat right angles. Napkin next to spoon next to saucer, exactly an inch between all of them.
“You’re just scared,” Not Draco's breathing is going off, sobbing starting up. It begins quietly but Harry watches it progress until he can barely take sips of air between cries, coughs around mucous building up in his throat.
, it's all so—" he fluttered a hand, "twee."
“Sorry, it’s like—”
, could swallow without pain. It took only a minute to school his features until his chin smoothed out from the form of a peach pit it had taken, so close as he'd come to sobbing, and then he opened the door and walked on to face his fate.
"Pet, honestly. Perhaps you play some game where you pretend that we have magical holes that are just for sex, and other ones for our bodies primary physical needs, but I don't. I like men, and I like fucking men, and I, for one, find no reason to divorce what our arses usually do from what I like to do with them. It's truly not a big deal."
he thought. He couldn't conjure Draco's voice to keep him from indulging in his bad habits, lately, because it hurt too much.
"Oh. My god."
"If he were, you would have told me, just to rub it in."
The man stalked up to him and then turned on his heel, letting out a growling yell. "Of all the men in all the queer bars in all of
“I do
Many things happened at once. The ground under his left, searching foot just wasn't there anymore, and the sick, swooping feeling of the earth giving way to air caught him by surprise as he realized that he was falling. It was an incongruous feeling, as falling through blackness gave the impression of falling forever, but it was over in a second as the blackness of the powder faded away and the reality of more ground beneath him became apparent as he fell into it, the wind knocked from him in a powerful blow. He rolled—once, twice, a trunk smashing across his middle back in an explosion of pain—and then he stopped at the foot of an oak, its twisted roots a gnarled bed beneath him.
; he loved that Draco never found him to be too much, and he
Pansy remained silent as a young Auror with a bath towel soaked crimson with blood under his nose passed them. He didn't try to keep from staring directly at Harry, nearly walking into the far wall.
His phone started buzzing, and he ignored it in favour of leaving a good impression on the child.
Harry ignored the question. "Did you go as a Veela for Halloween? Bit weird, to go as a creature, don't you think?" The words were laced with derision that wasn't warranted. "You going in for the rights of Beings, and all."
"The lunches with Pansy," Harry said haltingly, and Draco barked a laugh. His lips had a purplish tinge from the cold seeping in, the skin of his cheeks stretched too thin over the scaffolding of his bones. November had passed in such a similar way to October and September before them, yet Draco seemed to be slipping away, like bits of him were being chipped off. Harry wanted to fill out the gaps and blur his edges, but he hadn’t yet found the source of his diminishing.
"Was that so hard?" Harry asked. Draco closed his eyes and gave a pained smile.
Hermione had to be the one to firecall Harry and tell him of Ron and George's blow-out, knowing that Ron wouldn't bring it up on his own. It had started with George citing worries that the new karaoke boxes might somehow be tied back to having been "tested by Death Eaters", which was a paltry cover for his real feelings about the gradually warming reception Draco was receiving. Apparently, they'd spoken about it on multiple occasions since then, and those conversations had culminated during a yelling match at the back of the Wheezes shop, where Ron had shown his allegiance to Harry with unwavering loyalty. And so it came to be that George was added to the pile along with Percy, of brothers he wasn't currently speaking to.
A wide grin broke across Draco's face, promising nothing but debauchery.
He hugged her goodbye, knowing that each time he did from now on it would chip another little piece from his heart to do it.
"It's a lot of work, to hate someone," he said, concentrating on the thumb's throbbing pain. He couldn't look at Malfoy. "I don't particularly like you, but it's not the same."
"If he's good at everything he does, and you're but a hobby, that must mean he's doing you well—or is it doing well by you? Sayings in English will forever elude me."
"It’s only been two weeks if you don’t count—"
"Rush order for pickup," she called over her shoulder, returning to her conversation.
"Open your eyes."
Draco leaned back and loosened the knot of his tie.
"Oh. Heroin," he said like he was choosing between paper and plastic at checkout. "And for whatever reason, Harry, none of this disgusts you, though it should. The real reason they carted me off to convalesce in Surrey was that even though I considered Kronenbourgs dinner, I threw up whatever real food I did eat because I lost control. I was a mess back then, and it made me feel better. And maybe, I thought that I'd die slightly faster that way—not too fast, not the razors in the bath kind, because I could never bring myself to do that, but to speed up the inevitable, you know?"
“Breath play is extra,” he murmurs, head a drooping thing, a flower at the end of a broken stalk.
Draco swallowed, coming back to himself. "Once more. Let’s go to five. Tight, but not enough to totally restrict breathing. It’s more about pressure on the sides than the front, really, so use your thumb and fingers here," he touched at spots just under Harry’s ears to demonstrate, "rather than tightening the belt much further. Muggles are mad to do this, you can fucking die, but us? We're going to be fine, there's nothing that your
Harry physically bit his tongue. It was obvious what he was doing, but he didn't want to lose his temper, because anger wasn't how he really felt at that moment. Anger was simply the most easily accessible outlet for the messy, squirming feelings swimming through his system for the last hour and a half. Under the annoyance and worry, and the deep, chilling fear, under all that was love. He summoned that and pushed out words that weren’t accusatory or cruel. A simple answer, to start.
"It's fine," Harry said. The voice that came from him was strong, even though he felt insignificant. Like a ghost, a person becoming vapour.
"I overheard them talking about me in the break-room," Draco continued, unaware of the effect he was having on Harry. "I think it's hilarious."
"Oh," said Harry. The crinkles grew deeper.
"And this?" He tapped his fist. "What do you do with this?"
not a nightmare."
"Honestly? No, you look like my cat's sick twice warmed over."
because of how I can tell that it distresses you, and I want to remove all bother from your life. I could stay inside with you forever if the world would let us. And now, after—well let's not dwell on the past, but I know now that if I lose you, I could hardly contemplate going on without you, and you said it yourself, you told me that you can't read my mind, so I'm telling you now that I love you, very much. Enormously, intensely, it's troubling, really. This is me, telling you, and for god's sake will you please say something?"
“Clever enough to get what I want.” Draco raised a brow and dipped his gaze to the situation emerging below Harry’s belt.
The portrait was one that Draco had pointedly overlooked. Harry requested him to develop it in black and white rather than full colour and had enlarged the final print until Draco's shoulders in the photo were nearly as broad as they were in real life.
“Have you been good?” he asks. The door to the crate is ajar and Draco closes it, drops the hook into the latch. He doesn’t bother with the lock—it’s not for punishment, anyway. Crate training is meant to avoid destructive behaviour.
“I’m not crying,” Harry said, at last. The words sounded to his ears like they came from someone else’s lips. His feet were rooted to the spot, though the more he processed how this had come to be, the stronger his urge was to bolt.
Harry's hands shook as he freed the hem of his shirt and took it up and over his head. He forgot to undo the buttons at his neck and stopped, stuck. The sound of Draco's snort-laugh in the darkness reminded him that even now, he could laugh too.
The papers kept spinning their wheels about the "notoriously private" young saviour, because Harry Potter was a known quantity, squeaky clean, did what he was told, on his way to head the Auror department one day if he kept at it like this. They wondered who he'd bring along to the top with him. A pretty young thing, like a Muggle-born movie star? A Quidditch captain? An up-and-coming political marvel? Harry believed it too. Had spent the last five years splitting his time between hiding in plain sight in Muggle parts of town and being the most famous person in London's magical society. Had gone on dates, dozens of polite, nice-to-meet-you-but-the-chemistry-just-isn't-there dates, with many lovely ladies. Had become incredibly adept at breaking himself into the parts no one got to see—weekends spent fixing up a house that he hated and yet felt obligated to, stuck trying to brighten up space even when he was too depressed to get out of bed half the time. The derelict sadness that wafted from its very walls gradually came to match his situation's profound loneliness, and he grew to accept it. He was as much Grimmauld Place as it was him. A mausoleum of sorts. A place few visited, fewer knew.
, you always know how to get under my skin." He brushed a lock of hair away from Draco’s face, the one that refused to behave. "I’m happy you told me the truth, you know."
"You should talk to him," she said, and Harry knew her meaning.
Draco looked hard at Harry. The scrutiny was difficult to stand—he always made Harry feel transparent when he looked,
Harry didn’t mind being burdened with other people’s pain because, if anything, he was built to take it. Born to, even. He could eat Draco's pain. If Draco could stand this, he could too.
"Draco," Harry blurted the name, so used to correcting himself. Ron pursed his lips, ready to retort, and then his face relaxed.
"What now?" Harry asked.
"Did you want to try with this, then?"
Harry spluttered. "I didn't—We didn't
Harry covered for the stab to the heart that the word
"No," Harry heaved a vast sigh, deciding he could spit it all out if only he didn't have to look at either of them. Continuing to pick apart the crumb of his cake would suffice as a distraction.
"Noted."
"Pity," Draco said under his breath, peering closely at a photo of Harry backstage on his graduation day. "There's about a thousand tucked into photo books at the manor, to complement the hundred or so mum had framed."
"Eager, are we?" Draco drawled. The stones were tumbling ever harder, big rocks. Harry was thankful for the ribbing.
"And then I realized that it made sense for the Black's, likely one of the most paranoid wizarding families of the last few decades, to live in a house that no one could find. And it made sense when we were being hunted during the war, and afterwards, so I had someplace to hide. But now," he grinned, remembering the free feeling he had after coming out, so like flying or falling, or both, all jumbled up together, "living in a hidden house is an act for someone who feels the need to be hidden, and I don't want to hide anymore. So I owled Mr Sparks, and he had the spell unwound. It's still one of the most heavily warded buildings in Great Britain, only now you can bring a friend when you visit and not worry about the hassle of inviting them in."
for my nausea," she said, covering her eyes with a hand. "And the lighting in here leaves something to be desired."
"This is nice," he said. "Nothing happened. I wanted to feel more, that's all."
"Last night. Me, being the piece of shit that I am, brought you back here before you were totally incoherent, and you wanted to sleep on the sofa. But it's much easier to replace a set of sheets than an entire piece of furniture, so here you are."
(See the end of the chapter for
, a yes with a caveat that he'd have to check his diary to find when to slot it in, but of course, yes, always yes, now. It freed Harry of the
If Draco's lips had been hovering on a smile, he scowled properly now. "Don't you dare go mincing words around me."
He squeezed rhythmically and forgot to hate himself for the shudder of joy that surged in him. To have his hands soaked in the warmth that was Draco’s flesh. Left the mindset of the practical to let himself have this moment.
Draco rolled his eyes and took his seat, smoothing the pleats in his trousers over his thighs.
"Now hand over that bill before you conveniently forget that I owe you more than, you know,
"So you've been single since the Weasley break-up?"
Another thing Harry was accustomed to now—feeling the ridges of the Dark Mark on Draco's forearm while his hands slid over his body. He felt angry about how it got there, but little about the thing itself—it had become nothing more than an unsightly tattoo. A reminder that the past remained with them in the present.
if you want to, or
The lilt of his voice had become less combative. This was the part of the night when he spoke, and Harry listened, but it was the first time he’d verged from the mundane to the personal. It felt like when a beautiful songbird visited the windowsill in the lounge sometimes; if Harry was careful and quiet, he was occasionally allowed the pleasure of its unbridled company for some time.
“I wanted to owl you,” Harry said quietly, “I wanted…"
"But homes are places where you can invite guests," Harry added, slowly. Draco was about to say something when his cell phone buzzed, rattling on the side table.
"You can use the fireplace in my room to Floo home if you want," Malfoy's voice interrupted his thoughts. "I'm sure our clothes are dry by now. Well, dry-ish, but I can tell you're not picky about what you wear."
"Is he this demanding in the sack too? Cause mate, I couldn't hack it."
And there was Draco, staggeringly bright and youthful in comparison, holding out a hand to Harry as the other tucked loose strands of hair behind his ear, asking, "Can I see?"
It was possessive. It was almost a date.
This one is indebted to Andy Shauf.
"You’re a top, right? We could, you know. Share."
Draco takes two steps back and settles on the floor, his back bolstered against the settee. Once comfortable, he unzips his trousers.
Draco recoiled, the smooth lines of his face contorting with outrage. "Who the fuck do you take me for? I'm not angry about that, Potter. Christ, count yourself lucky."
"Okay, well." He sighed, dropped his hands. "I can Apparate you inside yours, then, if you like. If the wards will let me in." Draco made a sound, something low in his throat that signalled that this plan wouldn't suffice. "He doesn't have a key, does he?"
“It hurts me to see you hurt,” Draco says. He brushes the back of a finger over the newly healed skin, and then he stops. Tucks his wand away and steps back. Harry’s getting better with accepting care, but the trick is to keep it incremental.
"When there's pain involved?"
, I don't know, tie you to the bed—"
you, I could st-still see you and
Malfoy licked his lips, said, "I told you before, I've done a lot of growing up. Of course I know what Velcro is. Clever, Muggles, aren't they?"
"It's complicated," he said instead.
"Some. The one on my arm does, sometimes." He was quick to paint a smile on though. "Nothing like yours though, probably, it's barely a thing. I feel silly even, talking about it, I've never really—I didn't even mention that it scarred in my book."
“Are you cursing in Parseltongue?”
Before Harry's hand could re-emerge from his pocket with his wand, Draco drew his own, pointing it and calling out, "
“Sure. Whenever you’re ready to do that, your name would still be on the lease. You’d own it, still. And when you want, you could—" Harry scratched at the back of his neck, wishing for some clothes and using instead the blanket to cover himself. It seemed not done to speak of these things naked, but even covered, he was unsure of how to phrase it. “We could, you know—dig out whatever antiquated lease is on this place, and put your name on it.”
"I said, it's not going to be necessary," he said firmly. He didn't know why he was suddenly so sure that Malfoy wouldn't let the whole debacle slip, if only to his own friends, but his gut told him that he wouldn't. "Don't worry about it. I told Ron and Hermione the details—"
"I've never been enough for you.
Ron scoffed. "Speeches, wrangling drunk uncles. Cold feet."
"I think his apology to me was sincere," Hermione said with finality. Harry gave her as reassuring a smile as he could. "I'm not saying everyone has to forgive him," at this, she flicked a look over to Neville, who steadfastly stared at the feast that had appeared before them. "It's just that I can see that he's working hard to change, and that's enough for me."
"Am I not allowed some fucking privacy in this relationship?"
He was grateful for the voices of his friends; that they understood that he needed to be alone with his thoughts and feelings, but also not alone, and this was how they did it for him. When he finished with the dishes from dinner he cleared the sink and ran the water again, starting in on the pots and pans. Ron and Hermione only stopped talking for a second, then resumed their idle chatter as he vigorously rubbed a copper saucepan clean using nothing but soap and elbow-grease. He knew that the older generation would find it troubling, seeing him there washing up the Muggle way, but it made him feel useful when he otherwise felt useless.
