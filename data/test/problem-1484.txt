“I’m sorry. I need to leave.” He disappeared into the green flames of the Floo, leaving Harry alone and aroused and very, very confused.
“For doing what you wanted for once in your life. I know how hard expectations can be.” But before Harry could respond, Draco had drifted back to sleep. Harry yawned, and decided he would enjoy his first day free with a post-blowjob nap.
He took a shaky breath and wiped his wet eyes. “I’ve lost everything. My mother, my home, my friends. Sometimes, I just can’t bear the weight of the guilt. I did terrible things. I may have done them to survive, but I’m still ashamed. And I miss my mother.”
A single tear ran down his cheek. His stomach hurt, and he wanted to run away. He looked at Harry, who nodded at him reassuringly. “I get nauseous all the time. Everytime I think about anything related to the war. I get these flashbacks to…Well, the slit-nosed bastard lived in my house. Whatever you imagine, I can guarantee you it was worse. And then I get flashbacks to before. My father was an arse. I hate him. I’ve hated him since he made me take the Mark. He’s mean and cruel and deserves far worse than a life sentence.”
Things changed after that Friday. Not just with Harry and Draco, who were almost friends. But with everyone in the therapy session. Even Blaise was saying good morning to Draco when they passed in the corridor.  Draco still hadn’t opened up in therapy, but he was feeling less alone. He wasn’t the only one struggling. Harry hadn’t said much either. But Hermione had surprised everyone the following Wednesday.
“I have good news, too,” Ron said. “Mum couldn’t stomach the thought of you and Harry alone here on Christmas. She’s invited you. And your Auror friend, Steve. Andromeda, Remus, and Teddy are coming, too.”
He threw his head back as he felt the tip of Draco’s slick cock rub against his entrance. He pushed back as Draco pushed in, guiding him in as far as he would go. Draco moved slow, too slow, until Harry shouted, “Fucking give it to me, Malfoy!”
Harry tried not to admire Draco’s arse even more as they walked, but he couldn’t help it. He’d deal with those conflicting feelings later. Instead, he cleared his throat.
Remus stepped aside, and Harry’s smile fell. Draco Malfoy sat at the edge of the eighth year table, looking like he was ready to bolt at any moment. All of the eighth years froze, glaring at him.
He pictured her in his mind and tugged on his dick. But he couldn’t hold the image. He imagined Ginny and that time she had tied him up with their ties. Yeah, that worked for a bit. But then she changed to Charlie Weasley, and Harry came in a moment.
“Finally, we have added three Healers to our staff, and they will be arriving tomorrow. These healers are trained in Mind-Healing. Group therapy is now a required part of your schedules. You will meet with your year and your house three times a week. One day will be dedicated to healthy coping skills. The other two days are for talk therapy. This schedule will be in place for all students until at least the winter holidays. After that, your assigned Healer will decide if, and how often, you need to continue.
Neville turned in his seat with no subtlety. “Hm. Looks like it. I walked into Hogsmeade with Minerva. She just said she had a business meeting.”
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” Draco asked as they Apparated into the garden of the Granger-Weasley household. Harry shook a vicious garden gnome off his foot with string of obscenities.
Draco blinked. Poor bastard thought he was the cause of this shitshow, not the evil noseless tyrant.
When he knew Harry was close, he pulled away and took his bollocks in his mouth. “Shit fuck oh my god!”
“The Malfoy estate will be returned to your ownership with the condition that you sell it. Neither you nor your mother will be allowed to set foot on the property, but you may keep the money you make in the sale. Additionally, we have taken 25% of your inheritance account at Gringotts as reparation. But the rest will be yours at the end of June.”
“Oh, I was waiting for you to say it first. I didn’t want to sound like an idiot.” He gestured to the waiter and requested more wine. “And I do suspect that our relationship isn’t quite typical. So, screw typical timelines.”
“We are all dealing with the trauma of war and the feelings of grief. At Hogwarts, we support each other. We have always been dedicated to raising strong, capable wizards and witches. We hope that by helping you heal from your emotional wounds, we will set you up for a successful, fulfilling life.”
Soon it was time to get ready for Daisy’s party. He had no desire to be around people today, but he would do it for Daisy. He dreaded seeing Ron and Hermione; they would instantly know something was wrong. By the time he showered and dressed, he still had not heard from Draco. He sent along a Patronus with a simple message: “I’ll be ready whenever you want to talk.” Then he collected Daisy’s gifts and headed to the Dursleys.
Draco stared down at his hands. “No, Daisy. I made very bad choices when I was a kid. But thanks to your Uncle Harry, I got a second chance. So now I try to make good choices.”
Harry was laying in a seductive pose on Draco’s bed, propped up on one elbow. He was stark naked, save for a giant red ribbon. “Merry Christmas.”
He gripped Andromeda’s hand tightly as they sat on hard, wooden benches. He listened to wind whirling outside and the occasional scream of insanity from deep inside. A guard occasionally stepped out of a door and called a name; a witch or wizard would get up and follow her through the door to meeting rooms.
“You let me know if you have any issues. Any at all.” Steve pulled Draco into a hug. “Professor McGonagall and the others will try their best to keep you safe. But I know there’s a lot of times when the professors won’t be around.”
The rest of the day passed without event. The workloads for Defense Against the Dark Arts and Charms were rigorous. He knew that the rest of his courses would be the same. The eighth years had all their classes with the seventh years, many of whom vocally hated Draco.
Draco blinked. Only a quarter? He would make that back and more with the sale of Malfoy Manor. He had enough money to take care of his mother, too, should she be left destitute. A lump grew in his throat.
Draco smiled. “Yes. But Harry has an amazing ability to always see the best in everyone. An ability I wish I had.” Particularly right now, Draco thought. “We’ve talked about our pasts extensively. We were friends, and then we were boyfriends. And then we fell in love.”
Harry’s stomach growled as he reached the Floos. He hadn’t cooked all week, instead subsisting on candy bars and dry sandwiches. He really needed to get some groceries this weekend. He yawned and stepped into the flames before stepping out in his living room.
It didn’t take long before both of them were hard. Harry was certain he had never felt anything so hot as Draco’s erection pressed against his through their jeans. They snogged and rutted against each other until their breaths came in short, heavy pants. Harry came first, and he dug his nails into Draco’s back. He groaned into Draco’s ear. That sent Draco over the edge. He sped up his frotting and sucked on Harry’s neck until he came moments later.
She gestured to the two chairs, and Draco sat opposite her. She leaned forward and took his hands in hers. Her nails were grimy, something he had never seen on his mother.
He woke around eight o’clock, confused from a deep sleep. As he tried to regain his senses, Draco Malfoy’s voice filled his living room. Harry looked toward the Floo.
And then Malfoy did something even more unexpected than apologizing. He smiled. The most amazing smile spread across his sharp features and lit up his eyes. In all their years of school together, Harry had never seen Malfoy smile like that. “I would.”
They laughed, and Draco asked how life as an Auror was going. Harry began to lament about the long hours but stopped himself. Draco worked every day to make ends meet.
“Well, she did commit murder. But she was married to a monster of a man and finally had enough. We’ve bonded over being married to men like that.” She cleared her throat. “As you know, I’m allowed visits from my solicitor. I have filed for divorce from your father. It will be official soon, and I am returning to my maiden name.”
Draco wore a stunning grey suit that matched the shade of his piercing eyes exactly. He opted for a black shirt and purple tie. The suit fit him like a glove, accentuating all of his best features. Harry tried not to gape. Draco was one of the hottest men Harry had ever had the pleasure of encountering. When he was satisfied with the fit of Harry’s magically-tailored suit, he held out his arm to Harry.
Every eighth year returned home Saturday except for Harry and Draco. Harry had promised Molly he would come visit plenty during the holiday. But for now, he was glad to have an entire dormitory alone with his boyfriend.
Harry leant forward, willing Campbell on as he sped like a bullet after the golden ball. He was so close, reaching his hand out with his fingers practically brushing the wings…
The room was spacious enough with two double beds and a bathroom. In Harry’s opinion, every hotel room looked very much like every other hotel room but he tried to put an optimistic spin on it. “Look, there’s even a television set. You don’t get those in British wizarding hotels.”
Harry took a deep breath. He wasn’t sure if this was the best way of going about it but he was out of good options. He had to know what was going on.
“Yeah, sorry, mate. The perils of having a four-year-old.” Weasley slapped Harry on the back and then gave Draco a firm handshake. “Good to see you, Malfoy,” he said gruffly.
He made his way from the press tent towards the English camp. The World Cup village was set up like a small city. It was warded to be invisible to anyone who wasn’t a player, staff or family, for privacy and safety. It was centralised around a collection of long tents which housed food, medical and press. Coming off this base were paths that lead to the sixteen camps of the countries that had qualified. To get to the English camp, Harry had to walk past Egypt, Germany, and the United States.
“Are you trying to kill England’s World Cup dreams again, Vik?” Charlie teased fondly, giving Harry a pat on the shoulder. Krum shrugged with a similarly smitten expression on his face. Harry looked from Charlie to Viktor and then back again.
“My camera, Malfoy and the Slytherins took my camera and they won’t give it back!” Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw that, yes, they did seem to be throwing something that looked like a camera back and forth like a quaffle.
Harry felt a swell of an odd combination of pride, affection and grief in his chest. There was something so straightforward and solid about Hermione and Ron’s relationship, and for a long time Harry had thought that that was what he wanted. He’d struggled to understand why he and Ginny couldn’t be like that, but now, watching the two people he loved most in the world marry each other, he got it.
He looked out at the water. The wind was ruffling it and distorting the reflections of the lights. It was strange - six months ago hearing Ginny say that would have sent him into a spiral but now he realised that he felt the same: he missed her but he had no desire to get back together.
“There’s nothing to tell Potter.” He spat, turning sharply and striding out of Harry’s eyesight, leaving him still perched on the toilet, bewildered as to what had just occurred between them.
“Right. Whatever.” Malfoy straightened his robes, lips pursed. There was a bit of awkward silence between them as they stood a few metres apart, staring at each other in the soft torchlight.
“You would have a nanny,” Harry said fondly, resting his arm on the bed so that Draco wouldn’t have to stretch his.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Draco’s face fall slightly. Harry didn’t know what the situation was with Draco and his family, but he was pretty sure they weren’t going to be flying over to nurse him back to health.
About an hour in, Malfoy disappeared and didn’t reappear. Harry wondered vaguely if he should go make sure he hadn’t been kidnapped by a kangaroo or something but he was soon distracted by Wood balancing a shot glass on his forehead.
Harry had no polite reply to that so he just stomped over to his bed and lay down, glaring at the ceiling.
“That’s quite a friend you have there, Mr Malfoy,” the mediwitch witch said with a smile. “I’ll be back with your medication and then you can be discharged.”
Once they had vanished their dishes, Draco retreated to their bathroom to make himself presentable. The process of careful grooming always grounded him. He felt his anxiety seeping away slowly as he went through his routine, the version of himself only seen by Harry soon replaced by something more familiar to the wider world. He wasn’t as young as he used to be but it didn’t bother him like he thought it would. There were faint lines around his eyes and mouth that he pretended to hate, but really he was glad for them: they were evidence of his happiness, years of smiles etched into his face for all to see.
He rode that warm feeling all the way back to the hotel. He hoped that Malfoy would be there so that he could tell him about his conversation with Ginny. He was sure that he’d make a comment of some kind but Harry found he didn’t really mind. He was interested in Malfoy’s opinion. He was also dying to discuss the fact that Harry had used the play that Malfoy had taught him - he was certain that Malfoy would have plenty to say about that.
He tried not to overthink it. Draco could be asleep, or his phone could be dead. He took a deep breath, decided to try again in the morning, and went to bed.
They finally dragged themselves out of bed and down to the kitchen where Una had prepared breakfast for them, although the house-elf herself was nowhere to be seen. They ate quickly, bumping their feet together nervously under the table. Draco finished first and sipped his tea quietly as he watched Harry wolf down his food. Draco was filled with an overwhelming fondness for him — appalling table manners and all. Sitting at the kitchen table with him always reminded Draco of the first time Harry had come here. Draco had felt so unsettled by how well he fit in, how he filled this huge place with life and warmth with just his presence. It had been the first time that Draco had really felt that Lochinvar could be his home, and it had been utterly terrifying.
Harry didn’t get a chance to find out though because the road had ended and they were now driving through the huge stone gates and towards the keep. Harry watched the other buildings that flew past; he was surprised to see a full-sized Quidditch training pitch among them.
“Do what?” Malfoy turned his head slightly to give him a curious look. Harry quickly looked back at the ceiling.
“We’re both professional players, and Quidditch has to come first.” Harry hoped he sounded more sure than he felt.
Ron nodded. “That’s cool. I’m happy for you, mate.” He wrinkled his nose. “But do you have to work it out with the ferret?”
“You know, it’s not your career that will be over if Krum opens his enormous mouth.” Malfoy was shoving his things into his bag, his movements growing more agitated by the second.
Harry nodded his thanks awkwardly and then waited for the man to disappear back behind the counter before he continued his browsing. The next thing that caught his eye was a vintage Cannons magazine which engrossed him for a few minutes, but he could still feel the man’s eyes on the back of his head so he tucked the Cannons magazine and Benjy’s cover under his arm and turned back to the man.
“He was never my ‘chum’,” Harry cut in, and then scowled when he realised he had been goaded. “He’s a pompous showoff whose only contributions to the game of Quidditch are a few good lines at press conferences.”
“No, you want your left hand to be wrapped around a bit more. Hold on.” He dismounted and came over to Harry, using his own hands to rearrange Harry's. It felt like a very unnatural angle for them to be twisted. Malfoy had long, boney fingers with neatly trimmed fingernails. As he wrapped them around Harry’s hands, he felt a little self-conscious of his own chewed up nails.
“Charming. Is this how you usually treat the people you fuck? Because if so I have news,” Malfoy grumbled, rubbing his side.
While the first attempt had gone slightly awry - Harry blamed Malfoy for being difficult - he vowed to keep trying once they got to Melbourne.
Harry didn’t really have an answer for that. He was starting to feel more than a little bit guilty. “I hadn’t really thought about it like that.”
“Well, technically, we didn’t actually fuck,” Harry quipped, and went a bit red when he realised what he’d said. “I mean…”
“That’s not it at all.” Harry could feel the familiar anger boiling up inside him again but it didn’t feel good at all this time.
Harry was fuming, even if he didn’t quite understand what had happened. He made his way back to the room. When Draco saw him he looked a little worried and Harry could feel him gearing up to ask a difficult question. Thankfully, he was saved by the mediwitch  returning again, this time with a clipboard and quill floating next to her.
Harry wasn’t sure why anyone would want to put him on the cover of a magazine considering he was perhaps the least photogenic person that had ever lived. Surely by now everyone in the wizarding world was aware of that fact?
The cafe wasn’t busy so Harry got his tea and toast quickly. He took up residence at a table in the back corner where he could watch the eccentrically dressed patrons come and go. It would have been a pleasant way to spend the night if he hadn’t still been thrumming with rage.
“Oh, god, don’t get her started again,” Granger laughed, pulling Harry into a hug. “Last time we got home from here she asked everybody we passed on the street that.”
Instead of answering Harry’s question, Draco pulled the blankets up over their heads, trapping out the world. He smiled quietly to himself when Harry reached out and dragged him closer, burrowing his face in Draco’s neck. Draco ran his hand down Harry’s back, across his broad shoulders and up through his hair. He smelled like sleep and the horrible 3-in-1 shampoo- conditioner-body wash he insisted on using. Draco had tried to throw it away countless times but it always managed to reappear in their bathroom. That was a relief, if he was honest: secretly he would miss the smell if he ever managed to get rid of it for good.
It was the bag from the magazine shop in Melbourne, he realised with glee. He reckoned they were a good way to waste some time so he tipped the contents onto the bed. Out fell the Cannons magazine for Ron, the Quidditch Daily with Benjy on the cover, and something else. Harry reached out for the third magazine curiously - he only remembered buying two - and was greeted by the sight of Malfoy’s mostly naked body. Harry felt like he was on fire.
Hermione reached over to rub his shoulder sympathetically. “Oh, Harry, you really are a bit oblivious sometimes.”
He felt Draco’s breathing slowing next to him, and his own eyes began to grow heavy. They’d never spent the night together and Harry wasn’t sure that he was even allowed to, but he was too tired to get up and go home.
His inbox remained empty by the time morning rolled around, and there was no reply the next day, or the day after that. On the third day, Harry tried calling him.
Harry shook his head, and then tugged on Malfoy’s arm until he sank onto the floor next to him, leaning his back against the wall. “I’m fine. I just need to rest for a moment, then we can keep talking.”
“Do you want to leave?” That made Harry look back up at him. He wanted to say yes more than he’d wanted anything in a long time. He wanted to want to leave.
Harry had to read the message twice to process what it said. Draco was coming over. Draco was coming over to Grimmauld Place. Draco was coming over to Grimmauld Place in less than four hours. He glanced around the room, taking in the piles of takeaway containers and thick cobwebs in the curtains, and then down at the chow mein stain on the hem of his t-shirt.
“Please don’t say anything to him about it though,” she rushed. “Obviously if he hasn’t officially told you, I shouldn’t have said anything. I just assumed…”
Under any other circumstances Harry would have teased him about being such a sap but when he looked back at his best friend he realised that Ron was right: he was a lucky man. He had everything he’d ever wanted and he was perfectly satisfied with it all.
In frustration Harry lurched to the side without warning, knocking Malfoy hard. He was gratified to hear him make a little huff of surprise. Seekers fighting wasn’t against the rules, so long as they didn’t use their wands, but Harry had always thought of it as dirty play. He was furious that Malfoy had pushed him to it.
He looked down at it and then out at the crowd. He couldn’t see Draco out there but Harry knew he must be watching somewhere. At that moment he knew exactly what he had to do.
“Yeah, you too. You had such a good game in Melbourne.” Harry wracked his brain for anything helpful to say, but she was beaming so it didn’t seem to matter.
Chanel gave them a spiel about Sydney and Australia that Harry barely heard. He kept shooting glances at Ginny who was leaning against the wall opposite him. She looked good, relaxed as always, and well-rested. She still wore her hair long but today it was up in a ponytail, with a few loose strands that had escaped around her ears. She noticed him looking after a second and glanced up to give him a soft smile.
Harry’s entire body blushed. That word would be so cheesy from anyone else, but it sounded both intimate and filthy in Malfoy’s - Draco’s mouth. Speaking of which - his lips looked red, wet and obscene.
“Ah, right,” he stalled. He could tell her about what had happened - there was no reason why he couldn’t. She already knew that Malfoy was gay, after all. He glanced around quickly to make sure they were still alone in the cafe. “I erm… sort of walked in on Malfoy with someone in our room.”
“Oh, no, not at all,” Harry said, trying to hide his shock as best he could. “I just didn’t realise anyone was there.”
His eyes strayed in the direction that Krum and Charlie had gone and saw them sharing a plate of hors d'oeuvres, heads bowed together, just a little too close to one another.
He hit send before he could chicken out and lay back down, trying to still his heart rate. After a few seconds, he sat up to check if there had been a reply and almost dropped the phone when it began to ring.
Considering the fact that most of Harry’s life revolved around Quidditch, it would be reasonable to assume that he would be sick of it. Yet, as he watched one of the Cannons Chasers score an uncharacteristically impressive goal, he thought there was possibly no place he’d rather be. The only thing that would improve it was a drink, he mused as he watched Ron practically chug his beer, but he wasn’t willing to risk the wrath of his captain if he was found out. Ron had actually played two seasons as a reserve keeper for the Wimbourne Wasps when they had first left school, but he’d taken a nasty tumble during a game against Tutshill and had left the team soon afterwards to work as a trainer for the English National Team for the World Cup. When the World Cup ended he was hired by Puddlemere and quickly worked his way up to where he was now. In Harry’s, completely unbiased, opinion it was only a matter of time before Ron was coaching the team. His long talks could be a pain in the arse but his vast knowledge of Quidditch made him an incredibly great trainer.
“Tsk tsk where’s the magic word Potter? Didn’t your mother teach you any manners?” At that Harry almost throttled him but managed to hold himself back because he could feel the eyes of almost everyone in the hall on his back.
“Hello, Mr Malfoy. I’m going to do some final diagnostics and then we can see about getting you home.” The quill scribbled furiously as she waved her wand over him. When she was done, she examined the clipboard for a few moments, brow furrowed.
Harry stared at the cover of Witch Weekly - which sported a half-naked Malfoy, reclining lazily on a pile of Golden Snitches - in abject horror. It was exactly the kind of photoshoot Harry had allowed himself to be talked into early in his career and he’d learned the hard way that no amount of makeup or photo editing could make him look suave while posing. The same, unfortunately, could not be said for Malfoy. He looked ridiculous in his Quidditch leathers and boots, sans jersey, but undeniably cool. The photo was a loop of him throwing one of the Snitches into the air and then catching it and looking directly into the camera with a smirk.
He blushed again, burying his face for a second in her soft shoulder. She smelt of flour and rosemary and cinnamon. When she finally pulled away she examined his face critically. Having been judged (“Thin as a hungry rake!”) he was sent back out into the sitting room with a frankly unreasonably full plate.
“You’re a git,” Malfoy replied grumpily, and Harry had to bite his cheek to stop himself from laughing. Malfoy was silent for such a long time that Harry thought perhaps he’d fallen asleep but then: “I hate hotel rooms too.” His tone was uncharacteristically vulnerable.
In an effort to overcome his newly discovered prejudice Harry decided that he was going to make a conscious effort to be nice to Malfoy. It was very much a guilt-based decision, but he hoped it counted anyway. The trouble was, Malfoy did not make it easy.
Hermione ignored him. She was looking rather pale too. “I’m so sorry, Harry, we should have called first. We just didn’t think… We just came to tell you some news, but it can wait until later. We can come back.”
He looked at her - really looked for the first time. She was very pretty: long blonde hair, big blue eyes and soft, delicate features. She’d been a few years above him at school in Hufflepuff and now played for the Wimbourne Wasps, and he’d never noticed her before more than in passing.
The man waggled his finger drunkenly at Harry and then ambled back to his table, leaving Harry feeling confused but undeniably relieved.
And then he remembered that he hadn’t even got Colin’s camera back. Swearing under his breath, he rolled over and, after about 15 minutes of tossing and turning, managed to fall into a restless sleep.
The next morning he awoke to an owl at his window carrying that morning’s Prophet with a note stuck to it in Malfoy’s slanted hand:
Harry turned and looked at her, feeling a pang in his chest. “Of course not. Maybe easier, but not better.”
“Fucking shitty Muggle technology,” Harry muttered from where Malfoy had him pinned up against the door. He fumbled in his back pocket for the key card. Malfoy didn’t respond because he was sucking on Harry’s neck in a highly distracting fashion, which wasn’t helping Harry's search.
He couldn’t even look at the rest of the team in the changing room during halftime. He just sat with his head between his knees, trying to focus on his breathing. He was so wrapped up in feeling sorry for himself that he didn’t hear Malfoy sit down next to him until he spoke.
When the of his teammates had filed into the showers Harry finally couldn’t take it anymore and got up to go for another angry fly around the pitch. He stomped out the door, and straight into Draco Malfoy. He was gratified to see that his opponent was just as sweaty and gross as him, but that was about all he could be grateful for.
Harry had to press his lips together to stop himself from laughing. “Let her speak, I want to hear all the lovely things you said about me.”
After a few minutes of thorough ravaging which left Harry’s carefully selected outfit very dishevelled, Draco pulled away and glanced around the room, seeming to realise for the first time that he was somewhere new.
Malfoy’s entire playing strategy seemed to be to get his opponent as pissed off as humanly possible. Harry was well aware of this now but it didn’t seem to make any difference - he still spent most of the game holding himself back from throwing a punch.
“Well, I was a little bit pissed off so I left and then I decided to get a new room.” He didn’t think it was strictly necessary to mention the fight.
“This is the old Black house,” he said. Harry nodded, watching him carefully. “I knew you inherited it but I forgot…”
“Oh,” Harry said, without really meaning to and then felt his neck redden when Malfoy gave him a look.
He tried pressing one of the buttons and something weird and brightly coloured happened on the screen, causing him to snap it shut quickly. Clearly the very brief instructions from Baxter had not adequately prepared him for this. He thought about going back to the shop to ask for another tutorial but that was just too humiliating. It was no good having the bloody thing if he couldn’t use it, though. He wasn’t going to call him, he’d already decided, but even if he wasn’t - which he wasn’t - he could call other people. But first he would need to learn how to use it, and unfortunately, with Hermione and Ron busy with wedding stuff, there was only one person he knew who knew how to use a mobile.
He hovered for another second before Angelina rolled her eyes and tugged him down onto the seat next to her. He spared another anxious glance towards Ginny but she seemed perfectly comfortable so he turned his focus back to the empty plate in front of him.
“He can really move, can’t he,” Angelina said from somewhere to Harry’s left. He hummed in response. “Are you alright?” She was closer, right up to Harry’s ear.
Eventually, Hermione and Ron left to tell their families about the pregnancy and Harry was left alone again. He couldn’t get Draco’s face when he was stepping into the Floo out of his head, the little edge of fear at the corner of his eyes.
Harry wanted to protest but water actually sounded excellent just then so he let her drag him over to the bar. Once he’d downed a glass of ice-cold water he told her he needed the bathroom and headed off in the direction he thought he remembered them being. Luckily for him, there wasn’t much of a line and he managed to get in and do his business quickly.
She fixed him with a sharp look before continuing. “I’m going to assume that you’ve seen the article?”
“Alright, you two, enough with the domestics. Where do you need us, Harry?” Angelina asked, rubbing her hands together.
Pansy’s words played over and over in his head. You need to ask yourself who the character you are playing is. He’d never thought about it like that before. He’d always assumed that he was just himself on and off the pitch. Except… Was that strictly true? A far more familiar voice rang in his head: Don’t tell me you think you have to be Harry Potter: Quidditch Star twenty-four hours a day? Perhaps, instead of playing a character on the pitch and being himself at home, he had been playing the character all the time.
Draco was falling and, by the looks of it, completely unconscious, his broom weaving back and forth as he hurtled towards the ground. Harry registered that Draco’s teammates were trying to get to him but they were too far away and play was continuing. He shot Cushioning Charm after Cushioning Charm at the ground where he thought Draco would land but it was no use - he was moving too much. Harry did the only thing he could: he put his head down and flew.
“Oh, um, it doesn’t matter really.” She looked a bit red. “You know, it’s been so nice playing with you the past few weeks.”
“Sure you weren’t.” She patted his hand in a manner that he assumed was meant to be reassuring but decidedly wasn’t.
The next half hour went by in a blur of back-patting and shouting. Before Harry really had time to process what was happening he was pushed onto a stage to take photos with the Cup, and then a microphone was thrust into his hand.
“Alright, enough Quidditch talk,” Hermione interrupted just as Ron was opening his mouth again. “Have you spoken to Ginny?”
He lifted his head finally, slumping back in the chair. “He was annoyed that I was moving rooms, and then he accused me of being jealous.”
He pulled his covers back up over his head miserably and groaned. Luckily Ron seemed to take his groan for nerves because he patted Harry’s foot awkwardly.
They took off almost simultaneously, leaning forward and forward on their brooms as they dove. They were so close Harry felt like they were moving in sync.
He made his way over to where she was sitting at a wooden table, and then screeched to a stop when he caught sight of who was sitting across from her.
England’s first game took place against Norway on the third day of the competition. Thankfully, Scotland and England were in different brackets so they wouldn’t be playing each other until the final - or at all, if things didn’t go their way.
“Oh my goodness, thank you so much. You’ve been playing really, really well too.” Harry started when he felt her hand on his knee.
Kreacher looked even more suspicious. “But Master has not used this room since he returned from the red-haired blood-traitor’s house.”
“I think Williams would be the one more likely to end up with a shiner,” Ron snorted, taking a long pull of his coffee. “Oh, speaking of Wood - I heard he’s been tapped to captain the Scottish team.”
He managed to get inside and to the table without further incident and settled in for what was essentially one long panic attack. Beth was lovely and pretty, but she was very, very shy and quiet. Combined with Harry’s crippling awkwardness, it turned out to be one of the most stilted and uncomfortable evenings of Harry’s life. When dinner finally ended, he made a weak excuse and escaped as quickly as possible.
“We’re not really, just roommates,” he said. His palms prickled uncomfortably and he pressed them onto his thighs.
Draco laughed at him when he expressed this. “It’s part of the whole gay thing. For the first fifteen years of my life, I thought that the reason I was obsessed with Andros the Invincible’s chocolate frog card was that I just really liked Ancient Greece.”
Harry looked at the other second-year Gryffindors and saw that they were all looking back at him expectantly,
Harry and Draco were just about to follow them to the living room when the Floo gave a final puff of green smoke and Granger and Weasley emerged, with a very excited and wiggly child in tow. She squealed with joy as Granger dusted soot out of her hair.
He clutched his beer like a lifeline while Dean and Seamus regaled them with stories of their adventures travelling around America together. It was funny to think that while he had been stewing in his own misery the rest of the world had continued without him. It made his problems seem rather insignificant if he was perfectly honest.
“Come on, I want to try mum’s pigs-in-blankets before they run out,” Charlie said, jerking his head towards the kitchen.
Malfoy interrupted her with a slight yelp. “Alright, thank you, Cami! I think he’s heard quite enough.”
If he was being honest with himself, the sponsors weren’t the only reason he was hiding. He hadn’t spotted Malfoy yet, but something about seeing him in this context was freaking Harry right out. He was wound so tight that he almost jumped out of his skin when the man himself appeared at the entryway.
Malfoy pretended to pout. “You’re no fun, Golden Boy. All work and no play makes Potter a dull boy.”
Harry was a bit taken aback. “You didn’t reply to my text. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. I wanted to talk to you.” It sounded pathetic, even to his own ears.
“Oh, cool,” Harry replied, not sure how embarrassed he should be that he didn’t have a clue what she was talking about.
The Snitch dropped too, whizzing towards the ground at speed. They needed to reach it before it got too close or changed direction but they were jostling each other. Harry’s broom was bumped by one of the Scottish Beaters but he pushed through, using his legs to maintain his speed.
They hadn’t seen each other since the final in June and it was undeniably awkward. Harry was acutely aware of how childish he had been. He’d thought about writing to Malfoy to apologise a few times, but he’d never quite been able to bring himself to send the letter. Now they were standing in front of each other looking down the barrel of a month as roommates.
Once breakfast was finished, he went to check on Draco. When he gently pushed open the door between their rooms, he found the man in question gingerly sipping on a mug of hot tea. He glanced up when he heard Harry come in.
Some strange confidence overtook Harry and he reached up and pulled Malfoy towards him. The boys wrestled on the tiles, wands abandoned in favour of fists. Malfoy got in a few good hits before Harry managed to get him in a headlock, but he made the mistake of relaxing for a second, during which Malfoy took the opportunity to slip free and scramble to his feet.
"Well…” She looked vaguely amused. “For starters, he’s currently feeling up an extremely handsome Australian man.”
“Like Puddlemere’s star player abandoning the Snitch to be his evil rival’s knight in shining armour? Yes, exactly like that.” She sighed before continuing. “The second, as his friend, is: leave him alone.”
They played a fast-paced Seekers game. Draco wasn’t up to his usual strength but he still had his tricks so it wasn’t boring in the slightest. By the time Harry caught the Snitch he was covered in a thick layer of sweat and dirt. They collapsed next to each other on the grass.
“If you say so." From the sounds of it, Malfoy was taking his pants off and Harry had to force himself to keep his eyes shut. “Merlin, you're strange.”
Scotland was up 100 to 50, but the Snitch had barely been anywhere to be seen so Harry had contributed very little to the whole thing. He was biding his time. He glanced out at the crowd and smiled when he saw a little girl clutching a “POTTER’S MY PAL” sign.
“Fucking hell, Gin, you can’t just ask me things like that!” he coughed, laughing in spite of himself.
“Good morning, Pansy. Lovely to see you as always,” Harry said brightly, before hugging Parvati tightly. Draco allowed Parvati to pull him in for a hug with only a tiny bit of resistance once Harry had let her go.
So maybe he didn’t like anyone then? But then his mind strayed back to the cubicle of the third-floor boys’ bathroom and his cheeks flushed, he had definitely liked that. He decided that he wasn’t going to be able to make any decisions about anything tonight, it would all depend upon how he felt when he saw Malfoy again.
“You need to have a laugh,” she used to snap in frustration when his moping got too much for her. “You’re wallowing and it’s unhealthy. I didn’t even make the World Cup Squad but you don’t see me complaining about it.”
“Just…” Harry paused and reminded himself once again that he was supposed to be trying to be friendly. “It looks nice and er… expensive, but you don’t really need it. You look fine as you are.”
“No. Putting his career aside, leave him alone.” She watched him carefully. “He is not as tough as you think.”
“I don’t know for sure, but I know Krum’s dating someone and I can’t think of why else he’d be invited.” Harry shrugged, suddenly a bit unsure.
He rolled over and pulled the blanket up over his head too, which did nothing to drown out the sound of Malfoy laughing at him.
Malfoy looked good, too, controlling his broom effortlessly as he flew, eyes bright and mischievous. Harry loved to just watch as he swooped and looped, entertaining the crowd, winding them up. He was beautiful like this, basking in the attention. Even the boos - of which there were quite a few - seemed to energise him. Harry felt breathless and it took all of his energy not to laugh with him, to maintain the stern, disapproving character he knew he was playing.
“Yeah..erm definitely,” Harry cleared his throat, suddenly and violently wishing he could go back to Grimmauld Place and his own bed. “Sorry, Angelina, but I think I’m going to head back to the hotel. I have a bit of a headache.”
“Merlin, Potter, you scared the life out of me. I thought you’d gone back with Johnson.” He grabbed his wand and lit up the room with a quick Lumos .
Malfoy narrowed his eyes slightly and seemed to pull himself up to his full height. “I came to see you.”
“That’s true, but they were the only team who would have made me eligible to play in the World Cup.” Harry’s silence must have been loud because Malfoy sighed and continued, “No English team would have me. Besides, do you really think that they would choose me over the golden boy for the national team?”
He got his next opportunity at lunch. As usual, Ginny, Angelina and Oliver were sitting together with a few of the English players while Malfoy sat alone and slightly apart.
Once he’d finished his coffee, he decided he’d pop over to visit Hermione and Ron. While he got to see Ron almost every day at training, Hermione was now working in the Minister's office so he hardly got to see her at all unless he went to their house. It was a bit of a risk at the moment as they were in the middle of planning their wedding and tensions were high, so when he stuck his head through the Floo, he was relieved to see them both sitting on the sofa reading the paper, not a seating plan in sight.
After that, things went surprisingly smoothly and it wasn’t long before Harry was standing next to Ron at the altar. It wasn’t a small ceremony - Ron’s family alone was enough to ensure that - but it still felt intimate with the trees cradling the scene from above, and the noise of merry voices and soft music.
Harry swallowed and tried not to look too amused by Malfoy’s reaction, not wanting to escalate the situation any further.
The irony of that last one made him snort with laughter. The actual (former) Death Eater in the room turned to look at him.
Hours later, they lay side by side on their backs on a large rock, catching their breaths. The stone was still warm from baking in the hot Australian sun all day and that warmth seeped through Harry’s shirt. They weren’t touching but their shoulders were so close that if they both inhaled at the same time they would brush together. Harry tried to focus on the wide expanse of sky above their heads. It seemed bigger here somehow, and closer. In London, you couldn’t even see the stars, and at Hogwarts they always seemed miles and miles away but here it almost felt like if he reached his arm out he could pluck one directly from the sky.
“I’m here to talk about Quidditch. Do you have any questions about that?” He leant forward to try to see her notebook but she snatched it away.
He could feel Draco’s dick trapped between their bodies, sliding on the lube and precome on their stomachs. It couldn’t be satisfying, though Draco didn’t seem to be complaining, holding Harry to him with his arms and legs.
“It’s not out of the blue, though,” Harry said, getting a little annoyed. “If you’d been paying attention you’d know that things have been bad for a while, from long before the World Cup.”
Draco was somewhere to his left. They’d been flying around each other all game, but now in hour three they were both resting and watching. They hadn’t even spoken to each other yet.
The bar was a somewhat seedy establishment, with dirty looking pool tables and a large dance floor that was almost filled to bursting.
They finished their drinks in silence until Krum stood up and shook Harry’s hand. “Have to go speak to my vŭzlyuben, but good luck in Scotland.”
“That’s it, isn’t it?” Malfoy looked furious and thrilled and it was a terrifying combination. “I’m sure you wouldn’t be moving out if I had been having my cock sucked by some pretty redhead. It can’t possibly be the first time you’ve ever walked in on a roommate
Something about seeing his life all planned out like that, certain and solid, should have made him nervous. Instead, he found it to be a comfort. It mapped out the next two years of his life in a series of colour-coded bubbles: the rest of the regular season through Christmas and into the new year, then, if all went to plan, the Cup final in July. A pink bubble showed the month long tour of Australia and New Zealand with the British and Irish Thestrals that he’d be invited to participate in during September and October 2005. That would be interesting, but as soon as he returned it would be straight into qualifying games for the World Cup with the English team and, hopefully, the European Cup in early 2006. That would keep him busy until the 2006 League Cup, and then it would be off to Scotland for the World Cup.
He was restless nonetheless, dying to go and find him, but he knew that he had to let Draco come to him this time. He was so distracted that he didn’t notice Ron standing directly in front of him until he cleared his throat.
“Actually,” Ron fussed with his tie. “If you could go and check on Hermione that would be great. I’ve been banished.”
Hesitantly, he moved his other hand to Malfoy’s jaw, and then to his cheek, brushing his thumb over the smooth skin of his ridiculous cheekbones, which he could feel hollowing and filling.
“This.” Draco gestured between them. “If we’re not going to talk throughout the World Cup we might as well just end it now. Seems simpler.”
“Do you think Malfoy would mind if I asked her for a boogie?” Cormac was asking, but Harry wasn’t listening.
“Better,” he replied. He didn’t look much better - his face was still thin and his skin a bit too pale, but his voice sounded stronger than it had the day before. “I want to show you some of the other parts of the castle today.”
“It’ll be bracing,” Draco replied, getting to his feet and picking up their brooms to stow them back in the shed.
“Yeah, of course, but hold on—” Ron began to say something but Harry didn't wait around to hear what it was, just turned and headed out the door.
When he finally got out of the shower he dried himself and fell immediately into bed, pressing his still very present erection into the mattress. His brain felt like it was overheating with the sheer volume of thoughts racing through it.
Maybe he just hadn’t noticed his latent homophobia because he’d never actually been around gay men who touched each other? There was a horrible thought. Harry immediately felt sick with guilt.  He thought briefly about floo-calling Charlie and asking him if he’d ever accidentally offended him, but when he glanced at the time he realised that he’d probably be asleep and waking him up to ask if he had ever offended him felt like a lateral move. He wished that Hermione was there to talk him down.
“Mr Potter, this is an automated Floo message to remind you that you are expected for an appointment with Ms Pavarti Patil of Patil Sports Management in five minutes. If you are unable to make this appointment please contact Ms Patil’s assistant via Floo or owl at your earliest convenience. Thank you.’
It had all been going well for the first two periods. He and Malfoy had maintained a polite distance, hovering above the action. Puddlemere had been looking strong and they were up 40-10. Then he spotted it.
“You alright?” came the mumble from his left. Draco turned to see, as he did every morning, Harry Potter’s sleep-soft face blinking at him, the imprint of the pillow creased on his brown cheek. Without his glasses, his eyes looked even bigger than usual. Draco’s heart swelled with a frankly embarrassing amount of fondness knowing at that moment he was the only thing in the world Harry could see.
and glanced at Harry. “Is it true?” He leaned against the counter of Grimmauld Place's kitchen holding a mug of coffee, Puddlemere trainer robes pushed up to his elbows.
For his own part, Harry realised that he was still gripping Malfoy’s dick like a moron and decided he’d better reciprocate. He moved his hand tentatively and was rewarded with a moan against his lips. It gave him the confidence to keep going, gripping Malfoy tightly the way he liked it, using Malfoy’s spit like lube.
“Thank you,” she said a little tearfully. “It’s lovely that everyone wants to be involved but it is rather overwhelming.”
Pansy narrowed her eyes, examining his face as if looking for some trace of deception, finally she closed them for a long moment, looking pained. “I can’t believe I’m going to tell you this. He would murder me if he knew.” She opened her eyes again and glared at him. “I’m choosing to trust in your Gryffindor honour or whatever because this seems like the only way to get you to leave him alone.”
His melancholic musings were interrupted by a sharp tug on his jacket hem. He glanced down to find an extremely ginger child with enormous blue eyes staring up at him.
There was no time to think about that because Wood and Davies were approaching each other to shake hands.
Harry felt his face getting unbearably hot - he was absolutely not going to think about the possibilities of that. “I don’t think so?”
The team took up residence at a table near the back and the Muggleborns gave the Purebloods a quick lesson on ordering drinks at a Muggle bar.
“Alright,” she said slowly. “Would you consider coming to the pub with us all on Thursday then? Ginny won’t be there.”
“There are some things more important. Is hard to see now because you want to win, but win does not fix everything.” Harry looked at him skeptically. “There is always Quidditch - every year European Cup, every four years World Cup. But love only come around once, maybe twice in a lifetime. Not good odds.”
They worked on hand placement for at least five minutes before Malfoy allowed him to take off. He followed him up into the air, about five meters above the pitch.
Harry laughed. “I don’t know how Ginny would feel about being referred to as a bird.” He shook his head. “To answer your question, though: it’s different but it’s not that different. I think it depends on the person. The difference between being with Ginny and going on the dates you lot picked for me was far bigger.”
“Right,” Harry replied faintly. He and Ron had never been very good at talking about sex. It had been fine when they were young but then Harry had started dating Ron’s sister and Ron had started dating Hermione and it had just felt a bit sleazy to talk about in any great detail. “What do you want to know?”
“It’s a historical artifact,” Draco insisted, reaching for another volume but Harry caught his wrist before he could pull it out.
Harry loved Puddlemere’s home ground. The stadium, training grounds and meeting rooms were the only place outside of his house and Hermione’s and Ron’s place that he felt truly safe and comfortable. He spent so much of his time there it sometimes felt like a second home. He’d even slept a few nights on the sofa in the captain's office after things had ended with Ginny. He always experienced a sense of absolute peace wash over him when he stepped through the gates. It was quaint and homely in a way that other clubs weren't, and he’d known the first time he’d set foot in there that it was the right place for him.
“The only reason for a wizard to buy a mobile is to have the kind of conversations that aren’t Floo appropriate,” she cackled.
They sniped at each other a few more times, and it seemed to rile the crowd up even more until they were a loud, boisterous mass. It was thrilling.
The mediwitch  left, and Harry did as he was told, perching back on his seat as Draco downed the potion.
When they landed Harry was determined to shake Malfoy’s hand regardless of how he felt about the loss. As he approached, Malfoy looked up. His hair was dark with sweat and he was smirking, mouthguard hanging from the corner of his mouth.
Harry awoke from a dream about soft blond hair and cold hands with a start, to Ron’s freckled face staring down at his.
Draco looked like he might cry again, which was a horrific enough thought that Harry jumped in. “Is there anything that he can do to speed up the recovery?”
“Potter.” The gentleness in Malfoy’s voice stopped him. “Of course they do something. Do you think I just put them on for fun?”
His first attempt was the morning after his crisis of conscience. Usually, he would have complained loudly when Malfoy’s alarm went off at six am, three hours before they needed to wake up on a non-game day, but this time he kept his mouth shut.
“Seriously.” Harry tugged the blanket up to cover his bare chest a bit more. “Why would you think that me and Angelina… that we’re…” He made an aborted motion with his hands.
Harry couldn’t help but feel a little hard done by. For the first few years of his career he’d had lots of young fans, but these days his fanbase seemed to be leaning further and further towards the over sixty-five crowd. In fact, in the first few years after the war, the attention had been almost unbearably positive. He had some painful memories of the simpering profiles the
He remembered that conversation like it was yesterday. It had been a few months after the end of the war. They’d been out here on the roof but it had been late afternoon in summer and they’d been drinking tea instead of whisky.
“Tsk tsk, Mr Potter! We were just getting there.” She flicked her hand at the Quick-Quotes Quill again and it seemed to speed up. “Draco Malfoy - you two are currently engaged in a very public feud, correct?”
His team landed and surrounded him in celebration but Harry could feel Davies’ anger following him and so made his escape as quickly as possible, skipping all the post-match celebrations entirely.
How dare Malfoy bring some random man back to their room? Harry couldn’t believe the cheek of it. Where was he supposed to sleep now? He certainly couldn’t go back to Ginny’s room. It was such a selfish, shortsighted, typically Malfoy thing to do that he hated himself for being surprised. He slapped his hand against the wall of the lift in frustration.
Harry groaned again, “No! Of course not.” He met her eye and immediately regretted it when he saw the raised eyebrows. “Well, maybe my feelings about it are slightly more complicated than that but I wasn’t jealous.”
“By the way,” he spoke suddenly, breaking Harry’s reverie. “If I oversleep tomorrow, I will blame you entirely.” He sighed and bumped their shoulders together.
“That sounds about right,” Draco said and then let out a funny little giggle that sounded so out of character that Harry thought for a moment that he’d imagined it. “Were you worried about me, Potter?” he asked, giggling again.
Surely other men’s didn’t look like that - Harry was pretty sure he would have noticed. It was toned and full and perfect, and it was attached to his perfect legs and his perfect back, and Harry genuinely hated him a little bit. Feeling self-conscious, he reached up and pulled a blanket off the bed and threw it over his legs.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “For starters, this one.” He picked up a green little bottle. “This stops my hair from getting greasy during practice, and this one” - he held up another bottle, blue this time - “protects it from the wind.”
Harry could hear the commentators and was vaguely aware that everyone was watching, so he tried to swallow down his anger.
“Could you be a little bit louder please?” he mumbled spitefully and was gratified to hear Malfoy jump so hard he dropped his wand with a clatter.
“I don’t recall you mentioning that during the race. How convenient that it’s just come back to you now.” Malfoy had his arms crossed and a look of smug insolence on his face.
Draco and Ron maintained a carefully cultivated peace, polite but not yet fully natural. They had almost come to blows once, after a Cannons game a few years back, but oddly it seemed to have cleared most of the underlying tension. Draco wasn’t under any illusions that he was going to become best friends with the man, but it had certainly helped that Weasley’s daughter Rose had taken somewhat of a shine to Draco.
“No one has ever… How did you…” For the first time in perhaps his entire life, Draco looked completely speechless.
He found that there was another set of rooms on their floor that were set up as a small library and office. The rest of the bedrooms were at the other end of the building. Harry realised with some delay that he and Draco were in the master and mistress suites; he wasn’t quite sure how to feel about the fact that he had been placed in the latter. When they had first arrived, Harry had wondered if he would be sharing with Draco, but Una had put them in separate rooms and he hadn’t wanted to create problems by asking.
On the floor below their rooms was the main library, which Harry stumbled upon by accident when he was looking for a downstairs bathroom. It was round and enormous with bookshelves that reached up three stories, lush red carpets and huge leather armchairs. Harry wasn’t a library aficionado like Hermione or Draco but even he could appreciate the beauty of the place, especially when he realised that one whole bookshelf was dedicated solely to Quidditch.
The first week back had been hard. He’d barely slept at all. His bed at Grimmauld Place had felt hot and uncomfortable, so he’d gone over to Hermione and Ron’s. They’d let him sleep in their spare room for four days before they asked him what was wrong.
“I think I need to sit down,” he mumbled and all but collapsed onto the sofa. Harry escaped to the kitchen and when he returned with a glass of water, Ron was looking a little bit better, and he accepted the water gratefully.
They sat in silence for a few more moments before Ginny spoke again and her voice sounded a bit nervous. “Harry…”
This was such a bad idea. Harry’s shoulders were tense under the invisibility cloak as he made his way as silently as possible towards the third-floor boys' bathroom. It had only been a few days since the Mrs. Norris incident and so he felt justified in being a little bit anxious. He knew if Hermione knew what he was doing she would probably have an aneurysm, especially as she had absolutely forbidden him from going, but it was too good of an opportunity to pass up. He did feel a little guilty about not waking Ron up, but he wasn’t keen on dragging him into what was objectively a terrible idea. Besides, he’d told Malfoy to come alone so it was only fair of him to honour that too, and if Malfoy had brought any friends Harry could always just slip away in the cloak before he saw them.
He spent so long in the gallery that by the time he had returned to his rooms the sun had set and the lamps in his room had been lit. He found a tray with some hearty stew and thick cut bread slathered in butter on the table in the corner of the room and wolfed it down gratefully before collapsing into bed. His last thought was how much he preferred the sound of the wind howling around the castle to the sound of London traffic.
. The map instructed him to hop on one of the free trams for two stops and then “ask nicely” - whatever that meant. When he hopped off at the designated stop, he made his way down a small laneway and found himself face to face with an enormous wall of graffiti. The main piece seemed to be a seven-foot-tall picture of a woman with long dark hair and some kind of musical instrument. As Harry stepped closer, her eyes flicked down to him and her fingers danced over the strings of the instrument.
Ginny laughed. “Don’t be an idiot. I might not be your fiance anymore but I never stopped being your friend.”
His shirt ended up on top of a lamp in the corner and he was just starting to pull at Draco’s Quidditch robes when there was a noise from the Floo.
“I...you can’t just leave!” Again Malfoy didn’t look very convinced at his own words, and Harry raised an eyebrow at him.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows. “Potter.” The corner of Malfoy’s mouth quirked and it made Harry want to break something. “If I’m not very much mistaken, you are the one who is currently accosting me in my hotel room.” He glanced at the clock on the wall. “At two in the morning. I think if either of us is out of line, it’s not me.”
Harry started to run towards the living room and had to force himself to walk at a reasonable pace. Before stepping into the Floo, he glanced in the mirror and grimaced. He was still wearing his shirt and suit trousers, but his bow tie had come undone and was hanging loose around his neck, and there was no knowing where his robes had gone. He thought about getting changed, but for some reason he was in a rush to get to Draco’s. He didn’t want to waste any time.
“I think your pain potion is kicking in,” Harry replied, with some relief. “I should leave you to rest.”
Just as he was beginning to get frustrated, he was struck with sudden inspiration. He began to fly towards where the other Seeker was, not aiming at the Snitch but keeping it in the corner of his eye nonetheless. She tracked him carefully and then took off towards him. He waited until she was close enough behind him before turning around and coming to a stop so that they were facing one another. She obviously hadn’t expected this and the concentration on her face lit a light of satisfaction in him. It wasn’t his usual playing style but he could do it.
“Why do you always answer my questions with another question?” Harry demanded, closing his trunk with a slam. “Maybe the reason I don’t know is because we’ve never talked about it or told anyone.”
“Ugh, that’s foul.” He made a face, and Harry quickly passed him the glass of water from the bedside table. Draco gave him a grateful smile. “Wait a moment - were you saying something about Pansy before I came around or did I dream that?”
Draco leaned forward, gaze intense. “Consider carefully what you are asking for here. We’re competitors, we always will be. Can you handle that? I will beat you and you will beat me. I can cope with it. Can you?.” He sat back in his seat, looking slightly drained.
It was true. When Davies had taken over as captain at the beginning of 2004, it had been during a period of a mass exodus of some of the most experienced and accomplished players in the team, a few of whom Harry had played with in the 2002 World Cup. They had been forced to get creative with their recruitment, which resulted in one of the youngest teams in the league’s history. Cootes had barely finished his OWLs when he’d played his first game. This had made them the subject of ridicule and mockery in the
“How…” Harry started, but Malfoy didn’t answer. Instead, he just smirked and lifted his hand, opening his palm to reveal the Snitch fluttering inside.
He dropped his suitcases in the hallway, calling out a greeting to Kreacher, and, on a whim, walked over to the door to the front room, throwing it open. It was a bleak sight. The air smelled musty and dank and the curtains were closed, giving the impression of a dark cave.
It didn’t improve much once he’d opened the curtains. The air was thick with dust and the sheets on the sofa and chairs were yellowish and unappealing.
Harry let that sit for a moment, processing it. “I didn’t think about it like that,” he admitted. “I suppose you must have thick skin by now.”
There was nothing for it but to get up and put his glasses on, even though it was his day off and he had purposely given himself nothing to do until the afternoon when he and Ron had planned to attend a Cannons game. With a grumble, he dragged himself out of bed and down the stairs to the kitchen, the promise of coffee the only thing keeping him from kicking a hole in the wall.
As the car thundered down the path Harry made the foolish choice to roll down the window and stick his head out. On the left side, the path dropped off and ended a fair way down in some spectacularly sharp-looking rocks. Harry pulled his head back in rather sharply.
He looked ridiculously good, and Harry resented him deeply for it. His dress robes were perfectly pressed, and his hair didn’t have a strand out of place. Harry felt an irrational urge to mess him up.
“When I was a child. I hardly remember it though.” There was something like wonder in his voice and much to Harry’s irritation he stepped away and surveyed the kitchen. “You don’t keep it in very good condition, do you?”
The truth was, Harry didn’t really know. In the bar, with the help of beer, his logic for coming up and confronting Malfoy had felt foolproof. Now everything felt dreamlike and uncertain.
“For fuck sake, Potter. You walked in on me getting a blowjob, not strangling a kneazle. I can’t believe you’re going to move out because of that.” Malfoy was fully standing up now. “I knew you were frigid but I didn’t realise that it was because you’re offended by the entire concept.”
“Yeah, I’m fine.” He took a swig of beer. “It’s just… have you noticed that Malfoy always pulls but he’s never talking to any women when we go out?”
Harry was sitting at the bar in the hotel drowning his sorrows but he didn’t need to turn around to know who that accented voice belonged to.
Somehow they managed to keep their hands off each other in the lobby and the elevator, but once they reached Harry’s floor all bets were off.
When Draco came in about ten minutes later, hair damp from the bath, he found Harry fully dressed, stuffing his clothes into his trunk.
Harry was actually feeling rather charitable. He decided that he would go up to Malfoy first and shake his hand at the start of the match. He would no doubt have some pre-match nerves, coming back to Britain after so many years, and it would be good of Harry to welcome him to the league. Yes, Harry thought with some satisfaction, that would be the mature thing to do.
She gave him a knowing smile. “I’d like to recommend at least two weeks of rest.” She held up a hand at Draco’s protests. “That's the absolute minimum. I would prefer to make it six weeks but I realise that that may not be realistic.”
Number twelve Grimmauld Place hadn’t changed a lot in the years since the war. When he and Ginny got engaged, they had moved into a modern apartment together as Ginny thought Grimmauld Place was too big and dark for just the two of them. Neither of them was really the decorating type, so the new apartment had remained looking like a showhome for years, and they’d felt no sentimentality about selling it when they broke up about a year ago. Ginny had moved into a flat with Luna, Pavarti and one of the girls from the Harpies, and Harry had moved back into Grimmauld Place. He had been unwilling to sell because it felt like giving up his last tangible connection to Sirius, but he was useless at taking care of it and so most of the furniture remained under sheets with just a few rooms open.
“I see.” Draco considered his words carefully. “You know, I didn’t know how to fly when I was six either.”
“Alright, you two! Pull yourselves together, I have wisdom to impart,” Davies announced in his most authoritative tone. He stood at his full height, hands clasped behind his back, and Harry had to admit he looked like a captain.
There was a prolonged pause. “Well, you certainly know how to kill the mood, don’t you?” Malfoy said dryly.
It felt a little like when he first got glasses; it had taken the Dursleys years to respond to the letters from Harry’s school asking to get his eyes tested. In fact, it was only after he’d dropped Aunt Petunia’s favourite trifle bowl that they’d finally agreed to drag him to the optometrists. As they were driving home after collecting his first pair, he looked out the window and realised for the first time in his life that what he had always thought were green and brown blobs whizzing past weren’t blobs at all - they were trees. Yet his first feeling in that moment hadn’t been joy, but embarrassment. He knew what a tree was, he’d touched and climbed plenty of them, but for some reason he’d never put two and two together and now that he could see them he felt stupid.
Harry wasn’t sure what he expected to see in Draco’s face - anger or sadness or shame. What he didn’t expect was joy. Draco looked at him (with the widest smile Harry had ever seen) for less than half a second as if to say: “You did it!”
Harry liked being a hawk. He thought there was a certain honour in staying out of the fray. He didn’t participate much in the tradition of verbal sparring with the opposing Seeker or try to get too underhanded with his tactics. He preferred to let his play speak for itself. Since the 2002 World Cup, he’d worked a lot on his strength and he wasn’t afraid to take a hit or two, but he tried to play a clean game. That was something Benjy had taught him too.
He waited for her to react but she just sat there as if waiting for him to continue. When he didn't, her brow furrowed. “And?” she asked, looking expectant.
Harry, feeling slightly creepy, shut the door again and turned to resume his exploration of the rest of the castle.
He was gratified to see Malfoy’s face go a little paler at that, but the other boy didn’t respond, he just tucked the note into his pocket and gave Harry a curt nod.
He was completely alone when Harry walked in, and fast asleep, or perhaps still unconscious. Harry sat down in the armchair on his right.
She gave him a withering look. “Don’t pander, Harry. It's unbecoming.” His smile wavered only slightly. “I just came over to tell you that I could see your disturbing lack of cufflinks from across the room. Go and put them on this instant.”
It wasn’t that he was a sore loser. He didn’t enjoy it, obviously, but what he really hated was losing to someone who didn’t deserve it. Malfoy was a dirty player and a show-off, who didn’t deserve to play in the league, let alone beat Harry’s team. Furthermore, he was a pompous arse.
The fact that Malfoy was also going to be playing had absolutely nothing to do with it, thank you very much.
Malfoy took a deep breath, and then that voice was back. “Since you asked so nicely.” He cleared his throat. “I’m wearing a pair of black boxer briefs.”
“Not so brave without your friends to back you up are you?” Malfoy laughed standing over him with his wand a few inches from Harry’s nose.
Without waiting for his response she swept from the room, leaving him alone with his thoughts. He knew she was right about Draco. He cared about what people thought a lot more than he let on, which Harry had always known, but perhaps had never properly considered. He thought about their feud. Had Draco really started it? It felt like so long ago that Harry couldn’t really remember. It was certainly true that neither of them had done anything to try to end it, and Harry supposed he had to take some responsibility for that.
He didn’t move, just kept his hand there, gripping Harry and kissing him deeply. Harry felt undone. Desperate for some semblance of control, he scrambled at the front of Malfoy’s pyjama pants. With his free hand, Malfoy grabbed Harry’s and brought it up to his mouth, sucking Harry’s index and middle fingers into his mouth. Harry wondered vaguely if it would be possible to die from pure lust.
Finally, when their lips began to turn blue, they dragged themselves out of the water and scampered back up the hill, chasing one another all the way back to the keep.
As Ron went to brush his teeth, Harry lay in bed and stared out the window. It felt as though the weight of everything was pushing him into his mattress, and the memories from the night before were flowing back slowly, filling him with an ever-increasing sense of dread. Malfoy and the Quidditch game were stressful enough but Harry couldn’t help but think that the whole heir of Slytherin business was bound to get more complicated. This year was turning out to be almost as bad as last.
He thought about when he told Draco he was less of a twat off the pitch, all that time ago. It had just been an offhand comment, but it was true: on the pitch Draco was ruthless, but he drew a clear line between that person and the thoughtful, funny person he was the rest of the time. There were crossovers, sure, but ever since they’d come back from Australia he’d made sure that Harry knew that the things that were said on the pitch or in the press were the character, not him. For the first time, Harry wondered if he'd ever reciprocated that.
“Well,” Hermione started. They all turned to look at her. “You could speak to Pansy. I know it’s not ideal but she did speak to you about him once. She might be able to give you some insight into what he’s going through.”
Sitting on the bed was Malfoy, very much not asleep, and very much not alone. A man was kneeling on the floor between his legs. Harry didn’t recognise the back of his head, but it didn’t matter because he was all too aware of what he was doing. Malfoy hadn’t seen the door open - his head was thrown back, eyes closed, one hand propping himself up and the other buried in the man’s hair.
Thankfully, Harry heard himself being called back to the lineup and so he turned and joined his team without embarrassing himself any further.
For most of the competition, they hardly had time to do more than make eye contact across a pitch or when passing in a corridor, but during the third week both teams somehow ended up with the entire weekend free. The British and Irish players were itching for a night out and Malfoy was recruited to organise one for them, a role he seemed to take great pleasure in.
For a moment he saw something odd and surprised flicker across Malfoy’s face before he turned on his heel and stalked off towards the changing rooms. Harry suddenly became very aware that everyone was watching. He threw his hands up in frustration.
It was three weeks before he had a day off and he expected to spend it on the sofa, but when he woke up he found himself filled with the inexplicable urge to go for a walk. Perhaps it was a hangover from spending the past few weeks constantly surrounded by people, but Grimmauld Place felt vast and empty for the first time in years. It felt almost lonely, Harry realised. Shaking off that train of thought, he put some shoes on and headed out into the winter morning.
“Don’t apologise,” Draco said shakily. His eyes were very wide as he looked at Harry with sympathy that he couldn’t bear, and he let go of Harry’s arm to grab his hand.
In the afternoon conditioning class, Harry made sure they were paired up. They were doing sprints, competing against each other, and Harry didn’t even complain (much) when Malfoy tripped him a little in order to win. Very mature, if he did say so himself.
The table was high enough that Harry could see them dancing. In fact, he couldn’t tear his eyes away. Draco moved with the same grace he did on the pitch, except that he was pressed up against Camille, who seemed to be just as graceful. They moved together, her face against his neck, his arm around her waist. It felt voyeuristic to watch but Harry couldn’t help it.
“I…” Harry was briefly speechless. He looked down at his plate - it was less formidable than Malfoy's glare. “I’m not trying to soothe anything. We’re roommates and teammates, for the next few weeks anyway, we might as well try to get on.”
He gave Colin what he hoped was a comforting pat on the shoulder, got up, and began walking towards the Slytherin table, feeling quite tempted to make a run for the door instead.
“That is not the point Ron and you know it, Malfoy might be the heir of Slytherin and Harry could be walking straight into a trap,” She lowered her voice, trying not to let any of the other Gryffindors overhear. Annoyingly she was right, it was almost definitely a trap, and if Malfoy was the heir of Slytherin, Harry might very well end up looking like Mrs. Norris by the end of the night. But he was still very tempted.
There were whoops and jeers from the Magpies crowd, which Harry ignored. He just dropped and then swooped up, catching Malfoy with the end of his broom and forcing him to flip to prevent himself from falling.
When his stomach was finally empty, he quickly banished the vomit with a flick of his wand and turned to face her, trying his best not to look like he was about to pass out.
Harry watched as he climbed to his feet, kicked his pyjama bottoms off his ankles and sauntered over to the fridge completely naked. Harry had never consciously checked out a bloke’s arse before, but now he watched Malfoy's as he bent to examine the drink options.
“Well, I’m actually on top of my bed. In my hotel. In Prague.” He wanted to punch himself. Repeatedly.
“This should help with the headache, Mr Malfoy. You have some damage to your skull and a pretty hefty concussion from the Bludger. We’ll monitor you tonight and check back in tomorrow morning. Hopefully we’ll have you back home in no time.” She gave Draco a kind smile and began to head towards the door.
“It’s more than that, though.” He rubbed a hand over his jaw, trying to take in Krum’s words. “We’re just too different.”
They’d rented out a private room at a wizarding restaurant on the Viaduct Harbour, a long stretch of waterfront restaurants and bars bordering a marina full of the biggest, flashiest yachts Harry had ever seen.
Harry had retreated to the deck almost immediately, clutching a drink. It wasn’t that he was scared of seeing Malfoy, exactly. He just felt weird and jumpy.
next to the till, featuring cover star Draco Malfoy. At first glance, Harry thought that Malfoy was naked, and he did a double-take. Upon closer inspection, Harry saw it wasn’t completely full frontal but it might as well have been. The only thing protecting his modesty was the silver British and Irish League Cup he held in front of his crotch. As Harry watched, Malfoy pretended to drop the cup but caught it just in time and then winked into the camera.
“After Hogwarts. We already live together in the dorm. I can’t stand the thought of not being with you every day after we graduate. Move in with me.”
“Thank you for sharing, Neville,” Artemis said softly. There was a long pause, and Artemis looked around the room expectantly. No one spoke.
“Fuck no, Draco. I don’t pity you, just like you don’t pity me. This is me saying I love you, and I want to be with you every single day.”
Remus and Narcissa have a *past* and you can read about their night together in the previous work in this series, "One Night Undone." I have plans for them!
Slowly at first, Harry swirled his tongue around the puckered flesh. “Fuuuuuccckk,” Draco breathed. Smiling at Draco’s pleasure, Harry sped up his efforts, licking, sucking, kissing, and darting his tongue inside of Draco.
Draco smiled and stood up from the couch. “Come on. I’m exhausted.” He walked down the hallway toward his bedroom, and Harry followed, limping a bit. His arse was sore, but he didn’t regret it for a bit. Totally worth it.
The boys headed down their hallway. Dean and Seamus asked Neville to room with them, and he agreed once he lectured them on using silencing charms. Harry chuckled, glad he wouldn’t have to listen to the two lovers anymore.
“Remus, Draco just vomited. I heard him myself. He’s worried about missing class, because, well, you know. So can I take him to the Hospital Wing?”
Harry stifled a snort. This was going to be a long evening if he did not do something. Hermione led them to the living room, where Ron was sitting by the fire. He stood when Harry and Draco entered the room.
“Good. Well, you should invite him over Saturday night. It’s about time we get to know him. You know, as more than the Slytherin bully.”
“Ron!” Hermione chastised her husband. “We talked about this. We’re all adults now, and Draco is dating Harry. We are going to use first. Names.” Her lips thinned as she reiterated this point to Ron.
Harry popped up and scooted off of Draco. Draco unbuttoned his shirt and pulled it off his shoulders. Harry licked his lips as he took in Draco then froze. His eyes widened in panic. “I forgot. For just a moment. I’m—”
Their days were filled with establishing the charity, printing out posters and pamphlets about the signs of child abuse, and conducting interviews with witches and wizards who wanted to be social workers. The evenings that did not have family obligations were filled with fundraising. And every night, Harry and Draco went to bed, exhausted and fulfilled, and usually quite satisfied with each other’s bodies. Sometimes they stayed at Grimmauld Place; other times they stayed at Draco’s flat.
“First of all, that’s incredibly sexist.” Hermione jabbed her fork in Harry’s direction. “And second, you’re not fine. You have all the clinical symptoms of depression.”
“Just fine.” Harry paused, thinking of his nightmares, his social anxiety, of the way he felt peace after writing and crying last night. “Well, maybe it’s not the healthiest coping mechanism. But I get by.”
Their food came out just then, and the cousins sat in silence, eating and listening to Daisy talk about anything and everything. Harry tried to stay in the moment, but his mind kept slipping back to his childhood with the Dursleys. He hardly recognized the man in front of him. He wondered if Dudley was thinking of their history, too.
Inside the restaurant, Daisy took to coloring her children’s menu. Dudley did most of the talking, thankfully. It turned out that Dudley had gotten married eight years before to a girl he met at work. They had a seven-year-old son named Brian, and Daisy, who was five. Daisy had first started showing signs of magic at age two, when she could change the telly channel by crying. But today was the first time her magic had manifested outside of home.
They slipped out of the crowd and made their way to the Ministry exit. Harry had become quite skilled at escaping reporters. He was sure they would pin them down at the pub later for a statement. But for now, he just wanted to be alone with Draco.
“Will you come back tonight?” The words ran together, and Harry hadn’t expected Draco to be nervous. Harry pulled him close and kissed him.
“Look, um. It’s just not a big deal in our world, Harry. No one would so much as bat an eye. All that would happen is that the tabloids would try to say you’re dating twice as many people now.”
Just when he thought he was out of tears, more came. But these were different tears. Draco pushed Harry down on the couch and snogged him senseless.
He snapped his hips, and Draco lost himself to the panting and grunting and the sound of Harry’s balls slapping against him. Harry took one of Draco’s nipples in his mouth and flicked it with his tongue. Draco responded by raising his hips, inviting Harry deeper.
It could have been anyone’s voice. Maybe it was his own. Maybe it was Dumbledore’s, and he was back at the sterile King’s Cross. Maybe it was his mom’s voice.
Draco began to giggle. Then the giggles turned into deep, belly-aching laughs. “He’s dead then? The bastard is dead?” he managed to gasp out between chortles.
“Harry?!” The Muggle man turned and looked at Harry in surprise. As recognition dawned on Harry, his jaw dropped. “Oh, thank God!”
She introduced the new staff members and heads of houses. There was a new Transfiguration professor since McGonagall had become headmistress. Slughorn was now the head of Slytherin house. Professor Sinistra had taken over as head of Gryffindor. Remus was announced as the head of eighth years and Defense. And there was a new Muggle Studies professor. McGonagall held a minute of silence for Professor Burbage. Harry noticed that Draco turned slightly green.
The meeting room was little more than a broom closet with two chairs and a door on each end. There was one orb of light floating around the ceiling, illuminating the dirty corners of the stone room. Draco sat in the metal chair, breathing in the 4-7-8 pattern Artemis had taught them.
Harry’s career meeting was the following Monday. He had no idea what he wanted to do with his life. The thought of fighting dark wizards ever again seemed terrible. Ron had suggested that he try out for a Quidditch team. But he didn’t think his heart was in it like it used to be. Hermione had been laying out brochures about various career options, pushing him to choose something.
Harry shook his head. “No. I want to look at you, you gorgeous man.” He slathered his cock in lube and positioned himself at Draco’s entrance. Draco’s cock began to grow again, ready for more.
“Oh, it’s swelling. I’ve got a salve for that, if you would like.” Harry said nothing, which Draco took as his agreement. “Wait here, I’ll be right back.”
“Oh, my darling.” Andromeda folded him into an embrace. Draco hadn’t been held like that since he said goodbye to his mother nearly six months before. He wrapped his arms around her. She even smelled like his mother. They wore the same perfume. He couldn’t stop his tears. “You have nothing to apologize for. I am so sorry she hurt you so very badly.”
She handed him a long piece of rolled parchment. Draco unrolled it and skimmed. It was the “plan” for his safety, as well as the conditions of his release that applied at Hogwarts. At the bottom was the password for the Headmistress’s office so that he could seek her out at any time.
Harry stood and made his way to the kitchen, stopping to kiss Draco good morning on his way. He set about making the coffee, only using magic to boil the water, but manually measuring out the coffee into the French press. He carried two steaming mugs to the couch and curled up next to Draco.
He blushed a little but answered. “So fucking good. I...stayed the night. It’s real, Hermione. We’re like dating or whatever.”
“You are. And I have some ideas about how to celebrate your freedom and our graduation. And me finishing a year of school with no near-death experiences.”
The waiter filled their glasses with a bubbly, sweet wine that vaguely smelled of almonds. “To us,” Draco lifted his glass.
“When did that happen?” Harry whispered to Draco. Narcissa smiled at the two men and made her way into the stands with her sister.
Daisy peered out from behind Harry’s legs. “It’s all right. That’s a Patronus. You can use it to send messages to people, but it’s a very hard spell to cast. That’s my friend Ron’s. He and Rose are running a little late.”
Harry ran through his mental calendar. “I’ve got a pickup quidditch game with Ron and Seamus Tuesday. How about Wednesday?”
“I have an extra ticket to the Holyhead-Falmouth game next Saturday. I know you like the Falcons. And it’s not like it’s a...I mean, I’m bringing my niece, and...but if you can’t or don’t want to...”
He climbed off of Harry and kissed him breathlessly. They lay there for a long time, catching their breath.
Artemis and Remus were waiting in the Headmistress’s office when they entered. Draco’s heart started racing. This had to be terrible news. McGonagall tossed two pieces of paper on the ground and transfigured them into two more chairs for Harry and Draco. They sat.
“Voldemort’s curse didn’t fail in the forest. It killed me, but it took the Horcrux inside of me with it. I was dead, for awhile. In a place between. Dumbledore was there, and he cleared up some things. And then I had a choice.”
But after Padma said that Lavender was returning, and she hoped Parvati would start dealing better, something changed.  Neville Longbottom, the Unlikely Hero And Beheader Of Giant Ass Snakes, broke down in tears.
Draco could hear his heart pounding in his ears. It was so loud he didn’t hear the boy cast a stinging hex. It burned through his body.
Harry’s cheeks heated, and he resisted the urge to open his mouth and show off the contents to Malfoy. But they weren’t twelve anymore, so he swallowed his food and just said, “Fuck off, Malfoy.”
Hermione thought for a moment. “I think I already have, Harry. I couldn’t carry around that weight for this long. And knowing how coerced he was, well, yes. I can.”
He found Draco bent over a mound of paperwork at the dining table. He hadn’t heard the Floo, or if he had, he chose not to acknowledge Harry. Harry took a minute to appreciate the beautiful blond man who was lost deep in thought. He twirled his quill in his fingers and sighed over and over. Harry had grown to love watching Draco concentrate. He reminded him of Hermione when she studied, with an added air of confidence and a tinge of arrogance.
Malfoy returned with a tin of salve and a mirror that he handed to Harry. Harry murmured a quick thanks and sat on the leather sofa. Malfoy sat opposite him on a matching armchair, watching Harry apply the salve to his bruised eye.
Draco looked up to see a seventh-year Ravenclaw he didn’t know by name. He had definitely called Draco names before. And spat at him. Draco’s heart started to race. He had become too confident walking around Hogwarts alone.
Harry counted coins from a pouch he kept by the door near his keys. “Right. Well, it’s good to see you again.”
“Yes, actually.” He reached for the flask and took a long drink of whiskey. He closed his eyes and savored the burn as it ran down the back of his throat. “I’m not excited to be back, Neville. I should be. But I’m not.”
“Well, Daisy needs a know-it-all about this world. And I need someone else to help me answer all the questions she asks. It’s a win-win.”
“Here you go. Put this on then I’ll adjust it for you.” Draco handed Harry a black, pinstriped suit, black Oxford shirt, and a Slytherin-green tie. “Leave your shoes out here, and I’ll transfigure them.”
It took some prodding, but Draco managed to hand Harry his wallet. Harry was relieved to see a few twenty-pound notes inside, and he hailed a taxi to Draco’s flat. Draco began to undress the second they were inside, and Harry was far too drunk for this situation. His head swam as Draco flung off his trousers onto the sofa. His arse looked so good in his boxer briefs. His tie ended up on the floor, and he stumbled down the hall as he unbuttoned his shirt. Harry made sure Draco made it into the bed before Flooing back to Grimmauld Place. There, he collapsed into his own bed. He had a drunken wank as he though of Draco’s chest and arse and that strip of hair that led to so much more. Then he fell asleep, fully clothed, cock out, and dreamed of dying.
“Da-da!” Teddy cried and reached out his arms. Remus walked up and took Teddy from Andromeda. When he saw Narcissa, his mouth dropped. Draco watched as his mother’s eyes widened. How odd, he thought.
“Gee, Hermione. How could I have not noticed it? Oh, right. I was attempting to not be killed in the Triwizard Tournament by a madman and his creepy fuck of a minion.”
Harry gave him many reassuring squeezes and kisses. Hermione, too, was extra friendly to him. But when they were off mingling, Draco sat with Arthur and the Grangers. They were the first Muggles he had ever met.
Harry stood on shaky legs and turned off the shower but made no effort to leave the stall. “I think I like blokes. And girls. Both.”
Harry passed Malfoy the pad thai and shoveled more green curry on his plate. “It could go under MLEP,” he suggested. “They’ll be enforcing the laws the most, right?”
Shaky, Draco craned his neck to study the woman behind him. The resemblance was uncanny, but Andromeda had brown hair instead of Bellatrix’s pitch black. And tears were streaming down her face. That meant it definitely wasn’t Bellatrix.
Hermione put her book down and sat up. “The Halloween Ball that starts in three hours? The Halloween Ball that every other girl in this dorm is currently getting ready for?”
Draco watched all the jaws drop around the circle. He smirked. He felt a sense of pride at being the first person to know, even before Hermione and Ron. It had taken Harry a couple of weeks to say anything. Draco was proud of him.  “I’m bisexual,” he said again. “And I’m angry that it took me so long to realize it. I’m angry that Voldemort took so much of my childhood and teenage years. I’m angry that I’m eighteen years old, and I just now have the time and mental energy to experience normal teenage emotions. And I know that anger is a secondary emotion, but I don’t know what the first emotion is yet.”
Draco nodded. Blaise disappeared into his bedroom. Draco stood, staring at his feet. There was only one bed left, and Harry had to be the one to make peace.
By the next Friday, Harry had all but forgotten about his encounter with Malfoy. Pushing papers for ten hours a day at the Ministry had that effect on someone. It was mind-numbing, and there was always more to do. He pulled extra hours every night that week.
Vernon had died prematurely of a heart attack just three years before, and Dudley had been on a weight loss journey to avoid a similar fate. (“I’m down three stone,” he bragged.) Petunia still lived on Privet Drive and had joined various ladies’ clubs after Vernon’s death. Dudley worked as a foreman at a factory, and his wife worked as a bank teller.
When they stood to leave, Harry thanked Dudley for the meal. He nodded and gave Harry a warm smile. “Listen, Harry. I was a right shit to you growing up. And the way my parents treated you—well, I’m a parent now, and I can’t imagine treating a kid like that. You saved my life, and you had no reason to. I’d really like to stay in touch. I want you to meet Brian and Meredith. And I’d love some help introducing Daisy to your world. I don’t know much about it, and well, Meredith knows nothing but what I’ve told her.”
She shook her head, and her face grew serious. “No. I’m going with you. I placed a request to visit your mother. I heard back yesterday—the warden and Narcissa both agreed to it. I have the thirty-minute block after you.”
He knew she didn’t believe him, but he wasn’t sure what was bothering him. Rather than think on it too much, he grabbed another round of drinks for the table.
He went off onto a discussion of his travels with Narcissa over the last decade, and Harry hung on his every word, enraptured. He wasn’t sure why he had never traveled abroad, and he mentioned this to Draco. “You really should. No one should live in a bubble. Trust me, I should know.”
“I didn’t set out to make Harry fall in love with me, if that’s what you’re implying. Sir. We ended up as roommates and partners on a Herbology project, purely by coincidence. We became friends.”
“Well, yes, partially. But I tried to find you even before she was born. I didn’t know if you were even alive. I’m glad you are, by the way.”
Harry blushed, but he looked thoughtful. He leaned in and whispered. “Fine. He’s a, erm, grower, not a shower. But one time his bedcurtains weren’t drawn completely, and it was above average.” He gestured with his hands.
The next night, he met up with Hermione and Ron for drinks, as usual. They frequented a small pub in Muggle London to avoid the press. Hermione waved at him from their usual table in the corner. A pint of ale was already waiting for him.
“Contrary to popular opinion, the world does not revolve around you, Potter. Mine certainly doesn’t at least.”
Just then, Ron and Rose entered the shop. Harry waved them over and introduced them to Daisy. By the time Daisy was finished with her ice cream, she and Rose had declared themselves best friends.
She ended by teaching them a breathing technique for when they felt overwhelmed. Draco had to admit to himself that he did feel calmer after they did it. In for four seconds, hold for seven, out for eight.
“Fuck. Fuckfuckfuck.” Harry banged his head against the shower wall. He let the water scald his skin. “Fuck.”
Christmas at the Weasleys was every bit as crazy as Draco expected. It wasn’t just the Weasley clan, of course. George had invited Angelina Johnson, and they seemed cozy. Charlie Weasley had a boyfriend. Hermione was there, with her Muggle parents who seemed extremely uncomfortable. Arthur Weasley couldn’t stop talking to them.
Draco then led him to the river for a sunset boat ride down the Thames. They held hands as they watched the sun settle down behind the London backdrop. When the boat let them off, Draco didn’t let go of his hand as he took him to a restaurant for dinner. A Michelin-starred restaurant.
Draco took a deep breath and followed Harry into their bedroom. Ron was already unpacking. “Hey, Harry. So, I was thinking, if we put up those spells that we used in the forest, would it be cool if Hermione was in here every now and then? She’s pretty loud, but I think that—”
Draco sighed and planted one more kiss on Harry’s lips, just to shut him up. “I’m sure. Go visit the Weasleys before Molly sends you a Howler for Christmas. I will be fine.” Harry raised an eyebrow. “I will. And if I’m not, I’ll be home to you soon.”
“Honestly, Potter. You have the attention span of Cornish pixie. What do you think about asking Blaise to author a draft of the law? He speaks legal-ese a lot more fluently than I do, and he is a renowned solicitor.”
“Go away, Rita.” Harry gripped Draco’s hand. He turned to find a crowd of other reporters watching them. He pointed at one of them. “You. Blodgett. You’re an ethical one. Do you want an exclusive with Draco and me?”
In the bedroom, Draco noticed Harry walking funny. “Oh! I’ve got something for that. You’ll love it. I got the recipe off a bloke in the States. Brilliant potioneer and one kinky fucker.”
Hermione and Ron already had a portkey booked to Australia for the day after graduation. Neville was getting a Herbology Mastery under Professor Sprout. He and Luna had leased a flat with Ginny, the newest member of the Holyhead Harpies, in Hogsmeade. Blaise was planning on studying Magical Law, and he and Draco were friends again.
The crowd seemed to disappear as he and Draco held each other’s gaze. To Malfoy, indeed. Only Draco Malfoy could turn his past into the greatest cause the wizarding world had seen in decades. Only Draco Malfoy could convince Harry to stop running from his past. And only Draco Malfoy held his future. “To us,” he mouthed.
“Of course, she will.” Harry stood. “And since she’s a mother, it will be extra powerful.” He gathered his belongings to go home when he remembered the Quidditch tickets. “Hey, Draco?”
Harry stood awkwardly in Malfoy’s living room, taking in his surrounding for the first time. It certainly wasn’t Malfoy Manor. In fact, it was a really nice flat that could have been a television set on a primetime drama. It was sleek and modern, decorated in black and white and silver. It certainly didn’t look like a place a member of the Sacred Twenty-Eight would call home. The living room opened directly into the kitchen like those American homes he saw in magazines sometimes. He noticed stainless steel appliances and marble countertops. The windows overlooked the London skyline. This was an expensive flat.
“Fuck. I don’t know.” He crossed his arms and looked at the ceiling, chewing his lip. Draco had the oddest urge to hug him. “I didn’t know how to help him feel better.”
“Great! I’ll see you then.” Malfoy turned and left Harry alone in the loo, wondering what in the hell had just happened.
Harry looked at them and smiled. He waived his wand, and a moment later, a silvery cloak flowed through the air into his hand. “Here, Luna. Use my cloak, and go into Hogsmeade with Neville.”
Hermione leaned back in her desk chair and studied her best friend. He knew he looked happy and sated. She couldn’t wait for him to just admit he was head over heels in love with Draco Malfoy, and she hoped Malfoy felt the same way. It was weird, but it made sense in a way. After all their shared history, their obsession with each other, it just fit.
The next day, Harry ventured out into Diagon Alley to do some of his errands. He picked up owl pellets for his African wood-owl, Oscar. He dropped off some robes to Madame Malkin for tailoring. Then he went to the Potioneer’s shop to replenish his stock of potions. Normally, he ordered by mail, but it was a lovely summer day, and he enjoyed being out and about.
“There’s something I wanted to talk to you about. Could I buy you a drink at the Leaky? Say around six?”
“Great. I’ll just, um--” Harry gestured toward the toilet and limped past Draco. He closed the door behind him and opened the tin. He let out a small moan as the salve healed him. Draco was right; he felt better almost instantly. He washed his hands and opened the medicine cabinet to place the salve inside. A familiar bottle caught his eye. Yes, just a few drops, and Draco wouldn’t have to know about his nightmares, at least, not yet.
The first vote was on a new tax on high-risk potions ingredients. The summary of the law was read out, then the Chief Warlock opened the floor for ten minutes for final comments from members of the council. If no one wanted to speak, it would go straight to a vote. Several members spoke in opposition to the tax, but it passed by a narrow margin. Next up was a bill to cut the budget of the Hit Wizards. It did not pass. Harry zoned out on the next law: something about expanding healing magic rights to mediwitches or something. He did not hear whether it passed.
“But I’m the only blood-related nephew, therefore, I have to be your favorite. How are you, Aunt Andromeda? Here to see Teddy?”
The tears didn’t stop even when he couldn’t write anymore. He undressed and lay on his bed, drained and exhausted. But sobs racked his body, and he had never felt more alone. He stopped crying sometime around the first light of Saturday morning.
Harry finished up and went to wash his hands. When Malfoy finished a moment later, he had to stand right next to Harry, as there were only two sinks. “Lovely weather we’re having, don’t you think?” Draco still had that polished, aristocratic lilt to his voice. Even after ten years, it still felt familiar to Harry, though not at all evil.
Life settled into a happy and hectic pace for the eighth years. By March, Artemis had decided to decrease group therapy to once a week and started giving them extra coping and life skills on Fridays. Draco had two potions masters willing to work with him, depending on his NEWT scores. He was still worried about his hearing and life after Hogwarts. He could live with Andromeda, but he couldn’t help feeling like it was too much for her to offer. He hoped the Ministry would return Malfoy Manor soon so he could sell it and make some money.
Another awkward pause. Harry searched for something to say but came up short. Draco broke the silence.
“Celestina, huh? Really? I want to hear about this later.” Draco glanced at the clock. “We’ve got an hour and a half. Do you own a suit?”
Draco slipped in a second finger. Harry’s back arched. “Harry, I’m going to fuck you like this while I blow you because I want to feel you come down my throat.”
Harry covered his hand with the lube. Draco lay on his back with his knees up, exposing himself. He let out an embarrassing whine when Harry teased his hole. But Harry was too horny to tease much. He slipped two fingers inside Draco.
Malfoy had asked if they could spend Saturday meeting with Blaise Zabini, but Harry had promised to take Daisy to Diagon Alley for the first time. As excited as he was to introduce Daisy to her new world, he had a sinking feeling of disappointment at not being with Malfoy. He tried to tell himself that it was just because he felt so dedicated to child services now. But the little voice in the back of his head, which had always sounded vaguely like eleven-year-old Hermione, kept tutting at his lies.
“Ron may never like Malfoy. But he’ll be fine.” She would ensure it. “I’m happy for you, Harry. And Ron will be, too. Now, I really must get back to work.”
On the day of their grand opening, Harry Floo-called in his order. Forty-three minutes later, there was a loud knock on his front door.
Malfoy had all but disappeared after his trial. He got off with time served thanks to Harry’s testimony. One week later, Harry had received a short, handwritten note from Malfoy, thanking him for his appearance in court. Then he had disappeared from public life.
“I have no idea,” Draco whispered back. He sounded as shocked as Harry.  “I’m sure we’ll hear all about it on Thursday.” He was right; Narcissa left no gossipy detail undiscussed at Thursday dinners. Visiting with the Malfoy matron was better than reading the newspaper and gossip magazines.
Harry sighed. “I wrote that thing about my aunt and uncle, you know, so you and him can write the statement for the Prophet. Anyway, he read it and came over and hugged me. And we talked.”
Harry crawled out of his cupboard to the sound of Uncle Vernon's booming voice demanding Harry make breakfast. But when he served the eggs and toast, it was not to his uncle. Voldemort sat at the kitchen table and berated Harry for overcooking the eggs. He drew his wand and Harry screamed. He cast Sectumsempra but the curse flew past Harry onto teenaged Dudley. Harry screamed and rushed to his cousin's side. “Where is Daisy?” Dream Dudley panted over and over as blood gushed from his wounds. They were no longer at Privet Drive; instead they were in that bathroom at Hogwarts. Harry looked around for help. Draco swooped in dressed in billowing black robes as if he were Snape.
Harry shrugged. “Sometimes everything just feels like too much. I’ve been doing this mindfulness stuff for years. Hermione gave me a book on it after the war. It helps.”
Steve showed up just then, allowing Draco to finally cross to the threshold to the rest of the world. He sighed at the small taste of freedom. He loved Hogwarts, and the grounds were big, but he hadn’t stepped outside them since September first.
Harry was stunned. He knew Lucius Malfoy was a vicious man. But he had always assumed that Malfoy had been a loved, spoiled child. Harry stared at his hands. “I never knew...”
Harry laughed. “Fuck off, Draco. You should be thanking me. Unless you wanted to walk in on them in the toilet, or worse, on the couch in the middle of the night.”
Professor McGonagall dismissed them once Draco assured them he was fine. Artemis let Draco know she was available if he needed to talk. Outside of her office, Draco threw his arms around Harry and planted a huge kiss on his lips. “I’m free, Harry!”
Harry kissed him. They had other things to talk about, other less visible scars to discuss. But there was time.
Draco smiled, and then he pointed out Ginny scoring another goal. Harry felt a lump in his throat, and he had so many emotions that he couldn’t place. He wanted nothing more than to wrap his arms around Draco and hold him. Instead, he mouthed a thank you and Draco nodded. They turned their attention back to the game.
Harry waited for Malfoy to continue. “I suppose I should start with my project that I mentioned. Or maybe before that. I don’t know. It’s all so much, and we don’t know anything about each other and...”
For the major event that happens in Draco's life in this chapter, I have a disclaimer. If Draco's reaction seems abnormal, I can assure you it is not. After I wrote it, the same thing happened to me. And I reacted just like Draco.
“I’m trying to get a law passed through the Wizengamot and establish a new department. Or office under an established department. We are still trying to work that out. Anyway, I’m working on child welfare.”
Harry nodded. Draco studied the map a bit longer before folding it up. Harry tapped it again and said, “Mischief managed.” The map disappeared.
Draco waved at them from near the ticket booth, and Harry led Daisy over. He felt nervous, introducing Draco to a family member. He had not anticipated how great Draco would be with children. And when he handed Daisy a pair of bright pink Omnioculars, the little girl threw her arms around Draco’s legs.
Artemis nodded. “Yes, but none of Neville’s other friends reacted the same. What was really going through your mind?”
Draco looked up, boring his silver eyes into Harry’s. “Harry, please don’t get mad at this suggestion. And it wouldn’t be just you; I would, too. But I think you need to share your story about the Dursleys. Not all of it, of course. All the public really knows is that they were abusive. It was one-line in a story from nearly seven years ago.”
“I’m going to need a lot more of an explanation than that, Harry James Potter. You can’t just casually tell your boyfriend that you died and expect me to drop it.”
Draco groaned around Harry’s cock, and Harry looked down. He realized that Draco had a hand wrapped around his own swollen prick, rubbing himself while pressed against the mattress. It was enough to send Harry over the edge. With a shout, he spent himself in Draco’s mouth. Draco swallowed but didn’t stop sucking. Harry kept moving his head up and down until he felt Draco tense. His lover moaned and shuddered.
After that, the conversation flowed easier. They talked about Quidditch and a recent law passed by the Wizengamot. Harry asked how Narcissa was faring, and Draco inquired about Ron and Hermione. Draco had become interested in much of Muggle culture, and they shared similar tastes in music and movies.
Draco grinned. “Emotional. But good. Mother always told such fun stories about her. If it weren’t for my father and their parents, I think Mother would have reached out to her.”
Much of the workload would be project-based. Most teachers assigned them individual projects. But in Herbology the next day, he found himself partnered with Potter. Just his luck. Well, Potter may be a lackluster student, but he wouldn’t allow that to affect his grades. They were to plant, grow, and harvest various varieties of fluxweed in differing conditions through the year, with a final report on the results and recommendations for Herbologists and Potioneers.
Andromeda handed him a small box wrapped in red paper. The tag read, “To Draco, from Mother.” It wasn’t her handwriting, though.
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. He hated when people thought they owed him some life-debt. He had just done what he had to, what he thought was right. He told Draco as much. “And you saved my life, too. At the Manor. At the Battle, when you tossed me your wand. And Draco, I have so much to apologize to you for. I still feel so much shame about sixth year, when I--” His voice hitched.
A map of Hogwarts appeared, full of tiny dots with people’s names. Every person at Hogwarts was on the map. Draco let out a low whistle. “This explains so much.”
Draco nodded and bent down to talk to Daisy. “Daisy, did you know your Uncle Harry is very famous among the wizarding folk?”
Harry opened his mouth to reply, but he was saved by the appearance of Daisy with a stack of books. “Can we go see the goblins at the bank now?”
Harry swallowed down the bitter Dreamless Sleep and rinsed out his mouth with some Muggle mouthwash by the sink. He took a quick piss and returned to Draco’s room. Draco was already under the covers, reading a book while he waited for Harry.
Professor McGonagall met him at the grand front doors. Her lips were a tight, straight line as she nodded at him in greeting.
In response, the hand fondling Harry’s balls worked its way further back toward Harry’s throbbing entrance. The soft tip of a finger circled the hole, and Harry bucked further into Draco’s mouth. He felt Draco smile around his cock. Draco may be the one on his knees, but he was also absolutely the one in control. Slowly, Draco inched a finger inside of Harry. Harry cried out at the sensation. It burned slightly, but he relished it. It only took a few more deep sucks before Harry felt his balls tighten. With a loud grunt, he spilled into Draco’s mouth.
They took turns summarizing letters they had received from Draco’s teachers and the Headmistress. Two of them praised him for his change and for sticking to the terms of his probation. Shacklebolt remained neutral, as he was by far the most professional Minister in years. Well, when he wasn’t drunkenly singing karaoke, that is.
As if he were a student again, Harry procrastinated on his statement about the Dursley’s all week. It wasn’t just a potions’ essay he didn’t want to write. Writing this required Harry to confront some of the darkest parts of his past, something he had managed to avoid for a very long time.
Draco pulled at Harry’s shirt, and soon, their clothes were discarded. They pulled and stroked each other’s cocks urgently as they kissed on the couch.
Draco also didn’t expect any gifts, except perhaps from Harry. But he had a new wand holster from Steve, a subscription to
Harry reached down between them and grabbed Draco’s already-hard cock, making Draco gasp. “I want to go down on you,” Harry said.
Harry smiled at him. “I could say the same to you. You didn’t have to accept my offer of friendship this time, not after I rejected yours so many years before. But I’m glad you did. I love you, too.”
“Yeah.” Harry shrugged. “Well, I didn’t. But the team set up a sting and caught them in the act over by Weasley’s.”
Harry pulled away to take in the sight of a panting, sweating Draco. He met Draco’s eyes and licked his lips. “You’re delicious.”
Harry bent down low over Draco’s back so he could get deeper. He moved faster and reached around to squeeze Draco’s cock. He sped up his strokes, faster and faster, his left hand never leaving Draco’s weeping erection. He felt Draco tense again at the same moment his own balls tightened. He squeezed his left hand and rammed his hips hard against Draco.
They walked toward the Hospital Wing side-by-side. “That was a Slytherin maneuver, Potter. I’m impressed.”
Back at Hogwarts, Draco assured Steve he was fine. Steve was skeptical, but Draco only wanted to talk to one person. And until Harry got home, Draco wanted to lay down and cry.
Harry paused with his fork halfway to his mouth. The question took him off-guard. No one ever asked him if he still enjoyed the Aurors. He was Harry Potter, after all. Everyone seemed to think he was destined to spend his life fighting dark wizards, having vanquished the worst of the lot at only seventeen. In fact, he hadn’t even asked himself this. But now, Draco’s question opened up a lot of feelings he had not realized he had.
He moved his lips to Harry’s neck, kissing his prominent Adam’s apple as Harry swallowed hard. He didn’t push, didn’t say anything. Harry would tell him if he was ready. But Draco really hoped he was. He wanted to fuck Harry, too, but he would let Harry bring that up first.
Harry was a babbling mess by the time Draco slipped a third finger in. Good. Draco’s multitasking was relaxing Harry. Draco wanted his first time to be perfect. Draco pulled his mouth away with a pop.
The day before graduation, Draco received a letter from his mother. She was free from Azkaban, but she had to live under house arrest for two years. She would be living with Andromeda. Draco decided to go see her as soon as he was free. He would bring Harry so they could really, truly meet.
“Draco, you need to relax.” Draco opened his mouth to protest, but Harry held up his hand. “Go finish brushing your teeth and put on some fucking clothes.” So I don’t pop a boner right here. “Then we’ll go over everything before we leave. Do you have a Calming Draught?”
She looked…small. Her pale skin used to be a thing of beauty, but now she just looked sickly. Her platinum hair had lost its sheen. She wore a drab grey robe that looked filthy.
Draco blushed. He didn’t know what to say. He thought about how he had waited seventeen years to hear his father say those words, but he never heard them. Draco cleared his throat and nodded at Remus.
“Yeah. Oh. That feels good.” Although he often got off with his own finger or a toy, it was just so much better when it was someone else. “Move your finger around till you find it.”
Harry swirled his tongue and loosened him until Draco was screaming incoherent strings of words. He wordlessly summoned the lube from his bedroom and slicked up his cock before getting on his knees and lining himself up with Draco’s beautiful arsehole.
Harry knew he should start unpacking but his small bag of essentials felt embarrassingly inadequate next to Malfoy. Instead, he decided to crack on with his apology.
She threw herself back onto the seat next to him and gave him a wide smile. “How’re you feeling?” Harry shrugged helplessly, and she shook her head at him. “Do you want to go for a walk?”
“Don’t say that, Harry. This is just a blip - you’ll be back together before you know it. You just have to make an effort.” Hermione patted his arm.
Once Harry had selected an outfit and had it approved by Draco, they headed down to the entrance hall, a moderately sized room with a large fireplace at one end for receiving visitors. They were expecting a number of their close friends and family through here for a small morning tea and tour, before the arrival of the press and officials.
The rest of the interview continued in this fashion: Skeeter asked inappropriate and insensitive questions and Harry refused to answer. By the end of it, he was almost shaking with anger.
Harry nodded. He’d heard that during one of Davies’ more manic team talks. He and Oliver had been fierce competitors during school, but they’d also been friends, which only seemed to make Davies more paranoid about the prospect of playing against him in the World Cup as he knew they were equally matched in their passion for winning.
She directed him to a seat opposite and sat back down, tucking a lock of her long dark hair behind one ear.
Harry and Malfoy kept their word: they didn’t see each other again, but that didn’t stopped them calling one another every once in a while. Harry knew it wasn’t a good idea, if anything was going to distract him from playing it would be Malfoy, but when he was all alone in a hotel room in a foreign country it was pretty difficult to resist the call of the little silver phone.
That was probably the largest piece of personal information Harry had ever received from Draco voluntarily. He felt a little guilty exploiting his vulnerable state but it was too good an opportunity to pass up.
“How’s your arm after that game against Wimbourne last week?” Ron slapped Harry on the back, making him choke on his pastry. “Catching the Snitch when it was right next to Williams’ head was brilliant. I thought he was actually going to cry.”
“He has.” She nodded. “But he hasn’t fixed everything. He probably will never be able to have the kind of public image he wants. So do you see the problem? You will always have the power in the relationship. You will always be able to control his happiness with one word to the media.”
His mind wandered to Malfoy. The Scottish team had beaten Belgium about four hours ago, and so he’d probably still be there. Harry wondered if he’d be in his hotel room too.
“Exactly,” Malfoy sighed. “That’s why I always go out. It’s less depressing to go back to someone's flat, even if you don’t sleep there.”
“Like to see you try,” Krum laughed too. There was another short silence, more companionable this time. “You and Malfoy, you are in love?”
Harry could hardly hear the pounding music over the rushing in his ears as they inhaled each other. He could taste tequila, salt and lime in the corner of Malfoy’s mouth, and smell his cologne and hair. It made his head spin more than any drink. He gave in to the sudden and overwhelming urge to lick the salty sweat from the hollow in Malfoy’s collarbone and was rewarded with Malfoy’s fingers gripping his hair painfully and deliciously.
She sighed in faux disappointment. “Such a shame. This would be an excellent opportunity to clear the air and get your story out to the public.”
“I can’t believe you’re going on a blind date,” he sniggered down the phone. He was in Belgium with the Scottish team. “That’s incredibly sad.”
“It’s lucky Wood’s such a good captain, he’d always stand up for his players,” Angelina said with a proud tilt to her chin. “We need leadership like that in Quidditch.”
“Davies, can you tell them to cut it out?” McLaggen yelled as he dodged a particularly vicious Bludger from O'Flaherty. The captain turned from where he was showing reserve Chaser and Beater Delila Matthews and Peregrine Derrick a tricky move he’d been developing, and rolled his eyes.
Harry didn’t feel better. How could Harry be attracted to someone without knowing it? It didn’t make any sense.
He watched Malfoy work with fascination, his white-blond hair brushing Harry’s stomach as he moved up and down with a grace that Harry could only dream of. He was kneeling and leaning over so Harry couldn’t see any more of him than his head, back and hands, but that was enough. Malfoy’s back was a thing of beauty: pale, scattered with a handful of freckles that moved with the muscles underneath, and so strong.
“Oh no, you don’t,” she hissed and then turned to speak to the room at large. “Alright, you lot, clear out! Maid of honour and best man need five minutes alone with the bride.”
Would Krum tell anyone? Harry wasn’t sure. He pictured, as he had done so many times before, on the front page of the Prophet in the morning: ‘Potter embroiled in illicit affair with fellow Seeker.’ He felt ill.
Harry pulled her into a side hug to hide the mistiness in his eyes. He had a sudden overwhelming urge to tell her everything about the trip, and about Malfoy. She would know what to say, he was sure of it, but he just couldn’t get the words out.
Draco blinked at him again but before he could reply the mediwitch  turned back to them. “You should stay, Mr Potter. Mr Malfoy needs someone to keep him company until the potions begin to kick in, and I’m sure he’d rather it be you than me. I’m no good with all that Quidditch talk.”
“Oi, Potter.” Harry nearly fell off his broom in surprise at the sound of Draco’s voice. He turned to see what he wanted. “Maybe if you spent more time looking for the Snitch and less time simpering over your fans you’d have a World Cup already.”
Truth be told, it wasn’t. Harry had roomed with Cormac on a few occasions and more than once had been forced to sleep on the sofa in Angelina’s room. But he didn’t want to give Malfoy the satisfaction of admitting that.
He raised his hand and knocked, a little more forcefully than he had intended, and then almost fell face-first into Malfoy when he opened the door.
“Yes, I do.” Harry turned to him finally and found his face unreadable. “You’re underestimating how much help you’ll need.”
“You’re up early.” Draco’s voice made him jump slightly and he turned to find him standing in the doorway in his striped pyjamas and a tartan robe. He looked soft and sleepy, if a little wan.
“You’ve got to say what you want out loud and then tap your wand against the plate and it’ll appear straight from the kitchen,” Angelina instructed.
Harry rubbed a hand through his hair. “But it isn’t about the general public. We don’t even talk about it with our friends.”
Malfoy pointed an accusatory fork at Harry. “I don’t know what game you’re playing, but I'm putting a stop to it. I don’t need you to be nice to me to soothe your wounded conscience.”
“Yes,” Malfoy said quietly, still not looking at him. “But I still don’t know what you want from me. Do you want an apology or to apologize?”
“I don’t know if I’m gay. I might be bisexual.” Harry felt oddly proud of himself for saying it out loud.
The corners of Krum’s eyes crinkled and he looked for a second nothing like the stoic Bulgarian Harry knew. “Yes,” he replied simply.
“At least, don’t become one right now.” She paused, but when he didn’t say anything she barrelled on. “You’ve been saving people for almost your whole life. It isn’t fair.”
Draco watched with pride as the room quieted for him. Seeing the way Harry could command respect without even meaning to never failed to set Draco’s heart racing.
It worked well: they both enjoyed taking the edge off after a stressful game and it was nice to have something to look forward to that wasn’t just having a lonely wank and falling asleep with his socks on. Harry knew that it was only a matter of time before things got more complicated but for the moment it was too much fun.
“Oh, shut up. You know what I mean.” Harry hoped that the dim light in the room hid his embarrassment.
Harry frowned. “I don’t think that’s actually traditional,” he tried to protest, but Ginny was already tugging him to his feet and dragging him to the dance floor.
“You know, you’re a lot of things, Potter, but I never had you pegged for a bigot. It’s refreshing that even after all these years you can still surprise me with your ability to reach new and exciting heights of wankerdom.”
“Nothing,” Harry stifled another chuckle. He certainly couldn’t explain it to him. “You know, you’re a lot less of an arse off the pitch.”
“I was hoping you were going to say you hexed the git,” Ron grumbled. “Although it’s probably good you didn’t or you might’ve been banned from playing today!” His face brightened at this, and he gave Harry a hearty slap on the shoulder.
Malfoy’s eyes flicked across Harry’s face, and then he smirked slightly. “Or perhaps not. Perhaps the reason you’re moving out isn’t that you were disgusted, but because you’re jealous.” He was looking down at Harry now, voice low. He took another step forward and they were so close together now.  “Is that it? You wish you had your cock in some bloke's mouth?” He paused for a millisecond. “Or would you prefer to be the one on his knees?” His breath washed over Harry’s face, minty and warm.
He didn’t hold it against her but it also didn’t help their already fracturing relationship. He never ended up moving back into their flat, he’d gone straight from Ron and Hermione’s spare room to Grimmauld Place.
They watched each other quietly and he realised that it was the first time they had really been alone in a very long time. She was just as beautiful as she had always been, the wind whipping through her shoulder-length hair. She had some kind of green glitter on her eyelids and it made her eyes look even bigger and browner than usual. She reached out and tucked a lock of his hair behind his ear and for a moment he was so tempted to lean forward and kiss her, like muscle memory.
She wet her lips, “What then do you have to say of the rumours about clandestine nighttime meetings between Mr Malfoy and Ms Weasley?”
“No.” Harry stopped and forced himself to smile. “I’m sitting with you to eat my lunch. Is that alright?”
When he’d woken up in St Mungo's a full day and a half after the match he had been in tremendous pain, but that paled in comparison to the agony he’d felt when Ginny had told him that they’d lost. Everyone had told him not to blame himself, that it wasn’t his fault that the Bludger knocked him from his broom, but he wasn’t interested in hearing it. He knew that he had had the hopes of the whole of England on his shoulders, and he’d thought somehow that if he could win the World Cup it would help to heal the wounds of the war. But he’d let them all down, and the guilt and anger had made him feel physically sick.
“I’m trying. You…” His voice trailed off. He swallowed. “You make me believe that maybe it’s possible I am.”
“And the Auror Office is ridiculously lax with their dress code. But this is an important meeting with the two most powerful men in government.”
“Potter, thanks for coming. I ordered us each pint, if that’s all right.” He gestured at the table, where two amber ales sat, enticingly cold and frothy. Harry sat and took a large sip.
“Harry! Draco! Come in, come in.” Harry rolled his eyes. Stressed Hermione always sounded like her mother with that high-pitched, saccharine voice. But he’d never tell Hermione that because she was the most powerful witch he knew, and she would hex him.
“There’s plenty of time for that. Next time, the only toy I want is that thick cock of yours up my arse.” Draco ran a hand up Harry’s bare thigh.
Harry sat the food on the table and let Draco pull him down for a hello kiss. It felt right and normal, like they had been doing this for a long time. They had, of course, been meeting up for a while now. But the kissing was new, and Harry liked it very much. He prolonged the kiss as much as he could before he was interrupted by his stomach. “I’m hungry. What are you working on?”
Harry thought for a bit. He had been fine for years until Draco and Dudley appeared in his life a few months ago. Maybe Draco was right. “All right. Fine.” He stumbled through piecing together the dream and relayed it to Draco. It sounded stupid out loud but Draco didn’t react. He just nodded, listening.
Draco moved his head and pushed Harry’s knees further apart. “Look at that gorgeous, tight arsehole. I’m going to give you the best orgasm of your life.”
Draco shrugged. “I can usually get a table here. They know I tip well. I just thought such an auspicious occasion deserved a meal to match.”
Draco knelt with his knees on either side of Harry’s head. “Open your mouth, love.” But Harry’s mouth was already opening as he said it. He braced himself on his hands and lowered his weeping cock into Harry’s mouth. Harry locked his lips around the shaft, and Draco began moving his hips.
“Relax, Potter. We have plenty of time to figure out that stuff. You don’t even know my ring size. But yes, I’ll move in with you.”
“That’s quite sweet of you, Harry. Thank you.” She kissed Harry on the forehead and grabbed Neville’s hand. “Let’s go, love.”
Malfoy eyed him. “Just because you testified at my trial doesn’t mean you have to be my friend. I still think you’re a pompous arse.”
Draco shrugged. “Perhaps it’s not about honor. Perhaps it’s only about absolution, a chance to take control where I never had it before.”
Harry followed Draco down the London street to a pub. A Muggle pub. Draco held the door for him, then they sat down at a small table in the low-light bar. A waitress took their orders, and Draco threw in an order of chips to share. Then he surprised Harry even further when he took out a Muggle bank card and opened a tab.
“Sorry, Harry,” Hermione said. “But it does make sense. If you hadn’t quite realized you were gay back then, perhaps that obsession was more about lust than suspicion.”
Harry’s head popped into the fireplace just moments after Draco entered the eighth year common room. His voice was soft. “Hey, babe.”
“No. Well, yes. Well, see the thing is...” Harry ran a hand through his hair. He had never been eloquent, but he could usually at least get a sentence out. He took a deep breath. “I’m resigning from the Aurors.”
“Hurry up, you slag.” Harry’s voice was raspy, breathless. He looked down at Draco, and the sight of him on his knees was almost too much. Draco smirked up at him, his grey eyes twinkling.
McGonagall wrapped up her speech and dismissed everyone to their common rooms. Several people grumbled about the new requirements, including Ron who kept insisting he was fine. Remus led the eighth years to the third-floor wing that had once held a three-headed dog. It had been turned into a new dormitory, and the entrance was marked by the painting of Sir Cadogan.
Another loud pop pulled him from his thoughts. It wasn’t like Steve to be early but when he turned around, he saw Andromeda smiling at him.
Hermione had seemed lighter after that. Just admitting it helped a lot, she told them. She had scheduled an individual session with Artemis. Ron opened up at the next session about losing Fred. Terry Boot talked about his nightmares.
Harry didn’t hold back. He was loud. Blaise could probably hear them, and that filled Draco with a wicked sense of delight. He set to work moving up and down on Harry’s shaft. He used one hand to stroke the base while he sucked and licked. The other cupped Harry’s full, velvety bollocks.
On top of the Malfoy sightings, Dudley had called Harry just a few days after their unlikely reunion. He invited Harry to his house for dinner. And it was strangely normal. Their kids were sweet and smart, and they liked their new Uncle Harry very much. “Can they call you Uncle?” Dudley had asked. “First cousin once-removed doesn’t have the same ring to it.”
“I don’t know. I just…I don’t think I realized that what I was feeling was…that. Honestly, I haven’t given much thought to it. I kind of recycle the same three, you know, fantasies.”
Harry let out a laugh as he straightened and turned to face Draco. He pulled his naked lover into his arms and kissed him. He didn’t remember the last time felt so sated. Draco pressed his forehead against Harry’s. “That was...”
Malfoy scoffed. “You’re welcome, by the way. I’d never live it down if I let the Saviour of the Wizarding World get hit by speeding hunk of metal.”
Hermione pushed Harry aside and gave Remus a hug. “I’m so glad! You were the best teacher we ever had. Where’s Teddy?” she asked.
Draco put one strong arm around Harry’s buttocks to help move him, urging him to go a little faster. He reached the other hand between them to jerk Harry off. He wasn’t going to last long, not with Harry’s arse tailor-made for his cock, so he wanted every moment to be amazing for Harry.
The awkward silence continued. The younger students at the other tables chatted, but it wasn’t the same. Harry watched as Draco shoveled food around his plate, barely eating a bite.
They sat at Harry’s kitchen table. Harry summoned plates from the drying rack and dipped out some food for himself and Draco. “Want a beer?”
Hermione had finally coaxed it out of him one Saturday night. She pursed her lips, but Ron laughed. “It makes perfect sense, Hermione. Harry’s clearly had the hots for him for years.”
Over the next three weeks, the highlight of Harry’s week was ordering curry and having it delivered by Draco. He had at least admitted to himself that he had a crush on the other wizard. He was quite enjoying the fantasies of Draco bent over his dining room table, that perfect arse in the air ready for Harry’s cock.
The eighth years mumbled a yes, but no one addressed Draco. The first to take a seat were the three returning Slytherins: Blaise Zabini, Daphne Greengrass, and Millicent Bulstrode. They sat as far away from Malfoy as possible.
A second finger entered, and Harry pushed back against Draco’s hand. He heard Draco chuckle, but he was quickly losing himself to the sensation. This time, Draco found the small spot of pleasure, and Harry’s cries bordered on screams. Draco slipped in a third finger, flexing them to fully stretch Harry, who was panting. “Fuck me, Draco. Fuck me now.”
They stood by the door, neither making a move to open it. Harry’s eyes trailed down Draco’s face to his lips.
They played a game of exploding snap in front of the fire wearing nothing but their pants that night. Harry had bought them a large handle of firewhiskey that afternoon, and they sipped it while they played.
Harry tried his best to forget what Ron had said. Draco and Harry hadn’t been enemies in ten years, after all. And they were just business partners. At least, that’s what he told himself. But it was true that the evenings at Draco’s apartment had turned friendly. They talked about Quidditch and shared a loathing of the Chudley Cannons. Harry told Draco all about Daisy and her discovery of the magical world. Draco told Harry about the men and women Narcissa had dated over the last several years. Harry learned that Draco and Narcissa had traveled extensively after their hearing in hopes that the public would forget their name. Harry told Draco what Muggle primary school was like. Their conversations stayed light, though, never going into their dark family lives or their violent past with each other.
Malfoy had the audacity to come after him. Harry ignored him, and replayed their conversation just now. Rather abusive. Yes, that’s what starving a child is. Beating a child. Berating a child. Using a child for slave labor. Fuck Malfoy’s privileged ass.
Harry froze and met Malfoy’s eyes. He would never have thought the man that sat before him would be capable of apologizing. But this whole evening was bizarre. “For your coffee table nearly taking my eye out? Who has a glass coffee table, anyway?”
“I cried. Hermione cried. Ron clapped me on the back and said I should marry his brother, Charlie.” Harry smiled at that. Draco felt a twinge of jealousy, and he shoved it down.
Harry felt Ron let out a sigh. He had not wanted to leave his parents or George, but he hadn’t wanted to leave Hermione more. Hermione reached across the table and patted her boyfriend’s hand.
“I’ve missed you,” he said, without really meaning to, and her eyes widened. “Not like that! I just mean… I’ve missed being able to hang out with you.”
Benjy studied Harry’s face carefully, and then sat back in his chair and took a sip of his drink. “Hmm.” He looked thoughtful. “That’s a tough one.”
“Poor guy,” Ron said, looking less concerned. He grinned wickedly. “I’ve heard the Magpies reserve Seeker is bloody awful.”
“Thanks,” he replied absently. “I’m fine.” He paused for a second, then shrugged. “I’m sleeping with Draco Malfoy.”
As soon as Harry got back to camp he sent Pansy Parkinson a letter. He didn’t necessarily expect a reply but he needed to at least try. To distract himself from the stress of waiting for a response he went for a practice fly, which kept him busy until sunset.
Draco blinked his eyes rapidly, trying not to break down. He cleared his throat but was unable to say anything. Harry squeezed his thigh. His mother was incredible, making sure he received a gift even though she was locked away.
The long walk to the castle’s front doors was ominous. More than once, Draco considered whether he’d be better off at Azkaban. A lump grew in his stomach, a familiar friend at this point. The near-constant nausea that Draco had experienced for two years had returned in force the last few days.
Harry laughed again, and it was nice to hear. “Someday I’ll tell you how terrible Yule Ball was. Or better yet, ask Parvati.”
Harry grinned. “Great!” He filled Ron in on their progress. The cause was something Ron and Hermione fully supported, and they had promised to help promote it to the public. Harry and Hermione hated using their fame for anything but good, and with the entire Golden Trio behind it, it shouldn’t be hard to convince the public to support the new law.
He looked down at his erection, disgusted by its betrayal. It had been hard since Draco had started talking about cocks. And then when Draco said that thing about
“If he can’t come, I’ll stay here with you. Molly won’t even notice I’m not there. The Burrow is crazy on Christmas.”
“With Andromeda. We’re co-parenting. I’m glad I like my mother-in-law. And I can’t think of a better place to raise a child than Hogwarts.” He cleared his throat. “Well, have a seat here.”
Harry took an overjoyed and exhausted Daisy home, Apparating directly into the Dursley’s back garden. He promised he would see her tomorrow then headed home to collapse. Kreacher had dinner waiting. He ate quickly before he fell asleep on the sofa, exhausted from a busy day and a sleepless night.
“You’re not a vampire.” Draco stepped back from the doorway, allowing Harry entrance. Harry stepped into the open-air apartment. He had not been here in nearly two weeks, since the night Draco asked him to share his story. He had missed it. Draco stood in a white t-shirt and a pair of grey basketball shorts. Harry had never seen him so dressed down, and fuck, he looked good.
“You’ve got a house. You’ve got plenty of money to live off of. You might talk to someone about investing the money for a passive income. But you have no obligation to pick a career just because.”
“Now, as you are all eighteen years of age, you have some added privileges. First, you can come and go from Hogsmeade as you see fit. That means if you’d like to pop into town for dinner or spend a night away for…privacy…” His eyes studied Ron and Hermione, who were cuddled up together in an armchair. “…you are welcome to do that. If it starts interfering with your studies, we’ll have a different conversation.” This time, he looked pointedly at Seamus.
Ginny met them outside of the locker room. She threw her arms around Harry. They had ended amicably years ago, both realizing that young love didn’t mean forever. Now, Harry mostly viewed her like a sister. Daisy was smitten by the Quidditch star, and she suddenly turned shy. But Ginny was sweet and bent down to talk to her. She gave her a photo of the whole team that every player had signed.
“I’m not obsessed.” But even Harry realized his voice was less than convincing. He decided to change the subject. “Guess who else I ran into this week.”
The rest of the day passed in a blur of laughter and food and, oddly, the Minister for Magic starting karaoke with his booming and slightly off-key voice. It was the strangest and most fun Christmas Draco could remember.
The common room was warm and cozy, with mismatched couches and chairs. It was decorated with banners from all four houses. There was a beautiful painting that looked like a patchwork quilt made of all the house colors. Remus asked them all to take a seat.
Draco chuckled. He stroked, moving his wrist several ways to see what Harry responded to best. He kissed him, on his lips, his neck, his chest. He bit his nipples and used his free hand to tug on Harry’s hair. Harry babbled a string of obscenities.
With a few quick Scourgifys and fresh clothes, Draco and Harry Flooed into the Leaky Cauldron two minutes past five. Applause burst forth from the crowds of their friends and family as they entered. Draco blushed and squeezed Harry’s hand. Cameras flashed as they made their way to the bar. Harry told Tom the barman to charge everything to his tab.
Hermione and Ron shared a glance that Harry couldn’t read. Ron spoke first. “I doubt he’s up to anything, mate. He’s not a Death Eater anymore.”
“With all due respect,” the youngest representative interrupted, “Mr. Malfoy has already been put on trial and sentenced. We are here to determine if he has met the conditions of his probation. That’s it.”
“What the fuck am I doing here? You Apparated me to your house?” Harry grabbed his wand and pointed it at Malfoy, who drew his in response.
“What? Yeah, it will be fine.”  He gave Draco a reassuring kiss and took his hand, leading him to the door. Hermione flung the door open before they could knock; she must have been watching out the window.
“Me neither. Too much…too much happened here. I already have been getting shit sleep at home. How am I ever going to sleep at Hogwarts? Not even sure the whiskey will do it.”
Dawlish’s voice boomed across the courtroom. “The Child Services Law passes and becomes effective on 1 January 2009. This session of the Wizengamot is dismissed.”
Harry waited a few minutes to avoid running into Malfoy in the corridor then headed down to Hermione’s office in the Magical Creatures department. “Hermione, you won’t believe what just happened,” he said as he pushed open her office door and collapsed in a chair opposite her desk. “I’m getting a drink with Draco fucking Malfoy tonight.”
Harry didn’t sleep at all that night. He had written down everything he could remember about his childhood with the Dursleys. He was sure that Draco didn’t need that much information, but once he started writing it down, he couldn’t stop. Tears flowed from his face as he wrote. He remembered the hunger pains he had felt so often. He remembered how it felt when Vernon and Petunia hit him. He remembered the fear he felt all the time.
The Hufflepuffs lit up one of the blunts and passed it around the common room. Draco leaned over to Harry and said, “You know, you aren’t responsible for Dean and Seamus shagging in Neville’s room.”
Malfoy studied his schedule for the year. The nausea returned. First up, at nine a.m. every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday was the group therapy McGonagall had mentioned. And today was Wednesday. Bloody hell. He knew he couldn’t skive it off. Attending all classes, unless Madam Pomfrey signed off on an absence, was part of his plea deal. But he had no intention of talking about his feelings, especially as the only Death Eater at school.
“Tonight’s the night my parents died,” Harry said suddenly as they climbed the staircase to the third-floor corridor. Draco squeezed his hand. “I forgot all about it until just now.”
Harry was a quick learner. Soon, he was fucking Draco with one hand and stroking him with the other. Draco cried out as he spilled himself over Harry’s hand. Harry ran his tongue over the sensitive head of Draco’s cock.
“All right then.” He placed his book on the nightstand and extinguished his lamp. “I’m tired. Some brute of a man decided to ride me like a Firebolt. Good night, Harry.”
“And the sky is blue, and the grass is green. Yes.” He paused. “Shit. Did I really upset you earlier?”
Lavender Brown returned that night. She had some nasty scars but otherwise seemed happy to be back. She even hugged Draco in her excitement.
Meredith was a lovely woman, and as different from Petunia as anyone could be. She had accepted magic as a part of her life now. They both had, because they adored their daughter. Harry now went over for dinner every Wednesday, and the evenings were largely spent asking questions about the wizarding world. Harry had even promised to take Daisy to Diagon Alley with Ron and Rose. Daisy was very excited to meet another witch her age, especially one with a flower name. She had already decided they would be best friends.
It had been a slow few weeks for the Aurors, and Harry was relieved to get an out-of-office assignment. It had been getting harder and harder to look busy at his desk. The case was hardly thrilling, and Harry would be home after a couple hours of Obliviates, but it was something to do. Harry had never learned how to handle tedium well. Something about having a homicidal maniac out to get you from age 11 had left him easily bored.
He licked a tentative stripe up the underside of Draco’s shaft. Draco grabbed the sheets in his fists. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d had a mouth on his prick. Close to a year, probably. An image crept into the edges of his memory, and Draco pushed it away. He needed to lose himself to the feeling of Harry’s mouth.
“I can’t stop drinking. If I stop drinking, then everything just feels like too much. Everything the Carrows did…so many Cruciatus curses…I thought for sure I’d end up going mad like my parents. And then I feel so guilty that I didn’t, but they did. And I can’t…I just have to keep drinking. But Luna…” Tears started flowing freely again. “Luna said I have to stop or it’s over between us. And I love her so much, but I don’t know how to stop.”
Just after the Easter holidays, the eighth years were in Herbology. Draco and Harry were furiously taking measurements and notes of their fluxweed harvest when the door to the greenhouse opened. Professor McGonagall stepped inside. She whispered something to Professor Sprout, who frowned.
“I expect all of you to treat each other with the utmost respect. If the Wizengamot, the Minister, the Headmistress, and the rest of the staff feel that Draco is welcome here, then he is. Is that understood?”
While Harry enjoyed the evenings working with Malfoy, and he felt like he had a cause worth fighting for the first time in a decade, his nightmares had returned in full-force. He made a pact with himself to only use Dreamless Sleep once a week, just to catch up on the broken rest. He also had increasing anxiety about going out in public, instead sending a very old Kreacher to do his errands. The ancient house-elf didn’t have the energy to do both errands and housework, so Harry had taken up cooking and cleaning. It was a nice distraction, and it was the only time Harry could really practice his mindfulness lately. Plus, Kreacher’s commentary on Harry’s dusting skills was hilarious.
A few moments later, the other door opened. Draco stood. Narcissa Malfoy shuffled into the room, her hands and feet shackled. Draco’s breath caught as he took in the sight of his mother.
“Dark Lord was a dick. A big dick. I hated him. I wanted you to save us all. And you did. You really did. You’re so good, Harry. And I try to be now. But I wasn’t.” And then Draco burst into loud, sloppy, drunken tears. “I’m so sorry. I’m really sorry.”
Harry grunted. Hermione and Ron also had trouble sleeping. But not him. He slept too much, but he was tired all the time. They passed the flask back and forth for a few minutes. Hermione and Ron reappeared, slightly disheveled. Hermione half-heartedly scolded them for drinking.
A ten-pound note of Muggle money fell out of the envelope. “I’m British and can’t handle my gin. How embarrassing. Buy yourself coffee on me this morning.”
With a quick shower and fresh clothes, Harry and Draco stepped through the Floo twenty minutes later. Most of the eighth years and Ginny and Luna were already there. They greeted Draco and Harry with cheers. Blaise bought Draco his first beer of the night, and Millicent gave Draco a hug. All was right with the world.
Harry tried not to laugh. “No, mine is a stag—a boy deer. Everyone’s is a different animal, and you don’t know what it will be until you cast it the first time.”
Draco wasn’t anywhere in the dormitory, so Harry fished out the Marauder’s Map from his trunk. He hadn’t needed it all this year. He scanned the map until he saw Draco’s name. He was in the library.
Malfoy was still gaping when Ron finally headed to the shower. “He’s not a morning person,” Harry explained. “And you better get used to seeing his bollocks swinging everywhere. I think he’d be a nudist if he could.”
Ron wasn’t feeling well on Saturday, and they canceled their usual plans. Harry thought about going out to the clubs and trying to pull—it had been six months of only fucking his hand, after all. But he couldn’t be bothered to get dressed up. Instead, he ordered curry and slipped a movie in the VCR.
“Tell me what you want,” Harry growled. He bit Draco’s neck. “It’s your day. You get whatever you want.”
“Oh, bugger. You were fast. Sorry, I’ll be out of here in a moment.” She fastened her last button and leaned down to kiss Ron. “See you at breakfast.”
“Uh.” Harry fiddled his thumbs. “I didn’t like seeing him upset. And I didn’t like that you weren’t doing anything.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, but he pulled down his shorts. His long cock sprung forward, and Harry’s eyes widened. While it wasn’t as thick as his own, Draco’s prick was one of the longest he had seen outside of porn. Draco grinned as he took in Harry’s expression. “Scared, Potter?”
Harry had just finished tying the laces on his black Doc Martens when there was a knock on the door. He couldn’t fight the shit-eating grin on his face when he opened it to see Draco looking suave in a sky blue shirt and black trousers.
Draco grunted at the noise and spooned Harry tighter, but he didn’t wake. Harry fumbled for his wand to cast a tempus charm. 7:45. He really needed to get up so he could get dressed and make it to work on time. But Draco’s bed was soft, and Draco was warm. It felt comfortable. He could get used to this.
The next few weeks passed in a blur of stolen kisses, rushed handjobs, and interview requests. Harry took as many of the first two as he could and declined every interview. McGonagall informed them that Draco was receiving his fair share of hate mail, and they had intercepted several jinxed letters. Harry wouldn’t let Draco walk anywhere by himself unless he used the invisibility cloak. He was too worried after the events of Halloween. And Draco had to admit it was nice to be worried about. It was also nice walking everywhere with Harry.
