Sometimes, Draco still had to pinch himself because he was rather sure he was only dreaming. How could he be there, Harry by his side, after everything that had happened? Draco wasn’t sure yet if he even deserved to love Harry or not, but at least he didn’t find himself as immensely bad a person as he once had done. Now he understood much better that he hadn’t made his sixth year's choices because his soul would be black and unsavable; there had been much bigger forces steering his life back then, not letting him have control over himself almost at all.
“Harry! For goodness sake, where’ve you been?” Hermione exclaimed when Harry sat down at the Gryffindor table for dinner.
Draco winced. “I don’t know. Have just happened to be at the dinner table when they’ve talked about these things. And my mother and aunt Bella have told me all about their cousin, the so called blood traitor Sirius Black,” Draco said.
“I think I’ve already done my bit,” Harry argued. “I’ll write a detailed, ten-page essay about what happened in the Astronomy Tower that night if that makes you happy.”
,” he continued, and the Auror swayed a little as he got the full control of his mind and body back.
are alright? You seemed to be a bit upset when you left,” Hermione said, clearly with an intention of not dropping the subject.
“Could they make a product just for Malfoy? A candy that turns you into a ferret or something? Would be nice to let him experience that again as he seemed to appreciate it a lot last year,” Harry said, and both he and Ron turned their gazes to Malfoy, snickering.
“No, although I don’t want to try to make excuses. Everybody should realize dead family members are nothing to joke about.
Soon an intense stab of pain pierced Draco's arm, spreading instantly all over his body. But despite the pain, Draco felt oddly relieved. As if the invisible hand had disappeared, and he was finally able to breathe again.
“Oh, but look at him. I think I’ve never seen him looking like that,” Andromeda said, making both of the boys turn their gazes at the baby.
But there was no way getting around the fact that by letting Potter save him, he might be able to save his mother. Potter was most likely right, even if Draco would never admit it to him. It was naive to think that after executing him, the wizarding community would all of a sudden get their happily ever after and just sing and dance hand in hand all around a flower meadow. They had already killed so many people completely wantonly, and their thirst for blood and revenge wouldn’t end to him.
“Shh, Dobby, please, keep quiet,” Draco said, trying to make Dobby calm down. “Yes, I think he is in trouble, but I’m not sure. Have you seen him anywhere today?”
Harry felt so exhausted. The lesson had been a nightmare so far and he knew that had only been the beginning of it. He was full of Snape’s lecturing and the disgust he could hear in Snape’s voice and see in his eyes.
?” Harry said, giving a dry laugh and feeling all the pent-up feelings starting to come out. “We’ve danced around the topic for the whole month and I’ve really tried to ignore his Mark, but I don’t know how long I can keep going like this.”
Huh, this chapter was pretty exciting to write :D It's been a lot of fun to read your thoughts about how this might be going because for some reason I thought it would be easy to guess (everything seems always so simple and logical in one's own head... or not really). Anyway, now things seem rather bad but there's still quite a long way ahead.
“You know, you’re such a perfect boyfriend for her,” Harry said, grinning and squeezing Ron’s cheeks. He might be a little drunk, but he wasn’t dumb. Ron surely wanted to see Hermione was doing okay, but Harry was quite sure Ron had also a secret, sex-related agenda to find Hermione so desperately. Because that was what you did when you got drunk, right? You got horny and wanted to push your tongue into someone’s mouth. Or everyone’s mouth. Muggle movies had really been very educative.
“No! Yes! I don’t know!” Harry exclaimed. “I need some time to think, this is too much,” he continued, turned around, and left the bathroom, Draco’s weeping echoing in his ears.
Draco felt relief spreading all over his body. Potter was many things, but he was never cruel. He wouldn’t tell Draco that his mother would be alive if she really wasn’t.
Harry sighed. “I don’t think they’ll buy it, but maybe they won’t ask anything as this isn’t a habit for me.”
Six feet, three feet… Soon they were flying side by side, both stretching out their hands towards the small, golden ball, and Harry was sure he could already feel his fingertips touching the snitch’s fragile wings.
To his surprise, Draco ended up hanging in the common room much longer than he had originally thought. It helped him a lot to study together with someone, and he actually felt like he learned something as Granger’s enthusiasm for the subject was so contagious he felt getting quite excited as well. At first, Draco had been well aware of the cold stares he was getting, but no one dared to say anything, probably because he was there with Granger. After an hour or so he had forgotten almost completely that there were other people around them, and when Granger started to yawn and said she’d go to sleep around 10 p.m., Draco felt confused by how fast the time had gone.
them some nonspecific day in future. He had fought a war, for Merlin’s sake, he could go through this. At least he thought so.
“Oh, no. It was Dean’s task to bring some but he forgot,” Seamus said. “But hey, it’s always the first cup that is the most difficult to swallow. Then it gets easier,” he went on, patting Harry’s shoulder encouragingly.
“I still haven’t found anything new to stop the executions,” Hermione said, frustrated, and picking nervously her nails. “I think I’ve gone through almost all the juridical books in the Wizarding world I’ve found, and they all seem to have the same conclusion: the executions without trials are always illegal except for when there’s some sort of state of emergency in the society.”
“Kind of,” Harry said. “Look, I don’t want to talk too much about things that concern him, he can tell himself.”
“Are you being serious? Why would this change anything? Except if you’re having a huge crush on me,” Ron said, grinning. “– you’re not having a crush on me, right?”
As Harry neared the table, he spotted Draco standing in front of it, scrutinizing the selection of the bottles.
exactly like her when she was the same age. Once Nymphadora wanted to taste our pet Kneazle’s tail, you can only imagine how well that ended,” Andromeda said, looking fondly at another picture of her daughter.
The look on Draco’s face turned immediately disgusted. “Ugh. Is this really what Muggles are used to drink?”
Harry turned to his back, starting to stare at the ceiling and listen to Ron’s even snoring. Merlin, how would he get through a day with an overenthusiastic and energetic baby on no sleep?
As Christmas drew closer, both Harry and Draco became a bit nervous about leaving Hogwarts. Or, well. Maybe it was only Harry. Draco kept on telling him how Voldemort wouldn’t even notice Draco’s existence at the Manor as Voldemort definitely wasn’t interested in recruiting underage wizards. Besides, no one knew for sure if Voldemort would even be there. Still, solely the slight possibility of Draco being in the very same building where Voldemort might be strolling around gave Harry the shivers.
“Er, you too,” Harry muttered, a bit confused. He glanced questioningly at Draco, who just shrugged.
“Hermione, what do you know about pureblood stuff?” Harry asked, slumping on the couch next to his friend in the common room. There was so much in Harry’s mind he didn’t really understand, and his thoughts felt like bursting out from his head.
“Oh, Potter, you should’ve seen Draco’s collection of the cards with your pictures,” Blaise said, snickering. “And after that Draco still couldn’t figure out how on Earth I realized he had a thing for you.”
“We were just planning how to hex you after the Quidditch practise, the one you and your friends so kindly decided to ruin for us,” Harry tried to say with venom, but ended up sounding calm. He noticed that the Slytherin no longer seemed to be angry either, so, probably for the first time in his life, Harry felt like it was hard to get annoyed with the git.
“Harry, you must explain me a bit better if you want me to be able to be in the same room with that brat.”
Harry held his breath as all the thoughts left his mind. He hadn’t really thought through his proposition before he had said it out loud, let alone thought Draco would just… comply. Slowly, Harry started breathing again, and when he noticed that Draco had relaxed and started breathing calmly, too, Harry sank his fingers tentatively into his hair.
The conversation between Draco and Snape is a slightly modified version of J.K. Rowling's version in the HBP.
“I’d like that. Very much,” Draco said softly, giving Harry a shy smile that made Harry feel like melting. God, he should take a grip of himself before he would complicate things by doing something as stupid as last night.
on your thoughts. They rather see one image here and another there, as if they were sitting on a train and viewing a rapidly changing landscape,” Ginny told Harry, as if reading his thoughts.
Once Harry had learned how to dodge Draco, his first school week went rather smoothly. That was until Blaise decided to approach him as he, for one, wasn’t scared of being seen in the company of a bunch of Gryffindors.
Draco pulled a little away from Harry and took a small, square-shaped present from his robe pocket. The present was neatly wrapped in a shimmering, dark-green wrapping paper with a silvery ribbon and bow.
state of emergency! The War’s over for fuck’s sake,” Harry cursed, feeling the anger boiling inside him.
“Well, we won’t lose anything if Harry goes to check the place? It’s not a commitment,” Ron said, shrugging and looking slightly more relaxed and less red.
But he also knew Draco hadn’t even been at Hogsmeade that day, so it was possible, or maybe even probable, that Draco actually had nothing to do with the whole necklace case. Harry tried to cling to that thought desperately, shutting out all the other voices in his head that were telling him how there was no way Draco would be completely innocent in this case.
After a couple of minutes, Draco arrived and stopped in front of the tapestry as well. He looked around in the empty corridor, looking a bit nervous.
”Hey, how did it go in Hogsmeade?” Harry asked, turning around on the couch by the hearth when he heard the portrait hole opening and saw Hermione and Ron coming in. Harry had been lucky as he had made it to the common room before his friends. He had even had time to fetch his Charms book and a cup of hot tea, so he looked like he really had been resting for the whole day.
“Hey!” Zabini cried out as Harry started laughing. Draco found somewhere another sofa cushion and hit Harry on the face with it.
When Harry’s friends had left, he took the package from the floor and studied it. Harry glanced around the common room, and as it seemed to be almost empty already, he dared to open the package.
“No, Draco, I don’t know,” Harry cried, cutting Draco short. “At some point, you’ve got to make the choice. It’s either me or Voldemort.”
“Yes, well, I suppose we’re friends. Or something like that,” Harry muttered, his cheeks heating up. “And we didn’t wrestle.”
Anyway, I've been writing this chapter (or the whole story in general) based on what I've learned in therapy, what I've learned from listening to people who have more or less experience of a broken/toxic background (alcoholism, violence or toxic ideas in the family, years of bullying, physical or mental abuse etc.), and what I've read about people who have been raised in families who have belonged to a really conservative religious group. After reading quite a few fics and Harry Potter books after a long break, it made me compare the pureblood culture with conservative religious groups and I started to see many similarities in them (how people think their own group is better than the others, how people outside of your own group are a threat, how it’s preferable to find a spouse inside one’s own group, how there are plenty of rules you have to follow to be able to remain as a member of the group, how there might be a lot of love in families but it’s dependent on one’s actions etc.), which inspired me to write this story. Anyway, in all the cases I’ve read about people who have been able to leave their family and community are those who are adults, living already on their own and having enough connections outside of the community in question, and even then it’s been an immensely hard and hurtful process. The only underage cases (that I know of) who have been able to leave their family are those who have had some sort of healthy and close adult who has kind of adopted them. Blaise, Ginny, and Harry were a good start for Draco to start to heal, yes, but far, far from enough in my opinion.
the teachers were trying to sneak a glance at them discreetly, although all of them were failing quite terribly at the ‘being discreet’ part.
“Er, maybe. But I kind of promised to keep his identity as a secret,” Harry said, running his fingers through his hair.
They didn’t have a chance to meet the next day, though, as the first time Harry had time to take a breath after their last encounter he was already in Grimmauld Place.
“I reckon it isn’t,” Harry said a bit gloomily. He knew there was no reason to avoid talking about Sirius as he couldn’t be exposed anymore, but Harry still didn’t like the idea of everybody knowing. “Thank you,” he said, turning his eyes to Blaise.
“Calm down, Harry,” Draco said, turning his eyes to Harry and starting to stroke Harry’s cheek soothingly. “I’m alright. Just didn’t want to worry you as you already had quite a lot on your mind. No one did anything to me, it was just… unpleasant.”
“Well, then, it’s less than two months until you’ll be able to see each other more regularly again.”
“A band-aid. It’s a kind of Muggle version of Healing Spell or something like that,” Harry said and dug a band-aid from his bag and put it on his wound. “I can’t do Healing Spells either, so these are quite handy if something like this happens.”
After just taking a couple of deep breaths and lying in his bed for a while, eyes shut tight, Harry had to admit he wouldn’t be able to fall asleep again and he definitely wouldn’t be getting rid of the headache anytime soon, so he rolled to his side, opened his eyes, and started to look for his glasses and his wand. Once Harry had put his glasses on and found his wand, he summoned a bottle of hangover potion, that instead of being in his trunk was under his bed for some reason. He opened the bottle with slightly shaking hands and drank its content at one draught.
“I know that, Draco. And I’ll – promise to try. If you promise to at least consider letting me back,” Narcissa said, sounding almost pleading.
“I’m a horny teenaged boy, wasted for the first time in my life. I’d want anyone at this point,” Harry said, making Malfoy back out a little. “But you absolutely most of all, god you’re so sexy I can hardly bear it,” he hastened to continue, grabbing Malfoy’s arse and pulling him back tightly against himself.
When Hermione and Ron had gone, Harry leaned closer to Ginny and poked her arm gently. “Are you alright?” Harry asked. He knew last year at Hogwarts hadn’t been an easy one for Ginny and Blaise, either, as the Carrows and their favourite students had used to torture Ginny and her friends, meanwhile Blaise had tried to help them as much as possible without getting caught.
“I think,” Draco said, pulling back slightly and sounding serious all of a sudden. “Well, I think –”
, but you hadn’t told anything even to Blaise! For fuck’s sake, you idiot, you scared the hell out of me! Don’t you dare to do something like that again!”
“It’s sick. I mean, the whole tradition is disgusting, but I can’t say I’d be too surprised Lucius Malfoy wouldn’t hesitate to use it,” Ron said. “No matter how much of a git Malfoy is, no one deserves to be treated like that.”
Harry closed his eyes and heaved a sigh. “Fine,” he said, letting finally go, pulling Draco closer, and kissing him deeply.
Just a random side note: if there are any Italian readers, congrats for winning the Eurovision Song Contest this year! Listened to Zitti e buoni on repeat while I was writing this chapter, rock'n'roll never dies and so on.
“No,” Ginny snapped, shooting a warning look at her brother. “You two stay here and solve whatever you happen to be arguing about,” she said before turning around flaming, red hair flying in the air.
“Look, I’ve no idea what kind of game you’re playing, but I’m really not going to tell anyone,” Harry said, trying to convince Malfoy of his sincerity. “No matter how much I, erm, dislike you, I really wouldn’t tell if you’re having some kind of crisis or something.”
“It’s okay. Thank you, Kreacher,” Harry said hoarsely. “I just saw a nightmare, nothing more serious than that.”
As Harry opened the door to the Room of Requirement, he found Draco in the Room, looking out of the window, glass-eyed. When he heard Harry entering, he turned around and blinked a couple of times.
When Harry was sure there was no one else nearby, he took Draco’s hand gently, and for the first time that day, the expression on Draco’s face showed some emotion behind the walls.
“It’s camomile. Andromeda makes it every time I can’t sleep or when I’m feeling nervous. It’s supposed to make you calm down a bit.”
Harry stared at Zabini blankly. “And what exactly do you want me to do? Malfoy’s behaviour towards me changes twice a day, I’ve no idea when he’s being real or what he wants from me. Besides, he has a girlfriend.”
Dobby drew his hand along his mouth, closing it as if with a zipper before he Disapparated away with another bang.
“Look at me,” Harry said, taking hold of Draco’s chin and turning his face towards Harry’s. “What are you thinking?” Harry asked, searching for some kind of an answer in Draco’s eyes. Even without his glasses, Harry could see Draco’s eyes were storming, full of anxiousness and fear.
“Not exactly,” Draco said, starting to squirm a little. “Just wanted to say that it was really nice of you to see me, and I truly appreciate how much you’ve helped Harry, with mobile phones and all,” he continued in a rather formal tone.
“No, I just wanted to fly to the Moon. Wanted to get as far away from the Dursleys as possible. I’ve never even been on an aeroplane, so I don’t know how it feels like.”
Harry tried his best to concentrate on breathing at the same time as Draco, taking deep breaths. Every time he was about to lose his concentration, Draco’s eyes locked with his even deeper, not letting him fall.
“Don’t worry, Harry. I’m sure the Wizengamot has to listen to me if I provide them with a pile of proofs about how harmful their decision is in the long run. I’ll show them some studies in black and white about this matter, and I won’t leave before they promise me to listen properly,” Hermione said, trying to smile at Harry reassuringly. “See you tomorrow,” she continued, giving Harry a hug before following her boyfriend and leaving Harry alone to ponder Draco Malfoy and Gregory Goyle and how utterly messed up the world could actually become.
When Draco didn’t make a gesture to follow Harry’s suit, Harry went cautiously to stand in front of Draco and took slowly off his scarf and robes. He waited for a moment, and when Draco didn’t seem to protest, he went on.
“Right, I’m ready now. Sorry you had to wait,” Harry said as they both stood up, jumped a little up and down and moved their fingers and toes to get the blood to circulate in them again.
Draco was quiet for a moment, as if he was enthralled by what he saw. “You know, there’s a story about them. Or rather a belief.”
When he had got the invitation to Seamus’s house party, he had hesitated for a while. It had, however, been so little time since the War, so he wasn’t sure if the only thing he was still expected to do was to sulk around like a mourning widow.
“No, I mean, I was just trying to get into the Room. You know, the one where we were together,” Draco said, blushing. “But it’s broken.”
When Harry made it to the entrance hall, he found Malfoy and Zabini hovering there already. They both glanced at Harry as he paced towards them, Malfoy reserved and anxious, and Zabini looking somewhat… hopeful?
obtuse. Maybe I could’ve actually learned something if Professor Dumbledore had taught me instead,” Harry snapped.
They went on a lighter discussion about Houses and their qualities. Soon they were both laying on the rug, stomach full and feeling content. Harry laid his head tentatively on Draco’s stomach as Draco started feeding Harry chocolate pralines and stroking Harry’s hair absentmindedly with his long, elegant fingers.
If nothing else, at least Draco’s room had remained the same with his huge four-poster bed with Slytherin green bedsheets, windows that always let the morning sun in, his potion set Severus had given him before he had even started at Hogwarts, and the walls covered by pictures of Draco’s friends and his Tornados posters. It had actually been rather comforting to have at least one place in the whole house where he had felt like everything had always been the same despite everything bad that had happened outside of the walls of his room.
When the school started again, Harry felt somewhat lighter than before leaving for the holidays. The whole autumn had been so stressful he hadn’t apparently even realized how much he had needed to have a short break from his life at Hogwarts. Seeing Draco doing fine again after the holidays was a huge relief, of course, and even the ordinary classes were fine, some of them actually even something to look forward to as all the sixth-years were finally introduced to Apparition. However, the lighter feeling didn’t remain for long as soon Harry noticed that Draco seemed to be sinking back into the gloominess, and this time Harry was slowly but surely following him. Blaise and Ginny tried persistently to come up with something normal and lighter to do with Harry and Draco, such as gossiping about the teachers and fellow students, doing homework together or having picnics and game nights, but it seemed to be a mission impossible to make either of them react with anything else than occasional grunts. During the nights Harry and Draco shared together, they didn’t usually say a word, but feeling the other’s body and hearing the other’s breathing gave a little bit of comfort to both of them.
Harry rolled his eyes once but remembered then Draco wasn’t able to see his reaction. “Probably, but that wouldn’t exactly be anything new,” he said. “So, how’s it going?”
Ginny rolled her eyes. “You know she fancies you. Everybody knows, it’s already common knowledge. Couldn’t take her eyes off of you during the meeting.”
“Ouch! That was a bit unnecessary,” Ron said sourly. “But, yes, I do think so, too, mate. Just go and get your prince now.”
Harry felt dumbfounded. He had guessed it’d be somewhat uneasy to work with Malfoy, but he definitely hadn’t foreseen Malfoy to say something cordial, let alone to stammer almost worse than Harry himself. Something had clearly changed between them, and it seemed like neither of them knew how to act around the other anymore.
and finally popping up as a conversation topic in ordinary, war-related conversations he had with his friends.
“They all know you’ve been friends with Ginny for years now and that you get along quite well with Ron, too,” Harry said, trying to sound reassuring. “Besides, Molly and Arthur know what you’ve gone through and that you didn’t have a choice. They don’t blame you for anything.”
When Harry hadn’t been willing to cooperate, Umbridge had threatened to use the Cruciatus Curse on him, which had almost made Draco make a dash for him for the second time that day. Luckily, only almost. This time it had been Granger who, unconsciously, had made Draco stay right where he was as she had started to explain about some odd weapon that was supposed to belong to Dumbledore.
They all stood up and grabbed their bags. When they started to pace towards the doors, Harry and Draco made sure to have long enough a distance between each other by walking on both sides of Ginny and Blaise, who were walking between them, hand in hand.
“Well, then, I’ll hear from you soon,” Draco said, sounding like he didn’t want to end the phone call. “Love you.”
“No? Didn’t manage to convince you yet? Hm, maybe we could come up with something, ah, gayer the next time,” Malfoy said, purring like a cat in Harry’s ear.
When Harry got out of the Great Hall, he snatched his Firebolt from the broom cupboard and stormed out. When he saw there was no one else in the courtyard at that time, he started running at full speed towards the Quidditch pitch, letting the cold autumn air ruffle his hair.
“Detention in the first week, this must be your personal record. Don’t you worry, as a prefect I can promise you this is just the beginning,” Malfoy said, now pacing beside Harry.
“I don’t know. I trusted him once and he still left me. Even though I understand now why he left me I can’t just get past it and pretend it never happened,” Harry said. “Besides, he said it himself, he’s not sure if he’ll be able to stay away from his parents.”
,” Draco heard the shout echoing feebly somewhere near the prison and suddenly felt his body begin to tremble rather violently.
“Oh,” Ginny said, sounding a bit disappointed. “Well, I’ll give you and Malfoy my blessing. But I’ll also keep an eye on him, just so you know.”
But when Harry opened the door into the common room, he was met by loud, happy chatter and laughter.
But hurting Harry had been something Draco never had wanted to experience and never wanted to experience again. The look on Harry’s face, so hurt, disbelieving and betrayed, had imprinted in his mind, haunting him both awake and when he was having nightmares, which was almost every night these days. Leaving Harry had felt like a piece of Draco had just died or gone lost, and he didn’t know how he could get it back. If he could ever get it back.
“You disowned me. You… Both you and father made it very clear I’m not your son anymore,” Draco said.
“I know, my love. I’m sorry,” Blaise said, smiling indulgently at her and giving her a kiss on her cheek. “Though I don’t know if I should be worried about Snape for real, he looks like he’s going to get a stroke if he doesn’t get to murder someone soon.”
Harry handed the bottle back to Malfoy, and it was then when he actually realized what he was doing. He was drinking with Draco Malfoy. And not only casually drinking, he was getting
Harry was outside, leaning against Hog’s Head’s wall after the meeting. He was relieved the meeting was over. Even though it had gone quite well, Harry still felt uncomfortable when people questioned if he was telling the truth about Voldemort’s return and Cedric’s way to die.
Draco felt his lower lip starting to tremble, but he had to try to stay strong; it would only make things worse if he showed any signs of weakness to his father. He tried to hold back tears, straightened his posture, and met his father’s cool eyes. But when he tried to open his mouth to say something, his throat felt too dry and hoarse for him to be able to speak at all.
He tried to linger as long as possible, trying to make his nerves calm down. When he finally went back, Malfoy was already ready, reading intently the instructions.
“Okay, okay,” Ginny said, smiling all the time more and more widely. “So, you really like this boy? You wouldn’t come up with a gift like this to just anyone.”
After a few minutes, Potter reappeared in Draco's sight, jogging towards him. “I found it, let’s go,” Potter said, wrapping his arms tightly around Draco again and lifting him up.
“Dobby,” Draco said, confused, as he saw a ridiculously colourfully dressed house-elf running to him and bowing deeply in front of him. “Er, please, no need to bow. I’m not your master anymore.”
Harry knew he shouldn’t have been happy about Ron eating Chocolate Cauldrons spiked with a love potion and falling in love with Romilda Vane on his birthday, but Harry couldn’t help but see that as a new opportunity to connect with Slughorn as he possibly couldn’t turn them away when a student needed an antidote. When Ron was cured, Slughorn seemed to relax a bit, and Harry’s plan went surprisingly well until Slughorn wanted to raise a toast in honour of Ron’s birthday. He opened a gift bottle of mead; mead, that turned out to be deadly poisoned. Either Harry or Slughorn didn’t even have time to raise their glasses before Ron had drunk his glass empty in a matter of seconds and ended up writhing uncontrollably on the floor. Harry remembered luckily the bezoar and thus saved Ron’s life, but Ron still ended up in the Hospital Wing, unconscious.
“Harry, he practically told he’s gay. It’s not seen very compassionately among pureblood families, especially in the families like Malfoy’s,” Hermione said.
“She’s brilliant,” Draco said, nodding. “There’s also someone else, Blaise, but he’s still in France and I don’t know when he’s coming back.”
“Malfoy,” Harry muttered. He was still so full of anger he hadn’t even stopped to think about how he must look like.
“I can make us more tea,” Draco said hoarsely as he bolted upright from the couch, seized his and Harry’s cups and rushed to the kitchen.
Draco looked at Granger uncertainly. He didn’t really fancy passing time in the common room these days. “I don’t know…” he said slowly.
Harry turned his eyes to Blaise. To be honest, he had been so blinded by the thought of choosing sides it hadn’t even crossed his mind there might stand something else for a reason to take the Mark than showing your loyalty. “You know why he took it, then?” Harry asked in a hoarse voice.
“Yes, Harry, seriously,” Draco answered softly, tucking a strand of Harry’s hair behind his ear. “I know that as a Slytherin I shouldn’t care too much about the fairness, but I still think it’d be nice if one of your friends knew about us as well. Besides, it sounds like the Weasley girl is at least somewhat trustworthy.”
That seemed to snap Draco back to reality. Slowly, he walked to the table and took a chair in front of the cake.
“Like what?” Harry asked, trying to sound casual even though his insides were twisting rather uncomfortably.
“Fine, I guess,” Harry shrugged. “Well, Hermione said something about loving me as I am. Ron was a bit surprised at first, but there was no drama or anything like that.”
“Merlin, no. Ginny’s the only one of my friends who knows. And one of his friends knows about us as well.”
Harry just stared blankly at the tree. It was weird to hear Sirius saying out loud Harry’s thoughts and hopes about Draco. Harry hadn’t dared to think too much about Draco changing sides, but maybe it really was possible if even Sirius thought so, in a way.
“Shh,” Harry could hear Draco, who had apparently woken up by Harry’s gasp, hushing him. “It’s alright. Just look at me,” Draco said, putting his hands on Harry’s cheeks and turning Harry’s face gently towards his own. “Now, just breathe with me. In and out.”
“Actually, neither can I,” Hermione said, sighing and looking like she was about to fall asleep over her essay.
Soon Malfoy’s breath became too fast and shallow, and his body went stiff again. Harry guessed these were the signs of Malfoy starting to freak out, so he broke the kiss and gripped the Slytherin’s wrist before he could even consider fleeing.
“Oh, Harry dear, you look still so thin. Would you like some more shepherd’s pie?” Molly asked, both squinting worriedly and smiling warmly at Harry from the other side of the kitchen table.
“For the whole day? Doesn’t seem likely, especially as Ron told me he couldn’t find you when he went after you,” Hermione said, narrowing her eyes suspiciously.
Ginny let out a sharp bark of laughter. “Hermione told me, would’ve loved to witness that. My dear, overprotecting brother,” Ginny said. “What about you? How’s it going with you and Cho?”
you’re not telling me. And I also happen to know I’m not part of your Golden Trio, but I hope you know you can talk to me. I want to be your friend, not just your friend’s little sister.”
Draco regarded her for a moment, frowning, but nodded as he found himself too curious to get to know what on earth the Gryffindor was on about.
Harry gave Blaise a small smile. He had somehow started to feel strangely fond of the Slytherin despite all his teasing and name-calling.
“They’re curious, they just want to know more about it and see if they can find life on another planets or galaxies,” Harry said, shrugging.
“Don’t thank me, this is not a favour. I trust you to stop this nonsense right away,” Snape said coldly. “Draco, you may go. Potter, you stay.”
Harry gulped. His throat felt suddenly dry and hoarse. “I don’t know what I could do anymore,” he said in a low voice. There was a long, oppressive silence after his words, and Harry felt his breath becoming fast more and more shallow. “Malfoy?” he cried, alarmed, being scared of being left alone in the middle of the mist.
The biggest problem now seemed to be that Harry had no idea what he should do next. Harry wasn’t really comfortable with his gay feelings, let alone gay feelings towards Malfoy. And what could he even do? There was no way he could just follow his instincts and push Malfoy against a wall and start snogging him in broad daylight. Harry grimaced at the thought. That would undoubtedly go well. Harry felt lost with Malfoy and his mixed signals, and he didn’t have a hint of what the Slytherin was feeling. In fact, Harry wasn’t even sure this wasn’t just some really twisted scheme to – what? Humiliate Harry? In any case, Harry was pretty sure even Malfoy wouldn’t go this far.
“He’s living there now, I s’pose,” Harry said, shrugging. “A friend of Andromeda’s had found him lost in the Muggle London, so Andromeda decided to offer him a place to stay.”
“I get that,” Draco said. “Or I don’t, actually. Don’t know how it’s to live without a parent, let alone either of them.”
“Oh, I’m not? Tell me, Potter, what am I to you then? A friend? An acquaintance? An old school comrade? You always used to make it so clear at school how much you liked me.”
“Draco!” Harry cried, grabbing Draco’s collar. “What’s gone wrong? Why wasn’t he supposed to drink that?” he continued and felt abruptly paralyzed as a sudden realization hit him. “The mead wasn’t meant for Ron, was it?”
After the mead incident, Harry didn’t know what to think about Draco and how to act around him. To be honest, it felt like some sort of a miracle they still managed to be together after all that had happened. In autumn it had felt like the things they weren’t able to share with each other were something that was itching under Harry’s skin, but it had been nothing so bad that would have made them drift completely away from one another. Now the earlier itch-like sensation had started to feel like a heavy weight on their shoulders, or like an elephant in the room; both Harry and Draco knew it existed, and the more time passed, the more difficult it became to try to ignore it.
“I so did. A purple, knitted hat with a bit of silvery glitter,” Draco explained nonchalantly. “He seems to have a thing for rather colourful clothes.”
“All so serious and concentrated but yet haven’t caught a sight of the snitch?” Harry yelled at Draco as he circled around him, teasing.
“You’re so fucking stupid, Draco Malfoy,” Harry said with a trembling voice, burying his hands in Draco’s hair.
Harry was quite sure his friends had noticed his withdrawal, but his time they didn’t ask anything. Harry didn’t know if it was thanks to his spectacular acting skills or because they knew there was a lot on his plate anyway. As if homework, detentions, gossiping and worry for Hagrid weren’t enough, now Harry and Ron had to worry for the future of their Quidditch team as well.
“No, of course not. Just told him I wouldn’t come to Hogsmeade with them and he didn’t say a word, just
would’ve needed more support and help, you were in an impossibly tough situation. No one, especially no one underage, should have to struggle alone with something you and Malfoy have had to.”
“Thank you for the best pre-Christmas party I’ve ever been to,” Draco said and kissed Harry square on the lips.
“Well, yeah, it’s been a good weekend. Yesterday could’ve gone worse,” Harry said and grinned at Hermione.
“Oh! That’s definitely one way to show your feelings. So, there’s absolutely much more involved than dislike,” Hermione said pensively. “What did you think about the kiss?”
“Of course,” Draco said, trying to sound reassuring. “I don’t want you to have two kids to look after.”
Draco refrained from answering. What was the point when the git would just burst into the room no matter what Draco answered?
Harry couldn’t resist the temptation as he suddenly put his hands on Draco’s waist and squeezed gently.
Harry sighed heavily. To be honest, he didn’t feel like seeing even his godfather. But it wasn’t fair to Sirius who had been all alone (if you didn’t take Kreacher into account, he wasn’t too much of a conversation partner anyway), locked in Grimmauld Place without being able to go out at all.
2.	Erik Engelv: Jag är inte död (“I’m not dead”; I think this one is available only in Swedish for now as it’s published only two months ago)
Harry didn’t seem to be alone with his thoughts as most of the eight-years seemed to go home or somewhere else on weekends if they only had the chance. Harry had also started to consider going to his own flat in London at least for one weekend, but as if reading Harry’s thoughts, Molly had decided to invite Harry, Ron, and Hermione to visit at the Burrow over the weekend at the end of October. A day after that Andromeda had owled Harry and asked him to visit her and Teddy, and so Harry got a chance for a much-needed break from the castle. At first, though, Harry had thought he would skip visiting Andromeda and Teddy as he knew Draco would be staying there as well, but when Draco had reassured him it would be completely fine with him if Harry stayed at Andromeda’s too, he had decided to sleep one night at the Burrow and one at Andromeda’s.
“I’m just happy it’s impossible to fly to the Moon with our broomsticks,” Draco muttered. “Didn’t you ever want to fly that plane thing?”
“I can see that,” Harry muttered as Ron came back, handing Harry a cup that was half full of, surprise, surprise, tequila. “
“Look, I’m going to say the sappiest thing I’ve ever said, and don’t expect me to ever repeat it,” Draco said, talking over Harry. “But the best gift for me is that you’re alright after what happened in the Ministry and that we’re together now. You scared the hell out of me, you know.”
As the door had closed after Blaise, Harry felt himself suddenly really strained. When he glanced at Draco, he noticed the other boy looked also quite uncertain, tapping nervously his leg with his forefinger.
Harry didn’t shout at Malfoy to try to make him stop and explain. Actually, Harry had quite a job to make his own body obey him before he was able to start walking slowly towards the Gryffindor Tower. Harry felt emotionally so overwhelmed he didn’t actually feel anything at all. It was a strange sensation, as if someone else possessed Harry’s body and made him walk forward, step by step. Even the sharp pain on Harry’s forehead and hand couldn’t pierce the coma-like state he had drowned in.
Harry felt like his hands started to sweat, the whole situation was so uncomfortable. “Er, something happened at the beginning of the fifth year, and –”
Harry handed now the letter to Ginny and took back the ring. It really wasn’t anything Harry would usually like. It was big, looked all too fancy and expensive and it had the Black crest on it. But the idea of having something that had belonged, or at least would’ve belonged, to Sirius, made him feel warm inside. He didn’t have much left from him and now he had something he could carry with him all the time.
“Potter,” Draco said dryly. “So you’ve decided to come to my last supper? Oh, how very considerate of you.”
“Harry, why are you staring at Malfoy?” Hermione asked, frowning. Now both Ron and Hermione were looking at him, which made Harry flush guiltily for some reason.
Their lips met, brushing tentatively against each other, and Harry knew he had lost himself again. Malfoy opened his mouth a little, and Harry slipped his tongue into Malfoy’s mouth, gently touching the other boy’s tongue. The kiss was slow and tender, both wanting to taste each other and learn how the other one felt like. Malfoy threw his arm around Harry’s waist and pulled Harry flush against himself, meanwhile Harry put his hand cautiously under Malfoy’s shirt, feeling Malfoy’s beating heart and lean, warm chest.
Harry let out a dry laugh. “Am not. Just learned a bit at the Muggle school I used to go before Hogwarts and have talked a lot with Hermione. She’s really the one with the brain.”
“No!” Harry exclaimed, desperate to be left alone. “I mean, thanks, but no. I just need a good night’s sleep and it’ll get better. See you tomorrow,” he said, waving his hand and leaving from the Great Hall hastily.
“I think I know what you mean,” Draco said, pensive. “I did have parents, but they were mainly so distant, and I had to pass most of the time alone. Quite often, I didn’t have anyone else to talk to than the portraits on the walls and the house-elves,” he continued and grimaced. “Merlin, that sounded pathetic.”
“Thank you for taking care of my son,” Narcissa said softly before Disapparating into the winter night.
“I mean it. Well, maybe I can admit he’s not as bad as I used to think,” Ginny said, smiling at Harry. “But, I’m sure he genuinely cares about you and doesn’t want to harm you, and that’s all that matters to me. I honestly don’t think he could ever hurt you.”
“Good luck, mate. The lessons can’t go on forever,” Ron said, attempting to give Harry an encouraging smile.
Draco’s pale cheeks turned slightly pink. “Maybe,” he answered. “Although I’m happy I don’t have to settle for the dreams anymore,” he continued, and Harry felt as if he was about to melt.
“Thank you,” Draco said, his cheeks turning red of embarrassment. He didn’t like the idea of Andromeda using money on him as he didn’t know how and when he could pay back, but Draco had learned by now it was a lost battle to try to change her mind when she had already decided something.
“Never mind,” Harry said, pulling back and taking Draco’s hand. “Come,” he said and dragged Draco to the couch.
it, I’d have said you’re a lunatic,” Draco said as they were both packing their suitcases for the trip.
Suddenly, Draco cut Harry off by wrapping his arms tightly around Harry’s waist and pulling him into a frantic, desperate kiss.
Harry could feel his hands sweating and heart hammering wildly in his chest, and it took all his willpower to keep his eyes on Snape’s. He didn’t even dare to breathe.
If Harry had got to choose, he’d have wanted to go on living happily oblivious about everybody who made him feel confused or anxious in any way, but that didn’t seem to be an option. After the Owlery incident with Cho, Harry felt like his tolerance didn’t budge anymore, at least not that weekend. And then, Malfoy just had to storm to Gryffindor’s Quidditch practise with a bunch of Slytherins as if nothing had happened. The Slytherins made Ron’s practise a hell by their mocking and catcalling, but even Harry had a hard time to concentrate. In fact, he was studying Malfoy’s expressions and gestures so intensively he almost got knocked off the broom by a wandering Bludger. Malfoy looked like himself, with a wide sneer on his face as he participated eagerly in the Slytherin mockery. Only once Malfoy happened to glance at Harry, and the hesitance in the Slytherin’s eyes was the only thing that revealed to Harry there was something unusual going on inside his head.
“Er, yes? I think so,” Harry said, fidgeting with his sleeves. “Just promise me you won’t tell anyone.”
As weeks passed by, Harry and Draco had managed to make it a routine to meet in the Room of Requirement a couple of times a week. Sometimes Blaise joined them, which Harry really liked. Although he didn’t know if Blaise was there because he enjoyed Harry and Draco’s company or rather because of the mobile phones, which, to Harry’s delight, seemed to be a success. Draco learned to use his phone surprisingly quickly, and soon he was much faster to write messages than a bit clumsy-fingered Harry. Both Draco and Blaise complained a lot about the keypad, and Harry had to agree with them; it didn’t make any sense one had to push a key three separate times to write the letter C or the letter V. However, the overall experience was still definitely positive, and Draco was so excited about the ringtones he was about to drive Harry crazy by listening to them over and over again.
“And I doubt Blaise will draw too much attention to himself right now. He’s considered as some sort of a traitor as he’s chosen to be Draco’s friend even after he was disowned,” Ginny said gloomily.
Well, maybe it was already an okay time to get up. Molly would probably be just thrilled if Harry appeared at the Burrow before midday.
One evening, the sky was so clear Harry and Draco thought it might be perfect weather for the Northern Lights spotting. They checked the aurora forecast, and there seemed to be a rather good chance to see them that night, so they decided to head to the shore of the Arctic Ocean.
Malfoy studied Harry cautiously and took a step towards him. “Fuck, Potter,” Malfoy said, raising his hands tentatively to Harry’s cheeks. “I do want to be with you. But I’m scared someone gets to know about us.”
for Harry. The git had never shown any empathy to Harry before, and now Harry couldn’t forget the way Malfoy had cleaned his cut so carefully and worried over his curse wound. But in the end, it all came down to Malfoy’s
“Mum won’t like it. You’re not supposed to keep in touch with your kinds while you’re here,” Dudley said, smirking.
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked, breaking the kiss as he noticed Harry had suddenly gotten tense and unresponsive.
Malfoy didn’t move an inch, and he was still breathing warmly against Harry’s ear. “Maybe he’s been messing with stuff that’s too big for him, if you get what I mean,” Malfoy said and started to back away, sneering.
They went to the kitchens, and Dobby, as always, was beaming as he got to be of help to ‘Dobby’s friend, great Harry Potter’. Harry’s face turned red as he thanked Dobby and other house-elves who had gathered to stare at them with adoring and marvelling glances.
They entered an empty and almost completely dark classroom, where the only source of light was the half-moon that shone dimly through the windows. When they were completely inside the room, and the door was closed behind them, Harry took off his Cloak. He looked utterly wrecked; he had dark circles under his eyes, he was shaking a bit, and he was so pale and ill-looking Draco was sure he hadn’t been eating or sleeping properly in days.
“You’ve got to tell me what’s going on! We could go to Dumbledore together and tell him. He could help,” Harry tried, taking Draco’s face between his hands.
“That’s different, I like to get used to you. Would actually love to get even more used to you,” Harry said, starting to kiss Draco again.
“We actually thought we could raise a toast to him,” Blaise said cautiously. “We don’t have to if you think that’s not a good idea,” he hastened to continue.
He knew he couldn’t tell anyone about the Pensieve, not even Draco. Before sinking into Snape’s Pensieve, it had felt like a good, or even a justified idea to get a glimpse of Snape’s mind, but he hadn’t been prepared for getting to know what he had learned by watching the memories. If he could, he would like nothing more than just to forget about everything that had happened that evening.
They walked in silence, watching the cars passing by and the Muggles rushing back and forward as they did their last Christmas shopping. Being in London felt always so strange after being months at Hogwarts. They were basically like night and day; London full of noise and people who seemed to be always in a hurry while Hogwarts was literally in the middle of nowhere, having only the small Hogsmeade village nearby.
“Er, yeah, just fine. A little tired, you know, Umbridge and all. I think I’d better go to bed,” Harry managed to say awkwardly before heading to the staircase.
“No, Dobby was really happy he had been able to help us. Started to bawl and gave me an armful of snacks, as usual,” Harry said, feeling relieved he didn’t have to lie as he actually had gone to the kitchens after seeing Malfoy. “I just couldn’t sleep last night.”
“Darling, you do realize you ask a lot of questions to which you already should know the answer?” Draco asked, amused. “Yes, these are from the kitchens. Dobby helped me.”
“I thought you only knew who was behind everything, that you were some kind of a messenger or something,” Harry said, talking over Draco. “You’ve almost
“C’mon, you can come back to your room as soon as you want to if you don’t like being there,” Granger said encouragingly.
“Dangerous, my arse,” Draco huffed, giving Harry a small smile. “So, are we going to meet this evening or what?”
“Oh,” Potter said, looking slightly surprised, as if he hadn’t really believed Draco would eventually agree. “Er, great, so. We should hurry up. I’ve got no idea where the Aurors are supposed to be patrolling right now, but we could try to go the way I came here. At least it was deserted,” he babbled, snatched his Cloak, and started to walk towards the door, ready to go.
After a moment, Draco flinched slightly and took a sharp breath in. He started fluttering his eyelashes, and as he opened his still sleepy-looking eyes and saw Harry in front of him, a smile spread wearily across his face.
“Well, she’s an extraordinarily clever witch,” Andromeda said. “If you talked with Draco, it wouldn’t mean you’d have to forgive him, but it would probably clear the air as you are not going to get rid of each other any time soon. He’s going to stay with me as long as he needs to, and you are both going back to Hogwarts in a couple of weeks.”
Harry regretted immediately he said anything. “The Sorting Hat wanted to put me into Slytherin at first. We had a small… argument about where to put me.”
I noticed my last chapter raised confusion for a couple of reasons, and I wanted to clarify them a bit here right in the beginning. First of all, Snape told only Draco's parents about Harry and Draco, not Voldemort. It's good this came up, might have to edit the chapter so that it's clearer who got to know and who didn't.
“No,” Harry said and closed his eyes for a moment, taking a long breath in. “But, er, there might be someone else I’m seeing. A bloke,” he said, feeling himself blushing. God, he could’ve imagined telling about seeing someone, seeing a bloke, would’ve become easier by now, but apparently it had not.
“Thanks, Ginny. This is really beautiful,” Harry said amazed as he started wrapping the other phone.
“Yes, we’ve already heard all about Malfoy looking pale, Malfoy skiving classes, Malfoy not being interested in Quidditch this year, and Malfoy’s dot disappearing from your Map,” Hermione hissed, talking over Harry. “Though Malfoy not eating was something new, must add that to list.”
“That should be quite obvious, shouldn’t it?” Blaise said as Ginny sat down next to him. “It’s a picnic, Potter. Ever heard of it?”
As for accepting Harry and Draco’s relationship, there had happened no change on that front. Snape took advantage of his and Harry’s time together by continuously insinuating how Harry and Draco were simply a bad match, how Harry was putting Draco in a seriously dangerous situation and how Harry wasn’t even nearly worth Draco. Harry tried not to let Snape’s words affect his own thoughts about Draco and their relationship, but his Occlumency learning was suffering a lot, instead, as there was no chance Harry could empty his mind or make himself calm down while Snape was present in the same room. If nothing else, at least it had been quite easy to push the thoughts about the snake attack aside. Actually, the whole point of the Occlumency lessons had somewhat faded away as the fury towards Snape occupied too much space in Harry’s head.
when they met. Should Harry take Exploding Snap or Wizarding Chess with him? Or maybe some homework? He knew he’d feel somehow naked if he didn’t have anything with him for some kind of backup plan.
Ginny snickered. “C’mon, let’s go and see that Hermione and my dear brother haven’t killed each other.”
. How was Harry supposed to tell which one of these Malfoys was the real one? Malfoy’s eyes glowed with uncertainty, but other than that there weren’t any other indications that he wouldn’t stand behind his words.
“If you know what’s best for you, you leave me the fuck alone right now,” Harry said through his teeth, watching Malfoy straight into the eyes. And once again, Malfoy’s face changed, and Harry could see the new unguarded expression on it. It made the git seem all too exposed, all too human, which made Harry hesitate. Neither of them was breathing now, and Harry lowered slowly his wand. He studied Malfoy’s eyes for one more second before turning around and continuing walking.
“Yes, though it’s not easy. Thoughts are usually quite unconscious, and they sound more like facts in your head, so it’s difficult to grab them. But with therapy, a bunch of supportive people with who you can talk about your feelings and experiences, and distance to the people who create and maintain your toxic thought patterns, it is possible,” Hermione said. “But you must realize this doesn’t happen in the blink of an eye, this takes years even with enough help and support.”
“Mate, what took you so long? I’ve been waiting for ages,” Ron said, rushing excitedly to his friend and throwing his arm around Harry’s shoulder. “You never guess what, I actually did it! Here you can see Gryffindor’s new Keeper!” Ron continued, grinning widely.
Both Harry and Draco had had quite a long break from playing the Quidditch, but to Harry, it felt almost as if the last time he had played towards the Slytherin had been rather weeks than years ago. Draco played still well as he flew smoothly all around the pitch and made controlling his broom look like child’s play. But the most striking thing was probably the effort Draco was ready to put in the game. He was making some risky moves, his face was wrinkled in concentration, and his eyes were flaming with eagerness. He had definitely taken seriously his promise to beat Harry this time.
Harry pulled out the Marauder’s Map and started to run his finger over it, trying to find Draco. He was nowhere to be found, which could only mean Draco wasn’t at Hogwarts at all or he would be in the Room of Requirement. The latter option seemed much more plausible, so Harry took his Invisibility Cloak and Map and headed towards the seventh floor.
Draco sighed heavily. He had relaxed a bit, but he looked still somewhat gloomy. “It’s not like I could really judge you.”
“Already doing homework?” Harry asked, making Draco jump a little. “You know, it’s only the first week you nerd.”
, Draco, I’ve been waiting for ages. I’ve got to tell you –” Harry began but stopped abruptly as he noticed how the other boy looked. Draco was trembling slightly, he was white as a sheet, and his eyes looked somehow… empty. “What’s going on? Did something happen at McGonagall’s detention?” Harry asked, touching Draco’s arm lightly, making him startle.
When Harry took his first steps through the thick snow blanket, he started to question his and Draco’s decision to meet outside. It had seemed like a brilliant idea as it was almost zero risks to get caught, and they both felt like they were in desperate need to meet somewhere else for a change. Harry did like snow and winter, but as he was feeling somewhat anxious, he couldn’t make himself pay any attention to his surroundings. Or at least not in a positive way.
They stared at each other, both breathing heavily and anxiety showing in their faces. When Draco’s body started trembling, Harry reached out to him, wrapping his arms tightly around the other boy.
Harry burst out a laugh. “Just keep telling the story about your medieval boarding school, and you’ll do just fine,” he said. “And don’t hex anyone.”
That night, back in his dormitory, Harry found it hard to fall asleep. Having talked with Draco made him feel so much lighter, as though he had been unconsciously carrying a heavy burden that had now been taken away from him. He smiled softly, his body tingling pleasantly all over. It felt so good to be back with Draco and understand Draco had never really betrayed him nor stopped loving him.
“And if I’ve understood correctly, the eight-years get to visit home during the weekends. I’d love you to visit me and Teddy as often as you want,” Andromeda went on.
“You know who tried to smuggle it into the castle? Who did they try to kill?” Harry asked persistently, but the expression on Draco’s face didn’t waver even a little. It all started to feel like Harry was speaking to a deaf.
Harry looked at Ginny, feeling utterly bewildered. “Why on earth would someone want to tell about their feelings in another language?”
“That’s alright, I don’t want anything bad for you,” Narcissa said calmly. “How are you doing, darling?” she asked, turning her eyes to Draco.
Harry didn’t dare to move or breathe when Draco finally touched him for the first time that day, wrapping his arms around Harry and putting their foreheads together.
“’Course. Actually, I’m not hungry anymore. I think I’ll go flying already,” Harry said, trying to sound as calm as possible as he stood up. His stomach had just turned upside down, and he was feeling so furious he couldn’t just stay and sit there.
As October continued, staying at Hogwarts had gradually started to feel much harder. It might have been partly because Harry envied Draco’s regular weekend getaways more than he had initially thought, but most of all probably because the whole castle felt like a bloody cemetery as it still reminded him too much of the War and all the people who had died there, and frankly, it was just so tiring.
“What’s this?” Harry asked in a hoarse voice, even though he was well aware of what it was. He let go of Draco’s hand, and Draco took a hold of his Mark as if it burned.
“It didn’t work out at first, it was quite a mess,” Harry said, shrugging. “But we managed to sort things out a bit and started seeing each other.”
“I’m sure,” Harry said, trying to look Molly in the eye to reassure her even though he felt a bit awkward. “I’m going to sleep at Andromeda’s tomorrow while Draco’s there after all. It’s not a big deal, really, we’re friends.”
“Then you must know what most of the pureblood families think about sexual preferences that don’t lead to producing offspring. I’m not talking about your family, nor even mine, but families like Draco’s… Let’s just say I want to be there for him,” Blaise said sincerely.
The look on Draco’s face turned from annoyed to pained in a matter of seconds. “Please, Harry, don’t let this come between us,” he said, trying to take Harry’s hand, but Harry jerked it away.
Once Harry had swallowed, Malfoy took a grip on Harry’s chin, crushed his lips against Harry’s and slipped his tongue immediately between Harry’s lips.
“’Mione!” Harry cried, bolted upright, and hurried to meet her. “You went to the Ministry today, didn’t you? How did it go?”
“Are you sure?” Molly asked, looking at Harry as if studying him. “If it feels uncomfortable to you at all, I won’t ask them.”
“The truth,” Ginny said simply. “Just tell him honestly why you kissed him and why you pushed him away.”
“Did Umbridge really ban you from playing Quidditch?” Draco asked, looking nervous. He did know how important flying and playing was to Harry.
“It didn’t have anything to do with dignity. You know why he didn’t want to be there,” Draco said gloomily.
“We won’t be seen if we use this door, right?” Potter double-checked, and the Auror nodded sharply. “Great.
Hermione patted Harry’s thigh empathetically. “You don’t have to remember all this instantly, you can always ask me if you feel like it. And I’d bet you’ll become more familiar with all this theoretical stuff through your own therapy. One of the main purposes of the therapy is trying to get rid of one’s toxic thoughts, after all.”
“Partly, yes,” Draco said, shrugging. “My father had already started speaking Norwegian to me, though.”
“Oh, I haven’t heard this story!” Zabini exclaimed excitedly. “Didn’t know you’re such a passionate lover, Draco.”
“Only a few more steps. Just don’t think about what you’re doing,” Harry said, wrapping his arms tightly around Draco’s waist and starting to walk a little faster.
“Shit,” Harry muttered, irritated. “Go away,” he hissed to Dudley who didn’t move an inch. He had apparently decided to stay and pester Harry until he got some kind of an answer.
“Of course, you did,” Ron muttered a bit bitterly. “But Harry, what about Cho? And all the girls we’ve been talking about in our dormito –
“Of course. Don’t take me too seriously, I’m only joking. It’s much better to be here now that the house is full of people,” Sirius said with a warm tone in his voice. “Let’s talk more later, okay?”
“Yes,” Draco said in a painful voice before both he and Harry fell into silence for a moment. “You know, I’ve thought a lot about why I was always so mean to the Weasleys, and, um, I think I might have envied them a bit. Probably still envy, to be honest. I could always get everything I wanted, or, well, at least materialistically, but I still felt like I was never enough. Like no matter what I did, I was always a disappointment, whereas whatever the Weasleys’ kids did or however badly they screwed up, their parents still seemed to love them.”
“The friend of yours must be a house-elf, there’s no way someone else at Hogwarts could fix you something like this,” Draco said, considering the insides of the basket.
“I do. Although I can’t say I really understand why, I just do,” Draco said, looking into the distance.
“I used to babysit you sometimes when you were only a few months old. Me and Narcissa managed to have a couple of playdates for you and Draco, though you didn’t really know how to play yet. You rather just pulled each other’s hair, wrestled a little and giggled until you both were breathless.”
“Er, yeah. Wondering about going back to school,” Harry said. Well, that wasn’t an outright lie exactly.

“It doesn’t matter. What matters now is that you’re getting yourself expelled if you keep making reckless decisions like this, you know you can’t afford that.”
Sirius just laughed. “That’s alright, I’m already used to being locked inside here. From Azkaban to being imprisoned in my lovely family home, someone could call it the irony of faith,” Sirius said, trying to sound like he was only joking but Harry could still hear the slightly bitter tone in his voice. “No, I mean honestly, just go and enjoy on my behalf, too. It’s good to get some fresh air.”
“You don’t know what you’re talking about, you have no idea what I’ve done,” Draco said, tears starting to stream slowly down his face. “I let those Death Eaters into the castle. I had been working on making them a passageway for the whole year. Behind your back.”
Harry watched dazed Malfoy’s back as he walked away. This was the second time Harry had seen the Slytherin behaving out of character, which made Harry sure he hadn’t just imagined the first time. What made the git react like that always when Harry touched him abruptly? How was it even possible that Malfoy was able to show some bare and humanlike emotions?
“Dunno really,” Harry said and grimaced. “I mean, it’s obviously nice to see people and, erm, my boyfriend,” he said blushing. “And DA has been a lot of fun, but –”
“That’s exactly what I've been trying to tell you. I want all of you, every day and every hour of the day, not just when you’re feeling happy and stronger.”
“Sounds like the Death Eaters trust Malfoy more than the Order trusts us. He’s being such a good little Death Eater already,” Ron said, gloomily.
“I know that, or, I mean, I know it wouldn’t be easy. To be honest, nothing is ever easy with you, I don’t think I even want easy. But I don’t want to let go of you. I won’t,” Harry said stubbornly.
“It’s okay,” Hermione said, putting her hand reassuringly on Harry’s arm as she apparently noticed Harry’s discomfort. “Do you want to tell me who you’re talking about?”
“He definitely knows how to make people like him,” Harry muttered, gritting his teeth. “So, how’s it going? Er, Hermione told you’re seeing Michael Corner.”
Harry took a deep breath. He had prepared for this and gone through the conversation countless times in his head. Still, it always seemed to feel so much worse in reality.
“My family has always been quite modern and open-minded in the pureblood scale. And Draco is one of my best friends, of course, I’m going to stand by him,” Zabini said. “Potter, please, just talk to him. He’s miserable at the moment, and I only want him to be happy.”
“What happens next?” Harry asked, feeling horrified. The list of the Death Eaters had become terrifyingly short, actually almost non-existent, and soon there wouldn’t be left anyone else but Malfoy –
“Harry, look at me,” Sirius said as he placed his hands on Harry’s shoulders. “You’re not an evil person, nor will you ever become one. Some trivial similarities between you and Voldemort don’t tell who you are nor define your future. It’s our actions and choices that make us who we are. And the people who we gather around us. You see all your friends, all the people you have in your life? They’re all good people, and so are you,” Sirius stated firmly.
“Besides, this is our last year here. We could at least try to make the most out of it,” Parvati said.
The chance to tell Ron appeared quite naturally the next day. After another disastrous class of Defense, which had, surprise, surprise, ended up with more detentions to look forward to for Harry, Hermione had suggested they started studying Defense by themselves. Harry, Ron and Hermione were sitting in the otherwise empty common room in the middle of the night, and Harry had grudgingly promised to think about Hermione’s idea of him teaching the Defense to other students.

“Well, not exactly –” Draco began but stopped as the tip of Harry’s wand was suddenly on his throat.
Draco blinked his eyes, confused. “Why on Earth would the Weasleys want to invite me to their home?”
As soon as Harry came to the sixth-year boys’ dormitory, he slumped on his four-poster bed and shut the curtains tightly. He was so angry he felt his heart pounding wildly in his chest and he could see nothing but stars. The tears were prickling Harry’s eyes, but he closed them tightly. He wouldn’t shed a tear for Draco sodding Malfoy, he wouldn’t. How could he have been so stupid and trusted Draco? He had never let anyone come as close as Draco and now he had betrayed him. He should’ve seen this coming, there was no way Draco Malfoy could actually have felt something for him.
Draco felt flabbergasted. He had always acted horribly towards her, so it did not make any sense she was suddenly trying to, what, befriend him? No matter how much Draco pondered Granger’s intentions, he couldn’t make anything out of them. That’s why he felt reserved and acted mainly coldly and distantly towards the girl, only grunting for an answer or just point-blank ignoring her. But still, even despite Draco’s abysmal manners, she kept coming back.
“Well, he would’ve been a statistical rarity if he had been able to do that,” Hermione said. “I think it was good he had you, Blaise and Ginny, I’m sure you three were of a lot of help to him. But to have been able to free himself from his parents’ control, Malfoy would’ve needed much, much more help and support. A mind healer, a supportive adult outside of the group who could’ve taken care of him, and more connections outside of the pureblood circles.”
In Harry’s case, the worry for Draco was as present as ever, but in addition to that Dumbledore’s lessons had started to weigh Harry every time a little more. The more he learned about Voldemort, or rather Tom Riddle, the more responsibility he started to feel. Suddenly it had started to clear up to him how it really had to be him who was supposed to destroy Voldemort in the end and what all that practically meant. Being able to talk about Dumbledore’s lessons with Ron and Hermione helped a bit, but it didn’t remove the feeling of the whole Wizarding World having huge expectations of him. He felt still like a normal schoolboy, who wasn’t even particularly good at any subject. Well, maybe at Defence, but that was it.
“Not at all,” Ginny said and bolted upright so fast Harry didn’t have time to blink his eyes. She linked arms with Harry and started to drag him towards the portrait hole.
“Oh, you’re really that obtuse. I’m having a prefect round, and now I’m seeing that you are going kindly straight to your beloved Gryffindor.”
“A very good morning indeed,” Harry whispered, lifting Draco’s head to kiss him on the mouth. “You know, I’m running late, haven’t eaten breakfast yet.”
As the day to go back to Hogwarts drew nearer, Draco found himself getting increasingly nervous day by day. It was easy to get distracted during the daytime as he kept himself busy by taking care of Teddy and helping Andromeda at home, but when Andromeda and Teddy had gone to sleep, Draco was left alone with his thoughts.
Draco didn’t seem to have any objection to that, so instead, he decided to turn around, take Harry’s face between his hands and kiss him deeply.
with them. Then there was Pansy Parkinson, who was staring at them openly from the other end of the Slytherin table with the if-looks-could-kill look on her face as she talked vehemently with Millicent Bulstrode and Theodore Nott, who weren’t looking at them very friendly either. And then there was Snape, who was probably the worst of all. The look on his face was an interesting mix of disbelief, disgust and hate, and Harry couldn’t decide which one of those feelings showed the most as he saw how Snape squinted his dark, flaming eyes and scowled at them, mouth set in a grim line.
Malfoy looked at Zabini, confused, but he relaxed a little. “Whatever for the Boy Who Lived,” Malfoy muttered, turning his gaze from Zabini to Harry.
“Dean and Seamus had decided to smuggle some alcohol into school,” Hermione said, apparently trying to sound disapproving but her red cheeks gave away that she, too, was already quite happily tipsy.
“I’m going to get some more, got to get rid of the taste of tequila in my mouth. See you in a bit,” Harry said and started to make his way through the crowd towards the drinking table.
Draco relaxed as he heard he’d get to keep his anonymity. “I suppose that’s a good idea,” Draco said to Harry’s surprise. “It’s helped me a lot to be able to talk with Blaise about us, it’d be good if you had someone to talk to as well.”
to our side. It was really dangerous and irresponsible. What if something had happened? And no one but Dumbledore knew what he and Madam Maxime were doing and where,” Hermione continued, huffing.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Fine,” Draco said as Harry put the Cloak over both of them. “Can’t believe you, Potter, you’re unbelievable.”
Draco looked at both his mother and father in turns, horrified. “You can’t be serious,” he said, not knowing if he should laugh or cry. The situation felt so unrealistic, it was completely mental.
Harry watched Ginny leave, her long hair waving wildly as she walked away. Harry felt lighter than for a long time.
“Malfoy?” Harry asked, already knowing the answer. This bit of information made his already grumpy mood to sink even more. He had had difficulties to accept that he hadn’t been chosen as a Gryffindor prefect while both of his best friends had, and now with Malfoy being a prefect, it all felt like a hundred times worse.
When they arrived at the Room of Requirement, Harry was happy to notice they were the first ones there. He had hoped Ginny would’ve some time to regard the Room and make herself as comfortable as possible.
“No need to bow, Kreacher,” Potter said, his face turning red. Draco had noticed quite recently that Potter was surprisingly bad at being worshipped and admired by the others, even though Draco had used to believe the complete opposite and bullied him many times about it at school. “Kreacher, this is Draco Malfoy. Malfoy, this is Kreacher.”
“Well, Harry has told me a bit about your… experiences,” Granger began, making Draco inhale sharply. “Nothing too personal or private or anything, just that you were together during the fifth and sixth year and so,” she hastened to continue as she noticed Draco’s reaction.
“Sorry, didn’t mean to push you or anything,” Harry said. “I’m happy with where we’re now,” Harry said as he brushed lightly Draco’s cheek.
“Yeah, right, you’ve just randomly happened to kiss me, what, three or four times now?” Harry said furiously. “Look, I don’t want any harm to you. I just want an honest answer.”
Finally, Harry felt somewhat content with himself. He had come up with a plan to ask if Dobby could fix them something to eat in picnic-style, in addition to which he decided to bring some Muggle comics and books. It wasn’t his job to educate Draco on Muggle Studies, but he enjoyed secretly all too much Draco’s confusion over Muggle things and words. The little joys in life.
The Room looked surprisingly nice, even though it was pretty far from how Harry had pictured it. It reminded Harry of a luxurious master bedroom in an old mansion he had seen in movies, though there was a clear touch of roughness as wells. On the left side, there was a big hearth and in front of it, there were a couple of soft-looking, indigo blue armchairs and a couch. At the back of the Room there was a large window with light grey curtains that filtered the daylight making it look somehow dreamy-like. In front of the window, there was a table with a couple of chairs that looked like they were stolen from the library as they looked exactly the same as there.
Hermione’s rationality didn’t really help that much. Actually, Harry saw Ron getting only more annoyed at that, and he had started muttering curses in a low voice.
“I don’t know. It’s not like I would’ve gone a lot around asking people what they think about same-sex couples,” Harry muttered, shrugging.
“We weren’t there when Snape killed Dumbledore,” Hermione insisted. “It’s a crucial bit of information, and you’re the only one who can tell about it.”
Draco looked a little uneasy but shook his head again anyhow. “No. He’s never broken his promises to me. I trust him,” Draco said. “What did he say to you after I left?”
Sirius took a deep breath and looked Harry firmly in the eye. “Voldemort doesn’t have control over you. Yes, there’s a connection between you. The dream you had is proof of it, but it doesn’t mean he can control you. You haven’t done anything wrong. It’s quite the opposite, really, you saved Arthur’s life.”
"Now, that's better. You have to go out and get some air. Just take your time to pull yourself together. I'll see that no one comes to disturb you,” Blaise continued whispering and squeezing Draco's shoulder one more time before letting go.
“How much have you drunk exactly?” Ron asked and hiccupped. Harry could hear he was trying to sound like he hadn’t drunk anything other than water that night, but he was swaying quite a lot on his feet it was clear he wasn’t that sober either.
“Erm, yes, I’m well aware,” Harry said awkwardly. “Though I’d appreciate it if you could keep this as a secret.”
The others continued discussing Granger's transformation without Draco hearing a word. Draco's head felt like a big mess of conflicting feelings and thoughts that just came and went before he could take a grip on any of them. At first, Draco could nothing but admire how exceptionally handsome Potter looked in his bottle green dress robes that brought out the colour of his emerald green eyes quite stunningly. Before Draco could contemplate that thought deeper, he felt jealousy rising, making him clench his fists slightly. As if there was any need to feel jealous. It was rather quite the opposite, the Patil girl didn't seem that content with being Potter's pair as they started to lurch around the dancefloor, Patil having to do all the work. Still, at that moment Draco wanted nothing more than to be the one to stagger on the dancefloor with Potter, holding him tight against Draco's own body and feeling the warmth and electricity of their connected bodies as he would be sinking into Potter's green, beautiful eyes.
“Don’t you dare to touch me like that anymore,” Malfoy snarled and strode hastily back to his Slytherin friends.
But Hermione noticed immediately there was something Harry wasn’t telling her. “What? Did something happen there?” she asked, lifting her eyebrow.
“But it kind of does, don’t you see?” Draco asked, laughing hollowly. “I don’t think you can save me from this. You can’t save everyone.”
Before Harry had realized, the days had gotten remarkably shorter and colder in Scotland, and the Christmas holidays seemed to be knocking just around the corner. December had come ever so slyly, but Harry was none the wiser about what there might be going on in Draco’s life. At least not until Slug Club’s Christmas party.
“Yes. Pardon me, I’ve never introduced myself properly. Blaise Zabini,” Zabini said, offering his hand.
“And here I was hoping to have one normal school year with less Malfoy lurking behind the corners. But no, it just has to get worse every year,” Harry whined, remembering the Slytherin’s ways to get under Harry’s skin in the past. Harry had already a lot in his mind, so he didn’t really need Malfoy to occupy any more of his time and energy than usually.
And, what was more, one of the few things Draco could feel quite sure about was that Harry loved him back. Draco could sense it with every fibre of his being. In Harry’s touches when Harry kissed him first thing in the morning and the last thing before falling asleep, when he held Draco’s hand in public, looking so happy and
“But what if I’m evil somehow?” Harry blurted out before he could stop himself. “Or will become evil? Voldemort told me some years ago there are many similarities between him and me, and we have almost identical backgrounds. And no one knows how to explain the connection between us, and it’s definitely not a normal one.”
Harry started to run towards the castle, yelling at Draco to wait, but he didn’t even slow his pacing.
“Absolutely not. I wonder where Malfoy’s going now? And how didn’t I notice anything at school?” Hermione said, huffing frustrated.
Harry exhaled heavily and laid down on the ground. As soon as Umbridge and McGonagall had let him and George go, Harry had rushed out without saying a word to anyone. He didn’t mind even the cold evening air. Actually, it was quite the opposite, the cool wind and blinking stars made him relax a bit.
Draco sighed. “Me neither. But if we just tried to endure this for a while, it has to get better soon.”
¡SPOILER ALERT! Long story short, one of the main characters is a Jehovah’s Witness, and when he comes out to his parents, they organize this kind of funeral for their son to shut him out of the family & community and to make him “dead” to them.
“Couldn’t wait until the weekend to see you,” Draco said in between the kisses as he slipped his hands under Harry’s shirt.
“What do you mean ‘we don’t have much time’?” Draco asked, confused. “Are you trying to say the Aurors don’t know you’re here?”
“Yes, yes, I know. What I mean is that learning to know both Blaise and Draco better has shown me how we only really see the tip of an iceberg of someone’s life and thoughts while there’s so much more under the surface we’ve got absolutely no idea of,” Hermione said.
Draco was sitting on the balcony at the Manor, looking at the sunrise early in the morning. Even though he liked summer sunrises a lot, he hardly ever saw them as he usually never fancied the idea of waking up so early to be able to see them. But this time, he had been already awake as he hadn’t even slept at all during the night.
“No, Harry, that’s a bad idea. Do you have any idea how Cho will react if she sees us together in Hogsmeade?” Ginny asked, cutting Harry short. “I assume that you didn’t tell her the whole reason for why you didn’t want to date her?”
“You’re not a prisoner, Draco. They’re having you only until they get all the paperwork done,” Narcissa said soothingly, but with a tired tone in her voice. The wartime had treated her hard; she had lost a lot of weight, her usually healthy, rather thick hair had thinned, and she seemed to have permanent dark circles under her eyes.
Despite the unpleasant meeting with Scrimgeour, Harry’s mood remained otherwise quite good throughout the holidays. The main reason for that was probably Draco, who sent him at least a couple of messages every single day. Harry had made Draco promise him he would keep in touch in order to avoid last summer’s rather catastrophic ending, and Draco had clearly thought along the same lines. Hearing from Draco every day made Harry believe that at least nothing bad had happened and that Draco and his mother must be safe, even at the Death-Eater-filled Manor.
“You found what?” Draco asked as they walked slowly to the same direction Potter had just come from.
“Shit!” Harry cried out. He had been so lost in his thoughts he had managed to cut his finger while chopping the ingredients.
“Neither did I,” Harry said, feeling a bit envious as he hadn’t gotten to see Teddy at all after summer.
“What do you want me to do? I can’t just suddenly start acting nice to you,” Malfoy exclaimed, looking desperate.
Draco’s eyes widened in amaze. “I fucking knew it! Merlin, this explains so much. How could I be so innocent and even consider you’d be sneaking around like a normal citizen.”
“As I already told Potter, the recent, let’s say, developments, should’ve finally shown you how you’re not meant to be with each other. I expect that at least you, Draco, have learned something and know better how to act from now on,” Snape said, glaring at both of them in turns. “So, what did the headmistress want?”
Once Blaise had left, the nights were only for Harry and Draco. The Room filled with gasps and moans and pleas as the two boys studied each other’s bodies and different ways to give pleasure to one another. Harry felt always dizzy afterwards, cuddled up with Draco, both whispering words such as
“You’re right, Harry. Death Eaters are something too horrible. Malfoy’s annoying and a huge git, but he could never kill or torture people the way Death Eaters do,” Hermione said.
“I couldn’t let you miss this. Dobby was extremely proud of his treacle tart, you know,” Draco said as he kept on feeding Harry.
When Ron had come to Harry’s other side, Harry started telling them in a low voice. “Malfoy knows something about Hagrid. He was hinting that something may have happened to him.”
