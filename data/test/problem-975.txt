This is really short and chaotic, because I'm bad at writing conversations, but enjoy I guess.
Just as the silence was becoming uncomfortable Harry had enough. He stepped down the few steps and embraced Draco as an old friend would. He could feel Draco stiffen under his grasp, but soon felt him relax and return the embrace.
The boys didn't think of each other as enemy's anymore. There was some sort of unspoken agreement between them that stated that they may not be best friends, but you could call the thing between them some sort of friendship.
Once they reached their destination Harry turned slowly to Malfoy. He then spoke with a trembling, but deliberate voice. " This used to be Siriuses room and I would appreciate it if for the time being didn't come up here." Draco looked up at the face of his host. It was the most down-trodden look he had ever seen. He understood why Harry would like to keep him away from this place. Draco knew how many memories could be here and he didn't want to even start thinking how he would react if his godfather had died before his own eyes. Suddenly the most unexpected thing happened...
"But the thing is... I do regret it. I regretted it as soon as it happened."
"Okay?"
"I asked if we could talk" explained a slightly annoyed Harry
Draco stared as Harry stepped down towards him. He was startled when Potter embraced him as if he was just an old school mate and not his sworn enemy. After a few moments of hesitation he relaxed and returned the embrace.
Moments later a gently startled Harry opened the old door and stepped inside the dimly lit room. The former death eater was mildly surprised Harry had actually listened to his half-hearted sentence. Realising that Harry had asked a question Draco spluttered a quick "what" and then promptly proceded to not listen again and by doing so, forcing himself to ask once more what the auror had said.
I'm sorry the chapters are so short. I'll be working to improve them at some point.
Harry threw on a dressing gown and trudged down the stairs as quickly as his sleep drunk self allowed, without tumbling down the stairs and landing in an ungracful heep as he had done just a few days ago. Once he reached the door he looked through the grimy peep hole to see who it is. And he couldn't believe who he was seeing....Draco Malfoy. He swung open the door ignoring the fact that it's cold and he has almost nothing on. He was just so surprised to see Malfoy that the bits of common sense he still had suddenly decided to take a vacation.
This is just the letter mentioned in the previous chapter
"It's okay. I forgave you for that ages ago. I guess that's what happens when we save each other’s lives... We forgive faster."
Harry was a bit taken aback by the letter. He didn't object to the details describing Draco's stay nor did he discuss them with Draco himself. The letter itself contained details informing of the way this agreement was supposed to work. The letter went something like this:
*time skip – a couple hours*
"Dear Mr Potter,
A few minutes passed and Draco knocked a few more times. A minute passed. He was just reaching out to knock once more when the door opened with a flourish. There in just his underwear and a quickly thrown on dressing gown stood Harry Potter. Draco's breath caught in his lungs as he stared at Harry. He just couldn't stop looking in awe at how muscled Potter had become over the years.
He wants to curl up and hide. “I knew… It isn’t something I want to think about. They said it’d be safer, this year. I’m just playing along to stay alive, really. Cedric’s the real Hogwarts champion—”
“Blaise, you can stop acting like an upstanding member of society now,” Parkinson calls over. She lifts her wand and levitates the crates in their hands to the table Zabini had pointed to, unshrinking them as they go. Harry is distracted by her sharp-looking red nails, and how they match both her lipstick and very short skirt. She otherwise looks to be in keeping with the Slytherins-in-black theme of the night.
Bill: I wouldn’t rule it out just yet Ron
“Draco darling,” Pansy cackles. “Aren’t you going to join in?” Harry notices then that Draco is leaning back slightly, staring at him with no minor trepidation, and ignoring her.
“Cheers, Chang!”
Ronald: then it couldn’t have been black then could it??
“Right,” Draco sighs. “I’m off. Couldn’t bear to think what would happen if I hung around here too long. See you around.”
“…When I went back to investigate more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished,” Dumbledore is saying.
Katie: :(
Harry frowns. “I don’t know…”
“Both absolutely in it over Krum! Priceless!”
You: It’s fine
“Yeah,” Nott scoffs. “Was pretty scary, I guess. Is that Longbottom?”
think of that would be helpful against a dragon, Weasel?”
“A wizard never starts a fight when another’s back is turned!” Moody growls. He flicks his wand again and Malfoy goes shooting into the air, floundering wildly. Moody swings him around, forcing him to do somersaults and cartwheels and shoving him down the back of Goyle’s jumper. Goyle yelps and scrabbles at his back, writhing in the most amazing manner. Malfoy manages to free himself, only to be recaptured by Moody’s charm. He’s bounced into the air—up, down, up, down—thudding against the floor each time.
“About to collapse,” he answers with a shaky grin. Even Krum has joined them.
“What kinds do you ’ave ’ere, Charlie?” Hagrid asks. He’s gazing reverently at what Harry assumes is the horntail, one of the ones Charlie was talking about over summer. Its yellow eyes are still open a horrifying slit.
“See you, Malfoy,” says Ron.
“There’s no time like the present, I suppose,” Fred announces, having cleared his plate of syrupy pancakes. He stands and bows deeply to Hermione, who watches him skeptically. “Would you care to accompany me, Most Wonderful Hermione Jean of the prestigious Grangers?”
“Hermione?” he mumbles, stepping closer to the wall of the tent.
“...and I need to think about having the object in my hands when I cast it, or it will struggle to gauge the intent.”
“They’re ready.” Harry says.
Norberta: No
at summoning spells.”
Harry tries his best to take the weird casualness of the conversation in his stride. “Parvati took pity on me. You going with anyone?”
“You’re mean,” Ginny tells the twins a second time when they’re walking down to the stadium. The two of them pause in their calls of “Place your bets!” and, “Who do
“He has it!” Bagman shouts after an age. “He has the egg!”
Dinner is… Well, dinner is almost torturous. He’s lucky Percy peters off when Parvati pointedly starts conversation with Harry over him, because he’s sure he’d be listening to all of the most boring goings on in the Ministry by now. Of course, she’s almost certainly aware that half of what she’s saying is going right over Harry’s head—he really is trying to listen, promise—because he keeps catching snippets of conversation from down the table.
They set off through the castle, out over the lawns and to the lake. The morning of November first is a cold one; mist is rolling down again from the mountains, curling in drifts around the forest, wrapping tree trunks with cotton. The air is frigid and a little on the icy side, but it’s refreshing and comforting and relieves Harry of his newfound claustrophobia.
“Ronald, Harry, Hermione!” Fleur greets, sitting herself opposite, between Ron and Dean. “It is good to see you all.”
“You’re hardly convincing.”
Bagman brings the bag to him, and he takes the only remaining model.
“Accio Firebolt!” Harry shouts, but nothing is forthcoming.
about it.”
Harry soars upwards, just inches from the chasm wall, fumbling his wand back into its leather strappings. A burst of fire tears the air several feet to his left.
Pucey: oh Harry
“Ah yes!” Mr Ollivander intones, eyes gleaming. “How well I remember, how very well. Such a curiosity…”
Draco shakes out the last of the snow and turns around with a dramatic flare of his cloak. “Oh, you’re
but I named these two,” she replies, hoisting them into her arms. “This is Wandle, and this is Marcassin.”
“Nothing, nothing,” Ron says. Fleur giggles.
You: I did yeah
anything but his wand, so he needs to use the wand to bring things to
“Come on,” she says, finally quirking a smile. “Let’s go and find someone. I’ll hijack my sister if needs be.”
Bill: what did he say?
Parvati nods and takes a sip from her goblet. “Made any interesting discoveries recently, then?”
He, Harry and Cedric stroll out of the tent and are met by Fleur and Viktor.
“How’s the party?” Dean shouts. “Enjoying the special treatment?”
“Harry Potter,” says Harry. Fleur disentangles herself from Malfoy to shake each of their hands. He looks satisfyingly put-out.
“That—they’re going to do that?”
Norberta: Do I dare ask what happened with the croissant
know he can’t do them?” Ron asks, spitting biscuit crumbs. “Wait, no I think I know. Carry on.”
You: She floated out the door and ended up on a chimney somewhere
he tells the snakes.
Ludo Bagman, beaming, sends up a ten.
“I told her,” he replies testily. Harry looks at him steadily.
Harry smirks. “I didn’t have you running your mouth like a puppy, this time.”
“What?” he says, slightly taken aback. “What’s wrong with them?”
“I’ll go and get the cloak, shall I?” Harry mutters to Ron.
“Mademoiselle Delacour, might you step forward first?” Mr Ollivander asks.
“All right Hagrid?” pants Charlie Weasley, coming over to talk. “Should be all right; we gave them sleeping draughts before we left. We
You: Harry James Potter
“She told me to shut up and finish transfiguring my raccoon into a textbook,” Fred gripes.
Greckles: I can already hear oliver’s distress
“Thank you for your
Flint: Marcus Flint
Harry pulls on his new clothes, attaching his
“Drat, I need to go! Good luck!”
Quaffle: Oliver Wood
Ginny: holy SHIT
“I want in,” Malfoy adds, appearing suddenly at their side.
“Very well,” Snape growls. “Leave your bag here, Potter, and be back promptly.”
In front of them are four colossal, towering dragons. They roar and shoot spires of flame into the sky, and Harry is transfixed in terror.
Ron laughs. “Absolutely not. But it’s not like George is any better.”
Malfoy glares at him, and for a moment Harry thinks he’s going to refuse. He steps forward, though, and Harry realises that he may have made a mistake.
it would be better to wake them up in the dark, but they aren’t happy… Not happy at all…”
Every face gazes up at the old Headmaster in dead silence. He smiles.
Malfoy twists his mouth so he looks like he’s chewing on something sour. “My disillusionment charms are shaky at best.”
“No need!” George says quickly, slipping backwards into the crowd. “Maybe later!”
Harry was awakened from his restless slumber by a loud knocking. He wondered aloud who on earth could it be at such an unearthly hour. He got up slowly, but when the knocking grew louder decided to just get it over with and see who it is. He didn't know that in a few seconds the lifestyle he had tried to build for himself after the war would crumble to pieces.
"Yeah, I guess that's true"
Malfoy had always thought Potter had rejected his friendship, because of his father and the fact that most of his family was at some point a death eater. What he had never considered was the fact that his family had nothing to do with it. Because of this he never expected what was about to happen or how it would change everything.
"I mean, I really am sorry. For everything. I just wasn't sure how to say it. Or if you'd even listen"
After hours of talking (and some sitting in silence) the wizards realized it was well into the day already and decided it would be best to go out to eat instead of attempting any cooking.
Malfoy looked just as dumb struck as he felt. So for a few moments both the men just stood and stared.
"I don't blame you"
"Oh, sure" "Did you have a specific topic in mind?"
We wish to inform you of our recent decision as it involves you and the house you got after Mr Blacks untimely death. Draco Lucius Malfoy will be coming to live with you for the next two years. During that time he will need to be supervised most of the time to ensure he does not sport any suspicious activity or tries to hurt himself under the influence of memories meeting you might bring flooding back. We will of course check in on your well being on the first day of each month during the two years of Draco Malfoys stay in your household. We are sorry if this is followed by any inconveniences, but it must be done to ensure Malfoy may have any chance on bringing his life, safety and well being into a better state than it is at this moment. He will attempt to do this by becoming your right hand auror and he must learn how to help others and put their well being before his own. You will have to help him during this personality transformation. We believe that under your influence he will have a better chance at destroying all the evil traits Lord Voldemort may have planted into his brain. We once again apologise for any problems Mr Malfoy may cause. We hope you are well.
“OI!” Draco startled awake to see Ron Weasley standing in the doorway. “You’ve nearly slept through breakfast, Mum will lose it if you don’t get down there. Plus, I’ll need to wash the sheets.” He wasn’t being unfriendly, but Draco could tell he was trying to compensate for his discomfort. Draco looked to his left and found Harry’s bed empty, the sun cascading over the comforter. How long had he been asleep?
Unfortunately, Daphne was wrong. When Draco returned from the library late that night after working on some homework, he found his bed unoccupied, but Harry sleeping in his own for the first time in weeks. Draco thought his heart was going to shatter right then and there. He wasn’t sure what he did, but he somehow messed up, and now his means of getting through his horrible nightmares was gone. He fell asleep as best as he could without a comforting presence beside him.
There had been many more dreadful weeks after that, and many more that ended with horrifying things that he didn’t see coming. What he never dealt with, however, is a week that was so fantastic that he dreaded its end, because he knew it would end in misery.
Draco allowed his mind to wander as Granger came up with a brilliantly executed anecdote about why they were there. His hands twitched anxiously against the back of Harry’s chair. Was the break over downstairs? Was his mother back on the witness stand, facing Hale alone? Or had they moved on to his nearly-psychotic father?
Draco learns exactly what will be in store for him this year, and learns what his new flat mates think about him.
After brooding by the lake for the better part of the afternoon, Draco decided to go to the informal Quidditch game happening in the moonlight—but he was bringing his friends with him.Holding his old broom in his right hand, he felt somewhat optimistic about the evening. He was feeling much better physically after visiting Madame Pomfrey, and he was looking forward to playing Quidditch again. The sport had to be cancelled last year due to a lack of students interested in participating. Most of the older Gryffindors quit the team, Draco assumed in some kind of protest move, and the rest were often too injured and tired to be any good. Draco hadn’t actually stepped foot on the pitch for a long time.
Narcissa smiled. “You were right. It’s time for me to get back into the social world, and do what I do best. Mrs. Zabini and I are having lunch later this afternoon.”
. “I’d take it over last year any day.”
Harry laughed. “You’re funny when you’re not being such a prick.”
“That was good! It was clear, and you started it and ended it at the right time.”
“No, we can just go to Hogsmeade, or even Diagon Alley if you want to avoid the other students. I just want to spend time with you, that’s all.”
“Merlin,” he gasps, seeing Harry’s disembodied head. “What the hell is that?”
You: Get told
“This is surprisingly in-depth,” he admits, handing it back. “I didn’t know you could tell who’s who through those smudgy old specs.”
“A celebration is in order!” she yells, and everyone cheers.
“I’m pretty sure she is,” Harry says.
She sighs. “Just as long as it does get done.”
“Brilliant.”
The only topic of conversation for the next week is about the upcoming Tournament and their subsequent visitors. Everywhere Harry goes, rumours fly about supposed champions, the Tournament, and what the other students might be like.
He swerves under the viaduct bridge and keeps low, forcing her to go over the top. The chasm offers him no protection so he heads towards the castle, flying from tower to tower. She lands on their rooves and sends tiles skittering to the rocky ground. She smashes windows with her claws and her tail leaves feet-long gouge marks in the stone. She bellows into the sky and holds onto the chase.
“Are you one of those muggle machines?” Draco asks. “Have you overheated?”
The air crackles with heat and smoke and ozone. Harry can feel it on his skin and in his lungs.
“Ron?” Harry asks. “What’s wrong?”
“Wouldn’t fancy it, no,” Harry agrees.
“Don’t worry Weasel,” Malfoy replies, smirking as he holds Harry’s gaze, “I’m hardly a pushover.”
Harry turns back to Ron and Hermione waiting for him at the door, snatching his bag and the cat sub-crate off his desk as he passes. “I’m so stuffed.”
They trade spells with lightning reactions and audacious flair, bouncing the audience’s attention back and forth like a taped Wimbledon match on fast-forward.
“Over here!” he yells, as if the horntail was going to let him out of her sight. She tugs and strains against her chains.
“Fine.”
You: Sorry :c
“Thank you,” he says, ducking his head. “What did you do, Harry? You have your broom.”
“Yes, you do.”
Harry rises to his feet only to find that they’ve tried to do a runner on him. He picks himself up off the ground, shaking horribly, and steps into the tunnel. The canon goes a fourth time, and he walks towards the pale, watery light.
She gives him a once over—
“Of course I did!” Harry protests. “Hagrid brought Madam Maxime, and Karkaroff is bound to have been sneaking around. You’re the only one who doesn’t know!”
Malfoy scrambles to his feet and hides behind the nearest person, who just so happens to still be Harry. Professor McGonagall gives them an odd look, but quickly returns her ire to Professor Moody.
Harry stands up and steps forward, smiling and nodding slightly to Viktor. Viktor gives him a tiny smile in return, and it’s more encouraging than any of Gryffindor’s cheering has been all week.
Harry chokes. “Oh, fuck no.”
“Mew!” says Rosanna, tumbling into Snuffs. Harry smiles.
they yell, and send off synchronised stunners. The four giants hit the ground and the trees themselves groan. Each one is a small hill. Their handlers rush forward to secure the chains to the pegs they drive into the ground with their wands.
“Oi, why couldn’t we have had that?” Seamus asks. “Do you know how hard it is to sneak out of that basement?”
Soon, once the castle is mostly out of sight, they turn into the forest. Harry sighs, knowing that they’ll have to hang back even farther with the brittle forest litter.
“Enjoying yourself?”
“Well, be surprised. It’s true.” Harry catches up to him and pokes his elbow placatingly. “I wouldn’t say it if it wasn’t. You’re my best friend.”
“Sure. We can figure it out by then.”
Freckles: shit you’re right
Harry joins Hermione’s laughter. The topic lies carefully unbroached between them.
small, Ludo,” she says in a high, honeyed voice. Her eyes haven’t left Harry since he’d entered, her gaze scrutinising and considering and leaving him feeling stripped bare.
“Not tonight,” Malfoy says quickly. “I don’t want to have to bear witness to that.”
The water twists, tornado-like, and grows both towards the floor and the ceiling like roots and branches of a tree. Harry realises, a second late, that a tree is exactly what it is. The branches shatter into an explosion of leafy canopy, throwing rippling shadows onto all four walls.
Shay: Seamus Finnigan
Harry eyes him, but places Malfoy’s textbook on the table.
Freckles: exactly. We’re stupid and expendable. You’re not
Freckles: the fact you’re worrying whether you’re a bad person or not also means a lot
“So are we calling a truce tonight?” Ginny asks expectantly.
at Hogwarts.”
Freckles: we’re not going to let you throw yourself into danger
Sure enough, when they join the rest of the class lining up along the Potions corridor, Harry sees the little badge glinting in the low light. Malfoy, currently looking away from them, has pinned it to his other lapel in an attempt to draw attention away from it. The fact that it’s still there is incredible enough.
Beauxbatons ends their display in front of the head table, bowing deeply with a flourish of silk and fluttering paper flowers. Harry watches one float down in front of him to land on the new tablecloth. They’ve somehow matched the colours to the houses, and he must admit that it’s rather impressive.
A scrap of parchment is making its way around the tables at lunch. In its wake follow gushes of whispering and giggling, and people with tiny coloured stars on their lapels. Some are on cuffs, jumper sleeves, even skin. Harry looks on in confusion until the paper lands in his hands.
“Uh, they say thanks,” Harry says. “Oh, and could you get Malfoy for me please? I need his help.”
Blotches: but the
“Accio European dragon book!” he cries again, flicking his wand with more force. The book, stubbornly, does not move.
“Oh yes, just making sure they’re all functional and won’t cause you any problems. They’re your most important tool, of course!”
“Potter,” sneers a dreadful, drawling voice from a few paces behind them. “What are you doing, skulking about?”
“Why didn’t
“You look great, Hermione,” Lavender says, her surprise both evident and mean.
“Dress robes shall be worn,” she continues, “and the ball will start at eight o’clock, Christmas day, until midnight, in the Great Hall. Now, this may be a good chance to let our hair down, but the standards of behaviour expected of you will not be relaxed! I will be most seriously displeased
You: :D
Harry stares at her. Has his
“There, all done,” Fred says, grinning. George rolls his eyes.
I wanted to sit over ’ere for once!”
“All in working order,” he declares, holding it out for her to take. “Mr Diggory next, if you please.”
Freckles: Those are some big words Gin
She makes to steer Harry out of the room, but Cedric pokes his head in to intercept them.
There’s a groan, a snap, and he swears loudly.
He thinks of Hermione, how clever and sharp she is, how pretty she is when Ginny or Fred or Fleur makes her blush, and exactly the words Uncle Vernon would have for her if she were ever to have the misfortune of meeting him. Horrible ones, ones Harry had heard said so often and so cruelly about utter strangers.
“Yes,” he says quietly, “most impressive. Nine and a half inches, inflexible… Rosewood… Containing… Oh my.”
He frowns. “I thought we were supposed to be being nice now?”
Quaffle: NO WAY
“I’m going to die, Gin, there’s nothing else I can do,” he moans. “The Tournament’s going to kill me.”
in such a way he finds undefinable.
Norberta: Wrre makinf teg tables fighd
Harry protests, hysterical.
“Hold!” someone hollers. In front of Harry are at least a dozen wizards on brooms, all pouring magic into a shimmering shield stretched over the stands. Another dozen hover overhead.
“Ah, thanks,” Harry says, folding the parchment into an envelope. They make it to the owlery and back before Hermione and Fred have even noticed them gone.
Ron nods. “Looking good,” he says, and bats off his sister when she tries to shrink
“Bloody
Snake: Please
“Here. You’re welcome.”
You: It’s like when Dumbledore left my dad’s old cloak except with no note
“Hello, my good friends,” he says, smiling. “I’m very glad you could join us for the third monthly committee meeting of the year.” He takes hold of Ron’s shoulder and leads them into the throng. “I do hope you’ll enjoy yourselves. Refreshments are over there by the tapestry of the banshee, and your additions are greatly appreciated.”
“Ron, the new popular man?” Seamus shouts. “Get the news while it’s hot! And I really do mean smoking!”
Greckles: that wouldn’t really happen would it??
ever made a fuss?” Malfoy says loudly, and half the table bursts out laughing. Harry tries not to choke, and Malfoy hides his small smile behind his goblet.
As soon as they’re settled, and the chatter has died down again, a clash of rhythmic beats starts up. The students of Durmstrang stride into the hall, beating their staffs against the flagstones to their chant, sending up small showers of yellow sparks. After several seconds, they bend to the floor and sprint forwards. Some stoop to crouch while other leap and somersault over them, falling into a roll to clear the path. The front runners twirl their staffs and hold them to their mouths to blow fire over the heads of the seated students. It takes the different forms of magical creatures twisting and winding and thunderous.
“Potter,” Draco smirks. “I take it you weren’t in on this plot.”
Behind them the canvas flap lifts again, and Draco Malfoy steps through.
Hey guys!! Guess what? I didn't think I'd have a chapter up for this week, either, but here I am!! We movin lads ;)
“He must be entering,” Harry says. They begin to shove their way past the crowd, and he clutches the crate close to him.
“Cedric?” Ron snorts.
“Those are some very fine specimens you got there, an’ all.” Hagrid motions to the snakes.
“Want a jam tart, Hermione?” Fred asks, presenting the platter with a hell of a flourish. Harry watches as she looks from Fred to the tarts and back to Fred, utterly unimpressed. Fred, the loon, grins.
He hears her start to spit her fire before he feels it, which may be the only reason he doesn’t cook. The air burns, and Harry remains empty-handed and his heart racing.
The morning of the thirtieth finally arrives, though with fog, and Harry gathers the fast-growing kittens from Hermione as they head down to Sunday breakfast.
Freckles: <3
Harry glares. “Let’s go.”
“Thank you all, it has been a pleasure,” Dumbledore says. “You are now free to go back to your lessons, or really straight down to common rooms or dinner, as they will be ending momentarily.”
Something catches the tail of his broom and he goes spinning. He yells out, separated from his broom and falling, falling…
With a large swallow Ron turns out the insides of his cuffs. He picks up his wand and slices off the lace, which makes him look a fair sight better already, but there wasn’t really much to go on in the first place. Charlie rattles in her cage on Ron’s nightstand, climbing the bars and performing impressive acrobatics for a nonexistent audience.
“Oh?”
Pucey: dude??!?!!
“Yeah, so’s his date!” Ginny yells back.
Crookshanks: thank you
It’s a broom cupboard. Harry stares at her.
Greckles: charming
it reads.
“We’re not most people, are we?”
you can only have your wand?” she asks for maybe the fifth time.
Through the crowd, Harry catches George’s eye. He waves, looking very softly pleased with himself, walking next to none other than Cassius Warrington. How he’d managed that, Harry would have to ask, though he notices they’re definitely not arm in arm. He can’t imagine Warrington giving in easily, even if he hadn’t been entirely disinterested before. Harry wonders what his family’s stance on a Weasley would be.
Snake: I hope not
And yes, all typos/bad grammar/terrible punctuation are kept on purpose. It's what I'm calling personality
“What?”
“We didn’t see that,” Hermione says, frowning. “Who was it?”
“And where would I find so many snakes?”
“A surprise?” Hermione asks. Ron groans. Ginny, of course, is cackling.
“Um,” Malfoy says, thrown. “I suppose.”
“Champions, over here please!” calls Professor McGonagall. Parvati beams excitedly at Harry and they both say a quick ‘See you later,’ to Ron and Blaise before they run off. The crowd parts for them, unnervingly enough, and they soon find themselves in front of McGonagall in her red tartan.
“How do you know where Slytherin is?” Malfoy asks.
“Oh,” Cedric frowns. “Those are new.”
“I’ll go with you Harry!” says Parvati happily.
“Who’s keeping secrets for Draco?” Ginny asks. “Oh, I should have known.”
It’s about a minute until Neville reappears, shedding his feathers in an instant and turning up looking just the same as usual. He joins in the laughter and gives George a high five, taking a sworn-untampered bourbon biscuit from his tray.
“Hermione has them!”
“Who’s avoiding you now?” asks Ron.
“Yes, I agree.” He flips to a page Harry could probably visualise in his nightmares. “Potter, read this paragraph, and then read it aloud for us, will you? Don’t worry about the talking part, just make sure you think the words through.”
“What are
Harry swings himself back onto his broom and kicks off hard.
“Voldemort had my wand—what else was I supposed to do?”
Harry flicks his wand sharply, actively focusing on the memory of holding and reading from it.
On the front page of his wholly-fabricated, worse-than-ever-anticipated sob story, a large solo shot of Harry is printed. Amazingly, Harry’s
You: Look just
“You next, Mr Krum.”
“Quite,” Malfoy says.
Bill: as do I
Skeeter smiles and reaches back into her bag. She pulls out a long, acid green quill and a roll of parchment. She leaves the parchment hanging in the air between herself and Harry and brings the tip of the quill to her lips. She sucks it for a moment with discomforting and apparent relish before setting it against the parchment. It shivers and flicks its long tail.
George comes past them then, laughing freely and happily, leading Cassius by the hand.
She’s very pretty, he thinks, as they curve around the fountain of ice sculptures that’s sprung up between feet. Her hair is long and wavy and is somehow not at all bustled by the twirling or the rising humidity. Her dress matches her eyes and floats around her mysteriously.
Malfoy jerks abruptly away and tries to smooth his hair and robes. He takes his bag and the cat crate from Nott and stalks off without a word.
“See you, Harry!” she calls. “Good luck!” God knows what for.
It takes three whispering groups in the common room for Harry to realise something’s happening. He goes to dinner suspicious and returns
Bell: ew shut up
“No, thank you, Granger. I can only stand so much of you noise machines.”
Harry detaches it and pins it back onto his jumper when he shrugs out of the Tournament robes.
Malfoy opens his mouth but Daphne Greengrass beats him to it. “Oh, he palmed them off on my sister, didn’t he!” she giggles. “She isn’t feeling well tonight and wanted to rest so she took them upstairs.”
“So I wasn’t just imagining things?”
“Very funny,” Harry says.
“You looked like you were drowning,” Draco says.
(let me know if it's hard to figure out who's who, I tried to make it easy)
“I really wonder where Hermione’s gone,” Ron says. “She is coming, isn’t she?”
“Of course.” Hermione smiles, picking up the dish and handing it to her. “Enjoy.”
“What could he summon, do you think?”
“Wand Weighing?” Harry asks.
“Fuck,” he mutters into his pillow.
“I’ve played already, I’ll go Chaser!”
“Come and join us, then!” Ginny yells, and they’re kicking off before she’s finished.
“What’s that?” Ron asks, pointing at some kind of fish stew.
“No?” she asks. “Then why did we come all the way over ’ere?”
These must be the Weird Sisters; they arrive to what McGonagall would pronounce terribly uncouth whooping applause, are all very hairy, dressed in black, and have chosen very particular, artistic places in which to tear their robes.
“All right, Potter!” George Weasley shouts in his ear. Suddenly, he’s hoisted into the air and sitting on his shoulders.
It seems that the moment every plate in the room is abandoned, they all vanish at once. Dumbledore stands and beckons for everyone else to follow, and with a wave of his wand all of the tables rearrange themselves to provide refreshments and seating at the back of the hall. He conjures a raised platform to the side of the head table, onto which stumps a musical group Harry has never seen before. A set of drums, several guitars, a keyboard, lute, and cello are all present on the stage and quickly taken up by the musicians.
Harry reads. He gets to the bottom of the page and goes back, reading aloud to the others.
Draco watches him quietly before slowly raising a hand to meet his. “But I’m not announcing it to the whole school.”
Annoyed and horribly self-conscious, Harry taps Cedric’s arm and murmurs lowly to him.
Cassandra: @You can I ask why you’re telling us this
You: Fine
“Without us?”
Ronaldo: yeah except harry
doesn’t know) come twirling past before Ginny steals her away, and then Harry’s being dragged farther into the fray by Katie and Alicia and loses all bearings as to where he is.
Harry tries to think of someone to ask, preferably someone who won’t hex him, and somehow comes up a bit short. Nearby the Gryffindor girls are sitting together chatting, and it pokes at the memory of his silent promise to Ginny.
—and an appraising sort of look. “All right, then.” She returns easily to Alicia, smiling this time.
“Try to keep in step with me,” Harry whispers, wishing he wouldn’t notice the press of their shoulders.
You: …
Harry turns and summons the dragon book to himself. It, too, after a little encouragement, takes an unrefined leap towards him. He decides that as long as it gets to him, he doesn’t really care if it smacks him in the face.
Harry glances over to a frowning Warrington, who nonetheless ambles over and hovers beside them.
“Why Pansy,” Zabini replies, “I
being very odd. “Your goblet’s empty.”
“Oh, go on then!” he yells back, making a face to complement his innuendo. George scrambles over and waggles the cracker in his face, and even though it looks just like all the rest, Harry holds it right at the end of his reach.
Higgs: sorry what
Ron tilts his head to the side. “People would think you’re bent though, wouldn’t they?”
You: Hey
Hope you enjoy!!
You: Well I’m here now!! And I didn’t end up in knockturn alley this time
(No pun intended.)
“Oh Harry, he’s jealous.”
“They don’t fit you!” she replies. “Here, let us help.”
We’re going to make house-elf abuse and exploitation prosecutable by law.”
Ronald: it couldn’t be him could it
Norberta: Shush we have to maintain our image of being the good children
Lavender makes a disgusted noise. “I do hope not!”
“Ah, ’ere you are!” Fleur says, hurrying up to them with two plates of food in hand. She hands one to Malfoy.
“I don’t know what you mean, Weasley,” Blaise says. “We’re all friends here.”
Madame Maxime is wandering between the enclosures. Charlie frowns.
“Charming,” Hermione says. Zabini winks at them as he passes and Greengrass giggles.
Whispers suddenly rustle like an energetic breeze through the gathered Hogwarts body.
“This is a Hungarian horntail,” Charlie says, patting the fence. “Over there’s a common Welsh green, that red one’s a Chinese fireball, and that’s a Swedish short-snout.”
to anyone, you hear me?”
“If you say so. Now, want something to eat? We brought you a couple of chicken drumsticks…”
But the fever that Ron had suddenly been afflicted with seems to be raging through the entire school. Lee is leaping up and down and pawing at Fred’s shoulder, and they pass a group of girls squabbling over the only writing implement they seem to have to hand: a bright red lipstick.
“Angie, darling!” Fred says, loudly, as he throws open the dormitory door. “I hope you aren’t stealing these young things away from their dates?”
“Are you doing all of these things?” Malfoy asks.
Harry startles again. “Er, somewhat. It’s all a bit mad if you ask me.”
Fortunately, everyone laughs, even if it is a bit weak.
Malfoy’s eyes go wide and beside Harry, Hermione chokes. “We’re not friends!”
“Bummer,” George shakes his head as they approach, “we’ll have to chase him up with this. We can owl it soon, or just shove it into his hand. Can’t avoid us forever.”
“Why keep changing owls?” Ron asks when he’s finished.
“Where are the cats?” Hermione asks.
“You have glitter on your face,” Harry tells Draco when he reclaims his seat. Draco rolls his eyes so dramatically Harry thinks he’ll strain them.
Ron raises his eyebrow scathingly. “Uh huh, sure. Anyway Harry, are you going to send that letter? We can go now before dinner. I’ll lend you Pig.”
“Oh no, Potter,” comes the sardonic chuckle, “you were far too righteous for that even then.”
The castle is filled with a buzzing of excitement and anticipation all day. Everywhere one goes there’s gossip and conversation, and the whole staff is simultaneously more snappish and lenient than usual.
You: Ugh piss off
Hermione turns her best sorrowful gaze on him. “You really have helped us this evening, Malfoy, are you sure you can’t come again tomorrow? We would all feel much better if you were there, after all.”
Hagrid is already approaching the door of the Beauxbatons carriage, and they have to jog to catch up.
“It was
“Going well?” George asks, finding himself with a lapful of kitten.
We are almost at the end of the year... we're getting there lads, we're getting there
“Hate to break it to you, but you’re about to miss breakfast,” Neville says, coming out of the bathroom.
“Just in case, Potter,” he says, louder, for people to hear. “Wouldn’t want you seen crying those precious tears of yours.”
Katie: Katie Bell
“Got your head on tight, Potter?”
Ginny hisses.
For them, this is the best job in the world—”
“Harry’s right, Ron. It’s a bit…”
She laughs disbelievingly. “Are we sure you survived that dragon? This isn’t just a daydream I’ve conjured up out of shock?”
Ronald: oi
Hogwarts is quite certainly dressed for business.
Freckes: sus
The book shuffles nearly a half an inch.
“Merry Christmas to you too, Dobby. Just maybe don’t lean over me next time, okay? Give me a prod or something.”
“I don’t think they’d believe me.”
Bill: why didn’t we think of that oh my god he could have
“That’s a good start!” Hermione encourages.
You: that’s fair
Malfoy!” he growls. ”You and your father both!”
“We don’t,” Ron sighs. “Who have you got?”
“Well, you see—” Harry begins, but Malfoy strides over and glares him up and down.
Ronald: he takes self-sacrifice to the next level
“Has Wandle been eating properly?” Malfoy asks, sitting down and peering into the pit of fur. “He seemed to have lost his appetite when I had him Wednesday night.”
“Anyway, Charlie said we only have to get past them.”
Norberta: Charles Weasley
“Sorry!” Harry splutters, feeling all of his blood rush to his face. “I’m sorry, thank you.”
Harry slips his wand from his pocket and holds it aloft. “Accio!”
“I didn’t think you two were friends?”
Ronaldo: Ronald Weasley
He gapes, affronted. “What on Earth does that mean?”
“I would first like to introduce Mr Bartemius Crouch, head of the Department of International Magical Co-operation,” he pauses for a polite but sparse applause, “and Mr Ludo Bagman, head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports!” Ludo Bagman gains a much more enthusiastic reception, which he receives in good humour. Harry frowns at the pinched and stoic Mr Crouch and is wholly understanding of why.
You: Well I highly doubt she got me this one
Snake: Ugh who here doesn’t
Norberta: The Blacks are filthy rich he could’ve bought one easy
“I really think they’d look better in black,” he says. “Is anyone any good at clothing charms?”
“Malfoy!” Harry hisses, dropping the cloak from his head. Malfoy jumps and looks up, frowning.
Harry finds himself with his arms full of Fleur and a face full of her hair.
Professor McGonagall shouts, and suddenly, the twins are nowhere to be seen.
He doesn’t particularly care about them—expected it, really. No, it’s the Ravenclaws’ distaste that becomes so disheartening. He thought, as they had no particular allegiance other than to Hogwarts, they may want to support him too. Unfortunately, they don’t like the idea of such an important artifact being tricked, or the idea that Harry is trying to earn himself more fame.
Harry braces himself for the incoming tirade, feigning occupation when Cassiopeia tries to latch her claws into his jumper sleeve to climb out.
“Blimey, you could be onto something there.”
Hermione frowns for a moment, but stashes the galleons back where they were. “Never mind. What were you saying, Fred?”
Norberta: He’s too busy snogging Fred (ew)
“Oh, you do flatter me so!” she laughs, running her fingers over the spot.
And also very apologetic ;-;
“How is he?” Charlie asks.
“Yeah, I know Charlie. Did he say what species they were?”
Spinnings: !!”£”!£$%$£625!”£!£$%$4332
“I swear I didn’t do it.”
She laughs and they disappear off towards the stage again. Harry sort of loses track a bit after that. He dances with Ginny and Dean and Seamus and Fay, even, and when George falls over him and they end up on the floor everyone around them is howling with laughter, but he and George most of all. Harry spies Fred sneaking Hermione out of Krum’s hands at one point and Ron dancing a very uncomfortable looking thing with Parkinson and Susan Bones. Neville and Draco’s date (whose name he
“I probably would have,” he agrees.
“How’d he manage to get her to agree,” Ron mumbles. “Honestly…”
“Hello, Harry Potter,” says the girl. “You’re looking very nice this evening.”
“Professor Moody!” she cries. “What are you doing?”
“What do you mean?” she asks, frowning at him as she usually does.
“Serpensortia!”
“What?” Harry says. “What’s going on?”
Ginny: I wanna know
Freckles: :O
Ginny: do you WANT Harry to die???
Harry replies. All three snakes perk up in interest, but look wary.
“I told you he likes screaming,” says Theodore Nott, an unexpectedly vicious member of the snowfight and in the middle of wrestling Neville off his back.
“A little hot under the collar, Potter?”
Just to warn, there's unlikely to be a chapter next Sunday seeing as I'll be moving into halls that day, and I need a little time to write some more of this (and also... get my shamefully neglected cherik big bang entry finished...)
They go to bed disgruntled and without a plan, suddenly highly conscious of the looming date of the first task.
“Long enough,” he mumbles. “I’ll do it, I promise.”
Queer.
The five tromp around the castle walls to stand beneath the Gryffindor dormitories. Looking up, the tower is dizzyingly tall. He can barely make out his open window until Neville leans through and sticks his arm out to wave.
“Night, Potter,” he hears Malfoy reply quietly.
You: No
“Doesn’t he always?” Ginny huffs.
The phial slips from Harry’s fingers and shatters on the floor.
“See what?” Hermione asks, leading the way towards the dungeons.
Malfoy gives him a very odd look. Actually, a look that more says that
ink themselves beneath it. He does as instructed and the star sticks to his finger. Beneath it is a green one of identical shape.
“Yeah, it’s like, we’re all civil now, and he’s sort of apologising in his own stuck-up-git way,” Ron reasons. “Well, maybe. And I hate to say it, but even Zabini’s all right.”
Though, until that Thursday, he wouldn’t have believed a lot of things. But then Professor Moody had danced an enlarged spider around the room, tortured it, and then killed it, all directly beneath their noses.
Quaffle: I have an objection
A loud bang goes off just above their heads. Harry ducks instinctively, but Bagman only curses.
Harry watches him go, hand raised weakly to wave him out. His friends farther down the table are snickering loudly.
Norberta: Carry on
“He was?”
“I shall now introduce you to our impartial judge, the Goblet of Fire.”
She sighs. “No, it’s because it’s always
and it had taken all his willpower not to burst into flames and instead pretend he had no idea what she was talking about, other than
“What are you showing me?” Harry asks, feeling guilty about hiding Malfoy under the cloak. He hopes it isn’t anything to do with those skrewts, or any cerberuses or dragons he’s bought off a stranger in the pub.
“Oh, sit
Malfoy stares at the badge. Someone clears their throat and he blinks, hurriedly reattaching his usual sneer.
“Sorry if it’s too much
Ronaldo: you’re on your own
Norberta: We’re talking about that later
“How horrible!” Hermione says. “I’ve seen some of her articles, and they’re all a load of absolute rubbish! I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a genuine truth in one of them
Dumbledore steps towards the casket and taps the very top with his wand. It melts away, falling like a curtain. Inside is a tall stone goblet, carved intricately with patterns too small for Harry to see. It would look right at home in Hogwarts, with all the gargoyles and statues, except for the bright blue flames licking around its rim. They stand tall, almost as tall as the goblet itself, moving in a peculiar manner. Almost… Sentient.
Freckles: you forgot we have a gryff chat didn’t you
“Oh, which?” Hermione asks, clearly trying not to sound too interested.
“Yeah,” Harry says, steering Malfoy inside with him. He steps out from under the cloak but keeps hold of it. “What did you want me for? Is there anything I can do for you?”
“Ron Weasley,” says Ron, sort of, because he’s halfway through his mouthful of pie and also gazing up at her in shock.
“Of course she did,” Ron snorts. “Who wouldn’t?”
“Good luck.”
an upstanding member of society!” Ron snorts.
“Did he? Gave me a five. Bastard, isn’t he?”
hisses the anaconda impatiently.
“Snuffleflump,” Harry says to the portrait, and the door swings open to a cacophony of noise.
think of that!?”
“Luck of the draw, probably,” Ron says, crunching into another biscuit swiped from the dessert selection. If Madam Pomfrey finds him, on his head be it.
He gets up, puts his book down, and meanders over to lean on the back of the sofa she’s sitting on. He forces himself to calm down, but his heart hasn’t even stopped its percussion solo from two minutes ago.
disappointed if a Gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any way. You are dismissed.”
Norberta: That’s incredible though!!!
“Really!” Hermione huffs loudly, smacking Ron upside the head when he, too, asks Harry if he has a quill.
“Sorry sir,” Colin interrupts, “but Mr Bagman says he’s needed immediately.”
“Yeah, right. Like I believe that.”
Cho releases the snitch and the quaffle goes sailing into the air. Harry speeds upwards, chasing glints of gold, but glances sideways for only a second and loses it. Malfoy smirks and tilts his head.
“They’re all up in my bag,” Harry says, amused.
That was a lie. Harry is fairly certain that he would never expect such words from his friend’s mouth in either of their lifetimes.
Draco’s face doesn’t change, but his eyes flick over him. “You have glitter on your face.”
he says, and thinks pointedly of the weight of it in his hand a moment earlier. The book falls off the desk.
It's been a while! I watched gof this evening, it kinda kicked me into gear. Fingers hella crossed I can take up some kind of semi-regular updating again, but uni really threw me into the deep end (and I'm also stuck in a star wars vortex, rip). I know this chapter is weird, and short, but I'm sorry it was more difficult than expected :(
Harry hadn’t been expecting a warm welcome, exactly, but the cold shoulder the Hufflepuffs give the whole of Gryffindor house is a bit of a kick to the stomach. He’s very glad that he doesn’t have Herbology with them until Monday, but equally unsettled at the prospect of dealing with… Well, anyone who isn’t Ron or Hermione. Or Fleur, he supposes. Fleur is nice.
“No, I mean,” Harry flounders. “I’ve never danced in my life.”
Harry remembers that day in Ollivander’s four years ago with incredible clarity, what with the way he had waved nigh-on every wand in the shop. That means he also remembers what had been so curious, and he rather hopes Mr Ollivander is not about to announce it to the whole room. Skeeter’s Quick-Quotes Quill might just explode with excitement.
Please do enjoy!
Greckles: Harry got a Firebolt this morning
The Gryffindor common room is in the middle of preparing for the anticipated battle—or rather, party. The crates from the dorm have been brought down and stacked against one wall, revered and honoured and added to by their housemates. A group of girls, Dean and George are doing makeup and hair in one corner, every so often pouncing on unsuspecting friends and dragging them in. Harry and Ron scamper upstairs to change and rejoin the preparations, and are accosted by Ginny almost instantly.
“More like snake man!”
“Come in,” a friendly voice said when he knocked on the door. He slowly entered the office, and he cursed himself for not mentally preparing a little better. Professor Dumbledore and Professor Snape’s portraits stared down at him from behind McGonagall’s desk. Both wore a friendly, almost fond expression, but Draco couldn’t meet their eyes. “Hello, Mr. Malfoy. Please, take a seat.” Draco sat down, looking at his hands. “How are you doing?”
He laughed to himself, feeling woozy and almost giddy.
“Hey—“ Harry stopped him in his tracks. Draco hadn’t noticed he had been furiously rubbing at his left arm, which was as much of a nervous tic as Harry rubbing his forehead was. “It’s going to be okay. Even if you don’t manage to cast a full Patronus during the presentation, it’ll still prove that you learned something.”
“Wha? Wha’s wrong?” Harry said groggily while turning on the lamp with a flick of his wand and putting on his glasses.
“He will likely be able to get away for a weekend to make sure you’re settled in. But only if he behaves himself—you should send him a letter at once telling him to end his antics.”
He made his way through the outer layer of the forest, relaxing as tree branches cracked beneath his feet. The fresh air was doing him some good, and he enjoyed watching various small creatures creep by him, unaware that they were in the presence of a Death Eater.
“That’s a good point,” Hermione said. “And Harry has an Invisibility Cloak, so Draco could get into the Wizengamot pretty easily.”
“Your actions say otherwise. I have nothing more to say to you. My only advice at this point is to try not to mess things up any more than you already have, though I know that will be impossible for you.”
“It’s not that he had something you didn’t. It’s just that...well I’d been around Muggles who hated me my whole life. I didn’t want to make friends with someone who did that to others.”
“I wouldn’t really have a problem with you telling her, I suppose. But I don’t think there’s a reason to tell the kid,” he said nervously.
Draco’s heart soared, and he felt rather enamored.
“It’s not your fault that Fudge turned a blind eye—“
“I hadn’t either,” Harry said, staring into the fire wistfully. “Until this past summer. Teddy is the absolute best. He can change his hair like Tonks, and he really enjoys that. He looks at you with complete love and trust. It’s honestly unlike anything I’ve ever experienced.” Serious again, Harry met Draco’s eyes. “He’s not going to know anything about your past. He’s just going to know that he has another relative who cares about him. And honestly, he needs whatever blood family he can get.”
“Are you sure? I’m sure you’ve been to plenty of nice dinners, I thought you may want to do something more unique. Money isn’t an issue, I can arrange—“
“Yes, which was killing Dumbledore. That makes all those accidents really worth it,” Zacharias Smith drawled, much like Draco did when he was trying to annoy someone.
Two more chapters left!!! How is it going to end? Was dinner with the Malfoys what you expected? How do you think the Weasleys will receive Draco? Let me know your thoughts. I hope you all are safe and well.
Granger nodded. “I’ll tell Professor McGonagall what we’re doing.”
“Hello Daphne, Blaise. Greg.” Draco said Greg’s name quietly.
“Really?” Harry tilted his head. “I hadn’t seen you with Daphne or Blaise much, but I thought you and Greg were thick as thieves.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ll go next,” Dean Thomas spoke up, already glaring at Draco. “I was on the run for most of last year, traveling with various people who would get killed by the Snatchers. I got caught and was imprisoned at Malfoy Manor because I’m a Muggleborn. Malfoy over there was present for some of it, and he didn’t do a thing.” Draco didn’t want to move a muscle—he felt as though he were surrounded by angry werewolves.
. “I’m going to explain to him what happened. You have to have some way to defend yourself. I figure maybe they can allow you to perform simple charms, or something like that—“
Mr. Malfoy?” The same voice in his mini-dream startled him awake from a half sleep. “Are you alright?”
“Oh, I know,” Draco said bitterly.
After a few more moments and kisses, Harry and Draco stumbled as the train pulled into the station. Draco didn’t even say the word “goodbye,” because it was nearly too much to bear after months of sleeping in the same room, and even the same bed. Draco gave Harry one final kiss and turned to collect his luggage and say goodbye to his friends.
(See the end of the chapter for
? Theodore Nott and his mother defected to France after his father ended up in Azkaban. Pansy Parkinson moved to America, wanted to break into the world of Wizarding fashion. He wasn’t sure where Blaise Zabini was. Vincent Crabbe was dead. He always knew the Greengrass family to be somewhat of blood traitors, so he was a little surprised to not see them—their reputation should have survived. As of right now, though, Draco was without cronies.
“Hello, Draco,” Professor McGonagall said not unkindly. “The Minister would like to have a word with you regarding the return of the Time Turner. I will leave you two in peace.” She then walked upstairs to the more private office and left the alone.
Despite not necessarily having bad memories in the room, he felt terrified. He felt as soon as he touched his hand-sewn Slytherin blanket that was draped toward the bottom of his bed, he would be instantly paralyzed. He felt as though if he sat on the bed for a moment, all the progress he made would disappear, and he would disappear into the bed with it. Instead he made for the window seat, a place which had sat cold for nearly an entire year. The gardens looked better now, but had been mostly gray and brown for the past year. It was no use looking at a view to remind him of the state of his life. Now the sun was out and he could be comfortable there again. He settled down and took out his new notebook
Draco’s brows furrowed. “Well yeah, we all saw the body...”
Harry shook his head. He looked nearly as pale as Draco always did, the brave young man clearly afraid.
Draco’s body wasn’t giving him a choice except to follow Potter’s orders. His eyes slowly closed shut—
Draco sighed and ran a hand through his hair, his nails scratching his scalp since he couldn’t flatten out his fingers. “I didn’t want to bother you about it. And I just wanted to prove to myself that I could solve a situation without messing up, for once.” Draco ignored Harry’s protests and continued. “I did go to McGonagall about it. She was a little helpful, told me that I should be empathetic. And I did, and I guess it somewhat worked out.” Draco shook his head, trying to clear his fuzzy brain. “So did McGonagall turn in the Time Turner?”
“Plenty of time?” Ron ventures.
Quaffle: absolutely none
Ginny: who’s it from?????
Cedric Diggory smiles at him in the halls, handsome and kind as ever, but his jeering friends make Harry want to move to Hermione’s other side. Harry’d heard Malfoy making noise about his incompetence mere moments after his name had been drawn from the Goblet, and in the back of his mind he’d been rather hoping that people would believe him. Just this once. Alas, like his housemates, everyone seems pretty convinced that he had entered the Tournament himself.
You: Hey
“That is my cue to leave,” Malfoy snorts. “Granger?”
(Mostly).
“It’s all Parvati and Angelina,” Ron says quickly. “I really don’t know anything about clothes.”
“I almost died!” she protests, swatting at his shoulder. “You’d’ve been crying too if you’d been me!”
He forces the horntail over and around narrow obstructions as many times as he can, speeding inelegantly over the grounds. The forest trees will provide no cover, and he decides that he’d rather not get them set on fire.
Harry frowns. “Hermione said the same. I didn’t know you’d noticed.”
Harry scrambles down onto the first few rocks. The horntail snuffles.
Hermione huffs. “Cedric’s not an idiot, you just don’t like him because he beat us at Quidditch. I’ve heard he’s a top student,
“Er, hi,” he says, and smiles. “I’m sorry, but I don’t know your name.”
Ginny: Merry Christmas!
Harry!” Hermione says quite sharply over breakfast, after he’s told them what he sent. “You didn’t imagine your scar hurting at all, and you know it.”
Three different girls ask him out over those few days, all from different houses and not his year group, and precisely none of which have ever actually spoken to him before. He turns each of them down, getting progressively redder in the face as time goes by, and his dorm mates don’t let him live a single one of them down.
Freckles: Oh?
At that moment, the gravity in the room seems to be drawing each and every person towards Professor Dumbledore.
You: They trusted him and he
He feels a pull behind his navel and a very long Burmese python slithers forcefully into existence. He smiles, taken by surprise.
“It’d do you some good.”
Harry groans, clinging to the tiles beneath his fingers.
“What’s up with you?” Parvati asks him when they sit down for drinks. “You look shaken.”
“Hedwig stands out,” Hermione mutters, though her mind is clearly still stuck on other things. “If she keeps flying to Sirius, someone might notice. She’s hardly native, and a lot of people know that Harry has a snowy owl.”
Harry shakes his head strongly. “No, thank you. It wouldn’t be fair. I have an idea, anyway.”
“Hmm, whatever. Where are we going?”
“I think he has a bit more to worry about than me,” Ron huffs.
Harry blinks at him. “And you didn’t think to mention this sooner?”
From a distance the students had looked to be built much the same as Crabbe and Goyle, though nearer Harry can see that the majority of their bulk is thanks to the thick fur cloaks they shoulder. Each one is well kept and worn with pride, but a single sleek, silver pelt stands out from all the rest. A tall man with matching silver hair strides beneath it, right up to Dumbledore to take his outstretched palm.
says the python.
“Over the past few months, Mr Bagman and Mr Crouch have worked tirelessly to bring us this most esteemed event. They will be joining myself, Madame Maxime and Professor Karkaroff on the panel of judges.”
Ronald: oh my god
Draco Malfoy saunters towards him, moments before his accident with Buckbeak. Harry almost bolts upright in shock, but once again pauses, letting his thoughts play through. Malfoy gives him a look, all the way down and up again, and a taunting raise of his eyebrows. Harry shivers. He discovers a sudden urge to know what Malfoy had been thinking. He hadn’t even noticed at the time, so basted with his own anger as he was.
“Of course he is,” snorts Ron, “he works with dragons!”
Blotches: lmao
Snape frowns and turns his attention to Malfoy while the rest of the class files in. Malfoy stands at his desk and pretends steadfastly that none of them are watching him.
“Want to go to the ball with me?”
Harry smiles. “Well… That’s great. I would love to go to the ball with you Parvati. I just, er, hope you can put up with my terrible dancing. You do have a reputation to uphold.”
Hermione flusters and tries to hide herself back in her papers. “Nothing of the sort.” Ron and Harry exchange surprised glances.
Norberta: Still you weren’t inflicting pain were you?
“Right, won’t be a mo’,” she says, and fires off three unannounced spells at him. Not unnerving at all, this woman.
The judges’ table is draped imperiously with gold, and all three headmasters, Barty Crouch and Ludo Bagman are seated there.
Norberta: I still can’t believe you two wormed your way into the hearts of all our friends
The carriage, pale blue and gilded with gold trimming, bears a coat of arms boasting two crossed wands sending out a trio of stars each.
Fleur and Viktor Krum, looking collected but a little anxious, are perched on two of four chairs by the door when they return. Fleur smiles when she sees them. She pats the chair next to her and allows her shoulders to drop, fractionally.
“Not in front of a panel of judges, you haven’t.” George taps his brother on the head with a quill.
Hermione looks up and meets their eyes shyly. Harry feels like breaking all formality and shouting across to her, but manages to settle for grinning madly (again). Parvati seems to be vibrating out of her skin, nodding encouragement despite her obvious shock. Hermione laughs and relaxes into Viktor’s side, and Harry is happy for her.
Once every last straggler has settled themselves in the hall, McGonagall wrangles the champions into a line and has them follow her into the hall. The floor looks like an ice rink without the danger—glazed snow white with hints of a cold, sharp blue, though it still feels like solid stone underfoot. Parvati hangs off Harry’s arm and appears to enjoy herself immensely, and Harry feels a sudden companionship with the horses that Uncle Vernon always watches be paraded around at Epsom Derby. The eight of them are met with thundering applause from everyone at the new, round, lantern-lit tables. Padma waves exuberantly to her sister as they go by, headed up to a large round table at the top of the hall. The judges are already seated there, though Harry realises on closer approach that instead of Barty Crouch, Percy Weasley is sitting in the fifth seat along.
per se…” he acquiesces, rubbing the back of his neck.
Norberta: And Ron, do
“Excuse me, I am nothing like our a lovesick fool of a brother. I, for one, have some pride and decorum.”
“Oi, what’s going on over there?” says Seamus, frowning and leaning forward to look.
Greckles: no
“You could,” George suggests, just as Fred knocks the side of his head and stands, stretching upward.
I'M ALIVE, I'M ALIVE
Pucey: Adrian Pucey
“I could have sworn I had two badges when we went to Hagrid’s… I gave him one, but the other has—oh!” She pulls her hand out of the plastic pocket, two shiny golden galleons in hand.
manages to make it all worse by appearing out of the blue and starting to wrench open the doors to evict embarrassed couples. Draco snorts and then does a double take when he sees the two figures up ahead of them. Harry adjusts his glasses and peers towards them, finding himself rather taken aback to find it’s Anthony Goldstein nigh-on shagging one of the blondes from the Hufflepuff quidditch team right there against the wall.
“Aren’t you one too, Weaslette?”
Ginny: love uncovering them and holding them ransom
Hermione lifts her nose from her books at that, smiling widely. Ron looks greatly taken aback, and the eyebrows on both twins have climbed their foreheads. No one around is listening, keeping the moment blessedly private.
“What? No!”
“I didn’t see Weasley as the type,” Draco says thoughtfully. “I’m glad, though. He looks happy.”
“Nice sticker, Harry,” says Collin.
“Oh, very funny!” Hermione says scathingly. The other Slytherins snicker and press their badges. “Harry, come on,” she’s saying, but Harry’s too busy grinning to pay attention.
Maybe one day I'll finish, maybe one day, but for now this is as far as we get. Not so bad though, yeah?
Dumbledore walks over to his place at the judges’ table.
Ronald: oh god remember that one time at lunch with the croissant
“One champion will be chosen from each school. They will be scored on how well they perform during each of the Tournament tasks, and whoever ends with the highest score will win the Triwizard Cup.”
“Yeah,” Harry says, and clears his throat. He turns back to Draco and suddenly finds the need to look anywhere but at his face. He’s embarrassing himself.
“Harry!”
“What?!” Hermione and Ron demand.
Ronald: to be fair it could have been a slytherin
“Oh Merlin and Morgana both,” Ron whimpers. “It’s Viktor Krum!”
“Nose out, or I’ll burn that for you too,” Fred says, waving his wand around. “Anyway, you lot got dates for the ball? I heard Miss Granger has an admirer!”
Bill: Merlin
“We’ve spoken,” Ron mumbles, face absolutely burning. Harry sits down on the sofa and pats him on the back a few times.
“Testing,” she says, and the quill begins to move. “My name is Rita Skeeter, reporter for the Daily Prophet.”
Harry’s reluctance to see the joke in Moody tormenting him.
Freckles: what?
“We’re
“Who says we party?”
Once seats are taken, an expectant hush falls over the congregation.
Katie: I am on the
Seconds later, a large, bright yellow canary stands in Neville’s place. The room roars with laughter, shuffling closer to see him hop around and ruffle his feathers.
Quaffle: did Harry just have a stroke
“Blimey, look at those spines,” Hagrid says. Harry peers forward and does indeed see dozens of razor-like spines all along the dragon’s tail. Horntail indeed.
Ron walks with Harry over to the tunnel. “Fleur’s was pretty impressive,” he says. “She shot this spell at it that made it wobble around a lot, vertigo, maybe, and then put on a light show to confuse it! All sorts of exploding sparks of light and fireworks—it was really cool. And then Krum came on and didn’t even think about flying! Imagine! He used a spell that did something to the dragons eyes and—oh, look!”
Ah, what the hell.
Norberta: You’re terrible
Harry, Ron, Seamus, Dean and Neville change into their dress robes up in the dormitory. Harry can barely get the buttons right, much less tie his neck thing—bowtie. Ron is surveying himself in the mirror and looks moments away from combusting due to mortification.
A woman taller than any Harry has seen before appears in the doorway, stepping down gracefully to meet them. She is, probably, not much taller than Hagrid, though taken aback as he is in surprise, Harry cannot help but think her giant. The light from the castle illuminates her figure and casts deep shadows in her wake. Her hair is a shimmering brown, falling delicately curled into a bob below her chin. Dumbledore begins to clap, and the rest of Hogwarts follows his lead. Behind this giant woman, the students of Beauxbatons are leaving the carriage.
Blotches: Miles Bletchley
It catches him, just as he knew it would.
but it more than makes up for it in girth.
He writes to Sirius n the common room that evening with Hermione hanging over his shoulder.
“So? Read it again, please.”
Freckles: they’re kids
“I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Harry tells her, and returns the tongue she sticks out at him.
The music has taken a drastic turn. Harry assumes this is more the band’s regular programme, with the cheering crowd and rowdy flailing. It kind of looks like his worst nightmare, and he must accidentally show it on his face.
“Hey, Draco,” Harry says, and doesn’t choke on his own spit. He’s suddenly quite agonisingly aware of the state of his entire body; his palms are sweating, his feet feel less than coordinated, his face is no doubt flushed, and his hair probably looks like it usually does. At least he knows his robes aren’t anything offensive—he’d been poked and prodded by the best, after all.
Harry looks at him skeptically, and then winces at the crick in his neck.
“I thought she’d like to see,” Hagrid replies distractedly, still gazing around.
Harry frowns. He shoves his wand in his back pocket and takes the book.
You: Hahaha I wish
Saturday 16:23
“Hermione, I’m fine,” he says for the third time.
“It’s about the Tournament!” he says. “The… Beauxbatons and Durmstrang are arriving on Sunday, and we’re going to meet them before the feast!”
“What’s going on?” he asks as they approach the Fat Lady.
“Hagrid, what—”
Also I'm overwhelmed by all of the positive responses so far! Thank you all!!
Headboy: It was probably all that praise and those highly endearing stories you used to tell
“That idiot, Triwizard Champion?”
“Oi, Dean!” says Ron in a loud stage whisper. “Fancy sneaking to Hogsmeade?”
He hums and twirls it around his fingers. It emits a number of beautiful pink and gold sparks that flicker and sparkle. Squinting, he stills the wand to examine it.
Harry shrugs. He runs the handkerchief between his fingers. “Maybe I subconsciously took what you said to heart. Maybe I’m only being civil for the project.
Harry is beginning to feel the chill seeping through his cloak, despite his shoulders being pressed up against his friends’. He keeps the kitten crate in front of him, smiling as they tumble around and sniff warily at the clamour outside of their sanctuary. He notices that Ginny and Hermione are shivering too.
“I polished it just last night,” Cedric says with a grin, flashing a split-second look over his shoulder to wink at Harry. Harry chokes, and he and Fleur try not to giggle too loudly. Harry holds up his own wand, with all its many fingerprints, and shrugs dramatically to Fleur who snorts. Even Viktor looks amused.
Draco scoffed. “Don’t be stupid. He’s never given any indication that he likes me.”
“Well, what exactly would happen if your parents found out? Like through someone else, or through the press?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, but these sort of memories have to be very...concentrated. It has to fill you with really intense happiness. We can give it a try, though. Stand up and take out your wand.” Draco complied. Harry showed him the hand motion for casting the spell. “Now, close your eyes and let everything you just told me flow through you. Don’t think about the details of the day, though. Think about the feeling, let it build inside of you. Think about how happy you were and how loved you felt. And when you’re ready, cast the spell.”
The bathroom had been fixed, but was still abandoned due to Myrtle and the bad things that had occurred there. Draco had used it as a hideout sometimes in seventh year, and welcomed the familiar surroundings. He sank to the floor, trying not to vomit, and held his head in his hands.
This made Draco’s heart pound. “Minister, I—I think he’s in trouble. Can you help him?”
Draco was lost in thought for a little while when Potter suddenly burst in the room, shutting the door clearly behind him. He started to fling out some pajamas. Draco looked at the clock—it was only eleven. “What’s got your panties in a bunch, Potter?”
That did get a small laugh out of Harry. “Well, I wasn’t successful in dropping out so you’d have to be on your own there, mate. No, I just—“ his smile disappeared. “It’s just that the Ministry is clearly struggling, you know? You were literally almost kidnapped and they’re more concerned about throwing your parents in Azkaban without a trial or solid evidence than they are about your safety. There are dozens of Death Eaters still around waiting to...well, I don’t even know! And that’s the problem! No one knows what they’re doing.”
? “What do you want, then?” Apparently Potter shared his confusion.
Other than that, he kept a low profile. Well, as much as he could, give that he was dating the Boy Who Lived. Harry’s conversation with Ginny and the rest of the DA seemed to have changed some people’s attitude toward Draco. Mostly, he was ignored, which suited him perfectly fine. It was odd to bask in the comfort of no one caring about him when he spent so long trying to be the center of attention.
Draco didn’t have the heart to tell Narcissa that he chose not to see Lucius, so he just nodded and watched as his mother was led away. Draco wanted her so badly to not be sentenced to life in prison. He wanted his mother back. But if they were both freed, he couldn’t imagine the wrath from Lucius that would await him...
“Er...” Draco was silent for a few moments as he thought. Harry looked concerned. “Well of course I have a lot. It’s hard to choose one,” Draco said defensively.
Ughhhh I love writing this developing friendship! Please let me know what you think. I love you guys
This is where the romance officially begins!! You guys have waited long enough. I’m thinking there will be a few more chapters in this installment of the series, then a week long break so I can recharge my creative juices, and then we’ll start the next installment! Let me know what you think and if you have anything you want to see—I feel like I’m pretty good at accommodating your guys’ requests!
“It’ll just make it worse when he gets out, though. If he gets out, I guess.”
Now that Harry and Draco are official, there are some things to decide.
Draco hesitated for a few moments. He felt guilty about just how nervous he was. He was going home, he was going to get to see his mother—these were all good things. Only in the past two years did he start to want to stay at Hogwarts rather than be in the comfort of his own home. “I don’t want to lie to you,” he said. “I am. Particularly to see my father.”
She began to run diagnostic spells on him. “Have you signed up for a Mind Healer appointment?”
Draco frowned. “I
“That’s it. I’m talking to Kingsley. You have to be able to defend yourself, at least in the hallways, or it’s just going to get worse and worse.”
“I know, mother,” Draco said into her shoulder.
Draco collapsed back into the chair, sobbing. The absence of the Patronus did not help him control his emotions either, and he dug his nails so hard into his arm that blood trickled onto the borrowed cloak. Draco knew he had to pull it together before his father came in, though. He sniffed and held his breath until he was able to stop crying, the room spinning around him. He used all the techniques Aunt Bellatrix had taught him to empty his mind.
Draco sat at one end of the largest couch, and Harry sat beside him, just close enough for them to touch their fingers. “Have you eaten?” Mrs. Weasley asked, wringing her hands together nervously.
“That’s kind of what I enjoy about you,” Harry said. “You get it. Remember Dumbledore’s Army?”
“Okay, so honoring everyone. Does anyone have any initial ideas?” Draco’s arm was still warm where Harry had grabbed it. He sat on his hands to keep them from shaking.
I think people bash on Ron way too much—he just seems aggressive at times because he’s so loyal to Harry! Anyway, I think this part of the story only has a few chapters left. I’m going to end this part of the series once they officially get together, which will likely be soon! Let me know if there’s anything you want to see and what you think.
Draco loved seeing Harry’s face light up like a Christmas tree. Though Harry was astoundingly bad at making snowballs and Draco had to smooth every one that his boyfriend contributed to the pile, Harry seemed to be having the time of his life. Draco realized that he rarely saw the Boy Who Lived be excited about anything. Happy or content, certainly. But rarely looking forward to something. Draco wanted to make him feel like this every second of the day.  “Whose idea was this?” Harry asked.
As September bled into October, the eighth years were making some headway with designing a memorial for the fallen. Some of the initial animosity between the four Slytherins and the rest of the students was waning, though people certainly still hated Draco the most. It was even agreed upon, by a narrow majority, that Vincent’s name would sit among the other fallen students. Greg beamed as the final vote was cast, knowing that the man he had loved would be immortalized, though not in the way anyone thought or expected.
“Draco—I had no idea. I—“ Harry sighed. “That’s awful. I’m sorry I made you tell me if you weren’t ready. I hate it when people do that to me, and I shouldn’t have done it to you. I can leave you alone if you want.”
“Potter said we could come.”
” This was a compromise in Draco’s opinion—refusing politely.
Both boys sat in silence for a few minutes. Then Potter spoke up quietly. “I feel the same way, when I think my scar hurts. In that moment I’m terrified that he’s back. But Draco,” Harry put his hand on Draco’s arm, and Draco met his gaze. “I saw what became of him. He’s gone for good.”
“I—I know I have a lot to apologize for,” Draco started, feeling very small. “Years of stuff...”
“You didn’t,” Draco said more forcefully than he intended. Feeling frustrated, he turned to face Granger fully. “Why do you talk to me? You should
He felt a little less cold than he did when the first got back, but he couldn’t shake his father’s words out of his head. He was confused—if anything, Lucius had always been upset with Draco for his lack of interest in his father’s business dealings. Now Lucius accused Draco of wanting his parents in Azkaban so he could have the Malfoy family fortune.
Draco and Blaise sat across from Gregory and Daphne at the very end of the table, while all the other eighth years gathered as far away from them as possible. It was Potter, Granger, and Longbottom that sat the closest to them, but even they kept a respectable distance.
Madame Pomfrey met his gaze and spoke gently. “Likely from overexposure to curses, dear.” Draco couldn’t recall a time when Madame Pomfrey ever called him ‘dear.’ “Not to worry, the long-term effects are not significant, though much more and they would have been. If you’d like, there are exercises you can do to help your brain heal.”
“Harry! Malfoy?!” It was none other than Ronald Weasley, flipping through merchandise.
Content warning for blood and violence.
Christine looked at him with concern. “Of course,” she waved her wand. “Do you want some water?”
Harry looked at Draco to make sure he wasn’t being too self-deprecating. “Honestly? A little bit. But don’t worry about it. I explained to the whole family that this was a possibility.”
“Sometimes that’s not possible,” Blaise said. “And the point of this year is for us to build up our lives enough again so that we can go our separate ways in peace. It’s not selfish to want a good life, Draco.”
Rare tears shone in Narcissa’s eyes, but like her son, she did not let them fall. “I love you so much, my son. My Dragon.”
After a few moments of silence, Draco looked over to see Harry staring at the cauldron, his eyes far away. “You alright?”
Harry noticed that Draco was calming down. “You alright?”
Shivering under the new moon, Draco stepped into the castle and trudged up to his room. Everyone must have been finishing up dinner at this point—it was nearly nine o’clock. The common room was void of anyone who cared about him anymore. His friends were likely eating late, and those who despised him were probably still holed up in the shack. He shifted his trunk and turned the doorknob to his bedroom.
It was a gorgeous fall day at Hogwarts. He could see the lake where the giant squid lived, the water reflecting the clear blue sky. The temperature was mild with a slight wind, just enough for him to smell the ripening fruit on the trees. Draco stepped closer and closer to the edge.
“Hey, it’s not like I’m not used to it,” Harry said good-naturedly.
“Your sympathy ploy isn’t working on us. Even if you’re not a liar about your tongue, you probably deserved it. It’s nothing compared to what my family suffered,” Finch-Fletchley continued.
“I have no intentions.”
to ask him out!”
“Not until I spent Christmases at Hogwarts or at the Weasley’s. At the Dursley’s, Dudley enjoyed pelting me with snowballs, but it was hardly a fight. He’d bring them in the house and fling them through the cupboard. I got him good a few times, but Uncle Vernon would be furious.”
“Sorry about that,” Cedric murmurs.
Harry gives him a look. “I think you’re more important to me than any of that.”
“See you later!” she calls over her shoulder, balancing the plate in her other arm to wave.
As soon as they finish eating, they race up to the Gryffindor Tower. Pig has long since been released to the owlery, but Harry retrieves the letter from where Ron’s left it on his pillow and takes it down to the common room.
Ginny agrees from across the table.
“Stop avoiding trying to help, Draco,” Zabini snickers with obvious relish.
“Oh, you should’ve been there! It was—” Ron turns suddenly and claps both of his hands to her mouth, almost pushing her off balance.
Quaffle: exactly
“How could you tell?” he snorts.
Bill: Harry what happened? We’re here to help you
Leek: i stg oliver do you not have any technical knowledge
hungry.”
Greckles: AAAAAA
Harry makes the mistake of looking at Draco—and fuck, when
“Make sure you don’t stay up all night worrying about me,” he smirks, handing over the box. He leans in and taps the noses of all eight kittens. “You look after him, all right? Wouldn’t want to harm his delicate complexion.”
“What’s a fishing line?” he hears Zabini whisper to Ron.
“How’s that a message?” Ginny huffs. “It’ll burst your eardrums sooner than tell you anything.”
“Why are you even here?” Hermione asks nastily.
her like her, or…?” She gapes, and he realises what he’s just said. “Oh, shit, sorry, I’m so sorry, that was really insensitive, wasn’t it? I really… I should keep my mouth shut…”
Ginny laughs, and Harry laughs with her.
“I can do all sorts of things,” he says, “but it’s not like you’ve taken the time to find out, is it?”
“Brilliant! Well done!” Ron cheers. He’s lucky that both Malfoy and Hermione have been persistent in learning sound-cancelling charms.
idea!” Harry refutes.
Snake: I can’t tell you, I don’t know what they’ll do if they find out
Freckles: be quiet
“Nah,” Seamus says, grinning at the pile at the end of his bed, “presents!”
You: Don’t worry I’ll be your friend Fred
There’s a much more noticeable tug this time, and the widest anaconda Harry’s ever seen bursts through. It doesn’t quite have the length of the python, which truly is
Again, nothing.
You: :/
“Careful, Potter,” he says. Harry bites his lip and stamps down the urge to tell anyway. He catches Malfoy’s gaze and winks.
Although undoubtedly better than the period immediately post-Great Goblet Debacle, Harry considers the next week a living nightmare. Neither can he find the courage nor drive to walk up to a girl and ask her out to the ball. Not even on Professor McGonagall’s pain of death.
Ron's a good friend and I love him, he's just insecure
Finally,,, Slytherin Qudditch practise
“You two make a right pair then,” Ginny giggles.
“I knew you must have something like this. An
“Harry…” She looks at him with a truly sorrowful expression. He knows she’s worried, but fussing isn’t going to help.
“It is a bit funny,” Harry agrees, and without noticing, the knots in his stomach subside just a little. Hermione sobers up instantly.
“Cedric!” several people shout. Cedric turns around just in time to be piled upon by five of his friends shouting and congratulating him.
As soon as it comes to a stop the door opens. A boy wearing robes his school colours leaps down from the platform, fumbling inside the carriage for a moment before a set of huge stairs extends to the ground. He stands aside, and several people gasp. It instantly becomes clear why the set-up is of such great size.
“Hey!” both of them protest, though their attention is only held for half a moment at the most.
my life’s just gone over that tipping point of madness. I don’t even care anymore.” Ron nudges him with his elbow, brows rising. “I have you and Hermione, and at least three others who seem to want to help me in this shitshow. What can Malfoy do? He’s even been nice recently. Second chances, and all that.”
“Are you going to let go of my hand? And of course they did, you had a
Bill: wait
“Don’t question it! You deserve it!”
“As in,
Ronaldo: my room
“What the hell is going on with them?” Harry asks.
Harry pulls the cracker Cho finds for him. She wins a bright orange pirate’s hat and throws more crackers to Ron and Hermione, as if they’d lose out when there are piles of them all over the place. Harry assumes she just really likes Christmas crackers.
Freckles: love it when mum goes off on us like that <3
Skeeter hums. “How do you feel about the tasks ahead? Excited? Nervous?”
“Harry,” Parvati hisses out of the side of her mouth. Harry looks up and realises that all of the lanterns on the tables have dimmed, and that the other champions and their partners are standing up. He hurries to his feet and to help Parvati over to the floor, taking up position as one of four points on this Triwizard compass. He mixes up his hands and gets glared at and forcefully corrected, all luckily in time for the first few notes of the night.
They pass by in favour of Hagrid’s, and Harry leans forward to knock on the door.
Headboy: Actually that should go to Harry too
for help?” Ron whispers.
To his intrigue, Harry feels his t-shirt straighten, press itself, and then tuck itself into his jeans. The jeans then begin to shrink and change, pulling up to a proper length and fitting more closely to his thighs and calves. She seems to have kept them slightly loose still, how he likes them. Lastly the jumper shrinks in, morphing from moth-bitten and a bit lumpy to sleek and new and sticking to his ribs.
The fourth and closest dragon is a sleek, oil-slick purply-black, petrifyingly menacing and reptilian and making the most horrendous screeching noise.
it hisses. It rises up as tall as Harry and almost as wide.
You gave Krum a ten!”
I know I moved the timeline around a bit with Hermione leaving divination early but I felt like it
“Are you offering to help?” Harry teases.
“Right. Come with me Professor Moody,” she commands, and heads back into the castle.
He snorts, but his throat is closing up again. “Tell me about it.”
Freckles: yeah? Anyway we need to tell the team
He’s met with four equally unreadable stares. “Okay, maybe it won’t be
Ron narrows his eyes at the air of finality to her words. “You’re only defending him because he’s
“Oi, ’Mione, why’d you suddenly go and ask
“It’s because they’re always at least a size too big,” Parvati says. “You end up swamped.”
Malfoy tilts his head. “Explain it to me then.”
Freckles: <3
The horntail flaps towards him and shrieks when he dodges. Malfoy’s stupid stab does sound like it might be useful right about now, but then again, anything would.
She narrows her eyes but places her fingers in his outstretched palm, clutching her overstuffed notebook to her chest.
“Woah,” he murmurs, gazing up at the decorations that have appeared overnight. The candles have been pushed towards the enchanted ceiling, and over each house table hangs a large silk banner: Gryffindor’s red with a golden lion, Hufflepuff’s yellow with a black badger, Ravenclaw’s blue with a golden eagle, and Slytherin’s green with a silver snake. The animals move, proud and graceful, as an imaginary draught ripples across them. Over the fifth table hangs the Hogwarts Crest, all four house insignia slotted together around a large golden H, moving freely from house to house.
Draco shook his head. “I have no idea. My lawyer isn’t telling me anything, no one is.” He pressed his palms against his eyes and sighed. “I’m sorry to disturb your nap, Potter. Thanks for listening to my tale of woe. I can pay you for your time, if you’d like.”
an actual threat, Malfoy!”
“That’s weird though, isn’t it? That Barty Crouch Jr posing as Moody would want to turn you into a ferret. I would think that you’d be a favorite of his, given your father.”
It seemed as though the world stopped. Tilly, the house elf, had come to refill their drink glasses but nearly dropped the pitcher. She couldn’t escape quickly enough. Lucius looked nearly triumphant, while Narcissa’s expression was unreadable.
Draco racked his brain. It was hard to remember what all he confessed to doing in those hazy days right after the battle. But given that he didn’t care much about self-preservation at the time, he was sure that he told Mr. Burke and the Wizengamot everything they needed to know. “I don’t think so.”
Draco was still shivering later that night by the fire, but he was sure he had never been happier. “I don’t think we should have been out there that long,” Harry said, bringing Draco his third mug of hot chocolate. “I think your body is still recovering.”
Yarney opened the door and gestured for Draco to follow him outside. “Magic suppressor. It keeps you from performing any magic, but it also dampens the effects of the Dementors.”
A burst of cold air blew in as the door opened, making Draco shiver both with chill and with the memory of the past night. “Yer leaving?” Hagrid said as he came in carrying a watering can.
“Who’s ‘they’? No one is going to know about this, got it?” Draco glared at the three of them. “It’s embarrassing enough.”
Ginny continued, not looking terribly angry. Did she believe him? “Okay, let’s say that you had nothing to do with this. Let’s say someone is trying to plant this in your possession to frame you. Even so, you don’t know Harry, Draco. He’s still really fragile. He’s not doing as well as he seems after everything. He needs something easy, something stable. If you truly care about him, you won’t mind waiting a few years. If it’s meant to be, you’ll find your way back to each other. But he doesn’t need his right now. You have to understand that.”
Potter looked regretfully at him. “No, that’s not what I mean at all! Actually, quite the opposite.” He sighed. “So many people think that I just know everything. It wasn’t even my idea to start Dumbledore’s Army—it was Hermione’s. And then she was just telling me how great of a teacher I’d be because of what I’d gone through and what I’d done. I told everyone at the time, that was all mostly luck.” He smiled to himself. “Later on, I actually got accused by a lot of adults of only being able to cast the Expelliarmus charm. But that’s not really something to teach an advanced class.”
He smiled, genuinely smiled for the first time in who knows how long when he heard the snap of wood breaking and magic dissipating.
“Yes.”
“NO! HELP PLEASE! SOMEBODY HELP!”
Draco and Harry were silent for a few moments. Draco’s blood was boiling under the surface—he felt both a rush from making her angry and guilt for his reflexive anger. He glared at Potter. “Why are you still here?”
Dean Thomas released a Stinging Hex on Draco’s cheek that felt just like a good slap. “This is an interrogation, Malfoy. You’ll only talk when it’s to answer our questions.”
There was no clear and quick solution, and Draco didn’t want to draw attention to himself by just staring blankly at the door. He took a deep breath and walked inside.
As much as you already have. “Yes, Father.”
“Why wouldn’t you be allowed in your own home? It’s yours!” Blaise protested.
“Woah, mate, what did those books ever do to you?” Blaise walked in the room with Greg and Daphne following close behind.
Draco snapped out of his stupor. He was going to leave tonight, no matter what. He couldn’t stand to be in this household regardless of how far away he stayed from his parents. Draco quickly opened his trunk and pulled out the special notebook to write a message to Harry.
e.” Draco clenched his fist and closed his eyes, bracing himself for rejection.
“Draco?” She exclaimed, and Draco quickly moved forward to shush her.
Narcissa turned to Draco, eyes shining with more tears. “Please, my love, tell Lucius that I love him. Tell him to be strong for me, okay?”
“You—you called me Harry. You did that the other day, too.”
Draco straightened his tie as he looked in the mirror. Sunday had finally come again, and he was preparing to visit his parents in Azkaban. The eighth year dormitory was blissfully quiet as people were out enjoying the fresh autumn air. None of his friends or Potter knew where Draco was going today, or what he was doing. Part of Draco was upset that no one seemed to care. The more rational part of him realized this made sense given that he had been ignoring everyone for the past week.
Draco leaned back, determined not to fall asleep despite his exhaustion—this conversation probably matched how much he had spoken this entire summer. Maybe half an hour passed with Draco just staring out the window, his mind blissfully blank, before there was a knock on the compartment door. Draco and Harry turned to look at the door, but neither moved. The curtain blocked their view of who was on the other side.
Draco desperately wished that he could follow the others out of the shack. He knew for certain that a panic attack was coming on. He thought coming here would be the most anxiety-inducing part, but hearing everyone’s stories rattled him to his core, the shakes in his mind bringing up memories that he constantly fought to keep down. Dean Thomas hung back, but Weasley nodded him forward. Finally, it was just himself and Ginny alone in the shack. “I’m not sure I’ll ever forgive you, Malfoy,” she started. “But I guess we all have to move on somehow.”
“Very, very distantly, and I don’t think—“
“What?” Harry said. “Why are you taking him in and not me?”
And with that, Draco was left alone in Professor McGonagall’s office. Mr. Burke’s words echoed in his head.
The two joined Gregory and Daphne in the common area to pass some time by playing games for a few hours. Finally, it was nearing eleven o’clock, and Potter returned with a grin. “Ready to go?”
“Oh. That’s nice.” Draco wasn’t really sure if that warranted congratulations, but he got the sense that Harry just needed to talk and wasn’t really listening to Draco anyway.
“Well, you figured out everything with the Time Turner. I’m sure that has to count for something. He’ll be spending Christmas at home thanks to you,” Blaise contributed.
Potter frowned. “What is that?”
was so beautiful. Draco wanted to kiss that scar, to kiss all of his scars and have Harry kiss his until both of them felt whole again.
“No, no. I—thanks.” Draco stood up to leave, putting his hand on the chair’s armrest as the world swayed a bit. He could hear Professor Snape’s portrait make a faint noise of concern behind him.
Draco met his eyes and then shrugged.
Potter. Draco shot up in bed, trying to ignore the shooting pain through his skull. It was dark, and it appeared that he was the only one in the Hospital Wing. Focus. You have to make sure Harry Potter is alright. Draco stood up and had to clutch the bed frame for support—how many days had he been unconscious? Ignoring the spinning room, he thought about the task before him—seven flights of stairs. He could do it, though, for Harry.
Granger went on to tell a story about fighting Nagini, who was disguised as Bathilda Bagshot. It was not too terribly depressing, but highly interesting, and by the end she had people clapping as she described their getaway.  “Who wants to go next?”
Hermione seemed to understand why Draco was uncomfortable and chimed in. “No worries, Draco. I can actually kill two birds with one stone here and talk with Kingsley about some new laws supporting the rights of house elves.”
Dean went next. He told Draco about his life on the run, how scared he was for his family. He told Draco how cold it was out in random forests, how it felt to watch his fellow companions get taken by Snatchers, some of them killed. Dean spoke of the hunger, the cold, the pain of knowing that his friends were at Hogwarts but were perhaps no safer than he was.
There was nothing else in the room to look at, save for a single chair and a cart full of potions and uneaten meals. Draco was forced to look at the figure in the bed.
“I thought someone back at the dorm could heal me quickly, it wasn’t a wound that warranted the Hospital Wing, in my opinion. It’s just that everyone was at lunch, and by the time I figured that out, I was too dizzy to walk there.”
“No no, not a disease,” Harry looked amused. “Just a—a thing. It’s normal, especially for someone who’s been through a lot, y’know? You probably weren’t hearing me but I went through the same thing—“
“Exactly,” Harry smiled. “Have you eaten anything today?”
For a few moments, Mr. Burke didn’t say anything. He looked...almost uncomfortable, maybe a little angry. “Sir?” Draco asked hesitantly.
Draco swallowed another sip of the hot chocolate. “Well, thanks. I’m fine now. So you can go.” He looked down at his still trembling hands.
“So,” Kingsley leaned back. “What can I do for you all? Is this about the memorial?”
This action immediately brought Draco back to first year, when he offered Harry a place by his side. He had made some stupid speech about not wanting Potter to hang with the wrong crowd, and then he extended his small hand to reach Harry’s. Harry Potter refused him. After his father had told Draco to try and befriend the Boy Who Lived, Draco was horribly disappointed in himself.

Would he even be allowed inside the Ministry tomorrow? How would his mother feel not seeing him sitting in the stands?
“However, we cannot move forward without acknowledging what is behind us. We have all been greatly affected by the Second Wizarding War. We have lost loved ones, been injured in the mind and body, and continue to remember those dark days. The fallen will not be forgotten for their ultimate sacrifice.” She paused, and everyone bowed their heads in mourning. “In this poignant moment, I am pleased to announce that those who have returned to Hogwarts at the age of eighteen to earn their degree properly—our eighth year students—will have the year-long project of deciding how we should remember our heroes, and our villains.”
Draco sat next to Harry, not saying anything. Harry had his eyes closed and was breathing deeply—Draco didn’t want to interrupt whatever ritual this was. After about a minute, Harry turned toward Draco, looking calmer.
“I’m sure of it,” Draco said. “But I’m also sure of
Despite his attempt to avoid the eighth-years, they seemed to specifically try and seek him out. It appeared that there were two camps of thought. Those close to Harry were the kindest and most open, as evidenced by when Longbottom approached Draco at the Great Hall:
