what that means, Draco; did you really think I wouldn’t figure it out?” Potter rolls so that he’s straddling Draco’s hips now, with his hands planted on either side of Draco’s head; without his glasses, his eyes are so, so green.
“Fuck!” Ginny shouts, whirling and stomping out of the kitchen. She has no desire to rehash the terrible argument they’d had over this, all those months ago, but she’s furious. “Fucking

Groaning internally, Harry considers trying to steer them to the break room for coffee and delay a bit more, but it’s too late—Seamus has spotted them.
Draco puts his nose in the air. “I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about, Potter,” he sniffs, but the corner of his mouth is jumping a bit, and he only ever calls Harry
He considers opening his eyes, taking a glance down his body to see what exactly he looks like, but decides he doesn’t want to see. The feeling is enough for him, and anyway, his body belongs to Harry when they’re doing this—Harry decides who gets to see it.

from it. She can’t leave Harry behind like that, though—the shadows behind his eyes are too heavy, and the papers are so cruel when someone notices she’s left him to fend for himself, and she can’t put him—
“Are you sure, Harry?” Draco coos, slowly pulling the toy out. “I’m bigger than this. Are you sure you can take me?”
” Harry hisses out, squirming as much as he can in Draco’s firm grip. “Faster, I need—
Usually, that’s enough to keep their nightmares away those nights.
“Weasley, what I’m doing here is of no concern of
Draco glances at his wristwatch. “About ten more minutes. I took it a little after three, like the note said.” He won’t meet Harry’s eyes. Harry’s not sure what he’d see in them, anyway; not in this unfamiliar shade of brown, not after so long.
Harry looks grateful, but his smile soon turns filthy. “And when do you think that

Things are getting heated, and Potter’s thrusting against him, and Draco’s starting to wonder if he’s going to come in his pants like he’s back in Hogwarts again, when an alarm starts blaring, and they spring apart.
even if she hasn’t been called up to the pro squad yet, she realises that Harry’s recitations about his day are short and vague to the point of being useless.
and Draco’s body heats. He’s spent enough time in competitive sport to find aggression kind of hot—so sue him. “
Harry cuts her off, for Ron’s sake—he still looks half-concussed and is clearly not registering a single thing she’s saying. “Hermione—Malfoy’s got a stack of books over there, and the one that’s open now, it wasn’t before; Ron read off the cover, it was in Latin, and then there was this blast of massive silver light. They were both unconscious when I got to them.”
and when she drags herself through the Floo at Grimmauld all she wants is dinner, and a hot shower, and bed, preferably with Harry in it.
It starts soft, gentle, exploratory, but then Potter’s hands slide down from Draco’s shoulders to his waist, and then his arse, and Draco moans into his mouth, and soon Potter has to pull off his glasses and send them winging back into the kitchen, and in the momentary distraction his magic sliding through the air causes, manages to shove Draco down against the couch and crawl on top of him.
Finally, with a sense of dread, he goes back into the guest room. Potter’s dimmed the lights almost all the way, and Draco can barely make out the lump that is his body under the duvet, curled up and facing away from the door.
Potter swallows around his cock once, twice more, then pulls back, wipes his mouth, and stands, undoing his jeans and shoving them and his pants down to mid-thigh. “Merlin, you smell so
It’s a fruitless evening huddled out in the December chill. The stakeout was a complete dead end, as Draco knew it would be. Harry’s not stupid enough to be staying where his return address indicated.
Draco drops by Harry’s office before Harry even makes it in for the day and, through the judicious application of expensive pastry and flattery, is able to convince his secretary to reschedule Harry’s second-to-last meeting for the day, a full forty-five minutes on his schedule, and not say anything about it.
His hand shakes and he forces himself to take a deep breath, then casts some diagnostics. Harry’s coming back to himself now, more and more every moment, and with each breath that he doesn’t need any longer the impulse to hesitate, to wait
Bill does his best to not laugh at them, but a few chuckles slip out when Potter has to throw his arms around Draco’s neck when he tries to get up from his chair, forcing Draco to pull Potter’s torso up against his to keep them both from tumbling over. Draco shoots him a venomous glare, but Bill only winks at him and shoos them to St Mungo’s.
Draco keeps his eyes closed as his legs are lowered back to the table; docilely, he allows himself to be manipulated, first as Harry cleans off his cock and arse, then as he releases him from the cuffs, and finally as he slowly, carefully removes all the wax.
“Here I am, was in the ladies’ and stopped to order some wine at the bar—that beer you ordered me was ghastly, Ron. Hi, Harry, glad you could make it, long day?” Hermione nudges Ron further towards the wall so she can sit down next to him.

“You’re a proper genius,” Harry yawns, but he sits up and stretches and shoots Draco a fond smile.
As soon as Malfoy has his footing again, he shoves Harry onto the bed, and Harry goes easily, too turned on to protest at the rough treatment.
It helps that Harry’s in the same state. Draco catches his eyes every time he looks over, and Harry’s body is angled towards him all night, his hand at his side in a fist as if he’s stopping himself from reaching for Draco when they’re close.

Malfoy, just like you did at school.”
Just before she leaves, he mentions something about a probation program, for people who either didn’t commit prosecutable crimes but were still involved, or who were underage when they were pressed into Tom’s service. She’s not so sure how she feels about it, but Harry seems to think that it’s worthwhile, that some of the people they’ll be working with deserve a second chance.

Draco’s breathing is fast and uneven against the side of Harry’s head, and he hunches forward a bit as he adds a second finger. “God, you should see…” he trails off, pressing hard on Harry’s prostate and sending a warm flush of pleasure through Harry’s whole body.

all over the room. Getting ready for bed is slightly more fraught as Draco has to help Potter with changing into (Draco’s!) pyjamas, but finally he gets Potter safely into bed.
He can’t forget, though, what it felt like to show up at Malfoy’s flat the week before his birthday to find the entire place cleared out, with not even a note explaining where he’d gone. He can’t forget how being
He sets his wand down and turns to face Harry, who’s smiling at him with a few too many teeth. “Is
Obligingly, Draco kisses just under Harry’s jaw, then sucks over his tendon, scraping his teeth over the sensitive skin. His hands are roaming under Harry’s shirt now, warming with every stroke over his back.
“So,” he says hesitantly, propping himself up and meeting Draco’s blurry gaze. “Do you. Did you. I mean. What do you…”
Harry smiles at him and pulls his hand back as the waiter brings over their dessert orders. “I do, but I like you more,” he says, flashing Draco his dimples and oh that is just

Leaning forward, he mouths at Harry’s balls, pulling his hips back for a better angle, then licks up slowly and thoroughly until he reaches Harry’s hole.

in your head when you’re speaking with me, or you’ll regret it.”
The thing is, Harry is firmly on Hermione’s side here, though he’d never say as much out loud. After the first blush of post-war had faded, Hermione became increasingly irritated with Ron’s, as she put it,
. Draco disagrees vehemently, as he finds Harry as endlessly fascinating as he had all through school, albeit with slightly different intentions these days, but he’s learned to pick his battles when it comes to Harry’s low self-esteem dressed up as humility.
By the time Harry steps through the Floo, feet dragging and dark circles pronounced, Draco’s sitting on the couch in his most expensive pair of trousers and his tightest shirt, the navy one Harry likes best. He’s got a glass of wine on the table in front of him for effect, but he hasn’t had a sip—he needs to be sober for this.
Harry climbs up onto the table and moves Draco’s legs up to his shoulders.

she? Bloody disturbing place, this; I wouldn’t be surprised if she got swept up in—Hermione! There you are. Look, we’ve found all the books from that list—now what?” His voice is painfully earnest, and Harry coughs into his sleeve to avoid a laugh.
Draco has a head for numbers. Draco is working very, very hard to atone for what happened during the War. Draco is the only reason the Ministry was able to identify and eliminate enough money pits to remain solvent and not have to make anyone redundant. Draco needs this job, and if it gets out that
“Why is he sending letters to
“Alright, Coach,” Harry says cheerily, plopping down onto one of the plush chairs Draco has on the other side of his desk and stretching his legs out. “What’s up? Did you want to talk about Roberts? I don’t know why he keeps drifting out of zone, it’s like he’s forgetting that when he’s on the short-hand side we don’t play man-to-man—I had a few thoughts on some exercises, actually, some ideas for two-on-one drills to help him understand, if you can get Quenneville to let us and one other person off an hour early tomorrow—”
Not soon enough, though; a bolt of purple light jets out from the stone just before the Stasis closes over it, and from the cry behind him, it’s hit Potter.
It’s been a few years since then, and Draco’s opened up a bit more, and Harry’s figured out
—to handle the cleanup efforts, and Hermione had been able to talk Ron out of charging headlong into getting involved, and the warm months in their bubble had been...healing, restorative in a way.
need to— Hey!” Ginny squirms and giggles, trying to throw an elbow into Harry’s stomach, but his grip is strong, and his fingers in her sides are merciless, and she finally sags back in his arms, out of breath and begging mercy.
It’s quiet in the room for a minute except for the sounds of their breathing, then finally,
But what Draco likes most of all? Harry’s
Draco’s face is pale, paler than normal—he’s almost chalk-white, and his lips are going blue, and the four puncture wounds in his neck are pumping blood still, but slowly, sluggishly, the thin streams at odds with the pool of blood spreading through the bedsheets and over Draco’s fine white silk shirt.
Ginny doesn’t notice, at first—she’s tired every day when she comes home from practice, and hungry,
Ginny thinks resentfully, as she’s fruitlessly digging through the front closet for her favorite jacket,
Draco’s eyes are flickering over his face again, and he breaks out into a small smile. “Well,” he says lowly, squeezing Harry’s arse once before stepping back and grabbing for the conditioner. “I was beginning to lose hope, you know; your Granger assured me you’d get there eventually, but if you took much longer, I was going to have to take drastic action. If I had known all it would take to get you going was flashing my tits, I’d have tried that months ago.”

Sinking back into Draco’s arms, Harry shrugs. “Dunno. You know how I feel about how your hair looks after you use that special...whatever it is potion. All shiny and curly. I can’t resist.”
Gin, seriously. You belong up there, and now everyone knows it.”
what we do next, then.”
It would almost be enough to make Harry wonder…
She sinks further into the bath, tipping her head back until just her nose is sticking out of the water.

If it makes Harry more comfortable to pretend it doesn’t have anything to do with the calendar, well, this is all about what Harry needs, so Draco is more than happy to accommodate.
about, Draco? Everyone does
Draco examines the vial in surprise. “...Thank you,” he says cautiously, uncorking it and sniffing before swallowing it down. Harry tamps down his irritation; he well remembers how paranoid Draco had been when they were...whatever they were, and he can’t imagine the intervening years spent locked up in his Manor’s lab has done much to change that.
Harry can’t look away. The silver barbells glint tauntingly at him, and his mouth waters, and suddenly Hermione’s snide little comments whenever he brings Draco up start to make sense.
“I would appreciate it if we could keep the discussion to the matter at hand,” Harry interrupts icily. He’s barely hanging on to control of his emotions—his magic is buzzing under his skin—and he’s drawing on the formality of a by-the-book Auror interview to keep himself together.
Draco, who had been working as assistant manager of Arizona’s team, whose own pro career had stalled out in the US after a poorly-aimed Bludger and an incorrectly-cast Stasis spell had left him with his left shoulder’s range of motion permanently restricted, woke up one morning to find himself in the unique position of the only Britain-born Quidditch coach familiar enough with the rules to be able to get a training programme started immediately. The offers poured in, and finally Puddlemere offered him a compensation package so staggeringly massive that he almost felt bad accepting—almost.
Draco’s voice is smug. “Well, of
Harry groans and barely stops himself from banging his head on the table. “I can’t stop thinking that if I’d done something when he sent me that first letter, none of this would be happening,” he admits. “If I had just gone over and
can begin to move on.
Harry keeps his eyes fixed on Draco. “No, we’re just fine. You’re such a good actor.”
“Sorry,” Harry squeaks, and Draco allows himself a private smile. Not nearly as much effort to get him to capitulate as Draco had feared, then. “I’m sorry, I swear I didn’t mean—”
it clearly was, dropping to his knees and fumbling with Draco’s trousers.
“Fuck, Harry,” Draco says lowly, hands roaming all over Harry’s back. “You’re so
works just as well when Harry’s not over his shoulder, frowning at his unwillingness to try harder with Muggle things.
“Fuck,” Draco pants, throwing his head back turning even pinker under Harry’s attention. “Harry, I—”
his bollocks and much less pleasant.
It had been enough then, even though she’d tried to pretend otherwise with Michael and Dean. It’s enough now. Maybe she’s never going to realise what it is she wants in time to appreciate it as it’s happening.
Draco’s not unfriendly, by any means. He can charm his way into any social circle, and out of any uncomfortable situation. He makes friends easily, socializes effortlessly, and genuinely enjoys being around people. He just
He drops their clothes on a chair and strides back over to the bed, pushing his pyjama bottoms off and bracketing Harry’s thighs with his legs. Harry leans back onto his elbows and watches with a dark gaze as Draco spells some lube onto his hands, then starts to stroke himself off.
“Yeah?” Draco pants, voice tight. He’s starting to sweat slightly, skin salty when Harry licks at his collarbone. “You’re going to
Harry glances back at Draco, who’s covering his groin with his hands and taking the scene in with wide eyes, and shrugs sheepishly. “Er...hey, Ron? You wouldn’t by any chance be back here to tell me that you’re moving back in with Hermione, would you?”
“I made the icing,” Draco rushes to interrupt, feeling the need to prove he isn’t
Hermione stands so fast she almost knocks a file off Harry’s desk. “Yes. Good
The book she’s been slowly making her way through is still on her bedside table, and the stairs are still quiet—no sign of Harry yet—so she picks it up, muffling a yawn with one hand. Maybe she’ll finally get past the part with all the people having a very polite argument in the foyer this time; she has

She maybe could have noticed sooner, but, well, they’re both adults, with their own lives, and anyway, who wants to be one of those boring couples that are so enmeshed that having a conversation with one is like speaking with both at once? Bill and Fleur are like that, sometimes, and it’s nauseating, and Ginny doesn’t want to be one of
“Oh, unclench, Malfoy; you love explaining this shit,” Potter says cheerfully, flicking his fingers at the shimmering barrier. It slowly dissolves into the air, and Draco manfully restrains a shiver as Harry’s magic flows back over them, task completed.

Draco considers his options. He’s out of sugar and vanilla extract now, so he’d have to run to the shops for more, but at this point, he’s not sure he’ll
Draco’s always been thin; even in those heady months after the war, when Harry was still a field Auror and Draco was a constant fixture at parties and events, when they first started circling around each other, Draco was long and lanky, made up of lines and angles. His chin has always been too pointy and his cheekbones too pronounced, his eyes too big for his brow. But he’d been
they’re going to the places they go, but having something to do is bringing the light back to his eyes.
“I don’t know Harry at all any more,” Ron replies quietly, and Draco feels a curl of regret at his snappishness.
Potter’s eyes darken, and he takes Draco’s finger into his mouth, licking far more than is needed to get the icing off, then pulling off with a long, slow suck. Draco’s panting by the time his finger is free again.
Going places with Harry these days is an exercise in frustration and patience.
your research, Malfoy; no more of this coy holding back!” she directs towards Harry’s office.
Draco laughs at that, and something in Harry settles at the sound.
Luckily, Harry knows Draco’s body better than he knows his own, and he’d stopped immediately, and they’d taken a break for a few weeks to talk over exactly what went wrong, and why, and how they’d proceed. Harry had been distraught, had gotten as far as saying he’d never scene with Draco again before Draco was able to talk him down.
Harry steps out of his office and strides to Christopher’s desk. He doesn’t bother shutting the door—there’s no point now. “And how,” he hisses, “did they find out that Mr Malfoy was in for an interview? Was it perhaps the same way they’d found out about the manner of death from the last murder scene?
idea why Parvati recommended this, it’s hideously dull.
What occurred after
He’s going to be late, there’s no doubt about that at this point, but he still hurries through his shower, hustling back out into the locker room while clutching his towel around his waist and trying not to slip in his shower sandals.
Draco sighs. “Is it the orgasm, or are you always this eloquent in the mornings?” His tone is fond, and he doesn’t bother to try and disguise that.
The other side of the booth is silent for a moment.
“As if. He loves you. If your antics last Christmas weren’t enough to make him cross with you, nothing is. And I’ll wear you down one of these days, Draco; you may as well stop resisting!” This last bit is shouted out the room as Draco makes his way down the stairs.

Harry snorts despite himself, tipping back the last of his drink and catching the waitress’ eye, holding his glass up. She blushes, but nods at him, and as she heads back to the bar he lets his eyes wander down her
“Ugh,” Harry says, pulling up the hem of his shirt to wipe his forehead. Draco chokes, and Harry absently floats one of the water bottles kept cold on the shelves near the door towards him. “I’m disgusting. Think I’m going to hit the showers; what time is it?”
It’s a good afternoon.
I did it. It looked like the Stone. It
Malfoy sighs, then grasps Harry’s elbow firmly. “I’ve already said it once, Potter—I don’t take drunk straight men to bed, not even ones who think they want to try something out. If you still feel this way tomorrow, we can talk.”
Harry ends their duel by freezing Draco’s hands above his head, then strolling over and plucking his wand out of his fingers. He waggles it in front of Draco’s face with a smirk, jumping back and hastily cancelling the spell when Draco kicks out at him.
She knows that Ron’s spoken to him, Hermione too, but they had very firmly landed on
Draco looks fragile like this, in a way he never does normally, not even when he’s asleep. There are always lines between his eyebrows and a slight downturn to his mouth when he sleeps, as if he’s wrestling with important philosophical questions in his dreams. Harry’s teased him about it in the past, but now he finds himself struck by the smooth absence of any expression at all on Draco’s face, by how truly lifeless he looks even though Harry knows he still breathes, can hear his heartbeat, even as faint as it is.
“No, we want to keep it cool until the cake is out of the oven; we’ll bring it out about 15 minutes before we’re ready to frost, to make sure it’s easy to work with, and I’ll try it then. I’m sure it’s great.” Potter shuts the refrigerator and smiles at Draco, that small, special one Draco’s never seen him direct towards anyone else. “Now. Shall we get started?”
smirking down at him with his arms folded and that fucking eyebrow halfway to his hairline, it’s hard for Harry to keep his cool.
you can’t; look at me.” He swishes his hair over them, tickling the back of Harry’s neck with the strands.
-amplified voice booming across to the players, who turn and straggle back to midpitch, wearily reforming their lines.
“Oh, fuck,” the man says, and yes, that’s Draco’s voice—Harry would know it anywhere.
Harry scrambles over to kneel between his legs, mouthing at the outline of Draco’s cock through the thin material of his joggers. He moves back and pulls them down, then glances slyly up at Draco. “I’ll let you get away with this tonight; don’t expect to get away with much else, this week,” he says, and his voice is a dark promise, and Draco shivers even as he puts his head to the back of Harry’s head and pushes him down.
They’ve figured it out, then. Whatever

Harry shrugs and nudges Ron out of the way just in time as one of the magical resorting carts barrels down the aisle. “You don’t like it when I’m blunt with you about this, so I’m not going to say anything as I don’t want to row here—this library creeps me out. But, you know what I think about all of this.”

“I...think I’d rather leave it,” he says hesitantly, looking up at Harry through his lashes. “Just for the night, I mean. Will that stuff still work in the morning?”
Harry straightens his glasses and raises an eyebrow. Draco hates that he learned to do that. “Alright, Malfoy, I’ll give it to you—this looks a fair step up from where they’d probably had us booked.”
It had started innocently enough a few years ago, when they began running into each other at Andromeda’s and decided that it would be easier to just

Draco’s teeth are dust in his mouth. He blows the whistle once more and watches as his players groan into motion.
“Yeah,” Draco says, rubbing his thumb over Harry’s sign-off.
Draco shivers, now, remembering the look in Harry’s eye, the dangerous lilt to his voice, and frowns down at the recipe book. He has to

Even as he prepares to Apparate, though, he can’t help but wonder what gave him away this morning. Is Harry that familiar with what he sounds like when he’s asleep?

Harry’s face-down on his bed with a pillow under his hips that he’s rutting into. He’s got a sheen of sweat over his back, and he’s working a dildo in and out of his arse, and he’s so noisy that Draco’s shocked he hasn’t broken through the Silencing charms he’s draped his room in.

Soon, his trousers and pants are around his ankles, and Draco’s leaning back against the counter, white-knuckling the edge in an effort to not thrust, as Potter grips his thighs and takes his cock down into his throat.
She has comments about Draco Malfoy, certainly; none she’ll make to the press, of course.
Draco certainly likes his wandless magic, if the goosebumps he gets whenever Harry casts are any indication. Something about the smell, he’s said before—Harry hadn’t really been paying attention.
“No, I… No. It’s just. I like...knowing that you’re happy with what I’m doing. I like

“Oh, Ron, thank you. The study tables are just down this aisle here—can you put them on the biggest table still open? Harry, you too, but then I’ll need one of you to come back and help—I still have some more that I need to track down, and I’ll need someone taller.” Hermione peers hopefully in Ron’s direction.
Sighing, Draco abandons his clever wordplay and lays his cards on the table. “I can’t do it, Potter. I got the icing but I can’t make this sodding bloody
Draco snorts. “Hardly

“It’s in here, isn’t it?” Potter asks quietly, crossing his arms and leaning against the far wall as Draco slowly steps in. “You look ill.”
Potter smothers a chuckle and elbows him slyly. Draco closes his eyes and counts to five. “Too right, Draco. Well, shall we? Want me to take down the main ward, so you can do that...smell thing you do?”
this would be a waste of time—and send them home with a warning to return immediately if symptoms worsen, and a suggestion that perhaps Potter shouldn’t be alone until it wears off as they’re hoping it will.
Draco takes a seat across from Harry, tugging at his jacket—a sure sign that it’s been resized imperfectly for the build of whoever he’s impersonating right now.
“Bloody hell,” Potter groans, standing and pressing down on the impressive bulge in his trousers. “The bloody cake needs frosting now. Come on, Malfoy; let’s go see if this icing is as good as you claim it is.”
The vibrations increase suddenly, and Harry’s mind brushes over his own, a command that couldn’t be clearer if it were spoken aloud, and Draco screams and comes all over the floor.
Ginny takes a deep breath and turns to the next section, scanning over the League scores from the weekend games, switching her focus to points calculations for the table standings.

Some days she feels fine. Some days she hurts so badly all she wants to do is cry. Some days she wants to Apparate back to Grimmauld and scream until Harry’s skin peels off and he’s begging for forgiveness.
“Oh, come off it, Malfoy, everyone knows that the closest thing you get to a shag is those bloody
He rubs his cock over Harry’s face again, breath shortening as Harry’s tongue darts out to lick over the shaft whenever he can.
It couldn’t last, though.
Ron, inexplicably, flushes. “Ah. Well, you know. I was up quite late, and you know I don’t sleep in very well any more. I’ll likely need a nap soon, actually.” Hermione makes a small squeaking sound at that.
Sighing, Draco looks conspicuously at his watch, then slouches against the doorframe and crosses his arms when that elicits no reaction. He’s not

him? That’s on an entirely different level; watching Draco’s eyes as his focus narrows in on Harry to the exclusion of everything else, feeling the whisper of his spellcasting an instant before it bursts forth from his wand, smelling the honey-and-sugar scent of his magic in the air… Well. It’s some of the most fun Harry has these days.

Harry always showers early; Draco’s known this, vaguely, abstractly, through the damp walls of the showers in their shared rooms on missions, the partly-used toiletries, the towel already hanging to dry by the time Draco wakes. Normally, though, the bathroom is in a separate room, Harry and his wet, naked body safely tucked away, out of sight.

Scrubbing his hand over his face, Draco snatches the cookbook and beats a tactical retreat into the sitting room to read the recipe again. It’s mid morning, and Teddy’s party is in six hours, and he’s
“I’ve never had to get a man drunk prior to taking him to bed, Weasley, and
The man clearly hasn’t noticed Harry; he’s got a towel wrapped around his waist, barely hanging on as he fiddles with his lock. His shoulders are hunched up and tense, and Harry’s about to ask if he’s alright when the towel slips to the floor.
Harry’s under the showerhead, rinsing shampoo from his curls, and he barely starts when Draco opens the glass door and slips in. He watches as Draco gently takes the conditioner from him and pours it over his hands, then obediently turns and lets Draco rub it in.
Draco smiles up at him, pulls him closer, and just as Harry’s leaning in for another kiss flips them, pushing Harry off the bed as he goes.
“Grand,” mutters Malfoy, getting to his feet and showily straightening his trousers. “Let’s go then, Weasley. The sooner this is over the better, frankly—ideally, I’ll have you out of my house by morning, and I can spend Sunday drinking away this entire ghastly affair and still be able to attend my obligations Monday morning.”
“Of course I do.” Draco fidgets, adjusting the straps of his bag on his shoulder. “Harry...I know you must be absolutely furious with me. I don’t blame you a single bit if you never want to speak to me again, and if that’s the case I’m happy to restrict our interactions to written communications unless it cannot be avoided for the sake of a patient. But...if you’re willing to give me another chance, if you’re willing to hear me out...I’ve got a lot more I need to say to you. I think we have a lot more we need to say to

implies that they have a routine, or that Harry was waiting for him; obviously neither of those things are true, but the fact remains that it’s halfway through Harry’s shift and he hasn’t gotten so much as a memo from Psych yet.
“God fucking damn it, Draco,” Harry moans, and he’s naked between one blink and the next, tackling Draco back onto the bed and kissing him desperately. “Thank
And then there’s the matter of his wager with Potter.
Harry doesn’t say anything.
Finally, Harry’s run out of tasks, and he’s sure that by now Draco’s long since cleared out, so he packs up and heads to Third Space.

really, way to sound
Well. Sometimes Draco knows Harry’s eyes are on him (something he learned in sixth year, and he’s never quite been able to shake how it feels), and it’s not because they’re on a stakeout, and it’s not because they’re passing theories back and forth at work, and he’ll keep his head bowed as he writes up his report, or he’ll continue his laps around the training facility, or whatever it is he’s doing, and wonder

Malfoy purses his lips and leans back in his chair. Annoyingly, he looks good—better than Harry, frazzled and exhausted, probably does right now—clothes perfectly neat, hair loose and swept over his forehead, forearms strong where he’s got them crossed in front of him, sleeves rolled up.
” drawls an exceptionally irritated-sounding voice from a few tables down. “Potter, as
But now, he pushes his way into the locker room and heads straight for the showers like he’s there every day, and Harry can only follow along, mind working furiously.
“Good,” Draco murmurs, shifting a bit as he watches Harry move about the room and his cock hardens in his trousers. He doesn’t have pants on underneath, and he knows by the end of this there will be a wet spot visible, and he daydreams a little about Harry sucking him off through the fabric.

Hermione sighs while Ron muffles a laugh into his glass. “Well, it’s only, Pansy never said anything to me about him coming back—I thought he was pretty well-established and happy in Oslo?”
Harry sighs and adds more time to the bike. He’s clearly got more than enough energy to burn today.
to be together, so why bother with this whole break thing at all?”
He eventually finds it, carelessly dropped behind an armchair in the corner of the room where he’d no doubt flung it in their frantic, hasty lust as they came in from their dinner-date, and as he strides back over to the bed he fumbles it, nearly drops it, still on a high from Draco’s blood.
That policy, Draco thinks dazedly as he lets Harry’s bedroom door shut behind him, may have to be revisited.
He’d never gone
“And I wouldn’t blame you,” Ron says heartily, nudging Harry with the stack of books. “Now, where
—through that.
Harry’s arse was already so incredibly tight that Draco was seeing stars the minute he got himself all the way in, but the squeeze from his orgasm is enough to send Draco over the edge too. “Oh my god,” he slurs, slumping over Harry’s back and thrusting a few more times, riding his orgasm out.
Reaching around, Draco gropes over Harry’s trousers before undoing the fly and pushing them to Harry’s ankles, then drops to his knees and kneads at Harry’s arse.
“—isn’t
that, it’s clear Harry hadn’t even heard him come in (and how could he, god, those sounds are going straight to Draco’s cock), but he feels frozen to the ground, and then Harry’s head twists out from the pillow and he chokes out “
Ginny knows it’s not just for work, not just for this stupid
He is also, Draco was
He’s not sure he could describe how it feels if he were asked, and he’s glad that Harry’s not demanding that of him for this; all he knows is that the patterns slowly looping over his body are lulling him better than any attempt at hypnosis, any Divination class in that small, stuffy, overperfumed tower room. He’s slipping down fast, faster than normal, and part of him wonders at that, that the thing he’s been frightened of for so long is bringing him peace so swiftly, but he’s too blissed-out to really consider it for too long.
Training camp is a massive success, and Ginny comes back home with a three-year entry-level contract and a guaranteed place on the Gorgons’ starting roster next season. At camp, nobody had asked her questions about Harry and Ron and Hermione; at camp, nobody told her how lucky she was to have caught
It’s long minutes before they separate, and Harry’s smile is incandescent. “Tea?” he asks, rolling off to Draco’s side and stretching.
“And with…” Harry isn’t sure he wants to know the answer to his question; isn’t sure he even has the right to ask.

Christopher shrinks back. “N-Nobody, sir! I swear it! I didn’t tell a single soul; I learned after last time!”

“It was incredible.
Harry leans down and kisses Draco so gently his heart breaks. “Even if it were against the rules, I don’t care,” he whispers into Draco’s ear. “I’ve wanted you for so long. I thought you knew and were just letting me down gently, but I couldn’t stop myself from…”
He winds his arms around Harry’s waist and tucks Harry’s head into his neck, rocking them slowly and whispering “it’s alright, you did so well, I love you” in a repeating mantra as Harry cries and cries, his whole body shaking with the grief he can’t let out during the day.
Draco hasn’t seen Harry’s cock before, despite all the spaces they’ve shared over the years, and as he stares at the sole of Harry’s foot pressed up against the frosted glass, watching his toes flex, it strikes him that it’s incredibly wrong, that he’s seeing something so terribly vulnerable, something soft and normally hidden away, without having seen the rest. Without having

Harry chuckles beside him as they make their way up to the entrance. “Truly, your sacrificing nature is an example to us all. Really, though, this place is fantastic; it looks like something out of a novel.”
It’s probably for the best.
He pushes Draco’s shirt up, sliding his palms along Draco’s stomach and chest, cupping his pecs. “You look so good,” he says, pinching Draco’s nipples just a little too hard to get him squirming between Harry’s thighs. “I love your chest. I love how red you get.” He ducks his head to worry at Draco’s collarbone with his teeth, shoving the shirt the rest of the way over Draco’s head and throwing it behind the sofa. Harry loves seeing his marks on Draco later, loves watching Draco fuss and scold in the mirror as he arranges his shirts to cover them.
“Yes, it almost is,” Draco agrees, mind flying ahead to the next time he and Harry have leave scheduled.
“Ron, no!” Harry cries, turning back around and grabbing for his wand, but it’s too late—a flash of silver magic throws him back as Ron’s words mix with the heavy ambient magic in the library and trigger—
Draco sniffs. “Of course I do, but

Finally, Draco rolls over to look at his watch, still sitting on his nightstand, and groans. “We’ve missed breakfast, and the event’s long started by now.”
He tried to talk about it, but like everything related to their sex life in those early days, Draco got defensive and shy, so Harry resolved to just try things out and keep his eyes open.

Finally, they reach the largest study, up on the second floor, and Draco has to stop and take a deep breath before entering the room. Potter hadn’t detected anything dangerous inside, but the stone is off-kilter with all its curses being systematically removed, and it’s enough to make Draco nauseated even behind his shields.

Sure enough, almost as soon as Harry has the thought, Christopher is knocking and popping his head through the office door. “Auror Potter, sir? Your, er. Your
Harry pauses, genuinely shocked. Draco sends him a quick, searching glance as they exit the ward room, but before Harry can say or do anything else, Draco turns to sign them out, then hustles down the hall to the locker rooms.
Draco tries to sit up, but can’t, because
Ginny wakes up the next day in a puddle of sunshine. The other side of the bed is still undisturbed.

Potter’s close, that much is clear by his panting breaths and the flush rising on his face, and when Draco puts his mouth next to Potter’s ear and whispers “I can’t wait to feel this inside me,” he comes so hard he staggers on his feet and almost falls.
The ten days had been spent in conditioning and drills sunrise to sunset, and they hadn’t even been allowed newspapers, which is why she’s so shocked when she steps out for pastries the morning after she gets back (Harry still passed out in bed at home, the scratches down his back red in the soft morning light—she’d missed him, after all) and is confronted by a reporter shoving a Quotes Quill in her face and peppering her with questions,
“I’m going to restrain you,” Harry continues in the same soft voice, stepping forward and drawing Draco’s arms back, clicking the cuffs around his wrists. The leather is buttery-soft, and Harry has them just tight enough so that Draco can feel them, but that they won’t leave marks; Draco despises marks the next day that don’t come from Harry’s hands or mouth.
Hermione nods slowly. “You’re right. He was shocked at first, of course, but really, at the end there...I’m surprised at how maturely he was handling it, all things considered.”
Draco ignores the curl of—of
Breaking the kiss off, Malfoy curses and nips Harry’s neck when Harry squeezes. “Fuck, Potter,” he pants, licking over the stinging bitemark. “You

“...fine,” Malfoy says, cautiously following Harry in and primly sitting opposite him.
the only word he can consistently come up with these days is

He fiddles with some paperwork for the next hour or so, reading through the field Aurors’ reports and leaving far more notes than he usually does. He’s procrastinating his final review of the case files before Draco comes in, he knows it, but he can’t help it.
Harry sighs, and then when that doesn’t elicit the reaction he was looking for, sighs again more loudly, adding in a despairing shoulder slump.
“Well, that’s why I’ve asked you in,” Harry says carefully, pushing his files about on his desk to give his hands something to do. “It’s true that there are certain…
“No, I swear, it was a coincidence, I came here because Blaise recommended it—I saw you in the locker room the first day, and I was never going to come back, I

When Harry’s due home, he heads to the bedroom, lowering the lights and spelling the temperature up a degree or two, then strips and lounges back against their mass of pillows, idly stroking his cock and playing with his arse, waiting for Harry.

Now, with his full attention to the weird shapes, Harry watched as their ink moved, seemingly eager to spread itself through the blank pages. Hesitant, Harry reached over and ran a tentative finger onto the page, only to watch bewildered as the ink began following his touch. It was an odd — somewhat disturbing, somehow
Harry needed a new approach if he wanted to see the face of someone other than Didi’s, so he chose to stay away from the Malfoy’s doorstep for a full week. He used this time to gather his thoughts and even sleep a little, because his obsession over this case was killing his sanity, slow and painful. He didn’t want to give the press a new reason to stick their nose into his business any more than they already did.
, he hadn’t signed up for this. The moment he found the correct page again, Harry blinked and, for a second, he had to muse whether keeping the thing might take a toll on his own sanity, because the blank pages with black corners were no more, and, in their place, he found rows and rows of Malfoy’s elegant handwriting.
. Harry squinted as he peered through his fringe and let out a snort before he could stop himself, at the sight of the reports that one of the two Aurors was holding. He ducked his head and began pressing down the tip of the quill a little harder than necessary, when the two turned to glance at him at the sound, and felt them stare at him for a moment, before returning to their discussion and moving away from Harry’s door.
Harry heard the Auror standing by the door snort at the mention of Harry’s argument with Malfoy, but he ignored him. Since the start, the man had done little to nothing to hide his annoyance for being assigned to Malfoy’s case. He’d gone as far as hinting that Harry may have done something to the blonde, saying
Harry smiled and took it gratefully. He took a long sip from the cup and sagged back against his chair, the blissful liquid warmth pooling in his stomach.
of the Malfoys during their trial. Honestly.
"Is this what— is this where he'd been all this time?" he asked, throat impossibly tight and tongue dry.
“And, of course, he cursed and blamed me a lot for some reason,” Harry shrugged, “before the accident, I haven’t even talk to him properly since the trial. I don’t know why he’d have to blame
Harry scratched the back of his head as he thought, “honestly, he just sounded really bitter, about how monotone and repetitive his mornings had turned to.”

. Magic poured out of it in strong waves, and Harry could not explain how he had not noticed it the moment he stepped into the room. Heck, he guess he could have felt it even from the moment he had stepped out of the lift. "What have you done?" Harry all but demanded, pinning Malfoy with another accusing glare, "a

after—all the light, all the fierce joy Harry’s delighted in for months now whenever they argued, had dropped out, leaving him looking pale and miserable.
“Fuck,” he says quietly, but it must have been loud enough to cut through whatever fog Harry’s in, because his head whips around and he stares at Draco, eyes huge and hazy, whimpers of pleasure still dripping from his lips as they watch each other from across the room.
As team captain and the prized pony in Puddlemere’s star-studded stable, Potter is in every promotional spot and every carefully-scripted ‘spontaneous’ behind-the-scenes broadcast. He attends all the charity events, he takes on the yeoman’s share of media responsibility on game days, and his face and number are

He’s got more of a purpose, now—the trials are starting soon, and he’s given all his statements, and now the Ministry is asking him to attend events, for fundraising and awareness and Merlin only knows what, Ginny’s having a hard time keeping track
Draco closes his eyes and sits back. His face is drawn, haggard with lines that weren’t there just a few years back. “So I did it to myself, yet again,” he says hollowly.
“Potter,” he calls, unable to look away from the stone. “Are you alright? Anything serious?”
Ginny’s
are you trying to tell me something?”
The alarm goes off with a twiddle of Potter’s fingers, and they look at each other for another minute before they both start laughing.
He’s about to call out his address when Draco’s hand, cool and dry and achingly familiar, curls into his own. Harry flashes back to that hand skimming over his hips, those fingers twisting inside him, and he shivers hard.

The papers are just—Mum doesn’t let them in the house any longer, and Bill had to add extra wards around the property to keep the Howlers out, and Ginny doesn’t try to go anywhere in Wizarding London after the first two tries, not even with her brothers.
Snapping his fingers, Harry summons over a pot filled with a deep purple ointment. “It’s a healing salve,” he explains, unscrewing the cap and tilting it for Draco to see. “It’s for the marks...if you lie back down I’ll take care of it for you.”
When he gets home, the candles in the living room are lit, and the house smells like vanilla—Draco’s been baking, then. Harry smiles, tosses his bag onto the closest end-table, chucks his jacket on the couch, and leaves his shoes haphazard near the fireplace. He’ll deal with it later.
He really, really hates the seesaw of sensations working with Potter always puts him through.

Harry makes a harsh sound around his cock, and the tears flow free, rolling unchecked down his cheeks. Draco moves his hands so he’s holding the sides of his face, so he can rub the tears into Harry’s skin.
Draco’s silent as Harry opens the door and lets them into their room. The moonlight is streaming in through the window, and Draco crosses to open it, breathing in the outdoor air and attempting to sober up a bit.
“Maybe he missed the glorious English sunshine,” Ron suggests, peering at the Charmed window near the front of the room, which shows the rain pattering down on the streets above. “Merlin knows he could use it.”

Hermione had been there for that last one, and she’d looked at Ron with pride and...unfortunately, no small amount of what Harry was forced to acknowledge as lust. She’s been one of the worst offenders in trying to dig for details, frankly, and since she’s been around a lot more, Harry is almost always in earshot whenever Ron accidentally drops new information.
is he so good at this? Harry winds his arms around Malfoy’s torso and drags his hands down until he reaches Malfoy’s arse, which feels just as good as it had looked perched on his desk at the office earlier that week.
They don’t do this very much. Harry would probably like to pretend it’s random, but Draco knows better. For the last five years, twice a year—once as spring warms into summer, once after the autumn chill has fully set in—Harry’s let Draco know it’s time, and he needs it again.

and both departments have benefited; Emergency’s paperwork has never looked better since Malfoy started sending forms back with red ink corrections, and Psych’s intake process time has halved since Harry taunted Malfoy for being slower than a Flobberworm at check-ins.
Draco himself has been hard since Harry agreed to try this, and his cock is straining against his boxer-briefs. He palms himself briefly, then steps closer to Harry, tilting his chin up.

And, Ginny's sad, of course she is, but— She looks around the dinner table, breaking eye contact with Ron for the moment. She's got Mum and Dad, and Bill and Charlie, and Percy now, and even George when he's able. But Harry? Harry's never had anyone; no person he could call his own until he turned eleven, got on a train, and met Ron and Hermione. She thinks about him sitting at home alone in the dark of Grimmauld Place and her heart clenches, and she catches Hermione's eye and nods firmly, once. Hermione smiles weakly back and leans over to whisper in Ron's ear, and the two of them quietly leave out the front door. Ginny doesn't listen for the pop of Apparition.
He’s just scrubbing at his scalp and sternly talking himself down when Draco interrupts him.

After a minute, Potter laughs ruefully to himself and pulls back, staggering a bit until he gets a hand on the back of Draco’s chair. Draco watches as he takes a few deep breaths, then rolls his neck and walks back around to the other side of the desk.
Finally, Malfoy manages to corner him at the bar, mouth turned down. “Potter, are you okay? Really, if me being here bothers you so much, I can leave...I just thought, well, maybe, since Ron and I—”

what I meant,” Potter huffs out, shifting from foot to foot. Draco doesn’t have time for his strop, though, because he’s slowly peeling the wood back bit by bit, biting his lip with the effort it takes to not disturb the stone itself. It’s aware of them now, and the buzz echoing around his head is almost unbearable.

Harry lets him do this. “I’ll have you know that this is
Ron is still not-so-discreetly trying to get a look at Malfoy’s work, edging closer to the table as he talks, Hermione’s books forgotten. Harry rolls his eyes and, after nodding brusquely at Malfoy, turns on his heel and goes back to find Hermione, doing his best to ignore his embarrassing friend, though his best efforts can’t block out Malfoy’s loud grousing.
Draco had headed straight home, after that—no point in going back to the office, he’s not getting anything done today anyway. He calls for takeaway and puts the food under stasis in the kitchen, then wanders their home, straightening the shelves and spelling away any dust that may have settled.

Harry glances down; the black-and-red snake he got a few weeks after Ginny went in for her piercings is curled around his upper thigh, like usual, and he strokes it briefly to set it squirming and crawling along his leg. “Yeah. Got it as an eighteenth birthday present to myself. I forgot you wouldn’t have known about it.”

Harry’s got the water running and is examining his shampoo options by the time Draco steps in; he’d clearly put his clothes through the Magi-Cleaner first, because there’s no sign of sweat stains and they’re back to their original state. He puts them on the shelves at the far end of the room, then saunters over and selects a shower just down the row from where Harry’s standing, jaw dropped, the shampoo bottles forgotten as they hover midair next to him.
Draco has to admit that the bathroom in this suite is clearly meant to evoke a

and I just can’t right now.”
He hates it.
“Potter,” he hisses, and when that doesn’t work, “Harry!” a bit louder.
Harry hustles after Ron, who’s determinedly making his way towards the tables. “Mate! She wanted

It’s horrible for a long, long time.

“Briefly,” Potter says, moving so they’re standing next to each other, looking up at the unassuming facade. Their shoulders brush. Draco subtly shifts to the side. Potter shifts with him. Their shoulders are still brushing. “Accidental magic from the kid set off some sort of nasty Dark shit, yeah? I didn’t realize there was one of the Old Homes in Bermondsey.”
Harry stares at her, perplexed. “I don’t...what are you talking about? Are you trying to hint at something, because I have to tell you, I’m really not up to puzzles at the moment. I keep thinking about what poor Ron has to do tonight, and...Merlin. At least
There’s silence while Draco shampoos his hair, and then Harry sighs. “You’re right. Of course, you’re right. But… Promise me you won’t avoid me, after we’re done here. We

side—she’d never told them what happened, would never share a secret of that magnitude that wasn’t hers, but Harry must have said something, because they spent Harry’s birthday at the Burrow, and today, the day they’d normally be on the train back to Hogwarts if they were still in school, Ron’s picking at his dinner and barely talking to anyone, and Hermione’s watching him worriedly.
Harry’s arm is moving faster now, and his head thunks back against the glass, and Draco holds his breath and strains his ears and knows exactly when he comes, hears the punched-out little sigh Harry bites out and sees his shoulders slump and the tight muscles in his back unlock.
“Yes, please,” Harry says, and Draco glances down, smiling a bit at how dark his eyes already are.
Draco palms at the outline of his cock over his joggers, and Harry drops his eyes directly to Draco’s groin, and that’s
; he’d tasted it and it was divine, a rich dark chocolate in the absolute perfect consistency. He’d wrapped the bowl carefully and set it in the refrigerator until the cake was ready for it.
Suddenly, Draco sits up. “Potter, wait—!”
Harry glances worriedly at the clock. It's coming around to noon, and there's still no sign of Ron. Hermione is twisting her hands next to him on the couch in the sitting room, where they’d expanded out his coffee table to accommodate the vast quantities of food they’d stress-cooked that morning.
His thrusts start slow, letting Harry get used to it, letting him move around until he’s able to position himself at the best angle to take Draco’s cock, but once Harry blinks up at him with a bit of a challenge in his eyes Draco stops showing him mercy.
this is utter bollocks. I’m going to the Ministry—I’ll have to put in for emergency leave, and register this with the Bonds division. Maybe someone there knows a counterspell.” He starts wobbling in the general direction of the door before pausing to turn and glare back at them. “Well? You have to come along too, Malfoy. I can’t exactly register a bond without you, can I. Tosser.”

“No,” Draco replies softly, leaning forward and kissing him. The kiss heats up quickly, and sooner than Harry thought was possible he’s getting hard again. Based on Draco’s wandering hands, he’s in the same state.

Of course, Harry has his own, less-savoury reasons for preferring Draco’s hair long.

Drool slides down the sides of Harry’s mouth, and his throat flutters and clenches around Draco’s cock. His face is flushed, and his lips already look swollen, and he’s moaning so much that Draco can

Now the sneaking serpent walks
Malfoy raises an eyebrow and unfolds himself from Harry’s sofa. “Fascinating,” he murmurs, peering out the door after Ron before turning and extending his hand. “Potter, Granger, it’s been...unforgettable. I’ll be sure to send you autographed copies of the next book in the series—I happen to know the author.” He winks, and Harry bangs his knee on his desk as he hastily stands up to accept Malfoy’s hand. His face feels hot, and he can practically feel Hermione rolling her eyes at him.

He crosses the room and snatches the spoon from Potter’s hand, then dips his finger into the icing and holds it in front of Harry’s mouth. “Did you want to try some?” he asks innocently.

“You— Oh, you know, you’re a

Well. Every
Draco pulls back and gasps in a breath. “Touch yourself,” he orders, and Harry’s hand flies down to his own cock. “I want to feel you come on my tongue.”
Draco wakes at his usual time the next day and immediately gropes for the second vial. He swallows it with a groan and lies perfectly still until it’s kicked in, then sits up gingerly and Summons a glass, filling it with water two separate times before he feels all the way back to normal.
Draco allows himself to laugh at that. “Oh, Harry,” he says fondly, tugging at the curls at the back of Harry’s neck. “Absolutely

“Excellent. Well, if you don’t mind...I’d rather we wait until you’re, er, back to yourself. Tea?”
Draco gets to his feet and crosses to their wardrobe, studiously focusing on picking out their outfits and ignoring the sounds he’s making as he fights to get himself under control.
He’s ashamed of himself. He shouldn’t have said what he did, he knew it as soon as it came out of his mouth. And Draco’s

Harry pushes back against the toy, whining and squirming, and Draco can’t look away. “Merlin, Harry, who knew you were such a fucking
The ward rooms—down a few floors and sideways from the DMLE, and only accessible with an Auror badge—are empty when they arrive. The trainees are out on a field exercise, and it’s late enough after lunch and too long until the end of the day for anyone else to be getting a session in.
Harry’s done a halfway decent job of putting it from his mind these past few years, but all the careful work he did to button his feelings about what happened
Now it’s Hermione’s turn to raise one shoulder. “Blind luck?” she offers wryly, and Harry laughs in spite of himself.
Draco paces to his office and seriously considers opening the emergency vodka he keeps stashed in his desk drawer, but before he can put that thought to action, Potter bursts in, clearly having taken the fastest shower of his life. His curls are damp against his neck, and water is dripping down from his hairline to wet the collar of his t-shirt. His joggers are worn and tight, and he’s got one of those horrific baseball caps clutched in one hand, which he tosses on the desk. Draco sneers at it—that was one fashion trend he avoided at all costs in the States.
