Before Harry could respond to that ridiculous idea, Madam Pomfrey returned and brought Harry a cup of tea too.  “Glad to see you are awake at last, Mr. Potter,” she chirped.
He could feel the hot gusts of Potters breath as he spoke. “Malfoy… what are you doing?” he whispered in confusion.
Harry wanted to tangle his fingers in the hair at Draco’s nape, but it still hurt too much to move, so he tried to put all of his emotion into kissing Draco back.  He parted his lips, and let his tongue dart out to lick Draco’s lower lip.  Draco made a soft sound and opened his mouth.  Harry pushed his tongue in to rub against his.
As he lay in the couch listening to his baby’s wails, he got angrier and angrier.  “Fuck this!” he thought.  Draco had helped to create their baby.  He had a responsibility to both Harry and Al, he could damn well step up and share in that.  Before he could think too much about what he was doing, he stood and picked up Al.  He grabbed her bag filled with extra nappies, clothes, and formula, and apparated them both to the middle of the Malfoy’s suite at the Wailing Wraith.
Harry fought against the need to push Draco down and cover his body with his own.  He held himself back and continued this tantalizing kiss.  Harry licked at Draco’s bottom lip, and then pressed their lips together again.  Draco made a small needy sound, and Harry brought his hands up to thread through Draco’s hair and hold him steady for a deeper kiss, but Draco grabbed his wrists and pulled his hands away.  Draco broke the kiss and sat back away from Harry.
After passing the bottle back and forth for several minutes, Malfoy spoke again.  “It’s just my luck to be partners with the Savior of the Wizarding World,” Malfoy groused.  “Why couldn’t you have been partners with Longbottom?  Then he would be cursed, not me.”
Harry pulled away before he could come.  He kissed a path down Draco’s chest, stopping at a nipple to lick and suck until he had him crying out.  Then he continued kissing and nibbling, following the trail of soft golden hair that led down to the waistband of the pajama pants Draco was still wearing.  When he reached the elastic, he licked along the edge purposely avoiding where Draco’s hard prick was almost pushing free.
Recognizing that he should keep Potter healthy since he needed his help, not because of any unrequited love on his part, Draco acceded to the elf’s request. “That will be fine, Dilly. You can bring the food, but bring the walking stick first.” Dilly popped away and back in a flash and handed the walking stick to Draco. Then she disappeared and again and returned this time with a large tea tray, piled high with sandwiches and pastries. “Thank you, Dilly,” Draco said and the little elf beamed with delight before popping away again. Potter’s stomach growled again and Draco pushed the tray towards him. “Eat up, Potter, before you perish from hunger.”
Harry walked away from Draco and went to stand by the door.  “No pain,” Harry said bluntly, not willing to talk about the emotional pain he was feeling.
“I am not certain,” Professor Thropwaite began, “but we need to get both of you to the infirmary right away.  Miss Parkinson, and Miss Bulstrode, would you please notify the Headmaster that he is needed in the infirmary, immediately?”
His smile grew even brighter and more malicious. “That’s easy, young Malfoy. One of you two must remain here, in hell.”
Harry wanted, he ached, and he needed Draco.  He needed more, but he wasn’t sure what it was.  He twisted himself around, the warm water helping his skin to slide over Draco’s.  Draco’s hands were still on his hips, but this time he was facing him.  Harry rested his hands on Draco’s shoulders to steady himself.
“The thought of falling asleep each night against your heart, and waking each morning in your arms . . .” Draco’s voice became rough and he paused to clear his throat.  “You . . . Atria Lily . . . our life together, it’s everything to me!  Yes, Harry.  Yes, I will marry you!”  Draco’s smile was so joyous, Harry felt tears prickling in his eyes.
They had gone three weeks like this, but Harry didn’t know how to change things.  Hermione kept advising him to just be patient, while Ron thought he should just grab Draco and snog the stuffing out of him.  This advice gave Harry an unwanted look into his best friends’ marriage.
“Yes, to your sister, and to me,” Harry folded him into a big hug.  Then he stood up and asked, “Where’s my daughter?  She needs to meet her big brother!”  He sat Teddy in the armchair and placed Atria in his lap.  “That’s it, Ted.  Make sure you hold her head up, she can’t do that by herself yet.”
Draco tightened his fingers around Harry and sped up his strokes, his fingers sliding swiftly over the velvety flesh.  “Come, Potter!  Come for me,” Draco demanded in a low voice.
“You have too many clothes on,” he pushed on Draco until he sat up, and then pulled his shirt off.  Draco’s nipples pebbled when exposed to the cool morning air.  “Kneel up,” he instructed and then when he did, he shoved Draco’s pajama pants down to his knees.  His hard cock sprang up, obligingly, right in Harry’s face.  Not one to miss an opportunity, he leaned forward and licked at the tip.  He swirled his tongue around, licking up all of the moisture that had leaked.  When he was satisfied he had gotten it all, he sucked the head into his mouth and laved at it some more with his tongue.  He tightened his hand around Draco’s cock and stroked its length.
With only the two of them remaining, the silence grew pronounced.  Draco shifted on his feet and rubbed his arms.
Before he could think of more words to defend himself, Dilly popped out and popped back in carrying one of Draco’s own shirts (dark green silk) and a soft warm cloak. She held both garments out to Potter who stuffed Draco’s parchment into his pocket before grabbing the green shirt.
“You better get used to ‘that racket’ because there is going to be a lot of that in your future,” Harry said, refusing to feel sorry for Draco.
Harry looked over to where Ron was leaning against the bed and holding his wife.  They both looked exhausted.  “Oh, sure, of course.  I’ll see you guys tomorrow,” Harry said as he followed the nurse out, with a sleeping Atria in his arms.
“Be that as it may, you both need to change and go to the Headmaster’s office.  He is waiting to speak to you,” she informed them.  She brought the screen back over but since the beds were now pushed together, there wasn’t room for it.  She placed it instead, perpendicular to the end of the beds.  Then she levitated their folded clothing and set them at the foot of the bed.
“Did you touch just the wand, or did you touch Mr. Malfoy?” the older wizard continued his questioning.
When the Healer left the room Draco deflated, curling into himself and letting the tears fall. Pansy sat next to him and once again held him in her arms. She stroked his hair gently and let him ruin her designer blouse.
Blaise threw his arm around Harry and gave him a side hug, “That’s great Harry!  We’ll have enough for our own Quidditch team in no time at all!”  Blaise’s joke seemed to break the tension and everyone was soon laughing and smiling.  Everyone but Malfoy, who was frowning and staring at Blaise and Harry.
Draco returned her hug briefly before straightening to face the healer once again. “And there is nothing to be done?”
“Shhhh!” Malfoy shushed him.  “We need to be quiet.”  Harry’s head spun as they went down the hall and into his old room, but he kept his mouth shut.  “Now . . . Blaise always keeps a well-stocked stash.”  He walked over to Blaise’s trunk and spelled it open.  Malfoy rummaged around and came up with a very large bottle of Firewhisky.  “Aha!” He held it up triumphantly.  Then he promptly dragged Harry back down to their room.
“What’s going on?  What do you ... ?” Draco sat up in confusion.  He pushed impatiently at the hair that fell into his face.  “What are you doing, Potter?”
“I did no such thing!” Malfoy fired back.  “You are the one who reached for my hand while I was still casting.”
Dilly tugged on her ear and her smile faltered for a moment before she spoke again. “Master Draco and Harry Potter and Harry Potter’s friend have been working in here a long time.”
“I realize it’s a bit messy,” Harry picked his way carefully across the debris-strewn room to lay his sleeping daughter down in the portable crib.
Normally a location he avoided like the plague, he had decided the dungeons would be the best place to cast the spell. It was already the most heavily warded place in the Manor and he planned to reinforce them. He went to the largest chamber and started casting all the protective charms he knew; anti-Apparition, shielding, and restraining.
“I – never wanted that,” Draco was still sitting stiffly, “but you don’t want me with you all night?”
Harry continued the movement of his hand, this time going lower to cup the soft skin of Draco’s arse cheek.  It fit perfectly in his palm.  Draco moaned some more and pressed his hardening cock against Harry’s hip.  “You feel so good,” he whispered.  Harry moved his fingers until the brushed along Draco’s crack, slowly, gently, back and forth until Draco whimpered and pushed his arse back toward Harry’s fingers.
“More to the point, are you up to it, Potter?” Draco asked with a smirk at Harry’s tented pajama bottoms.
Harry could hear Atria’s small cries as she woke up downstairs.  He knew, from much experience, if he didn’t tend to her soon they would turn into full-blown wails.  He thought he should take Draco with him and start showing him the ropes, so to speak.  He stopped, on his way downstairs, and knocked on Draco’s door.  Draco answered it quickly, and then just stood there waiting for Harry to speak.  Draco had taken off his suit jacket and tie and unbuttoned the top three buttons of his shirt.  Seeing Draco standing there looking so handsome turned Harry’s already tired brain into mush.  “I . . . uh, she’s waking up,” Harry jerked his thumb in the direction of the stairs, “I should, er . . . you know . . . show you what she, uh . . . needs, and stuff.”  Red in the face with embarrassment, Harry turned away and started downstairs without waiting to see if Draco was following.
“What . . . um . . . what changed?  I mean . . . why you didn’t want to stay before?” he finally asked.  Draco pulled away and flopped onto his back.  Harry knew he was fucking this up and he was afraid of scaring Draco off, but if he was going to fix things he needed to know what had gone wrong.
“Yeah, uh . . . yes, yes, I’ll get . . . isn’t it too early?  I mean, she’s not due yet,” Harry turned worried eyes to both Ron and Hermione.
Draco lifted a wine bottle and gestured toward Harry, “Wine, Potter?  Or would you prefer pumpkin juice?” Draco added sarcastically.
“Yes, go back,” Draco replied impatiently, embarrassed at having revealed too much to Harry. “You said Persephone! Well, that’s what happened to her.” This time he was the one who tried to pull his hand away, but Harry turned his hand and laced their fingers together.
Harry tossed and turned most of the night, uncomfortable sleeping so close to Malfoy.  He could hear every little sigh and rustle from the other bed.  His brain putting unhelpful images to each little sound.  They both awoke with pain in the middle of the night and instead of waking Madam Pomfrey, they just moved the beds together themselves.  Then they both turned on their sides facing away from each other, to fall into a restless sleep.
Draco couldn’t think… he couldn’t breathe…his mind screaming for Harry. Crack! Granger’s palm snapped Draco’s head back violently but at least he could catch his breath now. Draco looked blankly up into her face and she demanded, once again, to know where Harry was.
“OK,” Harry said his shoulders slumped and his tone defeated.  “When can we . . . I mean, when will I see you?”
“Who?” the question burst out of Harry before he could stop it.  Everyone swung their gaze from Draco to Harry, like they were watching a Muggle tennis match.  Harry felt he needed to clarify what he meant.  “Who . . . who are you in love with?
Draco had been in the kitchen making tea and fussing with their Muggle toaster, in a way that never failed to make Harry laugh.  Except it didn’t this morning.  Harry had woken up again alone, bed empty, and tears had filled his eyes.  Was this his life now?  This half empty existence.  He had wearily walked downstairs to the kitchen, and found Draco there, fully dressed, making breakfast.
Hi everyone, I hope you can forgive me for not updating sooner.  I have not abandoned this story, RL just got in the way.  I hope you will enjoy this chapter - it's pure fluff.  Harry kind of took over in the middle of the chapter, so I blame it all on him.  C-
“No, that’s just babies,” Harry chuckled.  “With each of us taking turns, we should be able to get close to six hours of sleep!”
Harry threw his head back, a steady stream of “fuck yes,” “don’t stop,” and “please, Draco” falling from his lips.  He thrust his hips as hard as he could, rocking into Draco’s thigh.
Draco didn’t answer right away. Instead, he reached over, cupped Harry’s cheek and caressed it with his thumb.  “Because I want to.”
“The distance needed to remain pain free may lessen and lessen,” Bill said quietly.  When he saw Harry’s confusion, he clarified, “You may need to physically touch at all times.”
Draco’s hands stroked Harry’s back and then moved down to cup his ass, then they moved up again grasping and squeezing.  When he started roughly drawing Harry’s shirt from his trousers, Harry realized his romantic plan was being derailed.  He pulled away from Draco and stood up quickly.  Then he reached down and pulled Draco up with him.  “Not yet, Sweetheart.  We have important business first,” Harry laughed softly.
Harry slowly pulled himself together, disappointment crushing him as he came crashing down rudely from his orgasm.  It had felt so good to come with Draco’s touching him.  He had thought they were making progress, but Draco had pulled back again and Harry didn’t know where they stood.
“Fine, fine.  Whatever,” Harry replied his mind solely focused on reaching Draco as quickly as possible.  Once they were outside, Ron apparated them to the front of St. Mungos.  And then Harry was barreling inside, pushing his way carelessly through the crowd, heedless of the complaints and objections he left in his wake.
“I fucking love you, Draco,” Harry whispered bringing their lips together for a slow deep kiss, filled with love and promises and the future.
His attention was drawn back to Dumbledore when he resumed speaking, “Luckily, most of your classes are already the same.  Harry, you will need to join Draco for his Arithmancy class.  And, Draco, you will join Harry when he tutors the first years in flying.”  Malfoy’s startled gaze swung over to Harry, at Dumbledore’s last statement.
Harry decided Draco could find out for himself that he would soon be doing anything and everything he could to stop their daughter from crying.  He showed Draco how to prepare Al’s bottle, and then how to change her nappy.  When he first started, Draco had pulled out a small notebook and was taking copious notes.  Harry would give anything to get a glimpse of Draco’s notes on how to change a nappy, he was sure they would be hilarious.
While Draco went to get the baby, Harry hurried around to gather the things he thought they would need.  When Draco returned with Atria Lily he found a quilt spread out in the dappled shade.  The wireless was brought outside and playing some soft music.  A small basket of baby toys was on the corner.  There was a platter of cheese, crusty bread, sliced apples and grapes all under a stasis charm.  And a chilled bottle of champagne rested in a silver ice bucket.
Harry slid his hand from Draco’s mouth to his cheek and gradually turned his face toward his own.  “Open your eyes, Baby,” he urged.  Draco’s eyes fluttered open and he found himself looking into stormy grey eyes.  “Don’t be scared.  It’s just us!  And we are so good together,” Harry moved as he was talking, so he ended up lying between Draco’s legs, with his arms propped on his forearms.  His right hand carded gently through his pale blond locks.  Draco kept his eyes open this time, and Harry could see so many emotions swirling there.  Too many for him to read.  Harry glided his left hand down Draco’s arm and rested it atop his hand, which was still clutching the bedding.
“Yes . . . I wanted nothing more than to stay there with you . . . forever.  But I was trying not to become too attached to you.”  Draco’s voice deepened and ended with what sounded like a sob.
The Healer looked taken aback, whether by the outburst or his patient’s marital status it wasn’t clear.  “My apologies,” he said smoothly.  “Are you able to speak, Mr. Potter-Malfoy?”
“You seem to be doing all right.  You got her to stop crying and go to sleep, and I hadn’t been able to do that for the last four hours,” Harry said as he remained sprawled in the chair across from Draco.
He squirmed in his seat, but Harry did not move away. “No, that’s not what I mean… it wasn't because of your mother.” Harry looked up and met Draco’s gaze again. “It’s um… it’s because of how I feel.”
Harry opened his eyes to look lovingly down at the tousled blond hair tickling his cheek.  Merlin, he loved this man!  It had been three years since Draco had come into his room at St. Mungo’s and pretended to be his boyfriend, and those had been the happiest years of his life.  When he had temporarily lost his memory, his attraction to Draco had been overwhelming, and it hadn’t taken them long to make the “pretend relationship” a real one.
With one step, Harry found his left side plastered up against a wet, naked, Draco.  Both men froze.  Harry could feel Draco’s cock against his hip, and it was filling out and getting harder the longer they stood there.  “Uh . . . er, sorry . . .,” Harry moved away from Draco and back into the shower spray.
Draco pushed Hermione away from him gently, “Merlin’s bones!  Please don’t tell me I’m married to you too!”
“It won’t!” Harry cupped his cheek and gently turned Draco’s face toward his, “Whatever you want, that’s what I want too.”
Reading the room, Bill merely nodded in assent.  If that’s all, I’ll head back to the Ministry?  Headmaster.  Thropwaite.”  Bill nodded at each man.  “Malfoy.” He clapped Draco on the shoulder and gave him a brief squeeze.  Then he moved to Harry and wrapped his arms tightly around the younger man.  “Remember that you are a Gryffindor and be bold,” he whispered into Harry’s ear. “Faint heart never won fair gentleman!”  Then he stepped over to the Floo and was gone.
Harry wordlessly conjured some lube and spread it all over his aching cock.  He wrapped his right hand around his cock and stroked, twisting his hand when he reached the head and then stroking back down.  He used his left hand to stroke his chest and pinch his nipples.  “Oh!  Fuck!  Fuck!” Harry gasped.
“No, that’s quite alright, Dilly. I’m not hungry.” Draco didn’t look up from the book he was currently perusing.
“What now?” Harry thought to himself.  Draco was saying all the right words, and he should be happy but his body language was telling a different story.  Although he just wanted to sweep the other man up into his arms and take him to bed, Harry knew they were a long way from that.  “Baby steps, then?” Harry suggested.  At Draco’s quizzical look, he clarified, “We’ll start out slow, ok?”
Just then, Narcissa returned to the hospital room.  “Mother!  Thank Merlin!” Draco said.  “What has happened?  Why am I here?  Potter won’t tell me anything.”
“Did you think you might like to do it again?” Harry pressed on.  He leaned closer so his lips touched the shell of Draco’s ear and he could whisper, “Maybe this time I can touch you?  Would you like that?”  Draco moaned and his chest started rising and falling rapidly.  Harry gave a low chuckle, “I think that’s a yes . . . but I really need to hear you say it.”
The red candle wax had melted and pooled on the table. Draco had been at this all night but he opened a new tome and started poring over the contents. He carelessly waved his wand at the candle, making it whole again and starting the process all over. His father had collected a ridiculous number of books on Dark Magic, and Draco had never appreciated his twisted mind more. He knew there must be an answer to the curse placed on his mother, and he knew it was probably to be found in one of these volumes in the Malfoy library.
They had fallen into something of a routine.  Soon after Hilly arrived, Harry realized he didn’t know how he had ever survived without her.  His home was now clean and organized, and she was an excellent cook who provided them with delicious meals.  She even prepared food ahead so they could eat it on her days off.  Hilly turned out to be easy to get along with.  She was quiet, and a little bit shy around Harry but she turned playful around Al.  Harry had seen her entertaining his daughter with what must be the house elf version of peek-a-boo, where Hilly would disapparate and then apparate again making silly faces at Al.  Most surprising, she seemed to get along especially well with Draco.  Harry had found them several times having quiet conversations in the kitchen.
They broke off the kiss in order to catch their breath.  “Well, you can say it as much as you like because I am never going to sick of hearing it,” Harry smiled adoringly at Draco.
Harry slid his hand down from Draco’s hair so that he was cradling Draco’s face.  The moment stretched out, both quietly looking at the other.  Harry skimmed his thumb down so that it was gently gliding across Draco’s lips.  Draco kissed it softly and Harry dragged it down, pulling Draco’s lips apart.  Harry was tempted to kiss him right then, but he knew they needed to talk some more and that would never happen if they started kissing now.
Draco’s right hand was resting on top of the bed.  Harry moved his hand to cover his and groaned at the pain that shot through his body.  Draco was instantly awake.  Blinking his eyes at Harry, while he used his right hand to push the hair out of his eyes.  “Harry?” he voice sounded rough and unused.  Harry tried to push himself up, but groaned again instead and fell back on the bed.  Draco rushed over and rested his hands on Harry’s shoulders, “You shouldn’t try to move.”
“It fell over our table, and . . . over Potter and I.” Malfoy pressed his lips together in a hard line.
Draco made a small sound in his throat.  His arms were wrapped tightly around himself as if he would fly into a million pieces if he didn’t hold it all together.
“I won’t be leaving,” Harry said as he pulled away from the Healer and went back to Draco’s side.  “Ron, can you find me a chair?  And let Narcissa know?”  Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and threaded his fingers through his unresponsive ones.  “I’ll stay until he wakes up!” he added firmly.
“Come and join us, Mr. Potter-Malfoy,” Harry called from his position sprawled on the quilt with Al lying next to him.  Harry scooted back to make room and Draco slipped into the space between him and the baby.  Harry wrapped his arms around him and pulled his back against his chest, spooning him.  They both stared adoringly at Al as she gurgled and cooed at them.  This was how they happily spent their wedding day, playing with their daughter, feeding each other bites of food and drinking champagne.  And Harry knew this was truly the happiest day of his life.
Harry gave a short bark of laughter, “Ha!  Merlin no!  Not even close.”  Harry realized he really didn’t want to say anymore.  He didn’t want to dwell on how the younger Draco had helped the Death Eaters enter the castle and kill his friends.
With his daughter fed, burped and in a fresh nappy, he took Draco upstairs and showed him how to settle her in her crib.  “Try to catch her when her eyelids are heavy and mostly closing, just like this,” Harry whispered.  “If she sleeps too long in your arms, she will wake when you go to lay her down,” he continued quietly.  He held his breath when she didn’t protest and fell asleep.  He put his finger to his lips and motioned with his head toward the door.
“Not in Azkaban, Potter. Not alive.” Draco’s voice clogged up with despair. Potter’s grip on his arms tightened painfully. “It was the Dark Lord.”
Harry reached up and gently cradled Draco’s cheek. “Apparently there’s a loophole. A very big loophole.” He gave a small chuckle. “It even has a name: Persephone’s Provision.”
“Well, well, well,” he oozed. “Look at that. You… wanting my help… well boys”—he gave a self-satisfied smile—“I’m going to want something in return.”
“We thought we’d lost you, Mate!” Ron said gruffly.  Hermione dashed her hand at the tears on her face.
They didn’t stop to speak to any of their friends as they made their way out of the common room.  Before they knew it they were standing in front of the door to Dumbledore’s office.  Harry was frozen.  He didn’t want to pop the bubble of bliss that had surrounded them yesterday.  He didn’t think he wanted to hear what his Headmaster had to say.  He didn’t want his bond with Draco to end, but he also didn’t want the other man staying with him because he was forced to.  There was no way for Harry to win.
Harry Potter “The Boy Who Lived” at the moment was more like “The Man Who Was Totally Overwhelmed by Parenthood!”  He had taken an extended leave of absence from the Aurors.  He was currently laying on his couch crying while his daughter lay, also crying, in her bassinet nearby.  He glared balefully at the three-foot-high stack of parenting and baby care books on his coffee table.  They had been no help whatsoever.  Al, he had decided to adopt Teddy’s nickname for Atria Lily, refused to sleep for more than two hours at a time.  Currently, he had tried everything he could think of and still she was crying.  He had fed her, burped her, changed her nappy, rocked her, walked with her, wrapped her tightly, wrapped her loosely, put her down and walked out of the room (that had only lasted 5 minutes), taken her temperature, checked her for curses and spells, and nothing had helped!  He was exhausted physically, mentally, and emotionally.  So he decided just to join his daughter in her tears.
“I want a shower!” Harry demanded.  “It’s been almost a week and cleaning charms just aren’t cutting it!”  Harry folded his arms across his bare chest as he stood in front of Draco wearing only his boxers.
Draco frowned at Harry, “How did we become . . . you know?” Draco waved his hand, making a gesture between the two of them.
Harry stood up on unsteady legs.  He pulled off his shirt and then shoved his trousers and pants down to his knees, his cock bobbed as it was released.  He was so turned on by Draco watching, that it wasn’t going to take much to make him come.  He sat back down trying to spread his legs as far as he could, even with them still trapped in his clothes.  Draco’s eyes were riveted on Harry’s prick, and his chest was rising and falling rapidly with his breaths.
Apparently kissing Harry was no big deal because it had been over a week and Malfoy had said nothing to Harry.  In fact his behavior hadn’t changed one bit.  He was polite in DADA, and they continued to study together in the library.  It was as if the kiss had never happened.  Only the persistent tingling of Harry’s lips whenever he looked in Malfoy’s direction convinced him that he hadn’t imagined the whole thing.
“What do you care?” Teddy grumbled, looking down at his feet.  “Don’t know why we had to come and see a dumb old baby anyway.”
Harry started rapidly bobbing his head up and down and sucking hard, loving the velvet feel of Draco’s prick against his tongue.  He crooked his fingers and found Draco’s prostate.  Draco thrust his hips up wildly and Harry pulled back enough not to choke.  When he massaged Draco’s prostate again, Harry was ready for it and held Draco’s hips down.  Draco gasped and cried out, shooting his release down Harry’s throat.  As he was still swallowing, Harry pulled away and rose up on his knees and wrapped his lubed hand around his own cock.  With just three hard tugs he was coming all over Draco’s cock and stomach.
Harry remained stubbornly on one knee, “And as you have pointed out, many times, you have no memory of it!  So . . . Draco . . . will you do me the honor of becoming my husband?  Right here.  Right now.  Just for us!”  Harry held his breath, honestly not sure what Draco would do now?
Bill’s smile faded when he noticed neither Draco nor Harry were smiling at this news.  “Or . . . we can just leave it if you prefer?”
Granger’s frown deepened as she glanced around the room. “Are you sure there’s nothing?  You didn’t keep anything?”
“Let me find out some more information first, please, Mr. Potter,” Pomfrey replied calmly as she continued with her casting.
Then he moved into the bathroom and took a quick shower.  When he returned to their bedroom Draco was gone, and Harry hoped he was following his instructions.  He moved to their closet and dressed carefully, putting on the Muggle suit that Draco had picked out for him to wear the last time he had to make a public speech.  With it, he put on the deep green shirt and silver patterned tie that Draco loved to see him in.  He spent a few precious seconds trying to comb his hair into submission.
“The Healers will be pissed, but just for a minute,” Cassie motioned them forward, and led them through an exam room door.
“It’s not fair,” Draco clenched his fist and looked away, “so much has been taken from me.  So many years I can’t get back.”  Draco gestured at all of the many photos in the room, “All of this.  I don’t know this man.  I’m not this man, I didn’t do any of these things.  In my head, I’m still some sixteen-year-old brat.”
Harry agreed that this was a good idea.  As he reached the door he heard Draco accuse, “Did you just call Harry Potter, dear?”
Draco was still in shock, not sure how to form a complete sentence, thoughts ricocheting all around his brain, “What… how… why… how…?”
“Draco . . .” Harry started to reach out a hand toward his husband, but let it fall when Draco crossed his arms and gave him a cold look.
Harry pulled his fingers free and lifted Draco’s ass to rest against his thighs, tilting it up at a better angle.  He used more lube to slick up his aching prick.  Locking eyes with him again, Harry used one hand to position his own cock and the other to stroke Draco’s.  He placed the tip against Draco and pushed against the resistance, feeling the hot tight channel close around him.
His body was still tense and stiff, but Draco leaned up and met Harry’s mouth with his own in a slow soft kiss.  “I want to,” he said quietly, “you don’t know how much.”
Harry stood on the edge of the blanket with his eyes dancing and a wide smile.  He had thrown off his jacket, shoes, and socks, and had rolled up his shirt sleeves.  He looked relaxed and happy.  He approached Draco and held out his arms for Al.  When he was snuggling his baby, he gestured toward Draco, “You should get comfy too.”  Draco smiled back at him and shucked off his robe, socks, and shoes.  He followed Harry’s example and rolled up the sleeves of his white dress shirt.  He paused a minute on his left arm, but resolutely continued and revealed the mark, knowing Harry loved him anyway.
Harry closed his eyes as waves of embarrassment, anger, frustration, and arousal swept over him.  Everyone would know.  They would know he and Malfoy were sharing a room, and they would be speculating about what else they were sharing.  But then again, he was going to share a room with Malfoy!
The smile slowly faded from Draco’s mouth.  His grey eyes gazed intensely into Harry’s green ones.  “I love you . . . Harry.  I never thought I would get to say that.”  Draco bent his head for a kiss, caressing Harry’s lips with his own.
“That’s it baby,” Harry encouraged. He slipped one hand up the back of Draco’s t-shirt to stroke his back, and the other inside his pajama bottoms to palm his ass.  Draco’s ass was perfect in his hand, the skin was soft and silky and gently rounded.  Harry stroked, letting the tips of his fingers lightly brush at the cleft.  His own prick hardened and ached just from touching Draco.
When they were alone, Harry started talking softly, “Come on, Malfoy it’s time to wake up!  You know you’re crap at being ill.  And they’ve put you in one of those horrid hospital gowns you hate.  It’s not your color at all.  Come on, wake up and tell them ‘Malfoys won’t stand for this!’.”  Harry’s voice got huskier and started to break, “Baby, you need to wake up now . . . I can’t do this.  I can’t do any of this without you.  Remember, our little girl is arriving soon and she needs her papa.”  Harry’s voice dropped to a broken whisper, “I need you, Draco . . . you can’t leave me too. . .” Harry buried his head in Draco’s shoulder and sobbed.
“Wait, Harry!  You can’t just . . .” Malfoy held up both hands like he was shielding himself from Harry.
Draco glanced at the tea and then up at Dilly, seeing the worried expression on her face. He lifted the cup and took a deep drink, the beverage warming and reviving him. “Thank you,” he said softly, before reaching for a sandwich when his stomach rumbled.
“That’s to be expected.  The pain potion we gave you should be helping soon,” the Healer said confidently.
“What about . . .” Draco looked pointedly down at where Harry’s erection was straining against the fabric of his trousers.
Bright sunlight streaming through the windows and into his eyes woke Harry the next moment.  His eyes were scratchy and sore, he rubbed at them unhappily thinking about his awful night.  His mood turned even sourer as he looked over to see Malfoy sitting up primly, a small smile on his face, sipping a cup of tea.
As soon as Harry touched Malfoy the blue light disappeared.  “What are you doing, Potter?” Malfoy shook off Harry’s hand.
Harry sat cautiously on the very edge of his chair.  He badly wanted to reach out and grab Draco’s hand, but he didn’t think that would go over very well with the other boy and he wasn’t up to a public rejection right now.  Instead, Harry twisted his fingers together and focused on the hard edge of the chair digging into his thighs.
“I will break it Harry.  I’m very good at what I do.” Bill looked him in the eye this time.  He even started to put his hand on Harry’s knee for comfort, but pulled his hand back at the last moment, darting a glance at Malfoy.
Harry and Draco were huddled into a rather small alcove, created by a rocky outcropping in the tunnel. Draco ripped off a large portion of his cloak and pressed the fabric against the deep gash in Harry’s shoulder. He winced at Harry’s grunt of pain. “I’m sorry, Harry,” he whispered, “so sorry I forced you to come here.”
The other thing they hadn’t done was talk.  Harry still had no idea how Draco felt.  About any of this.  Was he really interested in Harry, or was this a case of pure expediency?  Harry was there, and he conveniently liked dick.  Would any of this have happened without the curse?
He took a deep breath and took both of Draco’s hands in his, softly running his thumbs across the back of them.  “Draco Luscious Malfoy, today I take you for my husband. I believe in you, the person you are and will grow to be, the parents we will be to Al and any other children we may be blessed with, and the family will make together. With my whole heart, I take you as my husband, knowing and accepting your faults and strengths, as you do mine. I promise to love you without reservation, comfort you in times of distress and let you comfort me, encourage you to achieve all of your goals, laugh with you and cry with you, grow with you in mind, and spirit, always be open and honest with you, and cherish you for as long as we both shall live.  You are my love and my life, today and always.”
“If that is everything, we will return to our room now.” Malfoy’s mouth was pressed into a hard flat line.
Other than that, it had been just the two of them.  They had ignored the knocking on their door when it came, and then ignored the giggling that followed when Harry shouted at them all to, “Go away!”
Robards gave up on keeping Harry calm, “He’s at St. Mungo’s.”  The words were barely out of his mouth before Harry was striding out of the office and down the corridor, Ron jogging to keep up with him.
Draco lay on the exam table, pale and unconscious.  Two Healers were busy casting diagnostic spells, and a third was in the corner testing potions. Harry rushed over to his side and grabbed his hand.  “Baby, what happened?” he whispered.
“Excitare potens maleficus,” Potter read aloud. “What the hell?! Who were you trying to bring here?” he demanded. “Imperium voco tenebris—what’s going on?!”
“No.  Stay,” Harry whispered back. He was lying on his side, facing where Draco was lying flat and stiff as a board.  “You said you were thinking about before?  Do you mean when I touched myself?”  Draco didn’t answer but made a small noise in the back of his throat.  “Did you hate it?” Harry asked quietly.
Draco sank down onto one of the settees, suddenly unable to support his own weight. “Thank you for your time. Will you ensure that Mother is made comfortable?”
It had almost been anticlimactic when they had finally reached Voldemort. Like a cliché he was standing near a cauldron with three cloaked and hooded figures nearby. He smiled when he saw them, his hideous nose-less face curving in a macabre grin.
“I want more than that, but I’ll have to be satisfied with lunch,” he pulled Draco down to kiss him senseless.
Harry looked up at Draco and tried to speak, but it came out as more of a croak, “d, di . . . didn’t.”  Harry’s throat was so dry, he wanted to tell Draco how sorry he was, and that he didn’t mean what he had said, but nothing would come out.  His movements must have set off a monitoring charm because a heard of Healers and Nurses swarmed into his room and Draco was pushed away from Harry’s side.  Multiple spells were cast and potions were poured down his throat.
“Fine,” Harry gave in grudgingly, “you can cast first and I’ll copy some of the symbols, but then we can switch.  I’m not getting stuck copying down all of the symbols.”  Harry looked around where some of his classmates had already successfully cast and each object had quite a large number of symbols surrounding it.
“Please, please Draco,” Harry begged mindlessly.  He was so primed it wasn’t going to take much to tip him over the edge.  Draco’s fingers finally reached his dick but they only traced over it lightly.  Harry writhed against the cold tile wall, spreading his legs and arching his back.  “Please!”
When he finally felt he could move, Harry cast a cleaning charm over both of them and turned on his side to face Draco.  Draco turned to face him too, and Harry reached out and used one finger to tenderly trace the features of his face; his pale eyebrow, his sharp cheekbone, his still pointy nose, the bow of his kiss-swollen lips.  Draco reached out a hand to cup Harry’s cheek, gently caressing him with his thumb.  “I love you,” Harry whispered, their gazes locked.
“Harry.” Draco’s voice shook.  He ran his hands down Harry’s arms and then threaded their fingers together.  He lifted their joined hands to press against the tiles above Harry’s head.  Draco continued the press of his thigh and moved his mouth to suck at Harry’s neck.  All Harry could do was moan and squirm as he was pinned against the wall and pleasured.
Professor Thropwaite hurried toward them, followed by Blaise and Theo supporting Malfoy between them.  “Are you sure neither of you touched anything?” Thropwaite asked again.  Blaise, Malfoy and Theo leaned against the desk where Harry was sitting.
“You can drop his hands,” Bill spoke to both of them.  Draco pulled his hands back and Harry let them go.  Harry didn’t feel any differently than he had just a moment before.  “Go stand by the door, Harry,” Bill directed.  “Let us know if you start to feel any pain.” He looked from Harry to Draco.
A small breathy sound made Harry freeze.  What was that?  Had he woken Malfoy?  He felt the weight and warmth of Malfoy’s body roll toward his own.  Malfoy’s lips brushed Harry’s neck and his hot breath skated across it.  “Don’t stop.” Malfoys voice was low and urgent.
Draco frowned and tensed, leaning forward, “Don’t leave me, Harry.”  His voice was barely more than a whisper but filled with desperation.
Thropwaite chimed in, “She smuggled the cursed object into my classroom, and performed a Suggestion Charm to get me to deliver it to you.”
“I’ve got you!  Baby, I’ve got you!  It’s ok,” he gave Draco a hard kiss, teasing with his lips and tongue.  Harry pulled away from the kiss and sat up, quickly shucking his shirt and pajama bottoms.  Then he pulled Draco’s shirt off him while he was still lying there looking stunned.  Before Draco could blink, Harry was back in his arms.  Harry growled as he felt his husband pressed against him at last.  The feeling of skin against skin was exquisite.  He rocked his body against Draco’s feeling the rasp of his nipples against Draco’s chest hair, knowing that Draco was feeling the same sensations.
“Did you feel anything, when you two touched?” Dumbledore asked them both.  Both boys’ faces turned red this time and they quickly looked away from each other, answering no.  “Alright then, give us a minute to confer.”  He then pulled both Madam Pomfrey and Thropwaite over into a conversation.
“I was hoping you would say that,” Harry said as he reached up and pulled Draco down into a messy, passionate kiss.  He rubbed his tongue along Draco’s as he thrust it in and out of his mouth, mimicking just how he would fuck him.  “We need to get you naked!” he said as he pulled Draco’s pajama bottoms all the way off.  When he was completely naked, Harry pulled Draco down, flat on his back.  His blond hair fell across his face, his lips were red and puffy and his legs were sprawled open.  Harry couldn’t get enough of just looking at him like this, so open and vulnerable to whatever Harry wanted to do to him.  “You are so fucking gorgeous!  What did I do to get so lucky?” Harry murmured.
Harry was in such a daze that he just stood there while Draco tenderly dried him off.  His face, his arms and legs, his back and his chest.  Harry leaned against the bathroom wall, with a towel draped around his neck, while he watched Draco dry off himself.  This was the first real look he was getting at Draco’s body since they had been pressed so closely in the shower.  Draco was a bit taller than Harry, but where Harry was built with thicker stockier muscles Draco was all long lean lines and curves.  He had muscles but they were lean and graceful.  In short he was just as beautiful as Harry had expected, and it made his mouth water and his dick stir just to look at him.
Harry’s heart pounded in his chest.  His moved his hands to Malfoy’s waist to steady himself.  What had they been talking about?  Hadn’t Malfoy said something about wanting something?  “What did you want, Draco?” Harry’s voice came out as a strangled whisper.
Harry’s arms tightened around Draco again as he pictured his baby in the arms of his husband.  Draco squirmed against him, causing his hips to rock against him.  Draco was hard, and Harry liked it.  He moved one hand down to his ass to rock him again.  Draco, half-awake now, took up the rhythm and pushed his hard cock against Harry’s hip.  Draco turned his head and mouthed slowly at his neck.  “Harry,” he sighed in a breathy whisper.
Harry had spoken so softly that Draco wasn’t sure he had heard right. “What do you mean because of love? Do you mean because of my mother? Because we were there to help her?”
Before Harry could respond, Draco burst out, “It’s Potter-Malfoy!  He’s Potter-Malfoy!  I’m Potter-Malfoy!  We’re both Potter-Malfoy, we’re married.”
“Draco!  Where is he?” Harry interrupted.  Robards tried to ask Harry to calm down, but Harry lost his patience.  “Where is he?  Just fucking tell me!” Harry shouted at the head of MLE.
Trying to control the need to slam Draco onto the bed and push into him right that minute, Harry took a deep breath and brought his hands up to cradle Draco’s cheeks.  “We don’t have  . . . have to go that far,” he panted, “we have time . . . don’t have to rush.”  Draco’s hard body pressing against his was making it hard to keep his train of thought.  Unable to stop himself, Harry buried his face in Draco’s neck and kissed a path up to his ear.
“I didn’t grab it,” Harry said defensively.  “I mean, he wouldn't stop and let me try and he obviously wasn’t doing anything.”  Harry’s cheeks filled with warm color as he squirmed under Dumbledore’s piercing gaze.  “I mean . . . it wasn’t, er . . . I couldn’t see any . . . yeah,” Harry sighed, “that’s when I grabbed the wand.”
Harry moved his right hand to rest on his stomach and held his breath again.  Was he really going to do this?  Right next to Malfoy?  His cock twitched again, and Harry slowly slid his hand down his stomach, pausing at the elastic waistband of his pajama bottoms.  Harry bit down on his lower lips as he eased his fingers under the waistband.  His free hand flew up to his mouth to silence the groan he made when his fingers finally closed around his hard dick.
“You think this is because of me?” Harry asked indignantly.  He was starting to feel very fuzzy about things, but this still didn’t seem right.
Harry felt his knees go weak and tears fill his eyes.  He quickly sat down in an armchair by the window, and the rest of the world fell away.  Tears fell freely while he looked at her sweet round face, which had just a hint of a pointy chin.  Atria Lily had wispy black hair and light grey eyes, eyes that stared steadily into her father’s.  He unwrapped her blanket and quickly counted, and kissed all ten fingers and toes.  Then he wrapped her back up, holding her close.  “Oh, my sweet girl,” he whispered.
Without letting himself dwell too much on the idea of Draco removing all of his clothes, Harry shoved his boxers off and stepped into the shower spray.  He ducked under the spray, getting his face and hair wet, and when he came out of it he could tell Draco was in the cubical behind him.  Okay.  This was happening then.  Harry reached out for the soap on the shower ledge and moved to get out of the spray of water so he could lather up.
“Don’t leave,” Draco’s voice got stronger.  “I’ll stay with you all night.  I’ll do whatever you want.”
“You mean Malfoy and I were cursed on purpose?” Harry’s voice conveyed his anger and shock.  It had been one thing to think that they had made a mistake and unintentionally triggered this curse, but it was something else entirely to know that someone had intended for this to happen to him.  He turned to Bill again. “What happens if you don’t break it?”
Remembering the dared kiss with Draco, Harry was determined to stay away from dares. “Uh . . . truth?”
“Okay.  Calm down Potter!” Pansy squinted round the circle.  “I’ll change it . . . Draco, just kiss Potter then.”
Soooo much smut!!! I threw in a little praise kink, just because. It’s a long one, I hope the wait was worth it.  ;)  I have loved writing this story.  Thank you so much to those of you who have followed and commented!  It means more to me than you can ever know.
The next thing Draco knew, he was back in the Department of Mysteries, on his knees in front of the Veil. He looked around frantically but only Granger and Weasley were there. “Noooooo!” he cried out.
Comprehension dawned in Harry and he knelt down in front of Teddy.  “That’s too bad, Ted,” he said slowly.  “I was kind of hoping you could, you know, help me out.  Since you’re my godson, I was hoping you would want to be her big brother.”  Harry reached out and gently squeezed Teddy’s shoulder.  “I thought maybe you could show her the ropes, y’know.  Big brother stuff.  You’d be really important!”
Uilliam blew out a sigh, “I’m sorry Harry . . . we just don’t know.  Our brain scans, show normal brain activity.  His body could just be taking time to heal.”  He reached out and held Harry’s hand, “We have our next best potions expert working on this.  In the meantime, we will keep monitoring him.  We’ll let you know if there are any changes.”
With Draco’s movement, Harry once again became aware of their nudity and was distracted once again by feeling Draco’s silky limbs against him.  He had resolved that they would finally talk today, but now all he wanted to do was to touch Draco everywhere.  Maybe Monday would be a good day for them to talk?
The rest of them moved as a group up to the infirmary.  Theo and Blaise still supporting Malfoy, and Ron and Hermione doing the same for Harry.  Thropwaite hurried ahead and when they reached the hospital wing, he was busy conferring with Madame Pomfrey.
“Harry,” she started to reply cautiously.  She looked over to Ron as if seeking an ally, “Harry, we don’t know anything yet.  He’s still being evaluated.  Why don’t you head to the waiting-“
Draco stumbled to his feet on the other side of the circle.  “You can’t . . . you don’t . . . you don’t know what you’re saying.” Draco spread his hands out.
“Yeah . . . full . . . burns a little,” he answered.  Lowering his head, Harry licked Draco’s nipple.  Then he sucked at the nub until Draco was panting again.  Draco started rocking his hips, “Merlin!  Move, Potter!”  Harry gently slid out a bit and then pushed back in, biting down on his lip to keep himself from just slamming back into the tight heat surrounding him.  Harry fucked him slowly and steadily.
“Of course, Mr. Malfoy,” the Healer rushed to say. “If there is nothing else I will go up to her now.”
Al had come home with him the day after she was born.  At first, they had plenty of visitors, friends and family arriving with food and gifts.  Everyone they knew had come, with two notable exceptions.  Hermione had decided that she needed some space to focus on her own family, and would not come and see them for the first month.  Harry knew she was making the best choice for her, but he missed her.  And he could really use the advice of smartest person, as well as the best parent, he knew right now.
“No that’s ok, you two are bonding,” Harry tried to keep a straight face as he moved to sit across from Draco.
Harry was so lost in his appreciation he almost didn’t notice when Malfoy held the bottle out to him.  Without thinking about it he took a mouthful and swallowed, coughing and choking as the fire hit his throat.  He leaned forward trying to catch his breath and Malfoy gave him a few good thumps on his back.  “It figures I’m bonded to a lightweight, Potter,” Malfoy complained.
The soft morning light filtered through the trees and fell on both men.  Harry thought Draco had never looked more handsome.  “You’re beautiful,” he breathed out before he could think better of it.  Then he reached out and twined their fingers together to pull Draco underneath the arch with him.  “Thank you,” he said before giving him a tender kiss.
“Ah!” Draco cried out and he pulled his arms from the headboard, gripping Harry’s biceps as the head of his cock popped through the tight ring of muscle.
Harry went down the spiral staircase, and even though his eyes burned with unshed tears, there was no bond pain at all.  It had worked.  He and Draco were no longer bonded.  He returned to Dumbledore’s office and found the Headmaster and Draco huddled together and speaking in hushed tones.  “It worked,” Harry’s words came out sounding bitterer than he had intended.  He knew he should thank Bill but he couldn’t bring himself to say the words.
“So hot!” Harry growled before giving him a deep kiss, plunging his tongue into Draco’s mouth.  Harry pulled his mouth away, “So fucking hot!”  Harry sat back up and looked approvingly at the man lying underneath him.  “Whatever happens, don’t let go until I say so,” he ordered.
“He was angry, Draco,” Bill said gently.  “It was meant to punish you for your failure to The Dark Lord and how you helped Harry in the final battle.”
“I don’t…” Draco began again, his mind scrambling for some explanation for why he had summoned Harry Potter instead of the Dark Lord.
“Just wasn’t expecting it,” Harry rasped.  He sat back up and watched as Malfoy took two more drinks.  He handed the bottle back to Harry and this time Harry took a more moderate drink, gasping only a little this time.
Harry snorted with dark humor, “Of course you like it, you decorated it!”  Draco looked back at him blankly.  “You redecorated the whole house, actually.  So if you don’t like anything, you have only yourself to blame.”  Harry moved out of the room and back into the hall.  “Al’s room is right there,” he said pointing to a door across the hall.  “And down there is the hall bath, and on beyond that is our . . . I mean, my room.”  Harry looked away from Draco.  Fuck, this was so hard to treat him like a stranger!  “Your clothes are all still in the closet.  You can leave them there if you want.  The guest room only has one small wardrobe.”
“Well now… Isn’t this just an unexpected treat? Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy—what brings you boys here? And together, no less?” He clapped his hands in a mockery of joy.
The rest of the day passed normally, or what passed for normal since the curse.  They ate their meals together at the end of one of the house tables.  In fact all of the eighth years had started sitting at different tables for each meal.  This new habit had rubbed off on the lower year students and many of them had also taken to sitting at the tables of different houses.  So Harry and Malfoy ended up sitting at the end of whatever table was convenient.  Most of the time they were joined by Ron, Hermione, Blaise and Pansy.  Their four friends formed a formidable wall of protection against the curious and overly nosy.
“I am no house elf, Potter!” Draco said indignantly.  “No self-respecting house elf would let this happen.  Where is your house elf, Potter?”
“Are you still planning on separating?” Draco sat very still, his chest hardly rising and falling with his breaths.
He gave Draco a tender kiss as he pulled out of him, collapsing on the bed next to him.  As they both lay there breathing heavily and a little stunned, Draco’s hand found his and he threaded their fingers together.  As they lay there silently, waiting to regain control of their muscles, Harry squeezed his hand and Draco gave him a squeeze in return.
Opposing emotions of both relief and trepidation filled Draco. He knew this would most likely get him killed but he could do nothing else with his mother’s life on the line. Draco nodded, not quite trusting his voice to be steady, and listened intently as she explained how they could create a talisman to help them locate the Dark Lord.
“No!” Draco shouted before taking a breath and continuing in a calmer tone, “Have you been to the afterlife?” Was it possible Potter was actually going to be able to help him?
Harry left the steamy bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist.  His clothes were so disgusting that he had just used an Incindio on them.  Now he poked around Draco’s bedroom, looking at his clothes.  He had worn some of Draco’s clothes before.  Draco was taller and more slender, but Harry could use magic to make any adjustments he needed.  In amongst the wizarding robes, Harry found some muggle trousers and shirts.  He chose a pair of plain grey trousers that he thought he could pull off, and a shirt patterned in grey, lilac, and blue that was made out of the softest material Harry had ever felt.  He found Draco’s underwear drawer and pulled on a pair of black boxer shorts.  A wave of desire washed over him as he pictured Draco wearing nothing but this pair of pants.  He pushed those thoughts aside and finished dressing, adjust the clothes to fit his frame.  He had no choice but to put back on his old trainers, all of Draco’s shoes looked too uncomfortable, and if he looked foolish – so be it.
“Draco, I mean it,” Harry insisted. He cupped one hand around Draco’s cheek. “You didn’t force me.” He leaned in and pressed a gentle kiss to Draco’s lips but pulled back before Draco could return it. “Now the talisman is signaling that we must be getting closer, and I don’t see any demons in the passage, so we need to get moving.” He nodded briskly, all businesslike, at Draco but squeezed his shoulder reassuringly at the same time.
“She and her father have been turned over to the Aurors,” Dumbledore added.  They all sat for a minute listening to the clock ticking and letting this information sink in.
Harry himself did not have too much contact with Draco.  They took turns caring for Al, and Draco was getting quite good with her.  The few times Harry was able to watch them together, unobserved, had swelled his heart with emotion.  Unfortunately, whenever Draco noticed that Harry was there too, he would hand Al over to Harry and leave the room.
Silence filled the room once again, and Harry risked a quick look at Draco.  He had his head down and his eyes closed, and he looked miserable.  He needed Draco to choose him, Harry realized.  They would have to sever the bond so that they could then choose each other.  “No, we’re ready.  You should do it,” Harry’s voice came out steady much to his relief.
Potter reached down and laced their fingers together. Draco knew it was just because they needed to move through the Veil as one, but it still made his heart do a stupid fluttering thing in his chest. He tentatively tried to pull his hand free, but to his secret thrill, Potter tightened his hold on Draco’s hand even more. With a brief nod in the direction of his friends, Potter turned and pulled Draco with him through the Veil.
Harry felt pain lancing through his chest.  Draco didn’t remember him as anything other than a bitter rival.  All of the love and joy from the past three years had evaporated.  Was it possible that even though Draco had survived, that he would lose him anyway?  Harry twisted his wedding ring, round and round his finger.  Their rings were platinum snakes.  Harry’s snake had grey gems for eyes, and Draco’s green.  Draco had designed the rings himself, persuading Harry that the snake symbolized both of them because of Harry’s Parseltongue ability.  Harry adored his ring and never took it off, but he did tend to play with it when he was anxious.
“What is the meaning of this, Potter?  You can’t just barge in here without permission!” Draco shouted.  His face was white and he slowly lowered the wand he had tightly clutched in his hand.
“Let’s move over here.” Bill stood up and moved to the center of the room.  Harry and Draco followed him.  “I need you to face each other and hold hands,” Bill instructed.
“No!  No, you didn’t,” Draco pushed both his hands through his hair and then dropped his head, “Fuck this is hard to explain.”  He pulled his knees up and then crossed his arms over his knees and rested his forehead on his arms.  Harry stayed quiet, waiting.  “I don’t remember anything about sex,” Draco’s voice was so low Harry strained to hear it.  “About having sex, I mean.” Draco paused, lifting his head a risking a look over in Harry’s direction.  “Don’t laugh, but it’s like I’m a virgin.  Ridiculous isn’t it”
Draco resolutely would not let himself think about the invitations. The three invitations that had each arrived eight weeks apart over the last six months. The invitations where Potter had asked him out for dinner… in what Draco could only assume was some sort of twisted Gryffindor ideal around reconciliation. Invitations that Draco had immediately incinerated, a hedge against the possibility of finding himself tucking them into some ridiculous spot such as his journal or under his pillow. Draco had refused to acknowledge the existence of the invitations, choosing to believe they had never existed at all. And since Potter never mentioned them either you would think that it would be an easy feat to accomplish—you would be wrong. No one else but Draco needed to know how difficult it was for him to keep his breathing steady and heartbeat from racing when Potter was in the same room. And now his house-elf was suggesting he contact Potter with his problem. Impossible.
Draco let go of Harry’s hands but stayed pressed up close against him.  Harry wound his arms around Draco’s neck and rested, too depleted to do anything else.   Draco slid his arms around Harry’s back and held him tightly.  They stayed like this for a long time, motionless, just holding each other closely.  Finally, they stirred.  Draco pressed a kiss to Harry’s temple and stepped back.  Once he was assured that Harry could stand on his own, Draco turned off the water and reached for a towel.
Draco pulled his sticky hand off of Harry’s prick and ducked his head, blond hair falling across his face and blushing.  “I . . . I’ll see you in the morning then,” Draco said nervously, looking everywhere but where Harry sat cock out and legs sprawled still covered with come.  Then he rushed from the room calling back, “goodnight.”
Harry exploded, “How about the fact that you’re a whore in my bed every night, but won’t let me touch you the next day!”  Draco flinched and paled, but Harry was too consumed by his anger to care.  “How about the fact that you sneak out of my bed every night? Or the fact that when I tell you I love you, you never respond,”Harry's voice broke with the last sentence.  “Draco, I can’t take this,” he whispered brokenly.  Realizing he was still gripping Draco’s arm, he let go.
Harry desperately wanted to get things back on a positive track between the two of them.  “Can . . . I mean, would you . . . er, would you want . . . uh, to, er . . . maybe, uh . . . kiss . . . me?” he managed to get out.  Draco looked startled.  “I, I . . . I mean if you want to . . . uh, of course,” Harry felt the need to add.
A ghost of a smile crossed Potter’s lips. “Well that should be enough of a lure to get Hermione here. She’s never met a library that she didn’t want to plunder for reading materials.” He made a vague gesture to the doorway. “So I’ll just go then…”
Harry had Al laying along his thighs and was bending over her to play their game.  He rested one hand on her tummy and used the other to cover his face.  “I know I sure do.  Peek-a-boo!” Harry laughed and smiled at the baby.
Draco’s gaze flew from Harry, to his mother, to the Healer, and back to Harry twisting his ring.  “Just what is it you’re not telling me?” Draco demanded.  When he received no response from the others, Draco looked at Harry’s left hand again and then he looked down at his own hand.  “No!  That’s impossible,” he gasped.  “What in Hades, is going on here?”
Harry ached, he throbbed, and he needed to come so badly.  He was so hard!  It had been three days of living with Malfoy side by side, and three days of pure torture.  Before being cursed, Harry had lived the life of a normal eighteen year old boy.
Draco looked at Harry intently and then tipped his glass at him, “Congratulations, Potter.  That seems to be a habit of yours.”
“Wait, Potter, stop,” Draco took the step that put him in front of Harry again.  “I’m trying . . . I am.  I want this,” he waved the frame in his hand.  He looked at Harry, his grey eyes intense and unsmiling, “I do!”
A half sob half laugh came out of Harry’s mouth as squeezed Draco tightly, “Thank Merlin!”  Relief and happiness shot through every atom of his being.  He moved his mouth back to Draco’s and poured all the love he had into his kiss.  Sipping and licking and sucking.  Lips clinging, tongues searching, they kissed and kissed.
Draco stared back for a long moment, never stopping the gentle brush of his thumb on Harry’s cheek.  “I never knew,” Draco whispered back.  “I never knew I could be this happy.”  Harry put his arms around him and gathered Draco close to him.  He rolled onto his back, pulling Draco with him so that he was now lying half on top of Harry and against his chest.  Draco tilted his head back so that he could look at Harry, “You are my love . . . and my life . . . today and always.”
“You can’t help, Potter,” Draco said lowly, realizing that his mother was dying and he had botched up his only hope. “You already defeated this Death Eater.”
They left the room and walked back to their dorm without speaking.  Both of them were too busy thinking about all of the information they had been given.
Draco’s eyes flickered with emotion, but Harry couldn’t read it.  “This is the third day,” he said simply.
Draco whined a little in his throat and moved to straddle Harry’s lap.  Harry moved his hand from Draco’s waist down to hold the firm curve of Draco’s ass and pull him closer.  The first brush of their hard cocks was almost his undoing.  He and Draco both moaned into their kiss as they rutted together.  Harry moved his hand to start unfastening Draco’s trousers.
Harry blasted through whatever wards may have been in place and landed with a loud crack.  He looked around to see a startled Narcissa starting to rise from a chaise lounge, and an angry Draco brandishing his wand.
Even more color flooded Harry’s face at the way the question was worded.  Looking down at his shoes, Harry answered, “I grabbed his wrist.”
“Trust me. OK?” Harry asked with a sweet smile plastered across his face.  “Thirty minutes!  Back garden!”
“Alright then,” Draco mounted his broom and nodded at the snitch Harry was still holding, “Let’s do it!”
Draco broke Harry’s gaze and raised his wand to cast a basic healing spell, he hoped that would be enough until they could escape back into their own world and Harry could be healed properly.
When the wind had died down and the light faded Draco’s knees threatened to buckle at the sight before him. There in the dungeons of Malfoy Manor stood a half-dressed and slightly pissed off Harry Potter. He was wearing only a black pair of soft cotton joggers, so low on his hips, they seemed in danger of falling to the floor with the slightest provocation. His inky locks, already a mess, were tousled further as he pushed his hand through his hair, shoving it back off his forehead.
Malfoy’s free hand gripped Harry’s shoulder and he felt his hot breath across his neck.  The added sensations were enough to tip Harry over the edge and then he was coming hard, all over his hand and the inside of his pajamas.  As the aftershocks rolled through his body, he felt Malfoy shudder and moan into his neck.
In Harry’s humble opinion, Saturday had been the best day of his life.  The day had been spent entirely with just the two of them.  They had endlessly explored each other’s bodies.  No square inch had been left untouched, unstroked, unkissed, and unlicked.  Harry had lost count of the number of orgasms he had had, and of the number of times he had watched Draco’s face suffused with his own pleasure.
Boom!  Harry had just walked into a trap.  Here he was trapped in a windowless, doorless room, in a house filled with dark magic.  Who knew if the other Aurors would be able to free him?  He had tried every spell and charm he could think of, but nothing had made any change to his predicament.  He should never have accepted this assignment, knowing his concentration would be shit today after the confrontation this morning.
“This is not an exact science, as much as we would like it to be, Mr. Malfoy,” the Healer reprimanded.
“No.  I’m sorry, Harry,” Narcissa reached out and grabbed his hands.  “Please don’t give up on him!  He was so happy with you, and about the baby-“ her voice broke.  “Don’t give up, Harry.  He just needs time,” she pleaded.
Ron moved quickly to Hermione’s side.  “OK, I got you,” He wrapped his arms around her and she sagged into him with a sigh.  “We’ll get you to St Mungo’s.  Harry, can you get the kids to Bill and Fleur’s?  They’ve agreed to watch them.  And send a Patronus to Mum and Dad.”  While he was talking, Ron Accioed Hermione’s suitcase.  When he finished, he stood there staring at Harry expectantly.  “Harry?” he asked impatiently.
“No, no… of course not.” Voldemort made a dismissive gesture. “That is not… possible.” He steepled his hands against his forehead appearing to be in great thought. “Ah yes!” A delighted smile crept over his hideous face. “I have it. I will require a sacrifice.” He folded his arms and looked both men over.
Much later, after the sun had crept cautiously into the sky, Draco found what he was looking for. Poring over these books filled with the Dark Arts had taken a toll on Draco. The Dark Magic had crackled along the edges of his own magic all night, putting him on edge and filling him with dread. Only to save his beloved mother would he put himself through this. In a book that exuded evil just looking at it, he found a spell to summon beings from the dead and enthrall them to your will. Resolutely ignoring the sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach, Draco grabbed a sheet of parchment and started carefully copying down the spell.
“It has to be me, Draco,” Harry said quietly. “Your mother will need you as she recovers, and you know it.” Harry leaned into Draco’s grasp for a moment and then whispered in his ear, “Live your life and be happy Draco.” Then he carefully pulled away from Draco’s hands and walked over to Voldemort. “Send him back and break the curse.”
“Of course!” Draco answered smoothly, ignoring Harry’s hesitation.  He reached over and picked up Al, and then turned to place her in Hilly’s arms.
Every time Harry had thought about asking, his throat had closed up with fear of what he might hear as Draco’s answer.  Draco hadn’t asked any questions either.  Mostly their mouths were too busy to talk.
Refusing to acknowledge his doubts he took a deep breath and raised his wand. He spared a brief thought to the connection he always felt with Potter when using this wand, and then he began the incantation. Nothing happened when he finished and Draco could feel tears of frustration prickle his eyes.
Harry’s panic-stricken eyes met Draco’s across the wide room.  What the hell was happening?  Draco was shaking his head no in slow motion, but that didn’t stop Pansy and Blaise from dragging him into the circle.
They brushed off the concern of their friends sitting in the common room, and headed straight for their room.  No sooner had the door shut behind them when Malfoy said, “I don’t know about you, Potter, but I need a drink!”
“I fucking love you so much, Draco!” Harry said roughly, squeezing his hand tightly. Harry pulled a ring from his pocket.  The platinum ring was in the shape of a snake with green eyes. Draco had taken it off when he was in the hospital and Narcissa had given it to Harry for safe keeping.  Harry had been worried about rejection, so had held off giving it back to him.  He held the ring up, “With this ring, I pledge myself to you, my husband, my heart, my body and my soul,” and slipped it onto Draco’s finger.
When they were back downstairs, he updated Draco, “The house elf will be here tomorrow morning.  Her name is Hilly.”
Even with the cold hard Malfoy mask back in place, he still fascinated Harry.  And Harry fantasized about what it would be like to melt Malfoy’s cold reserve.  What if he could get Malfoy to kiss him again?  This time Harry would respond wholeheartedly.  His dick twitched at the thought and reminded Harry of his predicament.
Sorry to be MIA for so long and then post such a sad and short chapter.  The next chapter is already written and I promise to post it on Monday.  Sorry to fuck around with everyone’s emotions, if it helps any – I made myself cry when I wrote this chapter.  Next one gets better, I’m still promising a happy ending!  C-
“M’ hot.” Harry was starting to feel better, but thought he should really get rid of his trousers too.  He reached down and started unfastening the flies.
Potter firmed his lips into a straight line and glared at Draco. “If I do this, and that’s a VERY big if”—Potter put his hands on his hips, surely intending to look imposing but his borrowed clothing countering that effect—“you must agree to work with Hermione on any preparations contained in that book.” He nodded at the book Draco held.
The need to touch him was overwhelming and Harry brought his index finger up to tenderly trail along his jaw.  It was both soft and rough at the same time.  Harry shuffled himself closer on the bed until his face was just inches away, and he could feel the gentle puff of Draco’s breath against his face.  A lock of his hair had fallen into Draco’s face.  Harry reached over and brushed it back, letting his fingers linger and absently play with the silken strands.  Draco’s hair had always captivated his attention.  So pale it seemed to glow in the sunlight.  He loved it when it was longer as it was now, and he could tangle his fingers in it.
“Harry Potter is being the most powerful wizard alive. Harry Potter will help Master Draco,” Dilly said with confidence.
Harry released the snitch and they both took off.  It was all joy and exhilaration as they both flew and dove and rolled, having the time of their lives.  Two hours later, they had landed and were sitting on a small hill at the edge of the meadow.  They were both reclining back on their hands, catching their breath.  They had played three games, Draco had won two of them and had been grinning like a loon since the first win.
How Harry felt? How did he feel? Draco was feeling light-headed and he was sure his heart was about to beat right out of his chest. “How… ah, how do you feel?” Draco asked hesitantly.
With an annoyed groan, Harry tore himself out of the bed and over to his wardrobe next to Malfoy’s.  They had come up with a routine, of sorts.  The doors of the wardrobes were fairly wide, so they opened them up and stood behind them to change.  They were only a foot or so apart, but they had the illusion of privacy and that was much needed.
“No!  No that’s not . . . that’s not what happened!  Draco, I . . .” the Healer cut Harry off before he could continue.
“Fine!  I’ll owl my assistant.  She might know what you’re talking about.”  Harry was too exhausted to argue with Draco, but there was one point he wouldn’t concede, “Cooking and cleaning only!  We agreed, before, that no one else was going to raise our baby for us!”
“Oi, Hermione!  He just had a house fall on him!  You can’t just grab him!” Ron softened his harsh words by wrapping his arms around his wife.
After dinner they headed to the DADA classroom.  They were going to meet with Bill and Professor Thropwaite and find out the progress they were having with breaking the curse.  Bill got up and gave Harry a bone crushing hug as a greeting.  Malfoy grabbed at Harry’s arm, squeezing his bicep like he was going to drag him away.  Bill stepped back quickly and threw up his hands. “Sorry, Malfoy.”  Harry looked back and forth between them.  Malfoy glowering darkly at Bill and Bill backed away slowly.
Harry held a sleeping Draco in his arms until the sun had moved well up into the sky.  And while he held him, he thought.  He thought about what it would be like if Draco loved him back, what their life could be like, what a team they would make.
Draco closed his eyes against Potter’s fury. He had known it was a foolhardy plan, but he had had no other choice. His knees felt weak and only Potter’s tight hold on him kept him upright.
Harry slid his hand down Draco’s spine, delicately tracing each vertebra, pausing to stroke the small of his back.  He was gratified by the small sounds of pleasure Draco was making and how he pressed himself even closer to Harry.  This was one of Draco’s pleasure spots, he had discovered yesterday.  Harry had spent a lot of time licking and sucking him there.
Harry placed his hand gently on Draco’s cheek, “It’s alright, Draco.  I said we can go slowly, and I meant it.  I don’t want anything you’re not comfortable with.”  Harry let go of Draco and Draco moved to sit back on the couch.
“And don’t fucking say ‘I don’t know,’ ” Potter interrupted angrily, grabbing Draco’s arm and giving it a firm shake. “You’re the one who brought me here! What the hell is happening?!”
Waking slowly, Harry stretched and luxuriated in the cozy nest that was his bed.  The sheets were crisp and smooth, the duvet fluffy and warm, and the warm weight of his husband’s body pressed against him was perfect.  His arms tightened reflexively around Draco, pulling him closer still.  This was their favorite way to sleep, Draco pulled half on top of him with his head pillowed on Harry’s chest and Harry’s arms tight around him.  Draco always pouted if he let him get more than a few inches away while they slept.
They stared at each other for a long, intense moment.  Lust flared in both green and grey eyes.  Draco broke the stare, rolling over and grasping the waistband of Harry’s pajamas.  He lowered his head and trailed the tips of his hair along the bare skin that he exposed inch by inch.  Harry moaned and twisted beneath the silky strands.  Draco pulled the clothing all the way off, crawled back up his body, and knelt over Harry.  He held out his hand for Harry to cast a wandless lube charm, and then used that to slick up Harry’s cock.
Even with all of the company coming and going, when Draco finally opened his eyes, it was only Harry in the room.  Andromeda had taken Narcissa down to get a quick cup of tea and Ron and Hermione had left to have dinner with their children.
Harry looked at the man standing so stiffly in his living room and he had to acknowledge that this man was not his husband, not in their hearts anyway.  They wouldn’t be sharing a bed again anytime in the near future.  Harry heaved himself up off the couch, “There is a guest room across from Al’s room.  You can stay there.”  Harry led the way out of the room and up the stairs, while Draco levitated his trunk behind him.
“Yes,” Bill said softly.  “Her father.”  Bill’s eyes went back and forth between Harry and Draco.  After a quick look at Draco, Harry looked down at his tangled fingers.
“Yes, yes. Dilly, would you see out Auror Potter?” Draco spoke to the house-elf. He turned to the other man. “Thank you, Potter!” Emotion made his voice rougher than normal.
Draco had just left the room when Dilly returned to remove the tray of food. Her attention caught by the book Draco had left open, Dilly went over to see what he had written. Her large eyes widened and she brought a hand to her mouth as she read the words on the parchment. She frowned angrily at the tome on the desk and with a quick wave of her hand she closed it shut. Turning her attention back to the parchment, she waved her hand once more and changed some of the words on the page. When finished, she nodded to herself before picking up the heavy tray and Disapparating away.
Harry stood by and watched while Draco fussed with his tie and the folds of his robes.  Finally, he broke the silence. “We should go now, Draco.”  Draco looked over to him and gave him a short nod.
“Guess I am . . . Draco.”  Harry decided since he couldn’t remember last night, he better make some new memories.  He lifted his left hand to the back of Draco’s neck and tugged the other man closer.  He took advantage of Draco’s gasp of surprise when their lips met to slip his tongue into his mouth and slide against Draco’s tongue.  Draco moaned into his mouth and Harry took that as a sign he was doing something right, and deepened their kiss.
Malfoy moved off the bed and stood next to it.  Harry tried to get out of bed on his side, but as he swung his legs over the side and started to stand his whole body started aching.  He stopped and flopped back onto the bed.  He turned his head and looked over to where Malfoy was bent over and clutching the bedpost.
Hogwarts was different this year, at least for Harry Potter and his friends.  The school had been rebuilt over the summer, and was pretty much back to normal unless you were returning to redo your seventh year.  Only twenty-seven students had chosen to return and retake their seventh year, fourteen boys and thirteen girls.  There was a mix from all four houses.  Because the dormitories had not been built to contain an eighth year class, and the board did not want to mix the ‘eighth years’ in with the regular seventh years, a new common room and dormitories were created for the eighth years.
Harry skimmed his hands down caressing Draco’s inner thighs.  Draco whimpered and squirmed in response.   He slid his hands behind Draco’s knees and pushed them up and back, exposing all of him to Harry’s gaze.  Harry looked back up and got caught in stormy grey eyes.  He saw want and desire, but also uncertainty.  He was conscious that although he and Draco had had sex hundreds of times, this man lying beneath him, had never done this before.  He was determined that Draco would feel nothing but pleasure at his hands.  Maintaining eye contact, Harry said softly, “If you want to stop at any time . . . just let me know.”  Draco started shaking his head no but Harry continued, “I know this is new for you.  It’s ok if you change your mind, baby.”
Harry made a face at Draco, only just stopping himself from sticking his tongue out at the other boy.  He pushed up on his elbows and the blanket fell back to reveal his bare chest.  “Aaah!  Where are my clothes?” Harry looked at Draco accusingly, sure he must have had something to do with their disappearance.  To his consternation, Draco started laughing.  “What? What’s so funny?” Harry demanded.
“I do.” Harry started across the circle.  “I do know what I’m saying.  I’m saying, I love you.  You can be an arrogant prat, but you are also clever, funny and thoughtful.  We aren’t under the bond anymore, but I just want to be with you.  All the time.”  Harry had reached the other side of the circle.  He reached out with his right hand and cupped Draco’s cheek.  Harry’s thumb brushed gently back and forth over the soft skin.
Draco wasn’t sure what was happening here. So much had happened in the underworld. And there was so much unsaid between them. Now here he was sitting next to Harry and holding his hand. His heart was racing and his stomach was in knots. He wanted this to mean something. He hoped it meant something.
Startling Harry, Draco dropped to his knees too.  Insecurity and cautious hope were written all over his face as he raised his eyes to look at Draco.  Draco twined their fingers together tightly.  “Almost from the first moment I met you, Potter, you commanded my attention,” Draco’s voice was soft but steady.  “You fascinated me, angered me, frustrated me, irritated me, thwarted me, amused me, haunted me and aroused me!  Ask any Slytherin from my year, and I’m sure they’ll tell you that I never shut up about ‘Bloody Potter’.”  Draco’s lips quirked up in a wry grin before he continued.  “I tried desperately, not to fall in love with you.  I was certain you would hurt me.  But I failed . . . spectacularly.  Honestly, Harry, I can hardly remember a time when I wasn’t in love with you.”
Harry shook off his fear and turned to look at a solemn Rose and Hugo.  “Hey guys, we're going to go see Uncle Bill and Aunt Fleur.  Let me go get your bag and we’ll leave.”  Harry grabbed the bag that Hermione had prepacked and took the kids to Shell Cottage.
Silence descended once more over the table.  Narcissa one again smoothed over the awkward moment.  “If you’re both finished, let’s adjourn to the sitting area?”  They moved across the room and Harry settled himself into an armchair facing the settee, where Draco and his mother were sitting.  They had just sat down when an owl arrived and Draco rose to let it in the window.  He fed the owl a treat and untied the parchment from its leg.
Narcissa turned stricken eyes on Harry, but directed her comments at the Healer, “The last thing he remembers is being at Hogwarts during his sixth year.”
“Yes, yes, oh fuck, yes!” Draco screamed out as he came hard all over Harry’s hand.  The muscles in his ass clenched repeatedly around Harry as Draco shot all over his hand.  This sent Harry tumbling into his own orgasm, waves of sensation flowing over him as he spilled into Draco.
“Yes!” Draco hissed, digging his nails into Harry’s arms where he held on tightly.  “Again!  Don’t stop,” he ordered, tossing his head back and arching his neck.
Harry swallowed hard, he couldn’t remember feeling so unsure of himself, “but . . . but do you want it with me?”
He was eating a sandwich at his desk while he completed paperwork, when Robards called him and Ron back into his office.
It took a long time, but the other Healers left and Wilcox called them all back over to Harry.  “There was a lot of internal damage.  Some of the spells we couldn’t do until he was awake and we could see the extent of the damage.  We think we were able to repair everything,” Wilcox said bluntly.
“Oh!  Oh, yes!  Of course,” Harry said as he rose and brought her over to his two best friends.  He placed the baby in Hermione’s arms.  “I don’t know how I can ever repay you . . . “ he swept fresh tears from his eyes.
They fell into each other.  Lips pressing, tears mingling, fingers tangling, tongues sliding.  They broke away laughing and panting for breath.  Joy filled the air around them.  “How do you want to celebrate?” Harry asked, clutching Draco to him.
Harry interrupted impatiently, “Why is he unconscious?  When will he wake?  What the hell happened?”
“Salazar! Potter!” Draco gasped, “I . . . I want this, want you . . . thought about it for a long time.”  As Harry kissed along his neck, Draco thrust his hips and rubbed their dicks together.  “Merlin, you have too many clothes on!” Draco pushed his hands between them and started wildly grabbing at Harry’s shirt, buttons flying off as he roughly pulled at the fabric.
She unrolled the parchment and read through the contents.  “I’m sorry but I must respond to this right away.  Please excuse me,” she said as she rose.  “I shouldn’t be too long.”  Then she went into the adjoining room and shut the door.
“Um… er…” Harry broke eye contact and looked away. Red filled his face and he tried to pull his hand away but Draco tightened his own hand to prevent it.
When he was finally seated, Draco rested one hand next to Harry’s head and with the other he cupped his jaw and pulled him up for a kiss.  Harry finally gave into the urge and grasped Draco’s hips, thrusting up as he held Draco firmly.  “Harry!” Draco gasped, and whimpered into their kiss.  He leaned back and started rocking his hips, pushing himself back and forth on Harry’s prick.
“What the hell, Potter?” Draco pulled away and batted Harry’s hands away.  “What in Salazar’s name, are you doing?”  Draco sat up in bed, and looked down at what he was wearing, “What is happening?  This isn’t the hospital wing.  Where am I, Potter?  And why are you here?  What have you done to me?”
“That’s impossible, Potter.” Draco turned and started rummaging in his wardrobe.  “How stupid are you?  Or have you forgotten we are bonded?” Draco scoffed.
Luckily, he was and they reached the living room quickly.  Harry took their fussy baby in his arms and gently rocked her while he made cooing noises at her.  “Why are you doing that?” Draco asked frowning at Harry.
“Draco darling, calm yourself.  You’re just a bit confused.  Harry dear, why don’t you get a Healer?” Narcissa suggested as she moved over to Draco’s side.
Harry roughly scrubbed the tears from his face.  Wait, what had just happened?  Had he really said that?  He had just been trying to get Draco to talk to him.  He knew he should go and apologize right now, but he was just too heart sore.  He planned to talk to Draco when he got home that night.
Once there he filled Bill and Fleur in on the situation.  He sent a Patronus to Molly and Arthur, and one to Narcissa as well.  He wasn’t sure if he sent one to Draco, how he would respond.  He asked Narcissa to let Draco know he was wanted at the Hospital too.  He, then, apparated to St. Mungo’s.
Draco cut him off, “Mother is waiting, Potter.”  He stepped back and motioned with his arm toward the interior of the room.
“I did though,” Potter replied quietly, finally lifting his head and meeting Draco’s gaze, sadness and resignation flickering in his green eyes.
Draco was saved from making a stumbling reply by the loud pop that brought Dilly to join them in the chamber. “Harry Potter is finally being here!” she announced before moving over to grab onto Potter’s free hand. “Dilly is being so relieved.” She beamed at Potter before looking him over and then turning to look accusingly over at Draco. “Harry Potter is being undressed, Master Draco! Harry Potter should be having clothes! Master Draco cannot keep Harry Potter undressed!”
“Sorry,” he mumbled as he rolled over onto Malfoy’s bed and got out of bed that way.  They walked together over to the screen and then Harry went to the other side of it.  They dressed quickly, each anxious to hear what Dumbledore had to tell them.
Harry knew his mouth had fallen open in confusion, but Draco was still covering his eyes so it didn’t really matter.  He sat up and scrubbed both his hands through his hair in frustration.  “What the hell, Draco?  That makes no sense.  You wanted to stay . . . so you left me every night?”
He had just lowered his wand and turned to walk out when a powerful white light pierced the room, blinding Draco. A fierce wind roared through the chamber and whipped at Draco’s robes causing him to raise his arms protectively.
Harry missed rooming with his Gryffindor friends, of course, but this new arrangement was working out better than he could have hoped.  It turned out that Blaise was funny and he treated Harry just like a regular bloke.  Ernie was mostly gone from their room studying, so Harry and Blaise were left to be as ridiculous as they pleased, often accompanied by Ron.  Neville had been nervous to room with Malfoy, but he had relaxed after the first week.  Neville had reported to Harry that Malfoy was surprisingly quiet and tidy, and didn’t seem inclined to bother anyone.
During the silence that greeted Harry’s revelation, the door to the hospital room swung open and Hermione walked through.  When she saw that Draco was awake and sitting up, she rushed over to his side.  “Draco!  Thank God you’re awake!” she said, throwing her arms around him and getting as close as her big belly would allow.  “The baby will be so happy to hear her Papa’s voice again!”
Harry was subdued as he washed and changed for bed.  In an effort to feel closer to him, he decided to sleep on Draco’s side of the bed.  Eventually, he fell into a restless sleep.
Suddenly he felt flush and his heart sped up.  “Is it . . . is it getting hot in here?”  Harry pulled at the collar of his t-shirt.  Something must be wrong with the heating system all of a sudden.  He looked back over at Malfoy, his lips were pink and slightly parted.  Harry felt warm again and ripped his shirt over his head and tossed it over the side of the bed.
Hoping that Draco was poisoning him, Harry kept his eyes closed but lifted his head just enough to drink the contents of the bottle.  When he finished he thrust the empty bottle back towards Draco and flopped back onto the bed.  After a minute his head eased and his stomach settled.  “Hangover potion?” he spoke with his eyes still closed.
“Yeah, right!  Hermione would have a fit if I owned a house elf,” tired of standing, Harry sat down on the couch.  He winced and then removed a dirty baby bottle and a teddy bear out from underneath himself.
“You are so fucking gorgeous!  Do you have any idea?”  Harry lay back and slid his right hand down to cup his prick through his trousers.  He groaned at the sensation and watched as Draco’s mouth fell open.  It felt good to give his cock some relief, but it wasn’t enough.  He quickly unfastened his flies and thrust his hand inside of his pants.  He groaned again when his fingers closed around his throbbing erection.  Watching Draco as he stroked his prick.
“I do have some good news though,” Bill said brightly, trying to lift their spirits.  “I have developed the counter-curse and I will be able to sever the bond.”  He smiled and looked very pleased with himself.
Harry’s heart ached in a good way and he held Draco tighter to him, then they got back to the important business of showing each other their love.
Both boys nodded at this and Harry was reminded once again about how many experiences they both shared.  Bill grimaced and then continued, “This may be a progressive curse.”
Draco’s brow wrinkled and he gave a small frown, “Harry, as you have pointed out many times, we are already married.  What are you doing?”  Draco tried to use their joined hands to pull Harry up to his feet.
