Shedding his outer clothes until he was down to but trousers and a dress-shirt, Harry grinned, "Hermione cast the wards, Ron the wizard's space. The circle is done in parselmagic I learned in South America, Brazil, if I remember correctly, or Bolivia, I'm not exactly sure."
Not taking his eyes off his panting vassal, the young wizard picked up his wand and ordered the shocked Narcissa and Draco, "Please, leave us."
Claiming the book, Harry found it to be a work on experimental potions. Looking up surprised, Draco merely shrugged, "I like potions. The youngest Potion's Master in Britain was my godfather after all."
A cold, deep voice had him pull his wand instinctively. "How dare you invade our dungeons, Gryffindor?"
"What an idiot!" Hermione remarked, before taking off her robe and hovering it towards the wardrobe. "Alright, let's see what we've got."
"I … we … in the muggle world, you would have to take off the roof and build up brick by brick. And you have to make sure that the lower part of the house is strong enough to … ahm … sustain the extra weight, I guess? Or maybe that's the earth underneath? I thought that something like that would … I don't know … destroy the essence of the house? Voiding all wards and enchantments? Basically, make Grimmauld Place crumble down around us?"
"Certainly," taking a composed sip of tea, the young witch started to lay out her thoughts. "Tough you are quite … tied up at the moment, you are still next in line to the Malfoy Lordship. Your name carries weight in our world. Maybe not so much at the moment, but you and your father have aligned yourselves with the Potter-Black Family. Since I do not see that changing any time soon, you will regain a part of the power and influence your father has amassed before the war."
"I know," the older witch walked over and pulled her nephew into her arms, while the younger Mdm Pince explained. "We were aware that us disappearing would cause complications. But we considered the risk worth the gain. And with the time-turner, we were able to speed up the research process considerably. We are nearly there, but if I say that this has to play out, we won't travel back in time to keep you from finding us once again."
"We are here to access my parents' vault." Harry's voice was barely above a whisper, yet the goblin seemed to understand him just fine, turning around. Studying the three, he then instructed, "In that case, follow me, Mr Potter. There is a lot we have to talk about."
Laughing, because his little raven-haired brother could not be more wrong, the twin shook his head empathically. "I was ecstatic! You have to understand. Freddie and I were tricksters, pranking people left and right, bullshitting our way out of trouble. But when we were alone, we were always honest with each other. Fred said what I needed to hear because apart from you last night, nobody ever dared to call me out on the shit I have done. Not even Lee, and while he gave me massive pointers, he always makes sure not to come between my family and me.
Since Severus was currently taking another sip, he merely gestured, and Harry called out, "Come in, Draco."
Cornered, looking at the damning smoke in confusion, the witch gestured behind herself. "In the kitchen, but I only have a wine-cellar, and … there is just a wine cellar down there."
"You will have to go out eventually," Harry interpreted Draco's unease, as the blond watched the front door with trepidation.
Turning back towards the window to stare into the garden without actually seeing anything, the raven-haired whispered, "It's wrong … so very wrong, I know that. But I can't seem to help myself. I wish I could merely see him as a friend, but …"
Either this would work, with her sister and her son and her nephew by her side, or her cousin Sirius would forever be banned from the family. Looking into the young Harry Potter's eyes, she slowly pulled the wand from his fingers. Failure was not an option.
Putting down his own cup, he gestured towards the coffee he had chosen for Lucius. "Do you like it?"
Slipping off her shoes again, stretching out between the armchairs, Andromeda replied sadly, "And I don't think he even likes his job very much. But what part of the house is resisting him? He has lived here ever since his 17
"To have a spouse that is proud of your accomplishments, instead of jealous. Most purebloods, the marriages are arranged, and with most of the couples, the husband and wife try to best one another at every given opportunity. Mother and father, do it again, though to a lesser degree. I doubt that Lucius is aware of how much his wife narrows down his options, whenever they meet with the other purebloods. I think in our society, few notice, how much is going on between the wives when they meet for 'tea'." He made air-quotes before glancing at the door Ron had disappeared through. "But your friends … they are good together. There seems never to be any struggle between them."
Going over the available healers, Harry imagined that not one of them would want to treat Lucius Malfoy. They would, of course, because their oath demanded it, but with great reluctance at best. Molly Weasley was the next that came to mind. As a mother of seven, she certainly knew how to treat dirty scratches. Yet, considering the animosity between Arthur Weasley and Lucius Malfoy, Harry did not want to put her in a position where she had to care for someone, who insulted her husband on a regular basis.
Coincidentally, father and son shared the same plight, though Draco's day could not have been more different from Lucius'. Sleeping with Potter had definitely helped for a part of the night, but around five a.m., Draco had shot up from the bed, panting, memories of the Dark Lord drowning him. Not wanting to disturb his companion, he had slipped out of the of the room. After an extensive shower - where he had tried to wash off the stench of that snake-faced bastard - had retreated to his new laboratory.
"That's right because no matter how sneaky you think you are, you would have never made it in the House of the Snakes." She sneered, whacking him over the head with a scroll.
When the pair disappeared through the flames, Charles gapped, "Did he just connect the most secretive library in the entire kingdom to the house of a convict?"
With sure movements, Harry used a cup to pour water over Severus' head and started massaging in shampoo. After a quick rinse, a spicy smelling conditioner followed. The Potion Master all but melted under the ministrations and managed to ask after his hair was cleaned. "Where have you learned to … wash hair so … expe… proffer…." Growling he started again, "Where have you learned … to wash some…one's hair."
"Ten seconds later than the last time you have asked. Honestly, Draco, you need to calm down. You are getting splotchy." Harry replied exasperated.
"You know, it will be a little hard to identify the plates without light. Could you maybe supply some illumination? Even a small oil-lamp would help. Oh, and I find it rather chilly and uncomfortable." She purposefully rubbed her belly, before inquiring innocently, "Do you think you might be able to do something about that? Only if you won't get into trouble, of course."
Looking back, the Pendragon nodded. "You are right, of course. Lady Malfoy, gentlemen, would you please follow me?"
Shrugging, the young man admitted, "It's not as if it wasn't predictable that he would do all that. After the battle … everyone was clamouring for my attention, even a few goblins because of the Black and Potter vaults. But every time Griphook and I crossed paths, he just … he insulted and belittled me even for my lack of economic and financial understanding. So, I thought … well, at least with him I know where I stand. He of all people would be honest with me."
"No," Harry joined Neville, "But if they have entered their own libraries, we might be able to pick up on that."
Hanging his head, as if it was his fault personally, Kreacher shook his head. "No, Master Snape, Kreacher will go and smash his fingers in the oven now."
"Lord … Harry, even a blind witch can see how much you love Draco. I did not need to witness the kiss to know that. But losing your heart to a pureblood comes at a price. And if you love them enough, you are willing to pay it. Because contradicting what they had been brought up to believe, would only lead to heartache and pain. I don't want that for Astoria, and I doubt you want it for your dragon."
Nodding, Charles confirmed that. "It seems probable. And having gained her blond prize, it seems unlikely for her not to make use of him. Evidently, she's been after him since Yule."
Hesitantly raising his face, cautiously pushing back from the table, Harry opened and closed his mouth a few times, not getting out a word. The look he gave Neville left the impression of a deer in the headlights.
"Talking, I guess. It's long overdue anyway." Nicking half a treat, much to his friend's dismay, Harry clutched his heart when a voice stated from behind him, "This is tiny and won't do!"
"Me can do it!" the little child bounced, clapping her hands. "Bestest white-flower tea will be served in a minute Harry-Master-Sir."
"So that's the real reason for this request," Pince smirked triumphant, "You might have the husband and son on the leash, but you are terrified of what the Lady might do, if she has too much time on her hands."
Studying his former pupil, Severus nodded after a few moments. "Good, then let us return to the matter at hand. I think Mr Manson and Mr Welsh are on to something. Yet their research on plant-based core-strengthening potions is rushed and - let us be honest - incredibly sloppy. I would advise them to look into mineral bases. Maybe even animal ones. Feathers of an Occamy, combined with powdered Lapis Lazuli might help to align newly concentrated magical powers. An amethyst thrown into the cauldron at the beginning of the brewing process could increase the strength of the potion overall. Maybe even serve as a focus for the squib later on."
Wandering through the corridors of Hogwarts with the Marauder's Map - thankfully the headmistress had given them free rein - she wanted her librarian back almost as desperately as her OWL and NEWT students did - Neville teased, "Who came up with the book idea? Admit it, you did not think of that yourself."
Draco enjoyed her company, jumping at the chance to dust off his French. They were laughing in the back-garden, where Fleur currently sketched out a motive for her next picture when all of a sudden, a vicious growl interrupted their conversation. While Draco froze and slowly turned around, lowering his eyes the moment he recognised William Weasley, Fleur beamed and approached her snarling husband. The blond's impulses were at war. On the one hand, he definitely wanted to reach out, and pull the fragile girl to safety; on the other, even half a step forward made the growling even more intense. Torn between not provoking a predator but protecting an innocent, Draco could only hover indecisively. What concerned him even more, was Fleur not giving the slightest indication of being afraid or even slightly hesitant to hug the clearly agitated man, nipping at his chin playfully. The growling stopped, and Draco dared to raise his eyes.
With a soft smile, because for the first time, someone recited the original tale, Harry explained, "Well, there is a little more to it, than that. Are you aware that the Potters are descendants of Ignotius Peverel?"
"Teddy," Harry interrupted the beginning of a tirade. "Please go to the kitchen and ask Kreacher for some snacks for the trip."
"Of course not," Molly Weasley bustled. "Just go into the living-room. This Sunday it's only Lucius and Narcissa, and Hermione and Ron. And they are playing on that computer-thing again. It seems to be great fun."
"From that day on, I came to you nearly every evening. Talking about … nothing really, since not a lot was happening these days. I was just …"
Laughing out loud, Harry shook his head, "You could not be more wrong. Their fights are epic! They are on their third set of dish wear already, since their wedding."
He ended the spell, once the table had room for four people, instead of fourteen, the dishes now evenly distributed on the polished surface. With an absent-minded gesture, Harry banished the other chairs to the back of the dining room before inviting his guests, "Please, take your seats."
Sinking down in his chair, hiding his face in a giggly Teddy's paling hair, who was clinging to him like a limpet as to not slide to the floor, Harry growled, "You are enjoying this."
Kneeling in front of the boy, Harry studied the pendant, before shaking his head. "Not at all, cub. I think Draco would love this pendant very much."
"Ladies, gentleman, Auror Pince, I apologise for being late. I was held up at the office," the Minister of Magic mentioned joining them. Hermione took the chance to ease him. "We have only just begun. Neville was just bringing us up to speed. There is fresh coffee over there and Ron brought bagels, but pay attention, some of them might turn your hair blue."
Nobody said a word until the door had fallen shut. Severus tried, but nothing came out. Thinking of something to say to someone he had not talked to in over twenty years was hard enough. But facing the memory, the impression of a soul that had seen him at his lowest, not once but twice was … where should he even start to redeem himself?
be like this! She was her own person, with ideas and convictions, born and raised to lead rather than to follow. She had been ready to meet him head-on, should he ever try to subdue her. Not only had Lucius accepted that he had fallen in love with the fierce and spirited middle daughter of the Black family, earning her respect in return. The day of her bonding, they had sworn to fight for their love and to support and cherish each other, all days of their life.
"Well," the blond rose and neatened his sleeves. "In that case, I will go and find out how I can be of service. Excuse me, please."
Sadly, the only thing he had learned until now, beyond the shadow of a doubt, was that Harry considered the needs and wishes of
Now that yet another adult knew of his survival, Severus' social circle was expanded yet again. Since his health had improved considerably, Emilia Nightingale had cut back on her hours, only visiting on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Now blessedly alone for hours at a time, the Potion Master needed but a month to catch up on the last five years of research and go over the catalogue of Flourish and Blotts to make a list of recent publishments in his field. He had yet to decide upon an area of interest, found the general overview too superficial for his liking.
century. Yes, of course, muggles are dangerous, but they won't be any less so if we continue to ignore them. The Statue of Secrecy is important! Now more than ever. But it should not be used as an excuse for ignorance. Integrating magical children into our world as soon as possible is certainly a good way to further understanding. Let muggle-born and purebloods learn from each other. No matter if they teach each other about gaming consoles or scrying. But consider demanding oaths from their parents to keep our secret."
"Draco?" When his godfather demanded his attention, the blond turned towards him. "I am, by no means, an expert, but I think you would make a very good father. And though I abhor small, sniffling and leaking children, I would be willing to offer my support if needed."
Looming over the elf, Narcissa Malfoy enunciated very clearly, "Why are the artefacts of this house not working properly for their Master? Tell me the truth!"
He had started, but she had turned around and had hugged him close. "I'm sorry, Georgie, I'm so incredibly sorry. I thank Merlin and Morgana every day that you survived The Battle unharmed, and I should have never let you believe otherwise." Caressing his face, Molly kissed her son's face and assured him, "I'm eternally grateful that you are here with us and I apologise that I let you believe otherwise, even for a second. I miss your brother every day, but I still love you more than I will ever be able to express."
"Can't sleep?" Handing over a cup of coffee, Harry scooted closer to Ron, so his friend could wrap his heavy quill around them both. The early morning was biting cold. From their position on the veranda, the two young men could overlook the garden. The last rays of the moon illuminated it, the sun not yet making an appearance but lapping at the horizon. The scene seemed quite serene.
"Yes, Uncle Sev," Draco replied breathless, opening the second book he had brought with trembling fingers, reading in a somewhat wet voice, to tide over his emotions. "There was a law in the city of Athens which gave to its citizens the power of compelling their daughters to marry whomsoever they pleased; …"
, you mean." Charlie corrected Draco, weaving his wand over the blond to clean and straighten his attire. "The little Miss here, only ate what Draco provided."
Despite her parents being convicted Death Eaters, Daphne had put a lot of work into earning her place in the Inquisition Squad, and while Harry did not necessarily like her, he respected her devotion and never-ending effort to find the truth.
Together, they went over the floo activity of the last three days from the Manor and Grimmauld Place.
Black dragon-leather unfolded from the oversized package, Molly placed on her daughter's lap. Trousers, a vest and bracers and a helm spilt from the box. Amazed, Ginny shook out the gear. "Wow, that's incredibly strong."
"Don't be," Narcissa replied easily, letting him go. Preparing everything she would need to treat her husband's minor wounds, she reminded him, "You have put a heavy burden on your shoulders today. It is expected of you to need support on occasion. And as I said before, I would be honoured to offer it."
"Certainly. I doubt that the male representatives of the Malfoy family will stay in debt forever. Not with Lord Potter-Black as their liege. But even if they do, as a member of your family I expect your husband to support any financial investments I want to make and your son and yourself any social aspirations I have. Even while bound yourself, when married to your heir, I could be your pass into our high society. Through me, you could gain influence and power."
"And you are better back around eleven. I want us to go over everything we know one more time before we depart."
"Kingsley might be aware," Harry admitted. "But I'm not entirely sure. He looked at me rather strangely all through the ceremony, where he gave me the Order of Merlin 2
Rolling his eyes, Draco revealed. "It's the exact same thing we say. The language is just different. It's all about really wanting it, remember? You just have to believe for it to come true. Like with your hair. It is as easy as that."
Drooping, the raven-haired looked at his bushy-haired friend. Since it was after hours, she had freed her hair from the professional knot she wore during the day, now using her hair barrette as a shimmering ornament. She looked so much like her younger self - the witch who had brewed Polyjuice in a girl's bathroom - that it hurt to look at her. Why could he not go back to those simpler times, where his most significant problem had been the gossip of Hogwarts? Well, actually, it had not been the gossip but the fifty-foot basilisk in the walls. His life had never been easy. His problems had just shifted. Straightening, he nodded, "Alright, let's work our way up from the inheritance vaults and end with James and Lily Potter's family vault."
Carefully balancing the tray of pies, the Lady closed the bracelet and tilted her head. "In that case, we will be honoured."
For a moment the former Lord looked at his liege, before taking another sip and returning to work. Still, after a few minutes, he gazed up and studied the young man, who seemed lost in Granger's transcription of yesterday's interview. Potter had had no compunction of claiming a part of the oversized desk for himself and was taking notes diligently. It was rare for Lucius to have someone look after him. His mother had cared of course but had bent to the rules of his overly demanding father. Narcissa had taken up caring for his well−being, as was expected of a dutiful wife. But Harry Potter, though his liege, should feel no according compulsion to watch out for Lucius. Of course, he was of more use if he was healthy and fit. But not being able to stomach something was hardly a terminal illness. Yet the young man had not only shown concern for his physical but his emotional well−being as well. No matter how he thought of it, the pureblood could not determine why.
Thinking back to Hogwarts Harry realised that he had never seen a single picture in the Potion Master's office or classroom. Still, "What makes you think that I will dictate your décor?"
"Watch it, ferret," the redhead insulted on autopilot, holding out a sterilised vial with shaking hands, while Draco forced his trembling fingers to still long enough to use a glass pipette to extract the clear drop they had separated from the blood and sealed it in.
Swallowing down the pain of seeing his little should-be-brother like that, Fred forced a cocky smile. "Since we're all up to speed, you can end the call now, oh, chosen one. Just remember, we're always there, and we love you. All of us."
Scratching the back of his neck, Ron looked at his former professor hopefully, until the man confirmed. "Yes." After a moment, Snape pondered, "Harry Potter is just one Auror. He cannot change the world."
"I know what you mean, Hermione," Harry assured her, squeezing her hand for comfort. "But we are Aurors. In most cases we work, peoples' lives are at stake. And that makes every last case damn personal!" Pushing away his tray, Harry stood to leave, but his best friend held him back. He noticed the faraway look in her eyes that usually meant that her brain was in overdrive. Glancing at the watch, he decided that he could give her a few moments. With Hermione, it was usually worth it.
Smiling at that approach, Neville rose from the couch and held out his hand. "Well, we might need an expert for that."
Reluctant, the young man heaved himself out of the chair. Since he felt ready to topple over, he merely offered a weak, "Good Night, Sir … I mean Severus and thank you."
At the panicked look of the young woman, he raised his hand, interrupting her frantic, "Nobody can know!" with a calm, "Nobody will. Narcissa is bound to me by proxy, as you are certainly aware. If I tell her to keep what's going on a secret, she will. But I need a diagnostic and you need healing. She is the closest thing to a mediwitch I can provide without making this official. You know that every healer would be forced to report this."
Only now, standing at the window of his home, having the slimmer pureblood clawing at him to keep them close, Harry realised how deep the hurt in the Malfoy family really went. He had grown up feeling useless … like a freak. But at least on some level, at the back of his head, he had always known that he did not deserve that kind of treatment. Well, maybe not as a kid, but when he had finally attended Hogwarts, Harry had realised that what his aunt and uncle had done to him had been unjustified and wrong. Now, he wondered how it had felt to be shunned and looked down upon, for a decision you had once made in good faith … in the hope of doing what was right for the people most important to you.
"That's great!" Luna beamed brightly. "Draco needs more friends to keep the Wacklspurts away." Then she wandered off, to where Charlie was talking to the blond.
But Severus seemed to catch up on Harry's idea. "Not the Malfoy Family, but their home. If I pay rent for their Potions Lab, could I use their home as an establishment, until I find something else?"
"Yes!" Draco exclaimed, then shook his head, reverently browsing through the pages. "No, … it's complicated. I could brew some of these. Others I would have to work my way up to. But in here are recipes for potions like >The Draught of the Living Dead<. You can't give me access to such concoctions!"
Glancing down at his former pupil, the older wizard wanted to know, "What boundaries can you imagine Draco putting on his future wife?"
Claiming both bottles, Astoria tilted her head gratefully. "Thank you, Draco. I'm …," but before she could offer debt or something similar, she caught herself. She was in no position to make promises, right now, so she merely repeated. "I am very grateful."
Two more days of resting, with Draco more or less sitting on him and the Malfoys working from Grimmauld Place did all of them some good. Due to the frequent naps, the blond managed to grab by Harry's side, and Lucius being given a chance to prove his devotion, the two Malfoys seemed less drawn and fearful whenever they were around their liege.
Every other day, Harry was tasked with getting updates from Malfoy Manor. And though he basically could not understand a single word, everyone involved appeared more excited as days went on. By now, the hopeful mood seemed to hit the young Auror the moment he entered the Manor, leaving him in high spirits for the rest of the day.
For the next few hours, Harry discussed plans and listened to the goblins' input. Spells were cast, and wards were analysed. At one point, another expert had to be fetched, since no one was overly familiar with parselwards. In the end, it was decided that Gringotts could take care of all renovations, wards included, for a very reasonable price. Harry thanked the goblins and told them he would await their official offer. Pleasure doing business with you. May your gold ever flow. Etc. Etc. Etc.
"Six people," Lucius sighed, sinking into one of the chairs before the fireplace. "And you let the entire wizarding world grieve for him."
child, I have met like this was Draco." Trading a marvelling look with his godson, he inquired," how do you know that it will be a boy?" Pre-natal care in the wizarding world was still rather rudimentary, compared to muggle means.
"Yes," the young Lady explained politely. "It is no secret that my late husband and I did not agree on a lot of things."
And once again, the complex rules of wizarding society had tangled Harry up in knots, beyond his understanding. One thing, however, was crystal clear to the young Lord. There would never be a woman by his side to claim that title. He had had his shot with Ginny and though he had loved her … loved her still, the mere idea of having another witch living with him, sharing his bed, was unimaginable. So, the only thing left to do, was to offer a respectful bow and the indication of a kiss to Narcissa's healed hand. "I think, until Teddy choses a wife, it will be my honour if you laid claim to that title, Lady Malfoy."
"None," Pince snapped. "Honestly, Potter, we have been over this. Do pay attention. This case is important!"
Coldly, Harry looked at his former professor. "Well, you 'insinuated' that you were Tom's loyal servant for years, and we all saw how that turned out."
Pained, Lily had turned towards her husband. "I knew I should have talked to Alice. Sirius was always a little too hot-headed. Don't get me wrong, I loved him, but the Longbottoms clearly would have been the better guardians."
"This is the second time you got injured this season," Ginny berated, supporting Harry to take the potions Draco had provided, before helping him undress to take a bath with herbal remedies that ought to soothe his body so he could sleep. "And it's the beginning of February!"
Leaning over the exhausted figure, caging him by placing his hands right next to the shackled arms of the Death Eater, the young Auror whispered into his ear, “Because I have your son. Draco pledged his freedom to me for the mere attempt to get you out. So, no matter the outcome, your boy is mine to do with as I please.” Chuckling darkly, he continued, “And Narcissa, your beautiful, strong wife, is struggling as it is. Always hungry, locked in a mansion where insanity reigned for too long. How much time before she follows in the footsteps of her sister Bellatrix and simply relinquishes her hold on sanity without you?”
Aware that there was no choice but to comply, he summed up his last few years in a dry tone to get this over with, "Nagini bit me on Voldemort's command. Harry and his friends found me. I gave our 'Saviour' one last memory before I closed my eyes. Ms Granger, thinking fast on her feet as always, put me in stasis, saving my life. The trio, together with Minerva and Poppy, put me into a prolonged magical coma, winning time to research anti-venoms to cure me upon waking."
Throwing down his quill, Harry glared, "So it is better to spend your life with someone you hate than to bring 'shame' on your family or be talked about behind your back?"
Jumping to the right conclusion, the Head Auror stated, "An item you can look for, given you know the right spell."
James, however, had laughed amused, "Your first business venue as a grown-up was your friend's joke shop?"
After a moment of hesitation, Harry nodded. It was better to go into the first day of the new year together.
Surprised, his father confirmed, "Yes. We were out running, barely three weeks after your birth. Yet, Moony constantly tried to loop back to the house. When Padfoot and I finally allowed it, he approached your window and curled up beneath it."
"I know," Neville interrupted calmly. "But now is not the time to go into that. Harry cares for both of them; is connected to both of them. But to make use of that connection, he needs to calm down!"
Narrowing her eyes, Daphne turned around and put on a content face, "I guess there is that, Mr Fairchild. Why don't you return to the Ministry and I will stay and investigate - with Auror Potter's assistance - why we have so many false warnings."
Searching the group, finding the Hogwarts librarian healthy and whole, Daphne relaxed noticeably. "I see you have found your abducted librarians."
Returning to his breakfast, he did not notice the proud look Lucius and Narcissa shared. They had always known their son to possess an extraordinary mind. It was good to see someone else acknowledge that.
"Do you remember what happened to the second brother?" The raven-haired wizard asked out of the blue.
Rolling her eyes, Daphne explained, "You can cast a trace on the wizard that transfers to his wand as soon as he touches it. As for how I got the scroll? After the 'investigation' at Malfoy Manor, I… liberated Draco's file from our archives."
With a gentle smile, Harry stepped up to the comatose man’s bedside and gently brushed a strand of dark hair out of his face. “Just like mum would be proud of you,” he whispered before adding in a slightly hoarse voice, “Good night, Sir.”
Of course, intellectually, he knew that she must have spiked his drink. But emotionally, he dared not face the off chance of 'what if'. What if he was actually as sick as she had suggested? What if he … his body, enjoyed being hurt? The very thought made him sick. Sure, Astoria might act all calm and understanding, but would she keep her offer, if he turned out to be a depraved person, who got off on being hurt? And Harry, their pure 'Saviour' … he would be disgusted with Draco if these desires proved to be true. Cowering in the middle of the room, the pureblood needed all of his composure to keep himself from sobbing. He certainly did not want to do his make-up a fourth time!
Whipping around, only Harry's seeker reflexes kept the display case, where the wands were stored, from being toppled over. Breathlessly, he asked, "What? But how … who?"
As soon as the last syllable had left his mouth, magic started to congeal in the room, making it hard to breathe. The power they had conjured, combined with the countless useless attempts of Harry and Narcissa before them, sunk into the fabric. It felt like their spell was fighting with the intricate magic of the carpet and, on instinct, Narcissa reached behind herself when it peaked. Offering the spool with the golden thread she had used so liberally before; the power seemed to reach out for it, making it dance within her grip. After a few moments, the thread began to unravel and wave into the green carpet, forming leaf that simply read 'Sirius'.
Neville was not around yet, so Harry had time to update his personal files. Right after starting this job, he had created summaries on all known Death Eaters and their families, as well as other witches and wizards he had known to play a part in Voldemort's ranks. Once he had told Hermione about them - she had struggled with one of her first cases at the time - his best friend had thrown words like 'witch trials', 'circumstantial evidence' and 'innocent until proven guilty' at his head. And though Harry had known her to be right - you could not condemn someone without proof - he had kept updating these files diligently. Maybe these witches and wizards were still considered 'innocent' since nobody had been able to pin any wrongdoings on them. But all Harry needed was for them to make one mistake, and he would bring their perfect world down on their heads, locking them away in Azkaban for the rest of their lives.
"No, I didn't," the witch replied evenly, showing not the slightest hint of a bad conscience. "I discussed it with your caretaker."
Dragging his fingers through his hair, receiving a stinging hex for his troubles and a wave of magic that put his hairstyle back in place, Harry sighed. "I haven't thought of that."
Finally looking up from some documents, Kingsley smiled and rose when the door opened, and Hermione came in with a tea-tray, followed by Ron who carried plates stacked high with sandwiches and biscuits. "Waiting for my tea, as Mr Malfoy has so eloquently stated."
dangerous example to set, and Hermione was determined to solve it! Yet, with George by her side, him calmingly putting a hand on her shoulder in an implied offer of support, she unwound a bit and was able to take a steadying breath. She was not alone in this. Like all the times before when there had been trouble, she had her friends and family by her side, so they would solve this puzzle, without the shadow of a doubt!
Unexpectedly, Severus interrupted the two quibblers. "You should keep in mind, Mr Longbottom, that Sirius Black, despite being the last owner of this house, did not possess that knowledge either. He had - after all - been cast from his family before coming of age."
Shrugging, Harry admitted, "To be honest, I have no clue, since we do not know how much venom we can extract from one dose."
Rolling his eyes, Neville mounted his own, chestnut−coloured horse. "I better follow them. If anybody spots them without a ministry entourage, they could get into trouble."
One week of enforced 'sick leave', though fortunately, no member of my family is sick. We are slowly getting used to the isolation. Fortunately, the three of us get along pretty well and everybody tries to do his and her best to make this entire situation bearable. Austria might be a small country, but I guess all of us are scared and we don't want to risk spreading this virus any further. Even when my son and I are shopping for my in-laws, we try to keep our distance. Three more weeks and then we will see.
It turned out quite an ordeal to wrap the piece of leather around the little fox's neck. Mostly because she seemed to like it and wanted to smell it and chew on it regularly. Harry and Draco could not help but laugh at her frolicking. Even Narcissa managed a small but honest smile.
When Draco handed them over a minute later, Severus threw them into the antidote and gave three last stirs clockwise with the glass ladle, then five counter-clockwise before reducing the flames to mere flickers that lapped over the bottom of the cauldron. Looking at his fidgeting godson, he demanded to know, "What is it?"
"Well," putting down his sandwich, the young Auror rose and approached their evidence wall. "We know that they have these volumes," he gestured at the books missing. "But what if they have picked up or bought more?"
Sweat covered the older wizard's forehead when he was finished. Even Harry was swaying slightly. However, they had been successful in containing the spell. Now it was up to the wards to be strong enough to dispel it.
After a complicated spell to trace the magic that emerged from the tip of the vine wood wand, Leewood confirmed, "The wand and the spell carry the same magical signature."
"Why … why are you telling me that?" Draco breathed. This felt like too much, too intimate. Nobody should know these things in case they would use them against Harry. In the past, less personal information had been used to paint the 'Boy Who Lived' a disturbed and dangerous person. The blond did not even want to think about what the media could do with knowledge of Harry's abusive childhood.
Draco suffered through the night, by starring at the ceiling of his room, trying to discover when exactly his loyalties had shifted, prioritising Potter's emotional wellbeing over that of his family. That moment had to have happened since there was no other explanation to have taken Potter's concerns more seriously than his father's, still, he could not find it. Lucius was undoubtedly suffering, but the idea of him attacking Harry again made Draco think that he deserved the punishment his liege had heaped on his head. How horrible of a son was he?
"Nope," Harry shook his head, instinctively reaching for his wand when Nott pulled out his own, waving it over Draco, who suddenly stood in but his pants in the middle of the living-room.
Setting down her cup, Astoria visibly composed herself, before she started in a quiet tone, "Yesterday, at 7 p.m. my husband and I had dinner, as is our habit. At 7:30 p.m. sharp, we retired to the master bedroom. I think he fell asleep around 10:40 p.m."
As expected, he found Draco hunched over the desk, drooling onto the booklist he was composing. With a small gesture, Harry spelled away the wetness, so the words were pristine again, gently touching the blond. When Draco instinctively leaned into the touch, like a cat asking to be petted, Harry brushed over his cheek with the back of his fingers.
"True," Pince agreed. "But before we start that project, we redo the inventory. Get up, people, you all know your assigned libraries. We'll meet again in 24 hours and compare our findings. Chop. Chop."
"Your jumper was the first item anybody gave me that actually fit," Harry recalled, gesturing at the red piece of wool, with the Gryffindor Lion.
The two young wizards traded a glance, before Neville offered, "And I would be alright with you watching me, Sir. If you are interested."
"Why is that of any concern? It is not like the laws are at fault." Andromeda wanted to know, before reaching for her grandson to help him prick his crème brûlée. "Like that, love, just a brief tap!" She smiled when Teddy dug into his favourite dessert. Only when she looked up, did she realise that everybody was staring at her. "Yes?"
"It's a bloody nightmare," Ron groused, cutting up a root with the precision of a surgeon. "One stir into the wrong direction or thirty seconds too long on simmer and we are back at the beginning."
It being really early, and Snape being exhausted at that point, had made him stumble, just three steps away from the bottom. It could have been a nasty fall, but he had had worse over the years. What he had not expected, had been the railing rearing up and a decorative snake wrapping around his lower arm.
Lighting up like a child on Christmas morning, the blond swallowed the last sip of his tea, before asking respectfully, "May I be excused from the table?"
"I don't know, Sir," Neville admitted. "We did everything according to plan. My preliminary analysis indicate that everything went right. The spell has taken."
All three Malfoys gasped when two trembling house elves entered the parlour, crates of supplies hovering between them.
True, their patient looked ready to droop, but when the blond opened his mouth to suggest him going to bed, he was cut off before he could even start, with a determined, "Don't even think about it. Just help me to my office."
With a tired sigh, the Lady Malfoy started, "We could go over it in detail, but what you really want to know is how long Astoria has before the damage becomes irreversible."
"Harry?" Hermione's quiet voice had pulled the boys out of their conversation. "I think you should see this."
"Do we have an expert on Unicorns?" Harry wanted to know, weaving his wand over the mess he had made and cleaned up his desk at the same time.
Surprised by the unexpected anger, Lucius lowered his eyes and hunched his shoulders. "Apologies, Master."
With forced smiles on their faces, the two young wizards entered the living-room. And while Narcissa greeted them with an indulgent smile, Arthur merely called a greeting into their general direction, before they continued his and Lucius' battle on the computer screen. The platinum-blond, however, seemed a little more subdued. Respectfully he nodded in Harry's direction but clearly forced himself not to get up and greet his master properly. He knew that Harry considered the burrow his second home, not standing on formalities whenever he was here. Ron and Hermione, however, saw right through them. Allowing them to greet Draco's parents properly, they called out, "Come on, we have an idea for Inari's shack," guiding them behind the Burrow. The moment they were out of sight, Hermine pulled Draco into a comforting hug, while Ron did the same with their best friend.
Ron's words were like sandpaper, grating on Harry's oversensitive nerve endings. When he tried to turn away, he noticed that his head was resting on something soft. Oh, … Ginny's lap, that was nice. Her hands were keeping his head tilted to the side, gently caressing his hair. At least until the raven-haired tried to move, then they turned into steel clamps. An angry voice … Hermione … hissed under her breath, "Hold still, you fool, so I can stop the bleeding!"
Charles Leewood, however, seemed not amused. He glared the barrister down before he repeated, "The spell and the wand carry the same signature - as I have just explained: Yours!"
Draco stood frozen, going over the conversation that had just happened. He had never gotten to know this part of Harry. The part where his 'master' threw angry words at him and made empty threats. Of course, the threat had been empty, Draco tried to reassure himself. Harry would never take Inari from him. She was his familiar.
"Invaluable, in fact," Narcissa replied, watching the family that seemed to be becoming an extension of her own, with a hidden smile.
I don't know if I have mentioned it in any of my other stories, but until April 2017 I weighed about 280 pounds. Being 40 years old, I was expecting a life with diabetes and possible (likely) damaged joints when I was 60, so I decided something had to change. I went to the hospital and started preparing for stomach surgery. In July 2017 I went under and between 2017 and 2018 I lost around 130 pounds.
"That's your theory." The Auror pointed his spoon at her, only to put it down sheepishly when Narcissa looked at the offending cutlery with raised eyebrows. "Sorry," he mumbled, before picking up speed again, "The point is, we do not know anything for sure."
"Robarts talked to Jeanne de Ruilly, our contact in the French Auror Department and they caught the guys two days later. They were but purebloods with a grudge."
Of course, the 'Saviour of the Wizarding World' had drowned in his guilt, both for the loss of George's ear and of Fred during the Battle of Hogwarts. But George's chosen brother had made up for things that had never been his fault a hundred times over already, as the Weasley had explained to him after he had returned from his gap year.
A frightened whimper drew Harry's attention back to Astoria, who whispered tonelessly, "Alexio is a good husband. I should not have flirted with his colleague. It was my own fault. I just can't behave appropriately. It's my own mistake …"
It turned out that bringing someone back from the dead was child's play, compared to setting up a company, even with the help of Gringotts. Legal models had to be chosen, general terms and conditions agreed upon. And all had to be wrapped up in a nice little package, with a headquarter on top. Neither Harry nor Severus wanted Grimmauld Place on file, too content with the privacy a fading Fidelius Charm still offered. The idea of Spinners End made the Potion Master shudder. He wanted to go forward not back, and he had honestly despised the house for the majority of his life.
arrogant to his face. In retrospect, Charles had sounded a lot like Severus Snape that day. Maybe that had been the deciding factor for Harry to finally break. From all the people in the Auror Corps, aside from Robarts, Young had been the only one who had not treated him as if he were someone special, entitled to certain privileges, simply because he was fate's favourite toy.
Draco had come upstairs at Harry's shout but had stood back, as to not interrupt his godfather's inspection of the Teddy. Now he hovered just inside the bedroom-door, desperately trying to recall a way to neutralise wolfsbane pollen for a werewolf-cub. "Kreacher!"
Sipping from her tea, as if they were discussing the weather, the medi-witch inquired, "And what if it were not about making amends? What would you want to do if the world would not care?"
When Harry came back to himself, the stars were already up in the sky. He was clinging to his broom for dear life. He felt numb all over. His face was like ice, and when he tried to let go of the broom-handle, his fingers refused to cooperate. Blinking in confusion, wondering what had drawn his attention, as he still seemed to hover a hundred feet above the ground, he heard it again. A voice amplified by a 'Sonorus'.
"I am perfectly fine. Stressed and overworked at times, but that is to be expected in my position. I
A new concept, Draco had to admit. To have people to help him; not to cause mayhem, but to heal. This would need some getting used to. But still, Draco smiled and repeated, gazing at the sleeping raven. "Thank you."
"George!" she berated, slapping his chest. But the wizard only raised his eyebrows suggestively, making her laugh, despite the direness of the situation. What had just happened should be all but impossible. But someone had managed to cast a spell on her wand, even managed to get it to cast on its own. This was a
"It is completely safe!" The blond insisted. "I did my research, just like you taught me. Nothing in there is even remotely toxic and the reciprocal effects between the ingredients are neglectable."
"Draco!" Severus bellowed, barely able to keep himself from reaching for his throat, when pain flared up at his outburst.
Narcissa followed the request, and Lucius easily took Dominique, when Harry handed her over, leaving the young wizard free to pick up Lucy from Percy's lap and reach out for little Molly, who had curled up beside her mother.
"He was my Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher in third year. And curling up after finding me did not seem to be on his agenda. Though, in his defence, it was a rather stressful night."
His duty was to serve Potter. The other wizard had held up his end of the bargain; had saved his father from the Dementors and so much more. Despite their former rivalry, and fighting on different sides of the war, the 'saviour of the wizarding world' had made an effort to save Draco's family as well. No matter that he had owed them nothing after what the Malfoys had done to him and his friends. Draco had willingly accepted the mark of a madman, to protect his parents, serving Potter was nothing compared to that. He could set aside his own desires in favour of his new master.
Before the man could frown upon the childish moniker, Harry put a polaroid on the tray in front of him and instantly the warmth and comfort he had gotten from observing the easy banter between his godson and the boy he had sworn to protect on his best friend's behalf, was gone. Severus felt like he was freezing up from the inside out when he noticed the surroundings of the depiction of the - once again - free Lucius Malfoy. The man had been here, at Grimmauld Place, in the dining room Dumbledore had used for order meetings ever so often.
The water made Harry groan blissfully, offering a weak smile. When the hustle outside picked up again, he tried to sit up, but Hermione instantly pushed him back. "Narcissa …"
The following week consisted mostly of Harry commuting between the Ministry, the Manor and either very early or very late, Grimmauld Place. As soon as the young Auror had returned to work, he and Neville had gotten tied up in a new case. Some crazy wizards were conducting blood−sacrifices of muggle virgins as if they were still in the dark ages. The Auror Department was stretched thin between securing the crime−scenes and obliviating the local population and muggle authorities. Harry chugged down a swift cup of coffee in the mornings, flooed to the Manor − thank god, the imbeciles of Magical Law Enforcement had finally connected the two houses − went over any new developments concerning Lostrife with Mr Malfoy before rushing to work.
After four hours of intense interrogation - you had to give it to these elves, they were exceedingly persistent - Harry called Emerald away from Ruby. The other elf seemed close to tears, anyway. Not that the raven-haired felt any compassion. In his mind, the tiny elf was the only obstacle between him and Draco. But Emerald was getting frustrated and seemed ready to tackle her to get some answers. However, from Harry and Neville's point of view, Ruby was incapable of answering their-slash-Emerald's questions. Every time the elven child insinuated that she was neglecting her duties, Ruby tried to bash her head against the table, yet still refused to reveal Draco's location. Upon Harry's request, Emerald hopped off the table, where she had towered over the other elf, but allowed herself one cutting, parting remark, "Ruby is being a bad elf, and Mistress will surely give her clothes for allowing harm to come to Master-Draco-Sir!"
Tensing, the born Black witch gracefully sank to her knees in front of the floo. "Lady Longbottom, you have my undivided attention."
Ridding himself of his shoes and waistcoat, Lucius shook his head. "Not at all. It would be my privilege to offer comfort."
"Don't call me that!" Harry snapped. All of this, the house, this situation, the very air of the Manor was getting to him. So being called that particular honorific was just too much at the moment.
"Of course!" The boy exclaimed," We would want to make sure that you are okay!" Draco did not add to that. "Oh," the boy stated before wiggling out of his arms. "I can walk."
As they settled on the couch, James walked into the picture of a temple, surrounded by water. Harry had bought that particular piece to brighten the room. Together with the pale-yellow wallpaper, it fitted quite nicely.
Raising his hands placatingly, the redhead defended himself, "I had no way of knowing that the desk had an underbody of steel. That increased the density of the object."
Nodding resigned, Harry gave the court one last look before slipping out. Neville was already waiting for him with his robes and armour. Wearing armour at work was the one thing Harry had insisted upon after his promotion to full Auror status. He had been on the run for more than a year, and apart from all the other lessons that year had taught him, he had learned that in the end, all assignments got pear−shaped at one point.
The pureblood pondered this for a few moments, before swearing, "I will do everything I can, so you won't regret giving us this chance. I will work hard to prove you right." Because, despite everything, this young man had suffered in his short life, he still thrived to make their world a better place. After the horrors Voldemort had put them through, Harry Potter was able to push away prejudice that had been as natural as breathing for Lucius Malfoy his entire life. He had even overcome any sense of pride that might stand in the way of convicting a felon, by accepting help from a former enemy. Lucius could see that, between the two of them, Potter was the better man and that simple realisation would help him in days to come to bend to his will, even without the vow.
Completely taken aback by this coherent, yet slightly awkward phrase - up until now, the little elf had but offered two-word sentences - the young wizard nearly missed, her turning around with a confused look. "Serve what … serve what?" She pondered, still clutching her master's trousers. Yet before Kreacher could offer a suggestion, her face lit up, and she beamed at Harry.
“Lucius, Abraxas Malfoy, are you willing to make a binding, magical vow and align yourself with Harry, James Potter? Accept his will as your own and obey him, no matter his demands?”
Cautiously, Draco probed, "But that is not the long-term solution, you prefer." Why were they discussing Astoria Greengrass' personal life? They had never been friends. Surely, there were witches and wizards more suitable for this kind of conversation. Especially since Draco himself was in no position to offer support. He was a mere servant to the Potter Family, after all.
Looking over, starring at a man who hadn't moved in five years, Harry slipped from the window−sill and approached the bed. Carefully, he pulled up the blanket and then gently brushed a strand of dark hair out of the comatose patient's face. "I'll talk to you tomorrow. Good night, Sir."
That argument, however, was brushed away easily. "It's not as if I have a lot of need for it these days."
Pulling the young man in, reversing their positions from the beginning of the evening, George rubbed the younger man's back soothingly. "I know, Harry. We have talked about this, remember? I know you are not to blame. It was Fred's and my decision to be there, to fight by your side because frankly, anything else was out of the question."
"You know, I have not talked to the gargoyles since we have cleaned the house. I think right now they would enjoy my presence more than you."
****************************************************************************************************
Wondering if he was on to something, Draco pressed, "Ruby, how long have you been in Lady Blackwood's service?"
"Thank you," the older wizard replied earnestly. "For making the effort. Now go. You have drawn-out … your lunch-break enough."
Confirming that, the older Auror started on a few memos and folded them up and sent them on their way in quick succession. When the two Aurors turned to go, he held them back with a short, "Thanks, Potter."
"Do you think that's the right thing to do?" The other wizard asked, and instantly regretted the question when Draco tensed defensively.
Stumbling into the great hall, Harry spotted Ron and Hermione at the head-table, talking animatedly to a beaming professor Sprout. Not up for conversation just yet, Harry chose a place at the nearly empty Hufflepuff table and nodded gratefully when a seventh year sent a pot of coffee his way. He shuffled through the available dishes until a bowl of sweet porridge appeared on his plate. After a taste, he discovered that it was made exactly to his liking. "Kreacher?"
Less perturbed, Pince shrugged, "His sister was killed during the first war during a raid Lucius Malfoy allegedly led. He has a good reason to hate your pet Death Eaters."
A swirl of magic gathered around the wood before it exploded into motion. Ducks, doves, rabbits and all other kinds of woodland creatures dashed out between them, making for the surrounding lands.
Wands at the ready, the quartet started to wander down a slope. The walls were made of some ancient stones, dark grey and worn from the passage of time. While air would get damper the deeper underground you travelled, the opposite seemed to be true here. After about four or five stories, they finally came to a halt in front of a large door. The wood gave the impression of stone with hinges of brass that shone in the weak light the Aurors had conjured.
Obviously following the trains of her fellow Slytherin's thoughts, the young witch tilted her head. "The name, the house, the fortune. The only things I have claimed for myself are my house-elf Sally and the vault my late husband has set up for me. Since he was always quite generous - monetary speaking - the allowances of the past few years will tidy me over for many years to come."
"That was George," Ron deadpanned, still not sure if he was asleep or awake on this surreal morning.
"How?" Draco stuttered, slowly coming to terms with what he had just learned. Yet instead of pulling back, as one would expect since his potential wife had seemingly tricked him, he remained by her side, comfortingly touching her back in a show of support. He was rewarded by Astoria looking at him gratefully. "What happened?"
After an encouraging nod, Leewood started a complex analytic spell while their team-leader explained, "Though you and your team surely have covered more ground than all others, I am concerned about the degree of backlash you are experiencing. Charles is the best analyst we have. So, I want him to have a look."
Harry could picture his former potions professor in these surroundings oh so easily. A smaller, second door, led off the main chamber and when he opened it, he spotted a private lab. Another door hid a small kitchen and a third … the young wizard merely took a peek, before closing it hastily. No, Snape's bedroom was certainly no place where he wanted to go.
Of course, he was not able to lift his entire upper body off the bed. To expect that would be borderline stupid, and Severus Snape might be many things, but he certainly was no fool. Still, he managed to lift his head and shoulder-blades. Impressive for a coma patient of five years.
Surprisingly, he actually sounded genuine, so the young woman nodded and left Grimmauld Place for the apothecary. Leaving Harry with his guardians-slash-servants for now.
Rounding the house, on horseback already, Lune had not only forgone saddle, but bridle as well, and not even bothered to put on shoes. Smiling, she calmed her partner. "Don't worry they will stop at the lake."
Allowing himself a small smile, Harry had nodded. "I would even go so far as to call myself a parsel-mage."
By Merlin, what if Lucius was, once more, just a pawn in someone else’s game? Convinced that it was the best way to ensure his families well-being, he had not even protested being sent back to Azkaban after the final battle. He had decided to give in, pleading only for his family to get off with a minimal sentence. But what if that had been a plot for someone to gain hold of the Malfoy family?
Anxious, Emerald looked over her shoulder, where Kreacher shimmered into view, putting a steadying hand on her shoulder. Then she looked back up at Harry. Her brilliant green eyes shone with determination, "What has me be doing?"
However, he counted it as a win, when Lucius and Narcissa smiled at him, after giving Draco a brief once-over, while Ron just grinned at the picture they presented. Hermione merely advised the blond to 'tune it down a notch'.
Faced with the blond's unease, the raven-haired sighed and messed up his hair. "Could we maybe talk in the kitchen? We haven't eaten since last night and I'm starving." Not that he had been able to stomach a lot, maybe the quarter of a pizza at most.
"Do you need anything?" Like Minerva, Severus had the uncanny ability, to make him feel like a child again, when he studied him.
Hermione and Lucius were left alone well until mid-morning. The pregnant witch had received a nutritious, well-balanced breakfast with ham and eggs on toast and a small fruit-plate. After some experimenting, the prisoners had discovered that, while Lucius could not take anything from her, Hermione was perfectly able to share his porridge. So they had spiced up the tasteless pulp with some fruit and had evenly distributed every dish between them. Around ten, the wizard was roughly dragged from the cell. When Hermione tried to help him, she received a backhanded for the attempt; and though she could hear one of the wizards reprimanding the witch for doing so, her cheek still stung.
"Ow, indeed, Potter. Is he alright?" The blond mirrored the other's gesture of rubbing his forehead.
Chuckling, Lucius shook his head, remembering all the mischief he and his fiancée had gotten into in their attempt to get to know each other. "Let's just say, the day of our wedding, I shared his opinion. But when she banished me from her bed for not yielding to her will on the decoration of our baby's nursery, I fell in love with her and keep falling still."
No, Harry decided, he could not betray Snape like that. The pensieve incident was enough. "Kreacher?"
"I am an Auror who has seen the victims of abusive relationships, and I thank Merlin that Astoria Greengrass will not be added to that list."
"You could never have predicted him going after a half-blood over a pureblood. Not with the way he told us how insignificant half-bloods or muggleborn were." Lucius attempted to offer comfort.
Checking the roast, a new recipe he had been eager to try, after weaselling it out of Molly, since it would offer a particularly chewy bone for Inari, Draco shrugged, "He lived with the bastard longer than any of us."
Now it was Harry's turn to roll his eyes. Some things never changed, and Percy trying to educate people was one of these things. He would be a good head for a potential educational department that dealt with pre-school and any other form of learning ahead of Hogwarts. "Fine! Are they still at it, or can I take Snape to Gringotts?"
Furiously the blond growled, "Don't think for one second, that your silly parselmagic tricks will keep you safe! You are in my domain now, and nothing can stand against me. Accio Excalibur!"
"I promise," the young Auror assured, "Sleep, Draco, I swear that I will not let anything bad happen to your family!" It was a promise he had no idea of how to keep, but he would do everything in his power to manage. Apparently, that enough for Draco to finally relax and succumb to sleep.
Snapping his mouth shut, Draco reminded himself that Luna Lovegood was a Ravenclaw. It was too easy to underestimate her, with her forgiving nature and natural smiles. Still, underestimating someone's intelligence was dangerous. Draco had thought himself to have learned that particular lesson. Apparently, not all lectures of the war had stuck.
Obviously surprised, that the other did not jump to conclusions once again, Harry dusted the flour off his hands and claimed a seat, facing his guest. "He's brewing."
"That was not our choice," his son mumbled, but his father brushed away the excuse. "It still happened in our home, so we will do our best to make it up to him. I have, as of now, no clue about how I can best serve him, but from now on, we will look to the future and thrive to become better men than we were in the past."
"Hello, Harry," she beamed joyously, rummaging through her bag, producing a small bottle with a red liquid. "I brought you cherry−juice with a hint of cardamom and camphor. It will help your head to get better since you're leaving tomorrow."
"Why is the Prince crest over the door?" Severus wanted to know, after having studied his unexpected fortune for several minutes.
"I'm sorry," Hermione repeated softly. Talking about contraception with a pureblood was insensitive in hindsight.
To tidy over the awkward silence where nobody wanted to get into Harry's path again, Narcissa inquired, "A firefox … a quite … harmless looking Patronus."
Chuckling, Harry ordered, "Tell the Malfoys' elves to bring their saddles and riding−gear to Luna's place. Then fetch mine and Teddy's from the Tonks' residence, please."
Instead of answering, Harry put down his scrolls and stepped to the window. "How much do you know about 'the prophecy'?"
In the kitchen, the other wizard traded Emerald for a pot of stew with freshly baked bread and promptly started to wolf down his portion. Inevitably, his housemate asked himself if he had seen the other at breakfast but could not recall any interaction after the first meal yesterday morning. "How is your case going?"
"I had to guess your size, Narcissa," Molly admitted. "Harry managed to nick one of your vests, but I am not exactly sure if it will be a good fit."
Clearing his head with a shake, Severus gathered everything he would need and started. His godson stayed at his side and diligently cut, squeezed and powdered as instructed. After nearly two hours, where Draco had been in and out of the lab as needed, he ordered, "Three hairs from Teddy's head. Two centimetres each, preferably from the crown."
Draco had not liked the dangerous gleam in her eyes but had opted to ignore it. He had survived the Dark Lord. Whatever could she do to him? Not two minutes later, he had regretted his decision. Having never been good with pain, the young pureblood had screamed himself hoarse when she had started using a flailing curse on him, slicing through his clothes and the skin of his back. After a perceived eternity, Lady Blackwood had let up and crouched down beside him. Oh, so tenderly, she had brushed the tangled strands out of his sweaty face and inquired, "Will you be good now, my little gem, and do as you're told?"
Harry noticed that Emilia had to suppress a smile before the witch tilted her head. "In that case, let us see if we can build up from here. We have a lot of work to do."
In Korea, Japan and finally China he learned about the inherited magic that lived in the very stones of the buildings that had been erected hundreds of years ago. About ancient creatures so tiny you could not even see them, but that thrived on the emotions of the inhabitants of their homes. Luna would have loved them, and Harry had purchased several paintings and books to send to his friend.
"I see …," the former Death Eater mumbled, before continuing his explanation. "Anyway, not every witch or wizard has enough mental discipline to master that art. Prayers are … they are a way to clear your mind and find inner peace. Even if you can't occlude. It often helps to put things into perspective."
Lucius gapped after his friend, still clutching the file in question. "I …," he started, but obviously was at a loss.
Severus turned up his nose, "Oolong … a tea that's neither green nor black, with plenty of advantageous properties. That's medicine, not a beverage. If I wanted to stay awake or boost myself, I would drink a potion."
"Draco … whoa, stop right there!" Finally understanding the problem, Harry shook his head. "I can find a hundred tasks for you if that's what it takes to uphold the conditions of the oath. Lucius isn't around 24/7 either, and he's bound to me under much stricter conditions than you. Also, who said anything about me not
"Yea," Ron chuckled. "There would have been no changing Rose in the middle of the night, falling flat on his face because his leg gave out."
Hissing at Narcissa, Griphook replied, "The Potter family vault contains five other wands, including those of your parents."
The Lady hesitated for a second, studying both Harry and then the cloak, but then followed after her husband's liege without a word. Some things were better left unknown.
When soft snoring filled the quiet of the room a few minutes later, Draco looked up from his doodle. He had decided within the hour after Harry had shared his intentions about the prank, which potion and colour additives to prepare. But Severus' journals, especially those of his earlier years, were notoriously dry, that you had to fight the desire to dunk the entire thing into a cauldron of tea, just to spice them up a little. There really was no better reading material to put anyone to sleep.
Shaking his head, Harry took a sip of the tea Draco had just served him. “Don’t take this the wrong way, Lucius, but can you imagine what would happen if word got around that I have left you alone in Malfoy Manor with all the dark artefacts still around?”
This was wrong. This was wrong on so many levels that Harry did not even know which issue to address first. Draco, however, seemed to understand what was most important. Gently caressing the boy's head, he assured him, "Edward, we are happy when you are around."
With a sigh, Harry rose to reclaim his drink. "You know that it drives me nuts when you do that." After swallowing a mouthful of hot chocolate, he did not even struggle, when the other took it back. "And no, I haven't."
"It was," Harry admitted after a moment. Then he added near inaudible, "Like having a mother, for the first time I could remember."
During dinner, Lucius and Harry carried the conversation, by discussing family heirlooms and how to best get rid of the dark magic most contained, without destroying them. Before they could retire to the living room for a night−cap, the fireplace flared to life.
"Then don't," Harry shrugged easily. "There are enough rooms around to change one into a nursery, and your room can be expanded to fit a couple. A handful of extension charms and voilà. Ron would help. He's good with those."
Skipping down the stairs, she lingered on the last, looking at him pondering. "Don't snoop into his room, Draco. Not even if one of us is around. Even we tend to hex first and ask questions later. Remember that our wands are never far."
If you would like to discuss this, come and find me on tumblr (as mentioned above) or just message me here. But please, I try to be respectful, so I expect the same courtesy from you.
When all inhabitants of Grimmauld Place shared the truly decadent dinner Kreacher had prepared, coffee and little tarts for dessert included, they ate their fill but made very little conversation. All three were too wrapped up in their own minds. Severus was the only one to sense something being amiss between the boys. However, since no friendship could be sunshine and roses all the time, he brushed it off as a momentary whim, not worth investigating if it passed.
"But that's the thing, Draco, I was! Ever since entering our world, I was being told over and over again that it was my destiny to kill a man so that countless others could live. Dumbledore assured me that it was all for 'The Greater Good' and I believed him! I spent a year of my life hunting down every last piece of Tom Riddle's soul, so I could finish him off. And not even after he had died did I ever ask myself if it had been the right thing to do. So, I am not really the right person to ask. Because if I accept that it is right to kill one wizard so hundreds, maybe thousands can live, where do I draw the line? Is one life worth less than a thousand, than a hundred, than ten? You decided that Astoria's life was worth more than Rosier's and I think that I am the wrong person to tell you that that was a mistake."
"Still," Severus forced out, "You … could … have lost … your … voice" Growing quieter towards the end, due to the strain talking this loudly put on his throat.
Shrugging, the raven-haired looked over his shoulder. "It's the least I could do. You've kept me safe for so long. I merely wanted to repay the favour."
Scandalised, James shook his head, "No, don't worry. We would never do that to ourselves. You're Frank and Alice's boy, Neville, right?"
As if on command, all Weasley-children, including Harry, put on the new sweaters Molly had made for them. Still, none of them were as fine or sophisticated in their fitting as Narcissa's and Andromeda's.
With all the gravity a soon−to−be seven-year-old was capable of, the boy nodded before he held out his hand. "I understand, but you still owe me a sickle."
Narcissa's hand on his shoulder made the pureblood look up from the law-book he had been leaving through. About to ask if everything was alright, he was silenced by a delicate finger brushing over his lips, then she pointed at the fireplace. As expected, Harry was fast asleep again; unexpectedly, so was Draco. At one point, Luna had returned from her conversation with the Gargoyles. She had not only claimed Draco's armchair but his potions book as well and was studying it serenely. Their son had chosen a place on the floor; his notes spread haphazardly around him. Nevertheless, he seemed to have lost his fight against the siren's song of sleep and was leaning back against the impromptu bed, snoring quietly. Harry's arm that tended to dangle down the chaise was wrapped around him from behind, keeping Draco from slipping to the floor by offering his shoulder as a cushion.
Neville, however, merely laughed off his partner's irritation, clapping him on the shoulder, "They so are."
After she was finished, he even got up and fetched tea for them. Decaffeinated for Hermione, of course.
Casting some cleaning charms, before covering Snape with a fresh blanket, Emilia inquired, "That depends on how much blood you have taken from him."
After watching the little elf sneak out the door, Severus noticed that the young wizard had claimed a spot on his mattress. Having apparently seen his attempts to reach out, Harry tentatively reached for Severus' hand. After a heartbeat, where he seemed indecisive if he was allowed the contact, he mumbled embarrassed, "Or, maybe I should not sit here. I can take the armchair!" Hesitant, he pulled back.
When Lucius did not reply, Harry rubbed his head, tussling his already unruly hair. "It's what He would have done."
The former head of Slytherin routinely ignored the following wail. Honestly, house-elves and their dramatics. They had
"Because," Hermione lectured, sounding so much like her younger self, that Harry had to smile, despite the dire situation, "Whatever they are planning: it won't happen in a sealed room. One way or the other, they will have to get him out. As soon as Draco leaves the wards, we can either get him back or join him."
"The Malfoys followed You-know-who!" Ron growled. "Voldemort! You know what I mean!" He corrected himself impatiently when his friend scowled.
"Because I have a feeling that you are right. And if our victims really were taken to pick their brains, they are alive and well. Coerced, maybe, but unharmed and that gives us time to find them."
The Head Auror had no qualm about sharing his opinion. “Potter, have you gone mad? Or did that bastard somehow put a spell on you? Otherwise, I really can’t imagine why you would make such a ludicrous request. This is completely and utterly out of the question!”
A childish name for a mild calming draught, or so Draco thought. Still, the name; memories of scents; the taste of some of the ingredients; soothing hands caressing his head; these memories were important yet hovering out of reach. Draco just could not lay his finger on the why. Still, he recognised the recipe for what it was, and since it did not fall into the category of potions his master had set him upon, he turned the page.
That brought the desired reaction, since the man relaxed ever so slightly, focusing on his liege. Once Harry was sure that Lucius was back with him, he picked him up and followed Ron and Hermione out of the smoke-filled room. His vasal was weak, and cold all over. "He needs a healer. He's hypothermic." He looked at Neville. "Grimmauld Place?"
"Come here, love." Narcissa held out her hand for him and pulled him down to the sofa. "You have to understand a few things, Harry. Ancient wards are almost always stronger than new ones, but the Fidelius Charm is the strongest protection there is. Your father did everything in his power to keep you and your mother safe. Peter Pettigrew was not an evil man; he was just weak. Our Lord … Tom," she corrected herself after a moment, "was terrifying and not many people were brave enough to stand up to him. Your parents were exceptional, as was your godfather. Peter Pettigrew was just … normal."
Puzzled, since very few people were actually aware of them being awake at this hour, they interrupted their breakfast and left for the living-room. Worried that something might be wrong with his parents, Draco immediately relaxed, when he spotted Charles Weasley in the flames. Kneeling before the hearth, both young wizards were surprised when the redhead did not even bother with a greeting. "Harry, can I borrow Draco?"
When Teddy's chin began to wobble, and tears sprung to his eyes, Narcissa had to fight down the urge to hug and comfort him, since she did not know if such a gesture would be appreciated. Helplessly, she looked at her sister. "What's wrong?"
But with George's analysis, with Harry's colleague confirming what had happened, everything had come together.
Rolling his eyes, the young wizard demanded to know, “Did Lucius at least talk to Narcissa about what happened?”
The air in the office turned to ice and in the next heartbeat, magic discharged, Ron and Harry at the centre of the explosion. For several seconds nobody dared to breathe. The remaining people in the office straightened from where they had found cover, brushing off paper and debris. Neville smiled the tiniest bit when he realised that their vertical garden was unharmed. Apparently, a small part of Harry had been lucid enough despite his emotions getting the better of him. Also, none of them were seriously harmed. Thank Merlin for small mercies.
There was another vault. The 'main' Potter vault, as Griphook had told Harry once the war had been over. His 'expenses' vault had contained merely a fraction of his family's wealth, meant to tidy him over Hogwarts. But while Harry had been able to bring himself to enter Sirius' private vault, the one his parents had used was merely gaining income, remaining untouched.
Sagging a little, Snape whispered, "He could have died. Again! That stupid boy!" He growled sub vocally and for a moment, the wizard seemed to fight the impulse of leaving his bed to whack Harry over the head. Draco's hand on his shoulder calmed him, if only a little. "I gave him a pain potion and a muscle relaxant. The Weaslette is currently helping him to take a bath. He'll sleep like a dead afterwards."
Meeting his friend's challenging gaze, beyond relieved to receive that kind of stare, Harry swivelled around the desk-chair before sitting down, the wrong way. Resting his arms and chin on the back, he shared, "The summer after my first year, my uncle locked me in my bedroom. I received but one can of soup per day and was allowed to go to the bathroom maybe two or three times. My windows were barren, effectively trapping me and Hedwig." When Draco looked at him thunderstruck, Harry merely raised his hand, so he could continue. "The first two weeks were not that bad. The Dursleys never fed me enough, so I had made sure to stock up on food during my last days at Hogwarts. However, meat and sausages are hard to preserve, so after a fortnight, I ran out of meat for Hedwig. She ate bread and biscuits but did not like it. All I had were the meagre pieces of meat that came with my soup. It left me with the plain broth. I was constantly hungry, but fortunately, Ron and the twins rescued me on my birthday."
Laughing, the mother lectured, "Well, in that case, 'Hugo' will have to wait since I have not had dinner yet. And I have a craving for roast and a crunchy salad."
"I did," Harry relaxed, leaning back into the chair, comforted by the memory. Sometimes he was not even sure if it had not been all but a dream. In other moments, he knew his meeting with Death to be true, like he knew that the sun rose in the East. "It was Dumbledore who greeted me and gave me a choice: to either go back or to go on. I … I wanted to see you and Sirius and Remus so badly. At the same time, I knew you would not want to see me so soon. You would have wanted me to have a long and happy life. That's why I went back, leaving the Horcrux behind. In the end, I managed to defeat Voldemort with the Elder Wand. But the next day …"
"Still," Neville acted as the voice of reason. "If they have really been abducted and set on a problem, how would every-day books be helpful for a challenge only they have the chance to overcome?"
"It was not that hard," the former Lord shrugged. "Severus lacked the funds and appreciation, both I could offer easily."
"We're here for you, baby," she had assured him. "We'll always be there for you to help you through."
"Just go with your gut," Ron advised, and Draco added after a moment of hesitation. "In the end, Kreacher will be the one to take care of her. All you have to do is open yourself so that she can access your magic. The rest will happen naturally."
Maybe it was wrong … alright, it was definitely wrong to revel in Harry's audible unease. Yet, after the tense conversation with Longbottom, Snape needed his world to re-align itself. After all, it had taken him years to perfect his 'evil dungeon bat'-persona, and it had been quite disconcerting to see it brushed aside so easily by a student who had been so very scared of him, that even his boggart had taken Snape's form. That's why he waited for two heartbeats, before replying sternly, "Enter."
His son snickered. "The 'Golden Trio', obviously. Professor McGonagall and Mdm. Pomfrey. And of course, the nurse who took care of him these last few years. Oh, and Aunt Andromeda, as of a month ago."
Pince shrugged and continued, "You were ready to die, but not for all the witches and wizards of Britain. You walked to your death for these people." He gestured towards the animatedly conversing group. "You wanted them, and a few selected others, to live, more than anything else in the world and they know it. So, in the end, short of demanding their first-born, I doubt that you can ask anything, they would not gladly offer. And judging from your status as godfather to your best friends' kid, not even that seems to hold true."
"So," Harry pondered, "If we can find the elf who has catered to Hermione's whims, we might be able to find their base, and that might give us a clue of where to find Draco."
"I …," reminding himself that the life of evasion and misdirection lay behind him, Severus did not confirm Kingsley's opinion, but merely nodded, "Thank you."
"To not get caught!" Father and son finished in one voice before Lucius continued his tale. "Also, Severus had already proven himself skilled, resourceful and quite vindictive when it came to his potions. He might not have considered making use of his potions at that point, but he certainly had no qualms about offering his knowledge as a bargaining chip. I had no interest in starting a war that I was not convinced I could win."
"Gimme!" Ron demanded excitedly, throwing Draco the journal, before excitedly leafing through the book Harry offered. After but a minute, he shouted excitedly. "Ha! Knew it!" Placing the schoolbook on the table, Ron read out loud, "While there are many ways to stabilise volatile ingredients, Essence of Lacewing Fly is one of the most common, since it is non-toxic and can be ingested with minimal side-effects. For salves and poultices, the bark of Variegated Goton might be used, since the mild skin irritation it can cause, is neglectable, compared to the inflictions it might attempt to cure."
"How can it?" Draco closed his eyes against the growing pain that filled his heart. "I am a horrible person. I have done unspeakable things in the past. Your godson should not even consider liking me, no matter our relations."
"The Resurrection Stone," Harry replied absent-minded, going over the floo protocols again, shoving them to the floor, when they did not tell him anything new and returned to his caged lion impression.
A vast amount of stolen goods not being life-threatening, they even made it home in time for dinner.
Now there was a chance for Inari to become the same for Draco. Harry wished for this to come true. His companion truly deserved it. However, before the little fox reached maturity, they could not know. "Do you think Draco's cage is sufficient?"
Alright, so, it turns out, I'm afraid of heights. Well, not hights exactly, more walking over moving platforms at great hight. Today my family convinced me to join them on the rope climbing parkour in the forest on top of Kahlenberg (Lower Austria). I've never done that before since I was heavily overweight until two years ago (280 pounds). Now being only 154 pounds (after a stomach operation in 2017) I thought, why not. "I AM FUCKING TERRIFIED THAT HIGH UP! THAT'S WHY!!!"
That accusation, however, was the last straw for Harry. With both hands, he shoved back so strongly that Draco landed on his backside in the middle of the corridor. Towering over him like a vengeful titan, the raven-haired screamed, "I entered a ritual I knew nothing about, in the hope that it would keep him from dying! I remodelled and charmed an entire room to fit his needs. I have talked to every bloody newspaper in this damn country to secure his status and financial future! I hired a highly skilled medi-witch - and let me tell you, witches of Emilia Nightingale's calibre don't come cheap - to look after him. All the while working a full-time job and investigating every antidote known to man, in my free time. So, tell me, you snotty bastard, which one of these actions say: 'Oh, let's mess with the professor. I'm sure he deserves it.'"
If he noticed the shadow that fell over Harry's face at that prediction, he did not address it. Instead, he turned back to Andromeda. "Under these circum…stances, I would be grateful if you could keep the news of my unexpected survival to yourself."
"The Master of Death, according to the tale," Lily finished. Apparently, she was not as oblivious as the two wizards had assumed. At James' surprised look, she shrugged. "I do read Harry bed-time-stories. The Tales of Beedle the Bard were one of the presents we have received upon his birth. I think Alice gave it to him."
Saturday morning the following week brought Andromeda Tonks and Teddy Lupin back to Grimmauld Place. Teddy had insisted that it was 'his' weekend, and while he had understood that Harry could not entertain any strenuous activities, due to his recent injury, the boy had not been willing to give up his time with his godfather entirely. Teddy had brought tons of games and drawing materials so that they could have fun indoors. Being the well-behaved child that he was, he had taken to polishing all of Harry's stone amulets in the afternoon, painting an assorted few in assorted colours, while his godfather slept on the carpet in front of the fireplace, where they had been halfway through a geography lesson. Harry had enjoyed taking the time to tell Teddy about his time in India and his friend the snake.
When Snape had not reacted, the young man had continued, "Most wards on Black properties were developed, if not cast by Ignaz Black in the early 12
Never before had anybody present seen binding magic at work. It appeared to gather around Kreacher, pressing into him from all sides. It did not feel painful, but every witch and wizard in the room felt the potential for it to become exactly that. No wonder elves preferred to punish themselves if this was the alternative. Kreacher squirmed for several minutes, fighting against the overwhelming force until he vanished with an audible 'pop'.
When even Hermione started to look sceptical, with Ron downright glaring daggers at Draco, the blond injected somewhat hesitant. "Maybe that is not the best way to begin this conversation."
However, all thoughts of his vassal's trust issues fled his mind when the older wizard was goaded into an attack by his heartless reply. In a last, desperate attempt to gain the upper hand, the former Lord did the unthinkable and picked up Harry's wand, pointing it at its master.
Harry enjoyed long naps between reheated meals and finally a reduced number of potions, while Draco managed to finish his first book from the Black library. The blond even sorted through several volumes that were to his liking and managed to narrow down a selection to three suitable alternatives to present, with the help of his mother. Still, he and Narcissa decided to wait for the next day, to ask Harry's permission for Draco to start another book.
"I'm sure she's brilliant!" Harry beamed. It was so good to hear that his former classmates had made a life and found a passion for themselves. Their lives going on, being all the better for it, made every second of being an Auror worth it, in his opinion.
Inhaling the fragrant tea, she smiled and finally picked up one of the cookies her daughter had baked for her. It was crumbly at the edges and a little too soft in the middle but tasted just fine. Also, it looked vaguely like a heart, something Rose had pointed out proudly at least three times during dinner. The little girl had definitely inherited her mother's brain, with little patience for picture books and an understanding far beyond her age. Regrettably, she had also inherited Hermione's talent for cooking. While everything she produced was edible, it was a far cry from the delicious treats and meals Ron could come up with. Still, Hermione smiled at the vaguely heart-shaped biscuit when Harry inquired, "Help me out here. Make me understand why the thing with Saunders drives you up the wall like this, so you would even threaten him … with an audience! You are usually more level-headed than that."
In an unexpected display of tact, the man kissed his wife's temple. "Why don't I tour our new home? These dogs can't be the only interesting picture around."
And despite obviously knowing that what he did was wrong, Lucius Malfoy folded like a house of cards. Carrying an - obviously illegally acquired file - he stepped around the desk and approached the fireplace. "Alright, I …"
It being really early, and Snape being exhausted at that point, had made him stumble, just three steps away from the bottom. It could have been a nasty fall, but he had had worse over the years. What he had not expected, had been the railing rearing up and a decorative snake wrapping around his lower arm.
believed, with all his heart. At least until he had been forced to open his eyes to the fact the Dark Lord had not hesitated to eradicate even pure-bloods if they stood in his way. But by then, he had already sold his soul to the devil - so to speak - and had needed his entire wits and all of his knowledge to keep the Malfoy name from burning.
"My house!" Harry snapped, despite being aware that it was completely useless to get worked up over a painting. With a sigh, he added, "And your son's devotion to this 'trice damned house-elf' won us the war."
Augusta had informed him of her little soirées, ever since Harry's return from his gap-year. He had always politely declined until Neville had become his partner. The same year the young man had told him - in no uncertain terms - that Harry would accept his grandmother's invitation, or else …
Rolling his eyes, the young Auror grinned, "By putting us all in a food coma, followed by a 'harmless' interrogation that would put the Spanish Inquisition to shame."
A symbian voice drew the young wizard's attention. The snake-decoration at the bottom-right corner of the mantle-piece reared its head and glared at the sooth Hermione had spread with her hasty entry.
Reluctantly, Narcissa nodded and reached for the unassuming holly-wand. Compared to hers it seemed crude; a handle of rough wood instead of sophisticated carvings. Her eyes flickered towards Lucius, who still hovered at the door. Only at his encouraging nod did she close her hand around the handle and knew. Knew that this was not her wand. Knew that it would work for her nevertheless. Knew, without the shadow of a doubt, that this was her best shot.
This story was called 'Arbitrary Decisions' at the beginning and these surgeries were mine. I was convinced that I am doing the right thing (still am, btw.) and now I am at the home straight. Wish me good luck and we will hear from each other soon.
After having finished her first cup of tea, the witch wanted to know, "Alright, Harry, what was it you wanted to talk about?"
Slowly, their former team-leader put the pieces together. "And we think that the guardian of Arthur and Merlin's most sacred texts and artefacts saw something in that mirror that made him willing to risk a centuries-old secret to give squibs some magic."
Rolling his eyes, the blond lectured, as if talking to Teddy, "There is this vast library on the first floor. Libraries contain books. Books contain knowledge. The Black Library contains vast knowledge on ancient rites and spells, especially those that bring unfair advantage to the caster." Rolling his eyes, he added, "It's not as if I can walk down the block to use the public library. Where did you think I am getting my information?"
"I have failed Draco for years. Harry Potter gave me another chance to become the father my son deserves. For that alone, I will be forever in his debt. Rite and charm or not." Looking at the file he had placed on the table, the man pondered, "I want him safe, and Mrs Granger-Weasley had me convinced that this was the right way." Looking up Lucius implored, "These wizards are dangerous, Severus. Their organisation might not be as numerous as ours has been, but they are by no means harmless. They don't have one madman at the top but several cells working together for a common goal; as equals. That keeper wanna-be Wanesworth, Evergreen, the ever-trying upstarted and that snotty nosed Tatings, our head boy, the amount of power they can amass through their rituals is breath-taking. Alone, Harry stands no chance against them. They nearly killed him and Longbottom once. Our Department works on making their organisation illegal, so the Aurors get the chance to pick them up and lock them away on sight."
Once they were all convinced that Harry was indeed alright, and had had breakfast, the witches and wizards departed, leaving Harry and Neville to get ready for work. An hour later all Aurors who were working on the librarians' case were back at the office, discussing the ritual and setting a time-frame for the other locations.
Around seven the same day, Daphne and Harry parted ways in the Atrium of the Ministry. Neither had found any more rest that night, so they had decided to go in early. The young Auror headed for his department with but a departing nod, while the Inquisitor went … wherever she went.
Altogether, Harry could have been thrilled with the outcome. His entire family only mildly injured and safe at home. Except … things had happened. Things neither he nor Draco knew how to deal with. So, adults that they were, they chose to ignore them for now. After the fight, Draco, Severus and Harry had stumbled from the apparition point in the gardens to Severus' bedroom, where the boys had fallen unconscious on the expanded armchair with an excited Inari curled up on top of them. The next morning, the Potion Master and Harry departed for the Ministry to bring Severus back from the dead.
Confused, Narcissa reached for the bigger, softer package and could hear her sister chuckle, when Andromeda ripped her own open. The moment she mirrored the gesture, a gorgeous off-white cashmere-jumper fell into her hands.
Nodding, the young wizard accepted a mug of tea, valiantly suppressing a shudder when he identified the herbal mixture the witch preferred. "Where is Draco?"
Studying Harry, the blond relaxed after a heartbeat, "You really want him to stay. This has nothing to do with obligation. You love him … because he's the last link to your parents?"
When Severus did as told – by a Potter of all people – the young parselmage fastened a leather-cuff around his wrist, prompting, "Close it yourself. While it has a 'notice-me-not' woven into it, I used a modified slave-charm on the closure." At the former Death Eater's alarmed look, Harry appeased him, "It's really only just one component: only the person who closes the cuff can open it again. That should ensure that nobody can take this protection from you, without your consent. Hermione's and Ron's work the same way."
After trading a brief glance, the older wizard started, "The anchor-point of the spell should be right here, from what Longbottom and Potter have told us. But it isn't. It's several stories down."
“Harry,” The blond soothed anxiously, “Everything is okay. You are home. The war is over. Nobody is trying to hurt you.” Carefully, the young man removed the tatters of Harry’s shirt, before gently placing trembling fingers over the raven-haired’s heart. “Whatever it was, it is gone now. See?”
"Severus Snape," Andromeda breathed, instinctively moving Teddy into a sitting position, so she could support Harry in feeding the potion to the child.
With a sigh, Harry turned towards the pureblood. "Listen, Tom was a bastard, who destroyed the lives of many. Nobody here is untouched by his cruelty. But to help get rid of his lingering presence … I do not know if I can explain it right, but it's cathartic. Our friends are here to support Draco and me, no doubt about that. But I am sure they are doing it for themselves as well. To get rid of their fear of this place." When Lucius nodded slowly, Harry instructed, "Now go and change. You will help me with the dining room. I doubt anybody wants to go in there."
But the other interrupted softly, "I am sorry, Draco. I should never have spoken so thoughtlessly. I would never …"
"I … ahm … yes, thank you." Draco mumbled, before drawing himself to his full height again. "Well, I won't have time for reading if you keep distracting me. Go! I have a potion to finish."
Since Ron was currently turning the potions journal upside down, frowning at the page, Hermione took the time to answer, "I think Ron doubts your interpretation of 4 ∆ 75."
Re-examining the conversation, Lucius turned towards Harry and asked, after a few moments, "Did your six-year-old godson just extend his hand in friendship to me, because of my hair?"
"A monthly allowance and not to be touched without permission. She was willing to trade an heir for freedom."
Gazing at her son, Draco seemed to mirror her conviction and - to a certain degree - so did Andromeda. Teddy was the cutest, glaring at the carpet as if ready to go to battle with it. "On three," Narcissa commanded, and her sister started counting.
"Don't," Harry warned in a low voice, "don't dare to imply that I would ever let any harm come to my family under my roof!"
Draco, however, seemed unperturbed by his opposite's agitation. "You're not, but the level of power you have, both as a wizard and over my family rivals that of the Dark Lord."
"I … we can't do that. The venom can't be extracted. It kind of breaks down as soon as it's separated from the blood."
Shrugging, Harry offered a cup with but one sugar. "I think she likes this one best because there are flowers on the tin."
"Tell me something, Walburga," Harry now asked, curiosity finally getting the better of him. "Did you know about the lab your youngest had in the attic?"
It was … there was not really a word for it. The magic here was dark, covering everything like a blanket. Harry understood that on the same level that he knew that the sun was rising in the east. But there was no threat. He watched mothers cast stinging hexes on their children when they misbehaved and men to use charms to help the flowers grow. The air was filled with the scent of their magic, and everything was saturated with their power. Being guided towards the temple, Harry had not realised what was going on, too fascinated by everything around him. But when he was surrounded by seven priests, standing in the middle of a circle, he grew weary and grabbed his wand tighter. But instead of overwhelming him, the men stepped up to him, and each and every one of them drew a part of a symbol on his forehead, using their blood for paint. They barely needed five minutes and the more they completed, the better idea Harry got what this was all about. Once the last one was finished, and an incantation was sung, the British wizard understood. Harry did not actually get the words, but he could gather the meaning. Making conversation possible. As soon as the Brit grasped that, questions poured out of his mouth and with a joyous laugh, one of the priests pulled him along and started explaining.
Teddy's laboured breaths and quiet whimpers had evened out, letting all four adults relax considerably. Now they were sharing a pot of camomile tea. Emerald had been delighted by the order.
With a smile, Harry gestured for Draco to follow. Therefore, the blond got the chance to observe a racing Teddy Lupin coming to a full stop before a beautiful four-year-old with silky, strawberry-blond hair and an ivy-green dress, demanding from her father, who was holding back a toddler from storming the kitchen without a by-your-leave, to straighten the deep red bow, that held back Victoire's hair. Impatient to gain his 'fiancée's attention, Teddy blabbered, "I have a Christmas-present for you! Two actually."
"Two more hours," Draco estimated. "The antidote doesn't have a long brewing time. It's just very … delicate."
Evading the concerned hands of her husband and child, Narcissa stepped into the doorframe and shared in a calm tone. “I should certainly hope so, I spent the entire afternoon polishing it.”
Still, Draco had felt like vomiting, when she had started to caress his arms, straightening the cream dress-shirt that had been blooming with blood. He had needed every last ounce of his composure, when she had tenderly caressed his face, admiring the make-up. "Not exactly up to my standards, but a good start, nevertheless. Who taught you?"
Leaning against Harry ever so slightly, something Draco would blame on the uneven ground until his dying day, the blond mumbled, "Thank you."
"Since it's clear that Lady Blackwood demanded him as 'payment' for her hosting Malfoy and Granger, he's more likely to be treated as a pet rather than a prisoner."
Leaving through the research to take notes, Harry wanted to know, "Would that not make the potion more volatile?"
"It's the time leading up to them when the students need me the most. And it's not only O.W.L.s but N.E.W.T.s as well. Your library is hidden. All you have to do is guard a few artefacts and catalogue new books when they come out. You have no clue about the destruction pubescent teenagers can cause when they are stressed, with little sleep and too much pepper-up and coffee-fudge from Honeydukes. If I don't return before the end of the month, I am afraid my books will be as good as gone. Also, half the students from my school might suffer nervous breakdowns, because they can't study or do their homework since all the sources they need will be missing!"
Shrugging, Harry admitted, "I still don't see why I should care." Then he added on an afterthought, "Sam … wasn't she the witch with the blue-ish pixie cut who invaded our office for an entire week when you set up our vertical garden?"
"I'm afraid the floo of the Manor is heavily restricted," Narcissa admitted, but the wizard merely pulled out his sword and grinned. Offering his hand, he guided her to a fireplace that was protected by huge metal doors. It opened at a mere gesture, revealing an impressive setup with a convenient pot of floo-powder just within reach.
about the potions-regime and the ritual necessary. Both wanted to give squibs a chance on performing magic, even if it were only the simplest of spells. But their individual approaches were
Clutching the stone so firmly that his knuckles shone white, Draco protested weakly, "But he gave it to me!"
At George's inquiring gaze, the raven-haired's brain finally caught up with his mouth, and his cheeks burned up a flaming red. "I mean … I … we're not …" Harry stammered, but the redhead only slapped his back.
For more than a month he lived with these people, breathed their magic until his very soul started hurting because he missed his home so much. The last thing the men and women of the Brazilian temple taught him, was how to connect points of high power. Portkeys, he was educated, were a shortcut over small distances, a couple of hundred miles at best. But if you were able to feel the very magic of the earth, with enough power, you could travel the ley-lines from one node to another. So, he tried and meditated, learning to sink into the ground to follow the power-grid that surrounded the planet. Harry was not able to travel farther than the edges of the country, but his teachers congratulated him because that was quite an achievement for someone who had had no knowledge about parselmagic before. They showed him a map of the world as they knew it and with little difficulty, Harry could identify the node of power at home. He helped prepare the ritual and promised to return, but they all knew that to be a lie. Still, they let it go and offered an open invitation.
The golden trio had been delighted when they had heard about that display of house-unity. Still, being of the 'old sort', they were pleased to see the Gryffindor house in the lead.
The Lady allowed herself to be manoeuvred into a conjured chair, while Drake stalked over to the Potion Master. Looking the man up and down, he stated drily. "Took you long enough. I was wondering when you would finally grace us with your presence, Master Snape."
Though chances usually were fifty-fifty if the bird would come, today his owl graced him with a visit. Of course, he first circled the room, then graciously accepted a treat, before he allowed Harry to pet him. Only after their ritual was completed did he hold out his claw for the letter.
“Mate, you are a lifesaver!” Ron announced, as soon as Harry entered, before turning back towards his costumer, bowing when handing over the product. “Here is your Giggling Goo, Miss Rosenberry. Have fun with it. We hope to see you again soon.”
When Severus pondered the question, Harry answered with a small smile, "The Half-Blood Prince's Apothecary."
"Tea!" she exclaimed excitedly and then tried again, "Emerald will serve you tea now, Master-Harry-Sir." Then, with high concentration, she snapped her fingers.
"Harry?" George asked hesitantly, but the other wizard did not even look up from the toy in his hand.
Chuckling under his breath, very much like his sister before, the redhead shrugged, "We appreciate all you have done, Malfoy. But Harry is a mule at the best of times. Usually, it needs either Hermione or mum to get him to rest. Believe me, nobody expects you to keep him in bed until he is fully healed. We will all have your back."
Slowly rising, placating the agitated young man, Narcissa shared gently, “This is not about what my cousin deserves. It is simply a matter of blood. Only a member of the Black family can alter the Black-family-tree.”
Looking at the file in his hands, Lucius slowly shook his head, obviously having a hard time to catch up. "This is not …"
"My liege detests me! "Lucius despaired, walking a grove into the carpet of his wife's salon. "This will end badly for all of us. By Merlin."
Pondering that for a few moments, admitting that his former pupil's concern was valid, Snape suggested, "Then you should change the public's opin… view of Narcissa."
Harry placed the first aid kit on the small table by the fire and started inspecting its content. "The small white jar?" He inquired.
"Let's just say, we are even now. You've saved me by declaring me dead, making my victory over Tom possible in the first place."
"Rosier was a bastard who abused his wife! Whoever killed him is still out there and could be a danger to Astoria. She finally is rid of her husband! I don't want her to fall victim to yet another psychopath. If someone is willing to kill for her, who knows what else he or she might do to gain her favour."
It always came back to drinking games. And though the famous Gryffindor courage had abandoned them on occasion, especially when faced with Slytherin cunning, nobody was prepared when Ron challenged, "Favourite scar," after draining his third beer, in addition to the two shots he had already had.
Eating the no doubt excellent meal, Harry took little time to retreat to the upstairs study once he was finished. Compared to the rest of the house, this room seemed downright untidy, since it was the only one, Kreacher was not allowed to enter. Beer - and the occasional whiskey bottle littered the surfaces of most furniture. This had once been the salon of Walburga Black, dominated by the vast tapestry that held every name ever born into the Black family. ‘At least those she considered worthy,’ Harry thought, fixating bitterly on the leaf where Sirius name had been snuffed out by fire.
In September 2018 I applied for a lower body-lift to cut off the excess skin because - let's be honest - if you're over 40 your body simply doesn't bounce back from years of overweight.
After a quick shower, Draco could not afford to waste hot water, that would be unsuitable, he brushed back his hair and studied his reflection. Though in the past, he had given much thought to his appearance, over the last four years, he had gotten used to seeing a gaunt and grey face looking back at him. No wonder, since he had learned to function on about four hours of sleep each night. Nightmares as a bi−nightly occurrence did not make for restorative recovery.
Raising her hand, Emilia started to count on her fingers, "Three months ago, you were in a coma. Since you woke you have left your bed, returned to a clear speech pattern, started to write legibly again and reclaimed your magic. Of course, your recovery was aided by the best potions available in your situation, but most patients, who were in a coma for more than a year, needed twice if not three times as long to accomplish that! And that, if they manage at all, which is in no way guaranteed!"
Creeping closer to the bed, Draco reached for his godfather's hand. Sinking into the armchair beside it, he brought it up to his cheek.
Harry could feel Ron starting to tremble all over in their shared embrace and could only laugh out loud when his best friend squeaked, "What?"
Taking a cup, the Minister chuckled. "It was no bother to wait. I was able to entertain myself with some very interesting reports."
On the inside, the tool-shed was oval-shaped, 10 feet in diameter and at least 15 lengthwise. Slightly off-centre was a ritual circle that seemed to be melted into the ground. The markings were made of a silvery substance that shimmered in all colours of the rainbow if the moonlight hit it just right. Looking up, Severus noticed that there was no roof, bathing the entire space in natural light. The moon was waxing, a few more days and it would be full. Crouching down, he reached out for the silver substance, but only touched it after Harry's encouraging nod. "It …" unsure of how to describe the sensation, he settled on, "it feels like me … like my magic."
The pureblood hesitated, before replying, "I have mastered Occlumency at a very young age, at my father's insistence. Hence, I never saw a reason to pray. Now, I wonder if my family would not have benefited from a little guidance."
Severus was an inch away from drawing his wand and hexing the stupid brat to kingdom come. But then he reminded himself that Harry was no longer his pupil and that he could only offer help when that idiot child was ready to accept it.
Chuckling despite himself, the pureblood eased her. "Don't worry, Narcissa was the same during her pregnancies. I got used to being either shouted at or cried upon."
When the Lady did not acknowledge his words, the young man started to shift nervously. "Mrs Malfoy, I …"
"No!" The young wizard protested, "I asked you not to buy me anything. You promised! This, right here, is all I ever wanted."
"No," Harry shook his head, selecting a few items before looking at the former Lord. "I just mentioned my plans to Neville and Inquisitor Greengrass yesterday. She was sent here to investigate the magic I cast, so I thought it prudent to warn her about today."
At the Ministry, Leewood dragged him into one of the observation rooms. "Longbottom decided that giving you a go at her will be our last resort. For now, he and Pince started the interrogation."
"Out of the question!" Draco decided. "The last thing Severus might remember about father might be him losing the favour of the Dark Lord. But him being bound to you, serving you devotedly might be a bit of a stretch. Best not to talk about him."
Severus was shocked when he took in the picture his usually so perfectly groomed godson made. Blond strands were in disarray and slightly greasy, the boy had not shaved in at least two days, and if the former professor was not mistaken, those were the same robes he had worn two days ago for dinner.
The boy still sat in his arms when the door opened, and Andromeda entered the kitchen. She looked pale, a fact that made her red eyes stand out even more. Instantly, Harry was on his feet. "Do you need anything? What about Narcissa? Are the two of you alright?"
Slowly turning towards his brilliant wife, Ron's face lit up like a Christmas tree. "Hermione, you're a bloody genius!" Turning towards his best friend, he inquired, "Did Snape's journals, by any means, include the half-blood prince's potion's books?"
Snape's eyes met his for a second, before he gazed longingly at the edge of the bed, telling the young wizard where the ghost of his mother was residing. Slowly he approached the bed, speaking quietly, "You need to give the Stone back now, Sir. I imagine there are thousands of things you still want to tell her, believe me, I do. I share the sentiment. But the living have no business with the dead. It's too easy to get lost with them."
“You filthy, little half-blood!” Sneered a vicious voice from the one paintings, Harry had chosen for his bedroom.
Slowly turning towards his partner, Neville's eyes promised painful retribution if Harry would not answer all questions to his full satisfaction, once they had a moment to themselves. "And what was the nature of that visit?"
Once the elf was gone, the raven-haired made an inviting gesture, "After you, Inquisitor Greengrass."
Trying to find a way around the constriction Draco had placed on him, the elf shared, “After your quarrel with Mister Malfoy, Mistress and the young Master were quite concerned. Kreacher served dinner, but they barely ate before retiring early.”
"Don't forget who taught you that, my Lady." Lucius smiled before pulling himself onto his own horse. Watching his strong and sure movements, nobody would have believed this man to have left Azkaban a mere week ago. Guiding his stallion closer, he reached for his wife's hand and indicated a kiss, chuckling when Narcissa replied, "While that might be true, my dear, don't forget who outdistanced you every ride we took."
When no explanation was forthcoming, Narcissa decided to address the matter that had brought them together. "Mrs Greengrass, you have made an uncommon, yet generous offer. You are honouring our family beyond what can be expected, given our circumstances."
When finally, after nearly twenty minutes, the boy calmed, Harry placed him on the table, so they were eye-to-eye. Draco still hovered at his back, clearly overwhelmed with the situation, but willing to soldier through to help his little cousin. He handed over a cup of camomile tea a desperate Emerald had prepared.
The soft light that fell through the half-closed curtains illuminated Harry's slow rouse from sleep, drinking in the sight of the woman by his side. With a choked sob, he pulled himself close, and she wrapped her arms around him, calming him. "It's all right. You're safe. We all are."
Baring her teeth, Daphne grinned at their former Quidditch Captain, "Alright, Lords and Ladies, here's what we're going to do."
Understanding what the two potioneers were doing, Andromeda tilted her head. "You know that nothing beats a discussion between experts. But have it your way. Your secret is safe with me, as long as I can be sure to receive potions of your standard as needed." She gestured towards her godson, not the slightest bit bothered by the open blackmailing. If his face was anything to go by, neither did Severus. "Everyone might get sick when ingesting Wolfsbane. But most people only throw up. We all know what Teddy's excessive reaction means."
"Oh, no, you don't!" Her partner insisted, pulling her into his lap, effectively keeping her from shielding him by trapping her arms. Then he looked encouragingly at Harry. "Go on, Potter. I've heard fantastic things about you in the locker room."
"Through the door and the second to the right," Harry replied with a grin. Her greeting might be harsh, but her host-gift was more than generous. Having been educated in the art of tea by Andromeda, Harry was aware that the tin-can Pansy had offered was around three galleons. An outrageous price for a pound of tea-leaves, but entirely worth it. At least in Andromeda's opinion.
"Harry," he croaked, shivering all of a sudden. "My name is Harry. Please, don't call me 'my Lord', I'm not Him. All I want to do is help."
"But Severus had to be at least a year your junior." Narcissa pondered. "How was his research of any help to you."
"You would manage. You always do." The young witch assured him with a smile and held on tight for a moment before ushering him out of the door. "Now go, Neville is certainly already bouncing on his toes."
With narrow eyes, Alexander Pince accused him quietly, "What is it, Potter? Did you think that I was raised in a barn? That I do not know how to treat a Lady? Aunt Irma would have had my head, had I not shown the appropriate manners in society. Now, instead of standing around, catching flies, I suggest you go and fetch the Lady some tea. Or do you suggest we put her on water and bread for the durations of this case?"
"Maybe you should try standing on your head," a dreamy voice suggested from behind. "Things will be clearer then."
They watched impassively as the tent burnt to ashes, casting wards as to confine the fire, faint relief the only visible emotion on their faces.
Undoing all charms, putting the living−room back in order, Harry watched Draco pull the child away from the fireplace before inviting, "Come through, Neville."
So, while Harry went through the exercises, he shared everything that had happened today. He finished with, "He said 'Thank you', and I don't know if that even means anything to you because … well, because of everything that had happened. I just … it feels like something you should know." The young man shrugged somewhat uncomfortable, before pulling the comforter up and fixing it around the unmoving body. Gently he brushed the ever-present strand of black hair out of the man's face and whispered, "Good night, Sir," before leaving.
"'Was' being the operative word in this sentence," the blond agreed, slipping onto the windowsill to savour his prize. "Have you shown him the picture, yet?"
Thank you all for your patience, and your kind words to encourage me through NaNoWriMo. I have managed to write about 55.000 words, ten new chapters are in the making and this story is far from over.
The blond told himself that; and more, that he stayed close out of concern of being available if needed. So, the blond did not even think twice about keeping his door open after going to bed. He should readily be available, if Harry needed him at night. At no point did he plan to investigate the sleeping arrangements of Ginevra Weasley in her former boyfriend's home.
"What are you doing, Potter?" The former teacher inquired sharply when he noticed that Harry was shedding his clothes, despite the cold spring weather.
Glad to see his friend perked up, Neville shook his head. "No, I'm not. Maybe he was. Maybe he wasn't. But that's not the point. Most monotheist religions see their gods or goddesses as all-powerful. Being able to do whatever they want with a snap of their fingers - figuratively speaking. But we have magic. We don't need our gods to solve our problems. What we need is the knowledge, the guidance and the strength of mind to do it ourselves. In times of old, there was no Ministry of Magic, no government laws to dictate what we could and could not do. But there were priests, guiding the people who flocked to them to guarantee a harmonious living together. Most people could neither read nor write. So, a book of law would have been of no use. Instead, the different belief systems created rules most suitable for their followers. A few, however, were universal. Things that did not even have to be written down or taught because they were basic knowledge. You know them, in your heart … right down to your bones. Things you simply don't do. Like not trampling on a sprout or abandoning someone who has been hurt."
Enveloping his brother and his wife in a bone-crushing hug, Charlie then carefully put the seeds away. He had to find a herbology master if they wanted to have a chance to re-introduce this plant into their eco-system. But if an American muggle could do it, so could they!
Turning towards the door, he barely caught Walburga’s reply when she mumbled, “I hope you know what you are doing, child. Otherwise, you will be responsible for the end of the noble Malfoy family.”
"Sure, why not? I mean our garden is not as big as this one, but with a few fence-spells easily secure enough for your Inari to play around." The raven-haired shrugged, obviously not seeing a problem with adopting another animal. "Not much is growing there right now, but maybe you could take a look around, Charlie, just to make sure that nothing poisonous is around. She should be fine. For the first few nights, we can put the laundry box up in your room, Draco. Just until she is comfortable enough in her new surroundings. Then … maybe a dog-bed? Do foxes use dog-beds?"
They had spent the better part of the day moving boxes. Yet, when they had encountered a particularly resilient chest, that just would not bulge, Harry and Lucius had exhausted themselves trying to get it out of the attic. All they could do now was request help. Once the letter was written, Harry opened the window and looked around his garden. “Fox, are you here? I have a letter to deliver.” Leaving the window wide open, the young man returned to his desk and pulled a bag of owl-treats from the last drawer to the right.
"I don't know," Harry shrugged. "I never went. It was easier to adapt the wards of this place than to find another. It's not as if I could afford to spread my magic. We have all become very good at wards, especially Hermione. But I never wanted to jump from one location to the other. It seems like an unnecessary risk. There are still people out there to get me."
"Thomas Manson," Alexander Pince interrupted. "Librarian of the University of Manchester. Michel Welsh, Westminster Abby," he gestured at a quite elite looking wizard with impeccable robes and a ramrod straight back. "Cynthia Belfast, Curator of the British Museum and you are Chris Draca, second librarian of the British Library. We know who you are. After all, we have been staring at your faces for the last three months!"
"Will do," the raven-haired grinned. He had finally given up on trying convincing his fellow witches and wizards that Draco and Lucius were not 'his'. "By the way, I didn't see you last night. Where have you been?"
Neville gathered his composure and ordered, "Sit down! Both of you. I'll go and get us the floo protocols from the Manor, and we'll take it from there. Harry, Narcissa, we will find them! I promise!"
Stepping back from the bed, the young man drew a deep breath, when he spotted Kreacher from the corner of his eyes. "Good night, Sir."
Pondering if he should reveal his thoughts, or just think them through first, the blond decided to satisfy his companion's curiosity, "You know how there are muscle relaxant potions?"
"I want to thank each and every one of you, for taking their time to celebrate this Winter Solstice with us. Long have we ignored our traditions. Forgotten that our bond with the earth of Albion is what gives us power. Today marks a change, the beginning of a new life-circle that, while still lying dormant, will undoubtedly bless us with new life this upcoming year." Lowering his arms, he smiled, looking at his muggle-born daughter in law and his youngest son, who stood wrapped around her protectively. Then he let his eyes travel over family, friends and guests in attendance.
Paris had been his first stop, the Eiffel tower in all its glory a sight that took his breath away. Southern France, with all its colourful flower-fields, had shown him that there still was beauty in the world and from there, he had started tramping through Europe. In India, he had found a great travelling companion in a green rattlesnake that had escaped one of the temples. She taught him about the magic of the land, how she could feel the power through her belly when crawling moving on the ground. Harry had visited graves, birth-places, the top of the world, breathing in magic that could not be more different from the power in Britain. He met wizards he could not understand, no matter how many translations spells he tried and communicated with hand and feet. He had eaten food that had made his stomach hurt, had puked out his guts from all the strange spices and had gotten drunken on wine you could never find anywhere else.
Grinning unrepentantly, the taller Weasley handed the cloak over, when the Auror reached for it and stated, “You hollered, little brother?”
"Yes, Oh!" Raising, the Potion Master approached his former student, towering over him. "A word of caution, Mr Potter. Draco is at a complicated point in his life. You won't like the consequences of making it even more difficult for him!"
Shrugging, the elderly witch revealed, "I was raised a Black, and while my parents did not like me marrying a muggle-born, they did not deny me the small inheritance they could provide. Our family was always good with the Dark Arts. Our father especially excelled in curses and," she gestured towards the scrolls and fabrics, "counter-curses as you will see."
All of a sudden, Snape had been back in the Dark Lord's stronghold, trapped by conjured vines, about to be tortured for an imagined slight. Panic had made it hard for him to breathe, tugging at the wooden appliances he had scratched his skin raw.
In the middle of the kitchen table, stood an artificial fox-hole, made of wicker, decorated with colourful ribbons.
"But human sacrifices?" Ron doubted, leaning over the back of her chair. "I'm not saying it's unlikely, just entirely unreasonable."
"Do you think that Mr Longbottom would betray the secret of my survival, now that he is privy to it?"
Relieved, Harry sagged back into his chair. He had not realised until now, how much he had needed his best friends' approval in this. Now he felt drained but still put up a token-protest when Hermione ordered. "Now, you go back to bed or the office and I will do some research!"
The two watched each other for a few moments, seemingly locked in a battle of will, before Harry shook his head in exasperation and started chuckling. "I bow to you, Milady," before he did exactly that. Then he left the room.
Slowly growing agitated at being shouted at by the one friend he had cared about the most and had mourned deeply, the pureblood shot back, "I would not have to go behind my liege's back if the boy was not so foolishly stubborn about everything that concerns his own wellbeing!"
At loss of what to say, both men gazed at their cups, trying their best to ignore the awkwardness that had risen between them.
But what did that say about him? That he was not even happy with the life he had chosen for himself? At school, his greatest dream had always been being able to choose! Not having his life … his fate … written in stone. Now he had a house, friends and family who were happy. So why wasn't he? Of course, there were days where the frustration of not being able to catch the 'bad guy' or save the innocents was crushing him. Days where he felt trapped in endless circles of hunting or be hunted like he had with that trice damned prophecy. But everyone had bad days, right? Right?
have good advisors. But more importantly, I have friends who are willing to tell me if I'm heading in the wrong direction."
go through the preliminary reports about yesterday so I can leave with Severus for Gringotts as soon as possible?"
Though he was not required at the Department of Magical Law between Christmas and New Year, the former Lord could barely sit still in his own home. Memories of how his son had acted around Potter at Christmas, as opposed to the day before, wove themselves into an incomprehensible net he tangled himself up in. Hence, the pureblood filled his days by using the copying charm the young Hermione Granger had given him, digitalising as much of his library as possible. Yet, often, he came across books on Dark Magic he did not want to offer. Least of all to the Department of Magical Law. Those tomes once again drove the message home, how 'complicated' his family's history was. His father had insisted on Lucius studying this kind of magic from an early age. Abraxas had advised him that he always needed the upper hand in any situation. Why Dark Magic had to be involved, the former Lord only now took the time to contemplate. Though he shared the belief that knowledge was power, and with magic that was even truer, Lucius wondered when it all had become about power, instead of what was best for their family. Knowing the darkest curses had certainly not helped, in the end.
Then Neville turned on the light to reveal their evidence board. Instantly all guests started to talk on top of each other and for once neither Neville nor Harry interrupted them. When Neville spotted Pince, the older Auror merely gestured for them to continue their discussion. Yet he did not leave, when the brunet nudged his colleague. As Harry approached him, and opened his mouth, likely to defend his decision to bring in his friends, Prince spoke up, "I apologize, Potter." When his Auror merely gapped at him, he continued, "I forgot who you were for a minute."
"George Weasley, Sir." With a smile, he shook the Auror's hand. "I once attended a guest lecture you gave on the W.U.L. (Wizards University London) on Transformative Spell-Design for Analytic Purpose. It was enlightening!"
"She slapped me if you have to know. Not that it is any of your business," Severus growled. "And though she had a bout of accidental magic when she learned that Lucius knew before her, I doubt that she could hex or curse anyone without a wand."
"'ncle Harry!" Rose crooned, but one look at Harry's face told Ron that this was not a social visit. Harry was pale and jittery. So, the redhead picked up his daughter and instructed, "Brooms are in the shed. Yours too. Cast a disillusionment charm. The neighbour's kids are having a sweet sixteen party in their back garden and a broom would certainly draw unwanted attention."
Severus tried to take it all in. But it was a lot. Nearly too much to wrap his head around it. Also, he could see the boys drooping, so now was not the time to discuss this. Gesturing weakly towards the chair, he ordered hoarsely, "Sleep."
Noises from the second bedroom drew Draco's attention. As he listened to the door, he could hear Harry's despairing voice.
Reaching out, stopping herself shy of her child's face, his mother whispered, "I will try my very best. But now you have to give him the stone, love."
"Because wizards have no means to hide their homes in even the most suburban neighbourhood," Pince sneered. "Believe me, Potter, between Longbottom and me, we'll have a warrant by tomorrow mid-morning the latest."
Holding out his left wrist, Severus demanded to know, "If I took this off and put it on Draco, would it protect him as it would me?"
At least that was what the mind-healer every Auror was expected to see once per month had said. Harry even liked Charles Young, though his questions were pretty invasive, he always gave the young Auror the feeling that he was on his side, as eager to put him to work again, as Harry was to return to it. Also, he was the only person at the office he accepted a 'temporary leave' from, convinced that it was in his best interest. It had happened only once, until now, but afterwards, Harry had to admit, that he
"No?" George challenged, folding his arms, glaring. He wanted this fight, needed it because it seemed to be the only way to get rid of all the pain that filled his heart every day he woke up without his twin by his side.
"How?" Ron asked, confused by the logistics. His sister merely rolled her eyes at him. "All of us touching Harry brings us in close proximity anyway. We lose our shirts, our shoulders touch, that leaves our hands free to anchor Harry and the building together."
Clutching his walking stock, Lucius ground his teeth, barely holding back from clocking the man. Recalling his upbringing, he managed to reply calmly, "I am afraid, I do not have any liberties in that matter."
With unexpected insight, the older wizard asked, "Harry, why would you think I consider this a competition between your father and me?"
"That was quite an entrance you made," Robarts commented when he and his most famous Auror met at the bar.
"One thing he does right," she remarked before gesturing towards the pipes. "Well, go on then. I want to know what my husband and child are talking about."
Clutching the stone for a moment, Draco tried to shove the boy's present at his host after that moment of hesitation. "Because it was meant to be yours. Teddy said so. I have no intentions to compete with you, over your godson's affection."
Imagining a child with silver-grey eyes and ebony hair, Harry nodded decisively. "By them and by us. I can't imagine not loving a child that shares even the tiniest bit of Draco."
Offering a word of caution, Lucius inquired, "Are you sure it is wise to leave a pregnant woman alone with a possible adversary who can clearly cast very advanced magic? With but one Auror for protection?"
want to talk about it, alright?!" The raven-haired snapped, but Neville appeared unconcerned as he distributed their late breakfast over their tables before claiming his seat. After helping himself to some tea and a bagel, he continued in a warmer tone, "You are aware that you have to. Not to me, of course, but certainly to Astoria and most definitely to Draco!"
"It's parselmagic." Hermione shared calmly. "Harry made it for Lucius specifically, because he was afraid something like this would happen."
" Harry whined, "But I hate giving interviews; especially to that newspaper! They never print the truth!"
Yet the young man interrupted her quietly. "Let me care about the how for the next few days. Eat your soup. I will wake you up around six, so you have time to prepare yourselves before we depart."
"The wards?" The wizard had asked confused but interrupted himself when bandages appeared out of thin air, wrapping themselves around his wound. As soon as that was finished, Emerald had climbed into his lap, hugging him close. In an instant, he had been transported back to his bed. Severus would never admit to the tremor that had run through him, as soon as he had sunken back into his pillows. At the snap of little fingers, a glass, filled to the brim with amber liquid, had hovered in the air before him. He had reached out, wondering if he would give himself alcohol poisoning, if he drank all of it.
At Severus' choked gasp, the young man abandoned his light, in favour of conjuring an armchair for his old teacher to fall into as Severus' knees gave out. He did not need any illumination to know that the man had gone pale, close to fainting. After a few heartbeats of harsh breathing in the darkness of the vault, Severus wanted to know, "Am I dreaming?"
"He neglected to accept Fred's part of the company, because no matter what he does, no matter how much work he puts into it, he knows that he will never live up to Fred's legacy, and he does it still. So, don't you dare trade Ron for Fred. Not even for a heartbeat. He deserves so much better than that. Especially from you!"
“The index in the library, the one you said did not work for you. How does this … glitch manifest itself?”
Knowing how this had to look, the former Lord slowly sank to his knees. Voldemort had cherished such docile gestures while explaining, “During your conversation with Mr Longbottom on Sunday, you mentioned not being able to charge your latest prisoner. I thought I might be able to find something to help. I swear, my Lord, on the lives of my family, I had no ill intentions!” For a heartbeat, Lucius thought he could see understanding and mercy in Potter’s eyes, but when someone tried to open the door, his impassive mask snapped back in place.
"No, but it can call upon the souls of those who linger. You can see them … talk to them and … apologise …" he finished quietly, lost in the memory of his first and last encounter with his best friend in more than 30 years.
Smiling, Harry shared, "India. This is a picture of the Golden Temple in Amritsar. After Voldemort … I told you that Ron and Hermione had to kick me out of my own house because I was hiding from the world. India was one of the countries I visited. This picture was actually painted by a local witch. She told me that I could hear the temple gong if I just listened hard enough."
"I wish I could help you," he whispered, more to himself since his professor had made it clear that he did not have the slightest interest in any form of communication. "I wish I could make you see that this is your chance to finally live the life you have always wanted. I've planned it all quite thoroughly. Even Draco approves," he added with a forced smile, hoping that the mentioning of Snape's godson would elicit a response. Still … nothing. "I told Emilia to kick your ass, verbally of course. But I guess I was wrong there as well. I hoped that you would be defiant if someone challenged you. However, it seems that that hope was in vain."
Then he pulled out his wand, making both of his parents' gasp. With a few, well placed, cutting hexes, the lowest branches fell away. At a swift swish and flick, they hovered into a corner, and a levitation spell moved the cage into the greenery.
Petting her patiently, he replied proudly, "We managed to feed her a potion in the morning, that was laced with a mild pepper-up for animals and an appetiser. Since then, she has eaten an entire pound of cooked chicken breast."
Chuckling, Neville stole the last muffin, before he reminded his friend, "What about Yule and Samhain? The circle of life, of power, accompanies us all through the year. We share these celebrations with an open heart, and our magic connects us. Not only hour home but to those around us and the earth, water, air and spirits. These days are not meant exclusively for the deity they are connected to. They are free for every witch and wizard to enjoy."
Neville, however, shook his head, explaining patiently. "She was the first girl you kissed. You fell in love with her. Then you fell out of love with her. Just within the span of a few weeks."
Rolling his eyes at the formal words, Harry held Draco back one last time, with a warning, "Malfoy!"
"It would be my pleasure, Mr Pince," the witch assured, allowing herself to be guided with his hand covering hers on his arm. When they passed through the door, she advised, "Close your mouth, Harry."
"Riding it is then." He had never felt particularly comfortable on horseback and had never seen the need to learn at Hogwarts. But Andromeda had made it clear that a young man of social standing was expected to ride. It was a skill one had to possess, like knowing which cutlery to use. Since Teddy had been afraid of horses at the beginning, Harry had offered to join him in his lessons. They had learned together.
After the meal, Draco was content to let the young woman pull her friend into the living room for some muggle television, while he cared for the dishes. The blond felt something akin to pain when he peeked in on them, finding the couple entwined on the sofa, Harry softly snoring in the young woman's arms.
Jumping to his feet, Harry beamed at the older witch. "I … thank you, professor. And thanks for the tea."
Looking at his friend, Harry shrugged. "If your whole life was so tangled up in it, wouldn't you too?"
Opening and closing his mouth, his superior watched his fish impression for a heartbeat, before gesturing, "Take him away, Longbottom."
"I already said that I was sorry," Lucius offered weakly. He was aware that he had shown an appalling amount of bad judgement, and a hideous lack of self-restraint. But, … "What more can I do?"
School, for example, would become skuhl because ‘sch’ is spoken as ‘sk’ and double ‘o’ sounds like a long ‘u’.
"It's the wand of the Black families' matriarch. How could I not know? We may not have talked for many years, but I can see the difference in a witch who carries a wand and one who doesn't. Also, being close to that particular wand … it soothes me. Like it knows when family is near."
"Wanna bet?" His partner challenged, grinning from ear to ear. He picked up a little bucket of gardening tools Harry kept in a cupboard near the back entrance, before opening the door. "Luna showed me this amazing trick where …"
Having been married long enough to know when it was better for his health to yield, Lucius did as ordered. His wife, however, seemed hardly placated by his compliance, because her cold eyes did not weaver. Towering over him, she stated coldly, "And while we are at it: stop this useless and frankly pathetic wallowing in self-pity. Your parents have raised you with more dignity. Your liege is angry with you? Well, what do you think the trip to the pet-shop was for? You humiliated Harry, by implying that he has nefarious intentions towards our son, despite him never giving even the slightest in that direction. Hence, he paid you back in kind. The fact that you took his wand was conveniently glossed over, and you should thank the heavens for that! He is not the Dark Lord, … Voldemort. He offers punishment that befits the crime. You suffered it. Now it's over! Draco has offered him more torment and humiliation during their school years than we ever could. Still, Harry does everything in his power to accommodate him. We were all scared when he started shouting. Still, our son had enough confidence to approach him and calm him down. For
"I could …" Draco piped up from outside the door, but his words were cut off by a flicker of Snape's wand. Yet, instead of explaining himself, the wizard merely repeated, "You are not my caretaker."
That's why Harry enjoyed a strong cup of tea at quarter past two in the afternoon, along with a delicious roast-beef sandwich, before he banished an irritated Kreacher from the kitchen. Basically, the guests tonight would mirror those from Yule, so the muggle-raised wizard had decided to go with the classics. A solid English Breakfast could never go amiss. So, he started preparing the dough for scones, fresh bread and wrapped up a few packages of toast. While he could finish baking the scones tomorrow, there was not enough form for the bread and the mushrooms and the fried tomatoes. Everything that could be prepared in advance was cut, diced and seasoned before Harry packed it up and put it under a preservation charm.
When the raven−haired noticed Draco turning around, he closed his eyes and breathed evenly. "No," he heard the blond admit before the door opened and closed.
"But I couldn't even brew any of them." The other man mumbled. "I would need a proper laboratory, and … a wand." He added quietly.
Messing up his already tousled hair, the young man nodded. "A body can sustain only so much injury before it does not accept magical healing any longer. I know the Greengrasses are an old family, but Astoria won't be able to suffer such damage regularly without any lingering after-effects."
Then Harry pulled out the other pair and held it out for the Potion Master. Quietly, he admitted, "I don't think these are precious or special. But they were well-loved, and …"
Exhaling quietly, Harry shook his head. "No, Draco, I am not angry. I am relieved. But I would prefer something like this not happening again."
Having just left the library, Narcissa came face to … well, she actually had to look down at the house elf that had served the Black−family for nearly a century. She could not help her smile since he, despite being considerably older than the last time she had seen him, still wore the same grumpy expression she remembered, "Kreacher."
"Not really," the raven-haired shook his head, somewhat apologetic. Neville seemed to feel uncomfortable with the entire topic, and that had certainly not been his intention.
The man was apparently hesitant to let his wife pull him out of the room, but knew better than to defy her when she used that tone.
It was still rare for said young wizard to sleep through the night. But since Severus had woken, Draco had gotten used to a decent amount of rest. Still, after a particularly uncomfortable nightmare about a snake swallowing down a snow fox, he sat in his bed with a magazine, petting Inari who seemed utterly comfortable with getting her fluffy little butt scratched at 2 a.m. in the morning. She was shedding more and more of her winter-coat these days. Draco's bed-covers were already more white than green. All of a sudden, he heard a 'thump' from downstairs. He wanted to brush it aside as a figment of his imagination, but a few seconds later, Harry's door opened and closed. Draco was just tying his dressing gown when he caught up with Potter outside of his door.
Familiars, true familiars were rare, especially in their part of the world. Everything was just too … domesticated in Wizarding Kingdom. India had been different, Harry recalled. The very earth had been fuelled with magic, and every other witch or wizard had had a magical animal by their side. Sometimes to help with their spell-work, but mostly just to keep them company. The most amazing magical beast the young wizard had come across had been a black leopard, who had chosen a witch barely out of her diapers. Her raw magic had manifested in the growth of the most marvellous fruits and flowers in her parents' garden. And all the majestic beast had to do to enable her, was nap on the roof of her small house, at the edge of the jungle.
"Preferably," Harry shrugged, "but if at all possible, no torture scenes or muggle burnings." At Neville's suspicious glance, he defended himself. "What? Walburga had a really disturbing taste in decorations. Just remember the elven heads in the corridor."
"What if I told you," Hermione had commented offhandedly during tea that day, "that I still don't trust you? That I am merely tolerating you because Harry asked me and that I feel the need to triple-check every information you give me since you were a death-eater and therefore not trustworthy."
Since the raven-haired had managed to tame his mop for once, making it stand up to reveal his scar, they looked about the same height. An impressive couple that surely deserved all the gossip that filled the room. Still, the Auror smiled when a shocked quiet spread, looking over his shoulder at his friends and their escorts for the evening.
"It was mostly Celtic gods in Britain, but when the Roman Empire invaded, the Roman and Greek Pantheon was introduced," Neville explained the next day over breakfast. Fortunately, Monday was slow going, giving the two Aurors time for their somewhat unusual discussion. "Spirituality is very personal and usually not discussed in public. Even witches and wizards who seek guidance from the same deity don't always lean towards the same aspects, lending to friendly - and sometimes not so friendly - discussions amongst peers."
Ron's incredulous words cut through the silence of the attic, not long after sundown. Though he had planned to follow his wife before dinner, being so close to finally succeeding had kept him at Grimmauld Place and the blond's side, who now stood frozen beside him, staring at the steaming cauldron.
Thank you all for reading and commenting but most importantly for sharing my joy in a piece of fanfic I really have fun working on.
When the young man did not move, she nudged him down the stairs and ushered him on, until he passed the gate. Once he was gone, she turned around and folded her arms before her chest, glaring at Harry. "Alright, Potter, spill! What's going on here?"
Calling upon his pureblood mask, the man made an inviting gesture, "By all means. I am not a delicate flower that will wither at a cant remark of you."
Twisting from side to side, Harry asked tense, "Excuse me?" He might be an Auror, but him hearing voices never boded well.
The Irma Pince of this timeline, however, seemed unwilling to depart, "But they are so close! Narcissa really understands. With her help, we might succeed!"
"Exactly," Neville grinned proudly. "My devotion and time went into creating it. Here it's our vertical garden."
Once the drama had played out, Draco went to search for Harry. As expected, he found him at the heart of a pile of children, who were wrestling their favourite uncle to the ground. Aiming to preserve at least a little of his dignity, the blond approached the shrieking and giggling heap and inquired, "I would very much like to freshen up and change. Could you point me to my bag?"
"But my father does not have that advantage. The two of you are bound by an ancient rite. What you do, what you think, even how you feel influences him to a certain degree. Not so much at the beginning, but the connection deepens over time. Did you not notice that he was a lot more composed during Christmas? You were relaxed and happy. Both of you! Only recently have you become agitated again."
They had returned, with a vengeance, after he had brushed down the last of the walls, exchanged the last of the drapes and dusted off the last of the furniture. Harry had fallen into a hole, swallowed by his own memories of torture and death. Sleeping had become a distant memory and eating a once-in-a-day occurrence. He had cared for his live-in house guest better than himself, and the man had been in a coma since the day of the Battle at Hogwarts.
The pureblood was surprised when Potter's chuckle pulled him out of his thoughts. Still, he enjoyed the open smile the young man displayed after this sombre conversation. "I'll be grateful for all the help and knowledge you can give me. But, Lucius, I see the way you act around your family. The length you are willing to go to protect your son. That is all the proof I need. Above all else, be a loving husband and a caring father. That is enough confirmation for me to know that I have made the right decision."
"But compulsion spells on that level are horribly hard to predict," she sighed. "When you allowed your vassal to work for me …"
"You know, I don't even want to know." Pulling the smaller wizard into a hug, George whispered, "Thank you, Harry. I really appreciate it."
Entering with a smile, the blond was on his way to ask, "How do you …" but then interrupted himself halfway through the sentence to inhale deeply. "Is this a 'Remus Special'?"
Horrified, the former Lord shook his head, reaching for his son, who merely stepped back, closer to his host, and evaded his gaze. “Draco, no …” The white-haired man whispered, before searching Harry’s gaze, pleading. “Not my son, please. Send me back to prison. I don’t even care, just … Draco has suffered enough. Please …”
Harry was already waiting for Kreacher with his duvet folded up on the bed. With a small gesture, he sent the elf back to his cupboard under the sink before he made himself at home in Draco's room. He pulled the trembling blond close and did not even bother with an alarm spell, confident that the rising sun would wake him. Draco did not seem particularly fond of the dark, so he never closed his curtains. Very much like Harry himself.
