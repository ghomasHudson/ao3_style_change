could stand to be around him, he couldn’t be as bad as everyone thought.
“So? Doesn’t mean we’re friends.”
Draco thought of his mother, all alone in the manor with no one to talk to and nothing to keep her mind occupied. At least he now had Harry (whatever ‘had’ actually meant), but she had no one. He’d been sending her letters every week and she’d responded to every one straight away. He wished he was a better son. A better son would have insisted he stayed with her instead of abandoning her to go back to school. A better son would wright her every day. But he’d been distracted. And he found he didn’t really know what to tell her about what he’d been doing and how he was. He couldn’t exactly tell her he’d been spending most of his time pining after Harry Potter and thinking about him non stop. He could hardly find the words to put on the blank parchment every week beyond asking how she was and reporting how his classes were going.
Draco watched this interaction with curiosity, wondering how many times Harry had done this before. When Harry looked his way, he schooled his features into an unimpressed expression. Harry just shrugged and grinned, picking up two plates and pushing one into his hands.
Draco looked slightly dazed when Harry glanced back at him, before he visibly composed himself, his face returning to its usual neutral expression. He reached behind him and returned the pot to his bedside table, then gave Pepper’s head a scratch, looking dejected. Harry didn’t know whether he was still upset about Hermione walking in or if there was something else bothering him.
Malfoy gave him a bewildered look. For a moment he looked like he was going to argue, his lips parted, but no words escaped. He abruptly shut his mouth, his features that were previously set in an expression of confusion, now in one of annoyance. He pointedly ignored Harry and looked back to the book he had been reading. A few strands of his blonde hair fell loose with the movement from where they had been neatly pushed back. Harry had the sudden urge to brush them back into place. He noted that he no longer slicked it back but rather let it fall in natural waves over his forehead, which he brushed back with his fingers to keep out of his eyes. It made him look less severe and more soft. Harry preferred it that way.
"Why?"
He hadn’t intended on getting a cat. He never particularly liked them, but when a kitten started following him home from his daily runs and started sleeping on his doorstep, he couldn’t exactly refuse to let her in. She was so skinny and her big green eyes were hard to say no to, so Harry had found any leftovers he had in his almost empty fridge and let her eat as much as she wanted. Then he had asked Hermione if she wanted a pet since he knew she liked cats. She had agreed to take her off his hands but when she came to pick her up, she had escaped her clutches as soon as she tried to take her out the door, running back to Harry every time. Hermione had been more offended by the rejection than she had let on.
“Traitor,” Potter said, frowning. “Why did you go to him?”
“What are you reading?” he asked.
"Harry..." he said softly, unaware that he had used his first name. "Please tell me you know that's not normal."
By now, he had come to expect Potter’s presents in potions and had long since grown used to the sound of his breathing in the bed next to his. But he did not expect him to follow him to the one place he got to be alone. He was both annoyed at the intrusion and pleased that Potter would bother coming to find him. He fought the feeling down and plastered his usual frown on his face.
“What did I say then?” she asked, folding her arms.
"Can we not talk about this..." Draco's anger melted away at Harry's small voice. He turned his head to look over at him, he looked heart-breakingly sad. Draco wanted to hug him.
Most of the time he wasn’t in classes, Harry was spending time with Hermione and Ron in the common room. They’d play wizard’s chess or Hermione would force them to do their homework or sometimes they’d just sit in silence, enjoying each other’s company. He liked spending time so much with his friends again, but more often than not he would find himself being either too restless to be sitting around so much or wanting to be alone.
“What’s wrong?”
“He overslept.”
“Then why do you keep bothering me?” There was an underlying tone of desperation to his voice that Draco tried to cover up with another glare. Still, Harry paused, looking slightly guilty. If he was going to force his presents on Draco, he would at least get an explanation on his strange behaviour.
"You used to sleep in a cupboard?"
It wasn't his destination that caught Harry's attention however, but the looks Malfoy was getting from other students. As he walked past, people would glare and mutter comments to their friends. Sometimes people would purposely bump into him, almost knocking him over. Harry was surprised by their clear dislike for Malfoy. Yes, he had been a Death Eater, but Harry thought it was obvious that he had hated Voldemort just as much as everyone else. The only reason he joined the Death Eaters in the first place was because he was scared, he had been miserable ever since Voldemort had given him the dark mark. Malfoy was an asshole sometimes but most of the time it was harmless. But maybe other people didn’t know Malfoy like he did. The thought was strange to Harry, did he really know Malfoy that well? Did Malfoy know him that well?
“I still don’t get it,” Ron said, his voice muffled by his hands that were currently covering his face. It was the eighth years free period and they were supposed to be using the time to study, and for once, they were doing as they were told. Harry, Ron and Hermione had spread their books and pieces of parchment over one of the tables in the library, so no one would sit with them. Pepper had wanted to come with Harry when he went up to his room to fetch his things, so he had brought her along too. She spent most of her time in his room while Harry was in classes so he would feet bad leaving her behind.
“I’ll be about half an hour,” he said and left.
piercing emerald-green eyes were trying to pin him down, and Draco couldn’t come up with a single good reason as to why he shouldn’t let them do just that. He swallowed hard, and straightening up a little, he disguised his squirm with a casual shrug of his shoulders, then smiled. Somehow, he managed to come up with a perfunctory response to Harry’s question.
Draco smiled.
“Certainly, pet.”
These days, Harry was even more than that. He was his anchor. Harry kept him sane and grounded to the real world, but was the only person who could take him out of it and transport him to this other place, a fantastic world of endless possibilities when he needed it the most.
Harry tilted his head a little, offering him access to his neck, and Draco accepted the invitation without the slightest bit of hesitation. He covered the side of Harry’s neck with tiny kisses and occasionally nipped at the skin but never sank his teeth into the delicate skin.
Potter instantly looked appalled and thoroughly outraged.
Charlie’s sudden change of topic throws Harry a bit, and it takes him a moment to make sense of the words ― or rather, decipher the message hidden inside that perfectly innocent statement.
“Yes, my little prince.”
“Given Sir’s true skillset, looking back, I finally understand just how much of his true self he held back. He fought extremely hard not to terrify me. Yet, the more dominance he exerted, however gently and subtly, the more I found myself craving it, needing it, wanting it, desiring it, and dreaming about the next time I might get the chance to let him take the lead. I lapped it all up. I wanted more, I wanted everything, yet I couldn’t understand why he was, seemingly, keeping me at arm’s length. You see, not even a vulgar proposition, a blatant invitation for him to bend me over his desk and have his wicked way with me, while we were having lunch in his office made him lose his cool―”
“Doesn’t often happen that you arrive earlier than me. Anyway, Potter, I hear congratulations are in order.”
The strange but amicable silence between him and Potter lasted for nearly forty-five minutes, then Potter’s resolve finally broke. Draco struggled to resist the temptation to commend Potter on his ever-increasing patience. It wasn’t something that came naturally to Potter but given how much time they spent together it had become something of a forced habit. Depending on the situation, the levels of Potter’s self-restrained varied considerably. The fact that he’d managed to brood for the better part of an hour impressed Draco, not that he was about to share that sentiment with Potter.
Draco choked on his fourth
“Yes, Sir.”
For a few minutes, he drifted from one thought to another but didn’t allow his mind to attach itself to anything in particular. Eventually, though, he found himself naturally gravitating towards memories of the time he and Draco had spent inside Draco’s great-great-great grandmother’s rose garden, and the many walks they’d taken together.
“You don’t need to, I believe you.”
Love,
Pressing the flat of his hand against the space between Draco’s shoulder blades, Charlie ran his hand up and down Draco’s back, hoping to soothe him that way.
As if the stone had been able to read Draco’s thoughts and feel his quiet reverence, the obsidian’s jet-black glassy outside shimmered underneath the bright light of the magical light floating just above Draco’s head. The abundance of the stone’s closely-spaced crystallites ensured that it was perfectly opaque and the spherical clusters of radially arranged, needle-like crystals only served to add to the stone’s shine. It was quite a piece of perfection.
Scar?
Harry blinked furiously and told himself that he wasn’t going to cry in front of Molly Weasley at the celebration of her fortieth wedding anniversary, but he couldn’t entirely stop his eyes from filling with water. They stung, and he blinked harder, then shook his head and embarrassed, he quickly looked away.
He was vaguely aware of the fact that someone had adjusted the spotlight and blinking he glanced around the room but couldn’t see much more than a sea of shadows, which suited him just fine.
Draco took a deep breath and uncrossing his arms, he sighed softly. He knew he could say no to answering Stefan’s question and that Stefan would respect it, but despite his usual hesitancy to show his vulnerability to anyone but Harry, he trusted Stefan enough to be honest with him.
“Yes, my love, only for me. That part of yours will forever be mine to treasure. Now, please tell me, how do you feel? Are the ropes too tight or can you take it?”
In that regard, Harry knew his husband exceptionally well and trusted his instincts to be able to read and interpret his emotions accurately.
The trial had brought to light that Zaytsev had been the mastermind behind several attempts on Harry’s life in the very early years of Harry’s career. Back then, nobody had ever managed to connect the dots. Zaytsev had been very careful, used exclusively local Lithuanian and Russian thugs to do his dirty work, and never once personally made a move up until the day of the conference. Like Voldemort, Zaytsev also preferred to only get his hands dirty when he thought that it was necessary to do so.
and chuckled.
Draco mewled.
“Good, I trust you to listen to your body and honour the signs, my little prince.”
“Yes.”
Harry swallowed hard and hummed. That invitation was one he could not resist.
Harry chuckled softly.
Harry waited patiently.
Draco whimpered but tried his best to remain still, and Harry continued to move the ice cube over Draco’s heated skin, only stopping once the last bit of it had fully melted into a small puddle of cold water that pooled between Draco’s shoulder blades.
Charlie shook his head, then remembered that Caleb couldn’t see him.
The moment the heavy wooden doors to her husband’s sanctum fell closed, she exhaled, then gathered up her skirts and dashed down the corridor, through the entrance hall and up the grand staircase. She slowed when she reached the gallery, curtly nodded at the various members of Lucius’ family, looking down at her from their portraits, and with her head held up high, she graciously and soundlessly glided over the thick dark-green carpet beneath her feet. She climbed another set of flights and found Dobby waiting for her at the top.
He didn’t have to ask twice.
Draco gave him a lopsided grin, Harry watched as he rose to his feet. He reached for the coffee pot and poured Harry a generous helping hot, freshly-brewed black coffee. The scent that wafted over to him was simply divine, but Harry resisted the urge to lean forward and reach for his full mug.
He kissed the top of Draco’s head again, and this time, he lingered a bit.
Walter nips at his trousers’ leg, but Harry, quite resolutely and very successfully―and he’s mighty proud of that feat―ignores him until he’s finished about half of his coffee. It’s only then that he sets his mug down for long enough to wrestle the ball from Walter and toss it out of the door and into the corridor. Walter barks loudly and chases after it. Harry briefly wonders whether that crup is ever going to grow up―he thinks not―then returns to drinking his coffee.
“The same goes for many other lifestyle-related things. That’s basic training of a sort. Two people could agree to enter into a D/s relationship for a pre-specified length of time, and that relationship could be sexual in nature, or it could exclude any and all sexual elements. The Dominant could, providing they are qualified, offer the submissive pointers on how to, for example, manage the household better, improve their interpersonal skills, learn various types of sexual services, or it could include a training course at an actual school where the submissive learns how to manage a business or coordinate an event; however, all of this could be entirely useless once that relationship ends.
“Come here, my cute little menacing dragon,” he whispered.
He rolled his hips, Draco arched his back, and he thrust down, then kissed harder and deeper before withdrawing to cover Draco’s throat with a million tiny kisses and also a few bites. Draco swallowed, his Adam’s Apple bobbed delightfully, and Harry continued to kiss him, covering his entire chest with licks, and tiny bites. He toyed with Draco’s nipples, biting and sucking them, then thrust his tongue into Draco’s navel and kissed it with as much fierceness as his mouth.
Draco shivered and squirmed, and Harry pushed his thumb just past his knuckle. He pressed the tip against the sensitive walls, then tongued Draco with wild abandon, determined to make him fall apart, delighting in the silky-smooth texture of the delicate skin around Draco’s most private part. Draco trembled, shuddered and shook, and his moans grew louder, filling the room and intoxicating Harry’s mind.
“I’ll trust you to know what’s best for an overworked, frustrated Department Head.”
“Never, monkey, you’re stuck with my nefarious ways until the end of time.”
“I prosecute criminals for a living, Stefan. I can tell when someone’s trying to stall for time.”
Since Draco’s arms were bound behind his back, Harry kept one arm securely fastened around Draco’s midriff, then moved to retrieve yet another coil of rope from his kit. He helped Draco to stretch out his legs, allowing him to sit rather than kneel, and without removing his arm from around Draco, Harry expertly adjusted Draco’s position, helping him to lie comfortably on his side. He supported Draco’s head, placed a pillow underneath it, checked his rope work, then reached for Draco’s right leg and bent it at the knee, tugging its heel underneath Draco’s arse.
Harry chuckled softly, then nodded.
“And then you’ll spend half the night chasing your toy broom around the corridors of the house because you can’t sleep.”
“Of course,” she said.
After purchasing a large assortment of freshly-baked French pastries, Caleb had suggested that they head back to his place and enjoy tea and coffee in his living room, although for the last hour and a half the four of them had simply lounged about on the comfortable leather sofas, nattering away about this and that.
He needed Harry to promise him to keep him safe almost as much as he needed to breathe.
“What do you mean he’s dropping?” he asked with a look of complete confusion.
The question surprised Draco somewhat, and opening his eyes, he looked up at Harry and blinked. He wanted to ask what Harry meant but couldn’t respond.
“Let’s see how much you’ll enjoy these.”
Within half an hour toys are strewn all over the place, and while Walter happily joins the madness and races around with the kids, Harry nearly stumbles over a charmed wizarding doll, then stubs his toe on a toy broom. He curses under his breath, finishes the rest of his coffee to numb the pain, then cleans up the kitchen. He uses magic to sweep the floor but washes all the dishes by hand and leaves them on the dish rack by the sink to dry.
She gave him a thoroughly withering look, though not because he and Draco had been completely lost in their own world and shared a kiss at her dining table, but because she’d clearly exerted a fair amount of effort trying to get them to listen.
, Draco pleaded with Harry in his head.
“Thank you, Director Potter, Sir.”
“It’s still a dragon, you know.”
“Care to hazard a guess?” he teased.
“Come on, let’s finish making tea and coffee. If we take any longer, both Caleb and Harry will come down here thinking we’ve abandoned them.”
“Let’s go have a shower and go for a walk; you can spank me some more tonight.”
“I’m afraid I don’t. Would you mind telling me?”
Draco sighed.
He neither shook his head nor blinked.
He was thoroughly amused.
It came with a separate bowl of warm custard.
“While I’m confident that you won’t go blabbing to the press, I need more reassurance. I hope you can understand that, Malfoy.”
“Long enough, Potter.”
Harry responded with a warm smile.
Draco inhaled through his nose, and making damn sure not to graze Harry with his teeth, he relaxed his throat muscles, and closing his eyes, he lost himself in the sensation of having Harry’s cock fill his mouth. He sucked, used his tongue and lips, and plenty of salivae to make the experience as pleasurable as possible.
He blinked and looked around the room.
Draco turned his head sideways and glared daggers at him.
Draco nodded.
Draco arched an eyebrow at his Auror partner of ten years, housemate of four, and arch-nemesis-turned-best-friend. Potter’s insistence was almost adorable, although Draco knew better than to tell Potter that. He did value his life.
“What are you apologising for now?”
“He’s awake,” his own voice told him.
“Here you are, Prosecutor Malfoy, Sir.”
“No fucking way. There isn’t enough money in the world to pay for how much I love this photograph.”
Draco spoke slowly, put special emphasis on each word, and felt like a complete idiot the entire three seconds it took him to pose his question to Potter, who merely gave him a funny look and a shoulder shrug.
Draco snapped his mouth shut and glared at him.
Following that statement, Harry had been stupid enough to ask for more details, and Draco had promptly subjected him to a two-hour rant about all the hoops he had to jump through during trial preparation and why the current Wizengamot legislators were lazy fuckwits. According to Draco, the present members of the legislative body were better suited to the task of mucking out the Thestral stables at Hogwarts, rather than debating the merits and demerits of the current Wizarding legal system.
“Get the hell out of my face, Potter, before I kick you up your very nicely-shaped, round and very firm arse.”
Draco lifted his paper cup to his lips and smirked against the white lid, then took two or three small sips in a row.
“Do it, my love,” he said, then slipped his hand into Draco’s and squeezed it softly. “Come on, I’ll take you back and wait until you’re ready to step onto the stage before I take my seat in the front row.”
He shrugged again.
Harry smiled.
Charlie nodded.
“What happened?”
His to hurt.
was, Draco most definitely wasn’t sure, and he wasn’t in any rush to find out. His obsession with Potter’s muscular body was inconvenient enough, and Draco had no desire to rack his brain for an explanation that adequately explained his and Potter’s interactions. Most of the time, he preferred not to dwell on anything that concerned Potter for more than a few minutes at a time.
“Diluted Calming Draught.”
“Sure, yes. Something urgent.”
Draco instantly melted into the kiss, mutely surrendering to its passionate force.
Draco opened his mouth to protest, but this time Charlie gave him a pointed look. He received an icy glower in response, and when Draco crossed his arms over his chest, Charlie couldn’t help but smile. He reached out, placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder and squeezed.
Draco breathed deeply and grinning stupidly, he sighed.
“Well, my little prince, since you’re asking so nicely, I’m certainly not going to turn you down,” Harry said.
“Admittedly, I do, however, that won’t stop me from directing a stinging hex into the general direction of your buttocks.”
In just a few minutes, they were due to showcase their teamworking skills, and because Harry had been distracted and perpetually lost in his own world ever since this morning, Draco found it hard to get into the zone.
Instead, he carried him out of the kitchen and slowly ascended to the third floor.
Vexed, he dropped his hands into his lap and twisted his fingers together. Sitting back, he rested the back of his head against the top of his office chair and focused on nothing in particular. Blinking several times in the hope that the added lubrication, the gesture provided, would help nourish and relax his tired eyes, Harry took a deep breath, held it in for a few seconds, then exhaled slowly and opened his eyes again.
Draco swallowed hard.
’ which Harry reciprocated with a warm smile.
“Please, just, please, anything.”
Harry laughed, and the sound of it made Draco’s soul dance.
Harry gently let the door close behind him, and as both Andromeda and Narcissa turned around, he smiled.
Scorpius took another long look at the moving photograph of Harry, then turned his head and looked at Draco but didn’t immediately say anything.
“Erm.”
“Not going to fight me for your right to dominance?”
“Yes, fair. You get over that stomach bug of yours first and then we’ll talk―”
He managed a weak smile.
Draco excused himself and fled the room before Harry could stop him. Harry only barely to contain his amusement and he made a mental note to mercilessly tease Draco over his beard fetish later tonight and any other chance he got.
Draco winked.
“Let’s celebrate.”
Harry nodded.
“Save that until after I’ve made you scream my name while you come all over yourself, Potter, if that’s the sort of ‘
Glancing at his half-eaten apple, and taking a large bite, he chewed and deliberately left Stefan hanging in the air, waiting for his answer.
He locked eyes with Harry, breathed deeply, and smiled.
She merely gave him a pointed look; the kind that said:
A broad smile graced Draco’s face.
During dinner, Roísín had relaxed a bit more, and Draco credited the wine for that. Harry disagreed, he thought the food was to blame and had praised him to the skies for his culinary skills. Draco had barely managed to hide his blush, and his collar had been the only thing that had stopped him from kicking Harry’s shin under the table.
Draco relaxed visibly and feeling pleased Harry watched as some of the tension, his little prince had been struggling to cope with, gradually dwindled away. It slowly seeped out of him, falling away like a heavy burden, he no longer felt the need to carry around with him.
“Potato, potahto. Doesn’t stop you from discontinuing the partnership?”
“I see,” he said, then coughed to clear his throat. “And what is it that I’m apparently more qualified to do?”
Harry beckoned Draco over and offered him a small cup of freshly-made fragrant espresso.
“We’re all eagerly awaiting the wedding of the century, that’s all,” he said.
“Aren’t you a force to be reckoned with,” he said with a fond undertone.
“No, but I’ll ask anyway.”
Draco, who’d lifted his croissant up to his mouth and had been about to take a bite, paused, lowered the pastry, and closed his mouth again.
“Hey, if it works, why change it.”
He slid off the barstool, and slipping his right hand into the right pocket of his trousers, he closed his fingers around a small box. Carefully pulling it out, he cast a wandless, wordless enlargement charm to restore the black satin box to its original size, and placing it on a clean napkin on top of the bar, he pushed the lid up.
Unless they eloped, a wedding reception, even a small one, was unavoidable.
“Yes, if Skeeter has taught her successor anything it’s that it’s important to sensationalise facts. They sell papers. You know as well as I do that the Prophet has always been good at fear-mongering.”
He wanted to bury his face in Harry’s neck and inhale his scent until he was heady with it.
Lily sounded quite like the grown-up and not at all like a fourteen-year-old girl about to return to Hogwarts for another year filled with Potions, Charms, Transfiguration, and other fantastic subjects.
He let another minute of silence pass between them, allowing the anticipation to build slowly and steadily. It was only when the tip of Malfoy’s perfectly pink tongue darted out of his mouth, and he wetted his lips that Harry allowed the fingers of his free hand to curl around the edge of his wooden kitchen table. Without further hesitation, he leant forward, closed the small gap between them and captured what was rightfully his.
Draco lowered his head in obvious surrender, and a jolt of excitement caused Harry’s chest to swell with pride.
Draco let out a silent scream, twisted his head, and Harry supported it, repeatedly running his fingers through Draco’s damp hair, stroking it, massaging his scalp.
Draco shook his head.
Once Rose and Hugo have rinsed all the soap off their hands, Harry reminds them to use a towel to dry their hands, then idly wonders whether anyone is hungry and would like to join him in the kitchen for a scrumptious breakfast for champions.
Scorpius nodded his head with some enthusiasm.
He smiled.
“I believe so, yes. But don’t you get any ideas, young man. Harry will have my head if I encourage you to venture into the Forbidden Forest in search of a unicorn. Besides, I’m pretty sure that your Care of Magical Creatures professor will cover unicorns in his class. They are exactly the kind of animal Hagrid would include in his curriculum.”
“Watch me, Malfoy,” he said, and before Draco could come up with a retort, Potter had turned on his heel, and all Draco could do was to watch him sure-footedly, and with his back ramrod straight, stride down the corridor that led towards the main hall and the lifts.
Draco frowned.
Draco pulled a face.
Not this time.
“I love everything you cook,” he said.
“Potter, I can nip over to Paris at any time, all it takes is one trip to the Portkey Administration Office and thanks to my badge, I’ll have a complete approval form within thirty seconds. The annual international MLE convention is hardly what’s going to convince me to drop my son off at the Manor and accompany you to spend my time sitting in boring meetings and listening to the pompous presentations of every single DMLE department across the globe trying to paint itself as the best one out there.”
“Draco, darling, you cannot be the Master of Malfoy Manor if you don’t live here.”
“Ow, whatever was that for?”
A light stinging hex hit Draco square in the arse, and he growled through gritted teeth.
“Yes, Sir, yes, I’ll be good.”
Draco’s cheeks pinked, and his eyelids fluttered as if he couldn’t decide whether to keep his eyes open or close them in resignation.
He pressed a kiss to Draco’s perspired forehead.
Harry ruffled his hair and its colour changed to jet-black beneath his touch, then turned turquoise again. That one prominent platinum-blond strand stubbornly remained.
Draco whimpered again, and Harry ran his hand down Draco’s left arm in search of his pulse point on the inside of his wrist. He found it without removing his lips from Draco’s neck, pressed his thumb against it, then circled the familiar spot.
“I do fancy a trip. Apparate us?”
“Draco Malfoy, you are the best thing that’s waltzed into my life since sliced bread.”
Had the absolute tosser really―
“I’ll be fine without it.”
“Yes, the annual international MLE convention,” he said. “I will, of course, be attending. It is of paramount importance that we continue to exercise transparency. Following our recent and very successful department restructure, I’m also looking forward to introducing our new teamwork system and perhaps get a few other Auror departments interested in adopting it.”
Harry couldn’t make any sense of it, and since he presently lacked the necessary caffeine to persuade his mind to focus, he decided to simply wait and see.
“The Mystery Guest Show?”
“I’m not even going to justify this idiocy with a response,” he drawled instead.
“Director Potter.”
Harry smiled.
“Do you want to cancel our dinner plans with Roísín?”
“Never mind you, darling, do you want to stay?”
Tired Draco liked cuddles, wanted love, a lot of it, was a bit needy and yawned a lot.
“Mine,” he growled.
“Potter, Malfoy! Only took you half a lifetime. Let me guess, you just couldn’t keep your hands off each other and had to do the dirty before coming over.”
Potter frowned at him.
Draco shook his head.
There were brown lentils and kidney beans, and peppers, onions, sweet corn and tomatoes and Harry could barely wait to pick up his fork and start eating.
With a smile, Harry wordlessly took Draco’s hands and lacing their fingers together, he pulled his husband out of the living room and down the entire length of the corridor. He wandlessly unlocked the door to a storage room that had once been a winter garden of sorts, but which they hardly ever used, and pushing the door opened, he pulled Draco through and used two more spells to unlock the door that led out into the small garden that belonged to Grimmauld Place.
“Here, put that on your wrist, the welts will be gone tomorrow. Your wrist will feel brand new.”
The gesture instantly drew Draco’s attention, and he moved his own hand closer to Harry’s but didn’t immediately place it right on top, leaving it up to Harry to do so.
“I’m waiting,” he said.
“Require any assistance with those proclivities?”
Harry instinctively raised his head, turned it sideways, and looked at him.
At the mention of something to drink, Lily’s eyes lit up a bit and sparkled with excitement.
“You don’t have to be anywhere, and I don’t need more than twenty minutes and your explicit trust.”
Draco lifted his head again, and their eyes met.
As Ron lowered his arms again, he casually placed one hand low on Hermione’s hip, and while leaning closer to her and kissing her cheek, he gave it a gentle and affectionate squeeze.
Blaise Zabini had been the only other person to write to him. His letter had arrived after Harry’s and his interview with the Prophet; it had been a short handwritten congratulatory message, and Draco had responded within days of receiving it and just like that he and Blaise had rekindled their Hogwarts friendship. These days, Blaise spent most of his time in America and hardly ever returned home to Britain. But he wrote, regularly. His letters weren’t long, but they were honest and kind.
A warm rumble of laughter erupted from the depths of Harry’s throat and the sound settled around Draco like a warm blanket.
“Later, Potter, I promise. We’ve got a long weekend coming up, and I intend to use up an entire pot of lube shagging you six ways to Sunday.”
“It suits you better like this, you know.”
Harry had half-expected that reaction.
“Mine, mine, mine.”
Draco licked his lips and nodded.
He couldn’t help but imagine a different set of cheeks in that same colour.
Harry smiled.
“Give her my regards.”
“Guilty as charged, Prosecutor Malfoy.”
“You know, Harry, I may come across as oblivious, but I notice things.”
His eyes sparkled with pure, unadulterated mischief.
Potter was an Animagus.
“Is my little prince feeling a bit feisty tonight? Come on, let’s take this upstairs, shall we?”
Potter narrowed his eyes, turning them into tiny slits.
“That’s my good boy.”
In Draco’s opinion, Harry almost looked a smidgeon too happy, but he couldn’t find it in him to begrudge Harry his juvenile joy.
Draco felt his restraints come off, but before he managed to move any of his limbs, Harry had already dragged him to his feet and yanked his arms behind his back, forcefully restraining him that way. The pain that surged through his arms and spread into his muscles was perfect, but Draco struggled anyway. Not much, just enough to force Harry to tighten his hold.
Draco’s bragging was absolutely endearing.
That was the final straw and unable to hold himself up any longer, Draco felt his hands slip off the steel bar. His knees felt like butter and promptly gave out under him.
“You certainly know exactly what to say, Draco Malfoy. My children hate and love me in equal measures,” she said, “but thankfully the grandchildren are still too young to judge me for being an overbearing mother hen.”
In my efforts to continue 2020 on a high, I've written 5000+ words today. It was positively cathartic. The words just flowed out of me and there was no stopping me until I'd finished the chapter.
Draco laughed.
“You’re my good boy,” he praised.
Draco considered the question for a few seconds and tried to think of an appropriate way to answer it. The answer, of course, was yes, but since he didn’t want to encourage Teddy, Draco decided on a mature response.
“I will, Molly, thank you,” he said, his voice low and quiet.
Draco mewled softly, and Harry smiled.
Harry smiled.
on it, everything on Draco’s desk was in perfect order, and Harry watched him reach for a carafe filled with water. He refilled his empty glass, took a few sips, then set it down on a coaster beside the carafe.
A few months ago, they’d met Malcolm and his partner Andrej for coffee at a small coffee shop near Kensington Gardens, and Draco had instantly fallen in love with the espresso machine at the café.
Harry’s question cut through the thick fog inside his brain and all Draco could think was that yes, anything for Harry. Anything he wanted, when he wanted it.
He did, however, squirm and tried to get away.
“So, there’s absolutely nothing sexy about your boyfriend wearing a pair of perfectly-shaped running shorts, showing off his muscular thighs and firm calves and peeling a very sweaty t-shirt off his torso, exposing a nice set of abs?”
“You will pay for this, Potter.”
“I’m confident we’ll find you something suitable. We have quite the selection, and even if we don’t have it in-store, if it’s in our catalogue, I can order it from the warehouse, and they’ll deliver it within twenty-four hours. Do you know the size you need?”
“Florin is a bit younger than you, Harry, he’s just turned twenty-nine, but he’s a pretty sensible bloke. He studied Magizoology in Germany and attended Beauxbatons, so you’ll find he speaks fluent French on top of fluent German and English. He’s a handsome devil, I guarantee you that, and he’s most definitely not interested in the fact that you’re Harry Potter.”
Following the successful apprehension of the madman who had ruined his and Draco’s entire presentation―and most likely also destroyed any chance that the international Auror community would ever take him and his ideas seriously―Harry had turned to the Head of the French Auror Department for help.
On the way over to the door, Harry allowed himself another stretch, then rolled his shoulders in the hope to ease out a few more kinks. The relief he felt was marginal, and he couldn’t help but wonder whether he might be able to convince Draco to spoil him with a full-body massage once he got home later tonight. He stifled a yawn and reaching for the door handle, he turned it and opened the door to his office only to find Draco stood right in front of him. Draco had his hand raised―he’d clearly just been about to knock―and looked mildly surprised over the fact that Harry had pulled the door open before he’d been able to announce his presence.
He rolled onto his back and stretching his muscular arms, he folded them behind his head and blinked―somewhat bleary-eyed―at the canopy of his massive bed.
Harry finished by pressing a lingering kiss to the love bite he’d just left on Draco’s neck, and Draco exhaled.
“You were perfect, thank you, my boy.”
Draco frowned and fixed him with a dark glower.
Chuckling at his own silly mawkishness, Harry traced a Double Carrick Bend onto Draco’s back and delighted in the mixture of a low hum and a content sigh that escaped past Draco’s lips. Encouraged, Harry traced a beautiful Celtic Knot onto Draco’s pale skin, and finally, a Fisherman’s Eye, weaving lines of invisible rope together to create a stunning pattern. He wasn’t drawing the most intricate of knots, but with no actual rope to play with, Harry was happy to leave it at that.
Draco laughed and looking up at Harry, he raised a questioning eyebrow at him.
Walter barks once in confirmation though he didn’t have to, one look at his face tells Harry all he needs to know, and not bothering with his bathrobe, Harry shuffles out the door and stomps down the corridor and into the bathroom. It’s tough to stomp when one is wearing nothing more than a pair of soft slippers but Harry still tries his best. For just a moment though, a minute second, he misses his Auror-issued dragonhide boots. They are catching dust somewhere in a dark corner of his wardrobe, he knows that much, and although there are days when he’s tempted to take them out, put them on, and then slip back into his old Auror uniform, he always resits.
“I’ll miss them,” she says.
Potter sounded a lot less adamant than he had before and the tone of his voice told Draco that he had as good as managed to wear Potter down. He wasn’t about to push, though, and instead of insisting, he tried to remove his hand from Potter’s shoulder. It didn’t exactly come as a surprise to Draco when Potter’s Seeker-influenced Auror skills kicked in, and within the duration of a second, his hand left the coffee mug on the worktop in front of him. It landed on top of Draco’s hand and squeezed.
alone. We’re a team.”
“Draco!”
Harry squeezed his shoulders, massaged his upper arms, then ran his hands down to his wrists and pulling them up, he guided them over his head. Draco voluntarily raised his arms and hands up, and when he felt Harry guide him to the metal bar above them, he obediently wrapped his fingers around it and held on tightly.
“Love.”
“You don’t need to call me Sir, my little prince. We have discussed this. If you’re more comfortable calling me Harry while Roísín is around then that’s what we’ll settle one, and it won’t diminish your submission to me in the slightest. Also, if you’re uncomfortable showing Roísín a more intimate aspect of your submission, we needn’t do it at all. Roísín might be a novice, but she’s a smart girl.”
Instead of swallowing the drink immediately, he let it rest on his tongue for a moment to better savour the taste, then inhaled deeply, exhaled, and swallowed.
Draco actively stopped himself from drifting down memory lane.
“Can you do one more?” he asked.
He felt Harry’s hand rest just above his stomach, felt his fingertips toy with the fine dusting of blond, trimmed hair and desperately wanted to drop to his knees.
Harry’s smile grew into a wide grin.
“Drop it,” he hissed between gritted teeth.
“Your magical signature, please.”
“On our first date, you promised to take me to Canada someday.”
“Here? Now?” Draco asked.
It was very clearly a bait, and trying his hardest not to smirk, Harry held Draco’s gaze for the longest time, then clicked his tongue.
Humour me, the crazier the better...
“Soon, my little prince, soon,” he promised.
“You know Malfoy, I do like a bit of a show, and I enjoy watching a fit bloke pleasuring himself, working on getting himself off, except I’m entirely disinclined to let you come any time soon. That hard prick of yours is making you perfectly obedient, and I just know you won’t dare to talk back because if you do, you can forget about your own release. I’ll leave you hanging and desperate, and I won’t lose any sleep over you not getting to orgasm.”
“Just a bit tired,” he said quietly.
Black Fluff Nightshade Malfoy was presently curled up on a stack of old books in the top right corner of Draco’s reading desk but stirred and blinked sleepily when her new mother approached. It stretched, yawned, licked its right front paw, wiped it across its nose, then curled up and went back to sleep.
“Yes, please,” he said.
“I have a feeling I might get something out of him. I’ve an idea. It might be a complete shot in the dark, but it’s not like we’ve got anything to lose.”
The room disappeared, and he and Malfoy vanished into thin air. They left the celebrations behind without as much as a ‘
Harry felt his nerves dissipate. His signature boldness was more potent and more powerful, and even though they initially tried to resist, the butterflies in his stomach gradually calmed down. They grudgingly returned to their home in the pit of his stomach.
“Then tell me.”
“Don’t mock the man, my love, I told you before, Charlie’s seriously fantastic with a whip, and he’s absolutely right in saying that I’ve got nothing on him. He’ll whip an apple off your head without you ever feeling the breeze or hearing the faintest crack.”
Despite having a signed contract in place, one they regularly reviewed and updated, Harry’s and his D/s dynamic was a lot more fluid and most of the time Harry’s dominance over him and his submission to Harry started with a bit of playful banter. Sometimes it was just that, and sometimes it blossomed into something a lot more serious. Somehow, Harry always knew precisely what he needed, and whenever Harry asked him how he felt and what he wanted, well, that was just Harry’s way of encouraging him to be open about his needs and desires. It was something that he’d found very difficult in the beginning, but these days it was slowly becoming more comfortable, and he largely blamed it on the fact that he trusted Harry explicitly and unconditionally.
“Prosecutor Malfoy, what brings you up here?”
“Will you come without permission?”
It was a provocative stare.
Narcissa flashed him a wicked smirk.
His blush had faded away again but, in its place, his eyes had a roguish sort of shine to them.
“Good girl. I’ve got a lot of work to do today, but I’ll try and find some time for you and Hugo, I promise.”
“Bold,” he said.
“But I like sweets,” he said with a pout and licked the entire length of the lollipop slowly and lasciviously.
“I’ll take conundrum over anything the press, the ministry, or any healer in the world would say about me.”
He and Draco had already celebrated, in the privacy of their bedroom and upstairs in the playroom.
Harry smiled.
“He’s family.”
Across from him was a single wall-mounted bed without a mattress.
They closed around it, and the pressure of Harry’s thumb circling over his pulse point helped Draco to centre and ground himself.
He expertly fastened the collar around Draco’s neck, and sealed it with a murmured incantation, feeling Draco shudder at the wisp of magic that washed over him. He gave the O-ring a tiny tug, then kissed Draco, starting slow, then gradually increasing the depth and intensity of the kiss.
“I’ll never match your level of deviousness.”
“You look stunning tonight,” he whispered.
Draco laughed.
A faint knock on the door to his workroom broke Draco’s concentration and carefully placing the carving knife back inside its box, he reached for a brush and waved his other hand to wandlessly cast a non-verbal unlocking spell. The door opened and the brush still in hand, Draco turned his head just enough to be able to look back over his shoulder.
Dobby smiled at her, then bowed low, so low in fact, that his large, long ears, touched the floor.
Harry gave him a lopsided grin, and summoned the strange aged paper into his outstretched hand, then looked at the card. It only had three words written on it.
Ron followed her, carrying a second tray with four plates. Three of the places had chocolate pudding on it, and one had a rather large piece of treacle tart on it.
Draco huffed out a breath of air and crossed his arms over his chest in clear annoyance.
Harry resisted the urge to smile. He wanted to, quite desperately, but he knew better than use witty sarcasm. It was the least Draco needed right this moment.
Draco moaned and whimpered, and his eyes fluttered open and closed.
“Do you think I should?”
An hour later, when they arrived back at Grimmauld Place, Draco was still in a huff or at least pretending to be, though he was confident that he wasn’t doing a good job at sulking away. This resolve was beginning to wear thin, and it was all Harry’s fault or at least he wanted it to be Harry’s fault.
Smiling to himself, Draco allowed himself a moment to recall Harry’s and his one and only official interview. He had very fond memories of that day. How could he not? While he’d been a bundle of nerves about ready to crawl into his closet and lock the door from the inside, Harry had gallantly defended his honour and outright demanded that the Wizarding World respect their private lives.
Harry’s question instantly pulled Draco out of all of his musings. It was like the mere sound of Harry’s voice, the gentle way with which he drew his attention, was enough to quieten to the multitude of thoughts running rampant in Draco’s mind. He lifted his gaze, met Harry’s eyes, and with a soft smile, he nodded.
“You tried that, Malfoy, it didn’t work. I am charging you with attempting to bribe an officer of the law.”
He paused for a moment, admired his handiwork, caressed it with an intimate sort of tenderness, and revelled in the fact that Draco continued to thank him. His heart felt like he was about ready to explode with all the love he felt for Draco and overwhelmed by the intensity of it all; he heaved out a sob.
“You proposed,” Draco murmured.
He smiled, then resolutely headed for the door, pulled it open, and left.
Harry smiled.
The engagement ring―everyone knew what that meant―but this, this was special, and somehow, it meant the world to Draco. It was something between them, yet at the same time, those familiar with kink would know exactly what it represented. He belonged to Harry forever. Harry had claimed him as his own; any Dominant, or submissive, would know that.
“I love you too, my little prince.”
Harry took a moment to respond and to bridge his intentional silence, he once again applied a bit more pressure to Draco’s wrist, drawing circle after circle.
“I’d have helped him anyway, but Reid there insisted on calling me a B.R.A.T.”
Instead, he’d concluded that he rather enjoyed the challenge of trying to guess Potter’s current mood or the puzzle of what whatever was going on in his mind, what captured his attention, what distracted him time and time again, and what left him entirely unfazed.
Selly
. In a coffee shop, being rude to customers was detrimental to the health of the business. Although he’d, at least in the beginning, often felt like cursing everyone and everything, he’d quickly learnt to adapt. Years had passed, and while his newly acquired habits certainly hadn’t turned Draco into a completely different person, they absolutely had given him a different, more positive outlook on life.
“Kneel for me, my little prince.”
“Such a good boy, I love it when you’re like this when you give me free rein to do as I please with your body and mind, knowing I’ll never take things too far.”
It was Harry’s turn to laugh.
He filled his air with lungs, then responded.
“How did you get over it?”
“Like absolutely nothing and nobody matters. Like he’s some divine god that descended from the Heavens and made you his. Like his soul is the missing half that completes yours. It’s easy to see when you’ve someone in your life you feel exactly that way about. AJ is my Harry.”
“Precious, just precious,” Harry whispered.
Draco laughed.
“What do you mean?” Potter asked.
Draco shuffled beside him, and Harry watched him swallow hard as Draco’s stunningly beautiful eyes hungrily travelled over his naked body, drinking everything in.
“For now, yes. Come on, Tom, surely, you’re not deluded enough to think you can beat me? You’ve about one hundred wands trained on you and these Aurors will kill you if they perceive you to be a threat.”
Taking one last deep breath, Draco walked up to the counter and stood next to Harry. He stood close enough to make it evident that they belonged together but kept just enough distance to keep Harry’s and his public display of affection to a minimum. Much to his surprise, he caught the elderly man behind the counter looking at them both with a certain kind of fondness.
“The kids―” he murmured, then trailed off, unable to continue.
“Not a bother. That’s what friends are for. Keep me in the loop, yeah?”
“Very mature, Potter,” he drawled.
Some thirty seconds or so passed, then the Portus spell activated. The dragon reserve headquarters’ small Portkey office began to swirl around him, rapidly spinning out of focus, and something similar to a hook behind his navel pulled Charlie towards his destination.
He nibbled on Draco’s earlobe, bit it gently, then chuckled.
Draco blinked and curling his fist around the edge of the paper, he pressed his lips tightly together and glowered darkly. At this very moment in time, his desire to commit murder was deep-seated and burnt enthusiastically in his chest.
Harry shuddered a little at the idea that Narcissa thought of him as her second son.
After they’d calmed down, Harry had demanded to sample the types of coffee beans, Draco had used to describe the children. It had taken a bit of time for Harry to discern all the different flavours, but after a while, he’d found himself agreeing with Draco’s descriptions. Ever since that very memorable morning, labelling the children with various coffee flavours had become their own little inside joke and Draco loved that somehow, coffee had trickled through every aspect of their lives. It had found a unique way to connect them so intricately that Draco didn’t think it was possible to untangle his and Harry’s lives anymore. They were tightly interwoven, and if Draco was perfectly honest, he liked it this way. He more than liked it. He loved it.
Harry grinned.
“I’ve always wanted to ask you this, but I’ve never got around to it. I will now though. Will you tell me who taught you this?”
It was a perfectly reasonable question but coming from Harry, it was Draco’s undoing. He shivered and let out a soft whimper, he had no way of controlling or stopping.
“I love you.”
Feeling highly intoxicated, Draco mumbled Harry’s title, then repeated it as though it was his mantra, his lifeline, his everything.
Harry at once chases Walter off the table and casts a wandless cleaning charm over the surface before sitting down to resume enjoying his coffee and the silence of the early morning. The sun has already risen but is presently half-hidden behind a large fluffy cloud.
Draco cried out, thrashed in his arms, or tried to, and a swell of desperate pleas fell from his lips.
It flew over to him and catching it with ease, he gently fastened it around Draco’s neck, making sure that it fitted perfectly. When he was confident that it was neither too tight nor too loose, he drew the outline of an ancient rune onto Draco’s shoulder and locked the collar into place with a mumbled incantation.
“I love you, Harry. So much.”
Draco shook his head.
Roísín hummed softly, sipped on her wine, then smiled.
Harry’s next words robbed him of all coherency.
“Nobody. I invented it. Every Dominant has their own way of reassuring their submissive and checking in with them, and this is mine. Years ago, back when I could barely tie a decent knot, let alone knew how to properly dominate somebody, Caleb suggested that think of something. A little touch or gesture, or a phrase, something inconspicuous enough to use in a vanilla setting. Took me a while, but I eventually came up with this.”
Molly waved her hand, dismissing his thanks.
To Draco, it felt like Potter was deliberately trying to goad him into doing something stupid, but he refused to take the bait and instead of engaging in a battle of wills, Draco boldly shoved his open-palmed hand in front of Potter’s snout. All or nothing.
“You know me too well.”
A loud round of applause, led by Caleb, who was waiting for him in the centre of the stage, echoed through the room, and breathing deeply to calm his fluttering nerves, Draco confidently approached Caleb. They shook hands, and Caleb patted him on the back of his shoulder before handing him the hand-held microphone. As he did so, he leant in close, and for a brief moment, he pressed his lips to Draco’s ear.
Feeling his knees shake, Draco latched onto the pain and used it to clear some of the haze from his mind. Harry’s arm slithered around his waist and held him tight, then two fingers slipped inside of him, and Harry expertly found his prostate and massaged it.
Draco raised an eyebrow at him and crossed his arms over his chest, looking positively defiant.
He felt the slight tremor that shook through Draco’s core, and drawing back, he brought his other hand up and pressed his palm lightly against Draco’s smooth, pale cheek. Draco tilted his head to the side, leant into the touch and smiled softly. His silvery-grey eyes were warm and open. He wasn’t hiding anything. There was no barrier behind which he concealed a part of him, afraid that it might get hurt. He was an open book, and Harry loved being allowed that exclusive glimpse straight into Draco’s soul.
Ginny, home for the weekend after a long series of Quidditch tournaments, looked thoroughly amused but shrugged. Despite her confidence and cheek, she, too, seemed disinclined to side with him and bore the brunt of her mother’s wrath.
Smirking, Draco pressed his lips together to suppress a snort.
Harry clicked his tongue.
So far, and no matter how far-fetched his idea had been, everything they’d tried had failed. There was not a single spell that could control Potter’s shifts, and no matter how much effort Draco put into tweaking the original Wolfsbane recipe, or how he amended the list of ingredients, it did nothing for Potter. Draco had searched far and wide, read through every book that mentioned either werewolves or animagi or both, even publications written in languages he didn’t speak and for which he required dictionaries and complex translation spells, but nothing.
“As if you two don’t bicker like that, and it’s been what, a little over two years!” she said.
A Werewolf.
“Then punish me for it. I deserve it.”
“Let’s get a decent cup of coffee and some food into you, and you’ll be right as rain again, Director Potter.”
Draco rolled his eyes, but instead of continuing the conversation, he handed Harry his new and as of yet unused whip and walked over to the spot where Liam had stood a few minutes ago. He wasn’t feeling extraordinarily brave and was sure that the whole thing was a colossal mistake, but something inside of him egged him on, and so he took a deep breath and tried to tell his wildly thumping heart to take it easy.
Draco’s cheeks coloured a little in response to the compliment. They always did whenever Harry used his pet name. With it came a certain kind of intimacy that they both found irresistible.
On its own, each crack wasn’t all that impressive, but put together into an arrangement, like the one, Charlie was currently showing off, they looked genuinely magnificent.
“My office and a holding cell,” he said with a wink.
Draco mumbled the words, looking quite abashed.
He remained silent and continued to chew on his apple. It was crisp, juicy, and very delicious.
“In a way, I am saying just that, aren’t I? Let me clarify. There’s mentorship, there’s showing someone the ropes, helping them discover their submissive side and what kinks they might have. You can compare that to you and Draco meeting up for coffee and talking about the lifestyle. Then there’s mentorship between Dominants. You see, no one should just grab up a flogger, a coil of rope, or a pair of nipple clips, and start using them on someone without taking some time to learn how to use those things properly, don’t you think?”
They both laughed, and as they shared their amusement, Harry couldn’t help but take pleasure in the silliness of that particular moment. Compared to what they’d done last night, this was a light-hearted moment between two people who knew each other exceptionally well.
Draco continued to glower at him.
Pressing his thumb against Draco’s pulse point was Harry’s way of silently reminding him that he would always stand by him; that he had his back and that Draco wasn’t alone.
Ever since Harry had waltzed into right back into his life and demanded a place in his heart, his life had definitely changed for the better. Draco chuckled, and as he did, his focus returned to Lily. He took another sip of coffee as he quietly watched her from afar.
He paused about halfway in, let a few seconds pass, then pulled always all the way out, then repeated the deliberately slow thrust several times over. Draco adjusted to the slow pace, pleasuring him with his lips and tongue and thoroughly coating every inch of his cock with deliciously warm wetness. Every now and then he hummed softly, and the vibrations slowly but surely set Harry’s groin on fire.
Draco shook his head.
“Anything for you, Harry,” he whispered.
His whole body felt like it was on fire. He felt Harry’s touch everywhere. All of him felt extremely sensitive, and the smallest touch made him moan into Harry’s hot skin. It tasted salty and perfect and Draco smiled against it.
Draco arched his back, thrust against his hand and writhing on top of the piano, he breathlessly begged for more. Harry silenced him with a deep kiss and continuing to tease him mercilessly, he extended one hand, and summoned a phial of lube, Draco had made himself. It was all-natural, silky smooth, thick, and lasted for hours. Exactly what they needed for all their sexual endeavours.
“How do you feel?”
Draco’s eyes widened, and he stared at the costume for a full five seconds ― the longest she’d ever seen him hold out before reaching for a present. She didn’t blame him for his inability to show any sort of restraint or patience. He was only two, after all. Lucius disagreed, but Narcissa had long since mastered the art of ignoring anything and everything he said. It went in her left ear and out her right ear ― it was the only way of coping with his constant rants about the wizarding world.
“Yep, I’d like to know that too,” he said.
He allowed his shoulders to fall forward and lowering his head slightly, he looked up at Harry from under lowered lashes.
It cost him every ounce of energy not to let his own anxieties get the better of him and imagine the worst.
When the bell announces the end of the class, nobody wants to leave, and they beg and plead until they manage to butter Harry up and he demonstrates a few advanced spells. They watch with bated breath, ask a few questions, and afterwards, Harry shoos them out of the classroom and quite firmly tells them to go and eat lunch. They protest, of course, but this time, Harry remains resolute, and the students grudgingly begin to file out of the classroom.
As Draco looked up, Harry opened his eyes, moaned softly, then leant in and captured Draco’s lips in a slow kiss. He wound his tongue around Draco’s to deepen their kiss and moving his hips, he thrust into Draco’s hand.
Potter laughed.
“You baited me; it was a bloody challenge.”
Less than two minutes later, he returned with Lucius’ camera and handed it to her.
“If I may offer a suggestion?”
Swallowing a sigh, Draco resigned himself to hours and hours of torture, and forcing himself to keep the pace slow and steady, he fucked himself with the cursed dildo. He couldn’t focus on twisting his nipples and pulling on them at the same time, and Harry didn’t reprimand him for it.
“I just had the best sex, I’m amenable.”
Coffee in hand, Harry sits on his tattered sofa and thinks about nothing at all until a very sleepy-looking Rose comes walking in and curls up in his lap. Hugo joins them some twenty minutes later, and together they listen to the wireless, dance a bit, then play board games for the rest of the afternoon. Around five-thirty, Harry sends the children downstairs to help Uncle George clean up while he cooks them dinner.
There are, of course, also those who read that crap and then decide they are a submissive and then go out to explore, knowing nothing. When they really discover that this is something they are into and Frenzy ensues they are in for a rollercoaster ride of hurt, both mentally and physically.
“I told you. It was a prank, nothing more and nothing less, and I can take a joke.”
A shiver surged through him.
Teddy looked at him with a massive pout that actually melted Draco’s heart, but he remained stout. There was really no point in teaching Teddy the incantation. He didn’t have a wand just yet and wouldn’t be able to practise the spell anyway.
“I’ll take that,” he said.
“I’m not naughty,” he whispered, “you started it.”
“Does that crop come with a private playroom?” he asked.
He blinked a few times, and Harry watched, with the utmost delight, how he struggled to focus. He loved those moments, when Draco’s mind betrayed him and caused him to fall apart, just like that, because he didn’t want to resist the feeling of his control and composure slipping right through his fingers.
He’d genuinely needed to hear those words.
Charlie laughed.
“It’s entirely your choice, Potter. If you want something more intimate that doesn’t include a crowd of two-hundred, I most definitely am your man. However, if you’d like to continue to sulk by the bar and pretend that turning thirty-eight is the end of the world, I’m certainly not going to deprive you of the opportunity to get blind drunk. Just don’t ask me to drag your sorry arse home and to bed when you can’t remember how to apparate without running the risk of splinching your crotch.”
“Much better. I do rather dislike naughty pets. They make me want to do all sorts of wicked things to them.”
“No, Draco, no. If you want a spanking you can always ask for one, and if I feel that you’re mentally capable of enjoying yourself, I’ll be more than happy to invite you up to the playroom where we can indulge in a bit of fun; however, I’m not going to dish out punishments that are neither necessary nor appropriate.”
Harry couldn’t wait to find out.
Draco’s knees buckled slightly, and he briefly pressed his lips together, then, took a deep breath and looked up at Harry.
Harry focused and reaching for his drink, he took a small sip, once again grimacing at the amount of sugar it contained. As he placed the glass back down on the bar, Caleb leant a bit closer. He reached out, and Harry felt him squeeze his forearm, lingering for just a moment longer than strictly necessary. The firmness of his touch conveyed all the things Caleb didn’t say;
“Solid deal or not, this partnership could use a bit of sugar and spice.”
Draco nodded.
Draco sniffed, then frowned at his crude reaction to Harry’s words.
They kissed for the longest time, and until they were both thoroughly breathless. His burning lungs were the only reason why Harry eventually broke away and awed by the intensity and ferocity of their heated battle of tongues, Harry took several moments to regulate his breathing and even longer to find the will to speak.
It lingered on the cover of the book he’d been reading.
“Prosecutor Malfoy, I’ve got a package for you,” the boy said.
Draco clamped his mouth shut.
“Yes, of course, darling,” she said with a smile.
“Yes, Sir,” he whispered.
Harry whispered the words right into his ear, and Draco’s knees buckled at once. They shook and trembled, and Draco really wasn’t sure how much longer they would support him. He sucked in a large amount of air, held on to it for several seconds, then slowly exhaled.
For weeks, Draco had let him get away with it, but eventually, and when Harry had repeatedly refused to cooperate and take a couple of weeks off, he’d gone straight over Harry’s head and spoken to Shacklebolt. Being the no-nonsense kind of person that Kingsley Shacklebolt was, he’d, with immediate effect, put Harry on mandatory leave.
“Now, now, you two, stop praising me, you’ll make me blush if you keep at it.”
Harry wasn’t going to give in.
“Come on, Tom, you’re boring me now. Nothing you’ve shown me so far is at all impressive. There’s no way you’re the real deal. The Dark Lord had more style than you’ll ever have, all you are is a pathetic
Not much, just enough to get Draco’s attention.
The moment, he’d adjusted it to ensure that it was neither too tight nor too loose, he could feel the clasp disappear, leaving behind a smooth, seamless leather band. Draco ran his fingers over the place where the buckle had been and smiled.
The outfit, along with Harry’s scarlet robes, also reminded Draco of one epic scene; Harry had meticulously planned for them both, and the thought of it, and Harry dressed in his uniform and robes, was enough to make Draco’s knees go weak. He hastily redirected his mind, focusing on a less serious subject, one that didn’t have the potential to make him fall apart in a secluded corner of Notting Hill. His eyes fell onto Harry’s suit jacket, and he smiled softly. The fitted garment was decidedly more comfortable than Harry’s uniform jacket, and it was precisely the right shape and size for Harry’s frame.
“Sure, anything to satisfy your sweet tooth,” he said.
Draco was about to stick out his bottom lip and pout, but before he could do just that, Harry placed his hand on the back of his neck and pulled him into a fierce kiss. Unable to resist the feel of Harry’s lips, Draco surrendered, and despite still holding on to the oversized bouquet of roses, he managed to move a bit closer to Harry, who wrapped his other arm around him and hugged him tightly.
Amid all the chatter and laughter that reverberated around the marquee, filling the evening with happiness and love, the light and the clear chink of champagne flutes could be heard. It was a strange sort of combination, yet each sound complimented the other perfectly. Harry glanced around large and sumptuous tent; he’d helped erect earlier this morning and smiled softly.
“Then come for me, my precious little prince, come.”
Draco, who stood by the window sill, back ramrod straight yet seemingly entirely at ease and not in the least bit tense, turned his attention away from looking through the window glass at the enchanted landscape outside and staring straight at him, he arched an eyebrow. It said far more than words ever could and deep down, Harry appreciated that Draco’s ability to speak without ever saying a word. Out in the field, it served them well, but even in the privacy of his office, it was one of the qualities of his and Draco’s long-standing partnership which he genuinely appreciated.
Charlie patted his hair softly.
Charlie ended the phone call, put his phone away again, and turning a corner, he walked up to Harry’s house.
Harry bit his earlobe and tugged on it with his teeth.
He kept the pace slow, and unhurriedly but repeatedly claimed Draco for himself.
“You’re such a sucker for love,” he teased.
Turning his head away, Harry smirked, then resolutely bit the inside of his mouth to stop himself from laughing at the irony of Caleb’s statement.
“I’m afraid it will do so for a while, my little prince.”
“What is it?”
Bottled the very year, he’d been born, and his and his parents’ destiny had been sealed.
“Sweet boy.”
He felt Harry replace his thumb with his lips and the kiss that followed was soft, tender, and full of promise.
“Does that mean that you’re planning to fight me every step of the way?”
Oh right. That.
“Yeah. Me and Ron have got a compartment down here.”
Him and Malfoy had come to a silent agreement in the few weeks that they had been back at Hogwarts, that Malfoy would stay in their room and Harry would go elsewhere until curfew at 10pm. Ron and Hermione were getting on well with their roommates. Hermione was sharing a room with Hannah Abbot and Ron with Terry Boot. They had both been in Dumbledore’s Army so they were kind of friends already. Harry was jealous. He wanted a roommate he could talk to. Malfoy still hadn’t said a word to him, which Harry found infuriating. He’d rather get a rude response than nothing at all. He’d ask him simple questions like ‘Have you seen my charm’s textbook?’ and all he’d get in response was a shrug or a gesture towards the book where it would be hidden under a pile of clothes. He was certain this was Malfoy’s way of pissing him off without getting himself in trouble. He couldn’t exactly complain to McGonagall about how Malfoy wasn’t insulting him enough.
This is my first attempt at writing a Drarry fic so please let me know what you think! I have already written most of this story already and I just need to edit everything so I will hopefully be updating every week.
"It is a big deal." Draco couldn't believe Harry seemed so unbothered by this. Who makes a child sleep in a cupboard? He wasn't sure what else to say. He thought Harry had had a perfect life. He could tell by Harry's reluctance talk about it that there was more he wasn't telling him. He hadn't even meant to tell him this much.He felt suddenly angry towards Harry's family for treating him so badly. But that felt hypocritical. Hadn't he treated Harry just as badly? Draco felt a wave of guilt and frowned down at the grass.
When he did wake up in the middle of the night, breathing heavily with sweat dripping off his forehead and soaking into his pillow, it was impossible to get back to sleep. His late night walks had become a regular thing, every time he’d slip out the door, hoping not to be overheard and would return just before he usually woke up. He had hoped no one had noticed, especially Malfoy.
"No, we aren't, I'm trying to sleep."
“I do not have a crush on him.” He felt childish saying it, Pansy had a way of backing him into a corner and forcing him to tell her the truth. He knew he couldn’t convince them but he could try. He gestured to Potter, “I mean look at him, he’s so… fucking annoying.” It was the best he could come up with. He was ashamed of his lack of creative insult but his heart wasn’t in it. And Potter was annoying anyway. He was the bane of Draco’s existence, with his stupid concerned looks and pretty eyes. Fuck him.
“You need to learn to let things go.” “We were stupid teenagers. What if he really does want to be better?”
Just like always at the mention of eating in the great hall, Draco seemed reluctant. Harry understood. He had tried to convince his friends to come with him to eat in the kitchens. The house elves had been very welcoming when he visited them a week into term, telling him they would cook anything for the saviour of the Wizarding World. He wasn’t one to abuse his power as the ‘Chosen One’ but when it came to food, he might have to make an exception. Besides, they seemed more than happy to set aside a meal for him. But when he had proposed this idea to his friends, they had called him antisocial and told him he should try to enjoy Hogwarts as a normal student for once. Ron had been more reluctant at the mention of extra food but in the end, he had sided with Hermione.
“I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to scare you,” Harry said, taking a step back from his bed. He had his wand in hand, lit so Draco could see him clearly in the darkness.
"Not like... a kitchen cupboard, it was a cupboard under the stairs," Harry clarified, as if Draco would now understand and not be completely disgusted.
House-elves were rushing around, setting up the four large tables in the centre of the room. The overwhelming smell of sausage, bacon, egg, toast and more filled his nose as he stepped into the room. It made his stomach rumble with hunger.
He’d sat out in this spot a few times and found that no one liked to get close to the forest. Everyone else would sit scattered around the grass field in groups, as if they were afraid of what might be in the forest. Draco had been in there enough times to no longer be afraid.
"Really?" An image of eleven year old Harry in his oversized clothes and cute little smile popped into his head. He didn't know how anyone could not want to be friends with him.
“Yeah, can you believe it? We have to spend another year with him.” Harry wasn’t sure how he felt about Malfoy anymore. He was still a pompous git as far as Harry knew, but he’d defended him at his trial for a reason. He believed the other boy felt guilty about what he had been a part of and wanted to be better. But that didn’t mean Harry would be happy to see him again.
Draco was looking at his hair as if it had personally offended him. “And your hair is even more of a disaster than usual. Do you own a comb?” Malfoy lifted a hand and for a strange moment Harry thought he might be reaching up to smooth his hair down. Seeming to realise what he was doing, he aborted the gesture half way and put his hand back in his lap. Harry pretended not to notice.
"Well, there's plenty of brooms in here and I have a spare set of robes... if you want to use them," he reached into his locker and pulled out a bundle of red and gold and held it out to him. "Or you could play in those fancy pyjamas you're wearing, but they don't look very wind proof."
“I’ve told you; I’m not sitting with your stupid Gryffindor friends. I have my own.” Draco said. He had in fact told Harry this when he had brought up the fact that he looked miserable every time he ate dinner. He resented that comment even if it was in fact true and also implied that Harry had been watching him.
Harry hummed around a mouth full of food in acknowledgement. He dropped the subject and they ate in a comfortable silence for a while. Draco was enjoying being able to eat without feeling like people were glaring at him. He could get used to this. He wished they could do this every day but he knew Harry would rather be with Hermione and Ron, there was really no point in suggesting it.
“Doing what?” he tried, playing dumb. Draco rolled his eyes.
Since his attempts at annoying Malfoy until he talked to him were not working out how he had planned- and he honestly didn’t feel like it anymore- he decided to rethink. It wasn’t fun fighting with Malfoy now that he didn’t even react. He had thought about it while staring up at the canopy of his bed and had decided the only option he had left was to just be nice to him. At least that way he would have the satisfaction of confusing the hell out of him.
He reached for the tissue Draco had set aside in case of any mistakes and balled it up in one hand. Draco’s eyes widened slightly and he tensed as Harry leaned forward and reached up to gently hold his face still. His skin was warm and soft beneath Harry’s fingertips and as he accidentally brushed past Draco’s bottom lip, something stirred in the pit of his stomach that he forcibly pushed down. Draco’s unreadable eyes searched his face as he lifted the tissue and pressed it to his nose. Harry felt overly aware of how close they were in a way he hadn’t been before. The paint hadn’t had time to dry so it came away easily and Harry smiled and gave Draco’s cheek a pat, leaning back and averting his eyes a little too fast to be natural. “All gone.”
And then he had refused to shake his hand, and all his childish expectations were crushed. Granted, he had just made fun of Harry’s new friend, which was probably not the best way to go about getting on his good side. It’s not his fault his father had taught him to dislike the Weasley’s. He can’t say that Weasley had done anything to change his mind anyway.
"Don't push it," Draco scolded.
Draco’s eyes quickly darted back up before Harry could realise he had been watching him. Oblivious, Harry slid back on his arm and lifted his legs onto the bed, until he was settled on his side on top of the covers, facing Draco. He put an arm under his head, the other resting on the sheets between them. Draco could feel his gaze on the side of his face but refused to look. Of all the times he’d imagined Harry in his bed, never had be pictured himself unable to look at the other boy. In fact, it was usually quite the opposite.
"That's not what it's for," Potter said defensively, snatching it back.
He felt that same longing as he looked at him then. He was laughing at something Weasley had said, his smile lighting up his face and the room around him. With a lump in his throat, Draco turned back to his cauldron. The frown didn’t leave his face for the rest of the lesson.
Harry’s attention was pulled from Draco’s arms to his face as he tilted it to see better. He had never really looked at Draco properly before. He was actually quite attractive, Harry thought. Pretty even. It felt somehow fitting that Draco had perfect bone structure, everything about him had an air of superiority. His cheekbones and jaw line were sharp enough to cut and his hair, even now when free of jell, was that kind of effortlessly neat that Harry could never hope to achieve.  His nose was perfectly upturned, in contrast to Harry’s broken one (courtesy of Draco himself), making his features look delicate. And of course, his lips were a lovely shade of pink, plump and curved into a permanent frown, the only contradiction to his air of elegance.
“Not anymore,” his voice was calm and confident but it felt like a feeble answer, he knew this boy wouldn't care how sorry Malfoy was now. No matter how much he regretted his actions, he still did them. But Harry knew a thing or two about regret and he wasn't going to let him hurt Malfoy. The boy continued to push him against the wall, glaring and almost choking him. Malfoy winced and Harry took another step closer.
So, to avoid talking to people he waited till the halls weren’t too crowded, put on his invisibility cloak and snuck around till he found a quiet corner to hide in. Thankfully he still had the Marauders Map to help him find any secret passageways where he wouldn’t be disturbed.
“Harry and Draco are quite close friends now, didn’t you know?” Luna said in her airy voice. Harry looked at her in surprise.
Draco gave him a look that said 'if you say so'.
(See the end of the chapter for
. “…this is an especially useful skill in battle. Today, however, we will not be using any dangerous spells as we do not want any of you paying a visit to Madam Pomfrey in the Hospital Wing,” she said with a friendly smile. Despite her strictness, Harry liked her, she was like a younger version of McGonagall. “Now, partner up and start practicing.” The room was filled with noise as everyone started talking and moved to be close to their friends.
Draco said nothing. He couldn't help the insults, it was almost ingrained into him at this point.
He sat, unmoving for at least a minuet with no idea what to do. He couldn’t shove him off, he’d probably wake up. But if he left him and he woke up on his own and found that Draco hadn’t pushed him away, it would be even more awkward.
“Ok…” he said anyway as they moved to stand across from each other. He did the same, standing a few feet in front of Malfoy, facing him. “You try first.”
"Just get under the cloak," he insisted as he lifted one side of the cloak, gesturing for Draco to stand next to him.
Draco had heard him get up the night before and leave their room. He wondered where he was going. It was oddly nice to know he wasn’t the only one who couldn’t sleep, which he knew was a selfish way to think. Despite him having less nightmares now he was back at Hogwarts, he still had them occasionally. He had woken up shouting out and clutching his pillow in such a tight fist he was worried he had torn the material. Luckily he knew he was prone to waking up like this and would routinely cast silencing charms around his bed every night. He had started doing it when, while still at the manor, he had woken his mother and frightened her half to death with his screams.
“Give those back! I can’t see!” Harry said trying to snatch them back.
“Or maybe yours are too high.”
Harry started leading them back towards the doors but before they could reach them, an owl suddenly flew out from the big fireplace taking up half of one wall, a letter clutch in its beak. Draco automatically held out his elbow for the owl to land and took the offered letter. The owl belonged to his family so it wasn’t a surprise when he turned it over and saw the curling letters of his mother’s hand writing.
He did finish, albeit slowly. At one point Harry had shifted and nuzzled further into the crook of his neck, sighing in contentment. And Draco felt like he might explode. What exactly had happened to lead to Harry Potter, someone who had almost killed him once, being comfortable enough to fall asleep on his shoulder?
“Oh, come on. It’s not that bad.” Harry grabbed Draco’s arm and yanked him up. “You have to eat something.”
Potter pointed at the miniature eighth year dorm rooms where he could see each of his classmates labelled and sleeping in their beds. Just under Potter's finger were two footprints, one standing just behind the other, labelled 'Harry Potter' and 'Draco Malfoy'. Draco said nothing for a second. It was an extremely impressive piece of magic, but he didn't want to admit that to Potter. Instead, he did what he always did, tried to irritate Potter as much as possible. "Is this what you used to stalk me in 6th year?"
Pepper padded along at his feet as he rushed through the station, finally arriving at the archway between platforms 9 and 10 just 3 minutes before departure. He swiped Pepper up and placed her on top of his trunk so he could run head first through the wall, emerging on the other side to a platform full of parents. There were almost no students still on the platform, most of them already seated on the train.
But now he had someone to talk to, even if the conversations were very one sided, if you didn’t count the meows he sometimes got in response. She reminded him a lot of Dobby. Maybe it was her eyes or maybe it was the way she had inserted herself into Harry's life without his permission.
With his thoughts drowning out the noise of his friends, he watched as Malfoy disappeared behind the first set of bookshelves without looking up from the ground to check for free tables. At the front of the library there was a cluster of tables and chairs for students to study but there were also places to sit in between each aisle of shelves, so Harry assumed that was where he was going.
Harry was searching in the grass for his glasses.
Draco paused. "But everyone loves you."
“Next we could try eyeliner.”
He had been jealous of her and Weasley ever since they befriended Potter in first year. At one point he had hated her more than anyone else. In fourth year, when everyone thought her and Potter were together. Of course, it was stupid of him to believe any of those articles in The Profit. It was clear to anyone with eyes that Weasley was in love with Granger and that she felt the same, no matter how much she would have denied it.
He looked between Harry and Malfoy with until he took a stepped back in defeat. He clearly didn’t want to argue with Harry of all people about the redeemability of death eaters. He stormed off past Harry and towards the entrance hall. Malfoy had gasped in a breath as soon as he was released from the boys hold and was now raising a hand to his throat. Harry took a step forward to make sure he was alright but Malfoy recoiled and he stopped short. Malfoy avoided his eyes as he straitened his robes and started in the same direction as the Hufflepuff. He hadn’t exactly expected a thank you but a little gratitude would be nice. Just a nod of appreciation would be enough.
"What did you wish for?"
Draco got to the common room at the same time Pansy and Blaise were coming out of it. He rubbed furiously at his eyes, probably making the redness worse. It was bad enough that Potter had seen him so upset, he didn’t want his friends fussing over him.
It was only then that he realised Harry had been sleeping on top of the covers all night.
“Fuck off.” Not his best comeback, admittedly, but it was the best he could do under the circumstances.
Then he had started accusing him of things. Saying that it was his fault that his sister had died fighting Voldemort. He didn’t know who his sister was but he definitely knew he hadn’t killed her. He’d never killed anyone.
Malfoy was still frowning but he seemed to have decided pretending Harry wasn’t there was the best way to deal with him. Harry searched for something to say, he would get Malfoy to talk to him, whether he liked it or not.
He looked around. It was a nice spot. They were sitting under a willow tree and the branches of the tree hung down around them like yellow and green curtains, partially obscuring them form view. The sky was red and made the already autumnal landscape glow even more orange.
Harry gave him a sad smile. He didn’t say anything more and Draco didn’t want him to. To know he wasn’t alone, that he was safe, was enough. Harry made him feel safe.
Harry walked through the doors and to the Gryffindor table while Draco went in the opposite direction to meet his friends at the Slytherin one. Draco tried to keep his attention on them and not the other side of the hall. He really did.
Draco retracted his hand that had wandered across the bedsheets towards Harry’s in his sleep, just the tip of his little finger touching the soft skin of Harry’s hand.
“That can’t be right,” Ron joked. “I doubt Malfoy’s sense of humour extends past laughing at other people’s misfortune.”
“Oh, come on. I’m not that bad.” Malfoy’s eyebrows quirked up. “Admit it. You enjoy my company.”
Harry stretched his arms over his head, groaning. “Why? Did you want to cuddle?”
“Where to?”
Draco heard him push his covers back and get out of bed. "Get up."
“What? What’s the matter?” Harry asked her, even though he knew he wouldn’t get a reply. Pepper jumped off the bed and ran across the room until she was standing beside Harry’s trunk. The trunk that he had spent the past week packing full of everything he’d need for his eighth year at Hogwarts.
“We’re your partners,” he argued sounding slightly offended.
He came to a stop a few feet away from Malfoy, who must have noticed him approach but didn’t look up.
“Stop staring at Potter,” Pansy said in frustration. She had been talking at him and Blaise for the last hour, while they listened and drank their butterbeer. He had got distracted about ten minutes ago, when she had started talking about a girl from Durmstrang she had met during the summer. Usually Draco enjoyed talking to Pansy about girls but at that moment Potter and his friends had walked into the Hog’s Head. They’d pushed their way through the crowd and sat at a table with the other Gryffindors. Draco could see Potter through a gap in the crowd.
He wished they could see how much Draco had hated it. How he never really wanted to hurt anyone, but was unlucky enough to be a convenient tool for Voldemort to use. What was he supposed to do? Say no to one of the most powerful wizards ever born? Draco never talked about what it had been like to be trapped in a house with Voldemort for all those months, or what had actually happened, but it wasn’t hard for Harry to guess. He had thought about it a lot lately, what he would have done in Draco’s position. If anything, it was a miracle he had survived at all. Harry was glad he had.
“What do you want?” Draco interrupted, slightly annoyed at the other boy’s inability to take a hint.
Draco’s feelings towards Potter were never that straightforward. Back in their first year, he had been so excited to meet him, this powerful wizard who had defeated the Dark Lord as a baby. Draco had thought he was amazing. He sometimes thought back to when he first met Potter in Madam Malkin's, when neither of them had known who the other was. They had been friendly. It was probably the only conversation they’d had where they hadn’t insulted each other. He sometimes wondered if Potter remembered too.
in bed together (not that they did much snuggling, unfortunately). He may as well rip his heart out now and be done with it. It’s not that he would have preferred to wake up to Harry gone, that would have left him hurt and worried he’d ruined everything. But this was encouraging the feelings he had worked so hard to stamp down for years.
"Did you see that?" Harry said pointing towards the white trail of a star shooting across the sky.
Pepper meowed and pawed at Draco’s fist. He gave in, running a hand over her black fur.
“What about all the other years? Was that just for fun?” Ron was joking but Harry felt like he was accusing him of something.
“Yeah, but he keeps sneaking off and he’s so distracted all the time,” Ron insisted. “And he’s nearly fallen asleep in class at least three times this week.”
Draco had his feet up with his knees to his chest while Harry’s legs were sprawled half on, half off the seat, with one knee bent up and the other hanging off the edge. Malfoy was leaning over his bent legs, the pot of nail varnish in one hand and the brush in the other. Pepper was curled up on the seat between them looking very comfortable. Had Hermione not known that Harry and Malfoy had formed some weird friendship over the last few months she would have been surprised. Pepper generally only liked whoever Harry liked and tried to scratch anyone else, but she seemed perfectly happy with her head against Malfoy’s ankle. They looked cosy. Like it was something they did all the time without a thought, sitting together so close and comfortable.
He turned to see Malfoy clench his jaw, clearly offended. Once again rolling his eyes, Malfoy picked up his trunk and started up the stairs that lead to their new room. Harry was expecting a snide comment but Malfoy remained silent.
“Of course, it is. Why wouldn’t it?”
He got up and held a hand out to Draco. With a resigned sigh, forcing himself to let the subject go, he reached up, took his hand and let Harry pull him to his feet.
She wished the papers would stop writing about him. Luckily Harry refused to read anything but the Quibbler, which Luna gave to him for free. That didn’t stop him from catching glimpses of articles about how he was coping after the war and who he was dating and how he was doing at school. Most of it wasn’t even true. The other week they’d once again decided that she and Harry were secretly in love. Ron had just laughed at that one. She was glad he didn’t take it seriously, his trust meant a lot to her, especially when she knew it didn’t come easily to him.
Harry held his hands up as if in surrender. “It doesn’t. I was just asking.”
“There you are! We are waiting for you,” Pansy said when she saw him. As he got closer, she frowned and asked, “Are you ok?”
But he wasn’t self destructive enough to let himself.
Draco was awoken from his sleep for the first time in his new room by a sliver of sunlight peeking through a gap in his bed curtains. He was surprised by the lack of nightmares that usually plagued his sleep. He’d expected them to get worse now that he was back at Hogwarts, that being there would bring back memories of the war. He even put up some silencing spells around his bed so his shouts couldn’t be heard. He didn’t want Potter hearing him. But they weren’t needed as his dreams were suspiciously pleasant. Blurry images of messy black hair and smudges of green faded from his memory as he woke up fully, until he couldn’t recall them at all.
“I needed a partner.”
Hi. Sorry I stopped updating for like a month or two. I just really didn't feel like it but I’m back and very motivated to finish this. Hopefully I will be back to weekly updates and if not then at least fortnightly. (I also have a new job so I don’t have as much time to write but we’ll see)
"But I still won!" Potter grinned at him, holding the snitch in one hand and his broom with the other. And Draco couldn't look away. He'd never seen Potter so in his element, his eyes watery from the wind and his cheeks tinted pink. He looked like a madman with his hair pointing in all directions and a manic smile on his face. He noticed Draco looking at his hair with amusement and ran a hand through it, fixing nothing. "Best of three?" he asked, out of breath.
Now, Harry knew him well enough to know something was bothering him. As soon as Hermione had come in, he’d tensed up and drew back into himself. It was almost as if he was embarrassed. Harry hoped Draco wasn’t embarrassed to be his friend.
His long blond eyelashes obscured clear grey eyes that changed colour in different lighting. Eyes that met Harry’s as Draco glanced up for a second then did a double take, looking startled. “What? Have I got something on my face?” He reached up to touch his cheek, forgetting about the brush he was still holding and smearing a line of green onto the bridge of his nose.
At one point Granger slapped Weasley’s hand away before he could put the wrong ingredient in their cauldron. Draco let out a silent laugh at that. He had always begrudgingly thought him and Granger would probably get on quite well, had he not been such an asshole. Of course, that would never have happened. She was a Muggle-born, and he had been taught his whole life that Muggle-born’s were bad, something to be despised. It took him longer than it should to realise how wrong that was. But he got there in the end.
Ron groaned at Harry’s unhelpfulness. “As my best mate, you’re supposed to support my arguments.”
Sorry I haven't posted in so long but I've been really busy. I finally got all my assignments done so now I have time to write again!
"We're going for a walk."
“Harry agrees with me! Don’t you Harry?” At the sound of Ron saying his name, Harry whipped his head around from where he had been stating at the bookshelf Malfoy had just disappeared behind.
“Is it alright if we sit down here for breakfast? We won’t get in your way I promise.”
Harry sputtered for a second, feeling weirdly uncomfortable talking to Ginny about Draco. He still didn’t know where he stood with her. Though their break up had been mutual he worried it was because he was a bad boyfriend. Sometimes he wondered if she held a grudge against him for not being better. She seemed fine, but then Harry had never been very good at reading people.
Draco reached for his wand from his bedside table, casting a
Harry paused, looking from his hands to Draco. Why not?
“You could have used the covers you know,” he muttered, picking his uniform up from where it was folded on his chair.
“We aren’t.”
“Come on, Flitwick will kill us if we’re late to her class again.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“So are you going to tell us why you’ve suddenly decided to ditch us for Malfoy in all our classes?” Hermione asked later that day in the common room. She was sitting with her back against a sofa that Ron was spread out over. Pepper was curled up in her lap while Ron played with her hair, attempting, and failing, to plait it. Harry was sitting in a worn puffy armchair across from them, trying to ignore the small pang of jealousy he felt at their closeness.
He distracted himself with his book and it worked for a while, he was getting to a good bit.
“My mistake,” Harry laughed. They lapsed into a comfortable silence as Harry got dressed and Draco tidied his side of the room, straightening his sheets and folding his pyjamas. Harry had barely pulled his jumper over his head by the time Draco was reaching for the door handle and pulling it open. Harry rushed to follow, straightening his tie with one hand and tucking in his shirt with the other.
Being alone with his thoughts was never a good idea for Harry. It led to him overthinking or coming up with terrible plans that he would regret later. Which was exactly what he did. As he sat in the damp grass staring up at the stars, his thoughts drifted, as was a common occurrence these days, to Malfoy. (If he told Ron about how much time he spent thinking about Malfoy, he would probably take him to St Mungo’s, and tell them he was worried about Harry’s sanity.) He thought about the suspicious glances he gave Harry every time he tried to talk to him. It was obvious he didn’t trust him, and if Harry was going to be his friend, he needed his trust.
Ginny reached out a hand and pried Harry’s free and unfurled his fingers. “Who did those? Because it definitely wasn’t you, they’re too neat,” Ginny said, admiring his fingers.
Honestly, he had come out here to get away from Harry. He needed some time to think. To work out why this was happening to him and how-or whether-he should stop it. He couldn’t go to the library since Harry had already discovered his spot and decided it was now his too, the selfish prick. So he’d decided to sit outside, forgetting that the Gryffindor quidditch team had practice. He didn’t keep up with the games anymore, it just made him sad that he couldn’t join in.
“He said Malfoy did them,” Hermione supplied helpfully. Harry glared at her.
"Yes Potter, that is how you play quidditch," he deadpanned. Before Potter could reply, he climbed onto his broom and took off after the snitch.
"I didn't bring my quidditch robes," he said when Potter shrugged off the cloak and opened the door to the broom shed and changing rooms. "Or broom."
“You were having a nightmare... I- you were talking in your sleep,” Harry said. He looked as panicked as Draco felt, like he was expecting Draco to start shouting at him any second and wasn’t really sure what to do about it. When Draco said nothing and continued to maintain his glare, though his heart wasn’t in it, Harry averted his eyes and awkwardly pointed his thumb over his shoulder and said, “Um… I’ll just...”
As usual Draco finished before everyone else, not even Granger was better than him at potions. Though whether that was because she had to supervise Potter and Weasley or because Draco was actually better, he wasn’t sure.
Harry used to find it impossible to tell what Draco was thinking, his perfect poker face never giving anything away. It was like he constantly had a guard up, as if he was trying to hide what he felt. It was frustrating, but it also made it all the more rewarding when Harry caught a glimpse of emotion. He had started trying to make him laugh at every opportunity, just to see his eyes light up. It was the only time he was completely open.
"That doesn't make it any better," he said, all humour disappearing when he realised Harry was being serious. He had lifted himself onto his elbows and was looking down at Harry sideways now.
“I’ve been playing quidditch,” he defended half-heartedly, with a shrug.
“What?”
He circled the pitch and within minutes he spotted a flash of gold as the moonlight reflected off the snitch. He changed direction, almost colliding with Potter who was right behind him.
“Uh…” She rolled her eyes at him and shared an exasperated look with Ron.
He pulled out the stall next to Malfoy and sat down. He could feel Malfoy’s eyes on him as he took out his books and placed them on the desk. As he expected, when he looked up, Malfoy was staring at him as if he had gone mad.
Malfoy’s reaction to what he’d told him about his childhood surprised him. Hermione and Ron had had similar reactions but he didn’t expect Malfoy to care. He almost thought he’d make fun of him for it. But, as Harry had to keep reminding himself, Malfoy was trying to be better.
He honestly wouldn’t want to share a room with anyone else. Maybe not even Ron. With Draco, there were no expectations. He didn’t have to be ‘the boy who lived’, some hero he didn’t feel like he was, because Draco didn’t treat him that way. He treated him the way he always had, albeit a little nicer, and Harry appreciated that. He needed people who didn’t take his shit and that understood what he’d been through. The expectation and pressure he’d been under from such a young age. There were very few people who understood, but Draco was definitely one of them.
“Nope.”
Next, he unbuttoned his crisp white shirt, took that off too, and after folding it, he put it on top of the chair. While undoing his belt and trousers, he walked across the room to fetch his robes, then took off his shoes, and effortlessly slipped his trousers down his legs. He folded them, placed them on the chair, and taking his black socks off, he put those on the chair too.
“All in good time, my little prince, all in good time.”
Harry murmured the praise against the side of his neck and kissed him.
He’d been Charlie’s slave for many years, at first on and off, then they’d gradually finalised things. All that had happened years before Draco had even heard the acronym BDSM.
Draco hummed in response but didn’t speak.
“I know.”
Every now and then, Draco hummed murmured something entirely incomprehensible, and each time he did, Harry stopped to caress his cheek, kiss his forehead or shower him with sweet words of praise. In response to his physical and verbal affection, the corners of Draco’s mouth curled upward, and he smiled goofily. It was a rather infectious smile and sooner rather than later, Harry found himself mirroring it and humming some random pop tune, he’d heard on the radio the other day, he finished cleaning Draco up.
, yes, Sir.”
“What are my options?”
Harry smiles, pets him some more, and wandlessly summoning the bag of crup treats from the top shelf, he offers one to Walter. Pleased that he’s managed to wrap Walter around his little finger and worm his way back into his crup’s good book, Harry straightens up, finishes his breakfast and settles at the table to enjoy his coffee.
Narcissa smiled, and with a curt nod, she headed over to her minibar on the far side of her parlour.
He suppressed the urge to chuckle.
“I’ll take it.”
Distracted, Charlie watched his partner but shook his head again.
A smile tugged at the corners of his mouth, and the thought became a feeling that enveloped him completely. He felt safe and secure and gradually slipped further and further into his submission until there was only one word left in his mind.
“Of course, you don’t.”
Draco made a delectable little sound and moving his head slightly, Harry found the side of Draco’s neck. He pressed his lips against the smooth and sensitive skin, then kissed Draco gently. Harry felt Draco hum into his shoulder, and parting his lips even further, he slowly sucked some of the firm and fair skin into his mouth. In response, Draco hummed a little louder. His legs continued to shake.
“Read the headline.”
“Yes,” Harry said with a careful nod.
He picked up a fork, and sitting forward, he sampled his lasagna while Draco placed a steaming cup of hot, black coffee beside his dessert.
Harry gave Draco a positively devilish smile.
“Go upstairs, my little prince. Wash your hands, then splash your face with a bit of warm water and dry it. If you need the loo, do that too, then wait for me by the left side of the bed with your back to the window. I’ll leave the position up to you, but I trust you know which one I’d prefer. Remember, the choice is yours entirely, and I will appreciate whichever position you’re most comfortable in. Should adjustments be necessary we can always make those later.”
“I was just asking. Even if I could, I’ve no intention of telling anyone.”
Draco blocked it with a bored flick, then raised an eyebrow at him.
Harry’s body was on fire, his cock burnt from the lack of attention, and his groin felt full and was desperate for release. Sparks spread from it into the rest of his body, igniting every fibre of it. He moaned into Draco’s shoulder and shuddered with the sheer effort it took him to draw things out at least a little bit.
Instead of relying on his eyesight, Harry shifted his focus to his other senses, particularly his ability to feel and his sense of smell. He quite distinctly felt the slight tremor that surged through Draco, one that hinted at the existence of steadily building excitement, and Harry positively delighted in it. It was the same kind of tremor that he’d felt when he’d first reached out to touch the back of Draco’s hand. He inhaled deeply, closing his eyes as he drew air through his nose and into every corner of his lungs. Draco’s scent filled his nostrils, and Harry smelt everything.
Draco blinked, and his cheeks pinked a little.
Stefan laughed.
Draco inclined his head and shuffled his feet in a manner that practically screamed anxious bag of nerves to Harry, but he refrained from pointing that out.
The chair moved, its four legs scraping against the stone floor.
“Come on, we’ll have a snack together, I’ll join you in the kitchen.”
“I’m sorry, Sir, I’m so sorry, I’m sorry, I’m so―”
Harry chuckled softly.
“I guess we’re going mattress shopping,” he said instead.
Instead, he unzipped his distressed light-blue jeans, and pulling his own achingly hard cock out, he coated it with plenty of lube, then teased Draco’s hole with the very tip.
The second the question had made it past his lips, Harry regretted asking, mainly because the look on Ron’s face told him that his best friend was prepared to give him a whole list of reasons that proved Harry’s interest in his partner wasn’t platonic in nature.
“He’s got a funny way of showing it.”
The moment Draco turned his head, his breath caught in his throat and any rational thought, he’d ever had, fled from his brain. His mouth fell open, and it didn’t matter how hard he tried; he couldn’t stop himself from staring.
Draco frowned.
“I am, though,” Draco insisted.
“And I have. Your mother has assured me that she will not be writing to the
Draco sighed.
, Harry thought,
“Did you have a favourite story?”
Caleb gave him a lopsided grin and mouthed two words that set Harry’s heart on fire:
Following his declaration, Harry brought the cane up again and casually continued to inspect it.
When it came to Molly, his preference for dominance didn’t matter. The fact that he had killed Voldemort and ended a war mattered even less.
He couldn’t help but wonder whether Kingsley ever struggled to allow those stiff words of praise pass his lips, but then he remembered that Kingsley had played the game for well over twenty years, first as an Auror in unpredictable times and then as Minister for Magic.
Harry raised his eyebrow.
A second after that, Harry found himself back in a horizontal position with Draco towering above him, looking delectable and utterly handsome.
“I love you too, Draco.”
Charlie’s whip teased around his knees, his thighs, his hips, his waist, his chest and eventually, after a bit of advice from Liam on how to position his arms, his wrists. The touch immediately reminded Draco of all those times when Harry pressed his thumb against his pulse point and circled over it to calm him, and he inhaled sharply. He was vaguely aware of the fact that Harry was moving closer to him and then felt two strong arms sneak around his waist. Closing his eyes, Draco simply melted into the embrace, buried his face against Harry’s neck and sighed. Harry hugged him tightly and ran the flat of his hand gently up and down along his spine. Draco felt the familiar tug of apparition in the pit of his stomach, and the world around him descended into a spinning blur.
“Seriously, Mrs Weasley, I’ve said it like a million times tonight, and this is all you care about?”
They continued kissing until they were both desperate for air and Draco’s cheeks were flushed for an entirely different reason altogether.
Potter grinned.
Draco felt his lips curl into a proper grin, the kind he couldn’t have prevented, not even with the help of magic.
He motioned for Draco to ready himself, and as Draco shrugged out of his rope and placed it safely inside Harry’s rigger’s bag, Harry took another look at his ropes and checked that the scissors were in their place. He discovered a bottle of water and a stack of three soft towels beside his back, and looking up, he nodded at Caleb, thanking him for his foresight. Caleb waved it off, and refocusing, Harry turned to look at Draco, now dressed in nothing more but a pair of stunningly black boxer shorts, a stark contrast against his pale skin. The waistband covered the thin scar that ran across Draco’s lower abdomen, but as always, Harry’s gaze was drawn to it. He lingered for a moment, then snapped out of it, and looking directly at Draco, he smiled.
Harry swallowed hard.
“Oh? Anything making you unhappy, my love?”
“Rennervate!”
His voice was a breathless whisper.
His eyes flew open, and settling on Harry, he let his mouth drop open and looked at him with an expression that he felt was more comical than questioning.
It had been a steep learning curve for them both, but patience and their refusal to give up had paid off in the end. They’d started slowly, gradually working their way up to a full suspension. Ever since that very first suspension tie, Draco had been filled with a hunger for it and yearned for it so much that it had become the prime focus of their play over the last few years. They’d even gone as far as performing for others. Yes, they also indulged in many other types of play, spanking and orgasm denial being one of their favourites, but rope had forged a deep and everlasting connection between them—the kind neither of them could imagine living without.
“That rumour is outdated, Potter. You should pay a bit more attention to what they share over the grapevine. Recent rumours have it that you’re engaged to the Wizengamot’s best prosecutor.”
Andromeda asked once more whether he really didn’t mind looking after Teddy for the rest of the day. Although Draco had a massive pile of files to get through for an upcoming trial, he lied straight through his teeth and told her that he was free and very much capable of taking care of Teddy. She looked at least half-convinced and pulling Teddy into a squishy hug, she kissed his forehead and left, pulling the door closed behind her.
Smiling, Harry pulled his large hands out of Teddy’s smaller ones, and crouching down in front of his godson, he cupped his face and held it between his hands.
Biting back a dirty smirk, Harry placed his left hand on top of his napkin-covered finger and effortlessly cast a wandless and non-verbal transfiguration charm.
He straightened up a little and sipped on his coffee, intently watching as Malfoy did the same, then responded to him.
“I know you will be, you are my good little prince, my perfect little prince, my sweet boy.”
He couldn’t take the thought of being slowly teased.
In recent years, he’d settled for silent acceptance and quiet indifference. Some Muggle inventions still felt strange to him, but thanks to Harry he’d acquainted himself with most of them. Some truly made life more comfortable, others stunned Draco into complete disbelief or sparked intense curiosity and the desire to master them. So far, none had led him to judge Muggles in any way. His opinions and beliefs had changed a long time ago, and Harry had opened his mind to many things. Gone was the boy who took his father’s words for gospel. Draco prided himself on the fact that he’d grown, changed, and adapted to a new way of thinking. He no longer dismissed things because he didn’t know anything about them and only judged people once he’d had the chance to get to know them at least a little bit, for the most part anyway. There was the occasional exception, of course. In Draco’s book, a fashion faux pas was an inexcusable crime, and Draco judged people who committed them harshly and with wild abandon.
“Rest assured, Sir, my lips are sealed. Am I to understand that I’m yours for the rest of the evening or have you just stopped by to check that I'm still your good boy?”
Harry smiled.
Harry wasn’t entirely sure how to handle Molly’s wicked smile. It wasn’t something one saw often, and Harry couldn’t help but wonder whether Molly had, perhaps, taken a few too many liberties with her favourite sherry earlier today.
His voice sounded strained. He looked tense and nervous but forced a smile.
With a broad smile, Draco gently tapped his perfectly manicured fingernails against the smooth surface of the small, igneous rock in his hand. He relished in the feel of sophisticated perfection―only Mother Nature had the power and resources to create something so marvellous. Draco took an extra moment or two to let his fingertips slide over the shiny uppermost layer, allowing himself to be filled with the innocent amazement of a child.
A couple of minutes of silence past between them, then Harry slowly leant forward and placed forearms on top of his desk. It was littered with stacks of case files. One of those files lay open in front of him, and leaning forward, Draco lengthened his neck a bit. He managed to make out his own photograph and full name, but couldn’t read any of the writing; however, it looked like Harry had meticulously filled out several investigation reports, as well as a few case reports and case updates.
There’d been weeks where he’d barely slept a wink and days where hexing everyone, and everything around him had been the only thing, he’d been able to focus on. Eventually, after a long, arduous journey, he’d worked through all the heartache, the loss, the pain, the nightmares, the vivid flashbacks, and the fear that it had all been for nothing.
There was a defensive sort of undertone to his voice.
“What―”
Once he’d carefully poured the water into the teapot and emptied the rest of water out of the kettle to not inadvertently boil it again, he stopped dithering and turned around again. His hands found their way into the pockets of his jeans, and he pushed them all the way inside, then resumed their conversation.
It was that downright devious smile he brought out whenever he was about to turn into a cat who’d just devoured a plate of cream.
Molly smiled.
The fact that Malfoy’s hand was still steadily edging upwards and was now only inches away from his groin didn’t make things any easier. Harry could feel his blood rushing south, and he was acutely aware of the fact that his cock was gradually filling out, straining against the confines of his jeans.
However, instead of giving in to that particular desire, Harry settled for letting his hand rest low on Draco’s hip. He moved further to the edge of his barstool and squeezed Draco’s hip hard enough to pull a hiss from him.
“Are you sure you know what you’re asking for?”
Harry’s praise resulted in Draco blushing a deep shade of red. He gnawed at his bottom lip and dragging it into his mouth, he worried it with his teeth but stopped when Harry clicked his tongue in silent disapproval. Instead, he let out a soft gasp and a moan when Harry, once again, simultaneously pumped his cock and dragged his fingers up and down the inside of Draco’s thigh.
Love,
“Are you going to make the potion tonight?”
“Good boys don’t get the belt, fear not, my little prince. Good boys get all the love and all the kisses.”
Even without the intense sex and the marks Harry, with his consent, left on him, it was the sweetest and most potent form of mind control, Draco had ever experienced in his entire life. It was addictive and exhilarating, and Draco had no other words to describe the all-consuming rush he felt whenever he submitted to Harry. He loved to obey Harry’s every command and willingly did so without hesitation. He had no desire to question any of Sir’s decisions. In those moments, Harry knew best. He was his anchor and the one person that could provide him with the stability and the confidence he needed, in what was an otherwise uncertain situation.
“You know, I think I’d actually like to try and play with someone. Well, no, wait, that didn’t come outright. I’d like to meet someone, and if we click, I think I might want to play with them. Like, I don’t want to say that I’m ready for it, but I’ve been thinking about it, and I’d―”
“There are other hotels in Paris that offer the same sort of services.”
Draco’s jaw tightened further. His eyes narrowed, and he glowered, but instead of spitting out an insult, he merely pressed his lips firmly together and petulantly gave Harry the silent treatment.
Harry bit the inside of his mouth to help him keep a straight face. He knew precisely where Draco’s entirely instinctive aptitude for drama came from ― throughout the six years they’d spent at Hogwarts together, Draco had always gone above and beyond to make sure that Harry noticed him, and ninety-nine-point-nine per cent of the time he’d succeeded. Harry wasn’t even ashamed to admit that ― Draco had always been on his mind.
Draco whispered the words into his ear, and Harry nodded.
Not really interested in whatever was happening on the screen, Draco had made every attempt to distract Harry, and eventually, he’d succeeded.
“I made it potent, but I can assure you all this phial of Dreamless Sleep will do is knock you out for 12-hours straight. There’s nothing in there that will in any way impair your memory. You’ll wake up fresh as a daisy tomorrow.”
There was absolutely nothing real about Harry’s smile.
He placed two fingers underneath Draco’s chin and turned his head, applying gentle force to get him to meet his eye.”
Harry chuckled.
“Everything alright, my love?”
“Just because Uncle Ron loves using ‘bloody’ every two seconds you don’t need to do the same, young man,” he chided.
Draco grinned unashamedly.
She smiled at her husband, dropped her arms to her sides and motioned for Dobby to leave.
Draco shrunk in his chair.
Next, he placed it on top of the bed, near the headboard, then slowly dragged his black boxer briefs down. He folded those too, and put them down on top of his trousers, then gingerly climbed onto the bed and lay down on his front, making sure that the two pillows, he’d brought upstairs with him, rested underneath his hips.
Caleb laughed in response to his threat.
Teddy shrugged listlessly.
As usual, check it out if you want, or ignore it, I'm just offering.
“Spit it out already,” he said.
Something fierce roared to life deep inside of him and letting it take over, he broke into a slow jog. Feeling completely at ease and comfortable in his own skin, he allowed the creature inside of him to guide him, willingly relinquishing control over where he placed his feet.
“That feels so good, please don’t stop, Sir.”
“I’m done dating, Charlie, you know that,” he says quite firmly and with a lot of conviction. It’s true. He’s really had enough of putting himself out there and opening up to someone new. Things have gone wrong one too many times, and if Harry is honest―which he usually isn’t, at least not when it comes to matters of the heart―he’s still a bit scarred from the ordeal Jasper put him through.
To distract himself, he thought about the rope burns, he’d be left with once Harry decided to take the harness off.
“Cheers, mate. Appreciate that.”
“Nana Tonks?” Narcissa interrupted with a somewhat disbelieving expression.
“Yes?”
Ron had gathered up all the children, solicited the help of several friends, and they’d all floo’ed to Diagon Alley to enjoy cold treats at Florean Fortescue's Ice-Cream Parlour, and have lunch at the Leaky Cauldron. In the afternoon, he’d organised a magical sport’s fest in the empty field adjacent to the Burrow’s back garden, and by the time the guests started to arrive, all the children had been perfectly dressed and on their best behaviour.
For a split-second, it looked like Draco might take a step back, but he didn’t.
“We are crystal-clear, but I do have one more question before I’m ready to drop this conversation for good.”
“Ouch!”
Draco pouted but didn’t object.
“Absolutely.”
“If you give me the chance to prove my innocence with regards to trespassing onto Government property, I promise you, no harm will come to you.”
“That would be putting it mil― Oh, for Salazar’s sake, Potter, must you be so utterly ostentatious, you wretched human?”
even if we don’t have a
“I don’t sue, I prosecute, and trust me, you wouldn’t want to be the defendant. I show no mercy, and I always win.”
“Hm, I think you might be right.”
He shifted, felt Draco pull back a little and they both locked eyes and smiled.
“And?”
Since the idea was rapidly becoming far too distracting, Harry pulled himself swiftly back into the here and now and focused on dressing the rope. Just as before, he checked that it was in the right place, made sure that it was tight but not tight enough to cut into Draco’s skin and injure him, and only once he was happy with his work, he looked up at Draco, who looked down at him with his eyes half-closed.
“Noted, Master Charlie.”
Inhaling deeply, he watched Draco over the rim of his cup and waited with his first sip until Draco had sat down and opened the biscuit packet. Right this moment, it was more important than coffee, and Harry knew as much.
Draco nodded.
Savouring one last mouthful of his coffee, Harry, albeit somewhat reluctantly, parted company with the mug that contained his favourite beverage. He left it sitting on its coaster on the table, and walked back over to Draco, who, the moment he approached the piano, looked up at him with a strange half-frown edged into his forehead. He looked cautious with a smidgen of distrust thrown in. Just for good measure, of course.
“Taxi, I suppose,” he said.
“If it gets a rise out of you then it’s never too late,” he said.
Harry smiled.
“Of course, I do, I never said otherwise. Listen, will you at least consider signing up as a mystery speaker?”
Harry smiled.
“I’ll be good, I promise,” Draco whispered.
Draco nodded.
“Perhaps, but rumour has it that I’m dating the Wizengamot’s best prosecutor, so I’m not worried.”
“What’s there to lie about? I’ll get Mione to drop by Harry’s office later today and invite him and you over to the house for dinner tomorrow night. She’s been going on and on about having the two of you over for a couple weeks now, and quite frankly, it’s grating on my nerves. Mum’s got time to take the baby for the night, so it’ll just be the four of us. All you need to do is to ensure that you and Harry show up on time. How difficult is that? Me and Mione are doing all the work here.”
Draco rolled his eyes, marked a page in his case file, then snapped it closed and placed it on top of the table.
He still didn’t look like he was entirely at ease, but Harry chose not to question his behaviour in front of their friends. Instead, he pretended like he hadn’t noticed that Draco deliberately dithered in the doorway for a few seconds before stepping across the threshold.
“Nu-huh, my little prince. You can come when I say so, and that time is not now. I want you to show me how good you can be for me.”
Draco demanded her full attention and abandoning any and all thoughts about her husband, Narcissa focused on him.
Draco cleared his throat and turning back to the previous page, he took a moment to compose himself while Harry waited patiently.
Draco nodded.
Draco melted against him, buried his face in his chest and whimpered softly.
He was only mildly surprised when two strong arms slithered around his waist. Harry embraced him from behind, hugging him tightly, and he felt Harry’s rather prominent erection press against the crack between his arse cheeks.
Somehow, this rope didn’t feel much different to the ropes Harry used whenever he tied him up. Draco suddenly found himself yearning for the incredibly rush he felt whenever Harry meticulously bound him with long coils of bondage rope, creating beautiful knots and leaving him with the most fantastic rope burns.
He knew what Draco was like when he was tired, and this was not it.
He took a few deep breaths to further centre himself, then smiled, mouthing a soundless ‘
Draco didn’t immediately answer the question.
With that, Draco rather resolutely picked himself off the ground, stood up, brushed his robes off and rearranged them a little to make himself look a bit more presentable. He moved towards the door, and by the time he’d reached for the door handle, Potter had also gotten to his feet.
“Surprise me, my little prince,” he said.
He blinked, and Harry leant in and pressing his lips against Draco’s, he kissed him softly to show his appreciation.
Harry’s amused laugh annoyed Draco thoroughly, but instead of allowing it to really get to him, he simply snatched the phone out of Harry’s hand and commandeered the internet browser. At the same time, Harry temporarily lowered the anti-apparition wards that protected Grimmauld Place and focused on getting them to their destination. To avoid negatively affecting Harry’s concentration, Draco momentarily stopped checking stuff on Harry’s phone and emptying his mind, he allowed Harry to firmly grasp his biceps in preparation for a spot of side-along apparition.
Harry deliberately lowered his voice, infused it with warmth and gave it a husky undertone that had Draco shift on his piano stool. It was a small shove, almost unnoticeable, but Harry could hear the friction of Draco’s exquisite tailor-made black trousers rubbing against the stool’s smooth leather. Harry’s ears also picked up on the way Draco breathed; heavier and slightly more laboured as though he’d just walked up several flights of stairs, though, perhaps, not quite as obvious. His heart was most definitely beating faster, and when he spoke, his voice was softer and deeper, evidence of the fact that the muscles that controlled his vocal cords, had tightened up slightly.
Harry kissed him fiercely and with wild abundance until his lungs began to protest massively. It was only then that he grudgingly broke away from the kiss and smiled.
“Took me a while to work out what bug bid you but now that I know, I can finally help you get back on track.”
Draco didn’t lift his head and didn’t open his eyes.
Harry smiled.
Harry’s laugh mildly infuriated Draco, but there was also something warm about it that wormed its way underneath his skin and made it somewhat challenging to be more than slightly peeved. For a moment, Draco stubbornly fixed his gaze on one of the narrow, profiled glazing bars that divided the Master bedroom’s Georgian sash windows into fifteen smaller glass panes. Eventually, his resolve broke and unable to keep a straight face, he gave in and smiled.
Harry reciprocated and reducing the amount of pressure against Draco’s pulse point, he returned to drawing slow and steady circles. His touch worked its magic and the tension that had been threatening to take over, flowed away, allowing Draco to relax and focus.
“No, look at me, my love. Don’t close your eyes. I want to see my little prince come undone,” he said.
“Early night for you then, my love, I'll put you to bed just as soon as we get home. Come on, let’s go into the living room and commandeer the sofa. If you like, you can have a cuddle.”
“Deal.”
He brought his other hand up and traced Draco’s light-pink lips with the tip of his thumb.
Draco’s mouth dropped open, and his hand almost automatically went to his wand holster.
Harry frowned, but instead of asking any more questions, he simply cleaned his fingers with a wandless spell and moved his mug of tea so that there was no chance of him accidentally spilling it. Pulling the grimoire closer to him, he opened it and started leafing through the pages.
Cold and very disgruntled, Harry sits up and crosses his arms over his chest.
He needed Harry’s touch; the softness of his fingertips, trailing along his cheekbones, teasing his lips, and the sharp line of his jaw.
“May your mind always be free from stress, and whenever it isn’t, or your find yourself clouded by troubles, may you turn and lean on me. I’ll be there to protect you.”
Instead, Draco casually rested a hand on Harry’s thigh, just above the knee, and Harry felt the body heat seep from the palm of Draco’s hand, through the thick fabric of his jeans, and directly into his skin. Draco didn’t squeeze or apply any other form of pressure, but Harry felt him relax into his proprietorial embrace, content with letting him have this moment, allowing him to be in control.
Draco obediently parted his lips, and Harry slowly eased his cock inside, relishing in the warm wetness.
“You’re divine, absolutely divine,” he whispered.
“Earth to Malfoy!”
Draco swirled around, and simultaneously drawing his wand and pushing Harry up against the kitchen counter, he used his own body weight to hold him in place, then grabbed a fistful of Harry’s scarlet Auror robes. He pressed the tip of his hawthorn wand against Harry’s jugular and glared hard.
Harry rubbed his fingertip over Draco’s nipple and hummed against Draco’s shoulder.
Scorpius question resulted in Draco turning his head to look at his son, who was curled up on a comfortable leather sofa across the room. His favourite book lay open in his lap.
Draco obeyed without questioning him.
A delectable tremor surged through Draco, and Harry felt every second of it.
“You might think that you want me to punish you, and your mouth may say so, but deep down in here, you don’t want me to spank you for what you did. Besides, if I really spanked you for what you did, I’d have to spank Ron too, or it wouldn’t be fair, and somehow, I don’t think he or Hermione would consent to that.”
It took him well over an hour of meticulously hard work to restore the two guest rooms, he’d turned into a copy of his office and a holding cell.
He still couldn’t believe that he’d barely felt anything and when Charlie asked him whether he wanted another lash, Draco mutely nodded, except this time he kept his eyes open and focused on Harry, who held his gaze and smiled warmly.
“Yes, fuck, so much. It was all so new, and I was terrified, but he was so sweet and gentle, and I just couldn’t resist him, it was the last thing I wanted to do. There simply didn’t seem to be a single good reason for me to say no, and so I just did what he asked me to do.”
Draco smiled.
Harry grinned.
Draco trembled, gasped, and moaned, and Harry squeezed his hips a little harder.
Potter stopped talking for good. He leant back in his chair, then sat up straight, threw one leg over the other, uncrossed them again, and finally put one arm other the other so that each hand rested on the opposite elbow. It wasn’t necessarily a gesture of defiance―Draco thought―but more because Potter seemingly didn’t have anything else to do.
“I like you,” he said.
“Whatever are you insinuating, Malfoy? I’m not up to anything. The same, however, cannot be said about you.”
Draco flinched at the sudden and intense pain but closed his eyes and let it flood his senses.
Draco’s begged and pleaded.
Harry pressed the tip of his tongue against Draco’s hole, pleased when the muscle immediately relaxed and granted him entrance as though it wanted nothing more but to trap him right there, keeping him as intimately close as he could possibly get to Draco. He pushed his tongue inside, then pulled back and repeated the action several times over.
I also love reading your wonderful comments, there’s literally all sorts. There are the short notes, the excited gushes and the long rambles and I love each and every one for different reasons. I don’t pick a favourite because there is none, but please know that when I struggle to put the words together, when I struggle to get them from my head through my fingers and onto the screen, all your support and love helps. I love reading your thoughts on the characters, the plot and various other aspects. Your words are welcome, so much. Thank you again.
Harry was about to open his mouth and tell Molly that there was absolutely no way that he was going to agree to an engagement party when the front door of the Burrow flew open and none other but Draco Malfoy, still wearing his prosecutor’s robes, strode inside. He had his wand drawn and waving it at the door; he slammed it with such venom that the hinges creaked and the entire house groaned.
“Malfoy, stop this nonsense and let go of me.”
“Just don’t listen to Uncle George or Uncle Ron.”
“Insatiable little thing you, I think a lesson in controlling yourself is in order very soon, don’t you?”
“I swear he was fine Saturday night and all of Sunday. I don’t think he slept particularly well Sunday night though. He didn’t hear his alarm on Monday morning, slept right through it. I actually had to shake him awake, and he was so grumpy and short-tempered. At first, I didn’t think anything of it. I mean, I’d be cranky too if tossed and turned half the night and then had to get up for work in the morning.”
“I’ve known him since he was born, I think I can tell.”
Charlie couldn’t help but laugh.
Draco shrugged.
Draco swallowed, and Harry watched him curl both hands into tight fists.
Selly
They continued to swing backwards and forwards and even though the motion wasn’t particularly wild, Draco couldn’t help but feel as though he and Harry were flying through the air. For a moment, he wasn’t entirely sure whether the garden’s magic was affecting him more than Harry. During his previous visits to the garden, he’d never felt like this before. His love for Harry buzzed through him and he felt more alive than he’d ever felt before.
Draco gasped and sucked in a large amount of air, then slowly exhaled. A tremor surged through him, and Harry placed his other hand on the inside of Draco’s thigh. He dragged his nails over the sensitive, already-marked skin and twisted his lubed fingers and palm up and down the length of Draco’s cock. It pulsed in his hand, and Harry applied a bit of pressure.
“It wasn’t the tease of the whip but rather the way you were looking at me,” he mumbled.
Potter’s question somewhat stunned Draco, but he resisted the urge to frown and shook his head instead.
(See the end of the chapter for
After a moment of silence, he took a deep breath and spoke again.
Do enjoy.
A soft smirk curled around Malfoy’s lips and Harry couldn’t help but reciprocate. He took another sip of his coffee, then dragged his fingers further up Malfoy’s arm, trailing along his bare forearm, and the bend of his elbow, before letting it vanish underneath Malfoy’s loose T-shirt. Harry dragged the sleeve up and squeezed Malfoy’s shoulder firmly.
“I know you can, my little prince.”
“Did you― Did you― Are you serious?”
In response, Harry peppered Draco’s milky-white skin, with kisses and left several bite marks behind. He sucked at the skin on Draco’s neck until it turned purple and did the same to the inside of Draco’s upper arms, his sides and his thighs.
Harry smiled.
, he thought.
Harry urged Draco for the third time, lifted his head just enough to kiss Draco. This time his kiss was different. It wasn’t devouring. He wasn’t trying to possessively claim Draco. No, this kiss was soft and gentle. It was loving, filled to the brim with all the love he felt for Draco, and it made all the difference. The stark contrast pushed Draco over the edge, and Harry felt him clench around his fingers, pulling them deeper inside of him and trapping them there.
He chats with the kids, and Rose tells him about a dream she had earlier this morning, then asks what he thinks it might mean. Harry ponders for a while, then makes up a fantastic interpretation that has Rose happily grinning from ear to ear. Harry delights in the fact that, despite being the smartest almost-six-year-old he knows, Rose still loves it when he tells her fanciful stories about unicorns, dragons, and centaurs. She knows that those creatures are all real, but usually get caught up in the moment, and Harry hopes she’ll keep that childish innocence of hers for a couple more years.
It took Draco the longest time to find the will to break away from their kiss, and once he’d finally gathered up the necessary energy to do so, Harry and he were both thoroughly breathless with flushed cheeks and slick, swollen lips. Panting hard, Draco stared at Harry, mesmerised and as though they hadn’t done this, share an intimate kiss, a thousand times before.
With Teddy’s limbs tightly wrapped around his torso, Harry walked further into the room, crouched down beside Draco and leant in to give him a kiss which Draco, rather willingly, reciprocated. It was a rather tame kiss, but Draco relished in it anyway.
“Could you shift right now?”
“I figured she would.”
After he’d swallowed it all down, he reached for his coffee and took several sips, then held Draco’s gaze.
“Sir, may I have a kiss, please?” Draco asked with a slightly whiney undertone.
He drew his wand and aimed it at Harry’s chest.
“You can glare all you like, dragon, you don’t scare me. Now, listen carefully, I’m going to tell you a little story about myself. This happened more than a decade ago. I’d been involved in the scene for a few years, but I was still relatively new to it all, not uneducated but new. I’d less experience than Harry has now. At the time I was dating this beautiful slave girl, she was a couple years older than me, far more experienced. Caleb introduced her to me at a munch.
“Of course―”
Molly nodded.
Harry let the knowledge sink in, and as Caleb withdrew his hand, he breathed deeply and felt yet another weight, he hadn’t known he’d been carrying around with himself, lift off his shoulder.
“Not enough, Harry Potter, not enough.”
“Doesn’t hurt to remind you occasionally, Master. Especially when dragons are involved.”
Draco’s jaw dropped in shock, and he blinked, swallowed hard, then blinked again.
“What are your plans for making an honest man out of that handsome boyfriend of yours?”
His love was unconditional, and it was moments like this when Harry witnessed Draco’s childlike excitement and the genuine joy, he so clearly felt whenever the Muggle world baffled him completely. It wasn’t often that Harry saw that side of Draco. He was extremely good at remaining composed and in complete control of his emotions, but sometimes, just sometimes, he dropped the mask, and Harry got a glimpse that the boy Draco had always wanted but never been allowed, to be.
“Andy. For Salazar’s sake, stop fussing. I’ll look after Teddy; he’ll be fine with me.”
“This wrist thing.”
A finger landed on Draco’s lips, and he felt Harry trace first his bottom lip, then the top one.
“You were saying?”
Taking another bite of his sandwich, Harry chewed slowly and deliberately, then washed the last bits down with a generous sip of coffee.
“The hidden place?”
He stroked harder still, and soon enough, Harry felt him clench around his cock, making it almost impossible to continue thrusting.
Harry clicked his tongue.
“Not yet.”
“Blissfully unaware. He hasn’t got a clue, though he brought it up the other day.”
Harry smiled.
Teacup still in hand, and feeling sublimely relaxed, Draco turned his attention back to the book in his lap. A moment later, he was lost, swept away by the author’s comically entertaining writing. By page two, he chuckled softly under his breath but laughed out loud upon reaching the next paragraph.
time with friends and family? I mean, Harry and I do a decent job at making time for each other, but occasionally we do struggle, and we don’t have nearly as much on our plates.”
“No, look at me, my love. You’re stunning like this. I love seeing you in my ropes.”
Harry often asked him to dance, but in the two years they’d been together, they’d never danced at a Ministry function. This was a first and Draco had an inkling that their little show was bound to make it onto the front page of The Prophet.
“Aren’t the doors supposed to stay open at all times?”
Harry chuckled.
Granger had told Potter to come to him. Why?
From what he remembered, the pen’s name was
Scorpius didn’t hesitate and making sure that he didn’t fall, Draco allowed his son to climb onto his back. He wrapped his little legs around Draco’s waist and his arms loosely Draco’s neck and checking to make sure that he was holding on, Draco set off, heading for the kitchen to make that late-night hot chocolate, he’d just promised his son.
“We fight differently now, and I think I like that better.”
“The last three years have been somewhat of a rollercoaster, haven't they, my little prince? If you ask me, we've built something incredible together, something I never ever hoped to find, but always wanted. You've shown me, time and time again, that you trust me, absolutely and unconditionally, and bared your soul to me to prove it. In return, I bared mine to you. I stand here today before you because I want you to know that I love you, deeply, truly, and madly, with every fibre of my being. For this reason, I wish to pledge myself to you for all eternity, though not as your partner and future husband, but as your Dominant, as the one person, you can always rely on to give you exactly what you need and desire. I wish to guide you, continue to explore the world of kink with you, and continue to push your boundaries with the promise of placing your safety, and mental, and physical wellbeing above all.”
“Yes, my little prince?”
And Harry looked.
Harry clicked his tongue.
He spat that last word like some sort of insult and felt a shudder surge through him. There was a lot of Muggle stuff Harry had successfully introduced him to, but there was something about trains that ran underground that thoroughly crept Draco out. He couldn’t quite put his finger on it and didn’t fancy dwelling on what exactly made him uncomfortable about the idea, but the first―and last―time Harry had tried to convince him to take the tube, he’d made it perfectly clear that he wasn’t partial to any and all things Muggle. He had his limits, and the London underground fell into that category.
“Nothing, Teddy, nothing. I’m sure Hagrid will cover Hippogriffs as well. I wouldn’t be surprised if he talks Charlie into showing you all a real-life dragon.”
“If it makes you feel better, Potter, I’m happy to take all the blame.”
Finding himself stood in the centre of Draco’s living room, Harry took a casual glance around. After yesterday’s meeting, which had run late, and their subsequent dinner, the place was still a bit of a mess. Somehow, the fact that the room wasn’t as pristine as it had been upon their arrival two days ago filled Harry with a sense of familiarity. When he realised that they’d both ordered the exact same breakfast, Harry couldn’t help but chuckle quietly to himself.
Draco straightened up so abruptly that he spilt half of the contents of his coffee cup over his trousers, and promptly started choking on the breath of air, he’d just inhaled. Coughing into the palm of his hand, he abandoned his coffee on the table and reached for a napkin to dry his soaked trousers.
Scorpius didn’t have to be asked twice, and the two of them spent the next half hour picking out several tailor-made suits, matching shirts, ties, shoes, and socks.
“I told him to keep his big mouth shut and his comments to himself. He decided to repeatedly ignore my warnings and this time I am retaliating. He’s got it coming. Revenge is sweet, Malfoy, revenge is sweet.”
He looked devilishly handsome, and Draco’s heart skipped a beat. His cock hardened further, twitching and silently begging for attention, and his balls tightened considerably. His tight hole fluttered, and Draco couldn’t think of anything but feeling Harry’s cock inside of him. He wanted Harry to fuck his mouth until he gagged and torrential rivers of drool ran down his chin and dripped onto his chest and then he wanted Harry to fuck his arse. He wanted Harry to pound into him and grab his hair as he did so. He also wanted Harry to restrain his arms behind his back, yank his wrists up to right between his shoulder blades and push him down while he took his pleasure.
Draco winced.
“Tell your embroiderer that Wizengamot is not spelt with two z’s.”
“I remember,” Harry said.
Draco instinctively nodded, but Harry clicked his tongue and shook his head.
Draco smiled at once.
“What problem?” he asked.
“The correct form of address is
These days, the inscription beneath the wizard’s statue read:
“Who else would I be if not a Malfoy?” he asked.
He gave Draco another few minutes to calm down a little more, then ensured that both his hands were slick and dripping with lube. He wrapped one hand around Draco’s cock and slipped the other between his arse cheeks and slowly sliding two fingers inside of him, Harry curled them a little and pressed against Draco’s prostate.
Harry smiled.
Without thinking, he reached up and placed his hand on top of Harry’s squeezing it gently.
In the centre of the play space, several of the BDSM furniture had been moved to the side, leaving ample room for a circular stage. It was slightly raised to give everyone an excellent view of the scene that was about to start. A moment later, a floodlight illuminated the stage, and the first of many eighties’ tunes filled the room. A woman, wearing a loose black dress and black high-heeled shoes, stepped onto the stage and bowed to the audience.
When he returned with a full pot of steaming hot coffee in his left hand and his favourite mug in his right hand, Teddy was still on the floor in front of the coffee table, quietly colouring and drawing.
“Would he dare, though?”
He paused to step closer to Harry and leaning in, he whispered his next words directly into Harry’s ear.
“You think?”
Harry licked his lips.
He didn’t need to say more. That one word was potent enough, and he watched, mesmerised, as Draco, without hesitation or embarrassment, gracefully sank to his knees right in front of him. He did so without removing his hands from behind his back, and when he went to lower his head in silent surrender, Harry cupped his chin and gently forced him to look up. Draco face was only a couple of inches away from his crotch and since he hadn’t yet put his trousers on, they were still lying on the bed, Harry could feel Draco’s laboured breathing through the thin fabric of his black boxer briefs.
The earth smelt wonderfully wet and fresh, a lingering reminder of the sprinkle of rain that had fallen in the early hours of the morning. There were hints of fallen rotting tree trunks, wild jasmine, and ever-growing deep orange honeysuckle. The subtle yet pervasive quality of a vast selection of edible mushrooms and berries fused with eucalyptus and thick, fresh moss, abundantly growing, and clinging to old stones and exposed tree roots. A pleasant vanilla type smell of a congregation of centuries-old ponderosa pines, not native to the area but somehow still perfectly content to have made the Hogwarts grounds their home, wafted through the air, mixing with juniper, pinyon pine, and cliffroses.
Caleb, who’d come off a heavy twenty-four-hour shift at the firehouse this morning, had spent most of the day sleeping, and presently looked a little rugged with a clear five o’clock shadow, but it was the sort of tiredness that could be easily fixed with a proper night’s sleep and a weekend of unrestrained fun with Stefan.
He’d been smitten with Ginny at Hogwarts, but after the war, that relationship had fizzled out relatively quickly.
Harry gently caressed his cheek, using his fingertips and featherlight touches to offset the tight hold he had on Draco’s hair.
“Nu-huh, my little prince. I’m not convinced you really want it. If you do, you’ll beg for it like the good boy you are. You are my good boy, aren’t you?”
Malfoy shrugged.
Draco raised an eyebrow at Potter.
“Tom Riddle,” he said.
, because that would be utterly immoral, not to mention illegal. Besides, ever since he and Ginny finally called that preposterous spoof of a marriage a day and he’s kicked Jasper out the door, Walter has been a faithful companion. It wouldn’t be fair to use such measures, though Harry has to admit―only to himself though―that sometimes, just sometimes, he’s sorely tempted.
Harry rolled his eyes.
“Of course, I will. In case it slipped your attention, I’m a big boy. As for Draco, he might be a two-legged dragon, but he’s got a glare that’s far more potent than the flames of even the most vicious dragon mother.”
There was a cocky sort of undercurrent in his voice, and Harry smiled a little.
“Come on, not even for your business partner?” he asks.
“You tell me everything, tell me that too.”
At nearly fifteen, Lily was slowly turning into a fine young woman, and Draco couldn’t help but notice, yet again, how much she resembled Harry’s mother. He’d thought it obvious when he’d first seen her photograph next to an old magical picture of Harry’s beloved mother, but throughout the last few years, the likeness between the two had firmly cemented itself in Draco’s mind.
He boldly held Draco’s gaze and took another step closer, making it so that there was barely any gap between them at all.
“Nobody is putting you in a box.”
“Yes,” he whispered, “I consent.”
he thought possessively,
Feeling thoroughly relaxed and happy, Harry leant back in his chair and grinned to himself. Dinner had been absolutely fantastic, and his and Draco’s earlier impromptu play meant that he was still on a high.
“He’s my property, I have his permission to do with him as I please when I please. If I want to corrupt him, I absolutely will.”
“You’re well fit, Sir, of course, I like what I see,” he said.
Harry laughed.
Draco took a moment to digest the information Potter had just given him. It was a lot, and even though he knew that he’d only just scratched the surface, he already understood why Potter had demanded that he take a secrecy oath.
, Sir, please, just―”
Harry smiled.
“I love you.”
“You’ll be good for me, won’t you, my little prince?”
Most of his students manage to successfully remove all the wards, and Harry watches with a fondness―which he reserves for those rare occasions where he spends a day at Hogwarts to lecture―as more and more boxes spring open. Two students eagerly reach inside their boxes and immediately pay the price for their thoughtless actions, but the remainder of his class tries their best to remove the jinx before they touch the transfigured pebble inside.
He wasn’t cold, but he still shuddered.
I'll also get around to responding to comments very soon but it's parent/teacher day this week so I've got preparations to do.
Harry smiled to himself and letting his gaze casually wander around the room, he allowed his eyes to briefly settle on Draco. He was still sat on his custom-made piano stool.
“They’ll fuck.”
“The Healer said no strenuous exercise, Potter.”
Malcolm’s words pulled Draco out of his reverie and shaking off his daze, he smiled at his friend.
“Outstanding, Hira really outdid himself this time. That man is a genius. If magic were real, I’d say he’s a wizard.”
Charlie sent the whip flying through the air for the third time, and it wrapped itself around Liam’s knees. On the fourth crack, it hugged his thighs, and on the fifth, it sneaked around his hips, then his waist, and finally his chest.
“I’m OK,” he whispered.
Harry pulled back a little and quirked his brow at him.
Claire, his faithful second-in-command, stood at the far end of the counter, quite clearly lost in her own imagination. A somewhat goofy smile curled around her lips. She was also doodling something or other on a piece of paper in front of her. Draco highly doubted that she was paying any attention to whatever she was drawing.
’ for her in front of their friends, something she’d often done when they’d been much younger and before they’d tied the knot.
Draco pressed his lips together, then exhaled, and shuddered.
“If I were you, I wouldn’t even think about that. Draco rather likes my arse, and I’m sure he’ll be distraught if he finds out that you bruised it in any shape or form.”
You can find a link for some extra-reading in the footnotes.
“You say that now. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I better head inside and grovel at my boyfriend’s feet, begging for forgiveness.”
“The Weasleys. Hermione. McGonagall. Slughorn. That’s about it.”
Charlie turned his head to look at Draco.
’ won’t do, I’m afraid.”
“How crude. I think I’ll head over to Taylor’s for a much-needed espresso to recover from your threat to end my life before I’ve even reached my prime.”
The words left his mouth before he’d actively considered saying them aloud.
The moment the words left his mouth, a shudder surged down his spine.
Draco gritted his teeth, and even though he could feel the tears sting his eyes, he tried his hardest to keep it together and focused on the fact that they were still inside the Ministry.
Instead, he played it cool and merely giving the note a cursory glance, he remained entirely nonchalant about it. On the outside, anyway. On the inside, his mind was occupied with trying to work out just what Potter was playing at, but despite fixing Potter with a piercing stare, Potter’s poker face gave away absolutely nothing. Somehow, he simultaneously managed to look like a man who had nothing to hide and a man who had everything to hide. It was vexing, and Draco was on the verge of losing his cool.
He ate about half of his second clementine, offered a carpel to Draco, then placed his hand back on top of Draco’s and squeezed it lightly.
’, she turns, grabs a handful of Floo Powder and disappears in a flash of green flames.
“It has the potential to be both, right now it’s praise.”
He flexed his hand and buried it in the pocket of his jacket, curling it into a loose fist.
He’d dipped it into Potter’s antique-looking ink-jar and signed the charmed paper with an overly extravagant flourish, effectively agreeing to take Potter’s secret to his grave.
“Snake or not, you’ve got to admit that I’m handsome,” Draco taunted, changing his tune.
“I thought I’d have to, I don’t know, do a couple of sessions with a psychologist to work on my confidence. I’m not the most outgoing person in the world.”
Draco swallowed hard.
P.S. My darling CB, there's a massive clue in this chapter for you. Get on it, Sherlock!
“Sleep, my love.”
Draco responded without the slightest hesitation. His entire arm was relaxed and tension-free, and Harry pulled it behind his back, bend it at the elbow and wound the rope around it, dragging it over Draco’s skin, causing delectable friction.
“You just had to put the two together in one sentence, did you?”
“Knowing you, Tom, you’ll probably break all of your bones trying to do that, not that it would be much of a loss.”
Harry took the glass from him, and when their fingers brushed together, Draco shuddered a little. He hastily averted his eyes, focused his attention on the wine in his own glass, and slowly bringing it up to his lips, he took a small sip, hoping it might calm his nerves.
“Have you got it?” she hissed.
“Yeah, when you want to be, monkey. Which, admittedly, isn’t very often.”
Since his arms were still wrapped around Draco’s waist, Harry let his left hand slip down to Draco’s arse. He squeezed one cheek, grasped it firmly, and held on to it, delighting in the way Draco gasped.
Harry smiled.
I disagree.
For a moment, Draco looked positively lecherous, then he swallowed, shook his head slightly and frowned.
Draco pressed his lips together and said nothing else. He swished his wand, and with a non-verbal incantation, he replaced the navy grasscloth accent wall covering with a sand-coloured one. In an instant, the space felt warm and enveloping.
In private, Harry sometimes liked to compare Draco to the famous Sherlock Holmes, though he knew better than to say that in front of Draco. Still, he often wondered whether Draco could read him just as well and although he fancied the idea that Draco couldn’t, in fact, interpret his gestures and facial reactions, Draco frequently proved him wrong. It was a bit of a cat and mouse game between them, one Harry was sure they were both aware they played with each other but were careful to never address in an actual conversation.
It had been years since he’d last had such vivid memories of the man. Getting a handle on them, and controlling the wild emotions connected to those horrid memories, had required months of therapy, religious self-care, and a strict exercise regimen to build up his resilience. Somehow, punching a sandbag until his knuckles hurt and running laps in the park until his sides burnt had helped to rehabilitate his mind.
He wrapped his arms around Scorpius and enveloped him in a tight hug, holding him close until Scorpius struggled against him and wriggled out of his embrace, looking anything but pleased. Draco bit the inside of his mouth to stop himself from smirking. He figured he had another two years at the most, quite possibly less than that, before Scorpius would read him the riot act each time, he tried to be affectionate.
Malcolm nodded.
“He likes it, you know?”
Draco wanted to object to that, but since it would be a lie, he kept silent and snuggled back into Harry’s embrace.
Potter stomped his feet.
He sounded slightly breathless, and smirking, Harry slipped into his coat and wrapped his scarf around his neck while watching Draco do the same.
Potter grinned.
As if on cue, Draco, having also managed to remove the mire, jumped off the slightly raised platform and advanced.
“You’re sexy when you’re rattled, Draco Malfoy,” he whispered.
“Harry Potter, I’ve come to tell you that the annual international MLE convention isn’t a playground for your foolish exit room games.”
“We all love you, Teddy.”
While flying back to the reserve, Harry hadn’t been able to resist the temptation to pull a few gravity-defying, heart-stopping Seeker stunts. Apparently, the fact that he was now the Director of the Auror Department had done nothing to impair his flying skills. He was just as apt as he’d always been.
Draco couldn’t help but laugh.
Draco moaned.
He tried to swallow, but that only seemed to make things ten times worse and reaching for his coffee, he hastily gulped down several sips of the hot liquid. Unfortunately, the temperature only increased the spice-fuelled burn in his mouth.
“Simply precious and all mine,” he whispered.
However, before he managed to walk off into the general direction of the men’s room, Caleb held him back.
While Harry never stopped Draco from saying what he wanted when he wanted, except for actual playtime, Charlie had an entirely different set of rules for Liam. The code of conduct, Liam had to follow, said he wasn’t allowed to speak out of turn unless Charlie had given him permission to do so, but apparently, he hadn’t quite managed to control his tongue.
Draco couldn’t help but chuckle softly at that comment.
Potter lifted his head out of Draco’s lap, looked at him and something in Potter’s eyes told Draco that he’d guessed correctly.
Harry grinned.
Draco heard Harry take a step forward, the soles of his boots ground against the cement flooring, and then Harry gently tapped the cane against his buttocks. It didn’t hurt, but too focused on what he knew that cane could do, for he’d seen enough pictures to put him off ever wanting to experience such a level of pain, Draco felt unable to relax even the smallest muscle.
He squeezed Draco a little tighter and reassured him quietly.
“Harry James Potter, please don’t turn into the infuriating idiot you were back at Hogwarts, OK? And don’t even think about giving me some ridiculous speech about how you should always keep it together and be strong and all that because you’re the Dominant in this D/s relationship. You’re human, and that makes you perfectly imperfect. I’m not mad that you found it impossible to let me in, or that you struggled to accept my submission when I offered it to you a few days ago. A bout of Dom drop is never going to make me respect you any less when we play. You are my Sir and showing me a bit of weakness isn’t going to stop me from wanting to fall at your feet when you give me
Draco breathed his response into the small space between them and chuckling softly, Harry kissed him deeply, claiming his mouth and lips in a way he knew would rob Draco of every single coherent thought he’d ever had.
