The first thing that hit Harry was the smell. It was exactly the same, that intense, synthetic lemon scent that his aunt preferred in her cleaning supplies. He hated it, and the scent memories that came with it reminded him of hot summer days spent scrubbing his aunt's floors, wiping down the bathroom, polishing the woodwork. The smell would coat Harry's hands and no amount of scrubbing would get it out. And then at night, in the cupboard, the smell would be so intense it'd burn his throat and eyes.
"Right." Draco had been there for the list of things to expect as Harry finished healing at home. Exhaustion, dizziness, loss of appetite, headaches. They would improve as the days passed, and Harry was home where he belonged, but Draco wouldn't fully relax until everything was back to normal. His stomach clenched at the thought, and he felt his chest tighten.
All of the eighth-years had received private dormitory rooms upon returning for school after the war. Immediately after the final battle, Harry would have loathed the silence this created, so used to the sounds of Ron and Hermione's presence after months in a tent. But the summer had been long and Harry had moved into Bill's old room at the Burrow, gradually becoming reaccustomed to a modicum of privacy.
Lyra's nightmares, however, seemed the most surprising. She woke several times that first week, crying, afraid that Harry and Draco had died, or been murdered, or had left her in some way. She didn't seem to remember these dreams in the light of day, but Draco noticed her seeking extra reassurance, crawling into one of their laps and snuggling more than usual. She followed them from room to room, cheerfully babbling about whatever was on her mind, always seeking their attention.
"Harry‚Äî"
Draco closed his eyes for a moment, his exhaustion beginning to catch up with him again after the excitement, Alex's slow breathing soothing Draco's frazzled nerves.
He must have looked confused, so she smiled indulgently and continued.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs nearly finished at Hogwarts. One term left and he‚Äôll be done and out in society. Surely you see that he‚Äôd do well to have a woman to help guide him. If your mother were still alive, perhaps‚Ä¶‚Äù
Lyra put her nose up into the air, pretending to look like Papa. "We will not. It's our hermitage."
She patted his hand. "We'll gather everything up and put it into storage for him when the Aurors are done with their investigation."
die and saved the fucking world?" She whirled on Teddy. "How about any of that? Because they didn't tell me any of that, and I got to sit through lectures on it with the entire room staring at me, knowing that was my dad."
of all those reasons," Dad said.
"He hated that house," Luna said quietly. "He never spoke of it, not really, but he hated it there."
sorry."
"Yeah, really," Draco said, smothering a chuckle. "Are you okay with this? It means you'll have to learn how to be a big sister, and Daddy and I will pay attention to Alex and you both, not just you."
Bathtime was next‚Äî "
; her name was Helen, he reminded himself‚Äîand Hermione sat with the Memory-Specialist Healer on the sofa in Draco and Harry's living room. Alex was across from them, cuddled in Draco's arms with Lyra sitting next to them, holding the boy's hand.
"Okay," Harry said finally, "let's just take it one step at a time. See if he'll stay here with me for a few minutes and you go talk to Hermione; find out if this is even possible."
"Right," Draco said, his voice dry. "Yes, the boy helped. His name is Alex. He gave us his memory of what happened so they could see the spell and come up with a counter-curse." Draco considered it, and the gratitude he felt towards the child flooded his stomach. "Without him, I'm not sure they would have been able to do it in time."
"How do you possibly have this many shoes? I've seen your closet at the Manor. There were not this many."
Harry froze, his belt undone and his hands on his waistband. "Business?" His eyes narrowed as his Auror mind connected the dots. "Alex?"
Lyra's mouth was opened into an O, then she closed it and nodded. Draco doubted she really understood, but it was enough for now. "Okay. I can help too. I can be like his big sister." She stopped short, then looked confused. "Where's Teddy? Can he help? He's a good big brother."
She wiped the tears from his face and crawled into his lap, wrapping her arms around his chest. "Daddy is always okay, right?"
His voice was quiet, and he used his special name for her, which really wasn't fair.
He stopped and looked around, his eyes narrowed.
"Is he at home, then?" she asked, her voice too cautious for a five-year-old.
Draco gave him a small smile, amused. "Well, you've had all the women doting on you already, it sounds like."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Harry wasn't the only one who could have told you about this. I'm sure he would have if you'd asked, but it probably never really seemed like the right time. It's been a long time since the war, and it's not as fresh in everyone's mind, you know?"
"You look like Daddy," Lyra pointed out. "Your hair is the same colour, and it's just as messy," she added with a giggle.
"You're right. I don't understand what it's like to have a family legacy. I wanted to help, but I didn't consider what that meant and I put you in an awkward position. I'm sorry." Harry's voice was so quiet, so earnest, that Draco didn't know what to say. This wasn't how this conversation was supposed to go.
"I know. Me neither. And there's still the legal shit to deal with."
The real perpetrators were buried just that morning, and no amount of revenge would ever touch them. Except, maybe, their son embracing the nephew they'd rejected. Draco closed the door to the cupboard and stepped back.
But he wasn't talking. He wasn't really doing anything, actually. When Draco had come home the previous evening, Harry hadn't showered and there'd been no sign that he'd eaten the entire day. He was sitting on the outdoor sofa and staring out at the river. Draco had been unable to coax him to eat much but had finally managed to get him to clean up and go to bed.
Updated later the same night to add: Chapter 8 finally let me finish it, and hang on to your hats, friends, because this story will be bumping to an M rating. Just a little teaser for you. üòâüòã
Draco's stomach growled loudly enough for them both to hear it. His face heated.
Draco's mind began to spin with that piece of information, trying to make sense of what he was hearing. "Really?" he whispered.
I said I'd post on Friday, but it's already Friday everywhere other than here in the Americas, and I have time tonight, so you're getting it a few hours early. Enjoy. üíõ
"Fleur and Vic are with him right now. He's still asleep, but he's doing much better today."
He flipped on the telly, hoping for enough of a distraction that he could stop thinking and just enjoy his meal. He hated when he was in this kind of mood.
Harry stopped at a light and glared at Draco. "It. Doesn't. Matter."
The darkness in my chest lightened just a little, and I felt able to take a deep breath for the first time in weeks.
Draco looked so excited at the idea that Harry couldn't bring himself to disappoint his friend. Besides, the idea of finding a bloke to flirt with did sound intriguing. "Fine, we'll go Saturday night, but I'm not going to get off in the loo with some stranger."
Still, almost twenty years later, it
He sighed, gathered his books, and forced himself to leave his room as he'd promised Hermione he'd do. She'd arranged a study group for their first night back to go over everyone's holiday homework, and she was counting on him to be there to help anyone who needed revision for Defence. Not to mention, he was stuck on his own Potions essay and sincerely hoped Draco or Hermione would be willing to help there.
Draco grabbed his mobile, kicking himself for not thinking of it sooner.
Blood rushed in his ears, blocking out Dudley's voice about the specifics of the accident. Petunia and Vernon were dead. What was he even supposed to do with that? What was he supposed to feel?
By a quarter till ten, Draco was ready to panic. Surely, Harry would come home. The fight was bad, but it wasn't something they couldn't work out. Draco looked at the food on the table, and the bile in his stomach burned. There was no way he could eat, so he removed the warming charms and slowly put the food away, put the cork back in the wine, and headed upstairs to his empty bedroom.
She stopped and raised an eyebrow, giving him the same look she gave Lyra when she was amused at some antic. "Why don't you go put him down for a nap and take one yourself. I'll have Lyra help me finish dinner down here, and then I have an activity for her to work on. It'll keep her busy while you boys rest."
Hermione's brow furrowed. "Shit," she muttered. She met his gaze. "We don't know where he is and sending a Patronus might make things worse. And honestly, if he can't respond, that won't help."
"Oh, God." I heard a long whine, as though an animal were in pain, and with detached interest, I realised the sound was coming from me.
Draco leaned forwards, straining to hear. "What was that?"
Lyra kept her hand wrapped around Alex's. "He can sleep on my bed."
Draco felt the sliver of hope that had begun to bloom slip away. "Then we're back to blindly searching."
It was true, he didn't think those things really mattered, so he hadn't ever really considered them as something he needed to discuss with his kids. He figured they'd ask about it if they were ever curious, and he'd answer them truthfully.
"You need to talk to him."
Harry considered, but shook his head. "None of that really matters, though. Especially my role in it. I'm just me."
"Please don't let this change things," Harry begged, his voice barely audible.
She finally found him in the garden, weeding the flower beds along the side of the house. "I've always wondered why you do this by hand," she said sitting down on the grass beside him.
But he couldn't do that. Harry, just Harry, wasn't what everyone expected, what everyone asked for. Harry didn't want to be an Auror. He wasn't sure what he wanted, but whatever it was, he wanted something peaceful, something quiet. And he certainly wasn't interested in settling down with a
"All right," the Healer said, standing up. "I think I have it." He looked down at the boy who had fallen asleep in Draco's arm. "He'll probably sleep for a while now. It's hard on a child so small."
"You have a lot of nerve coming here," she said, her eyes narrowed and her chin held high. "Though I suppose even a hellion like you may have eventually learned a bit of gratitude."
He went through the morning in an exhausted fog, like a hangover from the days of stress and upset. Getting the children moving, dressed, fed, was more than twice the work of doing it for just Lyra. Having babysat Hermione's kids often enough, it wasn't too far out of his comfort zone, but in his current state, it was almost more than he wanted to manage.
"Yes, Billywig, and so was I. I'm really tired."
He ran to the Floo in Harry's office, tossing in the powder and calling out the Floo address. "Hermione," he called out as soon as the flames turned green, sticking his head through the flames. "Hermione!"
"Hi," Draco said quietly. "I'm not going anywhere."
I suddenly felt guilty for not thinking of my godson at all that morning.
"Champagne!" Draco called out, truly happy for his cousin and the woman he'd grudgingly admit to being his friend.
"Draco," his mother interrupted his brooding as they took a break for tea. "What's bothering you?"
Draco could finally see it, the big picture. All the pieces that were Harry Potter. There were still some pieces around the edges that were a little blurry, but it was no longer incomplete.
Eventually, he pushed his soup away and sat back, but the door opened again. Hermione entered carrying the young boy from earlier. She approached the bed, pointing to Harry. "See, he's here. We're working hard to get him better."
My stomach growled. Loudly.
Harry shook his head and dropped his face into his palms, and Draco left him to think. If Harry wasn't going to talk to her tonight, he had a good idea who could.
"It was basically the history of Dad and the war. And his parents."
"Are you seriously quoting your Mind-healer while we stand naked in the shower?" Harry asked, wiping the last of the tears out of his face and reaching for the shampoo bottle. He was beginning to feel like a prune.
, does it?"
But not for Lyra. Everything had changed.
"Lyra," Teddy hissed, scowling.
Sighing, Draco pulled Harry into his arms. "It was always strange for me, coming home to the manor after being at school all year. You lose autonomy. At school, you're basically on your own, making your own decisions, even at eleven and twelve. And then you come home and suddenly your parents are there, watching and evaluating your every move. Don't you remember?"
Draco ignored the tears stinging his eyes and the rage flaming in his chest. "And he did the cleaning?"
"But‚Äî"
She swung her glance to Draco then dropped her eyes to their joined hands, and if it were possible, her lips drew even tighter. "Homosexual, are you? Well, that's unsurprising." She leaned forwards so no one else could hear her next words. "You never deserved what she gave you. I hope you learned to appreciate it."
He started laughing, which was exactly the reaction she was hoping for. "They can be pretty awesome, too."
Harry leant forwards, putting his hands on the table and dropping his head. "Please don't let this change anything between us."
But Harry was right, Draco could admit that privately. There was something special about doing this himself. Something magical about manually melding his life with Harry's. Because that's what this was, wasn't it? They weren't just moving in together. They were taking the final steps and merging their separate lives into one.
"Right," Draco said quietly. "And your room lacks any character because you don't have any preference there, either?"
It was perfect, and it was theirs. When Draco had asked Harry to move in with him, neither of them were eager to live in either Grimmauld Place or the manor. It was likely why Harry had initially seemed so nervous about the proposed venture. At least, that's what Draco hoped, because Harry couldn't possibly be nervous about moving in with Draco. Right?
"Yeah," Alex agreed. Draco ruffled the boy's hair and turned on the nightlight he'd brought in and placed on the nightstand before walking to the door. "Would you like me to leave the door opened or closed?"
Alex squeezed Lyra's hand tighter, but she just narrowed her eyes and gave the Healer the glare she'd learned from Draco. It was generally quite effective, but with Harry's green eyes and her light-blonde curls, it was almost scary.
get used to it."
"Draco, are you all right?"
She whirled on him. "My parents are fine because I was able to find them after the war and reverse it. And they had money, and I forged visas for them, and they were skilled professionals. My parents were fine because of
Draco woke hours later to the feeling of someone curled into his back. It wasn't a completely alien feeling, but when he cracked his eyes open, he could see Cat asleep on the windowsill, basking in the late afternoon light.
about that, Harry. They might find you a boyfriend instead."
"If you're sure." She stepped forwards and picked up the coin, then gasped. "It's warm."
"Draco," she said, sounding exhausted.
Draco nodded and pulled himself up from the bed, looking around the room one more time. "And Potter?"
Draco just shook his head. "We had a fight this morning, so I thought he was just not home yet since he was still angry. You know how he is."
Charlotte's face turned fully red, and Draco was satisfied. If the kids were going to snog in public places, even if Teddy
"I did it
Hermione closed her eyes for a moment, and when she opened them, she looked sad. "What have you told Lyra about the war?"
"Well, I mean, I didn't know I was going to Hogwarts, did I?" Harry muttered.
I finished the last chapters this week, and I'll be honest, I don't want to wait to post the rest. SO, stick around, because the rest of the story will be posted tomorrow afternoon my time. There's one more chapter and an epilogue. I hope you love it!
"But, I don't look like anyone else on the wall-rug," Alex said, thinking about his sister and how much she looked like the other Malfoys and like Daddy. He didn't look like any of them because he was different.
Right. It was time.
Harry put his belongings from the Christmas holidays away and looked around the room. It was nondescript, and Harry hadn't made any attempt to make it anything else. The only colour came from the furnishings that had been supplied and the soft blanket that Molly had made him draped across the foot of his bed. His favourite picture of his parents was in a frame next to his bed, now accompanied by a small framed portrait of Hedwig that Luna had painted and gifted to him for Christmas.
"You may, but you are to go to your room and think about your behaviour. I'll be up later and we're going to talk."
It'd begun with his alarm going off twenty minutes late and the shower running cold after only five minutes. It was then enhanced by Teddy throwing a tantrum while Harry was getting him ready for playschool. His godson simply
It was why he loved their flat so much, actually, with its large, floor to ceiling windows that brought in light and space, opening onto a veranda overlooking the river. And while Draco hadn't questioned Harry's insistence that they not cover the window with curtains, only lightweight sheers that wouldn't block the lights of the city, Harry wasn't foolish enough to believe that Draco hadn't known something more was going on.
How hard was it to just clean up after yourself as you went? Did he not care that this was something that ate at Harry? That Harry couldn't just let it sit there or he'd begin to hear Aunt Petunia's voice in his head, screaming at him to '
I'm sorry! I know, I know, so much angsty hurt-comfort, but bear with me, we'll pull out of it soon enough. But we got to meet Alex!
Hermione's face fell, and he suddenly knew why she was there.
"Teddy! I can't wait to tell him all about it." She jumped up and ran to get her coat. "Can we go now so you can talk to Alex? Please?"
"No, I know you
St Mungo's felt completely different than it had the night before. Healers swarmed the area and Aurors guarded the hallways, but they nodded Draco through to where he found a sea of redheads waiting.
"The boy." Harry smiled as Draco ran the comb through his thick, dark hair. "He was such a brave kid. He'd just witnessed that terrible scene, and then I was sick and I could tell he was scared, but he just held my hand and kept asking me to tell him stories." He closed his eyes and hummed. "It was my magic, wasn't it? It felt worse when I used it."
Harry took her hand and met her eyes. They radiated compassion and empathy, as though she understood what it must have taken him to be here. Or like she knew.
"He's at Hogwarts this year." My voice sounded normal, cheerful even, so that was good.
"Really," Grandmother answered before turning to his sister. "Now, I will overlook this running off this time since it was for such an important event, but Miss Lyra, next time I'll have our tea and cakes without you."
"Ron, darling, a Kneazle clearly has our Harry's tongue. Is his essay as bad as yours?"
okay?"
Andi nodded. "Whoever got him back here that quickly is a hero. It's doubtful he was able to trigger the Portkey himself."
‚ÄúPlease leave me out of this,‚Äù Scorpius complained.
feel guilty. It was
Harry grinned at the question, suddenly encouraged. "No."
I steeled myself and ploughed ahead. "I'm sorry for running out like that earlier today. I realised later that it must have seemed incredibly rude to Gathii, and with you guys getting back together like that, it had to have made things awkward. I'm really,
"If you need to leave or anything, just say the word."
And of course, there are lots of pictures of Alex with his new family. So many pictures. Daddy is always taking more. Papa says it's because Daddy's family didn't take pictures when he was little, so Daddy has to make up for lost time. Papa says weird stuff like that, but it makes Daddy happy, and Alex does like the pictures. He likes looking at how his dark hair kind of matches Daddy's just like Lyra's pale hair matches Papa's. He likes seeing how happy Daddy and Papa are when they're with him.
If you've already caught up with everything else, it's going to be a break for a while before I add any more. If there's something you'd like to see, a moment in Harry's and Draco's lives, an event, a scenario, drop it in the comments. I'm brainstorming next year's Christmas Advent story (that I'd love to do again and set in this universe), so your ideas might make their way in if it triggers other ideas I have in my notes. Thanks so much for reading!
They were all little pieces of the puzzle that made up the man he'd come to care for. The man he loved. And while there were still a few puzzle pieces missing, that was part of the fun ‚Äî trying to figure it all out and see the whole picture.
Nothing of importance.
"I really love you, you know. Even if you are heavy and cutting off the blood flow to my legs."
Draco rolled his eyes. "I don't know. Maybe start deciding on your own what you eat for dinner and stop letting Granger bully you into eating what she thinks you should eat."
And as much as Harry had been nervous about the endeavour, it was going better than he'd thought possible. It was nice merging their lives together: his parents' wedding photo on the shelf with Draco's books; Harry's antique snitch collection displayed next to Draco's silly collectable spoons; Draco's design aesthetic combined with Harry's preference for comfortable furniture. All of it miraculously seemed to work.
"I'll be back tonight. In the meantime, if you need me for anything, you'll call me? I'll keep my mobile close."
Harry grinned. "Okay." He seemed to dance a little in his chair.
Pansy looked down at Draco and reached out her hand. He took it. "How much of that did you hear?"
"Thanks, Zee. It's not your fault."
"Harry," Ginny said, and he could practically hear her eyes roll as he stared out the window, "if you would just tell them that we're not together anymore, they'd leave it alone."
Alex's head moved, and Draco assumed it must have been a nod because Hermione went to gather her things. "Wonderful. Andromeda is going to stay with Harry while we're gone. I noticed her at the door a moment ago, but she waited when she saw Alex was upset."
He stepped forwards, raising his left hand to sweep his dark blond hair off his forehead as he stretched out his right. "Harry."
‚ÄúLong enough for what, Father? To hook myself to some society lady and pretend to be in love? To marry again?‚Äù
"She does," Draco said, grinning. "I had a feeling you didn't even notice most of the time." His eyes dropped to Harry's chest. "Or, you could start with your clothes."
Harry's stomach sank and his knees felt weak. This was it. Panic flooded his body at the thought of Draco not loving him anymore. "You know me," he said, the words breathy as he gasped to find the air that had left him. "You
She reached for Alex, and Draco couldn't help himself. He turned away, tightening his arms. His mind began spinning with possibilities, Alex's sobs and shaking body reverberating through Draco's chest.
I got up and walked the streets of Montrose, too antsy to sit in one place any longer but not ready to go home.
Harry started to laugh, imagining the look on Lucius Malfoy's face. "Merlin, I wish I could have seen that."
Harry."
Dudley's voice was rough now. "They were killed in a car accident Thursday night. They both died at the scene."
"Right. Er, thank you."
Alex followed his sister down the dark hallway of the manor. He didn't like it very much up here, the portraits murmuring as he walked past. "We're gonna get in trouble, Lyra."
This was okay. I was going to be okay.
But here he was, comforting
"Fine. But I'm jealous."
, I'd love to share, thank you, Draco."
"No, it was sort of a business visit."
"Well, what is it?" He turned the fire down on the hob, gave another stir, and then went to the table to sit, his knees weak.
Harry ignored her because she was wrong, and he didn't have the energy to correct her again.
"I didn't
"Draco‚Äî"
"Well, yeah. I mean, Kreacher doesn't cook for me or anything. He cleans and all, but he doesn't really cook."
Alex didn't move, but his eyes were wide.
delicious, but it just didn't have that extra something that Harry's food had.
"I promised Dudley. I'll be fine."
"It had all started when I put Teddy on the train. If you'd asked me then, I'd have told you that's when the darkness set in again, when I realised that I was alone and that my future seemed bleak.
"Busy life of a Healer," he said, then gave a long yawn. "Anyway, school?"
It took her another two days to work herself up to it. She wasn't mad anymore, just confused and a little bit hurt, but she still tried to keep her distance, unsure what to say.
"Happy birthday," I whispered, and she pulled back, looking at me closely, her dark brown eyes searching.
"Look at me. Breathe with me. Match me."
"I want to make up for it, Draco. I want to apologise when he's ready. I want to be his family if he'll let me. I know I have a lot to make up for, but I want to try. For both of us."
Draco stopped in the doorway.
He'd almost forgotten the boy was there. When he'd come home from the hospital, Lyra had claimed most of Draco's attention while Molly had filled him in on everything, forced a bowl of soup into him, and then shooed him off to sleep. Alex had been sitting quietly in a corner of the sofa, watching the telly.
The voice was somewhat familiar, but Harry couldn't place it. "May I ask who's calling?"
And Draco could see it‚ÄîHarry, his magic eating away at his body, worrying about the small child he'd saved, telling him stories to keep him calm, giving him something to look forward to.
Draco pushed off from the table, coming towards me. "No."
"Lyra!" Dad called, and she saw Pa roll his eyes. He hated it when Dad shouted like that, and usually, their antics made her smile, but now they grated on her nerves because everyone was watching. She could feel their eyes on her and her family, just like her classmates' had been.
Harry's throat hurt. Draco wasn't going to make him talk about it all, he wasn't going to have to put this all into words and try to explain. No, Draco just understood.
"Tedious," he said, giving an exaggerated frown that made her giggle. "Are you still up for being one of my groomspeople?"
"About thirty minutes on each side of the memory of Harry's entrance. That should cover everything adequately, we think, without causing Alex to relive the event."
She crawled into his lap and wrapped herself around him, tucking her face into his neck. "I don't want anyone to hurt you," she said eventually, her sobs turning into little hiccoughs.
"Geez, let us get to the altar first, yeah?"
The room was dark, the only light filtering in through the drapes hanging over the floor-to-ceiling windows. Alex stood at the threshold, watching his sister run over to the windows and pulling back the heavy fabric.
. Draco gave in and flipped the chart open, placing his wand on the magically sealed medical record. He glanced down the page until the answer jumped out at him.
"I didn't tell you enough, and I'm sorry."
Finally, Lyra sat back and crossed her arms, glaring at Draco. "May I be excused?
"Harry brought him stew," Kreacher hissed, saying Harry's name like a curse word. "Kreacher brought him proper food. Roasted salmon and asparagus with a lemon-dill sauce."
"Draco?" Harry said, the question in his voice familiar. Draco didn't know how to answer; he just knew that he needed to think this through, that the entire situation wasn't sitting right with him.
"I realised later that morning that I'd fucked up. If nothing else, I could have at least heard you out and let you contribute ideas. It wasn't until days later that I really understood the bigger picture."
"Not what?"
"Yeah, you know, one of those little, smelly, crying things that looks like a mandrake?" Ron challenged, and Hermione slapped his knee.
, and while they'd all become close since Draco's return from France ‚Äî thanks to Neville and Pansy shacking up ‚Äî he wasn't sure he'd ever get used to the Weasley‚Ä¶crassness.
I didn't understand at the time why the idea made me so antsy, but I realise now it was fear. I was afraid to hope for something so entirely different than what I'd always known and expected from life. It sounded too good to be true, like a dream I hadn't even recalled I'd had, but it formed vividly in my mind when put into words. So I lashed out, knowing that Draco wouldn't walk away from me.
"Yeah, right. I'll probably breathe too loud," he muttered, standing up and taking his plate to the sink. He came back and put his arms around Harry. "Sorry, Dad."
"Don't panic yet. Being Department Head means I can get some answers. Now go to Teddy. I'll be there soon."
He shrugged and took a seat at the table. "Me neither."
She rolled her eyes. "Some things a big sister just knows, Dad." She paused and thought about Alex, his big brown eyes and sweet disposition. "I don't know if he's ready to know everything this summer, but you probably should tell him before his second year."
He stood and approached the stage as Draco's song grew to a close. Harry climbed up on the stage as Draco sang, "Fuck you," and the music ended.
Harry nodded.
"I'm he-ere!" Ginny chimed, bursting through the door with sacks of food that smelled amazing. She placed the bags into the centre of the table as everyone gathered around. "Oi! Vultures. Not even a word of thanks."
The Harry from a week ago would have used that risk to worry over, to fret and keep him from acting. He'd have decided that this would ruin everything and that it was better to keep what you had than to try for something more.
let that happen. This small child that just showed up in his life filled a little Alex-sized hole in their family that they hadn't known was there.
biography‚Äîwas, unfortunately, too full of actual facts. Facts about his childhood, about his adventures in school and dealing with Draco, and yes, facts about the final battle.
"Did Daddy save Teddy too?"
is here. Look!"
"He died, Teddy, and I didn't even know about it. All this time, I thought people only looked at us funny and paid attention because he's a hero. I mean, I've known that. Aurors are heroes, and he saved a lot of people, but like, that's not the same, is it?"
Draco closed his eyes and sighed. "I'm going to regret asking this," he mumbled, then continued. "Potter, what kind of music do you like?"
"Harry."
"Just each other," Draco said, feeling hope flare in his chest. He didn't know for sure if Harry still carried it‚ÄîDraco had stopped carrying his when Harry went off active duty‚Äîbut it'd been in Harry's wallet for years, and he was a little superstitious about things like that. Draco was willing to bet it was still there.
"No," he said slowly, confused. "I make my own plate of food."
"Started to‚Ä¶react, yes." He let out a nervous giggle and tried to cough to hide it. "More than I'd had without a good bit more work with girls."
So, as he dropped Lyra with Molly for her Grandma-and-cousin-sleepover, Draco put his plan into action.
He smiled and shook his head, not for the first time.
, sleeping on the small cot he'd conjured next to Harry's bed. He couldn't imagine what this child had been through in only twenty-four hours. Losing both his parents, seeing his uncle, someone he should have been able to trust, attacking his only family, must have been too much for the child to understand.
"He's okay now. He's going to be okay. We're going to go in there and reassure ourselves, and then you're going to go back and rest. When he wakes up later, he's going to be asking about you. The last he knew, you were hurt badly."
He closed his eyes, cursing himself. He'd done some horrible things during the war, not the least of which included an attack on her father. What must she think of him?
It surprised no one when we were officially partnered in our first years in the corps. For nearly two years, we worked cases side by side. We arrested dark wizards and suffered the drudgery of bureaucracy. We ate together, teased one another about dates, friends and media stories. And we probably would have continued like that, but then‚Äî
"No, they're not back yet," she said quietly. "The Aurors won't tell me more, but from what I can tell, no one knows anything. Teddy's training ended at three and the other trainees all left. There was no reason for him to be anywhere dangerous."
Why couldn't he breathe? What the hell was wrong with him? He wasn't the one injured? He wasn't the one who nearly died. He realised he was sweating, the rivulets tracing down his face, pouring from his neck.
Soft blond locks of hair framed Draco's face, making Harry's fingers itch to push them back. There was a promise in his old rival's grey eyes, and it was one Harry realised he wanted to claim. It was more than just the perfect arse, though that was definitely part of it. No, Harry wanted to see what made this new Malfoy tick. He wanted to hear how he got here to this adorable little shop in Belgravia.
"Yeah, Grandma Molly. Alex," Harry said, then taking a deep breath and keeping his eyes on Alex's, he continued, "we want to be your family. We want to be your Daddy and Papa, just like we're Lyra's Daddy and Papa. And Lyra wants to be your sister."
They fell into silence after that, and the guilt began to claw at Harry's stomach.
"Turn on the light."
He'd finally given in, shrank his own Cannons shirt, pulled it over Teddy's head, then rushed him out the door. Drop-off at the school resulted in more tears, because, of course, Harry had forgotten to pack Teddy's lunch and the poor child would have to eat the school provided lunch today ‚Äî a lunch Harry knew the boy would enjoy, but evidently wasn't good enough this time.
"And you don't think learning more about your actual role in the war, about all of our roles in it ‚Äî Draco's, mine, Ron's, hell, even Molly's ‚Äî would be a lot for a kid to take in?"
"He sounds odious from everything you've said."
"There's this Muggle pub in Glasgow that Pansy and I went to over the summer. They have this amazing entertainment that I think you'll like. It's a lot of fun, and we can open up the offer to whoever would like to join us. Maybe you can get Granger out of the castle for a while. I'm sure Pansy and Theo will be amenable, and Pansy will get Bones to come along."
"No, it's not," Teddy's voice rumbled under her ear.
I finished assembling the dinner and shoved it in the oven, then hit the room with a few cleaning spells.
"I have just the thing. I'll put it together. It'll just take a moment."
"After the trials, my parents just wanted to continue like none of it had happened. They were home on house arrest, of course, and while Mum can leave now, Father will be there for another two years, but still, you'd think it was business as usual from before this all started. The same routines, the same friends, and the same bloody expectations."
I also posted another story tonight outside this series. It's a one-shot with a Squib OC (no pairing), but there's a baby Harry involved, and I'm a little bit proud of it. It's called
The first thing that registered was the screaming. There was so. Much. Screaming.
"Hey," I finally said. "When did you get here? I thought you'd be out with Gathii."
Draco rolled his eyes. "I did. We can't force the issue, but I can punish her for being disrespectful. I won't let that slide."
"Yeah, baby. I think so. But he's asleep so his body can heal right now."
"How are you holding up?" she asked, her voice gentle, as though she were talking to someone on the edge. Which was probably close to the truth.
"Yeah, I get that." Dudley sniffled and his voice sounded thick. "I don't know what to do next. I mean, I know I have to take care of everything, but it's just me. My girlfriend is helping with the logistics of the funeral and stuff, but I just wish that I had someone else here who
So why did Draco's stomach churn at the idea of seeing what was in there? Why did he want to turn and run away from it? He wanted to take Harry home, tuck him into bed, and promise him he never needed to return to this hateful place.
Harry looked at Draco. Even after the day they'd spent together, the months of becoming friendly, it seemed strange that Draco would compliment him like that.
Fuck.
What did he say when you argued about it?
Draco froze. Wait. What?
"Tell Harry I know this is really shitty, but maybe he can come and be here with me for the funeral? And after, you know, here at the house?" His voice broke. "He's the only family I have left, and I don't want to do this alone."
Checking on Teddy, indeed. "Yes, well, he clearly still has all his teeth, so I suppose you did a good job of it. Do you mind if I talk with him for a bit?"
Potter's eyes brightened, but he looked back at the basket. "Are you sure?"
Do we really have to do this in a group chat? I thought you'd quit the flirting once you were actually together. It's sickening.
The morning sort of set the tone of Draco's entire day. He hated it when they fought,
"Okay," Pansy said, taking the catalogue from Susan, "here's where we're going to start. You're going to try things on and tell us what you like and why, and we're going to take notes and help you find more stuff like that. If you don't like it, just say so and we'll cross it off. The more input we give the catalogue, the more personalised it'll become until it's basically your own personal shopping guide."
"Whatever. So, I'm going to sing, even if it makes me a little nervous. And you're going to find someone to kiss, even though it makes
"This was good, you know."
Harry slammed his spoon down on the table. "And what if I'm not?"
"I need to talk to Harry."
"I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable," Harry continued, quieter now that Draco was paying close attention. "I was just trying to figure it out, and Dean said I should just ask you, but it didn't seem like something I could just come out with, you know? '
"Master Harry is tired from his long picture-taking trip. Tindles will make cheese toasties, just like he likes."
"I missed you," she muttered into his chest, the tight feeling in her chest finally relaxing. Merlin, she hadn't realised how much she needed him. Her big brother. She pulled back and dragged him into her room, shutting the door behind him.
Draco chuckled. "So does mine, idiot. Here." Draco cast a quick Breath-Freshening Charm on Harry, then one on himself. He smiled gently like he understood. "This doesn't change anything; either you're bent or you're not. This will just help you know one way or the other. If you don't like it, you'll know. If you do, then you can decide if it's worth it."
"You're going to sleep in here, then? Good choice," Draco said, trying to sound encouraging. "You know where Lyra and I are if you get scared."
I nodded, but he was holding something back. It made me nervous. I'd be happy for him and Gathii, but I really hoped he wasn't going to go into detail about their reunion.
And that was that. Things were back to normal and we stood, going back into the house to make our weekly Wednesday dinner together. It was a tradition we'd started back when we were partners, and it'd stayed around all these years since. He usually came to my house ‚Äî I'd had Teddy and it made more sense, and now it was just our habit ‚Äî but we took turns cooking.
"Hey!" He glared at her, but she got up and started cleaning up, putting her lunch things away, so he thought about what she'd said. The Breddings biography‚Äîthe
"Mum had it in her planner." It was Dudley, all right. Harry could tell now, though it'd been nearly three years since they'd spoken. Harry had gone to Mrs Figgs' to help her move, and Dudley had shown up. The conversation between them had been awkward, but not terrible. But they hadn't exchanged numbers or anything, and the idea that Petunia had Harry's number was a little‚Ä¶disconcerting.
"Harry," Draco greeted, a wide grin on his face as he drew out a chair between himself and Blaise. "Did you finish your Potions essay?"
"Which part?" Teddy said carefully, and dammit, that pissed her off. She was thirteen, not a baby, and people didn't have to be careful around her. Dad was killing freaking basilisks before
Don't forget to turn on the "Creator's Style"! üòò
Hermione only stared, and he felt the hairs on his neck prickle. "What?"
His ragged breathing was the only sound inside the carriage when finished, the others staring at him strangely. He felt his face heat and was grateful for the deep shadows of the late afternoon.
He ran a finger along Harry's cheekbone. It was tender and sad, and Harry had to look away before he saw the pity he was sure was hiding under the surface.
Draco's voice was quiet and cold, but he didn't remove his hand from Harry's. "So they were going to send Dudley somewhere private, but you were going to go to the local state school."
"You're an idiot."
"Better fucking not," Harry muttered.
He set the table, pouring them both a fresh glass of wine, and lit the candles in the special candlestick holders they'd bought together at that gallery last year. That evening was the night Draco felt like he'd got a peek into Harry's soul for the first time.
"Fine, whatever," Harry agreed, willing to say anything to make this conversation end. He turned to the room. "Do we need to do anything, then, before people arrive?"
"Evidently."
‚ÄúRight,‚Äù Draco said, making a concerted effort to step back, away from the other man. ‚ÄúWell, we most certainly have those potions you requested.‚Äù
Harry paused at the end of the hallway as it opened into the common room, taking in the noise and movement of his classmates. Everyone seemed to be gathered in groups around the large central table they'd made from the smaller workbenches last November. It had been the Hufflepuffs' idea, and he found he really liked it, allowing everyone to study together despite their houses.
Draco looked back to the crowd gathered in the cemetery, then he caught Dudley's eye across the distance. Dudley gave a slight nod of acknowledgement, and Draco squeezed Harry's hand again. "We can go. Maybe you can show me some of the places around Little Whinging."
"You love it."
"We're going to try for a baby," Hermione said a little bit later after the conversation had died down again.
"And how the hell am I supposed to know what it is I want?" Harry asked, his voice loud and incredulous. Draco made it all sound so fucking simple, but it
Harry closed his eyes. "No, I don't have a problem with them being happy. I just‚Ä¶don't understand how they're doing it."
"You're glaring," Draco whispered in his ear. "Do you want to step outside for a few minutes?"
It was too much. She was only thirteen, and as much as she liked to think that was grown up, she didn't think she was equipped to deal with this yet.
"Ice cream, Harry. What's your favourite ice cream?"
My best friends and a baby. This was‚Ä¶brilliant!
Harry nodded. "Yeah. Yeah, I want to ask him. I don't want him to feel like he has no choice in the situation."
He hesitated and ran his hand through his hair. In that moment, he looked like Harry and Draco's heart thawed just a little.
"Because you weren't ready," he said quietly, and I realised I must have spoken aloud. My face heated.
Sometimes he forgot that their daughter inherited more than just Harry's eyes.
He raised an eyebrow and glanced to the window seat where Lyra was eating a biscuit and playing with some blocks, her green eyes intent on the toys in front of her. "Nothing," he said quietly. "I'm just trying to work out some solutions. I'll need to research alternative farming methods, and maybe if we bring in a new steward, we can‚Äî"
"He'd only use it as a last resort," Draco managed, a numbness taking over his body. "He'd not use it otherwise, because he knows what it'd do to me."
"Oh, close your mouth. I can be nice when I want to."
Teddy smiled. "Likely not. It's a good class, though. McGonagall makes sure he doesn't show any of the crazy stuff he used to when Harry was in school."
Draco shook his head and swung his feet off the side of the bed. "I have to go. I have to be there. If he doesn't make it, and I wasn't there‚Äî"
Draco watched the room cheer, standing to show their appreciation. Merlin, he was proud of his husband.
"He did, but he wasn't in time to save Alex's mummy and daddy. He doesn't have any brothers or sisters or grandparents to be here with him right now, either, so Aunt Hermione and I are watching him until they can find someone."
Harry looked down at the bag under his desk and then back at Draco. "Good point. And Draco?"
What kind of sick mind did he have, anyway? What was wrong with him?
"I suppose I may have talked to Teddy and filled him in."
He was a beautiful child, and he'd been through so much. Draco wondered how much more he'd have to go through before he could start to heal. Would a family member he'd never met come to claim him? Or perhaps he'd become a ward of some well-meaning couple who'd come to care for him, but who might never accept him as their own.
"I can't. Not yet. I need a day or two to wrap my brain around it."
"Tell me you've heard from him," he demanded. "Gods, tell me you know where he is."
"You can, and I'll be right there with you."
Draco was home. Thank Merlin. He'd been worried about Harry that first night, but he'd seemed back to his normal self the next few times they'd texted or spoke so he'd probably simply been tired, just as he'd said. Draco was still anxious to see him, though. He'd been worried.
Several minutes later, after Dudley and Susanne had sat down in the front with a large, older woman with a pinched face and beady eyes, the vicar began. It was all more than Draco could take in, speaking about ashes and dust, so instead, Draco just watched Harry.
St Mungo's was busy, though not inordinately so. Healers and staff hurried about periodically, but there was a general calm to the Spell Damage Ward. Draco approached the private rooms near the end where he could see several Aurors milling about. Ron made his way to them as Draco veered towards Andromeda.
I shook my head. "No."
I watched the train pull out of the station and stood staring as the parents and younger siblings slowly turned and left the platform. He was gone, and I was alone. Again.
And if I was a little bit jealous and more than a little heart-sick, well, he didn't need to know that.
Draco turned his hand over and grasped her hand. "He's so lucky to have you."
"Yeah?"
"I did," she said, sounding irritated at the suggestion. "He even told me a secret."
He was starting to put the pieces together, and he didn't like the conclusion. "Hermione," he said, putting his hand on hers, seeing where her mind was going.
"I like stew better on the second day. It tastes better after it's had time to sit."
The next day, it was all I could think about, but in the solitude of my house, walking past Teddy's empty bedroom, I couldn't find the glee of the previous evening.
But as he'd learned countless times before, Harry hated talking about his feelings, no matter what Ginny and Luna seemed to think.
"What the hell is that supposed to mean?"
"Hey, what's wrong?" he asked, and she ignored the flash of guilt in her gut.
"And it's good. Have Luna illustrate it and send it to a publisher."
"Breathe," Luna said quietly, and she took his hand in hers, her cool fingers bringing him back to the moment. "You're enough as you are. Forget all that. Just be Harry."
"Sure of yourself, weren't you?" He tugged Harry's shirt up and over his head, eager to touch him after so long.
right to decide. He was the one who taught her that, after all.
be okay."
But Ginny was right. He and Harry needed to talk. Draco loved Harry. He didn't use the words often as they didn't come easy to him, but he did love the berk, and he was sure Harry knew it. It just felt like he was constantly dealing with something Draco didn't understand, like Harry was holding a piece of himself away from Draco, something just out of view.
And Draco remembered that too. When he'd heard about his father, he'd needed some space to cry and come to terms with it all, some time where he didn't feel like people were watching over him.
Harry's nose started to run, but he didn't realise he was crying until he tasted a tear. "Then what are you saying?" His chest was so tight. "Because I've had a bloody terrible day and none of this is making any sense."
Draco watched her walk away and felt strange as he considered her last words. He shrugged them off and followed Lyra's voice down the hallway.
"Draco," Harry argued, fully unwilling to kiss some random bloke in a dark corner.
a date."
We never seemed to run out of things to talk about. His work, my stories, mutual friends, politics, books‚Ä¶Ten years later and he was still interesting. When he wasn't pissing me off, anyway.
Hermione studied him a moment and then leaned in to give him a hug. "I have some Floo calls to make." She pulled back and straightened her back. "Go find your family."
Fine.
Draco let himself be drawn back into work, but his mind kept returning to Potter. To
"How's Hermione?" Harry asked when Draco finished. "That Obliviate‚Äî"
"Ron and Hermione are going to try for a baby," I said finally, still staring ahead.
The Chosen One. The Boy Who Lived. The Man Who Vanquished.
Alex nodded, then whispered, "My daddy." He paused and his eyes widened slightly and began darting around the room. "Uncle?"
The longer I considered, the more I could admit that the idea excited me. I still wasn't doing anything with my life other than raising Teddy, and it was boring when he was in school each morning. This was something small I could do to keep myself entertained, but I was sure nothing would come from it.
"But yesterday‚Ä¶"
Draco swallowed the lump in his throat. What the hell had Scorpius been thinking to come up with such a ridiculous, absolutely delicious, notion?
"Papa! Daddy!" Lyra cried between sobs. "I'm in trouble and Alex isn't, and it's not fair. He hit me first."
"Wait, Hermione? The sister who's on the streets?"
The tension fled from Harry's face and Draco knew he'd said the right thing. "When I'm ready," Harry agreed. "So how was work today?"
Draco picked up the phone and took it off speaker, watching Harry's blank eyes staring at something only he could see. "This is Draco, Harry's boyfriend. I think he needs some time to absorb this. I'm really sorry to hear about your parents. Is there anything we can do?"
Because these people they were studying? She didn't know them. Not like this.
"Stop," Draco said, and he hoped the plea in his voice didn't sound as much like a beg as it seemed.
Hermione gave him a crooked smile, but it didn't meet her eyes. "Yes, well, it
"She's right," Pansy agreed. "You were barely talking then. Shagging after club nights doesn't count as relationship time. Honestly, if you figure in the amount of time one or the other of you is faffing off on some trip, I wonder if you've even been together a full six months."
"Easy there. It's just a kiss," Draco murmured. "Are you ready?"
"No," Draco said, ruffling Alex's head. "And she doesn't hate Dad either. She's just confused."
"Oh, sod off," Ron said, laughing. "Oh, they're starting!"
"Just say it, Mother," he said after setting down his tea. He reached over to start cleaning up the parchments and ledger books.
"We'll go first." Draco tossed the powder into the fire, called out his destination, and then stepped through. Alex whimpered as they spun, but then it was over and Draco stepped out into the St Mungo's reception, which was blessedly empty of visitors. He gave Alex a little squeeze. "We're here. You can open your eyes and watch for Lyra."
"Tell Harry to send Lyra down before he joins you."
Well, no one ever said Draco didn't know when to take a hint ‚Äî ok, Pansy did, but nobody else ‚Äî so he tugged Harry's arm. "Let's sit down. I think you've had enough."
Draco's lips twitched in amusement. "Have you decided what you
Ron laughed. "There you go, Harry. They've already picked them out for you."
"Yeah, now," he said, but his voice was pleading. "Maybe we can drive around a little while before we go to the house. I'll text Dudley and tell him where we went."
When he was gone, Harry shook his head. "You didn't have to do that. He made this for you."
Teddy sucked in a breath. "But Harry has so much magic."
Draco chuckled. "And a sister and Teddy."
Draco managed to focus on the face that was suddenly inches in front of his own. Chocolate-brown eyes, bushy, brown hair. "Her‚Äî" he managed to get out.
The question of whether or not Draco wanted me in return didn't even register. It was irrelevant. He was back with Gathii who made him happy. I knew this; I'd seen it.
"Ha!" he laughed, his voice sharp and high. "Difficult."
"It was the first film Harry ever showed me. We watched it with Teddy." He sighed and felt his face flush at what he was about to admit, but he wanted her opinion. He really did. No one knew family like she did. "Molly, I told him he needed to butt out of some issues I'm having with the Manor, that it was a Malfoy family problem and didn't concern him."
, I promised that Alex had a story that I'd be writing later. It lovingly was called
She pulled away and stood, beginning to pace. "They had nothing, Draco. These two kids, barely more than teenagers, ended up in another country illegally and had no way of making an honest living." She ran a hand through her hair and let out a harsh laugh. "But they were
"I have a Silencing Charm up. They're watching Home Alone, and I can't stand to listen to it."
"Yeah, Draco. But I'll be back."
My only source of that laughter and love had just boarded his train and started the next stage of his life. It didn't matter that it meant I was starting the next stage of mine, and it was empty. Lonely.
"Well, fuck me. This isn't half bad, Harry." Draco took a quill and started to make a few corrections and notes, and Harry simply watched, trying to gather his wits.
Alex's eyes seemed to be staring into the distance, unfocused. "Alex," Draco said quietly. "Buddy, do you need me to carry you?"
Dad's smile fell, and it only pissed her off more. She would
"I have no idea what you mean," Harry lied, but he knew exactly what Dean meant. Harry wasn't intrigued by Pansy's or Theo's ability for happiness. He didn't know their lives; he didn't know what they were up against.
"No! If you weren't here, where would Pa be? And I wouldn't be here! Alex would be Merlin-knows-where, but not here, with us, with people who love him. And you'd be dead because‚Ä¶what? Because you're some bloody hero?"
"Yes, all right. Sorry." He cleared his throat and moved to perch on the edge of the coffee table, closer to Draco and the children. "Okay, Alex," the Healer said, his voice gentler now, "I just need you to close your eyes and lean your head back on Draco's shoulder. Listen to my voice."
Harry shrugged, feeling the vein in his temple starting to throb at the turn of the conversation. "Hermione and Ron always seem to know how I'm feeling, so I don't need to tell them. And everyone else, well, they have their own stuff to deal with, right?"
He sat in the window seat in the common room, his attention flickering between the dreary winter landscape outside the window and the animation of Draco Malfoy and their schoolmates playing Muggle cards by the fire. After about twenty minutes of it, the laughter spilling through the room, Draco caught Harry's gaze and cocked his head, staring. He leaned over and said something to the group, and they waved him away as he stood and walked to the doorway heading to the boys' dormitories. Stopping at the threshold, he turned to Harry and gave a slight nod, gesturing for Harry to follow.
I crawled across the sand, knocking my beer over, but I didn't care. I was going to be an uncle, and my best friends were going to have a baby, and this was amazing.
Draco closed his eyes, praying for patience. "You're being stupid."
Her eyes fell on Rose, who continued to chat, happy to be home for the summer, and she wished she could be more like her. Rose didn't seem phased by what they'd learned. It was all facts and 'so interesting' and 'maybe I can interview Mum about it over the summer for a project.' But maybe it was because her parents were still her parents, still simply war heroes that helped Dad in the war, and nothing had really changed for her.
was thirteen, but they were afraid to tell her about stuff? Screw that.
Harry, who was still in the hospital this time.
Draco closed his eyes, admitting defeat. "Fine." He sighed and looked at his husband. The colour had mostly returned to his face, and he looked well, but tired. "Lyra will want to see you."
Pansy snorted. "Pervert. Okay, Potter, stand up and let's get this moving. Find something here you like and use your wand."
"Thank you, Uncle Harry. I'm sorry I couldn't help you, but I'm glad the kid could." Teddy's voice was barely audible. He stared at Harry's vitals for a bit, then turned back to Draco. "They were the real heroes, you know."
"It's a Malfoy problem, Potter. Not a grandmother problem, or a mother-in-law problem, or an auntie problem. The manor is in debt, and it's my responsibility to figure it out. It has nothing to do with you, and I refuse to let you use the Potter vaults to bail it out. It's not. Your. Problem."
Harry's voice was gentle, but Alex leaned back into Draco's arms, sucking harder on his thumb and breathing quickly. Draco ran a hand through the dark curls, trying to comfort him. Merlin, this was hard.
Accidental magic. Hermione had said that Harry had taken a call with Teddy to follow up on some accidental magic, which meant that Alex had likely witnessed more than just Harry's attack, the child's magic flaring to protect himself, maybe.
He skimmed over Susan, Theo, Hannah, and Pansy huddled together over a parchment, arguing about something Harry couldn't hear. Hermione occasionally looked over and gave some input before turning back to her work with Dean and Padma as Padma demonstrated a spell. The huddles were repeated down the table, but Harry's eyes were drawn to the head of pale-blond hair, bobbing as its owner animatedly described something to Blaise, Ron, Seamus, Ernie, and Tracey Davis.
Harry let out a harsh laugh. "No. I came home and basically got locked in my room. But I remember Ron complaining about it."
See you on Thursday night with another update.
"The Healers say he'll need to remain unconscious for at least another day," Draco interrupted. "The damage was pretty extreme."
Draco stepped back from the bureau. "I can't look. Take it, please."
"Have you talked to anyone since the war?"
He snorted. "Yeah, that's what I told him."
Draco's mind swirled the information around in his head all through dinner. Every time he looked at Alex, he could only think of what Hermione had told him. He was simultaneously heartbroken for the boy and hopeful that he'd get the chance to raise this beautiful child. The hours until he could talk to Harry alone were agonising.
"Guess so. There are some apples and pears on top if you're hungry now." He looked back at the files on his desk. "Anyway, I think we need to question the neighbour again."
"You're allowed to grieve, you know."
It was wonderful.
It was like it always was these days, like that day when they'd returned from holidays. Harry couldn't help but follow like a piece of metal being pulled along by a magnet. Draco's presence pulled him in, and Harry was helpless against it.
Harry took a step back. It was too soon. He couldn't listen to this now. He had a whole day to get through. "No‚Äî"
Harry sat back in the armchair and made himself comfortable. It wasn't difficult. The chair was a good bit cosier than Harry's was.
"Can I make the light on a little brighter so you can see me?"
Draco sighed and stepped away, and Harry was thankful for the space. He slid to the floor, back to the kitchen cupboard, his eyes still closed.
Tindles set Harry's food on the table and smiled at him, then hurried down the hallway to the laundry to take care of his dirty clothing.
Harry's phone buzzed with an incoming text.
‚ÄúDraco?‚Äù
It was a Saturday morning when Harry's mobile rang from an unknown number. He and Draco were in bed, enjoying a lie-in. They didn't often have the opportunity to do this with both of their work schedules being as they were, so when they did, they chose to spend the time wrapped around one another, limbs intertwined, talking about nothing overly important. The sounds of the city and the docks outside their window were barely noticeable, and it was just them, tangled together in the mid-morning light.
