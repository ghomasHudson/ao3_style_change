Draco stacked his books high on the table in the far corner. Mostly used as a spot for snogging as the space was almost private, but Draco had started to use this table for his studies. There were no tables nearby and no one wanted to sit with him so he had blessed silence. A couple of students and couples walked by, but hurried away whenever they saw who had taken the table, but Draco had barely noticed any of them due to his work.
Draco stood, his head heavy, his knees sore. He glared at Montague, who just looked down at him. The two boys stood, Draco had to look up at Montague, but he didn't back down. Montague had identified him as a target, this wouldn't end unless he put Montague in his place.
Draco sighed, this really wasn't what he needed right now. Pansy was a shell of a person, hollowed out by fear and hot anger. Draco had hoped that she had fixed herself, somehow, plastered over her cracks enough to function.
The silencing spell was for quiet whispers across an enchanted mirror. A mirror to a better world than his, a path to Potter.
"Will you ask Dumbledore to keep you safe?" Potter held his hand tightly. "I've already asked, but he said you didn't want his help."
Umbridge continued to batter Potter. Who wasn't going to tell her anything. She was wasting her time. Potter was strong. "Perhaps an Unforgivable will loosen your tongue," Umbridge hissed.
Severus followed behind him as Draco broke into a run, students cleared the halls for them. Draco and Severus burst into the lavatory, a couple of boys proceeded to get piss on themselves.
The pair walked up to him, he was involved, there was no way around it now. "Draco," Theo pleaded, "Draco, please-"
Draco was being petty, he knew this, but he wanted to inconvenience Dumbledore. Let the man run around solving Draco's problems for once. Draco had been busting his ass and risking his life for this man, and for what? Yes, it was the right thing to do, but doing the right thing felt like swallowing glass. Let Dumbledore struggle for safety. Let Dumbledore feel the cold steel of paranoia. Let Dumbledore be the chess piece and not the player for a change.
"But if you feel this strongly about giving Ms. Greengrass a guiding hand, I'm sure your betrothal could be arranged," the Dark Lord allowed.
Would Potter still care for him when he discovers that he was a coward? Someone to bow at the knee to kiss the boot that would kick him in the teeth?
Draco continued to eat his breakfast. Daphne sat quietly beside him, reading the paper. His impending engagement didn't send any particular emotion through him. What did worry him was these expectations they have of him. What his Lord expected of him.
With a forced smile Draco noted, "Merlin, Potter, you're only observant when it's an inconvenience."
"Let me help you," he whispered. The words warmed his lips and felt like smooth apple cider  slipping down his throat to warm his ribs, his stomach and toes. He wanted to help Potter, he would allow himself to do this.
Umbridge instantly started to shake her head, "That Potter, speaking so horribly, as if our Ministry was just plain incompetent."
Severus's shock on his face was crystal clear. Draco turned to talk to Dumbledore, "What do you want?" Draco asked bluntly.
Draco made his way through the thick underbrush of the forest behind the Greengrass's manor. After the burial, Lucius had decided that their reputation would be helped if the Malfoy family stayed for the wake. He liked to be cruel. He didn't have any power in his own home.
Draco held the smoke against his lips, breathing in the heat into his chest before coughing harshly.
Potter looked as if he had been slapped. Draco took both of his hands in his, comforting him, "This isn’t because of anything you did, I just don’t think that I can teach you anymore."
He woke when the sun was setting a soft orange glow around the infirmary. Supper time was probably soon. The smell of a deep stew caused Draco's stomach to growl. He had missed lunch.
"She keeps everyone in line," Draco agreed. Patting his pockets for a cigarette box. He pulled out a smoke, lighting the tip with his wand.
"I was so scared I wasn't going to see you again," Potter explained. "I was terrified all summer that I would come back to school, and you wouldn't be there. And that would be it. That’s where we ended. I would never know what happened to you. And no one would know how you stood for what was right. And… you deserve better than that."
Potter shoved Draco awake, class was almost over and Professor Binns was explaining an assignment which Draco wasn't interested in. Draco stretched before putting away his things, including the Potions book. Class was dismissed. Before he left, Potter slid a folded piece of paper to Draco, leaving without another glance. Draco should wait to open the note, someone could see. And yet...
Draco sighed, "Anyone, even you," he pointed out to Severus, "would break after six hours of this nonstop."
“Yeah...yeah, okay.” Potter grabbed his cloak from the bench by the window. “It’s getting late, let’s get back to the castle.”
Potter pulled Draco closer to him, moving their clasped hands to rest on his chest as he absentmindedly moved his hand over Draco's forearm as he looked out the window.
Someone stepped into the entrance of the hall. Her blond hair seemed to shine in the sunlight shining through the large windows of the grand entrance. She was wearing pale blue robes, her long hair was flowing down past her shoulders. Pale skin was glowing.
Draco was pulled to his feet. Potter's hands pulled him up with almost bruising force. "Let's get out of here!" Potter ordered.
Draco turned back to his textbook, found in the restricted section, the large text explained different methods for learning Occlumency. Potter wasn't making enough progress, especially if Potter was having… thoughts about Draco. The fire Draco was playing with would burn him. He didn't like his current bets.
Potter was a problem solver. Whenever one of his friends were in trouble, he had to fix the problem. Draco needed to give Potter a problem to solve. "Nobody really likes me, Potter. Especially the older students, they think I'm a little shit," he explained.
No. Your family are traitors and the target is painted in blood. "Yeah, they should leave your family in peace," she was easy to lie to.
"Only for our sake," Draco continued to Umbridge's agreement. "I was hoping to apologize to you for my behavior last week, Professor," he started. "I was out of line, and I reflected badly onto you, I'm sorry," he apologized.
Daphne followed Draco to the far back table without being asked. She wanted to talk. The table was tucked in the corner next to the staircase towards the girl's dorms. The table was small, only enough room for two people with a squeeze, there were no other tables or bookshelves around the table, easily making the area private for gossiping.
"Dumbledore, of course, but he has always had his hands bloody in politics. He actually has the games keeper, the giant one that lives in the hut, teaching this year. How is a games keeper, one with no formal education, qualified to teach?"
She made to leave, but Draco couldn't let this further weigh on their relationship. Draco stopped her with a gentle hand on her wrist. "I think you're very brave," he complimented with the truth on his tongue. Daphne took his hand, with a squeeze, she left to the dormitories.
"Interrupting your instructor, means for detention, Potter. I will see you after dinner tonight and fifty points from Gryffindor."
"No what, Malfoy? Use the manners and eloquence your father as worked so hard to engrain into you, or are you too smart for him as well?" Severus chilled.
"And I-" His sobs choked him back from spilling his secrets. "I really hurt her before she died. She hated me." He wrapped his arms around himself as he finally had to feel the weight of his grief.
Her tears fell into brown hair as the pair stared at each other. She hated him with something that burned inside of her. He didn't know what he would do if this continued. Maybe some part of him didn't want this to end.
"Thanks for the help," Draco smiled as he grabbed the rest of his things. He didn’t turn around at Pansy's protest as he left the library for dinner.
Harry Potter was right. The Dark Lord did return that night, and left a wake of misery in his own celebration that continued-
Footsteps hurried towards the Great Hall, the pair turned the corner. Upon seeing Draco, both Theo and Blaise stopped, the breath gone from their lungs. Draco swallowed, taking in the disheveled appearance at the two, their shoulders were touching, they were standing so close. They were holding hands.
Perhaps the Dark Lord would make an example of what happens whenever you fail him and put an end to Draco's misery.
The air was pleasantly warm. The sky was bright blue, not a cloud to be seen. A perfect day for a funeral.
Draco could barely see Potter through the sea of black cloaks. Potter and his friends were circled by Death Eaters. All in dark cloaks and masks in the shape of sculls. Draco's stomach dropped when he saw his father's blond hair. He was still doing their Lord's bidding? His father had been so shaken after…after Draco had killed Daphne. Yet he stood tall, towering in front of Potter. He wasn't leaning on his cane, he must have taken a potion for mobility.
Draco's blood froze, they never talked freely in front of someone before. He blinked. Potter was talking to him, for the first time in weeks they could talk. "What?" Draco opened with.
Severus glared at Draco, he was waiting for an answer. Draco wanted to live through this class, so he kept his mouth shut and eyes down cast.
The tears stopped, but Potter didn't loosen his grip. He sniffed, laying his cheek on Draco shoulder, his face still wet. Draco's heart pounded in his chest, he couldn't steady his heart beat. He had done this to Potter. He had caused him to weep similar to when Potter had seen his friend killed. What sort of friend does that? How could Draco say he had Potter's best interest at heart only to turn around and make him weep?
Sweat started the collect on Draco's brow. He quietly adjusted his position from under the table. The voices became quiet, perhaps that had left? Draco hadn't heard the door open.
They arrived at the room, opening the door to the small room with a fireplace. Potter turned to him, before gently taking off the cloak over Draco's head. "Thanks," Draco greeted Potter with a smile.
Apparently Draco pisses off Severus by breathing these days. "No sir," he mumbled, knowing that he was going to lose whatever argument Severus thought they were having.
"Parkinson, don't spread unnecessary gossip, it's tacky," Draco ordered. Theo looked good. He had grown his hair out over the summer, he was freckled and sun-kissed from summer with the Zabini's in their holiday estate. Ms. Zabini had taken both the boys out of the country the second they stepped off the train for summer vacation. Ms. Zabini was a very intelligent woman.
The feeling of glass against skull reverberated up Draco's arms. The Dolohov snapped under the force of the globe. Glass cut into his hands as the prophecy was broken.
They walked in silence closely together. Draco gave the password for the Common Room, his voice gravely. They entered in heavy silence.
Draco excused himself from the table, leaving the hall. He could use this time to study, or sulk in peace. The halls were mostly empty, his footsteps the only sounds within the halls besides the occasional student.
The train sputtered to a gentle stop, the castle welcoming them. Their home in these troubled times. Draco watched as his companions filed out of the cart, carrying their luggage. Pansy reached out to him with her hand. Draco made an excuse, telling her he would meet them for dinner.
"That's a pretty big technicality," Draco couldn't stop the warmth that spread in his chest. Potter saw him for what he was, and he wasn't horrified by him. Potter didn't know he should be.
Daphne met his eyes. She was scared, they both were, but she was diving head first into icy depths with only Draco's word that she wouldn't drown.
Ice filled Draco's lungs. His words caught in his chest. He should lie, make her feel safe, but she wasn't safe. "He's terrifying," Draco finally confirmed, "He's like death himself."
"Nothing," Draco dismissed, Pansy shrugged, actually taking out her supplies to take notes for class. "How's Daphne? Is she mad at me for last night?" he asked.
Draco watched as Potter walked away from him. The weight was heavy on Potter's shoulders. What did Potter want from him? What did Draco want from Potter? He wanted Potter to be safe. That was it. Draco wanted Potter to be okay, and Draco knew Potter was safe over the summer.
Draco looked up at Severus, his tone of voice surprised him. Draco had never heard Severus beg before, or speak with such emotion.
The room was filled with towering shelves that seemed impossibly high. The room was dark except for globes lined up in perfect alinement on the shelves. The light swirled, contained, trapped in the glass.
A log broke in the fire, perhaps the room was trying to ensure Draco knew that he wasn't alone here.
Draco hummed in agreement, his head leaning against the window of the train. Outside there was snow, a generous blanket of white along the landscape. The sky was grey with heavy clouds. The glass allowed the harsh chill to seep into the compartment. The cold brushed against Draco's nose. He made no attempt to cast a warming spell. He let the cold grip his bones, maybe he could numb himself from the visit to his empty home.
No mail came for Daphne, but her sister Astoria received a message from the family owl. Pansy hadn't gotten an owl for weeks now, not that you could tell if you didn't pay close attention, but Draco was constantly observant.
He was tired. Sleep was evading him and every once in a while, he would wake up swearing his mark had burst into flames. He had even fallen asleep during his few hours alone with Potter. On nights like those, he would wake up with Potter stroking his hair.
“I don’t know, fucking Umbridge? Your friends? Crabbe, Goyle, I know you walk with Blaise in the halls sometimes?” he questioned.
Draco forced his jaw to unclench, but the meaning he still carried in his chest. Theo shifted beside him, sending a glare to Blaise who was standing on the opposite side of Draco. Blaise responded with a general shrug, which Theo gave an exaggerated glace toward Draco. Blaise made a vague humming noise in which Theo just sighed loudly at. Draco rolled his eyes, giving them both a glare for their lack of subtilty.
"What? Can't be seen with me because I'll hurt your name? Why? Did your father forbid it?" Potter taunted. Draco was frozen. This was too much. Potter knew him too well; he knew exactly where to hit. "Can't be seen with me because it'll hurt your father's job at the Ministry?"
"With your permission of course," Goyle covered for his mate, his eyes wide in barley covered panic.
Theo barked out in laugher, gripping his stomach and doubling over. "Oh, oh Merlin. That was bloody brilliant. Fuck," he wiped a stay tear from his eye.
"Giant spiders classify as, 'ok so long as they aren't trying to eat you'," Potter corrected in a very serious tone.
Potter cared for him. He hurt for him. What did Draco do to deserve this tender compassion? He was dark, and twisted, he hurt people. Potter could never know what Draco has done, what he would do. Potter could never find out how much of a monster Draco really was.
That silenced both boys, but the tension between them could be sliced with a knife. They continued walking down the stony path. Theo was right, with Potter dancing and yelling 'Voldemort' the students of the Death Eaters were only reminded of what exactly their situation was. The invisible pressure of their parents was pressing them into the floor.
Draco shallowed, his face hot, but not from shame. He nodded with a honest smile on his face. He opened his mouth before closing it quickly. He should stop while he was ahead.
"I don't," Draco stated dumbly. He was caught too off guard. Why was Lupin talking to him? After what he had done?
in his notes circling several times before remembering a similar object described in other textbook. He shuffled through the books, trying to recall which book he had read.
The cabinet continued to cause three problems for every single issue Draco was able to solve. He was able to untie one tangle of magic, only for the lines to tighten as the stress was readjusted. All this before he could even work on connecting to the sister cabinet at Borgin and Bureks. Hopefully connecting the cabinet would go much easier with the instructions Borgin had given him.
Draco's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a body walking towards him. The shape of a girl illuminated by a small blue light, Daphne, of all people. Her hand was outstretched to trace the castle walls with delicate fingers. She walked as if gliding, with the grace of a woman, not simply a girl. Her long blond hair trailed behind her, her eyes bright with a seriousness that Draco couldn't remember ever seeing in her despite knowing the girl for years now.
"Dobby," Potter answered his sight still on Draco's hand. "I suppose that's why he made your favorite." Draco finished eating, pushing his bowl away. Potter stood, bringing his chair over so that he could sit close to Draco, bringing his bookbag. "Let's fix up that hand," Potter explained.
The quite, dark dorm was easy to slip out of. Draco had changed into some casual robes. The dark blue ones that bring out his eyes.
Narcissa tensed when her son instantly pulled away from her touch. She didn't say anything. Instead, she took Draco's arm and with a step, they Apparated.
"Just tell me what's wrong? What is it? Nightmares? Your problems aren't that unique, I can help you," Draco proclaimed.
Draco’s heart turned heavy in his chest and dropped into his stomach. A cold sweat broke along his back. The usual noise of the students within the large hall faded away until there was just himself. Draco could feel his heart beat in his figure tips as he clenched his fist tightly.
Tears found their way into Draco's eyes at the feeling of Potter sobbing against him. Draco wouldn't let them spill. He took deep breaths, trying to calm himself down.
Draco tilted his head, daring Montague to make a move against him. He could handle Montague, but he didn't need the scavengers coming for his name. He would rip him to shreds if Montague stepped out of line. Montague noticed the silent threat, he turned around without another word, returning to the Great Hall.
Draco missed his old study partner. Theo was smart, in certain areas. In other areas, Theo was incredibly unhelpful.
"And, correct me if I am wrong, but didn't it take you two and a half years to master Occlumency? Even with a mentor?" Draco pointed out.
Draco didn’t stop walking, better to have a house elf retrieve his truck. The cold night air greeted him as he stepped off of the train. Fuck, where was everyone? He spent what felt like five minutes with Potter and they missed the fucking carriages to the castle?
"Snape, glad you're here. I can trust you to escort these boys back to the castle?" Tonks stepped out of the train followed by Potter.
Potter nodded, Draco hoped that this would be enough of an explanation for him. "Okay," Potter agreed, "okay, I can understand."
The library was quiet. He ran his hand along the spines of the leather books, just has he had done has a child.
There has to be a twist in someone's soul to torture their young son. To be the hand that teaches them what pain really is.
Potter bit his lip, looked down at his feet. "Um, sure. What's all this for?" he asked, motioning to the objects on the table.
The man instantly released Potter as the glass broke against him. The smell of blood suddenly in the air as the man was forced from his feet, his back hitting the shelves with a twisted snap. Glass broke against the Death Eater as glass globes continued their attack. Blood dripped from the opening of the bone white mask.
Eventually, he couldn't help the smile that appeared on his face. "Hey," he whispered, his eyes were still shut.
Draco watched as Potter looked down at his lips, heat coiled low in Draco's abdomen and along his spine. A breath escaped his lips. Gentle finger tips brushed against his jaw. He held his breath. Fingers travel from his jaw to his cheek.
He screamed when he hit the stone bricks. His leg snapped underneath him with a cracking sound. The smell of blistering flesh filled his nose and he tasted blood between his teeth.
"So you can remember my favorite candy but not that my socks have holes?" Potter teased after he opened the small gift, popping one of the chocolates into his mouth.
"You know why, Potter," his voice was quiet. He looked down at his hands, his shame cool on his neck.
What if Dobby didn't warn the Order in time? What if Draco was following Potter to his death? Would anyone miss him? Would his parents mourn his death? Would anyone mourn the death of a murderer? Would Daphne forgive him if he died so soon after her sacrifice?
Draco should wait for him, he wanted to see him. Make sure Potter was okay, that he wasn't angry at the outcome of their foolish game.
The grueling lessons with Severus were taking their toll. Draco himself was tired from the two nights a week he spent as an observer. He couldn't imagine how Potter must feel. Severus was a formidable, unforgiving teacher. Potter wouldn't back down, he wouldn’t ask for a break. The two would work into the late hours of the morning some nights.
Draco motioned to Blaise, who moved closer, causing Bulstrode to step farther back. They were close enough to whisper in private despite the crowd.
His muggle trainers were silent on the floor as he walked through the too long hallway. He was walking directly into a trap set by his father, he should be more careful. Here, standing in the middle of the hall, he was too open. Too vulnerable.
"Helping me watch my diet, what a mate," Draco spoke loudly, nearly yelling now. Maybe he could just yell this problem away.
There are very few happy memories that are burned into Draco's mind. Watching Severus Snape talk to a toilet is one of them. Watching the toilet bubble and produce a hand that gripped Severus's cloak with a tight grasp is the other. Severus falling onto his ass in shock is the third.
Draco puffed around his smoke. He took the moment to think about his next words. "Three people know about me and Potter. You," He leaned against the tree behind him. "Snape, and Dumbledore." Sirius ran a hand over his unshaved chin. "I just need to know if he can be trusted."
He woke up a bit past lunch. His body was slow to start moving, his back ached in protest. He ignored the pain, he had work to do.
Screaming, so much screaming. A mother screaming for her child, children screaming for their mother, hanging over their heads before a dreaded green light-
"Yes, what made you decide that I was qualified to teach Potter Occlumency?" Draco started weaving his trap.
His shoulder from the first attack hadn't healed correctly. Draco had spent an afternoon creating potions in case he needed anymore. He kept his face blank. "I needed to brush up on my skills, never know when that could come in handy."
He had to pull several other books for reference. Scribbling on his notes, trying to explain the text to himself. There was a headache settling at the base of his neck from the lack of sleep he had been getting.
Draco silently stood. His head begged for him to stop. His ear burned, smelling of burnt flesh and charred hair. His shoulder aching, his arm blistering and bleeding from the gash down his bicep.
That was a stupid question, of course he was in danger, he attracted  danger. Half the time he had caused the danger. Was he in any more danger that usual would be a better question.
"My condolences for your grief," Draco attempted to seem displeasingly polite. "I'll see you at school," he excused himself.
His mother turned to her husband, screaming at him, "Don’t you dare! You're the reason why our son just sliced a girl's throat in our home!"
Montague had known. Had known that Draco sneaks out during the night, but how? He was always careful. He hadn't known where, Montague would have used that information whenever Draco had him on his knees, but he still noticed. Who else noticed? Why didn't any of his dormmates say anything? Theo would have mentioned if he had known, wouldn't he? Blaise probably wouldn't have, this didn't concern him. But Crabbe and Goyal? If one of them found out the both found out, but they were more likely to be straightforward.
"You're such an insufferable git, Draco," Potter pointed out, splaying over the couch in front of the fireplace. The room was warm enough that lighting a fire would be unnecessary, so a lamp on a side table near Potter's head was on.
“Ok...let’s see...what is a place that would get you in the most trouble if you were found there?” Draco joked. “Hmm... the Forbidden Forest?”
Draco was only too pleased for a drought that had him sleeping until dinner. No dreams or pain met him while he rested.
Draco gave a sigh to appear relieved, "Thanks Potter, I didn't mean for you to have to keep things from your friends, this is a relief though, so thank you," Draco gave the thanks genuinely.
The halls were still sleepily quiet as his footsteps sounded against the bricks besides the gentle chatter of the paintings. When Draco arrived to the Great Hall, few students were sitting at their tables. Potter was nowhere to be seen, he was probably still asleep. Draco walked to the Slytherin table. The only students sitting there were Pansy and Daphne, deep in conversation. Draco thought about sitting somewhere else, but Daphne noticed his presence before he could decide.
His usual house owl not only dropped the usual Daily Profit, which Daphne grabbed before he could even look at the cross words, but also a letter from his mother. His jaw clenched. He hadn't received a letter in almost a month now.
"Yes, I remember a troll wearing a ridiculously pink dress tackling me off of my broom while I was flying," Draco smiled at the memory.
“We can talk freely now, but we only have a few moments,” Draco began, he walked toward the large sinks in the middle of the room, if for anything but for something to do, “anyone could try to come in here and notice the charm.”
When Potter said his name so sweetly, he couldn't help but to smile. "Please forgive me," he begged, still smiling.
Draco held her gaze steady, not backing down despite the warning. "I know," he confirmed, "I'm not asking for loyalty, I'm asking for help."
"But these mistakes aren't just a reflection of you." The hall stilled in the silence heavy with the meaning of their Lord's words. Their Lord titled his head, as if asking about the weather. "This is a reflection of the people who raise you on these ideals."
Draco knew this was an awful idea. When Potter bumped him in History of Magic, he had slipped a note into Draco's hand. The note had an awful rendition of Draco as a Professor, probably due to the lessons the pair had been sharing. Underneath the drawing, a scribbled note said 'Different time, same place. Meet me after the meeting.'
"The Greengrass family, what is going to happen to them?" Draco asked what was truly bothering him. He had to see what would happen when he told the truth.
"Malfoy, we are taking this matter very seriously. We cannot have students attacking each other in the halls."
In all honesty, Draco wanted to run. The instinct to run was one that twisted in his lower spine. Potter, with his trusting eyes and easy smiles, made him stay to help. Fuck the danger. Draco was willing to, stupidly, so painfully stupidly, help him. Help Potter. Go against his family. Go against his Lord.
Draco, however, could still feel his eyes droop, the Room could probably tell he needed sleep. Provided for him was a too comfortable couch and a lit fireplace that made the room toasty. Draco enjoyed how relax he was, not feeling this comfortable in a long time. He welcomed the sleep, letting the book fall onto his chest.
Finally, Severus allowed the class to collect the supplies needed for the potion they were brewing. Draco wasn't particularly looking forward to having Severus critic his every tiny step.
Draco pulled away, rising from the couch. His chest was hot with the closeness they just shared. He turned to Potter, raising his wand.
"And how do you suppose we do this?" Draco smiled back. The crowd of students milled around them, laughing and talking. Couples smiling at each other. Blushes on cheeks. Valentine's in hand. Draco and Daphne truly blended in, no one would be able to pick them out of this crowd. No one could tell that they had war in their hearts and they were ready to burn the world down.
The pair walked their way around the manor's grounds. Draco discussed his classes. The Dark Lord kept up with the conversation with genuine attention. Draco found himself talking more with his Lord than he had with anyone since his return to the manor. The Dark Lord asked him about Quidditch. He even admitted to never having played the sport himself.
Draco sighed, "I think eventually, we would have become friends. That, or we would have hated each other even more and destroyed the common room and cause poor Severus's blood pressure to rise to dangerous levels," he explained.
He wasn't to blame for seeing her in the stones of the castle where they had lived for the last five years. She had been here, warm and breathing, just a little over a week ago.
Potter nodded, biting his lip. When he didn't say anything more, Draco allowed himself to be dismissed, turning towards the exit.
Where was his textbook? His spine tickled as he rushed to find his book. When Draco didn't answer after Firenze repeated his name, his Professor just sighed. "Come see me after class," he was ordered.
Pansy walked by his side as he strode off. Everyone kept their heads down as he pasted the other students, afraid they would be next for Draco's verbal lashing. "That was gutting in the down square," Draco clarified to Pansy as the two walked away from a silent Montague. Students continued to avoid him, he didn't blame them, he was out for blood.
Daphne pulled away from Draco, putting her hand on his chest for support. "You want me to recruit Slytherin students for Potter's Army," she realized.
He couldn't make himself stop. This unique self-torture was what kept him sharp. Not forgetting her was the fire in his soul, but that light was fading fast.
"Are you saying you'll let me kill you?" Draco questioned back. He was so tired of these expectations.
There was no policy that prisoners couldn't write letters to their families in Azkaban. No one ever received letters though. At first Draco thought it was because the wardens wouldn't provide owls to the prisoners. In truth, Draco didn't think any of the prisoners could master the energy to write to their love ones while being fed on by Dementors. He had asked Farley for a favor and she provided.
"Um," Patil pursed her lips in thought, "well, a convoluted image could mean an unsure future. I'm not sure about the blood."
They stepped out into the potion's classroom. Quietly making their way to the large wooden doorway. Draco poked his head out, he doubted anyone would be on petrol at this hour, but he needed to be sure. When he knew the coast was clear he nodded to Potter. He stepped out of the classroom, the Slytherin common room wasn't too far from here and Potter would use his Invisibility Cloak to return to his common room.
He lift his knife and fork that had appeared suddenly in his hands. He reached into her ribcage, the blood pooled around her open body, warm liquid spilled onto his lap. He cut off a piece of her still beating heart as she wept.
The manor was smaller than the Malfoy's, white brick with large windows. A forest edged along the sides and back of the estate. The perfectly monitored lawn seemed to be struggling for control against the lush trees that crested the ends of the grass. Draco could see a happy family living here, raising their two, strong willed daughters here. They would have plenty of room to grow, to run and play in the large yard. He could perfectly picture Daphne leaning out of the window to have a cigarette.
Draco was dismissed shortly after, as were the other Slytherin students. Not without a firm word of course. The Quidditch team left Umbridge's classroom with the appropriate slump in their shoulders. No one said anything to Draco, which was just as well. The Gryffindors had to write more line than the Slytherins, Potter had been given double the lines than his teammates.
He hummed in agreement, not answering her original question. He scanned the students walking, looking for no one in particular.
Draco turned, his shoulders strong and his chin up. "Is he alright?" he asked, he had to know. A twist in his stomach warned him against finding out the answer, but he had to be sure.
Draco does his best to be graceful, but, being so wiry, he does not succeed, but he took the space next to the young, spunky girl. He allowed his knees to bend comfortably while wrapping his arms loosely around them to clasp his hands together, letting his knees drop against his arms. He tried to ignore the voice in the back of his mind, don't trust her, stupid, you don't even know her. What harm could come from talking? Let alone a small girl, who no one would believe if she did tell, right? Surely, no harm would come to Draco if he just talks to the girl.
"Someone needs to show you your place, Malfoy," Montague sneered, "walking around like you own the castle, when really you're nothing but a traitor to the pure blooded name." Montague moved closely into his space, trying to intimidate him.
"I'm only theorizing, you must understand this is not an exact reading, but I'm inclined to believe that the omen was in reference to a specific, traumatic event. In my experience, that is what causes the strongest reactions from omen fire."
Class dragged on. Draco had no idea what half of the swirly pictures meant. His was the only ash to actually come out of the fire. He didn't know if that was a bad thing or a horrible thing, but he suspected that an omen for death and blood on his hands wouldn't foretell a sunny day.
"That's enough," Dumbledore spoke before Draco could throw profanities. "He's told us what happened, let's leave it at that."
She would make slight glances at Draco while this conversation happened. The ridiculousness of it. The fucking irony. After, when they were alone with smoke in the air from their cigarettes, she would laugh. She would talk about what an idiot Draco was, for not being prepared for this exact situation. She would chide him and ridicule him.
Daphne was his friend, yet everything seemed to be tainted by this war. Their friendship would be smothered by the pressure.
His bookbag wasn't in the Great Hall. "Fuck," he muttered to himself in the almost darkness. He tried something else. Pulling out his wand, he chanted, "Accio, bookbag." Nothing. He sighed. Suddenly missing his homework.
It's hard not to, Draco didn't say. Instead, he waited for the cue to be allowed to sit, as all his social graces demanded.
Draco looked around, several people cast their eyes downwards or turned their heads completely. Everyone was giving the Slytherins a wide girth.
"I'm not your mate, prick," Finnigan dismissed Draco's olive branch. The class fell into a hush. Draco was known for going for the throat, an act of mercy was not his usual response. Draco frowned as casually as he could, keeping the sharpness out of his voice, "You've made that clear." Finnigan fumed, but Draco couldn't tell what had set him off in the first place, he had no clue about how to handle this.
Potter gave him a warm smile before pulling out the exact same box from his pocket, tossing the present to Draco. "You're kidding me," Draco caught the small box. Potter shook his head as he started to giggle. Laughter spreading to Draco as well whenever he opened the present to reveal the same box of chocolates he had gotten for Potter.
Numb acceptance was the only emotion he was met with. He was hollowed out. Whatever happened would happen, there was nothing he could do accept prepare for the worst.
“So I take it you don’t like Umbridge very much?” inquired Draco, clinging to what was left of the conversation before they separate at dinner.
"The audacity!" Umbridge gasped, her pink nails touching her pink lips as she covered her mouth in shock.
There was no celebrations over the winter break with the cold stones of the Malfoy Manor. There was no breakfast in the magically warmed gardens. No reading by the fire. No laughter of guest over glasses of wine and mead.
Mafalda was panicking, looking around, she pulled out her wand. She pointed the wand, before returning back to her swears. The cat brushed against her leg carelessly. She looked down at the cat, before pointing her wand at the creature. "Sorry," she whispered, before the orange cat was flung into the air and around the corner.
He exited out of the dungeons, entering into the main hallway. The hall was decorated with garland for the upcoming winter holidays. There was excitement in the chatter of the students as he entered the Great Hall, but the Slytherin table was quiet with tension. The holidays meant returning to the homes that were no longer their homes.
He walked to sit next to Daphne, who was looking at him over her copy of the paper. Crabbe and Goyle stopped their talking. Draco scanned the room. Everyone was looking at him, their glances ticked his neck.
Draco could only take a breath when she left him. His breaths coming out in painful gasps. He sank to the floor, leaning against the wall. He curled into himself, wrapping his arms around his knees and letting his head fall against them. Sobs clasped his chest.
Daphne dragged him to Dominic Maestro's Music Shop, a dingy loud space at the end of the block. Daphne investigated what Draco found out to be gramophones, which were placed on shelves lining the back wall. He investigated the shiny instruments lining the aisles while Daphne spoke to the store owner.
"Stop it," Theo growled, not looking up from his textbook. His study style was simply to re-read the chapters until something clicked. Nothing was clicking tonight.
"You're just at the age where romantic attractions are one of the few joys of being so young," Dumbledore shrugged. "I hope I'm not embarrassing you, but-" Dumbledore leaned in, lowering his voice to an almost whisper- "I would suspect that Severus would not be the most tactful at discussing these matters."
Potter gently stirred, opening his eyes, the realization of where he was showing shortly after. Potter smiled up at him, Draco's cheeks turned warm at the sight as he returned the gentle smile.
Weasley was already stomping towards Draco, his face was red, but his eyes were confident. He had left his bookbag on the floor next to Granger, who was yelling something Draco wasn't paying attention to. Potter was scampering after his friend, trying to talk him down, but Weasley wasn't listening to sense. Weasley looked pissed. Beyond pissed, he seemed furious, Draco was right now the focus of that furry.
Draco leaned into her, "Oh please, whatever someone tells you they tell me, everyone knows that," he hissed.
Draco couldn't find his mother's halo of white blond hair. He walked, passing by families of grinning faces. The cold seeped into his bones. He let the cold numb him.
Draco sat back down on the window seat. He ran the palms of his hands on his thighs. Eventually, he gave in, lighting the cigarette with a pale blue zippo lighter. Severus didn't look up from his untouched tea. Guilt was weighting so heavy on his shoulders. Draco was shit at comforting people, so he didn't try to bridge the gap between his own known detachment and Severus's shocked sorrow.
"How's that reading going? Good? Better get back to it then," Draco continued writing his essay. His essay that he had no one to proof read because Theo was only good at one subject.
Pack. Draco didn't let his face show any reflection of this information. "I'll be here, don't be a stranger," Draco put out his finished smoke.
He was a coward. He could never stop seeing Potter, not while he was wanted. That was the key, wasn't it? Potter was the one person who wanted him. Wanted to be with him. He wanted to spend time with Draco just to spend time together, not to scheme or manipulate him. And Draco was weak enough to need that. He was pathetic. This wouldn't end well for either of them. This would only lead to heartbreak, and Draco's would shatter.
"Unfortunately, I have a very clear understanding of the dangers I have put myself in," Draco argued, "and unlike you I have a family to protect, so there really isn't any meaning to demeaning me, Severus."
Potter's head snapped back in his chair. His hair wet with sweat against his forehead. Draco's stomach twisted as Potter struggled against the spell, clenching the arms of the wooden chair. He had to look away.
If only they could be the sort of couple that kisses each other goodnight and whisper sweet nothings to one another, but one of them was tar and the other was a dove.
Warmth blossomed in Draco's chest. He felt almost lighter. "It was a honor," Draco spoke the truth. He didn’t have to lie about this, not with Potter. He was always his favorite version of himself with Potter.
Draco threw his head back and laughed, Potter always made him feel lighter. "That's brilliant," he grinned, "you're brilliant," he whispered. Potter's smiled dropped as his eyes became heavy with a look Draco couldn't define. Potter stepped closer to him, Draco breath slowed as he took in the green of Potter's eyes.
He would kill him. Kill Draco's family first, make him watch, before slowly killing Draco. He wouldn't use the Killing Curse, too quick. The Dark Lord likes to play with his victims, enjoys the cruelty. Draco knew this from experience.
Draco stared at Potter. Potter opened his mouth, closed his mouth, looked down at his feet, shuffling. "I was worried about you," Potter mumbled.
Draco re-read the notes, he sat on a purple couch that had partially been buried under a mound of random objects. The smell of bubblegum emanated from something behind the couch, but Draco could find no reason to investigate. He wondered how many students in the many years at Hogwarts had found themselves hiding a secret in this room. Part of him was curious, so many stories could be find in the mountains of objects that towered around him. A stack of tossed away loved letters had almost manage to catch his eye. Long forgotten moments in the lives of teenagers. Had the Dark Lord ever hidden something in this room?
He should have known Potter would have been made a target by Umbridge, she hated him. He should have known. He should have thought of a better plan that didn't include getting Potter banned from Quidditch for life. Stupid. He should have thought ahead. Stupid. He was better than this, he had to be better than this.
Mr. Weasley raised his eyebrows at Mrs. Malfoy's attempt at small talk. She wasn't one for unnecessary niceties. "We aren’t, but the kids knew Daphne. They wanted to pay their respects," Mr. Weasley explained politely.
"No sir. I asked her on a date for Valentine's Day, I thought she would appreciate the gesture, but otherwise we didn't talk outside of classes," he explained.
Myrtle floated so she was next to him. "You're right, no one ever comes in here." Her eyes were that of a child, but her soul was years beyond her looks.
"What spells are you teaching?" This was stupid, he already had what he needed from Harry; silence. He should just let the situation stay here, safe.
Daphne motioned him over with a relaxed grin. Draco took his seat across for the tight pair sitting next to each other. "Good morning, Pansy, Daphne," he greeted, pouring himself an early cup of tea.
Potter, slumped in the weight of the war that hadn't started yet. Unsure of how to comfort a crying girl through his own grief. He had so much resting on his thin shoulders, Draco could release some of the pressure. He owned him that.
Draco leaned forward in his uncomfortable chair, resting his elbows on his knees, "He shoved me, so I punched him."
He wished he could just be angry with her. Anger was simple, clear, understandable if unpredictable. Anger didn't come close to enclosing the feelings he had for his mother.
"Don't be daft, Potter, you don't need to get me anything," Draco dismissed. He had figured Potter wouldn't get him anything.
"I hate that she lets him treat her like that," Daphne whispered as Pansy blushed at Montague's hand rising on her thigh. Draco kept his head down. Daphne slammed down her book at as Pansy squealed in deafening laughter.
He wants to keep a closer eye on you to make sure his grooming to going according to his plain. "I'm sure he has quiet the lesson plain created."
That was a lie. His dark mark was earned as a death sentence for his father's failures. They both knew it.
They traveled down the well walked path, following their fellow students. Draco hadn't slowed his pace as he normally would from prying ears. Instead, he ensured their conversation could be overheard on the path. Daphne took the hint, she always did, as they talked about their classes and friends. Perfectly innocent, and predictable, topics of conversation.
He was brushed aside by his parents. The betrothal ceremony would take place this evening in the Manor's grand hall. There was much to still plan.
The breath visibly was knocked from Theo's lungs. The sound made Blaise turn, his hand reaching out. Theo stumbled backwards away from the comforting touch.
Draco could feel his chin shake, she shouldn't have to do this. He clenched his jaw, playing the role of authority for her. "You not only brought shame to yourself, but to me and the entirety of your family," Pansy tensed, her knuckles white, "but that is your burden to bare. I accept your apology, everyone loses their temper sometimes Pansy, you shouldn't be so hard on yourself," Draco publicly pardoned, "but perhaps we should talk about this in private."
"I'm not going to fight for him, Malfoy, are you?" Daphne asked, apparently not affected by the situation.
Draco was thankful whenever he was able to be outside for his Care of Magical Creatures class, maybe the fresh air would rid him of Umbridge's scent that supposedly was still on him. The air was cool, fresh. Theo walked with him, not too close of course. Blaise met them outside of Hagrid's hut, he stood with them while Hagrid lectured about Thestrals.
He didn't have that power. He didn’t have the authority to decide who was granted mercy and who was left bleeding on the floor, who lives and who dies. Whose bodies were left to rest and whose final resting place was twisted into a foul tool. His parents greeted the hoist first. The tension between them straightened their spines and stoned their expressions. Draco thanked whatever god was looking down on him that Astoria wasn't there to face her sister's executioner.
Draco licked his teeth, "Am I fair to assume that the event will not be a pleasant one?" A heavy hand was laid on his shoulder. A dry laugh escaped his lips for he could stop, "Of course this would hap-" He snapped his mouth shut so hard his teeth clacked. He swallowed, looking down. Firenze only squeezed his shoulder. "May I be excused?" he croaked.
His face felt blotchy as he turned away from Potter to wipe his face of the tears that had managed to spill.
The sunrise was average, but to Draco, still holding Potter's hand, he knew he would always remember this moment.
Draco returned to his work with Bentley curled on his lap. The gentle purring of the animal warmed his heart as he continued with his research. The task almost soothing with his new company.
Draco turned on the faucet and he cupped the clear water in his hands, bringing the smooth liquid to his lips. He swallowed the cool liquid, though that did little to ease his harsh throat. When the water wasn’t enough, he leaned down to greedily drink from the steady stream of water itself.
Draco waited in the Room of Hidden Things for Potter, trying to think of a plan of how to handle him. The room had transformed itself into a simple one, with a burning fireplace in the center and two comfortable lounge chairs next to each other. A large book on Potions Theory, the same one he had recommended to Nott, lay on the small table with a lamp in between the two chairs. The deep red of the rug clashed with the rustic orange of the chairs, but the room seemed to be more for comfort than style. Draco definitely wasn’t complaining as he leaned comfortably against his chair pillow, an awful shade of purple. He tried his best not to allow his eyes to dip against his tiredness, to sink farther into the hideous pillow, but his thoughts started to wonder in the quiet, forcing him to remember what he desperately wanted to forget.
Draco watched as she left, there was a strength in her shoulders that proved to Draco that he would feel the wrath of her later. Bile rose to Draco's throat, why wouldn't he be better? He continued his way to breakfast, claws at his back.
"Pansy," Draco greeted. Pansy only smiled at him, empty. Students continued to file into the class, Potter and his shadows passed by without a glance in Draco's direction. When class started, Pansy opened her book to follow along with the Professor's dreary voice.
Draco opened his mouth to correct his godfather. He had been attacked by two students, ambushed, and he had managed to fight them off with a broken leg while his skin had been boiling under flames.
"What happened?" Potter whispered as he took his place next to Draco. Their bodies were pressed next to each other on one side. Potter was warm, as always, and his heart lightened a bit.
"Already? Potter, how did you use all of it so quickly? You do know that you're supposed to use the salve on your hand right? Not your entire body?"
“And I am sure to someone like you, anything seems to be worth your time, but, unfortunately for you, my time is not worth this conversation,” Draco said smoothly, enjoying the effect his remarks had on the boy in front of him, who clenched his jaw in aggravation.
"Betrothed? Married, betrothed? That hasn't happened since… oh my god," realization twisted his stomach painfully. He thought he was going to puke. The Dark Lord was always one for traditions, even those that had been long rejected.
He pulled out his wand, ignoring how Finnigan flinched, and used the same spell Blaise had used on him whenever Weasley had broken his nose. The nose set with an audible pop, several students flinched in sympathy of Finnigan's scream.
The cool grey ash floated above the warm fire before collecting in the center. Draco's hands started to sweat. Twisting into a ball, the ash changed from grey into a blood red, then to a deep black. The ball of ash only compressed tighter into a sphere, shaking with the force of compression. The air was trapped in Draco's lungs. He couldn't hear anything over his own heartbeat, pounding in his chest painfully.
Draco leaned against the wall. He wasn't sure how long he sat there, looking out to the cool garden. He was waiting for the shock to disappear, but he was just left with a shell of himself.
Draco didn't budge, didn't blink. He stayed still and silent. He wasn't going to bait Snape. He wasn't going to give him an inch out of sure stubbornness.
Draco mingled half-heartedly. No one wanted to talk to him. He just nursed his water as he made nice with anyone who would meet his eyes.
"Nothing's going on, I just don't want to talk to you," Theo supplied. Even though his words were harsh, Theo's face told a different story.
His hands were bleeding. Blood spilling into his and Potter's clasped hands, but Potter didn't let go of him. Draco shoved Potter out of the way of a spell. Their bodies hitting the ground, only to be yanked up again by a furious woman with pink hair.
"I know, that's what I'm telling you, I know all of this!" Potter let go of Draco's hand then. "I know that you didn’t have a choice to become a Death Eater, I know you couldn't talk to me over the summer, I know you are in a dangerous place right now… but…" Potter struggled for words.
A cruel laugh escaped Draco before he could be bothered with manners, "Are we going to pretend you care about my safety now, Headmaster? Let us not pretend. Plus, I couldn't kill you if I wanted to."
Draco pulled out the bag which held the salves out of his cloak. Potter had to step forward to accept them when Draco held them out for him to take.
Draco bit his lip. The light from the lamp above Potter's head made his eyes bright even from this distance. He wondered how they would look up close. How Potter's eyes would look if Draco was right above him, their bodies touching as he crawled on top of Potter. Their lips touching as Draco leaned down for a kiss.
“Fine,” Potter jabbed at Draco, before squaring his shoulders and moving to his bookbag on the floor. Draco watched dumbly as Potter finished calmly picked up his things, surprised that this actually worked. Potter straightened from his position on the floor, then turned and looked at Draco, who was still staring. Potter nodded and Draco turned away from his cold look and hurried away, his breath quickening. He walked quickly through the bricked halls of the school, late for his next class. He turned the corner and could swear he felt eyes ranking his back as footsteps behind him became loud.
"Well, thank Merlin you weren't," Draco teased, not truly surprised. Potter always did have a streak in him that was a Slytherin, that one of the reasons why pissing Potter off was always so much fun.
"You took too long, did something happened?" Potter asked, sitting up and drawing his knees to him on the couch.
The plate from Draco's hands suddenly disappeared as Daphne shoved his entire meal into Pansy's face, Astoria holding Pansy by the tie to make sure the plate was well shoved, shutting Pansy up for once. Draco gasped in mourning of his lost meal as the entire hall started cheering.
"You didn't put me through this," Draco insisted, "I would have had this mark on my arm with or without you."
"Step forward, my girl," their Lord ordered. Daphne stepped forward, her head down, her hands clasped delicately in front of her. She was the perfect sight of a young humble lady. Their Lord wasn't affected. "State your crimes."
"I would imagine so," Mrs. Zabini stated. Her hand hadn't moved from Draco shoulder. Her gaze held Draco's steadily. She squeezed his shoulder, her lips pinched slightly together. She wanted to tell him something.
Draco hurried across the circular room. He was swimming through light. It still wasn't too late for him to turn back-
Draco grabbed Potter by his shoulder to force him into the only seat next to him. The very same seat Draco had just kicked him out of. Potter looked confused, turning to see what would cause such a reaction from Malfoy. Pansy was standing uncomfortably close to Potter.
Draco didn't stay to stop whatever Daphne was going to do to Theo. Instead, he continued his way to Professor Umbridge's classroom. The pair of them had a continuous early morning tea arrangement, an arrangement in the sense that whenever she asks for Draco's presence he showed. He did have her ear, though, which was imperative to staying updated in the news of both the Ministry and Hogwarts. No one else was going to tell him, despite his mother's insistent attitude on making sure he is well prepared.
A hard pinch on his cheek forced his attention forward. His Aunt Bellatrix sneered in his face, her breath on him. "Go say 'Hi!' to your friends," she hissed with a grin from ear to ear.
"I don't start fights, but I will finish one," Draco disagreed. The last thing the Slytherins needed was more attention. Daphne snorted loudly next to him. Astoria hushed her quickly.
Potter slumped onto the bench in front the window with a bit too much force. The bench creaked loudly in protest of the weight.
"Oh, so many things. I am very concerned for the education here at Hogwarts. I only wished that I had less obstacles so that I could properly modify what I see fit," Umbridge told him.
They had been studying for hours now in the Common Room, most of the other students having gone to bed hours ago. A couple of groups of students were around the common room. Blaise and Bulstrode were sitting together on the opposite side of the large, well-lit, room. Blaise looked just as tired as the rest of them - he probably wasn't getting much sleep. Draco didn't know Bulstrode enough to make any observations on the girl.
"I like to know that you're here, waiting," Potter's dark completion didn't allow for him to blush, but Draco knew him well enough to know that Potter's ears were warming.
"Perhaps you were pressured to be liked by your peers? Or perhaps you were swept away by the romance of sneaking around school grounds. Or perhaps you just truly did not understand the weight of your actions," he thought of random excuses. Daphne nodded, her head still lowered. "I'm inclined to believe you, my dear. Believe that this was just one little mishap."
He shoved the Profit into her chest, his frustration in the motion. "Don't do that again," he growled.
The boy sighed, pulling out a large hand full of brightly wrapped, small, round candies. Draco took them, putting them in his robe pocket, "what are they for?" he asked.
Draco heart nearly stopped in his chest. "Potter?" he choked to Dumbledore's all too knowing look and Severus's loud sigh that echoed throughout the room. "Oh, no, we're, I mean he's incredible, but we're…" Draco swallowed, thinking of the almost kiss that could have been just last night. "We're just friends," he shuddered, his face turning so red that he was sure everyone in the room could tell that he was lying. Badly. Oh he was lying so badly. Draco closed his eyes for a second, gathering his patience. "Actually, I was hoping I could talk about him with you two."
Draco finally managed to focus on his homework as the talk died to a whisper between Montague and Pansy. The only interruption was the occasional giggle from Pansy as Montague started nosing her neck.
"Can you believe Stan Stunpike was arrested for being a Death Eater?" Draco overheard a couple of students whispering in the halls.
"Yes?" Draco whispered. Potter didn't answer. "What, do you want a goodnight kiss?" Draco suggested. He should rip his tongue out. At Potter's playful expression, he covered his blushing face in his hands. "I'm tired," he insisted, "and stupid. Ignore me."
"Did you get into a fight because of the stupid interview?" Potter clarified, now drying Draco's hand.
Draco slipped into bed, under the heavy covers. He closed the curtains around his bed, wishing his dormmates goodnight. He placed the charm upon the curtains. He laid down, wishing for silent thoughts and simple dreams. He thought of his plan, how he was going to handle Pansy. Daphne and his engagement would happened in a little over a week. Would she grow to hate him after? Would their friendship twist into something cruel and hateful? Would Theo even survive the winter break? Or would he snap under the pressure of his father?
He kept a much more careful eye out while he walked to dinner. He doubt his continued paranoia was needed, but he had created a number of bad habits in order to protect himself. Astoria caught his eye before he was seen by any other Slytherins as he took careful glances in dark corners. "Can I talk to you?" Astoria asked, she made eye contact with him for the first time in weeks.
"So let me," Draco whispered. Potter nodded. Merlin, they were so close. Potter wasn't pulling away, if Draco just leaned in-
Potter's eyes got wide before glancing down. "I just wanted to makes sure you were okay, that was intense, in the hallway," he explained.
"Probably not, I just really hate those guys," Draco motioned to the Weasley Twins, who were both tackling Goyle.
Draco had honestly no clue what he had done to anger Severus to this degree. Draco was a star pupil, Severus was his mentor, his godfather. Whatever Draco had done, Severus had taken the offense personally. There was no way out of this unscathed. Draco was raised, however, by Lucius Malfoy. Draco had been taught self-preservation at a young age. For all his pride laced into his heart, Draco knew how to humble himself, even if the act left acid in his mouth. So, he lowered his eyes and didn't say anything.
"Yet, your father still tries to find young girls with tight asses to fuck. How does it feel to be in second place to your dad's cock? Your father would rather pay a girl to keep her mouth full of his cum than buy you new robes for school." Draco stepped into Montague's space, Montague wouldn't look up at him, his head lowered in embarrassment. Draco could whisper into his ear, he was so close. "Try to humiliate me again, and I'll point out to everyone that you father is also looking for a new assistant, preferably male." Montague nodded, tears on his face.
He bowed his head into the crook of his elbow, trying to protect himself against the overwhelming feeling. What could he do? What could his father, or anyone, do?
The air was warm outside, he let his shoulders drop. Daphne walked up to him. She had to look up at him now, he had grown. Her blond hair dancing lightly in the warm breeze. There was a longing in Draco, in his heart. A longing for a brighter future than the one he knew was coming. Darkness was circling them, one bright warm day in a town full of laughter wasn't going to fix that.
Potter was everything Draco wasn't. He was brave. He had seemingly meaningful relationships with his friends. He had more confidence in his pinky figure than Draco had in his entire body. This is why, Draco supposed, Potter had turned down the title of Prefect. Why would he need another title? "The boy Who Lived, Who was also a Prefect?" No. Potter didn't need more validation than defeating the Dark Lord as a child. While Draco's own accomplishments were few and far in between, Potter added another accomplishment to his already filled resume every year. Which is probably the reason why Potter turn down being a Prefect, not worth his effort or time. Bastard. Setting boundaries. Draco was probably mostly jealous of Potter's abilities to turn down titles. Jackass.
Gasping, struggling against the ropes that were wrapped around his arms, his neck. They were choking him, stealing the breath from out of his lungs. Snakes. Tightening their grip on him, crushing him. His ribs crack against the pressure, letting the snakes slide into his chest to swallow the heart in him. He thrashed against the tightening coils.
"You've ignored Potter in his time of grieving, are you sure you want to point fingers?" Draco lashed out.
"I will make a list, but don't be too upfront about your stance. Right now, we need to try and find students who can be trusted," he ordered. "You have more flexibility with your social circles, you're popular and not being as closely watch as I am. Keep it subtle, but find out who can be trusted," he concluded.
Lucius stood in the doorway of the dirty shack. His noise was wrinkled in disgust, his lips tight in anger.
Draco's lungs protested. His ribs stitched together tightly. His legs tightened. His head pounded. The rooms a blur as they just ran and ran. Potter's hand tight in his.
"Then you and I both know what this means for us, right? Or do I have to spell that out for you too?" Theo was almost yelling now.
Warmth spread from his nose to his forehead, easing the headache he didn't realized he had. Draco nodded in thanks before beginning his lunch.
He thought Blaise wasn't going to accept, how could he blame him? "Me too," Blaise supplied quietly.
A snort escaped Draco's noise before he could stop. The look Potter gave him caused laughter to be ripped from Draco's chest. Potter's shoulders shook as he asked, "Did you just snort?"
Potter turned his head as he looked out the window. His hand still on Draco's arm, as if he was reminding Draco that his skin was still his own, even if he was branded.
Pansy stared up at him, her eyes steady, not backing down. "You cruel son of a bitch," her voice was shaking, "I…I just…humiliated myself; for you. In front of everyone, and you… you have the audacity to be…" she stared to sob, shaking, backing away from Draco's cruelty. "How could you be so mean?" she whispered.
"Ten," Umbridge answered. Draco obliged her, pouring the tea with cream and ten, pink, sugars into her, pink, teacup before handing her the too sweet drink. He then poured himself his own cup, with one sugar.
The Greengrass family entered through the side entrance. The parents tightly clinging to their daughters. Astoria was already crying, her head bowed into a pale blue handkerchief. Daphne had her head bowed, dressed in her signature blue robes.
For as long as he could remember, Dobby was there. They would play hide and seek while his parents were preoccupied. Dobby would listen to Draco talk about school, Potter and his new broom.
Bellatrix walked away to stand next to his father on the other side of the throne. His father wouldn't look Draco in the eyes..
Draco had successfully ignored her, he was grateful for the distraction from their impending engagement. For the inevitable shred of their fragile friendship. This is why Draco hadn't said a word whenever Cho Chang herself invited Daphne to walk with her to class. Let Daphne have whatever rebel action she needed to before she was engaged.
Hundreds of globes attacked the Death Eater has Draco slammed the spell as hard as he could into flesh.
"Want one?" the man offered him a cigarette between two large fingers with long yellowed nails sharpened into a claw like shape.
But the whispers were everywhere. They were swimming in tiny voices, just barely too quiet make out words.
His eyes opened then, he needed to remember this moment. Keep this night sealed in his heart. Potter had his eyes closed, he was leaning into Draco, one hand on Draco's cheek, the other on his back.
He gripped the warming handle of the penknife, it’s weight heavy in the inner pocket of his robes. Draco stared out onto the bright empty ballroom. How many times had he walked though this hall? The place was the same, same walls, same furnishings, but his home had been gutted of any warmth. A warm hand rested on his shoulder, and his looked over to his mother's cool gaze. He was almost taller than her now. Her eyes were wide in concern, her lips in a tight line. Draco met her stare as she touched his face, forcing himself to endure the affection he knew he didn’t deserve. Her eyes narrowed; she had never seen her son look so cold.
"Because I don't know," Draco snapped. At Dumbledore's raised eyebrows, he responded, "He would have told me, he doesn't keep things from me."
Daphne sat next to him on the desk, laying her head on his shoulder. She put out her cigarette on the desk, not needing the routine.
The pair sat in silence as they nibbled on the cookies. Potter had snagged them from Longbottom, whose grandmother had sent them as she does once a month. Draco tried not to think about how his own mother hadn't sent a kind word his way despite being told of the attack that morning. He wouldn't have expected her to, not with where their relationship was, but his heart still felt the pang of pain.
The students within the halls began to thin as students hurried to their classes. Potter, being unpredictable for a change, actually attempted to calm himself by breathing in one deep breath with minimal eyeroll. Draco took this as a cue to further instigate with, “I can assure you, anything you have to say to me would only be worth my time if I was taking a shit while we conversed,”  he finished. Draco turned to walk to his class while Potter began to walk beside him, mumbling something under his breath about blond gits. Draco politely assumed Potter was talking about someone else.
Maybe he was finally getting the attention his parents tried to buy. Maybe he was glad to have power over people when he had none for so long.
"Yeah, his mother was a witch but his dad was a muggle- or has he been telling you lot he's pureblood?" Potter mocked. Draco could hear Potter's chin sticking out.
"This," Professor Firenze began, "is Omen Fire…"  Draco hated Divinations, tending to tune out. The centaur had replaced Professor Trelawney last week whenever Umbridge had fired her. This was their first lesson with him. Firenze stood behind a fire, lighting his tall stature and sharp features.
When Draco didn't say anything, his father stood. Draco noted how heavily his father rested on his cane, his knee was being troublesome.
"I didn't give you permission," Severus snapped whenever he released Potter of his mind, his hand resting on the desk next to him, his breathing shallowed.
"Charm? Draco how long has this been happening?" Blaise asked, concern written clearly across his features.
"I never asked for you a public shaming, Pansy, you did that to yourself," Draco couldn't be responsible for this. He couldn't take care of himself, how could he have this responsibility?
She stared at him. He stared at her. He should threaten her. Make her promise not to try this again. Make sure he was safe in this castle.
Pansy turned to him, furious. Draco stayed silent, letting her decide. Pansy sighed, pinching the bridge of her noise.
Draco watched her leave, he could probably hex her and get away with it. Potter caught his gaze, Draco's face heated, his stomach flipping inside out. Potter gave him a small smile before turning away to leave.
Draco hummed, a twitch of jealously within the excitement of earning Potter's trust. "She's very pretty." She also has a fuck ton of baggage, he didn't say.
The girl he had helped last week had to be from a Muggle family. He would know her, or of her, if she was from wizards. She was resilient, but probably also the person to be most abused by other Slytherin students. Mystery Girl was too vulnerable for his liking.
"It's not like you could have done something, so spare your pity," Draco defended himself from Severus's silence.
Potter was quiet after. His face uncharacteristically void of emotion. He was masking his feelings. Draco didn't say anything, instead he nibbled on his cookie. He didn't know how to make this easier for Potter.
Draco stood as Pansy turned red in her face and returned to their shared table, taking out her wand. He quickly turned to gather the ingredients, ignoring the heat that suddenly encompassed his back and neck as Pansy almost exploded the cauldron in heat from her spell.
He needed to calm down, he could snap at any minute. Daphne. Daphne would be at lunch, Draco couldn't let her see him like this. Not anymore. There were boundaries between them now that neither of them consented to. He excused himself from Pansy to the lavatory. She just gave him a brisk nod.
She had lit the lamps along the wall of the narrow basement with a flick of her wand. The basement was empty, a dirt floor, brick walls. One window near the ceiling, the glass was dirty. The moon light barely shown through.
Potter swallowed before nodding, "Yeah, we are, aren't we." Potter stepped away from Draco grasp, "I have to go, they'll be wondering where I'm at." Potter took slow steps backwards, his gaze never leaving Draco's.
Severus looked up from his paperwork. Glaring at Draco for interrupting his paperwork, before looking down to finish grading the report.
Theo let out a low whistle at the silence that followed. "Well, doesn't this remind me of home," he commented. "Before my mom died, of course."
"Would you like a lemon cake, young Malfoy?" the Headmaster asked as he produced desert on a small plate.
“I…don't want to bother her, Umbridge says there is no lesson if she heals us right after detention,” was the answer.
"If-" he stopped himself. He would have to be more careful with how casual he was with the Dark Lord. One mistake could offend his Lord. A deadly mistake.
Draco expected sobs, or tears, but none came, only the feeling of a chill. Draco could only stare at the grass and dirt as he waited for the shock to leave him as it had before in the presence of Daphne. He sat up, leaning against the castle as he looked out at nothing.
"Mr. Malfoy, I can assure you, that if you were in true need of protection, I would stop at no means to acquire that for you," Dumbledore declared.
Draco snapped out of the shock, pulling out his wand immediately. , "Flipendo!" Pansy was pushed of off Bulstrode by the spell. Draco ran over to the Bulstrode who was still on the floor, but when Pansy lunged at the pair again, "Depulso!" Draco casted. Pansy was pushed away with stronger force, her feet barely on the floor as she hit the wall with a painful gasp.
Draco swallowed, the outline of Daphne melted away to revealed the large body of a man smoking in the light of the open door. "It's Malfoy," he called out with a steady voice. He stepped into the light, finally able to see the face of the man.
Draco turned to see one of the Carrow twins, which one he had no clue. Her uniform perfectly in place, no button undone, her bow tie tight. Her hair straight and smooth down her back, held back by a green ribbon.
Draco started to list all of the steps for making Garroting Gas in his head. When he was finished with that, he moved on to Angle's Trumpet Drought then onto Moonseed Poison. He was in the middle of listing the ingredients for Jawbind Potion when he decided that the night was late enough to go the Room of Hidden Things.
Draco is met with the warm smell of grass, companied by a pleasant breeze the second he steps outside. Clouds engulf the sky with bright white, providing a plain backdrop to rest of the world, making the landscape look overtly bright with deep greens, similar to the color of the furniture in the Manor's. The contrasting greens play against each other; the lightness of the grass and the dark greens of the forest. The lake looks dark blue now, almost black, similar to the fountain water in the gardens at night when Draco would look at out his bedroom window which looked out onto the Manor's expansive gardens.
Bulstrode gave one kick into Montague's stomach, knocking the breath out of him. Blaise scurried away on his hands and knees. Crabbe grabbed his by the torso, pulling him back. Montague stood, but instead of going for Blaise he settled his glare on Daphne.
"But why?" Draco furthered investigated, "so Montague said some stupid shit, she never gets this pissed about it. She usually makes a comment about the cheap robes he's wearing and moves on."
Draco licked his teeth, steading Severus with a glare. "I thought we were waiting for Professor Dumbledore, sir," he drew out 'sir' so that the word meant 'arse.'
She looked up at him, "No need to be so forward," she stated clearly, glancing down just below his waist.
Draco flipped through his notes for tomorrow's Potions class. Soon, the winter holidays would be upon them. Draco would return to his home that wasn't a home. He would be promised to marry a girl who didn't love him. He would have to accept whatever situation he entered into at the manor.
Draco made his way to the Room of Hidden things. Perhaps Astoria sat with Daphne to comfort her? As a way to ensure Daphne behaves? Daphne had a temper, but she usually managed to keep to herself, even when she was furious. Perhaps Astoria knew that Daphne was barely containing her anger? Maybe Draco was under estimating Daphne's self-control. Under estimating Daphne was an incredibly dangerous thing to do.
He could turn back. Wait in the street like a Muggle for the danger to pass. He would blend right in, dressed in a simple long sleeve black shirt and jeans. Draco could just press the button. Ride the elevator back up. Get out. Leave. Never turn back.
Potter's eyes had deep circles under them. His checks were dry from crying. There was a set in his jaw now, of someone who lost someone dear. True, Potter lost his parents, but they had left a hole. A hole that had always been there, in Potter. Sirius had torn something in his soul.
He didn't deserve warmth. He was twisted. Whatever was gnarled in the Dark Lord's soul was also in Draco's.
Draco's jaw clenched, he had wanted to change the subject, not push Potter away completely. He would have to be very careful with his next few words. "It's just…" he started, his voice as calming as he could, "whenever you're, we're, here their doesn’t seem to be a problem."
"Do you remember that time where you pushed me off of my kiddy broom?" Draco asked, not bothering to look over at her.
Potter's hand was tight around his as he lead them into a small office off of the original room. Draco stood closely behind Potter. The sounds of Rabastan's screams ringing in his ears. With the hand that wasn't in Potter's, Draco clutched the back of Potter's shirt. Like he never did with his mother's skirts, vulnerable. He just needed for his hands to stop shaking. How was everyone so calm?
Daphne's lips tightened, she tossed the Profit down onto the first page. Draco's heart slammed into his stomach as he recognized the article from this morning.
"Don't any of you read the paper? Rita Skeeter practically destroyed Granger's reputation last year, that's why she can't get a boyfriend."
With a huff Daphne countered, "That's because he's been in Professor Snape's office all day, we're probably going to have a replay of Weasley breaking Draco's nose by the end of the night."
The Greengrass's greeted their guest in the foyer. The guest slowed in line to be greeted by the parents of the dead. To give their useless condolences to people who were experiencing the most painful sort of grief. Daphne's parent's wore all back. Her mother's hair was perfectly immaculate in the twisted bun at the base of her neck. She looked so much like the daughter. With a cigarette in her hand and in pale blue robes, Draco could have pretended that Daphne lived to adulthood. What would she have been like as a woman and not just a girl? Would the upcoming war have twisted her into someone cruel? Would she have learned to fight with more than just her words? Would she have torn her soul apart to win, to see the end, to live?
Draco had never had his father unable to meet his eyes before. "Keep your hands to yourself," Draco ordered before leaving.
"I have no idea what you're talking about sir," he stated. He wanted to hear Severus say how wrong he was to leave children alone in this war. He would make him say it. After all, would any of this have been necessary if someone reached out to the students? Would he have to marry at seventeen? Be engage at fifteen? Witness murder at fourteen?
Draco had ended up with a broken leg, three fractured ribs, a concussion and third degree burns on his back. Not bad for a day's work.
As he walked, a pair of furious brown eyes met his. Draco was quick to avoid the look of murder Susan Bones was sending him. Not that he blamed her.
He didn’t pull away when he was done weeping, enjoying Daphne's embrace. He waited until he was sure he had finished crying before separating from her. His face felt too warm when he pulled away, he was too tired to be embarrassed at his own outburst, but she just looked at him with kind eyes as she rubbed his shoulders. She stopped only to light another smoke with practiced hands.
Draco was almost out of the room when he felt a hand on his arm, stopping him. Severus pulled him in close to his face, "Did you push her?" he demined, but he already knew the answer. Severus knew the truth, he also knew the answer Draco would give him.
"Malfoy!" a gentle hand on his bicep stopped him, he turned to Potter. Potter stared into him, "same time, same place?" he prompted.
Draco just had to prepare himself for when this wasn't his reality, but only a lovely memory that he had to lock away.
He was trying to put Draco at ease.  “I cleared a spot where we can sit,” Potter motioned to the window. There was an almost sturdy wooden bench in front of the window. Potter had even managed to get most of the dust off.
"Very well Mrs. Patil, would anyone like to elaborate…" Professor Firenze lectured. What? What did everyone else see? Draco glanced at Potter, who met his eyes instantly. Potter had seen the Thestral as well. Draco shook his head slightly. Potter faced the front of the class as if nothing had transpired between them. Draco face the front of the class. Firenze caught his gaze, peering into Draco's eyes. Firenze had seen the Thestral too. "… that is the properties of transformed Omen Ash. Any questions?" Shit. Draco hadn't been paying attention. "No, who would like to go next?"
Draco nodded, he felt a coil wrap around his lungs and stomach. His head spun, he pressed his hands against the bricks of the floor, focusing on the cool texture as he tried to breath against the claws raking his back in panic. When he trusted himself to speak, "Blaise? Is he okay? Did I-"
"Yeah, she wants to know soon, too. To help with the shift of Headmasters and all," Draco explained. Theo was talking to him, but he wouldn't meet his gaze.
Draco observed the students around him as he let his breakfast cool. He didn't have much of an appetite these days. Laughter stilled around him as students avoided him. They could smell the death on him. The Slytherins had been recoiling around him. Fear leaked from the students that had watched Draco kill, that fear dripped into the Slytherin house and out to the rest of Hogwarts.
The castle felt different now. The warmth from the torches was colder. The halls didn't feel welcoming, but suffocating in their weight above the heads of children that had to grow up too fast. Draco tried to enjoy the welcoming ceremony for first years, but there was a lackluster from the Slytherin table that covered any attempted enthusiasm. Draco sat next to Pansy, across from Crabbe and Goyle.
Draco allowed himself to fold the paper before putting the note in his chest pocket. He rose, leaving the classroom after everyone else. Draco's stomach rumbled in hunger, he was ready for lunch. He walked down the now silent hallway.
His Lord sighed, "The Greengrass girl was responsible for her own actions. I'm to assume that if you had any notations of betrayal you would have found some way to alert me?"
"If I were to have used my wand, I would have finished you in three seconds," there wasn't a waiver in Draco's voice, he could have been talking about the weather with one of his Professors. "Remember that the next time you want to get cheeky."
He rose, he needed to rid himself of the coil of his plan. Pansy clenched his wrist as he walked pass, stopping him abruptly. She opened her mouth to say something.
Draco stared at Dumbledore. What did he get from knowing Draco's reasoning? What was he trying to gain? Or was there nothing for him to gain, but he wanted to confirm his assumptions about Draco? What would a man like Dumbledore assume about Draco Malfoy?
"She tripped," he stated with eerily calm, "She tripped, it was just an unfortunate accident, nothing more. When she wakes up, I'm sure that is what she will tell you." He stood, he needed to wash himself of today. "Now, if I'm not being accused of attempted murder in any official sense," Severus didn't meet his challenge, Dumbledore held his gaze, "then I am awfully tired, and will turn in early." Severus almost vibrated in anger, Dumbledore was still, but there was almost an impressed expression on his face. Draco didn't read anymore into it. He walked to the door, turning just before he opened it, "You'll make my excuses to the rest of the class, won't you, Professor?" he taunted Severus.
"You need to lighten up, Draco. You will lose your good looks if you keep frowning like that. Who would want to marry you then? I will let you know right now that I'm only marrying you for your looks," she formed her words almost as if they didn't taste like acid in her mouth.
Potter grinned back at him before Draco turned to leave, as he walked away, he sent a smile over his shoulder. Potter only smiled back at him.
Draco sat alone in the train cart. The sense of nostalgia was gone. He was too different of a person to want for his childhood. He was still a child himself. For the first time in his young life, Draco had walked alone to the train to Hogwarts.
Draco didn't press any further. And he didn't point out that Potter was the one that started talking in the first place, so it was really all his fault. He let the moment pass by as they walked in a familiar silence.
Draco turned back to Professor Binns, who was lecturing about the Giant Wars. Giant Wars, how interesting, he should pay attention.
"I can be better, just let me try," Potter's voice was shaking. Draco reached out, gently cupping Potter's cheek.
Dumbledore's lip turned up into a small smile, Severus rolled his eyes besides Draco. "Yes, Malfoy," Dumbledore clamed, "Harry is fine."
This could reintroduce the wizarding world into the idea of betrothing minors. She wasn't being forced to marry an old man twice her age. It would be presented as a mutual agreement between two families, the media could spin this into a fairy tale happy ending. Which is why a family not in the immediate control of the Dark Lord was chosen, the Greenglass family was well known throughout the Wizarding World.
"Oh," Draco felt his eyes itch, "thank you." He could feel his godfather's eyes studying him as he ate. A wall had gone up between them last year, now they had to discover how to talk over it.
Granger and Weasley stopped, looking back at Potter as if he just had grown a second head. Draco looked at Granger. She looked at Draco. He turned to Weasley. Weasley looked at him.
Cho pointedly skootched the chair away from Draco, leaning away as he walked. Not that Draco could blame her.
Draco ran out of the stall, through the lavatory and into the halls. His feet carried him as his lungs burned with the intensity of his running. He shoved students out of his way, ignoring the yells.
He froze, his head still in his hands. Potter was so close that he could feel his breath on his neck. A shiver ran through his spine. The arm around him tensed, Potter knew how he was reacting to his closeness. Draco waited for him to pull away, for the two of them to make jokes about whatever they would need to do to deescalate what was happening between them.
Draco studied the two older men. Both gave him steady looks. He put the pieces together. "Oh, I see now," Draco leaned his head back against the pillows. He looked up at the high ceiling as he answered, "you don't have to worry about me retaliating."
Potter nodded at them before leading the way. His wand raised cautiously as he walked out of the only other exit of the small office off of the time corridor.
"Stop…Merlin, you didn't do anything wrong, why would you think that?" Potter hushed, meeting Draco's eyes.
His hand was around her jaw. Daphne's back tensed as her jaw was gripped by Lucius, he brought her face to his, forcing her to balance on her toes.
"Well, someone has to make sure the Harry Potter has to follow some of the school rules," Draco teased.
The business of the Great Hall distracted Draco from his lack of sleep. The tiredness that now pressed into the back of his skull. He had to make sure to get some sleep tonight, he had to be prepared to help Potter. He had to be prepared to put their plan in action.
Draco took his favorite table under a window in the back, taking advantage of the unoccupied library due to the odd time of study. The thick leather books from Severus's personal collection had yet to be helpful. Draco was currently focusing on one particular, an in depth explanation of Dark Magic.
The meal changed in front of his eyes. Bowls filled with deep creamy stews that Dobby use to make appeared. Sandwiches that Dobby would make in secret for them to share after a long day of Draco playing outside filled a plate. Candies that his mother used to give him from the sweet jar in her personal study. The scones that his father would buy for him on his way home from work on Fridays stacked on a plate.
But he couldn't. The panic still rose in his chest, he was worthless to fight against it. He sobbed still, letting the tears come, his breath still short.
Draco left Astoria to sit alone when they arrived to breakfast. No reason to make the girl suffer more than she needed to. He never found out who was terrorizing the Greengrass family. After a couple of visits from him with the proper signs of courtship, they were left alone.
Draco wasn't surprised whenever he saw Astoria sitting with Blaise in the common room even in this late hour. The two had become quite the pair recently and tended to be seen together. Draco wondered if someone had clued in Blaise to Daphne's death. If Blaise did know, he was a much better liar than Draco had originally thought. Blaise gave Draco a polite nod as he left the common room. Astoria never looked up from her book.
Draco pointed his wand at the tank closest to the door. Potter cast a shield charm to protect them while Draco yelled, "
"This is above my pay grade," Draco mumbled, too tired to be bothered. He started making himself another plate, working around the distracted students before taking a seat next to Blaise. Blaise was sitting across from Bulstrode, at the far end of the table, separated from the other students. Bulstrode raised her eyebrows at him as he dug into his large pile of food.
Draco hadn't felt so light in weeks, death wasn't hanging from his robes. "You don't think about kissing, Potter?" Draco joked. He was buzzing with Potter's very presence.
"You're weak," Severus spat out, "weak and pathetic." Potter slumped forward in his chair, sweat plastering his shirt to his chest that was gasping for air. His hands were shaking on the armrest. When Potter didn't respond, Severus snapped, "Is this how you are going to face the Dark Lord? Trembling and weak?"
Draco followed her out of the Great Hall and into the connecting hallways, taking the Profit with him. He caught up with her easily, she wasn't trying to get away from him. Daphne's hair almost glowed with the sunlight peeking out from behind the usual clouds through the windows of the small hallway they found themselves in. Away from the eyes that had followed the both of them since they were forced into engagement. She turned to face him, her lips tight, stubborn.
Draco laid in his bed after everyone had left. Finally realizing that he was truly alone in the world.
This would be his last year in the castle, he knew this fact in his bones. He would either not make it to breath next year, or he would be clawed into his duties under his Lord.
Potter was kicking at the legs of Dolohov, who had him in around the neck. The globe forgotten on the floor, rolling towards Draco.
Lupin steadied him with knitted eyebrows. The sympathy and frustration so clear on his face. His expression was gentle against the deep scars in his skin. "Don't be a stranger," a warm hand patted Draco on the back, "And my offer still stands." Lupin shoved past Lucius harshly. Lucius didn't stumble, but he had to grip his cane with white knuckles.
Panic settled deep in his spine. Crawling upwards into the base of his skull. He needed to calm down. Pansy would agree with his story, whenever she gets better. If she gets better.
"Wait, please. I'm not judging you. I'm worried about you. You don't talk to me anymore," Daphne begged, her voice wet. Pansy just shook her head. Draco stopped her retreating to the dorms with a gentle hand on her arm. "Let me help you."
She inspected the small, pale blue object. "Why? Am I going to hate what your mother got me?" She opened the blue zippo lighter, the flame coming with a snap.
Daphne was his ally, she had more than proved herself, he shouldn't automatically try to plot against her. She would only lash out if she felt threatened, so he would make sure she was safe. But nothing was that simple, Draco couldn't protect himself, his father's influence was crumbling. If they were forced, if Daphne and Draco had no other choice, they would choose themselves. Simple.
"I just thought that perhaps, if you were raised as a muggle-" Draco stepped into the wand at his throat, using one pointed figure to gently push the wand over his shoulder instead of at his throat "-that we should handle this the way you filthy muggles do."
He swallowed, the bread tasted dry all of a sudden. "The stew is delicious," he commented. His hands felt sweaty, why was he nervous?
Severus stepped out from behind Dumbledore to loom over Draco, "We wouldn't be in the mess in the first place if you hadn't-"
He would have to ignore the bit where she would kill him if she had the chance, but the list of people who wanted him dead was going, so what was one more name?
The class settled into busy silence as everyone worked on the complicated potion. Pansy and Draco broke into their easy routine they had built from working together for so long.
"Really? Not even with that dagger strapped to your ribs?" Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. The fire reflecting against the glass of his readers, covering his eyes.
Could she be trusted if she lost the memory of Draco's involvement in saving her life? Without that memory, he was just the man who killed her sister. If she could plummet him with rocks knowing he saved her life, she might just kill him without that knowledge. Her hate for him ran deep, but her love for her parents ran deeper. He had to rely on the fact that she was a scared girl, who just wanted to protect her parents.
"And I brought new bandages, you need to wrap that tighter. But first use this potion on the wound," he lectured. He took the things out of his bag, but he couldn't dare look at Potter.
Draco knew how dangerous he was, what he would do. He had to take precautions, Daphne knew too much, about him, about how he feels. What exactly is he capable of.
"I wouldn't be here if someone did," Draco explained, jumping to his questions. "What's wrong? Why did we have to meet? Did you have a vision?"
Not that Dumbledore had to know about this portal. Not yet, anyway. If Dumbledore wanted to play his cards to his chest, then what was the problem of Draco having a card up his sleeve?
Mafalda ran away in the opposite direction. Someone was screaming over the screeching growls of the cat, a vibrant string of swears follows. Draco stayed where he was.
A rough shove to his chest dumped Draco's back against the seat. A wheeze of laughter forced a snort from Draco's chest.
Draco brought his attention back to the conversation in the cart. He was letting his guard down. Stupid. "Ah, yes, father is doing well," Draco responded to Crabbe's question.
Draco didn't keep up with the conversation as the world went by with the gentle sound of the train whirling by. He wasn't expected to continue conversation, he had nothing to prove. His peers were trying to prove themselves to him.
Other students filed into the classroom, each walking by the double desk Draco sat in. Word had already gotten around of the fight between the usually united Slytherins, and how Draco was the one who broke it up. Gossip about the event filled the air around Draco.
"Hey, um," Draco's usually slick tongue tied itself into a knot. How was he supposed to put into words everything? "I'm sorry that I couldn't warn you that Umbridge had found the DA."
The only sound in the small metal elevator was Draco's breathing. Sweat tickled the side of his temple as moisture collected at his hair line. He ran his tongue over his teeth. His mouth was so dry. Nails dug themselves in the back of his neck.
The Hall was filled by now, any student not eating by now was going to be late, or had to hurry. Draco scanned the Hall. Theo wasn't here yet, Draco could only guest who he was with, as Bulstrode was sitting alone and everyone in the dorm was at breakfast.
Potter released his knees to stand up fully, sweating as if just finished with Quidditch practice. His eyes burning with determination that Draco admired before nodding.
Sirius jumped in with, “It’s not like I have anyone to tell. You can’t blame him for wanting to talk about his boyfr-“
He blinked. The dog grew into a man. The man was wearing a long dark coat. Tattoos lined his chest and neck. Draco couldn't see his arms. Long black hair was tied back into a loose bun. Sirius Black.
Pain blistered into Draco's cheeks, his jaw. The snap of his neck sent Draco's center of balance buzzing. Blood slipped into Draco's mouth as he gasped deeply.
Draco waited outside of the Common Room. There was no torches lit and the darkness hugged close to Draco. Potter had slipped Draco a note during potions class asking to meet tonight. He was nervous, how was he supposed to talk to Potter after the night a couple of days ago?
Draco froze at the sight of Pansy so broken, he had never seen her cry from sadness before. She only cries when she's angry, Pansy's face had remained dry during her Father's funeral.
He tilted his head, his gaze never leaving Daphne's mother. She tightened her eyes slightly, Draco noticed her throat move with a swallow. He made her nervous. A simply polite smile crossed his face. Mr. Greengrass laid a hand on his wife's shoulder. They were scared of him. "Unfortunately, my involvement with your family is far from over. Let us make sure to be civil, yes?" he spoke in the same tone of voice that his mother had disowned him with. Cold. Piercing. Deadly.
"Potter, we were just arguing not two minutes ago. I wouldn't say I'm the easiest person to talk to," Draco teased.
"Draco," Theo called after him. Draco stopped, turning back to his friends, wishing they lived in a world where he could be happy for them. Wishing they lived in a world where this wouldn't get them killed.
Draco tried a different approach. Uncrossing his legs, he allowed his elbows to rest against his knees as he leaned forward, "I'm not trying to be difficult, Potter, I just need to know how this information could get out. I need to watch my own back," he confided, allowing his voice and face to soften, appearing vulnerable.
Potter tilted his head as he grinned, "I'm going to need you to write that down." Potter dug through his pockets before pulling out an half eaten bar of chocolate. He broke the bar in half, handing the larger piece to Draco. Draco took the piece. Potter looked incredibly pleased with himself. Bringing the chocolate to his mouth, Draco took a bite. He pinched his eyes together in slight confusion. Why was Potter so pleased with himself? Did he do something to the chocolate?
He lifted Finnigan by the front of his shirt, kneeling in front of him. Finnigan's eye was already almost swollen shut. Everyone was watching them. Everyone knew where the battle lines were being drawn.
Pansy pulled him in close, "her family is presenting her over the winter break, to her betrothed," she explained.
Their Lord tilted his head, his eyes narrowing, "Blasphemous behavior," he pursed his lips, "what a delicate way to word betrayal." He sentenced her to death with no trouble.
"Shit," he heard. He focused in on Mafalda, she was concerned about something out of Draco's sight. Was someone coming? Students could enter the Room of Hidden Things at any time. Was someone following one of the students, about to discover where the DA was meeting?
"She tripped," Draco answered, between puffs of smoke. "She tripped and fell onto a container of doxy venom."
Draco blinked. How was he going to handle this? He didn’t want to hurt Potter's godfather. What was Black thinking? "What do you want?" Draco demined, his wand still raised.
Dumbledore steadied him with an even look, "How are we going to address your mission, young Malfoy?"
Draco played Quidditch, he was muscular, plus, he was tall. People liked tall people right? Draco was smart, Potter knew this from their continued Occlumency lessons. Draco knew how to network and be social, Potter could be friends with Draco's social circle. Even if Draco had to put Pansy into a headlock. Draco could grow his hair out, if that's what Potter likes.
The three turned to see Blaise hurrying to them. Bulstrode was with him, shoving other students out of their way.
"Why not?" Draco prodded. Pansy looked down at her notes, opening her book, she was looking anywhere but at Draco. "Pansy, what's going on?" he questioned her.
"Jealous that I can talk to girls, that is," he opened. Potter looked at him, Draco hoped Potter would allow this moment to pass. Draco couldn't risk where this conversation, this admission that whatever is between them is there, could take them.
Astoria stopped before an old door. The smell of earth surrounded them. "I need you to promise not to freak out," she stated.
"I have absolutely no idea what you two are talking about," Chang stood stride along the trio. The group stepped into the busy hallway, students chattered around them.
Narcisa released Draco's hand as soon as his feet hit the soft grass. He reached out to steady his father with a firm hand on his arm. Lucius flinched out of Draco's grasp. Draco kept his face neutral as he followed his family up the gravel path. Lucius wasn't leaning so heavily on his knee. Draco supposed his father had taken a potion for the pain so that he could appear to be almost regal.
Potter’s hand dropped, “Sorry, we can just walk.” Potter’s face was one of such kind understanding, but his cheeks darkened in color.
"Have you suddenly taken a vow of silence? Where is that smart wit you've inherited from your mother?" Severus humiliated.
"Let's see what you've manage to pull out of your ass." He handed her his essay draft. They worked with practiced ease that comes with experience. Draco realized how much he missed this, missed her. Missed laughing with her over homework. Missed talking with her about subjects he wouldn't ever think about.
“I have no idea what you are talking about,” Draco began, moving threateningly close to Potter, lowering his voice to a harsh whisper, “but even if I did, I would have enough brains to not mention it in a hallway where any other students late for their class can overhear.”
He swallowed despite his dry mouth. "Daphne Greengrass. She was my betrothed, I should have seen the signs I'm sure were there."
“Have you been able to properly conjure the charm?” Professor Flitwick gently prodded with patience that made Draco envious.
"I know, I know!" he was slipping, he rubbed the back of his head. "That's why I need you," he reasoned.
Pansy sneered, "He probably almost keeled over because of the stress of raising a littler of weasels on a penny a day."
Draco didn't have the chance to defend himself before he was thrown across the room. He landed on a desk full of vials and parchment, the table falling onto its side, Draco hitting the floor as the table tilted. His head pounded only harder. He blinked. Spells of all different sorts flew in the air.
“I’ll do something even better, as a contest to our friendship, Potter,” Draco then turned and made his way to his class, counting on Potter’s temper to keep him from following him. It was not long before Draco heard determined footsteps behind him, then quicker, more rushed steps, before he was roughly stopped by Potter with a strong grip on his arm.
"Draco!" a voice brought him out of his thoughts. He turned around towards the voice, Daphne, her hair flowing behind her, was hurrying towards him.
The room was the same as always, comforting familiar. The fire was lit, the couch was a deep shade of yellow tonight, but the chairs that usually sat on either side where nowhere to be seen.
Finnigan was quick to face Draco, Potter's eyes widen in concern. "Seamus, don't answer-" Potter tried to pull Finnigan back.
His heart pounded in his ears. He pushed aside the nervousness that was building in his spine to focus on his surroundings. The footsteps were closer, but they didn’t seem to know that he was prepared with his wand in his hand. Draco was suddenly very thankful for every grueling moment spent with Aunt Bellatrix and Greyback.
"A boy?" the words are out of his mouth before he could stop them. Fuck. Shit. He needed to sew his mouth shut.
Montague reddened at the teasing. "I've seen you," he barked, his anger rising, "you walk around like you own the castle-"
His declaration sent a harsh sob through Daphne. She hid her face in her hands, her cries loud and unashamed in their fear. For the first time, true pure terror shot down her. Her knees trembled against the force of her impending death.
Draco nodded. His mind tucked away new information. In this state, he couldn't analyze. Sirius could have been speaking from a place of bias, but he had no reason to lie.
"Yes, and unless you want to watch, you'll leave," Blaise gave one more shove and Draco was out the door.
"Of course, but you would know all about that, being a woman of your standing," Draco baited, "I'm quite sure the Minister of Magic wouldn't entrust you with such an important job without you being beyond qualified."
"Hey," a cloth touched the back of his hand. Draco ducked as Potter covered him with the invisibility cloak.
Draco hid his smile as his stomach fluttered. This was a bad idea, but he risked a quiet conversation in the loud shop. "You haven't even gotten your tea yet and Cho looks like she's about to run, step up your game, mate," he teased.
The black sphere within the fire sprang to life. Draco heard gasps as the ash seemed to only grow, twisting within the smoke before rising in the shape of a large, skeletal, winged horse. He should scream. He couldn’t catch his own breath as the overpowering need to run took over his instincts. He couldn't move. Students gasped behind him. Firenze stepped back, arms protecting his face. Draco should leave. Run to safety. He could feel hands pulling him backwards, but his feet wouldn't respond.
"Well, the medicine you gave me helped my hand a lot, thanks by the way, I was wondering if I could get some more?" asked Potter.
A light touch caused Draco's skin to rise. "Sorry, is this ok?" Potter's movement froze when Draco had taken a glance at the feeling.
"I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about," Draco took the teasing, glad Daphne wasn't too angry over his earlier snap.
Draco tried to stop himself. He could see the ways in which this conversation could go, none of them good. He should try harder, be softer. He wants to be this softer, calmer version of himself for Potter.
Draco opened the map onto his lap. He studied the corridors of the map, there was few footsteps between the halls. The text clumping into an almost unreadable picture in the common rooms. Draco pointed to a hallway he didn't recognize, motioning to Potter. "That’s one of the ways to Hogsmead," Potter answered. Draco asked about another, "That's how you get to the Shrieking Shack," he explained, not moving from his place on Draco's shoulder.
"She just tripped, Professor," Draco stated innocently, before pulling his arm out of the tight grasp that held it.
He walked past the grieving parents, his own following behind him as he walked down the grand entrance of the home. The hall was bright from the large windows.  He knew his way into the reception hall. The atmosphere the house gave was a light hearted one. The image of a family laughing, of a dinner party with tipsy smiles, of children running throughout the halls, was not far from one's imagination. The weight of death was heavy in the airy home.
"My Lord, perhaps Draco should go up to his room. It is running late," Severus suggested. Draco couldn't see Severus's face as he lowered his expression to the grown, a shadow casting over his face.
"Potter." He turned away from the rolling green hills of the country side. Potter's eye met his. Draco's heart fluttered in his chest with gentleness that he didn't think he would be capable of after he had dipped his hands in blood and sin. The concern in Potter's eyes that he could see clearly with how close they were made Draco feel brighter. His mouth opened, but no words were formed.
Maybe, or, perhaps, his Lord was reminding him to stay focus, as if he needed a reminder as to what was at stake for him. He was balancing on a razor thin blade, one miss step would lead to his certain death. If he was a lucky man, his death would come quickly.
The silence she gave him was an apology. The two went back to their mutual suffering over the textbooks. Draco supplied Daphne with his more legible notes and she went over with him the proper wand motions for the last spells they had learned. Theo remained silent and unmoving.
"Occlumency is a delicate magic, unlike anything you've studied before. It's ancient and complicated, but most importantly, it’s flexible," Draco lectured. He walked around the table, taking a seat on the couch. Potter sat down next to him.
"So… dueling a professor on the first day of school," Draco brought up whenever they were sure they wouldn't be interrupted.
Draco doesn’t believe in miracles, but he was grateful to see Crabbe and Goyle when they arrived for breakfast.
Draco walked through the empty halls. Professor Frog-Face had excused him from class to instead have him monitor the halls. She was getting increasingly impatient with Potter and his army. She had certain, trustworthy, students monitor the halls in hopes of finding the club Potter was running. Draco had pointed out that most of the dungeons had yet to be investigated, so now most of Umbridge's minions where running in circles in the dark dungeons. He had bravely volunteered to continue his hall monitoring alone. Upstairs, away from the dungeons.
Draco sat on a desk, trying not to get defensive. "I've been covering for Potter," he started. He told her everything, how he had been covering for the DA, how Potter confronted him, how the two had met last night. The more Draco talked the more scared Daphne looked. By the end, she had started to smoke, not caring about the smell or the ash. She was pacing when Draco finished, walking back and forth between the desks, the smoke from her cigarette filling the air.
His father's knee was an old injury from the First War, news about such was unnecessary. Was his father in danger? His mother was warning him, but about what exactly?
Against the blanket of the night, under the warmth of the small light of the lantern above their heads, Draco could make the details of a young, familiar face. Daphne smiled, tears threatening to spill out of her beautiful bright blue eyes that Draco never had noticed before now.
" Draco cast at the Death Eater on his right that he recognized as Dolohov. He turned to his left, "
"Enough!" Draco shouted with authority he didn't know he had. Pansy rose quickly, out of breath but not out of fight. "Parkinson, stand down!" ordered Draco. Pansy stood against his order, her body tense, ready to lunge into the violence.
"You wanted to speak with me, Professor?" Draco played dumb. He was getting tired of adults pretending they knew what was going on.
Potter looked into the bag with a frown, his knuckles turning white against the fabric. He stood there, shoulders tense. Draco's neck itched in cold panic, his hands moist. What did he do wrong now? How could he manage to ruin this? This. This one good thing he had.
Draco walked to her, standing in front of her, looking down at her dark eyes. She didn't say a word. Draco handed her the bottle. Her hands were shaking.
A knock saved Draco from an hour long lecture of the life of Daphne Greengrass. Daphne opened the door with a cast from her wand.
Dolohov looped the spell high into the air, he threw the spell to Ganger. The spell hit her right in the chest. Her feet left the ground as she was thrown across the room against the wall. Draco heard the breath leave her body with the force of the throw. She slumped to the ground. Blood dripped into her hair.
The giggles started again whenever Draco looked at Potter, who had his arms around his stomach in pain from laughing so hard.
"I'm about to stick a broomstick up your ass," Draco grumbled, getting out of bed to start dressing.
Draco didn't notice Potter's absence at breakfast, he most certainly wasn't waiting for Potter. Wasn't waiting to catch Potter's gaze. Wasn't waiting for Potter to give him a small, barely noticeable smile from across the Great Hall. Wasn't waiting for Potter so that they could sneak off to the lavatory, only for a brief moment for Potter to give Draco a grin and say, 'Same time, same place?'
The lemon cake was quite excellent actually whenever Draco was calm enough to eat pass the lump that had appeared in his throat. When tears started to spill down his cheeks he stopped eating the desert and pretended to sleep.
"Shut up, I'm thinking," was Draco's response to the complaint. Potter shut his mouth as Draco thought about the consequences of this new revelation.
"Weasley, perhaps you will find this situation amusing from detention," Severus snapped at Weasley's continued laughter.
Stan Stunpike… whoever he was, he wasn't a Death Eater. The Ministry was getting desperate. They had taken to arresting anyone who so much as smelt like a Death Eater. Their lack of control of the situation was beginning to show, panic was boiling underneath the public. Before anyone noticed, the Dark Lord would be in power if Dumbledore didn't intervene.
Draco shoved his forearm onto her neck. Her airway was blocked as he pressed her against the ground, he used his weight to silence her as her neck was squeezed.
"I didn't tell you my name, what makes you think I'm going to tell you what house I'm in?" replied the                               girl, pointing out the obvious.
He finished his smoke too quickly. He thought of using his last one, but he wanted to save that for when things got truly fucked. He knew things would get worse still.
The library was dark. Torches supplied the only dim light for reading. O.W.Ls were in a week, so the library was open late. Draco stayed here until curfew. He slept better if he was exhausted. Less time to think before he fell asleep.
"You started screaming in your sleep, you lashed out whenever I tried to wake you up," Blaise explained gently.
"I think I'll let you figure that out," Potter laid his head down on Draco's lap, stretching his body over the rest of the couch.
When the Dark Lord killed an innocent muggle family in front of Draco. A mother and a father, before moving on to their two children, ending in him killing an infant.
Dumbledore was standing with his back to them as they entered. His hands were clasped behind his back. He was wearing a pair of dark blue robes, simple for his usual style. He met Draco's glare with a gentle smile, "Draco, I'm so glad you could meet me. Would you care for some tea?" He didn’t wait for Draco's answer as he poured two cups from a small floating tray. "That will be all Severus," Dumbledore dismissed.
Draco searched his knife, needing to focus on a task. The knife Potter had given him. The weapon was covered in blood, and rested in the pool of raw still growing from Daphne's seeping neck. He reached out to pick up the knife, only to blink at the sight of his bloodied hand. His heart tightened. His breath shallow. His spine tingled in danger.
"Potter? What's happened?" but he couldn't get a word in over Dobby's distressed ranting. "Dobby-" he took Dobby's tiny shoulders gently in his hands "-what happened?"
Daphne's mother hit the floor on her knees in relief. Daphne's eyes widened, she looked up, hope so clear on her face.  "Thank you," she whispered, tears running down her face. Her shoulders slacked as the tension left her body.
Potter was pulling Draco by the hand through the crowd of dueling wizards. Draco recognized Sirius battling Bellatrix. His smile cheerfully chilling in the midst of violence.
Potter unwrapped the package to reveal a dark green over cloak. The collar was high and had simple lining and clasp. "It's enchanted," he explained. "It'll always keep you pleasantly warm and there is some protective magic. Nothing fancy, but it should help in a pinch."
Potter shrugged, he was wearing his usual over-worn blue sleep wear. "You're always here before I am, so I figured I would get here early to surprise you," Potter explained. Draco took off his cloak, the room was pleasantly warm without the extra layer. He met Potter's smile with ease, as Potter was standing close.
Daphne had looked beautiful. She wore the traditional white, her hair braid elaborately, smelling faintly of tobacco. Her eyes cold.
The jerk of tripping interrupted his thoughts. He hit the floor. His bookbag spilled, his cheek hit the floor. His head throbbed as he turned to see who was responsible, probably one of the Weasley twins getting back at him for turning in their business. Montague stood over him. Fuck. A couple of Gryffindor trouble makers was one thing, the Slytherin Quidditch Captain was another. Montague sneered at him, towering over Draco, who had rose to his knees.
He had taken up the habit of keeping Darkness Powder and the Hand of Glory on his person in case the situation got dire and he had to make a quick exit. Paranoia inspired preparedness.
Daphne. Wonderful Daphne. Daphne, who takes legible notes. Daphne, who is capable of talking about subjects other than potions. Daphne, who has ignored Draco since she got into a fight with Pansy.
Potter pushed himself away so quickly he chair fell as he stood, walking away from him. Draco hurried after him before he could think. He reached out to Potter, grabbing his shoulder only for Potter to turn to face him, hands clenching at the front of his robes. Draco's heart snapped into two as he realized that Potter was crying.
Draco could hear the shuffling of footsteps outside the train cart. Everyone was greeting their friends from over the break. The sounds of their smiles split Draco's ears in a twisted sort of jealousy. No one would each out to comfort him within this train.
Draco smiled, "Good, I'm glad to hear that he's okay. Father didn't offer any explanation as to why Dobby wasn't a part of our home anymore, I always wondered what happened to him." He turned around, only to see that Potter had walked to him, eliminating the distance between them as always.
The weight of Potter's constant stare weighed heavy on his shoulders. Wherever Draco went, if Potter was there, he was watching Draco. For what? Was he aware of how obvious he was being? One glance at the wrong time, and Draco was bleeding on the Manor floor.
Draco stood, walking to the couple of steps that led to the closet, he made sure to step over the doorframe that connected the steps to the door. People had been known to trip.
Draco swallowed, his face blushed as his eyes tickled with tears. This wasn't what he wanted. This wasn't what Pansy had agreed to. He had taken it too far, Pansy could die, the blame was on him. He should have done more research into Doxy venom, the case files in the library just hadn't been enough.
Draco hadn't bothered asking why they were there, he wasn't yet capable of imagining the terror his own mother could inflict on her son. She led him to the basement, and he followed her with ease through the dusty, dark house.
The group drifted into silence. Draco looked out the window, they still had a way until they arrived to the train station. Draco's stomach tightened into a painful coil as the train travelled on and on. Sweat started to prick the back of his neck. He felt sick, there was something wrong. Painfully wrong. Draco was offset by the simple wrongness he knew, he could sense with an instinct that was settled deep into his heart.
"Watch it you idiot- oh, it's you," he heard a familiar voice snap. He turned his head, recognizing the long brown hair in a braid.
He remained quiet out of respect for the nervousness of the situation. Daphne only blinked politely whenever spoken to, a tight lip smile on her face whenever strictly necessary. Astoria was quiet, tension rolling off of her as she kept her head down.
They stood there, still under the invisibility cloak at Potter's suggestion despite having the privacy of a classroom. Their bodies warming the space around them under the cloak. They stood closer than what was needed. They could feel each other's breath on their faces. Draco whispered goodnight but Potter made no move to leave. 'This would be where we kiss goodnight,' Draco thought to himself.
Mafalda made a noise that reminded him of a dying mermaid that he could only assume was a laugh. "What the fuck Mafalda," he wheezed, clutching his chest. "Mafalda," he repeated, "Merlin, that's an awful name."
Potter huffed, walking around the couch to sit next to Draco. Draco pulled his legs to his chest to allow room. "Look who's talking, when did you get here?"
"They won't let me see my dad," Crabbe explained, "I just want to know if he's ok." Crabbe gave Draco a humbled look, his eyes cast downward and his hands folded gently in front of him. Crabbe new he was addressing someone above his standing, he knew he was giving Draco a chance to call in a favor.
Draco entered the lavatory, which was empty, as expected. He kept his back towards the entrance, not sure if he could face Potter's scorn.
"I've never hated you," Draco confided. Potter looked up at Draco for the first time, his eyes bright. Eyes that made Draco honest. "I was jealous of you, you were everything that I wanted to be, so I was bitter. I don't know, it all seems so stupid now," Draco admitted. Such childish jealousy seemed pointless in the face of war.
Draco finally arrived to the door in which Charms were held. He paused at the door, hand on the handle, listening in for an opportunity to enter unnoticed as possible. He waited until he heard Flitwick begin having students practice the charm for the day and slipped into the class with ease. He took his normal seat in the back of the large room, nodding at Professor Flitwick who was still at the front of the classroom.
He was useless if he couldn't enter any of the rooms. Worse, he was so open to attack. What would he do. He laid his hand on the smooth wood of the door closest to him. Pushing it, but nothing happened.
"Put some privacy charms up," Draco whispered, making sure they took his advice before leaving them to whatever. Draco's stomach was not affected at all by the show he was just forced to witnessed, growling loudly. He made his way down the stairs and into the Common Room. Draco could work on homework or more research on Occlumency.
"My Mother didn't say, she can't I assume, but she hinted as well as she could. I'm sure it's you," she agreed.
"No, but are you telling me that you haven't learned anything from living under his roof? From being surrounded by Death Eaters every day? Draco, you came back from the summer break as almost a Master Occlumens-"
A picture of Potter, one from fourth year, Draco instantly recognized, was placed in front of Draco and the book he wasn't reading. Daphne had reached over Draco to enclose him in her arms while holding the paper so he could read. The article was some propaganda against Potter, unsurprisingly.
The sun was dipping in the sky based off of the color of the sunbeams on the shelves. Dinner would be served soon, he should finish up for the day. He started the long task of putting away his books and notes.
"No, but I do have detention with him for a month," Draco corrected, taking a big bite of his dinner, having skipped lunch.
Pansy stood up, her wrist to her forehead, the other hand supplying support as she leaned against the table dramatically. "With his fine arse I always check out in Quidditch and his strong hands," Pansy swooned.
This cause a tightness in Draco' throat that he couldn't pass. He couldn't speak. He looked down at his feet, over at the steaming food on his desk, the curtains, the lavatory door. He looked anywhere except at his father.
"I'm not quite sure about that. They have to worry about their mother's side of the family after all," Draco corrected with a grin, trying to lighten the mood. He earned himself a solid punch on the arm for that.
Draco made to shove pass the woman, only to flinch when she brought her wand up. He instantly moved his arms to protect himself, moving to grab his wand. “And what exactly do you think you’re doing?” he snapped.
He hadn't talked to Potter at all over the summer, too dangerous. He had wanted to. In a way that he could feel in his chest when he allowed himself to think about it, he had wanted to. He had wanted to whisper gentle comforts to Potter. He had wanted to laugh with Potter. He had wanted to be there for Potter. But the world wasn't so kind.
Potter carefully worked the fabric along Draco's hand. His hands had stopped shaking. "Jealous of your control," was the clarification.
Laughter that could be descried as an cough exploded from Draco's lips. He fake coughed into his fist to sell it. Daphne raised her eyebrows at him, her eyes wide as she glanced between the two of them. He shrugged easily, nodded at the chair. Daphne made her way to the chair, sitting with grace before digging her heels into the floor and pushing back, shoving Draco against the window with a thud. "Sorry darling, but I'm afraid I'm not that thin," she tsked.
Potter was sitting in between Longbottom and Weasley. Granger sat across from Weasley, giving Potter the perfect window to see the Slytherin. Potter enjoyed his stew, while Granger talked with Weasley about something or another. Longbottom was reading a large textbook, which, from his distance, Draco could guess the book was over Longbottom’s favorite subject; Herbology. Nobody was paying Potter any mind, nobody was paying Draco any mind, now was the time to make a move.
Now that Draco knew he was allowed, he took Potter's hand whenever he could. Sometimes, if they had a more quiet night where they would just sit and talk about almost nothing at all, Draco would feel Potter draw circles with his thumb on the back of his hand. On those nights, he would go to bed copying the movement with his finger, like it wasn't the touch he was trying to savor.
"Why is Montague picking on you? After you made him cry in the hallway, why wouldn't he stay clear of you?" Potter investigated.
Severus stepped out from the shadows. With a wave of his wand, he cleaned the spilled tea and the over-turned chair. He walked to where Draco to was standing, healing the cut on his cheek, but unable to heal the wounds in Draco's heart. "I can sta-"
Whenever Potter had told Draco about Dobby's new residency at Hogwarts, relief had enveloped Draco. His father never had told him why Dobby was suddenly not a part of their family anymore. He had assumed the worst, as Dobby's family had been a part of the Malfoy's for generations.
Draco turned to Potter, who met his eyes. "For now," he whispered. Potter nodded, never breaking Draco's gaze. A blush crawled up his neck.
Draco couldn't focus on the lesson. Daphne was sitting in front  of him, he couldn't catch her eye. He looked at her loosely braided hair in a single rope down to the center of her back. She and Chang worked on their lesson without an issue, Chang even laughed at something Daphne said.
"Let's not forget why we're here. I know exactly what is necessary," Draco pulled out of his father's grasp.
Draco stood, holding out a hand to the frightened girl. She paused before allowing him to help her up. "What's your name?" he asked.
His thoughts were pulled from him as he felt a gentle squeeze on his hand, "You're so quiet, what are you thinking about?"
The two boys enjoyed the simple act of walking without any roles to play, not saying anything, using the setting sun and the deep blues to hide behind. This had become a weekly routine, one which Draco enjoyed, however pathetic it may be. Zabini had yet to converse with any of the other students for more than a couple of minutes since returning to Hogwarts from the summer break.
Pansy gave a smile that only she could give. She leaned into Draco's space, cupping her hand around her mouth as she whispered, "Your fiancé was talking rather intimately to none other than Harry Potter in the halls this morning."
Would he and Potter still work together? Had Draco changed into such a different person that he and Potter wouldn't be able to talk? Would they still be friends?
If he showed one flicker of how he truly felt, he would be the next child to die too soon. If he showed how he felt, Potter would be alone in his war to only fight from the outside in. If he gave away how his heart was bleeding onto the floor, Daphne's death would stand for nothing. He would not let any of that happen.
The Malfoy family, as their reward for hosting their Lord, had the privilege of standing next to his throne. Their backs were to the farthest wall of the hall, candelabras on either side of their family. Lucius stood on the other side of grand wooden throne,  leaning heavily on his cane. His robes were loose on his body, and he had lost a noticeable amount of weight.
Draco turned his back, he had been shown to be the victor. Now, no one would raise their wands to him. He was out for blood, and now everyone knew.
Draco studied Potter, his eyes were bright with a steady vulnerability. Potter was prepared to be hurt. Potter swallowed, Draco's hesitancy to answer was an answer within itself. Draco would have to be honest if he wanted to keep his friendship with Potter, even if that means showing is cards to Daphne.
Draco gasped when he felt a soft touch along his jaw. His body sparked in sensation. The touch traveled from his jaw to his neck. Potter lend in.
Theo watched as Blaise left, biting his cheek. Theo didn't need a reminder of his situation, he lived through the pain every day. This shown in his wise, pale blue eyes. "You won't-" he stared.
With another glance around the classroom for prying eyes, Draco pulled his bookbag onto his lap. He rummaged silently for the salve he had made yesterday. Pulling the round container out, he wrote a note on the parchment.
The hands working on bandaging his stopped. "Is this because I tried to kiss you?" Potter's voice shook. Draco looked up, Potter's eyes were glassy in tears unsplit.
How could he? His mind was a puddle of stray thoughts, Occlumency was useless on him because he had no thoughts to cling to. Why was this necessary?
Draco heard the glass shatter, heard her body hit the floor. Then silence. Draco froze as Pansy didn't move from the crumpled heap at the bottom of the steps. Did he kill her?
He felt as if he was a ghost, he was a constant outsider looking in. A gust of cold wind looking in through the window of a warm house.
"Potter, I mean this in the nicest why possible, but for their sakes, limit your feelings talk to Granger."
"Zabini? Theo, what's going on?" Blaise inquired, reaching for Theo with a nervous arm. When Theo pulled his hand back as if he had been burned, Blaise looked as if his friend had just gutted him.
Draco's head felt heavy as he rose to get dressed. An early breakfast didn't sound awful, he wasn't going to get any sleep anyway. Draco dressed for the day quietly, none of his dorm mates awake yet. He made sure to grab his book bag, and with a moment of consideration the bag of healing salves, before leaving the room with careful silence.
There was almost on one in the halls at this hour. Everyone had contended themselves in their respected common rooms for the night. Anyone he did pass kept their eyes downward. The fight had been worth the consequences.
"Given that we are talking about him, I believe that this is his concern," Draco insisted, walking to stand by Potter's side.
Draco didn't have anyone to wait for anymore when class ended. He was the first one out the door, ignoring Professor's calls out to him. He ignored Potter's concerned looked. He ignored the sneers of other students. He was still trying to ignore his grief twisting a stab into his heart.
A grin formed over Daphne's face, this was now obviously the reason way she wanted to talk. She shrugged, "Oh, you know me, I simply amazed everyone there with my intellect. Charmed everyone with my fantastic personality. And shattered their preconceived ideas of me as a person."
He entered the supply closet, all the ingredients neatly labeled and alphabetized. Draco began to look for what he needed, working quickly. Pansy entered behind him, seeming nervous. Draco found what he was looking for. Under the 'V's', was Doxy Venom in a glass bottle, as pure Doxy Venom could only be held in glass.
Their footsteps the only sound in the halls as they stayed closer than needed. Draco let Potter lead him where he may as he took in the sight of his castle. He drunk in the place of where he grew up. Where he had his first kiss. Made his first best friend.
His steps echoed on the stones. The echoes could be mistaken for a person walking beside him like she used to.
"We… have a connection," Potter started. "I think it's because of the-" he motioned to the scar on his forehead that was more of a brand- "I can see into his thoughts, I feel his emotions. They  seep into my nightmares, so I don't sleep much."
He turned. He looked down at the small girl with dark skin and brown hair. "Alfie," he greeted. "I think it should start soon." She nodded. She was wearing a black dress, her hair was in a braid down her back. "How's Astoria? I've seen you two together before," Draco couldn't ask her himself. He wasn't cruel.
Pansy leaned into his space, "You know they see my father as a Blood Traitor for killing himself instead of facing the Dark Lord, what does that make us? How long do you think we will last before me and my mother are made examples of?" she whispered harshly.
"Draco, I didn't think you would be here," Potter mumbled at his feet, scratching the back of his head.
Draco turned away from the moonless night sky. He leaned his back against the railing that hugged the edge of the tower. Potter would be here soon. Draco had come early, he wanted to time to think. He needed the time alone before the entered the battle field.
"For Merlin, we even had a werewolf teach us one year. Dumbledore allowed a werewolf near children," Draco continued.
"I live with my aunt and uncle," Potter broke the silence, still not looking at Draco but stayed within his grasp. "And I don't know what I did, but they… they ignore me," Potter took a deep shaking breath, "They hate me." Draco kissed his head. "I don’t know what I did, but they hate me so much." Potter didn’t start crying, but Draco could hear the disappointment in his voice.
"What? Why-" Cho tried to speak as she rosed to stand. Bones helped her up before the pair hurried down a hall away from him.
Draco pained through his reading, determined to understand this stupid overcomplicated Potions Theory book. Severus had made a snide comment about the series being 'over Draco's simple capabilities' and Draco wasn't one to achieve out of inspiration, but spite. He was sitting on the floor, leaning against the front of the emerald couch in the Common Room. Goyle sat on one of the mint chairs adjacent to the couch, talking to Crabbe over Draco, who was sitting across from Goyle in the other chair. Daphne's knees where against Draco's head, as she had taken the seat on the couch directly behind him. She was reading a copy of the Prophet, humming in response to the stupidity.
Montague was off putted by this, his expressions were painfully obvious to read. "I've seen you…" he hissed quietly, they were gaining a crowd. Montague was out of his debts.
Draco turned. His father had Potter by the hair. He was growling into his face, threatening him, his gaze deadly.
"So you lash out. Daddy doesn't love you, Mommy finds comfort in the end of the bottle," Montague flinched, Draco was right. "You have so much angry feelings inside of you that you feel all twisty so you find someone to shove down so they can lick the shit off of your shoes. Why? Does making others feel like shit make you feel better? Or is it your way of trying to get attention from daddy? Does your father hit you instead of ignore you when you act up?" Montague's chin quivered, he should stop. Draco had proven his point, Montague had been humiliated, but fury pushed Draco to new lengths. New cruelty Draco didn't know he was capable of.
Draco watched as Potter stepped up to the fire next. Unsurprisingly, he got the sign for doom and gloom. Potter just shrugged with the old news Firenze bursting into laughter at Potter's response. Potter turned, he met Draco's eyes, winking. Draco hit his snort behind a cough, his stomach fluttering and his neck blushing.
Draco looked around, the hour was late, but there could still be listening ears. Draco cast a silencing charm on them, to ensure their conversation stayed as confidential as they needed.
Draco continued his walk around the base of the castle, not meeting anyone else on his lengthy route as he walks down towards Herbology. The world is quiet, even if only for a couple moments.
"Why is Dumbledore willing to risk the very fabric of a student's mind on me?" Draco elaborated. "For all he knows, I have no clue what I'm teaching Potter, or perhaps I'm trying to lower his defenses to be in much needed good graces with the Dark Lord. Why take the risk?"
Draco landed on his ass yet again, his mouth open in surprised. Potter looked down at his, his eyes wide, his face red. Draco tilted his head in question. Potter ran away and jumped on Montague's back in response.
His fist curled against his pants, bunching the cloth beneath his hands. Calm rage pooled in his belly; he would not let this happen. He would drown before he let that happen.
"Don't you fucking touch her. Don't you ever touch her-" Pansy thrashed against Montague, who stumbled back. Pansy kept shoving Montague back until he was against the wall, "You stay away from her." The room was silent.
As Professor Firenze continued, Draco searched for Potter. He was standing next to Weasley, as Granger had the good sense not to take this course. Potter's eyes were unseeing with deep bags underneath. His head was drooping towards his chin, Draco had no doubt that if he wasn't standing he would fall asleep.
But Pansy didn't pay any mind to Draco or Daphne. Instead, she focused on Montague. Laughing loudly at whatever he said. Draco took note of her long hair that was loose down her back, carefully curled. She didn't have much in the way of breast, her personal complaints, but even Draco noticed how high they were on her chest. She made up for her lack of cleavage by her uniform, which was unbuttoned generously. Her skirt also showed several inches of upper thigh, amplified by her heels with no knee high socks. She was very out of uniform.
Draco told him what he told the professors that have found him injured in the halls. He didn't have any clue who attacked him. Draco was also quick to remind everyone he did have a serious concussion, and could he really be expected to have seen his attacker's face when he was tossed in the air then lit on fire?
Bulstrode, because the situation couldn't get any worse, shoved Crabbe while he was distracted. Crabbe fell to the floor, flush with embarrassment. The crowd gasped; the Slytherin House was usually united.
"Hurry up, asshole. You're running late for breakfast, or would you rather think about someone's broomstick?" Blaise continued to teased.
With a hand raised, their Lord silenced Daphne. "So…" he started, "you state that you made a simple mistake."
What would happen to Theo? His father arrested, his mother dead. He had no living relatives. Perhaps this could be his chance out. Maybe he could leave his world, get out of it while he still could. Draco hoped that for him.
With a roll of his eyes, Draco explained, "You and I both know Theo will separate himself from Zabini soon, he can't be connected to the Zabini family in any way, not with his father being so high up in the ranks.."
The battered group returned to the circular hall. Their breaths the only sounds against the smooth bricks. Potter was half way across the circular room. They were going to get out.
"Draco…there are certain…" Lucius paused to find the correct phrasing. Draco has never seen his father at a loss for words. Lucius swallowed. "There are certain duties that come with being a Malfoy."
"Don't you ever pretend to know what I'm going through," she concluded. Draco looked down at the floor in his shame he couldn't move. Pansy stood there, staring into his soul, before she walked away.
Potter’s eyes widen with the easiness of Draco’s trust, not that Draco had a choice, but Potter was not that inclusive. All of that frustration and temperament that Draco had witnessed earlier today was gone, leaving a softer version of the Gryffindor.
Severus hurried to help his friend, leaving Draco by the window. Draco knew what was going to happened as his mother ran herself into Draco. He had already accepted this outcome.
Blaise stood there, a nervous smile on his lips. "Can I talk to you, Theo?" he asked, leaning in for privacy, shuffling his feet. He probably wanted to ask why Theo never talked to him outside of classes, or never sat next to him for dinner, or why he didn't ask him to study together last night.
