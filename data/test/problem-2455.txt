Cedric gripped Draco's soft hand tightly in his. Happy smiles constantly graced Cedric's handsome face because, at last, the brunette could find the person who had stolen all of his attention.
But the man was like Harry, suddenly in front of Draco while flapping his white wings. "We need to talk," he said suddenly.
Harry's clear emerald eyes staring intensely at the girl's body suddenly stopped at the elbow. It looked to be bleeding a little. Not only in the elbow, but her knee was also bleeding.
"You look very beautiful tonight, Your Majesty." complimented Charles that ended with admiration.
The young man's smile grew wider when he saw his husband finally rise from his throne. In an instant, there was silence. There was no longer the sound of music from the orchestra or the high heels worn by the ladies in the ballroom.
"What do you think we should do to get the weavers back to weaving linen?" asked Harry to his wife, who at this time seemed to be busy writing right at a luxurious wooden table opposite him.
"Tell me one more time?" Ares asked fiercely at his communication device in the form of a crystal plate attached to his arm.
"Nothing," argued Draco. It was enough for Luna to know that he was a Demigod, and no one else should know. "I've found the girl you want. I'll bring her this weekend. And after this, I won't have any business with you anymore."
"Of course I would. Dancing with this future royal leader must be a wonderful thing." Draco said no less politely as he welcomed the crown prince's outstretched hand.
3. Demigod, the term for half-human and half-god.
Draco was stunned. They all don't know what really happened. Draco is not Harry's lover. He lived in this house not as Harry's lover, but more like a prisoner. Draco was kidnapped and abused by that most-wanted bachelor.
Draco turned his head, wanting to know what had so caught Daphne's attention, and once again, he was blown away. In Daphne's hand, hanging on an elegant coat hanger, was an extraordinarily beautiful dress.
“Oh…Oh my god.” Draco closed his eyes as the pleasure exploded and drowned his body with unbearable heat.
Ares seemed to have forgotten his main goal. Alastair and the other envoys must be anxious right now. Ares should have immediately picked up the prince and told them, but he couldn't stop observing the prince of Sparta. He barely even noticed when the pack of wolves started to move in to hunt. Draco was their target.
The young man smiled as he grabbed a single rose which was darker in color than the others, plucked it, and brought the rose to his nose, inhaling the fragrance of his favorite flower.
"Luna? Can you hear me?" Draco was starting to get confused because he couldn't hear Luna's voice at all. Just a few murmurs and some strange noise from the other end of the line.
Harry's hand then moved across Draco's naked back gently, making Draco lift his face to gaze at the other man, giving him a pleading look.
Harry gently ran his hand across Draco's cheek, and then his lips followed his fingers. Draco closed his eyes. This must be a dream. Harry Potter, in the real world, could not possibly be this gentle. That man would have immediately forced, raped, and treated him harshly.
Draco nodded his head. "No. I'm fine," His voice sounded hoarse, struggling to get it out.
"Of course, I want to come down," Without accepting Cedric's hand, he jumped off Cedric's horse. Draco's eyes were instantly locked into the beautiful scene in front of him. That place was truly heaven on earth.
What Draco was experiencing right now was no different from one of the scenes he'd read in the erotic novel that Glenice had given him. His instincts pushed him to close his eyes. Until the shadow comes The image of Draco and Harry's wedding, the image of the two of them swearing their loyalty to each other in front of the sacred altar.
"Get in quickly, or I'll drag you by force." Harry's jaw tightened, trying to pull Draco's arm.
"No, of course not." Ares shook his head and put his arm around his wife's shoulder. Which he immediately let go of because with just that fleeting touch, dirty thoughts flashed through his head.
Gasping for the adrenaline rush, Draco leaned back against the bathroom door, closed his eyes, unconcerned by Alden's angry pounding on the door.
Draco nodded his head faintly in response. It didn't take long for Draco to reach for Cedric's beautiful and elegant sword that had been handed to him. The young man walked so decisively from the changing room of the guards that were still in the same location as the training grounds.
Draco still remembered standing next to his father, who froze at his mother's skinny and pale face. Her expression was asleep, and he felt sad at the realization that his mother was probably happier now that she had passed away. After the death of his mother, his father was devastated and destroyed.
That must have been something the older man wanted to mention again and again as if there was nothing else the older man wanted to talk about. Wasn't that man curious about his own son's condition?
After tying his long blonde hair, he then took a large plastic box in the corner of the room and then started tidying it one by one, putting all the scattered dolls and toys.
Confused, Ares said things he shouldn't have said. He said he no longer wanted to share the bed with his mortal wife. He did it because his pride was disturbed. He couldn't guess Troya's behavior. Yet all this time, he was proud to admit that he was the ultimate lover worshiped by his lovers—except for Aphrodite.
"Huh? Where's that rule come from? It turns out that Sparta has a strange habit of eating at the dining table," Ares protested.
Harry gave the water to Draco, and Draco greedily took a sip of it. But his breath was still panting, and he still looked tormented by the heat overpowering his body. There must be something… Harry leaned back as Draco leaning on him so that he could see Draco clearly. Draco's face flushed red, his breath was gasping, and his eyes were a little unfocused. He was always complaining of the heat.
Draco snorted. "It so happened that Doctor Jason was here, so I asked him to feed me,"
2021/8/21
Harry threw the towel angrily onto the sofa. “In the past two days, you have made your own decision and opposed me twice. Listen to this carefully, Alden,” Harry's voice was deep and menacing. "Once again, you make a fool that troubles me, not only the punches you get, and I will finish you as fast as I can." The threatening voice still echoed in the darkness, like a devil's promise calling for life.
"You watched a werewolf movie?" asked Harry. Finally, the man spoke. Draco thought he wouldn't talk.
Draco grabbed Vlad's shoulders as he stabbed his manhood inside Draco's body.
Even though Lucius' face was adorned with fine wrinkles, it still gave off an extremely intimidating aura even though it had lost some of its good looks.
"I found you."
"I doubt it too, but the more I think about it, it's possible!" Draco exclaimed.
"Hmm, I even have a plan crazier than that, more than you can imagine, you will find out later," his eyes fixed on Draco intimately. "But for sure, the tension between us is so intense, and I'm not hypocritical to admit it in front of you, I'm always excited when I see you. I get aroused when I think of you. I want to fuck you all the time..."
"I'm not ready," He responded again. Draco would probably do badly. Ares probably won't like his body and realizes that he may not be as beautiful as people say. They might just not fit in the bed, and Ares ended up ignoring him.
"I am truly jealous of Your Majesty's heart. How can Your Majesty consider His Majesty's mistress as your own sister? If I were Your Majesty, I would have considered her a pest that must be exterminated." Natalie grumbled subconsciously.
"I feel pity for you. I think Hades is cursing you. Everything would be better off if you just died from being bitten by a snake. But now what? You're going to be presented to Olympus? The king doesn't love you. He's waiting for the right moment to sacrifice you to a god," The mischievous girl babbled. Draco tried to remember her name but failed. It seemed that Troya had gotten so used to ignoring them that he was reluctant to waste time remembering his evil sister's name.
"No, I mean, you really didn't attend the big event?" asked Ron.
Draco rolled his eyes. "I don't want to discuss my night activities with Ares with anyone, understand?"
Ignoring the screams of Draco and Harry behind him, Peeves had disappeared in the blink of an eye. Draco couldn't help but sigh. If it was like this, he's sure all Hogwarts would know right away.
With the other man so close, Draco finally had the opportunity to clutch at that muscular body and stroke over Harry’s skin. Draco held the other to his chest, reaching a hand up to outline Harry's face before reaching around to claw at his back when Harry pounded his prostrate with a well-aimed thrust.
"Hey, hey…" Doctor Jason approached the bed and touched Draco's arm. "What's wrong, Draco? Are you all right?"
Hades was the God of Death and was believed to inhabit Tartarus—the underworld where the spirits of Greek humans who have died live. He was there guarding them with the minor god Thanatos and the monster Cerberus, a large three-headed dog.
"I am Attica, an Amazonian warrior,"
"Thank you, now I have provisions for Athens," Draco muttered excitedly.
Draco couldn't understand why this man in front of him wanted him so badly and wanted Draco to love him. Is this the only way so he can kill Draco? But he can kill Draco anytime, anywhere with his power.
"I am an Emperor, and this is my palace. I am free to do anything here," said Harry nonchalantly. He stepped into the palace through a quiet path to the existence of the nobles.
Draco chose to remain silent. The young man didn't want to waste his energy arguing with his father about the same issue every time they met.
"Now, let me go before you starve. I'll make breakfast for you," said Narcissa, and she let go of Draco's embrace.
"We have to go home soon. Let's say goodbye to the host first."
"I did ask Hermione to save me," Draco lifted his chin haughtily, challenging Harry.
Supposedly when Harry harassed him, Draco could hold back and pretend to be an easy woman. He should be willing to sacrifice to hold back his feelings. At least when he obliged, Harry would probably be pleased and caught off guard and drink his drink and die. It was too late. Harry seemed disinterested in his drink and was utterly attracted to Draco. Besides, Draco couldn't pretend to like Harry; his hatred for him was too deep.
Five.
The man followed Draco's line of sight and smiled. "I'm Doctor Jason. I was the doctor who treated you yesterday when you were brought here. Your head must be hurting, right? You hit it hard enough. I sewed 12 stitches in there."
"I didn't do anything, Lady. My husband is already happy, so I don't have to put in extra effort to make him happy." Draco replied as he gave Natalie a sweet smile.
"What was the purpose of calling me to this place? Your Grace must know, as a queen, I can't waste my time on things that are not important." Draco said casually.
The King of the Delion Kingdom took a long-legged glass that had been on his throne chair. The drink was filled with dark red wine. The King of the Delion raised the glass high with a happy smile decorating his wrinkled face.
Revised:
The young man looked back. He had obtained enough information that seemed to help him survive safely in Ares palace, though still confusing.
"No need, it's not important to him. Our job is to bring the Prince of Sparta back to Olympus," Alastair responded.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Ares gets bored quickly. The lovers also mostly force Ares to continue to focus on them. They want to be his eternal partner. When that happens, Ares will separate from them. He never wanted a serious relationship in the long term. Besides—" Lasonas' words stopped abruptly.
Draco continued to move his body gracefully according to the music played by the orchestra. The song changes, the sign will begin the exchange of partners.
There was Harry's voice chuckling outside. "Why do you think, Draco? Do you think I'm that easily poisoned in public? Do you think I didn't know that you've been sniffing around for a chance to get your revenge?” Harry's voice sounded close. "You played with fire," He whispered. "Now is the time for you to burn."
"I forgive you,"
"Wait! Do you guys have to discuss all that with the prince of Sparta?" Alastair groaned.
Without waiting for Harry to move to leave, Draco immediately turned around and took a step towards the cold river. Draco looked down at the miserable river with a waterfall that looked amazing but terrifying at the same time. If only the sun were still shining brightly in the sky, surely Draco's heart wouldn't be this heavy to be in that river.
And as if Alden did not suspect him, the man approached and looked at Draco, "You want help to the bathroom?"
“I need—” he began to plead.
When Ares saved him from the wolves, he was wearing armor, but now he's probably wearing a slightly less revealing outfit than the Spartan warriors in 300 movie. Draco tried to calm down. He had seen similar sights many times when he lived in Hollywood.
Draco didn't answer Harry's question because it felt like his brain wasn't letting his mouth speak. Draco squeezed Harry's hand tighter, and then Harry cupped his face with both hands. At first, it was cold and piercing, then it began to feel warm, and finally, the buzz was gone.
"Well, if you don't like him, let another Titan have him. Yesterday you said he was a gift from a bet made by the gods, right? Is Dion also included?"
Hector's face turned tense and slightly angry. The young man spoke back to him. Whereas all this time, even though Hector realized the compulsion of his smile—Troya never spoke loudly to him. Because Hector knew that Troya didn't want anyone to hate him.
"What?" Draco didn't understand why Ares concluded it like that. "I do not—"
Draco stared angrily into Harry's eyes, but the man just chuckled.
"We don't really know each other yet," Draco reminded again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco's tears dripped down. His legs also trying to step back, struggling to get back away from the other man, but it was too late when Harry swiftly stepped closer and captured his petite body into a gentle hug.
Not wanting to waste any more time, Draco stepped right in. But suddenly, the blonde's body froze as he felt a strong hand hug him from behind. He felt the head of the owner of the firm hand now drop onto Draco's satin-covered shoulder.
Daphne chuckled in amazement at her own handiwork, then muttered, distracting Draco. "You are the most different from Mr. Potter's previous lovers," Daphne grimaced. "It's not that you are any less beautiful, you are the only 'male' lover that Mr. Potter has, but you are no less beautiful than them even if your makeup is not too heavy."
"Since it's quite a distance from here, we have to get our horses on quickly. I know you don't want us to come back late, and Harry will get mad again," said Cedric when Draco's horse was right beside his.
"But you have to keep eating. I'll order another menu for you. Maybe hot soup and fresh juice can arouse your taste?"
"I heard the Titans are monstrous giants and spout fire like Kronos who Zeus killed, but you all seem normal," Draco doubted.
"I'll keep that in mind," Draco agreed warily. Even a short walk in the forest of Olympus was already dangerous for him. He wouldn't want to go near Hades at all. Moreover, the title of the God of Death sounded more terrifying than the God of War.
"Make sure they know you had a great night, Troya," He whispered in his ear as he closed his eyes and hugged him.
My dear... Draco was struck by lightning. That voice, very much like the voice of the man who used to be in his dreams. He felt
the blond asked back, watching the contents of the glass in Harry's hand, causing the green-eyed handsome man to raise an eyebrow.
"What? Who do you mean?"
"You... You died in that war. You shouldn't be here..." Draco whispered, his whole body began to tremble. There was a sense of terror knowing that this man could still set foot in the castle garden after what Athena had told Draco — that a sword coated with poison had pierced the other man's heart in that war. That was the only reason Draco finally came out of his hiding place to avoid this man.
"Sorry, I can't, Your Majesty," Terence said with an amused chuckle.
"I have some herbal ointment in my drawer. I'll rub it on Arabelle's feet." Draco offered calmly.
»»-———— ♡♡♡ ————-««
"You look so stunning tonight, Your Majesty Draco. Even I'm sure the goddess of beauty would be jealous of your current beauty."
Draco couldn't help but glanced at the green dress on the floor and let out a bitter sigh even though he didn't want to wear a dress, but it couldn't be denied that it was so beautiful. However, behind his disappointment was satisfaction that at least he could show Harry that he could challenge him.
"I know you're a little sorry, Ares. I forgive you," Draco confirmed. The War God laughed again. He then leaned half-knuckle against the wall and carried Draco on his lap. The boy shrieked softly in panic.
Alden looked at Draco carefully. "Yes, a ridiculous offer, but it immediately made master Harry change his mind."
Feeling highly depressed, Draco paid his respects to his father with polite gestures before the beautiful young man turned around and rushed out of the large room, which somehow felt cramped for him.
Protect him from what? An instant later, they rolled over, and a loud bang hit his head, darkening everything, and Draco couldn't remember anything else.
Draco blinked. "Shower?"
"It means I'm different from your other lovers. I have different rights."
"I want to buy a guitar," Draco said.
"We just met," Draco said again.
"What?" Aphrodite responded in surprise. "Who?" She asked, looking displeased.
His plan failed. He hadn't even had time to walk more than six meters. Hector caught his hand and pulled him away.
"Draco," Harry called out Draco's name with exasperation. "You have to get well soon so I can take you home. It's not safe here."
"Prove that you are indeed messengers of God Ares and not messengers from other kings or princes," Draco said as he looked at Alastair firmly. Alastair's face turned serious. He didn't seem to like the Prince of Sparta challenging him. Yet, Draco had to do it because he didn't want to end up in the bed of a lowly noble who wasn't worth it for Troya.
The tall man smiled with a strange gentleness. Draco didn't know what happened to him, that there was only one way to heal Draco from his pain, and he needed Harry for that. Harry leaned over and brushed their lips gently, finding the beautiful eyes widen in surprise. Harry couldn't help smiling. It was incredible. The combination of innocence and intense passion really fascinated him.
READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
Harry didn't reply again. He turned back and leaned against the window. "I give you the honor to stand beside me, Malfoy."
"Rest again if you still feel tired. You can sleep in this room or if you prefer your room. Alden will bring your breakfast in a moment." Harry brushed Draco's hair before he finally walked and opened the bedroom door. "My guest is coming today, so I will be kinda busy. You can take a walk to the garden if you want." He uttered, then disappeared behind the door.
"What happened?" Draco asked quietly, but it sounded like a scream in his own ear.
Draco shouted, spontaneously grabbing Harry's swinging arm, preventing Harry from finishing off Alden. "Stop! Stop! I was wrong. I was wrong! Please don't kill him! It is my fault!" he shouted frantically, silver eyes already glassy with tears.
"There are many choices. The club is one of them."
Draco replied with a soft smile.
Draco could not rest well at all. He woke up an hour after that. Not knowing what to do in his room, Draco decided to take a walk to the garden for some fresh air even though his head was still a little dizzy. To be honest, Draco rarely got sick since he was a child. Even if he was sick, all he had was a cold and fever.
The King of Sparta never bowed to anyone. He was leading the nation with the strongest military in all of Greece. Therefore, he was not willing to show his weakness. Like most other Spartan warriors—though he doesn't always fight on the front lines anymore—his body is strong, and his palms can still grip the sword firmly. The graying of his hair and the frown lines at the corners of his eyes did not detract from his prestige.
Draco seemed to blink a few times when he heard Cedric's suggestion. "Yes, of course." The answer was a little confusing.
Draco's eyes filled with tears, not expecting Harry to be that cruel to tore off such a beautiful dress to show off his arrogance and power. Draco had given up his pride to be crushed by this monster, and what the result?! What a cruel man!
Actually, Draco himself was confused by himself. Part of his heart hates Vlad, but partly wants him.
The wind's blowing through the bones. Draco can't be here anymore.
Harry chuckled again. "Alright, you want it," with a nod of his head, he ordered his bodyguard. "Put him in the trunk."
At that time, Draco thought that he was happy enough with his career and life. Why should he date if it would only take up his time? But he regretted it this time. If he did die in his sleep and reincarnated into someone else—he should have tried dating. He felt lost. Draco spent three days in Troya's body like a madman. He stays away from everyone and doesn't want to answer anything. Even so, he still forced himself to eat. For some reason—no matter how difficult the current situation—Draco didn't feel like dying.
Alastair also drew his sword, which looked different than any Draco had ever seen a Spartan soldier wield. The blade had a lightning-like glint, and the metallic color was dissimilar. Alastair swung it. Although they all clearly saw—if the tip of the blade didn't touch their armor in the slightest—about six soldiers within range were mysteriously thrown away.
The man then looked at Draco in confusion because Draco looked a little scared. "What's wrong?" he asked.
"Let him in. He's coming with me. I have an appointment with Harry at two," A deep voice next to Draco startled him.
"I... I feel cold..." Draco stammered as he gripped the edge of the blanket.
Draco tried not to be afraid. But his mind was getting more and more confused because he saw the man's eyes that seemed to be hypnotizing. "I'll let you know the fact that I can't love you," he declared, and he began to approach Harry.
"C'mon, baby boy. Ride me. Ride your Daddy." Harry rasps, breath hitched as he encourages the cute blonde to roll his hips back and forth, hands clutched tight onto Draco's plump butt, leaving fingerprints.
Draco flinched when he heard the words from the man he knew so well. He turned his head to the side, and he found Cedric sitting on a black horse. Well... his white horse had been given to Draco. Therefore, the brunette decided to use another horse.
"Sorry, did I say something wrong?" Draco asked quietly.
Draco immediately took another step back away from Harry, his heart racing, and started to feel scared. "Okay, I'll put it on, you get out of here first!" he shouted angrily at being forced to surrender, tears almost dripping from his eyes.
Draco had expected it, but hearing it straight from his husband's mouth was painful. He was indeed like a beautiful object to play with and then throw away when bored. Draco was grateful for constantly reminding himself never to expect to be in a real love affair with the God of War.
While walking, Draco pretended not to see the man. Maybe it would be easier if he acted that way. Just as Draco was about to cross the road, Harry pulled his hand, making Draco's body turned around and bumped into him.
. Draco's mind raged. So without thinking, Draco ran towards the window to jump. It was quite a distance and made him slip. He ran as fast as he could, and the man was suddenly in front of him.
And that's when Draco could see the canines slowly stretching out, ready to rip his skin off.
"You."
Besides, seeing Ares's envoys who were now in the Spartan Palace, Draco was hesitant. Were they really the envoy of God Ares? What if they were actually sent by kings or princes from other kingdoms whose proposals to Troya were often rejected by the king of Sparta? They could have claimed to be messengers of Ares, knowing that no king could oppose God.
"Yeah, of course, I wouldn't be so stupid as to compete with the Goddess of Beauty. Ares and I aren't even a couple," Draco replied.
Draco snorted, trying not to laugh. "Oh, Potter, how can you call that an honor?"
"I'm the God of Wine, so I'm familiar with the Greek way of partying, but the way you organize this party is different, like fruit piled up like that, or meat skewered by bamboo and grilled. I've never seen one," Dionysius scratched his chin.
"Harry against it?" Draco imagined a woman with a weak body but capable of challenging the entire world for the sake of the child she was carrying. What a strong and extraordinary woman.
But Ares couldn't force his horse to enter the dense Pine forest and walked around. The prince of Sparta could be dying. Even one second means a lot right now. Ares chose to leave Herion and continued his journey on foot. The over two-thousand-year-old god was confident in his running speed. He walked through the remaining narrow gap.
And when Draco lifted his head, Harry was already out of the room. Draco let out a deep breath. Was he wrong? But isn't everything Harry does out of lust? Harry was clearly passionate about Draco and wanted him. But after that, what will happen?
But Harry's strong arms held him, and then, Draco hunched his back and whimpered at the sensation. The sensation of the touch of Harry's lips and tongue, licking and sucking his cock, with his hot breath lingering. Heat meets heat, and he's on fire. Draco's gaze darkened with a sensation of unbearable pleasure.
With one swift motion, Draco could feel that his body was bent in a way that made Harry fucked him easier. His ass and hips were up in the air, and his body almost perfectly bent while Harry was drilling him at an unforgiving pace. He touched his stomach—it was now a little rounded instead of perfectly flat like before, Harry’s come swelling him up.
"I'm not defending anyone, Your Majesty," Draco stated without the slightest hesitation. "I'm just saying what I think is right. I don't want this endless bickering to destabilize the kingdom." Draco continued with his eyes fixed on Harry as if he wasn't afraid of his husband's piercing gaze.
The man tilted his head. He looked a little confused. "I don't want to know, and you must love me. Unless you will never leave this house."
"Prince of Sparta, would you like to have a romantic consultation with me? I am the God of Love. I think I can help you,"
"I know, Troya," Ares said calmly.
"Then I shouldn't have to ask your permission to kiss you, right?"
Ron and Harry didn't say much on the way back to the packhouse. Harry propped his elbows against the windshield, his eyes examining the streets and buildings that seemed to dart in the opposite direction as the car he was driving slashed through the slightly deserted streets.
"I can't go into details at this time," Ares responded again, shaking his head.
Legend has it that Ares, the God of War, was also involved in the war and was the one who accepted defeat.
"I wish I were in hell, but unfortunately, they say I'm not strong enough to live in hell." The man said with a sneer.
"Good evening, Your Majesty," Draco said politely as his husband finally turned into the wide-open door of a room. The entrance of his husband and Arabelle's room.
Draco furrowed his brows. "I just took a walk in the garden,"
Draco saw a flash of fire from Harry's green eyes and finally made him give up on convincing the immortal man. Draco decided to pace the room. He didn't know why he did that, but what was clear was the effect of the stress of not being able to get out of a place that was almost like a prison.
Draco thought for a moment that person named Cyllenius probably had a strong card in Troya's illness. It could be that he also holds information about how his soul could transfer to Troya's body. Draco knew this might be a waste of time, but he didn't want to take his fate for granted without struggling.
The first thing Draco noticed was, the sturdy building that stood tall in front of him looked unkempt and creepy. No other buildings were standing around it, only some wild bush that Hagrid, the keeper of the mansion, had probably just mowed down.
. Harry decided to himself.
"I didn't think Your Majesty would come. I think Your Majesty's neck still hurts," said Arabelle, which Draco replied with a smile.
Draco arrogantly cocked his chin. "Yes, I love to read, but the expensive books here are among the ones I cannot afford," Draco frowned.
Cedric's jaw tightened, the man's breath hitched when he heard Draco speak to him in formal sentences. Cedric didn't like that. The blonde's words seemed to explain that they had never had a close relationship.
Revised:
Harry's eyes were still scanning the files in his hand as if the news about Tom Riddle suddenly disappearing was not because of him. Of course, Harry had already made sure that Tom Riddle would never appear again after he planned to kill him, and it actually resulted in Draco, who had to be seriously injured and hospitalized.
"I'm hungry," Draco smiled cheekily.
"This is my lover's room," Harry finished Draco's sentence calmly. "Yes. You're my lover, Draco. You must accept that. You are here to satisfy my lust."
"In that case, we take our leave, Your Majesty. I hope Your Majesty enjoys your time in our little garden. If Your Majesty forgets the way back, Your Majesty just needs to follow the golden statue in this garden." The King said with a smile which Draco replied with a nod.
Many couples have come down to the dance floor in the ballroom. The ladies in their beautiful dresses and the gentlemen in their stiff suits collided elegantly on the dance floor. Apparently, they have too carried away with the romantic atmosphere created by that famous orchestra group that they didn't notice that a young man was staring at them with a sparkling gaze.
"Why don't you just leave?" Draco scowled.
"Look! There's a cobweb," Draco immediately felt an idiot. Ares chuckled and got up from his seat. He casually sat down next to his new wife and put his arm around him. Draco felt like jumping, but he didn't want to run either.
With a gentle smile on his face, Draco gave Terence an even look. He didn't like it when someone else brought Shinia's name into a vortex of trouble that even Shinia didn't care about.
Draco hugged Narcissa tightly, and he saw Harry, who was watching them. Draco didn't care how great that immortal man was or how strong Harry was. What Draco cared about now was his mother. He didn't want to be away from his mother and didn't want to leave her alone.
Is it true that it was just a dream?
"What do you mean?" Draco asked, confused.
racehorse from Turkmenistan, who was famous for being tough. However, he was also over fifty years old, and when he opened his mouth, one could see sharp fangs lined there. Herion eats meat and hates vegetables.
Harry enters, and Draco waits with anticipation. Harry was wearing a neat jet-black suit. His hair, which was slightly long that touched his collar, was slicked back, making him look like a handsome beast who was so charming.
"De-" Deco gulped. "Destruction," he replied. Of course, he didn't say the part when he saw Harry killed him.
Since then, he's been investigating everything related to Harry Potter, where he lives, what his schedule was, what he likes, or anything. All this information he carefully collected and compiled. When Draco got the information that Harry often spends time with his toys in this upscale club, the Amorist Club. Without thinking long, Draco left his job as a high school teacher, moved from his residence, and applied as a waitress here.
That night Draco fell asleep with a nightmare, where Harry kept saying that threat in his ear, that he would kill anyone who helped Draco and anyone who was off guard until Draco could escape. That sentence rang clearly throughout the night.
Draco looked away, suddenly saddened by how lucky Hermione was compared to him. The woman looked so happy and carefree. As for himself, he didn't even know what he means to Harry. Draco's eyes filled with tears as he imagined the failure of his plans to kill that man, which ended up trapped in the demon's embrace.
The young man had a new exciting activity. Draco was almost exasperated because he couldn't find anything interesting to do in Sparta's palace. He also made nicknames for those around him. Like his servants, whom he calls 'chatty pumpkin' or the King, which he calls 'crybaby dashing father', and his sister, whom he calls 'pug-faced dog' or 'bitchy mouth'.
Actually, Ares thought of something else. The Spartan prince had obviously succumbed to his touch and immediately gave up, but he held himself back not because of trivial emotional things or anything. He was hiding something from Ares. Something that might put his life in danger if Ares found out.
"Then answer my previous question," demanded Draco.
Of course, His action took Harry a little by surprise. He gave Draco a strange look. Seeing that strange look, Draco immediately cursed himself. He could usually forget the etiquette of a noble. After this, Harry would definitely look him the side-eye.
A gasp could be heard from there, and when Draco turned his head, the women appeared to be standing with their faces blushed, embarrassed by Harry's insult. Then for various reasons, they separate and choose to move to other places.
One of Harry's coldest-looking bodyguards walked in half an hour ago, carrying a tray of food, setting it on the table. Then without saying anything, go and lock the door back from the outside. During that long half an hour, Draco tried desperately not to glance at the alluring tray.
"I don't come here very often, but every time I pass through this forest, I will come here," Cedric explained.
"This forest is not your territory. Why are you here?! Did you sent the bull to me?!" snarled Ares, annoyed.
"What?!" Draco widened his eyes as if they were going to pop out of his head.
"Would—" Harry's gasping breath was a little erotic against Draco's lips, and Harry kissed him again. "Would I hurt you if I..."
"No. It's still breathing, even if only a few times. The royal healer can heal it,"
To be honest, Draco didn't like that.
"Ah, Your Majesty is here too? I didn't expect Your Majesty to be here," said Arabelle while trying to be as calm as possible and trying not to be influenced by Cedric's sharp gaze.
Draco opened his eyes and saw Harry, who was still holding his face in his hands. From here, Draco could see Harry's beautiful eyes. But then he remembered Harry's black eyes, and it made him shudder with horror. Draco immediately took Harry's hand off his face.
Wanting to save time, Draco put his dress and underwear right by the river.
"Later, I will catch up with you when I'm satisfied here."
"His Majesty and I got lost in the woods."
Ron hesitated to ask Harry about Draco. It seems too strange to discuss the matter here. But his wife — lovely Hermione — had made him promise to do it. Ron cleared his throat, drawing Harry's attention from the files he was groping through. "My wife and I met your lover last night."
She trotted over to Draco with all four of her charming legs, then reached out to shake his hand. "I'm Hadreda. Are you the Prince of Sparta?" She said, introducing herself.
Draco's eyes then fixed on Luna, who was scribbling her book with a pencil. Draco sat beside Luna and put down his guitar. Luna looked at him with a smile, then glanced at the guitar.
"I'm grateful, but I won't have any reaction to it at this time," Ares responded as if he didn't care.
"Yeah, and I'm warning you, Aphrodite. Don't think about hurting him as you did to Psyche. I decided to get married myself." Ares looked into his lover's eyes seriously. In the past, Aphrodite was very jealous of Psyche's beauty which was said to be more than her, and Aphrodite planned many evil things to hurt the girl.
Draco was surprised to find out that Alastair was the real grandson of Ares. Thinking about it one more time had made Draco realize that he was indeed married to a nearly 2000-year-old man.
"I found your body covered in wounds and losing a lot of blood." Draco could feel the dark atmosphere rising from Vlad's body. His presence looked really threatening and intimidating. "I gave you my blood."
The Crown Prince chuckled amusedly when he saw that the husband of his dance partner tonight had hurried out of the ballroom.
"What if Potter's whore conceived and gave birth to a son? Potter, who loved his whore so much, would adopt the boy as his heir, considering his
"Maybe later, but not now," Ares blurted out.
"Hadreda?"
"Do you have another solution, Hera?"
"I'm Draco's husband. He has to take the same carriage as me." Harry said and stared at Draco, who had been putting on a calm face.
I'm afraid I don't care what you think."
"If Your Majesty doesn't mind, may I ask for your dance?" asked Charles with adoring eyes.
Miracles sometimes happen at the last second.
An heir.
"No! I will never bear the child of a man I don't love. Even if you were to kill me, I would never do it." Draco said stubbornly as he steeled his shaky heart.
He could see Harry walking towards them from behind Cedric's back with a sinister look on his face. The king seemed to have prepared himself to draw his sword at the enemy in front of his eyes.
"Harry!" A shrill shout that slightly hurt the ears managed to make Harry's anger and irritation evaporate. There, he saw Arabelle running towards him with a smile on her lips.
"Troya... Oh, Troya... Look at your beauty that can compete with Aphrodite, your long silvery blonde hair, and your graceful footsteps. No matter where people look, you are the most beautiful man in Greece. But why is your destiny so unfortunate?" The Queen knelt while crying on the floor.
There was an amused glint in Harry's green eyes. "What, Draco? I can't hear you,” Harry did it on purpose, and Draco growled in exasperation.
Draco gasped. Father, he said. Does that mean that man was a god? Draco immediately lowered his head.
Several times a month, the planetarium takes advantage of astronomical events such as the appearance of comets, meteor showers, or unique phenomena on the moon to invite residents to take turns looking at the sky with telescopes.
How funny.
"Do you know the red patch on Arabelle's neck earlier?" Draco asked seriously.
Harry strode hastily up the stairs with an enraged growl, slamming his feet with every step, violently opening the bedroom door. His eyes flared, and he was ready to fight and found Draco sitting on the couch, had changed into his pajamas, also reading a book.
Ugh! Draco really wanted that sword! He clutched his two satin gloves when he saw Cedric had started to fight the last guard to win the preliminaries. The sound of swords clashing so beautifully made Draco's amazement soar even more.
Draco's heart was pounding. His eyes widened at Cedric. His mind was suddenly confused. The blonde couldn't even think straight. He didn't realize that Cedric kept walking around his corner until Draco felt a stinging pain in his neck.
Carefully, he drew the arrow. After the arrow was pulled, he immediately used the handkerchief in his trouser pocket to bandage the poor bird's wings as it was starting to bleed.
Cedric chuckled a little as he saw Draco's face that looked so adorable in his eyes. With a swift motion, his hand reached out to lightly pinch Draco's chin.
"You're going to make yourself sick," Harry began to growl, apparently holding back his anger.
"Have you lost your mind?! You want to challenge the God of War?!"
Deftly, Harry shifted Draco's sleeping position from sideways to supine. Harry was a little grateful that his wife didn't seem bothered by Harry's actions. He seemed to be very tired.
Arabelle giggled lightly as she received a steady stream of passionate kisses from Harry's lips on top of her head. The lovebirds were busy laughing until the girl in the man's arms caught the very familiar figure of a servant.
"What's wrong?" Draco asked when Harry groaned again. His fingers gently rubbed Harry's shoulders and back, which were now smooth with soap.
"Don't play dumb! You know I love you! How long are you going to ignore me, huh?!" Cedric's yell echoed in front of Draco's beautiful face. "Until when?!?" His shout was accompanied by the sound of lightning striking so violently.
"Athena will pay for everything after what she did to me, but before that…" Harry lifted Draco's chin to stare at his baby gray eyes that were already wet with tears. "Before that, I'll take you first, darling."
"Go home!"
Alden looked deeply at Draco. “You should know that
The man then lowered Draco on the roof of the building. Unbelievable, he led Draco to the top of the building. Draco was afraid of heights, and if that man was his guardian angel, he should have kept Draco away from something that could give him a heart attack.
"Draco," Harry growled as he felt Draco's hot, smooth, and so tightly wrapped body, teasing him to reach the fastest possible gratification. But no, tonight for Draco. Harry wanted Draco to remember every second of their sex tonight.
Draco seemed to be pacing back and forth in his room, and Harry was staring at the young man with interest. Then Draco moved to open his clothes. Harry swallowed hard, glanced around his deserted surroundings, and started to feel uneasy about making himself a pervert peeping-tom peering into the silhouette of a man changing his clothes.
Harry watched again as the soft, slender hand reached for the tall glass of golden liquid that the bartender had brought to him ten minutes ago, brought the neck of the glass so gently against his red lips, and sipped the clear liquid so gracefully, Harry subconsciously tightened his grip in his whiskey glass.
Ron's eyes opened, staring at Hermione curiously. "Who?"
"You are Seraphim. When I say you are Seraphim, then you are Seraphim." The man then turned his gaze towards the bed.
“Please what,
Harry nodded faintly as the man lifted himself up. He stepped in quick motion towards the small house near the guards' training area, a special treatment house for the guards injured while doing the practices.
"I will treat you kindly, not as a prisoner, but as my lover. I think we can have a pretty good working relationship."
Harry's refusal managed to make the happy smile that graced Arabelle's lips disappear instantly. The girl in the light pink dress looked at the king with a confused look.
Everything is useless.
Draco's body shook violently as the wind hit him. It's cold. Draco would have chosen to run along with Cedric if he had known it would end like this. No, he would refuse Cedric's invitation to wander around in the wilderness like this.
"I think red is prettier, sweetheart." the man said, making Draco gasp — unconsciously dropping a rose between his fingers. His body froze for a moment as he stared at the man in front of him.
"What kidnappers claim to be kidnappers? If they confess, then hell will be not pleased..." said the man.
"I thought I was going to marry a crybaby and timid prince. It turns out you're quite mature even though you're still very young,"
Draco had been conquered in the enchantment of Harry's fabulously skillful desire. And now that fear is all over him, what if in the end he gives up and happily becomes a bitch who's willing to be Harry's lover, kneeling at that man's feet like any other woman?
For several hours on the journey to Olympus—Draco was busy observing all the messengers. The first was Attica. Although she seems fierce, she turns out to be very friendly and soft-spoken. She seems to try to be on par with the men around her and refuses if they try to help her.
"I didn't approach him. He was the one who always appeared and somehow found out where I was. And who the
Glenice grimaced in worry when she heard her queen utter crazy words with such ease. "It's done, Your Majesty," Glenice pulled herself up as she finished styling Draco's hair.
"Yes, I plan to ride a horse. The distance from this forest to the Delion kingdom is not too far. I want to enjoy this short torturous journey." Draco explained.
"Yes, Your Majesty," Draco said as he nodded his head obediently.
He didn't want to wait for the King to decide his fate. Draco doesn't know how he got to go. Perhaps he would never meet Ares' messenger. The palace of Sparta was heavily guarded, especially since the misfortune that befell Troya. Although he felt free to roam all this time, he always saw a guard watching him. Hector actually didn't need to escort him yesterday.
"Oh, is that so? Sorry, I'll try to do better later," Draco was disappointed and back lowered his head.
"I love you, my dear. Wake up."
"My apologies, Alpha. However, this doesn't seem right." Draco pushed his hand away. "I am not your soulmate."
"Arrest that woman!" The king shouted, the Spartan soldiers immediately blocked her.
"Alright! Alright, Athena! I'll think about it. Now go! I'll call you if I need you!" Zeus said.
Cedric chuckled. One of his freed hands moved to caress the top of Draco's head gently. "No, you always look beautiful in my eyes. Whether you wear makeup or not," Cedric said honestly.
Their queen looks very gentle in their eyes, and whoever hurts their queen, they will never be silent.
Harry grinned even wider. "You get nervous when you're around me. Don't you, Malfoy?" he turned to face Draco.
"Looks like his condition has improved," Alden said, trying to look casual even though he knew what his master had just done to Draco. "We've investigated the culprit."
"Scared, Malfoy?" Harry uttered sarcastically. “You are afraid that you will give up in my arms, aren't you? I offered you here earlier, wanted to see how far you dare to be alone with me in the same room, it turns out that you run away afraid like a rabbit to be eaten."
Harry realized that he really shouldn't underestimate Tom because Tom has important friends behind his dirty business. Based on his subordinates' investigations, the man was linked to an illegal weapons syndicate and underground groups.
But not quite as handsome as Potter. Draco gasped and quickly dispelled his ridiculous thought.
"Oh, are you guys from another land?"
"Here you are. I've been looking for you everywhere!" snapped Cedric with an unfriendly face.
Why didn't Harry ever defend himself and let him run wild with his emotions and blind anger?
Harry is now standing in the middle of Draco and Luna. His face was still expressionless.
"My birthday present," Draco replied.
"Oh, yeah? Who do you think it's all about?"
Armageddon or Harmagedon usually refers to the end of the world's prophecy or the apocalypse due to the great war. In this story, Armageddon is a prophecy of the apocalypse caused by the war between angels and demons.
He looked at a dark brown horse that looked so striking compared to the others. The horse looked so fresh compared to the other horses tied with it as if it had indeed prepared itself to serve its master on this still chilly morning. Slowly but surely, Draco stepped closer to the dark brown horse. Arriving in front of the horse, his hand reached out to gently stroke the top of the horse's head.
It's a leech! He immediately raised his hand to pull the leech off the white horse's hooves without the slightest bit of fear or disgust. The horse let out a small cry at Draco's rough movement.
"Yes, Your Majesty," Draco nodded obediently.
Draco couldn't help but scream as his horse panicked by the earthquake now galloped off in an unsteady direction—separating himself from the envoys. Then took him to a dark part of Olympus, which was not at all friendly to humans like himself.
Being lost in his daydreams, suddenly, the door to the room opened. Draco didn't even turn his head. Because who came into this room was always only Alden delivering food, and the maids who cleaned the room and brought him a change of clothes — of course, under Alden's supervision.
With short of breath, Draco released himself from Harry's embrace.
"We're on duty, Lasonas. I can't let my guard down. The Spartans might still be after us," Attica stated firmly.
Draco stared in disbelief. Cedric repeated the words that had been troubling Draco's heart for so long.
"You are the killer of my parents," Draco gave Harry a hateful look. "And to me, it is an unforgivable sin. I will always blame you for it. I hate you more than anything else."
Draco shook his head, too taken aback by everything that seemed so sudden.
But Harry didn't budge. The man grits his teeth in anger. "I'm not leaving. Your chance is already time out. I was kind enough to give you the opportunity to join the party and wear nice clothes. Now hurry up and put on that dress,” Harry didn't raise his voice at all, but the anger in his voice crept into the air and forced Draco to do what he wanted.
"Time for us to go, my love." the man whispered, causing Draco to start screaming and rebelling, attempting to break free from the grip of the merciless, brutal God of War.
"You are very quiet, prince of Sparta. I wish I could hear your voice," Ares rebuked him, who now turned his face the other way. Apart from being afraid of being found out that he was blushing, Draco was ashamed of his current dirty and soil-stained condition.
All of Draco's actions did not escape one particular man's eyes, emitting tremendous anger. That male tried to suppress his anger, but he couldn't, much less to see the woman he loved chatting so happy with his own father. For some reason, that man wanted to vent the anger and jealousy that had burned his heart.
A happy smile graced Arabelle's face as soon as she heard Draco's words. This trip was Arabelle's first trip after she entered this magnificent palace. Really, Arabelle didn't think that she could spend time with Harry on her first trip.
Had Draco done something wrong again?
Alastair exchanged glances with his five comrades. Then the female envoy nodded and looked at the terrified Draco. She grabbed his slender arm and drew her sword.
"Because of you! Because of how stubborn you are!"
Draco realized that there was now a thick forest with towering pines and a wide enough path to enter in front of him.
Ares was the God of War. Just mentioning his name made the majority of Greeks tremble with fear. That God was known to be bloodthirsty and like to start a war. Challenging anyone to fight and temperamental. Not only that, but he also had an affair with Aphrodite so many times that they gave birth to many children.
Draco was in a lot of pain and turned to look at his arm. It was already wrapped in a very thick bandage. The pain was still there but more from the deep trauma from the bad experience.
Draco snorted in disbelief. Because of that man, Draco's mood was broken. It seemed he would stop reading the vulgar novel and resume it when the moon was shining brightly. No one would disturb him at night so that Draco could absorb every neatly written sentence in the vulgar novel. With a light motion, Draco took the book from under his pillow.
All right, Draco will stay on his feet!
"Should I say goodbye first?"
"Draco, please hold on!"
But as soon as he remembered Elle's name, it all vanished. Draco didn't know why saying that name made him feel sick and angry. And that made him wonder, who is Elle? Why does Vlad always say her name?
If this were all just a setting, the producers would have gone crazy. First, he will make his company went bankrupt. Second, they had broken the law by doing all that to him. Kidnapping and drugging and the application of plastic surgery without consent. All of that was enough to keep them imprisoned for a long time. Moreover, just for a prank event, that was not how much profit. That doesn't make any sense at all.
Internally, Draco grimaced a little. That older man, was he blind or deaf? How could he not know that Harry had a mistress whom he loved so much? In fact, the news had been widely discussed by the high-class nobles. He should have known, even though the information was often discussed in secret.
And as expected, Cedric looked directly at Draco with sparkling eyes. The chance to take Draco away from a formal party like this was a rare opportunity for Cedric. Remembering that the Empress always felt comfortable sitting in his throne from the first guest to the last guest.
"Can't I go to my wife's room?" Harry looked at Draco in surprise.
Draco felt uncomfortable hearing that. All his life, he used to be independent. Relying on an established man while he only needed to be by his side while remaining graceful and beautiful never sounded comfortable to his eyes. Because of that, maybe he never dated for long because those who approached him were men with more successful and established careers than him.
"No big deal, you say? Bringing humans to Olympus is an offense. Besides, you picked up that boy by announcing your status as the God of War, Ares!" Hera responded angrily.
Draco's body clung weakly to Harry's arm, and then his breath caught in his throat. "Hot... Please... It's so hot...” Once again, Draco confirmed the voice, the sound of heat, as if tortured.
"Draco... trust me, we'll be fine. We just need to take it slow without anyone knowing, that's all."
If Draco looks around, it's not just his clothes that are weird, this room is just as weird. The rooms are old-fashioned with only candlelight to light them. There is a large bed with tall pillars covered with a mosquito net attached beautifully, making Draco tempted to sleep there.
"Okay, I know, let me look for him. You guys just stay where you are because some of you are injured. I want us all to return to my palace safely." He said after heard and understand the situation Alastair conveyed.
"It's just that you need to know that your fate and future life depend on your own decisions. This was Olympus. You will be safe as long as you are in my palace and with me, but it is different if you leave my palace. I don't like people who disobey, so when you speak, you have to do it."
Harry and Icarus groaned in pain, and they finally released their grip on each other. Icarus stood up and adjusted his clothes. Harry also stood up, glared at Draco, and just disappeared. Draco didn't care if the man was angry. Soon he will be free of him.
Glenice was Draco's personal servant when the young man officially became queen of this kingdom. Five years was not a short time. Glenice has almost understood the intricacies of her queen's life because of her queen's openness to her.
He silently cursed himself as he was holding back his frustration. All because he couldn't contain his hatred.
"But you are his wife,"
Draco was afraid of being banished to the dangerous forest of Olympus. He still hopes to return to his old body in the future. He still needs time. He thought everything would be fine, but this time Ares didn't smile at him.
"May I have your first dance of the night, Your Majesty?" asked the crown prince of the Delion Kingdom politely as he bowed and held out one hand to Draco.
"You crazy! Hurry up and get me out of here!" Draco cried.
Draco surely will die just from having sex.
Honestly, because Harry was whispering, Draco couldn't hear what he was saying. "What did you say?"
Herion's paces stopped for a moment, and he panicked a little because the two of them met something that gave off an intimidating aura—a Cyclops sitting in the middle of the path while looking at them.
He had to break free from Harry's clutches because he was frightened. Yes, Draco was terrified that the longer he was around Harry, the sooner he'll bend his knees beneath Harry's feet, falling into the devil's charm. Draco just needs someone to help him. Can Doctor Jason help him?
"Last night was you and Lord Ares' first night. Usually, the lovers wouldn't be too comfortable after—"
Draco looked back at himself in the mirror. Why does Draco feel like he is in ancient times?
"Shut your mouth, Cedric! She's not a whore! She's my woman! I'm free to visit her!" Harry shouted, which made Draco flinch in surprise.
so Draco had to be
"Hey," Harry called, breaking Draco's thoughts and turning to look at him. "You really didn't notice, did you?" he asked, looking straight ahead. He couldn't bear to pay attention to the pair of gray irises.
"I'll take a look." Harry stepped into the white room and found Draco lying weakly on the bed. That kid was really stubborn. "Why don't you eat your food?" Harry hissed in anger. "Do you want to kill yourself?"
"What a good boyfriend," a soft voice was heard behind him.
"You have me. I'm your guardian angel. You don't have to worry," Icarus said with a smile. "You just need to stay away from Potter, so the demons don't come too much. Potter is like a beacon for calling the demons out, so you should stay away from him."
"Didn't I tell you I would definitely come back to you, Aphrodite?" Ares smiled reassuringly.
Someone also raised their hand. "I don't think so, because the devil has an ugly face," he said, and everyone laughed except Draco, Luna, and Harry.
“Your father hid this from his family. He doesn't want your mother and you to be worried," Alden sighed. "You may not believe me, but let me tell you first, then you can decide. Whatever your acceptance later, I will not mind, for sure there is not the slightest lie from me to you." Alden's eyes wandered into the past as he began to tell the story. “Your father came to master Harry at the time, asking for an injection of funds and a cooperation agreement. Master Harry wasn't really interested, and he was prepared to refuse flatly. Your father's company, which has completely collapsed due to disorganized management, will require an enormous amount of money and attention to fix things up. But then your father made an offer to master Harry."
All the guests and the royal members instantly drank their wines. After that, the ballroom was again filled with voices belonging to the guests. They started to enjoy the party that the King of the Delion Kingdom was throwing.
"What are you doing? Want to come to take a shower with me?" Draco asked sarcastically. "If you dare to go into the bathroom or are suddenly in the bathroom, you will suffer the consequences!" he threatened, showing his fist.
"You're scared, Potter, you're afraid I hurt this young man, I can see it in your eyes," Doctor Jason looked at Harry with a crazy smile, fiddling with his knife around Draco's neck. "Just one cut, I will cut his veins, right in the neck, the blood will gush out, and he will die quickly, right in front of your eyes, and I am willing to die for the satisfaction of watching that scene."
When Harry pulled himself carefully away from Draco and lay next to him with his arms still tight around his body, Draco was too tired to move. What a magnificent heavenly dream, Draco sighed to himself, still tingling with the lingering remnants of such a satisfying pleasure.
Luna took off her weird glasses, and her eyes now settled on Draco without something covering it. "You kissed a guy you just met?" she asked with a giggle.
The thought of ice cubes made Draco bothered. His throat was dry, but he refused to drink from the earthenware jars in the palace because the hot temperature has made the water warm. He also saw a stream that sounded gurgling not far from the olive tree he was under.
✧･ﾟ: ✧･ﾟ✧ :･ﾟ✧･ﾟ✧
Draco winced at the statement. If only his instincts hadn't ordered his legs to retreat backward, it would have been certain by now his neck would have been covered in blood.
"The kingdom might be able to issue a new regulation that requires all linen buyers to pay 5% more than the linen they buy. A kind of tax, however, the money the kingdom earns from selling linen will only be distributed to the flax craftsmen, who have sent their linen to the kingdom," Draco explained smoothly.
If only the young woman had not been chirping about herself embroidering roses, maybe Draco wouldn't have known what his husband's mistress was currently embroidering.
25/08/2021
"Why?"
Draco stayed silent. He didn't know what cruel thing he wanted to say to Cedric so he could understand that the love he gave to Draco would be in vain. Draco remained sitting where he was when he saw Cedric taking quick steps to leave his room.
“Master Harry is currently in Italy. There's some urgent business over there.” Alden shifted his seat to make it more comfortable. "I should have told you this from the start, but master held me back."
"Then?" Draco blinked.
"Where do you think you're going?" Harry asked, clearly irritated despite the attention he was paying to Draco's smooth skin. It looked like the predator had come back to play. "I told you I was going to punish you. This was just the beginning, darling."
"For getting you into this situation," the man shrugged. "A situation like this will be inevitable, considering my condition. But you must know that when you are with me, I will take care of you."
"In me, Daddy. Please, I want you in me." Draco begs, wrapping his legs tight around Harry's waist.
Implied torture and blood
The man ducks slightly, pressing his lips to Draco's full, pink ones, slipping his tongue inside that small, hot mouth. "Cummin' baby-! Oh, fuck...
"Let him go, Hyde." Harry's voice sounded cold, trying to contain his anger under control. The man was holding the knife near Draco. He didn't want Draco to get hurt more than this.
"You cheated," Draco said weakly. "I saw you before sunset."
"No, we just haven't been in a situation like this before. This is probably the first time the Titans have taken humans to Olympus. Usually, gods like Apollo, Zeus, or Ares come to their own lovers. This is their personal business," Attica replied.
Oh God, even his smell was intoxicating.
There was a certain satisfaction for him when he conquered the humans who interested him. He's also not a complete jerk either because while he often seduces different humans—he makes sure he doesn't hook up with more than one human simultaneously.
Draco wanted this horse. He was just about to turn around and announce to his entourage that he wanted the dashing-looking brown horse, but the sound of a horse suddenly shrieking made Draco stop in his tracks.
Draco bit his lower lip when he saw Harry's reaction. He was afraid that Harry would reject his proposal because it made Draco feel that he had failed to be a wise queen to all his people.
A young woman in a pink dress with a large ribbon on her waist ran into the room without noticing the presence of two figures who had filled the room. Her face was decorated with clear crystals. Without saying anything, the girl in the pink dress immediately threw her ass right on Harry's lap.
"Aphrodite!" Ares rebuked the Goddess of Beauty.
"Quiet short, but you don't have to worry. Olympus is a lot of fun. If Ares pleases, you can even take a walk to another city. You won't get bored living there," Lasonas responded.
"Draco," Harry made his characteristic menacing voice. “Don't challenge me. You know I'm not in the mood to argue with you, I'm in a bad mood, and I'm sick of all your resistance. So don't try to provoke my patience. "
"Good, let me know when it's done."
"Oh, so your wings are portable?" Draco asked again.
Harry’s eyes snaked down Draco’s body, lingering on his lower half. He whistled. “I completely ruin you for anyone else, huh?”
Draco seemed to think a little when he heard Cedric's words. Having made up his mind, without saying anything, Draco immediately dismounted the white horse.
Hearing that, Harry grunted loudly and leaned back against the car seat, hoping this would all be over soon.
"Ah!" Draco let out a small shriek as his body felt like it was about to limp because his feet had accidentally been tied to the bushes. Cedric, trained to be alert, immediately put his hand on Draco's back and restrained the queen from swaying.
With a growl, he pulled Cedric's back so that he couldn't help but turn Cedric's body away from Draco.
Doctor Jason laughed at Draco's futile attempt to escape, then pushed Draco's chair against the wall and pressed the knife against Draco's cheek. "This knife is very sharp," Doctor Jason played the knife against Draco's cheek. "I doubt Potter would still want to make you his whore if your face is damaged." He placed the cold iron on Draco's cheek, causing Draco's eyes to close in fear.
"A-Ares..." Draco's lips spoke softly again, trying to initiate a negotiation, "I..."
Ares doesn't employ human servants at all. The few Demigods were also mainly used as knights. The majority of Demigods served Ares because he was the most capable god to make them formidable warriors.
Draco's short answer made Cedric race his horse quickly. The journey that should have felt long and a little boring became unnoticed. In front of them, Draco could see a field of blue flowers that looked stunning, although he had not seen the flowers up close.
"That's what I want to ask you. Who are you?" asked Harry, folding his arms over his chest. His muscles were bulging from under the shirt he was wearing.
"Don't look for any other evidence that Potter likes Pansy again, Dray," Blaise said, sounding serious, which couldn't help but make Draco finally give up on his analysis.
Draco could still pick up on Harry's harsh words, but he tried to remain calm and put on his clothes in gentle motions as best he could. He didn't know whether Harry was cursing because he was too slow to wear an item of clothing or because Draco had worn the king's clothes.
"And he just agreed? Wow, you have a submissive wife, Ares. I'm guessing he's quite pleasant in bed," Aphrodite commented sarcastically.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco vomited a lot of water and coughed in pain. His lungs were still aching and throbbing. Who is the helper? Was he really not allowed to die? The strong hand continued to press until all the liquid was pumped out of his stomach. Draco's eyes grew blurry, his consciousness fading away as the voice sounded calm above him.
Doctor Jason walked over to Harry and tried to explain. "He's fine, Mr. Potter. We've stitched up the wound on his head. But he lost a lot of blood, and we are currently looking for blood from a nearby provider…”
Harry stood that night in the middle of the garden in front of his house, hoping the cold air would soothe his desire that had set his body on fire. He stared at Draco's window on the second floor.
Draco felt the silver bracelet on his left wrist. It was a gift that Ares supposedly gave him through the vulture that broke through the palace yesterday afternoon. He didn't expect that Ares' envoy would arrive so soon. They had come in two chariots and entered the gates of the Spartan palace less than half an hour ago.
"Don't make too many excuses," argued Pansy, to which Blaise nodded in agreement. "Honestly, we've both thoughts about it," Pansy's tone suddenly sounded more serious than before.
"No, you own this place. I should have relented." Draco insisted.
"Okay, I'm still confused. Can you tell me about the Titans? Who are you? Why are you different from us?"
"I meant that, but I don't think I'll be able to ignore you," Ares said quietly as he placed his palm softly on the prince's cheek. "I'm not comfortable with the fact that your existence has bothered me, Troya." Ares continued.
Silence greeted Draco and Cedric. Only the sound of the wind and the rustling of leaves could be heard. He was busy admiring the beauty in front of him until he felt Cedric staring intently at his face from the side. He turned his head to look at Cedric.
“You live here in extravagance, treated like a prince, respected like the lover of Harry Potter, and I am fed up with your behavior that always challenged me every chance you got. Now it's your only choice, and you will decide now. You choose me, or you would rather be thrown to my bodyguards?"
"You said that the gods are now more civilized. They don't force or rape. Really?"
Their stubbornness was not just out of love or desire. But also their form of resistance to Zeus' arbitrariness. Aphrodite still holds grudges for being forced to marry Hephaestus. Ares also feels that his parents always feel neglected and belittled.
The hallway on the second floor was dark, but there was a white light at the end. Maybe it's the kitchen, Draco thought silently. He then took a careful step toward the light and was led to a slightly ajar door at the end of the hall. Draco opened it and was stunned. This isn't a kitchen. He was about to turn around when his eyes fixed on something, and his face turned pale.
Seeing his brother who really defended his mistress made Cedric couldn't help but feel rage. He also looked at his brother with a sharp gaze. "I pushed her because she didn't want to respect me. Don’t think because she's the King's mistress; she can behave as she please." Cedric lied with his cold tone.
"He asked me to love him. He thinks love can come suddenly and be forced," Draco grumbled, then took a sip of his lemonade.
Without saying anything, Harry immediately threw Arabelle's hand from his arm a little rough. The king took wide strides toward one of the unmounted horses. Obviously, that guy didn't want to be in the same carriage as Cedric.
Revised:
"I'm sleepy. Let's go to your room now,"
Do leave some feedback if you have some. I will appreciate it so much.
Draco knew his husband was waiting for Arabelle, so that he couldn't do anything. He could only gulp down the wine the servant had poured back on him. Actually, he's bored. This was so rare. Maybe it was because Draco felt that this party was a little useless for his prestige.
There was no glint of nervousness or bewilderment in Draco's eyes. He sighed when he heard Cedric's words. Without saying anything, Draco took a step away from Cedric. Even though Draco was eager to be in love with someone, if that man were Cedric, of course, it would be the wrong choice.
"I want to do it. I'm not naive, Ares. I know very well that one day you will leave me. That's why I have to prepare for it. I love living in your palace, I have friends, and they treat me well. I know someone said that I wouldn't be allowed to stay here for long as a human. When you are not tired of me, you will protect me, but if you ignore me, someone will force me to leave. I have nowhere to go back, so I think this is a reasonable request." Draco explained.
"No, Your Majesty! Besides, when we left earlier, His Royal Highness immediately chased away all the maids who were there."
In a simple but beautiful dress, Draco sat in a chair that he had deliberately placed right in front of the glass window of his room in the Delion Kingdom palace. Draco looked up at the beautiful night sky, occasionally decorated by a flash of marvelous lightning.
The door opened, and Alden entered. "Ready?" The cold-faced bodyguard raised his eyebrows slightly at Draco's appearance, but his face remained flat. "Master Harry is waiting downstairs."
The question that came so easily from Cedric's mouth made Draco's eyebrows knit together. He didn't even think Cedric would ask a question he could already answer for himself.
"You don't want to do it?"
Draco tilted his pretty head. What did Ares mean? Did his protests the other day scorch Ares' interest in him for good? But if that was true, why would Ares still want to carry Draco to his room and hug him?
The whisper made Draco jolt out of sleep. The sky was already dark when the man woke up. He reached for his cell phone. It was getting late. The room was pitch black, only a faint moonlight penetrated the window.
Draco sighed tiredly to see his beloved son's room falling apart again with all kinds of dolls and toys scattered on the floor.
, citrus slices, and bread baggage. The presentation is beautiful, like a stretch of desert on a plate complete with an exotic atmosphere.
The familiar voice made Draco immediately tilt his head up. His eyes collided with the emerald eyes of the man who was currently riding the horse valiantly.
Harry stepped closer, stood in front of the sofa where Draco was and stared at him intently. "I think we've reached an agreement."
"God has the right to take my life, not a devil like you!!" Draco screamed, trying to defy him even though his heart was racing even faster with extreme fear.
"Yes, I'm Troya," Draco found it odd because it wasn't his real name. "Just calling you Ares? No need for 'your highness Ares' or 'Lord Ares'?" The boy confirmed carefully.
Because of the cold, he didn't want to stay in there for long. Draco drowned himself quickly and rose quickly as well. In that instant, his lips turned pale.
"Huh?" Draco blinked in confusion.
"Are you ready, Your Majesty?" Cedric asked formally when he saw Draco step closer to him.
Draco wiped his tears and glared at Alden. "So, that's why Harry kept me here? Because my face looks like his late wife?”
Ron had a serious look on his face. Watching him, Harry hoped his partner's head wasn't blowing smoke. "I think it's necessary. You in this region are known as the Alpha of the largest pack and are well known by many. It will give a strange impression if you don't come."
"Don't you hate me?"
And, the happiness inside Cedric was getting more and more intense when he again managed to enjoy another side of Draco that no one would ever see. Even Cedric was sure his husband wouldn't know about that other side. Cedric felt relieved and proud because he was the only person Draco trusted to see all his emotions.
"Of course, there are some men who are willing. Sometimes it's better to have an affair like that." Cedric replied, cornering Draco.
Harry raised an eyebrow, and for the first time, Draco managed to threaten him. He really didn't follow Draco into the bathroom. Draco was ready if Harry had dared to peek at him in the bathroom.
Draco stared straight into Terence's face. The man was very to the point, and more impressively, he said something that sounded personal to a queen who was his royal guest.
Draco turned his head to find Harry standing at the balcony door, staring at him calmly. The man seemed to have recently come home from work. Draco didn't know because from this balcony; the only view was the backyard and the large swimming pool.
Without paying any respects and without the slightest smile on his face, Draco turned around. Something Draco had never done.
"That's the God of War; killing a monster bull alone, impressive." There was a cynical clapping sound near Ares.
"His Majesty?! Did he hurt you?!" Draco asked with his voice starting to rise when he heard Arabelle's words.
Draco only grunted in return, although he couldn't help but enjoy the gentle treatment Harry was giving him. Honestly, it was strange, bizarre, yet it feels good at the same time.
Draco didn't even have the will to go back to his house. He wanted to go somewhere. Anywhere. He didn't want to go back, no matter where it was. He just wanted to disappear from this world. His footsteps stopped in front of a building and trying to raise his hand to press the doorbell.
"But what if the Oracle is telling the truth? God Ares' messenger will arrive in three days to get Troya." The King said.
"I'm really looking forward to our fight, Your Majesty."
"Potter... Hurry, send me back. The police will suspect me if I simply disappear," Draco pleaded.
»»-———— ♡♡♡ ————-««
Draco was surprised, of course. It wasn't unusual for Harry to hold him by the waist when many people didn't surround them, but as much as possible, Draco remained casual, acting as if he was used to Harry's touch on his body.
"Ah, yes. Thank you, Your Majesty." Said Draco. Harry started to walk his feet towards the soft lounger not far from the bed.
"Daphne!" Harry's voice was a little loud when he called out to the petite make-up.
"Glenice... they will speak one-on-one. If there are servants there, they no longer speak one-on-one but many-eyes." Draco joked as he laughed heartily.
"Then? What's new?"
“I think he is ready, not to surrender to you, but ready to kill you. His eyes are those of murderous hatred."
"It is nothing!" Harry had managed to calm himself down, and then he looked straight ahead again.
Draco's cheeks flushed at the insults that were being thrown at him blatantly.
I knew that this was all true!" The boy exclaimed.
Harry couldn't help but smile in amusement as he saw Arabelle wearing a crown of fresh flowers over her thick black hair. Really, his
"All right, Your Majesty."
Prince Cedric, in his night robe, walked hastily to Draco. Ignoring Harry's presence in the lounge chair, Cedric led himself to sit on Draco's side of the bed. Cedric's strong hands moved to cup his pale face in a gentle motion.
Harry asked, repeating his sentence.
"Your Majesty, why are you still here?" Draco asked as he saw Harry sitting doing nothing on the lounger.
Draco doesn't believe Harry a little, or maybe Draco never believed him.
"Offer?"
Ares stopped kissing. "Huh?" He couldn't believe his ears.
Draco stomped his feet a little and walked over to the sofa. He picked up one of the books on the shelf and sat down, trying to make himself comfortable.
Cedric's heart skipped a beat when his sense of smell caught the fresh scent of roses wafting from Draco's long blonde hair. After all, Cedric could go crazy just because of the smell of that beautiful hair!
When Draco opened his eyes, he was in the same room he woke up for the first time. Draco smelled the pillow again, and it was the same. Draco ran towards the door and opened it slowly because he was afraid the man would see him again. And yes, the man was drinking a can of soda. Before the man looked at him, Draco had closed the door.
Harry was immediately filled with emotion from a very close distance. His jaw tightened hard. With his eyes already glaring sharply at his brother's back, Harry decided to get up from his seat and approach the brunette.
After serving the noble’s continuous conversations at the party, Draco finally stepped aside from the crowd. Honestly, Draco still really wanted to talk to them a little longer, but when they brought the topic of wealth into their conversation, Draco couldn’t help rolling his eyes in annoyance.
Cedric gasped unconsciously. The man stepped back. Draco, who kept looking at him with a sharp gaze without the slightest remorse, made the man's heart feel like a sharp object was piercing it. It hurts.
"However, I'm looking forward to the good news from the Shinia Kingdom. I'm looking forward to the babies from Your Majesty and His Majesty."
who dreams of having the Emperor all to herself."

"I should have guessed this, with a very beautiful face and a husband who doesn't love you, it's impossible if there are no members of the royal family who have a crush on you, Your Majesty," Terence crooked a smile.
They?
"Where is Goddess Hera?"
The woman pointed to a place close to the altar of worship. "One of the oracles found you there just as dawn had just risen. I don't know why you went to the temple when it was dark. Your body was as cold as death when I touched you." The female oracle explained.
"No, my King! I can't hurt Troya!" Hector knelt. He realized that the King could suspect him after this. A king does not need evidence, let alone a court, to convict someone.
"I win," Cedric said with a lopsided smile as his grey eyes collided with Draco's silver ones.
"Yes, that's correct,"
Luna stared at her best friend intensely. She cast his gaze in the same direction as Draco. But Luna looked back at him as if in shock. "Is he here?" she asked in a whisper.
"No. I removed you to my room."
"Just go back to your room and change into your own clothes," said Harry quickly as soon as they both got off Harry's horse.
The Prince looked at him doubtfully but immediately answered, "I think I sprained my leg a little bit."
Draco glanced at Harry as he let out a hiss that sounded filled with anger. Draco sighed as the boy reached out his hand to check the condition of Arabelle's skin. He rolled his eyes silently. Apparently, Arabelle had scratched the skin of her feet roughly.
"Mr. Draco doesn't want me to report it to you, master. Mr. Draco said that he felt just a little dizzy and nauseous, and he would feel better if he had rested for a while…” said the maid in a frightened tone, her body suddenly stiffened as her master's face grew darker.
Harry just smiled disparagingly at Draco's movements. “You know you can't refuse if I want to force you. Did you not learn from our sex experience yesterday?" the man calmly threw his loosened tie on the floor, then unbuttoned his shirt, one by one.
When it was still night, Ares relied on the rays of the stars and moon in the clear sky to light his way. He meets his lover Aphrodite in a Greek city that humans also inhabited. Most humans wouldn't have thought that there was a real god that was staying there.
Draco."
"Tell your prince my palace has guards who are many times more capable than those in his palace, so he doesn't have to bother sending useless people to my palace, especially to take care of my wife," said Harry with a hardened face.
"Why are you pulling your blanket up? Isn't it a little hot tonight?" Harry asked as casually as possible.
"Draco, don't you know that I'm really worried about you?"
"No, they're expensive. I'm not sure you'll take care of them and not damage them." Harry's words seem to offend Draco.
Hector did not remain silent while Troya fell sick. He went around many places looking for evidence. He even tried to find Cyllenius, the mysterious Oracle, even though he failed to find him.
"Thank you, Prince Cedric."
Harry watched Draco from head to toe with a look of contempt, then a smile appeared again at the corner of his lips, “C'mon. Welcome to my house,” The man half forcing grab Draco's stiff arm and then led him into his house.
Draco's lips parted, his eyes were closed, and his hands gripped the man's light blue shirt, which still clung to his strong body. "I... I'm yours, Daddy..." Draco answered breathlessly. More and more delicious whimpers and moans escaped his swollen lips. "Only yours..."
"Then please take a seat and wait for me. You will fight me!"
"You will soon find out, My Lady." the man whispered in silence.
"What's fair? He's just a mortal while you're the mighty God of War Ares thousands of years old, aren't you ashamed?" Athena denied.
"Why do you look like you want to cry? You don't want to wear this dress, do you?” muttered Harry, staring at Draco sharply. "Then, I grant your wish." Harry grabbed Draco, gripped the blonde's back until he was closer to him with a sudden movement.
"Ares?" He called a little nervously.
Hermione touched Ron's arm again, reminding him, then looked at Draco apologetically. "Gossip spreads fast, even among men," she whispered to Draco, asking for understanding.
Hearing Draco's sighs and screams made Vlad even crazier. He continued to pump fast and hard. Draco squirmed restlessly, his hands gripping the sheets. And it was a beautiful sight for Vlad, seeing Draco's naked body glistening full of sweat.
Draco had grey-colored eyes, just like Cedric. He also had a pair of blonde eyebrows that were very thick and lips with a natural pink color, lips that succeeded keep any man yearned.
"You think I'm an angel?" The man snorted.
"So what?"
»»-———— ♡♡♡ ————-««
Harry smiled faintly at Alden's answer. "Yeah, the look in his eyes was burning, full of hatred." Harry took another sip of the wine, closing his eyes. "But, you know how much I wanted to have him tonight."
"Yes, his age is not much different from you. You can be friends,"
"So it's true, you do want to oppose your father! Could it be true what Athena said, you were seeking Zeus' attention?" The Goddess added, still nagging.
"Yes," he replied. "Look, you have to be careful with him. I saw a lot of demons approaching you when Potter was with you." Icarus talked to him, but his eyes looked elsewhere.
He wore a suit of armor made of wild bull skin, similar to that of mercenary soldiers in Greece. His head was covered with a helmet. He carried a sword and spear behind his back which was never far from him. It wasn't that he wanted to dress up as a War God. Ares does have to face danger almost every day because he has many enemies.
"This isn't interesting. I thought the boy would stupidly come up to us and try to snatch you or something like your previous lovers," Aphrodite commented again.
Everyone there supported the fact that King Harry and Queen Draco of the Shinia Kingdom were the ideal couples for a decade.
Oh Draco, good job. You're making things worse.
(See the end of the chapter for
-----
Ares immediately regretted his words and was about to correct them, but failed.
"Because you're enough to meet the criteria of being—disguised—as a Mate. Besides, I've been trying to find someone else to stand with me, and it's not working as I expected." Harry sighed. "And I think inviting someone from the packhouse is easier because people like you are familiar with events like this."
Daphne glanced at the maid's departure and smiled. "They are new, and of course, very curious about you."
"I'm just curious. You must know that His Majesty is crowned the most beautiful in this whole kingdom.”
At this time, Tom should have prayed that he would be caught dead, because if Harry had found him alive… Alden did not dare to imagine how that man would become.
Charles proudly led Draco to the center of the dance floor. He seemed to want to show off his victory because he had successfully brought the number one person in this kingdom down from his throne and spent his dance with Charles.
"You're obviously nervous that I brought up about the first night, nothing to worry about. I do this a lot," He said in a reassuring tone. Draco could feel Ares' other hand starting to land on his thigh. Even if only for a moment, the touch made him hot.
"Greetings, Lady Canterbury. It seems that I no longer need to introduce myself to you." Draco said with a gentle smile.
"Bastard," Draco hissed irritably. Stomping on his feet, Draco went back into the house to persuade the man. "Come on. I can't just love someone. You're a man anyway, and I don't know your name either."
=WARNING=
"How many times have you been in a relationship with?" Draco wanted to know because Ares seemed convinced and prepared for the worst ending in their relationship. It's as if he has been through it so many times that he now can guess the scenario of all the relationships he's been in.
Draco tried to snatch his hand away from Harry, but the man continued to grab him. Draco started to feel the heat on his wrist. When Harry let go of his hand, he saw a small black tattoo etched under his palm.
"It hurts!!" Draco screamed, trying to push Harry's body. His body screamed between pain and desire to be filled with lust at how wide Harry's cock was opening him. A tear dripped from the corner of his eye, the remains of his consciousness lingering.
"The usual dose, master, but the effect varies depending on the person."
"There's no reason for me to stop Your Majesty from bringing a
Harry stepped back towards Draco with a light cream-colored scarf in his hand. Seeing how well Draco slept, Harry felt that his decision to change the bandage on his wife's neck was the right one.
Harry was feeling gloomy tonight. For some reason, he was in the mood to beat up someone or kill someone if necessary. Tonight he came to the club, not for fun but to find trouble. Surrounded by bodyguards who were always ready to take care of him, even though it was not necessary because Harry had mastered several martial arts skills. But when you have a lot of money, it's better to let someone else do everything for you.
Draco sighed with relief to himself. His chance of escape was still possible.
Harry said nothing and disappeared from the streets. Draco was still breathing hard. Because of that incident, he decided to return home, in case other creatures chased him. Draco's martial arts skills should have been useful, but it would be better for him to run first and dodge rather than pay attention to the immortal being.
A man with a very busy agenda like Harry definitely didn't have the spare time to investigate such unworkable matters. Not to mention, those inconvenient things come from Draco, someone who doesn't hold a special place in that man's heart.
Doctor Jason's footsteps stopped abruptly. He turned his head and looked at Draco questioningly. "What's wrong, Draco? Can I help you? Are you in pain?"
That night, Harry was clearly protecting him. But why? The questions made Draco's head hurt again, and he closed his eyes again.
"I... I intend to charge extra for the linen cloth that the kingdom is going to sell," Draco said cautiously.
"So... you're not mad at me?" Draco asked, making sure. He felt relieved.
Draco finally got his feet off the bed and walked over to Harry and Cedric, feeling the situation was getting thicker.
As they danced, Draco's eyes caught a glimpse of a young woman in a plain dress who was looking at Draco and Harry with expectant eyes. The girl hid as best she could in the corner of the ballroom, but her strikingly different dress made Draco recognize her.
This time he wouldn't satisfy Harry. Draco wasn't Harry's boyfriend. He was a man and not a doll he could tweak at will. Harry had to realize that.
Half-heartedly, Draco finally reached for the clothes. "Yes, Your Majesty," Draco said with a heavy heart.
"How is he?!" again, Harry asked with a slight shout.
"I know what's right and wrong, Potter. And this time, I mean it," Draco gave Harry a threatening look. "You only have two choices, let me go or find me dead."
✧･ﾟ: ✧･ﾟ✧ :･ﾟ✧･ﾟ✧
"Ah yes... It feels inappropriate for us to chat with each other when Your Majesty doesn't know my name yet. I'm Natalie Canterbury. Previously I was the 13th concubine, but now, I have been appointed as the main concubine and in charge of filling the position of empress that has been long dead." explained the concubine, Natalie, in such detail.
"We're ready to be punished," Attica added, looking so embarrassed and didn't even want to look at the prince.
"He never saw me. I don't know why he brought me to Olympus, but what is clear from your story—he doesn't consider me his lover. Do you know why he wanted to make me his wife?" asked the prince.
Draco threw the leech. Its stomach looked like it was about to burst onto the ground, and mercilessly, Draco stepped on the leech until it oozed the blood it had been enjoying from the poor white horse's body.
Harry was stunned when he saw Draco's appearance reflected from his room. It seemed like Draco was standing by the sleeping lamp beside his bed because his shadow emerged from the window curtains like a dark, erotic silhouette.
Harry smiled at Draco's behavior. “You're like a scared rabbit again, Draco. Are you afraid that I will do something evil? Like mixing drugs in your drink or throwing you off the balcony again?" Harry grinned, put down his glass, and stood up, getting closer and closer to Draco.
“Touch me, please... Make me cum...” Draco pleaded with his teary eyes.
"Help me,"
If calculated, it's been about an hour. Draco sat on the sparsely cut wood as a seat, and during that hour, Draco thought about Arabelle's words.
"Are you ready?" asked Cedric, a little nervous as he grabbed the reins of his horse. At this moment, his position looked like he was hugging Draco.
Draco's eyes could only stare in fear. In front of him, this man had completely changed, from a friendly and kind man to a terrifying monster. Draco's body was tied to a chair, and Draco was completely immobile, under the power of a mad psychopath who was now pacing back and forth with the knife in his hand.
care with whatever immortal rules. I'll find the exit if you don't want to tell me, weird guy." Draco then walked out of the room to find an exit.
"It's so itchy..." Arabelle whined in the middle of her sobs.
"About what?" Draco frowned, starting to get annoyed by Harry's interruptions. He was in the mood to savor the rain, and the man always seemed to show up at the wrong time and speak the wrong words too.
It was quite a night, and the sound of crickets was loud. Draco could see the clear cloudless sky and the moon giving off a romantic feel without them asking. Everything was clear now. Troya wasn't having bad luck. The God of War would not torture him. He was instead given a new life that would probably make him happier.
"Yes. You did it." There was a smile on Harry's voice, “With great enthusiasm and hunger. I just lay there, and you eat me whole, all night."
Natalie answered Draco's words with a fresh laugh. A few moments later, the two people spoke to each other. Sometimes they talk about royal life, sometimes about politics, sometimes gossiping, sometimes about the military, sometimes about flowers.
"I never have sex while standing up," Harry whispered in his ear, in a hot whisper that made Draco tingle all over. "And you make me want to do it,"
"Okay, I'll be there in a minute," Harry said to the guard, who replied with a nod. The guard took the time to bow before he left Harry and Draco.
Draco was stunned. This guy's really weird. Why would he ask Draco to love him? As if no immortals willing to love him, and he's desperate for not getting anyone.
"The King won't mind it. Why should they be stingy with a prince who will be sacrificed to Olympus?" Draco objected.
Tbh, I'm not planning to make this fic long. This story will end soon, with a few more chapters to go. I want to end this fic as soon as posibble so I can re-upload "Love in the Darkness", my other Darry muggle fic that I previously took down.
As long as he stepped into the area where Cedric would fight, all the guards' eyes never left Draco for a second. The way the queen walked firmly, the way he stared intently, the way he kept a small smile, he was truly a blessing to this kingdom.
"Your majesty, are you really going to fight Prince Cedric?" Glenice asked worriedly as she folded Draco's hair up high so the soft mane wouldn't get in his way when he fought later.
Draco frowned. After thinking for a moment, he thought that this man who claimed to be a lawyer looked convincing. He put down his knife, and he opened the door warily.
The window was open, and the dim light reflected from it, so clear. Harry stared at the window in frustration. The young man was over there, and Harry should have him undoubtedly. But the blonde's attitude made him feel like a disgusting bastard when he forced his will on Draco.
"I'm Ares' lover, the mother of his children. Whereas you are his wife now, I just wanted to know if you suddenly wanted to do something reckless trying to hurt me or something. I have to get ready."
Draco's body jumped a little in surprise. He lifted his head and looked at a tall, muscular man who was looking at him from a distance. Draco straightened up as the man walked closer to the spot where he was standing.
Of course, the hard movement forced Draco to open his eyes. His eyes seemed to blink a few times when he saw his husband's faint face, but seconds later, his eyes widened when he realized that his husband was really close to him.
Holding back tears and holding back his embarrassment, Draco took off his clothes in front of Harry's eyes, who stood stiffly while staring at him and then putting on the dress. It was an extraordinarily fine dress, slid slowly over his body, and felt so snug.
"The Japanese said, if you want a flower to be beautiful, it must be cultivated because flowers have a way of bringing people together, pulling them away from home," he said again.
Cedric's mumble managed to make Draco pull his gaze from the sky to Cedric's eyes which turned out to be staring intently at his face.
"So Your Majesty wants me to be alone with His Majesty in public? I'd be very blessed if Your Majesty gave me that permission," said Cedric with a smile already on his face.
Draco felt sorry because the real Troya didn't get to experience all of this. Their relationship was simple. Ares was just curious about the most beautiful Greek prince and married him. The prince's only job was to please him, at least not to make him angry that he had to kick him out of the palace.
Because I saw you changing clothes like an erotic silhouette from below!! Because the sight is so aroused that it hurts!! Harry stands with burning eyes, ready to spit out his feelings, but then realizes that he will only look ridiculous if he spills out what's on his mind.
The front of Harry's living room was very grand, with old-style architecture that somehow seemed modern. The marble floor glistens with ivory, and the large pillars in the living room of a similar color soar high, paired with shades of red and gold. Harry led Draco to a large round white staircase and again half dragged him up the stairs. They both stopped in front of a large white door.
HARRYYYY NOOO 🙈🙈
A man is walking towards him. The tall, athletic-looking emerald-green man made Draco gawk at him. His black hair was neatly combed back, making his already charming figure very hard to resist the eye. The man with thick eyebrows and stern jaw now stood in front of Draco, observing Draco intensely and making him blush.
But unfortunately, Draco's gentle smile immediately disappeared when the image of his father, currently sitting in his oversized chair at Malfoy manor, seemed to be staring at Draco intently.
Any normal lover would subconsciously think of touching his hair or stroking his sturdy arm muscles. Draco didn't deny that he might be willing to do something else with him that was more intimate and fun, but he wasn't willing to do it just because they were married.
Memories... All the memories of his teenage years.
Harry just mumbled incoherently without looking at Draco.
Was Potter worried about him? Impossible! That man was just concerned because Draco was someone with the same face as the wife he loved, someone he hoped would replace his wife.
"But you're sick! There's no need to push yourself like this." Draco said stubbornly, which elicited a chuckle from Charles.
"Fine, if you don't want to, I can call my Godfather. He will come and take me home." Draco said.
Icarus laughed. "Actually, that's not the story. But mortals certainly don't know the truth," he said.
"Just get to the point." Harry rolled his eyes.
"Potter," Draco muttered, panting heavily.
Greyson shrugged his shoulders. "Well, the project run by my company in Greece has ended successfully."
This time, the crown prince's words were only answered with a gentle nod and a smile from Draco.
Suddenly a wind came, making the cloth fall with the scattered dust that made Draco coughed.
Because she was running fast and impatient, she did not pay attention to a stone in front of her. Now, she had fallen on the grass that felt damp because the rain had just poured.
"Isn't that the sound of crying?" said the King of the Delion. Despite his old age, it seems that that man has not lost his ability as a perceptive knight on the battlefield.
"Yes," He said flatly.
"I still won't leave the Spartan Prince. I quite like him, and I brought him to Olympus with no ease. I don't want my investment to go to waste." Ares reiterated.
Draco smiled. Without waiting for anything, Draco immediately placed his hand on top of Cedric's strong hand. They danced with happy smiles on their faces. The faint sound of the orchestra from within the royal hall made Draco feel the newest sensation of dancing.
"Maybe he's just not to my taste," Ares dodged.
“The famous Hyde never fails. He will become obsessed with his victim if he can't kill them. And now, he will definitely come after you. You have to be careful because, until now, we don't know who he is."
Draco felt left out because instead of accompanying him, Ares sat next to Aphrodite, who was clinging to him. Ares probably hadn't greeted him at all today, and Draco refused to look sad because of it. He raised his head and smiled at the guests. He was already familiar enough with the residents of Ares palace that he wasn't too worried about being lonely.
Of course, Cedric immediately gave a very deadly glare at the girl, who looked like a doll. She's wearing jewelry was too childish. Pinks and flowers, sickening!
Everyone who passed them ignored him. They thought it was an attempt to secure their prince. But Draco immediately knew. As soon as he saw a chariot without a window in front of him—it didn't belong to the king of Sparta. Hector planned this.
"Which restaurant? There are lots of restaurants here." Harry walked off to where his car was parked.
"Put it on. This is an order," Harry seemed to be starting to get annoyed that Draco hadn't received the clothes.
That person is still walking. But Draco didn't just let the man put himself in danger. It is possible that he is deaf and doesn't see that the crossing lights for pedestrians are still red. Draco quickly ran towards the man and pushed him away when the car suddenly crashed toward his body.
Ares put his helmet back on and jumped off his horse. Herion had memorized Ares' habits. When he drew his sword, it meant he was telling Herion to stay away. The horse neighed and galloped away, leaving Ares in the dark and the monster bull snorting furiously at him. Someone had sent the monster for him. The creature was not commonly roaming on Olympus. In addition, monsters usually will not directly attack the Titans like him. They were designed to kill humans, not Titans.
"How much is your price?" Harry's voice sounded calm and cold.
Draco wiped his tears harshly. No! He had cried enough. He had to fight back at all costs! Draco slowly stepped into the bathroom. He had to take a shower and erase all the traces and stains Harry had left on his body. That monster may stain his body, but that doesn't mean he has Draco altogether. Draco is free, a free man that full of determination to destroy Harry.
"Yes, our house used to orbit that star," Attica added.
"Hopefully, Madam's daughter can be successful this season," Draco said kindly and flashing his best smile.
Seeing Draco's face turned gloomy, the man smiled sadly. "I'm sorry,"
Arriving at the parking lot, the bodyguard dropped Draco off. A second after being lowered, Draco ran as hard as he could to get away, but the rock-hard hands caught him again after just a few steps. Draco struggled but couldn't fight back; with frustration, he bit as hard as the hand that held him.
"Turkey is a foreign country. It is very far from this kingdom." Draco explained again.
Draco glanced at Luna and then glanced at Harry. Someone raised their hand, and Professor Trelawney invited the person to speak.
Although he collapsed, Draco was sure, the black shadow he saw was Vlad before his vision completely darkened.
"I guess it doesn't matter. He'll be on Olympus forever. He can't tell any humans," Argus replied casually.
Draco had permission from Ares to use the kitchen. Only for the next two days. That was because Draco had already agreed to prepare a dinner attended by some of Ares' close relatives. To announce their marriage.
Draco's body froze. A voice with a strange accent suddenly appeared in response to the question Draco had spoken in his head.
From the side, Cedric looked closely at Draco's beautiful face. The young man was really very beautiful. It seemed that God carved his face when God's smiling.
However, the admiration had to be interrupted when Harry saw Draco's body about to move sideways again. With wide strides, Harry approached Draco and held the young man's body a little hard.
Athena smiled, felt like he had the opportunity she had wanted for thousands of years. "Revoke the god of war title from his name." The Goddess said calmly.
It seemed like Draco's words had hit Harry to the core because the man's jaw tensing, angry. Harry roughly grabbed his black silk robe and wore it back. Then with a sudden movement, he climbed onto the bed and gripped Draco's jaw with one hand. The grip was so harsh and painful that Draco's blonde brows frowned. But Draco held himself back from complaining. He didn't want to give this devil any redemption.
"Darling?"
In contrast to Cedric, who looked at Draco with a gentle smile and a warm gaze, Draco looked at the man with an even stare.
Honestly, Draco wanted to refuse, but considering that the other man who was currently asking for the dance was Charles Richmond, one of the dukes who contributed a lot to the prosperity of this kingdom, he couldn't help but accept the dance from the man who seemed to adore him a lot.
Did Harry really think of Draco as his lover? Draco's cheeks flushed at the thought. Was all of Harry's kindness purely driven by desire? Draco should have felt insulted, but no, his feelings were warm without him noticing. He shouldn't feel this way.
Harry's lips tightened in a thin line, and then he immediately stood up. “Tell your wife not to do anything. He is mine, and no one can take him out of my house, except with my permission." Harry looked straight at Ron, considering. "I respect you, Weasley. You are one of the few people I respect, and I don't want this respectful relationship to break. Sorry, I'll excuse myself first because there is an appointment with the other client after this." After nodding stiffly, Harry walked away from the huge meeting room.
He had been sold like a slave to Harry on his 23rd birthday, which was a week away. It was like being insulted and hit at the same time. He wanted to scream that he wasn't an object. He was human and had free will.
Draco looked away, not knowing what to say, still not believing what Doctor Jason had said to him.
The man continued to walk towards Draco. When he was entirely in front of Draco, his index finger moved to lift Draco's chin slightly.
of this club, approached Harry with seductive eyes. She was the one Harry had usually chosen to accompany him drinking when Harry visited, and now her heart was filled with jealousy that Harry seemed so attracted to the new member.
The prince pointed one of his hands towards the group of guards. As if he knew the meaning of the code, one of the guards ran hurriedly while carrying a sword that had been prepared for Cedric.
Draco becomes tempted by Harry's offer. No, not tempted to be Harry's lover. But tempted by the promise that Harry would not treat him as a prisoner, which meant loosening the tight security that had guarded him.
Cedric seemed blind and deaf. The handsome prince didn't answer the question that came out of his brother. Let alone answer; the prince didn't even want to look at his relative at all.
Draco pretended not to hear him and stared at his phone screen.
"Ah... it's okay, Lady. If Lady is exhausted, Lady and Your Majesty can go back first. I still want to take a walk here." Draco said without the slightest objection.
Draco could see Cedric was staring at him with a... longing, maybe? The man's gaze didn't move an inch from Draco's beautiful face.
Without waiting for an answer from the king, Draco immediately got up from his position. Although the young man walked quickly, the impression of grace never left him. After getting the ointment that he had deliberately kept in his drawer, he returned to his position.
But on the other hand, Draco was afraid. He was too scared to look at the future that might be chaotic.
Harry turned to him. His face was serious now. "Then good if you already know what I am," he said. "It will make it easier for me to cooperate with you,"
, he muttered, trying to encourage himself.
"Ah, yes, and actually, he helped save your life."
He hasn't seen Harry since he fought with Icarus, neither has Icarus. The two of them haven't appeared since then. Maybe they need some time together and are currently hanging out together. Who knows, right? Like two boys who fight over a toy and then make up again because their favorite game has just been released, and decide to play together. Even though Icarus said he was his guardian angel, Draco still didn't believe him. Could he be around Draco anytime? And did he follow Draco in the bathroom too?
Harry finally turned to Draco. His face was crimson red, and he couldn't hide his nervousness. "Well, this might sound weird, but I'm serious." he took a deep breath and looked straight at Draco. "I like you, Draco. I don't know since when, but I'm sure I've been attracted to you since we first met." he paused for a moment, seeing how Draco was reacting. The blonde remained silent, inviting him to continue speaking. "It's up to you how you look at me after this, but I'm serious. I like you. I love you, Draco,"
The atmosphere in the ballroom that night was very lively. The music from the famous orchestra that gathered at the side of the ballroom added to the romantic atmosphere in the magnificent ballroom.
. Students, professors and all." He emphasized the sentence.
Ares looked thoughtful then scratched his chin before answering. "You know, generally, when a father accepts the dowry, it means he has given up his children. So, you have already become my wife," Ares explained.
"I thought so too," the woman in the group, in the pink dress, replied in an equally sarcastic voice. "Considering the history of Harry's lovers has always been extraordinarily beautiful. But look at her. She doesn't seem like she belongs here. She definitely isn't a woman of class!"
Prang! The sound of clashing two irons filled the void created in the area. All the guards stared in amazement at Draco, who could easily lift a sword that was quite heavy for a slender build like him.
"This time, Zeus seriously thought about punishing you. You could lose your god title, Ares." Hera looked at her son sternly.
Alastair arrived with two horse-drawn carriages full of treasure. Scrolls of high-quality silk cloth from Libya, jewel-encrusted sword and dagger, beautiful jewelry, gold coins, and several marble statues. These were wedding gifts from the God of War to the King of Sparta.
"Huh, what a pain…" Draco grunted.
"What about Potter?" Draco asked quickly. The sabotage must have been carried out by Harry's enemies, who had hatred against him.
"He didn't touch his food at all. We put his food in the room, and he just sleeps there. When we looked at the tray, he didn't touch it, not even his drink. You have to do something before that kid puts himself in danger, master." Alden replied dryly, although there was a hint of worry there.
"But Ares has broken the rules! I want justice to be served, Zeus!" Athena spoke out loud. She wanted Zeus not to waver.
Harry treats dresses — as expensive and beautiful as this — as a rag. This demon doesn't understand anything about beauty! Unconsciously Draco's hatred spilled over again for Harry. The urge to challenge Harry was immense even though the other side of him screamed not to challenge Harry any further.
His frown deepened when he saw how deep Draco's wound was. Spontaneously, anger took control of the dark-haired man again. Actually, what crazy things have been done by his cousin and wife that his wife could be injured so badly? And how come his wife didn't even weep in pain?
Draco's face suddenly turned pale. Worry overtook him. Cedric was well aware of that. The other man's brain moved quickly to think of a way out they should take at this time.
"All right. Please be careful," Draco nodded as Cedric pulled his hand away. Cedric kissed the back of his hand gently.
The man kissed the corner of Draco's lips softly, then his tongue stuck in, opened Draco's soft lips, smacked them, and felt the entire texture of Draco's warm, hot lips. His tongue hooked Draco's and played with it with great intensity.
"Is it allowed?" Draco asked, looking at Cedric with a hopeful face.
It's too late to look back. Draco made up his mind. He closed his eyes and spoke quickly, "I am willing to be your companion for a while."
"Y-yes?" Draco flinched. One of the main Gods of Olympus spoke to him. "God of Wine, I'm sorry if I'm rude. How can I help you?" Draco straightened his back in a polite manner.
"Draco," Harry clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white. "Stop this bullshit right now."
"I'm sorry, Your Majesty."
"You are in your palace, my prince. You have slept for ten days, and everyone was worried." Draco was told by a young woman dressed in a simple light dress that seemed just to be wrapped around like a scarf. Draco remembered seeing such clothing in ancient Greek paintings.
"Good evening, Your Majesty Draco, Your Majesty Harry." said the young man as he stopped right in front of the throne Harry and Draco were sitting on.
His eyes stared in surprise at the owner of the hand. The owner of the hand was none other than his husband, Harry.
The King contemplated on his throne, which was ornately in gilded corners. He scratched his chin in thought. The King has acted quite selfishly today. He held a special meeting to discuss the fate of his son and gathered all the advisers and wise men he trusted.
"His mother is human, and his father is a god,"
"Since you don't want to bear Potter's child, then Potter's bitch can't
"Why do you want to go there?"
"It won't hurt,"
At breakfast, Draco didn't talk as much as usual. Maybe it's still awkward. It would have been better if last night he had not said such pleasantries.
A sudden heat engulfed Draco's cheeks and neck. The queen’s silver eyes stared at Harry in surprise. What do his husband's words mean?
Draco nodded gracefully to the woman Troya had spoken about quite often in the past. "I wonder what happened to me then. Did the snake really bite me?"
The man, who was bending over his body and crushing Draco's lips, was Harry Potter. Harry was crushing Draco's lips, then he stopped and looked into Draco's eyes, realizing that Draco was awake.
"However, this will only be a secret between us, won't it, Your Majesty?"
Harry narrowed his eyes, watching Draco from head to toe. "It's too easy if I let you go, you will definitely find a way to get revenge again, and it's too easy if I kill you. Your body is too good to die in vain." Harry stepped closer, and Draco immediately stepped back automatically.
Draco could only be tight-lipped when Harry says that thing. He didn't want to justify his words, nor did he want to deny it either. So Draco better keeps quiet.
