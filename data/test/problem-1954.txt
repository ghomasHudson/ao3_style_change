"I don't know. It was roughly the same thing I have been dreaming about since the battle."
"Filch is letting the first couple of people leave if you're ready," Draco pointed toward the entrance hall.
Not a single word was said when Harry and Draco walked into the Weasley's kitchen. Everyone's eyes were on the blonde haired intruder, Harry swore he could see several jaws unhinge.
"Then why did you ask?" Malfoy smirked.
Harry watched the two Slytherin's leave. When Park shot a glare in his direction, Draco hit her over the top of her head with the palm of his hand.
"Technically, he
"I'm sorry," Harry sighed, looking down at his sheets.
Harry was beginning to feel uneasy. The uncomfortable feeling he got in his stomach whenever his mind was taken back to the war was settling in place and his brain was beginning to relive memories he would rather forget. His knee began bouncing erratically, and hands began twisting around each other. He loosened his bow tie just a little and tried to slow his breathing as he attempted to look like he wasn't panicking.
"Both of you, shut it!" Harry groaned, elbowing the invisible Draco.
"I'm sure you did great. Come on, we're having a party. Eighth years only."
"You guys are lame, I just hope you know that," said Terry, placing his book on his bed stand.
"Oh, yeah. You wanna go with me to the ball?" Harry asked.
"Whatever you say," he rolled his eyes before planting a kiss on his cheek.
A bludger hit the end of his broom and sent him flying off course. He quickly regained his bearings but realised the snitch was no longer in sight. Thankfully however, Summerby has been so close to him that Harry's broom knocked his off course as well.
It was then that Harry had an epiphany. A memory of something that was buried somewhere in Ron's room that Harry never imagined would find its proper home.
"Are you positive I'm not going to get eaten alive?" Draco began walking slowly toward the Fat Lady's portrait.
"Does this mean you don't hate me anymore?" Asked Harry.
The brightly coloured pile of presents in the middle of the room slowly depleted over the morning as one by one, someone would pluck one from the pile and pass it to the intended receiver.
"If you're sure Potter," she nodded. "I'll be out of your hair in a moment."
"I didn't," Ron sat back down next to him. "It's not our paper either."
- Also, not a warning, but I much prefer Harry and Draco's initial meeting in the film than in the novel, so that's possibly the only thing in this fanfiction that will be based off the films -
"Better question; why are you nervous?" Hermione raised an eyebrow.
With a flick of her wand, the tables lined themselves with food and music began playing from somewhere Harry could not see.
"Friends is fine," said Ron defeatedly as Harry took Pig to the window. "But don't expect me to get all cozy with him."
"Everyday if you want us to," said Draco.
Harry was stunned. He looked at Malfoy with concerned eyes, he reached out to touch him. Draco shivered under the slight brush of Harry's fingers against his bicep.
It was evident that Malfoy had slept but had been woken up perhaps as bluntly as Harry had as his blonde hair was messed up and all over the place, similar to Harry's normally. He was wearing a grey, long sleeve v-neck shirt with flannelette bottoms of the same colour that reached just above his ankles. Harry studied him while he refused to look away from the amber light.
"I think you should stay away from things you don't understand," said Harry, making eye contact with Malfoy. "Go on, go back to the Great Hall." None of them moved. "Now!"
"Are you nervous?" She asked.
"You know what would help?" Draco turned to him. "If we talked less and maybe, did something else."
They eventually found themselves back in the Eighth year common room where the few students who decided not to continue with Herbology past their O.W.Ls. One of these students was Draco Malfoy, at a desk bent over a textbook, who raised an eyebrow at Harry as he dragged himself across the common room.
"What are you looking for?" Harry rested his forehead in his hands on the table. It was really too early for this.
Sharing some Sherbet Lemons with Draco, Ron dumped one last present into Harry's lap.
"If I don't?" Draco challenged.
. Was Draco gay? Harry weighed the evidence in his head. Draco had never had a girlfriend that anyone knew of, he did have a great sense of fashion and kept himself well groomed. Surely that wasn't conclusive evidence. He couldn't just ask him either. That sort of question is way too personal and Harry didn't want to offend Draco.
It was then Harry realised that Draco was probably still a little mad at him for blowing him off and avoiding talking about their situation just days before. Draco was letting Harry know just how he felt when he was trying to have another very important conversation.
He called in sick to both Quidditch training sessions that were held since his trip down memory lane. He had lost interest in everything really. His appetite vanished and even after a week he could see his ribs in the mirror and he berated himself about how sickly he looked but still did not have any will to eat a morsel.
Around the room, his dorm mates were hopping around into their own trousers or tying their ties.
"I get that I'm irresistible, Potter. But could you please refrain from feeling me up at the dinner table," Draco hissed, regaining his composure with a sly smirk. Harry curled his fingers into a fist and punched him in the same place his fingers brushed against not too long ago.
"Why haven't you been attending tutoring?" She asked again.
Harry woke peacefully, the short nap unburdened by the nightmares that plagued his deep sleep. Draco was still asleep on his chest, he smiled at him and lifted his arm, the one Draco wasn't lying on, to brush his blonde hair from his face.
"Ron, I love you, but, you have the emotional capabilities of a lump of Gillyweed," Hermione made eye contact with Harry and nodded to the doorway.
"Hey! Don't ignore me," Harry frowned, holding the strap of his bag as he caught up to the Slytherin. "What's up your arse?"
Harry couldn't say the words his mind was screaming even if he wanted to. He didn't even understand the words himself.
Draco passed him a chocolate frog packet without looking at him, pulling his own out of his robes as well.
"You expect one from Malfoy?" Ron sniggered. "The ungrateful git would rather eat a bucket of Flobberworms before he tarnishes his pride."
Harry and Draco fell to the back of the group, fully intentionally on both of their parts.
Harry placed his fork down momentarily on his plate and brought his right hand under the table cautiously. He turned to the conversation, more like an argument, that Ginny and Ron were having as he reached for Malfoy's arm in a gesture of support. His hand connected with fabric and Draco jumped in alarm.
"McGonagall again?" Asked Ron with his mouth stuffed with toast. Harry nodded, tearing open the envelope.
"What do you think?" He scoffs. "I'm only good at Herbology. I'm going to continue studying it, maybe write a book."
"It's probably because he wants to stay with his new best friend Malfoy," Ron folded his arms as he slumped back in his chair. Harry frowned, shocked at his friend's words.
"You called me Harry again," he laughed.
"But you
Harry laughed and patted his friend on the shoulder. "We'll see you in the common room."
Harry said nothing but continued smiling as he tore open his own package and popped a chocolate egg in his mouth.
"I just want to ask, what is up with Malfoy this year?" Ernie sat up off his boyfriend, fiddling with his wand.
"What was that? You don't have a wand?" Laughed Ron with a mocking tone. "Did McGonagall make you leave it with her? See, she doesn't even trust you."
"I know," she laughed. "You do know that there are people who like both boys and girls right?"
"I'm writing home tonight for my broom, Potter, you best be lucky you've already played Slytherin," said Malfoy warningly as he picked his black school bag off a bench.
"Let's see if she'll last."
"I said leave it!" Malfoy growled. "I do not need your help! I do not need perfect Potter to come to save me! I can handle my problems by myself believe it or not!"
"We got defence against the dark arts first," Ron pointed out. "We get to meet the other new teacher."
It truly was a sight to see. The eighth years walked through the castle in two rows, boys on one side and girls on the other. Of course, this was all orchestrated by Ernie Macmillan who led the group proudly in his midnight blue robes.
"Oh, well. I guess I can hold on to it for just a little bit longer," Harry smiled, turning and tucking the wand in his suitcase. Just as he stood up to return to Draco, he was leaving the room. "Where are you going?"
"Oh, shut it," Fred rolled his eyes. "We were going to have to give old Voldy a fight at some point. And anyway, it wasn't your fault. I could have been quicker with my wand work. Your grumbling isn't going to change the fact that I died."
"No, I mean," Harry took an unnecessarily long drink from his Butterbeer. "Surely that would be a conversation for a more private place."
"Huh?"
"It was nice meeting you, uh, properly. But I should be getting back to the Weasleys," Harry scratched the back of his neck.
"Harry James Potter, sometimes I swear you are thicker than Ron," she rolled her eyes. "You have been sleeping in the same dorm as two people who call themselves boyfriends for the past year!"
They all laughed amongst themselves as they copied out the legal consequences of the three curses.
"I didn't think about it like that," Harry pondered this for a minute. Did Draco really ask him out on a date?
"It's almost the 2000s guys, better prepare yourselves now," said Justin before leaning over to place a soft kiss on his boyfriend's lips.
After five minutes of Hermione glaring at him from the opposite couch, Harry finally got to his feet and walked over to the desk where Draco Malfoy was studying alone.
"Do you have these dreams most nights?"
Harry's eyes shot open and he scrambled to sit up. He regained a sense of his surroundings, the familiar inside of his curtained four-poster bed.
He hit the grass ungracefully, thankfully he was only a few feet in the air on collision. He sat up slowly, testing out any injuries, there weren't any. But there was, however, a golden snitch laying quiet in his fist.
Harry's eyes instinctively looked over to scan the Slytherin table. He found Draco bear the end of the table. A third year of his house was talking to him animatedly.
"How come he didn't tell me I needed a tutor?" Ron frowned as they head up to the eighth year's common room. "If Harry's that bad, I must be getting a grade lower than a Troll!" He laughed.
"Harry, whatever that potion made you feel, it's not real. You've healed, moved on," Draco said.
Harry dropped the knife from his free hand and realised that he had sliced his finger open while not paying attention. The pain of the injury finally set in and he ripped his hand away from Malfoy and grabbed a tissue to wipe the blood.
The word 'date' was whispered as if it were a foreign concept to him.
"Nearly half an hour, you had a wicked crash," Ron laughed, Hermione hit him in the arm.
"What?" Harry spluttered. Ginny sat back down, nodding solemnly.
been able to conjure one."
Harry sat up fast, his chest shaking with the effort to suck in air. He rubbed his eyes and groaned lowly as he lied back down onto the crimson sheets of the bed in the eighth year dormitories.
He takes the toothbrush out of his mouth and uses a towel to dab the corner of his mouth. "Daunting, exhilarating."
A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Draco, Lily, and Regulus had drawn right up to them.
"Morning, Malfoy," Ron was quick to scowl at him.
"Sleep well everyone, and wake up nice and early for classes tomorrow. Prefects, come get your passwords from me and lead your houses to the common rooms, eighth years, stay behind please."
"Okay, I'll be the other captain then," said George proudly.
"James, give it a rest," Draco sighed, clearly sick of his sons' squabbling.
"Oi!" Malfoy yelled. Harry turned just in time to see a Quaffle just before it hit him square in the face.
"Hello, Harry," he smiled. Harry grimaced.
"Actually, Draco," Harry interrupted. "Before we start, I really wanna talk to you about-"
She released the bludgers and the golden snitch and picked up the quaffle with both hands. She blew the whistle hard and tossed the quaffle in the air.
"You know, this is so much better than the Three Broomsticks," Neville nodded, looking around the slightly dingy pub. "It's way too noisy in there."
"I'm going to the Burrow for Christmas, you'll be right on your own, yes?"
"Why are they all
"Mr Malfoy, I am assigning you to be substitute seeker for the Slytherin team," McGonagall announced.
With their broom on the grass in front of them, Draco leant against Harry's right shoulder, staring off into the distance at the lake and the trees beyond.
"It is tradition that the seventh years of Hogwarts leave the grounds for the last time, the same way they arrived all those years ago," McGonagall explained. "In twenty minutes the boats will set off across the lake toward Hogsmeade. Siblings of those graduating are asked to leave the Hall and join the rest of your house in the Entrance Hall to board the carriages now rather than later unless you wouldn't mind walking. Thank you, parents and guardians, for attending. Carriages will be set aside for your transportation off the school grounds where you will be able to apparate home. For our non-magical attendees, you will be escorted by a Ministry representative just as you arrived here. I won't keep you any longer, congratulate your children and enjoy the rest of your time here."
"Oh Harry, Hermione," Mrs Weasley pulled them both into a hug. "Your parents would have been so proud to see you up there. Young adults now."
The three boys were staring at the large clock on the wall. She had promised only three hours until they could leave, two hours and fifty-nine minutes had elapsed.
"In your dreams, Draco," Harry grabbed the end of the Nimbus 2001 and pulled the smug Slytherin closer until their knees almost touched.
"Merlin, Potter, give me a heart attack why don't you," Malfoy huffed, sitting back down in his chair and turning his head away. Harry whispered the counter charm for his wand light and walked over to the Slytherin boy, sitting in a yellow armchair beside him.
"I'll be beside you the whole time," Harry promised. "For this evening, you will be an honorary Gryffindor."
"You've had sex?" Harry asked.
Harry flew back and caught the quaffle before it fell to the ground. "What was that for?"
"They probably came to meet you," said Draco, rolling his eyes.
"You tried to kill me," Harry chuckled cynically under his breath. Draco looked at him alarmed.
"Hey! Mind your own business!" Ron ran to his door and poked his head into the hall outside.
"I was on house arrest, Potter, with nothing to do but dwell on my self hatred," he spat, his tone changing dramatically from the calm and sleepy voice that he had been using previously.
"Dumbledore," said Harry as the gargoyle that guarded McGonagall's office looked at him expectantly.
"I wasn't paying attention," Harry corrected him. "It's my fault."
Harry used every ounce of his energy to push himself forward and beyond Summerby's grasp. He was quite a bit taller than the Hufflepuff fourth year but in no way did that impede the seeker in his attempt to win. But in the end, it was Harry who wrapped a single finger around the delicate silver wing of the snitch, causing it to fall still as it hung between two of Harry's fingers.
"I don't care anymore," Harry groaned. "I'm going to bed."
His eyelids felt heavy as he forced them open. He stretched his muscles gently, repositioning himself carefully.
Harry leaves with his bag over his shoulder and hands in his pockets. It was the first day of December and the air was icy. His footsteps echoed loudly in the stone corridors as everyone else in the school had already arrived at their first class for the day. He made his way to the Transfiguration wing and knocked quietly on the wooden door of the classroom.
It had been ten minutes before Harry saw Draco enter the common room, he looked flustered and a little on edge.
"Yeah, ha ha. Very funny," Malfoy rolled his eyes as he caught up to Harry.
What did snap Harry out of his blissful daydream was when they entered the Great Hall and Draco still did not leave his side as he made his way to the Gryffindor table. He looked at Draco strangely which caused him to shrug.
As he turned to head back toward the Weasley family, a ghostly presence had joined them. Molly was sobbing as she reached out to touch her son but of course, her hand simply passed through his arm
Harry took a deep breath in and took his mind to the Burrow where his body, and Draco's, would duly follow.
It was Tuesday afternoon and Harry was already confident in saying that the next two weeks were going to be the worst of his life. The N.E.W.T exams were definitely living up to their name. Harry has just come out of the Herbology practical exam and yesterday he sat his Charms exams.
"Macmillan and Finch-Fletchley are being absolutely ghastly about Hufflepuff's loss, so I decided I'd enjoy the company of the victors both to escape their inescapable whining and to anger them further," Draco explained with a sly grin on his face.
He sipped a goblet of pumpkin juice and ate a slice of buttered toast while the post came swooping in. Unexpectedly, a large package was dropped in front of Harry as the breakfast was cleared. From the shape of the object, he already knew what it was. He and Ron shared a look of excitement before rushing back to the Eighth year dorm with it leaving Hermione with Ginny.
He could hardly recall the incident. His sixth year had felt like so long ago.
Harry crawled over to sit beside Draco. Harry picked up the blonde haired boy's right hand in his left. He held it gently as if one faulty move would cause it to break.
"I'm eighteen, older than you I may add, I do not need to be babied!" Draco folded his arms.
"Too right, there is a fine line between fashionably late and embarrassingly late. Pull yourselves together back there and let's get a move on!" Said Ernie.
"Horace informs me you've been performing as poorly as ever in class. He's even assigned you a tutor. I guess it's hard actually doing work without using somebody else's."
"Maybe you were, mate, I was never that short," Ron scoffed.
"Six thirty-ish," Harry rolled back to face Draco who was now a lot closer than he remembered. Something was up with Malfoy, why was he acting in such a vulnerable manner?
Harry obliged, walking closer and sitting next to the Slytherin who continued to look straight ahead. Their sides were completely touching. Harry could feel Draco shiver a little bit and assumed it was because of the temperature. Harry snaked his left arm around Draco's back and his hand came to rest in the taller boy's jacket's pocket.
"Mostly, I guess, I just see flashes from my memory. Sometimes they're more abstract, like just darkness with odd shapes. Once I wake up they aren't distressing, but when I am dreaming them they just seem so real," Harry explained.
Harry raised his eyebrows at the last comment but Malfoy was too busy sulking to notice.
Harry stood up, thinking that a walk would be best for him right now. He grabbed his glasses, invisibility cloak and his slippers and made his way as quietly as he could out of the dormitory.
"Do you think I should get it cut?" Draco asked. "I can't decide if I actually like it this long or not." He twisted a finger through the hair at the base of his neck thoughtfully.
"Something I would like to know is why you think this trauma has influenced your diet, or lack of I should say," said McGonagall. Harry sighed.
"Can I ask you something?" Draco asked.
Draco nodded, glancing around distastefully at all of Ron's memorabilia and knick-knacks.
He took a deep breath before opening the portrait hole just enough for him to stick his head through.
"Sure," Malfoy grumbled.
Harry picked up his right hand and inspected the burn.
The edges of his vision darkened and pulsed. The voices and sounds around him became harder to hear, becoming drowned out by strange noises ringing in his head.
"You know what McGonagall said, Harry, you've got to-"
"He's not my lover boy," Harry frowned, not looking away from him.
"It'll be worth it." Draco lay on his back, making sure his side was in contact with Harry's.
It wasn't just the cranky school nurse that Harry was anxious about. This was to be the first conversation he was going to have with Malfoy after the war. The boys had always been on opposite sides of the fence, in their ideas and in where they sat in the Great Hall.
"What is that?" Draco said, pointing at the box.
"I'm fine," Harry snapped. He immediately regretted this, expecting the Headmistress to get angry with him for raising his voice but nothing came out of her mouth for a while.
"What are you talking about?" Harry stepped closer, their shoes almost touching but Draco refused to look at him, staring at the floor to the side.
Harry felt his pulse pounding in his head. This was it, his final Hogwarts Quidditch game ever. He could no longer hear the cheers of the crowd over the sound of his own shaky breath and steady heartbeat. It's now or never.
The Weasley's were the last to leave the hall, the goodbye to the son and brother who could never leave Hogwarts was somber and heartbreaking, even Harry rubbed at the tears in his eyes
"I'm not!" Harry insisted. It was clear that Hermione didn't believe him but she didn't press the issue further.
He screamed as he watched his godfather tumble backwards into the gate, held back by Remus as Bellatrix Lestrange cackled without a shred of remorse after killing her cousin and the closest thing to a father than Harry had ever had.
"Yes, thank you."
"Come on, love birds," Ron yawned, kissing his girlfriend on the forehead and waving to her as she left for the girl's dorms. "Let's go look smashing."
The office was minimalistic and clean. It had a gold and white theme making the room seem bigger as light bounced around the room.
Harry hesitantly slid into the bench next to him, looking up at Ron, who sat opposite, and Hermione's amazed expressions.
"How are you feeling?" Hermione asked, Harry could hear the concerned tone of her voice.
"Thank you, Granger," Draco pulled his lips into a thin line. "But I just need to conclude this essay and then I'll be done for the night."
Harry rolled his eyes with a smile while Anthony tossed the box toward Terry Boot who was reading a book on his bed, the last against the east wall.
As they set about concocting the Forgetfulness potion they were assigned, neither of the boys attempted to make conversation. Harry had no clue what he would even say to the Slytherin after their conversation the other night.
"You need to eat something," said Hermione, clearly listening to their conversation. "Please."
Harry didn't say anything. A new crushing weight sat on his chest. "
"We'll be right back," Harry assured him. "I've got Malfoy's present upstairs."
"Only if you go with my outfit," Draco quipped. Harry sighed but could not wipe the smile from his face.
Hermione was forcing them to study, what was new? The Golden Trio and Draco all sat around a round table in the library, their heads buried in books. Well, Hermione was.
The seventh and eighth year Gryffindor and Ravenclaw students headed down to the Transfiguration corridor to be greeted by a young witch with dirty blonde hair twisted up into a messy bun. She ushered them inside and Harry took his seat with Ron on his left and Hermione to his right.
"You okay?" Draco noticed Harry's anxious fiddling. Harry nudged Draco off him, however not moving the arm that held him, so that he could look Draco in the eye.
"No, why would I?" Harry shook his head.
"I hate you," said Draco.
More names were called until, "Potter, Harry."
"But it's so nice here," Harry forced a laugh.
After lunch, in which Harry half-heartedly ate an apple he decided to take a walk around the garden by himself, out in the fresh summer air. Not two minutes into his stroll, the bustling ginger-haired Weasley sister came bounding up to him.
Harry's gaze lingered on Mrs Malfoy for a second before he turned to leave. He couldn't help the selfish beast in his gut that wanted to condemn the woman for supporting the one responsible for his parents not being here. But he kept his mouth shut, it was for the best.
Draco laughed, finally looking at Harry. "You can tell me if it isn't. I'm just 'testing the waters'."
"But I could, Draco!" Harry snapped at him, making him withdraw his hand. "I'm the problem."
"Well, I called it," said Ron smugly.
"Outside, yeah, but at school, he's Professor Longbottom, isn't he? I can't walk into Herbology and give him love," James rolled his eyes "I'm sure he was flattered enough when he met Reg." Shaking his head at his aunt, who technically wasn't really his aunt, he vented his feeling by aiming a kick at Regulus. "See you later Reg, watch out for the Thestrals."
"I'm sure he would," he added, earning a glare from Harry.
"Yeah, that was your mistake. Never reveal your weakness to your enemies."
"Hello," said Draco Malfoy. Hands in the pockets of his black pants, the Gryffindor scarf he wore at the game hung loosely around his neck.
"It was her idea really." Harry wasn't technically lying but he definitely wasn't telling the whole truth. She had said it aloud, but he had thought it for a while before. "After the war, we both changed. We're different people."
"That, I can work with," Draco smiled.
"Thank you, Potter. I'll see you again this time next week and no sooner I hope."
"Merlin, I love her," Ron smiled, watching her leave.
It was all too suddenly that George was right in front of him. Harry wasn't unnoticed for long, George saw him out of the corner of his eye and leant on the handle of his shovel in the snow.
"I guess. But I can't believe I was stupid enough to even consider it."
He sat up and swung his legs off the side, rubbing his eyes with the heel of his hands. He sighed and gazed across the room at the other blurry boys sleeping soundly, some had their curtains drawn while others let the breeze from the slightly open window brush across their skin.
"Will you two stop it?" Hermione hissed. "Maybe Harry's right, maybe he has changed."
Harry's body fell into autopilot mode as he retreated deeper and deeper into his mind. He opened his textbook and began taking notes while his old bad habits returned.
"You have to understand, that's probably for the best," Draco's voice was very quiet. He yawned. "It's for your safety, after what I saw yesterday it was probably everyone else's too. You dropped like a stone."
"Nope, don't care," Harry laughed, releasing the snitch from his grip and it flew off. Draco shot off after it with Harry following close behind him.
"Fair enough. So think of a new happiest memory," said Draco. "Preferably something that has happened since the war."
He, Ron, Hermione and Ginny all ate ice cream at Florean Fortescue's Ice-Cream Parlour and Harry couldn't help but appreciate how the cold ice cream filled his insides with warmth, a small act of normalcy despite being trapped inside his chaotic mind.
Students began to trickle from the hall and Harry had eaten enough breakfast to satisfy Hermione, so she proceeded to drag Ron from the table who was still stuffing blueberry muffins into his mouth. She was determined to get the two to make up before the end of the day, but Harry wasn't sure it would be that easy. He had expressed his apologies to the both of them yesterday, it was Ron who refused to look past his own stubborn nature and forgive him.
He reached the bottom of the stairs where he waited beside the Gargoyle awkwardly. The stone figure occasionally turned it's head to look at him with a confused look before giving up.
"Teddy's back there," he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam. "Just seen him! And guess what he's doing? Snogging Victorie!"
"I will never unsee that image," Ron groaned from the doorway. "I am forever scarred."
"You're not a Death Eater," Harry frowned. "You chose the right side."
"Good to know you missed me," Harry retorted sarcastically. "Also assistant?"
"It seems like yesterday that I was showin' Harry 'round Diagon Alley and now 'ere you are!"
Draco stood abruptly and left the hall at quite a fast pace.
"I believe you are really trying to improve yourself," McGonagall smiles. "You did not deserve the childhood you received, at least we can try to make your adulthood as boring as possible."
"I was told to let the others know when you woke up," he turned to walk away but stopped. In one fast movement, he leant over Harry and laid a delicate peck on his lips before he was gone.
"Either way, it's good to see that you're acting your age. Now, I don't want to keep Professor Larrowreed waiting. Off you go," McGonagall shoos him from her office with a soft, motherly smile.
He had been in the office on many occasions, most of which was when Professor Dumbledore was in charge. There was the last time during the battle when Snape had been Headmaster. He remembers it being darker, plainer. Harry had thought it empty without Fawkes the Phoenix and all Dumbledore's intricate possessions. He wondered to himself how Professor McGonagall had changed it.
"Yes," Draco opened his eyes, slowly. "I already made sure the robes that we got you matched mine."
Draco's hands found their way onto Harry's hips and he unconsciously stumbled forward. Draco smirked and broke the kiss, but not retreating too far from Harry's face.
The second of May, 1999, one of the warmest days in the year so far. The eighth years had unanimously decided that the day would be set aside from studying for many reasons not including the heat. Some were discussing their hair, outfit, and make-up for the ball this evening while many had chosen to sit alone, reflecting on events that transpired on that day only a year ago.
Harry opened his eyes and stared up at the uncomfortably familiar ceiling of the Hospital wing. He looked around his bed to see Ron talking to Hermione by his bedside.
"You do know how to tie that right?" Draco sighed, much to Harry's relief he was finally buttoning his shirt up.
Harry received a scarlet sweater from Molly, as he did every year. This one had a large '99' on the back with his last name above it. Ron Ginny and Hermione all got one too. George got him a package of various Wizard Wheezes merchandise, Ron gifted him a box of broom biscuits that flew around while you tried to eat them, Hermione bought him a study journal which he pretended to love, and an array of presents from the other Weasleys like socks and sweets.
With a flick of his wand, he tossed the box to the bed next to him. Neville caught it uncertainly. He grew up in a pure-blood household so he knew the risk he was about to take when he dipped two fingers into the box.
He heard the door to the dorm open but he didn't turn to look. He ate the last bit of toast as he felt his mattress dip a foot or two away from him.
The two tumbled into the common room and began tearing at the brown paper before they had even sat down. Harry and Ron stared in awe of the beautiful Firebolt that now lay in their arms.
"Because you
"No, I couldn't," Harry chuckled, placing a hand on his stomach. He wasn't lying, he loved Molly's lasagne but his stomach was still getting used to a healthy amount of food.
"We'd thought we'd tag along to the victory party," said Ernie. "Second place isn't that bad."
He pondered this for a second. Was he really just there for Malfoy. The blonde-haired boy was a few feet in front of him, humming the tune to a song Harry couldn't recognise. Did he consider Malfoy a friend now? He wasn't sure. There was just something about him that intrigued Harry. Was it his dark past? His hidden but genuinely caring personality. His troubled present? His uncertain future? Or maybe something else entirely., something Harry could not put his finger on. He simply felt the need to be with Malfoy as much as he could. To watch out for him, to protect him. And maybe even to let him protect Harry.
"I don't know!" Said Harry, still confused. "Why would he tell me that?"
"What those students did to you, simply a disgrace to Hogwart's name," the nurse said quietly, but not quiet enough. Harry's mind started to race. He began seriously doubting McGonagall's diagnosis of a meagre 'cold'.
"I'll be right back," he said, heading toward them. They didn't seem to notice him as he made his way toward them. He decided this was a good thing.
Harry sat at the Gryffindor table and looked around for that all too familiar box. Ron sat beside him and grabbed a bowl and began to ladle some soup from one of the large bowls in the middle of the table.
"Welcome students to what hopefully will be a more calm academic year," she said with a weak smile, evidently trying to lighten the mood. "We have repaired all the damaged to the building around us but it will take much more time and patience to repair the damage in our hearts. But now we enter a new year, let's get on with the sorting." McGonagall clapped and the ornate doors swung open again and a group of eleven-year-olds led by Professor Sprout entered the hall walking between the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables.
"Let's eat!" Ron decided.
"I don't think so," Charlie hit his younger brother in the back of the head. "I'm the eldest, I'm pulling rank. George, Ginny and I versus Ron, Harry and Malfoy."
"Yeah, that's kind of the point," Hermione grabbed Harry by his robes and pulled him back into motion.
"Did you tell anyone? About our kiss that is."
It was not unusual for Harry to lose track of time while in the air. It was one of the few places he felt calm and at ease.
"Really?" Harry squinted his eyes. "All the way here?"
McGonagall finished her speech and with a flourish of her hand, the golden plates in front of them filled with food and the silver goblets filled with water and pumpkin juice. They tuck in, Even Harry's mouth watered at the sight of the feast laid before them. He picked up a jacket potato and some steamed vegetables and picked at them gingerly, only eating just enough to get his stomach to shut up. Hermione tapped him on the shoulder and pointed up to the staff table. Next to Professor Slughorn sat a young witch with black hair coming down to her collarbones deep in conversation with the potions master.
Harry joined Ron, Hermione and Neville in a couple of armchairs by the fire discussing what they were planning to do when they left Hogwarts.
Harry kicked off the ground and promised himself to not think about Draco Malfoy for the next few hours.
"Hush now, dear," Draco replied sarcastically. "No need to make a scene."
"Everyone's already in their common rooms," Draco chuckled. "Live a little, Potter."
"Professor, he's here!" He shouted, opening the door further for Harry to enter.
This earned a confused sort of cheer from the team but at least Ron seemed pleased with himself.
"Yeah, whatever," Draco grumbled. "I'm sure Weasley will come up here any second for you, Merlin forbid he catches you talking to me."
"Mhmm," Harry folded the parchment carefully before Ron snatched it away from him. "Your disdain is duly noted."
On their arrival, they could not see Draco in the vicinity so they took a seat together on a metal bench facing the brick wall where four times a year, magical teenagers poured in and out.
"You don't get it, do you?" Malfoy yelled, Harry backed off again shocked at the change of tone. "Potter, you and I both know I could rearrange their vital organs with a flick of my wrist, but you know what happens if I even get one negative incident here? I get to go share a cell with my dear old father. I can't fight back Potter, and it hurts me more than these goddamn scars. No one may believe but I still have a shred of pride left and every time I am beaten to the ground by some fourteen-year-olds I am stripped of even that."
"He's probably crying in Hermione's arms right about now," Harry wrapped his arms further around Draco so that they were almost flush against each other.
. What did they mean? Why was Draco's presence making him feel this way?
"It was only an invitation," Harry shrugged defensively.
It was the morning of the Hufflepuff versus Ravenclaw Quidditch match and Harry was looking forward to being able to switch off from class work, from his own thoughts, from Draco Bloody Malfoy.
Silence fell between the two again as Harry opened the box carefully, making sure the confectionary frog inside did not escape. The silence wasn't uncomfortable however, neither of them had anything to say as they sat in each other's presence.
"Well," she clapped suddenly making a few seventh years in the front row jump. She got to her feet and stepped up onto her chair, then her desk to jump down the other side. "Aren't you lucky, third Slytherin in a row teaching you DADA, well, fourth technically as old Mad-Eye didn't do too much teaching," she trailed off. She looked around the class, no one said anything as they didn't know what to say in response to this declaration so she continued with her introduction. "My name is Professor Dellow and I will be pushing you through your final year and shoving you out into the real world." She pulled out a Hawthorn wand and with a flick, she wordlessly summoned ten dummies. "Let's see what you can do."
"I'll have to climb into your bed and get you," said Harry. Draco visibly paled and swallowed hard, Harry smirked at the thought of Malfoy being uneasy because of him. "Because we're talking this out."
Right on queue, Athena flew by and dropped four small packages and one larger one as the breakfast cleared. The brown paper that wrapped the parcels had a name written in neat cursive. Harry picked up the package with his name written neatly on it. It was identical to the other three smaller ones printed with Ron, Hermione, and Ginny. The last package, the bigger one, Ron was holding in and staring at as if it were something otherworldly.
Draco took no hesitation in retreating away from Harry's touch and onto what had been the black haired boy's bed for the past few days. Draco leant against the wall, never ceasing his glare at Harry who was feeling all too confident for his liking.
Ron laughed. "Harry, grab the box, it's your turn."
"Yeah!" Said James enthusiastically. "I don't mind sharing with Reg, Teddy could have my room!"
"Whatever," Terry flicked his wand and absentmindedly sent the box across the wand and onto Malfoy's emerald sheets.
"Never," Draco smirked. "Only postponing."
"This blonde twit better not be who I think he is, Potter," Aberforth warned.
The letter did not come with a sender, Harry already knew who sent it. Harry fumed at the pompous attitude of Malfoy. Why would he leave Ron and Hermione to hang out with him? Homework is more important than flying anyway.
"Sure, but I'm pretty much finished anyway," Draco picked up his Charms textbook, parchment and quill and spotted Ron and Hermione across the room.
Ron smiled at his best friend proudly. Terry looked Harry dead in the eye, and then swept his gaze across all the boys in the room.
"Come in," McGonagall called in response to Harry's knocking at her office door.
Harry set his mug down slowly and turned his head to cautiously face Ron.
"Sorry, Malfoy," said Ron. "My mum, she gets attached easily."
my cousin in law," Draco rolled his eyes.
"You don't?"
"That's not fair!" Protested Harry.
Practically the whole school headed down to the Quidditch pitch, everyone wearing their jumpers and scarves of all house colours but there was an abundance of red and green to support the teams playing that morning.
"What's going on with you? Do you want me to leave?"
"Well boys, let's play Quidditch!" Ginny shouted. "First to twenty-five."
"Okay," Harry replied.
The tryouts were a breath of fresh air for Harry. He felt so at peace to finally be up in the air in brand new Quidditch robes purchased through Owl-Order and his team flying around him.
"Pardon?"
He said it was mostly Neville and Luna who snuck into the forest, often during their Care of Magical Creatures lessons who kept him posted on the happenings inside the school.
The class soon got to work reading through the theory of conjuring spells and Hermione, who had read the chapter over the summer, began to conjure feathers out of thin air, succeeding on her third try.
"Great job, kids," Mr Weasley smiled. "I knew you could do it."
"Actually, Malfoy asked me if I wanted to go with him," Harry said guiltily.
He could tell that Hermione was becoming more and more annoyed at Harry and Ron's childish argument.
Ernie Macmillan snatched the box out of thin air and leant back on Justin Finch-Fletchley, who apparently was his boyfriend.
An eternity seemed to pass before the large doors of the Great Hall opened, signalling for everyone to make their way down to the river.
A wisp of smoke. But Draco did not turn back to Harry.
Few people turned their heads at Malfoy's arrival. The Gryffindor scarf resting on his shoulders camouflaged him to those who were not already looking in their direction.
"Potter!" McGonagall yelled. "That is not what I was insinuating by acting like an adult. Sit."
He looked up to the staff table where Professor McGonagall was already staring back at him, looking quite pleased with herself.
Draco sighed. "We need to talk."
"Hang on, you started that fight," Harry reminded him.
"Granger, Hermione. Outstanding in Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, Astronomy, Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, History of Magic, Muggle Studies, Potions and Transfiguration. It is a privilege to name her the Dux of this cohort."
"I'm sorry," Harry couldn't meet the headmistress' eye.
Harry slid one of the Butterbeers over to Draco who took a small sip thankfully.
Someone knocked on Ron's door and Harry called out for them to come in. Hermione poked her head around the door with fluffy white earmuffs on her head and a deep blue scarf dangling from her neck.
"Harry's acting like a child so McGonagall is treating him like one," Ron elbowed his best friend in the ribs. "A little packed lunch for every meal."
Harry thought it best not to push the subject. "It doesn't matter, i prefer somewhere else over the Three Broomsticks anyway. Come on,"
"'Malfoy!" Harry called.
"When I said that I wasn't expecting this," Hermione shrugged off her coat, hanging it on the back of Ron's desk chair.
"Are those?" Harry reached out his hand, but Draco pulled his sleeve back down quickly and went back to leaning on his arm.
Harry snapped himself out of his stupor and got to his feet to face him.
"Can you not think about your stomach for just five minutes?" Hermione sighed. "You're taking me dancing."
"Great," Harry muttered to himself, never taking his eyes off Draco's smug expression.
"Nonsense, my boy," Dumbledore chuckled. "Everything you have learned over the past seven years prepared you for what was to happen. You vanquished Voldemort again and peace has been restored to the Wizarding, and Muggle, worlds."
Regulus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to move, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son's thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide away from him...
"Shut up, Potter," Draco rolled his eyes before leaning forward, one hand next to Harry's shoulder and connecting their lips. His pale body hovered above Harry's tanned one as they kissed so very softly.
"No, no, no," Justin laughed. "You know how most people are straight, or heterosexual. And then some people are gay, or homosexual. Well, this may just blow your mind but some people are bisexual. They like both boys
"Okay, are you conceding?" Harry raised an eyebrow.
The store was bustling with Hogwarts students, especially third years and it took the Eighth-years a while before being able to leave with their own brown paper bag of sweets.
It was an accident, that's what Harry told himself anyway, when his own green eyes darted down to Draco's pale lips and back up to his eyes.
"Potter I am amazed at how you even passed you O.W.Ls with note taking of this calibre," said Malfoy. "Were you even paying attention?"
Harry was not expecting an offer like that from Draco Malfoy. Harry was also not expecting his mind to take him back to the night in the dark where they had gotten so close. The image of Draco's lips seared across his mind and a hook dig into his stomach, seemingly pulling him toward the blonde haired boy.
"I mean, theoretically," Harry mumbled.
Harry frowned but carefully tore open the package.
Harry spent the day with a feeling of terrible dread in his chest. He had made a complete fool of himself in front of Malfoy and he had avoided him all day.
Harry, try as hard as he might, could not think of a reason to argue against the offer. He knew it would make him feel a thousand times better to be in the sky again.
"Oh," Mrs Malfoy took a second to respond, looking between her son and Harry. "How delightful."
"Malfoy, you idiot!" Hermione yanked the hood back over his head. "You're not supposed to be here. If anyone who works at the Ministry is on that platform and sees you, you will be in so much trouble! We'll be in so much trouble!"
One thing Harry noticed was the Slytherin prince no longer had his head held high and a smug grin on his face. In fact, his shoulders were slumped, making him appear smaller than he was, dark purple rings hung beneath his eyes, twisting his face into a garish and hollow facade. He didn't even spit a poison-laced 'Potter' in Harry's direction as he passed. He had just sat down, avoiding eye contact with the rest of the room, and with a lazy flick of his wand, drew his deep green curtains around the bed.
If he doesn't sleep, the nightmares don't come.
Harry, as he walked, paused for a second to render the fact that Draco Malfoy was walking beside him. Willingly. Without ill intention.
Harry didn't make any effort to reply this time, simply staring at the high ceiling in defeat.
With Ron and Harry still refusing to talk directly with the other, the four discussed their current homework assignments and classwork as they made their way to the Hog's Head; their preferred pub.
Harry lifted his hands in surrender. Draco turned to leave again but Harry lunged forward, grabbing his wrist.
Something hit him in the back of the head. He frowned as he turned around. There was no one behind him. He looked to the floor and there was a small piece of parchment, crumpled up into a ball.
Ron huffed, he clearly didn't have a come back planned for any time soon.
Upon its purchase, Malfoy had sent the company both Harry and his own measurements but still remained adamant that they would be unsatisfactory. Harry on the other hand, who had never had anything tailor-made for him in his life, thought that the robes fit quite well.
Draco placed a hand on his son's shoulder and Harry crouched down so that Regulus' face was slightly above his own. Regulus was a splitting image of his father, they had planned it this way. With the help of a surrogate, Draco fathered their first son and Harry their second. Lily was not theirs, however. They had previously decided they only wanted two kids but upon meeting the beautiful orphan girl they fell in love with her instantly, Harry couldn't let this child grow up without loving parents as he did.
"Well, easy test, did you become my boyfriend because I was there? A distraction? Because you were bored?" Her voice was shaky as she spoke and Harry's heart broke for her.
He flew close to Harry and whispered. "Why is he being nice to me?"
Hermione proceeded to drag Harry Potter across the school to the Hospital Wing with Ron following behind laughing his arse off. Many students stopped in their tracks as they watched the spectacle of bushy-haired Hermione Granger dragging the Chosen One down stone corridor after stone corridor as a mother would drag her moody toddler out of a toy store.
"That's very kind of you, Mrs Malfoy," said Harry.
"Or, cast your mind back even further, almost a year ago now when I lied in front of my parents and some of the most brutal Death Eaters about you. You think I'd do that for anyone else?"
"Yes, I mean, no. But you know what I mean," Ron groaned.
He held it up triumphantly and beamed as the entire stadium erupted into applause.
"Come on, I'm your best mate. You have to tell me."
It took Ron all of one day, with Ginny's help, to ask Hermione to accompany him to the ball to which she, of course, said yes. Harry couldn't help but glance over to Draco on the other side of the common room as they were celebrating.
"Aunt Gin, I can't give a Professor
"No way! I told you mine!" Harry hissed.
"This is it," Harry pushed open Ron's bedroom door. Draco's face said it all and Harry rolled his eyes with a smile. "Nine days, I'm sure you can survive. It's better than being locked up in the castle."
"So you like girls. And Malfoy?" Ron sighed, clearly trying to get his head around the announcement.
"And you don't want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts," Harry put in. "He likes a laugh, your brother."
He watched it fly away and wondered whether he made the right choice.
"I, uh, no," Harry stammered. Malfoy laughed, it even sounded genuine.
"He's been doing that for the past eighteen years!" Ron called out, turning the snickers into outright laughs. Harry looked down to the stone floor as to hide his bright red face and he dropped his arm from Parvati.
He sat up slowly, he didn't feel hurt, he hadn't even been placed under the covers.
"Well, if I had my wand and I happen to accidentally use it on an insolent little weasel like yourself, it's not just me who would get in trouble. You would be aiding in the resist of my arrest!"
"What about my hair? You said once I should grow it out," Harry remembered.
"It's a cursed burn," Draco explained, taking the hand in between his own gently. "Your dreams of becoming a wand model are over, I'm sorry."
"Merlin, you are a travesty!" Draco laughed. "I don't think I want to be seen with you."
"You're a prick," Harry rolled his eyes.
What if he could never conjure one again?
"Can I not have a moment of escape from that blonde twit?" Ron groaned dramatically.
He lay his head on his pillow and watched as Draco Malfoy carefully folded the red and gold scarf on his bedside table.
"Okay. So are you gonna tell me what you want or am I going to have to make a guess?"
"Where is he going to stay?" Ron threw his hands in the air. "Not in here, that's for sure."
It was commonly agreed upon that no one could throw a party like a Gryffindor. The Gryffindor common room was dressed in scarlet and gold decorations and food from the kitchens was continuously brought up by some crafty third years.
There was much applause as Hermione, cheeks bright red, received her diploma from Madam Hooch.
"How are you feeling?" Madame Pomfrey asked the student in a comforting voice, Harry felt a little annoyed she had not spoken to him like that.
"It's no big deal!" Harry tried to reason with him. "Don't freak out."
"You done being creepy?" Draco whispered, smirking as he rubbed his eyes with the heel of his hands.
Showered and dressed in jeans and his Gryffindor jumper, Ginny Weasley invited Harry to the Gryffindor common room for a victorious after-party, telling Ron about it as an after-thought.
Draco waved. He was wearing a Gryffindor scarf and pretending to be miserable. The sentiment almost distracted him from catching the Hufflepuff seeker darting toward the ground. Almost.
Harry nodded and looked at the floor. Hermione nudged his arm and signalled that they should go before Filch does his rounds. It took a while to tear Ron from his recently departed brother but together they headed to the Eighth year's wing. Harry wasn't sure if seeing Fred had made him feel better or just worse.
"Potter!" Yelled Draco, grabbing Harry's wrist and pulling it away from the desk. "I doubt the potion calls for your blood."
"Sucks to be you though," Ron muttered to Harry. "Forced to speak to that git even more."
"And Malfoy catches the Golden Snitch! One Hundred and Fifty points to Slytherin!" Parker shouts into the megaphone. The crowd erupts into a cheer as Slytherin win the game against Ravenclaw.
"A very mature response, Potter," she said, looking over her glasses as if she was still suspicious. "I think Miss Granger has finally rubbed off on you, it's only taken eight years."
"Potter, Potter!"
"Really," Harry rolled his eyes. "You think that's how I'll go?"
Harry got ready for bed quickly, pulling himself under his covers in record time.
"Fabulous," He smiled cynically as he tucked the shirt into his pants.
"Oh, I was beginning to worry you dreamt of me often, Potter," he said with a hint of the old Malfoy cockiness in his voic, clearly wanting to steer clear of any topic close to him and Voldemort.
"You're a little pale, Harry," said Ginny softly. Ron looks at her, then at him.
"I don't think any of the Slytherins will be brave enough to show up," Hermione scoffed. Harry propped himself up on his elbows upon hearing this.
"He said he was minding his own business," said Harry. "And he doesn't seem like that's his idea of fun anymore." Harry took another glance over at Malfoy's blonde head. He glanced down at his watch and sighed. His first meeting with the Headmistress was scheduled for ten minutes in her office. He was dreading it. He didn't feel like talking about his feelings with anyone, let alone McGonagall. He began slowly putting all his things into his bag and waved to Ron and Hermione who tried to give him encouraging smiles as he headed out of the library and to the Headmistress' office.
"Oh fine!" Hermione whispered, looking up from her books. "If the three of you refuse to do anything, you can go."
"Sorry," said Harry, still chuckling.
Draco reached for the paper before he could. "Well, good job, Potter."
Draco scooted closer on the chair to Harry's bedside, firmly holding Harry's hand between his own.
Harry pulled himself off the table and Ron triumphantly placed it in front of him.
"Morning Weasley, Granger," Draco paused. "Potter." Draco was wearing what could only be described as his 'casual' attire. Long sleeve shirt buttoned all the way with smart pants and sensible shoes, all in black of course.
"Mum said you'd be up here," said Ron flatly. His eyes darted between Harry on what he assumed was Draco's bed and the Slytherin himself, red as a tomato standing at the foot. "What were you doing?"
"Perhaps, if someone knew to value their friends over traitors, we wouldn't have a problem," Ron smiled cynically, not looking at Harry.
"I'm trying to have a serious moment here," Harry jabbed him with his elbow.
Nothing else mattered at that moment. Just two tired wizards holding each other for dear life.
"I see."
"Was this particularly distressing for you?" She raised her grey eyebrows.
"Not till our own kids graduate at least," Ron laughed.
Neville blushed and shifted in his seat nervously.
"Why is he in my pub?" Aberforth was clearly unimpressed.
"Look so, we need to talk about what... we are," said Draco. Harry just walked closer to him and looked up at his grey eyes. "What, what are you doing?"
He knocked on the large wooden door of the dungeon classroom where his friends would be bent over textbooks and taking notes. Nobody looked up when Slughorn opened the door to let him in, that is, except Malfoy.
"Malfoy, they're fourth years, can't you fight back?" Harry took a step closer knitting his eyebrows together.
"I'm not turning gay," he said defensively. "I'm not saying being gay is a bad thing, its just, I'm not."
Ron's face immediately afterwards however made Harry's entire day. The look of disgust in both himself and physical contact with Malfoy made Harry laugh harder than he had in a while.
"It was S.P.E.W," she folded her arms grumpily. "And don't act like that."
"I thought you wanted to be an Auror too," Ron frowned.
"They-"
Harry pushed through the other students in order to catch up to Draco ending up on the stone stairs before he could grasp the back of Draco's robes.
"That's not up to you," Hermione shook her head. "I don't want to baby you Harry but you're acting like a child."
Kids. Wow. After eight years of constant threats upon his life, Harry had not really had time to plan his life beyond the grounds of Hogwarts. He laughed quietly to himself upon the realisation that he had no plan and little knowledge of the world ahead of him.
"I'm so sorry," Harry apologised when Draco locked the door before leaning against it and running his fingers through his own hair.
"And fine, I'll tell you what we did. But you cannot tell anyone!" Harry hovered closer to Ron as if anyone could hear them from the ground anyway. "We kinda, sorta. You know, snogged," Harry struggled to get the words out.
Harry strained his ears to hear Malfoy's reply but none came, the Slytherin boy simply grunted in pain every so often as Madame Pomfrey was administrating whatever treatment she seemed to be applying.
"Yes actually," Draco glanced toward Harry. "Our favourite golden boy has been neglecting his health again so I am here to make sure he doesn't fall into old habits." He placed his hand on Harry's knee for a second, making the Gryffindor blush.
"So I have some rather odd news," said Hermione as the three of them were making their way up to the castle from the Green Houses. "Guess who decided to accompany me during History of Magic."
"Freak out?" Ron's voice cracked a little. "This is a loaded announcement, Harry!"
two chapters left, gang
"Are you two quite done?" Hermione sighed, getting to her feet and heading toward the door. "I'm going to spend my afternoon with the more civilised members of this household. If the two of you would like to have a conversation that doesn't include arguing about Draco bloody Malfoy, you can come to get me then."
"Can I come in?" Draco whispered. Harry nodded, wiping his face to clear it of any tears that may have appeared while he dreamt and pushed himself up against the headboard, crossing his legs and grabbing his glasses.
"I'm fine, thanks," grumbled Harry.
Harry choked on his Butterbeer. "No, no, no!"
"Even after all these years of pointing out all our flaws, you're such a Gryffindor sometimes," chuckled Harry, referring to his stubborn nature.
"Well, captaincy isn't an excuse for laziness," Harry forced a smile, Hermione said that forcing a smile would help him feel more positive. Something about chemicals.
The Forbidden Forrest was cold and dark. The wind whistled through the leaves above and caused the small amount of light that was reflected off the moon above which illuminated the grassy path to shift and at times disappear.
McGonagall had confirmed Harry's fears that he would have to speak to some of the guests so Hermione and Draco helped him pick out some handsome new robes so he would look somewhat presentable.
"Come on," he poked Harry's thigh. "This stuff isn't gonna learn itself."
Harry zipped in and out of the other players in pursuit of the Golden Snitch just a few feet in front of him. The Hufflepuff Seeker, Summerby, was right on his tail.
"Uh, Malfoy. We were just talking about what we are planning on doing after graduation, what about you?" Hermione asked. Harry cast a thankful smile her way for making Draco included.
Harry felt it before he saw it. The tiny wings brushed his cheek as if taunting him when it flew past his face and toward the Slytherin goal posts.
"I only said he
"Could I ask you why you're so insistent on alone time, Potter?"
Harry felt glad to part from Parvati as she wandered off with her sister to some of their seventh-year friends. The ball had seemed to not have officially begun. The students and guests seemed to be merely standing around, clinging to the edges of the room. Harry stood silently, watching the other people in the room, Ron on his left and Draco on his right. It seemed that almost the entire school had decided to make an appearance at the ball, Harry could glimpse many students through the doors in the Entrance Hall which was equally as lavishly decorated.
"Hopefully I'll be able to catch some of the game," Harry shrugged.
"Fine. How long have you had these 'not gay feelings' for Malfoy?"
"No!" Harry yelled, jabbing the him in the stomach to make him double over, grabbing the parchment from his hand. He picked his wand up from the stretcher bed and tapped the parchment lightly with it so a thin ribbon snaked out of it and around the letter as he rolled it into a cylinder. The ribbon tied itself off in a neat bow and left a little for Harry to tie to Pig's leg when he opened the cage.
"Harry?" Dennis snapped him out of his spiralling thoughts. "Are you okay."
Harry laughed to himself as he slipped into the other shower stall, hanging his robes and towel on the hook on the door before reaching over to turn the water on.
She leant back into the chair and folded her arms across her chest.
Harry had never been more anxious for his potions tutorial to start. He walked briskly down the halls, holding onto the strap on his bag with one hand against his chest.
"Keep your voice down, too," Ginny chastised.
"Potter, I invited you here to extend two invitations, one I hope you'll accept and the other you don't have a choice but to," she said from the opposite side of the desk, watching Harry over her thin framed glasses.
"Hey, Harry!" He spun on his heel to see Ginny behind him, her face serious and eyes darting between him and Malfoy.
"I'm going to get some air," Draco turned, taking his coat off its hook and leaving Ron and Harry alone together.
Harry stole a glance at Malfoy's bed as he thought about the attackers who put him in the Hospital wing.
He remembered how Malfoy told him he was ambushed by a few students and Harry could only assume they were Gryffindors.
"I can' believe you broke in ter the Ministry of Magic! With Polyjuice potion!" He exclaimed as Ron told him about their escapade with their stolen identities.
Draco stepped past Harry with no word to him. He stood very still for a few seconds before brandishing his wand. "Expecto Patronum."
Harry sat at the back of the table, only engaging in conversation when prompted by Ron or Hermione. He sat and stared at the plaques on the back wall, listing the students who gave their lives whether underage or barely seventeen. He couldn't tear his eyes away, it was like seeing them dead again.
"You know. I do enjoy having you out of your comfort zone, Draco." Harry chuckled.
"What? No!" Harry stopped in his tracks. "I can't, we can't. We can't be boyfriends, he's a, a boy!"
"I'm not hungry," Harry replied, picking up a piece of toast and tearing off a piece to nibble on.
"Let me play Quidditch, that's all I ask," Harry adjusted his position on McGonagall's orders. "And I guess Ron, Hermione, and Draco can help me."
"Oh, you'll give her a heart attack," said Fred cheekily. "And the look on Georgie's face will be priceless."
"Thanks," Harry muttered. "It's just, nobody understands. I have caused so much pain for not just myself but so many other people. I gave up after the war, I really did. It's like, my brain couldn't function."
He leaned forward to connect his lips with Draco, holding the side of his face in his left hand.
"My dear, Harry," Slughorn peered into his cauldron with a disappointed look as the clock threatened the end of the day. "It seems your year off has offended your potion skills. Perhaps you need a tutor," he sighed as he vanished the contents of the cauldron. "Fifteen points to Gryffindor, Miss Granger. I'm looking forward to the rest of this year with you."
"I think you've been hanging around Justin and Ernie too much," Harry shook his head, picking up the quill from the ink pot adding a few words to his letter.
Harry nodded, fiddling with the ends of his tie.
With a flick of his wand, the hoods came off the prisoners to reveal Ron and Draco, struggling against their bonds. Their mouths were gagged and tears were running down their faces.
Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the first of September was as crisp and golden as an apple, and as the little family bobbled across the rumbling road toward the great, sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the air. Two large cages rattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing, the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the brown-haired girl trailed tearfully behind her brother, clutching her father's arm.
"Merlin!' Ron gasped. "You're joking." Harry shook his head. Neither of them said anything for a while.
The merriment was contagious amongst the Gryffindors, some third years set off some of the Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes indoor fireworks with showered red and gold sparks across the room, flashing images of the players' faces, and words like 'Win!' and 'Lions!' and 'Gryffindor!'
"It's going to be weird not having to deal some life threatening nonsense this year," Ron mused earning him a glare from his girlfriend for his bad grammar. Harry just grunted in reply. He hadn't slept well last night, leaving him drowsy and with a dull headache. Images of the crumbling and broken walls of Hogwarts swamped his mind, the lifeless bodies of those who fell victim to his own failings strewn amongst the debris. Ron's bedroom wall was a much preferred sight to his nightmares.
Harry scowled but turned back to face the back of Ron's head and offered his arm to Parvati. Ron was very happy that he was able to wear some nice robes for this ball, and that he got to take Hermione who was smiling as she clung to his arm.
Harry fell into the seat next to Draco. Harry was sure that something Madame Pomfrey gave him was messing with his head because Draco reached over and slowly threaded his fingers through his own. He looked down at the phenomenon that was resting on his thigh with wild eyes.
"Can you quit it with that?" Malfoy raised his voice, reaching into his pocket forcefully as if to threaten Harry with his wand. His face fell and he slowly retracted his hand. For a second Harry was not sure what would happen next, whether Draco would curse him, shout, punch him in the nose, or even cry.
"The creature that 'haunted it' has... passed on," Harry felt a pain in his heart as he thought of Lupin. "It's just an old house now."
"Uh, thank you, Professor," Harry nodded, looking at his scuffed shoes. "It was mostly luck really."
"Well, I'm sure you've decided on an excellent team. Now that I have stepped down from my position as Headmaster, I can officially say that I will be rooting for you," said Dumbledore. Harry shot a glance at Snape. 'Stepped down', more like murdered. Harry had to remind himself of the circumstances of his death. How it was all planned out to save Malfoy's innocence. He had to remind himself that he couldn't be angry at Snape who had to murder the man who had given him everything because it was him who had asked him to do it.
He had been finally cornered in the Headmaster's office, no wand to defend himself with. The undead bodies of Fred Weasley, Remus Lupin, Lavender Brown, Nymphadora Tonks and Colin Creevey stalked toward him, a hoard of others behind them.
As usual, the sorting hat sung it's song, this one about new beginnings and friendship, and sorts the first years into the four houses. Harry's stomach gave a familiar grumble reminding him that he had passed up the sweets on the train and hadn't eaten anything since that slice of toast this morning.
"Well, before I knew I was a wizard, I didn't have an attempt on my life every five seconds," Harry snapped.
He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Regulus' face when he said it. But now the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outline of parents were swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders. Regulus jumped onto the carriage and Draco closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on and off the train, seemed to be turned toward Harry.
"Don't you dare talk about my father!" Draco roared.
"Where are your manners, Potter?" He nodded to where his arm held his assigned partner, Susan Bones' hand. "Be a gentleman."
"What happened?" Draco asked. The first silent spell must have created a soundproof bubble around Harry's bed.
"Excellent, as always," Draco rolled his eyes. "Can I expect an 'O' grade from you as well?"
Now that Draco's face was back in focus, Harry smiled and leant forward to connect their lips.
"Yeah, shut up. What is going on?" Harry questioned him.
"I've never had any sort of feelings for a boy before, at least I don't think I have. Not until this year, not until... him."
"Will you be okay here?" Harry ignored him.
"I hate you too," said Harry.
He had still not talked to Draco, not about their relationship at least. The stress of looming exams and his own stubbornness got in the way every time.
"But arguing about Malfoy is my third favourite hobby," said Ron sarcastically once he was completely sur his girlfriend was out of earshot. Harry tried to stifle a chuckle.
"I'm not going to coddle you
Harry pulled his hand to his head and to his amazement, Park was still sitting there with his rubbing hers.
"Thank you Aberforth," Harry smiled, signalling for Draco to do the same.
"Good morning everyone," she said enthusiastically. "Welcome to your second year of N.E.W.T transfiguration, My name is Professor Larrowreed." The class didn't respond, still amazed at how upbeat she seemed to be at eight o'clock in the morning. "You must have been expected Professor McGonagall but sadly she can not join us as she is far too busy with her duties as Headmistress so you're stuck with me." Ron raised his eyebrow at Harry. This professor didn't seem all there, she reminded them of another blonde hair ditz across the room in a blue scarf and reading the Quibbler under her desk.
McGonagall nodded. "I believe you should trust your friends more with telling them how you feel. You know, I think that would be good for you to vent your emotions."
"How did you know you were gay?"
"You waited up for me?" Harry felt a little relieved that he did, Ron or Hermione would have berated him as soon as he entered the room. "I supposed you're going to tell me off for avoiding you again."
"Keep stirring!" Draco scolded. "I want something. A reasonable excuse as to why you have been avoiding me since we ki-"
"Expecto Patronum!" Harry yelled. A wisp of silver smoke exploded from the tip of his wand, a wisp of smoke with the legs of a deer, however.
"Merry Christmas, Draco."
Madame Maxime and her two students greeted him with incredibly thick accents, he managed to catch the girl speaking very fast about how her brother had attended the Triwizard tournament and had met him to which Harry merely smiled awkwardly.
"Potter, Weasley!" A voice shouted from the ground. It was Draco Malfoy, hands in his coat pockets and Nimbus 2001 held between his elbow and his waist.
"Then you're not gay," said Ginny with a sad smile. "If you feel the same way about him as you did me, you're not gay."
"I'm fine, I've just lost my regular appetite," Harry defended himself.
"Don't mention it, please don't talk. If you keep talking I'm probably going to cry again," Draco rubbed his eyes with his sleeve.
Harry laid on his back, happily watching an uncomfortable Malfoy attempt to maintain his aloof front.
"I know, I know!" Harry cut Ron off in a harsher tone than he had anticipated. "I've got it under control."
Malfoy raised an eyebrow and turned away from Harry, clearly pretending to be interested in the hem of his robes.
"This might come as a shock to you, Potter," Malfoy began in a very thick sarcastic voice. "But you're famous. When you defeated the Dark Lord the entire wizarding world knew everything about you from your birthdate to all the colours that specked your stupid little eyes."
Harry had stopped listening to the commentary and had no idea of what the score was. Unless Slytherin had completely incapacitated Ron and were just tossing the Quaffle back and forth through the hoop, he was confident that they had not overtaken their score.
He passed the box to Justin who laughed. "No thanks, I'm not in the mood to potentially bring up my dinner."
He continuously saw Draco out of the corner of his eye, looking in his direction during meals or perhaps across the common room. But now when Harry caught him, Draco no longer glanced away hurriedly. Instead, he preferred to place a mysterious smirk on his face and initiate a battle of the wills, refusing to be the first to look away.
"You want to play dirty, Potter?" Draco said before shoving Harry off course.
Victorie! Our cousin! And I asked Teddy what he was doing-"
He made a dash for his slippers and his robe, pulling it around him to conserve the small amount of heat that he had. He headed to the door to make his way to the bathroom but as soon as he opened Ron's bedroom door the smell of bacon, eggs and toast filled his nostrils.
"I don't know," Harry shrugged.
"Because it needs to be so much more cramped in here," Ron rolled his eyes.
Draco slowly made his way over to Ron who was a few meters away now, returning to his and Harry's previous positions.
"What are we gonna do for the rest of the day?" Harry asked.
Harry noticed the stone wall of the corridor abruptly turn from dusty and dark grey to a clean and lighter tone. This must be the new wing. It was decorated much like the rest of the castle with paintings and statues lining the walls and pillars on the corners. The group climbed a flight of stairs and came to a landing with a beautiful set of doors, dark wood with black iron hinges and ornate patterns reaching across the door.
"Professor Slughorn has informed me of your need for a tutor," she looked over her glasses, raising an eyebrow at him.
"No, Ginger and Bushy-tail would have my head if they don't," Draco shrugged.
"Where have you been?" Scolded Hermione in a hushed voice, her eyes darting around.
Rose, who was already wearing her brand new Hogwarts robes, beamed at him.
He walked briskly in the direction in which Malfoy left, scanning the halls from him before spotting the back of his blonde head.
As Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy walked shoulder to shoulder from the eighth year wing to dinner that evening they received some stares and some whispers but Harry couldn't care less, his mind was occupied elsewhere.
"Malfoy," Ron grumbled in acknowledgement.
Harry could see the hesitation in Malfoy's grey eyes. He looked terrified. Harry watched as his wand arm trembled, and he kept biting his lip, trying to gain the courage to cast the most unforgivable curse.
"Oi!" Ron shouted. The blurs had no chance of hearing that so Ron touched his wand to his throat, casting the Sonorus charm. "OI!"
"Me?" Harry frowned.
Malfoy had moved back into the Eighth year dorm by the weekend, hex free. Harry tried to meet his eye whenever their paths met but he could never get Malfoy to raise his gaze.
He slid it towards Ron who, as per Harry's instruction, did not react. In fact, for several seconds Harry was worried that he had broken his best friend and he could hardly detect an even an intake of breath from Ron.
What they didn't understand, and Harry didn't either until recently, was that Malfoy had already paid so heavily for his crimes, both those that were placed upon him and those he made of a conscious decision. He had paid in the separation from his father and the house arrest of his mother. But he had also paid with the emotional toll of the horror he had experienced under the influence of Lord Voldemort.
"You have to tell 'Mione," Ron shook his head, still in disbelief.
"The difference between Wormwood and Bitterroot? Because I agree, they have many similar qualities." Draco said smugly.
Ginny pushes past the other students and into the common room and then presumably up to her dormitory to compose the letter.
"Ah, Mother, I have something of an announcement to make," Draco turned to her. "Potter and I, we have become very close. To put it colloquially, we are boyfriends."
He had one of the worst nightmares of the last few months that night. Even after the amazing afternoon, he had with Draco, once he fell into unconsciousness, his mind was plagued with memories of the war as it was every night.
"And to think, titchy first years sleeping in our old beds!" He groaned.
Harry and Ron descended a few meters, just so they were in comfortable talking distance of him.
be in Slyth-"
"No need to be dramatic, Potter. That's my thing!" Said Draco.
"What In Merlin's name are you doing?" Draco folded his arms.
"Good morning, Malfoy," Harry smiled to himself.
"Haven't what?" McGonagall leans forward in mock interest.
"Is this guy bothering you, Harry?" A few meters away and glaring at Malfoy was Fred Weasley's ghost.
"Come on, Potter," Draco said, holding his broom in one hand. Harry smiled as he saw him wearing the sweater Mrs Weasley knitted for him.
"Parked all right then?" Ron asked Harry. "I did. Hermione didn't believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you. She thought I'd have to Confund the examiner."
Harry shrugged off his school robe and placed it on his bag upon the grass. He loosened his tie and picked a hair, presumably Crookshanks', from his jumper.
"Mhmm," Harry nodded. That was a lie. His stomach was twisting and his hands were shaking underneath the desk.
The lesson continued as one by one they showed off their skills at different spells both defensive and offensive. Professor Dellow would periodically yell out a different spell and they'd all take turns, stepping forward and blasting light at the dummies.
The air was chilly and the sky was overcast but this did not stop plenty of students, second through to seventh year, from coming down to the pitch to try out. There were many familiar faces in attendance but Harry tried to keep in mind that he needed to be strict and without favouritism, well, maybe not when it came to Ron.
"That you have been hanging out a lot, you have feelings for him. You kissed," she sighed.
"Watch it, Malfoy," Harry hissed.
"Merlin, Harry, sometimes I forget you know absolutely nothing," said Ron. He pointed to the two students and older witch in the least subtle way. "They're from Ilvermorny, the American wizard school."
"You are so annoying," Draco said before planting a chaste kiss on Harry's lips.
He was on his way to the Hospital Wing without a thought for breakfast. When he woke up barely half an hour earlier he noticed that Malfoy was not still sleeping soundly in his bed, nor was he sitting in one of the plush armchairs of the common room, Harry knew there was only one place he could be.
The seconds felt like hours as the two glanced around the platform. Harry was even about to give up and go back to the burrow when out of the corner of his eye, he saw Draco Malfoy appear out of thin air on the other platform.
"What does this have to do with me needing a tutor?" Harry sighed, resting his elbow on the arm of the chair and placing the side of his head on his fist.
"I wonder who else is going back to Hogwarts," Hermione said while sorting Harry, Ron, and her school supplies again.
Harry sat on his scarlet and gold four-poster bed in his pyjamas, watching Ron take a bean from a box of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans.
"Oh, you're here!" She beamed and extended her arms to pull the four of them into her arms. "It's so nice that you can apparate now, makes my life a lot easier without the trip up to London."
What was it about the Slytherin boy that captivated Harry so? Was it their shared history entangled with the Dark Lord? Or perhaps something more? Draco's neatly combed fringe fell forward, almost touching his eyebrow and Harry couldn't help himself but study every detail of his face. Harry wondered to himself how he had never heard of any girlfriends of Malfoy's. He was, of course, handsome, Harry wasn't insecure enough to admit that. He cast his mind back to a conversation he had with Ron a few days ago. He had never considered the possibility that Draco could be gay. Surely he wasn't, someone of his proud heritage couldn't, could he?
"Fine." Harry rolled his eyes. "Hey, I need to ask you for help."
Draco threaded his fingers through Harry's as he chuckled. Harry stares down at their knotted hands curiously, as if their appearance was something out of the ordinary, which it was.
"And then?"
The whisper was for his fathers alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced Regulus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was.
Harry grabbed a piece of parchment from the desk and scribbled
"Please don't freak out," Harry grimaced.
"Every so often," Draco was clearly getting annoyed with him, but kept his tone at a condescending monotone. "Nothing but a wisp of smoke."
"Expecto Patronum!"
"I can just get you to tutor me, Hermione," Harry looked up. "You got an O on your O.W.L."
"Well, for the first seven years of us knowing each other, I was downright horrible to you," Draco reasoned. "Weasley is your best friend, I wouldn't blame you if you chose him over me. It was just a dream."
"I'm so happy you've let us stay for the holidays again," said Hermione. Harry couldn't help but remember how she had made her own parents forget she existed and sent them to the other side of the globe. Unlike him, she had no other option of where to spend her Christmas break.
Ron rolled his eyes and remained sulking in his chair. Hermione gave Harry a small smile in support.
"Ah, Potter." The Professor snapped him from his daydream by a  large window. "I just received an owl from Professor Dellow, are you quite alright?"
"We shouldn't be late for dinner," Hermione broke the tension aptly, pulling her coat tighter around herself. Draco nodded his head silently. Hermione, clearly done with the awkward silence, apparated back to the Burrow, leaving the two boys alone on the platform.
"Alright Potter, let's get this over with," said Malfoy in such a quiet voice that Harry would have missed if he hadn't been listening so intently.
Harry couldn't help but notice the thin scars around the mark. There was heaps of them, but none obscured the tattoo.
"What was that for? You threw it at me!" Malfoy bellowed.
Harry elected to ignore his comment about his friends but he decided to take a different tactic. "Meet me at midnight then, in front of the fireplace."
"On the bright side Harry, we're going to Hogsmeade today, she can't curse all the food in a town can she?" Ron tries to cheer him up. "We can go to Honeydukes and the Three Broomsticks and-"
"Like hell you are!" Said Hermione. "You both have Defence Against the Dark Arts tomorrow. The paper in the morning, and a practical exam in the afternoon! You're not sleeping until you've had at
"He's suffering," Harry threw himself down onto Ron's bed. "I wouldn't want to be alone in that castle either."
"Well, you're the one who's missing out," Draco sighed slid the glasses back onto Harry's face.
"I wasn't planning on missing out on seeing my favourite niece and nephew off to their first year at Hogwarts. Lily and Hugo frowned at her words which caused Ginny to laugh before correcting herself. "My favourite
It was Harry's turn to play Chaser again. Ron threw the Quaffle toward him but without the familiar charm placed upon it, the ball acted like any regular muggle ball, refusing to defy gravity. Harry shot after it, angled toward the ground at terrific speed. He tried to shake off the dizziness attempting to take him as he focused on the ball. The ground was getting closer now, Harry stretched out his arm to catch the ball. Harry couldn't hear Ron's shouts to pull up, he couldn't keep his eye's open and he felt like he was going to vomit.
. He looked around as his left leg bounced anxiously. He didn't even know if Malfoy was coming! How long would he wait anyway? Hermione placed a hand on his knee to stop him moving.
"Actually, no. It was about my mother-"
"Ever heard of the Broom shed?" Harry asked sarcastically. Malfoy rolled his eyes before strolling toward the shed.
And with that Ron and Harry were left alone again. Silence remained between them. It was clear to Harry that Ron was still annoyed that he had invited Draco and he could understand where he was coming from. Harry sat up next to him but he still did not initiate conversation.
Draco scowled at him but couldn't help a smile, giving himself away as he glared at his husband.
"No, of course. And congratulations on your wonderful N.E.W.Ts. I'm sure your parents would be so proud."
(See the end of the chapter for
They continued until they reached the end of the road.
"No, no," Harry assured. "Not up to anything. I've had an alright week."
"That wasn't quite what I was expecting," Hermione smiled a little when Harry revealed his secret to her. She glanced back to Draco who was beginning the potion set for the lesson.
"Only if you'll come and be my keeper," Harry nodded at him, lifting a bread roll in a mock toast.
Harry felt Draco's hand on his knee before he saw the Slytherin boy. He looked up into his grey eyes, full of worry.
The hint of nostalgia Harry got when a glimpse of the broom at the beginning of the game caught him off guard momentarily but he knew that he couldn't let that distract him.
In the week since the announcement of the Remembrance Ball, Hogwarts was filled with excitement. Rumours were spreading about who the guests of honour would be. Some speculated that the presidents of Magical communities across the globe would be in attendance while some were convinced that McGonagall was inviting magical celebrities to the castle.
"I'm sure you didn't give him permission to tell anyone but Ron cracked and told me everything. About you and...
"But, I don't despise the idea of working within the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. But I doubt they'd let me in anyway," Draco absentmindedly tapped his left forearm.
Harry saw Malfoy wander up the stairs to the dorm rooms and he excused himself from watching Neville and Ernie's heated game of Gobstones to follow him.
"Perhaps," said Harry. "But I want to know why you don't want to tell me what happened?"
"Would you like to be captain of the Quidditch team this year?"
He had a moment of self-realisation. Why was he doing this? As much as he wanted to, he wasn't sure if he could trust Malfoy, the kid was still unpredictable and highly sensitive. He knew Ron and Hermione would be furious when they found out that his bathroom break was just a rouse to slack off, slacking off with Malfoy would just make things even worse.
"I want Draco Malfoy to tutor you."
"Of course, I have been carrying you all year," Draco shrugged. "Pass me those Lionfish Spines."
He couldn't attend the ball, he just couldn't. But what if they wanted him to make an appearance especially, talk with the guests? He really couldn't do that. He closed his eyes as the excited conversations of students grew ever louder.
"She has a point, you know," Hermione lectured.
"Yes," Harry said finally.
"Would it kill you to shut up? Got it!" Harry pushed himself back onto his feet and extended the object toward Malfoy.
Draco opened his eyes slowly. He looked up at Harry through his eyelashes and Harry felt the same feeling he felt last night on the tree stump.
"Because I think we're friends now," said Harry, taking full advantage of this moment of vulnerability not often seen from Malfoy.
The Snitch was the only thing he could see, Summerby, the game, the crowd and ground beneath him faded to a blur. Nothing else mattered.
"Oh, you need to lighten up, Potter," Malfoy rolled his eyes before walking away. "Are you coming or not?"
Harry sighed, knowing he couldn't win against Draco's will. But he couldn't help himself as he leaned against the table, watching Draco do the work that he himself probably should be doing.
"Is he gay?"
"What do you want? Other than personal information that is."
Draco stood abruptly dragged Harry up from where he was sitting by his wrist. "Come on."
"Ron, it may just be possible that you're the one not seeing sense," Hermione suggested.
"That's enough, Park," Malfoy stepped in front of her, making direct eye contact with Harry. "They reserved it, let's go."
"I still don't know why you didn't send him to Azkaban," Ron shook his head. "He tried to kill Dumbledore! He tried to kill us!"
"And what about that night at the Weasley's in the forest?"
Harry nodded. They stowed away the broom under Harry's bed and head back down to the Great Hall just as the students began to disperse for first class.
"You did what?!" Ron yelled.
memory before?" Draco asked. "And why doesn't it work now?"
"Yes, but Slughorn thought Harry was good even though he was just copying Snape's work," she pointed out with a disapproving tone. "You've never been very good at potions." Ron shot her a dirty look but she was right.
"Already eager to give up?" Draco asked.
"When Voldemort died." Malfoy flinched again. "Did, you know, the mark disappear?"
"Honestly? I don't know," Harry looked up, locking their eyes. He could see his bright green eyes reflected in Draco's grey ones which were studying his face carefully as if trying to deduce whether Harry was lying or not. "I feel something. I want to be around you, I want to impress you, I want to make you smile. I never thought I could feel this way about a-"
"I don't want sorry," Ron finally looked at him, fire in his eyes. "I want you to promise me, right here, right now. I want you to promise me, and Hermione, and Neville bloody Longbottom for that matter, that Malfoy will never pull you away from us. He will never, ever, distract you from what matters. Us."
"No I do not, and besides, what if Hermione actually was my best mate?"
"I know you're going to go talk about feelings," Ron grumbled. "You know, I'd like to be included."
Hermione didn't say anything but grabbed his hand and she apparated them to the station as she was, like most things, more proficient at this form of magic.
"Hey, Justin," he said nervously. The Hufflepuff looked in his direction with his toothbrush in his mouth, a small amount of toothpaste dripping over his lip.
"So you didn't mean it?" Harry nodded, pulling away from Draco and heading the bathroom to get ready for bed.
"Who did you choose?"
"As a matter of fact, I did Confund the examiner," Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted Regulus' trunk and owl onto the train. "I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let's face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that."
"If you say another word about it, I'm going to break your ribs," Draco snarled. Harry only laughed, grabbing his broom and walking over to Draco.
Ron did not respond to this but Harry could tell he was still annoyed that he had kept this a secret, even unintentionally, from him.
"Just know that this is only delaying the conversation, you can't avoid it forever," Draco warned.
"Oh, just..." Harry hesitated. "Malfoy."
"Too weak," Draco shrugged. "Try something else."
Harry emerged into a clearing where Voldemort stood alone waiting for him, his blood red eyes fixated upon him.
Over the summer Harry's affections toward Ginny had almost been extinguished. Yes, she was very pretty, and she was always there with a mug of hot chocolate for him. His overwhelming guilt and depression had overshadowed that.
"What are you looking at Potter?" Malfoy snapped. Harry hadn't realised he had been looking at the boy beside him.
"Yes, Hermione," Harry nodded.
"A fitting end to Harry Potter?" Draco smirked and finally relaxed his hands into Harry's, leaning forward into him a little. "Something idiotic. Like you come barrelling in to save the day and you trip over your feet and crack your head open on the floor."
Draco picked them up almost as soon as Harry had set them down and slid them onto his face.
"Good. Now, how do you think I can help you?"
However, the opportunity for the first shower was something Harry was not going to lose. He grabbed his robes and towel before heading into the en-suite sleepily.
Harry nodded.
"Let's go," Draco whispered in Harry's ear. They headed back to the eighth year common room and their dorm to put away their things.
"Yes?"
Harry reached his hand behind him, running it across the fabric of the sheets. The hand of the intruder covered his and they continued their mournful silence.
"It would be heavier and able to be pulled all in one direction. It would probably suit you."
Neville -"
"Weasley," Malfoy sighed.
For the first time in a while, Harry ate till he was full which wasn't a lot in perspective, but Harry felt a small spark of pride in his chest at the trivial accomplishment.
Harry quickly found Ron, Hermione, and Ginny who pulled him into a celebratory group hug. Finally released, Harry looked around for Draco but barely caught the back of his head turning the corner, heading back up to the main part of the castle.
"Please, if my son approves of you, it's Narcissa," she smiled.
It took no time at all for the two of them to reach the pitch, newly repaired and even improved after the war. They found a basket of spare quaffles toward the back of the wooden storage shed and took one out into the field.
"Is this a regular sort of dream?" Malfoy asked. Their eyes met and Harry could see no ill-intent in the boy's eyes.
"Who knows?" Draco shrugged. "They don't really like that you let us off so easily."
No one said anything, the quiet crackling of the fireplace and the peaceful ambience of the busy street outside where the only sounds preventing total silence.
"I can tell you don't," Draco rolled his eyes. Silence fell between them and Draco took a calming breath and laid his head on Harry's shoulder. Harry smiled a little. "What did McGonagall say when you woke up?"
"No, this is for your own safety Potter," said McGonagall firmly, she picked a package off the table next to his bed and gave it to him. "While you were unconscious you missed dinner. You can return to your dorm when you've finished it. Goodnight, Potter."
"A boy of your age and your athletic lifestyle should not weigh this little. I've asked your friends too. They've noticed that you've been eating hardly enough or even skipping meals altogether for several months now."
"Good afternoon, Professor," said Harry. Snape peered at him sceptically.
The look on his face warmed Harry's heart so deeply that he completely forgot about his anger. He smiled as Draco raised a hand to his mouth, his grey eyes threatening to spill tears.
"Yeah, sounds perfect," Harry sighed in defeat. Malfoy seemed pretty happy with himself and pulled out his textbook and notes onto the table.
"Hey, no. We are not doing this right now. Was it them? Did they put you in the Hospital Wing again?"
"Granger told me that you would be here."
"I will, I just thought I'd... you know... tell you first. You're my best mate," Harry shrugged.
"Wicked," Ron whispered. Though he held a beautiful broom in his hands, Harry could not help the pang of guilty sorrow he had for his old faithful broomstick. He knew it was selfish to resent the expensive item in his hands. "Let's go down to the Quidditch pitch this afternoon."
Harry looked to Malfoy to monitor his snarky remark, but none came. His only reaction was a scowl in George's direction.
"Nothing," Harry shrugged. "Just a nightmare."
Harry watched him as Draco scanned the room for him. Their eyes met. Malfoy bowed his head as he made his way over to him. Harry worried that the reason he was late was because those nitwits tried to harass him again.
"Hello, Draco," he said softly. Draco didn't turn around but instead, he moved so that he was no longer sitting in the middle of the stump, but to one side as if silently inviting Harry to sit with him.
Harry groaned and reached his fingers into the box. This time the toast didn't disappear from his fingertips.
"Perhaps," Draco looked to the floor. "It's not like you were using it."
"What a gentleman," Hermione giggled in Harry's ear. He swatted her away.
"What I need to talk to you about is you and Ernie," Harry leant against one of the poles of Justin's bed. "How did you two start, being... together?"
Harry nodded. For whatever reason, he was expecting something else from Malfoy.
"Well, it was some nightmare, Potter. I'm surprised you didn't wake up the whole castle."
The four of them settled in for the long train ride. Ron and Hermione opposite Harry and Draco. As the train hummed to life and the scenery around them began to move at increasing speed, Draco lay his head on Harry's shoulder and Harry felt an overwhelming sense of calm wash over his body. He looked out of the train window at the stone castle in the distance.
"Not Spew again," Ron groaned. Hermione hit him over the back of the head with her palm.
"Really, Potter?" Draco laughed. "Of course I have, you're such a prude."
"Two years," sniffed Lily. "I want to go
"Malfoy?" Ron gasped. Hermione nodded.
For a second Malfoy's head shot around to look at him before returning to focus on whatever he was doing. "Yes?"
The score was 70 – 50 to Gryffindor and Harry still had not seen the snitch. He kept his eye on the Slytherin's seeker whose first name Harry did not know but the name 'PARK' was printed on the back of her emerald quidditch robes.
Draco narrowed his eyes sceptically before reaching his pale hand into the box and pulling out two and popping one into his mouth.
"First crush, go," said Ron, chuckling to himself.
Hagrid seemed close to tears when he opened the door of his Groundskeeper's hut to see Harry, Ron and Hermione beaming up at him. He quickly engulfed the three in a rib-crushing hug which left them gasping for air.
That was the best way Harry could articulate his feelings. That moment when a wave has just swallowed you and it's throwing you around, not allowing you to come up for a breath. That's how Harry felt constantly.
"The um, Three Broomsticks has a policy of no Death Eaters," Draco chuckled cynically.
"What the hell are you doing?" Malfoy asked, not as offended as Harry thought he might have been.
"Oh, the Nimbus 2001," Harry said in a mocking tone. "Doesn't that belong in a museum."
"Do you want to leave?" Harry could barely hear Draco's voice over the noise but he got the grasp of his message and nodded. Draco held Harry's arms as he stood up, admittedly feeling a little better in Draco's presence.
Harry nodded. Letting his hand go limp in Draco's. The tingling feeling that shot up Harry's arm was extinguished before it reached his brain. The antidote may have cleared his system of the poison but the memory was real, and the wounds they reopened were real too.
"Only nine more hours of this," Hermione muttered to Ginny.
"Because as much as you and Mr Potter do not get along, the one thing you both have in common is a passion for Quidditch. I expect you to attend every training period, without question."
"Fine."
"You had a nightmare too?" Harry guessed.
"I think it's time for studying," Draco said as he broke the kiss, resting his forehead against Harry's. "Granger will have my head if I keep you too long."
"Yes, Potter," she said calmly, clearly expecting this reaction from him. "And I expect the both of you to be adults about it and get over your petty past."
"My parents didn't raise a pussy."
Harry was helping shovel snow from the Weasley's front garden when he spotted Pigwidgeon flying overhead toward Ron's bedroom window. The small owl, though not very smart, realised that Ron's window was sealed closed to ward off the cold and rerouted himself to the kitchen. Harry stuck his shovel in the snow and walked toward the tiny owl shivering in the cold. He pulled off his gloves and stuffed them into the pocket of the coat before carefully untying the ribbon from Pig's leg and letting him fly inside to warm up next to Errol, Hermes and George's new owl Athena.
"Perhaps I'll do the rest of the cutting, save the rest of your precious seeker's fingers," said Malfoy, chuckling as he continued cutting the Knotgrass before scooping it up into his hands
He realised at that moment that he had reached the end of his knowledge of what to do. He had never actually kissed someone with tongue, let alone a boy. He let himself become putty in Draco's hands, and his mouth. He attempted to mirror the Slytherin's movements but had absolutely no clue as to whether what he was doing was right.
"And what's the other option?"
"Am I just an accessory to you?" Harry laughed, running his fingers through Draco's blonde hair who couldn't help but smile softly as he felt the Gryffindor's fingers against his scalp.
Malfoy glanced at Harry with an expression that halted him in his anger.
He stood perfectly still as the doors opened again, it was, of course, Malfoy who stepped out, his blonde hair combed neatly to the side and his pristine robes hanging on his frame as if they were newly ironed.
As expected both Ron and Hermione jump back (with a small squeal on Ron's side) as the black leathery Thestrals came into view. Harry heard Hermione muttering under her breath about how fascinating they were but he chose to ignore her.
"Hey, you're not watching me shower, pervert!"
"That would be nice," Draco nodded. "But, there's a little problem."
"It's sensitive... he's sensitive," Harry said uncomfortably, drawing a small scribble in the margin of the parchment. "I doubt he'd be very civil if he found out I told you."
, now. But this is... you can understand why I'm not his biggest fan, right?"
"Exactly. This is so clearly Granger's work, not your own. You expect that mud-, uh, know-it-all to take your exams?"
"And I think Potter has seen the snitch with Park right on his tail! Remember, catching the snitch ends the game and grants the team of whichever seeker caught it one hundred and fifty points!" Parker Williams shouted into his megaphone.
Draco tore open the brown paper and two items fell onto the table. The first being a small paper box, presumably filled with chocolate just as the other packages were and the other made all their jaws drop.
"It would be a shame if you survived seventeen years of the most powerful dark wizard in history trying to kill you and you ended up dying of something dull like starving yourself," Draco laughed, touching the tips of his fingers to Harry's.
Hermione, Ginny, and Percy were already in the kitchen with Mrs Weasley when Harry and Ron arrived at the bottom of the stairs. Upon their appearance, Mrs Weasley ordered them to lay the table, pointing her wand toward a cupboard while asking Ginny to take the eggs off the flame.
"Wait," Ron frowned. "I thought, how?"
"Harry?" Hermione tapped her bowl nervously before looking behind her in the direction of the other tables. "Why don't you ask Malfoy to come sit with us during meals? He's just so alone over there and I'm sure McGonagall wouldn't mind, we are eighth years."
If the whole room wasn't looking at them before, they certainly were now. Draco shot a dirty glare at the eighth-year cohort before storming upstairs to retreat to his bed perhaps, hiding away behind his curtains.
The fire was still crackling, the house elves must not have come yet. Harry wondered what the time was, but he had not checked his alarm clock when he had woken and had left his watch on his bedside table. He pulled out his wand and made his way over the ornate grandfather clock.
"You don't know?" Draco scoffed, clearly unimpressed.
"Since when do you call him Draco?" He said quietly.
Once inside, Draco slammed the door and looked Harry dead in the eye. "Try."
James had reappeared, he had divested himself of his trunk, owl and trolly and was evidently bursting with news.
As Harry shook Madame Hooch's hand and looked out at all the eyes staring up at him, he smiled sadly as all the fond memories of this great castle ran through his mind. He would miss it. Everything.
The snitch changed directions and the two seeker's heads collided from the sudden movement.
"You're avoiding the topic," Draco said.
"Perhaps after spending the holidays with us he realised that not all Mudbloods are that bad," Hermione laughed.
"Oh, Harry, we must feed you up, dear, you're getting awfully thin," Mrs Weasley smothered him as he and Ron came down for breakfast a few hours later. Harry smiled weakly. He had lost the ability to care for himself barely a week after the war ended. Mrs Weasley had always given him big portions of all her meals but now even more so. Harry only felt a tiny pang of guilt as he sneakily dropped some under the table for Crookshanks to gobble up.
"You're probably going to regardless of my response," Malfoy sighed.
"Whatever you say," said Harry before craning his neck to plant a small kiss on Draco's lips. "What was the happy memory that finally did it."
Harry groaned and placed his head in his hands.
"You called me Harry," he said.
"He's not my-" Harry cut himself off, there was no use fighting it.
"How are you, Potter?" She asked. Harry shrugged.
"I'm good to go," he struggled with a smile as much as he could. He suddenly felt very underdressed standing across the table from Malfoy in his smart attire when Harry was wearing dirty sneakers, jeans, a t-shirt and a maroon jacket. Draco also seemed to notice his underwhelming outfit, looking him up and down, clearly unimpressed.
"I said I was sorry," Harry rolled his eyes.
Ron rolled his eyes and leant closer to Harry. "He still could have stood up for himself, spineless git."
His seeker's reflexes kicked in and he raced after the golden snitch, dodging passed Demelza and Dennis and under one of the Slytherin beaters.
Harry found himself deep inside the Forbidden Forest, wand missing. The moonlight trickled through the thick leaves over his head as he walked on an instinctual path through the trees.
"I'm just glad you didn't get any on the grass or I would've had you try the potion. Maybe you would've grown an extra brain, so you can concentrate on what you're doing." Harry swore that beneath that snark, Malfoy was actually smiling.
