"Woah, okay, mate," Ron said, holding up his hands defensively. "If he is the one you want, well..." he glanced at Hermione, seeking her help. “We won't hold you back, Harry," she smiled at her boyfriend and released Harry from her sticking charm, just as he made his way to get up.
Draco arched one of his elegant eyebrows and opened it, silver eyes flying over the content with growing excitement. Harry was brimming with anticipation until Zabini snatched the parchment, read over it, and reduced it to ashes with an
At his back, Draco shook his head to clear up his besotted mind. He still felt Potter’s unruly soft locks clinging to his fingers like a lover that just wouldn’t let him go. Potter’s scent had been truly intoxicating. A mix of honey-scented broom polish, chocolate, and cinnamon. Potter smelled like a fucking Christmas cookie and it did things to Draco’s stomach that had absolutely nothing to do with any known illness.
Ron had never liked Draco, given that the blond prat had been mostly beneath the waistline with his taunting. Yes, Draco was still a prat, but he was Harry's and he could only hope that Ron would get over it, given time.
Even though it broke his heart to see together, Harry couldn't help it. His eyes were constantly looking for Draco. So it came about that Harry found himself in a rather awkward position.
Salazar, it hurt to see Harry with someone else. Tears ran down his cheeks, taking away his sight. Half-blind, he stumbled back on the slippery path he had come from. The apology he wanted to give the gamekeeper was long forgotten, nothing was more important now than to get away from here.
"Hermione," Harry whined and looked at her pleadingly. "I can't do this right now. I just ... I fucked up, okay? But it would be my imminent death if you tell Ron now. Please, keep quiet about it. I will tell him eventually," Harry sighed out.
"Is that the reason you said those awful things about him? Because Ron has a fucking attitude with him?" she asked aghast and appalled at his stupidity.
He took off his invisibility cloak and did as he was told. He looked at her with tired eyes, holding a biscuit in his hand. "What did you want to tell me, Headmistress McGonagall," he asked in a broken voice. Most of the time when he was called into the Headmaster's office, bad news had been waiting for him. He couldn't take any more of it.
Harry was livid, his green eyes boring holes into Zabini's head and only Hermione's fast casting of a sticking charm held him in his place. He wanted to shout and rage but Ron had stuffed a tart in his already open mouth to shut him up, so that Hermione could reprimand him, to not make a scene in the Great Hall.
He must have uttered a horrified sound at the first words because suddenly fate took its terrible course.
Draco screamed Harry’s name as he was pushed over the edge and spilled his seed in long ribbons over the bed sheets. Harry's hot cum flooded his twitching channel as his boyfriend came with a growling howl.
He still wasn’t used to his new dorm room in the newly founded eighth-year tower which he shared with his best mate. The outlay was different, with beds, tables, and chairs coming in a double set and the huge windows on one wall. It wasn’t the first time he had forgotten to draw his bed curtains shut, but today of all days it irritated him to such lengths that he couldn’t fall back asleep.
Draco ran down the dark hallways of the dungeons. His thoughts were with Harry and the pain that he felt deep in his chest when he thought back to how the Weaslette had hugged his Gryffindor. It was almost the same as the pain he had felt when Hagrid came in carrying Harry's body, believed dead, into the schoolyard during the battle.
Pansy giggled in amusement, "Don't be ashamed, Ronnykins, Blaise is sexy, even you have to admit that and he likes both, even if redheads aren't one of them."
Ginny stared at the boy she had loved since childhood as if struck by lightning. "You're gay?" she croaked out, her voice taking on a higher pitch than normal.
Blaise smirked and raised both of his eyebrows, "Draco Malfoy offering an apology? And tomorrow it will rain Blast-Ended Skrewts."
"What?!” Ron exclaimed, his eyes going as wide as dinner plates. "B-but you’re straight! You dated my sister. You’re certainly just confused because you don’t get any...” Ron’s voice got louder and more panicked with every word he said.
He slowly walked down the path that was littered with wet leaves, carefully so that he did not slip or fall. His gaze drifted to the forbidden forest and a shudder ran down his spine as he remembered his time of being there with Harry in their first year. But that was in the past, like so many other things, and his mind strayed from the memory when he came closer to the hut.
Deciding on pinching and hoping for the best, he did just that with his eyes squeezed shut. Then he blinked. Nope, no dream then. The bloody scroll still was there and so were the letters on it. Letters which had burned an image into his mind, he wasn’t sure he could ever forget.
"What do you have there, Harry?" Hermione asked and snatched the parchment from his fingers before he could react. He tried to get it back, but Hermione being Hermione she was already halfway through the story no matter how fast he snatched it back.
Hermione rolled her eyes and then smiled evilly at him. Draco watched her warily. "What?” he asked and tried to snatch his hands away from her grip. The next words out of her mouth send a warm shiver down his back.
"That was close," she groused and glared at them, then puffed her chubby cheeks and huffed angrily, "Five points from Gryffindor and Slytherin, for carelessness."
"Can we do something to help in this situation?" he asked haggardly. "I don't know. Maybe we can try and talk to Malfoy. Explain to him-" she broke off while shaking her bushy head.
Harry was heading with Hermione and Ron to the library for one of Hermione's study sessions. He contemplated how he should begin to tell them that he was indeed gay. When he finally got his nerves to calm down a bit, they were standing near a mostly abandoned alcove on the third floor and he decided
Ron whimpered and Zabini explosively began to laugh. "Don’t worry Weasley, your ass is safe,” he reassured, making the ginger-haired Gryffindor choke, but ignored him otherwise. "So that’s what’s going on. Someone is writing stories about you two and now Weasley and me. Hell, I want to meet them. If they’re only half as hot as that story…,” he left the rest of the sentence to everyone’s imagination but the smirk on his lips told the whole story.
Draco visibly deflated but nodded at what the dark-skinned Slytherin said to him and all three of them glared at Harry over the house tables.
Harry gulped audibly as he felt Malfoy’s long fingers caress through his black locks and pressed against his scalp. Electric shocks ripped through his body as he looked up into startled silver eyes.
Hermione shot Ron an incredulous look. "Really, Ron?" she said annoyed and diverted her attention to Harry again.
"Fuck old friendships. I don’t need you!” Draco screamed and tried to buck up to get Blaise off him. "Don’t be so mean darling. It’s all done anyway,” Pansy cooed and placed a wet kiss on his cheek. "To a rekindled friendship,” Pansy grinned and Blaise finally stood up, pulling Draco with him. "Oh, that looks awesome, Pans. Do mine next. In dark green, I think.” He smirked and winked at the fuming blond as Pansy squealed in delight and hugged him.
"It's not a girl," he murmured, rubbing his hand over his face. Fuck! That was more difficult than he had thought.
He thought he had seen red hair wafting up in the wind and once he was up closer he found it confirmed when he saw the back of the Weaslette as she leaned against the bottom part of Hagrid's home.
"Huh?" made Ron surprised, allowing Blaise to snatch the paper from Pansy’s red-clawed fingers. He began reading but didn’t get far before his mouth fell open and he gaped at his friends in utter shock. The parchment glided to the middle of the table when it fell from the shivering hands of the dark-skinned Slytherin.
Grinning, Pansy smoothed out the paper and began reading, holding it so that Hermione could also take a look as she scooted closer.
When the door finally showed up, Harry grinned lovingly at Draco and pulled him by his hand inside a dimly lit room with light wooden walls. A fire blazed in the fireplace to their right, filling the room with warmth and making both boys relax. In the middle of the room was a big four-poster bed, clad in shiny silver duvet covers which had the Slytherin emblem embedded on it. Against the wall opposite the fireplace stood a small cabinet filled with small bottles and boxes. Harry smirked as he saw that this particular wish had been fulfilled by the room. He walked over the plush dark green carpet toward the bed and pulled Draco after him, who looked around in astonishment.
"Even then, Krum was a very… outgoing kind of bloke. By outgoing, I mean that he hit on anyone and everything that would let him. It worked on a few people here, most of them turned him down but found it quite funny. And those that didn't reject him, they had a good time with him. Among the latter was Granger."
Harry growled, pressed two rough fingers against Draco's lips, which effectively silenced him, and then concentrated on an unspoken spell with his eyes closed. A slick fluid appeared in his hand, which he instantly spread along his length. Had Draco not been so bloody hot to look at, he would have turned his husband on his stomach, teaching him at least
A little surprised and distracted, Harry just made a questioning sound until he realised that Draco was indeed this
Draco gasped falteringly and Harry struggled with himself not to grab his own crotch, feeling the hardness on his butt. Fuck, that was surreal and good. Not as scary as Harry had imagined, even though Ron and Hermione’s ten-minute theory suddenly sounded very plausible. Especially since Draco was just straightening up and drawing Harry closer to him again for a kiss.
He hastily looks around and leads Harry, who has nodded gratefully at him, on a direct path towards the high-security sector. Lucy, sitting at the reception as usual, frowns irritably at the sight of them, but when Jimar gives her a meaningful look, she willingly opens the airlock door for them.
Slowly, Draco crosses the shop and comes to a halt in front of the counter, behind which Harry is fighting for his composure. Before either of them even gets a chance to open their mouths, Pup lands elegantly next to the cash register and mews delightedly at Draco.
If anything, you have a saviour complex,” Draco interrupted Harry’s thoughts and smiled a little. He still seemed to be lost in thought, but also as if he could slowly understand many things better.
A "Not a minute more!" followed, then footsteps that walked away from the door and Harry exhaled with relief. Draco relaxed a little as well, but his gaze, still on Harry, remained dark and hungry. Harry smiled back guiltily and formed a "sorry" with his lips. Draco groaned annoyed and dropped his head on the pillow while Harry sat up on the bed.
“Wandless magic, Potter! That's my secret. Nothing more. Don't you dare tell anyone about anything else!”
Harry groaned, pressed his hand against his forehead and took a deep breath. These thoughts were too much for one head, in the end, it didn’t matter anyway. It was about him and Draco and nobody else. Maybe he could spice up the room a bit with things they both liked? But something not as big as a Quidditch pitch. Harry would’ve loved to play Quidditch with Draco, that would’ve certainly calmed him down.
Harry's heart thumps uncontrollably harder and he grips his wand tightly, careful not to do anything rash that would only scare Draco away. Instead, he exhales in a controlled manner, settles down at the edge of Draco's bed and cautiously holds out his hand to him. "Of course."
He still had a whole day of school to get around and would definitely be able to use this time to work on his inner Lion. Tonight he could hardly chicken out, he didn’t want to. After all, the prospect of a night with Draco was an intoxicating one and drove blood to certain regions just at the thought of it. If only the pressure wasn’t there and the quiet fear that something might go wrong.
"Will you sleep in my bed again?" Potter asked softly, close to Draco's ear. His throaty voice made Draco shudder. "And can I kiss you again before we sleep?"
Harry immediately moved closer to her and took a look at the page of the book she was studying. The first paragraph only summed up how a blood curse came about, but the second part actually dealt with how to break it.
A steep line forms between Malfoy's eyebrows and he presses his lips together. He is debating with himself, it shows. Harry can only wonder on behalf of whom he would accept his request. It is not for him, that much is certain.
Harry places his wand on the floor before him and watches intently as Malfoy's gaze is captivated by it. It is a misleading gesture, Harry is aware of that. He has no intention of handing Malfoy his old wand, but Malfoy seems smart enough to realise that as well because he faces Harry again. Perhaps it is because Malfoy does not yet have the authority to own a wand.
"Am I dead?" breathed Draco, allowing Harry to pull him first to his feet and then a few steps away.
“Um.” Draco blinked, rubbed his left eye. “I suppose it might have been helpful. Um, why didn’t you help Theo?”
Malfoy turned to look at him. When their eyes met Harry realized how close they were. “But those are the rules of the game, Potter.” Malfoy faked innocence, while the mirth in his eyes betrayed his diabolical intentions.
“He isn’t very fond of his, um, shape.” Draco continued, reminding himself that Potter had already shown himself sympathetic to Scorpius. He might even have some advice and he wouldn’t remember the conversation, anyway. “Sometimes he isn’t as careful of himself as he should be.”
The kitchen windows were charmed to show the view from the Gryffindor dormitories. The Great Lake sparkled in the distance. It was so small that when Harry stepped back to lean against the fridge, his and Hermione’s knees almost touched. “So this is where you’ve been then?” Harry reached out and kicked the toe of a trainer against one of Hermione’s Doc Martens. “Just hiding out at Snape’s, making a sandwich?”
Draco was starting to feel sorry for Harry. Time and again the Slytherin’s had blocked his attempts and meanwhile, it looked as if Harry had given up, although Draco could still see him looking over at him, he no longer came as close. Still, Draco had the feeling that Harry was always around. He knew about his invisibility cloak, they had used it often to meet secretly. But he saw no reason why Harry would need to start using it again now since Draco was out and about with Blaise as often as possible. It was a strange feeling and Draco was afraid he wasn't quite right in his head. The stress of breaking up with his boyfriend and then fake dating his best friend was taking a toll on his mind.
While Harry inquisitioned Draco, she unrolled it and began reading. It didn’t take long for her to squeal in delight, drawing everyone’s attention to her.
Harry rolled his eyes at him. "I hate giving speeches. That is one of the most terrible things right after people staring at me all the time."
"You like when I watch you," Harry stated hoarsely as his hands followed the path he had kissed down, up again, and came to a rest at Draco's nipples. "Yes," Draco hissed through clenched teeth as he felt a blush creeping over his whole body. Salazar, this was not their first time, but Harry showed Draco the same loving tenderness as then. His heart soared with love and he would admit to anything, if only it would make Harry go on faster.
? And yes, I know we haven’t really talked about how exactly you feel about him, but it’s pretty obvious. After all, you asked him out.”
There are plenty of reasons for the apology, or justification, whatever it may be. The most important one, however, is obvious. "So you can trust me again. So you can trust the world again."
Draco groaned impatiently, kissed Harry once more, bit his lower lip as if he could punish him like that. "You
little about Potter. It usually bothered him in a different way. Knowledge was power, his father had taught him that at an early age and Draco had stuck to it all his life. But in Potter's case, it wasn't about power. All he wanted was to do something about his obvious suffering.
–" Harry made a face like he was going to throw up. Ron went to smack him, Harry could only just save himself. In response, Ron muttered something about disrespect. Harry just laughed as quietly as he could, then he fled into the bathroom.
Draco looked at Harry briefly, then he ran his fingers distractedly through his hair. One of his legs began trembling while he seriously began to chew on his fingernails. Inwardly, Harry yelled. Draco’s nervousness already revealed that he shouldn’t push him further into the corner, but what else could Harry have done? Let Draco run to his doom? Certainly not.
Jimar shrugs, his eyes set on Malfoy. "Something to do with his curse, I suppose. But that's not my area of expertise, so I can't exactly explain it to you. My remit has since changed from 'control' to 'supervise'." He grins in amusement, then clears his throat. "I'll leave you guys alone for a moment."
When Harry glances at him, he is busy placing Harry's wand back down on the tabletop. Since he started casting small spells with it, Harry occasionally let him have the wand. Most of the time Draco just likes to hold it in his hand, other times he causes little sparks to spurt from the tip, much to Pup's amusement.
Draco looked frighteningly normal as if Harry had only imagined last night, except that the blond man kept grabbing his right forearm, proving that there was a slight change after all. Harry wondered whether he should talk to Draco about it – not about the fishtail, that was perhaps a bit too blatant – but about his welfare.
"Honestly, I'm just adapting to my surroundings," Harry grinned smugly. His stomach felt as if dozens of centipedes were running a marathon in it, it was truly beautiful.
Harry considered talking about something on the way. Perhaps Draco’s wound, the magic that Draco possessed even without his wand when Draco had noticed that he preferred men, or how he generally felt about black-haired Gryffindors. But he held back. Curiosity or not, Harry should be glad enough that Draco had agreed at all to this date. After all, he took a much greater risk than the Saviour of the Wizarding World.
Leaning his forehead against Draco's, their wands united in their hands, Harry closed his eyes and concentrated on freeing his mind while Draco quietly began to speak the incantation.
Once home, Harry does the chores he does not want to postpone until the weekend. He opens the mail, writes letters, pays bills, cleans the rooms of his flat, feeds Pup and finally cooks his evening meal, which he then enjoys at the small table in the kitchen in front of the spacious window. After eight o'clock, depending on his mood, he either watches the entertainment programmes on British television or listens for a while to the music he has chosen for the day.
Harry sighed, dropped his fork and looked back at the blond Slytherin. Had Draco noticed that there had been a Sleeping Draught in the tea and was that why he was behaving strangely? Or was it because of Hermione and Ron? If he remembered correctly, Draco had never been seen in his mer-creature form by anyone apart from his parents, certain healers and Harry. Perhaps the reaction overwhelmed him, it
Malfoy scoffed quietly. "Well spotted, Potter. Now then, have the courtesy to explain to me why you're bothering with non-existent beings when surely the real world needs all your salvation and therefore time."
"No," Draco interrupted him, he closed his eyes in agony, then he sighed. "If I tell you what happened, can you promise not to look at me differently? That you’ll continue to look at me as if I’m –" Draco faltered. Harry could only guess how he looked at Draco. But he was pretty sure that "idolisingly" came close to reality.
Somewhere a thunder growled, causing the earth to tremble and Harry with it. Draco braced his hands against Harry's chest, made him get up and, as soon as he sat up, began to strip off his clothes. Harry looked at him with big eyes, his trousers becoming hopelessly tighter and tighter. Draco's fingers nimbly moved under the hem of his shirt and skillfully unbuckled his belt. His cheeks and ears flushed, saliva moistened his lips and in his gaze lay pure impatience.
Harry didn't need to see Draco to know he was grinning derisively. “Apart from the fact that you shouldn't flatter yourself about it, I'm convinced that you won't return the flirtations… or can’t.”
“I must confess, even I wouldn't have thought that you were that stupid!” A cool voice broke the peaceful silence and made the waterspirit disappear within a few seconds into the depth of the lake. Harry looked disappointedly at the retreating dark silhouette for a moment, then slowly turned only to see Draco casually strolling towards him. Draco was probably the only person who still looked elegant while strolling.
Blaise kept quiet and Harry found the note. He pulled out his mobile phone and typed the number combination. The phone service here was terrible and now he was finally able to write Sirius again. He really needed that. When jam jars didn't work, Sirius was always the best person to contact.
“Let it go. If you really think something's up, ask him. I will not bear to witness your obsessive pursuit of Malfoy again!" Hermione's tone betrayed that her reprimanding was futile, so Harry decided to ask Draco about his behaviour. On that occasion, he could also ask him directly why he was sneaking out of his dormitory at night. Yes, that was a
While Blaise continued his breakfast with another sigh, Ron next to him only grew paler. "And I thought
For a few seconds, Draco seems tempted to break away. His lower lip trembles dangerously and his breathing is brisk, but Harry refuses to look away. He holds the cool hand firmly in his and pours all the sincerity he can muster into his gaze. Until the tension drains from Draco's limbs and he takes a deep breath.
Harry closed his eyes, put his head back and breathed out relaxed. The cool water pelted down on him and gave his body the cooling and relaxation it really needed after two long riding lessons. They had fallen asleep far too late and got up far too early to be back at Weeping Willow Farmstead in time for breakfast, so primarily Harry was just tired. He let his hands run through his wet hair and carefully worked the knots out of his strands. He liked to take time for himself while showering, not much had this relaxing effect on him.
Potter, unfortunately, didn't feel so casual anymore when he faced the blond man and nervously asked him for a private conversation. On top of the fact that Draco was flanked by his friends, he looked particularly condescending today.
At first, only fragments had been missing, but eventually Draco hadn't even seen them anymore. Even when Narzissa took Draco's hand, the gesture was tormented, as if she was not his mother, but a distant relative he met for the first time in his life.
"Ron can hang out with us! As long as he doesn't try to convince us to play a game of chess," Dean offered from the other picnic blanket.
Confused, Harry opened his mouth to say something, but he couldn’t think of a suitable answer. His mind once again spoke out, feeling confirmed in its theory that Draco didn’t find him to be attractive enough, because he fought tooth and nail with his desire to surrender himself to Harry. Understandably so, his mind just had to add. Meanwhile, Harry’s heart began to struggle with beating at an ordinary rhythm, as if it were preparing to be ripped out of Harry’s chest.
Harry almost didn't let go, he was too relieved. Draco's upper body fitted to his own like a puzzle piece, he could
Ron completed his training as an Auror and even practised the profession for three years. But at some point, the demons of the war caught up with him too and now he works in the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects, which is still under the leadership of Arthur Weasley. He seems happy with it; at least Hermione sees no reason to reproach him about the way he is conducting his life. She prefers to save that for Harry.
"Don't tell him I'm the one who enters the book," Harry replies eventually and looks at the Healer, feeling fatigued. He feels like he ran a marathon. It’s probably the many, new experiences that are taking their effect on him. "We don't share a particularly pleasant past."
And Harry had never given it much thought, it was like it never happened. But Draco had a past, and even if he hadn't already had a bad experience with a bet about his body, it was still degrading. Harry felt sick at the thought that Draco could even assume that Harry had staged all those moments between them just for a cheap bet, nothing more than a ridiculous competition.
Draco seemed to really get into this, as he was just about to tamper with Harry’s jeans button at a pace that made it impossible for Harry to protest. But when he felt the long fingers slipping into his boxers he reacted quite hectically and unexpectedly, bumping his knee against the underside of the tabletop in front of them by accident, drawing all attention to himself. Fortunately, Draco was just as quick and his hand was back on the tabletop as if nothing had ever happened, while Prof. Flitwick looked at them suspiciously.
It shouldn't have turned Harry on the way it did. But Draco's fingers, running through the blond, carefully pulling each strand in one direction and taming it, blew synapses in Harry's brain that he didn't even know existed. He would have loved to reach into the hair himself, hold it and have a little too much power over Draco.
"It's no big deal! Most of us don't take the competition seriously anyway!" Ginny sounded as if she couldn't understand why Ron and Harry looked so abashed.
“He's always looked normal, and I don't feel this is all that new to him. Hermione, have you ever heard of such a case?” Harry asked her, but kept looking at Draco, who poked listlessly at his scrambled eggs, then suddenly dropped his fork and held his right forearm, with a distorted, painful expression.
Bright colours twirl before his closed eyes, Harry wants to reach for them, catch them and laugh as he races with them. But not a muscle in his body moves. The colours fade away, regardless of how hard Harry clings to keep them alive. Crushing darkness takes hold of him and obscures any sense he may have had.
Harry didn't have to be asked twice, followed the request instantly, removed the piece of cloth, propped himself backwards on his elbows and watched as Draco reached for the pillows, pulled out his wand and then turned back to Harry. He gave him a nervous but gentle smile that made the pit of Harry's stomach boil. Then he positioned himself close to him, but on his stomach, whispered an unknown spell and from the tip of the wand a slippery liquid spilt out, which Draco caught with his fingers. He raised his head and gave Harry a hesitant look.
I rolled my eyes at the comment, which evidently amused Draco even more, and emphatically extended my hand further in Draco's direction. Fortunately, he did not feel the need to resist any longer and made a move to take my hand. There was that invisible wall again, which he was unable to overcome, so I unceremoniously took the last step and grabbed his hand.
I felt vindicated as my gaze slid over the other filled picture frames. One showed Malfoy's mother placing a kiss on her grown son's forehead, taking his hands in hers and whispering soft words in a language I did not speak. Bright, bluish light illuminated the room, waltzed around their bodies and centred again on a tiny spot where their hands touched. The light vanished and the memory began to replay all over again.
It was already evening. Harry lay stretched out on his bed, nibbling on an apple and studying the Marauder’s Map, as he did every evening these days. Meanwhile, Ron paced up and down near his bed, put on his pyjamas, collected the school supplies for the next morning and cursed quietly.
"Um, that's right. It's about Malfoy," Harry explains, hoping he has interpreted the question correctly. "Mr Malfoy," he corrects at Robards' calculating expression.
It took a few seconds before he realised that it was really Draco standing there in front of him. He looked like
Something stirred beside me and I flinched. My gaze had been so transfixed on the little boy, who had just been welcomed by Madam Malkins, that I had not paid any further attention to my surroundings. Directly behind a clothes rack displaying a colourful selection of cloaks, a small blond boy stood on a stool and instructed the witch pinning his black cloak to leave it a little longer as he would grow quickly. The witch gave him an annoyed look but complied with his request.
Harry’s jaw dropped open. Who the hell went in the broom cupboard for snogging? Wasn't that a little uncultured? However, he certainly knew at least five couples who behaved in an uncultured manner even without a broom cupboard; a closed room would be very appropriate for them! This would please the sensitive retina of the pupils of everyone else and protect the younger ones from premature enlightenment.
Harry snorted and tried to cover it up with a hasty cough. Draco was still arrogant, but maybe he didn't need to know that now.
He loved his godfather truly, but this was no time for small talk. He tapped the display again to put the phone in silent mode, then threw it surprisingly unerringly onto his bed. It bounced once but stayed on his pillow. Harry smiled satisfied and then turned his attention back to Draco.
A joke? Seriously? Do you know how degrading that is?" Ginny interrupted him, she gestured wildly with her hands in the air. "And you, Harry! I can't believe you agreed to this! You –"
One question was on the tip of his tongue, even if he felt terribly silly to even think about it. “And… erm, do you like bitter?” Merlin, how could one sound so
, motions for Harry to sit down across from him at his desk and tells him about holiday traditions of the various ghosts – or about a fight with his fiancée? Harry pays no attention to a single word.
The following day Nellie pays Draco another visit and assures Harry that for now, everything is fine. It is not a state that will last in the long term, but it is a ray of light in the darkness. It offers Harry hope that he can still make a difference.
As so often, Harry was reminded of why he loved Draco so idolatrously and decided against a verbal answer. Instead, he grabbed Draco by the thighs, at the junction of leg and arse, pulled Draco's body closer and spread the soft cheeks with his thumbs. Harry closed his eyes, licking along the crack to Draco's testicles, but then concentrated on the wrinkled skin at his hole. Draco moaned, under his fingers, Harry could feel Draco tensing his leg muscles and shifting his weight slightly.
“Maybe we should begin by thinking about what we really want. Not what some curse wants or your parents or our friends want, but just us. So we can play with an open hand and start over.” Harry knew he was right about what he said. They had never had enough time to think about themselves or their future. There had hardly been time to think about these new feelings and now they had the time, as well as the opportunity. Not to use it would perhaps be a mighty mistake.
Draco, however, crossed his arms in front of his chest, smiling. “Took you long enough to realise that,” he remarked. Did Draco sound sulky? Maybe a teeny tiny bit.
"I've been thinking about a gift for you," Draco said in a more or less steady voice. Harry raised his eyebrows questioningly and Draco kept talking. "It wasn’t easy. Parkinson, I'd treat with a shopping trip to the Parisian designer shops, but you..." Draco held his breath as Harry began to place light kisses on the inside of his thigh.
The Malfoy estate wasn’t far from Weeping Willow Farmstead, a quarter of an hour's scooter ride that Harry enjoyed with every second. The estate was gigantic, perverse if Harry was honest. Most of it was the garden, more likely a park, which stretched out in front of a majestic neo-Romanesque manor. Harry had suspected that Draco's family had money, but he had never guessed that they had
For the rest of breakfast, it was Harry who avoided Draco's looks. He could literally feel the burning hatred directed at him and was convinced that Draco was already planning his murder. He could only hope that none of the half-blood Slytherins knew exactly who Ariel was, but he dared to doubt that this would be of any use. Seamus had already said more than enough.
"You can't cure the curse without knowing what it is, can you?" Mr Potter asks. He no longer seems upset, just contemplative.
" Draco gasped, interrupting the kiss as if this had torn him out of his trance. "Forty-two and twenty-seven equals what?"
They are patient with him. It is not the first time they have seen Harry in a depressive period and they grant him time. They also do not mention the lack of stories about the Friday visits to St Mungo's. Harry has never talked much about it, he has never known how. But his sudden complete silence on the subject is noticeable even to Ron and Hermione. So it is not unusual for Ron to pick him up from work on Fridays for a drink at the
Breaking away, Harry pulled his own shirt off as well, but before Draco’s fingers could explore the new playing field, Harry pushed him back onto the mattress and continued his kisses southwards. His own southern region cheered with delight as it was pressed against Draco’s as if by chance and gave Harry the feeling of having to defend himself against a gasp.
Malfoy dangled his legs from the root and almost curiously peered down at Parkinson. "Is it true then? Have you actually tried to kiss Millie?"
"Oh, Harry," Hermione mumbles in amusement as she nestles her head against Harry's shoulder. On Harry's other side, Ron puts his arm around him to pet his wife's hair. "Ron and I are having a baby."
"I don't want you to think of me as my past. I know I did those things, but I don't want you to think I'm still capable of them." Draco sounded genuinely concerned but also filled with regret. Harry frowned, knowing Draco now, it was something that caused him more trouble than it should. He couldn't imagine seeing Draco in any other light.
Draco raises an eyebrow and tucks his feet underneath his legs on the couch. "How am I looking at you?"
Their laughter slowly faded away, first turning into giggles and then being replaced by the chirping of crickets and the humming of bees. Harry turned his head towards Draco, who was already looking at him. The storm-grey eyes studied him without judgement, only gentleness could be read in them. There was a soft smile on his lips and a light blush was covering his cheeks.
But then I remembered  Healer Isaksen’s stern voice, reprimanding me that she was only giving me this second chance because she was actually interested in her patient's recovery. She had given me a piercing look and ingrained into me to not even think of trying to fathom anything in the blank pages of the book other than the remedy for Draco's rescue. I knew she was alluding not only to my personal feud, but equally to my agreement with the Aurors, of which she knew nothing officially, but picked up on it like a trained sniffer dog.
"You didn't want us to have to hurry," Harry remembered, his voice sounded dark with desire, his breath went fast and his mind was still on autopilot.
Accompanied by the distant sounds of bursting fireworks, Malfoy's legs fall open. Grey eyes fall shut, Malfoy tilts his head back, lips open in a silent moan.
Harry's tactics to face the whole situation with confidence worked and Draco stumbled after Harry by surprise until he pushed him into an empty classroom and finally let go. Draco rubbed his wrist and looked at Harry angrily.
"Potter", Draco whispered in a throaty, still sleepy voice, arched his back so that he could press his bottom closer to Harry's crotch. "You haven't fed the horses yet, have you?"
Only pausing for a few tiny moments, he peers up at Draco until he answers his unspoken question with an exasperated nod.
Harry wasn't. He felt like a toddler having his first taste of a sugar rush. It was intoxicating, and he wanted to experience it again and again. Equating Draco with a drug was certainly not quite right, but the blond had the potential to become his addiction and Harry couldn’t help but notice that he was prone.
Harry does not know whether this should relieve him – for Malfoy's sake – or otherwise concern him. On the one hand, he is convinced that the Aurors know what they are doing when they allow Mrs Malfoy to remain at liberty; on the other hand, he is unable to fathom the reason why Malfoy has to serve five years in Azkaban and his mother none.
Harry strained his ears and waited eagerly to see if Draco would actually follow the invitation. He wasn’t disappointed, the bathroom door flew open five seconds later and Draco strutted into the rather small bathroom dressed in full riding gear. The blond immediately began to take off his clothes, but not without taking a long look at Harry. His gaze lingered a little
The door opened without any problems and fortunately did not make any creaking sound. Curious, Harry looked around while he closed the door again. The bathroom was as gigantic as he remembered. The huge bathtub, which was more reminiscent of a swimming pool, took up most of the room. On one side there were some toilets, but Harry was not interested in that. He curiously stepped closer to the pool, not too close, but close enough to get a good look at it. The bath had already been filled with water, but it wasn't colourful and full of soap bubbles like Harry's had been back then. The water stayed transparent and the foam was missing as well.
Harry nods and watches Draco reach out a hand to stroke Pup, who is perched on the back of the couch, with his fingertips. "Yeah. We usually hang out every three weeks and get to do a bunch of exciting things. I think he misses that."
Oh, right! The activity was meant to be a surprise, Harry remembered that much. Draco would certainly push him to his limits again, so they would earn enough stupid horseshoe points to keep them at the top of the scoring. Speaking of Draco...
"He's a good boy," Lupin said with a little smile on his lips and began to stow the instruments he had used on Feykir into a bag. "He wasn't always, if I may say so. It took him a lot of time and trouble to question his values and morals. I think someone with strong inner morals would be good for him." Lupin looked at Harry briefly as if he wondered if Harry could be that someone. "Ah, and he was always terrified of big dogs."
Harry had spent the morning with Sirius and had introduced him to his friends. Ginny obviously knew Sirius already, he embosomed Luna immediately, and the others welcomed him happily into their midst. Harry had only just joined Draco, Mr Lupin had finished his examination of Feykir and prescribed him a few days' rest. He assured Draco that the lameness would go away after enough time off. And now he greeted Hedwig, who sniffed the back of his hand with a wag.
Moving his hands through the masses as if he was dry-swimming, he pushed everything behind his seat and rescued his goblet from tumbling over.
The blonde Slytherin had an increasingly beguiling effect on Harry's emotional life and he wasn't exactly sure what to think of it.
Harry chuckled, as he pulled Draco's entrance wider apart, and began fucking his boyfriend with his tongue. He could only guess what he was doing to Draco with it, but the Slytherin's reactions spoke for themselves. He had never had Draco as willing and so close to begging as he was now, it did terribly wonderful things to his own hard cock.
Harry swallowed hard when he saw Ginny's hopeful smile. "Erm, Ginny ..." he pulled away from her touch and looked at her apologetically. "I'm sorry, Gin, I don't like you that way and I'm already in love with someone." Harry couldn't look into her eyes and fixed his gaze on Hagrid's back entrance.
"I know that you helped a bunch of third years last week with their potions homework. They wouldn’t let you at first but you tried anyway even if it was a bit-" she chuckled, "like the old you, with your snarky comments on their intelligence when they wrote down the wrong ingredients for a calming draught. You told them in a roundabout way what they did wrong and even if they wouldn’t immediately write it down, I saw them second-guessing themselves and looking up what you told them, and then correcting their answers. Professor Slughorn was well pleased or so I heard after their lesson the next day. What you did reminded me of Professor Snape and I was impressed to see you in that manner and them glancing at you with admiration.” She sighed heavily, "I’m still working on it, so don’t expect wonders from me. But I like the conversations we have and I guess it’s fine to let go of the past animosity we shared.”
When Draco entered the Slytherin common room the next morning he found Pansy and Blaise already sitting in the elegant, dark green upholstered armchairs, which are located in front of the fireplace. It burned all year round to chase away the cold that lingered down in the dungeons.
But then Ron sighed in surrender, "Well, I guess I'll have to get used to it then." He looked pungently at Harry. "As long as you don't fancy Malfoy or anything like that," he scowled.
When after a while no answer came, he carefully ventured forward and sat on the edge of Harry's bed. "Alright, mate?" he asked when Harry squirmed on the bed and groaned again.
He muttered out a listening charm, so he could overhear what they were talking about. Draco’s hushed voice sounded upset as he talked urgently to his dark-skinned friend, "
"You've liked him since the first year of school? And You never said a thing," Ron said, huffing. He was offended. "Don't you trust me, mate?"
Ron hung back between some bookshelves in the library and watched the drama unfold before his bright-blue eyes.
It had been on the tip of Hermione’s tongue that she knew what Pansy was talking about but decided to only shake her head at her new friend's antics. She never would fully understand how a Slytherin’s mind worked but it was a fascinating thing to see.
Ron deflated and puffed out a sigh of relief that he wasn't losing his friend to the git. Hermione rolled her eyes at the ginger-haired boy. "So, you've been meeting up with your crush then? I've noticed that you have been sneaking around and thought that maybe you were stalking Draco Malfoy again as you did in the sixth year," she said. "Hermione, why'd you have to bring that up?" Ron sighed at his girlfriend.
"As if. I hate being famous, now even more than before," Harry answered and bit his lower lip. He really needed to stop looking at Draco or he would certainly do something stupid, like pulling one of the loosely hanging sweaty, slightly wavy, strands of blond hair behind Draco's ear. His fingers itched to just do it, to get a feel of the soft-looking silvery strands. But he pried his attention back to the pot to fill in the earth.
"Yes, I know," Harry murmured as he crawled over Draco's sprawled out body and straddled his hips. His hands cupped Draco's face and he swept one of his thumps over the plum pink bottom lip. "Merlin, I missed you so much, you have no idea," he whispered as he locked his green eyes with Draco's silvery gaze. Slowly he leaned the last few inches and softly touched their lips together.
In the little box in front of him, embedded in dark green velvet, lay a very fine, noble ring. Two snakes, one made of silver and the other made of rose gold, were intertwined and bit each other's tail. The ring was detailed down to the smallest scale and the eyes of the two snakes were completed with small silver and green gemstones, reminding him of their own eyes.
Weasley was miserable, to a fault. Either he turned red like a tomato, which stung wonderfully with his orange hair, or he sat there scowling and mumbling curses to himself.
, he thought. But the damage was done. Not only because Harry had marked him as his own, but also because of Draco's own thoughtless reaction.
Harry nodded solemnly and watched Blaise go before turning to Draco. "You know that I didn’t mean any of what I said to Ron. You don’t know how much I regretted it the moment it fell out of my mouth. It’s been driving me insane, Draco. I’m so sorry for hurting you in that way and I swear I will never deny you again. We belong together and if you take me back, I’ll make sure everyone knows it."
"Harry! Look! Pansy did another beautiful artwork,” she exclaimed and looked smiling at the raven-haired boy who had appeared behind Draco.
Hands clutching tightly together, Harry and Draco walked the corridors of Hogwarts under his invisibility cloak. They hide in alcoves and the shadows of the Armor’s on display, giggling and kissing while dodging the patrolling teachers. When they finally reached the seventh floor, Harry walked forth and back three times with eyes closed in front of the blank wall. He concentrated on the things he wanted in the room and completely ignored the slight snoring of Barnabas the Barmy who slept comfortably in his portrayal.
The next morning was a blur for Harry. His eyes were reddened and swollen from the day before. The little bit of food he was able to choke down, with great difficulty at Hermione's insistence, tasted like ashes and the many curious glances of his classmates stung his back like hornets. Actually, in all honesty, he hadn't wanted to come to the Great Hall at all, but after much good talk from his best friends, he had brought himself to come down for breakfast.
Draco's body only shuddered. He was beyond words for the feelings Harry gave him were just too much for his brain to comprehend. He just pushed his hips back as a request for Harry to finally fuck him.
He had sneaked after Draco and Zabini again after dinner. The two had descended to the dungeons together, their elbows in constant contact. Harry was seething with jealousy. Why did this pompous pretty-boy Zabini have to keep touching Draco?
Harry groaned and trickled the content of the vial over Draco's ass and his swollen cock. He tugged fast two times at his own cock before he spread Draco's buttocks once again and pushed the tip inside. They both moaned as they finally connected in the most intimate way possible. Sweat pooled in the small of Draco's back where he was bent at just the right angle for Harry's cock to hit his sweet-spot when the Gryffindor snapped his hips forward and sunk completely in.
"Oh, don’t worry, I recognize that owl by now," Harry said, pointing to the bloody bird who sat on one of the wooden beams, grooming its feathers.
"Well, that was interesting,” Hermione commented with an amused tone to her voice. Her eyes twinkled with mischief as Harry shot her an exasperated look.
Harry couldn't take it any longer. Abruptly he jumped up, mumbled an apology to his friends, and fled to the nearest toilet. If he was going to break down, he didn't want to do it in front of all of his classmates.
I warmly greet all readers and come to you today with the hottest news, fresh out of Hogwarts. It happened in the Great Hall of our lovely school; on no better day than Valentine's Day, we witnessed how Harry Potter, the hero of the wizarding world and defeater of Voldemort, finally proposed marriage to his long time lover Draco Lucius Malfoy.
Potter looked worried back, stretching a hand out to his and the sodding parchment. All of a sudden Draco squeaked and shot out of his seat, breakfast forgotten and rushed out of the hall on a limp. Embarrassment burned his whole body up and let him glow like a fucking inferno. He needed to get as far away from Potter as possible. His heart hammered in his chest as if it tried to find a way out of it and his stomach felt as ill as if an angry hornets’ nest was dropped in there.
"Is looking like a vampire the new style?" a deep voice asked from the bathroom door and Draco shot his former friend an angry look. "What is it to you, Blaise? I thought you didn’t want anything to do with me anymore." Draco crossed his arms over his Pyjama clad chest and leaned with his hips against the sink.
They pulled back for much-needed air when Zabini let out a low chuckle. Harry eyed the dark-skinned Slytherin suspiciously until Draco suddenly thwacked Harry painfully over the head. "What the fuck, Potter?" he growled, grey eyes blazing in the moonlight that shone around them.
Draco looked up and quirked one of his elegant eyebrows. "Are you done with the Herbology essay for Professor Sprout?” he asked going back to his own Transfiguration homework.
Nodding was all Draco did as new tears tracked down his cheeks. Pansy's mind supplied her with malicious scenarios, where Potter's body was never found, at the sight of the fresh tears on her friend's face. Potter would pay for this; she would make sure of that.
The one time he caught Draco unaware and without company, the Slytherin had slid-on his cold mask of indifference and told him in an icy tone, that he no longer wanted anything to do with him.
"Hermione?” He said warily as he got closer to his girlfriend. She looked up and the last remains of her smile vanished. "Ronald,” she acknowledged him, drawing her eyebrows together in a scowl.
To Harry it felt like an eternity, standing there like this and yet not long enough when Malfoy cleared his throat and stepped back from him. He instantly missed those long, lean fingers in his hair and involuntarily did a step forward as if his body was begging to be touched again.
"Why, Potter? My pronunciation is not stilted, but aristocratic. It would do you good to learn with all the speeches you have to give."
Draco enjoyed the warmth of his lover's hug a little longer before gently pulling back from Harry's arms. "Harry, we need to talk," he said in a serious tone. He had to do this now before he backed down. Harry winced, "You don't want to break up with me, do you?" he asked fearfully, his green eyes wavering slightly with the start of tears.
Pansy had the most fun with it all. She took to dropping ambiguous innuendos or groaning suggestively when Weasley was near them. She couldn't wait to get her hands on the second part of the story.
Harry had even started stalking the blonde again, much as he did during their sixth year. His invisibility cloak was now stored permanently in the inner pocket of his school robes so that he had it always on hand. It made his heart heavy by what he saw. Draco seemed to get on very well with Zabini. The two laughed a lot together and the dark-skinned Slytherin usually put his arm around Draco as he whispered something in his ear. Draco seemed to be finished with Harry and was facing a new future in which Harry had no place anymore.
"I'm sorry to hear that, Harry. But as you know, this is no reason to neglect your education and health. I hope the dispute between the two of you will settle soon and I expect you to turn your attention back to your lessons until it's resolved," she said not unkindly and pointed to the cookies. "Take another biscuit."
Pulling back his mouth, he watched how Draco's hole twitched at the loss. "You really like that, don’t you?" Harry asked with hooded eyes, already searching for the second vial.
I don't want to push them, or lose them." He looked at Draco nervously, "Uhm, would it be okay for you if we take it slow? I would feel my way around and tell them first that I'm gay and then see how they react before I tell them about you. Would that be possible for you?" Harry looked at him pleadingly with his big green eyes and Draco gave in. He couldn't refuse Harry anything when he looked at him like that.
Harry had given the letter to Draco's owl which delivered it at breakfast on the ninth day after their break-up.
. Ron wasn't good at sneaking up and being invisible, that was always more like Harry's job. But he didn’t get good vibes from this group, so he had sat it on his list of potential dangers.
Hermione sat across from him, Ron sat to her right side, and Pansy on her left. Blaise had snatched a seat at the head of the table after he unceremoniously pushed Malfoy onto the chair next to Harry.
"No, it’s… well, I accept your apology but…” Harry paused and now his whole face was glowing red. "In the end, it might come to that,” he whispered and wouldn’t meet Ron’s eyes.
When Blaise walked into the room, Pansy waved to him to come over. Draco had fallen into a light slumber, completely exhausted after his emotional turmoil. She quietly explained to Blaise what had occurred and it was evident on his dark face that Potter should watch his back. They both nodded to each other, no further words needed as Draco jerked awake.
Baffled, Draco looked up from his packing and didn’t know how to react. He couldn’t fathom why she was so trusting towards him after he had called her
"Well ... always?" Harry cringed. He knew that being gay wasn't a decision you made. It just was like that. And even if he had shown interest in girls before, it was just curiosity. Everyone did that, didn't they? Through trial and error, he had found out he just liked blokes better, one bloke in particular though.
"What are you doing? Unhand me, Potter," Draco hissed with his usual scowl, ignoring the fact that he himself had willingly taken Harry's hand. He felt his cheeks heating up in embarrassment. Half the room was staring at them now and Draco didn't know what to do or what Harry was planning.
"Hey Draco," Pansy greeted and a curious gleam entered her eyes. "So, where have you been sneaking off to lately? Blaise told me you weren't in your room at all last night. Did you find someone to your liking?" Pansy smirked knowingly.
"FUN?” Ron suddenly bellowed and sprung up from his chair, making it fall over. "Have you gone around the bend, Harry?” His cheeks colored again and his breath was coming in rushes as he tried to not hyperventilate.
He closed his gaping mouth with a click and the crease between his eyebrows intensified as he saw her smile falter.
Draco’s frantic heartbeat had calmed down while he read. The story was so cheesy but on the other hand so lovingly soft that a small smile had crept upon his lips. This was nothing like the other story and he was utterly glad about that. Whoever had written it must have been a girl for it was the perfect date for a delicate damsel. For Draco, it was too much, too perfect and he wouldn't be caught dead in Madam Puddifoot's.
The two had been a couple for almost two long years now and still, nobody even knew about them. At the time they had started dating, the war was still going on. So they had decided to keep it a secret. Harry had been afraid of losing his friends and the only family figures he had left. He also wanted to keep Draco safe from his father. Who knew what would’ve happened if Lucius Malfoy found out that his only son was bent, and also dating the enemy.
His mind set was an icy cold rage, as he got up from his seat by the window. He stalked over to the Golden Trio, just as Granger came back with Potter from their little side talk he hadn't managed to hear.
Harry glanced at his slowly waking friend, feeling the red hot burn of embarrassment creeping over his cheeks. He hoped with all his heart that this was a one time joke to never be repeated. He couldn’t even imagine how Ron would react if he were the one to read something like that.
Hermione's eyes grew wide, then she snorted, "So, that's where you have been sneaking off to lately. I should have known." She sighed, "I only hope that he won’t hear about those things you said about him. There would be hell to pay if he ever finds out you dissed him, especially in front of us, just because Ron's behaviour got to you. I know you don't want to lose Ron because of this. But Harry, if Ron ditches you because you simply fell in love with Draco Malfoy, he isn't a good friend and you know this already, he wouldn't do that. Surely, he will be pissed off, but eventually, he will come around. You're like a brother to him." She looked at him worriedly. "I hope this all works out for you Harry. You deserve to be happy," she said while smiling at him softly.
He moaned wantonly around his tongue, making the blond's testicles twitch as the vibration hit his sensitive skin. "Harry!" Draco squeaked through his rushed panting and Harry had finally mercy with him.
Breathing heavily, he slammed the loo’s door shut and sank against it. His head thumped against the wood as he stared up to the ceiling and tried to get his turmoiled thoughts in check. This was the most horrendous torture he had ever suffered. And he cursed his treacherous body, which eagerly responded to what he had read.
"Uh, ah yes," he said befuddled. Another thing Malfoys didn't do. Then he tried to sound concerned instead of curious, "Are you and Weasley alright?"
Ron looked dumbfounded. "W-what do you mean?” he stuttered. Certainly, Harry didn’t mean holding hands with the blond Slytherin git.
"Harry," Ginny said while taking a step closer to him, "you will get him back. I watched you in the last few weeks and although I haven't given Malfoy much attention, I saw him that day while you fought You-Know-Who, his feelings must run deeper if that fight couldn't destroy them." She put both hands on his shoulders and pulled him into a hug.
"Harry... fine. Yes, you were an idiot, an extraordinary idiot, but I won't tell Ron a thing. It is your decision to tell him, but I do want to know, since when did you realize you had feelings for Draco other than hate," Hermine asked curiously once again.
Draco's breath came easier with time. "I heard him talking to Granger and Weasley. The Weasel said mean things about me and Harry he-," Draco's voice broke as he remembered the vile things that had left Harry's mouth. "He said I'm not his type. That I'm too controlling and that whoever dated me must have a death wish, that I'm ugly-," his voice became so small at the confession, that Pansy had to strain her ears to make out the words.
Draco sighed and then smiled at his friend, "Let’s forget about that subject. Let us go, I‘m starving."
"Hm, I don’t know. I think I heard him talking about traveling after school before he decides what to do as a profession.” She packed her books and papers away, and while waiting on Draco to finish she scrutinized him with a curious expression. "What do you want to do after school?” she asked.
"Come, Harry, we've got better things to do." With that, she grabbed Harry‘s arm and guided him out of the Great Hall.
Harry sighed again, leaning into Malfoy‘s ear. "Did you apologize to her?" he asked and pointed with his chin towards the owner of the Three Broomsticks. Malfoy nodded with big silvery eyes, "Yes, I wrote her a letter."
The nightmare had left him shaken to his bones but the fresh cold air ease his mind and he could think clearer. He knew that after all the bad things that had happened that particular night brought something good... no fantastic with it.
Hermione snorted, "Has your life become so boring that you see the need to kill your tastebuds?” She chuckled at his antics and cleaned his bowl out with a swish of her wand. "Here, now you can do it right”
"Let yourself be surprised. I will spoil you rotten today," Harry answered with a slight growl to his voice, as he smirked at Draco and pushed him back down onto the duvet.
Pansy had seen Potter fleeing the hall and shot a gleeful gaze in Draco's direction. The blond Slytherin looked like he was about to storm off after the Gryffindor. Blaise had to hold him back at his arm so he wouldn't actually do it. "Blaise let me go," Draco hissed and tried to fetch his arm back. "No, you will stay and let him feel how it hurts to be mocked. We're Slytherin's Draco. We will not let it go, not when we were played badly." Pansy nodded in agreement and Draco let himself plop down on his seat again with a sigh.
A gentle, strong hand had gripped the back of his head and kept him from splitting his skull. The Slytherin's other hand was on his hip and held him upright, while Malfoy's slim body was just too close and exuded an incredible heat.
It just couldn't be. Was he that easy to replace? What actually allowed Zabini to touch his Draco and joke with him? It just wasn't fair.
His heart was beating frantically as he checked one last time that the small box was still in his pocket. Then he nodded to Ron and Hermione, who both crossed their fingers for him, and headed for the Slytherin table.
He would think about it, would talk about it, and would completely vanish it from his brain. He sincerely hoped that the writer would have mercy on him and not send him something again.
"I thought you liked being famous," Draco asked surprisedly and dabbed his face with a handkerchief.
Blaise took everything in a stride. He laughed about it when asked by Pansy and curiously eyed every owl in the hope to find the one who had delivered the parchment to find its owner. But so far without a positive outcome.
His friends were too good at heart and he knew that he also needed to come around if he wanted to stay their friend.
He didn’t register that Draco looked one last time back at him with bright eyes before the blond rounded the corner and got out of sight. Harry felt too numb, too done with everything. He was nothing more than an empty shell as he stood there and fell apart.
Pansy was sitting in the common room and startled when the entrance burst open and a sudden flurry of blond hair with billowing robes passed by her as though a miniature storm had hit her. The small glimpse she had gotten of Draco's face had told her enough. Something had gone horribly wrong. Draco would never let his guard down in such a way, especially not where anyone could see him. She jumped up quickly; the Witch Weekly she had been reading was left forgotten on the table, as she ran after him.
Draco dared for a moment to gaze after the Gryffindor and his eyes naturally found their way to Potter's perfect bum.
The other faction was the exact opposite. This group consisted mostly of Gryffindors, also Ravenclaws and Huffelpuffs had joined them, but they helped everyone who needed help with a few exceptions. Those being Zabini, Parkinson, Goyle, and Malfoy.
So Harry had taken her advice to heart, even if he was absolutely miserable in writing letters, especially when it came to his feelings, and had written to Draco.
Harry just stared at him, mouth slightly open. Draco was so near that Harry could count every single one of his pale lashes. His expressive eyes half-hidden by them looked silvery as he lifted Harry's hand to his mouth and lightly blew over the blisters.
"Oh, just so. I saw him running out of the hall as if a Nundu was on his heels and vanishing into the boy's loo. He looked distressed." She paused and shot him a measuring look. "He didn’t get hexed again, didn’t he?"
"Uhm… yeah… you see… I wanted to apologize to you about my behavior from before about… Malfoy and the bullying… Uhm, I get it now. So… sorry about that,” reeled Ron, glad that he'd finally said it. Now he just hoped his friend would forgive him.
"Hey! I’m right here Potter.” Pansy scowled but her eyes had an amused twinkle as she took in Harry’s ruffled look. His cheeks were burning bright pink and his green eyes shot daggers at Hermione but not only in a warning. He seemed amused himself to a certain degree, which only made Pansy more curious about what was written in the mail.
Hermione shook her bushy head, "Boys," she muttered and grinned at the Slytherin girl. "You can't believe them sometimes," Pansy nodded in agreement.
He grinned at his reflection and rounded on Ron. "I would hope so," he smirked and pushed his friend to the door. It was time to go to breakfast and let his plan unfold.
Which brought him back to his actual mission. He still had the nail varnish on his fingers and needed to find Granger to get it removed. He folded the parchment neatly and stuffed it in the pocket of his expensive trousers.
Ron grunted suddenly, making Harry almost jump out of his skin. In a hurry he grabbed his wand and shot a hastily cast ‘
At some point at three o'clock in the morning, he finally fell asleep, a happy smile on his face when his last thought was on the surprised expression on his boyfriend's face, which he would hopefully make a pleasant surprise tomorrow.
Ron paced around the room he shared with Harry. He hadn’t talked much with his friend but now he wanted to apologize. In the past few weeks, he had observed his fellow students and noticed a few shocking things he couldn’t deny anymore.
He was startled with a shock when Harry dropped to one of his knees and looked up at him with a beautiful smile. Harry pulled out a small box and opened it. Over the first squeals from some female students close by, he heard Harry raise his voice as he continued speaking.
A guffaw escaped Draco’s mouth at that and he clapped a hand in horror over it. Malfoys didn't guffaw. But he couldn’t hold the snicker in when Hermione waggled telling her brows at him.
And amidst the screams of disbelief and ecstatic squeaks of the others present, Harry got back to his feet with a beaming smile and twinkling green eyes and put the ring on Draco's finger. He was so happy. He felt overjoyed that he was back together with Harry who was now his fiancé.
Harry's body was bowed over Draco's back as he thrust into the willing hole of the Slytherin's body. His breath was erratic, his fingers clutching tightly at the blond's hips, leaving bruising imprints. He felt Draco's velvet channel clutching him tightly, massaging his hot rod from the tip to the root with every back and forth of his hips.
"Okay, thanks and I think you two shouldn't try again to talk to him. I have the feeling it went more downhill after your last attempt," Harry said, nodded at them, and left the Great Hall without them.
A goofy grin spread suddenly over Harry's lips, "Yes, your highness," he said, bowing to the Slytherin with a mockingly raised eyebrow.
"Yeah. Told everyone that you were excused and they should shove their prejudice up their arses. They don’t know what you’ve gone through. He certainly was passionate about it." Blaise smirked and waggled his eyebrows. "Maybe you‘ve now a chance to befriend him like you always wanted."
Draco’s heart sprung into his throat. How could Potter so casually touch him as if they were the best of friends? He clenched his jaw and looked up. "Don’t-,” the sentence died on his lips as a hand was thrust before his eyes.
Harry flinched at Ron's bellowing and something hard twisted in his guts. Harry knew Ron still hated Draco. He couldn't do this right now. But what he was about to do, also wasn't something he ever wanted to do. But stupidly he did it anyway, just to avoid Ron's outrage turning on him and going overboard.
"Duh, I just noticed that you look horrible and it isn‘t something you normally show." Blaise ducked his head a little and cast his brown eyes to the floor. He seemed to be searching for words. When he finally found them he looked determinedly at Draco. "You see … I miss my old friend. We said some horrible things to each other and you cast me away in sixth year and I was fucking angry with you, but …" He scuffed his feet on the ground. "No more. I want to be friends again, Draco. I know why you did it. I understand now that you wanted to protect me. It took me a long time to overcome what seemed like mistrust. But now I get it. I really do, ... and I want to try being friends again, … if you want too."
Draco thought, noticing the use of his first name in bewilderment, and sat down. His back was ramrod straight and he fiddled with his fingers in front of him.
Draco had been sitting in the mostly abandoned alcove, looking over the Black Lake while trying to make plans for their anniversary tonight. He had wanted to surprise Harry. He had hidden further into the alcove when he heard footsteps approach, wishing not to be seen since some of the students weren't kind to him. Given that he had the Dark Mark and everyone thought he got it willingly, it was to no surprise to him that they were angry, that he had been allowed back to school. But they were wrong. He only got the Dark Mark because he wanted to protect his parents, there wasn't another reason. In some of the group sessions, the students had with a mind healer, he had said so and some of his fellow students, mostly the younger ones, understood the need to protect what was dearest to you. But still, he didn't want to be disturbed at the moment and sat quietly, waiting for the footsteps to pass.
"No, Ron,” Harry said, getting angry. "I don’t think that’s just a phase and I’m not confused. Sure, I dated Ginny but that doesn’t mean that I’m straight.” Harry deflated. "It’s just … what I feel for him is … so real and exciting and I … can’t describe it well, but it never felt like that with Ginny. Sorry.” Harry didn’t know why he apologized now, but he was just so …
The silence around the table was almost tangible but then both boys broke into a laugh when they witnessed the bewildered looks on their friends' faces. It got so far that even Ron grinned and let out a loud
"Malfoy?" Harry squeaked, remembering the sodding parchment of this morning and the weird behavior of the Slytherin. "Why would you ask about him?"
Both boys looked at her bewildered. They never had thought that Hermione of all people would be concerned about Malfoy and above all curse in that manner. She huffed annoyed at them and glanced at Harry with sad eyes. He had the feeling he was falling apart. He had let himself be led into verbally abusing his boyfriend by Ron and the look Hermione gave him could fill one of those thick tomes she always had with her.
Blaise gave him a curious gaze but Draco shook his head. "It’s nothing. Well, I need to deal with it. So … are you hungry?" he changed the topic and prayed that his ears didn’t glow. Salazar, it was embarrassing that he couldn’t get the story out of his mind. He smiled slightly at his friend when he nodded and started to change his clothes.
Draco eyed the owl warily for a moment and then flushed bright red. "What is it?" Blaise asked curiously. "I seem to be the only one who doesn’t know what’s going on."
"Ah, Pans let the love birds be. They must have talked about how to best get their alone time without us," Blaise smirked.
Draco, who hadn't heard anything of the conversation, froze in mid-step when he recognized the boy the Weaslette was hugging. Immediately a sharp pain shot through his heart and he suddenly had problems breathing properly. He braced himself with one hand against the wall of the house while his other tensed up in his sweater over his heart.
Draco’s head snapped around, almost giving him whiplash, as he starred horror-stricken into his nemesis' brilliant green eyes. He hadn’t noticed that the Great Hall had slowly filled with students, too entranced by the story which was balled up in his trembling fist. His mouth gaped open but only a whimper found its way out, as he tried to find scanting words for his past enemy.
"I don't care if he has changed, Hermione," said Ron harshly, getting out of his paralysis. "He is a fucking Death Eater, he bears the Dark Mark on his arm and his bloody Death Eater father, who tried to murder my sister, is in Azkaban where he belongs. That Malfoy isn't locked in there with him is an outrage in itself, and I mourn the poor soul that happens to get stuck dating him." His blue eyes flashed angrily at his girlfriend as he said this.
When the groups met, duels would break out with minor to moderate injuries and hexes. Ron was once being caught up in the middle while trying to break them apart. And he had the ominous suspicion that both of the groups were responsible for bullying Malfoy. It had subsided by now, but when it happened it was all the more violent. Ron had met Filch once when he had to scrub unsightly red paint off the walls. The words had clearly been addressed to the blonde Slytherin, even if most of it had already been blurred.
when Harry opened his mouth and it was a good measure for the rant that he bellowed out. "I can't believe him! How is it that he can simply show the cold shoulder to me after everything? And then that Zabini git, with his hands all over him.”
She seemed to be talking to someone, but Draco couldn't tell who was standing there since the person was behind the curve of the house.
But what worried him more were the other two groups. They were like two factions fighting against each other. One group consisted mostly of Slytherins with a few Ravenclaws and Huffelpuffs mixed in between them. They roamed the castle, blaming everyone and everything for their own mistakes. They annoyed Filch, not that Ron felt a lot sorry for the man, but the statements that he was a worthless Squip were worrying. They also hexed younger students and generally bullied people they didn't like.
"Then let him," Pansy said abrasively, "He doesn't deserve your sympathy Draco, not after what he did to you."
Harry was flustered, Ron’s reaction had gotten badly to him and he had already openly dissed his boyfriend. Without thinking he called out the first name that came to mind, just so he could get it over with. "Cedric," Harry said, looking down, thinking 'No, no, no!' the whole time, it just felt wrong, so very wrong.
Harry watched with broken eyes as Zabini kept touching Draco subtly, tucking a curl of his soft blond hair behind his ear and winking at him teasingly.
"No, I'm not stalking Malfoy, and you know that he was up to something bad back then," Harry groaned. He wanted to pull his hair out. This was frustrating. He thought that he had diverted the attention away from Draco, but now Hermione had sprung on that train yet again. "And no, I'm not meeting up with him," Harry huffed, getting annoyed. "It isn't that simple," he muttered.
As soon as I had voiced the question, I bit my tongue. It was quite an obvious request, in fact, I was sure Draco expected me to ask him about it sooner or later, but that did not diminish my rising nervousness.
"So, what are you thinking about?" Blaise asked, looking at the fire and lifting the cup to his lips.
, he had even told Ron of his own free will. It was early, he was aware of that, but then again, they were all at an age when such things weren’t exactly unusual. Maybe the others just assumed that this
Reminding himself to go slowly, Harry moved only a little at a time, watching Draco's expression, which had become almost illegible. His eyes were closed, his teeth dug into his lower lip, slight creases adorned his forehead and a bead of sweat dripped down his temple. He didn't make a sound, only his controlled breath reached Harry's ear.
Draco's hair bounced slightly while he nodded. Harry had never seen Draco so fascinated, it brought a gentle smile to his face. He raised his hand and pushed blond strands of hair behind Draco's ear. This beauty really did drive him out of his mind. His heart couldn't take it much longer either.
"Nevertheless, I think it's over. We both did things we regret. I think in a way we both had to and wanted to forgive each other to move on."
"Can I kiss you? Please?" Harry finally asked, the pleased smile on Draco's lips was pure redemption. Draco interlaced his fingers with Harry's, drew him closer so that their bodies met. Harry's breath faltered and Draco's smile broadened before he finally nodded.
"Of course, Mrs. Longbottom," uttered Draco coldly, before he cleared his throat and turned to Harry. "Upstairs, on the left. It's the first door on the right. You'll find our room there."
Now Mr Potter glares at Anja angrily, demanding an explanation. Anja feels there is more to the anger. Something she does not understand. "I suspect that Mr Malfoy doesn't remember."
Another glance went to the ceiling, the mirror flickering too much to recognise a clear image, Harry looked back into Draco's face, in his expression lay pure hunger and thirst. He shoved his hands into his shimmering hair, clutching it tightly and biting his lip as he noticed Harry's attentive gaze. "Can I still count on your dick inside me today, Mr Potter? Or –"
, Harry silently admonished himself and stared at some dark tiles in front of him to collect his thoughts.
It had been a typical Monday at the Ministry. Harry had spent his day poking his nose into paperwork that didn't interest him in the slightest, had been lectured by Hermione about his continued refusal to train the trainees of the Aurors Recruitment Programme (he just knew, that the newbies would only gawk at him) and then, for some inexplicable reason (he had fallen asleep at his desk over the particularly boring Bastedo file), he had unintentionally worked overtime, which made him arrive at his sweet home a full two hours late.
He would pull this off tomorrow, even if the whole of the wizarding world was against them, he didn't care. He would show everyone that Draco was his; the rest of the world could go to hell for all he cared; he had done his part in the war and deserved to be happy now.
Then she said, "Maybe I shouldn’t remove it.” Grinning at him, she wiggled her eyebrows and Draco finally closed his open-hanging mouth.
Harry squeaked unmanly and threw the parchment against the wall where it rolled lazily into a now rumbled roll again.
Zabini’s skin was the exact opposite. His dark complexion showed an even darker blush and his mouth gaped open in shock. "I second that, Weasley. What the bloody fuck is that?” he asked, agitated.
There, he had said it. His breath was ragged as he waited for the reaction to the bomb he had just dropped on his friends.
"Erm-" Harry began, but Ron shouted enraged, cutting Harry off mid-sentence, "No way, who in their right mind would like that pointy, rude, arrogant ass? He’s fucking Death Eater scum!"
Draco got out of his befuddlement when he heard Granger’s loud laughter. "Oh my!” she wheezed, wiping a stray tear from her eye.
Placing the shiny glass bottle beside his right knee, he pushed his arse over Draco's half-hard cock, making both of them moan, and fumbled with the Slytherin's belt buckle.
Malfoy approaching Hermione on his own, she holding his hands and talking kindly to him, even though he was an arrogant asshole to her. And then came Harry and Ron just couldn’t take his eyes away. His best friend was absolutely smitten with the slimy git. Even blushed while caressing his fingers.
Harry scuffed his shoe on the ground and bit his lip. Then he suddenly snapped his head up and spat out, "I'm gay."
Harry knew deep down that she knew or at least suspected that he had a crush on Draco and that she was utterly disappointed in him for saying shite like that. Harry was also frustrated. With himself. Why hadn't he stood up to Ron, when this shitty talk began? Why hadn't he drawn on his Gryffindor bravery and got it all out in one go? Now the damage was done and Harry hoped insistently that Draco would never hear about this. He didn't want to hurt him, he never did, but what's done was done and he couldn't take it back now.
Okay, maybe he would be caught in Madam Puddifoot‘s if the exotic teas described in the story were real. Maybe he could check it out at the weekend when they got down to Hogsmeade.
"Draco, Draco, Draco … mine," he moaned as his rhythm began to falter. He was so fucking close, he just couldn't hold back anymore.
Headmistress McGonagall had warned the students after that, that she wouldn’t tolerate any of this nonsense and would take tough actions should something like that happen again. But Malfoy’s exit told him that her warning had gone unheard to some people. Harry contemplated if he should have a talk with her and alerted her to the incident but wasn’t too sure that it had been one. For the most part, the Slytherin hadn’t seemed harmed, only startled and kind of embarrassed. Okay, a freaking lot of embarrassment given the almost glowing red color that had graced his skin up to his ears.
Hermione smirked at him, mirth bleeding into her eyes. She held out her hand. "Show me," she demanded, gesturing at Draco’s hands.
The spectacle was breathtaking and nerve-wracking, every year anew and when Harry took his usual seat at the Gryffindor table, he groaned loudly as a downright owl storm descended on him and drowned him in a mountain of pink letters and chocolate hearts.
"Yes, okay. We will take this slowly. But, you really need to work that out with them. I don't want to wait another two years to finally have you all to my own," Draco admonished his boyfriend.
Draco finished with a flourish and snorted while he tapped his wand against the parchment to dry the ink. "I don’t have many options,” he answered while rolling the paper tightly together and stashed it in his black messenger bag.
Laughing at that and smiling all over his face, Harry cleared the bathroom and opened his trunk. Thoughtfully, he took out the small, velvety black box and stowed it in the pocket of his emerald-green vest before throwing on his school robe.
