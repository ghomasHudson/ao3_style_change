Draco picked up his bag and prepared to leave when Harry asked him if he could wait for him, as they had the next class together too. Draco was about to agree when Weasley interrupted.
Draco started walking in the dark, the sound of a drop falling in water and his steps the only things interrupting the now sporadic bursts of laugh.
Wasn’t it enough that he had been stuck in Hogwarts after the war because his dad was exiled in France and his mother had chosen to go with him? Leaving him all on his own in stupid Hogwarts, where the other students were always ignoring him. Not that it bothered him at all. He would be rather ignored than mocked or worse, as it had been just a few days back, when a group of Gryffindors found him distracted in one of the gardens and decided they’d like to have a little fun with him.
“And finally, but not surprising, Mister Potter got a perfect grade!” Slughorn looked like he had already recovered from Harry’s insolence earlier. “However, Mister Malfoy seems to think he’s too good for team work and didn’t present a sample of his work. Consequently, he has no grade in this assignment and will have to do extra work.” Draco thought he saw an evil glint in Slughorn’s eyes as he gave his sentence.
Draco could hear Harry rummaging in his closet and felt his anger and embarrassment fade away. After all, stupid Potter (
After Harry had completed his transition into the plantae kingdom, Slughorn offered the antidote to Draco who, as he had seen everyone else, dipped his finger in it and stepped toward the Harry-shaped sculpture. Then he panicked.
“Don’t you like it, Draco?” The girl was talking with a million voices, fragments of stories that Draco knew too well. The fountain started spitting blood and the butterflies became ashes falling from the sky.
He took the towel and dried himself, replacing the wet underwear with the towel. He wobbled towards his closet and chose a clean pair of boxers and a comfy shirt.
Draco’s master narrowed his eyes at him, as if trying to decipher his deepest thoughts. “It is true that maintaining him alive can become a nuisance in the future, but I haven’t seen your curses in a while.” He waited for Draco to answer. “Are you refusing?” His master’s voice was as cold and calm as ice, just waiting for him to make a mistake to break under his feet and drag him to the bottomless darkness.
“Wow, Malfoy, leave me something.” Harry was eating more slowly, probably because he had been eating a little more continuously than Draco, though not
When he opened his eyes again and turned to see his companion he found Harry watching him with curiosity and, if his eyes and his heart didn’t deceive him, something that could be mistaken with kindness, or even affection.
in his arms. Still, Harry was sure that if he stayed there for just a moment longer he would probably have the same problem, so he rose from the bed (
“Hi.” Harry answered, looking like he was to stroke Draco’s cheek but then Draco remembered where they were and stepped back, motioning for Harry to give him the bottle. He drank the rest of the sample and felt like he was falling into sleep very rapidly, at the same time that a numbness took over him.
“I-I-I-I don’t know w-what you’re t-t-t-talking about” Draco stammered as he turned to check on their cauldron’s fire temperature.
Draco pushed the door, waiting for Slughorn’s scolding, but it never came. Instead, there was a collective gasp and then the class was spinning and he was dropping and Harry was rushing towards him, pulling him out of the class and maybe Draco was still not fully himself, since he couldn’t really make sense out of any of this.
). Draco turned and he saw the same eyes that had been watching him the night before, and all that day, eyes now filled with worry and a concern so sincere that Draco couldn’t contain the choked sob that fought to escape his lips (
Draco couldn’t believe his ears. Did Harry Fucking Potter just apologized to him? To him, the Death Eater that killed Dumbledore? Maybe he was still dreaming?
Even though he told himself this, Draco couldn’t control his sweat glandes, as he knew what the nightmare had in store for him.
Draco nodded, not capable of restrain his eyes from pouring those stupid tears as he hear Harry offer something not even his family had given him. Support. Hope. Friendship.
Harry’s face lit up with the thought of spending time with Draco, even if it meant watching over some stupid concoction.
“Can we stay here today?” Draco hoped that didn’t sound too much like begging. He knew he hadn’t succeeded by the look in Harry’s face, so he just keep talking, waiting for Harry to reject him. “You know, we could arrange our things and stuff and decorate and I don’t know, maybe I can help a little with your tower of homework and by the way why don’t you organize your time better, you’re such a mess…” Draco covered his mouth in an attempt of retrieving those last words he had let out, afraid he had angered Harry.
Draco and Harry returned together to their room after lunch having, as Harry had said that morning, the entire afternoon to install properly in their new rooms. They didn’t say anything in their way to their room, they didn’t have to.
“How come? And what are you doing now?” Harry looked interested in what Draco was doing in the potion.
Draco watched Harry speechlessly as he took him by the arm and guided him to a corner of a mostly empty table.
“Now, who can tell me what kind of potion are we going to brew today?” He hadn’t even finished the question when Hermione’s hand was up. “Ah, Miss Granger, as helpful as always.” Slughorn indicated Granger to answer with a nod.
“But why would someone do that, Mister Malfoy?” Now Draco was sure that Slughorn knew that was his sample too, he just loved to torture him too much to give up now.
i think the pwp will be another work entirely, i just dont think it fits in this story as well, but i'll link it when i post it
Draco tried to ignore the whimpers in the corner of the room, a human suffering and nothing he could do to help.
“I’m just asking, did you sleep well last night?” Draco could almost swear that he saw a smirk in Harry’s face. “Because I didn’t have nightmares for the first night in a long time.”
“Harry, where were you this morning? We didn’t see you at the Hall.” Exclaimed the redhead while throwing an untrusty look towards Draco.
“All right, all right, I forgive you, ok? Now can we end this conversation? I’m tired as fuck.” Draco flopped down in his bed, his back towards Harry.
“Why not? Oh, never mind I get it.” Harry had an understanding look that if it were plastered in anyone else’s face Draco would have tried to punch them. “I’ll go, do you want me to bring something for you?”
Draco mentally bashed his horny self against any solid surface he could find in his mind. To this point, the sturdy desk (
“Fuck you, Potter. I don’t need your help, I’m not a pathetic coward. I’m not willing to be your new charity case. If you want someone to protect then why don’t you go search a stupid girl that actually wants you? I told you once, I’m not your friend. I’ll never be.” Draco said this with such a livid look and composed tone that Harry was astonished. He didn’t come out of his daze until Draco turned and cholericly stomped away.
“Potter, I know you worry about him, but I’m doing my best. You should take care of yourself, eat something.” Madame Pomfrey gave him an amused look. “I would tell you to get some sleep, but I believe you have that covered.”
When Madame Pomfrey threatened him with a curse, Harry had no choice but to leave. However, he went straight to their room to get his Invisibility Cloak and quickly came back to Draco’s side. He hadn’t even gone to dinner, afraid that the slightest hesitation on his part would make a difference on Draco’s state. Which hadn’t really changed all that much since he had fainted, except for a couple times his fever had come back. Harry had taken upon himself to make sure the wet cloth in his forehead remained fresh and the covers were up to his chin. Sometimes the blonde’s brow furrowed and Harry worried he might be having a nightmare, but Draco’s face promptly smoothed out when Harry held his hand, or brushed aside a lock from his face.
Draco was starting to panic. Not only did he get Potter as partner but he also wanted to share quality time with him?
Remembering the times when his samples had been intriguingly broken or altered, Draco placed their work beside the others’. By the time he was back to their (
“I guess you have. Well, we obviously don’t want to kill you…. Yet. Plus it would mean a lot of legal trouble for us. We just want you gone for a while! So, this is a diluted solution of the poison. As I said, it won’t kill you but it will give you a bad time for a while.”
Draco bit back a moan as he arched with pleasure, his orgasm rolling over him like a wave. His fantasies always stopped there, not because of trying, but because he couldn’t even imagine what happened next. Would Harry be sweet, making sure Draco was alright at all times? Or would he be rough, taking out years of frustration and pent up hatred against Malfoy?
“Please, Madame Pomfrey, please.” Draco’s eyes were closing, and he didn’t have enough strength to do anything but whisper. “
Draco mentally rolled his eyes to the flagrant adulation the professor showed toward Granger as he walked to the ingredients cabinet. Not that she annoyed Draco usually, it was just that all the teachers tried to make patent their gratitude to the Golden Trio for saving the Wizarding World from the Dark Lord. Not that he complained. After all, if they hadn’t, he’d still be trapped at the Malfoy Manor, trembling at the thought of the day when they told him the Boy Who Lived had died and the Dark Lord was the undisputedly Master of the Wizarding World. But he didn’t appreciate the blatant adoration those three were subject of. In any case, they weren’t the only ones who fought for the fall of the Dark Lord. Dozens of people had lived and died for the freedom they sought. Former Gryffindors, Slytherins, Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, men and women, fathers, mothers, sons, daughters and friends, old people, young people, even children were part of the rebellion. But who were recognized for the last victory? This guys and their people, the Gryffindor’s house, as if they alone were fighting the treacherous, poisoned house of Slytherin and the evil that lurked within its members. Draco opened the doors of the cupboard and started piling the ingredients in his arms. He couldn’t locate the firebee honey. When he turned to ask someone where it was he noticed there was no one near. He spun just to discover that the rest of the class was a few feet behind, looking like they were waiting him to finish. He sneered at them before returning to his search.
“Anyway, you heard Granger, right? It seems that our potion was fine!” Draco tried to change the topic to more cheerful ways.
Hi hoomans! this is more anst for your dark souls. and a little fluff. AAAnnnddd I post this almost in time, I'm getting better at due dates and stuff... tho I don't promise anything for the next chapter as it's being a hell to write.... oh yeah this is the second night.
“Hey.” Harry reached for Draco when he didn’t answer. “Hey. Stop.” He grasped Draco’s shoulder and forced him to face him, concern written in his features. “I don’t know what’s up but don’t worry about it.”
When time was up, Professor Slughorn asked for volunteers to being the first table to show their results and, unsurprisingly, Granger’s hand shot up. She and her partner, Weasley, went to the front with their vial. Granger was serene, though the red haired boy looked a tad nervous. When Granger drank a few drops of the poison she turned into what looked like a perfect replica of her carved into a block of cherry tree. Then Slughorn offered the bottle with the antidote to Weasley, who dipped his index finger in it and dabbed Hermione lips with it. Slowly, she started to recover, blinking and shaking her head a little. When she was fully herself, the class broke into applause. Slughorn watched, pleased with his star student last triumph. All partners continued to pass as they were seated in the room, so Draco and Harry were left for the last. Draco wasn’t worried about the test, he knew he had done properly the potion and it wouldn’t cause any problems. Harry, on the other hand, looked more nervous but Draco thought he knew why. Not knowing exactly what he had done nor how to know if the potion was well done, Harry’s fear was more for the unknown than for the poison. Draco, knowing this, took the vial to drink first but Harry stopped his hand in mid-air, taking the bottle from him to his utter surprise. He gulped once with eyes scrunched shut and waited. Draco saw as he turned into a wooden mannequin, oak by the looks of it.
” He spat the name as if it were poison. “I should think you would like to have a little fun with him.” The Dark Lord stopped dead in front of Draco, no more than two feet apart. He stared at him with those inhuman eyes and Draco knew his mind was being examined.
) pronounced those two words effortlessly, soft honey in a fly trap. He was as dangerous as he seemed.
Draco heard their steps resonating along the empty corridors as he and his aunt hurried to the dining hall of the Malfoy Manor, where He Who Shall Not Be Named had established his headquarters.
“Why did you do that?” Harry looked angry, although Draco was pretty sure that he wasn’t angry with him but with the whole situation.
When Draco finished turning his stomach inside out and there was no more puke in him at least for the next five years he washed his face and rinsed his mouth. As he peered into the mirror he found his pale face returning the glare with a stupid, half crazed grin in his mouth. He was happy, if he had to be honest. But he also was worried as fuck. How was he supposed to live through this without either killing himself or Harry or worse, embarrass himself while making Harry hate him?
Draco choked in an attempt to swallow the tears before Harry saw them but failed as he helped him on his feet.
He had been too closed, too curt to act like a friend of him but still he wanted, he longed to be not exactly friends, but something even closer, deeper.
“Professor,” Draco tried to pretend security and found it pretty easy thanks to the rage that Harry had caused in him. “my name was written in the same sample that Harry’s, we both made the potion.”
“Oh, um, y’know, I was just wondering if you would mind helping me with potions since, as you already said, I’m a disaster in this class.”
“What?” Harry scorned towards Draco. “Are you going to tell me this isn’t worth it? To let it go? That your grades are less important than mine? Or are you just afraid of speaking up?”
“I can’t go in there.” Draco whispered, his words little more than a breath as he caressed the old wood of the doors. His face was even paler than his already ashen tone, provided by the lack of sleep. “I can’t.”
Draco scowled at Harry’s way. Harry just threw him an exhausted look. He didn’t look like he had got a lot of sleep these past days. Not that anyone could, after all the atrocities they had witnessed the week before this. The day when he had chosen his loyalties. When he had lost so many friends and so much of his innocence. The day when the end began.
Then he felt it. First it wasn’t more than a whoosh of air, like a summer breeze. Then it was like the blanket his mother used to cover him when he came home after a day of playing in the snow. He turned to see what it was and there was
“No, I’m fine.” Draco tried to keep on attaching the poster he was trying to put over his headboard without looking too nervous.
Draco was angry with Harry, so angry that he didn’t care about what he was doing. He walked to the one place he felt safe in. The old Slytherin common room, now used as dorms for the second years. He stormed through the door and ran to his secret place, a small room which door was hidden behind a tapestry. When he was inside, he reached for the window, sitting beside and distractedly observing the underwater sight, fishes swimming and algae dancing with the current.
“For the umpteenth time, shut up!” Draco exclaimed pointlessly as they entered the dungeon that served as Potions workroom.
One minute he had been walking to Potions and the next he knew, someone had stunned him from behind, telling him to disappear already.
“It was from my father… but you know that, don’t you Draco?” The girl stared at him with her deep blue eyes, silently accusing him.
“Because I know you suck at potions and if you think you can drag me with you to the bottom you got to be even more stupid than I thought.”
Professor McGonagall was calling the letter G, and the know-it-all Granger was paired with Padma Patil, and they were already sat together chatting about facts that only they cared about and Draco couldn’t breathe and there were so much less students than in the Sorting Ceremony and he knew why and he was going to get sick if he wasn’t already and Professor McGonagall was already calling the letter J and it was a relief because that meant he had another letter yet but then she was calling fucking Macmillan and why the fuck hadn’t survived any students with last names with letter K or L and then she was calling him and that meant he actually had a roommate and he wanted to go to the front but he couldn’t because he was frozen with panic and then there it was, Harry was holding his hand squeezing it and telling him to go and that it would be fine and his feet moved on their own an then he was in the front confronting the students’ faces filled with hate and despise and hearing them mutter about him and everything was so much, too much and then Professor McGonagall said the name of his new roommate and then there was silence because no one could believe it and even the Hufflepuffs couldn’t cheer this time when Harry walked slowly to the front and smiled at him and said in a low voice: “I’m glad it was you, aren’t you glad too?” And he was but he couldn’t say he couldn’t speak and he just wished they were away far far away with no one near so he could tell Harry how relieved and thankful he was for this but also he wanted to go to the bathroom to throw up and that’s what he did, he jumped in a crazy sprint toward the hall door trying to beat the nausea to the restroom, barely making it.
“No.” Draco was throwing a fit in his bed and he didn’t care at all, he hadn’t had enough sleep and that always made him grumpy as hell. This he explained to Harry, though with a more colourful language.
“Shit.” Draco averted his gaze as he let his hands drop the book he was holding. “I’m sorry, Draco, I should have noticed.” Harry’s brows furrowed in concentration as he tried to remember all the little evil things he had been seeing without paying attention, the sudden falls of students who casually were from Slytherin, the way their house hourglass didn’t seem to add up and the most recent incident in Potions that morning, as Draco had himself pointed.
“Yes, Mister Malfoy, and I’m afraid it’s only happened to Slytherin students.  We still don’t know what is wrong, and they’re fading quickly. So if you remember anything, please, Mister Malfoy, tell me.”
They finished the poison successfully and in time, much to Draco’s relief and Harry’s amazement. Draco filled a bottle with a sample and labelled it with their names before taking it to the professor’s desk.
“Well…” Harry looked unsure as he started to phrase his question. “What were you dreaming last night?”
He grasped Draco’s shoulder and moved it a bit. Draco. The pale white eyelashes fluttered and Harry stared.
“I was wondering when would you go out” Harry smirked at Draco in a way that made his knees wobble and remember his last conversation with himself.
Harry watched intently Draco’s livid face, searching for something even though he couldn’t say what he was looking for. He gently raised his hand to take the other boy’s hand and started to rub circles in it with his thumb. Harry didn’t really know what he was doing but he figured if he got the other boy to relax then it would be ok. Draco tore his gaze from the doors slowly, just to let it land on their intertwined hands and specially Harry’s thumb, as if he didn’t understand what it was doing there. Gradually, the blank stare he had in his eyes disappeared, replaced by concern.
Once he was done dressing and rehearsed his best I-don’t-fucking-care-motherfuckers face in front of the mirror, Draco was ready to go.
Draco tried to hide the pain that Harry’s stern words had caused him under a layer of coldness. “No. I was just going to ask you to let me deal with this. Those are my grades, after all.”
This time however, it was just white. No noise, no smells, no nothing but the sensory peace Draco craved so
Ok that's it. I cried blood tears when writing this and my beta wanted to kill me but here is it: the angst you people were waiting for.
Anyway, Draco was a sculpture now. A beautiful, perfectly detailed sculpture carved in ash tree. For a moment Harry thought that he had never seen anything so gorgeous but then he remembered the way Draco had looked that sunrise, a few hours before he woke, sleeping safely between his arms with his face showing the most peaceful features ever. A slight blush crept to his cheeks when Slughorn poked him lightly in the arm with the antidote. He had forgotten where he was and what he was supposed to be doing. He had forgotten everything but the statue of the boy he loved in front of him. Harry took some antidote with his thumb and cupping his face with his hand, ran it over Draco’s lips. Then he saw how the silver haired boy started to become alive again, his eyelids fluttering as if he was dreaming and his features scrunching up. He gasped as if he were emerging from deep waters and opened his eyes. Those grey eyes that looked afraid until they met his gaze. The same eyes he had seen sparkle with fury, hate and resentment but also glow with a soft light until they looked like abysmal pitches of molten silver.
“So, can I ask you something?” Harry inquired tentatively after a while, as if trying not to scare Draco.
Draco drifted through the rest of his classes doing his best to ignore fucking Potter, though it turned out to be a hell of a work as he seemed to be trying his best to fill his I’m-being-friendly roll. He let out a sigh of relief as he listened to the bell marking the end of classes and the call to lunch.
Between the disturbance and the command, Draco pointed his wand down. As he turned to look to the cause of the uproar, his body was seized by a curse. A brown head and a ginger head stormed through the opening in the window casting spells at anything moving. The Dark Lord had fled when he saw the pair accompanied by a squad of aurors, leaving his minions behind to clean his mess. Draco couldn’t move a muscle as he saw his father and mother being arrested and their wands snatched from their hands. He couldn’t do anything to stop the tears from keep rolling down his face as Potter’s friends started throwing healing spells at Harry’s wounds.
Hello, guys... sorry for not posting on time, it's a hard time right now as it is my last month of school and I have to work on a lot of stuff.... this isn't a true update but I promise it was going to be part of it... this happens the first night in their new room. Enjoy!
Draco crumbled into Harry’s arms as he sobbed uncontrollably, too hurt and shattered that he couldn’t talk for the time being. Harry’s hands trailed to his back, rubbing it comfortably as his sobs calmed and he wasn’t trembling so badly.
Draco looked at his face, so open and sincere as he said that, and felt how tears swelled up his eyes. He shook his head half in disbelief, half in an attempt to clear his eyes.
Draco woke up in the darkness. He couldn’t see anything, feel anything. He could only smell the stink of rot that was caused by humidity held sealed too much time. Draco, despite the blindness and the numbness that seized his body, knew where he was. The dungeons of the Malfoy Manor, so familiar he could feel the bars of the gate in front of him without even touching them. Familiar, yes. He could go with familiar, but never comfortable in there. He had gotten this familiar to the cells in the eternal periods he had spent down here, when his Master, his aunt or even his Father sent him in punishment for neglecting an order delivered to him. He didn’t disobey their orders often, though. However, when he did, the ones in his charge usually fared a worse destiny than it had been ordered before, just to make him suffer. He knew. Oh, his mother had tried to hide it from him, but he knew. He knew he had the fault of many deaths and the Dead would accompany him to the grave. And Draco was ok with that. He had accepted it, the pain of guilt threatening to overwhelm him every moment of his day. And night. But what was he doing here? He dreamed of dead people, (it was normal by now, almost like greeting old friends every night) but this? He had only dreamt of something alike once, and he trembled only to the memory of it. Could this be the same? He wished he could wake, that Harry woke him, that anyone saved him from the horrors to come…
Harry is grateful for Neville’s and Ginny’s added presence; their larger group manages to push through the yelling crowd of students with marginally more ease. At least, Harry enters the castle without anyone catching hold of his robes again.
do anything stupid,” Hermione adds in a hissing whisper. She gives one last significant look to the both of them before leaving.
Harry scans the head table as Ron complains about the delay in food (“We’ve seen six sortings already, do we really need to see another?”). Professor McGonagall—or Headmistress, rather—sits at the center of the table, her shrewd eyes watching the students file in. The rest of the faces are familiar: Slughorn, Trelawney, Flitwick, Merryweather, Hagrid. Hagrid is waving his huge palms animatedly as Flitwick attempts to keep his goblet out of range. Harry is filled with a sudden but staggering rush of warmth. Home. He’s
,” she murmurs. “Of course! She always writes her books under just initials, but I—I can’t believe I didn’t realize—”
he here? Where is he going on the first night of term if he isn’t in bed? Worth investigating, if you ask me.”
He pulls off his glasses and wipes a weary hand down his face. The brief comfort he had grasped during the Welcoming Feast is utterly gone. Perhaps it’s the lack of sleep or the lack of Ron waiting for him just outside the bathroom, but Harry suddenly feels lost. He can’t imagine the rest of the year playing out like this—coming back every day to Goyle, not Ron and Hermione, having to
, as Malfoy said). And he definitely can’t do as he pleases when he has no clue what would please him.
The night is so dark, Harry can’t see the forest before him. He can only sense its writhing presence in the blackness. He walks forward slowly, as if pulled by some inextricable string, his bare feet scraping over grass and dead leaves. Trees, giant and looming, take shape around him as he enters the teethed mouth of the Forbidden Forest.
“Good luck with Goyle,” Ron mutters before Harry can escape the bored gaze of Malfoy. “Wake me up if you need back-up.”
At first, Harry’s exhaustion was so deep in his bones, he didn’t have room for anything else. Days of repairing the castle, piecing together the Burrow, and helping track down Death Eaters left little to no room for thoughts, let alone dreams. The moment his head touched his pillow, a blank sleep would settle over him, and he would wake feeling like he’d been hit repeatedly by the Hogwarts train and then stomped on by a herd of hippogriffs. But he still slept uninterrupted.
“Now, I will read the assignments one by one, and then you will be led to your new dormitories. Michael Corner and Neville Longbottom…”
Harry leaves Ron to grapple with Malfoy and makes his way to Goyle. The east wing of the sixth floor is comprised of a long stretch of doorways, each engraved with a different creature. Harry’s and Goyle’s, upon closer inspection, is engraved with dozens of coiling and uncoiling snakes. He wonders if they would understand him if he spoke Parseltongue, and then is struck by the absurd hilarity of someone finding him alone in the hallway, speaking to his door. Maybe he really has gone round the bend.
Whoever had worked on the castle after the battle, after everyone had gone, must have worked non-stop. Harry, Hermione, and the Weasleys had helped in the first week, of course, just doing grunt work, clearing rubble and the like. But whoever had come after had the real challenge—every stone is replaced, every portrait salvaged, every outward scar of dark magic erased. The Great Hall sparkles with the honeyed glow of thousands of candles and the night stars wink brilliantly from the ceiling. The four long house tables catch the light, glowing warm and welcoming.
Malfoy is standing beside the door nearest the trio when they catch up; its mahogany frame shimmers with the carvings of minute owls, which fly and flit to and fro across the wood. Harry can tell at once that Malfoy has caught the end of their conversation. His eyes blaze with anger and something awful Harry can’t quite place; his jaw clenches, and he has drawn his shoulders up so high and tense that he looks like he would shatter on contact.
Downstairs, Hermione, Ginny, and Mr. Weasley sit at the kitchen table. Mr. Weasley has a muggle newspaper spread in front of him, his nose barely an inch from the ink. Mrs. Weasley fusses over a kettle that, rather than scream, has taken to pestering her in the wobbly voice of an elderly woman.
It doesn’t stop Hermione. “Malfoy was the only Death Eater, technically. And besides, Ron, we need to have some unity this year. Everything is so fragile. We can’t afford to hold mistakes against each other anymore.”
And the castle—the castle is almost exactly as he remembers it. The familiarity punches him in the gut, and for a moment, Harry feels like he’s walked into the past, straight into his first year.
around him. Having to walk the castle each day and battle through crowds of admiring fans. It all seems so pointless, and that frustrates him—the war is over, and for the first time in his entire life, free of the tyranny of the Durselys and Voldemort, Harry can do whatever he pleases.
Harry’s got his hand on his wand before he can register that it’s just Neville, looking muddy and a bit trampled. Ginny stands behind him, and even she looks a little worse for wear.
, more than anything, that had him firecalling the Weasleys’ house that night. To his surprise, it wasn’t Mrs. Weasley who answered after a few moments, but Hermione, hair frizzing and flying with the muss of sleep. She had taken one look at Harry’s shaking form and immediately flooed over to retrieve him.
Across the circle of eighth years, Malfoy’s face betrays only a hint of disgust. Harry wonders if he’s masking the full force of his discontent for McGonagall’s sake—trying to cover up for his slip earlier, appear more trustworthy.
“The great Harry Potter, all alone. Pathetic. What a pity, everyone who died for you—what a waste. And now there’s no one left, is there?
They stand and chat idly for a while, all valiantly trying to ignore the stream of young girls who approach Harry for an autograph. He finds himself signing paper after paper and even once a large poster of himself, although he looks just as bewildered and lost in the photograph as he’s sure he does amongst the crowd now. Ron catches one glimpse of the poster and has to turn his laugh into a choking, unconvincing cough. Harry glares at him.
“Slept better than me, then,” Ron says obliviously, even as Hermione shoots him a pointed look. “Couldn’t sleep with that ferret in the same room as me. He’s up to something, I can feel it. I mean, I don’t think he went to bed at all last night.”
Goyle has already snuffed out the lights when Harry returns, leaving the room pitched in just moonlight. His snores echo through the room; at least he snores like Ron. Harry stumbles through the darkness and into bed, cursing loudly when he stubs his toe on the end of the bed. Goyle shifts in his sleep, grunts, and then continues snoring.
They muddle through a few more moments of stilted conversation before Ginny excuses herself to go find Neville. She leaves quickly.
“Our letters have come,” she says. “Errol just brought them. He’s recuperating now, so don’t expect to send any letters out for at least a week.”
He draws closer and closer and Harry is repulsed, Harry wants to move, to run, but he can’t. He is frozen as Voldemort draws nearer and Harry doesn’t want it, doesn’t want to be touched, can’t stand to be touched, don’t touch, don’t touch, don’t touch—
“Where?” Hermione whips her head back around to the head table as if she will catch him popping out from behind Hagrid’s back.
It just never happened. That stasis had lulled Harry in, and the longer he took refuge in it, the less he wanted to disturb it. The less he wanted to kiss Ginny. The less he wanted to consider what being with her would be like.
carved into her arm and instantly feels guilty for his earlier thought; for her, the threat of sleeping beside a Slytherin carries a heavier weight.
“Thanks.” Neville shoots Hermione a grateful look before plopping down next to Harry. Ginny carefully sits across from him. “Does anyone know who else has come back? Eighth years, I mean.”
, Ronald, honestly. But I don’t see any new male professor here. I wonder if he’s changed his mind about the position. Oh, that would be just
Of the three of them, Hermione seems the most well-rested, though of course she almost always looks like that. Her unending energy is a marvel, really, as much as it can be irritating.
“Leave it, Ron,” Harry mutters, placing a hand on his shoulder. Ron steps back reluctantly but continues to glare.
“Would you mind if we join? The crowd out there is a bit nuts,” he says, looking from Ron to Hermione to Harry. Harry tries to surreptitiously remove his hand from his wand.
“You didn’t sleep at all, did you?” It asks him as he brushes his teeth. “No one ever listens to little old me.”
Harry thinks of how Professor Lai’s eyes had looked when they met his. So deep, so knowing. As if they had seen something in his eyes. Recognized something. Harry’s not sure he wants to know what it was.
Neville and Ginny immediately pick up the new subject, which carries them all the way to the castle and abates some of the growing darkness in Ron’s eyes.
McGonagall finishes the list and begins to lead them toward the east wing of the sixth floor, cutting off Harry’s view of Malfoy’s face. He tries not to feel frustrated by this. Ron trails in stunned silence beside Harry and Hermione. The trio falls behind the rest of the group, separating easily in the others’ distraction.
?” Ron demands. “Well, that knocks out the bloody competition, doesn’t it, mate?” He thumps Harry on the back.
At breakfast, he tries desperately not to fall asleep into his eggs and toast. He tries to remember to eat them, too, so Hermione won’t shoot him that fretful, knowing look in her dark brown eyes. Next to him, Ron tries to rant about Draco through mouthfuls of hash browns.
Harry pushes thoughts of Ginny and Hogwarts and the future aside. Instead, he drifts to the kitchen table, takes a seat in one wobbly, well-worn chair, and lets the tide of Ron and Hermione’s back and forth take over him again.
The good-byes are short when they come, although Mrs. Weasley is still tearful; no one is fond of saying good-bye anymore. They dance around the word, replacing it with
“Maybe it won’t be so bad,” Hermione says bracingly. She catches Ron’s look of disbelief. “I just mean…Malfoy has to live with you for the rest of the year. He knows he can’t afford any more disciplinary issues, not with his history. Maybe he’ll be more respectful now that you have to share a living space. If not for your sake, then for his own.”
“It’s no one’s fault, honestly.” She turns to Harry, brown eyes beseeching. “Really, Harry, these things happen in relationships. It’s all right if—if it’s not working out. Maybe…well, I was thinking…maybe some time for yourself isn’t such a bad thing?”
When Hermione and Harry squeeze through the front door of the Burrow, Ron and Ginny are still arguing.
“If you had been listening, Weasley, you would know. You need to place your hand on the door beside mine, or else the wards won’t admit you. Do you truly need me to explain first-year knowledge of wards to you?”
Tucked firmly in another distant corner of Harry’s mind: he and Ginny haven’t kissed again, haven’t even spoken about their kiss. The first few weeks after the Battle, he waited nervously for her to make a move, and he’s fairly sure she expected him to make one, too. But the War had only just ended, and the Burrow was still in shambles, and Fred had
“I still can’t believe they’re letting Death Eaters back into Hogwarts.” Ron’s brows crinkle in and his face begins to shift to an angry red. There’s a guardedness to his eyes that keeps Harry from disagreeing.
“Your parents may have neglected to teach you manners, Weasley, but surely you know you can simply walk around me,” he says smoothly.
They settle into Gryffindor table with Ron on Harry’s right and Neville on his left. Hermione sits on Ron’s other side and Ginny, again, keeps her distance from Harry.
Harry has to agree. He shrugs when Hermione shoots him a beseeching look. “Malfoy hasn’t changed, Hermione. We’ve barely been here two seconds and he’s already picked a fight.”
Ron looks indignant. “Why should I get the hand-me-down and you get the new one? How does that make any sense? I’ve been getting hand-me-downs for
, rather: Fred and Dumbledore and Lupin and so many others, cold and unmoving, never coming back. Harry wonders if there’s anyone who isn’t thinking about it.
“Thanks,” he mutters. He leaves quickly, before the mirror can make any more comments. He knows, unfortunately, what he looks like.
“I’ll fetch him, Mrs. Weasley,” Hermione says. She rises from the table and gives Harry’s shoulder a brief squeeze on her way out.
Goyle begins to strip out of his robes, pulling them roughly over his head without warning. Spotting this, Harry hastily slips into the small bathroom at the back of the room. He’s witnessed enough emotionally scarring things for one lifetime.
Other nights, he was entering the Forbidden Forrest again, except this time he was alone. Utterly alone in the ink blackness of the night. Voldemort’s high, cold laugh would pierce the air, but the flash of green light never came; instead, Voldemort’s icy fingers would lock onto Harry’s throat and dig into flesh, and Harry would die with no one close to him but Voldemort.
Mechanically, drawn by some irresistible string in his navel, Harry enters the clearing. As if sensing his arrival, the figure turns.
By the time Hermione returns down the stairs with a yawning Ron in tow, Mrs. Weasley has got the luggage and floo powder ready in the living room, and Harry has worked his way through a cup of tea and a slice of toast.
It doesn’t take long to notice that each pairing originates from different houses. Any lingering hopes Harry clung to of being paired with Ron, or even Neville, disintegrate. Hermione seems to have noticed as well, dread growing on her expression with each passing second. Rather vindictively, Harry thinks, he wonders where all of her inter-house unity has gone now.
“Right,” Harry mutters. He can’t find it in himself to argue, no matter Hermione’s reproving expression, when he’s not sure he that he does disagree. Yes, Malfoy was young when he had made his mistakes, as Hermione said, but wasn’t Harry young then, too? And he had never become a Death Eater. Never caused so much pain and suffering and death. Never got to be so selfish.
“Mistakes? They’ve made some bloody big mistakes, Hermione!” Ron’s fists clench at his sides. Harry wonders if he’s thinking about what those mistakes cost, or
Harry’s mind starts to fuzz over as Hermione catches that thread and begins to rave about whatever book it is. Apparently, she’s read the author’s work before, agrees with his theoretical framework—with some reservations, of course, but isn’t that what good academic discourse is about?—and he loses her somewhere in the jargon. But there’s a warm, calming tide to the waves of her speech; her voice, intonations, crisp and tumbling sentences are familiar and comforting. The Weaselys’ garden, overflowing with vegetables and wildflowers and grubby gnomes, is comforting. The sloped outline of the Burrow ahead of them is comforting. The faint shout of Ron and Ginny arguing and Mrs. Weasley chiding spills out onto the lawn, and that, too, is comforting.
“I presume you two are not having issues this early in the term, boys.” She looks down her nose severely at them.
“I mean he wasn’t there when I got out of the bathroom and went to bed, and I kept waking up in the middle of the night, you know, in case he was out to kill me. Kept expecting his wand at my throat, the slimy bastard. But he was never there; his bed was empty every time. And when I woke up this morning, it was still empty. Perfectly made and everything. I reckon he was wandering the castle, trying to break into Harry’s room and finish him off.”
“Right.” Harry wishes he cared more. Like he used to. Wishes he could borrow some of Ron’s endless enthusiasm.
“Maybe they’ve hired two new professors,” Hermione says doubtfully, her eyes scanning the table. Her brow furrows. “But where’s—”
He gasps awake, hands flying to his throat. His gasps rattle through the quiet of the dormitory and the feeling of breathlessness, of a heavy weight upon his chest, lingers. His heart races wildly in his chest.
“Gotta put our hands on the door,” Goyle says gruffly. He evidently has nothing more to add; he won’t even make eye contact. He and Harry place their hands on the door, and Harry feels the familiar tingle of a ward washing over them. Its magic chases a shiver down his spine, and he gets the unpleasant sensation of his magic mingling with Goyle’s. He’s not sure he wants his anything mingling with the broad Slytherin. The door opens with a click, and Goyle lumbers into the room with a grunt.
Harry can’t help but agree, although he’s thankful it isn’t Malfoy or Zabini. Goyle, while still massively unpleasant, doesn’t have the acerbic wit or pointed hostility of the rest of his house. Still, the relief doesn’t outweigh the disappointment of being separated from Ron, or the worry about what will happen if—
If you ask Harry, too. He knows he’s supposed to be trying for peace, for Dumbledore and McGonagall’s and his parents' sake, supposed to be putting the past aside and not obsessing over Malfoy again. But he was never obsessed over
Harry keeps his eyes trained on the eggs, grown rubbery and cold in his neglect, so he can pretend she didn’t direct that last part toward him. “Besides, it was dark—maybe he was in his bed the whole time and you didn’t see. Maybe you dreamt the whole thing. And honestly, Ron, just because
Through the curtained window, gray light trickles in. The sun has clearly risen, and Harry decides that sleep will not come again this morning. There’s no use staying in bed.
“Where’s your new boyfriend, Hermione? You know, the bloke who’s book you sleep with under your pillow?”
“Ever the hero, aren’t we, Potter?” Malfoy’s expression has twisted into one of bitter disdain. “Pity the War’s over and there’s no one left to sacrifice yourself for.”
cauldron.”).  Even Mrs. Weasley seems a bit lost to be early for once. It’s a sudden reminder that what once was a horde of late, forgetful children is now whittled down to just the four of them. No one seems to know quite what to do.
“A good number of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. Us, of course. Malfoy, Zabini, Goyle.” Hermione adds the final few names in a rush. If she was hoping Ron wouldn’t notice, it didn’t work.
Two four-post beds lie on either side of the room, one to the left of a large, iron-framed widow and the other shrouded in shadows across from it. Goyle heads immediately toward the darker bed and begins digging through his trunk. Upon second glance, Harry notices his own trunk sitting beside the window bed.
Hermione fights valiantly against the press of the crowd once again. If the way the first-year girls glare at her is anything to go on, she’s not gaining many fans by doing so. They’ve only just clambered into the carriage, Harry having wrestled his robes from the clutch of a particularly crazed second year, when the door suddenly swings open again.
Draco continued to put his things in order as he waited for Harry to return, his mood better than it was at lunch.
“You two realize that administering any kind of “medicine” or any other potion without the required license is a crime, don’t you?”
“Well, it’s true it was hard, but if you tell him slowly what you want him to do sometimes he understands you. I can lend you a dog training manual if you want to.” Harry flipped him off, his mouth too stuffed for him to talk.
Draco let out a bitter chuckle. “Don’t worry about it, Potter? Seriously, that’s the best advice you can give? I can’t stop
“Yeah… you guys better get going, we’ll catch up with you in Slughorn’s.” Hermione motioned them to move and Draco obliged, walking fast to reach Harry.
“Malfoy? Malfoy? Draco?” Harry was waving his hand in front of Draco’s face, worried after a minute without response. Draco seemed to snap back to reality when Harry called him by his name.
“Yes, ma’am. Sorry.” Harry saw the anger in the nurse’s eyes disappear, replaced by concerned understanding.
istg i intended to update this sooner and the half chapter has been sitting on my laptop for at least four months
) and the background swiftly changed to resemble their room. Draco could still tell this was a dream, for there were little incongruences in the room, as the sky being crystal clear with two suns and the beds lacking their canopies.
“It is a poison, named Licroatan because of its creator, a wizard who gave it to his own son to test it. It is known not only for the slow development of signs of illness but also for the peculiar symptoms it gives to the victim, who first notes a stomach ache which guides him to the wrong conclusion of a normal infection, though after three days of the poison making effect the victim will show a fast deterioration of nails and teeth and in this phase any treatment is useless and the victim will die in the fourth day of poisoning.”
“Oh, seems like the snake is finally awake!” Draco heard a sneering voice approaching and realized that making himself known might not have been such a good idea.
“What?” Harry turned to look at Draco for some sign of joke, but his face was dead serious. At least until two seconds after, when he couldn’t resist and burst laughing.
“A potion is not only the most difficult part, it’s all the parts, and you made the disgusting part of it.”
Which was bad, because he now had time to notice the little details of the moment, like how he and Potter were the only ones outdoors and the way the sun put flashes of blue in Potter’s dark hair or how if Potter looked at him the sun reflected in his eyes making them almost luminescent themselves and the way fucking Potter swallowed was so fucking sexy and he wanted to bite his Adam’s apple and how the way Potter nibbled at his food was such a turn on and he was having another attack but this one was different because it felt so good, so good to be here with Potter and just pretend the rest of the world didn’t exist, at least for a while.
Draco was sitting in the bathtub, water up to his lips, eyes unfocused. He snapped out of his daze, realizing that the water had gone lukewarm and heating it again with a quick spell.
The heads of every soul in the room turned to see the focus of the ruckus and saw what they never had thought possible: the Chosen One whining as the Death Eater dragged him into the class, though the last showed a hint of a smile, which was soon replaced by a scowl when he noticed the attention he was the centre of.
“Shut up, Draco… And you can’t really talk about girly hair, can you? All that pretty silver mane you have been growing… Maybe I should start calling you Drakesha!” Harry had been laughing before and Draco’s face of horror only made him cackle as the taller boy dead stopped in the middle of the hallway.
“The poor snake, he doesn’t look quite fine, does he, Hilda?” The leader addressed the other girl, motioning to come closer.
Harry shot him an amused look at the evidence that Draco had been watching him before and let out a grave chuckle. Draco looked down embarrassed, a slight pink painting his cheeks.
They opened the doors with a smile in their faces, though it didn’t last long on Draco’s as he rapidly scanned the room for any empty space. Harry saw the worry take over Draco’s features and started moving towards where he had seen Ron and Hermione.
Draco kept watching him as he laid his clothes on his untouched bed. When Harry motioned to unwrap the towel without complaints of Draco’s presence Draco turned his head away so fast that his neck snapped. With his face burning red and his back facing Harry, he started talking in an attempt to distract himself from the fact that his roommate was practically nude (
Draco shook his head, unable to look up and see what he intuited in Harry’s eyes as he felt his own eyes sting with tears barely contained.
“Well I don’t know, have there been scones other days before? I have never noticed what’s for breakfast.” Draco shot a cautious look over his shoulder and having checked it was safe he turned around.
“You little…” Draco started as he good-humouredly punched Harry in one shoulder, continuing to fake fight until they reached the doors of the Great Hall, where they took a breath while checking their clothes for any sign of disarray.
Harry was blushing as he put Draco’s arm around his neck, trying to avoid looking down. “Draco, come out, I’m gonna get you in bed.”
“Look. I appreciate that you think it’s unfair, but the only thing you’ll do is to make things worse for me because he’ll think I tattletale and everyone hates a tattletale, ok?”
“We can’t have our guest feeling unwell, right, Maggie?” Hilda made an exaggerated compassion expression, harshly pinching Draco’s cheeks in a mocking gesture. “I bet he will feel better after we give him some medicine, don’t you think?”
Harry noticed the pain in Draco’s eyes and with eyes dark from barely contained fury said “I won’t forget this, Draco. I may let it pass for now, but I’ll remember.” Then his eyes turned the green of the grass, of the hope Draco wanted so desperately to have. “Let’s get done with this, shall we?”
Between the shock of being casted with Potter, his undignified escape from the Great Hall and the wondrous nightmare he had had last night, Draco wasn’t so happy when he woke to the banging Harry made in his morning ritual.
As he strode through the empty hallways he tried to maintain his anxiety under control, to avoid looking like prey. When he reached the Great Hall he discovered a human form leaning on the doorframe. He automatically put up his shields and walls, only to drop them as he recognized the figure as fucking Potter.
Two steps more. Draco knew he had to erase any thought away of his mind or the Dark Lord would be able to see it.
Draco sat at his usual spot at the far end of the table and pretended to rummage in his bag as he saw Weasley and Granger approaching their table.
“Hi.” Draco said under his breath, noting that he was still too close to Harry, not having moved since he touched his lips.
Harry woke up surrounded by sunlight. He blinked placidly a couple of times before noticing the foreign weight on his left arm. He turned and saw
This time, though, Draco didn’t say hi, he just watched him, smiling until Harry removed his hand from Draco’s face. Then Slughorn gave orders for everyone to sit again as he was going to announce the grades from their Licroatans potions.
). Draco saw as Weasley shot Harry a filthy look as he guided a hurt-looking Granger to their own table.
Harry groaned as he stood, his five feet eight looking less in contrast to Draco’s six feet two. He didn’t stop complaining all their way to Potion class, even after Draco threatened to leave him on his own with Potions work.
When he got there, however, he noticed slight changes in the room that meant that the silver haired boy he had feared and missed in his way was in there.
“Anyways, I’ll say it again, so listen. I’m sorry for what I did. But I do care and want to help, so tell me how?”
Now he would have to take a shower. He stood, flushing away the bath and with it any thoughts of what couldn’t be. He opened the faucet, punishing himself with a cold shower for his stupidity.
“Lots to do before we leave today, dear,” Mrs. Weasley says as she floats tea onto the table. “You can all sleep on the train ride there. Was Ron on his way down?”
When he leaves, Goyle is just rolling out of bed. He doesn’t seem the sharpest in the morning, although that isn’t saying much—he merely grunts when he sees Harry, and Harry isn’t sure he’s truly absorbed who he’s grunting at.
Sometimes Sirius was alive again and Harry was chasing him through the ministry, hearing his footsteps but never seeing him, knowing with certainty that he would die again, always just seconds behind. Other times, he was frozen as Dumbledore pitched off the sharp edge of the Astronomy tower, just outside of Harry’s reach. Or he was watching his mother, his father, Lupin, Tonks, Fred dying repeatedly and in increasingly horrifying ways. Sometimes, even Ron or Hermione or Luna or Neville bled out in his dreams as Harry watched helplessly, tried to run to them through sleep-viscous air that left him feeling breathless and immobilized.
And then the first nightmare came. And then the next. And then the next, and the next, over and over again, like a highlight reel of all of Harry’s worst moments and fears.
The crease between Hermione’s brows relaxes. “Oh, you won’t believe who they’ve hired as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor this year. He’s incredibly distinguished—he wrote the book I was telling you about the other day…”
“Well, it was still perfectly awful of me to assume,” Hermione insists weakly, but her face has mostly returned to its normal shade of brown. “I wonder why she’s chosen to take such a public position, now of all times.”
Hermione visibly struggles for words. “I’m not saying they haven’t,” she finally says. “But I’ve been—I’ve been thinking this summer. When…when I was in Australia. And we were all so
“How is Luna?” Harry latches hastily onto the change in subject matter. Truthfully, he knows how Luna is—she’s been owling him regularly from her travels through the wizarding region of Nepal. He’s not sure what prompted her to keep him in the loop about her searches for gravity-resistant tigers, but he’s quietly grateful for the kind, if batty, human contact she’s offered.
He wrestles with the gray quilt of the bed, desperate to untangle himself. He wrenches the bed curtains open, stumbles from bed, and then freezes only several steps away as it all comes back to him—Hogwarts, the gray room, Goyle. He steadies himself on the bedside table and tries to quiet his ragged breaths. Goyle’s snores remain blessedly steady.
“Merlin help us if Skeeter starts writing articles again. You think it’s a bloody mess now? Wait until those girls find out Harry’s single—” Ron cuts himself off abruptly as he catches Hermione’s sharp glance. A silence as thick as bubotuber pus settles over them.
Harry tried sleeping in Grimmauld Place just once. He figured that it was his, the first and only house he had ever owned—and more importantly, it was once Sirius’, no matter how much Sirius had hated it. He ought to at least try living there.
“Well?” she presses. “Any broken hearts you’ve abandoned in the name of education, Harry? Don’t be shy.”
She takes a moment to stare their upset titters into silence. Beside Harry, Ron has a look of impending doom on his face, and even Hermione pales. Harry feels strangely detached. His anger at Malfoy has already retreated from the surface, leaving only a peculiar layer of numbness. There goes his shot at a comfortable return to the plush couches of the Gryffindor common room and reassuring snores of Ron.
As if drawn by the magnetism of this last thought, Harry’s eyes travel across the Great Hall and catch on Malfoy’s shocking blond hair. The white strands dimple in the sunlight, and in the depths of his numb exhaustion, Harry feels something spark to life
Harry wishes they hadn’t been so early. More and more people continue to throng in—hordes of eager first-years gawping at him from around their parents, clumps of upper-years growing hushed and awed as he walks by, and—to his great distress—several flashes of cameras burning his retinas. The growing crowd silences and parts for his group as they walk, and urgent whispers commence the second he passes. It almost reminds him of his second year, when everyone thought he was the heir of Slytherin, except this time it is pure and unadulterated worship, not suspicion, and this time is a thousand times worse. The knot in his chest tightens painfully in the press of the crowd, and he trains his eyes on the graying fire of Mrs. Weasley’s hair.
When they arrive, the skies have darkened completely with night, but the rain has slowed to just spitting. They wait until the last minute to exit the train car in the hopes that the crowd of eager students will have dissipated. It works, sort of, but the second they step off the train, the gaggles of students walking toward the carriages seem to automatically swivel toward them. Harry is unnerved by how in sync their turns are.
“I’m sure he will.” Hermione blushes. “I mean—stability is more important than ever. I’m sure Professor McGonagall will prioritize it over everything else.”
As the train trundles onward, rain begins to spatter at the windows. The skies coalesce dark and angry as water gathers on the glass. It reminds Harry of the train ride his third year, of the dementors and Lupin and his mother’s screams. He wonders what he would feel like now if Dementors were to swoop in. If those same screams would return, or if, like his nightmares, new screams would join the rotation. He hopes he’ll never have to find out.
The room is carefully devoid of house colors, despite the Slytherin-esque snakes on the door. A stormy gray peaks out from behind dozens upon dozens of framed landscape images. Harry makes out a blue-toned painting of a coastal town and what looks like a black and white illustration of a lopsided mushroom. He doesn’t see any portraits, thankfully; at least the room can remain somewhat of a respite from watching eyes. Somehow, he doesn’t think Goyle will ask for an autograph any time soon. He’d probably rather snog the Giant Squid.
“Honestly, Ron, you have to stop accusing Draco of being up to something. You heard Professor McGonagall, and she’s right—we need to be united this year. No more house rivalry. No more stalking Malfoy.”
There’s a stasis here that Harry has sat in all summer. The same routine—repairing the Burrow, tending to the garden, peeling potatoes under Mrs. Weasley’s watchful eye. Quidditch with Ron and Ginny. Sitting by the fire with Hermione and Ron into early morning hours. Sometimes, in the rhythm and loudness and sweat of it all, Harry can almost stop thinking and convince himself that everything is normal.
