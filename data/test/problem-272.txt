"She seemed more sad than anything. Though I think seeing Scorpius play with her toys cheered her up a bit."
Draco
With nothing else to do, and a few hours to kill, they sat down to watch the TV that Scorpius had purchased over the weekend. It seemed Scorpius had introduced Draco to his favourite crime dramas, and Harry couldn’t help imagining a future in which the three of them sat down to watch TV together. He spared a moment to feel angry that his family had been robbed of such experiences for the past 15 years, though it was immediately replaced by the guilt from the previous night, from knowing he hadn’t fought for Draco.
I'm about to trip in the middle of a dance. Oh Merlin, you're going to want me to dance, aren't you?
“I don’t want to talk about him anymore. I hate him.”
“It’s very involved magic! Figuring it out the first time was a nightmare so forgive me if the last thing on my mind was collecting a magical signature. Anyway, the Auror team should have collected one from the house.”
“Um, it was interesting,” Harry offered uncertainly. He couldn’t quite tell if Draco was mocking him.
After closing the shop, the two of them would make their way back to the house, where invariably some relative or family friend would be visiting. For some odd reason, they all seemed thrilled to meet Harry. He would usually spend the afternoon with them, Camilla stepping in to translate. When he noticed her mother slipping away to prepare dinner, he would usually follow, opting to watch her cook and hoping he could pick up some recipes. She seemed delighted to teach him—apparently Camilla wasn't a huge fan of cooking, but her mum had always wanted to pass on her recipes. Of course, Camilla ended up learning everything he learned anyway, simply because she had to explain whatever her mother was lecturing them about.
“Well, then. There you have it. Anyway, the
would spend more time working with potions than with paperwork,” he grumbled.
McGonagall considered him. “As of this moment, I’m the only non-Unspeakable who knows about the monitoring program, correct?”
have fought for him, even if it ended up being fruitless. I should have trusted him, and tried to figure out what had happened, instead of jumping to conclusions like everyone else. He was my husband—I shouldn’t have let him go so easily.”
“All those in favour of removing the charge of attempted terrorism from Mr. Malfoy’s record?”
“It’s like watching a play,” Harry tried. Draco snorted.
He assumed Draco was in the bedroom again. He thought about calling out for him, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to say his name. Merlin, he was being a coward. His eyes strayed to the fridge as he wondered if he could simply heat up the casserole and leave. Was he really that scared of his ex-husband?
“You think I’m being overbearing?” Scorpius demanded. “You’re out of line, Dad! After years of wondering where my father was, what went wrong, and why he was taken away from me with
“Curiosity always leads to trouble,” she said easily. “You’ve always been fascinated by Draco. You used to follow him around at school, remember?”
“I’d rather not talk about it in the lobby. Maybe we could go to your office?” Harry suggested.
Harry looked pointedly at her colleague at the far end of the counter, who was handing another client a tray with chips on it, but she remained silent.
"Good. Keep that bottle, it has a cooling charm on it. Just refill it when you need it. Do not accept water from les moldus, it is not always purified. Foreigners like you get sick like that."
"I made," she said, pointing at the box. His eyes widened in surprise.
"Very much," he said shyly.
? You’re the perfect volunteer sir, because today, I’ll need both of you to act out our dragons! Please, come over here and pick your dragon wings.”
Scorpius was technically right—Harry had gotten the idea from his stay in Hassan’s house months prior—and so Harry simply sighed and conceded the point.
“Yes, that was a happy story. And it showed us something about the mating habits of dragons. Dragons believe in their one true love, and they won’t mate with anyone else. Some dragons will spend their whole life looking for their one true love, and won’t find them until they’re very old, but when they do find each other, they’re finally very happy. Dragonologists have spent decades studying how dragons know who their true love is, and humans have spent centuries trying to recreate that magic, either by creating soul matching bonds or love potions.”
“That’s a brilliant idea, Scorpius. Maybe I should see if there are any dragons in America?”
"Oh, of course, yes. Come in."
If Harry was being honest, imagining having Draco home was a big part of the reason he hadn’t slept much the night before.
Harry continued to dwell on his fears as the afternoon wore on. They visited the rest of the museum after an “eat-like-a-dragon!” buffet lunch, and before long Scorpius was complaining that his feet hurt, so they piled into a taxi to head back to the hotel.
Luckily Draco seemed to have a lot more tact than Harry, and picked up on what was happening right away. He stepped forward, accepting the hug for a moment, before turning once again toward the door.
Scorpius stared at Harry, clearly stunned at this revelation. Behind him, Draco’s secretary chuckled under her breath.
Draco nodded, uncertain of how he should proceed. Before he could decide, Harry spoke again.
“I’ll admit, I thought you did potions too,” Harry said casually. “You took me past the Potions and Plant Poisoning ward last week.”
“Well, look who decided to join me,” Draco drawled, earning another set of giggles from Scorpius. “And right on time too. Look what I think I just found.”
Agent Phi nodded. “We looked into your lead. Guy named Warren Selpie, used to be the head of CRUP, but got demoted to policy assistant for the Pest Advisory Bureau. I brought him in for questioning, and everything fits. He was hoping that placing creatures in high-profile houses would make his division relevant again, and stop the budget cut. He picked the houses he did because the people who lived there were either directly or indirectly responsible for the budget cuts, so in a way it was revenge as well.”
“I’ll ask around,” Teddy offered. “And once you make it an official case, give the potions analysis to me, so that I can make sure no one messes it up.”
He opened his mouth to argue, but at that moment his foot landed in the grate and he was swept into the flames. He emerged in the hotel lobby, coughing up a mouthful of ash. Thankfully, there was no one around to see his less than dignified entrance, but as he made his way upstairs and bid John goodnight, he couldn’t help thinking that his aunt really was a rather clever woman.
“Did I ever play little league?” Scorpius asked, suddenly remembering his thoughts from earlier that afternoon. He’d been a reserve chaser at Hogwarts, but he still couldn’t remember playing before then. He looked up at his dad, who had a sad look on his face.
The host nodded, and gestured for the group to follow them.
“You needed someone you could trust...so you came looking for
“He used to brew illegal polyjuice potion before you were born. He couldn’t get a job after the war, but he needed to make money somehow. He gave it all up though, to keep you safe. Finally got a job in a shop, and when you both moved in with me, I promised him he’d never have to work a day in his life if that was what he wanted, that I’d keep both of you safe and happy. He still kept working—I think he liked to be able to contribute
“I refuse to eat another broccoli casserole,” Harry declared, opening the container and pouring the contents into a large pot. Harry’s suspicion had originally been that Scorpius was asking him to come help Draco as a ruse to get them to spend time with each other. While he still hadn’t ruled it out entirely, he was at least certain that Scorpius was extremely busy at work. Draco had told him last time that Scorpius often came home late and exhausted, and every time Harry had come over, the same broccoli casserole had been sitting in the fridge, waiting for Harry to season it. The last time he’d come over, even Draco, who was so careful about his diet, had begged for a bit of cheese and a sprinkling of parsley on his plate.
And that was when inspiration struck.
Scorpius’ visit to the archives had been uneventful that first day, aside from bringing back a lot of memories as he sifted through the personal possessions his papa had had on him when he was arrested. Scorpius had been especially surprised to find that his wand felt very comfortable, almost as if it were his own. He’d heard of children who were incredibly compatible with their parents’ magic and therefore able to use hand-me down wands, but he’d never quite believed it was possible until now. His maternal grandparents had mailed over his mother’s wand when he’d turned eleven, but it hadn’t felt quite right, and his dad had simply taken him to get a new one.
“I’ve been dating him as a way to keep an eye on him. He kept sneaking around, trying to uncover my work. I figured courting him would be a good way to keep him away from my work and to control how much information he had. But recently, it’s become more and more obvious that he’s no longer suspicious of me. He’s dating me because
Draco nodded, trying and failing to cover another yawn. He still looked a little worried, and Harry could tell he was still thinking about their son.
, the Strategic Director at Gringotts Bank, and even the Chair of the National Quidditch League—all of them were Unspeakable spies who kept an eye on the major institutions of the wizarding world and handled any major problems that arose. He knew that Harry, who had built a career in ethics review, would never approve of such a system. It was a little discouraging, but Draco was a professional who had a case to manage.
“You look like shit,” Scorpius said as a greeting. Teddy looked up at him, mouth comically full of Pepper Imps.
Draco was inching toward the kitchen, leaning against the wall as he walked painfully slowly. Harry wasn’t sure if he should go over and help him. It was no wonder Scorpius had wanted someone to check in during the day—Draco looked like the tiniest wind would blow him over.
“Professor. Punctual as ever,” he said with a smile, taking his seat opposite her.
Once Scorpius had declared his dragon “complete”, the attendant returned with a little bronze plaque, charming his name and the date on it, before levitating the dragon into the display case full of hundreds of other misshapen dragons. Scorpius was admiring it proudly when a wizard in long purple robes swept into the room.
“My, how clever! That’s wonderful advice, son, thank you for that!”
Scorpius shook his head. “No, I’m quite sure we haven’t. My name is Scorpius Greengrass. But you may have known my birth parents, Draco and Astoria Malfoy.”
"Excuse me. Is there any way for the children to assemble the skeletons without digging in the sand? Scorpius here isn't comfortable in the sand."
“It’s a matter of patient confidentiality. If you didn’t insist on meeting outside of the castle, our conversation could have been much more secure,” he pointed out.
Harry watched, dumbfounded, as Malfoy rushed away towards a group of Aurors herding a cow with a horn down the hall. Why had Malfoy just asked him out? And more importantly, why had Harry agreed?
"Harree," Camilla asked cautiously. "You say table for four?"
“I can’t think of any kind of connection between him and the other two either,” Harry mused. “Unless it was revenge for something, like with the Wizengamot member’s daughter?”
Scorpius suddenly realised that Teddy was talking about his mother and father. Had they been good at Quidditch? Scorpius knew so little about them, it hadn’t ever occurred to him to wonder about normal things like their hobbies.
Scorpius looked defiantly at Smith as he said all this, who was now starting to cotton on to the fact that Scorpius wasn’t awed by him.
“Merlin, Harry thinks he’s subtle, huh?”
“Well they’d realised she was missing by the time we got there. I took charge handling the Hippogriff since I have experience from dealing with Buckbeak, and everyone else spread out to look for the girl. The Hippogriff didn’t bow back, however, and just went over to the mantle and started pecking at all the pictures of the girl. It didn’t take long to put two and two together.”
“I take
"I'm not in a rush," Harry shrugged. "Are you?" he asked Bryan.
“You would have made a terrible Auror,” Penelope pointed out.
“Bye Harry,” he called over his shoulder, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
Scorpius nodded. “Good idea. I’ll call Dad to let him know. Thanks for this, Teddy.”
“I can make incredible books for children, Theo,” he spat. “I—”
“Well then,
“I will. Harassing an Auror is a serious offence,” she said pointedly. “Also, I didn’t realise Merle has spattergroit. Is she okay?”
Draco didn't want to leave his bed the next morning, knowing it would be the last time he slept in it. He knew Harry had said he could stay as long as he wanted, but he didn't want to be here without him. Draco knew that as soon as he spent a night here without his host, he'd never want to go back to his own place.
“I... what? How did you know about that?
“No. In fact, I’ve been lying to you too.”
“Sorry I banged on your door,” Scorpius said to him, much more sedate now.
“Don’t let me finish all of this,” Malfoy said, indicating the dessert that Harry had yet to try. “And hospital staff tend to know more than people think. The Aurors usually interview patients while they’re still in the hospital—we overhear things. We just don’t tell the world because we’re good at maintaining patient confidentiality.”
"We married," she sobbed, when he sat down next to her. "You don't leave me."
So my proposition is this: come with me to the Gala next weekend. It's the biggest event of the year and I’m supposed to be meeting with a new director while there. It won’t do for me to go alone and having you on my arm may benefit us both. We let the press think we’re dating and all the scrutiny in the press will fall on us when we’re together. That means no more speculations over lunch meetings or outings with friends and it means we can both quietly attempt to date without the papers blowing things up before they’ve had a proper chance to start.
"I'm not. It's just... that's a lot of trust to put in a man they barely know."
“I… no. Um, I got the money from Harry.”
Harry shook his head. "I didn't get too close to them, but someone I met there said she got to meet them once." His heart twinged a little bit as he remembered Camilla's story about seeing a reindeer in the forest once, when she'd gone camping with her Pappa.
“We’ve known each other since Hogwarts,” Draco pointed out. “Well, actually, we met once before that, at Madam Malkin’s, but neither of us knew who the other was at that point.”
The prayer didn't last long, though Harry was hyper aware of the fact that Camilla continued to hold his hand in front of the entire church. Finally the priest (was that what they called it?) touched both their heads (probably in some kind of blessing) and announced something to the church at large, which made everyone cheer. Deciding that it must be some kind of welcome, since no one else had come forward for the prayer, Harry smiled at all of them, feeling loved and warm.
the next day. I've even started trying to wear disguises when I go out nowadays. I'm very familiar with a decoy mustache, but your idea of a decoy date is intriguing. I must say, I very much like the idea of this
“Yeah, of course. Please don’t work yourself too hard, and remember to take breaks.”
“My mother was a strong woman,” Draco said softly. “I guess she just wasn’t strong enough.”
Harry nodded, blushing furiously.
“The two of you must have been dating longer than I thought if he’s paying for your education. I’m surprised it took this long for everyone to find out. Though I imagine he’ll miss you if you’re in France for the next two years.”
Draco nodded. He took another sip of his wine, hoping against hope that she wouldn’t ask how. That hope was dashed within seconds.
"Yeah, her family runs a toy shop. I actually bought Scorpius' reindeer from her. That's how we met."
“That’s my mail, thank you,” Agent Delta said pointedly, Summoning the note.
“That’s sweet of you, Harry, but I wouldn’t wish that on you. Scorpius, bless him, can be a handful, and since I don’t know how long I’ll be gone, it’ll probably be better for someone who really knows him to stay with him.”
“I… I’m not a Healer. Not a real one, anyway.”
Malfoy contemplated Harry as the server set the crême brulée on the table and offered them both spoons.
Draco gave an exaggerated sigh. “Fine, if you really don’t know how it works. Will you have dinner with me this Friday? 6PM, at the
"Scorpius, you can't just invite yourself over to people's houses! I'm sure Harry will want to decorate in his own style."
“Draco, that’s amazing,” Pansy said, handing the letter back. “It doesn’t give us a lot of time for goodbyes, though, if you start in two days.”
"Whe—where are you going?" he managed to stutter out. Draco kneeled next to his son, rubbing his back in an attempt to calm him down a bit.
Harry nodded, trying to focus his attention back on the conversation. Of course he liked helping people.
Harry reached out, closed the door and pressed a few buttons. The microwave whirred to life, and Draco watched in fascination as the table started turning.
“Down—you mean your genitals?”
“That worked out perfectly,” Harry exclaimed. “When do you start?”
“She didn’t even give you a spoon. And most places serve soup with a roll, or some croutons on it, don’t they?”
“Harry! Why did you stop moving the boat?” Scorpius whined. He was sitting on top of a large float which Harry had been towing around, pretending he was the captain of a ship.
He’d have Stibbons fired for this—the incompetent troll had somehow messed up countless parts of the body when Transfiguring the patient back into a human. The Diagnostic Spells kept coming back inconclusive, so here Draco was, systematically casting Projection Spells on every single body part he could think of with multiple anatomy textbooks lying all over at three o’clock in the morning. His patient had already gone blue in the face from not being able to breath since there had been so few alveoli in her lungs, and then suffered sepsis because she had no glomeruli.
“I really hope so,” Scorpius sighed. “When they say you can’t imagine the horrors of Azkaban until you’re there, they mean it. Even with Patronuses, it’s awful.”
“Really? Where are you going this time, Harry?” Scorpius piped up, clearly excited to see them emerge.
“Oh, um, you don’t have to,” Draco said quickly. “I only thought… but I mean… if you have somewhere else to be, you don’t…”
"Oh, that's a good one," he chuckled, helping himself to yet another chocolate. "Accidentally got married. Hah!"
"Hi. I have a reservation for Potter, but we have two extra guests. Is it possible to get a table for four instead?"
"I dunno. I just never thought I had a chance with you," Bryan sighed. "Good to know I was wrong."
, then glanced at Harry’s barely-eaten sandwich. Draco’s bowl was empty.
“Oh.” Harry had been hoping that the blank pages meant Malfoy was available, but it seemed he was out of luck. “Could you ask him?”
“They’re fine,” Linda said, sitting down with an equally large plate of dessert. “They recuperate their profits from wimps like you who barely eat anything.”
“It won’t work,” Agent Eta said sadly, as if they knew exactly what Agent Delta was thinking. “You don’t like lying. Your guilt will eat away at your relationship. Either that, or he’ll compromise you. It’s a recipe for disaster.”
So does that mean that the chosen one is ill? Delbert Elderberry, 34th seat in the Wizengamot and representative of North Lancashire, thinks so. "The poor boy's been through so much. Losing his parents at a young age, then fighting you-know-who in some rather legendary battles, and finally building such a large empire of companies so quickly. I'm sure it's all gone to his head. It must be the stress, or the trauma of it all. We've seen it in the courts; victims of great tragedies like that start to believe some weird things. I definitely think he could benefit from regular visits to a mind healer."
“Are you sure you want to? You’re coughing a lot!”
“I know,” Harry said quickly. “He hates sand, and he refuses to eat if different foods on his plate are touching each other. But those are part of what makes him unique, and I honestly love him for that.”
"I brought you a present," he said excitedly, pulling the hastily wrapped spoon from his bag. She accepted it curiously, turning it over in her hands before carefully peeling back the wrapping paper. She stared at it in shock for a moment, before carefully looking back up at Harry.
“But you’re not going to come anymore, are you? You’re going to go home with that posh lawyer and his adorable kid.”
to commit the crime of the century, and he hadn’t even known until after the fact. What if Draco hadn’t changed the potion, or hadn’t done it correctly? What if the killer had gotten away with it? Would there have been another war? Would the kids have been in danger?
“Teddy was right. I haven’t ever really gotten over it. But I need to move on. And so do you.”
If not, do not worry. I’ll be fine. I saw you chatting up that Tom bloke last night. He seems
He sat down on his bed, considering his options. He didn't really want to leave the small village, and his new friend behind. But the point of travelling was to see and experience new things, wasn't it?
Either way, if you find need for it, I hope you enjoy the hangover potion. It’s my own variant, not that store bought sludge.
“Yes, please do. Have a safe trip, Harry.”
“You could always come back, you know. After he goes to sleep,” Harry said, hoping he didn’t sound too desperate. Draco looked surprised for a moment, but then a lazy grin spread across his face.
“And why do you care anyway?” Scorpius cried, clearly having found a second wind. “You spent 15 years not caring about Papa. You didn’t give a shit that he was sitting in Azkaban, scared, and alone, and
She nodded again, pointing to the desk near the bookshelf.
“I resigned instead. Congratulations, you two are partners now. Though I’m sure they’ll split you both up as soon as they hire my replacement—married couples never do well as work partners.”
He bit his tongue as the awkwardness around the table intensified. He glanced carefully at his dad, who looked like he was thinking hard. Casting around for a change in subject, Scorpius looked down at his plate.
“Okay, so maybe I’m a little obvious. It’s not like he feels the same or anything.”
Everyone in the audience started cheering as Harry turned to Draco and pulled him into a tight hug. They grinned at Scorpius, who was standing on his chair and cheering, before turning to put their wings away and shaking hands with their host. They had just returned to their seats when he spoke again.
“It’s okay. You’ve been working hard, I’m sure you’re tired. Why don’t I take you home?”
“Dad,” Scorpius sighed. “Dad you don’t need to cook for us. I can do it.”
“Me too,” Harry said genuinely. “And I’m glad you’ve gotten the chance to get to know him too,” he added.
“That’s Teddy’s room,” he explained, stepping forward and holding open the door to the master.
He pointed at an exposed plastic bone with a triangular shape, before bending down to brush more sand off of it. Scorpius gasped as he recognised the coveted wing piece.
senior correspondent, Rita Skeeter, Potter's business partner and right-hand man, Michael Corner, revealed that not all is as it seems in our hero's head.
“I wasn’t—”
Scorpius was secretly relieved when his dad woke up the next morning—when he’d found the bottle of calming draught in the kitchen, it had been shockingly empty, which had made him worry about when his dad would wake up. Unfortunately, his dad seemed to remember exactly what they’d spoken about the night before, and was acting oddly evasive. He merely nodded at Scorpius, ignoring the pancakes his son had made and making his way upstairs. Scorpius heard his bedroom door close and then didn’t hear from him again before he had to leave for work. Leaving a sticky note with a smiley face on it next to his dad’s pancakes, Scorpius shrugged on his Auror robes and made his way to work.
“Really? A divorce lawyer believes in true love?”
It wasn’t long before Draco swept into the cafeteria, looking as posh as ever. Harry noticed that the three piece suit under his robes was once again a stark contrast to the other Healers in the room, most of whom were wearing scrubs, or loose trousers and t-shirts. He was once again carrying a green folder, and Harry was itching to know what was in it.
Scorpius nodded along as he decided to order green curry for himself. Adella had been Teddy’s best friend at school, and was now a Healer at St. Mungo’s. She often ended up treating both Teddy and Scorpius whenever their work sent them to the hospital.
Congratulations on your performance, it really was very well done. If I remember correctly, your talent for drama was nurtured from a young age (don't even try to deny that you were a dramatic little shit) and I'm glad to see it's served you well in adulthood. I guess it goes to show that practice really does make perfect.
“I’m not!” Agent Delta exclaimed, a little too quickly. Some secret agent they were. “It’s to be able to keep an eye on him, to know how far he’s digging.”
“Are you calling me boring?” Harry asked, unsure if he was teasing or not.
It was good of you to come to the closing performance last week. Pansy hadn’t told me that she and Weasley had invited you so I hope you’ll forgive my initial shock when I saw you backstage after the final curtain. I also want to apologize if that headline in
She shook her head, closing up the box.
“I was talking to Hermione yesterday, and she mentioned your, erm, discussion. She’s been giving a lot of thought to what you said. Apparently Harry’s unhappy because he can’t go to a burger joint with Teddy?” she sounded equally confused and annoyed, but Draco didn’t back down this time.
Scorpius nodded. “I remember that. We went flying a lot, especially at the Burrow.”
“Daneri says you already have very good eyebrows,” Hassan pointed out. Harry felt a sense of relief at that. Back home, he’d always been conscious of his noticeably bushy eyebrows—it was nice to have them to be considered favourable for once.
“Well, dragons are very big. It might be too heavy for me to carry. But I promise I’ll try,” Harry vowed, placing his hand over his heart to show the boy how serious he was.
That was reflecting summer stars
“What if I cast an impervious? Then it would keep all the sand off of you while you’re in the pit,” Harry suggested. Scorpius shook his head.
“I’d like to see some more photographs, if you have them.”
"Um, I don't think that's right for me," Harry said quickly. "What about this?" he said, grabbing at another random flyer out of the collection Hassan had put together for him. His host gave him a searching look, before turning his attention to whatever Harry was showing him. Harry wasn't sure what it was for, but as Hassan started explaining which museums were most popular, Harry forgot all about it.
“I’m sure he won’t be like that forever,” Harry assured him. “He just wants to know that you’re okay.”
Draco smiled at that. “You know a lot about my son,” he pointed out. Harry nodded.
"This?"
“I guess they are,” Harry conceded. After showing Draco how to use the coffee machine, and producing two steaming mugs of coffee for them both, they joined Scorpius on the couch again. Just as the show was ending, Harry picked up the remote and switched the television off.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Vegas is a classic case of people getting hitched without thinking it through. I should have known to warn you about it."
Trying not to get distracted with thoughts of horrible penmanship, Draco turned his attention back to the Auror report from the morning his second patient had been admitted.
His suspicions confirmed, Harry took a deep breath and said the words he’d been mulling over all night.
“I think I’m going to stay here,” Scorpius said finally. “Teddy was right that it is an experience I need for myself. I really have been learning a lot since moving in here.”
"They not here," she whispered, before moving forward and capturing his lips again. Realising she was absolutely right, he kissed her back.
To steal—nay, borrow, a jar.
It was a new club, right out on the strip. It seemed like they had arrived at the same time as everyone else in the city; the crowd was huge, and Harry found himself holding on to Bryan’s hand as they made their way, first to the bar, and then to the table, just so that he wouldn’t get lost. It wasn’t long before they were all a few drinks in, and suggestions of dancing started cropping up. Linda and Carol were the first ones up, followed closely by Jackie. Bit by bit the group disappeared into the throng of people, until only Joel, Bryan and Harry were left at the table.
Draco shook his head, also looking surprised now.
You have to look at the facts objectively, even if they lead you to a conclusion you don’t want to hear.”
"Oh Merlin, this is a new level of stupid, even for you! How did you go through the whole wedding without even knowing what was happening?"
“Because he was mistried. They found new evidence that proves he was blackmailed into doing what he did, and—”
Harry turned to look at him, surprised. "Didn't the reception desk tell you I've booked a room for you both?"
Harry was stunned. Had posh, wealthy Malfoy just ordered the cheeseburger? Clearly oblivious to Harry’s surprise, Malfoy resumed the previous conversation.
As Peevsy creeps along the lake,
Scorpius breathed a sigh of relief. This actually worked out perfectly for him.
Draco gave him a soft smile, and Harry felt his heart melt at the sight. He moved to the fireplace, and was just about to step in when Draco grabbed his hand and spun him around.
“I’m glad you enjoyed it. I figured it would be a nice break from those casseroles.”
"I come too." There wasn't much to bring over, but Harry figured he wouldn't mind the company.
“Yeah, we know,” Hermione grumbled. “You don’t want to be set up, you don’t want to flirt with people at the club, you don’t want to use an app or an owl dating service. You just think your soulmate is gonna fall out of the sky into your lap one day, right?”
“That’s great, Harry.” Draco cast a quick
“Second picture.”
small,” Harry chuckled. “But yes, I don’t think a little-league pitch would quite suit our needs, as adorable as it is to watch the little ones zipping about.”
As Scorpius read the report for the first case, he managed to finally shake thoughts of his papa and focus on public safety, which was not very high in the Wallackson court neighbourhood, a few blocks down from Diagon Alley. Apparently the overnight Aurors had been called in multiple times over the past two weeks, with reports that cries for help were heard from one of the houses. When they went to speak to the owner, however, he said that nothing was amiss, and he had no clue why his neighbours thought he was in distress. He assured them that he was the only one living in the house, and had even invited them in one time, during which they hadn’t seen anything suspicious. After the 7th call in 10 days, they’d escalated this to the Head Auror, who had apparently decided that Scorpius would get to the bottom of it. With a sigh, he finished reading the file, grabbed his cloak, and flooed out to Diagon, deciding to make the short walk over from there.
“Harry was telling me about Selpie tonight, and I pieced the clues together. I don’t think he realises yet that Selpie was the culprit. He was wracked with guilt over the fact that his review led to budget cuts and job reassignments.”
“Merlin, you’re both so sappy. It’s almost nauseating to watch.”
Shaking all thoughts of his inheritance from his head, Scorpius walked up to number 27 and knocked smartly on the door. It wasn’t long before a gentleman in grey trousers and a yellow shirt answered the door.
“Can you give him a tray?” Harry said pointedly. The cafeteria witch shook her head.
“And why is that?” she prompted.
"Did Priscillia give you the final contract?" he asked. Harry held up the folder.
McGonagall looked like she wanted to say something, but at that moment, the server returned with their drinks. Once she was gone, Draco gestured for McGonagall to continue, but she merely shrugged.
The Head Auror nodded, striding over to a side door and holding it open. Scorpius leaned forward in his seat to watch as Adella walked out—Teddy must have requested her specifically—and on her arm was his papa.
“This morning? I haven’t seen today’s paper yet.” Draco glanced around, hoping someone might have left a copy on a nearby table, but he had no such luck.
“I found those tucked into the journal when I took it out of storage,” he explained. “They weren’t catalogued, but I don’t see how they would have changed anything.”
doing shots, regardless of whether they could perform magic or not. He’d been warned that it was a very quick way to get drunk, and had therefore avoided it for the past few days. But last night, he’d been feeling brave, and agreed to join Linda for one. Unfortunately, one turned into two, and then three, and… well, Harry didn’t remember what happened after that, but he was sure it must have been painful.
Scorpius wrinkled his nose. "I don't really like sand. It got in my shoes when we were at the beach and it was all itchy."
“Gently, Scorpius,” she chided. “Don’t jump on him. He’s not strong enough for that.”
"Well, have a good trip, Harry," Draco said purposefully, clearly trying to prevent Scorpius from asking anymore embarrassing questions.
“Yeah, Carol found a really cheap buffet out on the strip! We figured we’d try it for lunch.”
"Pappa says no travel together alone. Not before married."
Scorpius nodded, contemplating Harry’s words.
“Yeah. It’s going to be a lot of work maintaining a long-distance relationship. But I’ll tell you another secret, Harry. You’re absolutely worth it.”
“The group that Draco made Polyjuice potion for 15 years ago threatened to kill Scorpius if he didn’t cooperate with them. The recipe that Draco brewed was analyzed recently, and it shows that he purposely changed it so that the murderer would get caught. The Wizengamot decided that he had served enough time for his role in the crime, and released him.”
“Malfoy,” she muttered, reaching for a bowl. Harry’s eyes widened as he realised that Draco had been so hesitant because he was afraid of his colleagues’ judgement. He wondered if this was isolated to the cafeteria staff, or if Draco had to deal with this kind of behaviour all the time.
“I checked and stabilised every single organ, muscle, bone, tissue and vessel I could think of in her body, and I’m going to consult with an expert today to ensure we can put her completely to rights. We’ve Charmed her to sleep until we’re certain she’s okay, so she won’t feel any pain. There’s no need to worry. From what I gather, she’s going to be completely fine.”
After leaving the girls, Draco made his way back to his apartment, where he took no small pleasure in telling his shady landlord that he was moving out, effective immediately. Millie, ever the rational thinker, had convinced him that he should stay at the Humdinger tonight. It didn’t make sense to take everything back to Knockturn Alley for one night, only to have to get out of there first thing in the morning. He packed up the ragged blankets, the worn out clothes, and the few meagre belongings he had, and promptly dropped them in a community donation bin out on Diagon Alley. He didn’t need them anymore.
Malfoy contemplated him for a moment, a confused expression on his face, before nodding at Harry.
“Traditionally, the Gerewhol is also considered a matchmaking ceremony,” Hassan admitted. “Daneri and I, we thought it had been clear that you weren’t there for a bride, but just to participate in the culture. It seems that one of the girls did not understand that, however, and has chosen you as her husband.”
Harry considered his son’s request. Scorpius had seemed more and more comfortable lately in bringing up Draco in their conversations, and Harry hadn’t done anything to discourage it. He’d meant it when he’d said that he didn’t want Scorpius keeping secrets from him, but even more than that, he found he was starting to look forward to hearing the small snippets of how Draco was doing. Of course, hearing about him and seeing him were two very different things.
Camilla groaned, and Harry turned to look at the couple, who turned out to be Camilla's father, and an elderly woman who looked strikingly like Camilla. As Camilla started arguing with her father once more, Harry turned to the lady he assumed to be her mother, giving her a bright smile and shaking her hand.
Ron nodded. “Yeah, but we wanted to talk to you before you left.”
“I know you’re gonna lecture me about spying on the Department of Mysteries,” Harry started once her office door was closed safely behind him, not even giving her the chance to start lecturing him. “But—”
“Uh, yeah. Just a check-up.”
Harry wasn't sure what time it was, but he was certain of one thing; it was too goddamn early to be awake. So why on earth was Camilla's father knocking on the door and calling out to him? Bleary eyed, Harry rolled out of bed and shuffled toward the door, wondering what he could possibly want.
Draco,
It took considerably more effort to get Teddy set up on the stand. He had apparently brought diagrams and stacks of notes along to get his point across, and there were also several pieces of evidence to submit, including the journal and a little vial. Scorpius had first realised that Harrison was worth the money he was paying her when she had suggested that they look at the physical evidence for Silverthorn’s case to see if anything from there could help them. It had turned out that his flask of Polyjuice was still stored in the evidence locker, and Teddy had been able to analyse the sample, proving it had been brewed with Draco’s modified recipe. They had thought long and hard about including it, since it proved that Draco had in fact brewed the potion that was used, but in the end, Harrison had explained that in a court of law it was never a good idea to outright lie. They simply wanted the truth to be told, since it put Draco in a much more positive light than where he currently was.
“I’m sorry, I feel like I often end up crying in your office,” he mumbled, wiping his eyes hastily on his sleeve.
“He didn’t? What did you tell him about where I was?”
“If you bring back a dragon, you can fly back on it, instead of taking a muggle air-oh-plain,” Scorpius suggested wisely, clearly unaware that the logistics of flying on a dragon were highly flawed. “Papa went on a air-oh-plain this week, and he didn’t like it at all. He got really sick.”
“Have fun at work, Draco!” Luna said genially. “And watch out for Pebbleskulled Icanhazbugs! The hospital is infested with them, but carrying malachite in your pocket should protect you.”
“Draco, over here!” McGonagall waved him over to the same table in the corner.
“Scorpius. I… well, we were just… I mean, I should… last night, I—”
“Should we join them?” Bryan asked casually. Harry stared carefully out at the crowd. While he usually avoided crowds like the plague, no one knew him here, and he could be as anonymous as he wanted. He turned back to Bryan, only to find his friend standing next to him with his hand held out.
Squaring his shoulders, Harry forced himself to march over to the bedroom, where the door was once again ajar. He stepped inside, once again finding himself face to face with a terrified looking Draco. It seemed his ex was just as scared of him.
“Yes please,” Harry said, nodding at the witch. He glanced back at Draco. “See? It’s the one you wanted.”
day off, and everything goes to shit,” Teddy complained. He was clearly gearing up for a rant, but Scorpius cut him off immediately, knowing his time was limited.
Is Potty snogging the Ferret
Camilla nodded, a bright smile plastered on her face, though her eyes seemed to be watering.
That made Harry chuckle. “Are you saying you’re not a mess?” he teased.
Harry sighed. "Well, it's done, and I'm married, for the fourth time now. Are you able to help me with the fourth divorce?"
“So, I have a confession,” Harry said carefully. He looked up to find Draco staring at him with wide eyes, as if Harry was about to reveal a huge secret.
Thankfully, working on the payroll audit seemed to take Harry’s mind off of his date for the rest of the morning. He signed the last page around lunch time, made sure the menu wasn’t mixed into the file and handed it to Hermione before heading out for his lunch break.
“I still need to build up a case, and probably find him a defence lawyer. He didn’t have one last time, so I want someone good.”
Merlin, Draco was no longer in Azkaban. Harry had had fifteen years to learn to accept that the man he loved was gone forever, and now here he was. Because when it boiled down to it, that was the crux of the matter. Harry still loved him. He’d never stopped, despite what he might have said to anyone else. He was furious, for sure, and there were still many questions that needed to be answered. But there was something cathartic about admitting, at least to himself, that he loved Draco.
“Well, he’s here now,” Scorpius said, giving him a small smile. “I’m glad you guys have been getting to know each other again.”
“It means Draco Malfoy was threatened.”
Harry placed a hand on Draco’s arm, reminding himself that the gesture was to comfort his date, not because his blazer was so soft.
“Polyjuice,” she confirmed, identifying the potion much faster than Scorpius had. “Have you managed to figure out this code in the margins?”
Harry nodded. "Yes. Very pretty."
Scorpius shrugged. “He’s getting better. But yeah, it’s still not great.”
Harry groaned as he thought about having to climb all the way back down those steps, but realised he was happy to do it for Scorpius, who was trying to peer over the railing to see the whole slide.
“Little-league pitches are usually quite small though,” Teddy pointed out. “I used to think Niffler Downs was huge when I was five, but I just walked past it a few weeks ago and it’s tiny. You could probably score by throwing the quaffle from the opposite hoops.”
She rolled her eyes but translated for her parents nonetheless. Her father scoffed at him.
Draco was staring out the window and didn’t say anything more. Not wanting to interrupt his thoughts, Harry waited quietly.
“We’re not dating,” he said. It would probably cause some awkward moments for Harry if he went away for two years while everyone thought they were a couple. “I was, um, working for him this past week, and he paid me this morning.”
“I’m overdressed,” Draco noted, taking in Harry’s tight jeans and his favourite jumper. Harry shook his head, smoothing his hand down Draco’s lapel and marvelling at the soft material.
It wasn’t long before the scorching heat of the sun overhead became too much for him though. Giving up on the ritual for the time being, he wandered past a gaggle of girls who were all watching him carefully, toward where Hassan and Daneri were sitting under the shade of a large tree. He was about a foot away when he felt the effects of a strong cooling charm. Hassan had warned him that Daneri was the only wizard in the tribe, and that they had to be careful about using magic around the others. Harry wasn’t complaining though. He couldn’t help worrying that if they were going to be spending a lot more time in the heat, he might actually faint. Though considering the strength of Hassan’s cooling charms, maybe not.
"I'd like to try football," Harry told him. "I haven't played since I was a child, though, so I know I'll be terrible at it."
Draco couldn’t say what came over him at that moment. He knew more affectionate gestures would only hurt Harry when things inevitably came to an end between them. He knew he was setting them both up for heartbreak. But he couldn’t help himself as he leaned forward, and kissed Harry as gently as he could, right on top of his lightning bolt scar.
“But you were at all sorts of events as his date,” she pointed out.
For there under the beech tree,
“Do you have to be at work right away? If you have time, do you want to come to mine?”
"You're serious?" Draco whispered, stunned. Harry had barely nodded when Draco burst out laughing even harder this time.
“I think that’s a very good idea,” Draco replied, and once again grabbing both their hands, Scorpius led them into the auditorium. It hadn’t filled up yet, and so they got good seats right at the front. Scorpius gazed up at the lit stage, chattering away as he wondered what the story would be about. It wasn’t long before the room filled up and the lights dimmed, putting the focus on the stage.
“You’re still an open book,” Draco added apologetically. “I could tell from your face that you were wondering. I can’t quite balance a plate on my lap, so sitting on the sofa doesn’t work.” He reached the island as he said all this. Leaning up against it with one arm, he pulled his wand out of his pocket, and with a wide flourish, dishes flew out of the various cupboards and drawers until two places were set at the island.
"What about you, Draco?" Harry asked, grabbing another plate.
His last statement startled Draco into a laugh. Recently, Harry had found himself collecting jokes and funny stories, hoping to get the chance to use them to hear that beautiful laugh again. If Draco agreed to live with him, he might get to hear it every day.
“Will you move to Hogsmeade?”
to knit?”
“The hair, or your son’s life. Which is it?”
liked.
Harry was confused. Why didn’t Draco just want to
“He insists on it, and it’s hard to argue with him,” Draco said quickly. “I’ve told him numerous times that we can share the bed—it’s large enough for two people. Or I suggested we alternate, and take turns sleeping on the sofa. Heck, he could even put a second bed in there, there’s enough room. But the stubborn boy just won’t see reason!”
Harry sighed. "I don't want anything from her, but she was pretty upset when I left. I don't know if she'll agree easily to a divorce."
“Harry, I have to warn you that travelling with a five-year-old is very different to travelling with adults. Scorpius gets tired easily, and he’s quite picky about certain things.”
Harry threw his head back with a groan, summoning all his willpower not to start yelling and swearing right there. This
He was still in Azkaban though. The thought sobered Scorpius instantly. His father had tried to protect him, and now he was paying the price. He’d suffer for the rest of his life if they didn’t do something about it.
Of course Harry was comfortable on a first name basis with their old professor. Though he supposed it could only help—he’d have to get used to it too if he was to work with her.
“I don’t think that’s true,” Draco said with a frown. “I do believe that we have our true loves out there somewhere.”
“Malfoy, are you sure?”
“Where’s Scorpius?” Harry cut him off, not wanting to talk to Draco anymore. “This is his flat.”
“Um, photographs help to make a place feel like home,” his dad said eventually. “You’re welcome to take copies of any of the ones I have here. There are some good memories from when you and Teddy were teenagers.”
“I’ll have the cheeseburger with additional bacon and a side of chips, please.”
Harry rolled his eyes, but linked his arm in Draco’s anyway.
“I don’t think so,” Scorpius said kindly. “He’s been a bit awkward with me, but he hasn’t gotten mad.”
“I am quite cold,” he agreed. Scorpius suddenly realised that he was still wearing the standard issue Azkaban robes. They looked worn out, and if they could barely keep his father warm in the middle of the hospital, he had no idea how useful they would have been out in the middle of the sea. Acting on autopilot, Scorpius removed his heavy red Auror robe and stepped forward to drape it around his father’s shoulders. He was suddenly glad that he’d been planning to go in to work after the court hearing
“Because we’re sisters?” his aunt questioned, raising an eyebrow at him. “Have you met Bellatrix?”
are boring,” Malfoy said easily. “But when I asked about your day, all you could mention was payroll auditing.”
"Harry," Bryan said. Harry couldn't actually hear it, but he watched as those lips formed the syllables, soft and red. He had a sudden urge to kiss this man who'd been such a wonderful friend to him over the past few days. He wondered when the last time he'd kissed someone had been. He thought about it for a few beats, and realised it must have been Camilla. Merlin, that felt like a lifetime ago now.
He didn’t know how to say all that to Harry though. As much as he’d fallen head-over-heels for him, their relationship was still relatively new. It was a discussion they would certainly have one day, but it didn’t matter right now. They had all the time in the world to figure it out.
“Draco, then. At least let me split it with you.”
Scorpius nodded, unsure what to say to that. As she packed her things with a wave of her wand and turned to leave, Scorpius turned his attention back to his Papa, who was watching him warily.
Draco nodded, barely paying attention as she disappeared. He sat down at the table, contemplating the envelope. It was rather thick, which told him there must be multiple sheets of parchment in it. He ripped it open as a large stack of pancakes, topped with strawberries and clotted cream, appeared in front of him.
Just then, Harry’s stomach grumbled, causing both boys to laugh. He was definitely ready for some food, and trooped off to the common bathroom for a quick shower, and to get dressed. Bryan was still sitting on his bed when he got back, reading a sheet of paper (that had been another adjustment for Harry. He remembered paper from his primary school, but these days, he was so used to parchment that the light material felt rather odd in his hands).
Harry shrugged. “I enjoy cooking, it’s no trouble. I know you’ve been quite busy with work lately.”
“Oh? Well, what about colleagues from work?”
where she has a sordid affair with her handmaiden and together they overthrow the patriarchy and oust the prince who’s demanding she marry him.”
He was glad to hear Bryan laugh at that.
As he picked up a couple and offered them to Draco, an apology ready on his lips, he noticed that the pages he was holding were blank. Looking around at the others that he hadn’t picked up yet, he found that they were all blank. His apology melted away as the curiosity took over.
Harry shook his head. "I love it. Do people not fly here?"
Draco nodded, still not trusting his voice. He felt his eyes stinging, and couldn’t believe that he was going to start crying about this.
"Let's ask him now," Harry said, standing up and offering her his arm. A few minutes later, he found himself in her parents' living room, being shouted at by her father. Clearly he didn't find the idea of going to Oslo nearly as lovely as his daughter did.
“I was hoping you would like it. Shall I order a bottle of wine for us?”
After a hearty meal, during which Camilla and her mum talked non-stop, and her father kept giving Harry rough pats on the shoulder, Harry picked up his bag, turning to thank his hosts and say goodnight.
Now it was Draco’s turn to be stunned. Could this Warren bloke be the wizard he was looking for? It seemed too good to be true—the solution to a case rarely dropped into an agent’s lap like this. But he wasn’t one to look a gift Abraxan in the mouth.
Harry slouched in his seat. "I don't want to upset her more or make this difficult. But I barely knew her for a couple of weeks. I'd rather not have to give her my entire Gringotts account if it can be helped."
By Friday morning, Harry was a nervous wreck. He’d been letting his brain run wild over the past few days, considering all the
“Well, here’s the thing,” he started, only to be met by three identical groans.
“You know I’m not.”
His dad frowned, glancing at the pot, and Scorpius could already tell that he was going to be sent home with the leftovers.
“Help. His name is Help. Odd, isn’t it? Part of me wants to train it out of him, but I don’t want to erase that history either.”
“Come on, Scorpius, why are you so reluctant to let me help?”
“Sounds good,” Teddy said cheerfully. “Don’t worry Draco, you’re in good hands with Adella.”
Draco stared into his water glass, wondering how he could admit to McGonagall that he wasn’t dating Harry at all. He’d thought she would be the best person to turn to for advice, but now that it was time, he couldn’t even bring himself to speak.
“So, what type of Healing do you do, exactly?” Harry asked. He watched carefully as Malfoy sipped his wine, searching for any hint of a lie, but he was composed as ever.
“Usually one minute is enough for most foods,” Harry explained, pointing out the 1 minute button. Draco, who was still staring into the microwave, jumped when the light suddenly went off and the microwave started beeping.
"Yes, actually.  Due in June," he said with a wry smirk.
“You should come stay with me.”
“Why do you care about that?” he asked. “You should go somewhere that has dragons.” To illustrate his point, Scorpius raised his arms, and shaping his fingers into claws, let out a bellowing roar.
“Marvelous! Come on up gentlemen, don’t be shy now, come on up!”
If there was one certainty in the world, it was that Draco hated reading Ministry documents. They were usually tedious and full of unnecessary information. Thankfully they had adopted the use of Handwriting Charms on their quills a few years ago—certain reports had been completely illegible before that change. Not that Healers had any better penmanship than anyone at the Ministry, but at least the hospital had adopted Handwriting Charms well before Draco had arrived.
“I find it hard to believe that not a single Unspeakable has a romantic relationship outside the department.”
"I'm sure the hotel has a gift shop where I can get him some. I'll need a pair too. What do you say Scorp? Lets go check out the hotel's pool."
The first week and a half of Harry's trip was fabulous. He spent his days out and about with Hassan, visiting tourist attractions but also experiencing the local day-to-day life. Harry loved the bustling heat of the city, especially the outdoor markets. Hassan was surprisingly patient with him as he browsed through the stalls, especially considering that everyone around them seemed to be incredibly rushed. He examined dried herbs and spices, beautiful textiles, fresh fruits, potions ingredients and kits, and even a wide selection of toys. The bright creations reminded him a little warily of Camilla, but he pushed on, thinking instead of Scorpius, and how much he'd enjoy the multicoloured kite Harry had bought for him. Harry couldn't help the smile on his face as he imagined Draco and Scorpius running about in a park, pulling on the string of the kite as it flew higher and higher. Knowing Draco, Harry was sure he'd probably use a few subtle spells to get it as high as it could go.
Scorpius narrowed his eyes at the man, who was now grinning at an expressionless Head Auror.
“The journal also had pictures of you and me in it. Silverthorn had written threats on the back of them in old code, and given them to Papa to coerce him into brewing the polyjuice. It’s not a commonly used code anymore, so I didn’t recognise it, but Head Auror Clearwater did. Once we’d gathered the evidence, she helped me bring the case before the Wizengamot. They decided that Papa was still guilty, but only of being an accessory to murder, not of planning and attempting a terrorist attack. That brought his sentence down to fifteen years, which meant it was time to release him.”
“I wonder who would do such a thing,” Dean mused. “Do you think it had to do with the Wizengamot member?”
. It was like that during the war too, people pretending to care left, right, and center so that they could manipulate me into doing things for them.”
Draco stepped out into the hall, wondering what in the name of Merlin was going on. Why was Potter suddenly so insistent on having Draco treat his mysterious itch? If it wasn’t an STI, clearly one of his Weasleys had played a prank on him and put Bulbadox powder in his pants. Thankfully that was an easy issue to identify, and even easier to fix. He’d have Potter on his way in no time and get back to his work.
“No wonder Hermione never pushes the subject. She knows about your overview, doesn’t she?”
“I’m going back to my own room where there’s no gross kissing!” he declared. He marched off through the door that connected both rooms and clambered onto his own bed, hiding under the cover for good measure. It was too much for Harry, who started laughing at Scorpius’ antics. He turned to find Draco laughing as well.
“You heard me,” Draco said smugly.
“I don’t work for you anymore,” Draco growled as he was dragged into the alley behind the shop by an unpleasantly familiar face.
“This is lovely, Harry. He’s going to be so excited to receive it. Thank you.”
“Do you really think it might be my toilet paper?” Potter looked confused at Draco’s suggestion.
"I guess I should," he shrugged. He wasn't sure how much longer he would be in the country, but he was enjoying himself so much that he figured staying a little while more wouldn't be an issue at all. Plus, if he could communicate, it might encourage him to come visit again soon.
“I didn’t,” Harry admitted. “But that’s changed now.”
“I, uh, don’t really have anyone worth telling,” he mumbled. “I lost touch with most of my friends after school.”
“To resign?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes. When?"
He still seemed to be sleeping, so Harry closed his eyes and lay back against the soft bed, trying desperately to remember the events of the previous night. They'd been at the club, dancing sinfully close to each other, and then Bryan had kissed him. After someone had yelled at them to "get a room", they'd both made their way over to the bar, and snogged some more. Harry also remembered ordering more drinks, but that was where his memory started failing him.
“You said you were there for a general appointment, right?” Draco supplied dutifully.
Harry, I hope you don’t worry about the confusion you experienced here. Everything has, thankfully, resolved itself. However, I also don’t want you to worry about why Zare picked you. I know you’ve been told it was an opportunity for her to change her life, and that you weren’t the man for her. But that shouldn’t impact your self esteem. I know you are hard on yourself, and I want to remind you that you are a beautiful man, both inside and out. You need to trust yourself and have faith that things will work out, because I am sure they will. You deserve good things, and they will come to you.
Teddy nodded. “Anytime,” he called over his shoulders as he wandered off, stealing the last of Scorpius’ Pepper Imps as he went. Scorpius took a moment to mourn the loss of his candy, before deciding that it was a reasonable price to pay for his cousin’s help.
His mind wandered back to the case file sitting in his desk drawer. It was still full of information he had yet to uncover. He wondered what he would find after reading it all. Would he magically find some evidence that his father was innocent after all? Or would he just confirm what his dad had been saying along?
“They’re mostly all here.” He let Harry believe that he was talking about the hospital staff. The truth was, many Unspeakable liaisons held high level positions in society that got them invited to these types of events. There was the Associate Editor of the
"Okay, so we'll have to submit a formal statement to the courts to dissolve the marriage. We can start with your address," Draco added, pushing one of the notepads provided by the hotel and a self inking quill toward Bryan. Bryan picked up the quill clumsily—clearly, he was the type of guy who used pens - and scratched out his address. His handwriting wasn't very neat—Draco actually squinted at the page for a moment, before frowning again.
"Um, no," Harry said sheepishly. "I actually need your help."
Scorpius looked like he was going to argue, but Harry cut him off.
Scorpius’ face lit up as he realised that his father was going to go into the sandpit for him. Grinning along, Harry led Scorpius to the edge of the sandpit, where they started scanning the mounds of sand while waiting for Draco to be ready. When his father stepped into the pit, Scorpius was ready.
“Also, Agent Phi is going to be joining our weekly briefings.”
Since staying out all day took quite a lot out of Scorpius, they usually found themselves back in the hotel by dinner time, ordering room service or pizza and relaxing in front of the TV. Tonight was no exception, and as usual, Scorpius was snoring loudly on his father’s lap by the time the credits rolled.
“It’s nice. It still feels a little generic though. Like, I’m not quite sure what style I want in it. You know?”
“Thank you for dinner,” Harry said, stepping out onto the street and suddenly feeling shy.
He flipped to the page with the notes about salamander blood, and confirmed that his dad had in fact written the number eight, and not 3.
Draco bit his lip. How could he explain his solitary lifestyle to Harry without giving himself away?
“My parents were Quidditch players?” Scorpius asked. Teddy nodded.
“Nope,” Agent Delta said smugly. Agent Eta looked like they were about to argue, but Agent Delta beat them to it.
“So is that why you’re travelling now? Trying to catch up on experiences you missed?”
“They’re keeping her overnight to make sure everything’s okay, but by the time I left, she looked quite human.”
Harry worried his lip a bit, considering how to answer.
“That was so much fun!” Scorpius laughed, before starting to cough again. “Can I go again?”
“He was brewing illicit potions?”
Harry looked up at Hassan, who looked so genuinely excited at the thought of bringing Harry to the festival. It did sound like fun, and it must be a great cultural experience. He figured dressing up and dancing, and
Harry nodded dumbly. "How did you know?"
“Well then, that seems to be your answer.”
“Wha— eewww!” Scorpius cried from under them. They broke apart in shock, staring at the young boy as he continued to scream.
"Harree!" called an excited voice, and Harry turned to find Camilla, the woman from the toy store, waving at him from a distance away. He waved back, happy to see a familiar face.
“Think about it this way. You enjoy helping people, do you not?”
It had been jarring, to say the least, when his Monitoring Spells had alerted him to the fact that Potter was asking for him. When Potter’s appointment request had arrived last night, he’d intercepted it from patient relations and sent back a refusal. He’d been hoping that was enough, but clearly Potter was determined. Obviously the poor receptionist had neither known how to contact Draco nor redirect Potter, and so Draco had been forced to come down and diffuse the situation himself.
“What’s that?” Scorpius called out, sounding confused. Harry smiled, certain he would be showing the Malfoys how to operate a television, among other technology, later on.
“If you really must know… it was a letter from my mom. Happy? I’m 21, and I still get mail from my parents, checking on me while I travel the country.” He seemed embarrassed about his admission, but Harry didn’t see anything wrong with that. He would
Harry's eyes widened. "But she said that we were married! They had a huge party—it lasted a whole day!"
“I’ll talk to him when he gets home,” Draco sighed. “I can’t believe he got so angry over a new recipe.”
“Unfair? That’s a word they never taught us in Slytherin. Pray tell, what does it mean?” he joked. That just made the Head Auror laugh harder, before she waved him off, reminding him he only had 45 minutes before he had to be back. Still chuckling, he made his way out to the lifts. He hadn’t actually taken advantage of Madge. She’d known he wanted the emergency shift, though she assumed it was because he had a current case to review, not an old one. She had simply offered to bring him lunch anyway, and of course he would return the favour whenever he got the chance.
“So I heard there was a plan to get food?” he asked sheepishly.
“So tell me about this ridiculous story he told you.”
“Ooh, is that your wand?” Luna asked excitedly as he sat down. He handed it over for her inspection, grinning at Pansy and Millicent, who were also giving the new tool curious looks.
"Wha' time izzit?" he groaned. Harry glanced around for a clock.
“Well, now that’s a peculiar story. The shelter said that the little girl who had him before—and terrible story, that, lived in an abusive home, the poor things, she was a squib and her father didn’t like that at all. Normally when wizarding children are taken into protective care, they’re allowed to keep a pet with them, but because she was a squib, they sent her to a muggle relative, and of course a muggle can’t raise a crup, so this little man was sent to the shelter. But because she was so scared all the time, whatever his name was originally, he didn’t learn it, because he learned to respond whenever she cried for help.”
“Because, in their culture, when she picked me as her favourite contestant, that somehow married us. Everyone was surprised that she picked me at all because I don’t fit a lot of their beauty standards, but my host, Hassan, said he had thought it was just for fun.”
Draco smiled at him, and for a moment Harry lost track of the conversation.
He turned to Harry, poking a finger into his chest and threatening something vaguely menacing before turning and stomping off down the hall.
Harry burst out laughing. “You arranged your quills before an exam?”
He thought back to their conversation last night. Harry had asked how much he should pay him, and Draco had blurted 300 Galleons.
need to get him out of there,” Teddy corrected him. “He’s my cousin. I want to help.”
Oh, and Harry, about that thing I did at the end...
“She would be proud of you, Draco.”
He considered lying to her, but he couldn’t figure out what on earth he would say. Deciding he may as well be honest, he sighed “conspiracy theorists.”
“The Wizengamot released me.”
“You’ve been distracted for a couple of days. Your notes on the Apparition Permit Office’s payroll audit make no sense.” She handed him a file he had no recollection of working on. Had he really been that distracted?
So it must have been morning. As his senses slowly came back to him, Harry noticed that the bed underneath him was unusually soft. This wasn't the hostel bed.
Harrison waved him off. “This was an easy case. I dare say it was
“I’ve been thinking about the story time at the museum,” he sighed. “About how dragons mate with their true loves, and how humans have been trying to mimic that pure love for centuries. It’s a little depressing, isn’t it? To think that we can’t have that one person who was meant just for us?”
“I will, don’t worry,” Teddy said casually. His expression then turned serious. “Are you doing okay?” he asked.
“No, a friend of mine brought his son over from London, so I’m going to spend the rest of my trip with them. We’re leaving for San Francisco tomorrow.”
“Oh, um, I had to interview him for a case this morning. He used to coach little-league Quodpot, he’ll probably know which pitch is good.”
Checking his watch, Harry was delighted to notice that he was early. He selected a table right in the middle of the cafeteria, hoping to encourage more people to stop and chat.
Draco nodded. “He didn’t have anyone else to go with, so he asked me.” Thankfully she didn’t seem to put two and two together, and realise that being his date was the service that Harry had paid Draco for. Instead, she chose what might have been an even worse line of questioning.
And there were those pesky tears again. He was crying quite a lot today. He wasn’t sure how long they sat there, silently staring at the flames, when his dad finally turned around. He didn’t say anything, but he pulled Scorpius into a deep hug.
“Okay, here we are, rooms 1125 and 1126,” Harry announced, handing Draco his key. Draco nodded, sliding the key into the lock and opening the door to his and Scorpius’ room, while Harry did the same for his own. He waved goodbye to Scorpius and slipped into his room.
The finality of Agent Phi’s words hung in the air as Agents Eta and Phi stood up and left. Agent Delta was left staring out the window at the rising sun, contemplating their options. Surely there had to be another way.
“I really like you too, Bryan. I think we could have had a lot of fun in New York together.”
Two hours later, Harry found himself slumped in his chair at the tacky restaurant, regretting every decision he’d made that had led him to this point. He was
for Harry that he sloshed his wine all over his beautiful peach shirt. Pansy was going to kill him.
"Thank you. You have a lovely house."
“Harry, if I don’t get him changed into warmer clothes, he’s going to catch a cold,” Draco pointed out.
"Harry, that's an amazing accomplishment. You should be proud of yourself! You helped so many people, and you did it so selflessly."
Ron sniggered, putting his arm around Hermione’s shoulders. “She’s got a point, mate. You need better hobbies than stalking Malfoy.”
He stepped into the lobby, having received a Patronus from the Auror liaison that there had been another Transfiguration attack and that the victim was being brought straight to the emergency department. They didn’t seem to have arrived yet, and so he looked around, only to see…
Scorpius nodded proudly. “Harry used lots of magic, but it was all my ideas.”
“I’m not,” she said coolly. “Because I have a life!”
“Please, have a seat. I’m just going to the loo, I won’t be long. Make yourself at home in the meantime.”
The shopkeeper gave him an odd look when Harry placed the four spoons on the counter and fished out his money bag to pay. Harry didn’t think much of it. The man was probably just curious to see a tourist in his shop. Thanking him with a bright smile, Harry grabbed hold of his wrapped up purchases and headed back to his hotel feeling oddly cheerful.
"You will have fun," she stated blandly. Harry could tell she was disappointed, and cast around for something to say to cheer her up. It was then that he had an idea.
Scorpius bit his lip as a thought occurred to him.
For the first time in his life, Scorpius didn’t groan about being stuck on emergency duty. The emergency Aurors spent the day sitting around the Aurors’ emergency floo line and post box, waiting for calls from the community. They then distributed them to whichever Aurors weren’t already out in the field, or the MLE interns if it was of low enough priority. The thing was, they were living in relatively peaceful times, so aside from the odd robbery or accident out on Diagon Alley, or old ladies whose crup climbed a tree and couldn’t get down, it basically meant a very boring shift. Most Aurors would bring their other case work to do while sitting at the emergency post, but they were only allowed to leave for urgent washroom breaks and a late lunch, when someone else was available to cover them. Scorpius usually spent emergency duty shifts bored out of his skull, but today he was glad for it—it would give him time to keep studying his father’s file.
The prat was back and asking about Draco again, if the Monitoring Spells going off on his wand were any indication. He crept closer, listening to Potter’s conversation with the receptionist.
And that was when it hit Harry. These two snarky, playful, kind-hearted blonds meant the world to him. He didn’t know what he’d do if he couldn’t see them regularly, if he couldn’t spend the rest of his life taking care of them and making them happy. He
“On active cases, yeah.” Teddy’s eyes widened at that.
“But if St Mungo’s won’t hire you, you can’t be a Healer at all!”
Harry looked stunned at the revelation. Draco watched patiently as Harry pieced together the clues.
“Did you bring the chewing gum this week?”
Hermione waved her hand vaguely. “It wasn’t a serious suggestion. Just stop obsessing about Malfoy.”
he amended in his head. When Laura had outed Harry to the world as bisexual, Scorpius had read the article and promptly declared that he was 'bisecal' as well.
“I tried,” he finally replied. “Clearly didn’t succeed though,” he muttered under his breath, pushing around a piece of broccoli. He wasn’t as quiet as he thought, if Draco’s sudden laughter was any indication. Harry hadn’t heard Draco laugh in so long that he couldn’t help staring. It had once been one of his favourite sounds.
Scorpius’ eyes lit up at the mention of chocolate, and Harry wasn’t surprised to see that Draco’s did too. Before long, they were on their way to Ghirardelli Square. The thought of riding a cable car seemed forgotten in their taxi—Harry had failed to remember that even a normal car would be a new experience for his travel companions.
“Really? Who?”
“I don’t see how that’s any of your business,” Agent Delta muttered.
“About what?”
As it turned out, Hermione was even more adamant that Harry drop the topic of the Department of Mysteries after a few drinks. Ron had, predictably, groaned at the mention of Malfoy, and laughed at how easily Hermione managed to best all of Harry’s arguments before swooping her out to the dancefloor, leaving Harry to guard their table and stew about his observations from that afternoon.
"Goodnight Camilla," he said, giving her a gentle smile as she stood up. He watched as she disappeared down the walkway towards the small village beyond, turning her very sudden question over and over in his head. With a shrug he pushed it out of his mind, and turned his attention back to the lake.
“I’m not in love with Harry!” Draco spluttered, still stuck on the previous point.
“One more thing. Do you know of anyone who would be capable of such a Transfiguration? The Aurors are investigating, but a list of suspects could help.”
“Let’s get started.  A long, long time ago, there were two young dragons, Harry and Draco, who were good friends.”
“I don’t know where his office is.”
“What just happened?” he demanded. Hassan grimaced, ignoring Harry’s question as he took a steep curve. Harry was nothing if not persistent, however, and he knew it was going to be a long drive. There was no way Hassan could ignore his question forever.
“It’s from Harry,” Agent Phi pointed out. “What does it say?”
Draco nodded, standing up and extending his hand towards Harry.
“And where is this ship headed, if I may ask?” he drawled.
“Oh, no, let me,” Harry said quickly, reaching for the bill. Malfoy was closer, however, and swiped it from the table. The interaction reminded Harry of the way they used to race to the Snitch back in school, each striving only to be faster than the other.
Draco
Harry finished his sandwich, and then flipped over the menu and spent the rest of his break scribbling a list of questions he should ask Malfoy. He kept glancing at his list several times in the afternoon, trying to commit his questions to memory until it was finally time to head to the restaurant.
He turned to her father, wondering if the man might give him any hint, but he was simply sitting there, staring curiously at Harry. Harry smiled at him, glancing again at Camilla before looking at the man again, who suddenly seemed to be quite happy too.
“Harry, how is it that wherever you travel, you manage to get married! That’s what you’re here for, isn’t it?”
"So, um, while I was away... I may have... um, accidenallygotmarried?" he mumbled, scrubbing his hand across his mouth.
“I’m sure you can,” Harry said kindly. “But our teasing hasn’t bothered you this much before. Why are you so upset now?”
"Well, that's it then," Draco said, standing up. Harry did the same, and together they walked out into the outer office.
“He’s been sleeping on the couch all this time, hasn’t he?”
"Well, the good news is that according to the Norwegian Ministry, you're not actually married."
They both got lost in their thoughts as they continued to eat. When Harry finally got up to clear the dishes, Draco stopped him, as usual.
Seamus and Neville sniggered from across the table, clearly amused by Draco’s discomfort. Harry glared at his friends—he’d made it clear that he wanted them to be polite to his date—but that only seemed to make them laugh harder. Dean and Ginny both had their hands over their mouths, as if they were trying not to laugh.
Mal—no, Draco smiled at the sound of his first name, but didn’t relent.
“Please tell me he’s not too young,” Harry said worriedly. “He’s so excited.”
Draco nodded. “That’s true, and I understand that. But you know how independent I am. Sometimes it just gets a bit much to have him hovering over every action I take. I’d like to be able to walk to the loo without him trying to guide me there.”
"I come here everyday. It's beautiful."
With Potty’s glasses pushed ajar,
"Okay. I'll do it."
Draco drew his wand and cast a bunch of complex Privacy Spells over their table. McGonagall raised an eyebrow at him.
Bryan was still mouthing something at him, and Harry had to squint through the darkness to make out what he was saying. It still wasn't clear, so Harry leaned in, hoping he'd be able to hear. It seemed Bryan had other ideas though, because as soon as Harry leaned closer, Bryan tightened his hold on Harry's back, and kissed him.
He waited patiently as Harry made the connection, his face lighting up when he did. Draco loved how expressive Harry was. It was part of what made him such a genuine person.
"Do you mind if we use your room to get changed?" Draco asked softly. "I'd rather not portkey back across the Atlantic in nothing but swim trunks."
Draco nodded, pulling out a few sheets of parchment.
“Harree! Oh, so good to see you again!”
Eventually they pulled up to a small house. The outside walls were all painted yellow, and the door and window frames were all white. There were thick nets over all the windows, which Harry presumed were for the mosquitoes that his travel healer had warned him about. He'd brought a mosquito repelling potion, but was glad for the extra protection.
“Do your other colleagues in the hospital behave like this?” he demanded. “You should report her behaviour! She has no right to treat anyone like that!”
Teddy nodded. He tossed out a quick “Thanks Harry!” and the next moment he was gone.
. And for you?”
Just then the server slid the bill onto the table between them. He was discreet, but it drew their attention anyway.
Fuck. Hoping against hope, Harry glanced down at the names on the certificate, but he was out of luck. There, in clear printed letters, were the names Harry Potter and Bryan Anderson, and today's date. He wasn't sure if it was the excessive amounts of alcohol, or the questionable buffet from lunch the day before, or the fear that he'd never be able to travel without getting married again, but Harry suddenly leaned over the bed and threw up all over the ground. When he was finally sure his stomach was done emptying itself, he sat back up, groping around for his wand and vanishing the evidence and casting an air freshening charm.
“What?” Scorpius looked furious again, and Harry hurried to explain.
At that moment, the server reappeared, ready to take their orders. Harry glanced quickly at the menu to double check that the ravioli was still an option before placing his order.
Unfortunately he hadn’t had the time to start looking at the evidence catalogues, which were extensive. He hadn’t wanted to stay late today, knowing that his dad was probably pretty upset. He didn’t want to alienate one parent while trying to save the other.
"Harry's not coming to visit anymore, Scorpius," Draco said gently. Scorpius whipped his head around to look at Harry, horrified.
Draco seemed equally embarrassed at the misunderstanding. Harry definitely didn’t have anywhere else to be these days—he would have probably just gone home and moped about for the rest of the afternoon. It made sense that they should both eat lunch together. After all, how could he know for sure that Draco wouldn’t hurt himself cleaning up after he ate? Yes, Harry decided. He should stay, for Draco’s safety.
“I think that’s really great,” Harry said gently. “I find people tend to take their parents for granted.”
“Careful, Potter,” he said softly. “One might think you’re falling in love with me.”
"No, I'm not going back. This time, I'm going to Chad. Apparently it's very hot there, and it's in the desert, so there's lots of sand."
This piece has been such an adventure to create, and I'm so glad with how it turned out and that I got to share it with you, dear reader! I hope you enjoyed your stay at the Humdinger as much as I did <3
“I’m sure you’ll be a great father when the time comes,” Harry offered. “But we have years to prepare for something like that. I mean, we’re not even married yet!”
“It’s odd how Smith brings out that quality in people,” Harry sighed. His expression suddenly turned stern. “Though you also shouldn’t have provoked him. I changed your name for a reason, don’t go reminding people that you were once a Malfoy. It just puts a target on your back.”
Draco groaned in relief as his fingernails scratched the pink line of scar tissue just above his pubic bone.  Harry watched him, softly shaking his head.
When an owl dropped off a parcel the next morning, containing a collection of photographs and handwritten recipes from his dad, Scorpius was sure that with time his dad would be open to accepting Draco back into his life. As he slipped the package into his desk drawer, Scorpius’ mind was already forming a plan. He couldn’t wait to get started.
“I’m not stalking him!” Harry insisted, folding his arms across his chest. Why couldn’t his friends understand that this was serious?
“Okay, I really do need to get upstairs, but how about we regroup for dinner in the main dining room?”
sounded like a very posh place, and this was
Harry was aware that his wild gesturing probably wasn’t helping his case, but he couldn’t help it.
“Um, it was fine. Did some payroll auditing. My job isn’t as exciting as yours must be.”
that. But that doesn’t mean we can avoid making them. If the people who care give up that responsibility, the choices fall into the hands of those who don’t. By doing this work, you’re making sure that the Ministry is following logic and research when deciding which budgets to cut, rather than arbitrarily slashing departments as they please.”
“Head
“Was he sick from the soup?” Harry asked. Scorpius shook his head.
His inner sense of righteousness, as Hermione called it, was currently overpowering his discomfort though, and so here he was, lurking around near the entrance to the Department of Mysteries. It had occurred to him that they might have other entrances to their offices—many heads of departments had their own Floo connections, and there were secret passageways all over the place. But since he had no idea where any of those other entrances might be, his only option was to hang about here.
"How did we even...? I don't even remember... huh?" Harry was stunned. The whole point of coming to America was to pick an English speaking country so that he wouldn't get married by accident. And yet...
"Master is gone home. Is saying that dinner tonight is being cancelled so master is leaving. Is sir wanting breakfast?"
At his dad’s nod, he continued.
“These modifications would make the Polyjuice less potent,” Teddy explained through a mouthful of turkey and rye. “I think these times in the margins are calculations of how long a dose would last with each change. They match my calculations, anyway.”
“You didn’t,” Draco groaned, as Harry sat down in his office yet again, the stack of papers Hassan had compiled for him in hand.
"Why you looking to me?" she asked curiously, making him realise that he was staring.
Scorpius handed him the parchment with the instructions on it.
Scorpius knew from experience that he would not be able to count the hands fast enough, unless there were very few of them. The courtroom was enchanted to record the results of official votes and present them to the Chief Warlock. The vast majority of hands did seem to be raised though, and Scorpius couldn’t help the little glimmer of hope dancing in his heart. His papa may not have to spend his entire life in prison after all.
“I live alone you see,” he explained, indicating that Scorpius should sit on the old fashioned sofa and summoning a tea set with a swish of his wand. “Tea, m’boy?”
Agent Delta shrugged. “We had dinner last night. I think it went well enough that we’ll do it again.”
“Um, Harry left Draco, not the other way around, gentlemen,” the host said, and realising their mistake, Harry and Draco rushed to switch positions, making the audience chuckle.
Scorpius nodded and joined Harry in the kitchen.
“I really hope you’re right,” Draco sighed. Harry smirked at him.
“Draco, you kept saying that your mother wouldn’t be proud of you, and that I wouldn’t want you in Teddy’s life… I hope you haven’t done anything illegal to get that money.”
"Where are you going?" Scorpius frowned.
He had barely stepped out of the confines of the air conditioned airport for a minute—keeping his eyes peeled for a sign with his name on it that indicated his host was here to pick him up—yet he was already drenched in sweat. He was tempted to point his wand down his throat and cast an aguamenti, despite Flitwick's repeated warnings all throughout his Hogwarts years to never point your wand at yourself, especially down your throat.
“Well, my advice would be to call out “Fire!” if ever there’s a real emergency, just to attract peoples’ attention. It’s something we teach a lot of children as well, because people often disregard a cry for help from a child as part of a game.”
"Was she really mad at me?" Harry asked quietly, staring at the contract. Draco shook his head.
“Draco. Just because you became a Healer through a different avenue than most others does not make you any less of a Healer. We both know that you would have got accepted the first time round if it wasn’t for our society’s lingering prejudice.”
“Oh, the crême brulée here is to die for,” Malfoy exclaimed. “Would you like to share one?”
“Hey guys,” he greeted.
Draco Malfoy did not look as Scorpius remembered him. Scorpius remembered a strong, energetic man who played tag with him in the park, and took him swimming in the summers, and told him funny stories about peacocks and Abraxans. This man, however, was the opposite of strong and energetic. He was hunched over, and it looked like the majority of his weight was being supported by Adella. The exhaustion on his face gave Scorpius the impression that the only stories this man would tell were horror stories.
“A pity, that. Though, personally, I would be loath to work in a place that has such outdated values.”
When Draco stepped out of Harry’s Floo that evening, Harry was still sitting on the sofa where he’d left him last night. He looked adorably sleep-rumpled as he greeted Draco with a soft peck on the cheek. He hated to return such a soft gesture with bluntness, but he didn’t want to chicken out.
“But we didn’t actually get married, right? There was no ceremony or anything,” Harry questioned. Hassan worried his lip, which in turn worried Harry.
Ron shook his head. “We’re still investigating. Our priority was turning the girl back into a human. It’s a complicated process, so we took her to St Mungos, but it took the Healers ages to figure it out. They kept insisting it was a Wheeze.”
“I get that you’re angry, and confused, and hurt, Harry,” Teddy said evenly. “But this situation is too complicated to explain to you when you’re this worked up.”
"Woah, don't just change the topic," Bryan insisted. "Harry, you won the war."
“Teddy!” Draco exclaimed, turning to look at his cousin. “Merlin, you’re all grown up too. Has it really been 15 years?”
“How are you doing?” came Head Auror Clearwater’s voice from beside him. He startled before looking up at her, and noticed Teddy and Harrisson approaching them as well. Scorpius had been made to sit in the spectator gallery for this case, rather than with Teddy and the Head Auror as an expert witness. Harrisson had pointed out that having the accused’s son run the investigation cast a lot of doubt on the results, and so the case had been handed off to the Head Auror.
Harry looked up at Draco in concern. Harry had flown in a plane as well, since there was a ban on portkeys in the region, but it hadn’t affected him at all—he’d simply slept through the entire trip. He felt terrible that Draco had suffered through that for him.
Just thinking about it makes me laugh. Merlin their faces, I thought their heads were going to pop off! I enjoyed myself immensely. It was nice to have someone to talk to and mock the ridiculous three-ring circus that these events inevitably become. Although, do a shot everytime someone invites you to an event was not one of our brighter ideas. What were we thinking? I blame you. You’ve always been a bad influence on me. On the plus side, once you’ve had a few, your dancing drastically improves. It seems to me that you overthink it. But my god, when you dipped me I nearly died laughing.
Draco frowned at him for a moment.
“You know you should always take samples,” Agent Eta chided. Agent Delta glared.
“Yes, except for at night, when he’s running around the yard and I have to call him in. Little bugger loves being out in the moonlight.”
Draco snorted. “So the rumours are true, then? That you and Weasley would have failed miserably if it wasn’t for Granger?”
“Who’s the target?” he asked, resigned.
That night he made his way up the path of a beautiful little brick house, dressed in a formal set of robes that he had purchased that very afternoon after realising in a panic that he had only packed jeans and jumpers for his trip. The cut and design on the robes were rather different than what he was used to wearing, but the salesman had assured Harry that this was the latest fashion. Taking a deep breath, he raised his hand and knocked.
"I'm guessing a hotel?" Harry said, looking around again. "I don't know how we got here though."
“That’s why you’ve been coming to help me, isn’t it? Because Scorpius asked you?” Draco asked softly. Harry gave him a confused look.
"Um, people who don't know magic," Harry explained, realising they must have a different word for them here.
Harry nodded. He pulled out his itinerary, presenting the lists of museums, heritage sites and viewpoints his travel agent had recommended. She nodded approvingly at it.
Draco instantly felt bad for bringing it up. There was guilt written all over Harry’s face, as if he was trying to come up with a plausible reason why he was keeping his meetings with Draco a secret. He was about to spare Harry the embarrassment and say something about it still being early, when he felt it.
Bryan grinned, grabbing Harry’s hand and dragging him along to join the others. As the afternoon wore on into evening, Harry found himself enjoying his trip and his new friends more and more. They danced with a bunch of impersonators, watched a light show in a giant pool at yet another fancy hotel, and as usual, rounded out the night in yet another club.
“You’re all grown up,” he said wistfully. “Last time I saw you, you were just a child.”
By the fourth time that Scorpius asked Harry to go help Draco during lunch, Harry had learned his lesson about being prepared. As soon as he ended the floo call with his son, Harry wandered into the kitchen and started to work. When the time finally came to go see Draco again, Harry stepped through the floo armed with his largest tupperware box.
"Did you show them your papers? Things like your travel visa, portkey license, anything like that?"
“What are you thinking about?” Bryan asked, sitting back down next to Harry, a large plate in his hands. Harry eyed what looked like a waffle topped with four scoops of ice cream, two slices of mousse cake, a bunch of fruits, five swirls of whipped cream, and what looked like an entire tonne of sprinkles. There were also three slices of pie on the side of his plate.
So far, he only had two plausible explanations for why Malfoy could be visiting the Unspeakables. Either he was making some kind of deal with them, or they were doing some kind of medical experiments. Of course, if it was experiments, it was possible that it was all completely ethical, or that it wasn’t being tested on humans at all. Harry had to concede that Hermione’s reasoning on that front made sense. From what Harry knew, Malfoy had kept his head held high and built a steady life as a Healer. He wouldn’t be up to anything nefarious. But
“Papa, come swimming with us!” Scorpius cried excitedly. Draco contemplated his son’s request, and Harry found himself secretly hoping he’d say yes. Draco looked up at him and Harry couldn’t help raising an eyebrow, as if to say “Scared, Malfoy?”.
"It's a competition between men. Mostly to be the most beautiful, but they also sing and dance, and do lots of other small competitions like camel racing. You want to participate?"
“That’s a lot for a children’s book,” Hermione pointed out. “You especially can’t sell things to children that describe
“Of course not. You must master the art of subtlety when making such announcements.”
. He looked around curiously, and was surprised at what he saw. Draco’s decorating style was… eclectic. There was no other word for it. The room was opulent, but not in a traditional sense—there was a maroon velvet sofa with gold legs against a black wall painted with huge images of wildflowers. The floors were a dark wood—almost black, really—and the rest of the walls were either cream or maroon. There was a golden floor lamp with a shade that matched the painted wall, and much more maroon velvet furniture. Harry’s first thought was that Draco had decorated his flat in Gryffindor colours, but after a moment of thinking about it, he realised that these shades were more muted, giving the room a mature look.
“Basically what I’m saying, Harry, is that you have to know how to recognise it when someone loves you. Someone like Scorpius, who thinks the world of you. Or even better… someone like me.”
“You seem so interested in me, always showing up and asking questions. Join me for dinner and we can get to know each other properly.”
“There’s a water slide!” Scorpius screamed, tugging Harry towards it. “Harry we have to go on it!”
“That’s good. I was looking at a few recipe books this morning, and I found a nice lentil soup that you both might enjoy.”
“Have a safe trip, Draco,” she said as she released him and offered the urn of floo powder to him. “Make sure you write often.”
“Did you just have them in a pile on the corner of your desk then?”
Draco turned the fond smile toward Harry.
“I think… I love you too. Both of you,” he said breathlessly. There was a moment where everything seemed to stop except Draco’s smile, and then Draco was kissing him, and it felt so
“So, I’m guessing it would be näive of me to assume you’re going to be in town for a while?” Draco asked, as they both got up and made their way toward the door.
“I would like to. I enjoyed our time tonight.”
“Okay. I’m going to decant my Luminescence Solution and close up my office, and then go crash at your place.”
“Really? What made it so interesting?”
Harry gave him a look of mock affront. “Can’t I just want to visit my good friend and tell him about my trip?”
"Harry?" Bryan said in surprise. He turned over to look up at Harry.
“I don’t have one,” he admitted. “Anyway, I needed someone I could trust.”
“Are you okay, Scorp?” he asked, holding the small boy close and patting his back. Scorpius coughed a few more ties before pulling back and nodding happily.
“Hey Scorp! Just toss it in the sink.”
"Ah, les moldus. Most people here speak French, not English, so we say in French. Moldus."
“I hate him,” Harry growled. “I don’t care what he did or didn’t do. He was wrong, and I hate him.”
“I know, which is why I didn’t make a big deal of it. Though you won’t believe the story he made up,” Agent Delta added with a laugh of their own. Agent Delta watched as agent Eta blew a large pink bubble. Agent Delta no longer resented their partner for that particular ability, though if they practiced in private in the hopes of one day doing it, that was no one’s business but their own.
“Thank you for today,” Draco said, stroking Scorpius’ hair gently. “Actually, thank you for this whole trip,” he added with a chuckle.
Draco nodded. “I think the Minister knows, but yes, other than the two of you, and maybe a few spouses of retired Unspeakables, it’s a secret.”
"A little bit. But I know we're both going to be happier when we find our true loves, so it's okay."
“No, I’m not!” he argued reflexively.
“I’ve also been learning that it doesn’t have to be instant,” Draco continued, staring blankly at the TV. “Turns out, it’s possible to fall in love with someone over a long period of time. One day it’s their smile that you can’t stop thinking about. Then a month later, it’s some careless mannerism of theirs that keeps you up at night. Then weeks after that, it’s their generosity in inviting you on a trip that makes your son so happy he looks like he’s going to burst, and their active participation in making his life as wonderful as possible, that makes you realise you’ll never want to spend your life with anyone else.”
“Lunch?” Harry called back, confused. It was early morning, why would everyone be going for lunch. With a groan, he groped around on the bedside table for his watch, only to gasp in shock as he realised that Bryan was actually making sense. It was almost 1:00 PM. Merlin, how had he slept so late?
“Draco,” Malfoy interrupted. “Call me Draco.”
“And crisps Papa!” Scorpius chimed in. Draco laughed at their cheeky son while Harry rolled his eyes. Giving each a kiss, he zipped his jacket up over his pyjamas and set off towards the corner shop.
I know that’s not
“He’s that ill?”
“It doesn’t seem to have been affected at all. I can still feel my power through my wand, and not a single spell has failed so far.”
“Can I pet him? Or her?”
“I know whatever Papa did must have really hurt you. I know it’s probably really hard to talk about it. I’ve tried to be patient and to listen to you, Dad, I really have. But I can’t forget about it. I can’t stop myself from wondering what happened. I love you… but I loved him too.”
“Yes, sir!” Harry called, grinning as he started tugging the floatie along again. Scorpius turned to watch in anticipation as his father dove under the floatie, reappearing on different sides each time and reaching up to tickle his son. To retaliate, Harry kept tugging the float in different directions, making Scorpius squeal each time they made a sharp turn.
“Draco? You’re very quiet all of a sudden.”
Draco stared at the page, unsure what he'd just read. He'd never heard of asexuality and had no idea what it actually was, but surely it wasn't as messed up as Skeeter had made it out to be (because of course it was her who'd written this). Even the picture of Harry that they'd included with the article was unflattering, showing him from a side profile looking angry and stressed. No wonder the man had fled London.
"Oh, hello Harry," Draco greeted him. "Are you back already?"
"Okay," he sighed, resigned. "But I'll come back and see you again, soon."
Harry spent the rest of the morning thinking about the same things that had been running around his head all night. He’d been sure that Scorpius would have ranted to Teddy as soon as he got home the night before. Scorpius wasn’t the type to keep his frustrations to himself, and he wondered if Draco would have heard of their argument.
They were both crying by now, the weight of everything they’d been through crashing down on them. Harry let go of Draco’s hand, shifting closer to put an arm around his waist, and Draco pressed his face into Harry’s shoulder, the two men seeking a comfort in each other that they’d craved for years. Draco spared a thought for how natural it felt to curl up with Harry like this, how right it felt to be back in his arms. He felt a fresh wave of tears hit him as he realised that he’d missed out on 15 years of this, just because of his stubbornness.
"Marriage certificate? Did you get married, Harry?" Scorpius asked, eyes wide.
The end.
“You too!” Harry called, startling Draco out of his thoughts once more. He fumbled the twirl, and crashed into Harry.
"I'm going on vacation again," Harry said cheerfully.
“Smith. I see you’ve met my son, Scorpius,” Harry said, his tone making it clear he’d heard everything Smith had just said.
First off, thanks for the hangover potion. I was barely able to get out of bed this morning to let your owl in. If I never have to see a shot again in my life, I’ll be a happy man.
“Oh?”
“How is it that no one knows how to get ahold of Malfoy?” Potter demanded. The poor receptionist bit her lip.
“It’s getting late,” Harry commented as Draco tried to stifle a yawn. “We should both get to bed.”
Harry nodded, a little thrown off by Malfoy’s friendliness.
As attractive as he was, the fact remained that Draco Malfoy was up to something, and Harry needed to figure out what. He should ask something about Draco’s work, but he’d barely understood what he’d said about it last week. Perhaps clarification on what his job actually was would be a good place to start.
He replayed the conversation in his head, only to realise that he hadn’t actually agreed. Malfoy had just assumed he was amenable and ran off. He tried to squash the small part of him that found that level of confidence incredibly hot while debating whether he should actually show up for this date or not. The
“Look at the fishes!” Scorpius called one afternoon, hanging off of Harry’s arm as they admired a mural of street art.
Out of all the eventualities he had prepared for, having the door open to reveal a stern looking elderly man yelling at him in a language he didn't understand was not one of them. He thought for a moment that he'd gotten the wrong house, but then Camilla appeared in the hall, dressed in a beautiful green dress and looking at Harry apologetically.
“Ouch, sounds like you got cock-blocked, dude,” Joel said sympathetically to Bryan.
“Wrong! She didn’t predict anyone would be drafted, she went on a tangent about Squeaky Plimpies or something in the locker room showers.”
“How exactly do we announce to all your colleagues that we’re dating in a
"It's a reindeer," Harry explained. "They have lots of reindeer over there."
“Of course, you’re also more than welcome to come home,” he said gently. “I know you only found this place because Draco was being released. That whole spiel about wanting to learn to be independent was just an excuse, wasn’t it?” Scorpius had given Harry a very well rehearsed speech about growing up and learning life skills when he'd moved out, backed by his highly independent cousin. Harry had simple laughed at it at first, having heard almost the exact same speech from Teddy when
“It’s a
“Papa! Look at me, I’m the captain of the ship!” Scorpius called out. Draco smiled at him.
"You're beautiful," he said. "And so kind. You deserve better than me."
“Ready to finalize everything, Harry?” she asked as she handed him a folder.
“It was about the Transfiguration attacks. It was disappointing to see that Mr Selpie would sink to such low tactics for petty revenge, he graduated only a few years ahead of you and was a bright student. The press didn’t mention who worked on the case, only that it was complicated. But I had complete faith that you’d figure it out.”
“They’ve been best friends for years. Did their Potions Mastery together.”
“Don’t laugh! I was right, wasn’t I? You were up to something! Granted, I thought it was something more sinister, like experiments on unsuspecting patients.” He backtracked quickly when Draco gave him a horrified look. “Well I know
“So you became an Auror, and reopened my case?” his papa said, in a clear bid to change the topic. Scorpius nodded, gesturing to his cloak.
“Awesome,” Teddy grinned. He grabbed another handful of Pepper Imps.
“No wonder you didn’t want to wake up this morning,” Draco sighed. Harry looked up to find him leaning against the door to his office, looking exhausted. “Scorpius, I’m going to borrow Harry for a few minutes, and then you can continue talking his ear off.” Harry couldn’t help grinning at the fondness that always came through whenever Draco exaggerated about his son. He followed Draco into his office and watched as he collapsed into his chair.
“Well St Mungo’s has an Owlery, doesn’t it? The problem with the Ministry is that it’s underground, so keeping owls for external mail isn’t a very feasible idea. The Ministry has a Post Department that collects the post from every department and sends it out through the local Owl Office. Unfortunately, that costs money, so the Post Department keeps track of how many letters are sent by each department, and charges them for it at the end of the month.”
“I… I owe you an apology too,” Draco said reluctantly. He’d been avoiding the topic, but his time in Azkaban had given him a lot of time to think, and he’d come to the inevitable conclusion. “I should have told you what was happening. I should have trusted that you’d be able to help me. I was a fucking idiot who was too proud to ask for help, and it ruined my life. It ruined
"So if the egg got stuck, how did you get it out?" Scorpius asked curiously.
“That was awful!” Harry groused as soon as they were seated. “How dare she treat you like that.”
"Won't your parents be joining us?" he asked, smiling at the elder couple. Camilla looked stunned for a moment, before turning and explaining the situation to her parents. They both looked stunned as well, before her mother reached out and pinched Harry's cheek.
Harry,
“So I was the consequence of not completing the goal? I guess the goal was to create polyjuice with Dad’s hair.”
"Really?" Scorpius' eyes widened. "Did you get to pet one? Did you meet Santa?"
“To Hogwarts!” Scorpius exclaimed. “Wait,” he added with a frown. “Can you sail to Hogwarts?”
“Human to animal Transfigurations are illegal,” she pointed out. “Not to mention incredibly difficult to do.”
There was something else that was niggling at Scorpius’ mind. Why hadn’t Draco told Harry, or anyone else, that he was being threatened? Surely they would have been able to keep Scorpius safe, since Harry was such an influential figure. It didn’t seem like something his papa would do, to simply lay down and let criminals get away with their devious plans—and suddenly it clicked.
“I’ll check on you tomorrow,” Draco promised. Harry nodded, and with that, Draco turned and stepped into the Floo.
"This looks like a pretty nice hotel," Bryan mused. "The nicer ones usually have common potions at the reception desk, and complimentary breakfast. I can go down and ask if you want?"
Harry grimaced. “I don’t… it wasn’t the recipe. Growing up, he missed you a lot, and I wasn’t very good about it. I let my anger get the best of me, and I didn’t support him the way I should have. He spent years scared and confused, not knowing what had happened to you.”
They stopped in a small town where they purchased richly embroidered ceremonial robes and bright coloured makeup for Harry. They also picked up a selection of feathers and beads, which Hassan explained were all necessary items for the contest. He then introduced Harry to his friend, Daneri, who was a member of the tribe and therefore privy to their secret meeting place. Daneri didn’t speak a lot of English, so Hassan spent the rest of the ride translating as they discussed the Yaake ritual, which would be happening that afternoon.
Because when it boiled down to it, that was exactly what his father had done. He’d been part of a scheme trying to make it look like Harry Potter had murdered the Minister for Magic. How had Draco been able to do that to Harry? They’d seemed so in love back then, and by all accounts that Scorpius had ever heard, they had been. So when had Draco decided to betray Harry like that?
“If that’s Teddy’s room,” Draco said slowly, “and that’s Scorpius’ room… did you build a fourth bedroom?”
Draco nodded. "You had a ceremony at their church, and a party to celebrate, because according to their religious beliefs, you and Camilla got married. In their eyes, you both are as good as husband and wife. To have that marriage recognised by their ministry, however, they would have had to complete a fair amount of documentation, especially since you're English. From what I gather, they were planning to do that at their own pace after the ceremony. To them, that didn't matter much. In fact, I'm willing to bet that if they hadn't planned to make you a co-owner of their shop, they wouldn't have bothered with the legal aspect at all."
Harry rolled his eyes but didn’t argue. He knew he wasn’t going to get anywhere anyway. Instead he bade them goodnight when they reached the main road where they parted ways. As he made his way home, he considered for a moment that it was getting colder these days , and a knit scarf might actually be nice to have. Then he shook his head and refocused his thoughts on the important issue—regardless of what Ron and Hermione thought, he needed to find more proof of what Malfoy was up to.
Harry made his way down to the cafeteria, scoping out an empty table in the corner and settling down with his sandwiches. He took a satisfying bite of his tuna egg salad before taking out the menu and scrutinising it once again. The menu was in French, but it had English descriptions under each item. He vaguely remembered Fleur during the Triwizard Tournament when he read
Head Auror Clearwater nodded at Scorpius as she made her way across the courtroom.
“They’re all dirty.”
“Especially against such a powerful sorcerer.”
who did an amazing job investigating the case and compiling the evidence. I merely had to present it.”
Draco shook his head. “I usually just spend the afternoon reading until Scorpius is done with work.”
Harry wished he could give it to Scorpius in person, just to see the excitement on his face, but he found he didn’t mind the idea of Draco telling him all about it either.
There was something about Draco enjoying his cooking that suddenly made Harry feel proud. Hoping he didn’t have some sappy look on his face, he turned his attention back to the stove, giving the stroganoff he was making a good stir.
They found Harry’s friends at their usual table. He received a couple of raised eyebrows and confused stares—he’d only told Hermione and Ron that he was seeing Draco, after they’d interrogated him about why they’d danced together at the Gala. He’d warned the others that he was bringing someone he’d been seeing, but obviously none of them had expected
"She has a condition though."
Scorpius hesitated—it was only 11 in the morning, and tea could only prolong this interview. But something niggling at his brain told him that humouring this man would solve the case sooner rather than later, and anyways, those biscuits looked delicious.
“I… this wasn’t my fault, Dad. Anyway, I wouldn’t have said anything if he hadn’t interrupted our conversation and started insulting my boss.”
Draco gave him a knowing smile, understanding immediately why the country would appeal to Harry so much. There was no way he could accidentally get married in a country where the customs were so similar to theirs, and where everyone spoke English. Scorpius, not knowing that Harry had been married and divorced three times now, didn’t get the joke, though.
“Exactly. But because Healer Stibbons wasn’t the one to Transfigure her in the first place, his intrinsic magic had no record of what her original state had been. Thus, she was Transfigured into whatever he was consciously thinking consisted of a human child at the time. Since he likely didn’t know about this principle, he probably wasn’t thinking of every single component in her body, which created an incomplete child.”
“Don’t be,” Harry soothed. “That’s all in the past. They’re excited to meet you tonight.”
take this one. I’ll oversee processing the signatures and everything if you want, I just don’t want to have to see him.”
“Well, I was just wondering, what do
“Is there anything else you need?” Harry asked as he wrapped up the remaining casserole and put it back in the fridge. He was both relieved and disappointed that this awkward lunch was over.
He broke off as someone cleared their throat. Scorpius and Smith both turned to find Harry Potter standing there, looking angrier than Scorpius had seen him in ages.
"Muggles?" Hassan asked curiously, clearly not recognising the word.
They sat down in the front row, though the trip there was not a smooth one. It seemed that everyone in the church wanted to meet him. He guessed it must have something to do with him being an outsider, and simply smiled and nodded as Camilla's father apparently introduced him to the entire community. Finally, they were seated, with two empty chairs on Harry's other side. He turned in his seat to glance around, finding that most of the church already seemed to be full. He thought about putting his scarf, or his outer robes, over the two chairs next to him to save them for Camilla and her mother, but at that moment he noticed them coming in. Camilla looked stunning, wearing a lacy white dress that came to her knees and a pink rose in her hair. She smiled at him, taking his hand as she sat down next to him. Harry glanced at her parents, but they didn't seem to mind, so he relaxed and just let the ceremony flow around him.
Draco nodded, taking a seat next to Harry. Scorpius declared that he was going to sit with his "new friend" and ran around the table to clamber up next to Bryan. Harry had to hold back a laugh; Bryan looked incredibly out of his depth dealing with a five year old child. As Draco pulled a bunch of documents and a quill out of his briefcase, Harry made up a plate for Scorpius, who was quick to detail the exact specifications of what type of sandwich and which toppings he liked best.
“I… okay.” His stuttering only seemed to amuse her.
“Bryan, you know we couldn’t have had anything long term, right? I mean, I live in another country!”
Harry seemed to perk up at having either Teddy or Scopius over for dinner every other day. He quickly fell back into his routine of mothering them, constantly asking them how they were doing, checking that they weren’t being overworked, and if they were eating well.
Harry thought back, but couldn't remember signing anything other than his hotel bill.
Draco looked stunned.
“Him. And yes, of course. He loves it.”
He must have been staring at her for too long, because her expression slowly started to shift from amused to concern.
“During the original hearing, it was established that my client brewed Polyjuice Potion as part of a plot for a known terrorist group to infiltrate the Ministry and kill the Minister. While my client did brew the potion, it was originally ignored that he was coerced into doing so. Furthermore, the court was not informed of his attempt to foil the assasination plan and attempted terrorist coup by modifying the Polyjuice Potion. The lack of intent, as well as the deliberate intervention, demonstrate that Mr. Malfoy was clearly not a terrorist, nor that he was actively supporting the attack. For this reason, we request that all charges of terrorism be removed from Mr. Malfoy’s record.”
"Scorpius, did you say thank you for your new toy? Harry didn't have to get us anything, it was really nice of him to bring that for you."
“And I know you still love him too.”
“That’s not true. There’s a five-year-old sitting in that outer office who talks about you all the time, and not because you’ve bought him a couple of presents. I already spoil him rotten; he has all the toys in the world. No, what’s special about you is that you care enough about him to stop and talk with him, and in doing so you show him the respect and dignity that most adults never do, either because of his age or because of his family. And if the word of that five-year-old isn’t enough, I happen to know that his father will also vouch for the fact that you’re a very good friend to have, and completely worth knowing.”
“Together or separate?” she asked, moving towards the register. Draco slid two Galleons over to her without saying anything—more than enough to cover both their meals—but rather than waiting for the change, he leaned forward to try to pick up the precarious bowl. Draco pulled his hand back suddenly—the bowl must have been very hot.
“Harry! Wake up!”
“What happened here?” Scorpius asked curiously. His cousin’s office and lab were both meticulous most days. Something about tripping hazards around volatile potions, which made sense, but was also the reason Scorpius had never cared for potions. He couldn’t be bothered to keep things so clean.
“See, everything works out.”
would at least make great memories and hilarious stories for him to take home. He smiled at his host, who was waiting eagerly for his answer.
“My question, to this day, is why. Why did he do it? I thought it was money at first, but the terrorist group who was behind the attack never transferred anything to his account, or mine. Some people suggested it was political, but that doesn’t make sense either—he voted for that Minister. I even sometimes wonder if he was threatened. But I’m sure he would have told me if that had been the case. He would have let me help him.”
“Oh yeah, that restaurant menu was also mixed up in the pages,” Hermione pointed out. “Are you planning to go there?”
“You probably inherited some talent as well,” Teddy added. “I’ve always noticed that kids whose parents were good Quidditch players were pretty talented themselves.”
"Congratulations, love," Harry said softly. "I'm so proud of you."
“Really? Then who did Luna predict will be drafted as the Tornados’ next Seeker?”
Yours,
“Are you serious?” Harry grumbled. “You want
"Okay, I think it's time to find a primary school for you, Mister. You're like a sponge—sitting here is doing you no good whatsoever."
Agent Delta pulled out a sheet of parchment and started to write. If there was a way, they knew exactly who would find it.
"Your mouth said those words, but I don't think your heart means it. You are not feeling good about your looks. Participating in the festival will, I think, make you feel more confident. Performing with the others, participating in competitions, and ceremonies, all this will show you that you are a good man."
Scorpius didn’t push the issue, as much as he wanted to. He was starting to understand that loving someone and hating them weren’t mutually exclusive.
“Wait. You don’t mean… is this about Draco?”
Harry sat back and simply enjoyed the view, taking the opportunity to ask his host questions as they occurred to him. As they drove, Hassan explained to Harry that the magical and muggle community were not as segregated here as they were in most other countries. While the muggles, or moldus as Hassan insisted on calling them, were not quite aware of the existence of magic, they didn't follow all the guidelines of the international statute of secrecy.
"Would they want to come with us?" Harry tried, even though he really didn't want to be toting Camilla's parents around the city, as nice as they were. She laughed at his suggestion, explaining that someone would still have to be here to run the shop.
“You haven’t had breakfast yet, have you?” Scorpius sighed.
Agent Delta stopped to collect their thoughts before stepping into the Floo. They had to remember that they were once an intern as well, and that everyone had to start somewhere. There were worse things than having to commute between offices because the charm linking them had failed.
And scoop cold water from the lake,
Draco thought about that. The last seven years had been absolutely miserable, but after this week, things were looking up. He could honestly say he was on his way to being completely happy with his life. If that was really all his mother had wanted for him…
“Seriously though, I’m glad someone’s looking into this. Were these his modifications?”
"Yes, we hear about war there. Pappa ask, which side they on?" She sounded hesitant, as if she really didn't want to be asking. Harry had a horrible moment where he wondered if this family had been Voldemort sympathisers.
He put an arm around Harry’s shoulder, and Harry felt himself relax a bit. He’d got defensive about their jokes, but if he was being honest, his friends probably had a fair point. Draco had always been at the forefront of his mind at school, not unlike how things were these days.
“I’m glad you’re going to be working at Hogwarts,” Luna said serenely as Draco sat next to her once again. “You’ll do a good job of dispelling the Wrackspurts in anxious students. You do remember how to deal with them, right?”
Harry soon noticed that they were drawing the attention of other families in the area, but since Scorpius didn’t seem to mind, neither did he. He watched happily as Scorpius called instructions to Draco, who was looking highly annoyed with all the sand, but even more determined to make his son happy. Every time he looked up and acknowledged Scorpius’ instructions, he made sure to have a big smile on his face, and would follow the directions without hesitating, even if they were clearly sending him astray. Harry couldn’t help wondering how few people ever got to see this loving and caring side of Draco, the one that cherished his son so much that he’d put aside his comfort and his dignity just to make him smile. Feeling privileged to be allowed to witness it, Harry smiled along as well.
Without warning, Camilla suddenly threw herself at Harry, giving him a bone crushing hug. He spared a moment to wonder if the spoon was enchanted, or coated in amortentia, or something similar, because she was suddenly being very affectionate. Thankfully, a pointed cough from her father made her let go almost immediately, but she still sat shyly next to Harry while her parents kept talking to each other. Finally, they all stood up, and Camilla pulled Harry up with her.
“No thank you,” Harry said decisively. “I’ve already told you hundreds of times that I’m not interested in being set up with anyone.”
“Scorpius?”
"Prayer," she said simply. Harry wondered why no one else in the church was coming up to the front. Maybe it was because he was the newcomer?
“Why did you want to become a Healer then, if it’s so complicated?”
“It’s been great. I really wish I could spend more time at home though. It feels like work is keeping me out later and later every day. I’m thinking of taking a few days off, just so that I can actually spend time with Papa.”
Draco pulled a small vial from his pocket and tipped the hair into the cauldron. The potion turned a pure gold.
“Do you know of any good pitches?” Teddy asked. “I can’t remember the last time I went to a public pitch.”
Anyway, thanks for being there. At first, I thought our ruse would simply be useful misdirection, but your presence helped calm me down.
“Do you even know which department he’s in?” Potter asked skeptically.
To that end, Geoffrey has invited me to lunch this afternoon to discuss the project further. It will be him, his wife Ellen, (who I find truly insufferable), and myself. Would it be too much to ask if you wanted to accompany me? It’s just—I’m nervous about cocking this up and also having someone to keep me from smacking Ellen would be good. I could see if perhaps Pansy is free, but
Head Auror Clearwater flipped the pictures over again, sliding them across the table so that Scorpius could see the words clearly.
“Papa! Oh no, you’re wet, but you’re not wearing trunks!” Scorpius called, trying to paddle himself out of Harry’s arms and over to his father. Trying his best not to laugh at Draco’s expression, Harry towed Scorpius back to the deck and helped him climb up next to his father.
Teddy’s hair turned green, the way it always did when he was gearing up for a speech on potion’s theory.
to him. Funnily enough, the displays he loved the most were the ones for children’s bedrooms, or kitchens and bathrooms adapted to suit families. He knew it was irrational of him to like those styles—he was a bachelor (or at least he would be once Draco returned) and he should be exploring sleek, modern and practical styles. Most of the sales people showed him rich blues, deep browns and warm reds.
“That’s where I am now. I actually called because I need a favour.”
Draco’s heart plummeted as he looked at his son’s face.
"Delisos?" she asked, clearly not recognising the word.
His last letter was to Harry. He stared at the parchment for at least 20 minutes, unsure what to write. There was so much to say, and yet there were no appropriate words to say it. He finally put it aside, deciding that he could finish it later. He left the stack of completed letters on the table next to his breakfast dishes and made his way into the guest room to pack up the clothes. Now that he could afford clothes for himself, he didn't see the need to sell the beautiful pieces Pansy had made for him, and so he wrapped them all carefully in the garment bags they had come with. He wouldn't get much opportunity to wear them, and he was sure he'd have to ward his apartment very carefully to prevent his neighbours from stealing them, but it would be worth it to hold onto the beautiful memories (and it would make Pansy incredibly happy).
“But where are we going?” Scorpius countered.
“You’re really not mad at me?”
Harry was a surprisingly competent dance partner—he danced like he flew, with power and grace. Draco asked when he’d learned ballroom dancing, but didn’t pay attention to the answer. The magical signature felt strong again, and Draco couldn’t help glancing about once more, trying to gauge if anyone nearby looked particularly guilty.
Bryan shrugged. “I guess not. How old are you again, 23?”
“Agent Phi has worked with the patient before, they already knew that financial records would be relevant. I had to do the investigating to figure that out! I wouldn’t be one step behind if they’d just shared their findings with me.”
“This was an old code used among Neo-Death eaters to threaten people.
When Scorpius arrived at his desk the next morning, it was to find Teddy sitting in his chair and devouring his stash of Pepper Imps.
things wrong with what you just said. Why did they release him?”
“Those are some thick files,” Head Auror Clearwater commented as he sat down at his desk again. He hadn’t even noticed her watching him.
Harry laughed. "Well then I'll make sure not to bring any back for you."
Agent Eta gave Agent Delta the same disapproving look from the pub.
“Aren’t you a little young to get married?” Harry asked, trying his best not to wince at the mention of marriage. After all, he was only here talking to this sweet child because of his disastrous failure of a wedding.
Harry sighed, summoning all his courage and blurting "I accidentally got married!"
At first I thought it might have been because of a time constraint, you know, they had to get in and out pretty quickly. But Silverthorn’s Polyjuice wore off
“Oh. That… actually makes sense.”
Luna’s head snapped up at the mention of animals. She often spent their pub nights knitting rather than participating in the conversation, but creatures usually snagged her attention pretty effectively.
Her expression softened immediately at the mention of Harry. For a moment, he allowed himself to miss the security of being so rich that no one ever questioned your actions.
“It’s not fine!” Harry wasn’t sure why he was getting so worked up about this. There was a time when he would have loved to see his rival treated so badly. It wasn’t like he and Draco were friends—they’d only been on two dates, after all. Harry hated seeing prejudice like this, though. He hadn’t fought in the war for people to continue discriminating against each other.
Agent Phi shrugged. “I asked the same thing. He seemed to think that would be too tricky. He was hoping he would get called in to handle the creatures, and that he could discretely Transfigure them back after removing them from view of everyone else.”
