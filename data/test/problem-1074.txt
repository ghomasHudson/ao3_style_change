“I like it.”
The three decided to ignore the professor, and now that that was out of the way, as well as their nervousness from earlier, the emotional vacuum left made room for crippling reality checks. The rest of the meal passed with nervous breakdowns and an intervention. Neville had a small crisis when it sunk in that he’s Slytherin, something his grandmother won’t be happy about in the least. While Ursa rubbed Neville’s shoulders, his head in his hands, Draco and her passed a piece of parchment back and forth discussing what things they can throw together for him by the time a howler might come in the morning. First years got escorted to their common room in the dungeons by the prefects, and the Slytherins obediently followed behind the intimidating upperclassmen.
Ursa Potter, by no fault of her own, was horribly, irrevocably, and inextricably lost. Dappled light filtered in from the glass ceiling of King's Cross, and it struck her hand as it wound its way into her equally lit up curly mane of espresso hair, turned a rusty gold by the sunlight. She stood still among the bustling adults, half their size and seemingly with half their wit, unable to think of how to get to Platform 9¾. Panic ebbed in her chest, Hagrid abandoned her with no clue of where to go and that muggle officer denied the existence of the platform entirely. The whistles from surrounding trains sounded ceaselessly, and that annoyance combined with her crow’s antics served to put her in an even worse mood than the morning.
“Make me—OW!”
“I know! But I don’t want to be sneaky with Ursa and Draco, I feel like I’ll come out of it crying and with significantly shorted self esteem,” Neville moaned.
“How did they ‘stumble’ on a troll? They defied the single order we gave them and thought they were powerful enough to bring the beast down, arrogance at its finest, typical for a Potter,” Snape scoffed.
“‘Aren’t really’?” Draco’s eyebrow seemed to raise a little higher. The boy sighed.
“No one needs it, I want it,” She hissed, opening her book.
“Good evening, sir,” She smiled, turning away from her work. Despite the stutter, Ursa really liked Professor Quirrell. His class was pretty tame but he didn’t have the same bias towards magic that other teachers had.
“There’s my uncle, Severus,” Draco pointed out to the other two, partially as a distraction for Neville, and Ursa followed his line of sight to a rather sour looking man. His face was pinched in what she could only guess was a mixture of pure, unadulterated exasperation and frustration as he eyed the trio. Draco had expressed his idolization of the man many times, and she knew that he’s the reason he wants to be a Potions Master. They didn’t dwell on Snape’s clear disapproval much, as the sorting had begun, but Ursa mentally clocked out after “Abbot”.
The first years all gathered back at the school once the boat ride over the lake finished, and as a group collectively ignored the three sopping wet members among them. Ursa, Draco, and Neville were thoroughly soaked and left a snail trail of water throughout the school to the Great Hall.
“I don’t think so, no,” Ursa lied, “Though I haven’t been paying attention, admittedly.” Ursa had seen several unnatural ripples and bubbles, likely something from the deep curious about the boats and student’s chatter. However, Neville is looking rather green.
“You should see Weasley,” Draco grinned. Ursa took a peek at the Gryffindor table and saw Weasley sporting a split lip, a bruising eye, and his hair was a bright shade of yellow. She rolled her eyes.
“Gross,” Draco sniffed, kicking the carcass a little with his toe, checking to make sure it won’t react.
“Not worth the effort to mention them by any favorable distinctions,” Ursa sniffed.
Ursa looked over, and lo and behold, the Gryffindor girl was staring shamelessly, her eyes widened when their gazes met. Ursa smiled and waved at her, and it had the intended effect of scaring her, but unfortunately it spooked her enough that when her partner Granger bumped her she jumped back into her bushy-haired partner and knocked all the contents from her hands.
“Of course we have a library, we have several, does this look like a home of Weasley’s?” Draco quipped back.
“I thought this class was for the defense against, Professor?” Ursa asked.
“What?” Neville asked, on the opposite side of the table. Ursa glared at Draco for being a mother hen, and he glared back for Ursa eating like a newborn chick.
“Yes, good evening,” She said and paused, ““Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room. The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours. The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school.” *(quoted from the
“We aren’t supposed to stand!” Neville was panicking, and he grabbed Ursa’s wrist tightly.
“They are simple to better contrast the handsome features of the wearer,” Draco said, smugly, and Ursa didn’t appreciate the implication of that statement.
“They broke the rules and separated from their classmates, actively hunted a troll, and ruined school property,” Snape complained, and Ursa’s opinion of him sank even lower. Ursa decided it was time to find out just how flammable his oily hair is.
“Slytherin!”
It was the last gift Ursa wasn’t expecting. There were one too many presents by her trunk, and she’s not sure who else would send her anything. She delicately pulled apart the simple wrapping in a reversal of the process it was put on, and was almost surprised to see even more books. Ursa was suddenly very glad she bought an expansion for the section of her trunk that held books.
“Are these our peers? Merlin, even
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re so weird, genuinely.”
“I wonder what the greenhouses look like,” Neville said, on the other side of Ursa. She vocally agreed with him as a fellow Herbology nerd. Ursa enjoys gardening, Aunt Petunia’s backyard bed being her pride and joy, so therefore gardening mixed with magic
“Brown! Granger! Detention with me, tonight,” Snape snapped.
“That’s it?” Ursa asked.
“Who?” Ursa asked, stirring her potion counterclockwise, grinning madly.
Despite the grisly murder of her parents, Ursa loved Halloween, or Samhain as she’s come to recognize it. There was always a spooky themed Halloween pageant somewhere, and those were Ursa’s favorite costumes/dresses to wear. Today, however, she felt sick, but she couldn’t quite pin down
“Second year is going to be a mess, I can already tell,” Neville moaned again.
“Should I?”
He asked again, genuinely confused.
(See the end of the chapter for
she felt sick, or even
Several flights of mobile stairs later and the dungeons were reached, the two only went down one hallway before Draco grabbed Ursa’s hand, slowed them down so they fell a little behind, and darted off when it looked like no one was paying attention. They ran and ran through halls to the bathroom, and the pressure in Ursa’s head increased, the adrenaline being the only thing keeping her conscious.
Ursa spent the morning reading a book she took off a shelf in his office, comfortably splayed across the chair at his desk while he worked.
idk it made sense in my head
narrator: it will not be fine
“Wow, that’s actually an improvement, what a shame,” Draco sighed morosely, but couldn’t contain a smirk seeing a vein throb in Weasley’s temple.
“Very good, Mr. Malfoy, Ms. Potter, Ms. Bones, would you mind helping your surrounding classmates?” Professor Flitwick asked, Draco and Ursa shared a look of mutual disinterest and instead used the charm to toss an ink jar back and forth to each other, the one who let it drop first has to carry around the other’s school supplies. If Professor Flitwick had an issue with their antics, he didn’t express it.
“It’s difficult to apply.”
“Run over there, quickly!” He shouted and Ursa started running towards the far corner of the bathroom, hoping she could get there before the giant, albeit slow as molasses, troll pushed its way through the obstacle course it caused and reached them.
“Like,
“So what you’re saying is homicide is an option?” Ursa asked, and Professor Quirrell laughed.
don’t have to,” He countered, rolling around on her sheets.
“And what dominates the Ministry? The Light. More and more muggleborns work for the Ministry, and muggleborns are always light, which wouldn’t be bad, if it weren’t the fact that the brainchild we’re developing here is probably correct,” Draco rolled his eyes, “Hey, where the hell is Neville, I need to know his opinion on th—“
anywhoo enjoy :)
“If I wasn’t, do you think I’d be standing here like a lost child? Just show me the way and gloat on the train, I know you’re dying to.”
They all went back to their respective houses after dinner, and the five Slytherins hung out in the common room finishing up homework assignments. Ursa was reading against Draco, and Draco seemed to be taking a break from homework to play with her necklace, using the gem at the end as a means to fidget.
“Yeah, and now we both have detention for two weeks,” Draco scoffed, starting to pick at his food, “At least we have them with different teachers, I think I’d kill myself before spending that much quality time with Weaselby.”
“What’s your name?” Ursa asked, the answer deciding her next few words.
“I noticed you’re making friends outside your house.”
“Merlin, I thought
“Fine, I’m done, happy?”
“REDUCTO!” Ursa put as much power as she could into the spell, and tipped her wand slightly to the right. The chunk of marble collided with  her reducto, and the explosion, aimed slightly to the right, propelled what was left of the chunk at the troll, nailing it in the temple. The troll stumbled, had it been a larger piece of ammunition it would’ve gone down, and Draco immediately picked up on that.
“I heard we’re doing the levitation spell today,” Neville told them, his voice full of excitement to finally start some practical magic.
“I understand,” Professor Quirrell finally sighed, the hollow eternity she waited for him to speak again blurred the words of her books and kept her focus captive.
LEVIOSA!
“Longbottom, Neville,” McGonagall shouted after what felt like forever, and Ursa perked up finally hearing a name she cared about. Neville looked like he was on death row and marching in front of the firing squad. He sat down, and Ursa and Draco grimaced seeing how pale and clammy he looked.
“You’re shitting me,” Draco said beside her.
“Really?” Ursa asked, glad to not have to deal with Snape.
Potions was a mixed bag. On one hand, Ursa finally got her wish of having practical lessons instead of lectures, but Snape was about as pleasant as an itchy mosquito bite. Truly, she wondered how Draco’s parents, who seem quite lovely, could stand being around the man enough to trust their son’s well being with him should something happen to them. Ursa and Neville were the only two Slytherins he disliked, and Snape made it painfully obvious in the most passively malicious methods he could. Greengrass, Parkinson, and even Goyle got points for breathing right, but she was lucky if he managed to look her direction without appearing nauseous.
“That’s it, Malfoy—!” Weasley charged, clenched fist raised.
can, then
Ursa put on her school clothes: a puffy, white, silk blouse, a Slytherin green tie, a black skirt, and black tights along with some cute black flats, her robes, and her bag. Ursa ran down to the common room five minutes before breakfast, running a hand through her hair in slight distress, a fleeting moment of joy and amusement passed when she felt her already wild hair stick up and fluff worse than usual. She immediately flattened it again, horror-struck that she had the audacity to tempt perfection without a mirror nearby.
In the end, that’s what did her in. Her steel-plated resolve reduced to sand in the face of Draco Malfoy’s persistent hands, and she almost enjoyed watching him dig through it to reach her.
“...But I want to,” Ursa shrugged, glaring at him for getting far too comfortable with her mattress.
“Would you like another for later?” He asked, and Ursa turned back to him, shocked.
“The students were aware of the danger and were able to overcome it with a Slytherin-like determination and had t cunning to think fast against a larger foe, that’s commendable, however, never do it again,” Dumbledore said with a tone of finality, and the trio nodded their heads.
“We have Charms and Herbology with Hufflepuff, History of Magic and Transfiguration with Ravenclaw, and then the Flying Lessons with Gryffindor again,” Neville said, “Why are we with Gryffindor more than the others?”
A long speech about house expectations soon followed, and Ursa was about ready to defect to Hufflepuff. Keep fighting in the common room, don’t curse other students, or at least don’t get caught, if you have issues go to Professor Snape and Professor Snape only, etc. They were shown a board that keeps track of tutors if you need one, Snape’s office hours, a note with the password when it changes, book recommendations, and spells that might come in handy. They were then directed to where the dorms were, separated by year and gender. While not warm or inviting, the Slytherin common room immediately felt like home to Ursa.
Not yet.
“Kind of,” Was all Ursa offered. Draco grabbed her wrist again and walked between the labyrinth of shelves, this Minotaur of emotion between them ducking behind books as they floated, unaware, to the single chaise lounge before a window. The shelves were tall and imposing, but the large window, stained orange by the evening sun, warmed their sides and their shadows became less cold. Draco sniffed, noting the dust polluting the area in front of the window, determined to speak to a house elf about it.
Padma got her some fictional novels, as well as a couple textbooks on defensive magic and healing arts. Ursa bought Padma a figurine of her favorite quidditch player, as well as some fancy butterfly hair clips that were spelled to stay still in your hair, so that you wouldn’t have to fix them throughout the day.
“Don’t even, I swear to Merlin,” Draco moaned and leaned his head back, and Ursa cackled, her contagious laughter startling the others who soon joined.
“So, what house are you hoping for?” She asked Neville, not wanting to make the poor thing needlessly uncomfortable.
“Because I want to.”
The older Malfoys weren’t present, Draco suspected for some new development in their evil scheme to dominate Magical Britain. Or whatever else adults do, he figured. They only mentioned to him in passing that an old business partner wishes to rekindle their friendship and loyalty, and he couldn’t be concerned enough to prod further into it.
“Yes, that’s what the closets are for, stupid.”
“I know, I just find myself liking people who have the potential to network me into a position of power.”
The warm, orange toned, morning sun filtered through the window and illuminated the free falling dust surrounding her, like specks of gold from a crown not yet formed. Her head was angled towards the book on the table and her elbow propped to support her head, looking the perfect student. Tom Riddle exhaled, and watched a younger version of himself gently turn the page, its significance to the library microscopic but the importance of the book to her, and every book on that stack he gave to her, made it priceless. He leaned back in his chair, and started reading his own book, careful not to let his shadow block the light she needed to read. Something about the scene felt sad, the naive resemblance of their personalities made his heart feel heavy. The library remained silent other than the occasional scratch of a quill, its user desperate to retain the knowledge given to her through these books, and by extension her favorite adult. The only words exchanged in this period was when it ended, the professor mentioned it was time to eat and she followed him to the Great Hall.
“DIFFINDO!” Ursa screamed, pointing her wand at the arm of the troll that’s about to swing its club. The spell gave the troll the equivalent of a paper cut.
“Potter! Detention as well. I want the three of you at that door by seven, now everyone—get out!” Snape yelled, and everyone scrambled to leave the classroom.
“It’s culture erasure, Ursa, and I find it disgusting,” He scoffed as they sat down.
Draco looked beside him and saw the peaceful expression on her tan face, lips pulled back slightly in the spirit of a smile, eyes closed and directed towards the sun. He turned forwards suddenly, cheeks pink, and suddenly felt like he intruded on a private moment, or witnessed something he wasn’t meant to. However, the crowd in front of him immediately turned dull, the sight of it encouraging him to look back at the much more appealing sight of Ursa’s freckles, prominent, down-turned nose, and pouty lips. Soft-looking lips, Draco thought, and then immediately turned forward again, face sporting a shameful burgundy. This was strange, he continued, he doesn’t consider Neville anywhere near as much as he does Ursa.
“Stop being worried about me.”
“That’s certainly an option,” Quirrell remarked, “But come, let’s get you back to your dorm so you can sleep, your magical signature is suffocating in here, so I assume you put quite the draining punch behind your spells.”
“It would seem you’re correct.”
“If you can’t read it just mark it with a zero, I can’t be bothered with those papers,” the professor waved his hand in dismissal, and then started squinting at the parchment in his own hands.
Apparently her interest in dark magic was communicated to the entire school in a matter of hours, and the general consensus agreed she was either a Death Eater in training, a sympathizer, or the next Dark Lord, and the latter was the more popular of the three. She couldn’t keep herself from cackling madly at random intervals of the day, just to spook other students. It was funny, at least Ursa thought it was, Neville disapproved and Draco all but bought a red carpet labeled “Dark Lord” for her to walk on. The red headed boy, Ronald Weasely, apparently took Professor Quirrell’s advice to mean that Ursa would personally curse him, and he’s started a campaign in Gryffindor against her.
“Well, they’re both kind of affectionate people?” Neville continued.
took forever to get ready,” Draco whined, getting up from the sofa when he noticed Ursa arrive, “You look fine, don’t worry about it and make us wait.”
“I’m aiming for Slytherin, although Ravenclaw wouldn’t be bad, the other two houses are alright but don’t align well with my values,” Ursa said, “We never introduced ourselves, did we? I’m Ursa Potter, and the pretentious ponce with Elmer’s glue-all for hair is Draco Malfoy.”
“So magic is dark if I want to hurt someone with it?” Draco joined, quick to back up Ursa and support her argument.
“M-Miss Po-Potter?”
“W-Well, I say twenty p-points from Sly-Slytherin for disobeying the rules,” Professor Quirrell started, “And tw-twenty points f-for bra-bravery and s-skill.”
“This little crush you’ve developed on Ursa here is truly laughable, she’s above your infatuation,” Draco consoled, his voice switching to a tone of disappointment and fake politeness. Ursa snorted in a very unbecoming manner beside the blond, Draco effectively ruined Weasley by making his hatred seem like a schoolyard crush. She cackled while Draco looked, his ego inflating seeing his successful attempt to lighten her mood.
“You clearly didn’t.”
“What started the fight?” Ursa asked, casually, seeing how pleased Draco was over his perceived victory made her want to continue the conversation.
“It’s impressively stupid,” She corrected, grinning.
“Why are you making this an issue?”
“Ye-Yes, when S-Snape men-men-mentioned the inc-in-incident, an-and the de-detentions, I off-offered to take-take over yours, sin-since he’s s-so busy I’m-I’m s-sure, s-should you wi-wish to have it w-with m-me,” He said, and she nearly cried from gratitude.
“You haven’t unpacked your stuff, either.”
“Shut up, Draco!” Snape hissed, and Ursa could
“Thank you for a sterling introduction, gutter trash,” Draco didn’t even look up from his book, “I’m also aiming for Slytherin, all the Malfoys have been Slytherin and so will I.”
“Weasley kept running his mouth, and decided to resort to primitive measures after I spelled his hair yellow,” Draco shrugged, “Apparently McGonagall was watching the class from her classroom office, noticed Weasley’s hair change colors, and rushed down to separate us.”
“Potter doesn’t deserve to have her name revered, she’s a slimy snake just like him,” Weasley said to Granger, and now Draco’s blood started rising in temperature.
“Merlin, fine, I’ll go first, would that make you happy?” He asked.
“Neville Longbottom,” he replied, and Draco nearly snorted before Ursa gave him a sharp look. A Longbottom sounds useful.
“I don’t know, you had me convinced,” Ursa shrugged, but couldn’t keep a straight face when his eyes shone with offense, “Now that you mention, your hair does look a little red in the light, maybe you have a common relative.
“You don’t seem to.”
personalities are all over the place, ngl. I want to make them seem like actual kids, ya know? and also show slytherins as more then just quiet, emotionless husks that get good jobs and are good at everything. I'm going to work more on establishing more concrete personalities with recurring habits, ticks, quirks, and tells that will make them into actual people.
“I will eat your books,” Draco hissed, and made a grab for her charmed pouch that housed today’s purchases, and she jumped back in retaliation. When Draco lunged again, Ursa took off down the hallway. Draco laughed, adrenaline consuming him as he chased his petite classmate, shouting directions when she reached the end of a hallway. Eventually they did manage to come by a library, after a couple flights of stairs and too many similar hallways for Draco to discern. Ursa turned around and sighed, still smiling, but the second Draco stopped, his knees almost gave in. Swallowing air at an alarming rate, he couldn’t help but admire Ursa, who barely looked winded.
The first on the stack was from Draco, whom she sent some silk, dark green-black, subtly iridescent robes she heard him sigh over not too long ago, as well as an enchanted ring fashioned to look like a dragon eating its tail. She is well aware of his love for dragons, and she thought the tail consumption was a fitting reminder for him, as sometimes him eating his own foot is more beneficial than him talking. Charms were put on it for protection from mild spells. He had gotten her a silver necklace with a crystal fashioned into it as well as matching earrings, a note in the parcel explained that it’s for protection, and the jewelry itself has countless charms and such within it. She put them on immediately. He had also sent her a magically preserved, rare flower encased in a glass orb, and she couldn’t stop from smiling when the sun’s rays struck the glass and refracted over the room in stunning, colorful specks.
“I’m not saying that,” Draco rolled his eyes, “You just wear it almost every day.”
“Uh, my grandmother wants me to go into Gryffindor,” Neville went a little pink with attention on him. Draco informed Ursa of Lady Augusta Longbottom’s personality when they briefly ran into her in Diagon Alley, and now Ursa felt a little pity for the boy.
She was endeavoring to put her robes away, removing them from her luggage case and hanging them carefully in the provided dressers and cabinets. Draco was sat upon the bed, doing school work, as she relinquished several more ties to the strict self-reliance that’s lasted her thirteen years. His parents gave them permission to go into Diagon Alley later today, and she couldn’t help but feel marginally excited to own more things. It felt vain, being so eager to spend, but for her it wasn’t the rush of shopping Pansy particularly enjoyed, or the need for clothing, it was a consuming urge to just hoard, have material wealth, claim something as her own. The more she had, the more she felt above the Dursley’s.
“At least then it’ll feel like someone’s listening,” Draco glared, and turned away from her. Ursa rolled her eyes.
“Potter, Ursa.” The hall began whispering. Ursa walked up to the dias with the stool and hat as gracefully as possible, trying to mimic Draco, and sat down with her shoulders squared.
“So, what kept you at Hogwarts over break?” He asked, sitting in a chair across from her and picking up a book from her stack.
Oops.
“TROLLS! IN THE DUNGEON!” Professor Quirrell screamed, shoving the Great Hall doors open with a surprising amount of force, barreling down the main aisle of the Great Hall and stopped in the center, “I thought you ought to know.”
For several minutes the three were quiet, appreciating the serenity of the peaceful, rocking boat under a crystal clear, star-filled night sky, Draco played with a loose strand of Ursa’s hair, only remarking once that she needed to tame her stubborn locks. Draco doesn’t concern himself with personal space, Ursa figured out.
“The space is meant to be taken, Ursa, that's the whole point of it.”
“Alright Professor McGonagall, the kids are yours,” Hagrid announced, the group coming to a stop in front of a large set of doors. Luckily for them, the previously mentioned curious creature was the school’s Giant Squid, harmless by all accounts, and it wasted no time snatching the three shrieking children from the dark water and dumping them on the shore.
“I mean, I don’t know if it’s dead-dead,” Ursa admitted, finally hopping off its back and inspecting the skull again.
“Wonderful!” Draco exclaimed from beside Ursa, and it didn’t escape her notice he was trying to subtly slide food onto her plate, not satisfied with whatever she’s already eaten.
“REDUCTO!”
“Shut up,” She rolled her eyes, her muscles going slack against him once he straightened his spine again, doubled over from a swift elbow to the gut. Comfortable once more, she turned back to her book, reading in warm silence, while Draco read over her shoulder. Hypothetically, he could just stand and grab a book for himself, but Ursa kept him grounded.
“Holy shit we’re stupid shit shit shit SHIT!” The two screamed again, dodging a piece of flying rubble. They screamed loud enough to get the ugly abomination’s attention this time.
“Good morning, Professor, I wanted to thank you for your gift.”
(See the end of the chapter for
‘In case those books in the library weren’t enough, but remember: you didn’t get these from me—Quirrell’ said the note attached, and Ursa gasped as she felt something electric buzz through her arm as her hand grasped a book. The feeling reminded her of thunderous weather on a dark, chilly day, watching lightning soar through the clouds from a tear-streaked window in an equally dark room. It didn’t feel warm, or bubbly, or any happy thing, but there was a terrible rightness that exuded from the leather-bound spines. She picked up the book and read the ancient, beaten cover, Darke Magick, and understood the need for Quirrell’s secrecy, and also understood the correctness she felt when her fingertips brushed stained paper. The other books, similarly old and decrepit, were of the same topic. Offensive and defensive dark magic, blood magic, curses that would definitely garner Azkaban time, and surprisingly a book on how to make poison from magical plants, Ursa smiled knowing he remembered her Herbology bias. Unlike the books in the library that are carefully worded to not provide any spells or rituals used by historically significant, morally ambiguous wizards, these books would fill in those blanks.
The Yule holidays were soon approaching, and unlike her fellow peers, it seems as though Ursa will be confined to the castle for a couple weeks. She seems the only member of Slytherin cursed with the lack of responsibility or drive to return home, as all her classmates eagerly discussed their Yule plans with each other. She didn’t mind, though, while she enjoys the presence of Neville and Draco, and the budding companionship of Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson, Susan Bones, and Padma Patil, she wouldn’t mind the break to just read and wander around. It’s been awhile since she truly had time to herself, maybe this break will be good for her.
“Looking pretty handsome yourself,” She quipped back, upper lip raised in a scowl, “I’m not sure why, I just feel so on edge, enough that it’s making me feel both exhausted and hyper. It doesn’t make sense, but I want to be anywhere but here, or something will go wrong.”
“What contrast?” She asked, innocently. Draco's mouth twisted into a scowl, and she felt immense delight.
“You scare me sometimes,” Pansy admitted, “I forget you’re quiet because all you do is people watch, you creep.”
The ceiling was a plain, stone gray color, and Ursa soon became intimately familiar with it. There were no distinguishable thoughts in her head, other than an estranged sense of disappointment that sounded a little like Aunt Petunia.
“How was your guys’ holiday?” Pansy asked, sporting a new, luxurious sweater and earrings. The group was sitting at the end of the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, their Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw friends joining them.
“Gross,” Ursa agreed.
“Why did I feel so miserable?” Ursa asked, looking up at Professor Quirrell, quite content that he could answer any question she asked him.
“Now you know why I don’t assign essays often,” he sighed, dropping the parchments in frustration and opening his desk. He pulled out a vial and swallowed its contents quickly.
the conversation in DADA was *heavily* inspired by “The Rise of a Dark Lord” by Little.Miss.Xanda on fanfiction/.net, it’s an amazing story and got me into my specific Harry Potter tastes lol
“AH!”
The estate was too much, it felt as though she was trespassing in the scene of a painting, tainting what made its eerie, untouched stillness desirable in the first place. They had peacocks in their front lawn, for Merlin’s sake.
“Of course, I’m the one that put them there,” Quirrell scoffed.
“See now, that’s fine, if you don’t want to celebrate then I think you’re weird but it’s whatever, but if you insist that it’s a muggle holiday when it’s been a wizard holiday for even longer and demand everyone celebrate that instead and follow your customs and deem the original customs and traditions ‘dark‘,
“A little,” Ursa admitted.
“U-Ursa!” Neville shrieked, latching onto her arm. He got nervous and kicked off too early, but he was too panicked to think straight and land again, so he kept rising and rising.
be interesting.
“I hate you.”
“Yeah!” Ursa shouted back, an inkling of what that plan Draco thought of soon realized.
“Y-You’re detention’s wi-with m-me now,” He announced, a warm smile on his face.
“You’re still not answering
“Great! Aunt and I spent most the weeks together, as she got a lot of time off work,” Susan exclaimed, and Ursa’s heart swelled a little seeing her wearing the jewelry she sent her.
“That bad?” He asked, and she looked past the tip of her book to see the potentially content expression from a minute prior gone.
“LEVIOSA!”
“And I could stab someone in the eye with a quill, but quills aren’t dark artifacts, are they?” Professor Quirrell seemed to agree with Ursa, and she took a weird, small amount of pride in that. “I believe what the Ministry uses to label the spell Dark is that you have to
Neville and Ursa headed back to the Great Hall to join the others for lunch. Neville was content with wearing a cast for a day, Ursa’s quick aid prevented him needing it for a week. The two walked into the Great Hall laughing, but Ursa immediately sobered seeing the state of Draco’s face.
“Do you think we need to set them up somehow? Like send them on a date into Hogsmead?”
Neville and Ursa mostly talked throughout the train ride, Draco warming up to Neville relatively quickly after a while of sulking. Neville and Ursa shared a love of plants and herbology, and that provided an olive branch to Draco who got to geek out about how plants are used in potions. The three tried some beginner charms, Neville not liking the idea of practicing hexes already, and they ate some candy Ursa bought from the trolley. The evening halcyon haze casted in the compartment warmed Draco, Ursa, and Neville’s features, Neville’s expressive hand gestures talking almost as much as he was, and the golden sun spotlighted Draco’s easy, sightly grin. Ursa leaned back in her seat, letting the deep satisfaction saturate her bones until not a single muscle was tensed.
“Wear what?”
“Sorry,” Ursa apologized, insincerely, turning to face Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Professor Flitwick, Professor Sprout, and Professor Quirrell, the latter looking very conscious, “Neville was in the bathroom when the troll announcement was made, we thought he ought to know.”
The word lit a fuse at the Slytherin table, and in no time flat the explosives went off. The table inhabitants were practically screaming, and she heard two boys angrily shout “They got Potter!” from the other end of the hall. A malicious smirk took hold of Ursa’s lips, a sick form of pleasure came from disappointing so many people, and in such a splendid fashion. She took her seat between the two boys, and listened to Dumbledore’s speech before food appeared on the previously empty plates. Students helped themselves at Dumbledore’s behest, but Ursa only ate a little soup before turning to talk to her companions.
“I got a little held up,” Neville announced, finally emerging from the rubble with Draco’s help, “Oh, gross.”
“Thank you, Professor, but I quite like Slytherin.”
“I do have to, if it’s something I can do myself why should someone else do it?”
Ursa nodded, the pressure on her stomach, heart, and mind lifted, and the relief made her light headed and weightless.
“Because I can.”
more of a filler chapter, just something to flesh out Ursa and Voldemort’s relationship, and try to establish the dad-ness of Voldemort
“That's okay, I want to do it,” She responded, hanging another dark robe up.
“It wasn’t meant to be insulting,” Blaise started, “I grew up with Draco, his folks weren’t around much, so he kind of clings. Being affectionate is how he specifies something is special to him, he’d do it with toys and books so I wouldn’t take them. And Ursa doesn’t seem like she gets affection at all, I mean for the first couple weeks at Hogwarts she flinched whenever you waved a hand at her. I think she’s just enjoying having someone give her that, like Neville said it doesn’t mean it’s romantic.”
Surely no sane person could blame Draco for slapping Potter after daring to compare him to Granger for the second time in one day. His hair never looked that tragic or bushy.
Because of your Veela manifestation.
about it, which made it even worse. His pale fingers were so long and slender, the backs of his hands veiny, his grip on Harry’s cock was sure and cool and — Circe’s tits, Malfoy’s hand was on wrapped around his cock.
They pop into the next universe, uncomfortably close together, squeezed into one side of a small booth in what looks like a Muggle coffee shop. It takes a few minutes of quiet and the odd crawling feeling of
“Okay, Scorpius. We need to leave now,” Draco said as he sat his arse down on the carpet so he could put the new pair of Muggle light up trainers on Scorpius himself, one set of velcro straps at a time. “You knew last night that you wanted to bring Sir Bumblebee with you to school, but you didn’t leave him set aside as I reminded you. Instead, you played and lost him in your lego trunk.” Despite this being an all too common speech, Draco’s tone remained patient and kind, if maybe a touch frazzled when he realised he had put the left shoe on his son’s right foot and would have to start over.
“Do you have proof of this?” Draco asks.
“Look, that’s not what I meant.” Potter swapped his intensity for low-grade frustration and surveyed his class, then deemed it appropriate to guide Draco out into the hall for privacy. At least he left the door half-open. “There’s an ice cream shop, two blocks from here.”
“Harry, you have a problem.” Ron finishes off his scone before pointing a crumby finger at Harry. “You’ve gotta stop staying up so late to watch Malfoy do his camera wank web shit. It’s been almost two years now that you’ve been watching Malfoy without him knowing it’s you. You know it’s bloody creepy
Fuck you, Potter.
Draco let out a controlled breath and tried to subtly pull his arm out of Potter’s grasp to no avail. He couldn’t believe this was happening. Scorpius hasn’t been here for five minutes and already they would be asked to…  It simply wasn’t fair. Why should the past affect an innocent child? “When I originally sought to enroll him here, I was assured there wouldn’t be an issue. Since it clearly is, I think it’s best that I pull him out today before he makes new friends and—”
By the time he’d made a dent in his steak and kidney pie, his body had all but confirmed it. He was sweating profusely, and his robes felt tight and scratchy despite their renewed Tailoring Charms. His eyesight was hazy enough, he’d worry about where his glasses were if he didn’t feel them on his face. And even that sensation was different, weird. Too much.
As if he’d flipped a switch, Draco mellowed and closed the door behind him, his shoulders sloping down in remorse as he let his cane bear the brunt of his weight. Slate eyes roved over the bland tile flooring, and his mouth twisted down at the corners, showing frown lines that he always denied existed. It was a well-acted ruse that fooled their colleagues with ease, but Harry was far past that level of intimacy. He and Draco had danced, duelled, and fucked over that line in every possible position since their cumulative divorces.
Draco visibly tenses but keeps his eyes on the vial in his hand, instead of turning to face Harry. His workspace is littered with spare metal bits and bobs. A large cauldron is bubbling away behind him, the rising smoke in a bright Chudley Cannons’ orange.
Draco sighs and relaxes back into Harry’s arms, looking torn between defeat and utter pride. Harry should really let him go soon. “I was working on a modified Time-Turner, Potter. You spilled potion on us both and knocked me over so it began spinning. Unfortunately, it seems to have taken us both along for the ride,” Draco said.
“Seokjin said it was
Harry’s jaw drops, and he turns to look at (his) Draco who also looks confused and sleepy but less surprised. (His) Draco cups his hands around his mouth and yells, “Hello,” but neither Seeker acts like they can hear him, even though they’re less than a metre away.
“Yes, well.” In order to get Ron to back off, he does the one thing he hates to do.
Harry isn’t sure which part of his brain goes offline at the suggestion, but he follows it up with his own proposition. “We could share. You know, to make sure we get every crevice one hundred percent clean.”
Nostrils flaring, Harry stepped in closer, with his wand clutched tightly in one hand and his wrinkled parchments in the other. “Hermione’s really brilliant! She’s the best in our year and always has been.”
Draco was falling off track. He licked his lips to regroup, then gently ran the wool across the width of Harry’s stomach, playfully dipping into his navel. Harry squirmed and tried to pull the scarf away but a hand around the wrist stopped him.
Fuck you, Potter.
Veelas metabolise alcohol too quickly for there to be any pleasant, lingering side effects.
Potter looked completely wrongfooted for a few seconds before his mind appeared to latch onto the most likely conclusion. His expression cleared up as Scorpius took a step forward and offered a tiny hand.
“Fucking hell.”
“If you do ever make a decision and find you need assistance with your purchase, feel free to send me an owl, Potter.” Malfoy flashes him a grin that holds less cruelty than Harry is used to seeing directed his way in person. “No need to place a tracking spell this time,” he says, then stalks away with all the dignity of a bloody peacock. “Your Auror skills elude you when you’re thinking with your dick. See you at seven!”
Harry can’t tell where they go after, since (his) Draco grabs him and spins the Time-Turner hurriedly, spluttering with red cheeks about how he isn’t a cheap companion of the moonlight.
“Of course. Why did I bother asking?” Draco muttered under his breath as he yanked the sheets of parchment out of Harry’s grasp. The morning sunlight streaming in the windows reflected on his collection of expensive-looking rings when he adjusted the shoulder strap of his rucksack, his brow furrowed while he read the list of classes aloud.
“Yes, yes, listen to the charming saviour of Witch Weekly. Out of here now,” Draco ordered, gesturing wildly with his cane and uncomfortably close to smacking both Harry and Mrs Mulberry with it.
That.”
There was absolutely no reason for him to be so far gone this early. It wasn’t until he felt the ghost of sensations trickling over his mind like gentle waters, like tendrils of smoke, that Harry realised Draco held him in a delicate state of Legilimency. He couldn’t afford to be knocked out on his back by the type of powerful orgasms he usually experienced under this sort of play. He hadn’t finished his clinic hours yet.
. He was completely gutted. “You! Right now. Scorpius has just walked in and—”
“Where are you taking me?” If Harry’d been drugged, he needed the antidote now. Not the scenic route of the Ministry.
Draco grumbles into his ear and shifts his left arm, but it’s no use. There’s no time left.
“Healer Potter’s clinic hours are over!” The cane shaking wasn’t half as menacing as Draco thought it was. Lucius Malfoy, he was not. “He is on break!”
You can smell me?
“Yes, but you’ve been looking for five minutes and haven’t found Mr. Bumblebee—”
So when Harry presented him with a key after NEWTs and asked Draco to move in with him after graduation — he had no choice, but to accept.
No, by
“—and send the PT Healers chasing after you like an escaped toddler,” Harry said, as bored as the day is long. “If you’re taking more of the Pain Potion than what was prescribed, I can’t help you.”
Did you follow me all the way here simply to harass me? I could contact the Ministry and report you.
’ed a quill and his prescription parchment, huffing as Draco barely gave him space to write while opening his trousers and pulling them down to mid-thigh. The ink didn’t even have time to dry before Draco tried to snatch the slip from Harry, who was quick enough to raise it over their heads. “There are
After, you vile cretin. I was a month away from completing my Mastery when—
Oh, pray tell, do go on with your diagnosis of my emotions.
While Harry may have noticed Draco’s legs before — many times over, in fact — he’d failed to realise exactly how much longer they were than his own until forced to match the brisk pace Draco set. For having saved the world, it was rather embarrassing to be this easily winded. However, that could’ve been the nerves, too. “Why can’t you teach me now?”
“Hello, Scorpius, it’s nice to meet you too. I’m happy you’re going to be in my class.” The warmth in Potter’s voice was genuine, although he still looked at Draco, a bit unsure. “Rose, please show Scorpius where to put his things. We’ll start in a few minutes.”
“Yes, that wasn’t your fault. Like when you accidentally shrunk Auror Chang down to Niffler size after you two broke up.
Draco and Harry stay silent. They
Then all four of them seem to realise a fact at the same time. There is only one bed in this room.
Now that the sentimental parts were over, Draco could breathe again and ignore the blush he felt blooming on his cheeks. Bloody Gryffindors and their feelings that overflowed onto everything in sight. There was no decorum with that bunch.
To see Draco slowly wind down from orgasm, the evidence sliding down his chest and stomach. His thighs quiver as he slowly rises off the thick dildo centered on his bed, the shameless squelch of lube audible when the head pops free of his body. The liquid silver of his eyes is barely visible between dilation and the hazy fluttering of his lashes. Draco laughs, low and breathy, as he rubs the spent dildo along the crevice of his groin, his softening cock, and heavy bollocks. Lube is smeared everywhere, adding to his image of debauchery.
Harry spun around quickly enough that he tripped over his own untied shoelaces. A fantastic impression to make on someone he hadn’t seen in months. Since Malfoy's — no — Draco’s trial. And now he was here. “You’re here.”
Malfoy’s free hand squeezed the back of Harry’s neck again. It still felt unbelievably good. “Something we should’ve tried years ago, Potter.”
“That’s because they live far away. Like Mémère. We always visit, but then we come home.” Draco set Scorpius back down and slid the backpack over his shoulders, then tightened the straps for Floo travel. “But if we make more friends here in London, we can see them every day.”
“Hello.”
about 14th-century wizarding architecture.
Hogwarts’ Protective Charms kept any of their
Harry thinks it’s pretty fucked up when that’s what does it for him tonight. What makes his abs tighten and his toes curl, scraping over hardwood flooring. He’s panting so loud he almost can’t hear Draco’s voice. Harry has to look ridiculous, one eye squinted close with pleasure and the other desperately trying to stay open and see.
Any measure of time spent in your presence is a minute wasted. In fact—
And who would knock on their door anyway? On a cool Sunday morning, a drizzling rain quiet as it pelted their window. The rest of the castle was asleep, calm, unlike Draco’s heart which was beating unsteady in his chest and sounding loud in his ears. He had all of this bare, olive skin in front of him, ready to be touched, caressed and worshipped. Where to even start?
— — —
No. You think it’s a waste of time.
. While they lived their lives differently, they still had the same spectrum for emotions, ideas, and choices that could affect themselves and those around them, in both positive and negative ways. Mindful thinking always worked to pull him out of the swampy clutch of his old tendencies for nastiness, just like Mind Healer Bitterwood had advised at the beginning of his therapy. It kept Draco in check, helped him be a better person. A better father.
Potter chuckled and ducked his head, taking his sweet time to let go of Draco. “Only if you call me Harry.”
(His) Draco hesitates, eyes on the MV couple as Veela Draco flaps his wings to fly over Werewolf Harry’s body, hovering steady as they start to kiss.
Duly noted, Potter.
“Hurry up. You’re impeding on important Healer business. The state of modern medicine and wizarding life depends on it. And tell the useless desk help that Potter is not to be disturbed for at least 30 minutes!” The uptick in volume was hardly necessary since Draco stayed on her heels like a hostile crup, until his body blocked all view of the outside realm.
“Well, I suppose he isn’t wrong about that.” The giant, colorful numbers and letters painted throughout the corridor seemed a bit more in line with reception. It gave enough leeway for that small but still rude part of Draco to wonder again if this was all a terrible mistake. That inner voice reasoned that wasn’t too late to turn around and hire a private wizarding tutor for Scorpius, like the one he had growing up. After all, Draco turned out exceptionally intelligent.
shared office since both MV versions are in standard uniform down to the polished brass buttons. Harry and (his) Draco are hazardously perched on top of his own very messy desk, while a spotless one is across the room. The workspace definitely isn’t Ron’s since it has a stripy mug, a pretentious quill and ink set, with a giant picture of MV Draco, Pansy, Greg and Blaise hanging on the wall behind it.
He wrinkled his nose before he smoothed out his face, determined to not let a sneer take root. Draco used to be a bigoted twat, but he wasn’t anymore.
Potter frowned at first, thick brows furrowed, then opened his mouth to argue like when they were boys — until realisation hit. His expression cleared like a cloud uncovering the sun. Draco wasn’t mocking him, not harshly. No, Potter was being teased. Flirted with. A round-about way of Slytherin acquiescence.
MV Harry is even moaning about how ‘Malfoy better fuck him harder or he’s going to give him Saturday detention with the students’.
“He bumped into a table he was instructed to steer clear of, spilt a few potions, caused a fuss,” Malfoy lied, hooking his elbow around Harry’s arm to pull him out of his seat. “Notice how Millicent is in perfect health? She always behaves during joint meetings. Perhaps you could take lessons from your partner.”
MV Harry and Ron are on the other bed, with Ron speaking none too quietly, apologising to Harry for McGonagall’s stubbornness and refusing to swap out Draco for Ron as Harry’s roommate. The term ‘interhouse unity’ is spoken with the same disgust that is usually held for spiders. Ron slides off the blankets and heads out of the room without so much as a nod of courtesy thrown Draco’s way.
Instead, he received an apology for the situation and directions to remain calm until the matter was resolved. Then asked which pair of pyjamas would he like for Winky to bring him.
A monstrous wolf sails over the balcony ledge and transforms in mid-air, leaving an equally naked Harry to land on two bare feet.
Instead of drinking... heavily?
“Scorpius, are you ready to go? We’re going to be late.”
“Potter, remain calm,” Malfoy whispered, his lips barely moving while he strode towards the exit. “Someone has slipped you a potion, and I need to get you out of here. I assume you’re feeling the effects quite strongly now?”
“How—?”
Harry feels a bit like his brain might explode. “What the hell is going on?”
“You haven’t seen the new schedule?” Draco nipped at his ear and unfastened his belt, the soft clink of metal barely registering in Harry’s mind. “We won’t have a night alone until June at the earliest.”
“Hello, Mr Potter. It’s nice to meet you,” Scorpius said, enunciation steady and practiced. It filled Draco with pride.
“Well, it does help when I’m buggered into exhaustion,” Draco chuckled, closing in to kiss at Harry’s neck. His heavily ringed hands slide under Harry’s shirt once he has access, muscle memory leading him to caress in all the right places. “It’s a shame Healer Raywood has us scheduled in opposing shifts for the next three weeks.”
Overcome with an untimely rush of emotion, Draco gave his son’s hand a squeeze then guided him around another corner to a short hall. It was a dead end with a small mural of Hogwarts Castle and only one door on either side. The one to their left was already closed, with a plaque marking it as ‘Year 2’. The other door was still wide open and labeled ‘Year 1’. Despite his Muggle wristwatch announcing the time as twelve minutes past the beginning of class, it seems they had yet to start without Scorpius. Small mercies.
Harry isn’t ready for this and he can feel himself withering on the spot. He has to say something, quickly. “My wand is gay.” Preferably not
She pulled her burgundy shawl tightly around her shoulders and scurried out of the room, nearly forgetting her prescription parchment behind until Harry passed it over, wincing at the sting of her ragged nails when they scraped over his palm.
Draco’s heart clenched. When he and Astoria had originally set out to have a temporary marriage of convenience — an heir for him, and the money for her to leave her strict parents — they hadn’t realised exactly how hard it would be on their son. The constant coming together, then pulling apart. While Astoria wasn’t overly maternal and had no desire to rear a child full time, she did want to visit her son and let him know that he was still loved. It helped that her new wife adored Scorpius, too. Except, now that the women were settled in Italy, it had fallen on Draco and Scorpius traveling to them instead, and their different schedules never allowed for more than a few days at a time.
“Uh, hey Draco, who’s the creep beside your uncle?” Neville asked, and Ursa turned and noticed what must’ve disturbed Neville: the unrelenting stare of a professor in a turban, centered almost entirely on them and them only.
“Headmaster, you must be joking—“
“Do you watch me put makeup on?”
“I’ll tell you a little about my childhood, then, since everyone and their mothers seem to think they know yours. My mother was a pure blood, who had a rather unrequited affair with a muggle she seduced with potions. He left and she had to give birth to me alone, but she didn’t survive the ordeal. I grew up in an orphanage where the children hated and feared me. I was lonely and ridiculed, avoided at all costs by the children who had any semblance of self preservation, and bullied by the children who didn’t. Those children didn’t last long, however, and eventually their bodies would be found mutilated somewhere on the property grounds,” the professor took a deep breath, “So, I’d say we’re able to understand each other.”
“Fine,” Ursa huffed, relaxing into the crook beneath his shoulder, comfortable against his rib cage, “I just got started on it young, and it’s part of my routine.”
“That’s harsh,” Pansy sniffed, “Elaboration, please?”
“Another five points to Slytherin for sheer, dumb luck,” McGonagall scoffed out before turning and leaving, followed by the other staff except Professor Quirrell.
“What do you mean ‘that’s it?’, doesn’t that sting?” Neville asked.
“Is this even English?” Professor Quirrell asked rhetorically from beside her, the two grading papers together. Ursa got a detention from Snape again for being a distraction, in reality she was just asking Pansy and Blaise for clarification on the potion process, but once again the DADA professor took her detention off Snape’s hands and saved her from unimaginable torture and misery at the greasy man’s hands.
“Would you like to head back to the manor?” Draco asked, partially because his feet were tiring, partially as a way to forcefully rip himself from his thoughts, “We can just grab an early dinner.”
“I don’t think you need it,” He threw in, his arm coming down to rest on her shoulders.
“Anywhere but,” Neville blurted out, and immediately went pink again, embarrassed he said it out loud.
“What kind of recommendations?” She asked, rolling her eyes at him and ignoring the latter part of what he said.
(See the end of the chapter for
Speaking of Quirrell, she needed to thank him. She had sent him some expensive potions to help with frustration, headaches, and anger better than the calming droughts would, as well as a black, scaled wand holder she thought he’d like. She knew he was in Slytherin, and he’s mentioned he favors snakes in terms of tolerable animals, so she thought a wand holder fashioned after a snake would be appreciated.
“I wouldn’t have a crush on a Death Eater,” Weasley insisted, his face twisting into a deep scowl.
also I’ve been obsessed with ArtBreeder, and made my vision of these characters in it, so if y’all wanna see that in the next chapter I’ll include some that the bottom of the chapter
“Did none of your friends invite you to their homes for the break?”
“Obviously,” he rolled his eyes. He jogged towards the pillar and she watched, transfixed, as the wall seemed to just… swallow him. The brickles rippled where his mass met the wall, and in seconds reversed to its original state, completely undisturbed. Now intrigued, Ursa ran after him. A moment of darkness led to the most brilliant sight after Diagon Alley. Harmless spells being cast colored the air, laughter of children and exasperated admonishments of adults joined the bellows of train engines. The train itself was beautiful, a bright, reflective scarlet red, and Ursa wasn’t entirely convinced there wasn’t a spell on the locomotive itself to make it shine.
“Ursa, help help help, oh Merlin—“ Neville tried leaning forward to grab her again but ended up launching himself through the air. He screamed and tried to pull back, which only gained him altitude, and Ursa rushed after him on foot, ignoring anything Hooch said after her.
“That should be all the important ones, if you find yourself particularly drawn to any of them let me know and I’ll help you find more, even if you need a slip into the restricted section,” He smiled warmly and Ursa beamed back.
isn’t nearly enough to immobilize the pissed off tank that has decided to charge them.
“My cousin and his friends liked to chase me around,” She answered, seeing his confusion, walking over to make sure he’s alright, “I just became a pretty decent runner from it.”
“M-Miss Pot-Potter, can-can I s-speak to you?” The Professor asked, and stepped into the hallway. Ursa shrugged at the boys, who shrugged back, and they parted ways.
“Because I have the ability to? Just because a house elf
“If I crash, you’re getting an itching hex so far up your ass you’ll feel a tickle in your throat,” Ursa threatened, lining up her cart and assuring that Edgar is secure.
“We left you for twenty minutes. Twenty. Minutes,” Ursa sighed and sat down beside him.
“Because we’re paying and housing them specifically to do that.”
The two continued grading for another couple hours, Ursa staying a little longer than needed to continue their scattered, low impact conversations. She’s taken to just hanging around the Professor whenever she can, and if he had an issue with her clinging to him like a lost puppy, he never mentioned it.
“N-Now now, Severus. Fro-From what we’ve h-heard, they stumbled o-on this troll h-here and-and defended them-themselves,” Professor Quirrell challenged, and it was clear he and Snape were going to fight over this. Ursa thanked Merlin for Professor Quirrell.
Ursa nearly cried when she saw a white-blond flash of salvation.
“It’s stupid,” Neville said.
“What do we do, Albus?” McGonagall asked.
“You worry too much, it’ll be fine.”
“I didn’t really have anywhere to go,” Ursa shrugged, watching the nostalgia pull up at his lips as he absentmindedly flipped through the yellowed pages.
“Guys…” Neville moaned beside them, wishing for once the two would stop engaging with trouble or starting fights. His loyalty could have put him in Hufflepuff, but he questions the decision to align that trait with the two Slytherins next to him every day.
“Am I not allowed to?” She asked, and the venom riding shotgun in her tone alerted the room that blood would be shed depending on the answer.
Draco and her met in Madame Malkin’s, both were trying for Slytherin and decided to accompany each other to get their wands. Ursa wasn’t dumb, she knew the history of the bigoted house, and knew that she was not on the side of privilege—that’s where Draco came in. He got perks from her reputation, and she had the silhouette of a wealthy, well-established pureblood to hide in. However, like a malignant tumor, Draco grew on her, and she him, and both soon realized the partnership wouldn’t be as taxing as the other dreaded.
“It wouldn’t be obscure if they were studied, so why aren’t they studied?” Draco asked.
Ursa became a Dark Lord overnight and was enjoying it thoroughly.
there are two wolves inside of me. one wants to write angst for the drama. the other wants pure fluff to satisfy my trust and commitment issues. I am mentally ill.
“Maybe he used the Slytherins as bait, intending on there being a scuffle and having a faculty member mysteriously missing.”
“And where do you want to go?” She asked.
“It’s interesting.”
After a quick shower, Ursa stood in front of the mirror in the tiny bathroom attached to the room. She brushed her shock of puffy, curly black hair, and stuck some random product Lady Malfoy sent her on the ends of the strands, of which ended just past the chin. Her eyes were almond shaped, a dull, jewel green color, and the eyelashes framing them, longer and thicker thanks to potions, made those eyes stand out on her heartish-roundish shaped face. Other than the severe eyebags, her golden-brownish, densely freckled/spotted complexion looked pretty decent, also the work of potions.
“It’s certainly impressive,” Ursa responded, her eyes struggling to comprehend that this was, in fact, a real place. It looked too fantastical. The full moon reflected off gentle, inky water, the other reflection being the gigantic castle glowing a soft, warm orange from candle light.
“Neville, calm down, breathe, you’re completely fine, just breathe—“ Ursa started, only to be interrupted by Hooch yelling at Neville to land and stop messing around.
“I don’t have a lot, it’s fine staying in my luggage.”
“Yes they do,” Pansy rolled her eyes, “They can’t keep their hands off each other.”
Neville’s package was a little larger, and that almost worried her. He got her an Aglaophotis for her dorm to help ward away illness, as well as a more advanced textbook on magical plant care. It seems they thought very similarly, because she got him two advanced books on magical plant care and a Rashovnik, an herb whose roots can open any door.
“Why do you have so many?” Ursa asked.
She got Blaise an old, official looking tome on magical creatures, since she heard him once mention he would like to study them when he got older, as well as candy and an obsidian colored wand holder that reminded her of him. He got her chocolate and the wizard equivalent to a gift card for a witch’s clothing store on Diagon, with a note apologizing for being bad at picking out gifts.
“Once we reach the dungeons, we run, got it? The second the prefects aren’t looking we go grab him,” Draco whispered back, “We just need to get in, grab him, and get out, we don’t need to risk anything or be heroic, it’ll only be a couple minutes, no one will even notice.” It sounds like he was convincing himself more than anyone else. Ursa nodded, her small sense of loyalty refused to let her leave Neville, but her self preservation didn’t dare consider raising a wand to the troll, and Draco had a very similar mindset.
“Why?”
“Oh,” Ursa was surprised, not because of the knowledge that her favorite professor let a troll in, but because she didn’t care all too much that her favorite professor let a troll in, “Can I ask why?”
“I wouldn’t know, actually. Not since it’s you.”
DADA was… interesting, as the first day established. Everyone walked in, the three, led by Draco, sat in the front because Draco knew Ursa was excited for this class, and Neville was content to follow them wherever. Immediately Ursa knew this class would drain her, Professor Quirrell’s stuttering was comparable to someone’s heavy handed attempt at running their nails down a chalkboard: inconsistent, but sharp and disorienting when nail actually caught board. He seemed to almost…
“Got it.” Ursa’s guts were coiling and condensing in her torso, and she had half a mind to expel them via vomiting just to be rid of the feeling. The thought of the dungeons mixed with her fear for Neville’s safety stewed in her stomach, the volatile combination making stars appear in her peripheral but she refused to let herself faint in front of all these people.
also im sorry to people who love ron and hermione, i love them too theyre just the easiest to bully here lmao
“Greetings and salutations to you too, you prissy peacock, I’d compliment your hair gel but I think the greasy look is a compliment to you enough,” Ursa retaliated, her sweet smile was ungenuine and venom dissipated from every pore of her words.
“Malfoy, Draco.” Ursa zoned back in to hear his sorting after once again clocking out. Draco practically strutted towards the stool, the world was his catwalk. He sat down in a single, fluid turn and swung one leg over the other, while he smiled down at the peasantry below.
Slytherin house, like Ravenclaw, was a quiet house, the students’ used their time to study or plot more than converse. It was well regarded in Slytherin that too much expression could result in nasty consequences for the eager oversharer, so it wasn’t a surprise that the house was full of introverts who would hold close to a small group of trusted confidants and scorn the rest. Silence was expected because you couldn’t trust that someone with good ears and a generational grudge wasn’t near. Typically Ursa rather liked the gentle atmosphere, while it was every man for himself there was a unique, mutual pact between every Slytherin as the house of Hogwarts’ underdog that kept students from bickering, reluctant to dent the united front they had to present to other houses. Slytherin was not too dissimilar to a lazy cat, edging a glass towards the end of a table, but stopping before gravity could take hold in a silent reminder that while it has the power to knock the glass off, it won’t.
“So you knew there would be trolls?” She asked.
“Slytherin!” The Sorting Hat shouted before it even settled on Draco’s head.
“Boring, father had to leave early but otherwise it was uneventful,” Draco drawled, and Ursa spotted the ring on his finger as he waved his hand around.
Draco, Neville’s in the bathroom,” she whispered, “He doesn’t know.” Her stomach sank to her feet, and her heart traveled into her throat, attempting to beat itself out of her mouth.
“Because Pansy doesn’t look like she wants to commit murder every time she applies mascara,” Draco threw his arm over the back of the lounge, and Ursa hesitantly sidled against him and under his arm.
“Only Death Eaters use dark spells, that’s what my parents told me,” the boy huffed.
“Still, an excellent opportunity to show up Weasley, and that bookworm Granger,” Draco scoffed, tired of Weasley insisting that school grades don’t define his magical prowess, that he’s just a bad test taker, etc., and Granger’s holier than thou attitude to academics. Draco grabbed a second plate with some fruit and a bagel and put it in front of Ursa. Ursa once again banished it.
“I’d like to thank you for yours as well,” he lifted his arm, letting gravity drag down his sleeve enough to show the wand holder she got him.
She counted the spots in the ceiling’s texture. At one hundred seventy-three, she cast another tempus and violently cursed under her breath as she saw twenty-two minutes passed, leaving only half an hour to get ready. Probably more than needed, but Ursa wanted to be sure she was decent looking.
“We don’t even know if they like each other,” Neville argued.
do it doesn’t mean they need to,” Ursa shrugged, watching his pallid brows scrunch, perplexed, as she folded a pair of trousers.
“A hair straightener,” She replied, and went back to reading, but Draco noticed she stopped turning the pages as quickly as before.
noise of her feet on the dead, stone floors reverberated off the ornate walls, no body to absorb the sound and no soft chatter to join its waves. Returning to her bedside she inspected the tall stack of wrapped boxes and decorated bags, all addressed to her wishing her well. She wasn’t expecting them, truthfully, and it’s taking time for her to work up the courage to open them. A part of her didn’t want to touch them, preserve them in the state she found them, but she knew her friends would kill her for not seeing what they got her, and she would feel worse not respecting the effort they put into finding something for her.
“If you’re the representative of Gryffindor here then my opinion of the lions has sunk even lower, and I thought that would be impossible but you’re a fountain of discoveries Weasley,” Draco applauded, turning and deciding to talk to Zabini, as Weasley no longer interests him.
“Neville!” Ursa screamed when he fell off the broom, he got caught on a pole which lessened his fall slightly, but his robes tore and he fell the rest of the way to the ground.
“Do you have a library?” Ursa asked.
She dutifully followed beside him, carrying books he pulled from the shelf and forcing herself not to sneeze when dust violated her nostrils. It was clear he’s the only one who knows these books exist, as the layer of grime built up had to be several decades old.
“DEFODIO!” She screamed again, getting more panicked now. She wasn’t sure that spell would work, it was meant to carve stone and steel, but it was the first backup her mind spit out while cowering in the corner of her head. It did more damage, miraculously, it took off the tip of a finger, but that just made the troll angrier. Ursa quickly realized that
Several complete outfits later, Draco was satisfied that her robes were fit to take up her closet space. Ursa let herself be led around, listening to his excited chatter and eager rambling, listing all the activities he had thought up to fill their summer. She closed her eyes, content, trusting whatever decision he made. Her lungs rose slowly and deeply, that soft feeling returning to her arteries and hollowing her stomach, making way for vibrant wings and fluttering emotions. It wasn’t quite butterflies, Ursa was certain, it was something more grand and tangible, a thing with feathers more likely.
“Here,” Quirrell drew his wand and Ursa flinched harshly, “Sorry. Now, do you feel better?”
“Did you straighten your hair when you were younger too?” He asked, “That must have been difficult for a child to do.”
“Shut up, you have it easy. Men’s clothes are pathetically simple,” Ursa rolled her eyes.
“I still don’t like this,” Neville rubbed his neck.
“I’m sure it’ll be easy, Professor Flitwick wouldn’t make our first practical lesson that difficult,” Ursa reasoned. The feeling of crippling dread left the second she exited the dungeons, but she didn’t want to tempt the illness again by eating.
“Here,” Quirrell offered, and reached into his desk drawer again. Ursa looked closer this time, and forced herself not to gape at the wooden box absolutely filled to the brim with calming droughts.
The Malfoy estate was as beautiful as it was grand, and in that week she’s been there, Draco has already given her two tours, insisting one wasn’t enough to commit to memory.
“Thank you, Hagrid. Now—“ she started, and she noticed the wide berth between three students and the rest of the class, then the darkened robes, and the damp, dripping hair. Something in her eyes died right then, and it looked like she aged ten years.
“I didn’t think that old fool would order Slytherins back to the dungeons. I apologize, kiddo,” Quirrell’s voice was soft and reassuring.
Soon everyone left her, Draco and his family taking a vacation somewhere warm, Neville’s aunt insisted he be home to celebrate, Blaise’s mother and him were also traveling, Susan’s aunt was taking off work, and Padma and her sister were off seeing family. Ursa sighed, holed up in the library once again, with nothing better to do than read. She would be reading anyway with Draco and Neville, but now it’s different. She didn’t have Draco’s shoulder to rest her head on, and didn’t have Neville to bounce theories and hypotheticals off of. It was just a little too quiet now, and Ursa was shocked, finding herself not caring for it.
“You really don’t have to.”
The troll fell, finally, the room shook when its carcass hit the tiles. Draco and her stepped closer, and she grimaced seeing the effect the
“Uh, not really?” Ursa shrugged, starting to eat as well, “But thank you for so effectively defending my honor in my absence, your loyal service has been acknowledged.”
“My grandmother wasn’t too horrible this year, I think she actually missed me,” Neville joked.
“He’s not serious is he?” Ursa asked. The Slytherin common rooms were
“That, on your face.”
Ursa’s alarm blared like a wrecking ball smashing through a poorly put-together wall of plastic cups that was unconsciousness. She cast a
“You can sit here, so long as you keep quiet about the crow,” Ursa said conspiratorially, smiling as warmly as possible at Neville, and the satisfaction she got from seeing his anxiety melt and smile back was only a little bit cruel. He shuffled into the compartment and sat beside Ursa, and when Neville wasn’t looking she gave Draco another look, to which he shrugged and continued reading, understanding now what Ursa was doing.
“Thought I’d find you here,” an older man’s voice rang out, easily disrupting her already distracted thoughts.
