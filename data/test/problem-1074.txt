, Harry, not just another case - and it healed some small part of him to know that. He was glad to have broached the usually-taboo subject. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, as Kim had told him.
As an Auror, Ron was a keen observer of human behavior. He could see that, throughout the night, Harry was nervous and jittery, excited and jittery, frustrated and jittery, and a bit jittery. Ron could see that he was trying very hard to make it look like he was not watching Monty like a hawk throughout the night, and coincidentally that's what Monty seemed to be watching Harry for. Watching him to make sure he wasn't watching him watching.
"You ever been smacked, Malfoy?" Harry shot back. The look on Malfoy's face was well worth this trip to the Dreary Poop Farm, but quick as a flash it morphed into something more playful.
normal. Who was Harry to say otherwise? No experience with children, after all. Draco seemed to have forgiven Harry for blowing off their appointment a few days ago; he hadn't even asked why. Maybe it was normal to blow off appointments with real estate agents? He had no plans to do so again...he rather liked the man his old school rival had grown into. So now he carried enough gold for a trip on the Knight Bus.
Ron left him there, ranting in a way that was eerily similar to Malfoy Senior, and went to check on Harry.
Harry's hands were busy swinging Hugo side to side in large, swooping motions, but he didn't look any less sulky.
"I don't want it to muck things up either," Draco agreed, and he broke into an uncharacteristic, nervous-looking grin. "At least not before I get to snog you."
James tried again to pull back, to wrench himself away, but Draco clung to his hands. Even now, James could almost see the cuts forming on his lithe chest, the blood seeping through his shirt, pooling on the ground - Myrtle was screaming - Snape -
James seethed internally. He didn't want to talk about this, about how wrong he was and how right Monty was, even though Monty was the one terrorizing their kitchen. He didn't think he was being unreasonable, wanting a friend he could claim for his own, wanting Monty to trust his judgment. But he had a feeling that somehow he was in the wrong, even if he couldn't work out exactly why. He didn't think he could take another round of Monty screaming horrible things at him, especially since those things were starting to ring true.
Harry could make out the likeness of a snake in the heavy iron door to the windowless building. He backed away carefully, keeping his mouth firmly shut while he stared at it. The last thing he needed was to start spewing Parseltongue while Draco Malfoy was still blissfully oblivious to his true identity.
"C'mon, Lav, Cedric's more your type anyway..." The girls make a hasty retreat as Severus steps through a gap in the counter, examining the Jell-O closely as an investigator might treat a clue.
"Yeah." Potter's very somber now, somber and grim and not at all joking. But mad people are rarely convinced of their madness.
“Healer Abbott reports that your hip took damage reminiscent of a blasting curse,” Malfoy said clinically, rifling randomly through the scrolls of parchment on his desk. James blinked. Weren’t they supposed to be talking about parenthood? “I specialize in Mind Healing, but I have a background in the physical as well. Any Healer will tell you that if you push yourself too quickly during rehab, you'll do more harm than good. We can regrow bones but there’s only so much magic can do for the muscles and ligaments.”
"You did, though - find me, that is," Harry offered, peeking up from his tea and allowing that small smile to grow a bit.
Alec pulled back and switched places with Arthur, who was looking a little peaky. James heroically resisted the urge to check his temperature and drag him back home. Arty didn't say anything. He was struck silent for once in his life. He had never even been to summer camp.
"Spare me..." Draco rolled his eyes, pressing another kiss into his lips. "That Potter wouldn't know good taste if it bit him on the arse."
"Make it do something," Draco ordered imperiously, shoving the phone back at him. He rolled his eyes and let Draco peer over his shoulder as he composed a quick message to Monty.
Harry launched out his seat and joined Draco by the massive window on the eastern wall. There was a bundle of rope and fabric hanging from the window ledge, eye-level. Draco's hands - he'd removed his own gloves at some point - were trembling slightly and Harry gave him what he hoped was an encouraging smile. Draco unclipped part of the bundle and stretched it out over to the pillar, clipping it into place there. Harry gaped at the hammock. It was beautiful - striped, aged canvas, smooth under his fingertips, with soft rope and tassels on either end. The blankets and pillow hadn't been visible when it was folded up, but it was all there, looking as cozy as a nest.
"Tuesday, first thing in the morning," he answered immediately. Robards was frowning at him while they viewed the pensieve memory together and Draco scowled at the Auror, muttering, 'I was going to cancel, obviously...'
"She died when I was a baby," Scorpius reassured. "I don't really miss her." And that was...gods, that was somehow worse.
"Fuck you, Malfoy! LET US OUT!" His voice cracks and he makes to hurl himself against the door again, bringing them both crashing forward and cracking Draco's head against the door jam.
, he was always such a sucker when his boys were upset. He stepped closer and wrapped an arm around Arty's shoulders, pulling the trembling boy to his chest as tightly as he held the blasted cat. "Th-they were throwin' bottles an' shit at her, she was m-meowing cos she was scared, am
"I said good day!" And on that flawless note, Draco stalked out of his office with the feckless folder.
"For other people, more than you." Ron was all fond pride and Harry wondered how many bull-headed aurors and dim bureaucrats had fallen victim to Hermione's temper over the years, especially when it came to his case.
They didn't bother opening the shop that day since they would be closing up before noon. James didn't even worry about the lost Saturday sales; they spent all morning working through the mail-orders, which were exploding lately. Half of the new orders came through with wizard coins stuffed into parchment-envelopes. James set those sales aside in a biscuit jar for the boys, not eager to take another public trip to Diagon Alley anytime soon.
The boys weren't giggling now, they were staring at the professors with something resembling horror. Harry and Monty were equally shocked. Too late, Remus realized his mistake as Harry began signing.
"Then at least carry wizarding money so you can call the Knight Bus," Remus put in. Ron gestured between him and Hermione as if they held all the wisdom in the world.
Monty was right, Aarti helped to get him started in his new life. She was exactly what he needed at the time. Intensely focused and outspoken, just a little bit scary; if she had ever claimed she killed a man, he would have believed her. She had little patience for his superficial tantrums and moods, but all the patience in the world to talk him through his darkest moments. She would have made an incredible partner to raise kids with, even if they hadn’t been so sure about marriage.
Potter grabs the waistband of his pants, nearly ripping them off, and together they tear out of the room into the sweet, cool corridor. From the ground, Potter throws his feet against the door. His trainers sizzle and bubble, the rubber soles burn and fill Draco's nose with a smell as nauseating as their own smoked flesh. A shadow from within the room moves—flies forward with incredible speed—and the door shuts just as the witch throws herself against it.
"If you showed up bald to the Quidditch match, I certainly would have asked what had befallen you to cause such a travesty. Or miracle, in your case."
Six minutes later, Harry hauled Draco into the first pub they saw - but they would've made it in three minutes if Draco hadn't been dragging his feet, bemoaning the city streets soiling his precious loafers. The sign out front dubbed this establishment “The Bend & Snap,” but just inside the door a chalkboard greeted them with: “Welcome to the Bend ‘n Snatch - Ask about our specials!”
Draco snorted in a very non-Draco way, taking another sip of the fine Elvish vintage. His hair was loose, the gel or serum or potion or whatever he usually used to coif it carefully was wearing off now as night approached morning. James thought it looked nice. He thought it might be soft if he touched it. He set his own glass aside, feeling plenty buzzed and not looking forward to the side-along Apparition home. Auror Rachel Mendel was glaring sleepy daggers at them from the far corner of the Manor's kitchen but James couldn't be arsed. He hadn't asked for a body-guard.
"You've got a warrant posted in the newspaper," Alec said, peering around his side to watch his signs.
"What else do you remember?" Ron blurted. Hermione nudged him subtly but he shrugged her off. "What? Erumpent in the room, let's talk about it." He met Harry's steady gaze. Harry never shied away from anything. Ron knew he was up for it. "What have you remembered over the years? Or dreamt about? Anything at all, even if it doesn't make sense, I'll bet it's something real!"
He exhaled in a whoosh as he joined Draco and Scorpius at an outdoor table. Draco was eyeing him oddly as they ate dessert before lunch - anything goes in the above-ground world, apparently - but didn't ask.
Draco could not stop thinking of oral and it was all James's fault. Potter's fault. He was Potter when he was mad at him. Charming when he was feeling frisky. Never Harry - a dull name, total romance killer.
His chair screeches against the tile floor when he stands. The others stare after him in horror as he walks by the suits, saluting them on his way out.
Trembling, blinking away the images and smells his dream, James crawled to the foot of the sopping bed and peeked over the edge. His jaw dropped. Several inches of water had built up on the floor. The wand had sunk below its surface, ripples showing where it had landed. The legs of their reclaimed dresser were only half-visible, the rug had disappeared entirely, and Monty was breathing like a winded hippogriff.
One sentence in and he was an alcoholic, which couldn't be further from the truth. He hadn't had more than a glass of Sirius's Firewhisky since finishing his potions, and it'd taken him the better part of an hour to choke that down.
They were talking about work, mostly. Scorpius tried to keep up. Somehow it had to do with school, which wasn't the same as work, not according to Mummy. Mr. James's wand was spewing out smoke a mile a minute.
He staunchly refused to be sucked in by their natural ginger charms. He had to resist! Monty was right. James always had a soft spot for gingers. He had once mentioned to Monty that the Scotsman would make a gorgeous redhead, which led to all sorts of jealousy issues that James was still learning how to avoid, even three years later. That's right: they had only been dating for two years, yet somehow the ginger-jealousy-monster had taken root long before their first snog.
"Could be that you'd seen the younger ones before, that they were familiar," Malfoy theorized. Ron made a note, forcing the cotton out of his head. Good, yes, the ferret was making sense...
“A what?” Sirius grunted miserably as he set upon his tea like a starving beast. His long hair was in disarray, eyes puffy with sleep, kimono-style robe barely tied and revealing far too much. Harry’s face went hot and he kept his eyes firmly fixed on his toast.
, James's hands blurted out, the memory coming back to him. He hadn’t thought about that day in so long, he had nearly forgotten…
"Ye know a wanna bake," he snorted as he wafted a baking sheet over the cooling cake. He wanted to get the frosting on before bedtime. If he timed it right, he would have enough time to tend to James's nerves in bed, make sure he got a good night's rest. "It's a natural extension to a candy shop. We'll take over this side of the city in confectionary goods!"
When Ben's hand comes to rest on the back of Harry's head - on a non-mushy part - he doesn't pull away. He leans into the touch, then painstakingly shuffles closer until he can fit his head on the man's bony hip. Ben's hand hesitates, then carries on stroking his hair. More tears leak out without his permission, but he doesn't care. He blinks up at the storybook, but can't get the words to focus. He's not sure if that's because his glasses are missing or if it's got something to do with the pounding of his brain.
"Yes, Potter, but I am not easy to manage," he retorts smoothly. Harry laughs uproariously as he trudges out of sight, but Draco doesn't seem to understand the joke. He pulls a face and bends to open a drawer. "As I was saying…
"And mentally?" Sirius looked as though he regretted saying it as soon as it was uttered, but it hung in the air regardless. Harry swallowed.
"Certainly not!" he spat, though the proximity to all that warm, sweet chocolate was tempting. As it was, he could hardly limit himself to one or two visits a week.
This was a common question people posed when they learned about Dad's amnesia. It was a fascinating topic, of course, but everyone else got the vanilla version of the story. Alec, Arthur, and Monty, however -
- " Ron hummed in delight, " - to a search of his cabin where we found your wand, and then obviously he was our number one suspect in your case."
The last thing Draco wanted to do was to put a wand back in this man's hands. He knew personally how much damage that could bring unto
But Draco appeared out of nowhere for them. It was slow for James, starting in therapy and progressing from there (and then regressing to their Hogwarts years as he regained his memories - the timeline was all screwed up). But the boys had only met Draco over the Christmas holidays - during the Monty fiasco, no less! - before returning to Hogwarts for the spring term. They no doubt caught the speculative Prophet articles, but they didn't see or hear from Draco again until the disaster that was Easter hols, and then suddenly it was summer and James had to stumble through The Talk with them.
Potter laughs at him, dropping his hand. Flushing, Draco bristles. The match is lit, the kindling catches. The familiar fire between them roars to life.
were mad all these years, the poor bugger..." He bent over Harry and pressed a kiss to that dense mop of hair while Harry rolled his eyes. "Who's fer dessert?"
That night three years ago was the first time James had asked him over to the shop after hours. When he had got that text, Monty nearly wet himself as thoroughly as Al did that night:
James slowly rejoined the waking world. He couldn't say when he first opened his eyes - was it before or after he noted how quiet the street outside was? before or after he felt someone's elbow digging into his bladder? - but when he finally blinked himself back into reality, he was faced with the devil himself.
. James scraped the ruined dinner into the bin and turned his back on Monty to wash the pan in the industrial sink. Monty sighed.
he thought clearly, jabbing the wand forward. The door sealed with a squelching sound and James heard Monty hurry over.
"It's not going anywhere," Robards sighed. "Nott said he'd give us names. Says it's far-reaching. There's plenty of work left to do."
It was against all sorts of protocols, if one wanted to find a reason to pin this on poor Draco. And many would. The Aurors viewing the pensieve memory all pointed to this moment and screamed like banshees. Because by handing over the letter, he was essentially telling Blaise that James Charming, of Charming Chocolates, was his newest patient.
He grunts and staggers, still holding onto Potter. They fall to the ground and he manages to bite his lip on the way down. Potter's lying stretched out on top of him, his heated back on Draco's chest, and they take a moment to catch their breath. It was a short battle but they're nearly spent. It's bloody
"What?!" Harry stumbled slightly on the curb as he tried to look over his shoulder. "Why not? You need to - to learn. You need an education."
too good to be true, because then Lucius Malfoy returned with Theodore Nott and Anthony Goldstein in tow.
"Oh, that's my walkie-talkie!" he says, patting his hip. There is no walkie-talkie. Draco's eye twitches. "Must need me in the back. See you round, Malfoy."
The silo had been refreshed nearly beyond recognition, but he knew it was his. The old, warped wood on the outside was now smooth and shining under so much dark stain; a single, impossibly long window spiraled up the whole thing like the red streak in a candy-cane; at the top rested a cabin built from whole logs, with a tiny porch hanging over the edge, cutting into the sky itself.
James swallowed as he flipped through the twenty-page document. Numbers based on two weeks of in-house sales, which were shoddily tracked from the start and taken during their busiest season. Inventory and stock, which were stolen from their personal groceries, whatever they had on hand in the kitchen to get Monty started that first week. Renovation estimates based on the existing shop's restoration, which didn't account for knocking out a wall in their kitchen to connect the old boutique to Charming Chocolates.
His father was beside himself, even more pleased than his mother, who wasn't at all surprised to welcome their guests. Suddenly Scorpius's best wishes on his way to Floo over to the Greengrass estate made sense. Everyone was in on it, apparently, except poor innocent Draco.
Remus felt his face turning red as he tried to suck down some air, but he managed to shake his head in the negative. He could hardly think for want of air, but he knew he was making a decidedly poor first impression.
The witch bobs out of view of the window-slat and hurries to the side to avoid being scalded. Draco's hands dart out and his blistered fingers grasp the many folds of her robes. He wrenches back with all his might. Potter's crouched on all fours, just where he said he'd be, and the witch cries out as she stumbles over his back toward Draco. He side-steps and uses her falling momentum to send her flying onto the bed.
"How did you recover your memories?" Robards asked, not looking particularly interested in the answer. Draco had caught him on his way out the door when he came in, bald and shaking and dripping in slug slime, demanding his undivided attention. It had probably been a long day for him.
"Rumors?" Draco took another cleansing swallow of fresh, cool water. Water had never betrayed him, unlike Blaise.
If only the long-time patients in the Janus Thickey Ward knew how much they had in common with their Healer. Then again, if they were able to make such connections, they probably wouldn’t need a bed in this ward. There was an outpatient program, after all.
anything, weren't buying any of it. Just walking around. Looking. They did less than the exhibit pieces themselves, which moved and creeped along with the crowd through the winding corridors.
He nearly leaps off the mound of rapidly-warming fabric when Potter pokes his back with a firm finger through his shirt. There’s no discernable difference in the room’s temperature, but perhaps it just can’t get any hotter. The air is already shimmering. Potter removes his finger and Draco sees his hand come around to his arm. He hesitates, trembling, then places his finger on Draco’s bare arm.
based on appearances. From the corner of his eye, he sees Potter smack his own forehead before stepping out from the meager cover of the pillar, standing resignedly at Draco's side.
James was doing too much, working extra hours, worrying about the new plans for a bakery expansion. Monty was clearly asking too much of him and now he was forced to rely on magic to get him through. Given half a chance, James always pushed himself too far.
"I, er… I don't have a phone," Harry admitted. The eavesdropping Muggles were briefly overcome by incredulity and Harry sent them an annoyed glare.
"You're throwing me in with racist Muggles as if I'm to blame for how you and Granger are treated in that uncivilized world!"
"It's Prongs," Alec muttered, coming close. "Professor Lupin helped me do it. S'not real silver, just the color. Did we get it right?"
The atrium was jam-packed with press and protesters on either side of the issue, but James and Hermione soon found their people. Hours passed, James used his wand to speak to one reporter briefly, but when it began to turn into an interview about his disappearance (
Harry signed with a frown, his wand spewing forth the gold smoke in a testament to his rising temper.
"A home with a view," Malfoy confirmed, taking note. He seemed to be avoiding Harry's gaze, but then suddenly lifted his eyes and pinned him with a searching look that had Harry squirming loudly in the leather chair.
He's not trusted to brush his teeth properly after his first "tantrum." Danny wields the toothbrush for him, jarring his jaw with the force of it.
"Only if you solved it wrong." Harry grinned wickedly. He was enjoying this far too much and now, Merlin forbid, he was whipping out a long scroll of parchment with an annoying little flourish. "Number Three - " he cleared his throat " - our third date."
That conversation led right into the boys going off to Hogwarts, this time leaving James at home with the Muggle nanny. James steered the conversation away from Monty, not wanting to give into the temptation to complain. Malfoy, as painfully professional as he tried to be, seemed to have it in for Monty. Whether it was because Monty was a Muggle - maybe that’s why Hermione had slapped him? James thought he might slap him too if that was the case - or because he never stopped trying to
Harry offered another small smile and gestured again for them to sit as he took the seat across from Remus. McGonagall sat primly and Remus fell into his seat, scraping the chair on the tile. When Harry leaned his cane (which was painted in a hundred dazzling colors with tiny, seemingly random brushstrokes) against the Thing, an alarming whirring-noise started up from within the Thing's depths. Harry shot it a quelling look and Remus was even more alarmed when the whirring settled back into nothing.
Lee presses his thumb to the screen, jumping back in the song to start again in roughly the same place:
"What, have our heirlooms gone to waste protecting this man? This man with whom you - apparently - want no future? A future in which Scorpius could have had the stable family you've denied him since birth?"
Monty huffed. James supposed that was true. Harry had been the center of it all and he had come through alright. But all those others, the kids who didn’t make it…
"I presume you'll catch up on the half-breed's lesson in private, then? You'll have to share your notes. I don't fancy failing my exams for a spontaneous jaunt through the woods."
“If there’s one thing our jewelry selection lacks, it’s quality. Mind you, I’ve a new program I’m implementing, with estate sales - it’s sure to bring in a whole new inventory of authentic goods, even precious heirlooms! This will change everything.”
, James angled himself to sign so that both boys could see, but Arthur's eyes were spinning in panic and he didn't take it in.
"Ugh, shut up," he said, his nose wrinkling at the thought of what had to have happened that led to their conception, which led to their birth, which led to Aarti Patel's death. "Tha's stupid."
“I’ve been thinking of getting an owl,” Harry lied, starting to feel desperate. He liked his life now. No complaints. None. Everything was fine the way it was, why should it have to change? Why should he have to endure the stares and whispers to put Remus at ease over an imagined issue? “I could get a penpal.”
"Or maybe I'm just not interesting enough to keep around," he dared to say aloud, choosing to focus on the way his breath formed in the frigid air.
, James huffed. Sure. Malfoy telling him he looked like an actual bowel movement in his stain-covered mustard-yellow jumper was completely necessary in the process of mental health care. What was friendly banter anyway?
A thigh comes up between his legs and brushes Draco through his pants and he nearly comes undone. Frantically, he tears his throat away from Potter's cock and moves up again, straddling his hips properly, rocking with intent.
Goldstein promptly tried to steamroll through James's rambling recollection of the Triwizard Tournament until Draco threatened to hex his rectum inside out. The fucking Ministry could afford an hour or two for James to reconcile some stray pieces of his shattered past. This morning had not been an easy one for the man; he'd recalled far too much pain and death, but he seemed to be holding up well enough.
) for their lightning-fast beta work! What a Drarry squad we have, where I can put up the bat-signal and get two betas on my work within minutes.
He woke to a cold compress, a pot of ginger tea, and Sirius's furrowed brow. Harry avoided his eye and tried to quell the flood of shame that rose up as he sipped the tea. Remus brought him a potion once they deemed him able to keep it down, and he was left with only dread and humiliation in his stomach instead of cramps.
“My parents were driven out of business because of Voldecorp,” she begins. The room falls quiet, side conversations dropping off in a sudden hush. Bellatrix clears her throat pointedly, staring unblinkingly at the young woman. “They might return to India but if Voldecorp is just going to continue expanding globally, it’s hopeless.”
, Potter," Severus S. says. As a manager, he wears a vest - rather than a tunic - that is pinstriped silver. His name-tag, like Draco's, is gold. "Whatever would we do without your...attention?"
Ron flushed red and flicked his wand, sending the old charred envelop zipping down the hall to finally rest in the Evidence storage room. A few lazy sparks still fell from its edges as it disappeared down the hall. Even weeks later, Ron could hardly stand to imagine what sort of scene he would have discovered if Rachel hadn't been in that kitchen with Harry. A blank scroll, just regular office parchment, soaked in a powerful Sparking Potion. As it dried, the potion activated. Given a few more minutes, the lightning would have burned through the parchment. But they were able to douse it before that could happen, recovering just enough singed parchment to run several dozen tests.
, he tried. As soon as he said it, he knew it was the wrong way to go. Malfoy barked a laugh and flipped open his schedule book. Clearly he thought James was pitying him for being sick.
Monty felt something in himself snap. Like an out-of-body experience, he watched himself hurl the ruined cake at the wall. He saw the hot pan clatter to the floor and burnt bread crumble to bits which flew across the polished tiles. He heard himself scream at James, blaming him for the ruined cake
) for making me finally finish this episode that's been sitting in my WIP folder for far too long. And oodles of thanks to Rose (
"Come off it, you sound like - " he cut himself off, going pale. Her heart stuttered at the sight and she grabbed his hand.
"I'll draw this one for you next to keep you warm at night," he whispers with a wink, resisting the urge to claw his own nipples off. Potter looks away, swallowing, and Draco smirks. Victory is worth a dirt-stained shirt, but he could do without the tightness in his trousers.
When they find the cottage, Potter cocks his head like a crup and lets out a bemused sort of grunt. Draco thinks that's a bit rude for proper behavior befitting a
“Transferred, s’what I heard,” Seamus murmurs, leaning on his elbows into the tight circle gathered at the table.
His feet seemed to carry him automatically and he found himself hobbling around the settee in a wide arc so he stood between the intruders and the doorway. He wouldn't have the Killing Curse come anywhere close to his family. Tony moved at once to stand directly behind him, blocking his escape. But he wasn't trying to escape. He wouldn't run this time.
"Starr's is shut down," Nott said. "And Goldstein can't prance back into the Ministry, but there's other ways to make money."
"Come back to the office to sign some forms for the funds," Draco continued. "Greg and Vince are top-rate carpenters. Your new home will be ready by the end of the month."
“Well, outside of Corporate, everyone hates you,” Harry says frankly. Draco closes his eyes and takes a breath, appearing to summon patience from the depths of his soul. “If we stick together, if my reputation rubs off on you, then your department’s safe.”
Remus floundered as if Harry had just proved his point and Harry stared back at him, open and honest. For once, he had nothing to hide, though it felt like a stone was settling in his stomach the longer Remus sat there with his mouth hanging open.
Harry doubles back, the wheels of his cart squeaking louder as he approaches, eyes sparkling behind old NHS frames. Draco is glaring daggers into the drawer and Severus, like a bat, swoops over from Makeup to investigate.
this deep in the forest," Draco snaps. The sun is setting and it's so cold, he's not even feeling up for another squabble. His fingers are painfully stiff and he curses himself for forgoing mittens. "Ask Granger for a refresher on magical interference if you're really so thick as to—"
He watched the man who was once his best friend limp back into the kitchen, hand guiding his young-but-far-too-old son, Arthur.
McGonagall took over from there. She delivered the letters to the boys - when had she lifted those from Remus's pocket? - who read them with all the usual shock and awe and disbelief that always came from Muggleborns. She demonstrated a few simple spells: Arthur and Alec gave identical squeals of surprise when their chairs began floating, and then Arthur became disturbingly well-adjusted to the idea and attempted to stand up while the chair lifted him toward the ceiling.
"It's barely 8:30, how's Monty gone to bed already?" Arthur whispered, pressing his face into the crack under the door. He had sworn he saw Monty's steps retreat into the bedroom earlier after Dad went downstairs.
Long believed to be dead after an apparent attack by dark wizards in Godric's Hollow, Mr. Potter appeared to be in good health, though he walked with a cane and became noticeably uncomfortable with the excitement of the crowd.
Malfoy let the statement hang in the air - literally, as the gold smoke lingered for some time. He cleared his throat and moved to take a sip from his tall glass of water, only to send it careening off the edge of the desk and crashing to the wood floor.
"What's - ah," Draco bit his lip and seemed to reconsider whatever he was going to ask. "Are you looking for something under here?"
"Mrs. Weasley gave us that," Monty answered gruffly, gesturing to the quilt as Dad levitated their trunks down the hall.
, he signed, scrunching the makeshift napkin. James nodded with a pleased smile, eyes bright, and Monty caught himself staring. He adored seeing his little bird like this. October was turning out to be a definite improvement over September.
The Thing next to Remus suddenly whirred back to life and he startled when its copper-coil eyes began glowing. Alec gave a cry of triumph and pointed across the table, his fathers' conversation forgotten.
James had never heard Monty like this. His voice, always loud but warm, was scratchy and hoarse. He was laying into the swears like they were fuel, like they were weapons.
be that Monty's a wizard 'cos it's only Muggles allowed through unless they've got an Auror escort. And he was there when we set the wards so he could've been tied in this whole ti - "
It was a stunning sight on their sitting room floor, one that should be painted by a master and displayed in the History of Magic corridor for posterity. Draco and Harry, leaning against the wall next to the hearth, were totally engrossed in each others' hands yet again. She couldn't think of a time these past three days when they weren't holding hands, or fumbling through oddly tactile and cooperative sign language lessons, or finding some other way to touch.
“Oh…” he gasps, swaying. Potter grabs hold of his shoulders to steady him, his hands resting safely on top of his shirt. But the room is still
, I never intended to duel! It was a cunning ploy to knock points off Gryffindor and help Slytherin pull ahead."
"And you're supplying a bit of poison to help them along?" Blaise quipped as he eyed the three rows of twenty blue vials and three rows of ten green vials.
Monty was dissolving into snorts and giggles, Alec was covering his entire face to keep quiet, and Arthur was in his element.
Ice cut through his heart and he shoved Sirius in the chest, hard. The man nearly went down and Harry wondered when his godfather had become so
Draco had eaten far too much chocolate since Monday. He felt sloppy and sluggish with sugar but his notes were meticulous when he transcribed them carefully into an artful letter. Charming had trusted him once before to review a batch, and Draco had failed him miserably after upending the box onto the floor during that little hostage situation in October. But this time - oh yes, this time he would show that his opinion mattered more than anyone else's. Draco would not let him down.
"The walls are solid and firm, stronger than any storm that might find you there. They're as tall as you'd like, and the windows fit snugly. Can you see if they're painted plaster, or stone, or something else?"
. And then more words came out of his mouth, ones that he had no business screaming at James, or anyone, but which escaped him when James kept staring at him with wide, blank eyes:
"Eh," Blaise shrugged dismissively, flipping open the newspaper once more to the front page. Draco gazed over his shoulder at the massive photo on the front page as the chocolate melted over his tongue.
The feeling was overwhelming: it took over his senses and he was flooded with foreign but intimately familiar sense-memories. The smell of rain, freshly turned earth, blood. The sticky feeling of sweat dampening his shirt, the uncleanliness of wearing clothes that had gone far too long without a wash. A familiar cramp in his stomach, the kind of hunger he hadn't known since the boys were tots. The voices around him faded to something else, a din of noise that didn't scare him but certainly didn't belong in his kitchen, sounding rather like the halls at the boys' primary school -
He's deduced that Danny is a squib or maybe has sworn off the use of his wand. He gave him a potion right off, when Harry was still twitching with the pain of the Cruciatus, but he has yet to see a wand, much less his own.
"I'll make dinner," Alec said, effectively throwing in his lot with Arthur. He squared his shoulders as if facing the firing squad. Dad whirled on him and for all his burning rage, he very well might have been staring down imminent execution.
"It was surreal!" claimed Amity Franklyn, of Cork. "Never thought I'd see another Potter and then there were three of them! All the spitting image of each other, of James [Potter]! I'll tell you, it took me back to my Hogwarts days when James's friends once used Polyjuice Potion to play a prank in class. Half expected Sirius Black to be behind it, to be honest! But the Aurors were there, so it must really be him. Harry, I mean, not James."
"It's a funny school..." Remus muttered as the strong smell of curry hit his nostrils. Mixed with the sweet scent of chocolate, it was an oddly specific combination that threw him back to his sixth year Christmas holidays at the Potter cottage. He could almost hear Euphemia Potter singing in the kitchen, just out of sight, while the Marauders tore apart the house in raucous holiday fun.
She studied her coffee and Harry watched her face carefully. She had changed so much since fourth year. She had grown into herself, was the best way he could describe it. Her hair was just as large but seemed less overwhelming and more suited to her round features; her brows didn't crowd her eyes anymore and instead leant an air of no-nonsense scrutiny. Her eyes were still big, warm, and bright with intelligence, just starting to crease at the edges. She was Hermione Granger, now more than ever, but he doubted her boggart was failing McGonagall's exam.
The words from years ago rang in James's mind as clear as if they'd just been spoken. He peered closely at the stranger in the room, only to realize that he wasn't a stranger at all:
“I really must insist these are found immediately, sir,” Mr. Flamel says, his brow furrowed in grave concern. “I cannot emphasize enough how far certain people would be willing to go to get their hands on these gemstones.” Albus lifts a placating hand.
Monty growled low in his throat, a sure sign of an impending explosion. Out of the corner of his eye, James saw Alec grab Arthur and make a hasty retreat down the hall with their books. He thought he heard Arthur mumble something about the telly exploding, but he could only think that he'd left his wand in the bedroom. If Monty advanced on him again, he wouldn't reach it in time… But this was ridiculous. They were two grown adults, they loved each other. He knew Monty wouldn't hurt him, just as Monty knew he wouldn't punch him in the face - however much he wanted to at the moment.
"A pattern that didn't make sense for the purchaser, who was already well past puberty, and supposedly childless for almost twenty years…" Hermione straightened up, tucking her ankles under her thighs. "He was acting rather shifty when we questioned him, and I - er, well, he
Harry nearly tossed a handful of sawdust at Draco's fancy wool jacket, but only just stopped himself in time to notice that the rags had indeed left two swatches of sticky brown stain on his posh grey trousers. That was revenge enough.
“But not me. I can hold my own without Saint Potter and the Cart that has Never Been Greased, thank you very much.”
Feeling light and only a little nervous, James grasped Draco's hand briefly in solidarity before tucking into his waffles. He didn't miss the not-at-all-subtle winking face drawn in syrup, nor Arthur's stupidly pleased grin. When James had eaten his fill and the boys were nattering on about their plans for the day, he quietly slit open the letter.
Robards, Draco, and the remaining two Aurors were pulled from the pensieve and found themselves back in the Head Auror's office. Weasel had recovered from his laughing fit (though he was still red in the face). His partner, Auror Goldstein, was doing everything in his power to avoid looking in Draco's direction. Because he, at least, was a
"But you can try to convince him!" Weasley pointed out. "He trusts your opinion, Merlin knows why. He listens to you!" Draco felt a flare of annoyance. And just why
That was the kicker. James didn't care about cat-hair, he had just used that as an excuse so Arthur wouldn't resent his brother for the No Cats policy.
he reminded him. This didn't have to be complicated. Grey areas were tricky, but surely this was a black and white issue.
"When did you realize you had been Obliviated?" Robards launched right back into the questioning, the Quick Quotes Quill on his desk scribbling away.
"Someone was called 'dung'..." Charming's signs were slowing down now and his brow furrowed as he tried to recall every detail. "Whoever it was, they argued tae obliviate, no' kill. Someone else wanted tae kill me an' be done it. There were a lot of them, dunno how many." Gibbs was looking pale and sickly now as Charming wrapped up. "He says, a was hearin' a lot voices at once, no sure if it were the a-u-r...the Aurors or the others."
Draco signed. James nodded, screwing a smile into place. It must have looked manic because Draco was alarmed.
I am an Unspeakable, Draco. I can respect obligatory reticence, but I simply cannot let this mystery rest."
Al and Ar were coming home in a couple weeks. They could push this off until after the holidays. Until then…
"Gibbs said he has nightmares and scars...he knows enough to know that he doesn't want to get sucked back into it, I reckon."
"And you, Mister! You're tattling too! A lot! And you're still all slouchy and you still haven't said thank you!"
And it was spoken with such candor that Harry barely felt his heart skip a beat at the moniker. Harry offered a little smile, swallowed down all the conflicting feelings that were rushing to the surface - sorrow, serenity, panic - and nodded. He offered his payment again, praying for this to be over, but Florean closed the register with a wink.
Draco barely raised a brow, choosing to turn to Scorpius instead. Draco was a guest at Scorpius's tea time. He would defer to the little gentleman.
The mild glare slipped into something more neutral. He shrugged one shoulder. Draco noticed how he began tapping his rubber-tipped, brightly painted cane on the soft rug. Nervous energy coming from an uncomfortable man with dark circles under his eyes. Except for the world-famous scar peeking out from under a ridiculous knit cap, Charming looked like a typical new patient in the St. Mungo's Mind Healing outpatient program.
“Dad, what the fuck…?” Arty croaked weakly. Dad didn’t even snap his fingers like he usually did when they swore, he just huffed another laugh, winked, and took off again.
"Do you have one on you?" To his surprise, she offered him a dainty mesh bag of all-too-familiar lemon drops. He chuckled to himself as he popped one in his mouth. Trust Dumbledore to lace his candy with potions…
"Waffles!" Arthur shouted, bursting out of the loo and leading the stampede down the stairs. James wasn't sure he would live to regret teaching them how to make waffles from scratch, but he was glad they were out of the room. With a lurching movement, he rolled back toward Draco, unwrapping himself as he went. Everything seemed, well, less
"The Weasleys are all over this store. They sort of took Harry in, during school. His first family died in a car accident, you see, and his second family was no good at all. But his third family is
"No jealous," he defended, avoid James's glare. "Jus' think therapists need tae respect the boundaries. An' the lout broke yer nose once, James!"
"Draco, this is Lavender," Parvati says, leading a bright-eyed young woman over. "She's taking over Makeup so I can go back to Hair with Cedric."
know you're right," his godfather said, holding a finger up. He sounded strained. He tried to say more, but failed to produce anything besides a sort of growling-sigh.
Potter makes a big show of stepping out of the trousers pooled around his feet, then he toes off his shoes and socks clumsily, nearly falling over.
Also, yes, I KNOW ((now)) that Mr./Ms. [First Name] is strictly a southern-US thing, so just consider it a regional spice from your dumb author. I've adjusted the twins' speech later, but Scorpius's scene is just funnier to me now so I'm leaving it as-is.
"Come look!" Scorpius ran over, all bundled up rather adorably in a puffy Muggle coat and a wool hat. He grabbed them both, one little mittened-hand for each of them, and pulled them outside into the snow.
Harry looked well and truly pitiful, but, ever the Gryffindor, he was still trying to salvage the moment:
"We already knew Mundungus Fletcher was on site," Tony said. He opted to stand at attention next to all the posh furniture rather than sit, though Ron could only guess how he managed it. Tony had been taking the energy potions for just as long as Ron and was looking just as ragged: his straw-yellow hair was dark, greasy, and unwashed, his face pale with overwork and stress, shiny and pocked. His voice carried the same tense, high whine that it had during their final Auror examinations nine years ago. "He survived a few hours but died in St. Mungo's before they could wake him up. Do you remember specifics - how many were there?"
“I’ll get this over to Corporate, Mr. Diggory,” he says, barely sparing a glance at the camera. “Thanks for coming forward. I can complain all I want, but what really counts is an official statement from someone who… Well, someone who isn't as close to the situation as I am.”
"Oh am no sayin' it's mad," Monty said, wiping a tear and heaving himself to his feet. "Am sayin' he musta thought
James eased himself out of the bed they shared. He considered sneaking an extra dose of the new pain relieving potion, knowing he would be pushing it tonight, but decided for a pill instead and hobbled down the stairs with his cane. Maybe he would let Monty put him to bed in the morning. Monday being their day off together, maybe he could convince Monty to join him in bed come morning.
"I told you," Ron muttered to her, though James could clearly hear. "Last Saturday night, he kept doing everything for him, hardly let him out of the chair. It was barmy."
Monty was stunned into stillness and James could feel his heart pounding wildly, his pulse fluttering in his neck. This...this felt like a big deal. Bigger than anything else he'd said to Monty. Almost without conscious thought, his hands went on signing:
"Yeah, I, er… Well, a friend of mine, Luna Lovegood, or I guess she's a friend of a friend, actually the girlfriend of a friend - anyway, she's in the circus and I went to a show once - all the aerialists use standard racing brooms. So I did some research, made some prototypes, and now I'm, er…" He glanced up - Terry still seemed interested - and cleared his throat. "I'm working on my first paid commission now for a stunt broom, and a few more have put in their orders as well."
James looked around wildly, ears tuning into a loud hissing, spraying sound, like a firehose gushing. In the dim, flickering light, a heavy jet of water hit his face and he jerked back, flailing, feeling something on his palm -
He heard all of those stories told by the others tonight and wanted to run away and also to hurl himself back into that world. Danger was abundant: dragons, giant spiders, merpeople holding children hostage underwater, unblockable spells that tortured or instantly killed. But the magic of it all was so enticing, so wonderful. He wanted to fly again, those were always the best dreams. He wanted to charm his shoelaces to tie themselves. He wanted his hands on some chocolate frogs. He wanted to throw a hex at that blond git that sneered at him in so many memories.
The bartender wheeled up to him - literally, she was in a wheelchair - and Harry was so taken aback, he completely forgot the order he’d practiced with Sirius. He stared dumbly across the counter, down at the nonplussed woman who appeared to be in her mid-forties, sporting deep black eyeliner, more ink than Sirius, and a sleeveless top riddled with what looked like...flecks of paint? Her hair was pulled back in a messy ponytail that resembled Ginny’s after a brutal game and she wore fingerless leather gloves.
James cringed. The Nighttime Incident. He hadn’t actually wet the bed, couldn’t they call it something else?
"Bit scary, sometimes," was all he managed. And it was, sometimes. But not always. Sometimes he liked it. Watching faces form in the walls, or hearing unhurried footsteps pass by. The voices of his friends, and even his rivals, carrying on. It went beyond his games of pretend if he could really see it, hear it. Even these days, alone in his little workshop, he could spend ages watching the knots in his latest lumber delivery; knots that wriggled around like busy insects, teaming with life and purpose.
They're quiet as they steal away from the others. Potter leads him to a path, down the path, then away from the path. Draco grumbles something about something—he's not sure what he says—and Potter grumbles back—he's not sure what he hears. Their snappy words and crunchy footsteps fill the crushing silence of the Forbidden Forest as they forge a new path far from the thestrals.
“I’m not sure what you want me to apologize for,” he said evenly. “Can’t seem to remember much of last night.” He sipped his tea and decided to set James up with a proper supply soon; tea bags were awful.
Narcissa ordered, moving to help Arthur escape Draco's grip. Draco blinked and allowed his mother to help him unclench his hands, and then Arthur threw himself at James. Alec trembled in the crook of one arm, clutching him tightly, while Arthur sat on his lap, stiff, unyielding, and screaming hoarsely into his neck. James couldn't do much else but hold them.
He pushed through the kitchen door and stifled a grown: the stupid ABBA album was playing. But instead of pots, pans, trays, and ingredients laid out on every surface, there was only a stack of old board games on the kitchen table. Dad sat at the table, facing away from him as he set up one of the games. Alec caught his eye and shrugged, looking at least half as bewildered as Arthur felt.
"And you're a specialist now, hidden away in the dark recesses of the Janus Thickey Ward," Blaise went on, maintaining that infuriatingly innocent tone. "Why would Potter go to you for a limp?"
"Who in seven hells told you - " he cried, recoiling as if the idea offended him. "Girls are - no, I'm - I'm very gay, thank you."
"It's one in the morning, Weasel," Draco grumbled as he descended the stairs, resisting the urge to rub at his itching eyes. "What brings you and your freckles to my parlor at one in the morning?"
"This isn't real," Harry blurted. He shook his head even as he wandered the space, touching every surface, taking it all in. "This isn't - Draco!" He turned on his heel to face the bastard who was looking more pleased with each passing second of Harry's awe. "This can't - how - this can't be
"Merlin's beard - " the little boy muttered under his breath, reaching with his entire body over Harry's shoulder to grip the door handle. Harry reared back - did he say Merlin?! - as Scorpius pushed the door open, upending his precarious balance and sending the child toppling forward with a squeal.
Surely all those memory potions were just messing with his head, or the wine really was distorting his hearing.
Vague memories flashed across Ron's mind - playing Quidditch obsessively for days and days at the Burrow. The sun shone bright all week. The sky was clear. The ground was dry and hard, providing a good kick off -
Arty spluttered through his sip of water and Alec dropped his fork, looking up at McGonagall with huge, round eyes.
"Then I'll send you over to Healer Abbott for your physical. She's just down the hall, Room 104. She'll be expecting you." Draco stood and, after a moment of hesitation, extended his hand. Charming shook it firmly before taking up his cane again. "Good day."
Monty sounded tearful and he felt a spark of anger return to him. Good. James certainly had no energy to summon any tears, so let the wanker cry instead. He threw himself down onto his pillow and faced away from the door, hoping sleep would take him away from this.
When there was nothing left to say, when it had all been recounted in actual, concrete words, James felt less overwhelmed, though still numb. And when there were no more tears to cry, James was finally able to unwind. As he drifted away from Ron and Hermione's guest room, he thought he felt Draco press a kiss to his hand.
In a way, it was their shop. As much as James wanted to claim it as his own, he knew he owed Monty more than a salary. Another twinge of guilt tugged at his heart, but a small part of him cursed his past self for allowing Monty to insert himself so completely when he could have done it all himself with a little more effort.
If he was honest with himself, which he obstinately was not, he might've had to admit that he missed Charming, in a way. Missed his sass, his comically expressive face, his nervous ticks. The easy way his calloused, scarred, burn-covered hands could form a series of complicated signs like it was nothing, as easy as breathing. How Draco could almost understand what he was saying even without the charm's smokey translation; his expressions and his postures would combine with the more obvious signs to tell Draco what he wanted to say. It was like watching poetry, the way those hands moved. He wanted to see them make chocolate.
"Not so much anymore," he answered. "Toast, soup - whatever's easy." Sometime over the past decade or so, the memories of slaving over the hob at Privet Drive faded into a vague concept.
was sorry, to tell him that he hadn't known what that spell did and hadn't even given a second thought before - "No, Potter...you don't get to say anything this time. You talk too much." Draco smirked weakly at him, still hunching low over the table, and James frowned.
, he finally said, wondering in the back of his mind if that was even true. It had to be. He was human, he had a soul, he loved James. Of course he would do what was right by him. A bloody spell - it couldn't understand James like Monty could, it would get him all wrong!
Harry nodded, ignoring the flicker of guilt that came from the knowledge that, somehow, Draco hadn't seemed to piece together his true identity. Harry chose to think of it as a minor miracle rather than consider the idea that Draco
Please mark your lunches with a name & date. Unclaimed food & food older than seven (7) days will be thrown out every Friday.
"Well," she heard herself speak. "What shall we bring?" Ron didn't answer, he just kept staring at the scuffed hardwood floor under his feet. He had another hour to go before he had to report to the Auror office, but Hermione would have to leave in the next five minutes if she wanted to be on time. Granted, Unspeakables were never the most punctual lot, but she had her own standards to maintain. "Ron?"
Except James had never been able to settle on an exact cut-off age for what was considered a “newborn” and had refused to take the boys on a bus for several years after that.
In the Danny Days of Old, Harry is still finding his bearings. It doesn't seem so long ago that Voldemort was killed in the graveyard after the Third Task. When he closes his eyes, he still sees Cedric's lifeless eyes, still sees echoes of his parents blossoming out of Voldemort's wand. He still hears the awful squelching, tearing sound as his panicked
Harry scrambled up and chased after the mysterious git who was already halfway out the door. "Wait! But, it's - ! Where - how - "
Draco tugs at his collar, loosening his tie and undoing the top few buttons of his shirt. They can’t properly indulge if they’re not comfortable, he decides as he sheds his cloak. Potter watches him dazedly before following his lead. They sling their cloaks and outer robes over the bed and Draco’s breath catches. Potter looks positively edible with his tie loose, his glasses askew, and his hair even more mussed than usual.
"Listen," Cedric goes on, cocking a brow at Bellatrix. "I don't think it's appropriate to have something like that up there," he says in a firm voice, nodding at the board.
Unbelievable, that James assumed he would come back to bed now after he spent six hours lounging in the kitchen with Malfoy. He and Malfoy were arguing about
"But so much is still new to you, and I..." Sirius cleared his throat, looking like he'd rather eat his favorite arm before continuing this torturous conversation. "I get scared
that McGonagall woman had said. He did count it. He counted all three as perfectly valid reasons to keep Al and Ar away from that mad world.
Kim waited, but Harry couldn't even shake his head 'no.' They actually reached the silo across the field today, which told Harry that Kim wasn't going to let this one go. Sometimes she extended their sessions when there was something particularly troublesome to unravel. Harry reached out and placed his palm against the dark, weathered wood which was warping slightly against the curve of the wall. He craned his neck back to watch the silo seemingly disappear into the bright blue sky.
"Potter!" Draco throws his arms around him. Potter's sweat isn't as tantalizing as it was just moments ago; now it's slippery and making it hard to just hold
"I was so angry..." Draco swallowed thickly, not looking up from James's hands. "You stalked me all bloody year and then you - you saw - "
Another quiet Christmas at Malfoy Manor. Or as quiet as it could get with his father raving at the top of his lungs in the east wing and with Scorpius belting out Christmas songs with the house elves in the kitchens. Tone-deaf buggers, the lot of them, Scorpius included. Astoria fucked off after lunch to visit her parents, leaving Draco to sedate his father and entertain his mother.
"It just doesn't sound like Monty..." she said after he recounted a particularly vicious row in their kitchen some weeks ago. "He's never - he's never hurt you, has he?" she asked suddenly, her heart sinking at the implications.
Draco gave one of his little smirks and moved in to grasp both of his hands. James was always amazed by how smoothly Draco could transition a position like that into a hug - how did that work? How could he go from holding both hands to holding an armful of man in the span of a second? It was smooth as hell. Nothing like the grabby sort of touches he'd shared with Monty -
Harry raised his brows and pursed his lips, looking at Florean pointedly. He shook his head minutely, desperately.
"You should be fine… But don't cut yourself open on any rogue Muggle technology today, just in case."
James asked, raising a brow and trying to maintain his best I Am A Business-Owner expression. His boy had skills. He would have to get used to negotiating commissions.
going on here, even if James refused to acknowledge it. He may not have even recognized it, always seeing the good in people. But Draco Malfoy would make his move soon. Being James's Mind Healer, the prat would know just how to manipulate him into getting what he wanted.
But the floor beneath his feet was firm and thinly carpeted, not soft with sodden, rotted boards. He sucked in a cleansing breath. He wasn't there. Wherever
It was brilliant as ever, of course, but teeming with crowds in the late-August school shopping rush. Draco grabbed Scorpius's hand to keep him close, and to Harry's surprise and only slight horror, Scorpius took hold of Harry's hand as well.
He threw himself down on the settee - on James's side, since she'd taken his. He tried to push away the memory of that morning's visit to the shop in Aberdeen, before it opened, before Beatrice arrived. He tried to push away the way James had looked at him after his shit comment and little smirk, but it was burned into his mind's eye.
On the other hand, Monty's complaints weren't entirely unfounded. Harry was spending all his time with Malfoy, which was a sight he never thought to see. Ron knew better than anyone how much of a prat Harry could be sometimes and tonight he was showing his finest passive aggressive moves. He hardly replied to Monty's conversation starters, and when he did, he pointedly dragged Malfoy into the discussion. It was as if he wanted to intentionally test Monty's patience.
“Haz,” he said. How long was too long for shaking hands? He quickly and unceremoniously dropped Malfoy’s very soft hand as he scrambled for a last name. “Er, Haz Blue.”
This charming antique cottage has been magically expanded to accommodate pets and creatures of a larger variety. Reinforced doors and shutters for added security. The spacious kitchen is supplied with an ice box full of takeout containers and a rarely used breakfast nook. The office serves as a small library in addition to the built-in shelves in the sitting room. A shed, added in 2002, for the aspiring Muggle mechanic. Conveniently located on the outskirts of Hogsmeade. The Forbidden Forest borders the massive back garden with picturesque mountains in the distance.
He took a breath, feeling as if he stood on the edge of a cliff. His hands started signing, almost automatically.
"But why's it all made up like this?" Alec pressed. "Who's been kippin' out here?" Monty's eyes darted to the hall where Dad had disappeared for the moment.
"Yes, you're like all the others, I can…" She sniffs grandly. "Ohhh, I can smell it now… I was hoping you'd grant me a chance to explain. So eager to judge these days, even when—" her voice stutters and her eyes fill with tears. Draco feels like an arse. The nodding bobbles, shifts into something else, and she shakes her head instead, as if to clear it. "It's a lost art, you know. Cooking magic."
"Ah no, James," Monty said softly, crawling over to wrap him up in his muscular arms. He was warm. Pleasantly so in the cold, wet bedding. Not too hot. Not like the fire. James felt more tears leak out. The smell… He had never smelled anything like it before, burning flesh -
"BOYS!" Monty called. Remus and McGonagall had yet to make a move since Harry's entrance, even when Harry clearly gestured for them to take their seats. Remus wanted to stop staring, wanted to play along with Harry's casual act, but he was stuck...he didn't think he'd ever be unstuck again in his life.
of thunder tore through the kitchen. His ribs reverberated with the force of it. The light fixture overhead popped, raining down glass, and he ducked his head under the open oven door, pulling Rachel down with him.
and for Viktor's football team/position! (Again, his position isn't mentioned here...but he's a striker, okay? There. Mentioned. No idea what it means, but it's been mentioned now.)
. He could use some time to himself after today. A hot bath would be nice. Banishing the water straight onto Harry's side of the bed would be even better.
Potter lets slip a moan and the vibrations enter Draco through his lips, through his fingers. His cock twitches with interest and frankly, he can't think of anything more interesting than snogging Potter's brains out until he forgets about the damn door. He pulls Potter's stupid face closer, cramming those sweet lips against his own. Potter moans again and the feel of it courses through Draco like fire.
What Monty was suggesting was massive: it could be bigger than their relationship, bigger than their entire history as lovers, friends, co-workers. It was asking for another ten years, or twenty, or maybe even a life-time, or to end in disaster. James wasn't prepared for that kind of investment. He had spent the last eleven years dealing with the last life-blow that tied him down to an anchor. For the first time in living memory, James was enjoying his freedom, his independence; he couldn't sign himself up for the next anchor.
Potter fists his scorched fingers through the trousers and throws his weight against the door. For a heart-stopping moment, Draco thinks the click meant nothing, it was just another trick up the old witch's sleeve! But then Potter grunts, shifts, his arse perks up a little as he engages his thighs, and the heavy door swings out.
Draco nods, sending a significant look at Harry. Harry squints and shakes his head, gesturing for him to elaborate.
“The romance author. She has a whole series of medical rendezvous. I’m certain you’ll like her work.”
And then he had to follow it up with another Talk, because Alec was still asking questions about kissing.
James wasn’t sure why he added that last part but it seemed important for some reason. He and Aarti had been more focused on the pregnancy, on paying the heating bill, than on their relationship. They hadn’t ruled anything out for the future; they still pursued
Monty was trying very hard not to start shouting. It would only upset James, and he was looking peaky enough on that hospital bed. But the doctors - Healers, whatever these magic people called themselves - could act a bit more concerned.
simmering under the surface, though James thought they had successfully steered it toward a healthy banter instead of the violence and suspicion of the past. In the six weeks they had spent together as Healer and Loon, Malfoy was normally the cool and aloof sort that could transition smoothly into theatrical and candid. He was posh and vulgar, understanding and judgmental. Not at all like the professional berk that was blinking blankly at him today.
He remembered how oddly quiet their home was when Alec went to space camp every summer, and that was only a week. One week! And he always had Arthur to keep him company then. Now he would just have Monty, and a small bitter part of him was angry at Monty for encouraging this stupid bloody magic nonsense in the first place. It was all his fault.
The moment he deemed the adjacent alley clear, he Apparated back to Hogsmeade and took off at a sprint toward Hogwarts.
"It'll be on your terms," she added. That much they could agree on. James needed to regain some control.
"It's not the same and you know it," Alec huffed, folding his arms across his chest. Arthur nodded and copied his brother. United front. That's what they needed to convince their father. It worked about half the time.
sign. But it wasn't. It was a peace offering, a thanks-for-not-giving-up-on-us gift; it was his blessing for Monty to keep selling cakes in the shop despite the rocky start they'd had. It was not what Monty saw.
"By ten points!" Daddy's voice went high like it sometimes did when he was upset, but he was grinning too.
"Monty's not your family, Harry," she whispered, curling a hand over a wayward lock of Hugo's hair. "He may once have been but he forfeited that. He did, not you. You owe your children a happy father and you couldn't give them that if you'd let him stay."
she shouted back, hands coated in product as she twisted her hair into a desperate plait. She heard Ron groan - which meant it was a massive, melodramatic groan, seeing as he was on the sofa and she was up the stairs, down the hall, through the master bedroom, and in their private loo - but the phone stopped ringing a moment later when he answered it.
Finally deciding that Terry, a former Quidditch player, wasn't feigning interest to be polite, Harry launched into a lengthy explanation. The paperbark tree was rubbery and spongy, an excellent option for stunts that were hard on both the broom and the body. The broom was heavier - both denser and thicker in girth - for better control, more momentum, all in all less effort for intense stunts. Speed wasn't so much a factor as stability, so the twigs could be steeped in potions and thickly plaited with charmed ribbons for special effects in a circus act.
" - and a nicely equipped kitchen, though by no means at its full potential. Do you cook, ah, Haz?" Malfoy stumbled over his name and Harry smiled indulgently. Was it a pureblood thing, this battle to call him Haz instead of Blue? Inwardly, he both cringed and squirmed with glee at the thought of Malfoy discovering his more-and-also-less-strange client was Harry Potter.
It was eerie to be sitting here in his office again, with Blaise, discussing Harry Potter. Just a month ago, he was tied to this same chair as "Blaise" ruthlessly tortured him for information. He ran a hand through the offensive fuzz atop his head. It wasn't even long enough to slick back yet. He looked mad. He would know, working in the Janus Thickey Ward.
Ears ringing, Harry smashed the tap closed so hard he felt his hand bruise. He heard his godfather's chuckling retreat down the hall and figured he was safe, figured Sirius wouldn't go so far as to punish him anyway, but still he felt sick. Unclean, even after the shower, even though he hadn't actually done
Across the way stood a long row of exceedingly nice houses - not quite manors, but large and stately at any rate. As he approached the far border of the park, he rested on a bench, leaning his back against the armrest and kicking his legs up onto the length of the seat. He crooked an arm over the back of the bench and turned to watch an older couple leave a home with an Open House sign mounted in the front garden. He wondered what the great big house was like inside. Maybe he should take the tour…
“Charmed,” Draco said in greeting, letting the smirk slip free. Charming looked heavenward in a very Potter-like fashion. Between Charming and Granger sat Montgomery Gibbs, the brawny Muggle man from the photo in the Daily Prophet. Gibbs gave a wide, happy grin. Probably because he was a wide, happy idiot. “What is it you’re looking to achieve in seeing a Mind Healer, Mr. Charming?”
"Too late for that, come on through!" Monty clapped a warm hand on his shoulder and shoved him through the door behind the front counter.
Draco wanted to spit. Textbook emotional manipulation. James had explained the bare bones of what went down between him and his Muggle - something about control issues, jealousy. Draco could take a guess what that meant. Gibbs never liked him and the feeling was mutual. He knew their therapy sessions had played no small role in Gibbs's descent into madness, but he also knew that James had dodged something horrible here. Or rather he hadn't dodged it, he'd actually been hit by it, no doubt hurt by it, and yet still managed to get out from under it before it crushed him.
The pang in Draco's stomach was much less than it would have been if he had heard this comment ten years ago, but it still hurt, even from Blaise. And he wanted this conversation to end ten minutes ago.
He woke up crying. Monty was snoring next to him. Shaking, James slipped out of bed and down the stairs, leaving his cane behind and relishing the pain that kept him grounded in reality. Every blink, every dark corner, he saw Arthur. He could still hear Alec's voice ringing in his ears.
"As I live and breathe," Florean whispered, eyes going wide. Draco hesitated and looked back at the exchange, catching Scorpius before he could wander back outside.
"Perhaps he could take the train in," Remus suggested tentatively, prompting loud protests from the twins. Teddy pushed a nervous hand through his bright hair. "I'll get him home again once we've arrived."
CW: a disjointed dream features drowning, but no one has actually drowned. You can skip that scene (November 15th) without missing any plot development, or pick up again four paragraphs from the end of that scene.
James followed and Hermione put up a hand between them, as if she could stop him from following. He snarled at her and pushed past, limping after them. He would see them on the train, he would ride the train himself if he had to -
"Sh-shh-shhhh…" Potter's voice is soft and urgent. Draco throws his hand off, glaring hotly, but Potter doesn't spare him a glance. He gestures around a copse of trees and Draco goes rigid.
Lupin and McGonagall took up their usual seats across from James and Monty. Ron Weasley-Granger and Hermione Granger-Weasley sat to McGonagall's right. Molly and Arthur Weasley - Ron's parents - chose to sit at James's side. (James tried very hard not to wonder if he had subconsciously named his own son after the balding stranger next to him.) Next to Lupin was his thirteen-year-old son, Teddy. Teddy sported fashionable turquoise hair that Arty was eyeing with envy. Not what he would have expected for the child of Remus Lupin, but he quite liked the boy.
Ron and Hermione had laughed themselves half-sick Tuesday when they gathered at the Three Broomsticks.
To his credit, James did not collapse at the sight of a clearly bald Draco Malfoy wearing an ill-fitted tartan beret. James greeted the Malfoys calmly, offering young Scorpius (dressed in sharp semi-formal Muggle clothes with a perfectly tailored robe slung over Malfoy Senior's arm) a sprinkle-coated white chocolate truffle. It won his favor immediately and earned a funny frown from Malfoy when some of the sprinkles ended up crushed into the boy's trousers, so, a double-win in James's opinion.
Harry let himself find that temperature, and it indeed came from the sun. The space was indistinct but there was plenty of sun and the windows were huge and, lacking divided panes, practically invisible.
"Still nineteen to eighteen," he breathed, reaching into the box to choose his winning level-piece. "Got anything else? Going once - twice - "
“You’re coming home, Harry,” Sirius said, and Harry nodded again but didn’t know what the heck he meant. Hogwarts? The Burrow? Surely not the Dursleys; he didn't think he could stand a new set of bars over his old bedroom window.
The shop looked completely different when it was deserted: modest in size, it featured several narrow display cases crammed together in the middle of the room, showing off an enticing array of shiny chocolates, cheerful gift-boxes, and brightly colored foil. Behind the long front counter was a door with a gold hand-plate on it - presumably to push through to the kitchen - and a doorway that revealed a lopsided set of stairs leading up.
"Do you know," Remus grinned broadly, "it'll be my first proper visit? Found them in a Muggle mail-order catalog at the Hogsmeade post office."
, James signed with a shit-eating grin. Monty didn't want to talk about Malfoy but he let James go on.
James could remember a deluded time in his life, just after the war, when he imagined nothing else for his future than to crush the three year Auror training program, graduate with an honor or two, and work forever with Ron at his side. They would wear the blood red robes with the shiny gold clasps, sporting matching badges and custom wrist holsters. He’d marry Ginny, wait a few years before having kids, and spend every Sunday at the Burrow. He certainly never thought he’d be a humble chocolatier as Ron ran himself ragged to keep him safe while his Auror partner - some Ravenclaw James barely remembered from school - vanished without a trace.
"Stop it, button," Monty muttered lowly so that no one but James could hear. James lifted his chin slightly but didn't respond to the mind-reading git. "We'll see 'em off an' then we'll go fer some ice cream."
. He met the eye of one of the snickering men, who winked and lifted a glass of something bubbly as if in toast to his discomfort.
James kept signing, but Monty turned away. He seized the piping bag again and got to work. He wished James would shut up and do the same.
Charming’s eyes widened and he went a little pale. Draco didn’t even need him to shake his head in the negative this time, his answer was already clear.
"I can't tell you anything anyway!" Draco spluttered before the next barrage of slugs hit. Blaise hesitated, wand raised. "There's a clause in every patient contract.
smelled that before. He couldn't smell anything in regular dreams, this was real, or close enough to it. At some point in his life, he had smelled a real person burning up, had heard a real person screaming for their life before going silent…
"Don't let this put you off Malfoy - I mean it, Harry!" she warned. "He's done you a world of good. Even Ron sees it."
“Just use the spell,” she rasped, flicking her wand. The grater in his hand came to life and started shredding the chocolate bar he was working on.
right?" Harry clenched his hand into a fist and took it off the table, away from prying eyes. "Your fifth year, there was a corrupt ministry official who came to teach. She had it out for you, what with the war picking up and politics not being pure as the driven snow… She gave you detention, had you write lines with a blood quill, which left you with that scar."
"Prism's a hell of a potion," Blaise said by way of explanation. "He's still in holding at the Ministry. Seeing as he hasn't been rushed to emergency, I suspect that's a good sign."
“Draco Malfoy, I’m the real estate agent for this property,” he said rather formally. He stuck out his hand, and with a jolt, Harry realized he hadn’t been recognized. With a giddy grin taking over his face, he shook Malfoy’s hand. It was ridiculously soft.
"No..." Draco abandoned the vials in favor of staring at Blaise in quiet shock. "Is...is he alright?"
Sealing up Charming's file and banishing it to the Ministry, Draco idly noted that he would have to find a new source for his chocolate supply. Potter had tainted Charming Chocolates after all.
. He panted unevenly, willing his heart to calm and his stomach to settle, before stepping out of the shower and covering up quickly with a big, fluffy towel.
Harry finally swallowed and took a sip of tea to wash it down. “One more round.” He'd been working on his facial hair. It was little more than itchy scruff, but he was deliriously proud of it already. He looked like a
Draco said nothing and simply pointed at the boy with the more outlandish clothes, by way of explanation.
“Oh, I like her,” Pansy says. Her suave facade is beginning to crack and she looks a bit stressed. “I like her very much.”
"They do. Springs are cheaper. Cleaner. Last longer." Potter's not quite back to sounding dazed, and he's not quite panicking, but the conversation has taken a weird turn. They're sitting on a tiny bed, locked in a possible oven, trouserless. And Potter's talking about mattress quality.
, James explained, watching him examine the little buttons. Draco pressed a button experimentally and recoiled slightly when the mobile emitted a loud beep. James had been staying at the Manor all week while "a discrete and certified team" dealt with his kitchen. As he watched Draco flip the phone closed and open, closed and open, he dreaded to think what damage a team of Ministry wizards would do to his tried and true Muggle appliances.
"Two wizards with no children," Ron mumbled. "Not aggressive, but there's no reason for them to be here." The tension in his voice shot straight to James's spine. He wanted to hover over his kids, to cover their vulnerable bodies with his own until they were on the train, and he would tear apart anyone who so much as looked at them -
He should have skipped dinner. He could be cataloguing James's progress for further refinement in his memory-recovery system. He hadn't yet. He didn't feel entitled to do so, seeing as James wasn't actually his patient.
Harry cringed and steeled himself, trying to square his shoulders as best he could in the cramped space. He'd faced down Voldemort once, a lifetime or so ago, but this was so much worse. He really liked Draco, with his fitted clothes, posh accent, and good posture. His patient, uncompromising love for Scorpius. His cheeks when they went pink. He'd rather face a dozen dark lords than let Draco down, and to have his confession pressed out of him like this was worse than the Cruciatus!
This chapter spans a full month, but the first half is just one very long day.  Hang in there, readers!  I promise it's worth it.
Monty scoffed. It wasn't a competition, their respective signing skills, but he had been raised by Deaf parents. Before meeting Monty, James had only known what Aarti and some books could teach him. Monty had opened a whole new world for him once James had let him
Draco was glad Blaise had left and there were no witnesses to this momentous occasion. His cheeks turned pink and he tried to remember how to accept compliments.
Malfoy shared his own experiences as a parent. He had a six-year-old boy, Scorpius, and did not appreciate James’s barrage of comments on that ridiculous name. Malfoy and Astoria (
Because they were obviously in love, Harry and Monty. The Scottish man was loud, boisterous, full of a raucous energy that could only be compared to fireworks or a very close Quidditch match. Harry met him tit for tat, answering it all with looks, touches, and signs. He fed off of it, sometimes he signed back and seemed to push for more. Ron knew when someone was taking the piss, even silently and in another language, and Harry had plenty of practice with Monty and his boys. It was everything Ron had ever wanted for Harry: a family, a happy life, a noisy kitchen, plenty of chocolate.
"It's not really sanitary, is it?" he asks one day over breakfast or lunch or dinner or whatever it is they are sharing at the little table in this room. Denny frowns at him. "Eating in the loo, I mean."
Ron lifted the letters out of Rose's reach and read them while Hermione took over feeding Hugo. Honestly, they had their hands full and these grown men needed to sort out their own problems. But Hermione had never been one to leave Harry wallowing in his stupidity for long.
“You went with the alliteration route,” Malfoy said, smirking in a not unfriendly way. "How charmingly original."
"Spare me," Robards said, holding up a hand. "It's for the transcript." He scrubbed a hand over his stubbled face as he studied the stack of parchment that was the result of hours of questioning.
“Okay, hear me out..." Harry lifts his hands as if to soothe an irate animal. This only annoys Draco. “You’ve got an in with Corporate and you can get away with a lot more. I need to hear about the other departments, see who’s on the chopping block, so to speak.”
Something about that hospital had screamed the name Arthur to him. And he could call him Arty, like a little Aarti Junior. It was perfect.
And that was the last of his consecutive memories for the night. From there, he was left with bits and pieces that sort of went together like puzzle pieces of the same general area of the puzzle, but which didn't quite fit.
"Oi, what's this?" Arty asked with a laugh, taking in the sight of the sitting room. The old sofa sat low to the ground as always. But now there were pillows on one end and blankets piled up over the cushions. A new quilt covered the back.
That morning, Draco had been complaining loudly (professionally) in the lounge while he played a rousing game of chess (which he eventually declared a draw after Mr. Longbottom cunningly neglected to respond to his opening move). The Muggle Moron was making it impossible to communicate adequately with his newest patient, always inserting his own opinions and whinging about this or that when he was only needed as a translator.
"Ye have me!" Monty cried, throwing the piping bag down. "Ye have me, the boys, and Ron and Hermione! Dean! Seamus!"
Harry practically threw himself into the hammock, which swung wildly toward the window before swinging back into the room. Sun shone through the angled windows in the ceiling and he beamed at the brilliant blue sky overhead and at his side.
Looking back later, Monty could narrow it down to several triggers: the obnoxious car commercial blaring away instead of music; James coming to a dead stop in the kitchen when there was plenty of work to be done, for the sake of watching Monty like a hawk; finally, the burned and ruined cake he salvaged from the oven after spending far too long minding the batter that was in the mixer, just to avoid facing James.
"Not really your forte though, is it?" Ron asked, narrowing his eyes. Zabini had been under investigation just months ago. What were they thinking in the Department of Mysteries, to send Zabini as the consult on
He nearly leapt out of his skin when two arms encircled him from behind. The touch was more tentative than secure. He turned, looking down at James with a sneer automatically taking over even as his mind screamed words at him like
"Oh yes, right. My right leg is broken, Daddy." Malfoy nodded seriously and tapped his little khaki trousers at various points, earning a dramatic hiss from Scorpius.
With his boys home and James's smile reaching his eyes again - not just when he was chatting with Malfoy - Monty grudgingly admitted to himself that it was a wholesome night...even if it
McGonagall gave him a sharp look over her spectacles. "Don't think I haven't noticed those little parcels you squirrel away every month. I suspect I won't have to twist your arm to get you to visit Charming Chocolates in person."
"I met one yesterday," he explained, blunt as ever. He seemed to have forgotten how to soften his words. "I'm twenty-eight. Twenty-
He didn't know what he expected from them when they came home to a life of Draco and Scorpius popping by nearly every day. Monty had integrated into their lives so slowly, as his co-worker first, then his only friend, then his only employee, and
Draco whipped out his wand and threw a stinging hex at his father's arm. Lucius immediately dropped the owl, which fell to the floor. Draco stooped low to gather it from the shiny marble. It was skittery and ruffled, hooting in outrage and panic. He cooed softly at it while Lucius retreated, ranting about traitors to the cause.
" he breathed, looking skyward as if he were welcoming some sort of cosmic event. "Three days on sabbatical and I'm going barmy. How'd we used to go all summer with nothing to do? Is it the kids, have they ruined my laze?"
Wrapped up tight like a burrito, adequately concealed, James smiled serenely and contemplated going back to sleep out there on the hard floor, several feet from the pallet. The boys grumbled and groaned before carting Scorpius down the hall to get ready for the day.
James threw the pillow across the room and dragged himself out of bed again. He tried the door, then had to turn around and retrieve his wand to unlock it. He swung the door open and came face to teary face with Monty.
Manners and decorum fly out the non-existent window. He doesn’t care if they spend all night in the freezing cold, they have to get out. He has to get Potter out.
. What is that? Where are you from?" He could almost place where he had heard that accent, it was just out of his reach. As a Mind Healer specializing in memory, this kind of thing drove him up the wall. "And he'd never pair that cravat with lilac trimmed robes!"
a business? He hadn't been around all those nights that James spent awake, perfecting his recipes; he had still been working at the bakery while James carted the boys around town, promoting the mail-order. Monty only jumped in once the bank had invested and the shop was purchased. Granted, he could likely skip half the effort if he used James's hard-won foundation to jump-start his own project. But what if it all fell apart? Would Charming Chocolates go down with it? With all the tension lately, the rows and strained meals, would their relationship even
Draco sat up gingerly, prodding his own side to test for broken ribs. All seemed fine, unfortunately. He could only imagine the top-rate whinging he would be entitled to if his fiancé had broken him with his proposal.
, he began. Of course, back then his exact age had been an approximation. They said he was eighteen when he woke up in hospital, back strapped to a board, leg in traction, hip reduced to grit. They estimated he was thereabouts anyway and the paperwork was easier if he was of age. July 1st became his new birthday.
The idea of it had always intrigued him: it featured in all of the best (in his opinion) bedtime stories that he read to his boys and it was a popular theme for their shop at Halloween. Witch hats and brooms and cauldrons decorated the shop nearly every October, except last year, when Arthur finally convinced him to go with a superhero theme instead. (Which proved to be much more popular than James would like to admit.)
Gryffindor and Slytherin tables are on opposite sides of the Hall, but that doesn't keep them from their morning round of taunts. Draco hardly knows what he's saying sometimes, the cutting words are automatic. He only knows that he never feels properly hungry until he’s screaming across the sea of students at Saint Potter, the God of Gryffindor. And then he wants a heaping plate of greasy sausages.
A few customers were pressing their noses against the glass when they arrived. One of their regulars approached Dad, who grimaced.
Potter's highly publicized return to the wizarding world was still shrouded in mystery, but that shroud was being pulled back little by little. The public knew nothing of his amnesia and little of his injuries; they knew his children went to Hogwarts and, thanks to some blabbermouth students, they knew his children went by the name Charming. A farce of a name and oh so easily traced back to a reasonably popular chocolate shop in Scotland.
"There was a war, years ago, in the magical world. It started picking up in Harry's fifth year," he tapped the photo, "and by what should have been his seventh year, Harry and his friends dropped out of school to help in the fight." How to explain that Harry Potter was at the center of this war? He couldn't do it… His voice was on automatic and he barely thought about what he was saying. "May 2nd, 1998, the war was won, largely by Harry's efforts. And his friends. But Harry dealt the final blow."
As Malfoy went on about converting one of the large coops into a workshop for his brooms, and another for a proper showroom, Harry made his way back to the path, chagrined and covered in muck, and followed him to the little shack of a house not too far away.
Presents were wrapped in varying papers, some brown, some just plain Prophet newspaper, some bright and moving. James didn't bother breaking out a trash bag this year, as he could simply vanish the mess with his wand when it became too much. Magic was great for aesthetics.
She shrugged, but her grin slipped free and Ron made a sort of drawn out sighing, snorting, gagging noise.
"Give up the Point Me spell and you can do your own bloody warming charms," Draco suggests, casting the charm anyway.
like his grandmother. Draco excused himself, promising to be quick, and found a note waiting for him in the parlor.
“Cramp! Cramp!” is all he can manage right now. Potter shifts under him, grunts as if in pain, and then his shifting becomes more urgent. Draco’s cock is enjoying the activity despite the pain in his leg, but Potter clearly isn’t.
"Graham?" his new partner supplied flatly, obviously impressed. "Didn't you go to school with all three?"
forgotten it, he had forgotten it all. His wand, his magic, his Dudley, Seamus, Neville, and certainly his bloody Malfoy. And now that James was remembering, he forgot that Monty wasn't a part of all that old nonsense. Could never really be a part of it.
Ron also saw that Harry had sampled too much of the coffee cake, which was criminally delicious, a possible source of the jitters, and apparently Harry's new favorite food. Which Monty may or may not have (but definitely had) noticed. The Scottish man, Ron observed, took great pride in offering everyone a piece except Malfoy, who couldn't seem to care less. Blaise and Dean hit it off right away while Seamus attempted to rekindle his easy friendship with Monty, who was much too distracted to notice.
He pumped a fist in the air but suddenly Dad was laying all sorts of cards from his hand. Another monster - Level 18 Big Daddy! - that came with a Plus 3 Bonus against Arthur's Wizard. "Nooo! Da', stop it!" He could see his victory slipping away with every traitorous card! He frantically searched his hand and tossed out a Bonus to counteract at least some of the damage.
He knew he was being a bit reckless with these safety precautions, just as Harry had been before this mess. He knew it was probably prudent to have an Auror around, however annoying it was to have a nanny forced on him every hour of the day. He knew he should have pulled his wand without prompting, probably even followed Rachel out to investigate the noise in case she needed backup, but his old mulish attitude was hard to kill.
"Harry Potter is a part of you, even now," he forced out. "You can try to lock him out, but he's in you. Not just a part of you, really, but he
Potter rights himself too quickly and Draco just glimpses his hand raised up triumphantly before he staggers into him and they both tumble to the ground. Potter's on top, which means it's Draco's back they're smelling.
The lights were gone and it was eerily quiet, which would've been infinitely worse if it weren't for the expansive starry sky overhead. He let himself cry, then, figuring no one could properly see him in the dark. Draco helped him up some stairs and knocked, and then he was in Sirius's arms, face pressed against his chest, nose full of his scent and hands clutching his kimono-style house robe.
Yesterday marked the 30th birthday of our beloved Boy-Who-Lived and Man-Who-Conquered, who disappeared 12 years ago, and shoppers at Diagon Alley were astonished to see our hero walk the streets again! Mr. Harry Potter was accompanied by two children, an unidentified man, long-time friends Auror Ronald Weasley-Granger and Unspeakable Hermione Granger-Weasley, as well as a small contingent of undercover Aurors who came forward as the crowd became more excited.
The front door clanged shut behind Beatrice and then the kitchen door opened. Arthur whirled around, holding yet another damning letter.
"Okay?" he asked, not entirely believing it. James nodded resolutely before climbing to his feet, more slowly this time.
"He motivates me, you know? Keeps me going strong. I do a good ten reps, then Ron walks in and suddenly I can do twelve!"
In a fit of something much stronger than rage, Harry crunches his glasses in his fist and beats the remains against the wall. Slapping his palm flat and crushing the specs again and again, he wears himself out and slings the pieces at Ben.
“The thing is though, I like jewelry. Repairs, commissions, sales - I’m very good at what I do. I’ve been hounding father for years to incorporate a jewelry section, it’s a natural extension to the other accessories we offer.”
Am the voice of wisdom between us. Then a started packin' up picnics after work. Happened upon my Charming boys in the park every afternoon, casual-like, wae baskets of proper food."
Sirius clenched his fists and settled himself on the floor, leaning against the open door to study him clinically. Harry joined him on the floor and slumped casually, openly, against the side of his bed. He rarely used it as intended - he was still kipping on the sitting room couch and enjoying the novel experience.
"You splinched yourself," Malfoy declared after a long pause. Ron blinked rapidly. Of all the things to take away from this story - "You Apparated under duress, probably without fully understanding what you were doing. Your throat hurt and you left a part of it behind. Your larynx."
"You're practically a potions master," Nott said snidely to Draco, still on the floor under his mother's hunched figure. "Three drops will do. Open up."
This was worse than slugs, standing here, bald, in the middle of the DMLE with no way home except to cross through the Atrium of the Ministry of Magic.
Seething, Draco stuffed the letter back in the envelope and stacked them all haphazardly again. He had no hope of disguising his nosiness, nor did he particularly want to. James had done plenty of reorganizing these past few weeks and had left these out for anyone to see.
Alec sighed melodramatically. "You underestimate yer own brother..." He pulled out a modified clock-radio with a super-large antenna and the bottom half of a walkie-talkie strapped to it. He plugged it in and cringed at the loud, piercing feedback, before adjusting the knobs. At first all he got was static, then some music and a French radio station. Once he remembered to disable the actual clock-radio side of the contraption, he got the walkie-talkie to feed into the larger speaker of the radio, and the voices from downstairs began to drift through.
"Munchkin!" he cried. "Munchkin's next, I'll get it ready..." He started rooting through the precarious stack of game boxes at his elbow while Dad passed out the cards.
Potter peers around the frosty lair as if in a trance. Then, to Draco's horror and awe, he drops to the ground, lying flat on his back. He thinks he hears him murmur,
.” He lends reverence to his voice, as if this is an auspicious position. “You’re sort of above all that, right? They can’t do anything to you...so long as you have a department to be manager of.”
A withered old crone stands in the doorway and he falters at the edge of the stoop. Her long nose is crooked, her willowy hair is snow white, and her skin has a distinct blue tinge to it. But, he reminds himself, he does not judge
He lifted his left hand, which was still holding the absurdly huge wrench, and only just remembered to drop it in his lap before bringing his closed fist to his lips and
Monty translated with a slightly sick expression: "You want us tae send our boys tae a school tha' tortures kids in detention?"
Then again, Weasley hadn’t told Draco about the breakup either, preferring to let him stick his foot in his mouth instead.
"Never thought I'd see the day," Florean said, keeping his voice low but probably not low enough to keep Draco out of it. "Does my heart
Draco was ill-prepared, to say the least. Draco was ambushed, to speak accurately. Ambushed by the Charming chaps, if he were feeling lyrical. Auror Weasley escorted them through the gates, up the gravel walkway, across the threshold and into the parlor before James sent him away with a pointed look.
, but he couldn't be sure. He leaned to the side, toward the dissipating smoke, trying to catch Malfoy's eye. The pointy git still wouldn't look at him. It was infuriating.
But Potter - ugh, Charming, whatever - was a parent, and empty-nest syndrome was a powerful force. Besides, Draco wouldn't mind learning all the juicy details of how the Golden Boy had ended up a teenage father. And that was almost certain to come up if they pursued this goal.
“The same small circle for six months now, don’t you think it’s time to spread your wings, so to speak?” His voice was light and chipper, fantastically bland, and Harry almost wished for silence again.
Potter clasps his hand—Draco could swear there's a puff of steam in the frigid air—and takes him away from it all. Perhaps it's just his saving-people thing, but Draco is grateful all the same.
“I’d like my earrings back, if you please,” Mrs. Flamel rasps, still recovering from her close call with the Lemonhead.
"It's only eight," his brother said defensively. "There's plenty of time for another game. S'long as it's no Mun- "
James grinned. He knew what to do. Planning and renovating was hard, sweaty work, but he loved to cook. He hobbled back to the cupboard, hardly able to breathe for the pain, and dug into Harry Potter's old trunk. He had barely touched the trunk; for as long as he insisted he was James and not Harry, it felt like an invasion of privacy. But there was one thing he would need for this project: his old astronomy book.
was different from the other parents of Muggleborn children. They always had loads of questions or theories to support their skepticism.
"Oi!" He glared at Draco. "You could've caught me!" In fact, Draco had moved out of his way to avoid catching him.
"I'm to retrieve him." Lucius Malfoy's hair was brushed and pulled back neatly in a ribbon at the base of his neck. He sipped regally from the goblet, looking every part the Malfoy legacy Draco was raised to emulate. Scorpius saw and promptly attempted to lift his glass with one hand, slopping some of the pumpkin juice onto his cuff.
Running steaming-hot tap water over the sealed package of a Strawberry Pop-Tart does wonders for improving the taste. Warm strawberry-adjacent flavored goo is far superior to bunker-temperature. This is as close as he gets to cooking, as the hob is trapped behind a locked door. In Fin's room. He's only been in that room once: his very first day down here, when he passed from the steep ladder-stairs to this prison cell.
Ron took a series of quick notes, cursing Tony for just standing there, pale and jittery, looking ready to keel over. Too far gone, the useless git.
. He's safe and loved - cherished for who he is. Harry. With his eyes closed, he can pretend it's the sort of love that doesn't leave him feeling ill, or used. The room keeps spinning, upsetting his balance even through his eyelids, but he keeps them shut. It's only pretend, but sometimes, down here, pretend morphs into something else.
He caught Ron's eye through the front windows of the shop and waved awkwardly. He was dressed in Muggle clothes but James saw the strap of a wand holster peeking out of his shirt sleeve. He was on duty. Apparently, now that the shop was slowly being discovered by more and more of the magical world, it was prudent to amp up security.
Alec nodded, gave him a hug that ended much too soon, and sat back down by the tree. James didn't see what he gave Monty.
"Oh please!" Draco scoffed. "You're not as tasty as unicorn blood!" Rachel squinted in confusion from her corner, unable to read James's smoke and only able to hear what Draco practically shouted.
He turned away from the bookcase to find a stack of Muggle stationary on the writing table. Envelopes torn open, each letter read and replaced, then stacked up where the table met the wall. Spotting the name in the return address, Draco couldn't resist opening a few at random.
“Even Azkaban has windows, Haz,” said Sirius. The pet name struck a chord in his chest, like a note from a phoenix song, but he refused to be swayed.
“Oh Merlin, Harry…” His view was obscured by a tall man with dark hair. The man fell to his knees in front of him, clutching his hands, wrists, and arms, as if he couldn’t quite believe he was solid, all while chanting his name over and over again. Harry felt a spike of unease in the pit of nothingness inside him; he pulled his arms back and scowled down at the man.
raining...or drizzling, at any rate. I reckon it'd be quite beautiful at sunrise, facing east as it does."
"No, that's me," Alec practically whispered, eyes darting to McGonagall uncomfortably. James frowned. Then why did Arty -
He swallowed against the inner voice that was screaming at him to shut up, to keep James Charming pure and separate from the Golden Git of Gryffindor.
"They were hurting her!" Arthur said hotly, tears springing to his eyes as he ran his fingers over the creature's bony head again and again. The cat was peach-colored, wrinkly, and glaring at him with icy blue eyes. James motioned for him to explain. "Not tellin' ye where she came from, am no takin' her back!" James lifted his head slightly and raised his brows delicately in a well-practiced look that said
Rachel had promptly vomited and nearly splinched herself as she tried to Apparate out of the anti-Apparation wards. Mrs. Malfoy assured them that the Manor had no such wards in place, so Rachel had Tony to thank for the Auror-level magic that nearly tore her apart in her panic.
It wasn't the ideal way to end what was already a not-ideal week. As Draco pondered what had led to this less-than-ideal dinner with Scorpius, Astoria, and Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy, his mother went on with her pillaging:
"Marge's retirin' from the boutique," Monty explained. "She's lookin' to sell and I've made her an offer."
"Jeepers, Da'..." Beside him, leaning against his own bed, Arthur mimicked James's pose and put a hand on his chest with his feet splayed out on the mattress. James huffed a laugh.
"We had our first fuck in the barn," Draco grunted, stamping his feet to bring feeling back into his toes. "I recall it being much warmer in there." He didn't actually want to go to the barn. It was filthy there. The hay would ruin his jumper beyond even magical repair.
Monty sighed in a long-suffering way that made Remus think he was trying to sound more put-upon than he actually was, before nodding. Remus went to let himself out the front door but only succeeded in crashing into it before remembering to turn the lock. With a parting wave at the little family that watched him -
“Oh - cancer!” Draco realized, recalling the month he’d studied strictly Muggle illnesses. “You thought I had Muggle cancer?”
"I wish I could take a photo," Ron began in an inspired, important voice. "And then send that photo back through time - round sixth year, I'd say. Before all the ugliness, you know? Maybe it was just sexual tension back then."
"Do - ...is it a competition?" she asked carefully. Harry's head snapped up and his eyes went a bit wild. "I mean - not to say that Monty wasn't out of line when he accused you, but...are you - you and Malfoy, are you…?"
And then Potter walks in, sometimes, and he lights the fire over the hearth and in his heart. He sits close while the fire warms the room. He speaks to fill the silence.
Draco leaned back in his chair, observing the stunned-looking man before him. Had he really thought it would be so difficult to step back into magic? Identity and memories were one thing, but waving a stick around and using second-year defense spells could hardly be considered an obstacle.
"You've certainly made all sorts of observations!" Malfoy said, sounding a bit more shrill now. James leaned forward, raising his brows in mock-interest. "The difference is, I bother to
"Yeah, cos he dinnae have a family. He said they were all about that stuff." Their mother Aarti had come from a conservative background. Dad said that the Patels had wanted their daughter to end up with a Hindu. They were nice enough though, he said, until she got pregnant with his sprog. Then they turned her out. And now '
reintroduction is best.” Harry and Sirius fell quiet as Remus pressed on. “We need to keep pushing the limits here so you’re not trading one prison for another.”
So they'd started interrogating their own - for who else could have gotten past the shop's wards to attack Harry? Who else could have broken into a guarded storage room and Vanished the blood samples that were collected from the crime scene twelve years ago? Who else could have planted and trained an eye witness that knew every detail of a confidential case? Tony was heading up most of the interviews between the Aurors and the rest of the Department, leaving Ron to tackle the Prophet-driven leads.
"I know Monty's not coming back!" Arthur continued. "He says he dinnae even want tae come back anymore, he's goin' away tae Paris next month cos he's given up waiting for
made a judgement based on skin—except Marietta Edgecomb, that bint hasn't washed her face since they Vanished the afterbirth."
They trudged upstairs as a unit after a quiet dinner and he sent the boys to their room, only for James to protest. He cut him off and sent them away. He didn't know what was going to be said tonight but he knew he didn't want them around to see it.
"So a started bakin' for three an' threatened tae turn his rail in tae child services if 'e kept pushin' off his share on them.
Draco chances a peek over his shoulder at the dozen or so centaurs in the distance. The centaurs seem to stare right back, but surely they've not been spotted… He lends a guiding hand to Potter as they slink under a thatch of branches, finally losing sight of the herd. When they come out the other side, Draco shudders in passing horror and Potter laughs at him. Draco bristles.
"Yet another example of unexplained phenomena," Draco said agreeably, as if he hadn't spent every early morning sneaking behind Harry's back to bribe the beasts with charred meat. It had all been a ploy, of course, to impress Harry later with his newfound courage and animal prowess.
"As a matter of fact, I do. An animagus form is the ultimate transfiguration," McGonagall explained. "I wouldn't think to hire a transfiguration professor without the ability."
Weeks of deliberating had left him in limbo about whether to tell the boys about his new relationship or wait and see what happened, just in case things went south. James finally made the decision to confess after he spent nearly a whole evening using sign language with Draco. That was the night when he realized that the man wasn't going anywhere: Draco was committed to this and they had to be upfront with the kids. James told Alec and Arthur two weeks ago, their first night home, when it was just the three of them. He told them about how they could call him Draco instead of Mr. Malfoy if they'd like to, because he'd be around a lot more. They hadn't seemed surprised, exactly. Perhaps just surprised the conversation hadn't come sooner, like Scorpius had been.
now and since when did Hermione want to be an auror anyway? None of them knew, none of them understood -
"In my fourth year, during the Triwizard Tournament..." Harry licked his lips. "Would you have had me running to some...some twenty-year-old for advice? Like, Percy?"
That last one got through. Just for a moment, it broke through that blank face and lit a fire in James's eyes. Just for a moment, Monty was sure that they would fight this out properly and James might be arsed to see someone else's side for once. But then he shut down, as he had yesterday. He snatched up his cane, leaving his wand behind, and retreated upstairs.
Draco felt something inside himself light up. He used his best quill, because his fingers deserved the best, and his third-best stationary, because Charming was a civilian chocolatiér and not a foreign dignitary.
Ron spun in his chair the moment he heard the kitchen door push open. After twelve years, his eyes felt
, James signed stiffly, not knowing what else to say to get him back. Arty jerked, his eyes widening in panic.
His father said no words, thankfully. But he stared intently at James, who was doing a rousing job of pretending not to be irked. Draco thought he wouldn't be so carefree the moment those steely grey eyes turned on the boys -
A jack russell terrier and an otter burst from their wands, chasing each other around the table to the delight and awe of Alec and Arty. James clutched Monty's arm tightly as he felt a surge of déjà vu. The ghost-like creatures darted about his kitchen, their gentle glow lighting up the faces of Ron and Hermione as they passed by, and he felt like he was experiencing something he had lived before.
"It never should'a happened in the first place!" the Scotsman grunted, his voice beginning to rise again. He shoved a finger at the photo, tapping it firmly. "Tha's a fifteen year old boy there, wh - ye cannae just - just
"Da'?" Alec asked hesitantly. Harry didn't open his eyes, he only pointed stiffly at the Thing, which was now sparking violently from the top of its head.
, he decided. He wouldn’t use Polyjuice to help his kids skive classes, but he could bring Monty. To smooth things over. Everyone loved Quidditch.
"Someone's out for Potter blood," Draco explained shortly, flapping his hands at Blaise as he picked up one of the only-tested-twice-thus-far vials. "Literally, as it turns out."
"So…. Malfoy?" Ron asked slyly not five minutes into dinner. There was a beat, and then he and Hermione were practically falling out of the booth.
with a madman. Two days wandering the British countryside until he made it back to Hogsmeade was, quite literally, like a walk in the park. "I am an adult and I don't need you lot telling me what I can and can't do!"
The top of the silo was flat, not curved like the proper one that was still in use by the Burrow. The uppermost part must have wasted away - there were still bits of it left on the rim, sticking up a few inches here and there - but the remaining surface wasn't nearly as warped by time and rainwater as he'd expected. Bit crumbly, but structurally sound.
He remembered red and blue lights flashing, blinding him, and a hoard of strangers in reflective vests surrounded him. He knew he curled up into himself and cried for Draco, knew he couldn't stop shaking no matter how hard he tried - it was cold, he realized now, much colder than when they'd left the office, and he shivered violently on the concrete under his bum and against his back. The warmth from their drinks had long since faded and he thought he might've retched at some point but couldn't say when, where, or how much.
He kept the sign flipped to Closed for the day. With several displays turned over in the fight, he had a lot of stock to replenish before he could open again. He sighed. Everything was different now. He felt like the world had tilted over and he couldn't quite knock it back into place. Monty was gone. His shop was half-empty. Every blink brought the image of that green light rushing at him again. Not just last night's green light, but a barrage of long-forgotten memories:
"Please, Harry," he whispered, eyes shining bright with actual tears. Ron cleared his throat and Harry saw him turn away, and suddenly his friend's embarrassment became his own. If he wasn't humiliated before, when he finally came strolling through the door of Blupin Frottage covered in mud to find he'd induced a manhunt, he certainly was now.
"If you're concerned about your hygiene, we'll have to cover that in our next session," Malfoy finally said, his tone clipped and cold.
"We're on excellent terms," he said. "We entered into the marriage with an understanding. I needed an heir. She wanted legal ties to our vaults. Even after the divorce, she has some claim to my family's wealth. It funds her private ventures, seeing as no one else would take her seriously enough to sponsor her."
"Promise!" Arthur agreed readily. James gave him a stern look and Arthur crossed his heart. "No one else, jus' you!" he insisted. "Do a get to choose it?"
After three miserable, brooding days and two vaguely probing letters from Draco, Harry decided to never speak of the night again, and if Draco couldn't handle that, then too bad. To be fair, Draco's letters struck a balance between concern and exasperation, and while there was no mention of Harry Potter, Harry couldn't bring himself to reply, to offer some sort of explanation for his meltdown in the tunnel, for fear of giving himself away.
"Wanna see?" Ron asked, already pulling out his wand. James barely had time to wonder if the wizarding world had any sort of etiquette rules - if Monty insisted he took off his favorite cap, then he thought maybe
But Monty had volunteered countless hours to keep the boys busy while James renovated the dilapidated kitchen, refurbished the second-hand furniture, and finished the floors. Together, they painted every room, installed heavy appliances in the kitchen, and planned and pulled off an opening day that brought in dozens of customers who would later become their regulars due to Monty's easy charisma.
He was at a loss as to what he could say. Who was supposed to apologize here? Who was the victim? He knew the man was out of control yesterday, he knew it wasn't right for Monty to treat anyone like that, much less his boyfriend. But he also knew there was an undercurrent of truth to what had been said. A strong undercurrent. The guilt was churning his stomach and yet he still didn't feel right about apologizing. Or about forgiving.
Malfoy’s eyes darted down to James’s hip, though from their positions it looked more like he was eyeing his groin. He shifted, nodding, then continued:
"Yer foolin' round, aren't ye?! No one jus' - no one invites their therapist to a game, James! A woke up at midnight an' ye were gone. You've been up all fuckin' night workin' on a little
Harry's hair continued to drip in the middle of the sitting room while Remus stirred a potion in the kitchen and Sirius puttered around upstairs, thinking Harry was a deviant.
, he had signed, that challenging spark in his eye that told Monty he was ready to fight again. Because of course he was, when
Time slowed down as everything lined up just right. He didn't remember planning it but perhaps something in his mind had been waiting for this moment. He welcomed the images that flickered across his mind now:
Draco didn’t want to be there, but he didn’t have much of a choice after confessing to Blaise that something awful had happened last night. Something that resulted in him waking up, half dead, with bits of chocolate crushed and smeared in the folds of his rumpled robes. Shouting, there’d been some shouting, he relayed Blaise at lunch as he nibbled on a bit of dry toast. A hangover potion could only do so much for a thirty-year-old who’d consumed a shallow pond of liquor. That was why he only had dry toast for lunch, and why he’d been overpowered by Blaise’s outrageous demands for apologies, and why he now found himself escorted by Blaise and Weasley to the front door of Charming Chocolates.
Harry doesn't know why Ben is Ben or why he has to fight Ben, but every time he shows his stupid face, Harry has to pick a fight. And Ben always fudging wins in one way or another.
With the oven sealed, the fire burning inside him turns to smoldering embers. Draco looks between Potter and the door in horror. His face is clouded over with something powerful and righteous and chilling. The screams are turning hoarse. There's frantic movement within the chamber. Draco dares to look through the little slat and sees the old crone dithering about madly. She picks up the wire table with the desserts, attempts to wield it at the door, only to screech in pain and drop it with a loud clanging.
Draco froze. Scorpius crammed the last of his cone into his mouth and answered with ice cream dripping down his chin.
Dad blinked before he caught the pile of stationary they'd been rifling through and his face went dark.
"Did you swipe the rug from Slytherin, or something?" he joked, peering over at Draco, who pursed his lips and didn't answer. Harry threw his head back and roared with laughter, his belly aching with the force of it.
He positioned his wand to hover a little farther away from his eyes this time and studied the book for another phrase. Slowly, with clumsy, awkward movements, he signed through the phrase. Next to his head, his floating wand twitched in the air, using gold smoke to spell out the words in English:
It felt like his fingers were finding their home. He thought he might be bothered to learn a few more signs now that he had his own name to start -
When he woke on Christmas morning, the sunrise nearly within his reach, he found one guest had already arrived. She was perched on the window overhead, ruffling her aged but familiar feathers, pecking the glass and tilting her head.
to the board. "Splendid idea! Bells, let's get in touch with Corporate, see if we can't bring in a few specialists to teach our kitchen staff some new recipes."
Potter was arrogant, always thinking he knew better than everyone, suspecting Draco and Severus and all the Slytherins were up to something. Granted, they were up to some things at the time, but giving them the benefit of the doubt could've saved a lot of fuss. All Draco was up to at the time was protecting his family. Potter would have done the same in his situation, but instead he got to play the hero and Draco got to stand trial.
"They've known him since they were - what, four?" He nodded. "Theoretically, if they weren't in the picture...would you ever take him back?"
"Your father was an animagus, you know," Lupin said a little too casually from across the table. James raised his brows, trying to appear less interested than he was.
That night was the first time he slept over at the Charming home. They drank the most heinously delicious cocoa and made a blanket fort in the sitting room. Alec introduced them to a television program called Doctor Who. Scorpius was wary at first, but Alec told him how all the special effects were done and the seven-year-old went on to sing praises for Muggles in between recurring bouts of slight terror.
Rain was pouring down and Harry was without an umbrella, but he was positively giddy as his clothes went soggy. He stamped in one puddle, then another, then nearly drowned in a deceptive lake on the corner. He laughed in the face of a peeved looking woman who gave him and his antics a wide berth. M & P Realty was just two blocks down from the Leaky and in that short distance, Harry managed to thoroughly soak himself in the rain.
The boys cried out behind James as Draco screamed in agony and Narcissa grabbed another teacup from the table. It hit its mark and Tony hissed, clutching his eye. Released, Draco rolled onto his back, gasping for breath, and James hesitated. He couldn't go to him without leaving the boys vulnerable but Draco didn't have a chance from the floor.
James nodded. They said nothing. Draco wasn’t sure if they had ever gone so long in each other's presence without speaking.
Potter's status yields just two Ministry-grunts to check out the forest, and the pair finds nothing to corroborate their story. No gingerbread house. No cannibalistic crone. No leather and ivory furniture, no lamps pocked with nipples, no giant cauldron. No oven. No metal spring mattress.
the ingredients, the magic. Just as one must know the soil in which the herbs grow. To cook and eat magic is to—why, it's to renew life when it would otherwise expire! To heal, not to drive mad.” Her voice doesn’t sound so weak anymore. Draco thinks it’s beautiful how the old crone seems to come alive when she speaks of her passion. Her art. “My mother taught me the delicate balance between…”
The boys were chattering excitedly, oblivious to the danger that could be following them even now, even on the train. Just because they weren't out in the open didn't mean they were safe. Being trapped inside could lead to disaster! He bolted over to the window as the boys settled into the cushioned benches on either side. The window slid open from the bottom and he judged both its size and distance from the floor. His boys were small, but he reckoned they could reach the opening and fit through it if something happened.
do this. Arty stopped screaming long enough to take a breath and start screaming again, looking a little less terrified and a little more excited. If Arty was doing it without passing out or falling off, Alec could too!
"If there's nothing else you'd like to work on, I feel it is best we call these sessions to a close."
Front door secured and potential customers sufficiently let down, he limped back to the counter, his hip twinging. He could make it short distances just fine without his cane and today hadn't been particularly hard on him. No long treks through the city, like yesterday. Just an average day in his little shop.
It was past ten in the evening now. Scorpius would be asleep. His mother would be pacing the east wing corridors anxiously, despite the reassurances he sent via owl. His father would be...well, there was no telling what state Lucius would be in from hour to hour. Hopefully asleep. All Draco wanted was a glass of fine Elvish vintage and maybe for Pansy to come off her extravagant honeymoon early and tell him he could pull off the bald look comparatively well.
"No," then, opting for honesty, "well, yes, but I'm not running away. I just want to look at some houses." He was an adult, this was not a prison, he was allowed to do as he pleased.
"Okay, bye!" he blurted unceremoniously, turning heel and darting away. He heard the Muggles' laughter as he hurried outside. The lack of privacy in that kitchen should've filled him with a familiar rage, but he was far too full of new, fresh feelings to care.
“Who let a pair of Hawaiian shirts within a mile of Men's?” Blaise Z. snaps. Ginny peeks over her shoulder at him, smothering a grin.
Scraping sounds came through the radio as chairs were presumably pushed back from the table. The voices were fading away, overly polite goodbyes and stiff words leading their magical guests to the front door, far away from the walkie-talkie hidden within a hollowed-out book on the table. Alec dropped his arms and jumped down from the bed, depositing the radio on his large desk. Arthur climbed up to perch on his own desk - which was an old door mounted on two saw-horses. Too late he remembered the small puddle of paint he had left on its surface…
"He's not been away from 'em ever," Gibbs insisted, sniffling horribly. Charming looked over at him with a weary (annoyed?) expression. "S'always been them three together. Ye have no idea what he's been through for those boys, ye jus' have no - "
An hour later, Hermione joined him in the sitting room and accepted a cup of tea from Monty, who sat next to James. He felt a mug of tea pressed into his own hands and he simply set it on the coffee table in front of him. Monty wrapped an arm around his shoulders.
' was what he meant, surely. Signing was often short and blunt. James just phrased it poorly. Another reason why this translation spell would be a disaster for James, his lovebird just didn't understand -
“Gay,” Cormac calls out, leaning forward to send a not-so-subtle look at Draco, who carefully ignores him.
smile at the same time, the picture of calm, cool, and collected, while scanning the wide selection of hard liquors on the back shelves. Was this why people went out drinking? To watch their...well, their realtors look all sharp and focused and slightly bored but in a suave way, like he had had a thousand nights more interesting than this -
There was only one thing for it and that was to destroy the fort. He made the mistake of sleeping next to a very attractive man and of course he woke up with
James said without hesitation. Things were clicking into place for him. The sofa battle was surprisingly infuriating and now he knew why...it was just the latest in an endless pattern.
"And you chose the lion's den?" Only someone who takes a casual stroll through the Forbidden Forest would volunteer for McGonagall's house.
"I don't know what you expected of this, Weasley," the Healer snapped. "Your own wife can tell you this is a process, and an imperfect one at that."
"He was never one for publicity," Blaise noted as he studied the Daily Prophet stretched out in front of his face. A small protest about werewolf rights had transformed into front page news thanks to Saint Potter's Gryffindor theatrics. Granger had clearly put Charming up to this stunt; this and the op-ed almost two weeks ago seemed like her brazen handiwork. "Unlike you."
"Stow it, Malfoy," she said. He stowed his words, but he could brood as much as he liked. "Cut it off now, one way or the other. It's usually possible to mend a potion before it combusts."
"Just doesn't seem very professional, to insult your employee publicly in a meeting - and Harry works hard!"
Things were going well nowadays. Running smoothly. There were no fires to put out, Malfoy had even called it quits and declared that James was fighting fit. But without a battle to fight, James was restless and stressed.
McGonagall said nothing and when Remus looked over, he saw her swallowing thickly as she looked at Harry - no, at James Charming. Her withered old hands were trembling. He cleared his throat, not knowing what he would say but forcing the words out anyway.
James knew that he must have inherited some of Harry Potter's legendary courage, given that he resisted falling to the ground in hysterics. He didn't want ice cream. He wanted his boys back at home, safe and sound, stealing cats and building robots.
"Like jeering at a first year for being sorted Slytherin?" he shot back. Potter has the grace to flinch at the Weasley twins' less-than-heroic actions.
"Not his Mind Healer, pal," she reminded him, tucking the blossom of a wildflower in his hair before tossing the stem in his face. He grinned sheepishly and patted the flower to secure it.
"Er, so that's a yes, right?" Harry asked, then promptly gagged. He retched slightly and spat out a lump of muck. A brown trail of spittle hung from his chin. Disgusting. His fiancé was disgusting.
He was halfway through writing a quick note to invite Hermione out for lunch tomorrow when the letter arrived via eagle owl.
Everyone had gone back to their respective homes and Harry was riding high on the fact that he was, in fact, home already. Only Draco remained, crammed into the hammock with him, and they swung gently, gazing at each and every dreamy view around them.
"Are you as interesting as your name?" Malfoy quipped with an easy smile, eyes shifting somewhere over Harry's shoulder at his small but bustling crowd of prospective homebuyers before returning to him.
"We scheduled some private sessions with an Apparation instructor so this won't happen again," Hermione said as if that solved it all.
"I'd have gotten here faster if someone knew how to string together a proper riddle," Draco grumbled, picking a stray twig out of his jumper. His
Tea was fine, if a bit formal. He couldn't talk to James the way he wanted to, though he doubted James wanted to rehash any of the words they'd exchanged via owl over the past few weeks. What was said and done was already said and done. Let it rot in the ground while they said newer, better things, like how much Arthur liked the portraits at the Manor, or Alexander's prattling about Charms Club. Like how James thanked Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy for their unwitting donation to the collection of protective relics in the Charming residence, and then in the very next moment:
He brought the cat back to the wardrobe where an open can of wet cat food was waiting. Arthur watched her proudly as James considered what came next. Obviously he couldn't just turn the cat out of doors, but an animal shelter wasn't out of the question. Then again, watching Arthur watch the cat, James knew he couldn't just throw away four weeks of love and care and bonding…
"Maybe next time, eh?" the man said. Harry couldn't help but grin as he pocketed his money. The exchange was over, Draco was no doubt curious but Harry Potter had stayed out of it, and the only handout he'd ever liked was Florean's ice cream sundaes.
Cheeky blighter. He stretched the navy blue velvet cap over his head, reveling in the silk lining that would keep his hair smooth. It was ridiculous - luxurious and tacky at the same time. "How do I look?" he laughed, striking a little pose. Mum should've laughed - it would have made him feel less stupid - but instead she smiled knowingly. Ugh. Mums.
something with it. Potter rewards him with a very manly whimper and tugs Draco's hair. Draco moans, his throat still pressing down against that hot, hard cock, just on the verge of choking himself.
“I’m sorry?” Arthur blinks rapidly. Bellatrix has not yet uncapped the whiteboard marker. She doesn’t look very impressed with how the meeting is proceeding.
Of course, James was probably just worried the boys would figure out that something was wrong. And as much as Monty knew Alec and Arthur would have his back and might be able to talk some sense into their stubborn dad, he would never try to turn them against James. That wasn't playing fair, for James or the kiddos.
"Not Starr's! They use only the highest quality ingredients. I'm happy to run along to Nott's apothecary for you, seeing as you can't be seen in public without the Golden Boy to outshine your head."
"But..." Draco scrunched up his nose in a way that would've been endearing if Harry wasn't too busy bracing himself against the table to avoid being...hexed, or grabbed, or screamed at or something. "But I already knew all that."
"What's wrong with you?" Remus murmured. Harry's head whipped back to him and Monty looked as if he'd been slapped.
“That’s the problem, see…” Mr. Flamel sends a bashful look at his wife, who is still battling the lemon candy. “I seem to have mistakenly tagged something I shouldn’t have. So your crew collected something we’d quite like back.”
Draco sipped his imaginary tea and graciously complimented their host. Draco didn't even mind negotiating his long form to fit into the miniature chair at the miniature table, because Scorpius was a paradigm of manners.
The word flashed in his mind with singular clarity as James jabbed the wand forward, sending the closest dark figure flying into the back wall of the compartment and a second wand hurtling through the air. James caught it and turned the first wand on the last remaining target
The lamp flickered again and then stayed on, steady, revealing the full devastation of their room. The water was beginning to recede, escaping through the cracks in the door and floorboards. Fuck. This was going to cost a
And then Helen's attempt to murder him had put James in hospital for half a day. He was released, ordered to pour his old potions down the sink and wait for new ones. After just twenty-four hours on his old Muggle pills, James realized two things:
"I could lend some assistance," he continued, creeping to the edge of the pallet. James cocked his head in mock-curiosity, and couldn't help but notice that Draco was keeping his share of the blankets firmly in place over his lap.
"Racists spout the same dragonshit, it's all bollocks! Hagrid's not any more dangerous than I am, but all that people like you ever see is a dangerous half-breed or a brown man that's up to no good—just because we look a certain way!"
The old Harry Potter would've put the overbearing man in a Body Bind and left him in the pantry by now.
Draco frowned at him rather dramatically, as if he'd started speaking Parseltongue, and then peeked over the edge of the table. Snatching up a couple of rags, he put them on the ground to rest his knees against. Harry couldn't imagine how woodstain-soaked rags could be better for his trousers than a dusty floor, but he wasn't about to correct him. Draco settled more comfortably on the ground just off of Harry's ledge, then met his eyes in a way that seemed utterly without pretence, but was still a mystery to him.
"Are you two quite finished?" Rachel called over, twirling her wand across nimble fingers. James watched the trick for a moment, feeling dizzy. Maybe he'd had too much fine Elvish vintage because he could've sworn she muttered, "Owe Zabini ten Galleons..."
Remus was just tucking into a new box of Charming Chocolates at the Head Table during breakfast when Hagrid tossed him the Daily Prophet. The front page was a clear threat to this beautiful morning - a headline screamed about yet another death linked to an illegal potion called Prism. He scanned the rest of the paper idly as he sucked on a truffle, wondering what it was that had Hagrid beaming at him. He found it on page 9 in the form of an extensive op-ed that took up the top half-fold:
“What a fantastic addition, Mr. Malfoy!” Arthur nods, looking a little strained. “What are some other examples of diversity?”
"This…" he gasps out, struggling to breathe with Potter's weight crushing him. "…this is not how I'd hoped you'd end up on top of me. But it'll do."
"I always thought she'd go into something more brainy," Ron offered lightly. "Maybe an Unspeakable, with the way she's always going on about what-have-you… And we were both frustrated to hell with how the search was handled, but I didn't want to be any part of the aurors after I saw how bloody incompetent they were. Hermione, now..."
“The Weasleys are great. Sort of took me in after I met Ron at school. Didn’t have to spend summers with the Durs - er, with my relatives. Are you - you’re a documentary company, right?”
, that’s nice. Draco whines, then inhales sharply. He can barely feel the heat of the oven—the room—as he concentrates on building a rhythm. Potter’s panting and groaning is animalistic, filthy, degrading, and the sexiest thing Draco’s ever heard.
James exhaled heavily, his worst fears beginning to take form. Monty really had no idea how difficult this would be.
"Welcome tae Charming Chocolates!" a friendly Scottish man called out from the left, somewhere near the front counter. "We close in five, so get to it!" Remus nodded vaguely in the direction of the voice and shuffled through the crowd, heading for a more deserted back corner.
James himself was the test subject of a Weasley Wizarding Wheezes beta-product. He had choked down a grainy white "chocolate" and then watched his brown skin fade to pale pink. His hair was still his own though, and his scar remained, so Ron had fished out this priceless artifact from the depths of the Auror department and now James was sporting a warm knit cap in September to fool the entire wizarding world.
Charming nodded shortly to confirm, picking at the paint on his cane. Draco plowed ahead while commending himself for treating the
Potter’s saying something now. One hand has moved from his shoulder. Draco peeks around. He’s reaching out from the little island of clothes, stretching unsteadily across the bricks toward his own trousers that he left on the floor. He just barely manages to snag a leg of fabric without toppling over and Draco automatically reaches out to steady him.
"Brick oven," he insists. "Like a giant brick oven. Iron door, iron furnishings—what sort of guest room doesn't have a doorknob?"
Bursting into the room, he found his son clutching an alien to his chest, staring up at him in triumph.
"Why not?" She hated this. Was she helping the situation or making everything worse? She desperately wanted them to work it out. If anyone deserved a family, it was Harry - well, James.
“Elegant choice,” Draco declared, dry as sand, and Harry’s heart dropped. It was lively enough; the billiards table hosted a group of women around their age, and there were more full booths than empty ones. Harry darted a glance at the bar before dragging Draco over. “You’re - “
These were the images that plagued him at night and haunted him the next day. Last night, he saw his sons wearing those uniforms. Dead. He wanted to scream.
Draco was only half paying attention during their customary afternoon tea break. Blaise had come over to St. Mungo's from the Department of Mysteries, as usual, and invited himself into Draco's office, as usual, and proceeded to help himself to the Central America-inspired chocolates, which was
Hermione touched a hand to Gibbs’s elbow and he took the hint, though his face turned an ugly puce color. Draco wondered how much this rude oaf had in common with Ron Weasley and what that said about the Golden Trio’s true dynamics…
"And I tend to - well, I have an emotional investment in my work, no matter the case, and I won't apologize for that!" she said fiercely, criminally harsh against the backdrop of fluffy pinks, golds, and blues. "But it
"Record number of Muggleborn students this year," McGonagall chimed in somberly. "Because of what that boy did for us. He and his friends built a
“Which leg?” He was out of his element here. He’d never dealt with children before...he estimated this one at about, what, seven years old? Nine? Maybe six? He was sobbing into the grass, tears and dirt all over his bright pink face.
"I've worked out a whole business model fer us," Monty said delicately but obviously still brimming with excitement.
“Has it got windows?” he asked, and though he couldn’t see it on their blurry faces, he could hear the pity in the answer:
"Mr. Lupin comes from a school," Monty explained, still staring oddly at Remus. "Wants tae talk t'ye both."
“Oi, you!” Potter cries out suddenly, looking over Draco’s shoulder. Draco swings around. The old crone is peering at them through a little tinted window-slat mounted in the iron door. “Open the door!” That slight tremor from before returns to Potter’s voice.
He crawled stiffly to the bedroom door in lieu of standing. He would stand after he took his potion.
Abbott was a genius and Draco was already making plans to send his tainted Charming Chocolates supply to her in thanks. Because he obviously wouldn't be partaking of those anymore. They were tainted by Potter's influence. There was a conflict of interest, or something. Healer-patient-sweet confidentiality. He didn't even like them that much anyway.
, James said shortly. Now he had to be the bad guy, shooting down what his kids saw as an exciting venture.
to do it. James needed it. James needed him, despite what he claimed, and now Monty was being chucked out of these appointments.
"Put the warrants out," he said, minding his tone this time. With another flick of her wand, Rachel sent six scrolls racing out of the conference room.
He threw the covers off and made his way to the loo to shower, leaving his godfather to clean up the tea in merciless silence.
to see his warm and loving Monty morph into...that. James had whipped out his wand and then couldn't even think of a spell to use; the sight of Monty advancing on him was so incongruous with his memories of magic that he just froze up. And
Last night, under Scorpius's watchful eye, he had sent a hasty thank you note (on his fourth-best stationary) for the new Central America Variety Box that had arrived around dinnertime. This morning, Draco thought that maybe he should have had this morning's brilliant idea last night, to save on stationary, decorum, words, and yes, a bit of pride. It was not prideful to write a second letter in the span of twelve hours for the sole purpose of inviting oneself over for boozy chocos.
"Like now." Draco nods. "And that's why you're so scrawny, I suppose? You've made a habit of skiving class and getting spectacularly lost?"
"I just don't know what I'd do with all this space..." for the massive place that Scorpius seemed rather taken with.
James nodded agreeably and Draco rallied himself to finally steer the conversation to more pressing matters.
Malfoy blinked at him - at the smoke, rather. James made a small circle with his fingers and brought it to his chest, indicating the badges that a young Draco Malfoy had made during the Triwizard Tournament.
Abbott nodded to James. "Of course it's entirely up to you, Mr. Charming. I can understand if you're unsure, given what's happened, but I will fill your supply myself if it will ease your mind."
"I'm afraid this is the end of my morning availability," he said. Harry cocked his head and then un-cocked it before Draco could catch him looking like a confused puppy. "Come back to the office same time tomorrow, I'll have another option for you to look at. Perhaps one with an
"A month ago, Charming," he said simply, as if James was slow, which he was. "Just before the Quidditch match.
Monty was whinging about James needing a project but refusing to take his advice, as usual, and could Ron use his magic law powers to please make Malfoy disappear.
Charming grimaced, apparently not looking forward to the Auror report submitted by Weasley on September 1st. It was the type of incident report that was full of information but said nothing at all. A lot of names (four Aurors, five civilians), a lot of re-iteration of those names in a vague and unbiased description of the event (Charming snatched a wand that Auror Idiot had pointed at him and then he apparently used that wand to send Auror Moron into a wall), a lot of stamps and signatures at the bottom that signified Auror Weasel had done a fine job of tattling on his old friend.
Harry was left to entertain Scorpius in the lobby while Draco rummaged about his office. At least, Harry thought he was meant to wait. Was their day finished…? Would Draco come back out and be surprised to find him still here? He shifted from foot to foot, only half-listening to Scorpius tell him all about Terry's time on the Slytherin Quidditch team -
"Go on then, what did ye say?!" Monty repeated, jaw tight, hands clenched on the tabletop. Harry pursed his lips and screwed his eyes shut in annoyance, whether at Monty's shouting, the robot's loud and smelly destruction, or Remus's manners, he couldn't begin to guess.
He wanted a better family dinner, he knew that much. One in which he wasn't scolded like an incontinent mutt in front of his own son. Unbidden, images of James's kitchen came to mind. The countless Saturday nights he'd spent there, either with superfluous company or with James all too himself. Hours of bickering and banter, James's silent laughs, his own breathless giggles, and their innocent, all-too-fleeting touches.
“That’s what potions are for,” Draco protests, not really hearing himself. It’s difficult to focus on the leather's strange mark. Potter sways a little on the floor.
"Am gettin' one like that!" Arthur said, pointing repeatedly at the dragon. James snapped his fingers and Arthur looked up at him wildly.
Malfoy nodded slowly, seeming to arrive at some sort of decision. Harry hoped it was that any business was welcome business, even if it came from a crazy person. Which he was
Thanks for reading, I hope you've enjoyed my first Drarry.  (Actually my first romantic story, period!) (Can you even call this a Drarry if Draco refuses to call him Harry?) (I like Drames but it implies cross-gen.) (Drarming?) (Someone please teach me to end my sentences earlier so we avoid stupid shit like Drarming and penis mold.)
"Oh." Harry licked his lips. "No." Sawdust coated his glasses, a heavy monkey wrench he didn't remember ever seeing before was clutched in his left hand while his right braced his weight against the nearest leg of the table.
"Our nanny's in a snit cos it's near two in the mornin' now an' he's never late. She kept callin' the bakery - she weren't very bright, he cannae answer the phone! So she calls the police and they call the bakery too - they weren't very bright neither - an' tell her tae wait til mornin' before she files a missing person report. Then they get a noise complaint from the old todger who lived behind the bakery. Said someone was blastin' shite music - "
"He could transform into a stag, actually," Lupin smiled. "Harry's patronus charm took the form of his father's animagus." James furrowed his brow and Lupin caught the unasked question. "A patronus is a sort of guardian-charm, made from happy memories to fend off dark creatures, or to send urgent messages."
James felt something inside break. He wanted to be better at this, he wanted Monty to come out of the kitchen and help him, he wanted that old woman to stop mean-mugging him through the window while she told anyone who would listen on the sidewalk about the surly foreign man inside who wouldn't deign to speak to her.
The boys admired their gifts a little longer (James was entirely too smug about winning them over with a few
The git catches himself mid-bow and suddenly looks like he'd gladly walk back into the oven. Draco lets him stew in his mortification and climbs into the rusted contraption first. He's not shocked enough when Potter doesn't climb into the driver's seat;
"Nothing," Blaise shrugged innocently. His eyes darted to the side, to the spot on the rug where the new variety box had perished that day. "So he's sending you complimentary chocolates now?"
"Wide-eyed and innocent, I agree," Malfoy continued loudly. "Unarmed and crippled, an obvious threat that should have been met with three wand-points, all perfectly reasonable, yes."
pathetically against the iron and fall to the floor. Potter draws his knees up to his chest and hides his face, folding his arms over his head.
"We dunno where they got her but they'd painted her up an' she was all dizzy from the fumes - " Arthur's voice shook and his lip trembled as he clutched the cat to his chest. James felt his own eyes prickle at the pitiful sight and
Didn't even realize, just said something about how he's soft and warm and sweet on the inside but hard on the outside - "
Weasley guffawed and Draco felt his cheeks turn pink. "Yes. Yes, you are quite right," he bit out, refusing to turn back around to face the Auror. He cursed his and Astoria's goal to instill such manners in the Malfoy heir
" Arthur grumbled as he read the details of the Curse. He threw out his Wizard's protective gear, all but the Plus 1 Hat, and recounted his strength.
"Harry - James," Ron corrected himself. "I know you're scared." James looked away from those pitying eyes, choosing instead to glare at the cat in Arty's pet-carrier on the overhead shelf. It met his gaze challengingly and he found himself trying not to blink. "But I
"Sometimes you gotta call it," Ron went on. Hermione wasn't sure she agreed but she knew she hated herself for promising Arthur that they would sort it out. James's back raised and lowered under her hand as he took deep, purposeful breaths.
Alec thought it was hilarious when people called Dad by that name, it was so weird! Almost weirder than being accepted into magic school, in a way. Of all the crazy names and personas that he and Arty had invented over the years for their dad’s mysterious past life, Harry the Wizard-Hero was just hysterically funny.
"Was? Oh... Is she gone?" Scorpius said, coming closer. Harry took a deep breath and tried to answer, but his voice caught in his throat. Stupid sawdust. He nodded and took little Scorpius by his mittens, squeezing encouragingly.
"Oh." Arthur suddenly felt very stupid, stupider than Alec looked in his Goggles. Bloody hell, his grandparents hadn't died. They had disowned Aarti and left James to fend for the newborn twins alone. "Shit."
The game was painfully boring and did indeed take forever. The ABBA CD had to be switched out for various other ABBA albums - Dad had a never ending supply - but eventually it came to a merciful close by ten o'clock. Alec demolished them, of course.
. Countless dreams and memories of playing chess in the room with the red furniture; doing homework with a quill in a library; hurrying through corridors while pressed together, hidden under some sort of liquid-fabric; huddled together in a tent that was bigger on the inside…
Looking back later, James could narrow it down to several triggers: the fourth near-sleepless night in a row while he listened to Monty's sniffles and snores from the other room; mindlessly mucking up what must have been a dozen orders that day as he alone worked the counter and tried to keep up with the pre-Christmas crowd; finally, losing his notepad at some point and being unable to adequately mime to the crotchety old woman that he was mute, not rude.
He shot up at once to catch an armful of Alec, who immediately broke down in quiet, shaking sobs against his chest.
No one in the group provided any answers as to Mr. Potter's whereabouts for the last decade. He appeared to be on a shopping excursion for Hogwarts school supplies for the two children, identical twin boys who bear a striking resemblance to Mr. Potter himself. (See photo below.) Mr. Potter wore Muggle clothes and a hat that covered most of his trademark scar, and he was recognized first by Flourean Fortescu of Flourean Fortescu's Ice Cream Parlour. His hat was lost in the subsequent commotion, revealing his scar and confirming his identity.
It took some stacking and finagling, but they eventually worked it out. The big blue sheet was draped over the floor pallet, held up by Arthur's wardrobe on one side of the room and Alec's stool mounted on his desk on the other side. The sides were tucked into their bed-frames. Alec brought in a string of Christmas lights stolen from the tree - Dad didn't even seem to notice that one - and Arthur arranged the bedding. It wasn't their best work, but it was certainly better than Dad sleeping alone in his room without Monty.
How did he even have a foot left to burn? What had gone wrong with the blasting spell? Why was fire so
Out of the kindness of his very full heart, Harry decided not to point out that just because their visit was for inspiration, didn't preclude the possibility that they'd left the castle with more than that.
Ron stayed alert, James noted, as he spoke softly to both boys and guided them through the crowd. He looked like a proper secret agent.
"I don't..." Harry tried in vain to knock the cobwebs out of his disjointed memories of that night, but nothing clear-cut came to mind that he hadn't already remembered and replayed in his head a thousand times. What spilled out of his mouth now was brand-new, for all he knew. "I don't want our history to muck up everything we've...got now," he finished lamely.
, a lifetime of it that others couldn't even begin to grasp - but Sirius looked at him in such a pleading way that he fell silent. Begrudgingly, he listened.
inviting him over for an impromptu boozy chocos night. But Harry and Malfoy wrote each other constantly, so how was Ron to know that he hadn't yet told the ferret about Monty?
"The—the one we saw before?" It feels…forbidden, to talk about the slaughtered unicorn he glimpsed on his trek through the forest with Potter all those years ago. In the presence of two living unicorns, no less. It feels as taboo as drinking the blood.
, James had signed at the start of their session, dropping lazily into his chair. Malfoy read the gold smoke from James's wand and his eyes narrowed, but he said nothing. So James tried again.
Theodore Nott was in Slytherin with Draco. The same year, in fact. James knew him by his brown hair, his small round face, his weak but not unattractive chin. His vintage clothes were altered haphazardly but he wore nice boots, polished and well-made. But James didn't remember that last detail from school, no. He had only noticed those boots while lying on the floor, surrounded by eight or nine other pairs of shoes...
That was as close to an apology as Draco would get after Charming had failed to ask after his hair, the heartless tart. Though he knew he'd treated Charming rather coldly as of late, he still thought it might have been at least half-deserved after the barrage of Potter-y behavior to which Draco had been subjected.
“Take a chair, any chair,” Mr. Arthur Weasley says by way of greeting to the incoming lot. Beside him, his fellow HR rep Mrs. Bellatrix Lestrange settles for the curled-lip look. They stand on either side of the whiteboard, where
"Dunno," Monty said. "Only a last name on the forms. Not been the same any two months. Got the first lot direct from St. Mungo's in September, October was signed Montague, November was Nott, an' this latest one said Vane."
Harry threw himself forward and back, forward and back, waiting longer and longer each time before he caught himself on the back-swing. Finally, he answered,
"Er...hello," he offered with a little wave. "Looking for his, erm...person." He gestured in Scorpius's direction, though he was long gone. Should he go after him? He had just let an unsupervised child loose in a posh home, and until they found his...person, Harry would have to mind him, right? "Scorpius?!" he called, shoving through a couple blocking the hall.
be friends, if James tried harder. Inviting someone to Quidditch wasn't enough, of course. Between his and Monty's long-term relationship and Harry Potter's old crowd, James Charming had clearly forgotten how to treat a friend.
“Your point, Ms. Patil?” Bellatrix says in a dangerous voice. She’s holding the capped marker before her like a whip, ready to crack.
, Monty insisted. James heard the door open and close, saw a young woman in a suit nod a greeting in their direction before browsing the selection.
An hour later he returned with McGonagall, windswept and breathless. She had listened with rapt attention to his frantic story before she tore into a drawer of personal belongings, retrieved an old photograph, and dragged Remus back out of Hogwarts. Sometimes she hardly seemed to need a cane, but it was at her side anyway, clunking away with every hurried step.
Grinning like a loon, James opened a blank text to no one and proceeded to teach Draco Malfoy, the current heir to the Malfoy-Black fortunes, how to text.
"Oh! Just the one room. Bedroom, I mean. And the bathroom, I'll definitely need one of those. A separate bathroom, not one that's, like, behind a screen or something." Harry pursed his lips and tried to recall any other loo that didn't come with an actual door. By the look on Malfoy's face, a screened-off toilet was not the norm. "I like, er, not the city. I mean, I do like the city, but not to live in, I don't think. I like it looking..." he gestured to the window and its beautiful rolling hills, "open, I guess. I just don't want to look at the side of a shopping center, you know?"
"You let the mystery of my attack rest," he pointed out. No one actually seemed to care that he was ambushed in his own office. No Cruciatus, no matter. Abbott, their supervisors, the hospital board, the Aurors - no one really seemed to mind what he had gone through after he gave his statement and his memorial evidence. Weasel upped the security around Charming's shop and said they would
"Stay low…" he murmurs, trying not to move his lips. He's not sure how much she can hear through the door, through the ventilation holes. "Keep working."
"I try to help everyone here, which is an awfully big job, of course. Harry's the same, but he's happy to visit his family in all the other departments. If you spot a redhead, they belong to Harry."
He managed to snap his mouth shut before the gods could mercifully snuff him out. He turned, dropping the wrench out of his lap with a loud
"All our...shite back in school, and fourth year especially, and my dad..." Draco was looking ten times more uncomfortable than Harry, which he didn't think possible. "Y-you
At least, that's what she hoped. She would dearly love to view that memory in a pensieve because if Monty had actually intended to do something to James, she would simply have to set him on fire.
James had always known that Monty was a nurturer and, yes, a touch emotional. These traits weren't faults, and James felt awful for rejecting such an inherent part of the man. But he felt smothered and helpless in the wake of Monty's constant hovering. He considered getting him a needy pet, perhaps a small dog with intestinal issues, to keep him busy, but thought that might be a bit too on the nose. And James could use a bit of help sometimes, he reminded himself. He should be grateful to have someone who tried to carry him down the stairs like a twat. He wouldn't have complained ten years ago when he was walking ten blocks every day to get to the grocery.
. So he found himself clutching a broomstick in the back garden of the Burrow, a crowd of mostly-ginger spectators watching and calling out advice to the three Charming men.
"Erm...nevermind." The signal changed and Harry gestured rudely at a driver who stopped right in the path, opting to walk behind his car rather than step into the intersection. "How old are you, Scorpius?"
James was so confused. Did he really ruin everything by not prying into his Mind Healer's personal life? He enjoyed the sessions, enjoyed the snarky appointment reminders, enjoyed the Quidditch match, enjoyed the time away from home that didn't require running errands and texting Monty. They didn't have to be friends, but friend-
"Sorry," Remus recovered, wondering how many times in a day he would find himself apologizing to this man. "Only, that brings us to the subject at hand."
She grinned and leaned over on the loveseat to nudge his shoulder. "I was thinking of taking next week off to visit Mum and Dad," she said lightly, gauging his reaction from the corner of her eye. She had a tendency to push people. She was working on it. "You could stay home if you'd like, but I thought we might bring the kids and make a holiday of it. It's been - "
“There are several goals we can pursue in our appointments, should you choose to continue. Auror Weasley has requested we look into your lost memory of the violent incident which took you from our world, is this something you’re interested in?”
"Are you having me on?" he asked as Malfoy led him back up the walkway to the main road. He wasn't sure why they were walking away when surely Malfoy could just Apparate them from here, but he didn't mind the stroll.
"I'll be glad when we get a proper receptionist and Pansy's banished back to her office with Greg and Vince..." Draco griped, and Harry nudged him with his shoulder for lack of anything to say. He hardly knew the witch and would end up with his foot in his mouth if he dared to agree.
Draco blinked rapidly, his mouth gaping for a moment as the potion tried to force him on a single answer. "Healer Hannah Abbott assisted once with the transcendence charm but she doesn't know the potions required. One of them is my own invention, no one else has the recipe."
Just like before, when he spent years wooing and chasing his little bird, Monty knew they could build a future together if he only laid the groundwork.
"Spare me the victim complex, would you?" she snapped. "I'm telling you not to take advantage of a patient, not damning you to the life of a spinster!"
James couldn't bring himself to do anything. He had done enough. He sat uselessly in his soaked clothes in their sopping bed in their flooded bedroom and waited for Monty to do something.
"Oh yes, let's definitely," a woman said. "Last place we saw, the bin collector couldn't reach the bins and there's no clean way to bring 'em out front. Seemed a real pain."
"Go! Before he comes back out!" Alec hauled his brother up and opened the door, shoving him through.
, he signed, mostly to clarify to Monty. He remembered Fred on the floor of the Great Hall. He had never forgotten that.
A bookcase next to a little writing table was crammed full of books. Four teeming shelves of parenting books, from infant-care to planning for university. An entire row of Agatha Christie caught his eye, then two shelves of recipes, notebooks, and business manuals, and below that, a series of comic books in neat, vertical stacks on the bottom shelf.
James looked heavenward. Who was teaching his boys to talk like sailors? Monty hadn't cursed in years - he just got creative instead.
Dad asked after half an hour of loitering - er, appreciating. Alec shook his head, poking a replica niffler made of hippogriff feathers that was hovering near his elbow. This was more Arthur's scene than his and that was alright. Not everything had to be a winner. Maybe they could go to the fabrication lab downtown tomorrow.
It had been a long, emotional night, and neither of them had slept. Ron didn't answer the landline in the kitchen on the best of days, and this morning did not find either of them in peak condition.
The silence goes on for a very long time. The hum of the fluorescent lights seems deafening. Percy has stopped taking notes. Bellatrix twirls the marker across nimble fingers, her wild hair looking out of place over her fitted skirt suit. Arthur tries to hum but it comes out squeaky, so he clears his throat instead. The silence continues.
He heard the bedroom door creak open and rolled over to find Monty peeking in. James grimaced and rolled his eyes as something crashed into the wall they shared with Al and Ar. Monty scowled at the sound and retreated down the hall. James paused.
feel useless. How he didn't want to brush his teeth or cook or write a letter unless he was hiding from his boyfriend.
"Er - Mr. Charming?" Marge's voice rang out, loud as could be in the echoing alley. "I think you've missed the bins." In a quieter tone, she explained to the potential buyers, "We always try to keep the alley clean and clear for each other, it's the neighborly thing to do..."
Minerva looked unimpressed and a little offended. Right, because she was a cat herself, apparently. He squinted. Actually, he could see it: she was prim and proud, and those old limbs moved languidly with the promise of his swift demise if he mussed her hair.
"I shouldn't see Scorpius tonight, Mum, not like this," he whispered. Ron turned away from the private moment. "And I can't leave him..."
The force of it ricocheted up his leg and into his hip, rattling him to his core until he was sure he would fall apart. But when he looked, he found no bloody stump. Both his feet were intact, his right leg was still raised against the blow, and the top of his shoe was glowing.
Dad ordered, giving the pot another stir. Arthur raced around the kitchen and collected everything onto a tray to bring upstairs to the others.
He sucks the spoon clean and sticks it right into the mound of yellow Jell-O on the counter. It jiggles. The wheels of his cart squeak loudly in an otherwise smooth retreat.
"So did ye get it?" he asked again with a smirk, rooting through the drawers of the wardrobe to find his pyjamas.
Blaise snorted, barked a laugh, and then snorted again, doing a wonderful impression of a kneazle with a cold. "How's that working out, Mr. Malfoy?"
James blinked, shaking his head frantically. A sick feeling in his stomach told him that it was over now, that this incident was the source behind Draco's constant undercurrent of ire against him, told him that James couldn't fix what Harry had done.
"A've invited the professors back," Monty finally said, his voice falsely bright. "An' some old friends, tha' Ron bloke an' his wife." James wasn't surprised in the least but he certainly felt a spark of something... Betrayal? This was Monty's computer research all over again, sticking his nose into something that didn't concern him. Yes, betrayed, he was feeling betrayed!
"You're trying to protect me from someone?" Draco said, clearing his throat around the last of the slug-juice. "Or you're the only one who could pull off a decent impression of Blaise in order to get close to me?"
"Species isn't just appearance, you blithering idiot, it's everything! What you eat, who you mate, where you live. You don't see any wizard colonies in these woods, do you? Because it's not where we belong, we're diff—"
They spent the brisk walk not talking except to brush up on Harry's warming charms. Apparently it was more in the grip than the movement - it also helped when he forced himself to focus, shoving away all thoughts of abandoning his poor godfather for half-baked plots of independence.
"Daddy says I'm not old enough yet." The boy's voice was free of tears now, simple and straightforward. It seemed almost...dead. Harry very much wanted to meet the father who kept his child at home when he should be socializing, making friends, building a life. He had a few things to say to the man.
Draco looks quite pleased with this. He lets Harry linger in limbo for a long moment before finally giving in.
Even better than not being in trouble for being out of bed past midnight, Dad was making a whole pot of his famous hot cocoa! He'd missed it this year; it was a winter tradition at Charming Chocolates for the boys to run the hot pots on the sidewalk for a few hours on weekends, giving out free cocoa and bringing in new customers. They'd been too busy so far.
The ground was dropping away, the people were getting shorter and smaller as he rose above their heads. Arty was literally just
Harry shook his head, glancing at Monty who hesitated for a long moment. Once he got going, however, it became apparent that he was telling more than what Harry meant for him to say:
"Harry James Potter was the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team in his fifth year at Hogwarts," McGonagall supplied, staring at Harry who was now gaping openly at the photo. "He disappeared twelve years ago under some rather unfortunate circumstances... You can see now why my colleague here is so taken aback."
"Donna brought the post," Alec said, nodding to the counter. James stroked Donna - Anne, Lucy, Black Widow, whatever her name was - and picked up the Muggle stationary on his way to the table.
"Blimey buggering bollocks, can I just get a little time to myself?!" he snapped, dabbing the mess with a rag. He wished with ever fiber of his being that he could do the same with the front page of the
"Exactly!" Arthur cries happily, missing the roll of her eyes. "And if we - the employees - are happier, the customers are happier. So. What can we do to make our more...diverse…employees feel more included?"
Monty tracked his every move. He stretched over James's reaching hands to pull down the hanging pots, he wouldn't let him stoop down to put a tray of warm chocolates on the bottom shelf of the cold box, he even pressed Harry down into a chair in the middle of his animated conversation with Malfoy. Harry hardly seemed to notice, except for the odd scowl or eye-roll, which told Ron all he needed to know about how common this was.
James tried to pull back but Draco tightened his grip. He hesitated, then dropped his gaze to study those pale hands as he let himself remember....
Harry signed something with stiff, jerky movements, avoiding everyone's eyes. Monty sent him a complicated glance before he translated slowly:
The Spice Girls make an appearance, the pining begins, and the Golden Git of Gryffindor makes a comeback.
"He's not a fragile little crup," she asserted. "But you've always known where to hit so it hurts most. You've only gotten better at it over the years," she said, tilting toward him but not quite managing to nudge his shoulder.
He still couldn't Apparate, so when Draco went to take his arm in the lobby of his office, with Pansy Parkinson watching gleefully, Harry sort of...swayed away, and headed for the door.
James had a feeling that Monty was tying his bad mood today into his radio silence all week. He wasn't freezing the man out, he was only trying to give him space to think on what he'd said. They would have time to talk it through after Christmas!
Theodore Nott was there that night, with his father, the old man who had tortured him. Round after round after gut-boiling round of the Cruciatus, while Theo and the others asked questions he couldn't answer.
Charming shrugged noncommittally and signed. "Says, a jus' wanted the man tae get back, a dinnae want tae hurt anyone."
"You really should start carrying your wand with you," Ron snapped. "All the time, I mean, not just for translating when we're around. You never know what could... Mate, it could save your life one day!" Hermione knew he was still running in circles trying to find out what had happened to Harry all those years ago. All those miscellaneous investigations were driving his partner mad, but Auror Goldstein had stuck by his side through all of it.
"Potter's seeing a Mind Healer twice a week. Why?" Blaise was obviously unconvinced but Draco shook his head, feigning helplessness. He may not have been magically bound, but he wouldn't just throw Charming to the wolves.
She disappeared through the back door of the kitchen, leaving it ajar. James waited a moment as the frigid air cut through the heat of the stove behind him. He felt like an idiot, standing there in the kitchen with his wand out and his finger bleeding, before he finally gave up on her mission and dug around for a flannel to wrap his finger. He could still hear Rachel rummaging through the bins - or more likely using magic to levitate the rubbish around.
They managed to get lost on the way back to the street that hosted both the office and, more importantly, the Leaky Cauldron's floo. Or maybe they weren't lost...maybe Draco was simply fed up with stumbling around and scuffing up his dumb stupid poncy loafers. Somewhere between watching the streetlights pass through the window of a cab, as if in a trance, and waking up at Blupin Frottage, something happened that was decidedly less warm-and-fuzzy and more cold-sweat-and-fuzzy.
