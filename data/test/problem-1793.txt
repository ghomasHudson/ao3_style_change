"Sure it bothers me," Draco replied.
"Either fussing with his hair or bouncing off the walls out of pure excitement," Pansy responded. "And he crawls out of his dorm, and after everyone else arrives of course, we'll eat the delicacies Ron suggested, dance to Draco's ballads, and play a few games. And, as per request by one Hermione Granger, they are all sadly PG-rated. An absolute downer by the way," Pansy huffed. "What's a good party without a good round of strip poker?"
She removed her hand as if it’d been stung.
“What?”
"I'm not!" she interrupted, the tone in her voice telling Draco all that he needed.
"Draco's sick?" Blaise shouted out all of a sudden, standing up indignantly.
secret!"
His hair was matted with filth and his clothes were torn and soiled beyond repair. Chains bound his legs and hands, a gag kept him from talking, and he looked like he’d missed a few meals, but it was definitely Draco. The promised black eye and bruises marred his skin, but he looked unhurt otherwise. Which was good. Harry would hate to have to track down that cowardly scum and kill him for having lied.
"Are you going to procrastinate by drawing again?" Blaise asked, snapping him out of his thoughts.
Draco smiled, shook his head, and grabbed Harry's hand with his right one. It was an uncharacteristically bold move, but Draco was too pleased to care. Their ingredients' preparation was brilliant, and Harry did everything perfectly. He couldn't help himself from complimenting him (even though he knew this would earn several second glances from all of Hogwarts).
“Not really. I’m sure the guys could help you find some furs for you to use if you’d rather sleep with them on deck. Though, I can’t guarantee they’ll leave you alone. A pretty boy like you'll attract some attention, and you might end up with a bedfellow who’s not as polite and respectful as I am.”
Harry laughed drily. "Is that a new term for hexing the crap out of me? If so, I have bad news for you: I already know I'm an arse. I want to hex myself in private. Leave me alone."
As Harry's hand slowly slipped away from his, Draco awkwardly patted her back with his left hand. But, instead of letting go and smiling shakily as he expected her to, Pansy slapped the back of his head, put one hand on her hips, and looked absolutely furious with him.
Draco allowed them to do so for another moment or two before diving into the main point of his speech.
"What it were me? What if you could have done something to help me?" Pansy asked defiantly. "What if you knew that you needed help from someone more intelligent than you because it could possibly help me? Wouldn't you do anything to save me?"
Draco winced. "Hi."
It was rather strange to come to that realization.
friend get you, Harry?"
It was either his crazy friends with rage in their veins at the moment, or it was a team of the Death Eaters that escaped yesterday.
"By what power?"
"No, you're Sirius. I'm Harry," Harry replied stupidly. Draco wanted to pinch his thigh for being so stupid. So he did just that. Harry hissed and glared at him, but couldn't do anything when Sirius agreed.
"You— you and—"
"No, of course not," she replied, her jaw tight. "Cho said you wanted to talk to me."
Hey it's been a while :)
The couple sat in the bedroom in silence, both remembering that day just a little bit differently. Where Harry saw his life's worst mistake, Draco saw his life's very salvation.
To his credit, Ron didn’t so much as flinch. “Look, I know you’re worried about him but—”
Brief recap: The two of them talk about the letter Narcissa sent and Harry's rejection for Draco's friendship in first year, and Draco reminisces a little bit about his actions of the past, which he admits to himself that he was doing them to put on a tough facade to protect his fellow Slytherins. Harry also suggests that the two of them went to a Mind Healer together, but Draco is worried about the impact on their images.
“What of it?” Harry snapped as he pushed away from Blaise’s hold on him. It was a bad idea, something that Harry realized when the world spun and he had to stumble before regaining his balance. “I’ll be fine.”
“It’ll take more than words, Harry.”
They spoke no words, only having silent conversations with their eyes— the witch was much more distraught than the wizards, one of whom were too busy cooing at baby Harry to even focus on the conversation while the other was busy trying to write a note to Harry's future guardians. When the wizard was done, he asked his fellow wizard to place Harry down before placing the note in Harry's tightly clenched fist.
If Granger heard Blaise say that, she would go on a killing spree— killing Blaise and resurrecting him before killing him again to make fun of his stupidity.
"Eat."
In one fluid motion, Draco took a step forward and slapped Harry across the face. Remus barked and whined in confusion, trying to push himself between the two of them. Harry grabbed the dog, held him tight and begged for this nightmare to end.
“Did Dumbledore try to stall for more time?” he drawled lazily right when the sun’s beams were starting to peep out from wherever they were hiding from. Jolting from his daze, Harry digested those words and frowned.
night never ended.
"Oh," Potter stuttered, face red with embarrassment. "I… I didn't realize. I mean, I only heard about a dragon so..."
"Are we done?" Harry asked curiously.
"Of course, of course." Blaise hummed. "You know she just wanted to help out, right?"
Draco didn't know if Harry was pissed anymore.
Harry's ears perked up and he looked towards Draco happily, only for his expression to fall just as quickly as it'd risen. "What about—"
Harry's cheeks flushed. "I forgot that too."
Which totally wasn't fair of him to say that. Because how was Draco supposed to tell him, 'oh hey, Blaise, congrats on getting back on the Quidditch team—by the way, I'm sick with a fictional disease, no biggie'? Blaise would have killed him much faster than this stupid disease was going to the moment he found out. And though he doesn't have much to live for, Draco values his life.
She turned, wearing a slight frown upon seeing him.
"Well, Draco's not his father. Besides, he told me everything."
shouldn't have failed.
Things were different for Harry.
Flipping him off, Draco cursed him out for Theo's own mistakes.
Harry snorted. "In case you didn't notice, that house is way too big for one person. Besides, it can be our safe place. Not just mine." A pause. "God, that was cringey wasn't it?"
And who else but the Boy Who Lived could do the job?
Not really, though.
If fire wasn't enough to kill the slimy, vile creature, Draco was prepared to call upon Harry's army of shadow warriors (he, of course, would have to ask Harry to conjure one first) and get them all to drag Voldemort down to the very depths of hell. Let the bastard rot there.
Oh. They knew the caveman. So he wasn't a caveman.
"Please. Hermione, I caught you within five minutes," Pansy snapped, though it lacked any spite or hate. "If anything, you didn't use any of your personal means."
"I apologize," he drawled lazily.
Please let me know what you guys think about either my writing or the plot! I'd be happy to answer questions if you have any as well! Thank you for reading and see you next update! <3
Of course, it might have helped that they shared a bed each night.
This has to be a mistake. Draco can't be in love with Harry. After all they've been through, Draco couldn't be risking their odd friendship for something like this. So it must be a mistake.
"Alright, fine. Last night was pretty fun and, while you were sleeping, I realized we could prank our friends first thing in the morning. They obviously don't know you were awake since yesterday so I thought it'd be really funny if we waited until it was nearly breakfast time— that's when they first checked on you these past couple of days— and scared the living crap out of them."
"Not if I what?" Malfoy challenged.
The bloke was such an idiot— going and falling for the son of his enemy's subordinate. Truthfully, Draco was the one who fell in love with him first, and he wouldn't be stuck in this predicament if it wasn't for his own stupid heart. Which, by the way, Draco still didn't know what to do about it.
The Dark Lord would try and succeed at destroying his only 'light at the end of the tunnel'.
to do."
"Yes."
Lucius’s son, a man a little older than the age Hermione was when she first went to stay with Lucius. Though Lucius cared very little for his family members as individuals— Harry can tell just by the way that Hermione, a scholar who Lucius reigned in money from, returned— he obviously cared deeply for his family name. Any tainting to his son would be a twist of a stab wound to Lucius himself.
He sprinkled the rose petals into their cauldron and smiled happily as the thick scent of
If the latter was the case, then Draco needed to hastily grab at whatever information he can get. He had a responsibility to somehow use these pieces of information to their advantage. He had to figure out a way to keep Harry safe— from both his muggle relatives and the Dark Lord.
Because Draco's on the wrong side.
"Of course. Harry looked like he was going to kill Draco. I hated seeing it."
Potter was absolute shit at any form of schooling. He fidgeted all the time, barely paying attention unless the topic the class was discussing was something that caught his interest beforehand. He fell asleep in History of Magic as though Professor Binns wasn't the most brilliant professors he ever met, and he boasted off his wandless, wordless magic like it wasn't even a big deal.
Harry had already offered Draco his protection from the crew and never sought anything in return. It did no one any harm to use his name; if anything, it prevented harm from coming to those who tried to touch Draco without his permission. The thoughts nagged at him though, and he resolved to bring it up once Harry returns.
"Really," Draco deadpanned.
For the first time, you hear birds.
"I don't know, okay? I had just been worried all year—"
Potter was the Savior.
"Yeah. Your childhood, what you like, what you dislike, how your break was… that sort of stuff."
When Harry's voice trailed off, Draco immediately lurched forwards.
In reality, he was just grateful that they weren't yelling
ed you! It's an Unforgivable! How is that love?"
Cass shrugged. "You've been really busy lately with whatever secret society all of you are collaborating on. You missed out Second month anniversary, and before that, you ran off to France for a week without remembering to tell me."
he thought viciously.
No, both of those options sounded too... Gryffindor for the likes of him. But Draco didn't want to accidentally trick Harry into doing something he doesn't want to do either. He wanted Harry to make the first move, to reassure him that his thoughts were actually right. That Harry truly did love him.
But Harry won the very last Quidditch Cup he'll ever be able to win— in fact, he's won six consecutive Quidditch Cups, and that's if he includes third year when he faced off with Draco in the last match and nearly pissed his pants while admiring the Slytherin's side profile. He barely snapped out of his daze in time, but nobody ever has to know.
Draco's bodyguard.
!" Draco cried out impulsively, letting his light magic shoot out of his wand. He gripped his left hand with his right in an attempt to gain better control, and he sighed in relief when Harry, Hermione, and Longbottom looked much healthier and stronger. The healing-slash-energizing spell didn't end up hurting them. Thank Merlin.
He casted a cleaning charm on the room, sitting down before he let himself close his eyes and simply feel the breeze. And then, as Harry took a seat beside him, Draco smiled and mentally imagined his own constellation. He knew it could be best seen during summertime, but he had a feeling he would be able to see it in this gorgeous darkness. When he felt a stare burning a hole into the side of his head, Draco opened his eyes and glanced towards Harry.
Malfoys don't mistaken things.
(See the end of the chapter for
As an apology, I'll make sure to post another one tomorrow!
After they confided in each other near the Great Lake, they both began dropping information about themselves that was much more profound than their favorite colors and their favorite types of music.
Harry didn’t know how he should answer.
Draco shook his head. "She did, but they were usually forced."
Draco shut his eyes, taking a deep breath between every two steps forward. When he glanced up, he was startled to see the note he’d given Potter jutted out towards him. Draco slowly snatched it. Then Potter's mouth opened to ask what had got to be the most stupid question Draco had ever heard him say:
"It's with my mother," he said quietly. "She lent hers to me."
And, surprisingly, Harry had been the hardest to convince. Their short conversation had been so terrible, Draco still remembered it word for word.
As if Blaise had finally caught on, his eyes widened. He spelled his materials into his bag, sprinting out of the library under the pretense that Draco would murder him once the countdown reached zero.
While everyone just stares at them in absolute shock, Draco mindlessly accepts the proposal and Harry becomes so flustered Lily is vaguely reminded of the day when she finally gave in to James' horrible flirting
Draco weighed his options, trying to choose between telling Harry the truth and lying. The last time he lied to Harry… Harry had called him out on his bull.
"Let me go, Potter!" Draco demanded. When Potter didn't slow, he screamed at the onlookers they passed by. "Look! Potter's kidnapping me! You're all seeing me get kidnapped!"
"The estate is currently in use, Draco Malfoy. There are nine inhabitants. Are these your allies?"
's back."
Scorpius nodded slowly, green eyes still full of confusion.
"Join me," Harry urged.
The sounds of another pair of footsteps urged him to take two breaths and find the most concealed table in the library.
Pansy continued staring at him in complete, shocked silenced. Draco didn't realize it until much later, but he had rarely thanked anyone. His gratitude was always hidden behind a sarcastic or witty comment. Never once had he voiced it so straight-forwardly. But, Draco figured the situation called for him to do so.
but he came close to doing so once when Draco mentioned that he'd be gone for a week. After that, Harry, quite literally of course, attached himself to Draco's hip for two days. These additional four hours must have been incredibly painful for him.
"Wait, you're actually okay with doing this?" Harry asked. He sounded so disbelieving Draco wondered if he had been deprived of anyone doing the simplest things for him. Well, Legilimency was a difficult subject to teach so Draco supposed it wasn't a simple 'thing'.
He was just barely able to disarm Pansy when the horn sounded from the harbor. Harry’s ship was visible at the docks, and there was an unspoken undercurrent of excitement as the village gathered to welcome their Vikings home. Draco stood at the periphery, watching the couples reunite and children jump into their parents’ arms.
Draco looked at her, surprised by the way she easily accepted that he was coming along. Weaslette simply grinned back at him.
"God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry," he chanted, hoping that it'd be enough to reverse what he'd done.
Malfoy made it impossible to not feel embarrassed about anything.
"Yes."
Harry cleared his throat, scratching the back of his head and smiling nervously. "I think it's because Draco and I... we hated each other in the beginning. Not a lot of people can do a complete one-eighty and y'know..."
"It's still healing," Draco sighed.
"Absolutely not. To whatever you've done, I'm neither forgiving you or doing as you wish. Absolutely not."
"Yeah."
Padfoot. Pad foot. ‘Pad’ originates 1590s Britain that meant soft cushion or reliability; ‘foot’, originates from Proto-Indo-European dialect meaning a corresponding part of the vertebrae of the animal, usually used when referring to humans, tables, or dogs. Sirius Black was a reliable friend who had the animagus form of a dog. Most likely a black dog to symbolize how misinterpreted and misunderstood he is.
(See the end of the chapter for
"We decided tonight would be as good of a time as any," Draco continued, taking a seat. Blaise followed. "We'll be meeting where we had on Saturday."
Immediately after that realization, Harry shuffled towards the door, feeing more cold and more abandoned than he ever recalled feeling, and pounded his fist against the door.
Blaise waited patiently for him to continue. It was the least he could do after learning Harry's secret.
"She is. And you were the one to make sure that I had the second thing. After you transferred the Le Havre place to me—"
Harry nodded. "Yeah. She seemed okay with it."
They were known as 'the Dursleys', if Draco remembered correctly.
Harry's face fell, but Draco was too preoccupied to notice.
Harry, who had long since thought something like this would happen, had been ecstatic.
"I'm not stupid," Draco replied instead of answering his questions.
"Your lie sucked," Draco replied, sticking his tongue out. "Besides, he's my godfather. I can't lie to him without facing repercussions. What if he revokes my chocolate-in-the-dorms rights? "
Draco shrugged, then drawled, "For raising you as a pig for slaughter."
Draco snorted, folding his arms. "Like hell we wouldn't have."
After some time, Harry silently kicked off his boots and crawled into the bed, dressed in only a dark pair of trousers.
"Well... it's a bit embarrassing, but I've never been really good at Potions and spent a really long week trying to catch up on everything. When I sat down today, I was really incapable of focusing on the questions and remembering the answers. Instead, I was thinking about a lot of stupid things and in my desperation to focus and finally do something right, I thought it would be a good idea for me to voice them outloud. However, when I did, I realized that they were outlandish and stupid," he explained. "Malfoy— er, Draco was directly next to me so he heard everything I was saying."
"No flowers?" he joked.
"Ugh, no! Why would it be you?" Harry asked. Though Blaise was not, in any way, offended, Harry's cheeks pinkened. "Sorry. I just forgot you knew."
"Why," Draco pretended to admonish. "Doesn't he have any respect towards you, Dolores? Surely, if he had any issue, he should have come to you instead!"
The Malfoy name— not that Draco really cared— would be dragged through the dirt.
For a split moment, after the Dark Lord pulled away from Draco's mind, he wondered if he made the right choice. But then, he glanced at his mother and father, who were both obviously relieved, and remembered everything that they've ever done for him. He decided that he should repay them in some way, and if this method were to bond him with a monstrous murderer until he dies— Draco expected it to be a year or two— then so be it.
He didn't quite trust himself to not scream bloody murder again. Pansy noticed their arrival, quickly wiping her cheeks to get rid of the tears that kept falling. She suddenly stood, walked towards them, and hugged Blaise so tightly he feared his spinal cord was going to snap in half before she moved to constrict someone else. But then she let him go and did the same to Hermione, who clung back just as fiercely. Blaise decided that women are a force to be reckoned with.
"Well, they had to keep Draco quiet, didn't they? Money was the only thing that swayed Draco, and the moment that they stepped out, Draco exposed the ambassador. 'He didn't give me chocolate' he said."
"Oh."
"Sure, we're not being smart," Pansy said. "Of course we're not. We're being stupid and reckless and utterly Gryffindor-like, but at least we're sticking to it. What exactly are you objecting? What are you afraid of, Draco?"
Immensely pleased with himself, Draco placed it on the counter,
Again, Draco imagined Sirius's distorted face contorting meanly. "What do you mean 'everything'?"
Potter's face twisted. "I remember that, but then you were a twat to Weasley. No, wait, I mean Ron. You were mean to Ron. He gave me a sandwich!"
symbols and numbers and they don't really
This threw Harry into another fit of giggles.
Potter pursed his lips. "You know, that time when I told you I don't like all the fancy titles like 'The Chosen One' and you lied to me about how you don't like chocolate. You told me I had an uncle too."
But now that he had time to calm down, Draco admitted that he'd never been happier.
"No."
"And for good reason! Voldemort's going to torture you!"
“Ugh!” Harry buried his face in his hands. He didn’t want to hear this. As if he didn’t already know he’d messed up the best thing that ever happened to him.
Draco smirked back and strode over to the goblin and the house-elf waiting outside the vaults. He held out a hand to the goblin. "Thank you for your time today. May your gold overflow with the services you grant me."
Harry, with wide eyes of both bewilderment and— confusingly— terror, followed him.
"What happened to the basket?"
Harry looked away. "Was trying to find the bathroom."
"I've got no idea." Blaise shrugged. "But I would ask Granger if I were you. Since you're buddy-buddy with her now."
"Trust me. She will. And on a more serious note... Hermione, I'm not going to make excuses for how much of a bastard I've been. I'm not going to promise that I won't still be a bastard. But, I will apologize and figure out a way to earn your forgiveness. And I will find a way to pay you in advance for your care for Pansy."
"When Draco wakes up, you will continue your occlumency lessons with him," Snape drawled. "You are a hopeless case against me and Draco needs to strengthen his Legilimency skills."
When the time came for him to enter the classroom, he took a seat beside Draco Malfoy, who had come back for their Eighth Year as well, free from Azkaban thanks to Harry's testimony and ambitious enough to take every single NEWT class available at Hogwarts. To Harry's knowledge, he was faring quite well in them. It made him feel proud, but he refused to express this emotion since Malfoy would surely take offense to it.
," Harry begged. His voice cracked, and he sounded as though he was moments away from bursting into tears. Draco's gut lurched. "At least until that guest—" he growled 'guest'— "leaves, alright? If he's gone before summer, you can forget that I even offered. But, if he's not,
He hated that he was so ignorant.
Draco, always having been stronger than Narcissa could have ever hoped for, stepped forwards and bowed his head. He folded his hands behind his back, kneeling on one knee. "Greetings, Dark Lord."
uncle had feelings for a
If they looked at this rationally, maybe this Hanahaki thing would be spread to the other person. After all, that's how diseases are spread.
Draco was going to do exactly those things.
"That... those stories does sound ridiculous."
But he couldn't just tell Blaise the truth, could he?
Draco offered her a slight smile. "Thank you, Mother."
"Why would it be Blaise?" Harry asked, flabbergasted by Draco's accusation and not really looking concerned for his own safety. "He's not the only bloke I know."
The fact that they complimented each other well enough to spin random topics out of thin air and make hour-long discussions about mentioned discussions.
Growing up, Draco had heard two different opinions of this man, and he'd never known which one was worse: the kind, young man who was wrongly prosecuted for murder, or the brutal, hateful man who betrayed Harry's family. His mother constantly took him to the old Grimmauld Place, showed him Sirius Black's name, and told stories of five teenagers who all loved each other very much. They were undoubtedly painted memories of his mother, Andromeda Tonks, Aunt Bellatrix, Uncle Regulus, and Sirius Black. His mother preached about a beautiful son, who'd been sorted into Gryffindor and befriended a blood traitor, and about how the beautiful son made all the right choices. His mother made sure to mention how brave he was, and how he never hesitated to put Severus in his place after making fun of his friends.
Blaise scowled at the reasoning, folding his arms and continuing to chastise Draco with nothing more than his eyes. "Draco."
"And a bit close. Draco enjoys indulging in her fantasies whenever she pops up in the Common Room."
"Huh."
Draco mentally face-palmed. Although he'd had somewhat of a personal vendetta against the redhead since they were eleven, he didn't realize just how much of a clumsy dork he was. Ambitious for trying to achieve his goal— though it is a bit of a strange goal— but a clumsy dork nonetheless.
"We've been worried sick! We looked everywhere for you!" Blaise added.
For days on end, Draco did not lay a single finger on the letters that he received. He knew that Pansy would sooner or later start cursing him out; thus, he took extra safety precautions and hid in the safety of his bedsheets. And although he felt awfully lonely, he never dared to ask Leia to bring them all to him. He knew that he should never hint towards hope or love or adoration when a sociopathic murderer was living with him.
"Draco, I— I don't know if the past me would have believed that I got the chance to get to know you and learn to like you, but I do know that I can't imagine us any differently now."
"Did you not know?"
"Potter," he greeted coldly.
While Draco stared at all of them blankly, he decided that he was probably imagining everything that had just happened. He was probably suffering from the effects of a healing potion gone haywire.
Circling back around the village one last time, Harry was no closer to a decision than he had been before. Seeing no point in this fruitless exercise, he headed back home.
"You're awfully immature," Hermione commented.
"Draco, I don't know what to say to that," Harry admitted. "But, if that's one of your concerns, you could always talk to my Mind Healer too. He's pretty cool and he's used to hearing all about my shit ton of trauma so... he'll probably be okay with you. Hell, he'd probably want to help you. He fought for Voldemort during the war too, you know."
Draco felt like he should press more, but they'd reached the doors to the Great Hall. Draco blinked, confused since he didn't recall leaving Hogsmeade and walking into castle grounds. And, judging by Harry's confused noise, he clearly didn't either.
Draco peered inside the box again.
He hated that he knew Harry well enough to know that Harry already made up his mind and that he wouldn't be able to stop him from leaving no matter how much he begged.
"Actually, yeah. But it's alright if we don't do this now. Breakfast starts soon doesn't it?"
Draco sheepishly smiled. "Sirius Black."
Draco nodded understandingly. "Father had a bit of a sore spot when it came to Dobby. He was one of the last house-elves to join the Malfoy estate and was easily the most mischievous. He and I got into so much trouble, Father lost a lot of face in the wizarding world due to our childish pranks and acts of sabotage."
What?
Draco arched an eyebrow. "Are you sure? Because Blaise went from wanting to hex you to defending you."
"Shut up," Draco hissed.
When Draco would rather like to keep the farthest distance away from Potter as possible?
"On second thought, don't put the knife away. Pansy, go batshit crazy," Theo said, shooting Draco a murderous glare. "And Hermione, do you know any 'bring back to life' magic by any chance? I want to have a go at Draco after Pansy's done."
Stunned, Draco couldn't muffle the giggle that escaped him. "Potter, I don't think you're on the right page."
However, since the world was obviously out to humiliate him terribly, someone did.
He glanced upwards, meeting Potter's surprised gaze.
His words slurred as Draco responded, "Yeah. Air didn't feel right."
There were so many sides of Draco Malfoy— like a mirror that showed different reflections simultaneously. And Harry walked into love with each and every one of them with his eyes and arms wide open... well, he had a feeling he started running back then. He probably walked into it during first year like Ron said the other day. In actuality, Harry didn't know when it actually happened.
Still. If Professor Snape showing an emotion other than disgust and indifference wasn't surprising, Blaise didn't know what would be.
"Because I said so," Professor Hayes huffed. "As this was the only assignment I was planning to assign this year, this 'emotional partnership' will determine whether or not you pass my class."
Draco's perspective of her may or may not be due to the fact that he hates her annoying voice and her atrocious hair.
He took a not-so-subtle step back. "I found Granger's idea was rather interesting. I never thought of magical creatures being like wizards and witches before."
Draco narrowed his eyes.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Apology accepted."
"Stop it," Harry shushed. He redirected all of his attention to Draco, making him feel as though he was the center of the universe. "And I'm pretty sure you heard what Ron said earlier."
Theo snickered. "I didn't know about the estate being wagered, but Draco mentioned that he'd bet on whether or not he'd return to Hogwarts. If he lost, he'd return to homeschooling to appease Narcissa. If he won, he got another year."
"What makes you say that?" Hermione inquired.
He did, but he wasn't about to admit it.
"So what?" Potter returned.
"So... we aren't doing this again?" Draco asks.
His eyes were watery and his breath was shaky, but his smile was steady as he stepped forwards and wrapped his arms around Harry's waist.
What the hell did he get himself into?
"Well, that's because I was focused on bullying you," Draco replied with a shrug.
Her eye twitched. "So this is where I come in."
Nodding slowly, Ron leaned away from him. "Alright, mate. What is it?"
Narcissa managed to hide her smile behind her hand.
He could listen to Draco saying the same thing over and over again and he wouldn't even mind.
Unfortunately, none of those words were the ones that came out.
"I thought they were dating," Ron said, nose scrunching up. "Pretty sure they were. I mean, if they aren't, I was just pointing out how they act like they are. Not trying to offend them."
"Yeah."
Harry blinked, casting a quick time charm, and muttered, "It's been one hour, fourteen minutes, and seventeen seconds. Nineteen now."
Draco cutely tugged on his sleeve. "Keep me company until I sleep then."
"What about me?" Draco asked in return.
She huffed at that. "That's not a life or death situation. Besides, I'm not sure that she'll listen to me."
Draco grit his teeth. "I don't know. Nothing to be approved by my father anyways."
"Couldn't he say it nicer?"
He didn't understand why Larissa didn't have to do anything either; all she did all day was butter up to papa by baking him his favorite desert, treacle tart, and read some stupid potion books in the library like a loser who doesn't have any friends or any respectable hobbies. She hasn't changed at all from that nerdy eleven-year-old who buttered people up to get better grades than Scorpius ever got.
“That's right,” Draco agreed steadily, his eyes sparkling like it’d done before as he smiled softly in Harry's direction. “Two sides of a galleon.”
"Hey, I think we can go up some more," Harry called, tearing down Draco's reason for excitement. Draco tore his gaze away from the dirty classroom and stared at Harry, who was pointing to an old ladder. "I don't think we can sit here anyways."
“I know,” Draco whined as he cuddled the big bear-like dog closer. “I miss him too.”
Hermione laughed. "I'm not sure whether I should laugh or cry."
Draco ran a finger across Harry's scar, kissing his temple lightly.
"It is nothing of a big matter."
The effect is instant— Harry's face opens up in a bright, blinding smile and he throws himself on Draco in an awkward hug.
Draco rolled his eyes. "It wasn't an apology. It was a mere acknowledgement."
He turned on his heels and left.
"What are you thinking about?" Pansy whispered.
Harry, thinking he has a chance: Okay! Draco, are you going to Hogsmeade?
His voice was like a command, his eyes sharp with steel as he conjured a chair for himself in front of Draco. He reminded Draco sharply that he had been an army commander, a rebel leader who proved himself fearless and strong-minded time and time again. He reminded Draco that Harry Potter was a stubborn bastard.
He didn't really look towards Ron to see whether or not he'd complied with his directions because his eyes landed on Harry. And suddenly Draco was feeling pretty sure he only owned one shirt. After all, Draco had never seen Harry wear anything other than the Hogwarts uniform (classes and Quidditch) or the grey t-shirt. He'll try to convince Blaise to make a shirt or two for Harry as well. Maybe he could offer to do a week's worth of homework?
"I don't know. Either I just can't or I don't want to."
"No, they aren't," Hermione said, folding her arms. "Harry didn't even blink when I told him to go with Draco tomorrow."
He was in love with him.
After all, Severus rarely called anyone up after classes. Perhaps he'd done it once or twice when a particularly life-endangering situation happened, but he'd never paid much attention to Draco for Potions. He
That day was the same day Draco prioritized Pansy and Blaise over himself.
"Which made it more amusing than it should've been," Draco replied. He snickered, remembering how Montague hadn't even cared. He'd shrugged and went away, only to return to his table two hours later with a delicious cake. If heartbreak led to delicious cakes, then Draco was pleased he'd helped in some way. Harry, though, wasn't and Draco rushed to reassure him. "There luckily weren't any hard feelings. He accepted my rejection and went on to create the best chocolate cakes in existence— is this dark chocolate molten by the way? I sense a bit of melted fudge."
And there had been no indication that he'd even received their Christmas gifts.
Blaise sighed. "Besides, you're the sarcastic bastard none of us can seem to hate. No one can replace you. We wouldn't want anyone to replace you."
Potter turned to smile reassuringly at him. "So are you bothered? By our uncles being married that is."
"Never said I considered it," Draco replied, acting like a little shit. Pansy resisted the urge to run over and slap his arm. "Should we eat breakfast on the way?"
"Because they do." Blaise nodded gravely. "And Ron, do you remember the scandal between the old Ministry of Magic and the Ministress of Magic of the Americas? Draco threw a hissy fit and got them slammed into Azkaban for child harassment and attempt of murder. All because he wanted a chocolate frog and Professor Snape refused to give any to him so he had to throw a temper tantrum."
Her good mood was instantly ruined. "No."
Serenity and peace hung in place of awkward silence as he strolled towards one of the more secluded tables of the library. They covered Draco like a protective, invisible blanket, allowing him to feel safe as he reached for a Transfiguration book. It helped that no one except the most diligent, more tolerant of his existence students of Hogwarts were there.
But then his mother gave him gifts to console him: a shrunken trunk that Draco knew contained his belongings and two Black heirlooms. One of which got rid of the Dark Mark and belonged to a 'good man'. The ring symbolized that Draco was free to choose between the good and evil, and that those coerced onto the wrong side can start over and make their own choice.
"I wouldn't have thought that I'd come out as a bisexual this year either," Harry added. Then his eyes widened. "Wait, did I just come out to you? I don't think I've ever come out to you before."
“You learned this for me?” Harry asked around the food, chewing enthusiastically and eyeing the rest of the pot. “Thank you.”
Draco sighed. "Fine."
A silent beat.
Draco rolled his eyes. "These three are going to be the face of our world and you worry about trivial matters such as time? You should be rejoicing, honestly. It will be your brand and name they'll be prancing around in."
So the prospect of finding himself a new bed partner wasn’t alluring, even if Harry seemed much kinder than Astoria ever had.
Potter reached their table first.
"Taking Draco to the dorms," he quipped. Snape narrowed his eyes, clearly displeased with his answer for absolutely no reason.
Harry nodded again. "You said there were four basic ones. Does it mean there are more?" he asked brilliantly.
Smiling softly, Draco nodded.
Poor Reg is all confused as to why his favorite nephew hates him but eventually catches on-- he teaches Draco about the art of braiding his hair and tucking it behind his ears, as well as looking absolutely gorgeous while pissed off-- and Harry quickly forgives Uncle Reg for being too cool.
Pansy snorted. "The only things he was up to back then was obsessing over cleaning his room, nagging at us to do something worthwhile, and chocolate tasting. Well, he also spent his time messing around with charm mechanics."
Please let me know what you guys think about either my writing or the plot! I'd be happy to answer questions if you have any as well! Thank you for reading and see you next update! <3
Ages eight to eleven were just as bad, if not worse. And Harry resented his muggle relatives for that.
Draco still gave his father a reason to.
Potter shrugged. "I'll be fine. What are you learning in Defense? You're taking the NEWT one, right?"
He glanced towards Potter, who was clearly more interested in his feet than Draco's self-evaluation. Draco let out an inaudible sigh of relief. "Right here?"
a wand. You have to harness it, craft it to individuals' specific quirks. Crafting one especially made for me is nearly impossible for a wizard whose never made a wand in his life. Besides, how am I supposed to know what materials to use to craft one? How am I supposed to get them? And not to mention how I need to have a wand to craft a wand."
But then she didn't say anything more, simply sending Millicent an apologetic glance before addressing the rest of the class. "If there are no further questions, let's begin. Please find your partner and begin working immediately."
That had Harry straightening his back. "What do you mean no Ron? And no Draco? But Mione—"
"Well, it's a risky procedure for one," Theo replied. "I inherited some medical books that I read a while back. In summary, lung surgery is one of the most complex ones, especially since it has to do with your ability to breathe and provide oxygen for your heart."
The first page was an incredibly well-done Slytherin Crest. The knight's head was realistic and detailed. The snake in the dead center was absolutely gorgeous. Every scale was drawn out meticulously, and the eyes were detailed with light dashes that made it look even more realistic. Even the 'Slytherin' that was written out was meticulously written in some font of medieval cursive.
Then the next month there was a White Trumpet petal.
Then perhaps Granger meant family-wise, Draco concluded. But that soon didn't make any sense either.
Luckily, as a Viking, it was easy enough to start.
Draco didn't want to die
Luckily, nobody else was in the Slytherin Common Room to witness the way Blaise's magic cut through the silence. Most were probably in the library, still eating, or skipping lunch to continue practice on the Quidditch Pitch. He has a dark scowl, his expression darkening as his sense of betrayal grew. If anyone other than Pansy, Theo, and Draco had witnessed this, they would have labelled him 'mad' or 'dangerous'. Others would have said he was on the way down the same road his mother had been on before she drove herself to insanity.
"Then why are you finding Potter a present?"
"Merlin," he snickered one last time. He carefully handed his copy of the script over, pointing at the first line at the top of the page. "This is your line, alright? Don't go saying… saying lines of other people."
"Good morning to you too."
Draco froze.
Draco let go of tension he wasn't aware he was holding in his posture. A weak noise escaped him as he began making his way over to them. And that's when his father saw him.
"Absolutely not," Severus sneered. "This little slimeball doesn't deserve to be on first-name basis with me."
When Draco finally looked up from his mini pity session, he realized Blaise was gone. Some time between when Draco had told Blaise about the letter and when he began riffling through the sketchbook, Blaise had left him.
"Agreed. That's why I thought she was taking the piss when she offered to lend me her notes."
"That's what I always say!" Blaise claimed. "Smart idiot doesn't even need his books. As long as he hears it, he'll remember it until the day he dies!"
"Oh, I'm not," he reassured. "But, it would be amusing to set impossibly high standards for Blaise again."
But did he have to ask Draco out on a
"Yes."
Nodding slightly, she cleared her throat and asked, "How long have you played the piano? How do you know Muggle ballads?"
"What? You're alright, Malfoy. Probably not the worst bloke to die next to."
"Playing," Harry responded simply. "I think he's hungry again."
Draco's cheeks flushed. He felt like he just received permission to wed Harry.
Feeling a bit called out, Draco scowled. "Thanks for offering. If Harry did say anything, I'll smack you instead from now on." Then he put a hand on his hips, staring at his friends. "So? Explain what you all are doing here, won't you? I wasn't expecting you for another day. Another two if any of you found a particularly good shop and wanted to revisit to buy gifts."
"Oh. You can go back to sleep," Harry said, as though Draco wasn't going to freak out until he passed out if Harry didn't confide in him. "I'll, er, I don't think I can sleep again."
Draco didn't know what to do if Harry didn't feel the same.
Draco pouted. "You're such a git."
Without hesitation, Draco said, "Yes. Of course."
Draco grinned. "Don't. Granger will do plenty on her own."
"Before we start, I would like to say something," he said lowly.
"'Enough is never enough'," Theo replied dutifully. "That's the first thing he was taught as a kid. He couldn't be good enough, he couldn't be well enough. He had to be perfect. No 'enough' following it. And if Draco couldn't be that, he was not loved. That is the way that the Malfoys, Blacks, and most pureblood families are."
Blaise trailed behind him for a bit before saying, "Does this have something to do with Potter? You've been acting off since you started talking to him."
"At least you're aware," Harry snickered. "I accept your apology."
"Oh really," Sirius dead-panned. Harry squirmed where he sat.
"Hey, this idiot tricked you into eating a whole plate of fruits today. I'm stuffed," Harry commented. Draco arched a perfect brow. "Fine, not the whole plate, but still. A forth of it was pretty good. Especially since you told me you don't like eating."
"Well, yeah, but what would you insult him for?"
Draco laughed. "Merlin's beard, no. Of course not. I have a party to plan and you already said you'd bring me back a box of chocolates. I don't need anything from Hogsmeade."
"Bullshit. He handed you a vial. It's colorless. Took weeks to brew," Blaise accused. Draco looked away sheepishly. He knows better than all of them that an entirely clear vial means that all the ingredients are of the highest quality, and that it means the difficulty of the potion was higher than required in NEWTs. "Theo takes care of you. And Pansy protects you. On the other hand, I don't even know what the hell you're sick with—"
Definitely different.
“Draco. Please—” Harry gestured to the empty side of the bed— “join me.”
Glancing around, Draco wondered the same as well. He decided not to say anything though, continuing to walk and pretending like it didn't bother him to feel all the eyes on him. And then, right when he was about to walk down the last flight of stairs to reach the Slytherin Commons, Draco realized exactly what Potter was doing: protecting him from anyone who was waiting for him to be alone to threaten him.
He was there for Draco and nobody but Draco could tell him to fuck off.
"Yeah right," Draco sneered, thinking back to how he'd saved Draco time and time again in the past.
Harry's easy attitude slipped off, replacing itself with a concerned and intrigued one. "Do you not want to be?"
. Draco, I was terrified.”
He began walking towards the boys' dormitories, hoping Blaise wasn't following him to probe about Potter. It was only when they were behind Draco's door did Blaise speak up again.
"Yeah. Anyway, how far did you read to? We have three weeks before we have to be done with the whole section."
So he wandered to all the places they went to before and reminisced.
It was kind of off-putting to see his father act this way, but Scorpius was too out of it to even think of it that way.
"Oh," Draco added, his eyes shining happily, "if I remember correctly, Mother enjoyed telling me tales of how constellations came to be, and they were all ridiculous but I loved it. Usually, she'd tell me about dragons breathing fire into the sky and how my name's constellation was burned into the galaxy. It was either that about a thousand dogs managed to fly to the the moon and jumped off it to form the Canis Major. Oh, there was this one interesting one about how a dove's path of flight formed the dove constellation and another of how this one archer shot an arrow into the sky, and when the arrow exploded, the bits and pieces of it got stuck... All of the stories were ridiculous, but it was everything to me."
He hastily wiped his cheeks with his sleeve, storming out of the Room of Requirement and refusing to acknowledge the five of them as he passed by. The moment the door slammed shut, Pansy sicced herself on Harry.
"An audition is quite similar to Quidditch tryouts, but you don't need a broom or anything like that. A play, on the other hand, is a series of dramatic events you can put together to tell a story. It's sort of like a moving portrait, but we're outside of the portraits and we're in character anyways," Blaise informed stupidly.
The first time had been when he walked into this house, which Draco had been very proud to announce as 'his'. After all, everything was lightly decorated to give off a home-y and welcoming vibe. What Draco had been most pleased of, however, was the chandeliers that hung above them. It had taken him quite a bit of time to find the perfect one.
Draco glared at him.
"Are you sure?"
Within fifteen minutes, Potter was walking as well as Draco had when he was a child.
As Harry went through the crowd, he stopped by each child he saw and handed them one of the colorful flowers. The children giggled in delight and asked for help braiding them into their hair or pinning them down to their tunics. The parents of those children merely grinned at Harry and gave a mock salute to their leader before they kneel to do just that. The laughter and joy that Harry brought those children to his people…
“What was that all about?” Harry asked as he wiped mud from his pants. “Not quite the welcome I was expecting.”
"Let's start."
Harry's eyes flashed dangerously, but he obeyed. Draco must've struck a nerve because they didn't speak until they reached the Great Hall. But, even then, all Harry said to him was a coarse 'bye'. Curious and confused, Draco turned towards the Slytherin table, completely missing the way red-hot rage filled the atmosphere.
They saw him as the merchant responsible for Slytherin’s flourishing, the man who’d generously taken guardianship of his illegitimate son, the man who took in young men and women, nourished their talents, and sent them back into the world far more capable than they would have been without him. And, even worse, the man who gave lavishly to his church and community and was the model citizen they deemed him to be.
"Fireworks? What is there to celebrate?" Ron asked.
"Yes you did." "You did."
Draco, although he'd rather hang by his tie than admit this outloud, knew Granger was a witch of her word. If she said she would try to get Potter to stop bothering him, then she tried. Especially when it was her education-slash-grade on the line. Granger was a nerd, just like him. And as a fellow nerd, Draco could personally relate to the desperation she felt to ask him (of all people) to tutor her.
"Hey, do you think Snape will give us another day or two to complete our homework assignments?" Harry asked, leaning closer so only Draco could hear him.
"What's your favorite?" Harry asked, his voice no louder than a whisper. Draco's shoulders tensed. "Will you tell me? Please?"
Luckily, the gate wasn’t broken. Which was a good sign.
"Thanks, Draco. I'll make sure to grab two boxes the next Hogsmeade weekend."
The group quickly began running from the Death Chamber. On their way out, they were greeted by Remus, Draco's cousin Nymphadora, Professor Moody, and several other people. Draco had half the mind to hex Harry when he casually handed the prophecy over to them, but Harry tugged him away before he could actually do any damage.
Draco stared at him silently.
Imagine a cold, dark cave. You have lived there for your entire life. The only thing you can see is darkness, and the only thing you can hear is the sounds of your friends and mentors breathing beside you. Every once in a few days, a few people you don't recognize start talking and one of those friends or mentors are taken away from you. You fear you will be next. But then, you are told you are allowed to leave the cave. You don't need to, but you can. And when you decide to, you're terrified of what is awaiting you outside. You're curious to see what you find. And so, you take very slow steps towards the outside world.
He was surprised that Potter's eyes were firmly trained on the desk he was sitting at.
"Stop ignoring me," Potter huffed, grabbing Draco's forearm and yanked him backwards. He flew back, sure he would have landed on his arse if not for a Potter's casually strong grip. "God, that was not what I was trying to do."
"He's supposed to be here. Sirius was right..."
Draco smiled as he read the last words.
"Yeah," Potter agreed, the awkward smile from earlier returning. "I think it'll be worse this year though."
Harry took several deep breaths, leaning away from Malfoy and turning his head. Malfoy, on the other hand, stared at him stupidly.
"Draco, I mean that we'd like you
years old when you—"
A warning that Draco had to stay afterwards.
Harry only threw back his head and laughed.
Pansy huffed. "And you should beg me for mercy too. Honestly! The gall of this arrogant idiot!"
"What? Of course I'm not. Harry could be burning in hell right now and I wouldn't bat an eye."
He had looked around his small bedroom sadly after being woken up, eyes landing on his small pile of hand-me-downs from Dudley and mind wondering how he was going to carry them all in his hands when he was so weak and injured. He had contemplated sneaking into Dudley's room and just taking one of his stuffies or action figures, but ultimately decided against it.
Harry simply grinned but upon seeing Draco's barely concealed glare, he cleared his throat. "Alright. So you were saying I was right...?" He bumped their shoulders together, repeating the action Draco had done earlier.
Although Draco was confused about the last statement, he lost his nerve and Harry left the suddenly-very-cold room. He understood why Harry lit that candle then. And as the door closed behind him, Draco felt the familiar painful pull in his lungs intensify and accepted the bloody flowers straight-on. The flowers' exodus continued swiftly, and Draco wasn't exactly how long he puked bloody and flowers before he fell asleep.
Blaise growled, a sound of obvious frustration. "What about Hermione then? Why would she ask you if you’d like to borrow her notes?"
"... I think this should be a standard one-on-one duel, Draco. It really won't be fair if you have Hermione while I have... Blaise."
Draco had felt the same way about Greg and Vince.
"Are you trying to get him killed, Ronald?" Blaise asked, eerily calm. He was probably planning to call the cleanup crew after Ron's totally-unexpected murder. And, by the looks that everyone else was shooting the indifferent ginger, the rest of their friends was willing to help him.
"You would if I asked?" Harry asked.
Potter looked up from where he stood awkwardly, Weasley and Granger by his side. They seemed to be engaged in a heated argument with Draco's friends, who were staring at him in horror. It was then that Draco realized that he hadn't bothered to cast a cleaning charm and, thus, his clothes had a rather nasty red splotch on it.
Harry smiled at him awkwardly.
curse, what else could you be but absolutely 'pathetic'?
Malfoy's giggling was literal music to Harry's ears, and whatever it was that their professor said to him about laughing in the middle of an exam escaped his ears. All he wanted to do was make Malfoy giggle like that again, no matter how absurd and stupid and completely irrational saying another comment was.
Even though he knew his papa was alright— maybe a little weird in the head and ugly with the beard he refused to shave— he also couldn't help but be reminded that his papa had died.
"So?" Malfoy challenged. "Everything is embarrassing to you, isn't it?"
Harry grinned at that. "You're always so dramatic."
Draco's hand reached out and gripped Harry's shoulder before he could stop himself. His mouth opened to say
The crew laughed but kept rowing.
Draco bit the inside of his cheek. "Now that that's been cleared up, could I ask you a question of my own? Just before we head up to wherever your appointment is?"
"Clearly, you didn't see him play against Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff in third year," Pansy grumbled. Then she looked up, smiling. "This is it, right? The room we're meeting Draco and Harry in?"
Harry looked down guiltily. "Okay most of those things weren't my fault. I didn't know you didn't want me to be around you at all."
"Just... everyone's always looking to me like I'm Hermione and can pull answers out of thin air. It's either that or waiting to see me do something half-decent. And then the moment I don't, they tell me off and say I'm making everything up. Not to mention how if I even look at someone, we both make the front page of the Prophet and not in a good way. Well, it's never in a good way in my opinion. And it's— I'm just tired of it."
"Take one look at Draco. Take one at Blaise. You really think they would settle for each other?"
He swallowed. "Okay."
"Well, what are you waiting for, you idiot?" Pansy whisper-shouts. It's loud enough for Harry to hear and feel the disappointment beginning to pool in his abdomen. "He's waiting for you!"
Macmillian was just talking a minute ago.
Draco raised an eyebrow. "I thought Harry was the one to find me. He acted completely traumatized."
Draco rolled his eyes, swatting Blaise's hand away. "You're imagining it."
Draco couldn't hate the man in front of him when Sirius loves the person that he loves.
Harry nodded and did just that. As the Whisps popped away, Harry stared at Draco. "I don't think that I'll ever get used to having house-elves... What happens to them if I die?"
"So... did you help him during the Tournament?"
Harry stomped off. Draco's eyes burned with tears. His throat constricted and blocked any source of oxygen. Already weakened by his panic attack earlier, Draco's knees crumbled. Some random Muggle shook his shoulder roughly, talking about something called an 'ambulance'. And, right before his world completely faded, he could've sworn he heard Harry shouting his name.
Even though Vincent hadn't turned out alright in the end, he still couldn't help but think of him as the insensitive, puffed-up boy from so many years ago.
"And your tense posture suggests that you heard you won't be participating in any matches this year."
"Blaise!" Draco hissed. Blaise made a zipping motion over his lips. Pansy and Theo poorly stifled their laughter when Draco glared at them. "I don't need Blaise to protect me, but I wouldn't mind if he helped out. Just a little."
Harry gasped for air. "Did you see his face?"
"Wait, Pansy, Harry and I aren't—"
"Lacked in drama as well," Draco quietly added.
How and why the hell was he in this situation?
Potter's eyes were wide with disbelief, as though he's never heard anything Draco mentioned to him. "What the hell?"
After all, Harry was
Not that Draco really cared though.
"I bet you did." Draco nodded. "However, I want to. For all three of you."
And Potter, the prat, didn't help.
"What even goes on in that mind of yours?" Harry teased. "Are your thoughts really all that interesting?"
"Because your opinion matters, Malfoy."
Harry sprinted out of that damned bathroom like the goddamn wind was carrying him— there was no such wind, but the atmosphere felt tense enough that Harry just knew it was appropriate to be overdramatic. The weight of the guilt terrorized him like nothing else; the image of seeing the light in the grey eyes disappear haunting him even when he closed his eyes. The very thought that he may have murdered Malfoy— knowing or unknowing— made him feel cruel, heartless.
"Huh? Yeah," he replied. Harry's grin was worth getting ambushed by another hoard of cookies.
So on the one day Harry had to study for his Divination test with Weasley— he wasn't actually studying but it didn't matter to Draco— Draco politely addressed him and asked to speak to him in private.
Draco etched those words into his heart.
Draco looked at the bed and, truly, calling it a ‘bed’ was generous. It was a thin mattress made entirely of straw that’s covered in furs in an attempt to soften it, a small frame to keep it in place, and no pillows. Then Draco looked at the small floor space between the bed and the chest, noticing the splinters on the wood and the small dip where a plank bowed. Clearly, the bed was the more comfortable option.
Harry shuddered.
"Don't make me drop you, Draco," Blaise hissed. Just to prove how much of an asshole he is, Blaise let go of Draco's thighs. Draco shrieked and latched onto Blaise's backside.
was out there.
Theo snapped out of it, stepping aside when he realized he nearly crashed into another student walking in the opposite direction. "Nothing."
"Only this and Herbology," Draco replied.
"Do you think we shouldn't have told him about that?" Draco asked his husband. He set down his book, which he had pretended to read for the past twenty minutes to hide his worry for his son.
Bloody git ruined the moment. Draco scowled. "For the last time, Theo, that is most certainly not my name."
"So I do have to leave you here for a few hours. I hope I can trust you to be quiet and discreet," he said.
"Cuffs?" Fred and George both asked. "Kinky."
Harry smiled weakly. "So that's why you don't fight me anymore? On anything? You just felt like I was imposing myself on you and don't care anymore?"
Blaise snorted. "Alright. Well, I'll just be going to sleep. Don't wake me up when it's time for dinner. Merlin knows you might just drag me to the Great Hall as punishment for annoying you."
Indulge yourself with chocolate! Watch an episode of your favorite show! (Watch several if you're like me and you like to procrastinate) Put your pencils down or put your laptops away and take a walk! Even better: feed your pet/make baby noises at them!
"Git."
"And you're the wizard equivalent of a Niffler," Draco drawls. "Overly excited, attracted to shiny objects, and spends too much time with their face planted in the Pitch."
"I would've done the same," Harry replied. "I'm not sorry for offending him though. The only Malfoy I care about is you."
there even was one.
listen.” Steeling himself with a deep breath, Hermione continued. “Yes, Lucius used me and abandoned me for fun and, yes, that sucked. But it’s in the past. I’m over it. I’m happy with my life. As bad as things were in Slytherin for me, I wouldn’t undo any of it now if I had the chance. I needed for it to happen to have Ron come back into my life. He’s worth it to me and if I’m able to put what Lucius did behind me, then you need to let it go.”
'We' referring to him and Ron Weasley, of course. No superior would dare to add any paperwork to Hermione Granger, who had proven time and time again that she knows more hexes and curses than they do. Once, Harry'd told Draco, Hermione came back after a particularly difficult case to a mountain of paperwork and reports of Muggle sightings. She threw her resignation letter in Senior Cursebreaker Hennesy's face and demanded that he did some work of his own instead of expecting her to do everything. Not even a week later, she'd gotten her job back and a promotion.
"I don't know this! I can't write an essay on something I don't know."
Draco was a Death Eater.
"A surprise, you say?" Harry raised his eyebrow and glanced towards Draco. His husband of three years smirked, forcing him to look back towards their son for the answer. However, Scorpius wore an identical smirk to Draco's. Harry sighed and nuzzled his cheek into Scorpius's white-blondish hair. "You're becoming more and more like your papa every day, Scorp."
