"Yeah, he did." Harry didn't know what else to say.  Draco just nodded silently.  "Look, Draco, whatever happened between us before, I want you to know I don't hold it against you."
Harry followed The Lawyer out into the hallway, holding Draco's hand.  He caught up with him quickly and attracted his attention.
“Do not expect the courtiers to like you.”  Malfoy said.  He gave Harry a hard look.  “They will treat you with courtesy befitting a guest of the King, but in general they hate the English.”
“This allows admittance only for those who were touching the portkey at the time of travel.”  Malfoy explained.  “The doorway is warded against all others.”
"Thank you, Madam.  Minister, in your opinion, does this new evidence strongly suggest Lucius Malfoy's innocence?"
“Perhaps it is just as well she is neutered.”  One of the other ladies, Marie or Claudine, Harry didn’t know, observed as they all watched the little dog make quite an exhibition of rolling onto her back in front of the Wolfhounds.
Draco took a breath and stepped over to a cabinet in the corner.  “I am calm.”  He opened the cabinet and took three glasses out, placing them on the gilt top of the cupboard and unstopping a decanter of amber liquid.
“Quite, thank you, Sire.”  Harry thought of his hard landing on the stable floor.  “I’m pleased to be here.”
“I had letters to write.”  Malfoy’s tone was playful in a way it only ever was when speaking to his godfather.
Crabbe and Goyle had a similar colour scheme, but their shorts were longer and they wore t-shirts and trainers.  Most noticeably, all three had a strip of black material wrapped around their left wrists.  It was illegal to show the dark mark in public, but the tie made it obvious they all bore it.
Harry wasn’t sure that was what he wanted at all.  “I usually spend Christmas at Hogwarts, or with the Weasleys.”
Harry grimaced, he hated flashing his cash, it was a good idea though.  "Yeah, Greg and Vince suggested that I buy him something to show that I'm courting him." Harry groaned.  "Damn, Draco's not allowed off the school grounds during term-time, though."
Zabini drew his wand and began to trace an intricate pattern on the stone.  In its wake his wand left a bright white line that glowed for a few moments before fading.
Harry wasn’t sure how that constituted avoiding maiming anyone, at close range the curse could easily kill.  “Recanto!”  Malfoy snapped.  The green light that emerged from his wand met Zabini’s and enveloped it, leaving it to fizzle in the air without reaching its target or deflecting dangerously.  “Slugulus Eructo!”
Well, that explained it.  Harry felt anger curl in his gut.  How was it fair that Malfoy got to sit drinking tea in his godfather’s office while Harry had barely had time to know Sirius?  Harry clenched his fists in his lap.  When he looked up, Malfoy was regarding him with his most expressionless gaze.
Lady Florence snorted.  “Please, the scene he made was so pubic, it’s hardly a secret now.  I mean really, storming into the King’s council room and demanding to know whether it was the King or Lord Wiltshire who had started arrangements for his marriage.  As if he has the right to demand answers from His Majesty.  Not that the King was particularly involved, I don’t think.  Then the Little Cavalier says that he won’t marry Louise de la Fare, even though it would be such an advantageous match for him, and storms out again.  Apparently the Earl still isn’t speaking to him.”  The delight was clear in her voice.
“If you’re finished,” Snape drawled, “but yes, Miss Parkinson is correct.  Having a spell ready and cast before your opponent can complete theirs is one of the most important skills to have.  I hope you will all remember that in your own practice duels.  Now, I’m going to assign your partners, no swapping, no complaining.  Mr Malfoy, Mr Zabini, you’re dismissed.”  They left and Snape began to assign partners, in general, as was his habit, Slytherins and Gryffindors together.  Harry got Theodore Nott, which didn’t impress him.
“What kind of letters take the whole of dinner?  Couldn’t they wait?”  Harry couldn’t imagine any letter that would engross him to such an extent that he would miss a meal.
"Yeah, and so do Draco and Pansy, but I'm not really sure about it, and Blaise and Theo don't believe at all."
Harry snorted at the man’s coy attitude and skimmed the article in front of him in disgust. It was the usual unsubstantiated drivel about his fictional romance with Daphne, but unfortunately this time it was accompanied by a picture that did look distressingly like him proposing. The light from the camera’s flash glinted off the diamond in such a way as to disguise the fact that it wasn’t actually a ring.
"Yes, ma'am." The Malfoy family lawyer answered smoothly. "Defence calls their first witness, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Minister of Magic."
“And how have you been?”  He asked her as she pawed at his shoulders and licked his face.  “Have you been a good girl for your Mamma?”
“You don’t have to stay,” he told his bodyguards, “there’s no sense in you wasting your evening too.  Professor Snape is supervising detention in the classroom next door.”
“Voldemort doesn’t know what peace is.”  Harry replied.  “He’s being trying to kill me my whole life.  He tried to kill me when I was a year old, just because he thought I might grow up to be a threat.  He’s been trying to kill me ever since, even when I was just a child who couldn’t have hurt him.  And he’s insane now; even if he started out last time with a purpose and a political rhetoric, now he’s turned into a monster with no concern for whom he hurts.  He took such risks this summer just to try to kill me that he revealed himself to the Ministry,” Harry didn’t want to bring up the prophecy, “and even his most loyal followers have started to abandon him.  If he’s left you alone it’s because his attention has been elsewhere.  The moment he decides you pose a threat he’ll seek to destroy you, yes, so perhaps you might be reluctant to get involved.  But he’s unstable, so he could decide at any time that you’re a danger to him, or that for some reason you’re not worthy of living in the world he wants to create, and he’ll try to destroy you all anyway.  I’d say your best option is to get ahead of it, to make your stand while his attention’s still on securing the UK, so that you can work with those of us who are still resisting him there.”
Harry didn’t stop, he pushed his tongue into Draco’s hole and sucked. Draco’s hips came off the bed as he shouted Harry’s name. Harry grinned as best he could and went to work. When Draco had been loosened sufficiently and was a whimpering mess on the bed, Harry slipped two fingers in next to his tongue and stretched him. Draco moaned distractedly and bore down on his fingers.
Draco had asked him here?  Harry had thought it was the King’s own curiosity behind the invitation.  He swallowed.  He didn’t like the answer he was going to give, so he didn’t see why the King would.  “Well, in my opinion, Sire, there’s no point in accepting Voldemort’s terms.  He won’t keep his word, he likes to play games.”  Harry had found that out the previous year, to his cost.  “If you agree to form an alliance with him, he’ll probably kill Draco just to spite you.”
“Well why shouldn’t I have?”  Harry was getting irritated.  “Lucius Malfoy has been trying to do me harm for six years.  He gave Ginny a cursed diary.  He’s partly responsible for Sirius dying.  And Malfoy’s been treating me like shit since the day I met him.  Or have you forgotten the Inquisitorial Squad?  I’m not going to play nice with him all of a sudden now that his father’s got cold feet and his half-brother wants to have me over at Christmas.”
“If you have an interest in such things then I’m sure demonstrations can be arranged.”  Flosi offered.
“You two are going to be the highest on their list of targets.  There’s no point making it easy for them.”  Flosi explained.
Shocked, Harry whipped around to look at Malfoy.  “You’re not playing quidditch this year?”  He parroted.  “What’s wrong with you?”  Harry couldn’t imagine anything less than a life-threatening injury preventing someone from playing quidditch.
Then she extended her hand to Harry, and he bowed and kissed it too.  “Lord Dorchester, it’s so good to finally meet you.  We’ve heard a lot about you.”
It was a Thursday when Greg and Vince approached him.  Their wedding was approaching and they spent most of their weekends at home organising it, leaving Draco under the watchful gaze of Blaise,Theo and Pansy.  They cornered him in the common room.
“It’s really fascinating that you’re eligible to claim it at all.  Muggle peerages can usually only be inherited by blood relatives.  I don’t know why being a godchild is so important to wizards, it could have some magical significance, or it might just be a social convention, or one of those odd legal loopholes.  It’s one of the things I'm researching at the moment, actually.”
“I’m Florence de Rohan, and this is Charlotte Fouquet.”  She indicated the redhead.  “We’re Maids of Honour to Her Majesty.  She requested that we escort you to her rooms, so that she can show you the palace.”
Harry was early.  He had told himself it was because after rescheduling Quidditch trials to the next evening he had nothing better to do, but in reality he knew it was because he didn’t want to piss Malfoy off by being late.  He hung around in the corridor outside Snape’s office for five minutes until Malfoy showed up at seven on the dot.  As ever, he was flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.  He opened the door to the office and gestured Harry in ahead of him.
Whispers erupted throughout the Hall.  Some of the students, mainly Purebloods,  seemed to understand what they were looking at and soon the words Magical Submissive were floating through the Hall.  There was no other reasonable explanation for a Malfoy kneeling at the feet of a Potter.
Everything had been quiet for a week, classes had progressed as usual, homework had been done.  When Harry returned to the common room on Tuesday evening he heard music coming from his dormitory.  A throbbing beat and aggressive vocals permeated through the air.  Harry shrugged and settled to finish his potions essay, the music was muffled and didn't really bother anyone.
“He could establish a household of his own.”  Enghien agreed.  “Then no one would suspect he has any pretentions to royalty-”
Harry continued thrusting, his rhythm becoming less and less fluid.  Half of Draco's whimpers had become Harry's name, and the other half were most likely Master.  Harry felt his orgasm approaching quickly, he only just managed to allow Draco release before he was coming and unable to form coherent thought.  Warmth rushed through him, his muscles cramping as he emptied himself into Draco.
But all of Harry’s mental preparation, and all the coaching Draco and Snape had given him, were to be for nothing.  “Well, there’s no point drawing this out.  I want you to know that I’ve already made my decision.  We can't justify a costly and violent campaign in a foreign country.  I’m going to have let Britain resolve it themselves.”
"On your knees, baby." He murmured into Draco's ear.  There was something very erotic about ordering someone to their knees, the fact that Draco looked so vulnerable and innocent made it so much better.
One of her ladies nodded.  “There are things in life besides an advantageous marriage and a place on the hunt.”
Zabini smiled broadly, showing his teeth.  “So was I.”  Slughorn looked disconcerted this time.  Harry saw Malfoy plant an elbow surreptitiously in Zabini’s side.  Zabini continued, “But when I met her new husband earlier this year, he was quite charming.  Made his money on dragon hide stock, I believe.”
Harry had felt eyes on him throughout the Welcome Feast.  The other students were understandably curious about the reports they had heard over the summer concerning the Department of Mysteries and a prophecy.  The Prophet had begun referring to Harry as The Chosen One, which Harry viewed as an improvement from the previous year’s allegations of insanity, but it was still not particularly pleasant.  After all, Harry was only ‘chosen’ in the sense that Voldemort had chosen to believe the prophecy referred to him rather than Neville or any other child.  Harry fit two fairly generic criteria, born in July to parents who had defied Voldemort three times, but the aspects that singled Harry out particularly were dictated by Voldemort, not be anything specific to Harry.  Voldemort had marked Harry, as the prophecy promised, and Voldemort had some intrinsic failing that Harry would hopefully be able to exploit when they finally fought.  That was the only information the prophecy provided.  Harry thought that if the rest of the student population knew the limited extent of the prophecy, they would be significantly less interested.  So, probably, would Voldemort.
Grimauld Place quickly became crowded.  All of Draco’s cousins came: Flosi, Skarpheðinn, Ragnar, Gunnar, Grettir and Erik.  Harry was somewhat relieved to have them with him.  Flosi and Skarpheðinn were a welcome reminder of his time with Draco, and he knew that all of the Bjarnassons were as desperate to have Draco home safely as he was.  They were ruthless fighters in the raids and few pitched battles the Order had had with the Death Eaters.  Their father, Björn, came with them, as did their mother.  Eleanor was something of a revelation to Harry.  She was the image of Draco.  Suddenly he could see where Draco got his delicate bone structure, his huge eyes, his mournfully downturned mouth.  Where Lucius was broad and commanding, and Narcissa was pinched and haughty, Eleanor was warm and slight and controlled her unruly flock with soft words and poise.
“Do you think she’d know what it is?”  Hermione asked absently.  “Ok, so, as you know, Louis XVI was deposed in the Revolution of 1792.”  She wrote L16 1792 at the top of the paper.  “Then his son, Louis XVII was sort of the king for a couple of years, but it was during the Revolution and he was only ten when he died, so he wasn’t very important.”  She drew a line down from L16, labels it ‘son’ and wrote L17 at the other end of the line.  “Then there was the revolutionary governments and Napoleon Bonaparte, who declared himself Emperor.  Then after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 Napoleon abdicated and Louis XVI’s brother Louis XVIII was King until 1824.”  She drew another line form L16, looping it below L17 and labelling it ‘brother’.  She wrote L18 1824 at the other end.  “Then he died and his brother Charles X took the throne but he wasn’t very popular so he abdicated in 1830,” a “brother” line from L18 and C10 1830, “and a distant cousin, Louise Phillippe I, took the throne.  He wasn’t popular either so he abdicated in 1848 and Napoleon Bonaparte’s great-nephew was elected President, and then declared himself emperor.”  She draws a line for ‘cousin’ from C10 and labels it LP1 1848.
Harry moaned in arousal as Draco's body was revealed to him.  The smaller boy was completely naked now, and hard.  A beautiful flush coloured his pale skin and he quaked a little under Harry's gaze.  Harry stroked him gently, down his neck then chest, his stomach then finally his cock.  Dove whimpered under his Master's touch.  He'd never felt anything like it before.
Draco reached Harry and began to undo his belt. Harry lifted his hips for Draco to pull off his trousers and boxers, his cock sprung free and Draco closed his hand around it. Draco savoured this moment, first contact. Harry’s cock was heavy in his hand, slightly above average in size and swollen with blood. He kicked a leg over to straddle Harry’s knees and dipped his head to lick the tip before sinking his mouth onto it. Harry’s was thicker than any other cock he’d sucked, so he had more trouble deep throating than usual, and the angle was awkward. Draco shuffled until he resting on his elbows, hands brushing Harry’s hips. He could take more in at this angle, and Harry’s hand came down to stroke his hair in appreciation.
They looked through the rest of the house.  Another two sittings room, two conservatories, one for the morning sun and one for the afternoon.  They went upstairs.  The first floor was guest suites, the next held the master suite.  The bedroom looked out over the expansive grounds, the bed was massive with pale grey sheets and pillows.  Sheer grey, silk hangings were open around it.
Oh God, someone up there was definitely trying to make his life hell.  The Slytherins looked uncomfortable, they'd been avoiding a confrontation for weeks and they didn't want one now.
“They’re Irish Wolfhounds.”  Malfoy explained.  “They’re very friendly.  Well,” he amended, “when they want to be.”
“But you’re my employee, and it’s not like you can just switch jobs if my… advances make you uncomfortable, staying in this job is a condition of your suspended sentence.”
Theo, Greg and Draco, who were lying on Draco's bed, looked up in surprise.  Harry thanked Merlin that Blaise wasn't there, he was the most confrontational of the Slytherins.
Draco returned the smile and raised his eyes to meet Harry's, something he rarely did.  "I love you." He admitted softly.  "I think always have."
Harry entered.  The office was dark, but then it did belong to a Vampire.  Snape was sitting at his desk marking what looked to be essays.  He looked tired and defeated.  It was disconcerting for Harry to see his professor in this state.
“But Voldemort has not made any demands, Harry.  He has left us in peace.  You understand that we might be reluctant to break that peace.”  Lisette observed.
"Greg told me we could be good.  That we didn't need to get into anymore fights with the Gryffindors.  He'll be so disappointed."
Severus tucked a strand of blond hair behind Luc's ear.  "Don't worry, I won't let that happen to you.  I won't let anything happen to you." Vampires were extremely protective of their mates.
The King turned his gaze to Harry.  Harry began to mentally rehearse what he wanted to say in his head.
That was when a camera flash went off. There was more of a crowd gathering, all exclaiming and muttering and cooing. Harry looked around helplessly from his position on the ground before catching Daphne’s more composed eye. Daphne gave him a pointed look and then did the only thing a respectable young lady could do when apparently being proposed to by the wizarding world’s most eligible bachelor. She swooned into his arms.
“And can I demand a public apology if people insult me?”  Harry didn’t want to spend the whole holiday being on the receiving end of implied slurs.  If he wanted that he could go to the Dursleys.
Harry scrambled for the lube in the draw of the bedside table and wasted no time in slicking his cock with it. Then he pushed his lubed-up fingers back into Draco’s hole. Draco shook his head against the pillows. “Now, Harry.”
“We’ll probably need your help in coming up with a strategy to deal with this.” He admitted sheepishly.
“Of course it will help.”  Snape looked severe again.  “But you must also bear certain things in mind.  The King does not like flattery, so don’t waste your breath commending his virtues.  He is not a particularly religious man, so don’t speak to him of God’s will.  Don’t tell him about the Dark Lord’s evil, or all the innocents in danger.  Tell him only of his own gain, the safety of his people, the renown he will win if he delivers England safely.  That is the only way to win him.”
How did Draco look now, he wondered.  Was he still worn and worried, drained beyond his years?  Did he look worse now, after his time with the Death Eaters?  Or had he, by some miracle, made it out alright and found some peace and happiness in this house of God?  If there was anywhere Draco could find healing, it would be here, in this cold, beautiful place of prayer.  The informant who’d alerted the King to Draco’s whereabouts hadn’t said anything about Draco’s state of mind, whether he was traumatised by his captivity.  Harry didn’t know how long he’d been held before he’d escaped.  He didn’t even know if he had escaped, or if he’d been let go, or just forgotten somewhere after it became clear he was no use as a hostage.  Not every Death Eater had been sadist after all, plenty were genocidal blood supremacists without wanting to actively get their hands dirty.  There was a chance Draco had come out of his ordeal relatively unscathed.  Apart from the severed finger.  And the kidnapping, of course.
The two men glared at one another, Malfoy pale, broad and chiselled, Snape dark, tall and wiry.  It was Malfoy who looked away first.
“He taught my father when he was at Hogwarts.”  Luna interjected unexpectedly.  “Maybe the Headmaster has asked him to come back.”
"I didn't mean any offence, Master.  I know it's not my place to choose..." Harry cut him off with a quick kiss.
"Sustained. Please return to the matter at hand or finish with the witness, you've made your point."
Harry kissed Draco goodbye outside Snape's office.  Draco was going to spend sometime with Greg and Vince whilst Harry talked to Snape.  Harry had been ordered by the formidable Professor to visit after classes, so here he was.  He knocked on the door as Greg and Vince escorted the blond out to the grounds where they were going to spend the late afternoon.
Mr Potter was still rubbing his eyes and blinking, and had yet to put on his glasses, but he was awake enough to say “Thank you, Draco. And a cup of tea, if you’d be so kind.”
Goyle had just finished putting the car hood up and locking it.  He smiled over at her.  “Sorry, traffic.”
Harry lifted his head for long enough to murmur a quick "come" before he dived back down.  Draco's body went taught, before he came into Harry's mouth.
Zabini’s face contorted.  “You’re pathetic, Weasley.  I mean really, nine months in the womb and your mother ended up with you.  Jesus Christ, I bet she cries herself to sleep every night.”  He rounded on Harry, “And as for you, Potter-”
“You’re worried about your safety at Hogwarts?”  Harry thought that Hogwarts was the best place for Malfoy to be if he was being threatened.
“I’ll give you a clue,” Harry held his hand palm down by his waist, “they’re about this high, hairy all over, and they can rip a person’s throat out in about fifteen seconds.”
Harry nodded.  "Yeah, and you should have seen the way they treat Malfoy.  It's like he's made of glass or something.  They all look at him kind of... gently."
Harry didn’t know.  “He’d surely understand if you’re not ready for the intensity of Versailles after everything you’ve been through.”
The King hurried up behind them as Snape blasted the lock on the door.  He asked, “What’s happening?”  But no one answered him.
Neville looked pleasantly surprised.  "Seriously?  Nice one, Draco.  I didn't think you had it in you."
By the time Daphne arrived at the office, Mr Potter was happily ensconced in his office with tea and Draco and Pansy were settled back at their desks facing the work pen that housed the rest of the department. The rest of the department that erupted in whispers when their boss’s reputed fiancée arrived.
"They haven't done anything to me." The Minister continued to look disbelieving.  "Come on, Kingsley, you know I can resist the Imperius curse, and someone would have noticed and informed you if I suddenly started acting oddly."
"So, Harry, Draco told me you want to help Lucius, is that true?" The vampire looked at him seriously, though his tone was light.
This time it was Draco who stared at the young civil servant incredulously. “Then every pureblood housewife in the country gets up in arms about the breach of contract and writes to the Minister demanding your blood for how poorly you’ve treated one of their own, sir. Any traction you’ve gained in that set is completely lost, as are your hopes to reconcile old-world purebloods to the new order.”
“We do our best.”  Flosi replied.  “Come, cousin, it’s late.”  And before Harry had really registered McGonagall’s words, he had ushered Malfoy out of the room.
Draco gave his one-shouldered shrug.  “You’ve already won over the Queen, with her on your side it hopefully it won’t be too hard to convince the King.”
Luckily Malfoy had shown Harry a handful of card games in their lessons, and Harry had practiced Whist with him, Flosi and Skarpheðinn.  “Of course.”  He replied.
“That was no trouble either, sir. More serving my own interests, really. Won’t do me any good if I loose you. Work-wise, I mean, sir.” Draco knew that Mr Potter was too drunk to infer any other meaning from the sentence.
"You really want to humiliate him in that way?  I had hoped you could grow up enough to put your differences behind you."
"Hey Harry, I was just came to see how you were doing." She came and sat on the bed next to where Harry was sprawled.
Harry walked into the dormitory a while later to see Draco curled on his bed with a potions book.  Harry recognised the chapter as the one Professor Snape had told them to read.  Snape was still acting strangely and no reason had yet been found. There were rumours beginning to circulate that went from unlikely to ridiculous.  Some said that he had lost a lover in the war and hadn't got over it, which seemed far too romantic for Snape.  Others that he was suffering from a dreadful disease with no cure, unlikely for a vampire.  The other popular one was that it wasn't Snape at all but an imposter and the real Snape had died in the final battle, but that was impossible as a polyjuice potion needed the subject to be alive.  Whatever the truth was, the eighth year Slytherins seemed to know.  They were always exchanging meaningful looks in his lessons and Draco looked perpetually worried in his presence.
Finally Pansy spoke.  "I call the element of spirit into the circle to preside over this bond." Warmth flooded the room as the circle was completed, then Pansy continued.  "Draco, please make your oath."
Harry thought being deprived of quidditch was inhumane, although he expected nothing less from Lucius Malfoy.  “Couldn’t you just tell him to piss off?”
Malfoy snorted, and Snape gave him a filthy look.  There was no love lost between the two men these days.
Harry had indeed seen many dogs, and interacted with plenty of them.  He gave Ajax an obliging scratch and the dog extended his neck to give Harry more room.
“I don’t know,” Luna’s voice had become dreamy again, “all my father said about him was that he liked to collect well-connected or promising students.  I don’t think my father knew him very well.”
“That’s enough.”  Malfoy interrupted him, a hand on Zabini’s chest.  “I can’t deal with this right now, Blaise.  Weasley, pull yourself together, we’re not twelve years old anymore.  Let’s go inside.”
The Queen regarded him coolly for many long moments.  “You make your case well, and passionately.”  She said, and Harry blushed, realising he had been a little more enthusiastic than he intended.  “I happen to agree with you, although I do not like the idea of instigating violence.  Lord Voldemort is not simply a rival political force in Britain; he is a terrorist.  More than that, he is seeking to commit genocide.  There may be some even within this palace who have some sympathy with his politics.  I am not one of them.  I am unwilling to allow atrocities to be committed while I could try to stop them, even if they are on foreign soil.  If you wish to petition my husband to aid you in your cause, Harry, then I will add my voice to yours.”
“Blaise always lashes out when he’s upset.”  It sounded like it always had when Draco explained Blaise’s behaviour, part instinctual, part defensive.
Harry reached over and slid it open.  On the other side stood a nervous looking boy no older than third year.  He looked at Harry and held a slip of parchment out to him.  “I have a note for you from Professor Slughorn, and one for you.” He held a second slip out to Neville.
"We walk the line and try not fall off." Severus informed them with more confidence than he felt.  "We play at being good Death Eaters then go running to Dumbledore with the information he needs."
“Three little faggots,” Zabini said, his affectionate tone belying his words, nodding over at their bed with a fond smile.  “It’s enough to put a straight guy off his food.”
“You two can take your seats.”  Snape instructed.  “Now,” Snape addressed the room, “what did you notice about that duel?  Why do you think Mr Malfoy won?”  There was silence, the class was slightly stunned by the display they had witnessed.  Snape sighed.  “Anyone?”
"Thank you, it feels brilliant." Harry swelled with pride at the words and the happy flush on Draco's cheeks.
Pansy Parkinson raised her hand.  “Draco was faster, sir.”  Beside her Zabini elbowed her.  She punched him in the thigh.  Zabini winced and Malfoy snorted.  He looked more relaxed and envigorated than Harry had seen him all year.
“I’m sure their Serene Highnesses would love to have a small portrait of their first grandchild.”  Draco observed.  “Particularly if it’s as masterful as Bonnaire’s usual work.”
“They can’t hope to get to the King,” Harry motioned at a nearby guard, “not with all this security.”
“The whole thing was weird.”  Harry announced.  “Malfoy got all distant and formal when he was talking about the palace.  Like he was reciting information about people he’d never met.  The King’s his brother, you’d think he’d take it a bit more personally.”
Malfoy huffed.  “Anyway, Swan Lake is the story of a princess called Odette who is cursed by a wizard to be a swan in the day and only a human at night.  She lives on a lake with other cursed girls.  A prince called Siegfried falls in love with her, which is good because the only way for the curse to be broken is if she is loved by someone who has never loved before.  The prince vows to kill the wizard and free Odette, but then at a royal ball, the wizard’s daughter comes to him disguised as Odette and Siegfried proclaims his love for her.  When the wizard reveals Siegfried’s mistake, Siegfried runs to the lake and begs Odette’s forgiveness, but his mistake has doomed Odette to life as a swan.  Unable to live without Odette, Siegfried joins her in committing suicide by jumping into the lake.  The final scene is usually them ascending to heaven.”
Malfoy released the spell and helped Zabini to his feet.  Zabini winced as he touched the back of his head where he had fallen.  Malfoy brushed his hand aside and checked for damage himself.  There didn’t seem to be any blood, and Zabini muttered an ‘I’m fine’ to Malfoy, but Malfoy sent a wash of healing green light over the area.  Zabini rolled his eyes and nudged Malfoy’s shoulder affectionately with his own.
“Don’t muggles come and visit Versailles all the time?”  Harry asked absently as he examined the space.
Harry had stayed in the gardens until people had begun to leave for bed in the early hours, more to observe the Christmas Eve festivities than with any wish to partake in them.  He had barely managed to drift to sleep when a tremor ran through the walls and ceiling that shook him to the bone.  He shot to his feet as the palace continued shaking.  It was a feeling familiar to Harry from the assault on Hogwarts.  Versailles was under attack.
, ridiculous fantasises of being a father at seventeen aside. He was just really, really hot, and really – oh Merlin,
“You’re the most important person in the world to me,” Harry whispered, hoarsely. “I couldn’t bear the idea of leaving you. I couldn’t bear the idea of you being hurt, or killed. I would have done
), well, then, he was going to make damned sure Draco was happy for every single minute they had left.
Harry laughed. He was hardening again, which was probably making it difficult for Draco to concentrate, but he couldn’t help it. “Focus,” he said. “You know how to reach across the bond. You did it when you created the sanctuary. You just have to –
Draco shrugged. “You didn’t see him in the aftermath, each time. It frightens him, Pans, whatever it is. I want to trust him.”
Draco cried out and came, wet warmth soaking the front of his robes. It triggered Harry’s own orgasm, and he shook through it, eyes closed and forehead resting against Draco’s. When the aftershocks finally faded, he found Draco taking his weight, arms around his waist. They were dry and warm. Draco had cleaned them up.
, Malfoy.” It felt like everyone in the school by now knew someone who had lost family or friends in Voldemort’s vicious guerrilla war. “I like you. I’m attracted to you. I want to date you. Fuck the war. Come with me to Hogsmeade?”
He got bored, after a while, and wandered up to the castle. He didn’t know where he was going until he was actually standing in the infirmary, his hand on the door to the quarantine room.
Draco rolled up onto his knees, straddling Harry’s waist. His eyes were bright. “Mine,” he said, bending to kiss him, and Harry opened up for him, smiling as he heard
It was incredibly satisfying, to reduce Draco to this; shallow, panting breaths and helpless lust. Harry dropped his wand, ripping Draco’s robes apart. He knew where all the buttons and clasps were now, the seams and folds, the weakest parts of the fabric to tear. He thrust his knee between Draco’s thighs, forcing them apart, and slipped his hand inside Draco’s tunic, dipping between his cheeks and searching for that hidden place that was his and
“Most people can’t do any wandless magic,” Ron said. “Even non-verbal magic is difficult, which is why they’ve been pushing it so much this year.”
A bright flash came from the window. The concussive blast went right through Draco. He staggered, and Greg caught his arm, steadying him.
He was so calm, Draco thought, even as his own heart beat a terrified staccato in his chest. It reminded him of that moment in the Great Hall, when Harry had turned his face up to the storm, and the storm had reached out to him in return. The Dark Moon Ritual had been so close to succeeding. What if Harry was already lost?
“Then you are aware of the potential risks,” Dumbledore said, simply. “Has it occurred to you that Mr Malfoy could be using you to discover our secrets and pass them along to Lord Voldemort?”
it; wanted to please his Alpha, to have a visible, permanent symbol of his Alpha’s ownership on his skin. To show the world, yes, but more than that, he wanted evidence that he was
on those oft-sanctimonious faces… that was sweeter than honey and cream cakes for breakfast on Christmas morning.
“Nature is all about balance; symbiosis,” Draco explained. “And we are born of nature. Always in pairs, maintaining the balance of the elements. Dark and Light. Earth,” he touched his stomach, then Harry’s chest, over his heart, “and Air.”
Dumbledore sighed heavily. “I didn’t want to tell you so soon. In fact... but of course there is never a right time to tell someone something like this. Harry, my dear boy, for Voldemort to die,
“Stop,” Malfoy said, his voice calm even though his pupils had dilated as soon as he'd entered the room. Harry froze, hand outstretched, his whole body vibrating. “I saw you looking at me in DADA, Potter. You couldn’t tear your eyes away. You want me.”
, Poppy,” Snape snapped. “I have no intention of harming anyone. Dumbledore spoke the truth when he said I was operating under his orders, the night of the Death Eater incursion. I am –
Harry scowled. “I agreed that when I was ‘being a martyr’, you could override my decisions about my medical care, but Draco, you didn’t even give me a chance to
Scrimgeour smiled. “I have a feeling I know what it is,” he said. “If this is to be my first and last term as Minister for Magic, I intend to undo the harm I caused, however unintentional. Stan Shunpike and the others will have their cases re-heard by the Wizengamot. I give you my word.”
Draco’s eyes widened slightly, and he made a move as if he might step back. But, “I don’t want to die, either,” he whispered instead, eyes searching Harry’s.
Daphne coughed delicately and brought her mirror up to cover her face. Pansy very deliberately pressed the heel of her shoe into Daphne’s toes until she yelped, and Professor Trelawney blinked at her in surprise.
A Death Eater leapt over the crawling bodies of the inferi, shooting at Madam Pomfrey. She countered it even as she kept up the shield around her charges. She was moving patients on beds into the quarantine room now. The scrape of the metal against the floor added to the din.
“The new Head of the Auror Office,” Hermione whispered, urgently. “Gawain Robards. He replaced Scrimgeour when he stepped into the Minister’s office. Apparently he has a background in wizarding law. I shouldn’t have worried – if he’s in charge of the prosecution, maybe I should –”
Harry sighed, subsiding. “It’s Dumbledore,” he said. Two blank expressions met his words. “Draco’s target. It’s Dumbledore.”
Dumbledore shook his head. “Harry, you must see I cannot discuss this with you. Not while you are potentially compromised by your feelings for the young man in question.”
“I’ve never heard of this Room of – what did you call it?” Cardosa said, angrily. “I was here seven years! No one ever said anything about a secret room! No one ever put wards like
“We won,” Harry echoed. He relaxed cautiously, turning his head so he could see her properly. “Where’s Draco? What happened?”
“The Time-Turner you ‘borrowed’ from me to give to Mr Malfoy,” McGonagall explained. “It appears Mr Weasley borrowed it from him, and used it to dig up the Resolution Potion.”
. By hiding parts of yourself from him, even with the intention of protecting him, you were denying him those basic rights, forcing him to make do with only the limited outward signs of the emotions you hid from him; fear, pain, grief, hunger. Love.” He sighed. “That may not be all your fault, of course, if the bond is damaged in some way. But it cannot change the fact that your souls are connected, and you must respect that. You are
He couldn’t bring himself to stand, so he had to crawl. But he made it, and he stripped off his robes and his trousers, leaving only his shirt as he slipped between the clean, soft sheets. It was
“Actually, you will both be staying for several hours, at least,” she said. “That was harder on you than I thought it would be. I want you to sleep. Your friends can wait.”
It was well past midnight when Harry dropped to his knees, trembling and exhausted. He lifted an arm to wipe the sweat from his forehead, and couldn’t quite manage it. Instead, he leaned forward to rest his forehead on the couch, groaning. Draco was already sitting on the floor with his back to the couch, his legs splayed out inelegantly in front of him, and he slid slowly sideways into Harry.
under the influence of something. It’s the only explanation.” He felt relieved and yet, somehow, disappointed. “We should get you back to school, take you to see Madam Pomfrey –”
Ron just shook his head, bewildered, but Hermione thought she was beginning to have an inkling. Her eyebrows rose. “You don’t mean…?”
Bellatrix levitated the boulder off him and sent it flying back at Dumbledore. Dumbledore waved his wand. The boulder exploded into dust. With the same wand movement, he hit Bellatrix with a spell that caused her to stagger, looking dizzy and pale.
Draco sighed, shivering as Harry latched onto the mark he’d made on his skin days ago. He had yet to heal it, and Harry was determined to keep it there for as long as Draco let him. “Who could blame me?” he said, wriggling for no other reason Harry could discern than the pleasure of feeling Harry’s cock inside him. “You’re bloody amazing.”
“Maybe what we need is another interview, telling your side of the story,” Hermione suggested. “We could ask Luna if her dad would write it up, this time.”
For the first time, Ginny saw that cool Slytherin façade crack slightly. “I’m sorry,” Pansy said. “I don’t have a choice.”
Harry tried to sit up without thinking, and jerked back against Draco’s restraining hands. He subsided immediately, wriggling a little to enjoy the feeling of being pinned under his Alpha; warm, naked skin sliding against his.
“Exactly,” Dumbledore said. “Fear of death has ever been Voldemort’s weakness. It is not yours. The Resurrection Stone is a dangerous conceit, much like the Mirror of Erised, but I want you to take it with you, when you go to face him for the final time. I believe it may bring you some measure of comfort.”
George heard a high-pitched squeal. Then another. House-elves were trying to block the gap with their own bodies. “
“That’s Dumbledore talking,” Draco said, grimly. “It’s not sacrificing yourself if there’s another way. Even if it poses a risk to me. A risk I am
The door to the Room of Requirement appeared instantly. Malfoy yanked it open, scowling. “You wouldn’t dare!” he said. “Anyway, you have no proof.”
Draco stared at him. He’d always known Dumbledore was a cold, calculating bastard. Harry knew it too; he’d acknowledged it openly, in fact. But despite that, and as incomprehensible as it seemed, Harry had always trusted the Headmaster to do the right thing by him. The
“According to Miss Parkinson’s report, he cast the Killing Curse at Dumbledore,” Kingsley said. “You were there, Mr Malfoy. Are you saying that’s not what you saw?”
The little bell on The Three Broomsticks’ door rang loudly in the silence. Draco’s arms prickled. Why was it so bloody
.” The lights went out, leaving only the soft glow of the dying fire. He settled back with a huff, and closed his eyes, only to open them again in surprise when he felt the soft press of lips against his.
“No,” Bill interrupted. “You-Know-Who used blood magic.” He was holding himself upright with obvious difficulty, but he’d managed to draw a revealing rune on the nearest pillar. Behind him, Molly was waving her wand desperately over Fleur, tears running down her face. Arthur was still out cold; maybe dead. Their son Percy was undoubtedly dead. “It’s over.
Potter caught his hand. “Let me?” he asked. His palm was soft and warm around Draco’s, fingers gentle as he pried the vial out of his hand. “
“Well, that won’t be you,” Harry said, taking Draco’s hand. “Come with me into the Forbidden Forest?” Draco made a face, and Harry tightened his grip. “It’s safe, Draco. I wouldn’t take you there if it wasn’t. There’s a faerie ring around the whole glade.”
He saw Malfoy’s hand move involuntarily, as if to cover his left sleeve. Not that it mattered; Harry knew what was under there already. “You can’t know that,” Malfoy whispered.
Ron shut his mouth with a snap, sitting back. He might not be the most sensitive friend, but he knew when he’d pushed too far. “Sorry, mate,” he offered.
Draco looked at him in surprise. “I’d offer to teach you, but I’m afraid it’s not something that can be learned. It’s a product of birth, and a long, long line of Dark ancestors. The Malfoys are not to be trifled with. Only the very foolish forget that.”
“The rose bushes were a bit different,” Draco said. “But essentially, yes. Except that it wasn’t my magic you used, either time. It was the Wild Magic, channelled through me.”
Draco tried to frown at him, but he could feel the smile pulling at the corner of his mouth. “Why are we here?” he asked.
Draco smirked. “I don’t think he appreciated my language, but he acknowledged my point, at least.” The gargoyle creaked to a stop, and Harry fumbled for Draco’s hand again, holding on tightly. Draco’s smirk softened. “Everything’s going to be fine, sweetheart.”
Draco looked at it, remembering how Weasley had stopped Harry from accepting his hand of friendship, so long ago. Then he looked at the ginger menace. He nodded, his blue eyes grave.
Harry shrugged and took one. It was interesting; ice-cold, as advertised, and seemed to disintegrate into gently-fizzing bubbles in his mouth. “Nice,” he managed to say, as the bubbles popped and slid sweetly down his throat. “Thank you, sir.”
Draco nodded at his mother cautiously, and Harry’s heart leapt into his throat. Narcissa glided forward, bending to kiss his cheek, and Harry tried to struggle away. But Snape’s grip on his arms was implacable, and Harry whimpered, closing his eyes and bracing for the inevitable onslaught of his heat.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. He shifted, avoiding her eyes, and she was conscious of a sudden, cowardly urge to run away. But she owed it to Harry to let him say what he needed to say, and then maybe it would finally be over between them. “Listen, Gin. About everything, this year. I’m really sorry, you know?”
Ron looked at her and winced. “Oh,” he said, apologetically. “I don’t, uh, actually know much about it. It’s not like other branches of magic. It’s just too rare. There’s reams of fiction about it, of course. Mum’s always reading one, sniffing about true love and ‘compatible souls’, but that’s just romantic crap. What I do know is that most of the scholars reckon a wizard’s core of magic
“Oh,” Harry said. He still wasn’t clear on what, exactly, Malfoy wanted to know, but he tried. “You’d just walked into the pub?”
Harry stared down at his clenched fists. “How did you know Voldemort would return? I know people never quite believed he could be gone, but you knew, didn’t you? Draco’s right. You knew about the Horcruxes. You knew about me. Right from the beginning. Why didn’t you
. Draco jerked sideways, slamming his hip into the banister. A Death Eater had almost Apparated in on top of him. “
But Malfoy was quick, even as tired as he was. A shield deflected Harry’s hex, and Harry had to dive to the side to avoid it. Malfoy flung another hex at him, this one without a flash of light. One of the three invisible spells in their homework that week.
Snape spared her a curt nod before setting off to Hogwarts at a brisk pace that was all but a run. Harry hurried to catch up. “Don’t you have better things to do with your time, Potter?” Snape said brusquely, when he realised Harry was still at his side.
, he told himself immediately. Of course Draco wasn’t with her. He wasn't even in the castle right now. He'd probably gone home, to Malfoy Manor, but that was just a guess. Harry hadn't asked anyone, and no one had volunteered the information. He thought maybe Madam Pomfrey had discouraged it. They were all walking on eggshells around him, as if he might shatter at the slightest provocation. Maybe he would.
Potter shook his head. “You don’t need to thank me. All I did was move the crowd back so Snape could get through. It was Hermione, really, who you ought to thank.” His lips twitched. “You know, your ‘favourite Mudblood’.”
“Not so very long ago, my dear boy, I would have believed you unreservedly,” Dumbledore said. “But your feelings for Mr Malfoy, and what they have led you to do – breaking rules for no other reason than selfish gain,
Draco swung around to help his friends. He froze. Greyback was rising slowly to his feet, yellow eyes barely a foot from Draco’s. Powerful hind legs crouched in readiness for a leap.
Miffy nudged him with a sharp elbow. “Harry Potter loves Master Malfoy. Miffy has seen. Dobby has seen.” A single tear slid down her cheek. “It is Kreacher’s duty to help Harry Potter, now.”
Draco flinched. “No, it's not – I didn't lie, exactly. I just didn’t tell them the whole truth.” Harry just glared at him, and he shook his head. “You’re an Omega, Harry. No one respects Omegas; not as witches and wizards in their own right. If the public knew I helped you – even in the small way I did – all they’d see is your Alpha. They’d talk about it like it was
“You call Muggleborns Mudbloods,” Harry pointed out. “If the Wild Magic chooses us, it doesn’t even make sense.”
They Apparated back to Hogsmeade, then borrowed broomsticks from the shadowy proprietor of the Hog’s Head to get back to Hogwarts as quickly as possible. Arthur hurried along on foot behind them with those who couldn’t fly; Ollivander, who was too weak to even get a leg over a broom, and Narcissa, levitated unconscious and feverish in front of them.
!” Pansu cried. It was a simple counter to most Dark shields, but it wasn’t taught at Hogwarts, because it was Dark. Bellatrix wasn’t expecting it. The shield fell, and Pansy followed it with another
Voldemort had survived without a body for ten years; just his maimed soul floating around in the ether until he found something he could possess. What if the Horcruxes could survive without a living host, too? What if, in trying to get it out, Harry’s Horcrux possessed one of his friends? He couldn’t risk Draco’s life, or Ron and Hermione’s, on what ifs. They had to know everything Dumbledore knew,
Lunch was largely uneventful, with the exception of Snape’s increasingly odd behaviour. He was affectionate in a way that had Mr and Mrs Malfoy raising eyebrows at each other even as they indulged him, and Harry wondered uncomfortably if Snape had needed this all along, to touch and
,” Bellatrix cackled, but she sounded very far away, now. “Do you know, I’d almost forgotten I took Black from you? And now the elf!”
There was no fanfare, no warning of their arrival. One moment Harry was watching the professors raise the boundary wards, and the next there were hundreds of black-robed Death Eaters outside the front gates. Just standing there; still, silent, like a mirage, the shadows of several huge giants looming in the distance behind them. He stared. That many Apparitions, all at once should have sounded like gunfire, or the climax of an enormous fireworks display.
“Clearly you are an exceptional young lady, Miss Granger,” Madam Primrose said, gently. “Would that there were more like you. Unfortunately, the wizarding world is at war, and we cannot afford such naiveté right now. The Death Eaters do not know compassion, or respect for life.”
“To hell with that!” Dawlish said forcefully, stepping up beside him. “I’m coming with you. I’ve already lost one partner this week. I won’t lose another.”
“Why not?” Hermione shrugged. “She said I could. She’s really quite nice, you know, when she’s away from Malfoy and his crowd.”
“How?” Harry asked. “Hermione’s unconscious in the infirmary, and Draco will never help me once I tell him the truth.”
Draco jerked backwards, almost knocking his chair over. The other patrons of the pub looked up at the noise, and he glared. “What the fuck is
Okay, so Harry was self-aware enough to admit that that was just the fancy of an overactive imagination. Justin was right. He was a boy, and he was attracted to boys. Not girls. But... he just couldn’t see any other feasible way of making this insane plan of Parkinson’s
Draco deflated. “Oh.” Then he frowned. “But you still gave yourself up to Voldemort, knowing that. Why?”
Harry sighed, turning in Malfoy’s arms. “I want to hear that you’ve come to your senses and will accept my offer of protection. You know I’d keep my word to protect your parents, too. I just want you
, Potter. You know that. I know you do, Merlin knows how.” He turned away, shoving his fingers through his hair. His voice was thick. “Cardosa showed me a memory of Greyback in her bedchambers, standing over her – her body. I don’t even know if she’s alive right now.”
, of all people, battling tirelessly against the curse to stop the drain of Hermione’s magic from her body.
need an Alpha. Your heat will last for several days, and your need will only grow stronger.” Harry nodded; he could feel the truth of that in his bones. “I can offer you only this: Professor McGonagall is in the process of inviting any male Alphas who are interested and of age to congregate in the infirmary outside. One of them may be – will very
He didn’t blame her. His own dreams had been haunted by that pale, gaunt face slashed with red… the ugly white of bone shining through the blood still pulsing from his leg… the involuntary spasm of muscles wracked by torture… his pitiful little cry as Snape lifted him in his arms…
Harry frowned. That was a good point. “I don’t know,” he said. “Maybe Dumbledore decided it was too awful to tell us? It’s not like Draco would win in a fair fight.”
Pansy stared at her. “So I just look into this Infinity Mirror and I’ll be able to see the outcome of any choice that must be made? It’s that simple?”
He pressed his hands into his eyes. It was that or scream. “Why,” he said, through gritted teeth, “have I never heard of them, then?”
They found a couple of Aurors sheltering in the Time Chamber. They had survived by creating a time loop with the residual time magic in the room. But there was no one else, on either the ninth or tenth floors, even though it seemed the tenth had been spared the worst of the Fiendfyre.
“But your magic was still there, even if you weren’t aware of it,” Pansy pointed out. “You might have a better idea than us how it is to live without being able to perform magic, but you can’t possibly imagine what it would be like to have it suddenly
Draco disappeared after dinner, taking Vince with him. Greg, unfortunately, had failed an assignment and had been forced to spend the evening doing it over. Pansy guided him through the theory absently. She had never quite appreciated the extent of Draco’s patience until he could no longer tutor the two boys himself; she did it for him now with good grace, because it was one of the few ways she could help him, but it was frustrating and time-consuming.
Harry relaxed slightly. “Fine. Good. You don’t have it,” he said, just to be clear, “and you never will. Come on, Draco.”
Draco just laughed quietly. They were sitting under the huge beech tree by the lake with Ron and Hermione, taking a break from the reconstruction of Gryffindor tower. Harry was sitting between his Alpha’s legs, leaning back into his embrace, Draco’s arms wrapped around his waist possessively. Much the same way Hermione’s hand was wrapped around Ron’s wrist as he lay sunning himself, in fact, and that made something warm expand inside Harry’s chest. His friends had always had such a stable relationship. Even when they fought (and they
On Saturday, Harry was given a clean bill of health from Madam Pomfrey. Since he’d flatly refused to step foot in the infirmary, she’d been scheduling daily appointments in her own quarters, next door.
He slipped his hands under Draco’s robes, pushing them up, touching and stroking and finding the places that made him shiver and cry out. He found the clasps, the buttons that held the intricate pureblood robes together, and began to undo them, clumsy but determined.
out of you. And I think we should enlist Draco’s help. He’ll know where to start. He might even have access to resources the Order doesn’t.”
He was pretty fucking determined that Greyback would never get within twenty feet of Draco, let alone hurt him. He just wished he could make the same vow for Narcissa. Unfortunately, that was up to Draco, and Draco was too scared to let him share that burden yet.
“Very well,” Scrimgeour said. “I’m sure you’re wondering why I’ve asked to talk to you.” He put deliberate emphasis on ‘you’, and his eyes passed over Draco and then away, clearly dismissing him. Harry bristled. “There has been a serious accusation levelled against you, and you have confessed to a crime which would have normally had you slapped in Azkaban with the merest trappings of a trial.”
It was incredibly arousing, knowing that Draco was desperately fighting the urge to push Harry’s head down, gag him on his cock. He couldn’t help himself, rubbing his own cock against the sheets as he sucked his lover off. It was a long, slow orgasm, rippling through Draco minutes later, and Harry came himself as he swallowed the salty, bitter fluid, shuddering with pleasure.
But Draco was true to his word; he took his time, drawing it out, letting Harry have a teasing hint of what was to come and then easing back, tormenting him with a hard thrust and then giving him minutes of nothing but the gentlest grinding motion. He added another finger when Harry was crying out and humping the air, desperate for
He watched, horrified, as Dumbledore fell again, but this time – his face changed. The path unfolded, and he grew cold, and hard. Torture, death; he didn’t flinch from it. The Dark Lord murdered Harry in cold blood, and Draco dumped his body outside the Manor’s wards, as if he was nothing more than rubbish to be disposed of. His mother pleaded with him, hand on his arm. Draco raised his wand. A green flash.
“Mirrors,” Professor Trelawney said dreamily, floating out from behind a curtain. Pansy folded her hands in her lap, carefully controlling her excitement. “They are the reflection of your very Soul, my dearest children. The means to see a future that is
“Mate. Yes,” Harry agreed, pressing a kiss to the corner of Draco’s mouth. It was pleasantly cool against his burning lips, and he lingered there for a moment, closing his eyes, just enjoying the closeness. And if it was also a sure-fire way to divert Draco's attention away from his friends... well, that was just an added bonus. Really, he knew they meant well, but he was exhausted and too hot and slightly lightheaded, and he couldn't deal with an argument (read: pissing contest) right now.
He studied Draco now, frowning. He still looked tired and worried, with dark circles under his eyes, but his sunken, pale cheeks had filled out, and had colour again, and his robes couldn’t hide how much
Voldemort smiled. “I just want to know about the other Hallows, Dumbledore. That’s all. Nothing so very terrible. Nothing that could possibly warrant the torture of one of your precious Order members, surely?” He turned the Elder wand on Dumbledore again, lifting the spell keeping his jaw clamped together. “Well?”
He didn’t want to risk feeling him out through the bond. He didn’t even know if it was possible, with a future version of him. And if Draco became angry; if he shut it again –
Harry snorted. “Yeah, no kidding.” He turned to pace the distance up and down the hall. The door to the Room appeared, and he held out a hand. Draco just wrinkled his nose at him, which was sort of ridiculously endearing, and Harry grinned. He waited patiently, and Draco relented after a moment, letting Harry take his hand and lead the way into the Room. Harry shifted to one side immediately, to make sure Draco’s first view of the room was unobstructed.
"Sorry, sometimes it gets difficult to balance out my personality.  Part of me wants to make sarcastic comments and whine until I get my own way, but the other part of me just wants to serve.  Sometimes I say something I don't mean, or want to say something but feel I shouldn't."
Tears were falling freely down Draco's cheeks now, but he nodded quickly.  "Yes, Master.  I'll take whatever punishment you want to give me, Master."
Vince laughed.  "Goddess, yeah.  Greg and I aren't getting married until Christmas and I'm terrified already."
Harry hurried to follow, barely able to tear his eyes away from the intricately carved statues.  As he followed Malfoy, one of the statues stepped out into his path.  Malfoy stopped abruptly and bowed.
Harry did consider it.  He considered it all evening and all of the next morning, through breakfast and Potions with Slughorn and Charms with Flitwick.  He was still considering it at lunch, when Ginny sat next to him and followed his gaze over to the Slytherin table and Malfoy.
“I’m sure he wouldn’t have objected to the match if it had been with, perhaps, Antoine de Choiseul.”  Lady Charlotte was almost beside herself.
Harry got out the larger box and opened.  Draco looked at the two pieces with wides eyes.  Wordlessly Harry clipped the bracelet around Draco's wrist and watched as it shrink to fit.  He motioned for Draco to turn and pulled his loose hair into a ponytail, clipping it onto place with the clasp.
They were pushed unceremoniously into their room by who Harry later guessed were Greg and Vince.  Once inside things seemed to solidify again.  Harry had a dazed looking blonde in his arms, blinking up at him with shining grey eyes.
Greg snorted in disbelief.  "Right, we hate muggles.  That's why I drive a muggle car which Dove's dad gave me for my birthday."
"I could do whatever I want to you now, you know that right?" Harry said slowly, considering.  "You wouldn't be able to stop me.  But I bet you love that idea, don't you?"
They were approaching the centre of the semi-circle, and ahead of them on the left a corridor opened up leading further into the stables.  On the right the arches ended and there was an arched doorway.  The doors were closed and there was a circular opening where the keyhole would normally be.  Malfoy took the portkey from within his robes and slid it into the opening.  The lock clicked and the doors began to swing open.
“But you find everything interesting, and I don’t know how you keep it all in your brain.  Anyway, who did the wizards keep as their king?  And why would they want a king if the muggles didn’t?”
Louis didn’t pay his stepfather any heed.  “It only seems fitting that he stays, given that it was Draco who requested he came here.  And I want to hear what Lord Dorchester has to say.  After all, he knows the Dark Lord best.  What would you suggest, Dorchester?”
Today the courtship would start properly.  Harry had to prove he could be the dominant partner.  That meant giving him orders as well as physically dominating him.  The former he was pretty sure he could handle, but the latter posed a little more of a problem.  How could he dominate Draco without taking it too far sexually.  After all, Harry had read in his research that if a submissive was 'used' (the term the book used) before they had been claimed then it made claiming them impossible.
Draco emerged from the shower freshly washed and dressed.  Harry was finished dressing and turned to Draco.
“And what does the rest of this contingency plan involve.  Me and Malfoy hiding in here while everybody else does the fighting?”
“Harry,” Malfoy said, “this is Henri, the Duc d’Enghien.”  Malfoy indicated and tall, fair young man in his late teens.
“I hoped that having the girls here, rather than confined to their families’ homes, would allow them to broaden their horizons, and dissuade their parents from arranging hurried marriages for them.”  She cast her eyes over at the girls by the window.  “It has been successful in some cases, though less so in others.”
“To trap you, Sire.”  Malfoy stated baldly.  “He hopes to strike a decisive blow before you can think to resist him.”
“Excuse me, Friar,” Harry said, hoping his translation spell would hold up, “can you perhaps help me with a small matter.”
Harry laughed.  "Bright's definitely the right word - for the whole house really.  I think it's about the same size as Malfoy Manor, but the decor is very different.  I'm glad you like it so far, it where you'll be living after school if we bond."
Hermione looked at him disbelievingly.  "You mean aside from having a personal slave?” Harry nodded.  “Their magic gets multiplied by a factor ten.  Submissives are really powerful, despite the fact they get treated terribly by the wizarding community.  No wonder Crabbe and Goyle want to keep this quiet."
“I doubt,” Harry interjected, nerves twisting his stomach at joining this heated debate, “that his Majesty wishes to be remembered as the king who abandoned his own brother.”  Harry remembered what Draco and Snape had told him about the King’s ego, about his temper and his lack of compassion.  Perhaps this was the only way to get him to see sense.
Harry wandered through to the common room and found Hermione there, and also Pansy Parkinson, who was presumably waiting for the Slytherin boys.  The girls were sitting on opposite sides of the room and ignoring one another.
“I have a letter for you.”  For the second time that day, Harry found a piece of parchment being held out to him.
"Hey, Malfoy." This time it was a fifth year Slytherin.  "How come you're walking?  Shouldn't you be crawling on the floor like the animal you are?"
Snape looked between Harry and Draco.  “The most important thing is that neither of you appear at all displeased with the King.  He doesn’t take well to being questioned or second-guessed.”
“No, sir.” Draco replied before Daphne could. “Anything Daphne says will be checked with her parents before it’s published, no one wants to get on the wrong side of the Greengrasses. No, unfortunately in this case Daphne’s actions will speak louder then her words.”
The Queen picked up the ruby Cavalier King Charles that had been sleeping on her lap since Harry had entered the room and put it on the floor.  It grumbled and stretched, blinking its bulging eyes.  It was clear that Lady Florence or whoever had come up with the nickname for Malfoy had not had to look far for inspiration.  Then the Queen stood.
Beside Harry, Ron flinched.  “Protego!”  Zabini threw up a barrier and the curse bounced harmlessly into a wall without anyone vomiting slugs.  “Lycacomia!”
Draco met the younger Slytherin's eyes with his wide, grey ones.  "We're all animals." He reminded him softly before walking away.
“Of course,” Harry felt stupid, “it’s just that Malfoy, Draco, said…” Harry trailed off, unsure of what he was trying to say.
"Less so, but he was still quite..." Greg searched for the word, "delicate.  Not like you saw him at all."
Hermione hit him playfully on the arm.  "I'm fine.  Rosie has everything she needs.  I'm not freaking out at all."
“We have heard much about you.”  The taller one said.  He had a trace of an accent, but it was unidentifiable.  He held his hand out and Harry shook hands with him, and then his brother.
Harry was surprised that Malfoy had managed to wait his turn and not interrupted earlier.  Now he lifted his eyes briefly in Slughorn’s direction before dropping them again.  “We are all grateful that God has granted His Majesty a healthy child.”  He replied, and his hand went to his throat, where Harry saw a small, silver crucifix hanging.
“Of course,” Harry replied to her second question, then considered her first.  “We don’t really know each other that well, we’re in different houses at school and we argued a lot when we were younger.”  Less than a year ago, really, but he was reluctant to tell her that.  “But we’re getting along better now, he’s been helping me a lot.”  Harry realised this was true.  Although their arrangement had started as simply a mutually beneficial one, Harry had begun to enjoy their meetings, even Malfoy’s biting sarcasm no longer bothered him.
“Skarpheðinn specialises in curse-breaking and warding,” Malfoy explained, gesturing to the man who had spoken, “Flosi in runes and defensive magic.”
Draco bit his lip.  "I'm not meant to tell you, sir.  I'm sorry." He looked up at Harry with his big grey eyes and Harry may have melted.
“Thanks for that image.”  Draco sniffed.  “To return to the matter at hand, it seems we are at an impasse.”
Zabini’s scowl darkened.  “I concede, you wanker, now let me up!”  Malfoy’s smirk turned into a grin.
“Marie, Claudine, would you accompany us?”  Two of the ladies got to their feet.  “Gabrielle, perhaps you would keep an eye on Belle and the girls?”
Harry was saved from spending the entire morning with the Chevalier, but not by a more favourable fate.  Snape came across them taking a stroll in the Orangery.  He cut through the Chevalier’s prattle about Florence de Rohan, the beauteous maid who had so cruelly jilted him, with a single utterance of Harry’s title.
“But you can’t allow the public to know that.” Mr Potter sighed and moved around Draco to grab his tea, which Draco took as admission that he was right. “And it’s not like you actually have to marry her, you know she’s just waiting until she has enough money to elope with Greg.” Greg Goyle was Mr Potter’s security guard, at Draco’s behest, and was not considered an adequate match for Daphne by her parents. Daphne thought otherwise. “Now remember, during the service try to look touched, but don’t get tearful, no one likes a tearful civil servant. Try to stay out of any informal photos, but allow a few formal ones, preferable with the Minister, and make sure Daphne is at your side. You’ll be seated at a table with Daphne and probably some others from the ministry. The meal is likely to be a simple three-course with table service, I sincerely doubt that the Minister’s daughter will have opted for a buffet, so start with the cutlery on the outside and move inwards with each course. There’ll most likely be wine on the table, offer it around, starting with the ladies, before you pour your own glass, and do try not to get drunk. We don’t want a repeat of the Lithuanian Embassy’s Christmas Ball again, do we?” Mr Potter winced at he reminder of that particular debacle.
Lady Charlotte tittered again.  “Has he resolved the matter of his engagement with his father?”  She regarded Harry avidly.
Harry ran a hand through his hair; he could feel nerves and excitement building in him, but he didn’t want to raise his hopes, or Severus’s, unnecessarily.
Harry had followed Snape and Louis to a room that he assumed was the council room, a long room on the ground floor that overlooked the dark grounds.  Lucius Malfoy had joined them, along with a few other men Harry knew to be Louis’ ministers.  The King stood at the head of the table, his back to the window, and planted his hands on the table in fury.
Soon, Harry began to guide Draco’s movements, increasing the pace and pushing Draco to take a little more. Draco moaned at Harry’s tender control and did his best to accommodate him. Just as the rhythm was starting to get the better of Draco, Harry gently slid him off his cock.
“How on earth would I know, Potter?”  Malfoy snapped.  “Do you think I go around reading sealed letters from the King?”
"If you choose to court him everyone will know what he is, they will taunt him and degrade him in any way they can.  Is that really what you want?"
The lessons for the rest of the day were normal.  They just carried on from sixth year as if nothing had happened.  As if there had been no war, no deaths.  As if a quarter of their year didn't have the Dark Mark.
Draco stood as well and moved to take Mr Potter’s robe from his shoulders. “Good morning, Mr Potter. You have a meeting with Miss Greengrass in ten minutes and lunch with the Secretary for Galleons and Ministry Gold at one-thirty.”
“Finally you're here.”  Louis exclaimed.  Harry opened his mouth to give a platitude, but Louis sailed onwards.  “We’ve had news of great import.  A man who is known to the Court and well trusted came to us this morning with an astonishing claim.”  Harry cursed Louis’ theatrical tendencies internally.  “He said that he had seen our brother with his own eyes.”
As Harry had feared, Slughorn was quick to probe McLaggen and Belby for information about their prosperous relatives.  McLaggen passed the test, obviously having a close relationship to his well-connected uncle, but Belby was less fortunate as his father and the uncle in question were not close.  Then it was Zabini’s turn.
They walked through the stable and Harry took a moment to examine his new surroundings.  They were traversing the length of a large, semi-circular colonnade made of pale stone and carved ornately.  To their right was an open courtyard and to their left a blank wall.
“Stay.”  Said Malfoy, and at first Harry thought he was addressing him, but then Bors whined and shuffled unhappily, and he remembered the dogs.
“In Prague, in the Church of Our Lady of the Snows.  It appears he is a guest of the Franciscans there.”
Vince took Harry by the arm as soon as Draco had gotten in the shower.  "Today won't be easy.  First you have to get through breakfast; then there's classes, Draco will have to come to yours; people aren't going to be kind, you know, and there's protocol to follow."
"Thank you.  I've never really been able to tell anyone that before.  I don't want them to think I'm really the way I pretended to be."
“The Duc d’Oleans,” she said, as though it were obvious, “everyone calls him that because he has those big eyes, you know, like a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.”
Harry smiled gently at him. “Well, you’ve been trying to get me into bed all evening. What are you going to do now that I’m here?”
Harry cast his wand over the grass and bent to flash it under the low bushes. There was a glint of something under the shrubbery and Harry dropped to a knee to fish it out. As luck would have it, it was indeed Daphne’s earring.
Malfoy smiled reluctantly.  “I didn’t.”  Then he huffed ruefully.  “My brother is the King and he was allowed to choose his own wife.  Queen Élizabeth wasn’t necessarily the most advantageous match he could have made, but they fell in love.  The stakes of my marriage are much lower, so I don’t see why I shouldn’t enjoy the same luxury.”
Snape poured Harry and himself glasses of a clear, deep purple liquid.  The light from the fire shone through the liquid and turned Snape's skin  purple as he carried the drinks over to the table.  Snape seated himself in the chair across from Harry and sipped his drink.
At the end of the lesson, Harry's healing potion was identical to Hermione's, which he supposed he had Draco to thank for.
It was true, Harry had seen this show multiple times, but he couldn't help but watch.  Draco didn't have a shirt on and his pale skin was stretched across his lightly muscled stomach.  You could just make out his abs, and his ribs were visible stretched out as he was.  Harry may have been drooling.
"It's not my place to guess your mother's motives, sir, but perhaps she knew you wouldn't get any peace until you had done what was necessary.  She knew that the Dark Lord would come for you whether she wanted it or not, so she wanted you to be prepared when he did."
Draco did as he was asked while Harry quickly undressed.  Harry positioned himself in front of Draco, slipping a hand behind his submissive's head.
“Didn’t mean… help… this evening.” Mr Potter’s sentences were loosing coherence as he fought to stay awake. “Meant… sorting out all that… rubbish… with Daphne.”
Malfoy dipped his head modestly.  “I’m sure His Majesty has had more important things to concern himself with.”  He motioned to Harry.  “If you’ll excuse us, Condé, we mustn’t keep His Majesty waiting.”
They were descending a staircase now to the first floor, and Harry glimpsed the rustle of movement from the portraits that lined the walls.
Malfoy hesitated, realising Harry’s dilemma.  “You can call me Draco.  I will call you Harry.  People will assume we’re close friends, but perhaps that’s for the best.  You’re position is going to be constantly challenged because you’re English, because you haven’t been brought up at court and because you’ll be seen as trying to draw the King into a war that doesn’t concern him.  You’ll have to stand your ground at every turn.”
"Right, ruined," Ron turned his snarl on Dove.  "I bet you loved every second of it.  You're all muggle-hating scum."
Hermione smiled mischievously.  "Well, maybe bend them a little.  After all, what's the use of being the Chosen One if you don't get special dispensation?"
Reluctantly, Harry pulled away completely and made led the way to the bedroom. He turned and sealed his lips against Draco’s as soon as the blond had caught up with him. He sucked on the other man’s bottom lip as he slowly divested him of his shirt. Draco began to do the same to Harry, too needy to be shy anymore. Shirts discarded, Harry broke their kiss, this time to back onto the bed and pull himself up to the headboard. Draco took a moment to admire Harry’s defined chest and abdomen and his smooth, light-olive skin.
They both got dressed, then Harry gestured for Draco to sit in the chair in front of the vanity.  Harry stood behind him and brushed out his hair until it shone.  Taking a piece of hair from the the front of each side, he plaited both about a third of their length.  He had asked Pansy and Hermione to teach him how to do it, which they had done with enthusiasm, all the time cooing about how cute it was that he wanted to learn.  Then he brought both plaits back to meet behind Draco’s head, clipping them in place with the clasp he had bought.  It shrank the fit the smaller size.  The plaits finished inside the clasp, so bellow it all Draco's hair hung freely.
“He’s a romantic,” Snape said dismissively.  “I need to talk to you about your interview with the King this afternoon.”
“I might do.”  Harry knew he sounded petulant, but he felt he’d earned a bit of petulance.  “Anyway, these people,” he put a finger on the newspaper, “are French.  What have they got to do with me?”
"There wasn't, the mark on his arm and his name was proof enough.  But I warn you, it will not be an easy thing to convince them that they are wrong."
The man turned.  “I can try.”  He had a warm, pleasant face, and smiled at Harry.  “Good afternoon, my friend.  How can I help you?”
“No.  But I don’t think the King really needs my fame, I'm sure he has enough of his own.  And Hermione thinks it might be my only chance to get some support.”  Harry had to admit that Hermione’s argument had made sense to him, and that the thought of finally having someone in power on his side, other than Dumbledore, of course, appealed to him.
“Then you’ll have to stay here with the ladies.”  Enghien smirked again, and Harry realised that he was being teased.
He was glad when it was over, and the company had retired to the Salons to drink, play billiards and dance.  Draco didn’t do any of those things, he sat in a corner and put the Queen’s little dog on his lap, and Bors lay on his feet and Ajax put his huge fawn head next to Belle and sat with his eyes closed.  Enghein and Montespan sat next to him and Harry joined them.
Harry looked to Malfoy to intervene, but the other boy met his stare impassively.  “What do you want?”
The man shook his head, looking truly concerned now.  Harry wondered if it could be true, if Draco could really be here without anyone knowing who he was.
Harry frowned, Draco’s brother didn’t exactly sound like someone Harry wanted to turn to for help.  He knew he was idealistic, but he preferred his allies to share his desire to help others and challenge evil for its own sake.
"But Draco, you have to remember that everyone will know what you are if I court you.  You'll have to submit to me in public as well as private." This wasn't Harry's choice, it was a requirement of the bond.
"But you plan to, yes?" Harry nodded.  "Then why not buy the set and give the collar to him at a later date? We can package them for you separately." She was doing the sales assistant thing now, but he could see the sense behind it.
Harry furrowed his brow in thought.  “Go back to the bit about bowing.”  Malfoy tipped his head back and closed his eyes.
Zabini once again ignored her.  Malfoy answered instead.  “We put them up in the manor the summer before last.  All in one enchantments used to be very popular, but the conventional wisdom now is to have several separate enchantments that can be individually adjusted and won’t all fail at the same time.”  He was running the beads through his hands as he spoke, and they clicked anxiously.
"I like it." Harry confirmed.  He slipped it around Draco's neck and fixed it in place.  "Now I'm going to tie you to the bed a fuck you, would you like that?"
We would be pleased if you would join us for Yule at our palace of Versailles.  We look forward with pleasure to meeting you and we are confident you will find your stay most comfortable.  You may make all necessary arrangements through our brother, with whom we have entrusted this letter.
“It’s a lot of nonsense.”  Malfoy complained.  Then he turned to Harry.  “We can continue this next week.  Curfew is in twenty minutes.”  Harry took that as his cue to leave.  As he closed the door behind him, he saw Snape take Harry’s vacated seat and Malfoy light his cigarette with a flick of his wand.
Harry didn’t know what to think.  At least that sounded a little more like Malfoy.  Harry broke the wax seal and unfolded the parchment to reveal a handwritten letter.
Draco was already standing in the middle of the circle, next to the alter.  His hair was loose but interspersed with tiny braids, silver threads and metal beads.  He wore a shear silver robe over a black tunic.  His feet were bare and he wore no make up or jewellery.  Harry felt a shiver go through him as he looked at what would soon be his.  Draco looked perfect.
Harry and Draco stood outside the Ministry.  Draco shifted anxiously, they had been waiting for almost half an hour.
“I won’t have this argument with you again, I don’t recall making any headway last time.”  Malfoy responded with wry smile.
Cold horror flooded Harry.  Draco.  He exchanged another, more loaded, glance with Snape.  They were both running before Harry had made a conscious choice.
Draco was running up the path behind them.  He held his robes in his hands to keep them away from his feet, making him look almost like a child as he ran.  Behind him his two wolfhounds trotted calmly through the Orangery.
“Yes, he wants to keep on the King’s good side.  We’re all fighting the same war, after all.  And as for the precautions, you’re about to meet them.”  Malfoy led Harry towards the antechamber off the Great Hall.  “His Majesty suggested that my cousins join me here to ensure that the castle is adequately protected.”  He explained as he pushed the door open.  “Potter, I’d like to introduce Flosi and Skarpheðinn Bjarnsson.  Cousins, this is Harry Potter, the Marquess of Dorchester.”
“I don’t know if I can come back.”  Draco said, face suddenly open and vulnerable, fingers still at his throat.  “People will have moved on, settled.”
Harry shook himself.  He probably shouldn't be thinking that.  He got himself a glass of water and went back to bed.
"I meant no offence, Master.  It's just, some Dominants choose to marry someone else and live with them while keeping their submissive elsewhere." His eyes were now trained on the floor.
The five Slytherins left the common room bags in hand.  Draco hugged himself and shivered.  He felt very exposed, all alone.  He wasn't alone, he reminded himself.  Harry had agreed to look after him, even though he knew what he was, despite what he had done to him in the past.  He didn't deserve it, he knew that.
Harry groaned as he slid into Draco’s tight heat. He dropped his head to Draco’s collarbone and mouthed at the skin there. His hips found a steady pace of movement in and out, and he adjusted the angle until he found the spot that made Draco swear and arch off the bed. As he moved faster and harder, he raised his head to capture Draco’s mouth with his own and swallow down his desperate moans.
Ron started to mutter about not wanting to team-build with the Slytherins, but was drowned out by Zabini snorting and asking, "What, should we say which pets we have as well."
Malfoy lifted his teacup and cradled it in his hands; it was still too hot to drink.  “We will travel to the palace with a portkey, apparition is forbidden in the grounds.  I prefer to arrive at the stables entrance, but if you prefer a more ceremonial entrance, that can be arranged.”  Harry muttered a negative.  “When we arrive, the King may desire us to attend him immediately, or he may wish to wait until dinner.  If he wishes for us to see him immediately, we will be directed to wherever he is.  Most likely that will be one of the Salons or Le Rocher, a folly in the Queen’s estate that is lately his favourite.  When you enter the King’s presence, you will bow.  You will not address the King directly unless he speaks to you.  You will not leave the King’s presence until he gives you leave.  If the King wishes to wait until dinner to meet you, you will be escorted to you rooms upon your arrival.  You will be escorted to dinner, most likely in the Rocaille Grove.  As you are a guest, and, I suppose, a Marquis, you will likely be invited to sit at the table with His Majesty.  You will sit when he sits, you will stand when he stands, you will eat when he eats.  Then there will be dancing.  It will be freezing, dress warmly.  If you aren’t invited to eat at the table, you will stand with the rest of the court and watch the King take dinner.  You will need fine robes, the King likes his courtiers to be decorative.”  Malfoy sipped his tea.  Harry picked up his own cup.  It smelt offputtingly floral, but he took a sip anyway, and found that it wasn’t as highly flavoured as expected.  In fact it was rather light and refreshing.
He gave the class another meaningful look, then disappeared into his office.  Whispers started throughout the class.  Was Snape not staying to supervise them? Why not? What was wrong with him?
Draco shuddered at the memory. “Vytautas Abakanowicz,” he put in automatically. God, he’d been so jealous he’d thought he might die.
Harry focused in on his book.  It was about magical creatures that looked human, and there was a chapter about Magical Submissives.  It basically said that they were useless burdens on the wizards who claimed them.  But there was some useful information.  Before Submissives were claimed they has to be wooed, the person wooing them assumed temporary mastery of the Submissives until they decided if they wanted to keep them.  Like a pet.  Harry shook his head.  The role of the Master was to control the Submissive completely.  Tell them when to eat, drink and sleep, they had to obey their Master's every command.  Harry blushed, the Submissive couldn't even orgasm without permission.
“I didn’t expect you to find me here.”  Draco said, and Harry wondered if he meant he hadn’t expected anyone to find him in the church, or Harry to be the one to find him, or anyone to be looking for him at all.  His voice was still soft and enigmatic, never offering the emphasis that would make his meaning clear.
Harry didn’t see Malfoy again face to face until their next scheduled meeting, which fell just four days before their departure for Versailles.  Harry couldn’t fathom how the time had flown by so fast.  Between discussions with Malfoy, meetings with the order, and extra training with Dumbledore and the Bjarnssons, Harry had had very little time to enjoy being at Hogwarts.
Snape’s face was very still.  “It is.  And I gave it to Draco.”  When Hogwarts was attacked, Harry remembered in a rush, and Snape must have never taken it back.
They still had a few hours before the rest of the school arrived and it would be time for dinner.  Most of the eighth years now sat in the common room.  As Harry chatted to Ron, Hermione and Neville, he saw Crabbe, Goyle and Malfoy enter.  They moved over to what had become the Slytherin section.  There was only a small couch left which Crabbe and Goyle sat on, Malfoy sat at their feet.  The whole thing seemed slightly surreal.  Harry had never thought Malfoy could look so comfortable sitting on the floor, but it seemed second nature to him to sit at his friends' feet.
When Draco reached them, a little out of breath, his usually drawn face was open and happy.  For once he looked his age, the excursions of the morning and now his pleasure at seeing his godfather had washed away some of his tension.  Harry couldn’t help but admire him, shining like the moon in the pale winter sun.
“Yes, well, that wasn’t so unusual at the time.  Cousins marrying, I mean.  Anyway, they had a child when they were in exile, after Charles X abdicated, in Edinburgh actually, but they kept it a secret and raised him in the wizarding communities of the cities they lived in.  It was only in 1848, when Napoleon III abdicated, that the French wizarding community invited their son, Ferdinand, to be king.  His line has been on the throne ever since.”  She added Ferdinand to the tree.
“Er, sure?”  Harry was starting accept his constant state of mild bemusement.  Draco poured an amber stream into a delicate china teacup and placed it on a saucer in front of Harry.  “Thanks.”
“Idiot.  But anyway, Dorchester, you must play cards with us again whenever you please.  Draco spends half his time at confession, it’s so very dull.”
No one else was able to say anything for the rest of the lesson because Professor Goldmann entered and refused to let anyone talk when they weren't answering questions.  Harry could still feel the stares, though; especially Ron's glare which was boring a hole in his back.
Severus gave a rare smile.  "It sounds like you know what you're doing.  Please take care of Draco for me."
"It's okay, we don't mind.  Like we said, we trust you.  I'd read up on Magical Submissives, if I were you, there's a lot to know.  Just don't do anything until you're ready."
“By portkey, I imagine.”  Snape said.  “It is permitted for courtiers to create their own portkeys to leave, is it not?”
“Tomorrow is an important day,” Enghein observed, “the Christmas Eve hunt and the ballet, you’ll join us for that, at least, won’t you, Dorchester?  Sorry, Harry.”  Another of his smirks.
“Don’t let Mrs Black see that.”  Harry advised.  The portrait shrieked at anything she deemed muggle.  Just the day before she had glimpsed Harry’s trainers in the hall when Kreacher had been dusting her frame and thrown the most almighty tantrum.
Mr Potter groaned, “Why do I have to do that?” Draco knew he didn’t really object to Daphne’s company, it was the rumours in the gossip magazines of their impending nuptials that bothered him.
Harry was ready when the vocal relay spell went off and Draco’s voice resonated through his office. “Mr Weasley’s here to see you, sir. Shall I send him in or ask him to come back later?”
The meal was served on round tables on the lawn. Harry supposed these would have gone in the pavilion had the weather taken a turn for the worse, but as it was there was nothing more than a light breeze over the lake. Harry chose a simple vegetable soup to start, followed by duck breast in a cherry and red wine sauce, and Daphne only had to kick him under the table once when he almost chose the wrong spoon for the soup. The menu was old fashioned, presumably to please the antiquated tastes of the older pureblood diners. Daphne was having the other main course option, rabbit and spring greens, and offered Harry some, but he couldn’t quite face eating something that had once been so cuddly. When Harry voiced this opinion, Daphne merely snorted and told him that lambs were quite cute too, until you skinned them and roasted them with garlic. An old pureblood housewife to Harry’s left gasped in horror at her uncouthness. Daphne just smiled demurely and launched into a story about how her great uncle, Lord Archibald Swinton, had, when summering in Lyon, left a restaurant in disgust at the appalling quality of the roast lamb with gravy, advertised as an English speciality, only to return the next day and buy the restaurant to ensure a better quality of lamb in the future.
Harry's eyes opened slowly.  It had to be past midnight, he was thirsty, it must have woken him up.  He opened the curtains and stopped in surprise.  The Slytherins all slept with their curtains open, even Greg and Vince once they were done for the evening.  Harry had slept in a dormitory for the best part of seven years, and in that time everyone had closed their curtains, most had put up silencing charms.
Harry collapsed next to Draco as his aftershocks faded. Draco nestled tiredly into his side. They were both pleasantly sated and riding high on endorphins. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d been this content, certainly never with another lover. It was a long time before either of them spoke.
Things became chilly between Harry and his erstwhile best friend over the following weeks.  Ron wouldn't give up on his 'Slytherins are evil' campaign, but the Slytherins proved him wrong at every turn.  They were polite, considerate and really no trouble at all.  Draco was incredible.  Most of the time he was unrecognisable as the boy Harry had known for six years, then he would say something that reminded Harry vividly of the Malfoy he had known, except he was funny rather than offensive.  One such event occurred about a month into the term.
Harry took a bracing breath.  "Ten minutes, right." Ten minutes until he bonded with Draco for life.
“Langlock!”  Malfoy cut across whatever curse Zabini had been about to cast, though Harry had his suspicions, and hopped up onto his desk as Zabini spluttered.  “Petrificus Totalus!”  Zabini keeled over backwards with a thud.
Malfoy looked at him as though he was the most stupid person he’d ever met.  “No, Potter.  Don’t you think I would have mentioned it before now?  We have translation spells all over the palace for visitors.  Lord, you're such a muggle.”
Harry peered at the table where the flash had been.  It was no longer empty.  “Oh God.”  Harry felt sick.
Then Harry was kissing him again, and it was all mouths and tongues and teeth biting each other’s lips. Harry pulled Draco’s robe off, his own discarded upon entering the apartment, and hoisted the smaller man off the ground. Draco wrapped his legs quickly around Harry to keep his balance and ground their hips together. Their kiss remained frantic as Harry set Draco’s back against the nearest wall. They ground together rhythmically as their tongues played.
Harry’s stomach was too knotted for him to feel particularly hungry, but he nodded anyway and sat down opposite Draco.
Harry kissed him gently then led him into one of the sitting rooms.  It was as bright as the entrance hall, pale grey walls and cream sofas.  They went through to the formal dinning room.  The dinning table had a glass top and pale wood frame.  The chairs were cream leather and the walls were a pale coffee colour.
Malfoy snorted and rolled his eyes.  “Blaise hasn’t landed a decent curse on me in at least the last four years, Potter.  Trust me when I say I had nothing to worry about.”
Back in their dorms that evening there was an odd sort tension, the different houses tiptoeing around each other.
"They show him receiving orders from Dumbledore to spy on Lord Voldemort, and him giving reports to Dumbledore about Death Eater meetings and plans, dating back to the beginning of the first war.  They show quite clearly that Mr Malfoy was a spy for the Light."
"That's enough, Ron." Harry advised.  "I think you should go to the hospital wing, that nose looks broken." Ron snarled at Draco but allowed himself to be directed to the door.
Without further prompting, Draco dropped to his knees.  "I swear obedience to you, my Master, to do your will before my own.  My duty is to you above all others, including myself.  Your care and comfort, pleasure and prosperity are my foremost concerns.  If I am disobedient, my punishment will be yours to decide.  My life is yours to use as you see fit."
They were led to the third floor where their dorms and common room was.  The common room was done in carefully neutral colours, but was otherwise pretty similar to the Gryffendor one.  The boys were directed to a door on the left through which was their dorm.
“If the wrong person hears him calling me ‘Your Royal Highness’ I’m going to be murdered in my sleep.”  Ajax growled softly behind them.  “Hush.”
Draco looked up from his place in the middle of the bed.  He sat cross legged with his hair pooled around him.  "They're to remind us how quickly your life can be ruined."
Greg laughed.  "What Vince means is that there are ways to do things now, and they won't make your life easy."
Snape held out a portkey rod, identical to the one Draco had used the first time Harry had visited Versailles.  Even though it had been eighteen months since he had seen Draco, those memories were still as fresh as ever.  Harry had the feeling that Louis would be none too pleased at Harry turning up in his riding clothes, but there was no way he was going to take the time to change.
Snape seemed to accept this.  His eyes were dark, Harry had no idea what he was thinking.  "Hurt him and I will kill you." The words were simple and deadly.  He lifted his lip in a slight snarl to show one elongated canine.  Harry got the message.
Greg started the proceedings.  "I call the element of earth into the circle to preside over this bond."
The students started moving more purposefully and Flosi was able to manhandle Harry past them and up the stairs.  They entered the Great Hall, which was empty save for a few startled looking Hufflepuffs who had already made their way up from their basement, and Harry shrugged out of Flosi’s hold.
“I’m sure you’re getting on well with him, he is your stepfather now, after all.”  Slughorn’s joviality sounded rather forced.
Draco sighed and placed a palm to his forehead. The spell was intended to sober you up if you had one too many butterbeers and wanted to apparate safely, not five too many shots of Russian Snegurka-made vodka and couldn’t sit up safely. “No, sir, you’ll be sick.”
Theo and Pansy approached with their two boys, Rory and Alexander.  Their relationship was more stable now, though their arguments were still legendary.  Greg and Vince were travelling, they hadn't really stopped since their honeymoon, they enjoyed the nomadic lifestyle too much.  But they always visited regularly and were favoured uncles among the children for the exotic gifts they brought with them.  Neville and Luna were at Hogwarts, Neville teaching Herbology and Luna teaching Arithmancy.  Lucius and Severus were enjoying early retirement in the Malfoy villa in France and McGonagall was always pestering Draco to take Severus's old job, as his replacement was nowhere near as capable.
“How is she?”  For some reason Harry had the impression that Narcissa Malfoy wasn’t well, but he wasn’t sure where from.
Snape placed a hand on his shoulder.  “O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms, so haggard and so woebegone?”  He gave Montespan a little shake.  “Fear not, child, you’ll find your beautiful maiden.”  Then his face returned to its habitual sneer.  “So do pull yourself together.”
Harry sat in Transfigurations two days later.  They were learning how to transfigure an object into a humanoid.  It was impossible to create a person with magic, but you could make a sort of robot/human thing.  It was just theory and Harry was bored by the third sentence the new professor, Leo Layley, had spoken.  Not that he was a boring teacher, he was better than McGonagall, but Transfiguration theory wasn't really Harry's thing.
“Then it’s certain,” Louis said, pleased.  “Our brother is in Prague.”  It was the news he had been waiting for, but now that Harry had finally heard it he felt largely numb.  Louis levelled his gaze at Harry.  “You will retrieve him for us.”
It must have been about three in the morning when he heard the noise.  A soft whimpering issued from across the room.  Harry sat up, wondering if someone was having a nightmare.  He pulled open his curtains.  Dove was in the middle of his bed again, hair spread around him.  This time, though, he was tossing his head around and small whimpers escaped his lips.
"And because of that I was made to hate Slytherins and like Gryffindors and be the perfect little soldier for the Light?" Harry's temper was piqued.
Draco stepped into Mr Potter’s living room and opened the curtains. It was a bright, summers day, as befitted the occasion, and Draco wouldn’t have put it past Shacklebolt to have performed a little weather magic to ensure that everything was perfect for darling daughter’s special day. He repeated this process in Mr Potter’s bedroom, the light revealing Mr Potter, still wrapped in his duvet, groaning at he brightness. Draco respectfully turned away as Mr Potter collected himself, and picked out some dress robes from Mr Potter’s wardrobe.
There was a little hitch in Draco’s breathing, the edge of a sob.  “Could I come and see them?”  He asked tentatively.
"He was fine.  We had a bit of a heart to heart after he hit Ron.  Is it true Snape told you to destroy Ravenclaw's diadem?"
"Maybe you should have had the guts to stand up to You-Know-Who." Strange that Ron said that when he couldn't even say the name. He was making a fool of himself.
"What legal proceedings were used to prosecute my client, sir?  Trial before the Wizengamont?  A Tribunal?  Were either of these used to determine Mr Malfoy's guilt?"
Harry winced.  Zabini turned to Ron, eyes blazing. "Do you not know when to shut up?  Dove isn't even allowed to see his father before they do it.  It's like he's lost Luc already.  He's in mourning."
"How?  The Dark Lord wants you three," he motioned at the Slytherins, "to join him.  So you decided that it would be a good idea put your lives in danger by spying against him, you know, so you can die painful deaths.  How could it be worse, Cissa?"
“Big,” Draco said, his tone brooking no arguments. “And don’t try to distract me. What are you really worried about?”
Malfoy smiled, and took his hand in his own. The moment they touched, Harry sucked in a harsh breath, his eyes fluttering closed as every hair on his body stood on end. He shivered helplessly, and felt the hand around his tremble in response. His entire body was
“Except I’m already a killer, aren’t I?” Harry argued, wildly. “I killed Professor Quirrell when I was eleven. My soul’s already corrupted. And the prophecy says I have to at least
Seamus was not far behind her, levitating three injured students in front of him. Pansy threw defensive spells over their shoulders blindly, hoping Hannah was moving the bubble to guard their retreat. Then Blaise and Cho shielded them until the infirmary doors were closed behind them.
. Harry could feel it, and it made his heart swell with joy and pride and love. “You really want it?” he asked, his whole body shaking.
. That was a perfect description of their magic, however unintentional. But then, Ron didn’t know. How could he? He’d never felt it.
“Ah, Mr Potter,” said a voice, and Harry jumped and whirled. Snape smirked. “I see you’re eager to begin. Come with me.”
Slughorn beamed at him. “Extraordinarily insightful, Mr Potter!” he said, effusively. “Ten points to Gryffindor! Very well deserved, indeed!”
Draco lay sprawled over one of the sofas in the Slytherin sixth year’s den, one leg kicked up over the arm, his head cradled in Harry’s lap. He was half asleep already. Harry was, apparently, a born masseuse. His fingers were
. Draco still called him that, of course, all the time… but how could he not have noticed how much it had changed? How different it was, to how he used to say it? Warm, affectionate, sometimes exasperated, but always with that underlying tone of
,” he murmured. He couldn’t resist the urge to slide a finger into Harry’s arse, feeling the heat and the slickness of the lube, thinking with a shiver that this was the first time he’d been allowed to use that spell on Harry.
Hermione had to suppress a smile. Harry was awfully adorable, sometimes. She really was rather enjoying seeing him happy and in love;
Harry let himself rock forward, just a little, relishing the slide of his erection against the dip of Draco’s hipbone. It wasn’t the same as being naked, of course, soft, smooth skin rubbing up against each other, but –
Draco gaped at him. “What? No, I’m not. You said it was Voldemort. He opened the Chamber of Secrets.”
Dumbledore looked at him for a long moment, and Harry felt uncomfortably as if those blue eyes were stripping him down to his very soul. Then he sighed. “I am going to tell you a story, Harry. Do you remember the name Grindelwald?”
go back and sleep. You always look so tired, and I know there’s not much I can do, but I wanted to help somehow.”
Draco didn’t look at her, burning a long strip down the middle of his canopy. “I take it, since you’re here, that Blaise changed his mind?”
He cried out in pain, a tear escaping his control and slipping down his face, and Draco eased up slightly, frowning.
“Yeah,” Harry said. He took a deep breath. “You realise this means I can’t keep my promise to you? I have to die, so Voldemort can die. Otherwise, what happened last time will happen again. The Horcruxes make him, essentially, immortal.
“There are certain irregularities. Readings that do not quite match up, that I cannot explain as the drain from Apparating through the school wards.”
She smiled at him tremulously. “Just a little singed, dear. I didn’t know you remembered those self-defence lessons.”
to you. You’ll get to feel what I feel, remember what I remember – but it won’t be all you feel or remember. I promise.”
“How do you know that?” Harry asked, suspiciously. Not even Snape had known, at first, and the Alphas (all except Draco, of course) certainly hadn't. “And while we're on the subject, what the
“Harry,” Draco said breathlessly, his hands in Harry’s hair now, his hips making small, spasmodic jerks under his restraining arm. “Suck. Suck me. Now. Just – no teeth, and – keep your hand where –”
Not so very surprising, Draco thought, considering he hadn’t left the Room once all day. “What is it?” he said.
Ron grimaced. That was kind of what he was afraid of. If Malfoy’s defection had been a ruse, chances were that some, if not all, of the Slytherins would turn back with him as soon as it was discovered. “How are we going to get inside, then?” he asked.
Who would have thought Malfoy could ever look like that? Like someone else was the centre of his world? Like
Harry slipped into the seat beside Ron at the Gryffindor table, snagging a piece of crispy bacon from his plate. Ron grunted, but his mouth was too full to protest, and Harry was already talking by the time he’d chewed enough to swallow. “Did you know Ginny’s dating Blaise Zabini?”
“Good,” she said. “Be careful, Potter. You will no doubt find yourself sorely provoked over the next few days. For your sake, and Mr Malfoy’s, do try not to lose your temper, or I suspect you will find it splashed across the front page of every paper from the Daily Prophet to Madam’s Weekly.”
“Maybe our destiny is to be apart when it comes for us,” he said, throat aching with the tears he couldn’t shed. “Maybe we’ll save the fucking
The Death Eaters all swung around to point their wands at the intruder. Harry strained to catch a glimpse. Saw silvery light glinting off white-blond hair. Alone. Draco was
to research White Mages, but it hadn’t occurred to her that she might be able to do that without Malfoy’s mysterious book. “Soul magic?” she demanded.
Hermione sighed. “I know. And I agree with you, Harry. But maybe if you told him the truth about Malfoy, The Plan, all of it… he might be more inclined to take you into his confidence. The end of term’s coming up, and Malfoy’s bound to make his move before then. Time’s running out. We need to be ready, and that means we need Dumbledore.”
They walked down one of the rows, and it wasn’t until they were almost at the other end before they finally came across a cell that wasn’t empty.
Ginny started to look away, but her attention was caught by the smile on Harry’s face. Obviously there was genuine, and then there was a
, George thought, relieved. A sudden, sharp increase in pain made him gasp. He looked down to see Fred’s hands pressing down on his wounds. “Stop,” he protested, trying to push him away. Maybe that was why he couldn’t breathe. “Freddie, stop...”
“I know,” Draco choked out, but he was backing away, still shaking his head. “Tell me who it was, Harry. Tell me
Hermione scowled. That was the root of the issue, of course. She just hadn’t believed they would be so blatant about it. “Lucius Malfoy, yes,” she agreed, flatly.
. For a moment, seeing him there, Harry had forgotten to be afraid. Somehow, despite everything, he found it a comfort to have him close, at the end. A witness to his sacrifice. Someone to tell Draco:
“I reckon our Harry’s mission to Malfoy Manor was a success,” Fred said, examining his face with interest.
a Gryffindor, after all, and thus more than likely to bollocks it all up. But on the off-chance it does go exactly to plan –”
!” Harry snapped, and Draco fell back a step, startled. Harry closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. “I’m sorry. I'm
Draco nodded, and Harry stepped closer. He looked nervous, and Draco silently asked the dozens of clingy creatures to let them have this moment alone. One of the pixies pinched his ear, but they left without complaint.
“I meant what I said before,” Millicent said, looking around at them all. “The Dark Lord betrayed my cousin to a group of Order members during the first war, for failing to murder a group of Muggleborns found hiding in this very barn. My parents claimed no knowledge of them at the time, after Donny died, but the truth was that my parents were the ones hiding them. They were just too afraid to stand up to the Dark Lord directly. I won’t live that lie, not when I have a way out.”
Snape looked up at her, frowning. “I do hope you’re right, Miss Parkinson. But Potter is getting better, and Draco appears to be getting worse.”
A hand grabbed his arm, and he was gripped by a terrible squeezing sensation. Side-Along Apparition. He’d forgotten what it was like. He hated it,
But another part of him couldn't help but remember there was a reason Dumbledore couldn't remove him from this fight, even if he’d wanted to.
Malfoy stared, uncomprehending. The dark circles under his eyes were even more pronounced than usual, and he was struggling to focus on Harry. “You… took Vince’s place?” he said, almost slurring his words in his exhaustion. “But, Potter, I’m your
“Yes, professor,” Harry said, relieved. He hesitated. “Can I ask – the Nightmare Curse? Do they know who did it?”
“I am well aware of when our last Hogsmeade trip is, Potter,” Malfoy said, tightly. He sounded suddenly, revoltingly like Snape, and Harry almost let him go. But then his eyes caught on the arch of Malfoy’s throat, pale and inviting, Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallowed. “Stop looking at me like that!” Malfoy snapped, and Harry jerked his head up to meet the stormy grey eyes. “Have you gone
It certainly wasn’t the most practical of locations, but Dean was flexible. “Why not?” He took her hand and drew her to her feet, and she fit against him perfectly; soft curves into hard angles. He hummed a little, tunelessly, and they swayed together. It was a clear night, thousands of stars studding the sky. It felt like they were the only two people in the world.
“I’m coming,” he said, determined. He settled back on his heels to give himself room to wave his wand, and said very clearly and precisely, “
Draco pulled him closer, his growl reaching an audible pitch, vibrating through Harry’s chest. Pius didn't look angry or aggravated by the hostility, though; he just nodded and sat back in his chair. “I see,” he said, his tone gentling. “There is something wrong. Something... preventing your heat?”
“Yes,” Ron said, warming to the topic. “Rumour has it Dumbledore once spent fifteen years training with a War Mage, but he left before he earned the title because – well, apparently he disagreed with the teachings. Did you know that?”
,” Draco said. He demonstrated the wand movement, and then waited while everyone practiced. “The path splits in the rose garden. One leads to a secret passage into the dungeons, the other to the kitchen door in the east wing. It’s the closest entrance to my mother’s chambers. The spell will show you the way in and out, if you get separated. Don’t stray from the path, or you’ll set off the runes. Or worse.”
McGonagall looked angry, and they were all still somewhat suspicious, Draco thought, but it had been diminished by the genuine contrition in Potter’s voice. He looked near tears, in fact; an impressive feat, considering the Time-Turner was at that very moment tucked safely inside Draco’s robes.
“Drink this,” Madam Pomfrey said, suddenly, shockingly close. Harry jumped. She pressed a tiny vial to his lips, and he swallowed obediently, eyes watering at the taste. He coughed. “Careful, Potter,” she said, gruffly gentle, and hurried away.
There was a storm brewing above Hogwarts, dark thunderclouds rolling in to hide the stars. A steadily increasing patter of rain beat at the windows of the Great Hall. Harry watched the rivulets of water running down the thick glass, ignoring the subdued chatter of the students around him. The Great Hall was strangely empty at mealtimes now.
Harry paled, and then flushed. “You’re right,” he said, and didn’t miss the gleam of triumph, and what looked like relief, in Dumbledore’s eyes. “I was given an opportunity, and I was so sure Draco was a Death Eater, but no one would listen to me. I had to take it, sir. I thought I could convince him to defect. I’m sorry I lied to you, but we had to make it as believable as possible.”
He shot up, unable to prevent the smile crossing his face. It probably made him look like a hopeless fool, but she was smiling, too. Then Zabini leaned down to speak in her ear, and she tilted her head towards him. He slid an arm around her waist, and even from a distance, Seamus could see the way she stiffened. He tried not to visibly react; Pansy didn’t appreciate them fighting over her, not overtly – ‘like dogs with a bone’, she had scolded them once.
“Of course not,” Draco said. “Simply that Dark and Light are types of magic, not the intent with which the spells are used. The core of magic you’re born with is never neutral. That’s a myth. I was born a Dark wizard, just as you were born a Light wizard.”
Fear was pounding through his veins; not all of it his own. Draco was in serious danger. But how? And more importantly, where?
A familiar hand touched his arm, interrupting his self-recriminations, and he almost jumped out of his skin.
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “You are being deceived,” he said. “But it isn’t by me, and it isn’t by Professor Snape. He was following orders. I saw Dumbledore beg him to do it.”
!” Harry cried out as Draco stuck his tongue up his arse. His Alpha licked and slurped, sucking messily at the slick wetness Harry was producing. He moaned at the taste, sending a shock of shivers down Harry's spine, fucking his tongue in and out until his jaw had to be aching, but still he kept on, and on, and
The ecstatic high Hermione had been floating on since Ron’s confession burst like an over-inflated balloon that afternoon.
help, if he’d just killed you? They’d both be –” He cut himself off. “They’d be criminals,” he realised. “Fugitives. On the run from everyone. The Order, the Ministry. Even – oh Merlin, even
Draco sighed, and finished another series of incantations, tunnelling a safe route through the wards. They had decided to split into two teams. They would only have one chance at this. His mother had been in her bedroom in Cardosa’s Pensieve memory, but Cardosa had staged that memory, deliberately. So one team would be searching the dungeons, just in case, while his team tried to get to her quarters in the east wing.
“That doesn’t mean we don’t plan,” Ron said. “We’re going to get that Horcrux out of you, mate, remember?”
Malfoy turned on his heel without responding, and Harry wandered off in the other direction, whistling.
Draco shook his head, his heart aching. Even now, Harry wanted to believe the best of him, and he was wrong. “It wouldn’t have been easier,” he argued. “A few weeks ago, maybe. I might not have even hesitated. I considered a very similar scenario, at first. Pretending to return your feelings, making you trust me and then offering you up to the Dark Lord.”
“Absolutely not,” Dumbledore said, sharply. “There is a chance, now, for Harry to come back from beyond the veil. But only if he gives his life willingly, and only if it is Voldemort who strikes the killing blow. His sacrifice achieves nothing if he has knowledge of an escape clause.”
“She’d already defected,” Draco said, desperately. “The news would have reached the Dark Lord soon enough. I focused his attention on her betrayal to take his attention off me. It was a calculated risk. I went in with a team of Order members, and they rescued not only my mother, but other prisoners. I had to regain his trust, fast. If I hadn’t managed to escape with you, he would have gone after Pansy. Now – now I’m hoping he’ll be too angry with me to remember her betrayal.”
“Harry,” Draco said, taking an aborted step forward. His eyes flickered to Goyle. He grabbed Harry’s hand, pulling him into the room. “Where in Salazar’s name have you
Harry had decided to leave them to it. He wasn’t sleeping well, and although it was a little too hot to actually nap, he was just happy to take some unscheduled time off from Hermione’s strict study plan. He entertained himself with counting the few wisps of pure, white cloud high above, giving them the names of his enemies.
Draco didn’t look at her. “I didn’t intend to be, but Professor Snape never keeps students in detention past ten o’clock.”
“He’s right, Harry,” Hermione interrupted. “Professor Snape has been on suppressants for so long, I very much doubt anything but the most radical medical intervention will allow him to get pregnant now.”
, within reach. You’re safe here, but it’ll hurt you if you come out too soon. I’ll come and get you when it's done, okay? Stay
Moody forced him to his knees in the middle of the room. His magical eye spun wildly in all directions, and he nodded approvingly. “Not bad. Not as secure as your office, Albus, but it’ll do in a pinch.”
“We’re mated now,” Draco said, ignoring his not-so-subtle request. “Of course it’s not like last time. Now, quiet. All I want to hear from you are moans and screams, understand?”
“No,” Ron said, and then there were sounds of retching into the toilet. “But thanks for reminding me.”
He climbed through, robes dishevelled and his hair mussed. He looked… Merlin, he looked thoroughly fucked; lips red and kiss-swollen, his whole body loose and relaxed. Hermione couldn’t help but flush in second-hand embarrassment for him.
Dean strode purposefully down the shore, and Seamus lay back, looking up at the cloudless sky. After a moment, he turned his head, searching for another smooth stone to tease the Giant Squid with. Instead, he caught sight of Pansy and her friends.
Harry set his jaw obstinately. “I promised to keep you safe, and that means no sex. It’s just,” he sighed, “when I touch you, and kiss you, and make you come, you get all soft and – and
Harry shuddered, whining in his throat. He let go of his legs to reach for his Alpha, but Draco had pulled back a little.
“Oh, no,” Scrimgeour said. “Of course not. Just pointing out that you are in a very precarious situation. I would like to do what I can to help.”
“Severus,” Dumbledore said, sharply. “He never had a ‘chance’. Lily’s son was always meant to die. You accepted that, long ago. Fortunately for us all, the boy has now, too.”
He woke up in the infirmary, squinting against the harsh glare of the overhead lights. It was dark outside, and he felt an odd sense of displacement, like the time he'd had a too-long nap in the afternoon and went down to the Great Hall for breakfast, only to discover it was just dinnertime. He flung out a hand to the bedside table for his glasses, and encountered Draco’s hand, instead.
“It was McGonagall’s,” Draco explained. “Potter borrowed it from her, and then lied to their faces about it; McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Snape. He said he broke it. They didn’t know whether to believe him or not, but he said it with a straight face, Pansy. Tears in his eyes. Genuine contrition. I’m not sure I would’ve seen through it.”
“I don’t think anyone is,” Harry said. He shrugged. “Maybe that’s exactly why we have to have it. A giant
Draco with how much he felt for him. It was ridiculous that he didn’t know. Harry had never loved anyone the way he loved Draco.
,” Hermione assured him. “Mr Lovegood did exactly what we asked, and printed you word-for-word. It’s just you. Listen – ‘I couldn’t believe he was gone. I really didn’t believe it; I kept waiting for him to jump out from behind the veil and laugh, like he always did. And then Bellatrix ran, and I chased after her. I was so angry. She made it all the way to the Atrium before I caught up. She taunted me, asking me if I loved him, and I – I just hated her so much in that moment, I wanted her to
buried deep in his own mind, he’d still been free to choose. To say no. No matter how difficult it had been, no matter how desperately he’d wanted to give in to his most base instincts and beg for just
“Potter!” Snape exclaimed. “I have no desire to hear –” He cut himself off abruptly. “Great Salazar grant me mercy,
minutiae of the future like you can, but I would like to master even a tenth of your skill with scrying.”
Adeline took a deep breath, obviously trying for some sort of composure. “It’s Atwood’s loyalists,” she said, and then she was babbling again. “You have to come! They just started
For example: Potter’s hand, soft and just slightly callused where he held his wand, enough to catch and wear maddeningly + Draco’s cock = Draco slowly losing his mind.
Harry stared at him, feeling more than a little moved. “Thank you,” he said. “That means –” He shook his head wordlessly.
“I’m not in heat. Not properly. Draco says I collapsed, just minutes after we killed Voldemort, and my heat came on immediately. We don’t know why, exactly, but –”
If that was true, maybe it meant most of the Slytherins were really only scared children, waiting for someone to just care enough to rescue them.
Draco snorted. “You’d better not call him that to his face. He doesn’t take kindly to being taunted about his blood status. Or his mother.”
“I can't beg?” Harry asked, widening his eyes innocently. His Alpha’s eyes flashed, and he smiled inwardly; Draco was
But Pickering just bared his teeth at him. “Stop fighting, little one. Your body betrays you. You want my bite. You want my knot.”
Ron shrugged. “Something about the man she loves not being on the opposite side of the war. And that she didn’t want to wait anymore.” He hiccupped softly. “I wonder if she’s written him yet.”
Apparently Umbridge had finished her little speech, and was settling back in her seat. Most of her audience’s eyes had glazed over, but she looked curiously content. Harry wondered apprehensively what she had to be so pleased about. Then she looked directly at him, and her smile widened.
. He was just grateful that Draco had turned him onto his hands and knees to knot him, and had then dropped off to sleep so quickly afterwards. He wasn’t sure he could have kept it from him, otherwise.
,” Malfoy moaned, desperate now. He scrabbled at Harry’s trousers, pulling them down to his knees before giving up, plunging three fingers into Harry’s wet, slick hole without any warning or preparation.
Hermione tuned them out, then. She wasn’t interested in Dumbledore’s justifications. She’d already heard that part of the story from Harry. She met Ron’s eyes instead, and was pleased to see his thoughts echoing her own. They edged towards the door and slipped through, and no one noticed except Dumbledore, who just smiled and turned back to the conversation.
“Fuck you,” Harry growled. “No fucking way. Maybe you should’ve thought about what you were doing before you bound your
happy. Happier than he could ever remember being. He held on a little tighter, and thrust his hips up.
Harry mouthed the words silently, and they left a sick taste at the back of his throat. “I want him out,” he said.
Harry, unsure of what she meant but curious, chose his words carefully.  “I’m not sure that’s something I should be discussing.”
Malfoy pointed at Harry and the dogs turned their attention to him, approaching him with the same lowered heads and wiggling torsos.  Harry took a step back uncertainly.
Harry quailed a little under the force of Snape’s gaze.  “What should I do then?  I don’t have a silver tongue like Draco.”
Harry looked up as someone entered the dormitory, it was Hermione.  They hadn't really had a chance to talk recently, Harry was busy with Draco and spent most of his time with him, Greg and Vince.  Hermione had gotten quite close to Pansy, enjoying watching the drama of Pansy’s on off relationship with Theo.
Harry did as he had been instructed.  The hound sniffed thoughtfully at Harry’s hand, and then lowered his chin onto it.  Harry stared at the handful of Wolfhound muzzle he held.
Malfoy’s cousins were a lot of fun.  Just watching them harass Blaise Zabini, with whom they seemed to be well acquainted, into a rage of hissing and spitting Italian made having dinner so much more enjoyable.  Even if Malfoy did have to spoil it by saying something placatory to Zabini in Italian and then leaning across to chastise his cousins in yet another language.
Harry felt his heart leap.  If Draco wasn’t here, surely this man would have simply shrugged and apologised.
"Sure, that's why you parade your Dark Marks around the place, making sure everyone knows about them with those ridiculous wrist ties." Ron just wouldn't give it up.
“And what has wonder-ferret come up with to get you out of this one, then?” They both knew what he was referring to.
Malfoy and Zabini turned to face one another and drew their wands.  Zabini smirked sardonically and bowed, Malfoy returned the gesture with an elegant flourish.  Then they levelled their wands at one another.
“Lorne and Barnaby, you will oversee disposal of the bodies,” he said. “Sandringham, the rebuilding process. You may choose your assistants. I want the Ministry operational by tomorrow morning. Rowle, you wiIl oversee our change in government. I’m sure our new Acting Minister for Magic will be
Her eyes widened, and she took the Healers to one side. After a furiously whispered conversation, they consented to let the matter rest; temporarily, at least. Harry was grateful. Their magic was not what was important right now.
Harry almost froze. But instinct overrode fear, and he whirled just in time. He sent a flurry of Bedazzling Hexes back, with a couple of Stinging Hexes. Rookwood was too dazzled by the lights to focus, and the Stinging Hexes made him drop his wand. Harry finished him off with a Stunner, then broke his wand.
McGonagall’s eyes widened, and she half-turned towards the other witch. “What?” But the wards crackled, and for a split second, the sound of the army roaring reverberated through the grounds. “Come on!” she shouted, and then they were running. Across the lawn, through the trees, down a small, winding path. Heading towards the gamekeeper’s hut, Pansy realised.
Pansy took her seat again to wait. Almost immediately, someone else settled into the chair opposite her. “So,” Daphne said. “I thought I would offer my congratulations on a game well played.”
Harry started to shake his head, but Hermione said, “He’s right, Harry. A sacrifice like that would be meaningless; even selfish. What about everyone who loves you? What about Draco? You’d be leaving us behind to grieve you for the rest of our lives, and for no good reason, if he really can do this.”
On his other side, Draco leaned into his shoulder, yawning. Harry sighed. “It’ll be all right,” he murmured, to both of them.
“You keep saying that, but it’s not up to you!” Harry snapped back. “It’s not up to anyone but me, and I’m not going to let Voldemort take over the world because I was too afraid to do the right thing!”
“They’re all fine,” Draco assured him. “Look. Dumbledore and McGonagall are working on it.” He was pointing to the other side of the hall, where the door stood wide open. Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall stood on the threshold, wands out and chanting. Oddly, no one from the Entrance Hall was attempting to escape through it, as if for some reason it was invisible to them. Behind them peered several students, looking frightened, but not like those in the Entrance Hall. Not frantic with terror.
“I know he can,” his counterpart said softly, resting a tentative hand on Harry’s arm. Harry didn’t jerk away, and his other self gripped his arm more firmly, confident now. “And I’m going to show you.”
“Draco Malfoy,” Cardosa said, startling him. He whirled to see the man standing in the doorway. Of course. This was his memory. “Consider this your final warning. Your mother has already paid the price for your failures to date. If you fail our lord again, the lovely Narcissa will be given to the lower ranks to satiate them, and if she survives, well… Yaxley has been a little bored recently.”
He lowered himself onto his belly to lay his head next to Harry’s body. The thump of his body hitting the ground reverberated through the forest floor, shaking Harry so that his hand fell against Draco’s snout.
Harry set his jaw, but didn’t put up any further protest. After all, Snape could hardly watch Malfoy twenty-four hours a day. He jumped off the bed and waited until Malfoy’s eyes turned to meet his. “I’ll find Parkinson,” he promised, and nodded at the slightly-crushed box of chocolates on the bedside table. “For you,” he said. “Sorry about the blood.”
that. The only reason I could stomach it was by thinking of this moment, when I’d be able to look you in the eye and know that you were seeing me, finally, for who I really am. And I am
. Draco had brought him presents! And cake! It was a novelty he didn’t think he’d ever get over, no matter how long he lived.
– “I’ve got you, I’ve got you,” Fred muttered, and George realised he was being cradled in his twin’s arms. He wondered how they’d ended up on the ground.
Harry responded mostly on instinct, on the defensive with his spells now. Nott fell under a barrage of curses. Daphne screamed. An explosion behind them sent Harry reeling. Pain seared across his back. He almost lost his hold on McGonagall.
, something that all the spells and potions in Madam Pomfrey’s supply couldn’t do alone. It meant time. “How long have I been asleep?”
Next to Elphias, Hestia whimpered. He groped for her hand, gripping it tightly. “Shh,” he whispered. “Quiet, child.”
At six o’clock the next morning, he slipped into the common room, carrying a large, empty tray, and two carefully wrapped packages in silver paper with green bows. He took the hallway to the left, sloping down into the depths of Hogwarts.
It took a moment to sink in, and then Harry blew out a hard breath. “Thank fucking Merlin,” he said. Somehow he doubted Snape would ever forgive him for making him lose control like that, but at least there wouldn’t be any long-term consequences. “He’s still going to kill me,” he decided, and Draco nipped his ear hard enough that he yelped in surprise.
Still, Harry thought it was a good thing they had so many ‘free’ periods this year, or there was no way he would have managed to complete even half of the homework they were being assigned. It seemed the closer they got to the exams, the more work was piled on, and he hadn’t counted on this many detentions.
The walls of Azkaban were grey and unyielding; slabs of great stone with narrow slits for windows that allowed the wind to whistle through the cells. Waves crashed against the walls, and occasionally he was hit with a spray of salt water. There were no doors that a prisoner could use to escape. He had one blanket, which did little to relieve the unrelenting cold. His body ached with it, drowning out the hunger and the tormenting itch of the number tattooed on his neck.
She gave him a knowing look, and tucked her hand into the crook of his arm. “You know, Harry, I’ve seen the way Malfoy looks at you. I don’t think it’ll be as hard as you think.”
Ron frowned. “I think it does,” he said. “You’re the Chosen One. You’re not going to die, Harry. The prophecy says you have the power to kill him.”
Greene threw himself in front of McGonagall. Draco shouted, pointing at them. His pixies shrieked, diving in attack formation. Bellatrix saw them too late. They started biting, pinching, burrowing into her robes. She screamed in rage, fighting to fling them off.
Hermione nodded. “There wasn’t enough Felix Felicis to go around. Bill gave the last swallow to Daphne, instead of taking it himself. It probably saved her life. You should have seen her, Harry. They broke her back, her neck was twisted... it was awful. Bill saved her life.”
Malfoy ran a hand through his hair. “Fine,” he said distractedly. “Thanks, Greg.” He started to turn, to go back inside.
Harry glared at him, but didn’t respond. Dumbledore was surprised. Not too long ago, Harry would have snapped back at such a taunt.
Draco growled. He didn’t want to think about his mother, or his task, or the fate that awaited his family if he failed. He didn’t want to think about whatever the fuck was going on with their magic. He just wanted to
Their bond was singing with love and joy and forgiveness. The jagged hole inside him had been filled; not perfectly, because he had ripped his magic out, and that was a wound that would perhaps never heal. But what was within him now was better than anything he could have imagined, because Draco was no longer a presence on the other side of the bond. He was
Draco’s eyes widened. “Are you saying you can get items out of the Manor, without going back in?” Narcissa nodded, tilting her head in question. “Could you get a book out of the library? One specific book? Without alerting the Dark Lord to its disappearance?”
“And that is an admirable attitude, my dear boy,” Dumbledore sighed. “I just wish your concern for his welfare had led you to confide in me earlier. This game of smoke and mirrors you have been playing with Mr Malfoy could have destroyed him. It may still.” Harry bit down on his instinctive protest, waiting. “I know this will be hard for you, but you must tell him that it is over between you, as soon as possible.”
“Fine, fine,” Trelawney said, fanning herself as she came closer. Pansy frowned as she caught the smell of sherry again. “Are you sure you were not followed?”
“Of course not,” Draco said. “There are ways that we could trap it, and force it into something of our choosing. A runic circle, for example. If we made you uninhabitable somehow, it would have no choice but to go where we wanted.”
Draco opened his mouth against Harry's nape, biting down gently, his teeth a warning. Harry whimpered and squirmed, and Draco shushed him, soothing gentle hands down his sides. “Of course not, Harry. How many times do I have to tell you? You're mine. Say it.”
save by our one and only Dean Thomas! An unexpected line-up this game for Gryffindor, but one that’s working like a charm! 300 to 130 now, with Gryffindor most definitely in the lead!”
“I’m glad you feel this is relevant to the current situation, Mr Malfoy, Mr Potter,” Snape said dryly, “but if I might suggest we continue this conversation safely
Draco knew what he needed. Hogwarts was as injured and scarred as its defenders. Healing it would take both of them. Air and Earth, Light and Dark. Life and order from death and chaos.
Hermione looked outraged. “So you’re saying these ‘White Mages’ were never formally studied because the Malfoys kept Jeremiah’s work to themselves?”
“She forbade me to ask him about it,” Tonks said, shrugging. “And it’s no excuse for bad behaviour, of course. But I think there’s more to him than meets the eye.”
“That’s not good enough!” Dawlish cried. “The Malfoy boy’s corrupted him, Minister! Made him as evil as any Death Eater – as You-Know-Who himself!”
“If I want to be treated like an adult, then I have to take responsibility for my actions,” Harry interrupted. “All my actions, good and bad. And if I really am the Chosen One – the one who has to kill Voldemort – then I shouldn’t be kept out of the loop like I’m a kid. I’m not, anymore. I haven’t been for a long time.”
They stared at each other, and Ginny’s face slowly turned beet-red. “I have to go,” she said quickly, and ran out of the room.
“I did no such thing,” Draco scoffed, trying to hide how shaken he was. “Are you hearing voices now?”
“If it was your mother who had been murdered, do you think you would have been capable of thinking about anything else?”
“Merlin, no,” Draco said, involuntarily. He glanced at the Gryffindor table despite himself. Potter was there, after all, holding court with his usual crowd of adoring fans. He looked a little pale, and Draco liked the thought that his words had made an impact on him. Otherwise, he was as appallingly gorgeous as always.
to get this right, to make it better between them. “I told you the bond is symbiotic, yes? You access Air Magic through me, and you can draw as much as you want through me. As much as you can handle, which is apparently a hell of a lot more than we thought.”
?” Dawlish interrupted, in a shrill voice. He was crouched in the corner of the room with his arms over his head, looking terrified; not so very different from everyone else, Harry realised. Even Dumbledore looked thoroughly shaken. “Where’s Jordan? Where’s my partner?”
“You believe his arrogance will be his downfall,” Blaise mused. “He will lose, in the end, whether or not Potter is the Chosen One.”
“They are doing what they can,” Dumbledore said, gently. “And though I do not agree with every action Scrimgeour’s administration has taken, he is trying, at least. This is a difficult time. I fear Miss Delacour was right. More and more of those in positions of power are being corrupted.”
He buried his knuckles in his eyes, fighting back a moan. There was something horribly, horribly wrong with him. He
“We can’t,” he gasped. “If we can get them alone somehow, we can talk to them, convince them to defect with us. But not now. Not in front of everyone. They’ll be forced to take us to
, but he couldn’t make sense of the words. There was a roaring in his ears, and, horribly, he could feel himself starting to harden.
And then there was Harry. He hadn’t seen Harry for an entire day, and night – twice. He hadn’t even appeared at breakfast.
, Pansy! She was my whole world! And she’s been shoved somewhere out of fucking sight in the infirmary, with no one watching over her. She had
He turned, mouth dropping open in surprise. “Mr Malfoy,” he said, bewildered. “But you don’t have detention with me.” He paused. “Do you?”
The pain subsided after a moment, but it left him shivering uncontrollably. He struggled to get his feet under him, to take the strain off his arms, but even that small movement had tears squeezing out of the corners of his eyes. His nerves felt so hypersensitive that the brush of air as Voldemort circled him had him jerking violently away.
,” he begged, tears slipping down his face, voice cracking as he scrabbled to pull away. But Harry just did it again, and again, and the spell inside him came back to life, fucking him again, until Draco thought he’d lose his mind, unable to think or breathe or even remember how to form words. He just shook, sobbing, pleasure and pain merging until he could no longer tell one from the other, and Harry was losing his rhythm, hips rocking erratically –
“Oh,” she said, flushing. “No, I –” Harry tilted his head slightly in question, and she sighed. “Actually, it’s going pretty well at the moment.”
“Miss Granger,” Robards said. “You seem like a highly intelligent young woman, despite your youth. Do you honestly believe jealousy would play the greater role in this alleged attack, when the defendant had just suffered the loss of his mother and young sister?”
Ron and Hermione appeared, first. Harry smiled at them, even as he looked past them. Ginny followed them in, with Parvarti and Padma on her heels, and then –
“So do I,” Draco agreed. He fingered a strand of Harry’s hair, tugging at it gently. “Sure I can’t convince you to run away with me? We could go with my mother to France.” The corner of his mouth curled up, mischief dancing in his eyes. “I could speak French all the time. I noticed how much you liked that.”
, and then Malfoy settled against him again; warm, clean, and sweet-smelling. Harry buried his face in the soft white-blond hair, inhaling deeply. “Rumour has it that you’re going to speak for Finch-Fletchley at the trial.”
There was an undeniably strange undercurrent to the conversation, but Draco’s mind was suddenly solely occupied with a chain of ideas. On his behalf – proxy – or rather, a substitute. Substitution. Or – a
, later. Still, maybe he could turn it around. It was a good plan; even the Dark Lord had said so. Everyone else had been stumped when Atwood sent word that the children were being protected in the Room of Requirement. But Vince knew about the Room. His father had been so proud.
“I’m sorry, Draco, I'm –” he said quickly, but it was too late. Draco’s eyes were suddenly black, and he stripped the bedspread off in one smooth, efficient motion, pinning Harry’s hands above his head before he’d even really registered his Alpha had moved. “Draco –”
Of course, Pansy would probably look at him with that beautiful crinkle between her brows and tell him that of course he could walk on air, if he wanted; there was a spell for that. That was the trouble with having a magical mam and a Muggle dad. He was forever using the wrong expressions with the wrong people. Like when he’d accidentally asked his older and much larger Muggle cousin what had his wand in a knot. Apparently Muggles interpreted ‘wand’ as something very different indeed. His backside had been sore for days.
, in the midst of that excruciating agony, that when it’s all over, you will have given me the power to take over the world.”
The smoke quickly made breathing impossible. Dumbledore cast the Bubble-Head Charm, and Alastor and Dawlish followed suit. It made it easier to continue, but by the time they reached the bottom of the stairwell, the smoke was so dense that he couldn’t see his hand in front of his face. Sweat was dripping down his beard. He felt for the door handle, and removed his hand hastily as it burned his fingertips.
, mate. Alphas go nuts over you. Bonkers. Didn’t you see them in DADA? And that was just the beginning of your heat. It’s supposed to be –” he looked embarrassed, but there was a definite hint of jealousy in his voice, “the best sex

for the reasons you think. She seems extraordinarily protective of him. I think she really does just want to help him defect.”
Draco placed two, trembling hands carefully on the Vanishing Cabinet, bowed his head against the smooth surface, and closed his eyes.
to see it.” He shook his head. “You know I love Dumbledore. But he has never been completely honest with me, and I have to accept that this year is no different. He’s still feeding me information when and how he thinks I need it, never mind the consequences. And there are always consequences. We’ve seen that time and again. I don’t doubt his good intentions, but –”

And then they go their separate ways, and find mates of their own. And if they ever come across their brothers or sisters again, they’re the most affectionate creatures you’ve ever seen.”
. A giant had just punched through the heavy, wrought-iron gates. He began to pound his fists against the wards. All of the professors immediately focused their wands in that direction. Harry panicked. He didn’t know much about wards, but with the Death Eaters already attacking, and the dome not complete… could the giant –?
But Ron looked like he’d reached his limit already, and, worse, Hermione’s eyes were bright and curious, watching them with a slightly disturbing fascination. Pansy was the only one who looked completely, politely, disinterested. Thank Salazar for Slytherins, anyway.
Relieved and a little confused, Harry reached out for him again. This time, Draco allowed the embrace. “But you’re all right now?” he asked.
to be with him, in every possible way. To protect him. And somehow it was that much worse, now they were forbidden from intimate contact.
Harry frowned, looking around. And then it sunk in. The body she was standing over, that mangled piece of flesh and blood – that was
” Draco screamed, and Harry found himself cut off, left with only what he had already managed to draw through Draco. It didn’t matter. It was enough. But Draco forced him around, shaking him. “It’s NOT REAL!” he cried. Harry blinked, struggling to focus on him. “It’s a curse! Whatever you’re seeing,
“Pansy,” he greeted her. He was lying on his bed, staring up at the canopy, wand in hand. “Do come in, darling.”
Draco shook his head. “The ‘gangers have a limited amount of interactivity, but more than enough to fool Filch and conclude the detention on their own.”
Harry closed his eyes. “You ground me, you know,” he murmured, nosing at the juncture of Draco’s neck and shoulder. He found the bruised flesh where he’d marked Draco during their DADA exam and worried it with his teeth, sucking gently but insistently.
Harry winced, looking away. “He forced our hand. I didn’t want to die. I wanted to keep my promise to you. But I just – I couldn’t risk you. The heart-bond changed everything. The Resolution Potion showed me that the only way to stop you dying with me was to make sure it perished when I did. Giving you my magic prevented the ritual from succeeding, and with nothing connecting us when I died, you would have been free.”
Harry stared at him. He’d caught the Snitch several times with moves not too dissimilar to the ones Draco had just used. Draco had to know that. And yet… he’d always been so restrained on the pitch. Harry would bet a pile of galleons on it being fear of failure. Specifically, fear of failing his father. Which was ironic, because Draco had always been the most challenging of Harry’s opponents. If he lost that debilitating fear, he might actually win.
“He wasn’t the only one in the wrong,” she said. “I had no right to scold him like that.” She drew in a shaky breath, more tears springing unbidden to her eyes. “We just fight so much, Harry. It’s how we’ve always been, and I love him. I love
‘A month ago’, it said, ‘the wizarding world was rocked by the news that the war had been won by two schoolboys: Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, and Draco Malfoy, son of notorious Death Eater Lucius Malfoy. The terrible Dark Lord Voldemort, once known as Tom Riddle, had been summarily defeated, brought low by magic never seen before in the history of wizarding-kind. Rejoicing was quickly followed by questions, and quite rightly, concern. Had we just exchanged one Dark Lord for two?’
Amabel Lee, a seventh-year prefect and the last one to head up, touched his arm as she passed. “Professor McGonagall will be up soon,” she said, glancing at Hermione.
Draco sighed. “Fine. The bloody Mirror.” He let his head fall back against the wall, visibly gathering his thoughts. Harry waited patiently. “It has the power to show the many paths the future might take, each one branching off from decisions we make. Pansy asked it to show her mine, starting from whether to open the Cabinet or not. The first path… I didn’t. You advocated for me with Dumbledore, but the mission to rescue my mother failed.”
you healed the worst of it.” Of course, Draco hadn’t healed all of it. He liked the bruises on Harry, liked how his Omega couldn’t help tracing them in the mirror, or jerking off to the dull ache in his arse. “Eleven
‘There has been much speculation since then, and calls for an inquiry into the events of June seventh. This reporter has done what the Wizengamot has so far failed to do: namely, uncover the truth about the power Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy possess, and how they did what they did that night.’
Pansy frowned. Theo was one of the most eligible bachelors of their age; fifteenth-generation pureblood, sole heir to the Nott fortune, and his parents had been loyal Death Eaters since the first war. He’d be swamped with offers, the day he turned seventeen. “What in Salazar’s name could your parents object to?”
“Yes, you are,” Draco said, possessively. “Mine to fuck. Mine to knot. Mine to breed with as I please… but also mine to protect. The Dark Lord won’t lay a
Elphias startled. “Calm yourself, my dear,” he murmured. Of course, he echoed the sentiment. Dolores had betrayed them all. After that debacle at Hogwarts two years ago, she’d been extremely lucky to get her job back. Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic was a privileged position. And then she’d turned her wand on the Minister, on
to some other source? Certainly I had not realised you had the ability to fool Albus Dumbledore. Tell me, how did you convince him to let you bring Potter on this ‘rescue mission’?”
Behind her came Neville and Luna. Then Colin and Dennis Creevy, arm in arm. They looked a bit teary, and Harry fervently hoped there wouldn’t be a repeat of Lavender’s unexpected embrace. Then Ernie Macmillan, and Zach Smith. Katie Bell. Susan Bones. Hannah Abbott. So many people. His friends, older members of the DA. Several Slytherins, some he hardly knew.
“The curse is slowly sapping my strength,” he explained. “It takes more and more effort to perform magic that once came easily to me. Even the most simple wandless magic is now beyond my capabilities.”
“I said I would kill them if you didn’t come. I never said I’d let them go if you did,” the Dark Lord said, with predictable relish. Lucius honestly couldn’t understand how his son could have allied himself with someone so stupid. Of
“Was it You-Know-Who, professor?” Seamus called out. His face was blotchy and tear-stained, and he was gripping Dean’s shoulder with white knuckles.
Dumbledore ignored him. “Harry, my boy,” he said, “I have made mistakes. I acknowledge that. But I do hope you do not let my mistakes blind you to the truth of yourself. Your bravery, strength and determination to do what’s right are not the result of some sort of
“I hope I have more control over myself than to attack a student, my boy,” Dumbledore said, gravely. “However, as your heat progresses, I could not vouch for all of my professors, and certainly not your fellow students, who are far more vulnerable to your scent.”
The words sent a slow flush of pleasure through her. “I love you, too.” His eyes lit up, and she said quickly, “It doesn’t mean anything. It can’t.”
Six years old, in the middle of the war, and his uncles Fabian and Gideon had taken it upon themselves to teach him what to do if a Death Eater ever grabbed him. Just throw a tantrum mid-air, and keep wriggling until they had to let you go.
“I don’t have time for this,” Draco chided, even as he tilted his head obligingly. “I’ve had a good night’s sleep, like you wanted. I need to heal myself, and go back to last night. I’ll meet you here in less than a minute. You won’t even miss me.”
He felt Harry smile against his back. “Come on,” he murmured, pulling out. He turned to sit up against the headboard, his knees bent. “Sit,” he demanded.
Draco sobered, but Harry could still feel his bubbling happiness in the corner of his mind, and he relaxed. Draco wasn't angry with him. “Yes, you should have,” his Alpha said. “But it's my fault you didn't. I hurt you. I breached your trust. I know that will take time to rebuild.”
Draco scowled at him. “Before you pinned me against the wall and talked me into an orgasm?” he said scathingly. “
Seamus sighed. “He's in trouble, isn’t he? You had to send the letter, or he’d be dead. Same with this one.”
“You know there is,” Harry chided, and Draco gave a great sob of relief. He lunged forward, grabbing Harry’s face in his hands and kissing him desperately. Harry dug his fingers into Draco’s hips, hard enough to bruise. He
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” Draco said, breaths coming quick and harsh, chest heaving against Harry’s. “Your magic  –”
The chin that jutted out, defiant. Those sweetly pouting lips, pressed firmly together. Those grey eyes, the colour of the storm in Harry’s soul, alight with challenge and interest. He wanted Harry to lose his temper. Or rather, he wanted Harry to react. He wanted to see what Harry would do.
“I told him about your ‘escape clause’,” Draco said. “In case you were thinking you could still manipulate him into dying somehow.”
“Here,” he said, handing a vial of Polyjuice each to his father and Atwood. “Harper and Mayberry. I’ll take Redcombe.”
Narcissa wracked her mind for his name. She knew he’d been hit with a Bone-Crushing Curse, painful and almost impossible to treat while the patient was sedated. She knew his mother hadn’t come; she was a single mother, and couldn’t leave her other children. But his name… “Sweetheart,” she said. He didn’t look at her. “Sweetheart,” she tried again.
“It’s called the Nightmare Curse,” Draco said. He threaded his fingers through Harry’s hair, petting him gently. “You knew it was a possibility the Dark Lord could have invaded Hogwarts, but your mind had to work with what it had in front of you. You saw Weasley fall, and the curse gave you the worst possible interpretation for it. The ingenuity and yet limitation of the curse. It must work within the confines of what you know to be the truth.”
Harry grinned down at him, wriggling his fingers, and Draco watched them turn slick with lube. Harry reached behind himself deliberately, and Draco’s breath caught in his throat.
Voldemort hadn’t invaded his mind at all this year. Dumbledore thought he was actively avoiding contact, after what had happened in the Ministry last year. But that didn’t mean Harry could afford to be complacent. On the contrary. Sirius would never have died if he’d just paid a little more attention in his Occlumency lessons.
Harry blushed, and George, who never strayed far from his twin’s side these days, chuckled. “I reckon you’re right, Freddie.”
“Mm,” Draco said. He looked still tired, even after a good night’s sleep. His cheeks were hollow, lines of tension at the corners of his mouth and eyes. “Like calls to like.”
The clock had long past struck midnight by the time Pansy heard the unmistakable sounds of a person trying to creep, unsuccessfully, down the hall towards her. Stepping out into the middle of the hall, she called quietly, “Professor Trelawney?”
Harry grimaced. “Yeah.” The Horcruxes were almost as dangerous as Voldemort himself; perhaps even more so. After all, the ring had defeated Dumbledore, the strongest wizard Harry knew. The wizard even
“Good,” Harry said. Suddenly his shoulders were squared, his face grim, like a general on the eve of battle. That aura of power Draco had always sensed settled on him like a mantle, and Draco felt fear crawl up his throat.
“My son would never murder a man like that,” Narcissa said. Harry turned to look at her. Pansy had helped her into the chair by the door, and she sat straight and tall, hands clasped in her lap. Her ordeal had made her sickly and fragile, but her grey eyes were determined. “The Dark Lord ordered him to kill Dumbledore. He threatened him with my death and his own, but even then, my boy couldn’t go through with it. He is a child, Minister. Not yet seventeen. His heart is innocent, untainted with the evil my husband brought into our home. He had no choice but to accept the Dark Mark, and he has committed no crimes since then that have brought lasting ill-effect to others. When he was given the chance to defect – when Mr Potter reached out to him – Draco chose to defect, and fought alongside those protecting the school. He is not a murderer.”
“It’s okay, Harry,” Hermione interrupted. “That’s not what this is about. Really. Come and sit down. Let them explain.”
it. It was proof he was owned, proof he was loved; not just a mark on his skin but a brand, a physical representation of their bond. “Bite me,” he said, and Draco growled, fixing his teeth around Harry’s pulse point with an eagerness that told him he’d chosen right.
“Is that what this is about, Mr Potter?” said a girlish voice. He stiffened, glaring up at Umbridge. “After all, you yourself have used an Unforgivable in the past, have you not? The very same Unforgivable, in fact, that Mr Finch-Fletchley has been accused of using. And yet you went unpunished for it. Do you feel that you should be punished? That you are, indeed, no better than You-Know-Who and his followers?”
was the man-whore, thank you very much, as well as a filthy, cock-sucking traitor, which was going way too far, and Harry hexed her silent.
on my part. You are an incredible young man. A Gryffindor at heart, no matter what the Sorting Hat once thought. I may have sent the sword to you, but it would not have allowed itself to be drawn from the Sorting Hat by anyone who was not true and noble of heart. Your bravery continues to astound and humble me. Not many wizards would have been willing to venture into the lair of a basilisk, even for a friend. Certainly very few twelve-year-olds.”
Harry looked at his feet, where Draco had burned a runic circle into the wooden floor. “What is this?”
He thought he saw a flash of anger in Dumbledore’s eyes. The old wizard looked down at his hands, long fingers twisting together. He took a slow, calming breath. “Harry,” he said, eventually. “I forget, sometimes, how well you know me. You’re right, of course. I let my pride get the better of me; something I have spent my whole life trying to prevent. It was an old man’s folly, to want my death to be meaningful in some way. And, in truth, the stakes were far greater than simply my death. Maintaining Professor Snape’s cover, most importantly.” He looked at Harry again, blue eyes piercing. “You cannot understand just how much he has already contributed to the war effort. Everything might already be lost were it not for him. And I wished to prevent Mr Malfoy from taking the first step down the path his father had carved for him, and to help
His Alpha growled, low in his throat, but it was a reaction borne of instinct, and he brought it under control quickly. “I couldn’t do it, Harry,” he said, with difficulty. “I wanted to kill him, but he apologised, and I couldn’t do it. And then I heard you calling for me –”
More Death Eaters followed, pressing their advantage. The line of shields was failing. Nott’s father was fighting with them. So was Lucius Malfoy, of all people. But it wasn’t enough. It would be a mêlée in a minute.
The window shattered inwards. Draco was slammed backwards, into the fireplace. He gasped, grabbing for something,
,” Draco stressed. “For some reason, I thought we were past the ‘are you completely mental?’ stage of our relationship, but clearly not. Have you forgotten the last time we went into the forest together?”
Harry nodded. He hadn’t expected such candor from her, but then again, she was the one who had orchestrated this whole plan. She was uniquely invested in the outcome.
Rowle was up. Bellatrix was waking Yaxley. Greyback had fought free of the cage, and had re-taken his human form, yellow teeth gleaming in the torchlight. But that wasn’t what had Draco’s heart trying to beat out of his chest.
, if you defect, I’ll be there. I’ll protect you, from both sides. And so will Dumbledore. He’s trustworthy. If you ever find yourself in a situation where – where you need to trust him, you can. I want you to remember that. I just can’t be with you, anymore.”
“Ew,” Harry said, not long later (and a long time later), and the sound of his own voice startled him awake. He sat up quickly, and cried out in pain, every inch of his body protesting. “Oh Merlin, oh Merlin,” he panted, fighting to control his breathing when it hurt to suck in even a partial lungful of air, and he was on the verge of a panic attack.
