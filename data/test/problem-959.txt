“Can he break through the wards on the bus?” Harry asked Draco, his wand out as he glared defiantly up at the mad man above them.
Their voices started to get closer and Harry backed slowly away from the corner.  He was desperate to hear but really did not want to get caught.
Everyone has things they just can't handle reading.  Don't feel bad if you need to skip a section for your mental health.  This is supposed to be fun.  If it's not fun, don't do it.
“No, I understand exactly how hard it is to be anywhere near Dragons.” Ron protested.
Harry rolled his eyes.  “Lucius is not dumb.  Sit quiet for two years, or break out and get hunted for the rest of his life.  With the prison reforms, it’s not like that’s a hard call.”
“Is that from Charlie?” Harry asked, coming up behind Ron and leaning over his shoulder.
“Yes, I know.”
“Draco did, but that’s not common knowledge.” Harry confirmed.  “It’s one of the reasons he got off with such a light sentence even after he let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts.  With Rookwood out it would be best to keep that information under your hat if you would.”
“...bribed,” Harry acknowledged, “you into setting the two of us up on a ‘blind date’.  An unexpected dinner with your ex is not a blind date, Ron.”
Arthur just blinked at him for a moment.  “Umm… what would that look like?”
After a bit Harry cleared his throat and asked with a forced smile, “Fred and George still out selling you two to one?”
Rookwood’s face dropped the good natured grin, true anger showing for the first time.  “Antonin.”
Harry quirked a small grin.  “Playing devil’s advocate?”
“These two,” Draco said, his tone ladened with disgust, “are singing.”
“Absolutely.  You’re perfect.”  Ron laughed bitterly and looked away. Harry grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him a little.  “Listen to me, you are perfect.  Perfect for me.  You know how the Dursleys treated me, ignoring me, turning me into little more than a servant.  I’d never had a friend until I met you.  I had years of neglect and feeling worthless and unloved.  I had a hole the size of Hogwarts inside me when we first met.  You filled that in a way no one else could.  You wanted to be around me, sought me out, made me feel special and important and needed.  No one had ever made me feel that way before.”
“You’re smiling.”
“Senior or Junior this time?”
“Draco,” Harry said after a moment to gather his courage.  “May I call you Draco?”
The smile cooled.  “Ron said you were still a pain in the arse.  I’m Charlie. The one who works with dragons.  The one it is smart not to tick off.”
The whole thing was crazy.  Harry Potter was a war hero.  A couple of months ago, the Daily Prophet had listed him as their number one pick for most eligible bachelor.  Draco had not even made the list.  He was a nobody in comparison, an outcast forced to play stupid games with Aurors and the Wizengamot just to keep his dignity.  Surely Draco’s life was too much of a mess … surely Draco himself was too broken for Harry to have any interest in him.
He was wearing a golden shirt that flowed, undone down to the navel and tight enough in all the right places to leave little to the imagination. Draco’s chest was smooth and nicely curved. He didn’t have Harry’s washboard abs but there was nothing extra on the tuck of his flat tummy. Forest green velvet pants, tied at the waist with a wide sash that shimmered like silk in the club lights and leather boots completed the look. He seemed to transcend common concepts like gender. It was like a godling, one of the heroes of Greek legend, brother to Apollo, friend of Hercules and Perseus, had stepped out of the legends of the ancient past to grace them with his presence.
No, the time to approach Draco Malfoy is after he has been forced to work in the Muggle world, to do the manual labor he will be forced into without a wand or the resources of his family wealth.  A few months should be all it will take to break that lovely spirit.  Until then, I will simply live in anticipation of having such a passionate young man under my thumb.
“You should get used to calling him Draco.”  Ron had been thrilled at Harry’s abrupt change of heart over the young head of Slytherin.
“Damn,” Harry said and bolted for the garage.
“I told you,” Ron said, still sounding upset.
“Oh yeah, what’s he up to?” And if Harry leaned forward a bit too largely, Ron did not mention it.
Of course thinking of Robards lead him to remember his own obsession with Draco Malfoy.  At the time his obsession with his rival classmate had been almost as intense as his focus on Voldemort, but his interest in the Dark Lord had died with him, while Draco Malfoy would still arise from time to time to haunt his thoughts.
Ron blinked back at Harry, and then nodded.
“That’s great,” Ron said, obviously confused.  Whatever point Malfoy was trying to make was going over his head and Harry’s too for that matter.
Draco and Pansy exchanged a look.  “They should have mind healers here in town,” Draco protested.
“Not much,” Ron muttered and they all laughed.
‘Kids?’ Harry mouthed at Draco, who shrugged back.
“You’re wrong, Robards.  They are good, not just good, they’re great.  I’m not going to get into an argument with you about how that came to be, that’s just the way it is.  They are not cheating, the level of attention the ‘Sly’ band is receiving is perfectly reasonable given the performance.”  Potters volume started to go up at the end.
“Why don’t you go find Ms. Lockhart?” Harry upped his volume.
“Now wait until the light hits her full in the face,” Charlie cautioned.
“No!  What …?”  Harry hadn’t expected the band to be happy they were there, but surely this was over the top.
My hand tightens on my wand.  The anger that I have fought to control rears up and I grind my teeth against the curses on my tongue.  This little man, who ran in fear when faced with true power, has insulted my Lord, my people and my cause.  I shake in place at the effort to restrain violence.
“And I thought your obsession with Draco was bad fifth year.  You got nothing on Robards.” Ron said, leaning back and stretching out a bit as he warmed to his subject.
“Chamber of Secrets,” George answered her, reaching to take it back.
He would trust Harry.
Draco nodded.
“Hey,” he said softly bumping Ron’s shoulder.
Buried beneath mounds of paperwork are two owls from Harry, one from his dad, another from Charlie and three from his mother.  He will get to them, he will, just a couple more reports to review first.
The words were lost to Harry, but the anger and passion was not.  He snapped shot after shot of the amazing energy that was Pansy and then turned his camera to the crowd as he realized how many of them knew every word, mouthing, singing, screaming along with her as she drove them into an even greater frenzy of energy and passion.
“Just tell him yourself, mate,” Ron replied.
Charlie laughed and Draco warmed at the fact that he had known Draco was teasing rather than assuming he was serious, no matter the absurdity of the statement.  The Horntail vibrated behind Draco, as though responding to Charlie’s laughter.  The sound it made could almost be mistaken for a purr if it was not coming from a 200 stone lizard.  Draco looked up and again found the dragon looking back.  He had to admit that the terror of being in the regard of such a large and dangerous creature did ease with exposure.  He was about to say as much when Charlie groaned.  “Speak of the devil.”
“Right, yes.  We’ve been tracking the disappearing kids for the last couple weeks.  One of my buddy’s siblings got caught up in this mess and disappeared on him.  We had gotten a tip about this place and were organizing a group to check it out when Neville showed up with news of Harry taking off after your tour bus like a bat out of hell and then the whole thing disappearing.”
“Both of you are halfway decent artists,” Blaise continued.
“The last time you tried setting me up it was because your mother could not accept mine and Ginny’s break up.  She blackmailed …”
“Yeah, but not when the bus was going to arrive, or that the band members had a habit of sneaking out of  the bus.  My gut says it was too coincidental to be an accident.”
“I don’t know anything about drums or music or anything!” Greg protested.
Rather than putting him off, the whole incident had made Harry more convinced than ever that he wanted a relationship with Draco Malfoy.
“She won’t hear it from me.”
Ron sat hunched over his desk in his brand new office, the halls beyond echoing in the way empty buildings do after hours.  Two weeks in and this had already become a habit, the last one to leave at night and the first one in the next morning.
Hermione laughed, “Oh Ron, Robards was one of our regulars.  Your old boss was down here with us practically every night.  Trust me, with this kind of job, you never get on top of the paperwork.”  She pushed the door open to the refectory and walked in.
Draco, like his father, was found guilty of aiding and abetting the Dark Lord by the highest magical court in Britain, as though that were something of which to be ashamed.  Unlike his father, his youth saved him from the confines of Azkaban, although Lucius’ connections saved him from serving more than two years.  Today is the young Malfoy’s sentencing.  I wait and watch in the cold rain while inside the fools in power push him right into my arms.
That was it.  That was the last straw.  “I’m going to my room,” Draco announced.  “Please come get me when the world has once again returned to normal.”  He dropped the picture he was holding back onto the table and swept out.
“I handled things badly,” Malfoy said, sounding frustrated.
“They’re good?”  Harry guesses.
“Alright, then.  I guess if you’re not heading to the Apparition point there is no point waiting for you.  We’ll keep you posted if we find anything.”  Neville clapped Harry on the back and headed out.
“Nope.  You took on Dolohov, single handed, if you don’t count his entourage.”  Ron confirmed.
“Nope,” Ron said, calm as ever.  “I honestly have no idea what you’re on about.”
Shacklebolt slapped Ron on the shoulder and then made his escape.  Ron’s bit of a smile disappeared completely when he looked back down at Pansy.  “It’s just a promotion,” he tried to explain.
“Yes!  Wait, that sounds like something that came with it.  Just a moment.”  Sure enough, a few minutes later Harry had the power cord and a couple of additional lenses packed away with the camera in a nice case slung over his shoulder.  “What did you say you needed it for again?”  Arthur asked as the two men turned to go.
Still, there was only so much of being cooped up that a girl could take before she just had to go shopping.  The tour bus pulled in as the first rays of the sun were coming out.  Manchester was too big a city to ever really sleep, but the early morning was as close as it came and Pansy took full advantage of the new town and the hope that their fans had not yet figured out that they had moved.
To all of you waiting patiently for me to finish before reading:  I'm close!  Only 2 chapters to go.
“He’s not as bad as all that, not really.  I know you lot all had your rough times at school but that’s all behind us now.  Those of us who survived have to pull together if we don’t want the next generation having to fight the same wars over again.”
Draco felt like Harry had hit him.  All the air left his lungs in a hard exhale as he tried to comprehend what Harry wanted.  ‘But you’re going to die, you barmy prat.’  The thought pounded in his brain, trying to get out past his empty lungs.  ‘Don’t make me watch you die,’ he pleaded into the awful nothingness of his own mind.
It was a conversation, Harry realized.  Malfoy and the crowd singing to each other and there were people around him who knew every word.
Harry wanted to reach out to him, to catch one slender hand and not let go.  He stumbleed a few steps closer, feeling awkward and uncoordinated.  “Who do you think will win the game tonight?”  He rushed the delivery, cutting off his companion before he could speak.
“Do?” asked Ron.
Blaise blinked at him.  “Draco.  We’re a band.  Singing is what we do.”
“Yes, I thought so,” Rookwood’s mild voice jabbed into Draco like knives, stilling the numbness away like blood seeping from a wound.  “There is something between you two.  You hide it well, Draco Malfoy, you are very good at hiding things, but reading people, well it’s my thing really.”
Ron just nodded, his eyes fixed on the floor.
It was a long, quiet moment as he waited, hand outstretched and forever empty, lost in memory.
Realizing that any additional protesting was fruitless, Harry just held out the SD card out of the camera.  Lockhart picked up the card with two fingers and held it between them like a threat.  “A - maz - ing,” she said again and shaking her head, walked out.
Lost in his own realizations, Draco had stopped paying attention and missed some of the argument.  As he tuned back in, he decided whatever he missed had not been very important as Robards was still out of control and screaming about how the Malfoys were the root of all evil.
Before Harry can figure out how to respond, the professor's eyes catch on something just over Harry’s shoulder.  “Merlin save us,” Malfoy breathed in horror.
alright?” Draco asked back incredulously and decided to hell with decorum.  He wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist and held on tight.  With Harry still recovering from the torture, Draco was not sure who was supporting who and yet despite that, all was wonderfully perfect in his world.  That was his only excuse for what slipped out next.  “I’m in love with a git.”
“Ha!”
“Yes.”  Shacklebolt nodded and Harry nodded back, satisfied, but the Minister was not done.  “But that leaves me with an open position that I urgently need filled.”
Luckily the one time Slytherin Seeker did not seem to mind.  Malfoy smiled at Harry in a way that softened his features and lit up his eyes.  “Yes,” he agreed.  “Ms. Rockheart was raving about your invitation to try out for the team.”
“What?”
“Exactly." Ron said, nodding along, "It’s unbelievable.  Robard’s got Death Eaters breaking out of Azkaban, a rash of missing youths in Northern Scotland, and who knows what else …”
The buildings that house the Ministry of Magic are shrouded and dark, as though the intermittent sun refuses to shed its’ light on the new regime.  The magical government, once the proud beacon of order and law, has fallen into shadow.  Since the Dark Lord’s death, the ruling body has descended into the chaos of the ages of old, run by Mudbloods, blood Traitors and Muggle lovers.  Rain trickles down, half hearted and dreary, as though even it cannot fully commit to moving forward in these dark times.  The death of my Lord has cost us much, the setback to the cause is almost overwhelming.  Rebuilding now is a process so slow and achingly painful, it is almost not worth the effort.
Harry just shrugged.  “It helped that it was mutual.  It was an idea we tried that didn’t work.  Ginny’s support of the whole thing took a bit of the wind out of your mum’s sails.”
“Old friend,” Shacklebolt said, sliding an arm around Robards shoulders and gently steering him away.  “How long has it been since you had a proper vacation?  Something long and relaxing, perhaps a beach, time to work on a nice tan?”
Draco could feel the ridiculous smile that had taken over his face but could not be bothered to smother it.  Shacklebolt managed that for him when he cleared his throat.  A sense of foreboding had Draco tightening his hold on Harry.
A moment later Blaise stormed in, stomped across the area Greg had just danced through and collapsed in a huff into a chair.
The tosser.
Harry gave Ron a confused look and his friend nodded in agreement.  “I know, right?  Not really Fred and George’s thing.  It wasn’t for sale, it didn’t seem to go with anything, like decorations and shit.  It was very life-like, as though the creator had worked to make it look like an actual cat.  It felt like the fur should be soft rather than stone, each hair individually sculpted.  Really not the type of thing I would expect Fred and George to have.  So a few days later, I was back and the statue was gone.  But there was this cat wandering around the office, like a live one, rubbing up against my leg and leaving hair on my dress slacks.”
Harry felt a knot of anticipation start to build. This was it, the first time he would see Malfoy or the other Slytherins since the final battle, the first time he would hear their music. He found himself hopeful for what was to come, hoping the crowd would like them … no, more than that … hoping the crowd would love them.
“Wait is that…?”  Ron popped his head up over Harry’s shoulder to get a closer look … or to make Harry feel short.  Could be both.  “Is that Hagrid’s egg?”
The trip to Edinburgh was supposed to be a time to just kick back and relax.  Ron and Harry had both been invited to take this trip with the band.  As Harry stood on the curb, watching the bus pull away without him, he could not help feeling like the odd man out once again.  That it had been his idea did not make it any better.
“Draco Malfoy, now there’s a piece of work,” Charlie said.
The soft meeting of lips was like slipping into a warm bath.  Draco could feel the angry tension in his muscles ease.  The smooth slide of skin on skin was chaste and tentative and amazing.  He knew he was forever spoiled for anyone else.  The thought that he would only ever be able to kiss Harry Potter going forward did not bother him at all.
“Whose name?”  The man, obviously David, called back.
Draco Malfoy was breathtaking.  Harry stumbled to a stop coming through the doors into the Great Hall and nearly got run over by a group of energetic students.  He slid out of the way to catch his breath, only to lose it again as he watched Malfoy casually make his way down the staircase.  His long legs moved to a quick, lively beat, his professor robes flared out behind him with a drama not seen since Snape had walked these halls.  While the late advisor had an air of menace, Malfoy’s long lines made the look elegant.  It was something about the way he moved, Harry decided.  Gravity seemed to support him like a lover.
There was a flash of panic in Draco’s eyes.  “Yes.”  His voice came out a bit high and Draco cleared his throat and tried again.  “Yes, there was.”  He put down his silverware carefully and then slowly turned.  “I know it is a bit early … I certainly would not want you to feel under any obligation.  Not that you would.  There is no reason…”
They were talking about him!  Harry almost crowed with delight and pulled his head back before they saw him.  He really should leave, but the thought doesn’t stop him from settling into a comfortable position as he listened.
Harry could not contain his laughter.  Both Arthur and Ron were looking at him in confusion as he wiped his eyes.  “Arthur, that’s a lampshade.”
All classes were cancelled. Ginny was hiding in her dorms. As were Harry and Hermione. Draco was out and about but it was like talking to a zombie. He was so numb that no one could have a conversation with him. Adrian and Joan were trying to help Arlene cope with what she saw. Luna was of course supportive of her.
Ginny only had time to nod before Fred and George came over and said, “hello sis, hello Arlene.”
The event will be held June 17th in the Great Hall between 8 A.M. and 11 A.M. There will be a second chance to donate between 1 P.M. and 3 P.M. on the same day.
Adrian didn’t give a damn about what the goblet thought. He stood up and said with all the authority and fury of a force of nature, “she doesn’t want to participate. Show me in the rules where you can force someone to be a participant. This is a voluntary function. Not a mandatory one.” He glared down at Dumbledore.
They stepped out into the sun. Arlene already had her sunglasses on so it didn’t bother her as much. The light house was at the end of a jut of land that formed a bay with the mainland. A stone shed sat next to the cliff edge that led down to the water. The sign above the door had writing that looked familiar. It was all in Arabic but she checked it against the scrap of paper that Adrian had given her last night.
Arlene asked, “do you know a Ginny?”
McGonagall responded, “funny how it doesn’t. You’d think with all the chaos here it would any day.”
Then he overheard that prophecy. The first thing he did was run and tell the Dark Lord like the good little servant he was. Only to find out later that it was Lily’s child it had been referring to. He begged the Dark Lord to spare Lily. His response was to laugh and say, “sure, I’ll do what I can.”
Author came out and asked Joan, “is he off to see what all that is about?” She nodded.
For the next several minutes Author and Adrian cooked breakfast for their respective groups. Their meals were similar in almost every regard. Eggs, sausage, bacon, and warmed up muffins.
Standard sleep potion.
“It’s the Death Eaters!” someone screamed loud enough for her to hear. Arlene looked back and got a glimpse of figures in robes and skull masks marching between the burning tents. She urged her legs to move despite the burning in her muscles. Luna tripped over and fell in a fit of coughing.
He said, “you know what, if no one joins I’ll give you all ten thousand Galleons. I’m bribing you all to not join in on this bullshit.”
Loud pops sounded as the lobster-like creatures soared around the corner. They were flying in the air and landed in front of her. Screeches flew at her.
Fred and George walked up, using the table for support as they were doubled over with laughter. Fred fought to say through his laughing, “great play, sis.”
She laughed at them and said, “depends on how sales are doing?”
At first it was just the champions dancing. Then the braver of the students joined them. Arlene watched Ginny and Neville go past. Professor McGonagall and Professor Dumbledore were dancing on the side. Hagrid and Madame Maxine were on the floor as well. Draco and a Slytherin girl she had never met before danced by. Adrian and Joan danced together. Even Filch was loving on his cat in the corner of the room.
Adrian said in a deadly quiet voice, “over my dead body she will” He heard Joan trying to calm him but he vaulted the table and walked over to the headmaster. “Well? How devoted are you to your rules? Will you murder a man for your precious little game?”
Over at the Gryffindor table someone picked up on the hint and began doing the same to Hermione’s hate mail. Soon the owls stopped coming. Arlene knew that they made an impression on a few people.
The next round of waiting began. That was until someone spotted a small boat gliding along the water. With a burst of water and escaping air the small boat sprang up to be the crow’s lookout on the mast of a massive ship. As it settled on top of the water sails and flags unfurled from the masts. An anchor fell from the front of the ship and lodged it in place. Rowboats were lowered from the side and sent to the shore. Boys and girls in heavy furs left the boats and lined up in front of the Hogwarts students.
Arlene commended him, “you’re brave for doing this.” She looked down and saw Professor Flitwick beginning the process of drawing her blood. Her stomach lurched but once she looked away the feeling passed.
By mutual, unspoken agreement they got up and began walking towards Hagrid’s hut for some tea.
Severus was confused. He blinked as he sputtered, “What-I don’t understand. I protect-I do protect him. Lily, what matters is that we’re here together. Please tell me you’ve changed your mind.”
They led her back to the Ravenclaw common room. The door was already open when she got there so she didn’t have to worry about the knocker. The common room was wild. Arlene didn’t stay too long though. She had never been to a party like that. She didn’t like the sensory overload. The Ravenclaws were smart enough to get it and explain it to those that didn’t.
A hand slapped at his arm. He grabbed the spot he had been hit at and said, “ow! What the hell?”
Magnificent, mahogany desks filled with finely dressed librarians behind them were among the first things she saw. Behind them were pillars of marble the supported multiple floors. The area they had stepped off in rose though multiple levels to end with a massive chandelier hanging from the ceiling. Gold railing gave protection in between the marble columns.
It was a wide area with seats surrounding him. Rocky outcrops and hills made for natural cover. Cheers and jeers rained on him from the seats but only one thing had his attention.
sorry about the late chapter. This chapter is to help Snape grow and not to hate on him. I just wanted to clarify that.
He turned to them as the crowd cheered. His voice returned to normal as he spoke, “Alright, Krum and Delacour will enter first since their schools are at a disadvantage. Next you three will be staggered in. Good luck everyone. We will be watching so if you get into trouble then someone will be along to help you soon.” Ludo Bagman left them. Madam Maxine and Professor Karkaroff were talking to their champions. With pats on the backs and quiet words of encouragement they sent them into the maze.
Adrian shrugged and said, “okay, I know my worth.” He didn’t really care what she thought of him. Then what Joan had said settled in his brain. He spun to her and asked, “dragons? We’re helping with the dragons?”
Lee Jordan yelled, “unbelievable! In a turn of events no one saw coming, literally, Weasley snuck past the dragon without incident! Amazing!”
They reached the next set of portkeys. Before they could find the right one the world was bathed in a green light. Looking up and behind them they saw the cause. Several people gasped and some screamed at the sight. A set of green stars had arrayed themselves in the sky to form a skull with a snake crawling out the mouth. The image sent a shiver up Arlene’s spine. Her hands found themselves entwined with Luna’s but neither of them cared. She didn’t know what the image meant. She was smart enough to know it was evil.
Arlene told him everything she had found out. That dragons were involved in the next trial. That despite all the research she had done she had found nothing to help her. About ten minutes went by as she talked. Joan walked in just as she had finished. The two of them gave her the rundown of it.
They reached a staircase that ended in a picture of a singing woman. Arlene asked, “where’s your knocker?”
Arlene didn’t know what to believe now. If she had to point a finger then she would point it at the ministry. She didn’t have any hard evidence. All she had was a weak suspicion.
The third Beauxbatons champion was Aimee Quincy. The Durmstrang one was Chistina Rusu.
The dragon roared as he moved away from the chaos. The dragon was confused by all the noise and sights. She didn’t notice Ron moving the golden egg under the cloak and making a break for it.
Her face betrayed her confusion for a second before she composed herself. Her Photographer wasn’t as smart. He actually began, “but we did-oof!” Skeeter elbowed him in the ribs.
They sat in the Ravenclaw common room. Others were scattered around them but most were off preparing for the ball. A tree had been set up in the corner by the fireplace. Garland and lights decorated the walls. Someone had set up a radio to play muggle Christmas music.
Arlene scowled and said, “I’m facing one in the second trial in the tournament.”
Arlene put a hand to her chin and wondered aloud, “why would the ministry want to put a stop to someone trying to free house elves?”
Adrian repeated her words in a mocking tone but was too busy to do much else.
Roars and cheers from the crowd could be heard from outside. Ron had come back with his egg unscathed. Krum was next.
Arlene said in a low voice, “I just wanted to help Ron win.” She looked them in the eye. She had to make them understand. “Ginny, can you imagine what it will mean if Ron wins the tournament?”
She told him, “I can start searching for her. Where do you want me to look?”
Humanity quickly forgot their saviors but the beasts of magical blood have long memories. They remembered. The Connery family stuck by their side and the two formed an unbreakable alliance that resulted in the most powerful dynasty within the magical community.
She sat up to take in her surroundings. It took some time for her to remember where she was. A look to the side showed her that Luna was still fast asleep. She was still in the clothes she had worn last night. All of her spare clothes had been in the tent back at camp. She got up and stretched. It was strange being the only one awake at a time like this.
He now had two wands. He couldn’t cast two spells at once, no one could, but he could double the power of his attacks now. He cast the killing curse against two more death eaters. They dropped to the ground.
He rubbed at his chin and said, “not really. We need to get back tomorrow. I’m also really tired for today.” He gestured for her to follow and walked towards the exit elevator.
They both told her in unison, “tickle the pear.”
He went into the woods to his side and took the long way around. Every lesson on sneaking returned to him. He was silent when he approached. He didn’t make a sound. Using magic he checked for detection spells as he got closer to his target location. So, he was really disappointed when he arrived and found nothing. Nothing except a pair of boot prints in the dirt. They faced downhill and in the direction of the house.
She smiled at them. As she ran off she told them, “thank you!” She made her way down to the kitchens. She found the picture of the fruit and tickled the pear. It actually squirmed with a giggle. The picture swung open to reveal the kitchens within.
“I’m not going to die,” Arlene insisted. “I’ve lived through danger before. I’m still here aren’t I?”
Ginny put her head in her hands. Such a simple thing had become stressful due to the intolerance of people who couldn’t stand to see the truth. If only people would open their minds then none of this would even be an issue.
Her and Luna spent even more time with each other. She would go out of her way just to meet Luna in between classes that she couldn’t attend. Luna was always happy to see her.
The landscape was similar to his home’s. After all they were only separated by a small boat ride. The house here was smaller than his but had all the same enchantments and alchemy done to it. Sirius lay on a hammock enjoying the sun. He peered over sunglasses at Adrian and asked, “time to get to work?”
Dumbledore waved a wand at the ceiling and made thunder crack. “The rules are final. Arlene Connery will participate in this trial.”
Sirius looked to the floor. “Like he used James and Lily. Like he might be using Harry now.”
“Professor, I was curious, do you know of any magical libraries outside of the school’s?” Arlene didn’t know where he would lead her but he had never lead her wrong.
While Arlene and Luna were putting fresh water into the trough Luna let out a yelp. Arlene was splashed with water as she looked over. She wiped at her face as she saw Luna crawling out of the trough.
She did the only thing she could do which was help the Weasley family and Luna get moving. All of them followed the crowd away from the destruction. That was until someone rushed over to Mr. Weasley and demanded, “Arthur, you need to come with me.”
Arlene didn’t even attempt to hide her amazement. “That’s amazing.” She looked up to see Adrian smiling at her.
“I can’t help that it’s so delicious,” she explained. They both liked that idea and headed for the Three Broomsticks to get some butterbeer and food. Many of the other students had made their way there too but the majority were at the joke or candy shops. They managed to find a table with one of the least expected people.
Arlene looked at her as she asked, “what do you require?”
He had to go to his bathroom and grab an actual towel. Joan closed the door and followed him in. She took residence in his bathroom doorway now. He dried himself off and began brushing his teeth. He leaned back to check the clock in his room and saw that he had woken up late by his standards. It was nine in the morning.
They took their times undressing each other and kissing over each other. Joan pulled Adrian on top of her and let him satisfy their needs. It was several minutes of passion as their attractive bodies pressed and ground against each other. Low moans and whispers of pleasure filled the air. Adrian started slow until she came once. He started thrusting faster. After she came again she told him she had taken a potion of protection. It was a potion to protect against pregnancy. She demanded he finish in her. Ten seconds later he did.
The professor told her, “I’m glad things are turning out well for you. Are you ready to learn some new magic?” Arlene nodded and Joan went on, “So now we got some new ideas for you to try.” She looked her in the eyes. “Read my mind.”
She moved down the path until she saw a blue light. Excitement filling her, she jogged down until she saw the source. On a pedestal sat the Triwizard cup. She had found it.
Adrian looked at her. “Maybe. I’d say it is worth a shot.” Then he told her, “Joan and I have fought exactly one dragon before. That was the worst fight I have ever been in even with all our skills and training. I do not recommend fighting this thing head on. Focus on moving. Use the terrain and the environment to your advantage. Take cover when you can.”
Five minutes later she was walking down a corridor when shouts and flashes of wand fire appeared in front of her. She jogged towards it like she was supposed to but hated every step. She reached the scene and found Adrian already taking wands from students and saying, “no dueling in the corridors. I’ve told you this already.” He was stern but calm.
In a massive coincidence that I made since I’m a lazy ass writer, Hermione was walking towards them from the other direction. They pointed that way and he said, “oh, thank you.” Then he ran towards Hermione.
She continued down the paths. The goal posts didn’t peek over the walls again. She needed to find her bearings. Leaning against the wall, she closed her eyes and spread her consciousness around her. It was more controlled than before and the thoughts she encountered were less intrusive than before.
Adrian was already drawing his wand and running towards the chaos. A terrified scream rent the air. Gasps and screams followed. He glimpsed Skeeter urging her photographer to take all the pictures he could. He had bigger problems than her right now.
Adrian Pov.
Flitwick nodded and told her, “those are valid feelings.” He looked to Professor McGonagall and pleaded, “there has to be some way to get her out of this.”
They sprawled out on the floor. Arlene was the first to speak, “that was painful. I want to check these out and look at them tomorrow.” She rubbed at her eyes.
They agreed to not talk about the tournament anymore but now Arlene was conflicted. She wanted to help Ginny’s family but she also wanted her friends to not worry. It would be easy to just give Ginny ten thousand or more Galleons. Ron winning the tournament would force the pure-blood families to recognize the power of the Weasley family. The politics of the situation didn’t matter much to her but she was tired of the Weasleys being seen as lesser because of Mr. Weasley’s job. It was time the pure-blood supremist families were forced to recognize the Weasley’s potential.
Ron made a point, “by ‘left’ he means threw it at his desk and called it words even I don’t feel like repeating. That’s closer to what really happened.”
A pained expression appeared on Mr. Weasley’s face. Then he said, “Fred, George. Get the others to the backup portkeys. That’s where everyone is heading. They’ll take us to the same place the old one did. Get everyone back to the burrow.” Before anyone could argue against him he and the stranger left.
She looked back to see him drawing an alchemy circle in the air. She couldn’t make out the symbols but less than a second after he activated it the largest explosion yet detonated in front of it. He was protected by a conjured shield. The Death Eaters on the other side were not.
Luna turned to her and looked deep into her eyes. In that moment she became aware of everything about her. Her pale blonde hair, her beautiful blue eyes, the way her lips curved when she smiled, cheeks that she wanted to cup with her hand. Then she said those words, “Arlene, I love you.”
Joan told her, “go ask Professor Snape about that sleeping potion. Then find us later and we’ll talk more strategy.”
(See the end of the chapter for
They sat next to them and Harry said, “Ginny, Draco and I need to tell you something.” He looked at Luna and said, “you too, Luna.” He leaned in towards them and whispered, “Draco and I are in a relationship.”
Arlene’s flower had grown in the years she had kept it. She had to trim a few times already but she plucked one of the extra heads from it and stuck it in her hair.
Again the goblet flared and the next name was from Beauxbatons. His name was Jules Bastion.
Ron stood up and exclaimed, “yes!” while pumping a fist into the air. “Thank you so much.” He sat down but had a massive smile on his face. Hermione shook her head. She seemed disappointed but she didn’t say anything to them.
Fleur told them, “you should come to France. We are very accepting there.”
To say that Arlene was shocked was a large understatement. Her eyes were wide. She leaned back in the chair and said, “uh.”
She spun her wand idly in her hand. It tipped dangerously but she caught it. Sparks jumped from the tip of it. All her thinking stopped. She sat up in her bed and shook the wand. Nothing happened. She shook it harder while growling, “hey, I saw that. Do it again.” Still nothing happened. Arlene huffed and put her wand down. Maybe her witch abilities were finally popping up.
He didn’t take off the cloak until he was right by the exit to the stadium. Most of the creations had stopped or been crushed by now. The dragon roared with rage.
It was almost time to go down. The champions were meeting early to make sure they could start the dance. Arlene asked Luna one more time, “are you sure about this?”
Arlene went up the stairs and grabbed her suitcase. Luna was on her bed reading a copy of the Quibbler. She looked up and said, “my dad has found new evidence on the minister’s war on goblins. He says the minister ate another pie the other day and no one knows what was in it. That means he wants it secret which means it’ll be goblins in his pie.”
Adrian answered as he picked up a bundle of blankets from the ground, “might not be the right thing but it is the necessary thing.” He pulled some cloth away to reveal the face of Voldemort. “You’re going to play nice. Don’t try anything. I have prepared for every scenario,” he lied. “Tell us what we want to know and you just might leave this graveyard alive.”
She could see a good path of rocks to jump along to get to the climbing wall. Only three more jumps  and she would be on it. Another gasp followed by a cheer and Lee announced, “Delacour avoids a fire jet and is the first to reach the rock wall. Delacour had indeed reached the wall and was climbing up it.
She kissed his chest and told him, “Don’t be too hard on yourself. We both are. Unlearning the things we went through isn’t easy. We may never get fully over it.” She propped herself up on her elbow. “I don’t think that means we shouldn’t try to lead normal lives. Neither of us want to be killers anymore.” She smiled at him. “Besides, would the monsters we used to be take care of all those kids and relieve stress by having sex secretly?”
They left and found all the other stores to be the same. Arlene realized quickly that it had to be because of the attack on the World Cup. They all did their shopping and left much faster than normal. Once they finished they went straight back to the burrow.
The dragon was saying, “if you take the fake egg will my real ones be safe? I know it is fake. I need the real ones. They are my children. The mean humans are crafty and captured us. Please help us.”
She responded, “we’re needed down in the forest. Hagrid and Grubbly-Plank need help. This is from McGonagall.”
He pulled his tin of cookies out and asked, “cookie?”
Fire protection potion.
“I will find him as soon as I can.”
He held up a finger and said, “the art of controlling your emotional energy isn’t just some shit. It’s a complex state of meditation that I haven’t done in a while and I probably should.” He sighed and told her, “let’s make it a family thing.”
As one voice they all asked, “how big?”
Professor Snape sneered and responded while biting each word, “don’t lie to me.” He leaned in and went on, “I saw you run off with that Potter during dinner and you only return now? What were you up to?” His demeanor calmed as he raised an eyebrow. “Perhaps something to embarrass him?”
Sirius leaned back in his chair. “So how do we get those things? Did he-who-must-not-be-named even have parents?”
Ginny found herself being asked more questions about Arlene. She didn’t answer any except to tell people how much of a great friend she was. For once Rita Skeeter hadn’t ruined things as she had planned. Even Professor Barnes got over his anger and found it all hilarious.
They walked down towards the hut. None of the ministry workers even glanced in their direction. Luna was the first one to ask, “what are you up to?”
Professor Flitwick smiled and commented, “pretty cool right? My own little creation. It only works in this office and it won’t show people or animals. Excellent for showing the world as it is currently.” He tapped the map over Egypt and told it, “Library of Alexandria.” The map zoomed in on the northern coast of Egypt.
Then something unexpected happened. Professor Snape let out a sob and fell to the ground. His voice strained to remain calm as he ordered, “Go to bed.” Draco stood up and turned to leave. The last words Professor Snape would tell him that night calmed him for the rest of the night. “You have opened my eyes, Draco.”
The magic of that moment ended when they got home and found half the kids throwing potatoes at each other from homemade forts across the room. Now the potatoes where locked up.
The two of them walked down to the village. The two of them weren’t in a hurry. It wasn’t like the village was going anywhere. About half an hour later they were at the village. It was then that Luna asked, “where should we go first?”
Joan talked as he slowly took another sip of water, “that’s not what you said after we had sex last night.”
Adrian shrugged. “Depends on what he says while we have him on truth potion. We need the truth.”
He nodded. “You two are brave indeed. I am glad to see people standing up for themselves like you.” He smiled at them and then raised an arm towards the entrance hall and said, “the champions from Beauxbatons have arrived.” He walked back to Hermione then.
“But the house elves!” Hermione begged as Professor Barnes came down. She turned to him and asked, “Professor do you support the enslavement of house elves?”
He tapped Joan on her shoulder but she told him without turning, “no, I have no idea.”
He answered, “I’m going to ask for a private interview.” He emphasized, “she won’t be a problem when I’m done.” McGonagall hesitated for a moment. Then she nodded solemnly. He added, “I’ll resign after if you want me to.” He didn’t wait for her to answer after that.
Bastion had been so determined to win that having his leg bitten off seemed lucky to him. He would get it back for sure. That being said, it was still so humbling to think that he was happy about it. He had to be traumatized. She knew she would be after something horrible like that. The fact that he would still get the prize money was enough to make him think it was a strike of luck. Arlene couldn’t think of that as lucky. Despite her own hardships there was no way she would consider what he went through anything lucky.
She looked to Luna and asked, “do you see anything?”
She stroked some his scars unconsciously and remarked, “we both compare things to fighting. We’re both pretty fucked up I guess.”
By the time the next morning came around word had gone through the entire school. Harry was claiming that Voldemort had returned. Ron Weasley was dead. Who believed what was still up for debate. The ministry had yet to release a statement on the matter. Professor Moody had left to go set up the fight against the death eaters.
Groans and yells of protest echoed through the stadium. One of the Durmstrang students passed her. The one named Rusu. She smirked at her and said, “a little clumsy? Stupid girl.”
She answered honestly, “angry that no one is listening to me and upset that I have to do this tournament against my will.”
She turned to him. Her lip had been healed with magic already. She smiled at him and asked, “what could you have to offer me?”
Something hit her back hard enough to make her stumble. In the loose dirt she lost her footing and slipped. She slid down the slope towards a pit of mud. It looked deep and easy to get stuck in. If she got trapped in that then she wouldn’t get out in time to win.
Arlene told her, “thank you.” They began looking through the books.
They were hauled up unceremoniously by Joan who was saying, “we need to leave now!” They looked back to see smoke and fires rising from several tents and it was spreading fast. “we need to get back to the portkey!”
Author handed the lighter back to Adrian who pocketed it. Luna came out of the tent then and sat beside Arlene. “Good morning, any Wrackspurts trouble your sleep?”
Arlene laughed and said, “Yes, I ask for trouble to just come rushing at me.” Her and Luna left through the fireplace. Luna went right back to her home. Then Arlene and her adoptive parents went back to the beach house.
She didn’t want something like that happening to Luna. She could go with a boy but just as a friend. That wasn’t what she wanted. She wanted to be with the girl she loved. To dance with her and kiss her. To do all those things and not worry that the wrong person might go crazy and try to hurt Luna or her.
He smiled and waved down her thanks. “Not a problem. I enjoyed being able to come back to London for a bit. I’m glad to keep you safe as well.” He gestured out to the crowd, “now go find your friends. You’ll need to find a compartment together.”
Krum and Fleur went and faced their dragons. Both of them got their eggs. The rules didn’t have a minimum or maximum number of contestants that could move on. If they all got the egg then they all made it to next trial.
Adrian sighed before going on, “I’ll need one of his father’s bones. Did Dumbledore ever give any clues to his origins?”
Arlene raised an eyebrow and asked, “like what?”
Adrian interrupted their argument, “Dumbledore,” he looked the old man in the eye, “if any students die during this tournament then their blood will be on your hands. That includes any permanent injuries or emotional trauma.” Dumbledore met his gaze. “If you see it fit to put their lives at risk then if they die it will be on you. Not them, not the families, on you. I will make the entire world know that when the reporters come.”
He flinched and scurried away to the other side of the room to leer at Fleur. Ludo Bagman approached her next. He timidly told her, “you can’t be here. This room is for champions only.”
Even Weasley and Potter were still getting along. Through all this they were still hanging out with each other. Weasley would often been seen trying to get people to stop harassing Potter. It didn’t seem to be working.
Blue flames shot out at the ribbon as it bounced off the troll’s face. Arlene had produced one of the hottest flames ever seen at Hogwarts and the metal caught fire instantly. She already had her arm in place to block the light but was still blinded by the sheer amount of it coming from the burning metal.
An elegant podium was stood in front of it. Dumbledore made his way around the table and behind the coffin. He opened the lid and bent down to get something from it. Arlene’s pulse had picked up and a sweat grew on her palms. She didn’t like whatever was in that coffin. She had a feeling similar to when Joan had tried to open the locked door in her castle.
“I could eat. Your husband just left for work.”
Lee Jordan was doing the announcements just like during Quidditch and he said, “welcome to the first trial of the Triwizard tournament! Our champions are ready to begin! First some words from Mr. Ludo Bagman himself!” The stadium exploded in cheers.
He went over the city and began looking around. She asked, “what are you looking for?”
Fatiguing infusion.
She felt a tap on her shoulder and turned to see Luna standing there. “Hey,” she greeted her with a smile.
There was little talking during their walk. They were all so in shock from the events that had just happened that none of them could think of what to say. The attack had been so sudden and violent. They were all children and none of them were used to the pure horror of something like that. Arlene, Ginny, and Luna had been near death before but never on that scale. Never in something so fast and brutal.
Arlene told her, “hold on.” She ran back into class and grabbed the professor’s notes. A few seconds of reading told her the only thing she was wondering. The notes had been altered.
“I told you both under a truth potion. I saw Dumbledore kill Lilly. Voldemort wasn’t even there.” He hesitated before saying, “I think I saw some empty robes on the ground. The wooden beam fell on my head right before I could fully understand what was going on.” His face fell at the memory.
Arlene’s mouth worked but no words came out. After a minute she said, “the cup took us away. It took us to a graveyard. Adrian was there. So were Mr. Lupin and Mr. Black. Some kind of ritual was going on. There was a man who looked like the person who came out of the diary in my first year. He was older.” Realization hit her of who she had seen. “It was Voldemort.” She turned to Joan and whispered, “he’s back. Voldemort’s back.” Her voice shook. “Ron’s dead. A death eater killed him.” The tears came back.
George asked, “Professor Barnes, what did you do while the rest of us got out?”
He left Snape crying on the ground the quiet sobs faded away before he finally reached the door to the common room. He went to bed immediately. It had been a long day. All he wanted to do now was sleep and try and remember the good parts.
It was then that Professor McGonagall came back and said, “everything is ready. Please get with your partners and get ready to walk in.”
Both of them caught onto what was happening. Luna stated it, “someone is hiding your family’s history?”
She read:
Remus asked, “Are we sure this is the right thing to do?”
Professor Moody limped in and asked, “are we going to discuss how Miss Connery’s name got into the goblet without her knowing? Seems like someone is trying to put her in danger.” His fake eye swiveled to Karkaroff.
Arlene smiled fiercely and asked, “are you suggesting we discredit Skeeter?”
Severus shook his head. It was a trick. It had to have been a trick. It had to have been. People didn’t change. No one ever changed.
Madam Rosmerta laughed and told her, “alright, first one is on the house.” She turned to Luna. “For you?”
As Arlene and Luna left the Ravenclaw common room they ran into Hermione Granger. She ran up to Luna and asked, “I need your help with S.P.E.W.”
Adrian patted her on the shoulder and said, “don’t worry about it. Me and Hagrid will look for environmental advantages.” He walked over to Hagrid and said, “let’s look around for cover and high places. Things that will help us if one of the dragons get out of control.”
Hagrid spoke up next. He stood up and asked, “Professor, I think we should be extra careful.” He held his hands up in an innocent gesture. “Not to criticize the school but the last few years we seem have had more than our fair share of bad luck.”
Luna explained, “we’re scared for you. This is different. Out there you’ll be alone. You won’t have anyone to help you. No one to watch your back.” She hesitated before finishing, “we’re scared for you, that’s all. We want you to be safe. The tournament isn’t safe.” She had an uncomfortable look on her face.
No one laughed. The rest of the meeting was spent discussing scheduling of the school year around the three tasks that would occur. No details about the Tournament were discussed, the only thing they knew was that the first would involve dragons somehow. Adrian did not like this.
Luna had a fierce smile on her face. “I like this. You’ve always been a person Ginny. Now it’s time to show the world.”
She rolled her eyes at him and asked, “you want to skip the exercises and get drunk again today?”
Draught of living death.
Remus backed him up, “it’s too late to cut us out now. We’ve taken precautions already.” He pointed back at the table and said, “put it back. We’re doing this with or without you.”
Too much had gone wrong. He pulled the detonator from his pocket. He was going to waste months of work but it was too dangerous now. He flipped up the cover for the switch. “Cover!” A spell hit the detonator in his hand. It burst apart and cut his hand. He hissed and threw up a shield spell. Cloaked figures were approaching them from the manor on the hill.
He spoke but Arlene saw through him. She wasn’t sure what to make of Voldemort. She knew what she thought of Dumbledore. She wasn’t going to buy his lies anymore. She looked to Luna to see she held a fierce expression on her face. They were going to stand against Dumbledore.
She nodded and they made their way outside. Sometime after the first trial a snow had fallen on the grounds. The sun was out now and it was the middle of the day. They were bundled up enough to keep the cold off. The lake hadn’t even frozen over yet. The Durmstrang ship sitting in the middle made for a change in scenery.
The two students who had attacked Potter shook their heads in a desperate plea. They would rather write an essay than be stuck with Professor Moody for a night. Adrian smiled and said, “thank you. That would be fantastic.” He handed him the wands he had confiscated. “They’re all yours.” Moody hauled the two students away.
Arlene asked, “so, did you enjoy that?”
“No,” the knocker responded. It still had that smug attitude. “You can’t answer the riddle then you can’t enter. Rules are rules.” It stopped moving and became still as metal.
Charlie answered, “Charlie Weasley, dragon enthusiast.”
They relaxed and Sirius smirked before saying, “it’s pretty damn good.”
To say it was unexpected would be an understatement. Her mind shot out in all directions like tendrils. One latched onto Joan’s mind. Some reached out to the nearest ghosts. The birds and owls on top of the astronomy tower were caught up. In an instant she knew all the thoughts of those around her. Joan was wondering about her progress. An owl was about to take off to go hunting. The ghosts were anticipating someone’s deathday party.
He sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. Joan walked up to him and whispered in his ear, “let’s go to my room for a bit.” She didn’t need to inflect any tone or do anything physical to add to it. He knew what it meant. He stared at his fingers in thought then nodded and followed her.
“Simple,” Adrian told them, “the ministry loves records. They’ll have kept records of his whereabouts in the orphans department.” He stretched and said, “I had to deal with them a bunch when I was getting all the orphaned kids at Hogwarts.”
Soon the horizon was filled with blue. Next the farmland was replaced by buildings. He called back to her, “I’m going to go over the ocean and lower altitude. I’ll need to save the invisibility spell for when we’re approaching.” He did just this. He passed over a narrow outcrop of land that formed a bay. He went several kilometers over the ocean then dropped speed and altitude.
He jumped the rail by the front row as the dragon tamers rained stunning spells on the dragon. The dragon jerked and squirmed. Bastion was lifted in the air and sent flying. The dragon’s tail rose to the front row as its head fell. He heard more screams as the tail raked across the front row.
Adrian leaned against the doorframe. He said, “I now know Dumbledore is my enemy but I need evidence. Voldemort was supposed to be our evidence. He’s vanished. I need hard evidence to justify to the ministry why I’m going to kill Dumbledore.” That was if he could do it.
While you were with the people murdering her friends and family?
Arlene Pov
They joined the Weasley family in the race for the portkey. It soon became obvious it wasn’t a party anymore as panic spread. The smell of smoke followed after it causing Arlene to choke as she ran. They kept well ahead of the fire even with all the commotion going around.
Thirty of them had descended on the graveyard. There were three who were for sure against them, one who was being confusing, and three students who shouldn’t have been there at all. Adrian threw himself into beating back the death eaters. He let go of his inhibitions against killing. His mind went back to the way of the fighter.
Professor Flitwick, who was great at cheering people up, told her, “this isn’t right and we’ll get it fixed.” He took her hand in a caring way.
She nodded and followed her out the door. Once they were outside and away from everyone Luna immediately asked, “Can we hang out during the next Hogsmeade visit?”
He turned to Dumbledore and begged him to help her. That was when he became a spy for him.
They turned to him and said together, “you already made us dirty.” He screamed as he saw the adult faces of Lily and James with blood pouring down their faces.
Now there was only one person who she was trying to impress and that was Luna Lovegood. The main problem was that Luna was the least likely person to judge anyone on what they wore. It was a good thing but it also meant that she was nearly impossible to impress with dressing up. It was impossible to know what she would like. In the back her mind her rational self was telling her to just grab something and stop worrying. Listening to rational and sense is not something that people in love do often.
Luna’s eyes widened and her smile faded. “Couple stuff?”
The students excitedly ran out of the courtyard. The smart ones, like Luna and Arlene, stuck to the sides to avoid the rush. They saw the twins holding Ginny over their heads while they rushed down with the rest.
Forgive me, Joan. I’m trying to save the world. “Have you done something different with your hair?” She played with it and giggled. He had enough pleasantries then. He got to business, “I was hoping to see an old record for a Tom Riddle.”
Sirius pointed out, “that’s the night of the third task.”
Adrian grimaced before saying, “Do you mind if I did it?”
He got up and went into the tent. He came out a second later while racking the slide on one of his guns. Luna asked, “why do you have a muggle weapon?”
She pinned his arms out and asked, “had enough?”
He stared at it for a minute. His face remained unimpressed. He drew his wand and sent a jet of flame over the flower. The flame dissipated as soon as it appeared. The flower was unharmed. He swiped his wand at it in an attempt to cut it in half. The flower swayed but remained unharmed.
The day of the Yule ball arrived. It was also Christmas so before all the fancy dancing began there was the tradition that dated back hundreds of years. Gift giving.
Because she hated him.
Overcome with emotion, Arlene threw her hands in the air and screamed, “Woo!” to the valley that held the shack. Luna laughed harder to that. Eventually they left the shack. Once back in the village. They couldn’t hold hands anymore. Despite it being legal in the ministry’s eyes not all of the magical community accepted lesbians. That didn’t stop them from having fun. They went to the candy store and stopped by the Three Broomsticks to get butterbeers to go.
Warning for gore.
Fred continued, “In that corridor there’s a picture of a fruit basket.”
“Hey, you can’t just leave me out here! Ask me another one!” The knocker remained still and cold. It was numb to her pleas. No one else was around to help her get in. She threw the knocker an obscene gesture she had learned from Adrian and went back to the Great Hall empty handed.
Arlene let out a breath and asked, “Where is he now?”
“Which is good for us,” Adrian told them. “The eyes of the magical world will be on a school event instead of on you. We do this in secret and we do it right.” He pointed to the ground to emphasize his point, “one detail goes wrong and we lose.”
Cheers turned to confusion. Mutters filled the hall. A Hufflepuff named Cedric Diggory stood up and suggested, “headmaster if I may, perhaps someone else should take her spot. Her name might have been put in without her knowledge. Maybe we could do another drawing?”
Alaric snapped back, “yes, you can!” Bits of his headstone flew away as spells hit his cover. He blindly threw some spells at the death eaters. “This is no place for you two! Get back to the cup!”
The tent was silent. Everyone was too nervous to make small talk. Even the champions who had been cocky before were now silent with nerves. Soon the moment of truth would be on them. Arlene sat on a bench and held her useless wand with no idea what she was going to do.
He would protect Harry, despite the fact that he hated him and his father. He only would protect him for Lily, that was the only reason. That didn’t mean he had to be nice or even fair to him. As long as Potter lived then it mattered little to him if he was happy or not.
“No,” she told them. “Whatever you want to ask him you can ask me. I’m a more competent teacher anyway.”
Then two arms wrapped around him. He felt someone holding him. A whisper in his ear told him, “I’ve felt the same way for a long time. I didn’t know you felt so strongly towards me. Let’s go sit by the lake.”
Arlene began pacing in the spot Draco had told her about. Three times she did this then a door appeared in the wall. She reached for the handle but hesitated before opening it. Luna asked another question, “how did you know this was here?”
With that out of the way Arlene asked, “so what is it that she doesn’t like?” There was an air of conspiracy about them and she wasn’t sure what to make of it.
Ginny shrugged and answered, “I don’t know. I haven’t thought about it.” She kicked a rock that had been peeking from the snow. “I think the whole thing is weird anyway. Why have a dance in the middle of some tournament?” She didn’t understand why the Triwizard tournament had a dance in the middle of it. The dancing and music part she liked. The part where Arlene and Harry had to go and had to have partners was bothering her.
Harry leaned towards him and said, “you’ve already made me happy by accepting me.”
She closed the book and put it away with the others. She lay down with the intent to go to bed but wasn’t able to for several hours. Only when she heard Luna pass by was she able to relax enough to fall asleep.
Ginny responded, “yeah, I want to do this too.” She looked to Arlene. Arlene smiled as she agreed to it.
Arlene sighed. The she stood up and said, “we can at least try. He needs to come out sooner or later anyway.”
It did help that neither Ginny nor Luna thought any different of her. Ginny had been getting in trouble for starting fights to protect her name. She always told Ginny it wasn’t necessary but Ginny couldn’t stand people being mean to her friends.
Harry extended a hand and said, “take a seat.” Arlene sat down. “Would you agree that you and I are well off financially?” She nodded. “Good. Ron and his family aren’t as we all know. We have a plan to fix that.” Harry extended his hand at Hermione, who squirmed uncomfortably. “Hermione managed to convince Professor McGonagall to let her read up on previous years’ Triwizard tournaments which were hidden away in the restricted section but we fixed that.” Hermione had turned beet red and hid her face. Harry went on, “we now know the details of the coming tournament. Unfortunately the trials differ every year so we can’t predict those.”
They all responded at the same time, “she didn’t put her name in!”
Harry told him, “I know but it shouldn’t be like this.” His eyebrows softened as if in defeat. “I don’t want to put you in danger though. It is bad if your dad finds out.” His eyes closed and he rubbed his temples as if trying to stave off a headache. “I’ll just find a girl to go with. Maybe I can take Hermione as a friend. Nothing says the partners have to like each other romantically.”
“Hello you two. How did you sleep?”
Arlene Pov.
George jerked the box away as Fred said, “tut, tut, not polite to ask business men how they’re profits are when considering buying from them.”
The Horntail stared at him. She was perched protectively over her eggs. All its armored length wiggled. The spiked tail swished in all directions. Without a warning she let out an earsplitting roar. He slapped his hands to his ears and leaned over.
Joan took a seat. Arlene had taken a seat shortly after starting her explanation. Joan leaned forward and put her hands to her face in a thinking manner. She put her hands down. “I don’t know. I can’t believe they are going to let thirteen year old students fight dragons.”
Adrian went in and came out five minutes later. He told her, “get some rest. We’re going to the library tomorrow and we’ll get you the information that you need.” He laid down and got under his covers.
She blurted out, “I just wanted to get a large piece of meat.”
“Draco told me. It’s a room that only appears for those in need. A room of requirement you could call it I guess.” Her hand inched towards the handle until Luna gently gripped it.
He smiled in a way that Arlene didn’t like. “Hogwarts and the ministry have been working to together to bring back a timeless tradition to Hogwarts. The Triwizard tournament.” Murmurs echoed throughout the room as students began speaking to each other. Dumbledore went on, “this year we will host the tournament in which Durmstrang and Beauxbatons will participate. They will be arriving in October and shortly afterward we will begin selections for participants.” He let this information sink in before saying, “due to the unfortunate events of past tournaments the ministry has seen fit to set an age minimum of seventeen on participants.”
“Just a few minutes sir. I’ll let you know when I find something. You may take a seat.” The clerk began typing away at his computer.
“I’m Irish,” she corrected her.
Harry and Ron woke up and went to the entrance hall where the champions were meeting up. Professor McGonagall was waiting for them. All the other champions were there so Professor McGonagall led them out as she said, “the second trial will take place in an arena near the forbidden forest. The rest of the students will begin arriving in half an hour. You champions will be set up in a tent the will lead into the arena. In the tent you will don your gear and set up whatever you need.”
She looked ahead and saw no one was getting past the trolls anytime soon. She still had to act fast though. She ran over to the rock and drew an alchemic circle of separation around it. She drew some symbols in the dirt and activated the circle.
It might not be. It probably wasn’t her. Arlene didn’t think of herself as having many attractive qualities. She liked butterbeer too much. She didn’t have any cool skills. She didn’t even have a family. Who could ever love her?
Mr. Bagman excitedly announced, “the first trial will begin shortly my champions. First we need to lay down the ground rules. Gather around.” He waved them all closer. Arlene got up and got as close as she could with the eight others pressing in around her. Mr. Bagman began explaining, “at the end of this trial only six of you will remain in this tournament. It is an easy task. A race through an obstacle course.”
Her face paled and she stuttered. “W-w-well, simple, r-really. Uh…” No actual response came from her. She waved off the question and responded, “why do you need to know?”
Adrian stood up and said, “Barnes household meeting after this!”
She pulled out her potions. She drank half of both and then handed the rest to Jules Bastion. He looked at her funny until she said, “fire protection and Felix Felicis. I figure both of us should come out of this alive. I’m not too worried about who wins. I’m more concerned about our safety.”
Luna blushed but didn’t deny her hard work. She did say, “I love your gift. It was so thoughtful and sweet of you. I’m glad you want me to be safe.” She narrowed her eyes at Arlene. “You need to look out for your safety as well. I hope you got one for yourself.” She didn’t need to say out loud that she was referring to the tournament.
He shook his head. Draco informed her, “as a champion, he’s required to bring a partner too.” He looked at Harry and told him, “I understand if you want to go with a girl. I’m honestly afraid of my dad finding out about my preference.”
In his last two years of school Potter seemed to change. He stopped bullying him. He urged his friends to stop bullying him. He even began to stick up for Severus. There was one time where he might’ve been trying to apologize but he pushed him away and tried to curse him. Instead of defending himself Potter just ran from him. He could’ve easily beaten him but he didn’t. Potter still didn’t mess with him after that.
A pair of arms wrapped around his neck. One of the death eaters had jumped on him. The enemy’s wand poked him in the cheek. Adrian didn’t wait for him to cast a spell. He jerked his head enough that he could bite the wand. He threw multiple elbows into the death eater’s sides.
Professor Flitwick entered the room and said, “Miss Connery, are you alright? Let’s get this sorted out.”
Arlene stayed with Professors McGonagall and Flitwick. Joan stayed in the room with them. When all the others had left Joan asked, “Arlene how are you feeling?”
Adrian Pov.
And his daughter had to fight one.
All eleven Bastions ran forward. The dragon roared at all of them but didn’t attack. Adrian kept his eyes on the real Bastion. Even for him it wasn’t easy. He was being smart about it. He let the copies rush the dragon as he moved to the side in an attempt to get the egg. He cast the spell again and copies of the eggs fell from the nest and rolled across the arena.
Draco’s head whipped around, his eyes wide, visibly startled at seeing Harry so close.  “You .. He … they’re … up to something.”
“So get this, you know him and several of his buddies got sentenced to a year working with the Muggles right?”
“Our whole Bed and Breakfast could fit inside this room alone.”  Harry admitted.
Harry played with the camera settings for a moment before taking off the lense and aiming it towards the dragon.
“...and got Harry Potter thrown off a cliff!” he was screaming at Arthur.  “He’s a murder!  His whole bloody family should have their souls sucked out and their bodies dumped in an unmarked grave!  Their precious manor should be leveled and the grounds salted!  They are evil, vile …”
It was strange in the best way, but strange nonetheless.  Greg had been keeping an eye on Draco for other strange behaviors.  There were other differences but they were harder to put into words, or at least Greg found it hard.  He had never been good with words.
All three men nodded their approval at this behavior.  Getting between the Weasley women and their weddings was a good way to lose more than you were willing to part with and that was a fact.
Shouts.
“That’s enough Antonin.”  Rookwood’s pleased calm voice brought no comfort, even as the sound of voices that had screamed themselves hoarse was replaced by the harsh panting of two men pushed beyond their limit of pain.  The smell of burnt flesh mixed with the sharp crackle of magic in the air made Draco want to throw up.
“For Merlin’s sake why?  You haven’t changed your mind, have you, about the band enchanting people to like them?”
“If I had the slightest hope that would do any good, I would take you up on your offer but I see no value in it.  Why don’t you do this instead… if you have a couple of days, help out Charlie.  There was a sighting of Antonin Dolohov, the other escaped Death Eater, up that way a week or so ago, not far from where he is investigating some missing kids.  They were heading north the last I heard on a hot lead, not that there is much further north you can go from there.  I think they were heading to St. Kilda.  That was yesterday.  Who knows, you might find Rookwood as well.”
“Is he still trying to fly under the radar there?”
Draco had to drag his eyes away.  “Thank you, for standing up for us.”
The clack of wheels over the tracks wove memories thick in the air as the Hogwarts Express sped them over the long miles towards the old castle once again.
He could try playing along like he did with Voldemort.  But that had not worked.  Playing along, trying to do just enough to keep himself and his family out of trouble was what had landed him in the tower with orders to kill Dumbledore.
There would be no denial or putting this off, Harry was too self aware for any of that nonsense.
“I have been fighting prejudice against Slytherin house since I took the position as Potions Master.  My personal contributions to the war have done nothing but made the existing bad feeling even more intense.  To find Harry Potter, who has more reason than most to have negative feelings, displaying none towards me or towards my students is a surprise.”
Draco smile was the brightest Harry had ever seen as he waved the house elf behind the bar away and took his place.  “What are you having?”
“Wouldn’t let her out of your sight?”  Pansy asked.
“With the Quidditch players.”
“Sorry,” Blaise said to the piano keys.
Just when Harry thought he knew what to expect, the song changed.  The soft lyrical tones that had overlaid the driving beat suddenly changed to something hard and fierce.  Pansy ripped the microphone away from Malfoy and started rapping at an intense pace.
Pansy took the flowers, burying her face in them to take a deep breath.  Ron got to his feet, but a sharp look from her had him back on his knees.  “The job?” She asked, trying and failing to sound casual.
Sighing, Harry pulled himself from the couch to head up to bed.  The future and everyone in it would still be there in the morning and he needed his sleep if he was going to keep up with Ron.  Still, as he trudged up the stairs, Harry admitted to himself that he was looking forward to his encounter with Malfoy.
The morning they arrived in Manchester, Pansy slipped away early to go shopping.  They had spent four days and performed three shows in Cambridge and the level of interest they had generated in the town was insane.  Potter’s pictures had taken them from a hot ticket item to a national sensation in what felt like overnight.  Miriam was bemoaning the fact they had not rented out theaters and was scrambling to switch out locations to larger venues.  They had barely been able to leave the tour bus without being accosted by fans.
“Hey!”
Draco’s mouth twisted up.  He was obviously trying to work out how to explain to one of the ‘Golden Trio’ why those who came out of the war famous for all the wrong reasons currently avoided St. Mungos.
Pansy answered with a soft smile.  “Me too.”
“No, you listen to me.  If you won’t let your Aurors do their job in tracking down dangerous criminals then I’ll call in some favors and handle it myself.  You’d better leave, Robards.  Ms Parkinson has had a very traumatic experience and I won’t let you anywhere near her.”
Draco paused on the path as he remembered
Draco took a deep breath, suddenly shaky, and tried to keep his focus on the attack.  “I saw him, the man who attacked Pansy.  He ran past me.” And then, quietly, “I know him, recognize him I mean.”
“You rap?” Greg asked, in stunned disbelief.  Draco was staring at Pansy with a delighted smile on his face.
Draco could hear Harry’s weak, “No, don’t.  Leave him alone,” and the sounds of the lunatic trying to get up again.
“No.”
Harry flashed Ron a mischievous smile
“His lack of skills is making it harder to figure out a Muggle job that isn’t humiliating,” Blaise muttered from where he was picking out notes on the piano.
‘The trip is four hours long.  They wouldn’t attack this early.  It will be closer to the end.’
“I said fantastic news, dear.  Do keep up,” Miriam said.
There was a tense silence before Malfoy added in a much quieter tone, “... maybe it shouldn’t have been.”
Harry just sat there, staring at Ron, turning everything over in his mind.
“Are you sure?  The ‘Sly’ tour schedule isn’t that hard to come by.  Ms. Lockhard has been posting it to every social media outlet on the planet.”
“Well thank Merlin someone is acting normal,” Draco exclaimed.
My apologies for being slow with this chapter.  I was hoping to have it up beginning of the week, but it has been crazy at work.  The next chapter is also going to be slow, I'm afraid.  That said, we only have two chapters left so we're almost there!  If I don't manage to get a post up next week do not panic.  Chapter 9 a big chapter and I might need a bit of extra time to get it all worked out.
One.  Two.  Three.
“It was an impossible situation that should have never been left to a bunch of kids to sort out.  Am I happy with the choices you made?”  Harry shrugged, “Not really, but I don’t envy the situation you found yourself in.  It’s over.  We survived it.  That’s enough for me.”
“Are you sure,” Shacklebolt asked from outside the enchanted world of Harry’s delicious smell.  Draco was not worried.  He felt Harry’s response rumble up from the depths of his chest like a seismic event.
“No, she’ll be good.  She’s rather friendly with people, unlike most of the other Norwegian Ridgebacks on the preserve.  Probably because of her time with Hagrid.  And there is a good chance she’ll even remember you.  Dragon memories are amazing.”
The night seemed unending.  He picked up his pace.  “Breathing in … breathing out…”
Draco joined in.  “You do know that not a single Death Eater was better than he was at dueling and none who loved it more.”
It was a close game but despite scoring no other points, in the end the Gryffindors won due to a lucky catch by their Seeker.  However far he had come, Harry could not help smiling in nostalgia at the win.
It was a bit startling how strong his voice came out, carrying over the sound of the waves on the rocks and the wind against the cliff face.  His voice seemed to carry across the grass to the bus and the band and the scared teenagers Rookwood and Dolohov had bullied and manipulated into joining them.
“Miriam …”  Draco tried again.
“I’ve always thought so.”  Malfoy's eyes were tracing Harry’s face and he basked in the attention.  He wondered how long it was going to take before they could start saying what they were actually thinking.  It was not like either of them were being subtle about their interest.
Charlie cleared his throat.  “Ah… ummm.. Sorry, what did you say?”
“Are you asking me to explain Robards?  Because I’ll tell you right now, man, I’m out, not happening, no way.”
“Am I humming?” Pansy asked, distracted and with a soft smile on her face that Draco hadn’t seen her wear, ever.
He pushed her hair back behind her ear and smiled like the sun had come out.  “My pleasure,” he said, and Pansy believed him.  Believing Ron was becoming a habit.
Everyone was suddenly looking at Greg.
“The Slytherin Keeper?”  Harry asked.  He hated to answer but he wasn’t going to lie.  Someone should have taught this Gryffindor not to ask questions he did not want the answer to.  “Yes, I am.”
A count.
Harry shrugged, although the movement was rather lost in the jostling of the crowd. “I got some great shots from up there.”
Harry ran both hands through his hair.  “Is he purposely alienating us or them?”
Ron sighed and nodded.  “We’re always on the outside looking in.”
The clack of heels are loud in the silence of the after hour building, startling Ron into looking up from his paperwork.  “Hermione!” Ron smiled, pleased to see a friendly face.
Harry doesn’t want Malfoy to leave, but he doesn’t want to fight either, not anymore.  “Playing against you were always the closest games we had,” Harry offered back, quiet and respectful.  He lowers his head and looks up at him from under his lashes.
Ron collapsed into one of the overstuffed chairs.  “Wow.”
Harry and Ron exchanged a look.  A lot of the peculiarities they had been discussing on the train suddenly made sense.
Respectful silence hung between them for a while.
‘Come to me, little Malfoy.’
“By Merlin’s beard, they’ve got you under their spell as well, haven’t they.”  Robards sneered.  “They’re like a disease, anyone who comes in contact is infected.”
She turned on Harry without letting Draco get so much as a word in edgewise.  “Harry Potter, if I find out that this is in any way your fault you will be out so fast it will make your head spin.”
Harry’s face remained calm and unafraid as he shook his head slow and clear.  No, he was saying.  Don’t do it.
“Not here, obviously,” Draco said, but he was looking up.  Harry followed his gaze.  It was like an optical illusion.  The windows lining the ceiling of the room appeared to be two stories high, but the long figure looking down at them through the glass appeared as large as though they really were only separated by the height of the bus.
“Probably not,” Draco said, taking the bottle and replacing it with a glass.  “I took a bit of a risk here.  Let me know if you like it.”
As usual, he was more worried about others than himself.  Draco wanted to hug him and never let go.  How could anyone think Draco was worthy of that?
Ron shrugged.  “There is enough distance between the London branch of Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes and Hogsmeade that I tend to miss most of the fall out.”
“Thank you!” Ron said.  Some of the weary exhaustion lifted off his shoulders at the reminder that he was in charge, that he had finally achieved a position of respect.
“At least your mother got you acquitted before she left.” Draco opened his eyes and stretched out his long legs in front of him.  “My father couldn’t even get himself off.”
Harry dragged his attention back to what he was doing.  “Down boy,” he told himself and then chuckled at how literally he meant that.  The relationship with Draco was going somewhere.  He could feel it.  Harry just had to be patient and wait until Draco was ready.  In the meantime, Harry needed to do what he had always done, protect those he cared about.
Harry shrugged.  ‘No idea.  Neville said the potion was a personal interest project.  He was just looking for something that would have saved…”  His voice tapered off.  Even after all this time he struggled to talk about it.
“I got some great pictures of the sunrise.”
“Absolutely out of your mind, “ Ron grumbled again, but it was more of a shout now. As they fought their way towards the stage, it became an increasing struggle to be heard over the noise of the speakers right in front of them. “Hey, don’t you want to get higher up so you can see more of the stage?”
“Are you trying to get me drunk Malfoy?” Harry teased and then nearly slapped a hand over his mouth.  Given Draco’s reaction to Harry at the club he was certain any flirtatious behavior would be unwanted.  “I’m sorry, Draco.  This stuff may have hit me faster than I expected.”  He put his glass back down on the bar and slid it away.
“I don’t know,” Draco confessed and with his relief, his mouth open and everything he had been thinking since the attack came pouring out.  “I had been expecting someone to show up.  Right after the trial, or after the escape.  I was so sure that with Father’s position among Voldemort’s inner circle and my own unfortunate involvement that someone would try and recruit me.  I’ve kept an eye on Greg as well, since he is as likely to be approached as I am,” Draco paused, taking a deep breath before continuing.  “So, I was expecting that; either a blackmail attempt or a push to provide resources.  Something like that. but this doesn’t make any sense to me at all.  Why Pansy?  Her family wasn’t involved, at least not in any substantial way.  The only reason Pansy ended up on trial was because she had the balls to suggest turning you over to Voldemort to save everyone else.  Umm… sorry.  No offense,” Draco said with a slightly sheepish turn up of his lips.
“Nope,” Ron said, popping his p.  “This is going to be fantastic, between them hating our guts and watching you moon over the poncy git, I’m going to be having the time of my life.”  But there was no heat in his grumbling.
‘Ah, there he is.’
“No.  That’s a long shot at best.  I don’t want you to get in any deeper than you already are with your boss.”  Harry said, shaking his head.
“Umm,” he said and shrugged.
Robards would not be banished easily.  “Slytherin filth.  Snakes and low lifes, every one of you.”  His voice rang in Draco’s head.
Draco Malfoy simply looks down his aristocratic nose at him.  “And this is justice, is it?”  He does not wait for a response.  With a swirl of his cape, he turns and walks off.
The invasion into her innermost thoughts felt like knives tearing away at her, filleting her skin from her muscle and bone, leaving her open and exposed to the ravagings of the demon who held her captive.
Despite everything going so well, Draco was annoyed with everyone.  He was still insisting that this is all somehow part of a plot by Potter to undermine them, although he could not seem to explain exactly how their increased popularity would do that.  What seemed to really upset him was the intense stare Potter would pin him with for the entire concert.  Draco said it was because it unnerved him but Pansy had a feeling it was more that Potter was making him uncomfortable and not in a bad way.
“Hi,” Harry breathed, excited and happy, feeling like if he didn’t grip the table hard he would float away.
“Ha!”
Ron and Harry shared their own look, one of excitement and relief and then hurried to catch up.
“I could do manual labor,” Greg volunteered.  “If you didn’t have to worry about me the two of you could find something, I’m sure.”
“I know, right?  But I hear she’s alright, not like her younger brother at all.  She’s a squib, works as a band tour manager, which I guess is how Malfoy got going because she's now working for him and his band.  Anyway, it sounds like they need a band photographer.”
It makes no sense.  Why would he attack Pansy?  What is he after?”
The music was fantastic, snarky and upbeat and catchy. Malfoy crooned into the microphone, his rich voice rumbling down every spine as he sang.
He was just about to move when Malfoy’s voice picked up closer than ever and he stumbled back a few steps.  “I suppose I find Potter's lack of house pride surprising.”
“What do you want Rookwood?” Draco pulled Pansy behind him, a bit surprised that she went without a fight.  Hearing the Death Eaters voice so soon after his attack on her mind was undoubtedly affecting her.  Behind the two former associates of his father, Draco could see Harry struggling to sit up.  Even after everything he had gone through, Harry was still trying to get to him, to help them.
And while Pansy rapped, Malfoy danced. It was breathtaking and erotic. The blond gyrated wildly behind Pansy, his long, lithe body a physical representation of the music pouring off the stage. Harry could not take his eyes off of him. Sweat darkened his hairline and gleamed on his chest; the shiny green pants almost black with sweat leaving little to the imagination. Malfoy was hard, his aroused state obvious and thrilling on the bright stage as he danced for the crowd. Just like that, the ache in Harry’s chest inspired by the mourning and loss of the song transmuted into something else entirely.
“You rap?” Greg asked, in stunned disbelief.  Draco was staring at Pansy with a delighted smile on his face.
“Oh,” Arthur said with a shrug and his usual good humor as he stuck the lampshade under one arm and headed back into the mess.  “Molly will be devastated that she missed a chance to fatten Harry up.”
“Look at that,” Ron pointed.  “He’s using hook up wires to ignite the components.  Then he hides them so no one knows they are there.”
“I could give you some of the gory details of the men I’ve picked up lately,” Harry threatened.
For everyone waiting for me to get back to working on "Not Easy" I'm on it!
Get out!  Get out!  Pansy struggled and pushed only to retreat again against the relentless force that held her.
“It’s easy,” Kingsley lied, “and you’ll have lots of help.  Come to my office whenever you finish getting this wrapped up and we’ll talk.”
“Dad already said he was going to talk to Kingsley.”
Still ... the dream of having a powerful friend like Harry Potter to help him, to support him, to rescue him; it was a vision that was as intense now as it had been at eleven years old.
Ron settled back against his own seat cushions, taking up so much more room than he had as a child.  His hair was the same, a bright red that Harry could pick out even amongst Ron’s siblings.  So much else had changed since the two of them had last sat on this train.
“The ones in London are the best.  I don’t want some quack rummaging through her brain.  She’s already been through enough.”
Ron nodded and stood.  “Well I’ve had enough sitting around here.  I’m going to go find something to do.  Wanna come?”
“Oops,” Blaise responded to Draco with a cheeky grin and the laughter picked up even louder than before. “We’re not playing Phantom today are we?”
Ron turned to his father.  “I just want to make you proud.”
Rookwood grinned, small and sharp and awful.  “Here we are then.  I’m sure I don’t have to explain your choices to you, but let’s review them anyway.  You can join our cause, the cause of your father and your heritage.  The one that will see you take back the respect and position that is rightfully yours.  We will destroy those who have oppressed and corrupted our people for so long, Mudbloods, blood Traitors, Muggle lovers and all those who side with them.  It will be a glorious new world and you will have a place at my side as we build it.”
“You are out of your mind.  You were on the back of a Norwiegian Ridgeback… voluntarily… for fun!  That camera has driven you right out of your skull.”  His volume rose to be heard over the noise of the band currently center stage.  “I thought you had calmed down after defeating Voldemort.  You walked away from the Aurors, been spending most of your time at home working on your house.  ‘Harry has turned over a new leaf’, I told myself.   But noooo … not you.  You were just waiting, biding your time, lulling me into a false sense of security until BAM! …. A new obsession.  A new reason to run around riding on dragons and getting up in the middle of the night and … and …. going out of your mind.”
“He can’t even get his story straight,” Harry ranted, and Draco didn’t bother pretending like he hadn’t heard.  “Am I enspelled or blind, was the attack staged or a lover’s quarrel.  He doesn’t seem to care about the truth at all, as long as he’s right and you’re wrong.”
“Don’t break the bank on Peeves account,” Ron leaned around Harry to contribute.  “He can wait.”
Well, he was already doomed, Draco decided.  Might as well go with it.  “Yes,” he breathed back.
Ron patted Harry’s shoulder as he passed.  They had all arrived in Cambridge the night before.  Harry and Draco had found a spot to Apparate to since the band absolutely refused to let them anywhere near the tour bus, and found a B & B nearby to use as their home base for the day.  The techs were already working on setting up for the performance and with nothing else really going on, Ron went to check out what they were doing.
“Better,” Harry said firmly.  “Thank you for setting this up.”  As a professional Quidditch player, it was not often Harry got the chance to return to his first home.  That he got to do so now was a treat he was not taking for granted.  When the news came that there was not one, but two students at Hogwarts this year possibly good enough to play at the professional level, Harry had jumped at the chance to be the one to check them out.
It was like watching a pensive in reverse; instead of seeing past memories, he was seeing future ones.  Endless nights spent with these people, strangers who could not be bothered to look up and say hello.  He would get back together with Hermione in the quiet camaraderie of working side by side buried under endless scrolls.  One day they would find themselves married for years, retired and looking at each other only to realize they were strangers, having lost the ability to have fun together or even talk about anything except work.
“You’re alright!” Miriam burst through the door in a whirlwind.  She threw herself at Draco, wrapping herself around him.  “They said you had been attacked, ended up in hospital, oh I would never forgive myself if anything ever happened to you kids.”
Harry and Ron had sat in the Gryffindor risers for old times sake and the team was close by.  A new round of cheering went up when he approached and again when he congratulated them on their win.  He gave the Seeker a friendly pat and then pulled the Beater he had been sent to evaluate aside.
Watching Harry pant through the pain, Draco found himself wondering if it was worth all the crap Potter had been through.
“That too,” Pansy smiled at them.  “I’m the middle child in a big family.  We do what we must to get attention.  My parents hated the guitar ... and the rapping.”
Greg looked around the room at these people who were his closest friends.  He was nervous … but he was not alone.  He shrugged.  “Sure?” he said, knowing it came out more a question than a statement.
“Harry!” Draco screamed over the sound of Dolohov’s laughter.  He darted forward, to do what, he would never be sure.  Perhaps he thought to end things with Harry, to follow him off the cliff.  He would never know for sure.  Even as he charged forward something shot past him, over the cliff and after Harry.
“Wait, Death Eaters have escaped from Azkaban?  Who got out?  When did this happen?”  Charlie asked, suddenly very serious.
Malfoy continued.  “I have also been informed that the Gryffindor player was informed he wasn’t ready for the major leagues.”
Sure enough, Robards had broken away from Arthur and the minister and was storming in their direction.  “You’ve done it this time, Malfoy!  You’ll receive the Dementor’s kiss for sure.”
It was a while before Pansy was aware anyone else was there.  Draco kneeling next to her in the dirt and muck, a quiet witness to her pain.  She sniffed as she tentatively poked her head out of the haven of Ron’s arms.  Draco handed her a handkerchief.
“You mean the Goblet of Fire tasks?  Naw, she wasn’t trying to eat you, just protecting her eggs.  ‘Sides, the way I remember it, you managed to keep ahead of her.”
“The ‘apple of my eye’?” Harry said, but he was smiling.
Behind him, there was the distinct sound of choking from Charlie which blew any hope Draco had that his comment had not been heard.
Ron stared at Draco, puzzled for a moment.  Then his face cleared as he obviously got it.  “They will today,” Ron assured them.  “Today they are going to love you.”
Charlie just shrugged.  “We’ll see.  If he really is a changed man then I’m all for it, just watch your back.”
One conversation at a time, however.  He needed to see what progress he could make against Draco’s defenses now before he started planning what happened next.
Malfoy stood gracefully and ran his hands down his front, smoothing out non-existence wrinkles on his barely there clothing.  “Pansy has been eloquent as always.  I believe there is nothing left to say.”
“Draco did stay up all night making those ‘Potter Stinks’ badges,” Pansy said slowly.
“These, my darling beautiful boy, are the pictures Harry Potter took of our first concert.”
Ron just waved him off.  “Harry, tell me.  What’s going on?”
“Alright Greg,” Malfoy said, not letting the energy of the moment die. “One more time for the cheap seats over there.”
Draco peaked around the corner to make sure that what he was hearing was in fact reality.  Seeing it did not make it seem any more real. Harry Potter was standing in the middle of St. Mungo’s defending Draco’s band against Robards.
Draco found himself slammed back into the side of the bus, Dolohov’s deranged smile and foul breath filling his world.  “Augustus doesn’t like being compared to the head Auror,” Dolohov explained, bouncing Draco’s head off the metal at his back for emphasis.  “Makes him angry.”
Draco could not help himself, he laughed.  It made so much sense he wasn’t sure why he hadn’t seen it before.  The concept that talent and passion and hard work had earned them a place in the hearts of their fans was as foreign to the Death Eaters as it was to Robards.  It was so much easier for them to believe such success came from a spell, as impossible as that spell was.
“Yes, fine.”
“This could kill someone!”
Malfoy.
“Why would…” Ron started to rant but Malfoy cut him off.
She was cut off as her attacker cast a familiar spell: “Legilimens!”
“Nope,” Ron said.  “Didn’t seem to think it was a big deal.  Said I was too needy, that maybe a break is just what we needed to ‘get our priorities straightened out’.”  His laugh was without humor.  “I don’t think she meant her.”
“Why don’t you go find Ms. Lockhart, the ‘Sly’ band tour manager. Tell her we’re here and say we’re sorry for being late.”
As a present to all of you, Christmas and otherwise if Christmas isn't your thing, this chapter has a little of everything.
The last time he had allowed himself the luxury of a dream had been just before starting at Hogwarts.  He had been eleven.
“You heard me right.  A band.  Called it ‘Sly’, of all things, can you believe it?  Robards, of course hears that and thinks they’ve got to be awful, right?  … booed off the stage every night, that sort of thing? … he goes to check it out only to find out …”
“Yes, Greg,” Draco said in a way that suggested he was being a bit slow but the smile on his face meant he did not mind.
“I’ve never had the chance to be in charge before,” Ron called after her.  She did not even pause.  Ron looked back at Harry for help.  “I’ve always been chasing after you, or my brothers, trying to keep up.”
“Something came up at work?” Harry asked.  It was tough hearing about his two best friends fighting.  He loved them both, wanted to think well of both of them.  It was the Gryffindor in him that he wanted to fix this.
“Harry likes!!!” Pansy nearly shouted ... Ron shushed her, putting his finger against her lips.  She continued in a rather loud whisper.  “Harry likes Draco?  You’re having me on.”
“Are you saying that you saw this man right here talking to the bus driver for ‘Sly’ yesterday.”  Harry clarified.
“Better have your camera ready.”
Ron just shook his head.
“What is it?” Harry asked, reaching out towards the Bourbon, which kindly floated right into his hand.  It was a square glass bottle, clear with a black label.  The writing appeared to be in Mandarian.
“Petrifying someone is not a prank,” McGonagal said again, her tone weaker than before.  She was looking down at Peeves and Harry was sure her lips were twitching.
The attacking mind ripped out as suddenly and painfully as it had sliced into her.  She gasped for breath and fell to her knees as her attacker dashed away.  It took her a moment for her brain to catch up to what she was hearing.
“All of you?”  Harry said, a bit startled.  “I’m sure Robards didn’t actually approve that.”
“You will learn what it is to work in the dirt and filth of the Muggle world, you’re not qualified for anything else.” Robards pronounces as though delivering a verdict from Merlin himself.
“What exactly is my kind?” Malfoy snaps back.
“That too,” Pansy smiled at them.  “I’m the middle child in a big family.  We do what we must to get attention.  My parents hated the guitar ... and the rapping.”
Arlene wore a smile on her face as she left the classroom. Luna caught up to her and they gripped hands quickly. The two of them went downstairs and met Ginny when they reached the entrance hall. They didn’t even get a chance to talk before Hermione charged at them with a box of buttons saying, “Did you know that all our food is being cooked by slave labor? Under paid and abused house elves are being used by Hogwarts.”
The three girls grabbed their things. Ginny said bye to her mom. Luna had already said bye to her father. They boarded the train and found a compartment fast since they had boarded early compared most of the students.
She glanced at Luna and answered, “a lucky guess.” She looked back at Harry and asked, “any idea on what to do?”
He fell back in fear only to reappear underwater. He wasn’t drowning though. He knew he was in the great lake somehow. He was standing as if on land. The giant squid appeared and charged towards him. He tried to raise his wand but couldn’t move. No matter how hard he fought his arms were pinned to his sides.
Draco Pov.
In her first year she had received a book on her family. It had given a light history but it talked about her family being able to talk to dragons. She was now doing just that.
She looked to Arlene and Luna then said, “eat some steak. It might be nothing.”
Harry’s head swung around as he asked, “Sirius?”
He smirked. The grave was here and there was little chance of losing this construction. He turned back to the house to see a flash of light in one of the windows. He removed his sunglasses and squinted at it. He wasn’t sure if he had seen that right. There was another flash in the window.
She turned around and walked over to him. She asked him, “how are you holding up? Do you need anything?”
Adrian began walking down the hall saying, “I’ll see you later, Professor.” He knew she was trying to convince him to deal with Skeeter. He only had only one fight planned. The last he wanted to do. He just had to put an end to the threat to his kids and he could live in peace like he wanted.
Care of magical creatures was fun. Hagrid kept things simple by having them study the bicorns. He kept saying that things would get more exciting if nothing went wrong. He was being cautious after last year and no one blamed him.
They reached the right level and got off the elevator. Their guide led them past tall shelves in neat rows. Every shelf was well maintained. She stopped and gestured to a row of shelves. “This is the history of all families named Connery.”
Adrian left and returned to Hogwarts not long after. He went to his room. He pulled a bottle of firewhiskey out. He drank from it. It was then that he noticed that he wasn’t alone. “Hey Joan.”
Ginny knocked on the door and Hagrid opened it. Once he saw them he said, “come on in. Where’s Arlene?”
“Big talk.” Sirius let out a long breath. “You think you can take him in a duel?”
“Okay.” This felt like a dream. A fear that she would wake up in her bed jolted through her. It faded as Luna closed her eyes and waited for her. Arlene cupped her face. Her soft skin was pleasant on her hand. She leaned in and closed her eyes. The fear of missing was there but she pressed on regardless. Then her lips found Luna’s.
Dumbledore announced, “ah, our new Defense against the dart arts teacher has arrived. Please welcome Professor Moody to our school.” There was some clapping but most of the hall was silent. Professor Moody reached the table and sat down. He took a swig from a flask. Judging from his reaction it was something gross in the flask. Dumbledore repeated, “Everyone off to bed now.”
Luna and her sat by it as he tended the steaks. The smell of well cooked meat permeated the air. Luna turned to her and asked, “How do you think this next school year will be?”
“They had that incident last year with the Quidditch end of season fireworks where we almost lost George.  Remember that?”
“Hey don’t look at me, my nails are a wreck from all of those doors.”  Ron teased and Harry smiled back.
Draco’s sneer felt like an old friend.  “Join who?  You, Dolohov and a bunch of scared teenagers?”
In his mind's eye, Ron could see his letters and Harry’s and maybe others buried under paperwork.  Maybe Hermione told herself ‘One more report’ and then she would look at them.  Or maybe she was smart enough not to lie to herself.  Hermione had always been the smartest out of them all.
“So what’s Malfoy doing?”
Blaise shook his head.  “I don’t see it.”
Ron showing up at Grimmauld place without Hermione was not a surprise.
“Slytherin filth.  Snakes and low lifes', every one of you.”  Robards snears and I feel my own hackles rise in defense.  “You think you’re so high and mighty, but you’ll know what it is to crawl in the dirt before I’m done with you.  You and your lot all belong in Azkaban or six feet under with your rotting Lord Voldemort and I’ll not rest until I see you get exactly what you deserve.
Draco nodded, his expression serious.  “You’re welcome anytime, Potter.”
“None,” Neville said.  “The lads and I must have canvased every local business in the city.  No one has seen Rookwood, and with all the scars on his face he would be a hard one to miss.  You sure it was him, mate?”
Charlie hummed his agreement.  “Seemed to think this whole thing was a waste of time, that is until he saw yo.  He’s got a real bone to pick with you.  What did you do, kill his pet or something.”
Someone was coming.
“You alright, Harry?”  Neville asked, coming up beside him.
“Yes, right, but the REALLY bad one.”
“He needs a mind healer,” Harry told the minister firmly.
“I don’t want to leave.”
Harry stood there for a long moment and took a deep breath.
At the drums, Goyle tapped out the beat …. One, two, three and they were off.
“I can’t believe you voluntarily got on Noberta’s back,” Ron was still grumbling as they pushed their way into the Paris nightclub.  The redhead was a full head above the crowd making it easy to spot him even in the dim lights of the club.
With Ron gone, Harry found himself wanting to get caught up in the excitement of the crowd.  The beat was good, the adrenaline high and everyone seemed loud and happy.  Harry almost felt bad sneaking out his wand and doing a quick diagnostic of the people around him.
Harry shook his head.  “He was in a tough spot.  Death Eaters living in his home, threatening him and his parents.  I’m not saying I agree with his choices, but I definitely would not have wanted to be in his shoes.  Besides, your dad said it best.  We all have to let the past go, let everyone prove who they are now, or we’ll be fighting the war all over again.  He said it better than I did, but the idea is sound.  Malfoy’s just trying to live his life.  I’m not a fan of us tromping in there breathing down his neck without a good reason.”
“I thought he was only joking,” Pansy murmured, which was such a weird thing to say Draco could not let it pass.
Draco cracked a smile at that.  “Never fear, Pansy darling.  We will find something that does not require such a sacrifice.”  Then his expression grew serious.  “We are highly trained, well bred, extremely intelligent individuals.  We will find a solution.”
Draco eased fully around the corner he had been hiding behind as Robards stormed away down the corridor.  He was not sure of his welcome, to be honest, as Harry (when had he started thinking of him as Harry?) turned to face him, looking angry and frustrated.
“Actually,” Pansy interrupted again and then paused.  “I can play guitar.”
Harry believed him.  Draco struggled not to burst into relieved laughter.  He had been so sure, even with Harry’s defense of them against Robards, that he would dismiss what Draco had seen.  But he had not even hesitated, simply accepting what he said as true.
The two men glared at each other, Robards a pale angry little man versus Harry Potter, Savior of the Wizarding world.  It was no surprise who backed down first.
“Malfoy, how has Hogwarts been treating you?”  It was inane small talk, but it got the blond to look at him again.
How could anyone resist wanting something so beautiful? The thought broke Harry out of his trance and he pulled his eyes away from the stage. Once more he pulled out his wand and checked the crowd. No magic. No magical ingredients in the air. The spell the ‘Sly’ band was casting over the crowd was completely natural, a combination of charisma and talent.
Pansy had crumbled against the power of the mind that invaded hers.  It ripped through her defenses, pushing its way in and in and in.
Harry took a deep breath and picked up the camera that was hung around his neck.  “Is she going to freak out if I take her picture?”
“They are all too creative for their own good,” Ron agreed.  “But the profits keep me in a nice living.  I can’t complain.”
“Mr. Weasley, what is the meaning of this!?”  McGonagall demanded.  She had developed the booming voice of all Headmasters and Mistresses.
Behind them Ron said, “I get to be the one to tell Pansy.”
“MIRIAM!” He interrupted.  It was enough to startle her into silence.  “Pansy was the one who was attacked.”  Draco explained in a more reasonable tone.  “She is resting.  Harry and Ron scared the bludger off and then made sure she got the treatment she needed at St. Mungos.  She was very lucky they were there.”
“Hello Ron,” Hermione’s gaze was warm and fond.  “I came to congratulate you on your promotion.”
“Excuse me, sir, have you seen this man?”  Harry said, grabbing a random man who happened to be walking by.
Harry caught his breath.  “One of the two escaped Death Eaters.”
“But I thought the wards were yours.  Why can’t we get out?”  Harry asked.
I am not sure I approve.  A broken boy would be much easier to manipulate.  The control in his pace belies the tightly reigned in fury reflected in his face.  I wish I was close enough to see his eyes.  He is magnificent.
“You’d rather be there than here.”  Harry said.
That superior tone seems to drive Robards to madness.  “You still think you are better than us, what with your fancy talk and your “escaping” without so much as a blemish.  But there will be no escaping now.  You’ll do your time, just like you were told.  A year.  Do you hear me, a full year with the Muggles, working every day, no magic.  I’ll be watching.  Be assured of that, I will be watching to be assured you learn your lesson this time, Malfoy.”
Then a pause.
“Dumbledore,” Ron said quietly.  “I’m sorry mate.”
The Minister of Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt, was standing next to an older redhead that Draco thought must be Arthor Weasley who was helping Robards back to his feet.  Draco had a moment to wonder what those two men were even doing here, which led to the thought of what were any of them doing here.  That was more than Draco was willing to tackle at the moment, so he pushed that thought away and kept scanning the crowd.
