“How’ve you been?” she asks when the pink creature has flown back. “It’s been a while since we saw each other.”
Now, with Hermione’s hand stroking through his hair and the weight of Ron’s head on his shoulder, it comes back to him. The shame is still there, bitter as bile, but it’s overpowered by something so close to hope that Harry thinks he might choke on the sweetness of its fragrance.
‘That’s rather vague, don’t you think?’ Draco asks, pulling off and Harry wants to cry at the complete loss of contact.
When they walk into the Great Hall side by side, there’s complete silence for a couple of seconds before everyone picks up where they left off. Eyes follow Potter as he walks over to the Gryffindor table and for the first time, some eyes follow him as he makes his way over to Slytherin.
Right now, he thinks he might also be attracted to everything Potter keeps hidden under his terrible clothes, to the curves of him that seem to tease Draco when the jeans cling in the right places, to the edges of him shown off when his shirt hugs the muscles of his shoulders. He’s not muscled in the way fit Quidditch players are or the Muggles who Draco sometimes sees running in the gyms are. He’s still shaking off the awkward gangly elongations of puberty and the teenage awkwardness that Draco still finds himself succumbing to. But he is striking, a charming, off-centre elegance surrounding him with an aura of approachable attractiveness.
The Pureblood and Muggle Culture Project. Granger, bless her do-gooder soul had the bright idea sometime last month that a cultural integration project for Purebloods and Muggleborns alike would be a good idea. Instead of having Muggleborns thrust into an unknown world at the age of eleven where half the population took objection to their existence, Granger proposed a plan for them to be introduced to the Wizarding World at the age of nine. The Registry of Magical Children at Hogwarts updated itself the moment a magical child was born and this meant that if there were records of eleven year old children, there were records for nine year olds too. For two years, Granger suggested, her impassioned voice gaining volume and speed as she spoke to Draco, innocent Muggleborn children would be given the opportunity to simply acquaint themselves with the Wizarding World. Explore Diagon Alley, be warned against Knockturn, go into Madame Malkin’s and the like. When they were eleven, they would perhaps be slightly less clueless about the rest of their lives. Even Draco had to admit the plan made sense. He knew that if it gained traction, if Granger succeeded in blowing this project up to the epic proportions she was envisioning, it would go against everything the Malfoys had ever stood for. But in the post-war climate, at least for a few more years when traditionalist Pureblood families would be forced to show their support for any scheme proposed by a member of the Golden Trio, especially one in support of Muggleborns, it stood a real chance. It was all fine and dandy, easy to understand, very humanitarian, very Granger-like. What Draco failed to understand was his relevance to this plan. Except the funding but Potter had boatloads of Galleons stacked up at Gringotts and would likely be more than willing to help. Granger surely didn’t just need Draco’s money?
Sometimes, when dying, watching birds alight on his windowsill and feelings his fathers hands in his hair, he used to feel like a Muggle clock whose minute hand had stopped working. Going by that metaphor, he can say with unfortunate certainty that the hour hand too has finally given up on telling the time.
Harry looks up, mouth still working just beneath Draco’s navel and their eyes meet. If Harry’s mouth wasn’t otherwise occupied, he would be smirking. Draco’s lips part and his legs fall open of their own accord, but the smirk veiled behind Harry’s eyes intensifies. Draco feels the urge to blush like a fifteen year old with a crush and a boner.
“It’s something, isn’t it?” Malfoy asks, quiet pride in his voice. Harry will never understand this personal pride in something created by distant family generations ago. But Draco Malfoy is everything Harry hasn’t been raised to be—a scion, an heir. Looking at him now, in his dark robes, his elegant posture and his carefully discreet way demeanour that seems almost natural, Harry can’t help but think of him as a little prince.
The Dementors are not there anymore, but whatever created them still lingers in the gaps between the stones. Wisps of darkness settle in the frigid air of Draco’s cell, seeping chill into his bones.
He had prepared himself in abstraction for what the trip would probably entail and then adjusted his expectations around what he got to know of Draco. But somewhere, he’d forgotten to factor in the sleepy bedhead of a blond man who wasn’t fully functional without a cup of coffee, forgotten to factor in the mind-melting kisses, the arbitrary hypothetical questions about philosophy and the universe, the slow hand jobs and the slower blow jobs.
When he’s walking to the dungeons, Granger catches up to him. She’s breathless and a little red in the face but her eyes are shining.
“Whatever hair potions you use, obviously,” Malfoy snaps. “Merlin, Potter, don’t be a daft git. About doing this—this thing. With me.”
Draco’d been sick to the back teeth of it. To hell and below with traditional fucking Wizarding Society.
His chest aches, but he swallows against it and tries his best to not get too caught up in the liturgical chant of
There’s a metaphor there, Harry knows, for how Malfoy is distancing himself from the identity dictated to him by a family legacy, but for now, they aren’t representatives or metaphors, they aren’t two sides of the same coin, boys without choices caught in old men’s wars.
There’s a nudge against his arm and he turns, surprise shocking him into silence when Potter holds out a fashionable pair of sunglasses to him, another pair perched on his nose where his round-rimmed glasses were. Potter’s wiry, energy packed into a slender frame and usually, the clothes he wears make him look scrawny and a little underfed. Today, the sunglasses paired with the white T-shirt and the faded but fitted jeans make him look… handsome in a way Draco hasn’t considered this personally before.
It feels important, the weight of that admission. It feels heavier than Harry’s gait. He doesn’t know if he should pile on the burden, but he can’t help it, can’t hold it back.
Draco’s eyes are so full of overwhelmed anxiety that Harry feels quite alarmed. Hesitantly Draco begins, “If we go further than this, it will be my first time.”
“No, we’ll go,” Draco says, hauling himself out of bed. “I feel a little…” He gestures towards his head in an expansive fashion that could mean anything but Harry takes to mean overwhelmingly restless.
There used to be a time when he wouldn’t have thought twice before looking up at Harry beseechingly, pulling on his fingers to convince him to give him a back rub. Harry would feign annoyance, and Scorpius would giggle at Draco’s pout. Then Harry would give in, smiling soppily, and Draco would sigh in relief and Scorpius would watch in astonishment at how bloody happy his fathers seemed to become just by being near each other.
“C-cook with me?” he asks her, haltingly, unsure how she’ll take it. It’s a bit preposterous of him to assume she’ll say yes given his frankly disgusting behaviour as of late.
“Sure,” Potter says, recovering quickly, mouth twisting into a little snarl. “Your father wasn’t wrong about
Harry looks… gorgeous. He’s tied his hair back, now that it’s long enough for that, he’s shaved and he looks positively gorgeous in the suit, the green of his tie bringing out his eyes. He’s not wearing his glasses, probably courtesy of a strong, temporary vision charm. Draco’s glad he’s wearing robes or there would have been a dangerously uncomfortable situation in his pants.
“I’m right here,” he says, looking Draco in the eyes, grounding him to the moment, “I’m right here, with you, looking at you and all I can think about is that I don’t want this moment to end. That I want to do this, with you, here and now, that I want to go to sleep with you in this bed after and wake up and go to supper with you.” He smiles, suddenly shy and almost boyish. It’s unrealistically charming. “I want to do this with you again and again and again and again until we’re sick of each other. And I don’t think I could ever get sick of you.”
Potter himself goes through a complicated series of emotions. At first he seems as surprised by his own words as Draco. Then horrified, which makes more sense. Then thoughtful which veers into delighted and eventually settles on determined.
For the first time, Draco observes a crack in Kingsley’s facade. A chink in the armour. A flash of expression that Draco thinks is a cross between pity and sympathy, neither of which he has the pride left to reject.
“Is this not the right way to go about apologising?” He asks eventually, unsure of how to take her expression. It isn't one he has encountered on her usually expressive face.
Harry’s a quick learner, Draco discovers. He finds himself distracted by thoughts of what else he might learn just this fast and if Harry notices his inopportune blushing, he says nothing.
Draco mentally counts along. He breathes, slow and deep and exaggerated until the fog clears and the fireplace and Granger and the hideously green couch swim back into focus.
Something must have shown on his face because, for the second time in as many days, there’s a palm covering his mouth and eyes looking into his own, searching for something he doesn’t know how to hand over.
Out of the corner of his eyes, he sees Draco turn around to lie flat on his back on the bed. He still looks tired, but the laughter is brightening him, a candle glowing stronger by the second.
little aspect of his life, but somehow he can’t restrain it as it rises and spills out of him in an uncontrollable rush of twisted, broken emotions.
He stares, wide eyed at Harry who is far too close for Draco to even think properly. He smells of pine and sandalwood and Draco knows that when he brews
The word is a sentence in itself, and he watches the way half the courtroom shakes their sorrowful, resigned heads at their notebooks where they jot down his plea in unison.
The question pulls at threads of longing Scorpius wasn’t aware were still lingering in his heart. A torn cobweb that clings with its last strength to the ceiling.
Granger’s clearly too stunned to speak so it’s Draco who says, “Yes, sit down, try not to blow everything up and maybe we’ll see about finally getting this Potion done. Granger here has been fucking it up the last three times we tried.”
Instead of answering, Granger stops her stirring and looks up at him. Her face is flushed from the cauldron heat and her eyes are watering from the pungent fumes indicating her potion is brewing properly.
“Harry,” Draco says, exasperated. “I asked after you when I thought you weren’t coming. I ask after you every time Hermione and I talk. What part of that sounds like me not wanting to see you?”
“You were screaming,” Draco says, and looks down. Abruptly Harry is aware of the hand still resting on his nape, burning like a brand though Draco doesn’t seem to be aware of it. He shifts in place and waits with bated breath for Draco to jerk away like he has been the entirety of the past week every time their hands have brushed or their shoulders have touched, but Draco simply adjusts his grip subconsciously.
Draco (I’m going to call you Draco because if we are to put being juvenile behind us, we must let some barriers take a backseat),
Harry looks relieved and even dares to ask for Sunday off. He receives a vicious boot to his toe and that shuts him up.
“Come with me,” Potter says. Draco’s neck almost snaps with the speed at which he jerks it upwards to stare incredulously at Potter.
“I know,” Granger says, almost jubilantly. “I know he isn’t better and that’s okay. That’s okay because he’s talking to me!
A tentative smile tugs on Harry’s lips. Draco wants to kiss it, taste it, taste the first traces of happiness on Harry’s face. “You do have a point, I believe,” he says finally.  “But since you’re here, you might as well come in. I have the Prophet in here somewhere with an unsolved crossword.”
‘Never had any,’ Harry gasps, as Draco brings his mouth back down to suckle at Harry’s already bruised and tender collarbone. ‘Thought you knew.’
Today he sees Draco first, his head lolling back in the chair. It’s a perpetual problem every time he falls asleep by Scorpius’ bed– his frame too tall for the chair to accommodate him entirely. Draco’s taken to wincing in pain these days when he turns his head too sharply and more than once Scorpius has noticed him rolling his shoulders, trying to work out the kinks and cricks.
“It’s not about that,” Dench says now, voice muted through the protective layer of his bubble’s magic. “Someone agreed to testify as your character witness.”
“Hey, Malfoy,” Harry says, letting some amusement and a little mischievousness creep into his voice, “It was nice. Novel, I’ll give you that but nice.” He grins.
He startles at the echo of Ginevra’s voice in his head, the sharpness of her words, the precise nature of her delivery. Come to think of it, spending his year of exile in France, being coddled by his mother’s elves does seem futile. Disappointment smells of the familiarity of his mother’s perfume and the sharp tang of beer as he meets Potter’s eyes across the table.
“You’re a right blithering idiot, Potter,” Draco says and is horrified by the way his words come out slightly breathless. When Potter smiles at him, he's fascinated by the way his eyes crinkle around the corners.
Draco rolls his shoulders in his sleep. Scorpius’ hand itches for his wand. He longs to conjure a blanket to drape it over Draco, or perfect the chair so he’s more comfortable. Expressions of love aren’t frequently uttered between Scorpius and Draco, but every morning Scorpius wakes up to drapes charmed to filter in the exact amount of light he finds comfortable, and a modified Muffliato to keep all the sounds of the spells hissing around him soft and soothing. This magic, intricate and precise is as complex and intuitive as the fine arts, and definitely not Harry’s forte.
He turns to face Death once he’s sure he won’t cry. He doesn’t know if he could either way, but old habits die hard.
“Why not today? Do you have something to do today?” He casts a pointed glance at the way she is sprawled all over the couch, her legs over the arm and her head on his lap.
Harry looks at him, and Draco’s mouth goes dry at the anguish writ clear upon the slant of his mouth and the ruddy flush of his cheeks. He knows what’s coming.
“Today I asked him to go with us to the Weasleys. He hasn’t gone in months. And he got all cold and shut off. I kept asking… I kept asking why but he wouldn’t say. And I got frustrated and told him if he didn’t want to come, we’d go without him. And he…”
“No,” Harry agrees, wondering why he’d ever thought it would be a good decision to keep reliving the motions that he’s grown to associate with Voldemort.
“You spoke at my trial, spoke at my mother’s trial, saved me from Fiendfyre, decided to accompany me in exile. What I deserve is Azkaban and isolation, but here I am. And you think you losing your temper is… unwarranted? Who the
“I do feel like my interaction with members of the golden trio has been far too much as of late.” Draco grumbled as he looked up at the outstretched hand holding a cup of coffee. Just yesterday Granger had been bothering him, and now Potter was back in his sight again.
“I can’t believe we did it!” Before Draco could utter another word, she had engulfed him into a big hug as well. It was hard not to take part in the celebration, so he chuckled as he hugged her back, knowing it would be the start of many new rumours around Hogwarts.
As Draco and Pansy got back with their ingredients, they heard Shrew’s voice boom out facts about the potion. “It enhances the clarity of thought of the drinker.” At that, Draco heard Macmillan hiss loudly from the middle of the classroom. “Should’ve taken some of this before you made a decision to become a death-eater, Malfoy. Probably wouldn’t have helped though.”
Draco stirred the bowl of soup in front of him languidly. The air in the Great Hall was filled with buzzing excitement as everyone was preparing for the big quidditch game that was to be held in the afternoon.
As Draco continued eating his own waffle, Harry resumed to talking as if the event hadn’t bothered him much.
“Amelia told me you wanted to buy some pastries on the go” Harry said as he started skimming through the pastries on display.
“That’s an awfully long title.” Potter chuckled a bit. “Indeed, it is.” He said smiling fondly at the flames.
Draco might’ve been the main reason for it, as he had scurried off the moment Granger left, and was now indignantly hiding in Potter’s bedroom. Both had taken the potion and it was evident that it worked to a degree, as Draco being alone in the bedroom didn’t make him cry out in pain. However, he did feel a hefty sting in his chest that Granger had warned them about.
“Yeah, yeah…” Weasley huffed. “Doesn’t matter though, I’ll still beat you. I know how you play now!” He looked smug as he said it.
“I’m gonna die before I manage to get this transfiguration paper done!” Pansy whined loudly, earning them a shush from the librarian.
“Was it good for you too…?” Draco said looking up through strands of hair that had become ruffled by the previous actions.
“I’ll move.” Potter said and didn’t waste any time as he headed over to the couch and slumped down, clutching at his chest, which was still very much naked. The pain ebbed out as they were now standing close to one another once more. However, Draco didn’t spare him another glance before heading into the bathroom with only a small sting in his chest present. He made sure not to spend as much time as he had the day before, but just enough to compose himself from the utter embarrassment.
It irritated Draco to no end that Potter wasn’t seemingly affected by anything he said anymore. In the past it had been a piece of cake to get a reaction out of him, but now it was close to impossible.
“Go to hell, Zabini!” Macmillan sneered out. Draco saw the twitch in Blaise’s eye as Draco knew he was starting to get really pissed off now.
“It’s not… I don’t want to stop, but if you…” Draco mumbled having to battle himself between wanting to feel more of Harry and the sudden fear he was feeling.
Draco looked at him for a moment. What he was about to say wasn’t something he’d ever thought he would do. Especially since he had ironically told Pansy he could’ve said it before their previous match.
“Sounds good.” Draco muttered as he hoisted himself up onto the counter, his legs dangling in the air.
just anybody. I’m your friend, and honestly I think it would help to talk about it, you know.” Pansy said, hesitantly squeezing his hand.
“Don’t get me wrong, I’m incredibly flattered by it, but I had to put you on the spot for a second as payback for having avoided me the last couple of days for such a reason.” Potter lips twitched as a smirk began to form. He leaned in closer to Draco. “I do like you too.”
“You might be one of the smartest people I’ve ever known, but you’re also foolishly forgiving, you know.” Draco muttered, as he saw a small smile form on Hermione’s lips. “But thank you.” He added all but a whisper.
“Oh, I would never do that.” Luna said her voice tinted with a hint of worry. “It might ruin what is going on between the two of them, you know.” Luna seemed to be truthfully worried about it, which only prompted Ginny to laugh harder as she breathed out “You’re so right, I’m sorry love. There’s no way I want to ruin this blooming relationship!”
“He’s quite oblivious though, I must warn you. He hardly notices anything around him, so don’t expect him to pay too close attention to your needs. You’ll probably have to tell him all the time.” The Weasley girl got a thoughtful look on her face before she continued. “Or perhaps you don’t have to. I mean, you’ve always been ‘special’ to him and he was quite obsessed with you for a long while. Hermione told me all about it.”
With that Potter gave a small shrug, the corner of his lips drawing up a small bit. “I trust you.” Then he downed the vial. A few seconds passed by of Draco studying every expression on Potter’s face.
Sure, he wasn’t the most experienced guy, but he had kissed someone before, and it had never left such a big impression on him as Potter’s kiss did. He could feel his heart rate rising rapidly and knew Potter must’ve felt it too.
“That…” Draco shifted a bit. Sure, the first time had been fairly easy to pass off as a misunderstanding. However, this time Granger looked far more determined.
As Harry continued stroking his hole, smearing the lube he had summoned evenly across it and then slightly dipping into it, Draco was biting his lower lip, his face scrunched up as he tried controlling his breathing.
“So Granger became the minister of magic, huh? How wonderful! I cannot think of anyone more suited for the role.” Pansy said with glee, clearly meaning what she was saying.
As they left Luna’s place, Harry looked gleeful, while Draco already felt worn out from the taunts he knew would be coming his way. Harry had been holding himself back greatly during the rest of the visit, so Draco knew it had to come out at some point.
“I just don’t like potions. It’s such a difficult subject.” Weasley groaned back. “You get me right, Harry?" Weasley’s eyes were filled with despair.
“I’m sorry, mate.” Draco felt like he had finally reached a new low as he was pretending to be friends with a Weasley. “I’m just stressed from all the homework, makes me a bit on edge.”
“Hmm…” Draco hummed back, unsure of why the two of them would be having a discussion about Granger of all people.
“I’m also glad you were right.” Draco agreed, both watching the dim fire crackle as the continued murmuring voices of Ron and Harry could be heard in the kitchen.
“That’s… okay” Draco mumbled through the scarf that Harry had ordered him to wear, lecturing him on his clothing choices for the cold weather.
“It’s… well, you’ll just have to hear me out once we get back. And just as you know, I was reluctant about asking you.” Draco sighed, earning himself a strange look from Granger.
“Yes, of course, but I was just too preoccupied with the case Harry asked me to help him with.” Granger said, busying herself with looking around the room. “Harry usually isn’t too strict about it, but about you two being… well, you know.” Draco hummed in response, not overly engaged in whatever she was saying at this point.
They had dinner and desert, which was beyond what Draco had ever experienced before. He was extremely glad that he had accepted the invitation.
“No take backs.” Harry said, unconsciously licking his lips. Draco nodded as he felt himself swallow hard. He wasn’t sure who of them was looking forward to it the most.
At one point it felt like he was going to be dragged off to the sea by the strong wind, howling around him.
“Er… well…” Oh wonderful, now he was stuttering like a fool as well. Had his father still been alive, he would’ve yelled at him in disappointment for not being able to live up to the Malfoy name in even the simplest of things.
“I couldn’t exactly say no, so I just threw together what I could find” Harry said as he turned to see Draco had already got his hands on two glasses of champagne.
Draco scowled at Potter and before he had time to avert his gaze, Potter caught it. The look on his face didn’t indicate any sort of contempt, if anything it only held a hint of interest. It was weird to see Potter behaving with so much calmness. When they were younger, he would usually return the scowl and they would easily get into fights left and right.
Draco hadn’t paid much attention before he had to grip onto his broom as to not fall when he heard a voice beside him.
At that Harry withdrew his fingers slowly, earning himself a gasp. Draco whimpered at the loss of contact but waited patiently as Harry once again conjured more lubricant onto his hand. He coated his cock, and Draco couldn’t help but stare as he did.
“Alright fine. I guess it’s only in Potter’s nature to go charging forward without a plan whatsoever, so why shouldn’t it apply to his love life?” Draco sighed before continuing. “However, he’s definitely not in love with me.”
Harry wasn’t far behind as the sudden tightness of Draco’s hole made him groan loudly and with one last thrust Draco felt himself become filled up with hot, wet semen.
Granger is Granger. War hero. ‘Brightest witch of the era’ in keeping with the Daily Prophet’s overdramatic and rather amusing tradition of finding ridiculous epithets for every public figure.
If he hadn’t loved his parents, he wouldn’t be seated in front of a hostile jury, awaiting the least severe of the possible punishments courtesy of his guilty plea and Harry Potter’s testimony.
Closer to a scarf cut in half, actually. No single thread that could be tugged, just an unravelling mess of torn fabric that had once been something real and beautiful.
up?!– and in possession of every single chocolate card figure. I’ve always been special. Fooling reporters since I was eleven? Check. Dying at sixteen from a Wasting Curse placed on the Malfoy line without telling either of my fathers the real reason? Check. Having conversations with Death about Death? Check, motherfucker. Special, I tell you.”
Draco’s heart clenches at the sight. He can’t help but think this must be how Harry looks when he has just woken up and gotten out of bed and his hands almost rise with the strong urge to hold him, to pull him close, to never let this domestic vision of Harry out of his sight again. But he doesn’t, instead he raises one eyebrow and says, “Who doesn’t want to see you, Potter?”
. He has no shirt on, only a pair of casual pants that hang low on his hips like they’re about to fall off. No slippers. When he glances back up at Malfoy’s face, he notices the way his cheekbones stick out and his sunken eyes have settled somewhere close to the back of his skull. Malfoy has always been unnaturally… pointy but right now, his body seems to be only angles, nothing else. The skin beneath his eyes is a bruised purple and hangs in an ugly, unseemly way. His hair is a dishevelled, lanky mess, his skin so pale that his blond eyebrows seem too dark. He looks like a ghost and Harry takes a minute to absorb the fact that Malfoy, slick haired, snide, smirky Malfoy is even capable of looking like the apparition that stands before him. If he hadn’t known Malfoy was alone in this house, he would have probably thought this was someone else. If he hadn’t taken a moment to ascertain that this is actually Draco Malfoy (which is obvious after a careful look), Harry would have thought it was a ghost of some Malfoy ancestor.
Hermione and Ron come to stand beside him and when he says, “We’ve got to help him,” both of them agree immediately.
It’s cold, and Harry is hauled into more than twelve shops to buy appropriate winter wear because apparently his coat and his jacket and his Transfiguration skills are not enough when it comes to Draco Malfoy’s posh tastes.
Potter’s Weasley—Ronald—is holding one of his brother’s hands, eyes fixed somewhere on the far wall of the Great Hall. Somebody has reached into the heart of his vibrancy and scooped all of it out onto the blood-soaked floors. The living twin is lying on the floor beside his brother, looking up at the once star-studded ceiling. He isn’t making a sound, but he’s trembling all over and someone has placed a blanket on him that looks a little too close to a shroud.
When the door shuts behind her, Draco leans up on one elbow, facing Harry. He reaches out and brushes a stray lock of hair away from where it had caught on Harry’s frames.
Draco raises an eyebrow, and splays his hands open in a gesture of faux innocence. “I barely said anything.”
“For the war? For six years of bullying? For the Manor and the Fiendfyre and the other fucked up shite–” He pauses at Granger’s expression. She isn’t looking surprised or amused or happy but instead rather blank.
It was a difficult statement to understand at fifteen, when Death was more a point of debate and discussion with Rose than an impending reality.
“Okay,” Harry murmurs before leaning down to kiss him again. It’s dirty and quick and when Harry grabs at his dick, Draco gasps and bucks into it. It causes his arsehole to flare in pain but the feeling of Harry’s hand on his dick eclipses the pain. Harry keeps working it for a while and eventually the pain takes a backseat to the feeling of fullness and Draco finally says, “Alright, I’m alright.”
His head is pounding and his throat is parched and so dry that is hurts to swallow around his tongue that feels like a hundred pound dead weight inside his mouth. He tries to move his hand but his limbs feel sluggish and it flops to his side.
There’s a swish of air and Potter materialises before his eyes like a vision, a hallucination and Draco realises he had been under the cover of invisibility right beside him all this while.
Harry cares about Scorpius– it’s obvious. The bed he rests on lacks for nothing. The pillow is not too fluffy, the bedsheets smooth and interwoven with automatic freshening charms that activate every night. There are levers that allow Scorpius to move the upper half of the bed too sit up when he feels too weak to move himself. Though he doesn’t know for sure, Scorpius is willing to bet it is made of the most expensive materials and probably commissioned from some ostentatious establishment that caters specifically to terminally ill patients from filthy rich families.
“A Muggle-born?” Harry asks. He’s never really known the Blood Status of the other house members, but he knows at least one of Justin’s parents is Muggle. From the way Malfoy is grimacing at his pizza, he’s right. “I thought he was gay.”
“Go to bed,” he repeats, gently. She looks at the pillow beside Weasley, reluctant longing in her gaze.
He swats at her hand and she laughs. She’s been laughing a lot more, Harry notices. Ever since he started making an effort, she’s been smiling brighter and laughing more. Ron too has been talking more, talking about George, making inappropriate jokes. It twinges but Harry knows they had been walking on fragile eggshells around him for a while now. So he powers through the exhaustion that comes with the effort, the anger that makes him see red, stays quiet even when he wants to be alone and focuses on the smile Hermione is throwing his way. He might want to sleep it off in his room but if he does that, when he wakes up, they won’t be here. And he can’t bring himself to deal with that.
‘I love you,’ Harry whispers, his hand gently stroking Draco’s shaft in long strokes. He adds a little twist to the end that makes Draco clench around his dick and Harry doesn’t know how much longer he can stave off his own orgasm. ‘I love you so much.’
When his eyes meet Potter’s across the Great Hall during dinner on 1st September, Draco feels his breath catch in his throat as the potatoes in his mouth instantly turn to tasteless mush that he feels the urgent need to spit out.
He remembers the sick crunch of bones as Fenrir and Lavender’s bodies had hit the floor. Remembers Hermione’s shriek of rage mingled with terror. Remembers Lavender’s broken wrist flexing weakly.
He watches Harry hesitate in the middle of the bedroom, fully dressed with the leather pouch tucked into his pocket. For the first time this morning, he looks lost. Off kilter. Like a ship on high seas without a sail. His fingers flex in the air, and his hands reach for something– someone– who isn’t there.
The feelings Harry has been trying to suppress for the last four weeks for Draco, the urge to grab him and kiss him when he smiled or rolled his eyes at Harry, the urge to take him up to the bedroom and take his clothes off gently, sweetly, to show him that the world could be better than he had witnessed it to already be, those feelings solidify and merge with the rush of gratefulness in his veins to become an aching sadness. After today, he can never even hope to have Draco near him, close to him, want him. Because Draco had to Stun him to get him to stop hurting his friends. Because Draco had to piece Ron and Hermione back together by himself when he himself was more broken than he let on. Because Draco Malfoy is becoming a better person and Harry is slowly but surely becoming a despicable one.
Malfoy’s brows scrunch before his expression clears into one of understanding. “I—yes, yes I do. But Pansy and I were never—”
Malfoy averts his eyes. “Well, one would assume that since the war is over, the Saviour would want to spend some time with his girlfriend instead of gallivanting about the Italian countryside with a Marked Death Eater—”
“Harry. There is no such thing as ‘being out’,” Draco said, “Not completely at least. I only came out to my mother over Christmas and I don’t think most of the school actually knows or cares about my sexuality. Pansy and Blaise have known for years of course but they don’t really count, do they? Point is, there will always be people I am not out to, for whatever reason. Even if that is only because they don’t know me.”
Hermione did know multiple diagnostic charms. Neither Pansy nor Draco tried to follow her after the first complicated wand movement accompanying the string of what was probably Latin.
Inside the Hall were only a handful of students. Two Ravenlaw Fifth years were sitting at their house table as well as a small group of younger Hufflepuffs at theirs. The Slytherin and Gryffindor tables were empty as was the eighth year table for now.
Draco rushed to the great hall, he had overslept and now breakfast was nearly over. In his haste he ran head-first into someone and was just about to snarl that they should bloody watch where they were going, when he realized the warmth blooming in his chest. There was an electrifying feeling rushing from their point of contact into every fibre of his being, chasing the tiredness and the pull that Draco usually ignored, away.
Draco wanted to ask what it explained but the compulsion to drink interrupted him. He threw the shot back without knowing what he was drinking to, and then swiftly charmed his glass to refill with whatever non-alcoholic beverage resembled firewhiskey. With the 6 shots he had already drunk, he felt tipsy enough and he was unwilling to get too drunk after what had just happened, but it wouldn’t do to inform everyone else on his decision to keep his wits.
When asked for a comment in regards to his sexuality and his relationship with Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter stated: ‘I am bisexual and I am not ashamed of it. However my relationship with Draco has nothing to do with that. It took us some time to get to this point but now I can confidently say that he makes me happy and that I love him.’
“Bloody ferret”, grumbled Ron, refraining from going after the Slytherin, probably for Hermione’s sake. Harry had heard her lecture Ron about not rising to the bait often enough that he could repeat the speech in his sleep. And for this instance, Harry had to agree with Hermione.
“Conversation based therapy in itself is again a very broad field and can be found in the muggle world as well, but in general it entails regular meetings in which the patient and the healer sit down to talk about the aspects the patient wants to work on. It is imperative that the patient wants to heal in order for this type of therapy to take effect. Another important success factor for conversation based therapy is the bond between healer and patient. A healer can’t help heal a patient they don’t accept or respect and a patient won’t open up to a healer they don’t trust. Which brings us to the most important step in your healing journey: finding a healer that is right for you.”
Despite not having heard the question, Draco sobbed, “I don’t have another wand!” and then cried out when another punch landed in his gut.
It was apparently Potter’s turn to be at a loss for words as he opened his mouth and immediately closed it again. After a few tries he gave up and just nodded.
, you may call me Draco.” Despite the nonchalance of Draco’s words, he looked nervous. Grey eyes flitted across the room and Harry could see the pale skin flush pink anew. Not knowing what to say or do, he stood awkwardly before turning with a mumbled, “uh.. yeah… I- I’ll see you later then… Draco,” and left.
“Apologies, if I caused any trouble with your partners, really.” Draco mumbled,  subtly gesturing towards the red marks. To his surprise, Blaise smirked.
Instead of taking out his usual book and parchment, he turned to Draco and burst out, “I think I want to come out to the group today.”
Later that evening Draco was rereading what little information he had on the bond. He had gone nearly 18 hours without touching Harry that day, despite fainting after only 12 the day before and it didn’t make sense.
Both Potter and Hermione winced at the suggestion, darting glances to each other and Draco. It was Hermione who carefully said, “I don’t know if it still works or if it is still burning, but if it does still work it would be perfect. Then we just have to worry about getting everyone to the seventh floor.”
That seemed to appease Malfoy as he picked up the fork again and resumed eating. Harry was about to get up and leave again, when Malfoy spoke up.
With his heart beating way too fast he looked at it. Confusion hit him, it wasn’t one of the harder runes nor a new one. Surely Granger would know it? “It’s the discomfort rune,” he said, trying to not sound doubtful and even succeeding, considering that Granger sounded more frustrated than insulted when she answered, “Yeah I know that, but it just doesn’t make sense in the context of the paragraph.”
Draco felt all the blood drain from his face. “Fuck! I- I’m SO sorry. I-” he broke off and then mumbled, “I’m going to kill her.”
‘Why the hell am I here’ Harry thinks while seriously considering chugging his whisky and leaving, when Malfoy clears his throat.
Draco made a mental note to thank McGonagall for showing him the kitchens. Dinner had started half an hour ago and the halls were empty. Despite his uneventful breakfast on Saturday, Draco hadn’t felt confident enough to face the packed Hall at dinnertime and had opted for ducking into the kitchen for a quick meal. The elves were more than willing to provide some food before the official start of dinner and had even forced Draco to take some cookies with him when he left.
, he thought and straddled Blaise’s lap without hesitation. Hands reached to cup the beautiful face and instead of feigning uncertainty, Draco pressed his lips to Blaise’s, devouring the familiar mouth in a way he knew would drive Blaise mad.
He was hit with a wave of the scent of his favourite broom polish, parchment, something that he could only describe as dusty and cologne. A very expensive, exquisitely balanced cologne, he recognized from somewhere.
Hand in hand they entered the Great Hall, already waiting for the students to come in and start another term at Hogwarts.
he reminded himself, and stepped fully into the room, heading towards the small group surrounding Pansy and Hermione. The proud look on both their faces easing his nerves and making his attendance worth it. Even though he didn’t know how long he would be able to stay, he didn’t regret coming.
Rage reared within Draco and he desperately tried to quell it, his anger wouldn’t help right now, it was all in the past. He took a deep breath to steady himself and then admitted in a small voice, “If I did something wrong as a kid, father would send stinging hexes at me.” He wanted to show Potter how much he appreciated that he opened himself up to him, that he understood.
So Potter had seen what happened. Parts of it. Which parts? Draco felt his heart racing and his breathing speed up. What had he seen? What did he know?
“Understand the basic arithmancy concepts” said Hermione to him and then added for Draco, “It’s because Arithmancy is really close to muggle math and that is a mandatory class in all muggle schools for all students.”
Harry's mind was racing. He hadn’t fallen off the bed, Malfoy must have pushed him when he woke up and realized that he was cuddling with his nemesis. It would explain Malfoy fleeing into the bathroom and blocking it for at least 20 minutes.
“I was around 6 years old and Draco’s parents had been over for tea with my parents, which left Draco and me to go play together. We went into the gardens and when one of the elves came to fetch us, I jumped and fell head first into the fountain. Draco wouldn’t stop laughing for the next 10 minutes and he’s teased me about it ever since.”
Once again he cast a Tempus only to realise that it was in fact still 3:23 in the afternoon and that the study meeting wouldn’t take place for another 37 minutes. With a huff he threw his wand on top of his bed and started pacing his room. When he passed his mirror and caught a glimpse of himself, he stopped dead in his tracks. He looked absolutely awful, his hair was sticking in multiple directions from running his hands through it multiple times and his school robes were wrinkled.
“I think that’s enough for today.” he croaked, vanishing the potion with another flick of his wand. Harry nodded gratefully and moved to put the remaining ingredients back. Draco still stood in front of the cauldron, unmoving.
Potter kept up and let out a small laugh. “Any chance I can convince you to change that? Neville and Hannah asked me to help them with the new shielding spell today, but I still have some questions about the potions essay. Besides, I know ‘Mione misses discussing the Runes with you.”
Two hours later they had reached the end of the market and were positively frozen despite holding hands. Neither spoke of the kiss as they started on the way back to the cottage. But after a few metres away from the distractions of the market, Harry’s brain kept thinking back to it and to waking up in each others arms. He figured he should open up about it and cleared his throat.
Before he could properly regain control of his breathing, Morris asked again and Draco simply shook his head no. Another fist landed in his stomach. Between gasps of breath, Draco was glad that he hadn’t eaten much for lunch. Moments later he realized there were tears streaming down his face. He let his head hang.
Draco checked his watch for the seventh time that evening. Potter was supposed to meet him in the Atrium 4 minutes ago. He could AT LEAST send a quick note saying he´d run late. Well, that’s what you get for agreeing to this. It had been quite the surprise when Potter had asked him out, but Draco couldn´t say he hadn´t been pleased. The flirty looks the auror had sent him whenever they met, had slowly driven him mental.
In one of the chairs across from the ornate desk sat a friendly looking, middle aged woman with dark hair. The chin length bob swayed as Healer Hayes stood up to walk towards him. Her pastel orange robes complimented nicely with her brown skin and when she stopped in front of Draco, she was almost two heads smaller than him.
Brewing without a sense of smell was weird, Harry kept expecting to smell something whenever a waft of steam hit his face, but he didn’t. Slightly irritated, he finished brewing and waited for Professor Sondulbas to make her rounds. She declared Harry’s potion as “well done” and bottled a vial for closer grading.
“I kind of want to talk to you.” she said after a few steps. In Draco’s head a thousand possibilities whirled to life. Would she mock him? Harm him? Throw him out?
“Dean got accepted into an apprenticeship with one of the most renowned wizarding artists. He is staying on the continent for most of it and he and Seamus meet every other weekend.” Hermione whispered to him before she leaned back into her original position, taking a shot.
“I just don’t get why you push yourself so hard.” said Harry over his plate of treacle tart. “You’ve been so focussed on studying that we haven’t had time for a date in almost three weeks.”
After a quick glance down the corridor, Harry pulled the cloak from his head and Draco closer to himself to give him a quick kiss.
“I would bring you some real meals more often, but there is only so many times one can sneak out a plate full of food without looking suspicious.” Pansy sounded almost sheepish.
Brushing his hands down his jumper to stop them from shaking, Draco accepted his doom and walked with Pansy towards the common room. As promised, Hermione stood there, hair more of a mess than usual, stifling a yawn. Nonetheless, she greeted him with a “Good Morning” and a smile.
The wand pointed at Lisa next and Neville dared her to read out the last letter she had received. She took a shot and then leaned forward to spin the wand. It landed on Potter.
“I’d like that.” admitted Draco, feeling his own cheeks heat. After a moment of silence he said, “So… Boyfriends?”
“Draco, I’ve been studying with her for weeks now. We’ve spent so much time together, I could probably start calling her a friend.” her tone was as dismissive as always. “So? Will you help us?”
His eyes wandered down to his plastic wrapped arm once more, eyeing the white and yellow narcissus flowers surrounding the single purple hyacinth. Toby had designed and placed the tattoo to minimize the amount of dark mark showing through (the purple being more suited to covering the dark places than the white that barely differed from Draco’s pale skin). While the original artwork that had caught Draco’s attention in the folder had been a single dark rose, he was happy with his own flowers.
“Mounts??” Harry asked in confusion. He had no clue what Malfoy was talking about. Trelawney had most definitely never talked about mounts.
They went to a small café a few streets away. While the place was technically competition to his own shop, Draco had long ago struck up a friendship with its owner David and they visited each other shops now and then when they had the time. Besides, Draco nowadays focussed more on sweets and cakes while David’s shop opened earlier and focussed on breakfast foods.
He took a closer look at the passage and saw what she meant, he had been stuck at that paragraph for a long time too.
He knew that she worried, but he hadn’t really realised how bad his sleeping and eating, or lack thereof, had gotten. Suddenly, an idea crossed his mind and before he could really overthink it, he had gotten up and went into the common room.
“Feelings, huh?” now it was his turn to stare at his plate. He felt his cheeks heat, his blush would be quite prominent —  damn his light complexion. Harry hadn’t even admitted to liking him, just to having any sort of feelings.
Morris had the audacity to write Draco up as being late to the meeting, as if Draco hadn’t arrived five minutes before the set time, and as if he hadn’t made Draco wait outside his office for another ten minutes. With forced calmness, Draco didn’t comment on the obvious malice and instead opted to sit on the uncomfortable looking wooden chair.
“His previous experiences teaching the subject as well as his general knowledge in the field are valuable references and I have complete faith that he will excel in his new position.” stated Headmistress McGonagall upon appointing the new professors.
“I, uh, I’ve got some Firewhiskey and mead if you’d like?” And wasn’t that a stupid thing to offer. Harry nearly tried to backtrack and kick Malfoy out of the cottage but there was no snort, no scowl, no nothing. Instead apprehension and barely disguised curiosity were fluttering across Malfoy's face and a moment later he gave the tiniest of nods.
Excited chatter rose around the room and stool legs scraped on the wooden floor. Harry looked underneath his chair only to find the name “Draco Malfoy” written on it. He dropped the chair as if it was burning him. From across the room he heard his name in a signature drawl. When he raised his head to look at Malfoy, the git only rolled his eyes and pointedly stared at the empty seat across from him.
“Draco. It is good to see you.” she said dreamily, relieving him from the struggle to find the right words. So instead he sent a slight smile in her direction and remained silent. The group picked up their previous discussion about what appeared to be the necessity of mascots moments later.
Harry spent all Thursday thinking about Malfoy. The Slytherin was clearly adapt with magic, being nearly as good as Hermione in both charms and transfiguration, so why couldn’t he produce a Patronus if not for the memory?
He and Harry had spent the morning in the Hogwarts kitchen baking cookies. Or rather, Harry had taught Draco how to bake cookies. The dough mixing had seemed similar enough to Potions but when Harry had said to roll out the dough so they could cut it, Draco was confused. Patiently, Harry explained the concept of cookie cutters and how thick the dough had to be. Then they started baking.
Their discussion was interrupted however by a doubtful, “What do you think Harry? Draco?” from Hermione.
This was what Draco had been dreading from the moment his head had cleared enough to actually realize what he had done. His hair. His unmistakable platinum blond hair was now shorter, barely reaching his earlobe. In his state he hadn’t thought about any technique, style or even reason, he had just grabbed a strand and cut it off. His mind had calmed with every little
“So you wouldn’t know if anyone has any claims on him?” Chris asks with pretend nonchalance and Harry can only shake his head. At least the image of Chris asking Malfoy out helps to keep his cock under control when Chris practices the hold on him.
Draco immediately tightened his grip on Harry, fearing that he would panic at the realisation of having outed himself. But to his surprise, Harry only turned his head enough to face Pansy. “Yeah. He was hiding me, because I didn’t want to have to deal with all the stupid comments and stares.” He sounded genuinely angry.
Despite her remorse at knowing his past, Draco was relieved. If she knew about his trial, then he wouldn’t have to repeat those parts at least. Despite knowing his past, she chose to offer him help and despite his mistakes, she was friendly to him. Deciding to take the leap and trust her, Draco leaned back and opened himself to her.
“Are you going to the kitchens or do you want to join me in the Great Hall?” he asked, clearly aiming for nonchalance and failing, the apprehensive look in his eyes giving him away. Draco decided to try for the Great Hall in favour of being able to continue talking to Harry. While the inheritance issue had set their conversation back a bit, he wasn’t ready to part ways with him just yet. He wanted to see Harry’s face light up at least one more time that night.
So for the first time since they left the castle, Harry went to bed alone. A corner of his brain was wondering where Malfoy was at this time of night. They hadn’t officially been set a curfew — since all of the eighth years were of age and after the war it would have been a farce anyway — but it still didn’t seem right for Malfoy to be out on his own all day and not having returned by nearly midnight.
'Promise me to try, Draco',  he thought and instead of heading straight back to his dorm, his eyes searched for an empty table. Luckily he found one next to the wall, a bit away from the others. So he sat down and opened his book. He really needed to finish that damn essay.
The next morning, Harry sat with a cup of tea at the windowsill in the kitchen, watching the world slowly get covered in a new layer of fine snow. A man appeared in view, strolling along the path, stopping every now and then to look around. As the man neared, Harry first noticed that he only wore a pair of black trousers and a dress shirt, no jacket, no hat, no scarf. A moment later Harry noted the white blond hair and the next thing he knew he stood outside the door, wand drawn.
“Draco? I heard-” he broke off, taking in the scene in front of him. Pansy was clinging to a half dressed Draco, while Hermione stood besides them, wand in hand and sporting a slight blush. “My, my, my. Draco! If I wasn’t absolutely sure that you’re gay I would congratulate you.”
They entered the common room and Hermione offered him to join her at the study table to get started on the new assignment. This was something Draco could do, so he nodded and went to the table.
His mind was racing to catch up. In the last months it had felt like Professor McGonagall not only cared about Draco’s behaviour in the context of his parole, but also in the context of his future and health, both mental and physical. She hadn’t given up on him yet and seemed to actively be on his side, respecting his boundaries and fears.
and leaving with three new piercings, Draco once again stepped through the door, this time leaving with another new piercing as well as a new tattoo.
“Draco!” Pansy said once he stepped into the loose circle of people and she practically threw herself at him for a hug.
During breakfast, Harry sat silently and contemplated what had happened. The day before he had definitely woken up on Malfoy's side of the bed and Malfoy had definitely had an arm around him. And then this morning he had been on Malfoys side again, or at least he had fallen out of bed on Malfoy’s side. So what did it mean?
They enter his bedroom and Harry looks around in surprise. He had expected a luxurious and Slytherin coded space, but instead he stands in a comfortable room, kept in greys and darker blues.  The last of the evening sun lights the bed in an ethereal light. Completely transfixed by the room, Harry doesn’t really notice Draco slipping into the en-suite bathroom. He snaps out of it, when the Slytherin slips him a small vial.
“Draco? Is that true?” asked McGonagall, compassion in her voice, despite the hard look on her features.
Draco was shocked at the fact that Granger was genuinely inviting him, and not just out of courtesy. He wanted to be angry at Pansy for telling the other witch but he couldn’t find it in himself, not when he knew she meant well.
Looking up he saw Pansy hovering so close to him that she was nearly touching him. Her arm raised as if she wanted to reach around his shoulder and pull him in.
With a shaking hand he reached over to the other man and gently touched his shoulder. “You didn’t deserve the treatment they gave you and I am glad that you are finally free of them.” he added, hoping to comfort Potter, who leant into the touch.
In addition to the lack of sustenance there was the lack of sleep, which was partly his own fault. In order to avoid people, he tended to go to breakfast as early as possible. He slipped into the Great Hall the moment the breakfast materialised on the tables and left before anyone else had sat down, his bag filled with whatever food had been closest to him.
“Parkinson, truth or dare” the Ravenclaw asked, which Pansy answered with “Truth, I suppose.” Terry assessed her for a moment. “Tell us an embarrassing childhood memory of yours.” Pansy was silent for a few seconds and then smiled slightly.
It was Friday morning when realisation hit him in the middle of breakfast. The Patronus was a highly emotional charm, not a technical one and from what Harry gathered Malfoy had always been told to not wear his emotion on his sleeve, to not acknowledge his feelings. If Malfoy practiced Occlumency on top of that, it might just be that the git was too closed off for it. Or at least too used to not feel anything.
That night when Harry slipped into bed, he forced himself to not turn his back to Draco and instead faced the ceiling, hoping the change in position would stop the cuddling and his emotions.
A sharp tug on his hair pulled him back into reality and forced him to look up again. Morris was still talking to him, slapping him across the face when Draco didn’t answer.
Leaning in, Draco stage-whispered, “Better check your brain then darling, it has only been a year.” pecked Blaise on the lips once more and extracted himself from his lap.
“Uh, yeah. I think technically he left me a bit more than that, naming me heir to the House of Black and all but Grimmauld Place was one of the things he left me.”
“Draco darling,” Narcissa said after dinner, her voice softer than it had any right to be. “Do you want to talk about it?”
Harry nods his agreement until Draco orders, “Use your words Harry.” and he hastily agrees verbally too. The blond whispers, “How obedient, how precious.” and there’s a shiver running down Harry’s spine. Before he can relish in the feeling, Draco steps up and pulls him into a hungry kiss. With a barely suppressed moan Harry slips his hands into the soft waves framing the others face and kisses back. Their lips press against each other, tongues dancing with each other, exploring.
Most of the group agreed readily, but Cornfoot and Patil left. The remaining group settled around the small table and all of them took a shot of Firewhiskey with veritaserum.
Before his hand could fully wrap around his aching cock, Harry grabbed his wrist and pinned it above his head, grabbing his other hand and doing the same. “No,” Harry growled, “I still have plans for you.” Draco groaned desperately, his hands clutching at the sheets as he watched Harry slowly rid himself of his jeans and then his boxers.
A tentative hand on his elbow pulled him from his thoughts. “You didn’t and you don’t. Don’t you see? You don’t have to permanently suffer because you made a mistake or wrong decision once.” The compassion in Potter’s whole demeanour was strong enough that Draco was almost certain it must be its own tangible entity. Draco dropped his face into his hands  to shield himself.
The ever present smile on Gemma’s lips turned a bit somber. “I’m afraid quite a lot, even though I normally like to get to know my patients on their own terms. I have read your trial transcripts and am aware of the intricacies of your parole. Minerva also mentioned your… let’s say problems with a certain officer and that you seem to be avoiding meal times.”
“Or however that works. Eloquent as ever, Potter,” Malfoy said, rolling his eyes at him, before he apparently remembered that he needed Harry for this and settled into his friendly mask again. “I’ll give it a try, but I’ll need to concentrate for that.” Malfoy crossed his legs, leaned back against the table he sat in front of and closed his eyes. Harry simply pulled out his Potions essay and set to work.
The decision was taken out of his hands when Harry took his hips, pushed him back against the door and kissed him hungrily. A moan escaped Draco’s lips and he pulled Harry even closer, one hand resting on the small of his back, the other on his neck.
Draco winced at the mention of Harry’s place. A few nights ago, Harry had proposed that Draco move in with him once school was over, after they had joked about having grown too accustomed to each other to fall asleep without the other there. Draco still hadn’t answered the implied question.
“Drink up.” Draco orders and Harry eyes the turquoise liquid. Recognising it as a sobriety potion, he drinks. The effects of the potion are minimal, as Harry hadn’t had that much alcohol. Yet he turns a tad nervous about what is about to happen. Nervous and excited.
Pinching the bridge of her nose, Pansy interrupted her, “I know, I know. It’s just not my favourite thing to do. Most of these texts have already been translated so many times, I don’t see why I need to do it again.”
So after returning from Ancient Runes Draco went to the study table instead of heading straight to his room. He pulled out the assignment and started translating. Only minutes later he heard wood scraping against wood and the rustle of parchment. A quick glance confirmed his suspicion, Granger had placed herself across from him and pulled out her own assignment.
Draco cursed while reaching for his alarm clock. It was half past 4 and he really needed to get out of bed, but nonetheless he cursed the blasted thing for ripping him from his dreams.It had been a rather nice dream, the dark haired man had just reached for the hem of his shirt…
“Okay so your head line is quite long…. meaning that you are a rational thinker and more likely to conquer problems with logic. Your life line…. uhm… ah, there… your life line seems pretty straight, so you are more likely to tire quickly. Whatever that means. I don’t know if I would call it necessarily long or short though…”
They moved against one another coaxing louder and louder moans out of the other and placing open mouthed kisses wherever they could reach.
Draco found himself almost looking forward to their study meetings. That week's ancient runes text was surprisingly difficult, even for him, and he wanted to discuss it with Hermione once he had the chance. On top of that, his body had finally realized that he was in no danger from anyone in their little group and the social interaction had finally stopped draining his energy. He had even managed to chime in with a little joke when he had walked by Hannah and Blaise in the common room on Tuesday. The look of pride in Pansy’s eyes had been lost on him though.
The train ride had been surprisingly peaceful. Draco had simply sat and chatted with Hermione, Pansy, and Harry. As suspected, Harry didn’t seem to remember the kiss at all. At least he never brought it up or acted differently around Draco, who felt his lips tingle whenever he thought about it.
“Can I ask you something… personal?” he finally mumbled. Low enough that Draco could have missed it if he hadn’t been waiting to hear from him.
He debated not acknowledging her for a moment before he could practically hear Pansy say, “Promise me to try Draco”. So he said a low “Hello Granger” to his parchment and continued writing.
Maybe it was the phrasing, maybe his mother telling him to charm his hair turquoise was what did him in, but Draco found himself pulling back from her touch, his heart racing in anticipation of what he was about to do.
“Honestly Potter, you can’t be that stupid. It’s obvious! Your life line is pretty straight in beginning and ending, only curving slightly after the little bump in it. Hence energy high in mid-twenties.” At Harry’s continued confusion Malfoy adds, “The bump is your temporary death you idiot. With some calculations and measurements I could even tell you what age you’ll reach.
A blush spread on Draco’s cheeks and his hands began fidgeting with the hems of the overlong sleeves again. “Uhm… Sorry for stealing it?”
Granger, who had just a few seconds ago had been fully prepared to fight Pansy on her opinion, sat there and stared at Draco in shock.
Without a second thought, Draco waved his worries off. “No, it’s fine. Really. Even without the addition of coming out, the press will have a field day once they find out, just because it’s us.” A shiver ran through him at the possible headlines and Draco was suddenly glad that he didn’t take the Prophet anymore. “I meant it earlier. As long as I can tell my friends and my mother about us at some point, I don’t mind sneaking around.”
Malfoy was once again sitting on the bed, book in hand, but shuffled towards Harry at the mention of food. He looked suspiciously at the food before mumbling his thanks and beginning to eat, right on their bed.
“Do you really think I would have opened this conversation by coming out if I was just going to threaten you? Come on! That would be the worst blackmail attempt ever.”
Draco tried answering, but he couldn’t, the tightness in his throat keeping him from making any sound. This time it was Pansy who stepped in for him.
For the second time that evening, Draco closed his book. He had managed to read two and a half chapters since Pansy had left but he felt weirdly energetic. His curiosity had been growing with each laugh or snippet drifting to his ears from the common room and without letting himself overthink it, he got up and walked to his door. He quickly checked if he was presentable and decided that his black trousers and the dark green form-fitted jumper were appropriate enough for what he was about to do. With a deep breath he opened his door and walked towards the common room.
The stare turned into a scowl when Hermione laughed and Pansy made no move to retreat from the other’s ear. Deciding that it was a lost cause, Draco turned to Potter. “Uhm- So… What,” Draco cleared his throat, “What do you need help with?” He felt like a bloody child stammering through the simple question. It comforted Draco slightly when Potter answered with his usual lack of eloquence.
Professor McGonagall had written to him that she had scheduled a meeting with his potential future mind healer during lunch. The initial meeting served to ensure compatibility and to clear any questions Draco still had regarding the whole process. It was both to ease Draco’s nerves and to ensure that something like the whole debacle with Morris wouldn’t happen again.
Blaise caught his eyes and asked, “Are you sure?” which simply resulted in him being shooed away by both Draco and Pansy.
Begrudgingly Blaise admitted, “Yes. History of Magic in sixth year. I just couldn’t get all those stupid goblin names into my head.”
“Like that, do you?” Malfoy comments on the erection pressing into his back, his voice sounds slightly strained, and Harry simply tightens his hold. A few seconds later he feels Malfoy tap against his elbow and lets him go. Before Malfoy can tease him more about his obvious arousal, Malcolm calls them into the line up to see each other off and Malfoy joins him on the instructor side.
He could feel the piercing gaze of McGonagall on him, the professor clearly waiting for him to say more. He stayed silent. McGonagall cleared her throat and then spoke in a soft voice, “Mr. Malfoy… Draco,” his head shot up at hearing his given name, “I can’t help you if you won’t let me. I know you might not believe it, but I do want to help you.” There was a long moment of silence which the headmistress broke with another soft spoken observation.
I promise this is the last chapter for November 1998. Just don't blame me for what happens in December.
As she brought it up a smile crept its way up to Draco’s lips again. It really had been hilarious. A pureblood witch jumping just because of the appearance of a house elf. Most of them were so used to the elves by the time they reached any mental capability that the pop of their appearance didn’t startle them in the slightest. Most of them, except for Pansy.
Even the pain from his fingernails digging into him wasn’t enough to stop Draco from cowering in front of the looming form closing in on him. A mewl escaped him, when Morris leaned down and hissed into his ear.
“No, not everyone has one, but most people do. You definitely have one though. Do you see how your heart line entwines with another line for the first part? Crossing each other multiple times but not staying together until your heart line curves upwards? You will meet them long before you love them. The curve means you’ll get together once you openly communicate your love. That in combination with the fact that you have earth hands and your only emotional marker being lower Mars means you are too stupid to realise your own emotions.”
Draco unwrapped his presents with numb fingers and dread in his stomach. There was a buzzing noise somewhere but he wasn’t sure if it was real or if he was imagining it. The bond tugged at him, practically screaming that he needed to go to Harry NOW. But Draco dutifully ignored it and continued unwrapping. Narcissa had sent him his favourite french chocolates, beautiful silk and satin dress robes and magnificent cufflinks. But the silver cufflinks seemed dull, the satin seemed rough and the chocolates seemed to have no taste. Draco only longed for one thing and wasn’t it pathetic.
, she hadn’t invited the other Slytherin to make him feel better about being here, meaning Blaise had come on his own accord.
As though it had been an afterthought, it was arranged that those students who had signed up to stay in the castle during the Christmas break would be going on a “trip” to a muggle town up north.
After packing up two slices of apple pie he handed Potter the pie and Teddy his bag of cookies, winking conspiratorial at him. While paying, Potter mouthed a silent “Thank you” at him, glad that he hadn’t had to officially cave on his 10 cookie rule.
“You also were tortured. You were on the other end of those curses, felt them.” came Potter’s quiet reply, his hand still gently touching Draco’s elbow.
The soft “Draco” pulled him back into reality and he focussed on the man in front of him, standing by a small table. The ONLY table in this whole restaurant. What was going on? They sat down and moments later a waitress appeared.
“Hey Draco!” Pansy greeted enthusiastically, a brilliant smile on her face. Granger briefly looked up from her essay, murmured a “Hi” and continued writing, Blaise and Abbott didn’t acknowledge him at all, too deep in some discussion.
He was about to snap at the dark haired in front of him when he saw a small boy clutching at Potter’s hand, staring at his cookie display in awe. It startled him and he let his eyes wander across the sight in front of him again. Potter looked good, he realized with a shock. His hair no longer looked like a birds nest but rather artistically dishevelled with the few locks escaping his bun. His clothes looked as though they actually fit him and showed his figure off rather nicely. Coming to think of it, he looked somewhat familiar, brown skin, dark hair, fit body… Almost like the adonis….
“It’s a muggle town Harry,” came a gentle reminder from the bed. After a long pause, during which Harry just continued staring at Draco in question, Draco added, “I’m pants with muggles. Would you come with me?”
Wizarding world, rejoice! Against all indications of Harry Potter leaving the wizarding world in favour of a calm life in the Muggle world, he was just confirmed as one of two new Professors starting at Hogwarts in the upcoming school year. The other one being his ex-nemesis and now fiancé Draco Malfoy.
When Harry started to drift awake, warmth greeted him, and it felt good enough that he simply snuggled deeper into his blankets, wanting to sleep for a few minutes more. As he drifted back to sleep, he imagined strong arms closing tighter around him, and he felt content.
Before he could start hyperventilating again, he reached for his wand and canceled the straightening charm, letting his hair return to the natural waves. But it wasn’t enough. He could still see his father looking back at him from the mirror. Without thinking too long about it, Draco conjured a pair of scissors.
Having been on the edge of coming ever since he had seated himself onto Draco’s cock, Harry only tugged himself a few times before he came with a guttural moan all over Draco’s chest.
“She was happy I had finally figured it out. I think she suspected it all along.” There was another pause just as Draco finished the last of the labels. Finally, he stood up to face Harry. Uncertain of what to do now, Draco watched Harry, who was nervously gnawing on his lower lip. The small part of his brain that had been replaying their kiss over and over again was rearing up again, supplying Draco with mental images of gently pulling the battered flesh away from the teeth with his own lips.
And with the pleading look from Pansy and the enraged concern coming off of Hermione, Draco could only nod again.
“How come you’re never at meals?” Potter asked and Draco saw black for a moment until he felt hands on his knees. He blinked to clear the fuzzy vision and looked into Hermione’s eyes. “It’s okay,” she whispered. “You don’t have to say anything you don't want, it’s just a game.”
Draco threw his head back and moaned loudly as one of his fantasies happened right before his eyes. He threaded his hands into the dark locks again —  wondering when exactly Harry’s bun had come loose and released the hair —  while he tried to keep from thrusting into the warmth of Harry’s talented mouth.
Just after the last imprint had vanished and Pansy had pulled Draco into a tight hug, the door to his dorm opened and Blaise rushed in.
There was a scowl on the other's face, matching his venomous tone, “Well then you can be glad I only added it on paper. Or sad that I didn’t blow myself up or whatever.”
Moments after, Harry realises how much contact there actually is. He is basically straddling Malfoy; chest pressed together, his arms holding Malfoys arms close to his upper body. Sensing his apprehension, Malfoy worms his way sideways, lodging one leg free from in between Harry’s, grabbing his belt and switching their positions. Before he really knows what happened, Harry is lying on his back with Malfoy putting his weight onto his ribcage, effectively keeping him from sitting up, but keeping Harry’s legs free.
All of a sudden, there were arms around him, hugging him from behind. “Love. You said the exact same thing 10 minutes ago. Come on. It’s time for dinner.”
“I´m sorry?”, said that someone, who turned out to be Harry. A quick glance at his pocket watch confirmed that Potter was precisely 5 minutes and 23 seconds late. He closed the watch and let it slip into his vest pocket.
Of course Morris had noticed the way Draco had clung to his wand in their first meeting, Potter having returned it to him after the trial, and had latched onto that fact like a vulture. After the weeks spent in Malfoy Manor without a wand of his own and with many unwanted houseguests, Draco felt panic whenever he couldn’t pull his wand immediately. He even took the wand with him when he showered, laying it carefully next to his hair potions.
A moan pulled him out of his sleep the next morning. So faint that Harry was convinced he had imagined it, thinking it could have been his dream, but before he could recall what exactly he had been dreaming about the moan sounded again, louder this time. And while the first one had been somewhat ambiguous, this one was definitely lascivious.
Harry spent the day avoiding Malfoy, which was quite a feat considering that neither of them left the small cottage that the 8th years were sharing.
Another look around the common room and still no Potter. A tempus revealed that there were still three minutes to go until their arranged meeting time. Draco felt his knee bounce.
It took almost half an hour before Harry so much as stirred in Draco’s lap again.. Overtaken by the need to protect and reassure Harry, Draco forgot all about the public setting and leaned down to place a gentle kiss on his boyfriend’s lips. They would deal with everyone else later, for now all that mattered was that Harry was sitting in his lap.
Pansy looked absolutely unbothered, laying down her conclusions with confidence. Begrudgingly, Draco admired her and confirmed her assumptions with a nod, before turning his attention towards the more pressing matter.
As promised, McGonagall asked Draco to stay behind after Transfiguration. Instead of heading straight towards the kitchen though, they stayed in the classroom for a while as McGonagall insisted on talking for a bit.
He then lifted his head to look the Gryffindor witch into the eyes for the first time this whole year.
Suppressing the urge to kiss him, Draco nodded, already thinking of multiple different ways he could maybe tell Pansy, none of them really sufficient. He was still wracking his brain for a solution when they were halfway to the classroom. Conceding that no matter what he did, it would feel inadequate, he decided to just tell her.
Taking a deep breath, he stops that train of thought before he gets carried away while cleaning — again.
Draco was in the back, collecting some things that needed a refill when he heard the bell ring, signaling a customer had come in. He quickly took the assembled tray and went to the front.
“Oh but you are. You are just not mean about it anymore. It’s refreshing actually.” Harry clarified before asking curiously, “So what are we brewing tonight?”
His best friend noticed his unwillingness and continued, “I’ll make you a deal: if you promise to come on Thursday I promise to bring you food until then. This way you can maybe sleep for longer than just a few hours and you don’t need to face the rest of the school. And if you promise me to try to get better, I’ll bring you food after Thursday too. Deal?”
Tears were welling up in Harry’s eye, and slowly they started falling. “I still have nightmares about it, you lying on the floor, bleeding, dying” he admitted , swaying on the spot. It was Draco’s turn to pull him into a hug. When Harry had calmed down, Draco carefully pulled himself out of the hug and coaxed his companion into walking with him. With both of them emotionally exhausted, dinner was out of the question but they were close to his flat.
Draco had planned on getting changed himself anyways and simply shrugged. Together they stepped out of the Room of Requirement and headed for the 8th year common room.
Clearing his throat, Draco began his explanation, “Okay. The base of a potion always contains one of 6 different available bases. There is water, distilled water — and yes that makes a difference — oil, aquarum munitio, aqua vitae and umor nocere. The latter two are not commonly used, and you won’t personally handle these as they require a potions mastery. So most Potions you will personally come across will either use some kind of water, some kind of oil or the aquarum munitio as a base.”
After Dean’s rather unsuccessful attempts at sketching Harry’s unruly hair, Harry found himself alone in the kitchen and decided to bake — Molly had taught him how during the summer and Harry had missed doing so while at Hogwarts.
“Groups of people make me nervous now. Or well most do. Hermione and Pansy have a study group I’m now a part of… Took me a while though.”
"I do, in fact. Although I mostly keep it in my room." Draco noted with interest, that Blaise looked a tad flustered at the confirmation.
“Thank merlin you’re still here,” panted Harry once he reached him. Draco raised an eyebrow at him. Every cell in him wanted to know where Harry had been the past few days, but he kept silent.
The use of the b-word brightened Harry’s features instantly, and Draco wondered if he too looked that sappy when thinking about Harry as his boyfriend. He assumed that he did. Giving Harry a quick kiss, he ushered him to one of the work stations.
It took Harry a moment to get used to the stretch, but once he did, he started fucking himself on Draco’s cock, riding him in earnest. Draco’s hands were still clutching at Harry’s hips, tight enough that it would probably bruise. “Harry” he groaned urgently, wanting to move,
It was then, Draco ran his eyes over his date. The git actually had the decency to show up in something resembling formal wear. Dress pants with a muggle dressshirt and a modern take on wizarding robes. All of them in subdued earthy tones complementing his skintone. Impressive as well as promising to the rest of the night.
“Might I suggest a turquoise?” Narcissa proposed, causing Draco to whip his head to her. “It would portray you as more of a rebel against your former beliefs rather than just hiding from them. Plus it would suit the general… style you seem to favour nowadays.” Despite her best efforts she couldn’t stop from scrutinizing the fashionably ripped jeans Draco had put on that morning.
Suddenly he was falling and then there was cold, hard wood beneath him and Harry realised that he must have fallen off the bed. With a groan he heaved himself from the floor, watching as Malfoy hurried into their en-suite.
His bakery was close enough to his flat that he could walk. He reached the doors as it was nearing 5am and let himself in, locking the door behind him. Dragon Cakes and Coffee wouldn’t officially open until 10am.
It felt like years rather than months since their first kiss on the exact same sofa. Between Christmas and the end of winter holidays they had spent nearly all their time on this sofa, reading, talking and writing essays side by side, always touching. Draco didn’t know if it was the bond helping things along or just a side effect of spending so much time in close proximity, but a week after Christmas, late at night after a lengthy discussion they had simply sat in comfortable silence. They had sat face to face, only their socked feet touching, when suddenly Harry had leaned over, eyes questioning, asking him if he could kiss him.
Draco, driven by the pull, had gone looking for him, but to no avail.  His body impossibly tired and cold, Draco took each step to the 8th year dorms at a glacial pace, wincing with every movement. He had been stupid to call this sense of longing a pull before, because now it really was a pull; now it felt as though someome had rammed a hook through his chest and was reeling him in.
He should have known that it wouldn’t help, but he hadn’t expected to make it worse. Instead of waking to an arm around his waist and a Draco warming his back from a small distance, Harry woke on his back, arms wrapped around a sleeping Draco Malfoy, who lay half on top of Harry.
Finally saying the words out loud to her felt like he was diving too fast, his broom hurtling straight towards the ground, not knowing if he would be able to pull up before crashing. His hands were still shaking badly, heart still racing and tears still gathering in his eyes but it didn’t matter. Right that moment he was weightless, his broom may have been hurtling towards the ground, but right then he was still falling freely.
“Is there a problem regarding my sexuality?” he simply asked, after almost 5 minutes of uncomfortable silence. The shocked expression on Potter’s face was almost worth the awkwardness of the situation.
A doubtful sneer arranged itself on Morris´ face upon the affirmation. While writing something into Draco’s file, he muttered to himself, “How could Death Eater scum like him show good behaviour? Do they even realize that there's more to good behaviour than just
Before Chris can answer, Malfoy appears with a coolpack ordering him to cool his nose. When he is satisfied that Chris is cared for, he turns to Harry.
At half past 8 the cookies had finished baking and were laying out to cool. Grabbing his thermos and one still warm swedish short snout that had sadly suffered the loss of one of its wings, he sat down for a short break.
“That’s like saying that I killed him because I didn’t pull him onto my broom. It’s stupid and you know it. It was an accident.”
Malfoy’s hand made no sense. It was clear that the lines belonged together but they were definitely separate. Harry had never seen something like that before, but then again he normally didn’t go around watching other people’s palms. With a shrug he gave up and told Malfoy that that was all he could read from him.
Pansy walked with him when Draco left the study table to head back to his dorm. The few metres were spent in companionable silence but the moment Draco closed his door behind them, Pansy erupted, “What made you so gloomy earlier?”
Draco flopped onto the couch and immediately laid his head in Harry’s lap. Without pausing his conversation with Hermione, Harry reached a hand up to absentmindedly stroke his hair. A few minutes later, when Hermione had buried her nose in a book again he finally looked down, “Hey beautiful. You okay? It’s almost been a day.”
“Erm… I mean… If you wouldn't mind?” Potter said to him and oh. He wasn’t opposed to the idea? Mind reeling, Draco realised that this could be his chance to make up for all his wrongdoings against the man.
Harry kissed his cheek and Draco in turn moved to catch his lips with his own once more. Their first official kiss as boyfriends started sweet enough, but as both were reluctant to break it and sitting side by side was rather straining on their necks, it turned heated rather quickly when Draco switched from sitting next to Harry to straddling him.
A soft “Malfoy?” pulled him out of his research 20 minutes later. When he looked up he saw Granger looking at him almost apologetically. “Could you help me with this specific rune? Pansy said you likely finished  the assignment already.” She pushed her parchment to him and pointed at the rune she meant.
A reassuring smile appeared on McGonagall's face. “I am glad that your friends are trying to help you. Should you ever want professional help though, I am more than willing to organize a meeting with a mind healer for you.”
“Look at me,” Draco said gently, carefully placing a finger under Harry’s chin to lift it, “I’m not mad at you. We were at war and I tried to cast an unforgivable at you, so you reacted in the way you were trained to. I don’t hold it against you and neither should you.”
So now they waited as the rest of the class trickled out of the room. Pansy squeezed his hand in support and then motioned for him to step up to their professor.
The stag erupted from the tip of his wand, lighting the room with its bright silver light, cantering across the tables around them. It came to a gentle halt next to Harry, its light dimmed as not to blind them. With his front legs next to Harry’s shoulder it gently nudged Malfoy’s shoulder with its snout. The blond hesitantly reached up to place his hand on the Patronus and after a moment the light dimmed further and the stag slowly vanished.
Oh did he try kink. Harry’s cock throbs with interest at the question and Harry smirks. “Yes”  The answer earns him raised eyebrows and a head tilt, obviously asking him to elaborate. Smugly, Harry stays silent.
“Shut up Malfoy. As long as we can’t stay in the castle, this is my room too.” Harry replied,  too tired to argue. The day had been draining enough and he simply wanted to go to sleep, even if that meant sharing a bed with Malfoy; at least the bed was big enough for two.
As the cottage filled with the scent of vanilla crescents, most of the other residents came shuffling into the kitchen one by one, at which point Harry decided to put on some hot cocoa while they waited for the crescents to cool. Standing in the kitchen with Dean, Hannah, Neville and Susan was surprisingly nice. There was powdered sugar everywhere, Neville had a cocoa mustache and with the laughter filling the room, it almost felt like they were just normal teenagers. Harry startled when he saw Malfoy rush past the kitchen and  drenched himself in his cocoa, the laughter only grew stronger. With a swirl of her wand, Hannah cleaned his clothes.
With a groan, Harry buried his head in his hands. He knew how Malfoy must have felt in that very moment. He had felt all of that in the weeks leading up to his break up with Ginny. Shame. Panic. Helplessness. The constant fear of someone finding out and outing you to everyone else.
Both of the girls showed up a few minutes late, Hermione's hair looking more frazzled than usual. Draco had just started on his arithmancy equations when someone cleared their throat and the voice that Draco sometimes heard, saving him in his nightmares asked, “Is there still space for me?”
“Bottom” Harry answers, way too quickly for his own liking. Playing it cool he adds, “At least if the top knows what he’s doing.”
Lunch after all wasn’t an unpleasant affair. Potter was a surprisingly decent lunch companion, the conversation was easy and his manners weren’t revolting, and aside from Pansy and Hermione, no one looked at Draco twice.
Draco had only stared at him before finally gathering his wits. “Sure. Although if you want to be able to do it yourself you need a better understanding of the basics and the ingredients. I could tutor you if you want? Consider it payment for helping me the other day.”
That surprised him. He was so certain that she still despised him. In an attempt to distract Pansy from the original question he asked, “Since when is she Hermione to you?”
He had gotten to know the castle quite well in the last month hiding from human interaction, and in the process had found multiple out of use classrooms, little nooks and even a secret tunnel connecting the west tower to the hallway near the transfiguration classroom.
They passed stands full of sweets, mulled wine, hot mead and stands selling handcrafted items; pottery, candles, woodwork, lanterns… everything obviously made with love. Each stand Draco stood and admired the artworks, occasionally involving Harry to help him with the muggle money when he bought something.
“Used to being the key factor here Mr. Mal- Draco. Let me ask you a question. Did you want to be a death eater?” The gentle tone of her voice tore a gasp out of Draco.
For the first time this school year Draco was glad when dinner rolled around. Albeit he had simply studied, but the presence of the Gryffindor witch had had him on edge all afternoon and he was drained.
Malfoy only yanked his arm away and spat, “Even you can’t magically give me a fucking memory to rely on, wonderboy.” before he hurried out of the class.
Malfoy seemed to have understood, as he reached for the Firewhiskey, refilled his shot, drowned it and refilled again. “Never have I ever saved the world.”
Draco felt himself blush more violently, “I thought I was just imagining it, that you came for the sweets and maybe later on the friendship,” he whispered. Not once had he dared to hope that Harry might reciprocate his attraction.
The next time he woke, it was because Harry was moving in his arms “mmh, stay, ‘s nice,” he murmured, unwilling to lose contact with Harry, but the stubborn man kept stirring until  Draco finally released him.
“No unsanctioned spells, no complaints from the Headmistress. How utterly obedient. I’d say following orders seems to be something you’re good at, but I don’t believe you. Where is your second wand? Where?” The original hissing had turned into yelling.
“Dunno. I thought about it, but then I just went to get tea.”  He reached up to scratch his neck. “Waking you up would have been weird. So I just… left.”
By Sunday, Draco had skipped another five meals and it wasn’t even lunch yet. He had tried to go down for dinner on Saturday, after Pansy’s endless nagging had grown to be too much.
“Thought so. There’s too much old damage in between the fresh stuff. Some internally bruised joints and a few bones that haven’t healed correctly, but I doubt that those need to be reset if they don’t bother you right now.”
Draco pulls his hand from Harry’s neck and thrusts into Harry even faster, chasing his own release. The fingernails that are still digging into his back and the pulsing of Harry’s walls around his cock pushes him over the edge as well, and his moans mix with Harry’s as Draco pumps his release into him.
The both of them had convinced him over the course of multiple meals and a free Saturday morning to tell McGonagall about Morris, and had offered him their support, which he had gladly accepted.
Deciding that ignoring Blaise was probably the best plan of action, Draco simply countered. “I was hoping to talk to you to verify that I didn’t cause you any trouble with your… with Neville.”
He seems to be half dead. His eyes are drooping with bags underneath them, his hair… oh, his hair. His skin has unhealthy, almost yellowish pallor to it and his lips are chapped and so dry that in one corner there is dried blood. His cheekbones and his chin seem to be knife sharp and without thinking, he brings his hands up to his face and covers it, hiding himself from the terrifying vision he has become. He has always, always been surrounding by beauty since his childhood but his appearance now is closer to the carnage he has witnessed under Voldemort’s fist of power than the carefully maintained Malfoy scion he used to be once upon a time. The knowledge that Potter has seen him like this… it makes him want to down the entire bottle of Calming Draught.
Without thinking of the consequences, afraid he will run if he pauses too long to overthink, Draco takes out his wand and fires a Stunner at Harry. Hearing his voice murmur the spell, Harry turns around, wand pointed, lips curving around a spell of his own but the Stunner hits him in the chest when he least expects and he falls to the floor, limbs sprawled, wand rolling out of his hand. Weasley is still sitting on the floor and having no idea what to do with him, Draco chooses to focus on Granger whose shrieks are even louder in the silence following Harry being stunned.
Draco watches the muscles of his arm strain against the black fabric of his shirt and his mouth waters. Harry’s so fucking strong, and he understands it so much better in these moments where he gets to just observe.
“I have to go to–“ he begins apologetically, gesturing towards Scrivenshaft’s large display a little beyond them.
Draco sighs. “I betrayed the castle. Dumbledore was never my favourite person and McGonagall always did have it out for me and Hagrid… you know I don’t like Hagrid. But Hogwarts was my home, the Slytherin dungeons were where I grew up. Made friends. Became Draco Malfoy. And I betrayed Hogwarts and its safety.” He looks at Harry who is looking back at him strangely. “So I’m not afraid of the students or McGonagall or the teachers. I’m afraid to face the castle itself, knowing what I did to it.”
Harry groans when Draco shifts his angle slightly and reaches up to grip the pale hips harder. Draco’s skin feels like silk and Harry realises that he could probably spend an eternity just touching him and he wouldn’t feel the need for much else.
Harry’s barely cognisant of the tears covering his face and the sounds he’s making are a distant litany of nonsense. All he’s aware of are Draco’s fingers holding on with bruising force to his hips, and his mouth performing wonders everywhere on Harry’s body.
He has never been able to admire arrogance, but there is a quiet reverence in Malfoy’s gaze as he sweeps it over the marble steps and the stained glass of the upper storey windows that renders him speechless as he watches. The villa is indeed something, but Malfoy on his terrain, comfortable and kingly is something else entirely.
In fact, in those odd, numb moments, he finds himself able to actually reflect on the conventional things people expect him to reflect on: what comes after? Where do I go? What happens to the people I leave behind?
“I defeated the Dark Lord with Draco Malfoy’s wand. I watched Tom Riddle’s body fall to the floor of the courtyard with the magic I cast with Malfoy’s wand. And whether this courtroom pardons him or not, I will remain indebted to the give of his grip and his uncertainty in his own indoctrinated beliefs. Without it, none of us would be here today, systematically exterminated by Voldemort and his followers.”
Harry smiles in exasperation– he knows she wants to boss around the others in the department by actually giving them something to do, assuming some power as the bloody Head Auror’s secretary and when he finds some particularly boring reports that has traditionally been the Head’s duty to fill out or look through, he relegates it to the pile to be given away simply to give her a laugh.
“There was a woman, Anuradha Choudhury, about six generations ago, who married into the Black family. Very upper class betrothal, despite it being overseas. Prestigious Wizarding family. Indian origins.”
“Darling, does it make you happy?” Narcissa had asked, when Draco had been looking through potential offers for the new line.
“Draco…” Harry begins, and his voice sounds small, far away. “You’ll let me know if you need any… signatures, yes?”
Draco raises a hand to his hair and tries to keep it out of his sweaty face as his over sensitised channel continues to clench and undulate against Harry’s dick. It’s a few moments of this and Harry is coming, deep inside Draco and Draco is crying and sobbing and desperately trying to not keen and fall over from the pleasure he feels cresting though his dick remains soft.
Draco shakes his head. “You know, I always thought that all those stories about you and Hermione and Weasley were exaggerated tales that originated in the Gryffindor Common Room. They aren’t, are they?”
“How many loose ends did you have left?” he asks the picture, tracing the line of the plump cheek. “How many did you tie up?”
They pull away for a moment, just to catch their breaths, foreheads resting against each other’s, breaths mingling in the tight, warm space between their mouths, where everything feels safe.
“I think you should just be focusing on getting some rest and eating three square meals a day,” Molly says, ladling out a pile of bangers and mash onto Bill’s plate. “I don’t care what you do as long as you stop being a bag of skin and bones.”
Harry… a wave of misery travels down Draco’s spine at the thought of Harry. Harry who had been his friend after the war, Harry who brought him pancakes and muffins and cake and tarts for lunch. Harry who helped him clean out Voldemort’s quarter, taking care to remove lingering traces of Dark magic from the floorboards. Harry who solved crosswords with him, or rather talked at him while he solved them, Harry who always came in with full knowledge of every Quidditch match that had taken place in the past few days.
They both rise to leave, but panic grips Scorpius. If they leave together, they’ll invariably argue about how to go about this. It won’t be a fight– his parents are past that– but it will be time-consuming, vicious and Scorpius, despite his best efforts to put himself last, finds it unbearable to allow his fathers to argue in these moments. He can feel his last few minutes trickling away like sand.
It’s a long time before anyone speaks. It’s Harry who breaks the silence eventually. “Do you want me– want us to call anyone, love? To talk? We can let them know… before.”
The veil lifts, the haze covering his emotions shifts away with the gulps of drink he takes. It all hits him at once, the euphoria of having been kissed so thoroughly, so magnificently. The bliss of that one perfect moment after they had broken apart with Harry’s eyes still closed, Draco’s breath ghosting over his lips, his fingers still stroking Harry’s jaw gently.
“I’m sorry,” he says again, and bats away the thought which whispers his father’s disappointed words in his ear.
“I love you both, you know that, right?” he says, closing his eyes against the sappiness of the words and the onslaught of tears. “I love you so much, and I wish I could have been here longer. With both of you.”
Even though he intends the question for Hermione, Harry fixes a hard glare at Malfoy whose eyes had widened when he started speaking, who now flinches and shies away. Hermione herself doesn’t look fazed in the slightest and replies, “He’s here to discuss the Pureblood and Muggle Culture Project with me.”
Before any of them can register that Malfoy has begun to speak, Harry has to bite his tongue from gasping in shock. A split second before he opens his mouth, the Glamour Malfoy had maintained so carefully from the start collapses and Harry sees the emaciated ghost he had seen in the Manor two days ago. Malfoy doesn’t seem to notice. Instead in a trembling voice he says, “I don’t think I can explain how sorry I am for those years. I was a child and that isn’t, isn’t an excuse but it is, it is an explanation. My father was… strong. No one went against him and when he told me something was right or told me I had to do something, to go against it was unthinkable. He spoke about the glory of the Dark Lord and I believed him. He said, he said Mud–Mudbloods were filthy and Muggles were the bane of our existence and I… believed him.”
Harry who’s lower lip is trembling just slightly. Harry who leans into his touch when Draco raises a hand to his cheek.
His clock has stopped, the slowing hands finally accepting the inevitability of the end. He presses a hand to his chest. There’s no heartbeat.
A young wizard of forty two, the Saviour of the Wizarding World, an attractive, kind man– the minute Harry was single again, witches and wizards would be falling over themselves trying to catch his eye.
Draco looks away. The clouds outside still obscure the stars like blankets of darkness, but here and there flickering lights rise like phoenixes.
Draco’s trekking up the slight incline of the cobblestone pathway, Potter a couple steps behind him. The sun, an orb of harsh glory, reigning across an azure blue sky, beats down on their backs. Only the Cooling Charms Draco has to keep casting periodically keeps him from melting into a puddle of sweat-slicked exhaustion into the cracks between the stones his boots are catching on.
“Rose and Hugo would be nice,” he says instead, clearing his throat. “Merlin knows Rose will bring me back and kill me again if I don’t say goodbye. Victoire and Teddy too. Aunt Hermione, if she’s not too busy. Ginny, please. She made me promise… Oh and,” he closes his eyes and smiles, “Professor McGonagall. If she agrees.”
Taking Granger’s arm in his, he leads her down the stairs, sits her down in the untouched kitchen and asks her to help him make the cocoa. “Just sit there and tell me where what is and I’ll do it,” he tells her firmly when she attempts to get up and make it herself. She slumps in her seat.
‘Yes,’ Harry groans, letting his head fall back against Draco’s chest, allowing him better access to the tender juncture of his neck and collarbone.
“All of… that.” Harry makes an expansive gesture between them that seems to suggest the happenings of the evening in their entirety.
If Malfoy is a prince and they’re going by fairytale definitions of such things, the analogy seems to suggest that Harry is the dragon given that at the moment, watching Malfoy’s arse stalk through the streets of Florence, Harry wants to eat him.
“What I don’t understand,” Scorpius says, after a while of watching Draco swallow orange liquid, without looking like he has any bit of life left in him, “is why
“You’d know,” she’d thrown right back at him, before venturing further in to stare in wonder at the stacks of notebooks.
His neglected dick bobs in the air but Harry pays it no mind, continuing his assault on Draco’s nipples. At the hint of teeth, Draco gasps and arches, with the soothing suckling he moans in pleasure. At the rough pinching and nibbling, he thrashes his head from side to side, lower lip pulled into his mouth, eyes closed and forehead scrunched.
His head snaps up at that. The guilt in her eyes, in every line of her clenched jaw, in the tightness of her mouth is evident. She sighs when their eyes meet and he wonders how half an hour has reduced the bubbly delight of a person on the sidewalk to
Malfoy meets his eye and smiles. “There’s no need for the games, Potter. If I’m not hallucinating, then I’ll come with you willingly.”
Harry smiles, gently and sweetly, completely at odds with the way he was talking a few moments ago and kisses Draco again. This kiss is laced with promise, tasting of salvation and smelling of sweat and skin and sex. Draco’s never had a better kiss.
Parvati’s dark eyes are hooded, but dry. “Ma really will kill me, then,” she says with a slouching shrug. There’s something broken about her posture. Errant strands escape her tight braid, sticking to the sweat on the side of her face. There’s a broad gash above her eyebrow, caked with dried blood and dust. Up close, her skin looks unnaturally pale.
In the dead of the night, he had ripped off some of his own coverings from the bed and brought them down to the cellar. She had been asleep but Ollivander awake and he had handed over those blankets to the wand maker with instructions for him to keep Lovegood protected from the damp.
Once again Draco felt worry seep through his body. Despite the lightness from the fire whiskey, he was still glaringly aware of the future and what it might hold.
Harry positioned himself better and lifted Draco’s legs up slightly, allowing him better room to enter him. He coated his cock in lube before guiding it to Draco’s entrance.
A few more days went by as they all gathered together in the evening to discuss the plan and how it would go down. Ginny was particularly clever and looking into details about it, while Ron seemed to think that jumping in when the time felt right was the best decision.
“Of course they would. They’re able to get high quality potions there, so it’s no wonder they start to frequent it. I just gave a little push is all. Nothing big, but people seemed to spread the word like fire.” Hermione chuckled.
“If I get the chance, I might stop by some day.” Draco said, returning to his work. He knew it was a lie, but it seemed easier than trying to argue with Granger. He had seen first-hand how impossible it was and how much misery was plastered over Weasel’s face when he tried to argue with her.
“No, there were moments where it was just… dreams I guess.” Draco’s voice came out softer than he had intended. He quickly cleared his throat.
Harry slid his hand down to his cock, stroking it to the pace of his thrusting, making Draco whimper. “God. It’s so good. Fuck.” Draco felt himself start to ramble as he was building up.
The door jingled and Draco turned around to find himself looking at what he could only describe as the closest thing to an actual angel.
“You need to try a bit harder if you want that to sound believable, Malfoy.” Potter said a grin on his face, while Ginny barked out a laugh.
Was Potter… insinuating something else? No way! Draco almost laughed internally at himself for even thinking such a thing. Sure, he couldn’t help but appreciate good looking people, and he wasn’t certain if he had ever seen anyone as handsome as Potter. But of course, their history made it impossible for anything to develop between them, that was undeniable.
“Then tell me, are you going to use an unforgivable on me?” Potter’s gaze was piercing although his voice was still calm and without a hint of fear. Draco felt his hand twitch and he could feel the sweat start to form as he clenched the wand tighter. He had experienced both receiving and forcibly carry out unforgivable curses during the war, and just the thought of them made him feel nauseous.
“Oh Merlin…” Draco buried his face in his hands in resignation as he regretted not just having let the Death Eaters kill him when they had the chance.
“Yeah, what a bummer. I was the perfect bait.” Draco bit out, uncertain as to why he felt angry at Potter’s way of thinking. He was being cunning after all. A true Slytherin would be proud.
Draco didn’t know what came over him. Perhaps it was just a moment of curiosity and fascination combined with not being fully awake, but he couldn’t help but stretch his fingers out and slowly move his hand with a light touch to feel the outlines of the defined muscles underneath the golden skin. Potter’s body was firm and incredible warm, so different from his own. It was soothing to be this close to someone who gave off such a strong aura of protection.
“You think I’m so weak that it would warrant a bloody warning before-” Draco was cut short by the hex throwing him off his feet. He groaned as he hit the floor, feeling like his pride had taken most of the damage. That bloody Potter and his freakishly fast reflexes, Draco thought bitterly.
“I was surprised indeed, but I can’t deny how important a creation you’ve made has been for me. Since I don’t know you personally, I can’t say much about my own thoughts, but knowing Hermione trusts you enough to call you her friend, I suppose a lot of things must have changed since the war.” She reached out her hand, and Draco looked at it for a moment, before taking it. “The world is a better place now, and if Hermione is willing to turn a new leaf, so am I.” She shook his hand and chuckled lightly. “No need to look so shocked. I will definitely come back here again when I need potions of any sort. Good day, Malfoy!”
What the hell?! Draco thought to himself. He could feel his heartbeat at an incredible speed and pulling aside his covers, he saw the result of the far too vivid dream.
“I think you’ve got something of mine.” Potter furrowed his brows as he looked at the wand in Draco’s hand. “Have you truly decided to sink as low as becoming a criminal?” Potter’s voice was challenging, but Draco could see Potter’s lips quirk a bit as if he found the situation amusing.
He slid his hands down Draco’s legs and slowly spread them apart, making Draco shiver. He felt too exposed, but at the same time it felt safe. Like knowing that Harry would be careful, that he wouldn’t rush.
Harry got the fire going before heading to the kitchen. Draco was still fumbling a bit, and Harry noticed that he had probably spent a lot of time mustering up the courage to do this.
“I’m just curious. I’ve known you were able to conjure one for many years now, but I’ve never actually seen you do it myself.”
“All yer first years, follow me!” Hagrid shouted over the crowd of students. Draco saw a bunch of tiny students tripping on their cloaks as they hurried over to the boats. It made him remember the first time he had been to Hogwarts. The boat ride towards the castle had been exciting and scary at the same time. He had been filled with awe and confidence as he was still too young to know what was to come.
The first pull was agonizing. Both the sting and the emptiness left by Harry’s cock made him whimper. But then came the push and he was filled right back up, warmth engulfing his hole once more. Harry continued pushing into him in a slow and steady pace.
“Look at this!” Potter furrowed his brows as he looked at the potion Hermione was proudly showing off.
And Harry acting normal and clueless was incredibly good for Draco, because at this point he was being far too aware of Harry and his confusing feelings towards the guy.
It didn’t take long before the house was filled with Ron, Ginny, Hermione and Luna all sitting together and discussing strategies.
“The nerve!” Draco said, as he smacked Potter over the head, regretting it a second later as he realised it was his own body that he was putting through the rough treatment. However, it had done the trick.
Draco turned around, with some difficulties in the way too small bathtub (in Draco’s opinion). Sure, Harry had told him they could change it, but Draco had refused it. He had become rather fond of their times sitting so closely together in the small bathtub.
But his moment of freedom was scarce as he felt a pain surge through his chest, making him grip painfully at his robes. “Ow!”
“Got an Auror uniform on, yet still acting like a child now are we, Weasley?” Draco scoffed, irked by the use of the damn ferret nickname that the weasel never seemed to have moved past. “I’d like to commend Granger for having the patience to put up with you.”
Two fingers were going out and in steadily, and Draco didn’t feel any pain from it. It just felt… weird, like it wasn’t enough anymore.
“Good morning! I had to leave early to get some ingredients from a nearby village, please eat the breakfast I made for you and you don’t need to lock up before you leave. Have a good day!” The note said.
“By Merlin’s beard, I would Potter. But I can’t fucking seem to get away from you.” Draco drawled back.
Draco knew he had been the lucky one as his head got cushioned by Potter’s chest instead of going face first onto the floor. Potter on the other hand groaned as he reached a hand up to the back of his head rubbing the sore spot.
“I can’t believe it. I guess it’s true that I don’t particularly like this situation. But I’m obviously more hurt over not knowing anything about it!”
“Send me an owl whenever you have time, dear.” The continuous look of trepidation in her eyes only gave way for a foreboding feeling of what’s to come to someone who’s carrying the mark of a former death-eater.
Harry threw his head back and laughed loudly before leaning forwards again and kissing Draco hard on the lips. It merged into a gentler, soft kiss before Harry pulled away slightly. He put his forehead to Draco’s, close enough that Draco could feel his breath on his lips.
His hand was shaking slightly as he poured the potion into vials. Somehow, he was both overly happy about being able to conjure the Patronus, but on the other hand, the fact that the memory which managed to procure it was that of Potter was a bit worrisome. It just cemented how screwed Draco was. There was no way he would be able to get over the feelings he had for the guy, now was there?
He proceeded to place a hand on each of Draco’s thighs and lightly pushed them apart before opening the drawer that Draco had previously been blocking with his legs. Potter grabbed a utensil, looking pleased with himself for finding it and turning back to the stove without paying any attention to the look of shock on Draco’s face.
Potter had only managed to get up into a kneeling position as his movements stopped short when realising his own wand was pointed towards him. He looked dishevelled and slightly bloody from the earlier fight.
Draco put the cauldron back to its place quickly and only when Potter was out the door having looked more than pleased with himself, could Draco sit down and let a big sigh escape his lips.
“Okay, I get that it looks bad coming back here for another Burn-Healing Paste just two weeks after the last one.” He began. “However! It’s only because my quick thinking, heroic attitude and selflessness made me jump in front of people to save them.”
A blue wisp of something flew out of his wand and he blinked as he saw it take the shape of a doe in front of him. It took a few steps around the room before looking at him for a moment, rustling its head and then disappearing again.
It had kinda made Draco feel like Harry was finding his reactions funny… or maybe hilarious. He couldn’t know whether it was just fun to tease him because Harry knew about his feelings, or if Harry was actually properly trying to test out a relationship.
“It’s a misunderstanding! I’ll clear things up.” Draco said, feeling more heated than he ought to be.
“Say, how has it been to experience life from Harry’s point of view?” Hermione questioned with a bit more seriousness.
The crowd that was still left looked at them with a mix of emotions. Half of them seemed amazed over the kiss although not surprised about the two of them being together. They just pushed the ones who stood still in shock from not having any clue about any previous rumours along while muttering about it being old news.
Before he could think, a small and almost inaudible laugh escaped Draco’s mouth and Weasley was looking flabbergasted as he tried to make sense of what exactly what happening.
“It isn’t that simple. I think they both grew apart quite a bit during the war. They’re still friends, but they decided it was for the best not to try getting back together once more.” Hermione shrugged.
The cake did indeed look amazing and although Draco hated receiving stuff for free, mostly because it always meant a favour in return when it came to his work, he also felt it would be too much of a shame to turn down something looking this good.
“Yeah, let’s go.” Draco tried to mimic Potter’s nonchalant voice, but he was feeling uneasy himself.
Suddenly Draco was feeling tired. Both the anxiety from Potter spending time at St. Mungo’s and the dread of thinking he was witnessing some sort of apparition of the man he loved was simply too much for him. He couldn’t help the hint of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke.
“Stop looking so intently.” Draco said, reaching out to cover himself with his hands, feeling self-conscious. Sure, he wasn’t bad looking, but it didn’t keep him from getting embarrassed when Harry looked at him so openly.
“Anyway, I did check it out, but since the vial had no label on it, I had no idea what you were planning. I opened it and sniffed it to see if it was something I already knew what was. When I couldn’t determine what it was, I put it back. I was thinking of either confronting you about it the following day or ask Hermione if she knew what it might be.” Potter said as a matter of fact, making it seem like he had all the right in the world to look through someone else’s stuff.
“Truth be told, I’ve been meaning to ask you for a while now. The argument we had kinda ruined the first chance at it, and then the following events happened. I was kinda waiting to see if you would ask me.”
Harry slid his trousers down revealing quite an impressive one. Draco felt a shudder as he thought of that big, arched cock sliding into him.
“I see that being the Head Auror still hasn’t helped ease that stupidity of yours.” Draco felt himself snicker with more confidence that he should have. “As far as I can remember I used to be part of that little fan group.”
“Why not? If we’re both gonna live here, then you should have a say in things as well.” Then Harry turned a bit sheepish as he continued. “I’m also aware of the fact that you have good taste when it comes to… well… everything I guess.”
After a while of reading and eating the incredible pastry, Draco decided it was time to head back home and get back to the reality of work and little to no sleep.
“It’s not a bother at all. I used to teach the others in DA the Patronus, and I found it quite fun to teach it actually.” Potter smiled fondly reminiscing about the past.
He stepped out of the bathroom and the smell of pie instantly filled the room. It was amazing to even experience this type of homely feeling, Draco thought to himself.
“How noble of you.” Draco taunted lightly, glad that he was already so worked up from everything that Harry wouldn’t see the blush covering his face. It was indeed very noble of him and knowing that Harry waited for his consent was both reassuring and making it easier for Draco to properly say what he was honestly feeling. “I think I’m past the ‘taking it slow’ part already. I have been pining long enough as is. Although, I have to tell you… I haven’t done this before, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t at all nervous.”
Visiting the Weasley family had become a custom that even Draco had more or less become used to. He quite enjoyed the homemade meals that Molly Weasley made and the very comfy sweater with a ‘D’ on the front that he had received from Mrs. Weasley as a Christmas gift.
“Calm down!” Harry said, and to Draco’s surprise he stepped in front of him, shielding him with his own body.
Each minute felt like hours as Draco was sitting in his office making phone calls and doing live meetings.
“And about those Death Eaters. I’m not about to shush you out the door and turn a blind eye if that’s what you think. Catching them is part of my job, and even if it wasn’t I would still do everything in my power to make sure they’re sent to Azkaban and that you’re safe.” His furrowed gaze relaxed a bit and gave way to concerned eyes. “I’ll look into it and talk with the others about it as well. We’ll figure it out and we’ll get them. I promise you that.”
“Where is the fluxweed at?” Startled Draco hastily snatched one of the vials and showed it into his pocket before eyeing the person next to him.
“That’s not very convincing considering your state right now.” Potter’s eyes dropped down for a second, only to make his point clear. Draco knew without looking. He knew he was hard, probably had been since seeing Potter walk around in only a towel.
It had been so long since he had spent this much time with someone outside of his family. For once, his Christmas hadn’t been celebrated in a dimly lit living room in his villa with no one there to even wish a happy Christmas.
A small smile flickered across Harry’s face as he slowly guided his cock towards Draco’s hole. He hesitated for a second before pushing in. Draco gasped as he felt himself being filled up inch by inch. He could barely comprehend what was happening. The feeling of emotions consuming him as he locked eyes with Harry was insane. He felt both of them starting to connect as Harry continued pushing forward. He was big, and Draco felt himself being filled to the brim as he panted heavily with each push.
“You’re a pretty guy, I’m sure he won’t turn you down” Pansy said, knowing full well she had no idea whether or not that was true. But the thought of Draco passing up a chance at love was not an option.
Draco barely registered his mouth hanging open ever so slightly. His eyes were locked with Potter’s and despite how much he wanted to turn his head, the grip at the back of his hair was unyielding, leaving no room for struggle.
That Hermione Granger, always meddling in everyone else’s business, Draco thought. I’ll probably have to send her some flowers one of these days, he sighed.
Harry had been more than surprised when Draco had told him he would prefer Harry’s flat rather than his villa.
“Alright, let’s head into the back then” Harry smiled, and Draco followed him into the back of the bakery.
“Saint Potter!” Draco yelled, trying to sound angry but hearing his own panicky embarrassment push through his words. He jumped out of bed, fiercely heading for the bathroom when he felt the pain hit him, he grabbed the door to the bathroom to steady himself. “Ouch!”
“Cheers to that.” Hermione said, as she lifted her wine glass and Draco followed suit. The clinking vibrating through the glasses.
“Fuck.” Draco gasped as Harry leaned forward and engulfed Draco’s cock with his mouth. It was incredibly warm and smooth, and all Draco could do was to push his hips as far as he could manage.
The customer left, and just as Draco turned to slither back into the brewing room, the door jingled again.
“Er… Well…” Potter turned to Weasley and with a wild gesture between himself and Draco he said. “That’s Malfoy, I’m Harry. We’ve kinda…switched bodies, if that makes sense.”
“You’re just a good a seeker as Potter. Sure, his broom might be faster, but you have your wits that you can use.” Pansy shrugged as she grabbed a sandwich and put it down on Draco’s plate.
“Good morning.” A husky voice sent a shiver through Draco as Harry opened his eyes and smiled at him.
“The war is over, dimwit!” Weasley scowled as he checked on Potter. It did make the situation quite surreal as a display of friendship was supposedly shown between a Malfoy and a Weasley. “You alright, mate?” Weasley asked as he gave Potter a worried look.
“Is it okay to go further?” Harry asked, and Draco could only nod, as he didn’t think his voice would work properly at this point.
Somehow the words and tone it was said in, combined with one raised eyebrow made Draco pause, and the words in his head scramble into something unrecognizable.
Harry continued pushing in a third finger, which went in with ease at this point. Draco moaned as he felt him push back and forth inside of him.
“What the hell?!” Draco coughed as he got his head above water only to realise there was someone else occupying his personal space. It took a few seconds before he managed to figure out what was going on.
“Still-“ Draco tried to argue, but Potter stopped him. “Also, I want to support this shop as much as I can. It’s a real life-saver to have a place that allows me to avoid the whole wizarding world knowing what I do every second of the day.”
Harry had showed a second of surprise on his face from the persistence of Draco before letting himself be drawn into the blonde’s actions.
“Really? Then tell me… Have you ever thought of dating anyone else? No. Have you tried truly forgetting him? Also no. Could you drink Veritaserum and say you don’t want to get closer to him? Hell no!”
Draco noticed Potter stop his pacing for a moment, eyeing him with a frown. “What?” Draco grumbled, not knowing what was going through that head of his. “Nobody should want to put
“And you are sure of this? I mean, I love my flat and it’s convenient for me, but it wouldn’t stop me from moving here if you want to. This is far bigger than what I have to offer.” He said with a worried look on his face as they stood in the living room of his flat having managed to get all of the moving boxes inside before the rain started pouring, splashing against the windows.
He felt Potter’s eyes regard him for a second, it made Draco shift slightly as he felt uncomfortable under the scrutinized gaze. It was just typical that even when supposedly being in charge of the situation, Potter still held such a powerful aura around him that it did not feel like he was.
“You weren’t serious, right?” Draco continued as he stumbled after Potter down the stairs, only getting more laughter in response.
“I’m telling you; the Chudley Cannons are obviously the best.” Potter said in an amused tone as Draco scoffed.
The potion soon became the new hype and Draco and Pansy were doing their best to keep track of all the orders that came in.
He looked at Harry’s sleeping face, his dark lashes were stunningly long. It was just Draco’s luck that Potter had to grow up into such a fine specimen, making it impossible to rid himself of the feelings he harboured for the man.
Together with the rest of the eight years, Draco stood in-between his two friends waiting for the headmistress to speak.
Draco heads back to his lab, a hint of relief at the fact that Granger did interfere at that moment. He hadn’t been able to answer anything back to Potter as he was stunned by the sudden change in character. A small smile tugged at his lips though, as he came to realise that Potter was still Potter. It held a bit of satisfaction as he wasn’t the only one trying to keep a professional mask on.
Draco was in the middle of measuring and crushing ingredients while simultaneously trying to ignore Potter’s gaze which seemed to have tired of reading the endless potion notes and rather decided that it was much more interesting to follow every single move Draco made, when suddenly Potter decided to chirp in with some commentary.
“He tells his stories in a wildly different view.” Draco laughed a bit as well, remembering how proud Weasley had looked as he told the story himself.
“Are you okay?” Now there was a hint of worry in the eyes looking down at him. “Huh?” Draco hadn’t realised that he was staring. “Y-yeah! I’m fine, thank you!” He hurriedly gathered his stuff, said a quick goodbye before leaving the bakery.
“Err…” Draco took a moment, trying to think back on the day before. He remembered they had sat down having a drink to celebrate the hex being broken.
“It’s… I don’t know…I just don’t know if it’ll help.” Draco said, not wanting to completely dismiss the proposal since Harry was the one bringing it up.
“Yeah, I can definitely see myself wanting to buy that on a cold afternoon like this” Draco said agreeing with the choice of pastry. His reasons might also be a bit biased as he loves pie, but he had never tasted a pie that could compare to this one. The guy in front of him might actually be a genius, Draco thought.
“Hey!” Granger jumped at the sound of Draco and twirled around to face him. “Ready for class?” Draco almost felt a bit of pity as the nervousness was awfully visible in her words.
Draco might not always agree with the competence of some ministry officials as he had seen some shitty ones during the trial period, but if there was one thing he knew for certain; it was that no one could become Head Auror without being in possession of exceptional skills. Despite their old animosity, Draco knew better than to underestimate the saviour of the wizarding world. The nickname was there for a reason after all.
Once it was set to simmer, Draco offered Weasley some tea before sitting down beside him. It was strange, yes. But Draco couldn’t help but be affected by Pansy’s words. Perhaps it wasn’t the worst thing in the world if he tried getting along with a Weasley? The centuries of hatred between their family names seemed due to end now as things were far different from what they had been.
“Yeah… I suppose I can’t argue with that. I’ll just have to make sure I’m your knight in shining armour at all times then.”
Harry slowly started kissing Draco’s thighs and as he moved closer and closer to his cock, Draco was whimpering more and more.
The first time Draco started it. He had been more interested in THAT aspect of the relationship ever since their first intimate night together.
Just then Draco realised that he should’ve shut up about it. Potter looked at him with a raised eyebrow, obviously aware of the fact that Draco just outed himself on knowing what Potter’s favourites were.
“She was exaggerating.” Draco said, cursing Lovegood for telling Potter about his visit. Now he felt awkward as he worried whether she had also decided it would be appropriate to tell Potter about Draco holding his hand. “Weasley made it sound like you were near dying, so I thought I should at least grace you with my presence one final time.”
“How strange. Now I can’t seem to get you close enough.” Harry muttered, sighing as Draco hit a sensitive spot on his neck.
Going to work wasn’t stressing him out as much as it used to, mainly because he knew he could end the day by sitting in front of a fireplace and watching a movie, or talking to the person he loved.
Potter just shrugged slightly before settling back on the pillow, Draco could swear he saw a flash of pity in his eyes, but he was not about to start anything big right now. It was late and he was tired. Arguing with Potter could wait.
Draco was still not being overly touchy towards Harry but had started accepting Harry’s advances and seemed generally happier.
“Love… I’m already having a hard time trying to keep it together as is…” Harry shifted and brought Draco’s hand towards him. Draco was still a bit caught up at the word Harry used to address him. It made him feel his heartbeat do a double.
“Sure!” Both Potter and Ginny walked over to the small desk at the other side of the room, and it left Draco and Luna standing alone in front of the fireplace, waiting.
By Merlin if Draco had a difficult time not coming from the sheer feeling of Harry controlling him. All those times that he had dreamt about Harry making love to him, and now as it was happening it all just seemed too much. He was too easily turned on and even the slightest touch from Harry had him fighting to keep himself from becoming known for being a premature ejaculator.
He went over to the dining table where breakfast had already been placed. He looked at a note next to the food.
“I-It’s fine” Draco stammered a bit. He was more surprised by seeing Harry in only in a towel. Sure, you could kind of see through his clothes that Harry had to be somewhat well built, but seeing him almost completely naked, he was definitely full of muscles.
“Then how about you take some more time to properly think about it?” Amelia said, just as the bell rang and a customer entered the bakery, ending the conversation.
He tip-toed over to the desk after having made sure that no one was present in the room. He put the tracking device down on the desk and quickly wrote a little note saying he left it there since Potter was not in his office.
“If it’s about the other day, then I’m sorry if I overstepped. I don’t want us to end up not talking anymore because of it.” Potter frowned as he looked at him with a troubled expression.
“Well, obviously it has changed since before the war.” Draco said, looking down at the potion he was calmly stirring. “He did save my life as well, on multiple occasions, so I can’t say that I hate him or anything.” It felt weird to be talking about Potter like this, but he felt like Hermione had helped him enough to be truthful with her.
Harry continued kissing Draco’s neck and collarbone. His hands were roaming over Draco’s body, making him feel hot all over.
Harry fell next to Draco, both panting unsteadily. They stayed silent for a moment taking in what had just occurred and feeling the aftermath of what they had been doing.
“I won!” Draco was dragged out of his thoughts as Weasley was sat smiling broadly, the victory having brought up his mood considerably.
“Not yet sadly, but I’ll look into it as soon as possible.” Granger said, somehow looking guilty for not having more to offer, despite having made such progress in the short amount of time.
Harry’s heart began racing and he was very glad that the leg Draco had thrown over him lay across his thighs and not his hips. As gently as possible, he turned them both onto the side and carefully pulled his arm out from under Draco's head, praying to Merlin and Morgana that the blond was a heavy sleeper.
The third time Harry nears the edge he pleads with Draco — begs him — to let him come,  despite his voice coming out strangled and despite the effort it takes him to form words with the hand around his throat. Draco is slamming into him, fucking him hard and fast, and he releases the choke for a second, letting Harry’s head clear without slowing down, only to dig his finger tips into Harry’s pulse point seconds later, cutting the blood flow off completely. “Come for me love.” he orders and Harry tips over his cock untouched, and he is drowning in the lake of lust and haziness.
Draco closed his book and motioned for Pansy to keep her voice down, offering her the armchair across from him.
Draco found he didn’t mind walking around the town, even though there were some people bustling around in order to get their Christmas presents taken care of. None of the muggles knew him, none held a grudge against him, and none of them could curse him. For the first time in weeks, Draco didn’t mind strangers surrounding him.
Another shaky inhale and then all of a sudden a sob. And like a damn braking, Draco crumbled on the threshold of the door, the sobs shaking his body. A litany of “I’m sorry” escaped his lips. Trembling fingers clutched at blonde hair, pulling as if to tear it out.
3. While we’re on the topic of spell casting: There will be a compulsion spell cast on every player, which
“I’m glad you told me, although I wish you had told me earlier. Now I won’t promise any results, but I will see what I can do about getting you a new parole officer. I still need some more detail about what exactly happened, but I believe and trust you Draco.”
“If there is still time, get back to your knees, face each other again and start anew. I will end the randori with the commando
His run-ins with Potter usually happened sometime in the morning, that way Draco was fine through most of their classes and the side effects of the pull didn’t bother him too much in the evening. Since the eighth year consisted of so few students, they had nearly every class together. So on weekdays, Draco simply waited for their classes to start before easily arranging some sort of run-in with Potter.
He grabbed his stuff and headed towards his room, nodding to Blaise in passing, who lay on one of the sofas with his feet on Neville Longbottom’s lap.
Draco had to admit that he had wondered about the influences as well and he said so to the both of them. “I mean, for example: arithmancy. You understood the basics so much faster than I did, most of the muggle-raised kids in our class did.”
It took a few minutes before Draco’s brain had the capacity to think on the last paragraph. Taking the floo back to Hogwarts felt like cheating. The headmistress was right when she wrote that he couldn’t hide from society forever. His eyes fell to his new tattoo, still wrapped in some clear plastic and he thought of his new haircut, short and wavy and most importantly: turquoise. There was no reason for anyone to tell him that he looked like Lucius, because he didn’t. Not anymore.
Draco was glad that Potter didn’t try to touch him and only stood awkwardly at his side. He didn’t think he would have been able to cope if he did.
Malfoy turned to him, stopped dead in his tracks and apparated away. Harry vigilantly checked the windows and his surroundings for the rest of the day.
“Robes are rather impractical in the snow. They scrape the ground and by the time I even reach the hills it basically acts like a snow plow.” Silence stretched between them again, both men sipping their tea. The discomfort led Harry to blurt out the first thing in his head once again, “Why do you walk the hills anyways?”
“Draco! PLEASE!” Harry begs and Draco takes pity on him, letting his fingers dip into the crease of his arse. Eyes focussed on Harry’s face, Draco casts a wandless lubrication charm and pushes a finger into Harry’s tight hole. The resulting moan in combination with the way Harry throws his head back goes straight to Draco’s groin and he stifles a moan of his own. He opts to kiss Harry fiercely again instead, swallowing moans as he pushes his finger in deeper, slowly fucking Harry open.
Pansy acted as though she had to think about that for a moment. “Would you rather shave your head or not be able to speak for three weeks?”
“I was thinking, the bond will roughly be active until the end of August and that it would be highly irresponsible of me to leave you alone in that time for more than a day.”
Thank you all for all the love and feedback in the comments. It was a wonderful experience for my first (and probably not last) multichapter fic. <3
Harry asked a few more questions, which Draco deflected under the pretence that he couldn’t remember or that he was too tired to explain. The places where he and Potter connected were incredibly warm, chasing the residual cold away. When they reached his dorm Draco felt better than he had in weeks, the extended period of close contact working wonders on his unrequited bond. Harry asked him to please see Madame Pomfrey in the morning and bid him good night.
At that Draco leaned forward, his words surprisingly clear when he said, “That is true. But drunk off your arse isn’t exactly the best way to go about that, now is it?”
When Draco had nearly reached the door he turned  around again. “Professor? Why are you trying to help me?”
Potter had pulled himself off the floor too and settled himself onto the worn maroon couch furthest from the fireplace. A glance back showed Draco that the room had picked up on his fear of being trapped in it, as the door didn’t close after them. Instead there was the shimmer of wards passing over the opening which meant no one outside the room would hear or see them.
In the next DADA lesson they were basically left to practice on their own again, with Professor Wilkins offering help to people who needed it. So Harry cornered Malfoy.
Harry hadn’t made any note-worthy mistakes and Draco wasn’t sure if it was due to his broadened theoretical knowledge or if Harry wasn’t as bad at potions as he had formerly believed. They had spent the past fifty minutes mostly in concentrated silence, but now the potion needed to simmer for another twenty and there was little to concentrate on.
And with the simple reminder that Potter knew what he had endured at the manor, the adrenaline faded, and he couldn’t hold back the angry tears as they fell. Looking away from Potter he tried to furiously dry his eyes without much success.
“You don’t deserve to be punished, love. You deserve to be happy, you have suffered enough. We talked about it, remember?” Pansy urged gently, continuing at Draco’s small nod. “I agree with ‘Mione, you should tell McGonagall, it doesn’t have to be today or even tomorrow, but someday soon, yeah?”
“Yes, yes. We are all very happy about this. Next time please refrain from putting someone on the spot, if you know they aren’t completely ready to talk about something.” Draco grumbled, still a bit miffed at how Hermione had chosen to handle it.
“This is Draco, he’s a friend of mine and has agreed to help with today’s lesson. He is just as qualified to help you as I am, and will help me to keep an eye on all of you today, as we will start with choke holds.”
Slinging an arm around his best friend, Draco gave her an affectionate squeeze and leaned his head on her shoulder, “I know. I am trying, I promise.” The implied apology rang in each of his words.
When he left for lunch almost an hour later, he was in high spirits. The conversation with Gemma had been great and he had his first real therapy session scheduled for the following week. Talking to her had been easy enough, even when she asked emotionally charged questions. Within the short time of meeting her, Draco had managed to find enough trust to remove his hand from his wand and to come out to her. She in turn had opened up about the seven cats she was raising together with her girlfriend and had told him about her reasons for starting mind healing.
That was just enough time for a quick shower, and since most of the other 8th years were spending their free period outside the showers should be empty. Snatching his wand, toiletries, and towels he quickly rushed across the hall to the 8th years communal showers.
Normally Harry would have been delighted with the situation. He didn’t have to go to the Burrow, didn’t have to face Grimmauld Place, he didn’t have to deal with  the hero-worshipping there would have been if they had decided to stay in a wizarding place, and thanks to McGonagall, they were even allowed to use magic inside the cottages. It was ideal.
After a full five minutes of silence, McGongall took pity on him and prompted, “What is it that’s troubling you Mr. Malfoy?”
The small brown-haired girl - Julie? Julia? - speaks up. “Why is it so loud then? It just seems… dangerous.” She nearly drowns in her white gear. But Malcolm only laughs and slaps his hand on the floor.
Of course, Draco had apologized before and Potter knew all of his story from the trials, but other than that they had avoided talking about the war. And maybe Potter was right, maybe it was time for them to talk. And maybe it was time for Draco to face another one of his fears.
“Granger, could you tell me when you’ve reached sentence 3 of paragraph 4? I’d like your opinion on it.” he said cautiously, his heart beating violently in his chest.
A low chuckle escaped Draco. “How lucky that our friends keep each other busy enough to not notice us sneaking off. And if they do, we can just say that we are doing potions stuff.” Draco reached for Harry’s hand, entwining his fingers with his own.
When they got to the door of his flat, despite his nerves, Draco asked if Harry wanted to join him for some tea, Harry nodded and patiently waited for Draco to dig his keys out of his pockets and let them in.
“Just tell him you stubborn idiot!” Pansy said when he cornered her, “You’re friends now or whatever. He is too noble to willingly let you suffer now.” Draco still thought that the miscast bond would somehow incriminate him and simply replied, “No, it’s fine. I can go longer without him now. I think the bond is already wearing off.  The bond was faulty from the beginning anyway. One instead of two bond-mates and apparently only 6 months instead of 12. ” Which may not have been entirely true, but Pansy didn’t need to know that, she would only worry.
And then he had been marked, and as the pain had spread from his arm to encompass his whole body — his whole being — the only thing he could think was, ‘I don’t want this’. But by that point, it was too late.
“Do you happen to know where the kitchen is Mr. Malfoy?” she suddenly asked, gaze pondering. Confused with the change of topic Draco shook his head. The professor hummed and then muttered as if in deep thoughts. “It’s a fairly open secret amongst the Gryffindors. I will have to show them to you. Next Tuesday after lessons would be good.”
Wide eyed he stared at his supposedly best friend, barely registering the chuckle from Blaise. Potter would never want him to explain anything to him. Especially not potions. The git probably thought Draco would secretly try to poison him.
“Oh come on. You didn’t really think I’d let you off the hook just because I like you,” Draco teased, “No boyfriend of mine is failing Potions!”
Taking a few deep breaths, Pansy forced her fury down and instead focussed on Draco. “Is there any way I can help you?”
“You are very welcome, Mister Malfoy.” she said in her thick accent, “I can only reiterate that you are always welcome to join me in my office for a cup of tea. In fact I was about to put the kettle on.”
“So it did scar. I always wondered” Harry was vehemently looking at his shoes while he said that, voice low and shaky.
Instead of answering, Potter just sighed, reached for his drink and downed two shots in a row. “I really don’t want to get into this right now, so let’s just continue, yeah?” Another shot.
Harry takes a step back and looking Draco in the eye, brings his hands to the button of his jeans, toying with it, before moving to remove his shoes and socks, somehow making even that act impossibly sexy —  his eyes never once leaving Draco’s face.
