"Because you hate me," he stated as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. Harry's frown deepened.
"I said shut up."
"HERMIONE THIS IS MY LIFE! CAN YOU STAY OUT OF IT FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE!!!"
"Well, I'm off to breakfast." Blaise said, exiting the room before the Weasel could start blabbing about all his problems. He found Draco in his dorm with Theo, and the three left to have breakfast in the Great Hall.
They set off for the hospital wing, chatting briefly along the way. Harry fell asleep in Draco's arms before they were even halfway.
"Harry has PTSD." The blond looked over his shoulder at the now shaking boy. Not once did leaving cross his mind. Honestly, Draco didn't know why he didn't realize it sooner. Of course the poor boy had PTSD, look at the messed-up life this boy has. "He also has depression, which causes him to also lose his appetite most of the time." He took in the new information, pondering it for a few moments, causing an awkward silence. Harry was on edge the entire time. Something clicked in the back of the blond's mind, causing him to quickly look back at the smaller boy.
It just after lunch, and they had a free period before their next class. Draco sat down on the stairs, waiting for Harry. The two had decided to switch it up, and were going to the Room of Requirements tonight.
*TW-Mentions of self harm, but no actual harming...does that make sense?*
"My name's Harry Potter." This caused the blond to look up at him, and he stared at Harry for what felt like ages, before grabbing his picture and holding it up next to him. Sticking his tongue out a bit, the blond studied his drawing next to the boy, finally setting it down with a sigh.
"Come on Malfoy, let's go," Seamus said.
After much persuasion and flattery, the Fat Lady allowed the other Gryffindor in. He walked into the familiar common room, heads turning toward him. "Is Ginny here?" A small girl with chestnut colored hair, most likely a third year, nodded slowly.
"What happened?" Pansy asked, giving the bushy-haired girl a hug.
"What happened?"
"Don't worry about it," Harry panted. "I'm fine." Draco looked at him like he was crazy.
"Something actually came up, and we'll have to meet up later." At this Draco faced the bushy-haired girl.
The hoodie was spread out before the three on Draco's bed while they just stood there staring at it.
"Fine, now stop interrupting me. As I was say-"
"She's always frightening." Draco nodded in agreement, and the two went back to their lunch.
"What, I can't visit my aunt?" Harry opened his mouth, before closing it again. He'd forgotten they were related, which is strange, because Andromeda really did look a lot like Narcissa. Though, Harry would definitely say she looked the most like Bellatrix. Once, Andromeda had woken Harry from one of his nightmares while he was staying over, and he'd mistaken her for Bellatrix at first, and may or may not have hexed her. Nothing fatal, of course, and he was quickly forgiven, though he still felt guilty about it, even now.
"YOU SORRY EXCUSE FOR A HUMAN BEING!"
"Why? And I'm not really allowed to say anyway, and I won't go against my word," she said, and paused, before adding, "unless you give my good reason." The boys beamed at her.
"Where's Harry?" Draco asked in a hoarse voice, ignoring the glass in his hand.
He heard a stick or something break behind him, and he jumped. "Sorry!" Someone said quickly. "I didn't think anyone would be here." Harry turned around and saw Malfoy standing there, looking quite red in the face.
Mr. Padfoot agrees with Mr. Prongs.
"You have classes."
----------------------------------
Professor Sprout started clapping, and so did Ron, Blaise, Draco, Neville, Dean, Seamus, and a few other teachers. Little by little, the students joined in, until nearly the entire hall was applauding and cheering. Some gave them glares, but that was to be expected. The four girls blushed, and Ginny hopped down, and walked over to the Ravenclaw table to sit with Luna. Pansy and Hermione got down too, and sat next to Draco and Blaise.
"What did they tell you?" Madame Pomfrey backed away, hands up. "They had no right, no right to do that!" he screamed, shooting a spell at a flower vase, causing it to fall and shatter on the ground.
"That's awfully sweet of you," Lily said with a smile, trying to prevent things from getting out of hand. Why couldn't the Potter and Malfoys just get along?
He scooted closer, so that their arms and legs were touching. The breathing stopped, and Draco could feel Harry tense up even more, before relaxing slowly and breathing again, this time much more evenly.
"Malfoy, you take that cloak off right now!" He did, and then she was hugging him. "Thank you," she whispered, confusing him.
"I hate my last name in general." Pansy nodded, taking in this new information. Draco should know this if he was going to make the famous Gryffindor fall for him. Soulmates be damned, Draco wanted Harry Potter. Of course, this wasn't the reason Pansy had befriended Harry, she genuinely meant what she said.
"Why wouldn't I?"
"Granger, how hard is it to keep one bloody secret?! Merlin, you Gryffindors have no morals."
After a few moments of thought, Harry concluded that he was supposed to retrieve one of them and that none of the other champions had made it yet, seeing as there were still four. Harry swam up to the hostages. He recognized Hermione, Cho, and Malfoy, but there was another girl, who Harry deemed to be Fleur's sister. The sliver, glistening hair made it fairly obvious.
"Great, now that that's all been settled, let's have some fun with this. Draco, who do you like more, me or Blaise?"
"Why would you get disowned?"
---------------------------------
"Wait, Harry asked you? Why?" Hermione knew why she had, but why had Harry?
Hermione trudged back to the castle along with the others, willing herself not to cry. She'd never truly lost someone this close to her before, and it was horrible. Honestly, she didn't know how Harry did it all of the time.
"I'm just going to show him my room if that's alright with you mother." She nodded, and Draco grabbed Harry's trembling hand and dragged him inside. Harry gulped, looking at the familiar setting. Draco led him through the house, and Harry thought he heard a faint scream. His head had snapped up from where he'd been staring at the ground in seconds. His eyes widened when he saw Ron looking at him with wild eyes, before screaming Hermione's name repeatedly. He stumbled backwards, the warmth of Draco's hand leaving him.
"Uhhh...good?"
"It's not even that big of a deal, you're just turning it in to one," Harry said, finally looking up, but not at Draco.
"You are not a freak. You never were," Hermione whispered in his ear as she embraced him. Ron joined the hug, and they stayed like that for a few more minutes. In his friends arms, Harry didn't feel like as much of a freak. But there was still that small part inside him, that said that he was. He didn't deserve his friends. He didn't deserve to eat. He didn't even deserve to live. He was supposed to be dead right now. He was supposed to be free.
When Harry's head broke the surface, he gasped for a breath, taking in all the air he could, and coughing slightly. Malfoy opened his eyes, spitting out some water, then turned to glare at Harry.
"Great. Professor Potter, would you mind helping take dinner out to the dining room?" Harry rolled his eyes, but helped anyway. When they had finished with that, the pair went into the living room, finding Ginny and Luna there as well.
"You don't have to hate each other. Hermione and I are friends, and Draco and Potter aren't fighting, though they don't really talk to each other much. Besides, it would make the rest of the year a lot easier if you and your roommate weren't at each other's throats constantly."
"Harry Potter," the boy responded without looking up, and Harry looked at him oddly before turning to Narcissa for help. She gave him an encouraging shove forward, though the small child was a bit creeped out that this boy was already drawing pictures of him when they hadn't even met yet. There must be another Harry Potter, it was the only thing that made sense.
------------------------------
"I don't know, I guess one day I just...knew."
"You've been staring at Malfoy for the past three minutes," Dean answered, holding back a laugh by the looks of it.
"Need something, Malfoy?" Harry asked. Draco couldn't seem to find his voice. He was far too nervous, that wouldn't do. He cleared his throat, and stood just a bit straighter than before.
"I freed him Draco, or rather tricked your father into doing it. Didn't he ever tell you? Besides, Dobby works in the Hogwarts kitchens, so I see him all the time. He even gave me socks for Christmas last year," Harry laughed, throwing his head back. Draco blinked at him.
"Because I'm, well I don't know what I am actually, but I like Luna. So Harry and I had a mutual agreement to break up."
"Sweet," she said. He gave a small smile back, but the smile was more sad than anything. The two walked out of Teddy's room, and Andromeda led Harry to the couch. "Draco told me everything...just, take it easy, alright? Your best mate just passed away, the world doesn't expect you to be okay right away."
They reached the doors far too fast for Hermione's liking, and she dreaded actually stepping in. Most would be at lunch now, and she didn't really want to make a scene and announce it to the whole school. So they didn't go to the Great Hall. Instead they went to the hospital wing, though they knew nothing could be done.
*TW- very brief mention of abuse*
"That we are. How are you and Ginny doing?" Dean responded, grinning at Seamus before turning back to Harry.
"Funny, Harry asked me the same thing. Anyway, I don't know how I knew."
"You alright Harry?" Neville asked.
"Mate, you know I was kidding before, right? It's fine that he's your soulmate." Harry nodded. Ron's approval wasn't really his biggest concern right now, it was his own. Draco Malfoy, the boy who had relentlessly bullied him and his friends for years, was his soulmate. He grimaced, and grabbed his goblet of pumpkin juice, taking a sip of it. He looked over to where the blond was, and when their eyes accidentally met, he may or may not have choked on his juice.
Harry and Neville made it to their dorm, before they burst out laughing. They laughed until they got stomach cramps and they had tears in their eyes. When they had finally stopped, Harry and Neville checked out the room.
"Like hell you will, I'll be doing the question-asking!" Harry looked over to Draco, who actually looked a bit scared. Pansy didn't want to deal with all this drama, so she conjured two little cups, scooping small amounts of the potion into them, and holding them out to the boys.
"Hey," Blaise replied.
"Hello Andromeda, how are you?"
And after everything he did, they want him to go back? Harry couldn't believe it. Hadn't they all personally watched him kill the Dark Lord? Hadn't they seen what he's done? Even before the war, he was a horrible person. Impulsive, angry, stubborn. And yet, he was happy. And that was what was so sick. How he walked around, laughing and smiling, not even caring about all the evil in the world. He was happy. Now...
"You haven't been out of the house in a week! Merlin Harry, how are you not going insane," Pansy sighed, giving him a weird look. Harry muttered something under his breath, folding his arms and pouting like a child.
"Maybe I just didn't want to walk to class alone," he stated, running a hand through the mop on his head. Pansy scratched the tip of her nose, and the two walked in a dreadful silence the rest of the way, which, thankfully, wasn't very far.
Dean and Seamus were going to stop by the hospital wing to say hello to Madame Pomfrey, who they both agreed wasn't appreciated enough. They stopped at the door, noticing laughs and voices coming from inside. They peeked open the door to see Harry sitting next to Malfoy in a hospital bed, with Hermione in a chair across from them. The three were laughing, and Harry and Hermione looked quite happy to be with their old enemy, Draco Malfoy. Dean and Seamus shared a devilish look, and quickly left to their room to discuss the new information, Madame Pomfrey forgotten.
"Alright, Zabambi."
Ron chuckled lightly. "Can you imagine Harry's face right now if he were to wake up surrounded by the three people he'd want to see least of all." Draco snorted. "We should probably leave before he wakes up and murders us all." Hermione hesitated, before standing up.
"Well Weasley, of course."
"Mr. Malfoy, I think that's enough. You as well, Mr. Nott," Madame Pomfrey glared at both boys. They both shut up, but there were daggers coming out of both of their eyes. Harry wanted out of the hospital wing, right then and there. It was uncomfortable, the amount of hateful tension in the room.
"Due to these unusual circumstances, we have had to make a few adjustments. The eighth years will have their own dorm, and take classes together. However, you are still in your separate houses, so house points can still be taken and given. If you would follow me, I can show you to your dorm, and we'll go from there."
"N-no, it's not like that. You see, Ron...he's..." Her voice was unsteady, and she just couldn't say it. She motioned for them to go in as she sank to her knees. She hated how weak and vulnerable she looked. When Molly opened the door and saw Ron, she immediately rushed over to him, the rest following. Pansy looked up from where she was seated with Blaise, and her eyes locked on Hermione. She stood up and walked over to her, helping her up. Hermione took shaky steps into the room, her eyes never leaving Ron's body. He was pale now, very pale. As she reached his bed, she lightly held his hand in hers. His fingers were cold and stiff.
When Harry awoke, Draco was gone, but a sticky note had been placed on his forehead. He took it off, chuckling.
"So, is it a yes or a no?"
"Because she's dating Pansy." Harry's mouth dropped open, though he wasn't jealous anymore. In fact, he felt a whole lot better knowing she didn't like Draco.
Harry closed his eyes, taking deep breaths. "I'm bi." He opened one eye to see their reactions. Hermione's eyes were sparkling with delight, and Ron had gone back to his Charms assignment. He sighed in relief, and opened his other eye.
Pansy rarely saw Draco anymore. She spent her time comforting Blaise and Hermione, for her time for mourning was gone. She hadn't spoken to Ron very much, but she had considered him a friend. He'd been great about her getting together with Hermione, and even found someone else for himself.
"For my Master to drink," she said, handing it to him. His grin widened.
Harry received gifts, admired a lovely dinner, and an even better cake. Neville and Luna seemed to be enjoying themselves. Harry was glad. But when they finally left, Harry immediately relaxed. He was exhausted, and all he wanted to do was lie down. Not sleep though, just lie down.
"Shut up."
"Fine, it's Draco. Now can we start talking about you and Blaise again?" Knowing not to push it further, Ron  nodded. "So, what happened?"
+ + +
"Thank you, Draco," Andromeda said. The blond nodded in response, still watching Harry.
"Oh, would you look at the time? Class will be starting shortly, and I'm afraid I have to get to Potions before Slughorn has a fit. See you!" Pansy stood up, smoothed her robes out, and walked away. Harry scrambled up from the floor, running after her.
"Right, sorry mate." Harry was released from the hug when Ginny came running up to him.
"Mr. Potter, if I may-"
"I-I just got c-caught up in the moment, s-s-sorry." He mentally cursed himself for his voice being so shaky.
"Wait, why do you need a fake boyfriend?" Draco scowled.
Mr. Padfoot says Harry is always up to something, and he wonders what he's doing now. Surely he knows the password.
Harry got out of bed, showered, changed, and tried to fix his hair, but it was no use. It stuck up everywhere, especially in the back. He sighed, and started packing his trunk. It was supposed to be done yesterday, but Harry had been to exhausted to pack anything. Although, he didn't actually fall asleep until about 4 a.m.
"What are you doing? Going to hex him while he's already unconscious?"
"Done snogging then?" he asked, turning to face the two. They blushed and looked at Harry.
"First of all, you can't tell me that silence wasn't brutally awkward. And second, seeing as I'm going to be your boyfriend for the next little while, we should probably get to know each other a bit  better."
-Theodore Nott
"Oh come on, you've been giving me unnecessary attitude the whole time we've been talking, and you're obviously upset about something."
"Wait," he said suddenly, "we aren't married yet!" And with that, Draco leaned forward and pressed his lips against Harry's, because that's what toddlers thought kissing was, lips touching one another.
"You most definitely are not! We've got plenty of food, and everyone's waiting, so you two better be out in the garden in five minutes, or I will drag you by the ear myself." She turned, and walked inside.
"I have no idea what your talking about!"
"Wasn't he still taking orders from us in second year?"
"It will make Harry Potter breathe underwater, sir!" Hesitantly, Harry took the gillyweed and put it in his pocket.
Malfoy looked at him like he was insane. "Do you really want me to answer that? Do you not remember our first six years of Hogwarts? Do you not remember right now?"
Luckily, it was only about five minutes before Ron found Harry there, covered in a scary amount of blood. He hastily picked up the unconscious boy, and made his way to the hospital wing.
The door opened and closed, but Ron had hardly noticed. He couldn't get it out of his head. he missed him, he missed him loads. The jokes, the pranks, the smiles. he missed anything and everything about him. But he had left, and he wasn't coming back. Fred was gone.
-----------------------------
"Um, yeah. Sure, let's go." He turned around, walking back to the door, stumbling over a leg of the coffee table. Draco flushed, embarrassed, and Harry gave a small, amused smile.
"Back already, Malfoy?" Ginny asked, raising an eyebrow. Everyone else dropped their conversation to look at him, though Luna seemed to be looking next to him rather than at him.
"Wait, why?" Harry grabbed it from where it was carefully hidden underneath a pile of junk.
And, now, his final year. One more year, and then who knows what. Harry had no idea what he was going to do after this.
A quieter one whispered-yelled, "Seamus, be quiet!"
Ron, on the other hand, didn't even give a second thought about Malfoy, he was worried sick for Harry. He decided to skip breakfast and go visit him in the hospital wing, and at least try to talk to him.
The sorting began. Harry remembered his sorting; he had almost been put in Slytherin. He watched as child after child got sorted. When the sorting ended, Professor McGonagall stood up. She was the new headmaster.
"Oh," was all Ron said before turning around, and walking to the Great Hall, hoping Harry would be there. On the way, he saw Malfoy, and called out. Malfoy turned around as Ron jogged toward him.
"Yes."
"Ex-death eater," Hermione said. "And it's obvious you've changed."
Harry slipped out of the Gryffindor common room and began the far-too-long journey to the Slytherin dorms, where he figured Malfoy would be. The halls were nearly empty, and they were far too quiet for Harry's liking. It wasn't after curfew, but he still felt as though he had to sneak around to avoid being caught.
"Well, it was earlier that day that I found this spell that could...calm me, in a way. A spell to make me happier, sort of. I'm not really explaining it right, but it doesn't really matter. The point is, that's why I let Luna in, and why I left my room. I've been using it ever since, only taking it off at night."
"Hey beautiful," Pansy smirked, loving the blush that found it's way to her girlfriends cheeks. "Ready to go?"
"We're friends now. I'm just helping him work out a few problems, see you in class, yeah?"
The train ride was quite uncomfortable for the four. About halfway through, Hermione gave in, wanting to breaking the troublesome silence. She cast a quick muffliato charm around the trio.
Hermione walked to the Great Hall, accompanied by Ginny and Luna, who were deep in conversation. Hermione payed them no attention, as she was thinking of the previous night's events. It was all so strange. Draco finding him, the panic in his voice when he ran into the hospital. She had thought there were tears in her eyes, but was unsure. Then the hand-holding, the worry, the fact that he knew about the fight. And he stayed, when even she didn't.
"You can borrow one of mine. Now hurry and clean this up; it looks likes a hurricane happened in here." And with that, Hermione left, ignoring Harry's persistent whining behind her.
"Seriously Weasley? Quit leaving your dirty clothes all over the floor! It's disgusting, really. At least keep your mess on your side of the room."
" Oh," he replied. "Well, you surprised me. Can I go back to sleep now?"
"He's no family of mine and you know it. Now get the fuck out of my sight, Death Eater."
"Pleased to meet you Scarhead," the blond said, taking his hand. "I'm ferret."
"You're gay?" Ron inquired, glancing at Harry, expecting him to move away, so they at least weren't touching, but he didn't do anything.
"Harry! Thank Merlin you're here, the food was starting to get cold." The Gryffindor flinched when Mrs. Weasley gave him a giant hug, and gave Draco a pleading look. The blond only chuckled, even more when Harry scowled at him playfully.
"No Harry, it's not your fault. Not everything is, you know." Harry nodded, but didn't actually believe what she'd said. Draco stood there awkwardly, shuffling his feet a bit. He knew that Harry and Hermione making up meant they wouldn't be spending as much time together, but he tried not to let that bother him. He was glad the two were friends again, Harry was bound to be happier now...right?
Harry wanted them to be a bit more. Andromeda raised an eyebrow, and Harry looked away.
"Maybe you should get some sleep," Draco said tentatively.
"What do you mean?"
"What?"
Pansy turned to her friends. "You guys better be nice, and not just to Hermione. Weasley and Potter too." Draco and Hermione held in knowing laughs, and Blaise's cheeks heated a bit, though not enough to be noticeable.
"That's fine," she replied, and she pulled him into a long, deep kiss. Ron cleared his throat. Harry and Ginny pulled away after that. Harry couldn't help but think the kiss felt a bit...different.
"Yes, it was."
"We know, but he needs to stay somewhere while word gets out. Can we just notify the staff, family, and close friends first. I don't think we need the whole school talking about it right now," Pansy said, a pleading look in her eyes. Madame Pomfrey nodded, and led him over to a hospital bed, which coincidentally happened to be the same one he'd occupied near the end of third year. Hermione tried not to think about it.
Pansy enveloped her in a hug. In her ear, she whispered, "Of course. I'd never want anyone else."
"You may not, Miss Weasley. This is between my son and me, you may be excused." Ginny nodded and left the room, leaving father and son alone.
"Thought so. So, what do you want to do?"
"But-"
was that I like you so much. Ha ha..." He kept rambling, and it was actually quite adorable, in Harry's opinion.
"I didn't know you had a boyfriend," the boy replied.
Andromeda and his mother walked into the room, cups of tea in hand, smiles on their faces. Their eyes fell on Harry, then Draco and Teddy.
Dinner with everyone was better than Harry had expected. For once, it seemed, no one had to fake any smiles or laughs. Though it wouldn't last, they had that moment to be happy.
"I mean that I don't like girls, and that I fancy Harry bloody Potter."
Blaise shrugged. "What do you need help with?" Pansy looked at him, dumbfounded.
"I guess you want an explanation then," he said, turning to Pansy.
"Hold on...it's Christmas! Merlin, how could I forget," he said, throwing the covers off him. Draco scrunched up his nose.
"Is that a problem?"
"Right, well, I'll be on my way then," Draco said, turning around.
"I just...I don't know why I'm here actually," he muttered, rocking back and forth on his feet. Harry saw Dumbledore wink at him before returning to his conversation with Bagman, and he blushed despite himself.
"Wow, I hadn't realized the two of you were so close," he said as they began walking through Draco's maze of a house to get to the dining room.
"I'm going to help with dinner. You can let the others in when they arrive." The two nodded, and Harry went into the kitchen, finding Draco tossing a salad. He stopped and looked up when Harry walked in.
"Don't ask me," the blond muttered. Ron looked to Harry, who shrugged, picking at the seat a bit. Ron wasn't exactly known for being able to keep a secret, and even if he was, Harry wouldn't tell him he was gay as well. There was the looming fear that word could somehow get out to his father, and Harry shivered at the mere thought of what would happen.
"Just get out," he whispered. Hermione scowled and stormed out, slamming the door behind her. Tears of anger and frustration prickled her eyes as she walked all the way to her room. She tried not to cry, she really did, but once to door to her room closed, she couldn't help the tears from falling. She slid down the door, leaning against it and sobbing. Pansy looked up from the book she was reading on the couch, and her face filled with worry. She shut the book, and ran over to Hermione, wrapping her arms around the crying girl before her.
----------------------------------
"But-"
"McGonagall. She wants to see me, not sure what for."
"Why are you trying to set us up anyway? I'm a death eater, and he's the bloody savior, it would never work out."
"Draco Malfoy you sit back down this instant. At least here the plan before you decide whether or not to help."
"Voldemort has killed my entire family, or have you forgotten? When are you going to stop being such a coward and just suck it up, Draco?"
Hermione watched as Harry ran out, still wrapped in Pansy's arms. It was torture, every minute that passed by. Ron was dead, Harry was probably going to do something stupid, and Blaise hadn't moved an inch. Not to mention the unconscious body on the ground that still needed to be dealt with. So, that being said, Hermione removed herself from Pansy's arms, and walked over to the blond. After a few spells, his eyes slowly opened. She carefully sat him up, conjuring a glass of water and handing it to him.
"I don't know, to be honest. After I do it I only hate myself more for giving in, for letting myself succumb to the self-pity and hate."
"But I saw him just this morning, and he didn't seem ill or-"
"What does that even mean?"
"I fancy you as well." His voice came out a bit shaky, which he hated.
"Well, Harry and Hermione showed me these things muggles watch, called movies. One of the muggles movies has this little baby deer named Bambi. I could show you if you want."
"What is it?"
Harry was to busy throwing a hex at Umbridge to notice it. But Ron did, he saw it.
"You should tell people, you know. Maybe they'd stop throwing themselves at you constantly," Harry said as he sat on his bed. Neville put a bookmark in his book, and set it down.
"Great! Start packing! Ron will be ecstatic! He was hoping you'd say yes, but with how you've been since..." her voice trailed off, and she quickly tried to change the subject. Hermione knew Harry hated any mention of the war, and she understood. The war hit them all hard, just some more than others. "Anyway, just to pack your things and we'll head down to the Weasley's! " Hermione have a small squeal of delight. The Weasley's? Harry was quite confused, but then he, surprisingly, put two and two together. Hermione must have asked if he wanted to stay at the Weasley's.
"Perfect. I love you, Draco."
Harry lunged into the water and sighed in content when he could breathe again. The water didn't feel as cold as before, which Harry was unquestionably grateful for. He started swimming and noticed he was faster than he ought to be. Looking down at his feet, Harry noticed he had flippers as well. He tested them out a bit, before continuing with his task, which he only had about fifty-five minutes to complete. Harry wondered how long it would take since he was still unsure of what exactly he was supposed to be looking for.
Harry ran and ran, until he got to Myrtle's bathroom. He collapsed on the floor, shaking and crying. He couldn't believe he'd done that. He was a freak. He let his anger block out everything else.
." Draco stared at him for a long time, at least, for Harry it felt like a long time. In reality, only a few moments passed.
"And how did Harry feel about you being together?" Hermione looked confused at their random questions, before a look of shock replaced it.
"Because it's Potter's," Draco replied. Pansy snorted in response.
"Homophobic? No," Seamus said, looking amused. Now that he looked around the room, so did Dean and Hermione.
"I see. And, if I'm not mistaken, your fiancè works here as well?" Harry nodded, confused as to where this was going.
"Who said I was lying?"
"And why would I do that?" he asked, amused.
"Well I've been looking for since he ran out of the bloody hospital."
Harry had not, however, spoken at Lucius's trial. He had been nothing but cruel, Azkaban seemed the right place for him. He felt bad, sometimes, but Lucius had never shown a sign of redemption, or mercy. He was just plain evil. An evil coward.
After Christmas dinner, when Harry was packing up to go stay with Sirius for the rest of his holiday, Draco walked into his room. Harry's eyes were drawn to his hair, which was completely gel free and looked quite fluffy to be honest.
"Darling, he's sleeping, and I'd hate to wake him."
Harry could feel his eyes start to water again, though he hated crying in front of people. He wished Draco had gone with the others, but it was also kinda nice having him here. He sat against the edge of the bed, bringing his knees up and closing his eyes. Draco did the same, sitting right next to the boy, because right now, just being in each other's presence was enough.
"Alright," Draco responded hesitantly, not sure what exactly the point was.
"Wait, Harry! You haven't eaten anything yet!"
Christmas morning was quite an experience. Draco woke first, then called for his house-elf. "Pretzel!"
"Ronald! It's not our place to tell him."
"Potter," Malfoy said, but Harry ignored him. He didn't want to deal with him and his taunts right now. But the slimy ferret just kept repeating his name, until Harry whirled around in a very Snape-like manner.
Harry had been somewhat avoiding Draco all day, which was extremely difficult, seeing as all the eighth years had most classes together. Draco noticed, but didn't push it. He figured Harry needed some space for a day or two.
"Your turn, Goldie. Who's your horrible soulmate that you apparently hate?" Pansy slowed her pace as she spoke, a realization coming to her head, both a blessing and a curse. She prayed she was wrong.
"Oh my god, Harry? I thought I'd never see you again," Draco sighed, grinning. Harry grinned back and scooted over so the blond could join them. Ron was looking between the two, confused, causing Harry to chuckle softly.
Hermione, Dean, and Seamus were suddenly spending quite a lot more time together. Harry thought it to be suspicious, but Ron rolled his eyes.
The tour took about an hour, though it didn't feel that long to the boys. They were enjoying their time together. The train ride had caused them to become quite close friends. After Harry realized that Draco wasn't a  rude and snobbish prat, and Draco realized Harry wasn't an attention-seeking git, it was easy to pretend they were dating.
"Oh come on Malfoy, we're his family. And you're there," Ginny said, peering behind Draco's shoulder for a glimpse of the boy.
"I didn't have a choice, Harry. He's going to kill my entire family, please, listen to me," Draco pleaded, tears wetting his soft cheeks. "I can't do this without you."
"You hesitated," she replied in a sing-song voice, grinning even wider. This poor boy had obviously fallen for the blond Slytherin and was still in denial.
"No. Will you just...hold me?" Harry really didn't care how pathetic he sounded. Draco nodded, and moved Harry onto his lap, wrapping his arms around his waist. They stayed like that for a little while, before Harry broke the silence. "I've got a present. For you, I mean." He reached into his pocket and grabbed his wand, using it to enlarge the present that he'd shrunk before he came.
The train pulled to a stop at the station in Hogsmeade, the carriages waiting to take then to the school. Harry remembered one of his most recent visits here, that happened just hours before the Battle of Hogwarts.
With a final wave goodbye, Lily and James apparated away from the daycare, already missing their child.
Figuring it could only be Harry, he followed the trail. He didn't have to walk long, maybe a minute or two, before the dork with the glasses came into view, his wand in his hand. His eyes were red and puffy, and his cheeks were stained from the tears. Draco watched curiously from a distance as Harry raised the wand. Then he noticed that the wand was facing the wrong direction, the tip pointing towards Harry. Draco frowned, about to point it out to him, when Harry started saying a spell.
"Well, Ronald thinks Harry's got a secret girlfriend now. I mean honestly, I think I would be able to tell if my bro-best friend had a girlfriend."
"From murdering bloody Theodore Nott!"
"What?"
"Great, now spill."
"Probably with his secret girlfriend. Don't worry Neville, he's fine."
"We're still friends, right?"
"It's the only one you've got."
No one could believe it. Ron, who could always put a smile on your face, who would shove food into his mouth like he would never eat again, was dead. Harry couldn't take it anymore. He bolted out of the room before anyone could stop him, just wanting to escape it all. But no matter what he did, all he could see was that body, lying on the ground...suddenly he just broke down, right there in the passageway. His knees buckled, and he cried helplessly on the floor, because his best mate, his brother, the first friend he'd ever had, was gone.
Hermione thought and thought, searching for some conclusion to the strange night. She came to multiple ends, none making much sense. First, she had thought they had been dueling, and something had happened triggering the attack. But she dismissed the thought. They had hardly spoken to each other all year, let alone break out in a fight.
He knocked on the door repeatedly. "Harry James Potter, you open that door this instant." The door opened, revealing a sleep-deprived Harry who was halfway through brushing his teeth. Draco ignored this. "Pull up your sleeve," he demanded. Harry pulled it up cautiously, not wanting to touch the tender skin. Draco studied the wrist, noticing nothing new, and he gave a satisfied nod. "Promise me you won't ever do that -he pointed to Harry's wrist- ever again."
"Ah, so that's why he keeps disappearing. He's meeting with someone...but who?" Dean asked.
"Good, now you need to test it to see if it works. Two of you will take just enough for it to last a few minutes, and the other one will ask three questions each. If something goes wrong, just call me over."
"So...his looks. You didn't mention one single thing about his personality, just his physical features."
"Dean, your a genius! Alright, common room first." Dean grabbed a piece of parchment, and the two left for the common room. They wrote down everyone who was there. Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, and Theodore Nott were studying at one of the tables. Two Hufflepuff eighth years were on the couch, and a Ravenclaw was walking to their dorm room.
Lily Potter was dead, and Harry was alone in this world. He vaguely remembered being held and crying himself to sleep that night, a soft hum present against his ear.
"Hey, Gryffindork, listen. to. me."
"Oh, I never saw what they looked like."
"Nah, my brother's bi. Not exactly the same, but gay people are cool. Sometimes I wish I was gay...is that normal?"
"Hello. Yous is a friend of Master Draco?" Harry nodded.
"Well, I've considered an auror, but I think I'd also like being a teacher at Hogwarts." Lucius nodded.
-----------------------------
"Don't know, huh?" Draco teased once they'd broke apart.
"How did you know?"
"Well, I didn't know until my mum said we were coming for a quick visit. This is the first time I've met Andromeda, but she seems nice." Harry nodded, before standing up, and motioning for Draco to follow him. They walk down the hall to Teddy's room, and Harry opens the door softly, in case the boy was still sleeping.
Pansy had liked Hermione since their sixth year. She had never told anyone this, not even Draco. Although, he did know she was lesbian.
"Well, that was odd." Pansy said, puzzling over his strange reaction. Hermione looked at her, studying her face. But all she saw was perplexity. Funny, she could have sworn Pansy had had something to do with Harry's strange departure.
"Yeah, I know. But if you two keep fighting any longer, she probably won't be."
"Yes, but I want to hear the words. I want to hear you say them."
"Should we wake him?" Draco asked. A small groan escaped the sleeping boy, his face contorting. It was silent again, before Harry started whimpering and mumbling in his sleep.
"Umm...okay? Good luck with...whatever's happening. I'm just going to go before this conversation becomes any more awkward."
"HARRY!" Draco ran forward, snatching Harry's wand out of his hands, which Draco noticed were shaking. He grabbed the boy's hand, which were drenched in a cold sweat, though he didn't care.
"You didn't answer my question. What are you doing here?"
"Ron, I think you've gone insane. Malfoy and Harry hugging, seriously?!" Neville said. Dean and Seamus shared a look.
"How long was I out?"
They sat down in the Great Hall, Harry next to Neville, and Ron and Hermione across from them. Ginny was on Harry's other side. They were still friends, after all.
"Sorry," the blond said. "Didn't see you. Merlin Potter, are you ok?" He reached out his hand for the other to take. Harry was just about to do so, when a door opened. He mouthed a quick 'sorry' before yelling, "Watch where your going, Potter."
"Why can't I stay with you and daddy?" Harry asked, his voice just above a whisper.
Turning the broomstick around, he ignored Ron's cries and flew towards the little ferret, wincing every time he nearly fell. Extending his hand for Draco to grasp, Harry leaned forward slightly, coughing when he engulfed a large whiff of smoke.
man," Draco corrected. Harry rolled his eyes, and went to start on the head. When he was finished, Harry admired his work proudly. Draco looked up, and stared at it, before saying, "That looks dreadful, the head's not even on straight."
"I was abused," he whispered, sighing when the headache stopped, lingering for just a few seconds. He shut his eyes in content, causing the salty tears to fall from his eyes. And then he could feel the potion wearing off, and he cursed himself, knowing he could have just held out a little longer.
"Fine," he sighed, sitting back down, "but this doesn't mean I've agreed to anything yet." The three Gryffindors told him the plan, and after much consideration, persuasion, and yelling, Draco Malfoy agreed to this horrid plan.
Harry turned around, and walked out of the hall, going to the library before Transfiguration. Meanwhile, Hermione was walking over to Pansy. They had decided to come out to the entire school this morning, but Pansy wouldn't let them make a plan. "It'll be more fun if we wing it," she said. Hermione had just rolled her eyes and grabbed the girl's hand. Now here they were, with no idea of what to do next, and Hermione was mentally smirking. That was, until Pansy stood up on the table, dragging the Gryffindor up with her.
"I'm fine," he said in between coughs. "Just coughing, no big deal." He was feeling a bit dizzy, so he walked slowly into the front room, taking a seat on the couch. Almost instantly he was asleep, snoring softly in a position that couldn't be very comfortable. Draco, who had followed him out, Teddy in his arms, frowned. He shifted Teddy so that he had one arm free, and used his wand to fix Harry so that he was lying flat on his back across the couch.
Harry hadn't left his room since. Not for classes, not for meals, not to watch the Quidditch practices that Ginny had invited him to. It was as if he didn't even exist anymore. The only people who ever saw him anymore were Ginny, Hermione, Draco, and of course Neville, since they did share a room.
"Good."
"Alright, your logic is confusing, but I trust you. I'll do it." Draco's heart sped up a little when Harry told him he trusted him. Why did he though?
"Harry, it really is okay if you like him." The boy glared at Hermione, before sitting up and walking out, grumbling nonsense under his breath.
"What are you doing here?" Draco gave him an amused smile.
At last they were done. The only eighth years missing, since it was after curfew, were Hermione, Malfoy, a Slytherin, and a Ravenclaw. They got quite excited when they saw Malfoy wasn't there, before they remembered that he was Head Boy. Hermione was Head Girl, so that explained the only two people they actually knew.
Post traumatic stress disorder. More commonly known as PTSD. Harry Potter had PTSD. Wait till that got out, he'd make the front page of The Daily Prophet for a week. He groaned at the thought.
"Ok." Malfoy bit back a smile. Harry stood up and walked over to him, him stomach twisting, though he wasn't sure why. Nerves, probably.
"Why don't you lie him down somewhere, it doesn't look like he's got much sleep lately."
"I kissed you right after your best friend died."
"No, I actually hadn't thought about it that much. Guess I forgot," he lied. Ginny sighed, rolling her eyes.
He liked it a lot.
"No biggie, just got attacked," he said, shifting to a more comfortable position. He was quite tired, and just wanted to go back to sleep.
"It doesn't matter, you still said what you said! You can't jus-" She stopped when she saw something, or rather someone, running towards them. The two had barely moved out of the way when the figure ran past them. Hermione looked towards them, about to yell at them too, when she saw it was Draco, carrying something in his arms. It looked like...oh my gosh.
Hermione sighed. " Harry, I really am sorry about what I said a few weeks ago. And I'm sorry I told Madame Pomfrey about your P-"
"We-uh...well," Ron cleared his throat. "Ready to go?"
"Well, the boys became friends on their own, about a month ago, or maybe two. I don't remember. Anyway, a couple weeks ago, I was talking to Harry, and Draco barged in. That's when I realized they were friends. But then I thought back to before even that, when Harry had been in the hospital wing for a PTSD attack. Yes, Harry has PTSD, but not a lot of people know and you can't tell anyone. Anyway, Draco said he had found him, though I think they had been hanging out or something. What I'm trying to say, is that it was that night that made my realized Draco's feelings, even if I realized it weeks later. The problem is, I'm not sure if Harry is gay or not."
And suddenly Draco was leaning forward, but stopped, much to Harry's disliking. So he took matters into his own hands, and grabbed the blond's shirt, pulling him forward, and kissing him.
"You knew Dobby? Well, I hate to break it to you, but some git freed him, so you won't find him here." Harry laughed, and Draco gave him a puzzled look.
"But your not fine Harry. Don't you see! I'm trying to help you."
Hagrid held the limp, pale body in his arms. Dead. Harry Potter was dead.
"Rose Granger-Parkinson, Teddy is perfectly capable of making his own decisions! And I don't recall hearing you use your inside voice," Hermione scolded, making Rose blush and look down at her toes.
"I knew it!" Harry jumped, and looked around for the voice he'd heard.
Christmas holiday was approaching quickly, and Harry knew he was expected to go to the Weasley's. He couldn't though, he still felt guilty, no matter what everyone else told him. He knew it was his fault, and he relived it every night. The same dream, or rather memory, plagued him every night. Every time he fell asleep, though he tried not too, he would have to see Ron die all over again.
Harry cursed the way his heart fluttered at the words. He'd almost died time and time again from those sick bastards, and now Draco had joined the club. Draco wanted him dead.
"What's this?" he asked, picking it up.
"Harry, mate. You were doing it again. Come on, Hermione found us a carriage with Neville and Luna." Ron gave Harry a worried look, before leading him to the carriages. He looked around. It seemed the thestrals were getting a lot more attention this year.
Theodore glared and moved to point at the blond, before thinking better of it, due to the pain he got every time he moved. "Malfoy."
"Hey Granger, if you don't mind me asking, is there a reason you need to find him."
"Oh please, Narcissa is fine, darling." Harry nodded. They ate in silence for a few minutes, before Lucius spoke.
When the evil little ferret didn't look away, but merely raised an eyebrow, Harry felt his cheeks heat up (from the embarrassment, of course) and dropped his head onto his empty plate. He could only hope Malfoy hadn't seen how pink in the face he was.
"No wand? You didn't even move your hand or anything."
The compartment door slid open, snapping Harry from his trance. Giving a small smile, Harry motioned the redhead inside. Ron took the seat across from him, and they talked for a few awkward moments before the door opened yet again, this time revealing a blond boy who looked strangely familiar.
"Like I said, it's different from any other spell, it can't be done with a wand," he replied with a yawn.
"Harry, when you're with Draco, do you feel like there are millions of butterflies flying around in your chest. Does your skin tingle at every touch? Does he make you smile, make you feel...alive?"
"Right, sorry." After the queasy feeling had passed, Harry opened his eyes, and his grip on Draco's hand tightened. "You took me
quickly. The girl eyed him suspiciously.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry stared down at the now full plate of food. He felt sick just looking at it all. Harry shook his head, and pushed his plate slightly forward.
"Hello, Malfoy," Deam smirked. "How's it going?" Assuming this was a trap of some sort, the blond pulled out his wand and pointed it at the three, betrayal in his eyes as he stared at Hermione.
"Harry, your parents wouldn't want you dead either. Hurting yourself only hurts the people who love you." Harry's hand went to his wrist, and Draco watched the strange interaction, before his eyes widened.
"Oh...alright then. Did you want me to talk to him for you or something?" Hermione just stared at him, before remembering what she was supposed to be doing.
"Screaming. There was screaming," he pants.
"Are you feeling alright?"
"Shhh...it's ok. We aren't there anymore. Your safe."
"What are we, five? I really don't think my hesitation has anything to do with this."
Harry walked around the school, just going where his feet were taking him. Eventually he ended up by the lake. It reminded him a bit too much of the one he almost died in less than a year ago. It had been a freezing, icy lake, that he'd almost drowned in. He would have to, if Ron hadn't saved him. Harry was starting to think Ron should have just left him there.
------------------------------
---------------------------
"Her?" Harry asked, raising his eyebrows. Pansy frowned.
"Hermione, just listen to me, I'm sorry! I shouldn't have yelled, ok?"
"There is, actually. You see, I'm supposed to be visiting my father for Christmas, and I told him I was bringing my boyfriend with me." He struggled with his explanation, speaking too fast, then too slow when he tried to fix it. Merlin, why was this so difficult? He tugged the sides of his coat together, nervous and a bit cold.
"Harry dear, it's great to have you. Happy Christmas," Narcissa says, a big smile on her face. "Come in, you two must be freezing. Your hands are shaking." Harry looked down at his hands. They were, in fact, shaking, just not from the cold as Narcissa had assumed. He scowled at them, willing them to stop. They didn't. This was it, the feeling of being broken and helpless, and Harry was feeling it again. Happiness can never last forever.
"Drink now, or we're going to have problems." The boys looked over to her and assumed they could trust her enough not to ask any serious questions. They were very wrong. Taking the small cup from Pansy's hand, Harry downed the potion, Draco doing the same. Pansy smirked.
"What? Who?"
"Would I be asking if I had? Honestly Blaise, sometimes you can be pretty dull."
"I wet the bed until I was seven years old," Draco admitted sheepishly, staring at the ground.
"I'm doing great. Oh, Teddy will be so happy to see you! He's almost nine months old now. He can sit up, and he's even started crawling a bit." Wow, Harry had missed a lot. Would Teddy even remember him, it had been a few months since he saw Harry last.
"Then you can start with me."
"I'll throw in a good word with Ron, yeah?" Apparently, it was that simple, and he was in within a matter of seconds. Merlin, that boy must have it
He scanned the crowd, before his eyes stopped on a certain blond. How could you not find him, with that ridiculous hair of his. Honestly, it practically blinded him. He walked up to Draco, and sat down on his trunk, resting his legs, though they weren't even that tired. Draco looked at him, letting out a small sigh in relief.
"Seriously Blaise, it's so obvious. You fancy that bastard." Blaise could feel his cheeks burning up, from embarrassment of course.
Harry followed Blaise to Malfoy's dorm, ignoring the stares from the other Slytherins the best he could. As they got closer to the door, Harry could hear muffled shouts, though he couldn't exactly make out what they were saying.
*TW-Self harm*
*Ok, your good now*
-----------------------------
When the entire class had finished their potions, they were allowed to take off the lids to smell it. Harry eagerly took the lid off, wanting to see if everything was the same as before. He took a whiff of the love potion, smelling the familiar broomstick handle, treacle tart, and...there was something new. Something he couldn't put his finger on at the moment.
Harry ran out of the room, and straight to his. He threw open his trunk, grabbed the invisibility cloak and Marauder's Map, then left as quickly as he'd came. The whole time, Neville was staring at him like he was insane. Harry hadn't even noticed he was there.
"Why did we steal this, again?" Pansy questioned, tilting her head to the side, still examining the cloth laid out before them.
Draco stared at his friends. Finally, he spoke up. "Hello Pansy. Blaise." He nodded his head to each of them. "Glad you found me. Oh, and these three and I have decided to set aside our differences. So if you could refrain from the crude nicknames, that would be most appreciated." Then they gazed at each other some more, before bursting out in laughter. Harry, Ron and Hermione shared a confused look, but ignored it after a while. In all honesty, Draco, Pansy and Blaise weren't sure why they were laughing either. It just felt so good, so they kept on going.
Harry awoke to something painfully poking his side, and he grunted, looking up. Dobby was there, his face inches from Harry's. Harry jumped back and fell off his chair.
Harry nodded, because he couldn't really talk, seeing as his mouth was full of toothpaste and spit. He shoved to blond out of the bathroom, and finished brushing his teeth, before walking back out. "What are you doing here anyway?"
"Let's go find an empty compartment," Harry commented, and they left Ron's parents with a final goodbye, getting on the train. Looks and whispered followed the three as they looked for somewhere to sit.
Hermione took a deep breath. This was it, no going back now. Once she said it out loud, it would be real.
--------------------------------
There was a knock at the door. "I'll get it," Hermione said as she got up from the couch. She opened the door, and Zabini was standing there. "It's for you, Pansy."
"Oh, right. Well, uh...how do you feel about Hermione?" Pansy perked up at this, and threw Draco a confused look. He mouthed back, "Go along with it." She nodded, though she was still confused.
"They don't look alike much, do they?" he exclaimed sadly, folding his arms onto the table and resting his chin down on them.
"What's wrong with him?" Hermione gave him a confused look.
He put the cloak on as he left the common room, whispering, "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good." The map appeared, and he searched for a single small dot in particular. He found it, in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. It was pacing the room, waiting for a certain raven-haired boy. Harry went as fast as he could while still being quiet. After five minutes, he was at the door that went into the bathroom.
"Master Draco told Pretzel all about Harry Potter. He saids yous has the prettiest green eyes, and that yous were very good on yous broomstick." Harry smirked, glancing at Draco.
"Whatever lover boy, just go to him, or quite staring longingly at his door. People will start thinking you're in love with it or something." Draco scowled, then stood up. He hesitated, before walking up to the door. He was about to open it when Luna beat him to it on the other side. He jumped back, giving a small yelp.
*TW- mentions of self harm*
"This should be good," Hermione said as she took a seat on the couch. Draco glared at her, and crossed his arms.
"Sorry, but this is too good," Pansy laughed. She laughed so hard she had to wipe literal tears from her eyes, which Draco rolled his eyes at.
Harry closed the map, smiling sadly. He got up, brushed away the tears, and made his way back down to dinner.
"No Harry, it's alright. I gotta help you..." Harry was barely able to keep Ron's head from falling on the thick book underneath him as his head dropped in his half-awake state.
Harry's hands shook, so he hid them underneath the table. James turned his gaze sharply to him, and Harry gulped.
"Your guys mind games might work on Ron, but I'm not stupid like he is. I actually have a brain, unlike that teaspoon." Harry flinched, knowing he was the reason that Hermione was speaking this way about Ron. He absent-mindedly touched his left wrist, causing him to hiss in pain. Both Draco and Hermione turned to look at him.
They boys stopped to think, before Seamus piped up, saying, "We saw you with Malfoy and Harry yesterday, and were very confused at the apparent friendship between the three of you. Care to explain that first?"
"Why not?" the blond asked frowning.
Harry opened his mouth to say something but was quickly shut up by Pansy. "Oh no, don't you dare even think about saying you know at least one of us. Let me guess, you were going to say Draco? Okay, well answer me this, Golden boy. What's his favourite colour? Favourite food? Soulmate? I know every single one of these, and I bet you couldn't even-"
Harry,
She muttered under her breath as she ran to Harry, trying to pick him up, but Draco held on. "Mr. Malfoy you have to let go." He looked up at her, and she sighed at the tears in his eyes. "Very well, put him down here," she said, pointing at one of the beds. Draco walked over, and set the boy down, pulling up a chair for himself as Madame Pomfrey began a chain of spells. Ron and Hermione pulled up chairs themselves, watching Draco with confused expressions. It was going to be a long night.
"Hey, don't look at me. It was his idea," the blond said, putting his hands up in surrender. Harry rolled his eyes, before going back to reading his letter. "Who's that from?" Draco asked, peering over his shoulder.
Harry pulled out his wand, using it to summon a small, sharp knife. He put the tip of his blade to his wrist, and took a deep breath. This was it, there was no going back after. He pushed down as he dragged the knife up his wrist. His arm stung, but he relished the pain. He brought the dagger up again, feeling the cool metal against his skin. He made a few more cuts, then, satisfied for the time being, used his wand to heal the cuts, leaving thin scars along his left wrist. The raven-haired boy took a deep breath, made sure his wrist was covered, and walked out of the bathroom.
Hermione found Ron with Neville in the courtyard, as Blaise had said. He was sitting against a tree, eyes closed, while Neville stood, going on about his new plant that Gran had sent him. "Hello Neville. Ron, may I speak with you?"
"Ginny stop. I can't get back together with you." He took a deep breath, before continuing. "I think we should break up, like, officially this time. I'm no good for you, you'll end up dead. And besides, your like a sister to me." Ginny gave a small laugh, partially because she was so relieved.
The day was happy and positively perfect for everyone. Well, everyone except Harry. He didn't know why, he just really wanted to be alone. No reason, he just felt like it.
----------------------------------
"I don't know, should I?" The blond looked at him like he was insane.
----------------------------
"Come again?" Theo was taken aback by the sudden change in behavior. Just this morning everything had been fine between them.
"Hope there are no hard feelings, Weasley. I know my father's a bit of an ass, but we aren't much alike anyway. He's much more tolerable at home, I can assure you. I mean, I'm not disowned or anything."
"I kissed you back though, then I kissed you again." Harry had undoubtedly felt guilty about it. He didn't deserve happiness, no matter what people kept telling him. He was too horrible for happiness, the kiss had only confirmed his selfishness. Because what decent person is happy just about an hour after their brother died? It still felt a bit weird calling him that, though Harry supposed he wouldn't need to anymore.
"That's not really a good thing."
They passed the compartment they had sat in when Harry was in his third year. Harry had been attacked by dementors. He could still remember the cold, empty sadness that had filled him as he had passed out. He could still remember him mother's screams. And the older man they had shared the compartment with, who turned out to be one of his dad's best friends. He could still remember Remus's stiff body when he had found him lying next to the other dead bodies just a couple months ago. He could remember the night Remus had come, with news of his child's birth, the smile he wore when he asked if Harry would be the godfather. Or when he taught Harry how to cast the patronus charm. Over and over, memories of Remus Lupin played in Harry's head. He hasn't even noticed he had stopped walking.
"I love you." Draco let out a sigh of relief, while Harry stood there, trying to hold in his laughter.
"Alright class, today, we will be brewing amortentia. Since you all already know what this is and what it does, we are just going to get right into it. You may begin now."
Harry approached the boy, trying to think through everything carefully. Zabini wouldn't just
"Is everything alright? Are you guys ok? What do you need? I can-"
"Maybe it's Neville. They share a room, and have you seen him without a shirt?" Seamus added, receiving a playful smack on the arm from Dean.
Ginny truly did love Harry, she really did. But she knew it couldn't be romantic. Harry didn't make her feel the way Luna did. It had taken Ginny a few months to realize that what she felt for Luna was more than just a friendship. She didn't know if she was lesbian, or bisexual, maybe even pansexual. All she knew, was that it was Luna, and not Harry, that she loved.
"Have a seat Hermione, we have to talk."
Harry shrugged, saying, "Is anyone?"
"Ok. Wait...secret girlfriend?"
"But how? Do you love me like a boyfriend, or like a brother?" Ginny had never really thought about it. She thought for a few moments.
"I'm sorry, I thought you would have told him."
"Wow Potter, you hate your soulmate that much, do you?" Pansy said, walking beside him as they strolled to the library.
"Call me Draco. We're friends now, aren't we?"
Ginny and Luna had been spending an immense more amount of time together than the years before. There was just something about Luna, something special. Ginny would spent nights thinking about Luna right before she went to bed, only to wake up and have the blonde be the first thing she thought of.
"Last one, I'll ask you both the same. Because I'm evil, what's something you've never told anybody in your entire life?"
"Brilliant, she fancies you too." And with that, Pansy dragged Draco away, and Harry tried to ignore his feelings. Feelings that were pointless, and a waste of his time.
"Don't worry, 'Mione. I don't think he's far enough gone to be absolutely heartbroken." He really, really hoped so. "A little hurt, yes. But not heartbroken."
"Harry, you should tell him."
Dean, Seamus, and Neville already knew, but it was a thousand times worse actually seeing him. Dean couldn't look away, no matter how much it hurt. Seamus put a hand on his shoulder and gave a comforting squeeze. Dean broke his gaze for a moment to look at his boyfriend, noticing the tears falling slowly and silently. He felt guilty for not crying, not mourning his friend as he was supposed to. He wondered if people would think he didn't care. Neville retched onto the floor, leaving a bitter taste in his mouth.
"Harry wanted to be alone for a little while. I think I'm going to go for a walk, I'll see you guys later." And with that he walked out of the portrait door, sighing in relief as he leaned against a wall. Not even seconds later he felt something tugging on his hand, dragging him forward. He freaked for a second, and, remembering it was Harry, let him drag him up to the kitchens.
Ron paced the room. He was so mad. At Hermione, at Harry, at life. He was mad at the world, the unfairness brewing deep in it's core. He didn't understand why life hated him so much. He didn't understand why he was so angry all the time. He didn't understand why he couldn't get over his brother's death. The world was against him, it seemed.
"And why exactly would I care if he's fine or not?" Theo rolled his eyes.
"What?! You told me to come here, so you decide what we do, Malfoy."
""It's a shortcut," Harry said, before grabbing a long branch and poking a knob on the trunk. The tree immediately froze, and the five moved on. As they got closer, they could hear the cries of pain coming from the old shack. Harry instantly picked up the pace, the cloak falling off in his hurry. Now in a full on sprint, the five reached the entrance in minutes, Harry in the lead.
"I see you brought a girl. Girlfriend, I presume?"
"It's not right. Ron died, and it was my fault, and he should be alive right now, and I should be the one who's lying on the ground in the Shrieking Shack," Harry mumbled into Draco's shoulder.
Harry hated that everything was about him right now, when it so obviously should be about Ron. Couldn't they all see that he just didn't matter, especially right now. Ron was the one who had died, and yet everything was still circling around Harry. Why had the Weasley's even come?
------------------------------
He picked at his food, not really in the mood to eat. Harry wasn't even really hungry. He looked up at Teddy, who was sporting bright orange hair and grey eyes at the time.  He was a metamorphmagus, just like his mother had been. 'Too bad he'll never get to meet her, because of you,'  he thought. Frowning, he stood up.
"Hold up, you've already found your soulmate! Great, so I'm the only one who hasn't now." Ron dropped his head into his hands and stuffed some more food into his mouth.
Ron groaned as he made his way to his dorm, that he was now sharing with Zabini. 'How come Harry gets a room with Neville, while Hermione and I are stuck with the rotting Slytherins?' he thought to himself.
"How do you even know it was us who told her?"
+ + +
They sat in silence while Madame Pomfrey preformed countless spells, though not many seemed to be working. Hermione knew what had happened, she'd seen it happen before, at the burrow. Harry had had a PTSD attack, and a bloody awful one too.
Harry walked into the Great Hall, took a seat in between Ron and Hermione, and didn't even bother with breakfast.
"What'd the doctor say?" he asked, worry painted all over his face.
"I'm Draco. Draco Malfoy," the kid stated proudly, holding his head high, while Harry wrinkled his nose.
"What, why?!"
Draco watched the raven-haired boy for a moment before he spoke. He had dark circles under his eyes, as if he hadn't slept in a long time. He wore a grim face, and it even looked as though he had a few grey hairs, though they wouldn't be noticeable unless you were looking closely. The war, it seemed, had done his fair share on the boy who lived.
"Yes, take a seat." Harry walked over to the spare chair and sat, feeling awkward sitting there like he had so many times before. "How are you?"
Harry groaned in frustration, and went out into the common room. On the way, he ran into someone, falling down from the impact. Malfoy.
By now, Cedric had made his way over, his head in a large bubble, making his head seem wider and more misshapen than it really was. He raised an eyebrow at Harry and the merman, but said nothing and took out a knife, freeing Cho and dragging her to the surface.
"The morning I ran out of the hospital was the first time. And I've done it twice since then." Harry looked down at his feet, embarrassed and guilty.
"Ok," Hermione replied, and thought before saying, "What's your favourite class here?"
Draco relaxed back into his chair, soon falling asleep, his hand still intertwined with Harry's.
"Ron's in the Hospital Wing right now, and Harry...he's in his room."
"Sorry?"
Awoken from their deep trance, the three startled, and looked up. Malfoy was standing a few feet in front of them, clearly uncomfortable. Hands behind his back, he shifted his feet, growing a bit pink from embarrassment.
"Aren't I? I'm a freak. My stupid aunt and uncle were right. I'm a bloody freak, Hermione." A few tears had started to spill from his eyes.
Everyone just watched him cry, and he hated it. He fully regretted letting them all in. He regretted letting the others go with him to the Shrieking Shack. He regretted being born, for Merlin's sake!
? Teddy, what did Draco give you this time?" The child opened his hands, revealing a small chocolate bar. Harry sighed, giving Draco an exasperated look. "Alright, you can have the chocolate after you've finished your lunch. And Draco, don't forget Pansy and Hermione are coming over for dinner." Draco looked up from his food.
"If your looking for Harry, he's not here. Neville saw him run off."
"You tell me if you want, but I won't pressure you into anything." Harry nodded once more.
"It doesn't matter."
"Have you guys seen Draco at all today?"
Hermione stared at him, shocked. "How did you find out?"
"I'm going to bed," he stated, and plopped onto his bed without another word, not even bothering to change. He didn't fall asleep though. He couldn't. He never wanted to sleep again.
Narcissa smiled as they walked off hand in hand, and the corner's of Lucius's mouth turned up slightly, before he cleared his throat. "If the Dark Lord ever finds out-"
Draco spent nearly any free time he had with Harry. It was difficult, seeing someone he cared for so deeply this way. He tried to help in any way he could, but there really wasn't much he could do. He had moved back into his old room, since Theo hadn't returned, which was probably a good thing. If Draco ever saw that git again, he would Avada Kedavra the living daylights out of him.
"Well...uh, you see, I was on the seventh floor. I was walking in one of the corridors, when I saw Harry fall against a wall, near the Room of Requirements. I walked over and he was panting and shaking. I picked him up, and ran to the hospital," he said, tweaking the story just slightly. Hermione eyed him carefully, before nodding her head, and sitting back down in the seat next to Draco.
Everyone laughed. The air was light and happy, even George cracked a smile. The whole family had come to dinner, even Percy. The family had decided to forgive him for being a stupid git for a few years.
Harry stepped out of the floo, using his wand to clean up the mess he'd made.
"Is he alone?"
"To offer me a job." Draco raised an eyebrow at this.
------------------------------
"I can hear you!" Ron shouted, which made them laugh harder. Harry liked laughing again, it felt good.
The feeling came so sudden, and Harry found himself gasping for breath. He was suffocating, he thought. What in the name of Merlin did Dobby give him? But then he felt them, flapping in the wind.
Harry's state worried the blond, though he wouldn't admit it. He had absolutely no clue as to why he was worrying in the first place. He came to the conclusion that he was confused, not worried.
"Well, yes, of course I do."
So, this was what led Ginny to standing outside Harry's dorm room for fifteen minutes, before the Gryffindor mustered up enough courage to actually knock on the door, and even then it was small and weak. It wasn't that she was scared to break up with him, it was hurting him. Harry, who had become so fragile and broken.
Harry needed the sleep, but he awoke just five minutes later when there was a knock at the door. His eyes shot open, and he fell out of Draco's lap. So when Neville opened the door, Hermione found him lying awkwardly on the floor, rubbing his head a bit. She noticed the puffy and bloodshot eyes, but chose not to say anything about them. She instead turned her attention to the others.
"Hey Hermione, how's it going?"
"What does this have to do with anything?"
"Wait, what do you mean you thought he had a thing for me? I need answers, stat!" Harry laughed. "On second thought, I want answers as soon as you tell me who you fancy."
"Her lovebirds, if you don't mind, we kinda have to find Draco, so can you do all that lovey stuff later?"
--------------------------
"Nothing." Pansy rolled her eyes, shoving Harry's shoulder lightly and making him stumble a few steps to the side.
"Not a word about this, Malfoy," Harry growled, cutting him off. He cursed under his breath when he could feel himself going a bit red, and turned, swimming back to the bank where the judges were, Malfoy following behind him. He ignored the people in the stands, and Hermione giggling behind her hand, wrapped in a towel.
Mr. Moony says that Harry of all people should know the correct password, seeing as he is who he is. Harry gave a quiet chuckle.
"So? Is that a problem?"
"It's not really what. Well, it is, but...just...it's kinda a place. I'll take you there tomorrow, ok?"
Ron got up from the floor, and walked backwards towards the door. "I'm gonna...Harry...yeah," he said, before darting out. He really did go to Harry's though. "Harry, help me. I am having a sexual identity crisis!"
"I'm fine," he said, getting up a bit to quickly, causing him to get dizzy and fall over. He stayed on the ground, waiting for the black spots dotting his vision went away.
Hermione was about to say something, when Harry suddenly jumped up. "What time is it?" Hermione cast a tempus charm. It was just after nine. "Shoot, I have to go, Hermione."
"Hello, I'm here for the 3:00 appointment for Harry Potter."
"Liar, you were thinking about Weasley, weren't you?"
Draco looked at Madame Pomfrey, before looking at the glass covering the floor. He pulled out his wand, cleaning it up, before running after Harry.
"Well, we were watching a muggle movie, long story, and then we kinda fell asleep on the couch when it was over. Then, I don't know, I just panicked and ran in here."
"I've been doing alright, thanks. And, if we're going to be sharing a dorm, I think first names will do." Hermione nodded, and smiled.
"I didn't do anything," he said slowly, choosing his words carefully.
"Why'd we stop here?" Blaise asked, carefully watching the tree that was now thrashing it's branches around freely.
Quickly, the ferret slipped the hoodie over his head, fixing it around his slim body. Potter was small, but the hoodie fit Draco perfectly. Must be a size too big on him. Butterflies swarmed the Slytherin's stomach as he imagined Potter wearing it, and ohmygod he was wearing Potter's hoodie. One that he'd worn before. He took another whiff.
"To who, dear?" Lily asked, grinning at her little angel.
"Well obviously, Ronald. Now go away, I'm still mad at you." Ron rolled his eyes and walked out of the Great Hall, Dean and Seamus following quickly behind.
Pansy ran to her friend to comfort her, while Blaise stood there awkwardly. He was never good at comforting people, especially when they were in tears. He had no idea what to do, and he wasn't even friends with the girl.
"Ok..." he replied, getting more confused by the minute.
"James!" Lily cried, smacking her husband's arm.
"Look, I know you two are friends and all, but could you maybe not mention this to him? He'd surely come and murder me if he ever found out, and I only just found out about an hour or so ago."
"I do not, Theo. How could you even suggest such a thing?" And that's when Ron walked in. Blaise felt the speed of his heart pick up, and his chest felt funny. His eyes widened, and he turned to Theo. But, the boy only laughed at the new knowledge he had kindly provided for his friend.
"Sure, come on in," he said, rolling his eyes.
"What happened to him?" Draco asked, his voice no higher than a whisper. He grabbed Harry's hand to calm him down, rubbing circles with his thumb. Hermione studied the strange interaction, before turning her attention back to the conversation.
"Don't you want your hoodie?" Blaise asked, staring questioningly at the boy. Harry looked over at Draco, only to find him already staring.
"Theo, what are you doing here?"
"If it's not a big deal, then why can't you just tell me?" Harry's hands clenched into fists, and he let out a yawn, only making him even more tired then he already was.
"HOW IS THIS GOING TO HELP! HAVING THE DOCTORS TELL ME EVERYTHING WRONG WITH ME!" Hermione was trying not to get angry, but it was so hard. Couldn't he see that this was best? Couldn't he see that this would help? Couldn't he see that he wasn't ok?
Madame Pomfrey looked up from a hospital bed with a student on it when the door opened. When Hermione, Pansy, and Blaise walked in levitating an unconscious Ron, she immediately rushed over.
"Oh good, he's sleeping again? Before school started, I don't think he got a wink of sleep if he could help it. It was horrible, watching him suffer all alone." Draco looked at her, then back down at Harry.
"Of course." Pansy smiled and watched as her girlfriend walked of. "You couldn't have been a bit nicer?" she asked the blond.
"If we thought he was straight, would we be trying to get you two together?"
"Harry, have you been crying?" Harry stilled, willing the tears already welling up in his eyes back down.
"Oh, yes Master Draco, sir. Pretzel is supposed to tell you dinner will be ready soons, sir."
"What did you do this time?"
Hermione took a deep breath, and walked over to where Harry was seated in the common room.
It had been a day since Harry had got released from the hospital. Luckily, Theo and the other two had just ignored each other the whole, otherwise the hospital wing would have most likely been set on fire. Now that Harry was back, the others were ready to take action on Operation Drarry. The first step would be all Hermione, and possibly Draco.
"Whatever Weasel."
-----------------------------
"Sorry, I was doing homework with Dean and Seamus," Harry replied, folding his cloak, and setting it on the ground with the map on top.
"Someone's grouchy," the girl muttered, causing him to scowl even more. "And yes, actually, I did need, or rather want, something."
"He-hem." The two turned to face Umbridge, disgust on both of their faces. "Since Mr. Potter has failed to meet the requirements of our meeting, I'm afraid-"
"What's wrong with the world?"
"Go on."
Her next idea, was that they were dating, but that made no sense. Harry was straight, and even if he wasn't, he wouldn't date Malfoy. She laughed at herself for even considering it.
"Yeah. Yeah, that sounds okay." Harry let out a sigh of relief.
"No, sweetie. No," Narcissa replied softly, tightening her arms around her little boy.
They talked until there was a loud knock at the door. Harry opened it, and Ron burst in, looking furious. That only made Harry and Neville laugh again. Harry closed the door, while Ron took a seat on the coach.

Hermione
"I think we'll be off to the kitchen now," Narcissa said, motioning for her sister to follow her. They left, leaving the two boys alone. Draco took a seat next to Harry, who hadn't so much as looked up yet.
"Harry, about Draco, he-"
"Harry?" The raven-haired boy looked up, and when his eyes met Draco's, they widened.
Harry froze, and stopped breathing.
"Looking for Draco?" Harry jumped, and turned around. Pansy stood behind him, a smirk painted across her face. He nodded. "Well, you won't find him there, since he basically moved out."
"I'll tell you later." Madame Pomfey walked in, eyes falling on the boy, who face was drained of color, beads of sweat rolling down his forehead.
Harry looked back, the roaring fire threatening to devour his ankles. He could just barely make out the blond struggling to climb up the top of one of the many piles of junk. As much as he wanted to hate him, he couldn't. He could never hate him.
"Well can you blame me? You insulted my only friend at the time!"
Hermione, for the first time in a while, didn't have an answer. She was stumped, befuddled, baffled. She hadn't even realized that they were at the Gryffindor table until Ginny was pulling her down to sit, waving goodbye to Luna.
"What, Ronald?" She glared at him.
"Sounds good. So Harry, what do you want to do?"
"Can't say I do, seeing as mine's a guy."
"Dray took me flying on his broomstick!" Harry raised an eyebrow at Draco, who had just walked in.
"You didn't see it happen. You weren't...you weren't...it really was me this time, Draco." And Harry didn't even know he had it in him, but he started crying again. He just wanted everyone to leave. He wanted the pitiful looks to go away, and he wanted people to stop telling him it was going to be okay, that he was going to be okay. Because couldn't they see that he wasn't, and that he'd never be.
"My guess was to make you jealous, and it obviously worked."
She hesitated for a moment. It was a Saturday, and she and Pansy had planned to meet up and do some homework, just hanging out when they were finished. Figuring what the two needed couldn't possibly take all day, she gave a nod, agreeing to meet up. She then went back to her meal, also making sure that Harry had a small bit of food. Not too much though, he was supposed to ease back into a normal breakfast. The Gryffindor watched as her brother picked up a piece of toast, and paled as it reached his mouth. He set it back down, feeling a bit sick. Hermione sighed.
"HARRY JAMES POTTER, YOU GET OVER HERE RIGHT NOW!" Madame Pomfrey shrieked, and Harry sighed and walked over, noticing Fleur break through the water, holding her sister in her arms, and started coming towards the others. He looked back to Madame Pomfrey, who had a potion in her hands and was waiting impatiently for him.
"Huh, can't say I saw that coming."
"Will you just tell me what's wrong with you? You never tell me stuff like this."
"Brilliant. How long will I be staying again?"
"So, um...I'll give you my present later. You'll either really hate me, or thank me a million times. Or both." Harry gave him a weird look. "Anyway, let's go find mother. She's been worried sick about you."
The thing is he didn't just have PTSD. He also had depression, and an eating disorder. If he had any of those he had before the war, he wasn't sure. Either way, he thought he was pretty messed up.
"Very well. Shall we have dinner then?" the man asked, standing up. He folded the paper, setting it down where he'd been sitting, and began walking towards the dining room, motioning for the two to follow. Harry already felt bad for dragging Ginny into this, but he knew James would be expecting him to have a girlfriend sooner or later.
"But why not? I love him, daddy."
After Dora and Teddy left, Harry went to his room without another word. When Ron came in, he pretended to be asleep. He eventually ended up falling asleep anyway.
"I just need to. Let me go Granger."
"Draco."
"Harry! When did you get here?" Hermione asked, still recovering from the slight scare.
"Harry, we were just worried. Can you blame us?"
"Just have him come here, if he wants. You know what, I'll invite Ginny and Luna as well. Remember the last time we forgot to invite the two." Both boys shuddered.
"STOP IT!" Harry's voice cut through Hermione's, putting a stop to whatever she was going to say next. He pulled his legs up, hugging his knees, and resting his head on top of them. "Just stop the arguing, and mind your own business Hermione."
"You're...one of them," he said shakily, staring at the mark that stood out against Draco's pale skin.
"What is it, Ted?" Harry asked, looking up from the letter he'd received.
Harry began muttering under his breath, a scowl plastered on his face. "Tea, darling?" Harry jumped, falling off the couch, landing with a loud thud. He looked up, to see Andromeda with a thoughtful look on her face.
Ron looked confused at first. He didn't know any guys named Pansy. Then something clicked. "Pansy Parkinson, your roommate?"
"Harry James Potter, if you think I'm just going to give in and...drop this, as you said, then you're dumber than I thought." Harry rolled his eyes, then yawned again.
"I'm not sure really, why?"
"What did you do to him?" Draco yelled, pushing in front of the other three.
"Pretzel?"
"For your information, I found him like this. And don't act like you care. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be on my way to the hospital wing." Ron walked on, leaving a fuming, worried ferret behind.
Ron stopped pacing and just collapsed on the floor, falling on his knees, tears streaming down his face. He'd screwed up, with everyone and everything. He always seemed to mess everything up. Ron had lost Harry, and now he'd lost Hermione too.
"Wouldn't they just be adorable together? Finally, someone else who sees their potential. And Malfoy obviously likes Harry, it a wonder how no one else realizes it." The couple was taken aback by her sudden fangirl moment, but then sighed in relief.
"Oh, um...just since sixth year."
Harry nearly crashed into the wall.
"What'd you do?" Harry asked.
Harry hugged his mother one last time before he left, promising to write at least once a week. With a final nod towards his father, he headed off towards the train, looking for a compartment. When he found an empty one, he slid inside and shut the door behind him, flopping onto the seat.
"Yeah right. If I do that you have to let me do your hair that day." Harry shrugged, going back to packing. "I was joking!"
"Making a snowman."
"Hey you," Harry said, making Draco jump, before turning around.
--------------------------------
The two parted ways, and Harry trudged over to where Ron and Hermione were, taking a seat next to Hermione, who was in the middle, and pulled out his Potions textbook.
"How did you know that you liked Luna? How did you know that you liked girls?"
"Levicorpus!" Harry shot up in the air, before Nott released him almost instantly. Harry fell to the ground at lightning speed, and his head his a rock, causing it to bleed. His knee and elbow were also bleeding, though not as bad. Nott repeated the spell once more, letting Harry fall again. This time, when Harry hit the ground he blacked out. Nott punched him in the face, blood now also flowing from his nose, and took of before anyone found him.
-------------------------------
Blaise was standing with a shocked Potter behind him, at least having the decency to look somewhat guilty.
As they were sitting down to watch the movie, Ron noticed a certain blond was nowhere to be seen. "Shouldn't Malfoy be back by now, it's kinda late?"
Harry shook it off, telling himself it was nothing. He brought his trunk into the house, taking it up to Ron's room. He absent-mindedly turned to let Hedwig out of her cage. His heart clenched. "Right," he told himself, "I killed her too."
