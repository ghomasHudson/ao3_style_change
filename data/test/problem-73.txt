“I need you to do some research for me ‘Mione, you’re the best at that,” Harry said. “Anything you can find on soulmate clocks.”
Malfoy stared at the hand on his shoulder for a long time before finally lying back down. He sighed, closing his eyes again.
Harry agreed, kissing Draco once more before finally letting him go. They had both finished eating anyway and it was time for their last classes of the day. Blaise was there to pick Draco up and walk with him to his next class. As the two were saying their goodbyes, Harry leaned in and whispered, “I might have left a hickey.”
Draco shot his head up to look at him, gawking. “Merlin help me,” he groaned, his head falling back down. Draco felt Harry’s hands continue where they left off, pushing his thighs open gently. It wasn’t until he felt a finger prod his hole did he gasp, his hands coming up to cover his face.
Very smut-heavy. So if it ain't your speed you can just skip to the next chapter for the climax (no pun intended)
Harry enjoyed the startled look on the other’s face. It was clear he wasn’t expecting him to be so forward. But Draco quickly pulled himself together.
“You’re impossible,” he whispered against his lips. Draco gave up then. He let himself succumb to Harry's prodding. Before he could argue, Draco pulled away from Harry and lifted up the other’s shirt, pulling off.
Just as he was about to say something more, Slughorn cleared his throat to grab the class’s attention.
“Don’t be daft,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes. “He probably got a plea bargain— how he managed to do that is beyond me.”
He was no longer covered in sparkles but had a very sour look on his face. Soon enough, it became apparent why. A horrible stench filled the room, making Harry gag and pinch his nose.
Whatever, Harry thought. He wasn’t worth it, he just had to keep telling self that. He wasn’t worth it he wasn’t worth it he wasn’t worth it he wasn’t worth-
“But- but you don’t have a soulmate everyone’s known that for years” Draco snapped, sounding almost angry.
Harry only shrugged and offered a sheepish smile as he headed back towards Hogwarts. The only thing he cared about was that Malfoy was alive and breathing.
Harry swallowed. It wasn’t pleasant, but it wasn’t terrible either. He’d have to remember that for next time.
“Once you have chosen your pairs, head up the highest floor in the school! We have spelled the common room to be house neutral and you will all intermingle,” McGonagall announced to all the Eighth years left in the dining hall, clapping her hands and dismissing them.
“What time is it Harry?” she asked him as they sat down together in the common room, talking quietly. “Well you’re not dead, but knowing you, you still got in some sort of trouble. Is Malfoy alright? Do you know why he was missing? Is your arm—”
The three of them kind of stood there for a moment, lingering in the doorway. Draco didn’t want to let them in right now, he was still a little shaky, and even if he wouldn’t admit it, he wanted to spend more time with Harry.
“Excuse me,” Malfoy sniped in, “I never said any of this, you piece of shite. Don’t throw me in this.”
For those of you who don't know, Felix Felicis is a good luck potion (basically). And yes, I'm aware that it takes around 6 hours to brew but for the sake of the fic, it only took two hours. You're welcome.
“Not much, Professor” he murmured, yawning. “I was just curious if you have any more information on my time?” McGonagall was silent. Finally, she let out a long sigh. Harry realized she looked as tired as he felt. It hadn’t occurred to him how much she must be handling.
Draco’s wrists were pinned above him, away from his face as he looked up at Harry. It was almost beautiful in a way to see him like this, but the thought didn’t last long. He knew Harry was close, his thrusts getting faster. Draco couldn’t hide as he moaned openly. His toes curled as his back arched off the bed, crying out for Harry. He could feel his wrists being pressed into the bed; it was intoxicating to know Harry had him in the palm of his hands. The new angle Harry was fucking him in made Draco’s eyes roll, every breath being knocked out of him.
Harry could hear Ron and Hermione muttering in the background as he watched Draco enter the hall, trailing him with his eyes. He noticed he didn’t bother to dry his hair this morning.
“Professor, that is utterly unfair,” Draco shrieked, his jaw on the floor. “I did absolutely nothing wrong and you want me to spend a whole week with him?”
He didn’t touch Malfoy, he knew the boy would hex him into next Tuesday, but he didn’t stop himself from staring. After Madam Pomfrey cleaned him up, Malfoy positively glowed. Maybe that was from the nightlight next to him, but still. His hair was cleaned and brushed from his face so that his jawline and cheekbones were accented. Harry also noticed the smaller freckles dashed across Malfoy's nose; something he would have never been able to see otherwise. Part of him wished the other would wake up and kiss him again, but he didn’t know why he wanted that so bad.
He gently reached out and started pulling off the cobwebs that were stuck in his hair. Malfoy stiffened.
“I said,” Pansy waved her hand in front of his face, trying to gain Harry’s attention, “do we bother you, Potter? Hmm?”
Harry laughed with his whole chest, his features lighting up. The whole situation was just so absurd that it was funny.
Harry sighed but smiled, ready to fill Ron in. “It's quite weird not having you both on my adventures, but not too much has happened.”
“Merlin almighty,” Darco muttered to himself as he took the base in his hand, looking up at Harry. The man’s face flashed with confusion, then with arousal.
Draco huffed out a laugh, shaking his head. “Of course you don’t,” he snapped and sat on the bed angrily. He knew Harry wasn’t letting him go anywhere anytime soon. “You don’t have to worry about that because everyone wants you.”
Ron was snickering from his seat. “This is just like the faerie incident,” He said quietly to Dean, a grin spread on his face.
Harry wrapped Malfoy in the cloak he had brought, thankful he had thought of it back in the dorm and picked the other up. Harry stared at Malfoy’s face for a moment as he held him. His face was peaceful as he slept, the lines of stress in his face gone. Merlin he was was gorgeo-
“Do I even want to know why?” Blaise asked, only slightly amused. “You two are getting along it seems… even with all this.”
“No...no, I’m not alright, Professor. I was sent here by Professor Slughorn but…but that’s not what’s worrying me quite frankly,” Harry said, swallowing thickly. He looked up at her, holding out his arm, and pulled back the sleeve of his cloak.
Harry woke up early the next morning to avoid having to argue with Malfoy. After all, he would probably end up doing that later anyway.
“Potter, you can’t just be leaving me gifts for everyone to see,” Draco hissed as he stood next to the other, arms crossed.
Harry pushed the door open and stepped in, gently closing the door behind him as he tried to regain his focus. He couldn’t. Of course, he couldn't, his bloody numbers were gone.
Harry gently pulled off the last of the other’s clothing, his dick standing erect. He was nervous now, not wanting to hurt the other. “May I?”
The doors slammed on their faces. Harry just stood there for a moment, trying to process what happened. He locked eyes with Draco, who scowled at him.
The blonde smirked as his eyes darted to the other, knowing it would get a rise out of him. Harry rolled his eyes and groaned.
“Good morning, class. Please have a seat!” announced a voice from the front of the classroom. Professor Slughorn ushered everyone in, a shaky smile on his face. “I know the first day back for everyone can be quite exciting but please settle down now.”
He knew he probably didn’t have to, but Harry liked asking. He watched Draco turning pink and looking away.
He let the two go. Even if he wanted to help Malfoy they probably wouldn’t want him around, Pansy more so than Blaise. Harry paused at one of the tables, but he didn’t plan on staying for long. He grabbed something to quickly eat as he headed back out.
Harry sighed, ruffling his messy hair to make it more manageable for himself. Adjusting his glasses, he took a sip of pumpkin juice and faced her.
“Harry, I tried to look up the history of soulmate clocks, but your request was so vague that I just compiled everything I could find,” she said, placing six books onto his lap.
Draco grimaced at that and tried to yank the potions away, but they ended up slipping through his fingers. The jarring movement had startled Harry and he dropped the vials. He was suddenly staring at a very angry, very wet, and very shiny Draco.
“You stepped on my glasses,” Harry replied, ignoring Malfoy’s taunts. He picked the pieces and stood up. Now he was the one staring down at Malfoy. Since when had he gotten taller than the other?
But Draco’s harsh reaction only made Harry more curious and even when potion class ended and the two had gone their separate ways, Harry couldn’t stop thinking about Malfoy. The only one to pull him from his thoughts was Hermione.
“Harry, mate, you’ve got to stop doing that,” Ron said as he shook his shoulders. “You’ve been such a spaz recently, hasn’t he, Hermione?”
The next few hours were a blur. Once Harry got Malfoy back to the school, he took him immediately to Madam Pomfrey. First, he was scolded for being out so late, then he was scolded for potentially getting hurt himself, then was scolded
Draco scoffed. “I'm not the boy I once was, Potter. Muggleborns are completely fine, as well as Muggle items. I just wasn’t expecting you to wear them around here.”
Harry was surprised to find that he was the first one there but settled down easily as he ordered butterbeer. It wasn’t long before he saw Hermione and Ron stumbled in, who were clearly attached at the hip. Harry tried not to feel too jealous since things were looking up for him anyway. He waved them over, smiling.
Harry was at a loss for words. He was never really good at comforting people verbally and he cursed himself for it. So he did what he thought was right.
His eyes were drawn to Malfoy’s clock. Without his robe on, he could see both the dark mark and the numbers, each on a separate wrist. His numbers ticked down rhythmically. It was fascinating to watch Harry, who never had any of his numbers to observe. Suddenly, the numbers shimmered and disappeared.
He pulled back then, looking at Draco’s flushed face and neck. He was breathing heavily, lips parted, but he could only hold eye contact with Harry for so long. Draco made a small noise and buried his face into Harry's shoulders, gripping his arms.
When Harry grabbed Malfoy, a kitchen sponge soaked in blood fell into his lap. Harry realized in horror that the other was scrubbing his arm raw.
“I thought it was ‘Potter’,” he called out after him, laughing as he heard Draco telling him to shut up.
Pansy looked at Blaise incredulously, scoffing and rolling her eyes as she followed Harry, Blaise right behind.
“I would say stop acting like my mother, but my mother often forgot me,” Draco said almost casually as he put his book down and took the plate.
Harry kissed him deeply, cupping his face with both hands. Everything about him was just perfect. His hands spread Draco’s legs again, lining himself up with the other. It was so hot and warm inside Draco. Even though he had barely pressed inside, it was still driving Harry mad. The reaction he got from Draco was even better. His head had fallen back, his eyes fluttering as he tried to adjust to all the new feelings shooting through him.
Draco was blushing again, he could feel it. But he didn’t care and grabbed Harry by the hair to pull him into a possessive kiss. This only spurred Harry on more and he grabbed Draco’s dick at the base.
Trying to focus was never going to work, Harry realized halfway through the day. He was just going to have to take the work back to his room and worry about it tomorrow. But being in his dorm brought on another set of problems.
“Harry,” Hermione said, gently shaking him with her hand on his shoulder. “I think you should sleep, if only for a little. It’ll help you think.”
Draco made a small noise. When Harry pulled back, he could see the other was blushing and averting his eyes.
“So,” he echoed. In all honesty, he didn’t think he was going to get this far. Harry sipped his own tea, making a face. “How do you like this stuff, really Malfoy?” he asked him, shaking his head.
Draco grabbed the book from Harry’s grasp, only to shriek when he was grabbed by the waist and pulled into bed with him. Harry was smiling now, pinning Draco below him. The blonde was scowling, pushing Harry’s face away every time he tried to kiss him.
Harry finally saw Malfoy that night. The other was in the dorm room as Harry came back from talking to Hermione and Ron on the castle grounds. “Malfoy—” he began to say.
He groaned as he realized he should have just told Hermione the specifics. She was rambling already, and Harry gently closed one of the books to stop her.
When Harry woke up the next morning, Malfoy wasn’t there. He tried to suppress it, but Harry was worried. When he went to go take a shower, he realized that Malfoy had been there. There were still droplets of water scattered across the floor. He relaxed slightly knowing the other was fine.
“That’s the last anyone’s seen him, Potter.” Pansy’s words were daggers of ice. “Convince me why I shouldn’t hex you.”
Right as Harry sat down, he noticed Ron bump right into Hermione. Harry didn’t need to look anymore to know that they were soulmates. Of course, they were.
Harry said his goodbyes and headed down to McGonagall’s office to talk about different sleeping arrangements.
“I’ve officially been saved by the Boy Who Lived again, I guess nothing should surprise me anymore.”
“Where’s Draco?” she demanded, holding her wand to Harry’s throat. Harry realized Blaise was also there, right behind her.
Slughorn walked away with a smile on his face while Harry began to bottle up the potion. He kept subtly glancing at Draco during the process, trying to catch a glimpse of his dark mark again.
“Good evening, Magorian,” Harry said and nodded his head slightly, unsure of how to properly address centaurs. “Umm, am I— are we intruding?”
Harry was fed up and had had enough. He didn’t know what came over him, but he grabbed Draco by the shoulders and pulled him in, kissing his lips for a moment. Draco was stiff, but he didn’t pull away until Harry did.
“I'm ‘stirring vigorously’ as per the instructions,” retorted Harry, glaring back at him. “I am capable of stirring, Malfoy”
Harry leaned down to check on Malfoy, who was still breathing. He looked horrible; his hair was a mess, he was missing his cloak, he was covered in dirt and muck, and he was bleeding.
There was no malice in Malfoy’s voice, not today. He started to sit up, nose crinkling as he realized where he was.
“C’mon Harry, what’s wrong?” Ron offered, awkwardly patting his back. He wasn’t the best at this sort of thing. Hermione rolled her eyes at the stilted gesture.
Harry frowned and turned to Malfoy angrily. “Really now? You’ve resorted to pettiness? I thought you were more clever than that, Malfoy.”
“You have to stop doin’ that,'' Harry mumbled, kissing him deeper. His hand tugged a little harder, his hips pressing a little deeper. Draco leaned into all of the touches, his skin feeling like it was on fire.
“Oh Harry, it’s you!” Hermione said and whirled to face him, setting down her fork. “I cannot believe you sometimes! I know you have your issues with Malfoy but please tell me you didn’t get into too much trouble? For once in our lives, we’re trying
Draco laughed, really laughed, and shook his head. “Yes Harry, it was good.” He propped himself up and kissed Harry softly. It was such a tender moment, Draco’s chest filling with adoration. When he pulled away, he cleared his throat.
As the rest of the class started to pull out their textbooks and cauldrons, Harry slammed his head against the desk quietly. Of course this was his permanent seat. First the dorms, and now this. What was next, was someone going to chain him and Malfoy together?
Harry sounded genuinely concerned as he looked at Draco, trying to pull some answers from him. He could see Draco swallow, who looked away again.
Draco’s hand shot out to grip the other’s shoulder. “Stop doing that!” he moaned, eyebrows knitted together. “I can feel it…”
Pansy was shaking her head in disbelief. “Is this what you do every time you leave the castle? Frolic with centaurs? Christ,  Potter, you’re just friends with everyone!”
At the moment, the two were sitting in potions class, Malfoy working on the potion in front of them. Harry was helping where he could, but Draco often took over to ensure everything went smoothly. This left Harry plenty of time to stare at the potions prodigy, even when he didn’t realize it. He had memorized Malfoy’s quirks and habits, the way he always crossed his legs when he first sat down, or the way he always had to fix his cloak in a certain manner. The most obvious to Harry was how Malfoy always kept his Dark Mark hidden. Harry almost never got a chance to look at it and when he did catch a glimpse, it was only a split second before Draco hid it away again.
“And I don’t regret it,” he said, pulling the bottle out of Malfoy’s hands and putting it back in his trunk.
McGonagall was careful as she held Harry’s wrist. Harry noticed how much the war had drained her as she examined his wrist. The creases in her forehead were deeper, as well as the lines along her mouth. It never occurred to him how much of a toll everything must have taken on her.
At least the portraits were as loud as ever, filling the hall with their observations of the students. It was never boring in the halls of Hogwarts.
Harry couldn’t wipe the smile off of his face for the rest of the day. It was the happiest he had been in a while, and Draco (of all people) had done this to him. Since it was the weekend, Harry met up with Hermione and Ron at The Three Broomsticks to catch up. Even though they were able to spend more time with each other this year, they had spent quite a fair amount apart. Harry attributed that to Ron’s newfound clinginess to Hermione.
He didn’t have a response and Harry didn’t wait for one. Draco felt the thrusts, slow and shallow at first, the other barely moving inside him, but it didn’t take long for Harry to want more, chasing his pleasure. Draco felt every thrust in his core, moans being pulled from him against his will.
By the end of the class, the potion was finally ready for the last step and Harry was exhausted. He wiped his sweaty forehead and sighed, glancing at the clock. It was almost time to say the last incantation. He lifted his wand and opened his mouth, but was cut off by Draco, who grabbed his wrists.
“I just want to kiss you, Draco. I don’t know what that means, but I’m not lying to you. And I want you to kiss me back, maybe. But all you ever do is snap at me until one of us walks away. For once, Draco, can you just be honest and tell me what’s going on?”
Draco sucked in a breath, utterly still. He bowed his head as he tried to stop the tears from gathering in his eyes. Harry hugged him. He had started to enjoy wrapping his arms around the other, holding him tightly.
Pansy, a bit confused, followed Blaise as he waved and left. Draco sighed and shut the door, closing his eyes. Why did everything have to be so emotionally exhausting?
“You really don’t know?” Draco scoffed. “It’s always me, Potter, never you. They’ve been at it all day— ‘Draco the pansy,’ they say. ‘Draco’s a homosexual. Absolutely disgusting. He's a fucking fairy’ Do you know how long I’ve had to hide to keep myself safe? Hidden myself away so I’m not shamed anymore than I already am?!”
Draco sighed, shaking his head as he could already imagine the other’s response. He was always so brazen.
Something inside Harry hurt to watch Draco like this. It was strange to not see the other put together, ready to challenge anyone who stood in his way, but he wasn’t judging him. He had come to realize that Draco was struggling just as much as he had, just differently.
“You’re focused on the wrong things, Mr. Potter. I suggest you focus on yourself, and not Mr. Malfoy. Goodnight, Harry.”
“I know,” Harry said, his laugh fading as he smiled down at the other. “Wow,” he murmured softly, gazing down at the other.
Harry decided it was best to leave. Plus, he could take a long, warm shower without worrying about Malfoy’s fussing. And he did just that. By the time Malfoy came back, Harry had washed up, dressed, and was reading in bed. He watched the other boy out of the corner of his eyes.
Harry decided to follow the path they were already on. At first, he was hopeful. The night was still young and he had Blaise and Pansy to help him look for Malfoy, but as the hours dragged on and Harry felt himself get tired, he lost what little hope he had.
“Can I help you, Mr. Potter?” McGonagall asked calmly, ignoring the fiasco that was unfolding in front of her.
“Potter,” the other practically hissed as he left with a flourish of his cape. Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry’s mouth dropped and his eyes widened as he finally accepted the truth. His soul numbers were gone. He suddenly felt light-headed as he slowly ascended the stairs.
Harry held his wrist with his other hand over the table, trying to hide the truth. He wasn’t ready. Just a few more days.
When he turned back around, Malfoy was still sitting close to him still, a small pout on his lips. “You really are horrible.”
“‘The boy who lived’ isn’t lusted after for no reason, is he, Harry?” Malfoy murmured as his eyes flicked across his body. God, he was gorgeous.
It was after a long day of classes and Harry had tried to make tea to the best of his ability when Malfoy walked into their dorm room. The other noticed immediately, pausing in the doorway and raising an eyebrow.
“It’s not fair…” Malfoy whined, closing his eyes as he leaned against the table. “You and your messy hair, and your broken glasses, and your crooked smile.”
“I'm going to hug you now,” Harry said as gently as he could. He could feel Draco stiffen already, but he didn’t let that stop him from pulling him closer, wrapping his arms around his shoulders.
Harry wasn’t even thrusting that much into him but every movement sent waves of pleasure through him. Harry was doing everything right.
Draco let out a lengthy sigh, eyeing Harry. “You’re a needy type, aren’t you, Harry Potter,” he murmured and leaned down to kiss him.
Draco’s voice echoed through the room, leaving a deafening silence in its wake. Harry slowly looked over at him again, really regarding him for the first time since he had walked into the room.
Draco indulged him, grinding his hips down. The friction sparked heat in his stomach, making him bite his lips. He could feel Harry’s girth, even through his trousers.
Harry wondered if he should try and talk to him. What was the worst that could happen? He and Malfoy never had a good relationship to start and they barely tolerated each other now. As he started to gather the courage to ask him some questions, he heard noises from Malfoy’s bed. At first, Harry thought he was having another nightmare, but before he got the chance to check on the other, Malfoy let out a breathy sigh, very clearly not in any distress.
So Harry did. He sat on the bed next to Draco and tilted his chin up a little. Harry took his time this time as he leaned forward to lock lips with the other. They were soft, just like last time, and sweet from the lip balm he used. Draco shuddered as he finally relaxed as Harry touched him. The other’s hand came up and wrapped his fingers in Harry's hair, pulling him closer.
But it was enough for Harry. He was breathing heavily, his hand going down to wrap his fingers in Draco’s soft golden hair and pulling. He felt Draco moan around his dick causing him to thrust his hips up.
Harry suddenly stilled, plastering a smile on his face. “That’s great Ron, truly,” he said as he covered his own wrist, hiding the zeros.
Draco let out a surprised noise, hand flying up to Harry’s locks. “What are you–” He was cut off as Harry started to suckle. The feeling wasn’t… intense to Draco, but it made him shudder with delight. It was almost relaxing. He closed his eyes as Harry flicked his tongue over his areolas, small whines escaping Draco’s lips.
When he finally did return, Malfoy was asleep, the only light coming from a nightlight in the corner. As he watched the other sleep for a moment, he wondered if things could be different. Just as he was about to walk away, Harry heard Malfoy start to shift and moan. When he looked back, Malfoy was trembling, tense as he gripped the bedsheets. Harry was going to let it blow over until Malfoy started crying. He had never seen him so vulnerable, and it made Harry feel… invasive.
Harry sighed and nodded, smiling at Neville, who looked guilty. “Don’t stress about this Neville,” Harry said to him softly, patting his shoulder. “I’ll manage.”
For all of you nerds, I'm aware that Lucius wasn't let out of Azkaban in the books but this is fanfiction and I can do what I please so! He's here and bitchin
The rest of the day was a blur, the only thing filling Harry’s mind was his missing numbers and his detention with Draco. Around seven o’clock, Harry knew he was never going to be able to relax. He had been jittery all day as he waited to hear back from Hermione, even though he knew it would take some time.  He went to the dungeons early to clean, in an attempt to get his mind off of things. On the plus side, if he got most of the work done he wouldn’t have to see Draco for as long. Harry was practically done when Draco arrived promptly at 8:30. A small part of him was pleased with the surprised look on the other’s face.
Harry walked through the silent halls to McGonagall's office. He knew he was in for a real beating, but he honestly didn’t care. He was already stuck with Malfoy in his classes and in his room. It couldn't get any worse than this. He paused outside McGonagall's office, acknowledging the stairwell with a sigh. He lifted his hand to grab the guard rail and stopped dead in his tracks. He checked once, then twice. He turned his arm, checking the other wrist as well. He repeated that twice as well, just to make sure he wasn’t nuts.
“Why would I know?” he retorted and shoved her wand away, his face full of confusion. “Last I saw Malfoy, he was going to sleep in the common room.”
Harry literally could not think; too many things were happening at once. Malfoy was awake, his numbers were at zero, meaning only one thing, and Draco Malfoy
Even though Malfoy’s words were harsh, they didn’t have the usual bite to them. Instead, he just sounded so tired. Harry sighed and left the other to grovel as he tried to sleep himself.
“Why don’t you ask Draco?” Harry huffed, getting up and excusing himself to the bathroom, slamming that door as well.
Shout out to conspiracycoven for a very lovely comment that motivated me to finish this chapter. Enjoy!
“Absolutely no arguments Harry, I’ve had enough of this. You and Draco will make peace. Now…” She paused to sigh once again, “show me that arm.”
Harry stood speechless for a moment before thanking the other, bowing his head. “Sorry, and thank you,” he said as he watched the three centaurs disappear into the night.
“For now,” Draco laughed. He propped himself up on his elbows as he looked down at Harry. His tousled hair usually bothered Draco, but in this moment it only turned him on.
But that was the only evidence Harry saw of Malfoy all day. They didn’t have potions, so Harry didn’t see him then. Even in the Great Hall, there was no trace of his platinum blonde hair. He knew Malfoy wanted to avoid him, but he didn’t know why.
It was quickly wiped off his face as Harry slowly started to move his hand up and down, starting from the base and moving all the way to the tip.
Harry didn’t have time to hide as Lucius Malfoy materialized in the entryway, gazing down at Harry with a most unpleasant look. It shook him to his core. Lucius was supposed to be an Azkaban, not here. So how did he—?
Draco looked at the hands in his lap, trying to form an answer. He clearly had a hard time admitting to himself (or anyone else) how he felt.
It wasn’t until he reached the doors of the infirmary did Harry realize how much he was really thinking about Malfoy. Ever since he had gone missing, Harry just couldn’t stop. As he pushed open the doors, he heard someone crying.
Draco nodded, biting his lips as he kept his gaze away from Harry. It wasn’t embarrassing, but he was so vulnerable like this. Of course it was Harry fucking Potter who had made him a mess. And it didn’t hurt when he felt three fingers inside of him, but he didn’t know if it felt good either. He heard himself let out a gasp which melted into a moan, eyes fluttering. A hand grabbed his chin, Harry’s hand– Merlin he was out of it, and tilted it up. His green eyes bore into him, making him want to squirm away.
It wasn’t until Harry pulled away that it registered with him— he had kissed Malfoy. He realized Malfoy’s lips were soft, he realized Malfoy had kissed back, and he also realized that Malfoy was definitely upset.
“Actually, it’s usually like this,” Harry responded. Now that he thought about it, everything he did was a mess.
“Are you going to be a while?” Harry asked, setting his book down on the table. As he turned to Pansy, he noticed Blaise and Malfoy whispering to each other. Harry could pick up on his dormmate’s harsh, almost shrill tone.
“While I know we’ve had our differences in the past, Potter, I really thought you were above practical jokes,” Malfoy said as he set his books down and took off his robe.
Ron continued to ramble, listing all the things he wants his soulmate to have. Harry, on the other hand, started to unpack. They had their first classes in an hour and he didn’t want to think about the numbers in his wrists. They’d been zeros since the day he was born.
He flipped Draco on his back, the other flushed. Harry closed his eyes as he tried to remember the incantation, whispering it under his breath. He assumed it worked when he heard Draco cry out in surprise under him.
“Don’t complain, I’m sure you like it,” Harry teased, giving him a quick kiss on the head. The two were tucked against each other as Draco shifted so that they were spooning. Harry’s arm was under the other’s head, his nose pressed into Draco’s hair as he started to close his eyes.
The other pulled away quickly, standing up, and almost falling, and covering his mouth this hand. Wide eyes met Harry’s.
But Harry wanted Draco to finish, he wanted to see him finish. His one hand sped up and the other pinned Draco’s hip down against the bed.
A bit of food lifted from Draco’s plate and splattered onto his face, causing his smile to drop. “Harry Potter! Enough of your antics.”
“Fuck you too…” Harry whispered as he watched Malfoy’s slim figure storm away. He was starting to doubt his ability to survive this year.
Harry grabbed his wrist gently, turning him. “Let me make it up to you?” He asked. Without waiting for a response, his hand came up to wipe the bit of food off his cheek. He licked it off his fingers, causing Draco to roll his eyes.
As Draco went to wipe the mashed potatoes off his face, he felt more hit his nose, making him huff in annoyance. Draco sat up quickly, pushing his chair back as he went to gather his things.
Harry swallowed thickly and offered him a crooked smile. Draco, who didn’t exactly ignore him, only gave him a tilt of his head before going to his trunk to pull out what he needed for the day.
“Malfoy- Draco, what are you doing?” he whispered and grabbed his wrist to look at the damage, not letting him pull away. He didn’t know how long Draco had been scrubbing, but probably for a while by the amount of blood on his arm. Clear as day, Harry could see the outline of Draco’s dark much, even under the blood. He was trying to scrub off his dark mark.
Draco gawked, his hand flying up to his neck with a red face. “Harry!” he shouted after him as the brunette took off, unable to hide his laugh. Really, Draco was too easy to mess with.
Draco wrapped his lips around the tip of Harry’s dick, already feeling his hips twitch. He started off slow, his mouth sliding down to fit as much as he could in his mouth. Of course Harry’s dick had to be big. He could only fit half before he felt the tip hit the back of his throat.
“I brought you a plate,” Harry said as he walked over to where Draco had seated himself. He was currently working on his own side potion project.
Harry’s eyes narrowed as Pansy and Blaise stepped into the room. “Erm- Malfoy,” Harry started, standing up.
Harry shook his head, rubbing temples. “I really don’t know anything,” he said as he tried to wrack his brain for answers. “I—” he tried to think, replaying the day’s events in his head. “The only meaningful thing I can think of is that there were some sixth years,” he said, remembering breakfast. “They were talking about their trip to the Forbidden Forest last night. That’s all I have.” Harry said, his voice tight. If that was where Draco was, then they had to find him fast.
Blaise stood up quickly, clearing his throat. “I'm taking my leave. Could you just uh, snog each other already? I can feel Harry staring at me,” Blaise said to Draco and left swiftly.
“Where are you going, Harry?” Hermione asked as she jumped in front of him, blocking his path. “You’ve been distant for days and now you’re not even staying to eat!”
Harry was growing a little needy, so he pulled Draco forward and kissed him. His lips were always soft as they brushed against Harry’s own. Insead of pulling away like he usually did, he pulled Draco deeper. Harry’s hands came up to wrap his fingers in the others’ hair and tugged only slightly.
Harry’s eyes snapped up, his heart racing at a million miles an hour. He opened his mouth, but couldn’t talk. He tried desperately to say something to him, anything at all, but his mouth refused to cooperate. So he stared in awe. And fear. And joy.
Harry paused for a moment, scanning the room. He tried not to think too hard about what would happen if they couldn’t find Malfoy, or if they did find Malfoy and he wasn’t alive. Well, even if they did find him, he knew that Malfoy would find something to complain about. Harry grabbed a fresh robe from the other’s things and left the dorm wing, heading to the edge of the forest.
“What in Merlin’s name are you wearing?” Draco interrupted him, suddenly regaining his composure and narrowing his eyes.
Harry’s mouth dropped; from awe or annoyance, he didn’t know. When he finally gained his composure and looked at the recipe, he noticed that Malfoy was on step five. Step six was to stir. He could do that.
How often did Malfoy wank, anyway? Harry had never heard him until now, so he must have done it when he was asleep, or maybe when he wasn’t there. And what did he wank to? He didn’t see any material in their dorm, so… before Harry could think about it anymore, he fell asleep.
She didn’t say anything else after that. Harry, feeling as dejected as ever, decided to go out for a walk around the grounds. He knew that Malfoy was still up in the dorm, and he didn’t feel like being berated by Pansy or Blaise or Malfoy.
Crabbe and Goyle were giggling, Draco next to them. “Whoops, sorry Potty” Crabbe snickered and knocked into him again, walking past with Goyle.
“Madam Pomfrey, Draco’s had an accident,” he said and quickly brought her over to where the other was sleeping and showed her his arm. Harry wouldn’t tell her the truth, he didn’t want to embarrass Draco.
Malfoy snarled, brushing himself off as he stood up. “Really, Potter? I knew you were clumsy, but come on. How do you manage on your own?” Draco said coldly, his eyes narrowing as he stared down on Harry.
Harry was still holding his arm as he tried to wrap it in one of the sheets. It was the best he could do; he had never been good at healing magic.
It wasn’t until potions when Harry’s alarms were really raised. Malfoy didn’t show up. After class, the first place Harry looked was the hospital wing, but Madam Pomfrey informed Harry that Malfoy hadn’t come in today. And when Harry checked back in their dorm at lunch, no one was there either. As he walked back to the Great Hall, dumbfounded, Pansy cornered him.
Breakfast ended and it was off to potions with Ron. The halls were emptier than Harry was used to. Sure, it could be worse, at least parents were still sending their kids to Hogwarts. But even so… not everyone that was missing was because of their parents. Some would never come back.
The rest of the day was uneventful for Harry, going from class to class and seeing all his professors once again. As it was now the end of the day, Harry went to go get settled into his bunk with Ron. Instead, he was greeted by Neville at the door.
Harry cleared his throat as a hand rested on Malfoy’s shoulders. “You should probably lie down…” Harry whispered, finally managing to speak.
Could Draco tell Harry what was going on? Not everything, maybe not ever. Draco let out a long sigh, setting down his things as he closed his eyes.
Harry opened and closed his mouth, wanting to say more, but relented and left the Headmistress’s office. As he walked back to class, he was sucked into his own thoughts once again.
Harry decided he wanted to speak with Professor McGonagall. It was almost curfew so Harry tried to walk quickly, wanting to find out more about his arm. He started to ascend the staircase but suddenly stopped near the top, catching fragments of a heated conversation. He could make out the Headmistress’s voice, as well as that of a rather angry man.
“I’m just pulling the webs from your hair--stop moving,” Harry said, frowning. Why did it always have to be this difficult?
“You don’t know, Potter, you don’t know! I- this is why I will be shamed for the rest of my life. You are so perfect, perfect Potter, you couldn’t do anything wrong even if you tried!”
He reached down and touched Malfoy’s shoulder, shaking him gently to wake him up. Malfoy shot up with a start, eyes snapping open as he gasped.
While tensions disappeared between Harry and Draco, the rest of the school was still buzzing. Draco’s sexuality had been the hot topic on everyone's mind. The fourth-year who had spotted the two kissing didn’t recognize who Draco was snogging, only able to tell it was a man. Most of the students wanted to know who the mystery boy was, and there had been all sorts of speculation. To try and avoid as much attention as possible, Draco was having lunch in Professor Slughorn’s office. Harry joined him some days to keep him company when Blaise and Pansy weren’t there.
“What a miracle…” Draco muttered under his breath, grabbing the rue. “Fine. You can stir,” Draco smirked, “But you have to stir for the next two hours. Otherwise, the recipe will fail.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Oh please. It’s shiny and yellow, just like the picture. Now, do you want me to say incantation or would you like to?” He asked, pulling out his wand again.
“Oh, grow up,” Draco said, cleaning up the chessboard. “Didn’t know ‘the boy who lived’ got jealous.”
“Who do you think she is Harry? Will she be beautiful? Do I already know her? What if it’s Hermione!?”
“Erm- well yes, I was. I can do this myself, Malfoy, let it be” Harry responded. He gripped the vials tightly. He could give them to Slughorn.
Harry’s reached down and rubbed a thumb over where his own numbers used to be, his heart clenching. It couldn’t be true because Harry had no soulmate, he never had. Only…
“Stop, Potter!” He whined as he tried to push him away, smack his arm. He wasn’t in the mood to be overstimulated.
A knock came from McGonagall’s door. She looked up and adjusted her glasses. There was a time when she didn’t have to worry about students knocking on her door every hour of the day. That was before Harry Potter came along, and now her days were never filled with boredom.
Ron’s face popped up from behind Neville, flashing Harry a smile as well. “Hey mate. Neville here needed a room and I knew you could get any roommate you wanted, so I offered to bunk with him instead. I hope it’s okay cause I already said yes. We got you all your things though.”
She was right, Hermione always was. So Harry went back up to his dorm and tried to sleep, trying to not think of Malfoy as much as he was.
“I don’t really think that’s an option. This is also my room,” Harry said, frowning. “Why did you have to run off, anyway?”
“Yes, well, you pushed me. So I’d say we’re even,” he sniped back, turning his back towards the other and heading inside the classroom.
He rubbed the sleep from his eyes and stuck on his glasses. Harry realized he probably looked like a mess and quickly tried to fix his hair and throw on something other than boxers and a t-shirt. Draco popped out of the bathroom right as he finished. His hair was still damp and he was wearing slacks and a white button-up. Oh, right, it was Saturday.
“There’s the Draco I know,” Harry laughed, kissing him once more and helping Draco clean up. Harry peppered kisses all along his skin as they got ready for bed; he just couldn’t get enough.
Blaise seemed to pick this up and grabbed Pansy’s hand. “We’ll see you tomorrow, then. Now that we know you’re okay, we’ll be fine.”
“I think Malfoy was taken to the Forbidden Forest by some sixth years, as a prank maybe. He’s fine, prickly as usual. But Hermione, that's not what I’m worried about. Actually,” Harry sighed again, trying to come to terms with this information himself. “Hermione, Malfoy’s my soulmate…. I think.”
“Nonsense,” Draco said quickly, turning to face Blaise as they continued their chess game. “You’re more than welcome to stay as long as you like.”
Harry found Hermione easily; she was in her dorm. Now came the trick of calming her down and answering all of her questions. As Hermione had said, ‘you woke me up Harry so now you’re going to answer my questions whether you like it or not’.
Draco finally pulled away, needing to breathe. He gasped as he pulled off, his lips shimmering with spit and precum. He would be annoyed with Harry if he didn’t pull him up to kiss so fast. Draco melted, their lips pressing together.
“I have too many questions and not enough energy, but one thing I'm always certain of is that you’re never where you’re supposed to be, Potter,” Malfoy said softly, meeting Harry’s eyes for a moment. “I'm assuming you found me?”
Draco and Harry scrambled away from each other as Draco threw his pants on, trying to look presentable as he pushed his hair back with his hands. Harry, on the other hand, quickly shut himself in the bathroom, heart pounding.
"Yeah," Ron grunted as he looked at the potion that Madam Pomfrey held. He took it and with a sigh, he quickly downed it in one go. Shuddering as he handed the empty flask over to her.
Sirius nodded, “Right,” he sighed as he headed for the stairs. He could hear the ghoul acting out in the attic, but paid it no mind as he knocked on Ron’s door.
Harry stopped and hovered as he then nodded, “Okay!” he yelled back, diving towards them and coming to a halt a few feet from them. Jumping off the broom he waited for Ron to join him on the ground.
“Come on,” Ron said with a frown, spotting his sister waiting for them, “We should get it over with. I’ll try and get us to my room,” he suggested, “we’ll eat in there.”
“I’m sorry, Harry,” Was the first thing past his lips, “but, can we talk, alone, I really want to explain a few things to you.”
“Sirius,” Narcissa called to her cousin, “he’s fine, listen to what he says. He didn’t touch it and Draco was able to hold him away from it and get him away from the influence of the locket.” She reassured him.
Harry nodded, “yeah, I think he did, he even made sure that I was okay when we were done,” he added.
“Working on that at the moment, thinking about talking to the Goblins more as to see if they have a method of doing so,” he sighed softly, “I’ve got it locked away at the moment, though I’ve found another one, or rather one has already been destroyed.”
“Actually. Draco is here,” he said, wincing a little, as the look on Ron's face dropped, “before you say anything,” he began, “I’ve been working on my runes and was finding it difficult about the sets that we have to remember. Draco came in, he… he showed me a really easy way to learn it. I was wondering if you want to come over and we can both get a little extra help, he’s done all this recently, so he might know a better way to learn,” he explained quickly, not wanting to take the chance of losing Ron before he heard him out.
"Of course, I don't mind talking about them at all," Remus smiled at him, as he thought back trying to figure out which story of the many he had that he should tell first. he opened his eyes, "Right," he began, "I'll tell you of the time that your mother, Lily was able to get your Father to dance in a clown suit in the Great Hall," he said as he started to tell the tale as the train continued to fill up.
Harry grinned, "Okay, Remus," he glanced around a bit, and took a breath, as though he was trying to gather his courage, "Would... would you be able to tell me a little of what school was like when you were there with my Dad?" he asked quickly, almost rushing the words out, afraid of how the older wizard would respond.
“Don’t worry, I heard enough,” Sirius said, shaking his head a little, “Ron needs a rain check,” he muttered.
“Well… he can prove himself to me. I know what Regulus and I were like when we were kids, and it wasn’t pretty,” he snorted, thinking of all the things that Kreacher and the other house-elves had found in their rooms when they cleaned it out.
Sirius sighed and closed his eyes. “Right,” he murmured, “I need to talk to Molly,” he added getting up and heading out of the room.
“Having to overcome your prejudice against a whole house of people that you've been conditioned to hate because of the symbol and what people thought they represent,” Sirius nodded, “I know that, and I really understand it. I felt the same while I was at school, anyone that was in Slytherin was automatically in my bad books and I hated them. It wasn’t until afterwards that I realised it doesn’t mean shit,” he said, getting a small smile out of Ron with the curse word.
“I know that, but I know that being friends with me can cause you problems, So I'm sorry about that,” he told him, shaking his head.
Ron winced at the honesty his friend was speaking. He hated the fact that his mother and Ginny were always trying to push him away from his best friend all the time. He thought with being away from the Burrow, he would be able to leave those worries behind.
“I’m just wondering why you were getting things wrong when I know you knew the answers,” Remus puzzled, he had noticed it on a number of essays that Harry had given in. And when marking the exams he had put down the answers that had been from the essay and not what he had talked about before.
Harry couldn’t help the little snort at the last bit. But he stood up and went to Sirius, “he is raising me the way my parents wanted,” he told her.
"Thank you for telling me," Sirius said, a tight smile on his face. "I should send her a letter, it has been a while since I was able to talk with Cissa," he sighed as he let Harry go.
Harry was almost in a trance as he walked towards it. He didn’t even notice when the door to the room opened. A hand was reaching out towards a locket that was sitting innocently on the shelf, it was calling to Harry, to come and get it, take it and wear it. Open it. He heard a muffled yell of his name, but it was like he couldn’t answer it, like his body knew it was on a certain course and it couldn’t change. Arms went around his waist before he could touch it. He struggled in the grasp for a moment before the trance-like state he had been in broke and he found himself in the arms of someone that was shaking badly.
Arthur glanced towards the house, “Surely Albus would have seen this as well?” he asked, wondering if the older wizard would have done, but already the doubt was in his mind.
Ron nodded and left the room, heading down to the floo room. He walked in and waited. It didn't take that long for the connection to come up. Accepting the floo connection Draco was soon stepping through, “Hey,” Ron said she began to head out of the room again.
"Very well, and Albus, you made a mistake when you sent him there," was all Snape said as he then left the office.
“Cousin Sirius said that you were changing subjects,” he mentioned, hovering near the door, unsure of what he should do. There was only one chair in the room, and he didn’t want to be rude and sit on the bed.
"Sirius, please!" Pettigrew begged, as he looked at Harry and then turned to Ron, "wasn't I good pet Ron, wasn't I?" he begged him.
Sirius quickly explained what they found. And Remus looked up from where he had been standing and looking through Ron’s own essay.
Draco walked over and looked over Harry's shoulder, “oh, I know this,” he said with a smile, “want a bit of help? The book really doesn’t explain it right on how to put them together. It just assumes that you already know,” he said as he leaned over and took up a pen, looking at it, “This a pen?” he asked.
Narcissa went closer, “It feels deadly,” she said quietly, “Like it would harm the very soul of the person who touched it. But there is something else around it,” she added as she refused to even touch it.
Remus put up only a token protest when he saw Harry grinning and nodding in agreement, “I know when I’m beat,” he muttered as they finished their breakfast amid laughter and jokes, hoping to cheer Harry up and distract him from any pain he was feeling.
Remus snorted and rolled his eyes, “Not what I wanted to change Sirius,” he muttered as he left the room with Harry. “Don’t forget, if you’re going exploring to be very careful, and keep your wand on you at all times. Don’t touch anything, and any door with a red mark you do not touch as the room is cursed.”
Sirius smiled softly “I’m fine, just didn’t think I would find out that there was… another of those things floating around. It just makes me curious about it,” he murmured, more to himself. Shaking his head, “Why don’t you two go and have a bit of fun. Ginny’s in her room at the moment. And I’m here to play buffer,” he added, seeing Harry's worried look towards the Burrow.
“We’re going flying, come on,” George said as the two of them grabbed his arms, and even though he was protesting, walked out of the kitchen and into the garden with him.
Harry glanced from where he was watching Pomfrey take care of Ron and then up at the wizard. "Yeah," he murmured, though in truth he still didn't know what to feel about it all. He never really knew what had happened to his parents, as to how they had come under suspicion of Voldemort and how they had been found. He now knew the truth of that night, as far as he could tell.
Hope you are enjoying things. This is the last of the pre-edited chapters. But I shall be doing my all to keep on track with posting!
“Oh?” Harry murmured as Sirius sat down on Ron’s bed. His friend, going over next to him to sit down.
Harry nodded in agreement, as Sirius and Remus then sat the two boys down going over what they would need to know to catch up in Arithmancy and Runes.
“Thanks, Neville,” he smiled at him, “I know he was a bastard, to all of us, but he has changed, and it's a good change as well.”
"The Wizengamot finds Sirius Black Not Guilty of All Charges, on the Charge of Escaping from Azkaban, that has been dropped in light that Sirius Black had never been charged or found guilty by a court of Law before being sent to Azkaban," Madam Bones called out, "Sirius Black, compensation will be given to you in light of what you have gone through. Healers at St Mungo's are going to help you free of charge for all that has happened. Sirius Black, my sincere apologies for what you have been through."
"No, I get it," Ron nodded, "If it was someone else, you most likely wouldn't have gone," Ron nodded with a heavy sigh. A pit of something in his stomach, weighing it down.
"I didn't kill them, I would never, they were my friends, my very best friends, my family!" Sirius protested, almost screaming the words out as he glared at Snape.
“Okay, Kreacher, I’ll do it for you. I’m going to have to take with the Goblins about it, they might be able to shed some light on how to destroy such things,” Sirius shuddered as he glanced to where Draco and Harry were still on the floor, “Draco, can you take Harry out of the room, I don't want him in here. Looks like he might be susceptible to the magic in this,” he muttered.
How was your weekend? I hope it was good and relaxing. And I hope that your week has gotten off to a great start!
“Anyway, want to see some of the answers we came up with?” he asked, glad that he had a change of topic at hand.
“I will, and I’m still so sorry. Once I started I didn’t know how to stop. And it was always nice to be needed. No one else wanted that of me and I… I liked being looked up to,” she said, trying to defend herself once more.
“No,” Ron said, standing up to her, “Mum, we’re trying to work, I don't care what you want, I’m doing this,” he added.
“Yeah,” Harry grinned as he put down the small basket and began to get out the food that Kreacher had packed for them. As soon as Sirius had said he would be carrying out Regulus’ last request, the elf had started treating them a lot nicer. Though there were still moments when he was a little nasty, especially towards Remus, he a lot better behaved now.
"That's great!" Ron almost yelled, as he quickly took a bite of the bacon sandwich he had put together.
"Yeah," he crowed quietly, "I never have to be near them, I'm so happy about that. No more Dursley's."
Molly just sniffed and turned back to Sirius, “You… telling him that Slytherins are fine when you were the opposite while at school.” She added, poking him in the chest, “how can you change like that… how could you think of them as being… being-”
"Oh, Harry, I really don't know if you should go," Molly murmured, giving Sirius another look of distrust.
Albus paused, he was right, "I will tell you during the holidays when you're settled with Sirius." He has promised this time.
“Right, so we have another, let's try and get an appointment with the goblins in a few days to see if we can get to it,” Sirius said as he heard some loud laughter coming from upstairs.
“Well, Harry I know both James and Lily took Arithmancy and Runes, you can choose one or both of those. If you want, you can continue Care of Magical Creatures, but unless you’re going for a job that needs it, you don’t need to take it as the creatures that you need to pay attention to will turn up in other subjects,” Sirius said, turning to Harry.
"Language, honestly, Ron, you can be such a... a, ugh," she muttered, not even able to think of a word to call her friend.
As soon as Harry heard the voice, he stopped and looked down. Diving to the ground, he jumped off the broom as he levelled out, running a little to slow down his momentum. “Yeah?” he asked, sounding a little eager to talk to his friend.
What if It was Draco’s baby? He knew it was very unlikely, but that hope is what kept him alive. After they found out Harry was pregnant, they made the plan to escape. The day before the plan was set into action, Harry had told Draco he loved him in words that Harry would soon repeat. Made him obliviate him with the promise to not tell him anything. He also couldn’t allow Harry to get rid of Lily. Draco hated that plan too, but said yes anyway.
Snape immediately had Harry move the girl to a chair where Snape began to look her over. “Dani, my name is Severus Snape. I adopted Harry when he was fourteen. I know what his life was like at your home due to his magic. I understand you don’t know me but I need to ask you some questions. Ok?” The little girl looked at Harry who nodded and smiled.
“Ginny, you have nothing to be sorry for. As I said, you are not the one who hurt me. I can’t forgive Ron, but I don’t hold you accountable. You are still a good friend. You are always welcome with me.”
“I think it might just be my favorite.” Aries leaned down and licked Draco’s earlobe. Draco’s head shot up and just as he was about to question it, the bell sounded for their next class.
Caelum Sirius and Emily Narcissa Malfoy-Potter. Lily loved being a big sister and helped every way she could. Even if it was just feeding her crup named Prongs. Harry didn’t know why she named him that, having never heard it, but he loved it anyway.
The other three left the room to give them some privacy. After a few minutes Draco laid down next to Harry. Harry soon drifted off in Draco’s arms.
Snape stood there, mouth agape. Next thing Harry knew he was being wrapped in his father’s long arms.
Draco pulls out his fingers and Harry whimpers at the empty feeling. He coats his own dick in the lube, knowing how sensitive Harry is. Tom Riddle had done a number on him. It had taken them almost a year to work up to having sex and several failed attepts to find what worked with Harry’s injured system.
Draco’s mouth was opened slightly, just enough to let air come in and out. His eyelashes were stark black and made an interesting comparison to his pale skin tone. One thing Harry never noticed was that Draco had freckles. Several light spots decorated the bridge of his nose and cheeks. He realized how beautiful Draco was.
“Yeah right. We were looking for Harry. You know, the guy that’s going to kill your precious Dark Lord?” Ron replied.
“What are you two of you doing here? Remus and the others said Harry is here. We want to see him. Ready to take him back to You-Know-Who when we leave?” Ron said.
“Oh, right. I didn’t tell you my last name did I? Aries Snape. Can’t say I am pleased to meet you. Now as I said, get lost.” Aries was cool and calm in a very scary way. He looked almost exactly like his mother then.
“It was fine mostly. Ron showed up and caused problems. I dealt with him though. I did mess with Draco a bit.” Aries proceeded to tell Snape about then train and dinner until curfew. At eleven Aries was sent back to Slytherin.
“Well, I will start harvesting scales, venom, teeth, and, well, everything. They are going to make very good potion ingredients. Aries, you and Draco, go see if you can find the side chamber that Tom spoke of.” Snape was immediately lost in fascination with harvesting.
Harry’s eyes crack open, but immediately snap closed. The lights cause his head to flair in pain. He grimaced in pain.
“Harry, all my feelings went out the window with what he just said. You were my friend first. I wasn’t kidding when I said, I am here for you. Plus, have you seen his freckled arse? I don’t want to see that for the rest of my life anyway. I told my parents I am spending the rest of the break at the castle and that is what I intend to do. I still don’t trust Snape and Malfoy all that much, so I need them to prove I should trust them.” Harry knew there was no sense talking her out of it.
“Severus, please tell Albus he cannot send Harry back to the Dursleys.” She replied with a broken tone. She walked over to Harry who had panic all over his face. “Don’t worry Harry, you aren’t going anywhere.”
“Ron, you will play with Ginny. And you as well, Harry. Work can wait,” she tried once more to demand what they do.
Harry just gave a non-committal nod. As he knew he would be following Ron with this. He knew the wizarding world better than he did. "We should hurry and finish our breakfast, the coaches are going to be leaving soon," he murmured.
“Hello, Hermione dear, the boys are at the table,” she said, gesturing to the two who were still working hard.
Snape led the way to the hospital wing first. Pettigrew was still floating behind him as he snapped out, "Granger, open the doors!"
“To… learn from him?!” Ron explained, there was anger in his voice, but Harry could detect the hurt in there as well.
“They were, it’s only been in the last 100 that they have sided with light,” Narcissa nodded, she remembered her lessons on the families better.
Ron jumped up and helped the witch with her trunk before he and Harry got theirs down as well. "Mum should be waiting," he murmured, wishing that it would be his Dad for once. His mother had a tendency to embarrass them all with her actions and cooing she would do when she saw them all.
Harry watched her a little, seeing the distrust in her eyes when she was looking at Sirius, "I'm fine, going to enjoy living with Sirius," he grinned widely as Remus, Hermione and Ron caught up with him.
“I told you that I don't think that would happen. You go and be all chummy with him. I told you that I don't want to be part of this at all. I would let you be with it. But don't talk to me about him. I… I can't stand him, he’s… he just…” he paused for a breath.
Harry grinned as the floo lit up once more. Since the day that Harry had gone from the Burrow early, he hadn't been back there. He didn’t want to talk with Mrs Weasley at all. And Ron understood that. The last time his friend had been able to come over, Ginny had once again been sent with him. This time in another little dress, that showed far more leg than should be allowed on a twelve, almost thirteen years old. It wasn’t right in Harry’s eyes. He also wanted to tell Ron what had happened two days ago when Draco and Narcissa came over. The two teens had talked a lot more, and he had learned more about why Draco had been mean all the time.
We are getting through these chapters okay I think. Wondering if I should up the number of chapters per week to three. Hmmmm....
I kept my promise, I UPDATED TODAY!!! Lol, I'm in a good mood today, wrote over 8,000 words so far today, so pretty damn pleased with myself. And I also need to get my butt moving on editing this one, only have up to chapter 16 edited.... whoops. Lol.
“Right, it might be, they took down a number of wizards, most of them were Slytherin if I remember right. Two were Ravenclaw and one Hufflepuff,” he sighed softly and hugged Harry, “enjoyed your birthday?”
“Thank you for your help,” he nodded to him and then the three of them quickly left the office and headed to the floo to get back to Grimmauld. Sirius rushed past them all to the bedroom.
Ron looked at her, frowning even more with the behaviour that she was showing, “Ginny, can you just stop, you’re making Harry uncomfortable and that… that was really nasty,” he told her. Shaking his head at the way she was being. The little girl he had known was someone so completely different now.
Thank you so much for the awesome comments and kudos, love and adore you all. They have helped me a lot over the last few weeks. Snuggles to you all!!
“Yeah. I… I know that,” he nodded, “So what happened? I know they were to go over the day after I was last at Grimmauld.”
“You are getting so rude,” Molly told him off, “I can’t believe that Sirius Black is looking after you now. He is such an irresponsible man, you need a firm hand because of him,” she added.
“Oh, and what could he possibly help you with?” Hermione almost yelled as her hands went to her hips.
"Now, let's go," Sirius said as he gestured to the floo, "I need to have a word with your mother about uninvited guests.
Hope your week has started off well!!! Sorry for not updating yesterday, was having a really bad day. So a day late, but it's here!!!
“I know what it's like to not have anything Ron, you forget sometimes, that I lived with the Dursleys nearly all my life. I never had a Christmas present until your mother sent me that jumper. It was the first time I got something, something that had a little meaning to it other than being spiteful,” Harry told him, “I know what it's like to get nothing but hand me downs, I had Dudley’s all the time. Tucked in and sewn up so they would fit better, and that was only until I was able to sew for myself did something actually fit me a little, before then I was dressed in clothes five times too big. I know how to do things the muggle way, to make sure I look at least a little presentable. The clothes you found me in were Dudley’s that I have sewn to fit me a little better,” he added, feeling a little ashamed of how he had dressed back then. It was only before third year he had been able to actually get some clothes that fit him. Before then, he had been made to keep to certain places.
“That's good, thank you, I’m going to start looking more into Voldemort's past, to see if I can find anything more about what he could have used,” Albus said softly.
"Kreacher, he belongs to the Black family. He isn't too friendly to us. Doesn't like the fact that I turned my back on most of the family when I left," Sirius answered with a shrug, "If you give him an order he might follow it, I tend to just let him do as he needs to keep the place tidy and I'll deal with food. No doubt he'd try and poison it," he muttered darkly, glaring at the elf back.
“We need to think if he would have made any more,” Albus murmured, already thinking when they could be hidden if there were more out there. He looked at his cup and quickly waved his wand to fix it, pouring himself some more tea.
"Yes, it was, the end of the war when you were a baby was a dangerous time. There were still those out there that believed in Voldemort, as you know," he answered, "There were many that wanted to take you in, and I didn't know who I should trust. So I went with the only thing I knew would be able to protect you fully. When your mother died, she did something that protected you, a protective layer that I used when I took you to your aunts. I made sure that they anchored there. When you leave them, they will disappear, but they have done the job I wanted, and that was to protect you until someone I knew would really take your happiness into their heart," he smiled.
“I don't mind helping him as well,” Draco said, a little hesitant, “I know that there is some bad blood between the Malfoy family and the Weasley family, but…”
“Right, I’ll… I’ll take her to St Mungo's. Hopefully, they’ll be able to tell us if that thing is still hurting her,” Arthur said, not wanting to take a chance that Ginny could be hurting and not do anything.
“Why would we? It was over and all it would have done was to make Ginny feel different and off with everything. It was best that we put an end to it,” she said, shaking her head.
"I will have a trial set up for you as soon as I can. I ask that you hand yourself into me, and me alone, and I will see that you are kept safe and well until your trial," she advised him, stunning Pettigrew as he started to become aware of himself again.
“You forget Hermione that we once trusted you to help us and you sunk that trust,” Harry reminded her, voice going cold, “He’s helped me with my work, with learning runes and arithmancy. Has also been helping Ron, and before you even suggest that he has been sabotaging our learning,” he paused for a moment when Ron cut in.
“No, she and Mum are away for the day. So, Percy said it was fine for me to come on my own,” he grinned widely as the two then headed to Harry’s room.
“Thank you,” Sirius said, taking the cup and saucer, “right well in Grimmauld Place, Harry came across a dark artefact that I’ve had the goblins look at. It’s Slytherin's locket, the original.”
The two laughed as they carried on reading through them, “These are brilliant, I should tell those that take divination to do the same,” he snickered, having to lean on Harry as he laughed.
“Hey,” Harry nodded to her, the smile dropping from his face. He hadn’t wanted to let her come, but he was trying to give her a bit of a chance at getting back their friendship.
"Well, Mr Weasley," Pomfrey said as she stood up, "You'll be right as rain in no time," she told him as she finished her examination.
Sirius looked up and answered, “I don’t know until I read them,” he said as he split the pile and handed some over to Remus, “here, you can check a few as well.”
Harry stopped what he was doing and left his room. He went down the stairs, jumping over the last three as he wandered towards the living room. “Yeah?” he asked, a little puzzled as to why he had been called.
"You will have to learn how to deal with the press at one point Potter," Snape said as they made their way to their seats in the courtroom. They were both going to be called up as witnesses for both Pettigrew and Sirius.
Harry looked up, “Hermione’s a bitch,” was all he stated as Ron blinked and went over to his friend.
“They didn’t, or rather, Molly stopped them from taking her. I have already talked to Arthur about it and he's going to take Ginny to see someone.” Sirius said, reassuring him that something was already being done.
It didn’t take long until the two teenagers were flying in the air around the Burrow, with Ron practising against the goals that the older Weasley children had added some years ago to play some pickup games. The two were having a lot of fun, though almost an hour later, they saw Ginny hanging around the garden, watching them as they flew around. Harry shuddered a little, he really didn’t want to land, though Kreacher had made them both a lunch to have when they did so.
“Harry,” she gasped, grabbing his arm to stop him, “he is going to hurt you, he will. That's who he is.”
“I know,” Harry said as he then went to the drawing-room. He walked inside and over by a chair was a side table with the books that he wanted to read. They were about the families in the wizarding world, something that Sirius wanted Harry to learn. Though it was mainly so it would inform him about why some people acted weirdly around him now that it was known that he was under Sirius care. Something like Draco happening again. There were a number of families that were linked to the Blacks enough to mean something.
Sirius let him go and then looked at Snape, "Snape, thank you," he said, holding out a hand to the wizard, "I know I was a right bastard to you when we were at school, and I have no reason to give, all I can do is apologise, and I am sorry for everything I did."
“The House of Black is a mess. My mother did a lot of damage to it. But I’m starting to get it all in order. Might take me a while, but I will have a house I can be proud of once more,” he answered, “Thankfully, Narcissa is still the same woman I remember, she just had no choice but to kowtow the Malfoy line since my mother wouldn’t back her up. And with no one there that she could turn to, Draco didn’t have a choice as well,” he sighed softly, “There are so many things that are messed up,” he muttered.
“I agree with Harry,” Ron said as Hermione turned to him, “I need time to think about it, to know what I feel about all this. As he said, you betrayed us. We trusted you to help us with something we thought we were struggling with. My spelling and the words I use get mixed up, and I asked you to help me and you turned that against me. My grades were so low in my first year, that if I hadn't done well on my exam particles, then I would have failed my first year, you… you were responsible for that. Because of all the false information you gave me and stupid me that should know better, believed it,” he said, berating not only Hermione but himself for believing in her. He was a wizard born, he should have known better.
“Thanks,” Sirius smiled to him, Harry didn’t smile back, just went back to the sofa and sat down. It didn’t take him long to see that he had been right, “Before you became friends, you were scoring high. I would say that you would have easily been second in Gryffindor, maybe in the top ten, or five in Hogwarts if you had continued.”
“I know, trust me, I know. Came across one in Grimmauld Place, enchanted Harry into trying to open it,” Sirius shuddered, “Draco was able to see what was going on and stopped him. I think he might know what they are as well, I’m hoping not. But there is always that possibility with Lucius as a father,” he muttered, not liking the thought of Draco being exposed to the information on Horcruxes.
“People?” Sirius suggested, “they are,” he sighed, “Molly, it took me until I finished school to learn we are all the bloody same,” he said, cursing lightly.
Thank you for all the wonderful comments and kudos. I really do hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well!!!
“Look, Hermione, he has been good,” Ron said, thinking of the one time that he had studied with Draco and Harry.
“Get her to talk to Albus, he now knows what caused the trouble, and he agrees that she needs to be seen too. Get him to tell her,” Sirius told him softly.
“You should be able to get it since you're Head of House Black, and there is no one for the Lestrange family, you could go in there to sort the account out as well,” she reminded him.
"You should take the time to learn about the Black Family. Your grandmother was a Black as well. She was sister to Sirius Black's grandfather," Malfoy explained to him a little more clearly, "a lot of the families of the wizarding world are connected in some way," he finished.
Sirius strode over, grabbing the rat, "Let's see then. If it's a common rat this won’t hurt a bit," he muttered as he set the rat down on the lopsided piano and took a quick step back. Shooting spell after spell at it, as the rat ran and dodged. Remus stepped away from Snape for a moment and joined in. Within seconds, they finally hit the rat as it tried to flee from the room.
"Hmm," Sirius hummed as he continued, "I would like to get to know you better, I know we've only just met. But you are my family, and I am yours."
“I will, but I need to know how it got here and who it once belonged to,” Sirius muttered as he called out, “Kreacher!”
"Right," Harry nodded, not truly understanding, but getting enough to at least hold any more questions.
"Yeah, have you got dinner started?" Fred piped up as he and George walked over behind their mother. They had heard some of the exchange as well and weren't happy with what the woman was insinuating.
Sorry for disappearing like that. Fatigue and then a cold knocked me out! But I am back and with a lovely chapter for you all! Hope you enjoy it!
"Severus, once again you have put your nose into things that you know nothing about," Remus huffed as he looked towards his colleague, "something more is going on and I am going to get to the bottom of it," he added, "Now kindly be quiet," he finished as he kept an eye on the man.
Ron nodded, “I’m sorry,” he muttered, “I just… I just see Harry doing something without me and it hurts. It's like I’m being left behind again.”
Thank you all for the amazing comments and kudos!!!! I love and adore you all. Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well!
Sirius gave a nod, “Right, I’ll talk to you soon about this problem,” he added as he then left the small cottage.
"But nothing, my parents hid to save me," Harry said, taking a step away from Ron and Hermione. The two reached out to stop him, but he pulled away, "I hear them, I remember the green light, I remember my Dad, telling my Mum to take me and run, that he would hold Voldemort off. Then Voldemort, telling my Mum to get out the way, but she refused. She stood between us so I could live. She begged not for her life but for mine. She screams when he kills her, but she still doesn't move aside. Instead, the green light hits her,” he finished, taking a shuddering breath. He had pieced it all together from each time he got near the Dementors.
"He's my godfather, of course, I'm going to go with him and live with him," Harry said, frowning at the woman.
“Ronald, you will do as I say!” she demanded, almost looking and sounding like a spoilt child when they weren’t getting their way.
“I know, but I still feel bad,” Sirius said as he opened the cage and a small spitfire of an owl darted from it and began to fly around the room, “sorry, was hoping he would calm down now that he was out of the store,” he sighed as the bird, dive-bombed Ron and Harry before grazing the top of their heads before flying around the room.
"Yes, I have no doubt Sirius will be able to tell you a lot about him. He was taken into your father's home after running away from his parents in his fifth year. Charlus was a good man, a very good man, he was a strong wizard and had a good head on his shoulders," he smiled, "I have no doubt that Sirius will tell you if you ask him."
"Don't mind if we join you, Professor?" Harry asked, a smile on his face as he saw tired amber eyes glance up at them.
“Welcome, and I’m… I’m glad that you're all right,” he smiled softly, as he sat down on the chair beside him.
“Mum,” the redhead sighed deeply, rolling his eyes and wondering what lies that his sister had told. Though it might not even be a lie.
“You should hang around me for a bit, Harry, I bet we can have a lot more fun than you would with Ron. He’s so boring, always thinking about food or quidditch,” Ginny said with a sneer, as she looked at her other brother.
"Come on, let's get ready to leave," Hermione said as she stood up, already reaching for the trunk that had appeared above her after they had settled into the compartment. She had already put Crookshanks into his carrier. The cat wasn't happy but knew he wasn't going to get out anytime soon.
“Bullshit!” Ron screamed, “bullshit, you did. You fucked with everything. If I hadn't forgotten some of the things you told us, I would have failed first-year outright, how is that not letting it go too far?” he asked, “How?”
Albus paled at the thought, “I didn’t even think it could be one of those. I didn’t think he would go that far…” he tried as his eyes widened in horror, “What about Miss Weasley, something like that influencing her for practically a whole year. It would have done some sort of damage to her mind. I don't know if she was checked out, I left it to the Weasleys to decide what to do.”
“It’s only been after she got back. When you saved her from that basilisk, well... She is so horrible now. She goes to everyone in the family that she was the one that you saved her, that it meant that you liked her and things like that all the time,” he huffed, pulling a face.
“Okay!” Sirius yelled, “games are up, go and have fun, and you can fly here, which is why we have a few extra brooms around, take your pick on what you want to do!” he added, clapping his hands to get everyone's attention.
Sorry for it being late, was supposed to post yesterday but I was busy melting in the heat. I do not do well in heat of any kind.
Sirius smiled as he watched. His godson was good in the air. Better than his father. The young, green-eyed wizard dived a couple of times, easily pulling out and skimming the ground a few times. Sirius' heart ended up in his throat a number of times as he watched.
“You dare tell Ginny who she can be friends with. You might not want to share Harry, but that doesn’t mean he can't have any other friends.”
“I know you would have,” Sirius reassured him, “Though I do want to ask why you chose divination?” he puzzled, he had noticed his godson had chosen something so woolly and wouldn’t really help him in any type of career in the wizarding world.
Harry grinned as he threw another garden gnomes over the garden fence and into the field next door. He was once more at the Burrow. Though he was only there as Sirius was trying to get their new home sorted. Last few things that they needed to do before they could move in. Grimmauld Place was dark and dank. It gave Harry the shivers most of the time that they were there.
“The Weasley family is neither light nor dark, they will choose when the time comes, but most believe that they are a grey family. But the last large conflict between light and dark, they were on the side of the dark I believe,”
"You are free to go," she smiled as she watched the Wizard as he went towards the gallery. The wizards and witches began to leave, though some remained behind. Most of the paparazzi remained trying to get a picture of the now free wizard and his famous godson.
"Poppy!" Snape called out, as he waited for the Hospital Matron to walk into the room, "Poppy!" he yelled again as Ron was helped over to one of the beds and settled down on it.
Harry grinned as he looked at the pile of gifts he had opened, a lot of sweets and a few books on defence, and other things like that, but he was happiest when he had seen his guests arriving. He didn’t think anyone would come.
Sirius snorted at that, “yeah right,” he grinned, “last time you said you were going for a book we didn’t see you for almost five hours. And that was just one book. You also came back with seven more,” he added.
Harry and Ron shared a look and rushed to get their brooms again. Both of them wanted to fly a little longer. It wasn’t like they could do it in the middle of London without the Muggles finding them.  Sirius watched them go, quick to return as they took to the air. He watched as the two of them passed an old Quaffle between the two of them, though they mostly just raced around the Burrow.
“Friend,” Sirius finished, “yes, and he betrayed us. He decided that he would sell out to the highest bidder, and he cost Harry his family. The chance of having siblings, like you. James and Lily wanted a few more children. Harry will never have that chance. And while you might hate the fact that you have brothers and such, he would love nothing more than to have that connection to more blood families,” he sighed softly. “You need to think of what you have that makes Harry jealous of you.”
Sirius glanced at it, eyes narrowing, it was the one thing that they hadn’t checked in the room yet. Which was why Harry had been told not to touch anything in there. “What was it?” he wondered, thinking of what could be in there that would have called to another wizard when he felt nothing.
The two talked for a while longer, coming up with a stable plan in getting the cup. When Narcissa and Draco left, Remus came out of the library and the little family sat down for dinner together. Both of the adults could see that Harry was in a more subdued mood than he had been that morning.
"Clever girl," Remus muttered, almost snorting. "And how would you know that?" he asked, though he had a feeling it would have something to do with a certain Potions Master.
"I do, Madam Bones, it will take me a moment to retrieve it from my private potions lab. I have it securely locked there," he nodded as he left the room, robes swirling behind him dramatically as he headed to the office to use the floo.
Harry let the witch hug him, "I will, Hermione, and make sure you tell me when you go on holiday again. I know you've been talking about your parents taking you somewhere for the last month."
Harry turned quickly, eyes lighting up as he saw the man waving his arm to get his attention. "Sirius!" he yelled out, rushing towards him, weaving in and out of the other students. Letting go of his trunk he wrapped his arms around Sirius' waist. It was still a little thin. But it wasn't as bad as the first time he had hugged the older man.
With that, Hermione picked up Crookshanks' carrier and grabbed the handle of her trunk. Giving her friends one last smile and bye, she headed to the exit to the muggle side.
"It's okay, I understand, I'll just get Sirius to take her home," Harry smiled at him, ignoring Ginny as she tried to move closer to him.
"Go on Bambi, I'll see you again soon, so don't you worry," Sirius smiled and then looked up at Snape, "take care of him for me, and tell Remus I'll speak with him soon."
“Molly, please, she could be being harmed even now. That is some really bad dark magic,” he told her, not wanting to explain what it was as he didn’t want to scare her.
“Hmm,” Draco nodded, “I could tell that there was something really bad about it, I just don't know what. Something to do with the soul I think,” he shrugged, “maybe my mother would be able to tell us better when she comes back.”
Arthur nodded, a tight look on his face, “I understand, not keen on the Malfoys either, but that is more Lucius than Narcissa and Draco,” he added.
“Albus,” Sirius called the man out of his thoughts, sipping his tea, “I think that the diary that was in Hogwarts, that Ginny Weasley was enchanted by, I think that might have been one as well.”
Albus nodded, “Oh?” he asked, as he then poured the two of them some tea, “one sugar and milk if I remember correctly,” he added, glancing at the other.
“I’m not,” Ron said, standing proud, “I know the rules of Gringotts, and I know that my life is yours should I deceive you or any other worker of this bank,” he added, he learned something from Bill after all.
"She's a girl, I... I don’t like girls," he said, his voice shaking. He had been keeping that to himself for the last few months. Not wanting to tell Hermione or Ron in case they didn't like it. He didn't want to be abandoned, and he was scared that Sirius would do the same thing. He had just found the man, but he didn't want to keep hiding who he was.
“You sure it’s all good?” Dean asked, a small frown on his face glancing at the blond. He remembered the things he said about muggle-borns all too well.
“She was sabotaging our work, changing the right answers to wrong ones and making us believe that they were right,” he answered him, giving the short version. He didn’t want to talk about it.
“Look, I just want to talk for a bit, I know that you feel like you’ve been betrayed now that Harry is somewhat friendly with Draco. But you have to understand that they are also family. Much like you’ve become for Harry,” Sirius began.
We are getting very close to the halfway mark of this fic... I am hoping to try and get it all posted before the end of this year. But most likely won't be able to :(
Ron was silent for a moment, going over the words that Sirius had told him. He knew that Harry was jealous at times, could see it in his face as he talked about his brothers and even about Ginny and his parents. “He wants my family,” he said, “Or a family of his own, that's all he ever wants,” he murmured.
“I did, the day after we talked. There is something lingering around. And she is to go on a potion for about a week before we will see anything like her true self to come through. It’s going to take a while for her to really recover. Molly is trying to stop it all,” he sighed heavily, not understanding why the woman was trying to keep Ginny's true personality under wraps.
Ron’s smile dropped when he got a good look at Harry’s face. There was sadness in it, and Ron knew that it was because of him. He had caused that by acting like a spoilt brat. He knew he was being stupid, but it had hurt. At that moment, it was painful to feel like he was being left alone again. It happened with his brothers all the time. And Ginny being a girl did her own thing. Ron had older brothers, but none of them ever wanted to play with him. So, when he made a friend, he was jealous of anyone that got near him. Not wanting to be left behind. Sirius had told him that Harry wanted Ron with him, not left behind, but beside him.
Harry glanced up a little, trying not to let the wizard know that he and Ron knew he was coming. "Thanks for the warning," he murmured back as Hermione once more tried to talk to the two of them.
“Oh, erm yeah,” Harry gave a nervous laugh, “It’s fine, I know you only did it to keep me away from it. Now I’m out of the room, I’m fine,” he smiled, though Draco could see he was still shaken by what had happened to him.
“Okay, I really don't like this at all,” Ron muttered, rolling his eyes. He would have to try and keep his temper. He had been working on it when Harry had called him out on it a few months ago. That he should try and learn to hold it and let things go easier.
“Yes you are, you fucking turned on us, making us believe falsehoods. It could have gotten so bad that we would have failed classes and then what would happen?” he asked her, yelling back. He was done being quiet about her behaviour.
Harry sighed as soon as she was out of sight. Ron gave him one last look before he went out of sight. "Thanks," he said quietly as he glanced up at him.
Harry and Ron looked at her, shocked on their faces, "Hermione," Ron began, "Do you remember me telling you about what happened in second year?" he asked her.
"Yeah," he nodded, grinning back, "Sirius is going to be meeting me at the train station. The Dursley's won't be there, and I won't be seeing them again," he answered Hermione.
“Draco will help, he wanted to be Harry's friend his first year. But then he heard what Lucius wanted and decided to make him a rival,” she said, snorting a little.
Ron gave him a small smile as he walked over and past them, looking up at the sky he yelled out, “Harry!”
“Yeah, I wonder if she has been able to see someone about what she saw and went through. I know that if we were in the muggle world, she would be required to see someone. I know I could have done with someone to talk to about what happened. Though I’ve been talking to Sirius about a few things. I’ve only just started,” he added.
“Really,” Ron muttered, “she has no fucking idea what she has put us through,” he added, looking to the ground.
“Okay,” he nodded, “thank you for having us,” Draco said again as he then went off towards Harry’s room. Having been shown where it was the last time he had been there.
"Can we talk about it later?" Harry whispered as he looked around, seeing some people watching and staring at them.
“Thank you,” Harry said as he sat up, looking at the light breakfast he had been given. He smiled a little as he started to eat, knowing that what was there wouldn’t upset his stomach that much.
"Now, it will take time for Sirius to get something sorted for you to live in, for the both of you. He has a place, but it isn't the most pleasant of places. But I know that you won't want to go back to the Dursleys’, even though there are special wards around the property to protect you," he murmured, almost to himself.
Harry’s smile went wide, “really, you will? I think the two of you would really get along now that he doesn't have to think like his Dad anymore. He’s his own person, but that’s only because he can tell Lucius Malfoy to fuck off,” he snorted at the thought of Draco doing such a thing.
"What is it, Severus?" she asked as she walked in. Freezing as she saw who was now in her hospital wing.
“They may be Slytherins, but it’s not a bad thing. I used to think the same thing all the time when I was a child. But I grew up, I grew up because I had to. In a time of war, we thought anyone in Slytherin would become a death eater and would side with Voldemort. It wasn’t until we were out of the school that we saw that no matter what house they were in people from all four houses were death eaters. You met a Gryffindor one recently, remember,” he pointed out, reminding him of Pettigrew.
He grinned at the thought, “We can take away his most valuable people,” he laughed, “We could make it even harder for him to recruit if he ever returns.”
“I know Ron, I would never force you to get to know someone. He did tell me that he had no choice but to follow the normal Malfoy family rules. But now that Sirius is back, he can go back to Black family rules and views. And since Sirius is in charge of that, they aren’t lining up with the Malfoy ones, so he can be more himself now and not a copy of his father,” he said as he thought of what Ron had told him about what it was like in the Malfoy family and why he wanted to follow the Black family under Sirius.
Draco nodded. The two went silent as they waited for Sirius and Narcissa to come back to the room. It didn’t take long for them to come in and Sirius to go over to Harry.
Draco nodded, “that's fine,” he said, a small smile on his face, though it wasn't a happy one, but more like sympathy.
“That’s, really good,” Ron said slowly and carefully, “I still don't like him, I know he’s your family and you’ll have to be nice to him. But well….”
“She didn’t want to listen at all,” he agreed. “Thinks that Albus would know about all this and would have told you,” he added.
“Of course,” Ron snorted, and then laughed as though they wouldn't take to the air at least a few more times before they headed back to Hogwarts.
And now excuse me as I go back to writing a fic in a new fandom. Like seriously I get pulled in at the wrong time sometimes.
“Yeah, arithmancy and runes. Divination is a joke,” he snorted, “She predicted my death each lesson.”
"Petunia," Snape snorted, "She hated the fact that your mother had magic and she didn't, she turned that hatred towards me and your mother after a while. I don't suppose living with her was... pleasant," he added, getting a meek nod from the teen beside him.
“What the hell is Malfoy doing here?” she hissed at him, eyes glaring towards the blond a few more times as some of the others walked over as well.
"No, we don't," the woman said, "When you gave the kiss on sight order, as you know they are supposed to come through my desk first. When I heard you had pushed it through on your own, I looked into the case, there is no transcript of a trial."
“Ron, Harry, why don't you go and play with Ginny?” Molly suggested as she tried to take the work they were doing away from them.
"That's because I was never given one. I was taken from the scene, stunned, and then the next thing I know, I was in a cell in Azkaban," Sirius sighed, a strained look on his face.
"Yes, Madam Bones," he nodded, taking a step around Harry, though the younger kept hold of his hand as it moved from his shoulder.
“Yeah,” Ron answered, “We could get a bit of practice in. I want to try out for the quidditch team now that Wood is gone. I want to try for the keeper position. I need some practice.”
“I can’t believe you would tell him that not all Slytherins are bad,” Molly hissed as she turned on Sirius.
“Welcome mate,” Ron grinned, putting an arm around him. The redhead wasn’t happy when he spotted Hermione again, and had done nothing but complain about it the day that Harry, Sirius, and Remus had moved into their new home. He had come over to help, and Hermione had arrived before he was leaving.
Thank you for the amazing comments and kudos. I love and adore you all. So happy to know that so many of you are enjoying this fic!
“Then I’ll see about getting you over here even more. Maybe we can have a bit of fun,” Harry suggested.
“I haven't, I was going to wait until I know it would be more effective, I’m going to have him strung up by the short and curlies,” she muttered, feeling a little vindictive after all Lucius had put her through. Not letting her keep a number of her friends, because they were Half-bloods and Muggle-borns. As soon as she had married him, everything had been taken from her. Her aunt and mother backed him up. But now, the tables have turned.
“Yeah, I heard about his adventure in his second year, fighting a basilisk and living to tell about it,” he closed his eyes, shuddering at the thought of what Harry would have gone through.
Thank you all for the amazing comments and kudos, they are all loved and adored and read many times over!
"No, it would be great, to live with you, to be with family, with you," he rambled, hope blossoming even more in his heart as he thought of living with Sirius instead of his relatives. They may have housed him and fed him, but it was always the bare minimum. They didn't really care for him, they had only done it for appearances only, wanting to seem like the right sort of people to those outside of the house.
“Sirius Black, I will not have you talking about it in my home. Now either shut up about it or leave!” she demanded, turning around and waving the spatula that was in her hand in his face as he walked towards her.
“I know, and she will never be able to replace Lily, never, and she can say whatever she wants but you and I both know it won't happen,” he rescued the young wizard.
“It’s fine Dad,” Ron shrugged, he had dealt with it all the time. “So… Hermione, she was changing our answers to wrong ones?” he said, embarrassed about his little spelling problem.
"And I am a free wizard, Mrs Weasley," Sirius said as he placed a hand on Harry's shoulder, seeing the teenager starting to tense up.
“Okay,” Harry nodded as he got up, “well, no time like the present,” he walked to the door, Draco quickly getting up and following him downstairs.
Sirius sighed, rolling his eyes, “That’s not what I want to talk to you about,” he told her, “Look, please sit with me and talk for a moment,” he suggested as he went to the dinner table and sat down.
“Please, why?” Harry asked her, eyes begging for her to give him a reason, one that would explain and lessen the betrayal.
"I will," Snape nodded, "Come, Potter," he said as he then waited another moment as Sirius and Harry hugged tightly one last time. The Potions Master directed them to the floo office so they could head back to Hogwarts. Once more paparazzi were shouting questions at them and taking pictures as they kept quiet and walked to the office.
“Yeah, so much faster the Eroll,” the redhead grinned as the two started to try to catch the small bird.
“Okay,” Harry said as he looked at the clock in his room, “Draco should be arriving,” he added as he got up to go and greet the other wizard.
"And Harry only wishes for your son to come over, then I will be sending Ginny back," Sirius said firmly, "I have invited Ron to my home, not Ginny at Harry's request as he wants to spend some time with his best friend." he looked at the witch, daring her to keep trying.
Thank you for the awesome and wonderful comments! Love and adore you all. Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well.
"But it does. There is one thing the wizarding world values more than magic, and that's blood. Family lines are very important. With Harry and Malfoy both having those lines, and with Harry being a Godson to a Black as well. He should pass the message on as it's to do with family," Ron ran a hand through his hair as he put down his knife and fork, "ugh, I hate this stuff, never learned it right," he muttered to himself.
“They did. I went into another room, wanted to read through some of the books that Sirius recommended reading about the families in the wizarding world,” he told him, “So I was in the room, and something was pulling at me. I don't really remember much. But the next thing I know, I’m being held in Draco’s arms and he is keeping me from reaching for something, asking if I’m okay.” He finished, eyes wide as he then added a few more details of what happened when Narcissa and Sirius entered the room.
Harry gave a shaky nod, "yeah, he... he said he'll be here," he murmured. There was a part of him that was scared he would be left behind. Left alone like he had been for so long with his relatives.
"So you're okay with me living with Sirius?" he asked, he had been half afraid that something would happen and he would have to go back to his Aunt and Uncle.
“I know, Harry, but she is so stuck in her view,” he muttered, “And I wish I knew where it came from.”
“So, what is it you wanted to talk to me about?” he asked as he finished pouring the tea and handed it over.
"You two take care of your friend, Snape and I will be able to deal with this one," he suggested as he looked to Snape.
He took off in the direction of the Hospital wing. Praying Harry and Lily were both ok and Lily was still in the man.
“I told you I am believing you until you show I can’t.” He walked over to Aries and pressed his lips against his boyfriend’s. They kissed for a minute before deciding to continue looking through the books and ingredients.
“I’m fine. Told him the lie we came up with and he bought it.Was very happy with me. I’ll tell you later. What happened? I got back, both rooms were empty, and I knew to come here.”
“That has never happened before though. I have been basically tortured for years and that never happened.”
“Dragon, you haven’t stopped talking about this boy since you first met him in Madam Malkins. My Dragon, you may breathe fire, but you have a heart of gold. It was clear in all the letters you sent when you talked about him.”
Aries walked up the stone stairs to the headmaster’s office and said the password. He didn’t even bother knocking, he just opened the door and walked in.
“Yes! Draco Lucius Malfoy! I will marry you!.” Harry yelled it that time to make sure Draco heard him. Draco released a big breath and put the ring on Harry’s finger. He leaned over and kissed the man he was going to marry.
About ten minutes later there was a knock at the door. Snape opened it and stuck out his wand. Draco was behind him and asked, “What does Weasley call me and why?”
He pulled at the chains around his wrist. Already bloody and raw from prolonged exposure to the chains. After an hour of no progress he dropped his hands. He felt hopelessness seep in. One thought kept pulling at the back of his brain.
“Draco, I can’t spend my life scared. I am thinking of Lily. I want her to know two of the most important people in my life. I have kept too much from them already. They don’t know Snape is my father. I plan to tell them today, but that on top of Lily is going to be overwhelming. I couldn’t tell them about Father because if they were captured it could have blown his cover. Now there is no cover. I can be completely honest with them. I won’t tell them about you being a spy, but at least it’s something. We already have a cover story for you. The least I can do is be honest about everything else. Plus, I have been stuck in the castle for weeks. I am not even allowed to go outside without four escorts. Let me just have today. If anything happens we have emergency portkeys for the hospital wing.” Harry needed this and Draco knew it.
“If you are going to waste kisses, you better use them right.” Harry said. Draco rolled his eyes. He lowered his face to Harry’s. Their lips brushed. Harry pushed forward. Draco pushed right back drawing a small gasp from the other. Draco took that as his opening and pushed his tongue in. There was no burst of passion, no fighting for dominance, no pressure to go further. Just them lost in the moment.
“Severus, he won’t want to see me. He’ll find out it was me and be horrified. He won’t believe me when I say I have changed from when he first met me. He won’t remember how much I care about him. How I was the one who helped him heal every time the Dark Lord was done using him. How close we became. I can’t, no, I won’t have my heart broken again.” The voice said.
“Harry, I am so sorry. I know you don’t trust me or-” Draco was cut off when Harry wrapped his arms around the trembling frame. The blond man started sobbing into Harry’s chest, returning the hug.
Harry started to shake his head and opened his mouth to answer no, but stopped himself. That was a complete and utter lie. He should tell her, she was the best equipped to help him. She was the headmaster after all. But what if she couldn’t help him? What would he do then?
“That’s enough, both of you!” Slughorn marched over and yanked them both by their cloaks. He grabbed the last vial out of Harry’s hand as he pushed them towards the door. “Mr. Malfoy, you will go to Madam Pomfrey to make sure that the potion doesn’t harm your skin. And then you are to go to Headmistress McGonagall immediately afterward! The same goes for you, Mr. Potter. Now get out!”
Instead of waiting for an answer, Pansy turned to Draco, murmuring under her breath while trying to get him to sit down.
“Hermione” Harry interrupted her, gently placing his hand on her shoulder. “It’s alright, I just got detention that’s all…”
"Yes," he nodded, eyes going wide as he realised exactly what Snape was going on about. "Sirius, I suggest you started getting out of here, the full moon is going to be rising soon," he advised. "I've had the potion, and while I know I should be safe, I'd rather not take any chances," he finished.
Sirius remained silent, as he placed a hand on Harry's shoulder again, grounding himself a little. Harry looked at the man, "It's true, Minister, we saw it all, and he confessed that he had been the reason why Voldemort had gone after my parents that night," he added, reaching up and placing his own hand on Sirius, needing that comfort, that reassurance that the man was there behind him. That he wouldn't just disappear on him.
“Dad,” Ron said quietly, “Do you think I could do the same?” he asked him. Unsure if he would be torn down and told no. His mother had done that when he suggested taking Arithmancy the first time.
"They are," the redhead said, "even I'm related to the Black’s somewhere along the line," he muttered.
“Wow, yeah, really messy, took me a number of years to be able to make notes without making a mess. So you’re about normal. I bet your first-year notes were even worse,” Draco pointed out to him.
“Albus never said we shouldn’t. He never even told us what to do, so why are you against it?” he asked her as the two of them started an argument.
“Yeah, I need to get a book from Flourish and Blotts,” he answered, looking up from his breakfast, “I shouldn’t be too long.”
Hermione moved slowly, but she sat down and then looked at the two easy that were pushed towards them. She looked them over, going a little pale as she noted that there was a third set of writing on the first one. The one that she had changed. “I…”
“Well, you know that Malfoy and his mother are related to Sirius, and you were right about telling him. It was a good thing I did. Been reading a few books. They are part of the Black family, meaning that they are somewhat my family as well.” He sighed a little as he saw Ron grimace.
Ron nodded, “yeah, she’s been snapping at me any time we’re alone. Or rather away from Mum and Dad. The twins and Percy have heard what she’s been saying to me as well, but Mum always takes her side and says that all of us are lying. Percy is getting really pissed off. He’s thinking of moving out. He's sick of being called a liar when he tries to stand up for me,” he sighed heavily.
“I know for a fact that you got a bit wrong on your essays for DADA, but when I talked with you beforehand, you knew the answers already,” Remus said.
“It’s not the fact that you have money, it’s the reminder that I’ll never be able to have new things. Did you know it took me three weeks to talk Mum and Dad into letting me have a new wand? Three weeks and part of why they gave in was because of all the wands we have, none of them even gave a spark,” he said. “When I get a gift from family, it's always something that has been through at least two or three brothers before me. Clothes especially. The jumpers at Christmas are the only new thing I get. The rest is something that Bill or Charlie owned, and that's because I’m built like them. I’ve no doubt that if I wasn’t so stocky at times that I'd have been getting Percy’s and twins’ stuff as well. And I can’t go out and get something nice or a treat while out, we have to watch the galleons all the time. The trip to Egypt was because of Ginny, she wanted it and Mum and Dad let her choose. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have gone,” he sighed.
Remus went to the library, and Sirius couldn’t help but grunt at him, “always a bookworm,” he muttered to himself as he walked into the floo receiving room just as the floo started to activate. It didn’t take long for him to accept the connection and for Narcissa and Draco to come through.
With a nod, Ron got up and followed his friend out of his bedroom and headed towards the kitchen. His mother was already at the stove. Sirius called out to her.
"I know, and he can pay, by being in Azkaban, with him captured, they... they should set you free," Harry said quietly, looking between the two men.
Harry nodded, “yeah, he said as much. That if his Dad steps out of the line that Narcissa has drawn for him, he and his mother are going to be leaving. If that happens, from what I learned…” he paused a moment, making sure he got it right in his head.
"I know we did. A prank stops being funny when the person being pranked doesn't find it funny," he nodded in agreement.
“So we have to wait,” Draco sighed, finally moving closer to Harry, knowing that he and the others were safe from the Horcrux.
Ron winced, “I think I would have, I know Mum would have made sure I was reminded again of Uncle Fabien and Uncle Gideon and how they were killed by Death Eaters.”
"That isn't for you to decide at all, Mrs Weasley," Sirius said once more as he could see that Harry was beginning to get angry with the accusations that Molly was flinging at him, "I will be like any other man that has become a parent, I will learn how to be one."
"They should," Remus nodded, "They should at least give him a proper trial now," he said, a soft, fond smile on his face, "You are very much like your mother," he murmured.
“So, she is the one that put that stupid nonsense in your head,” Harry snorted, not surprised, “Look, Ron, I was supposed to be in Slytherin, I really was, you know that. Would you have hated me?”
“I think you could, Ron, you may not think you’re smart, but I know you are if you let yourself be you,” Arthur reassured him, patting him on the shoulder before hugging him.
“Really?” Albus frowned, “That has been lost to time for almost four hundred years,” he murmured, sipping his tea.
"What's it say?" Hermione asked as she leaned closer, almost ready to take the letter from him as he was opening it too slowly for her peace of mind.
“Harry, sweetie,” she said condescendingly, “I know you want to think of Malfoy as a friend, but he won't ever be that. He is a Slytherin, and he just uses people and throws them away when he is done, just like all of those of that house,” she added, glaring at Draco.
“It’s not going to hurt him?” Draco and Ron asked, giving each other a glance before looking back towards Sirius.
"Yes?" Albus said, sitting up a little straighter, though he had a feeling what the teen wanted to know.
“Yeah, each time, and you can see she was giving us high marks for them as well. She loved it when we put down that we were going to suffer or death was in our dreams,” he snorted at how morbid the divination teacher was.
Harry sat at the table and replayed the day over in his mind. It was beautiful. It made him think of his own wedding.
Several things flashed in front of him and it took several seconds to realise they were all of his memories he had lost. He could remember everything. Small talks with Draco.
Aries said with a smirk. Everyone but Draco froze. Mouths dropped open. That was when Draco laughed.
“Well, I am not sure I approve of your plan. This is very dangerous. What if they find out? What will you do then?”
His thoughts were soon interrupted by the door opening. A man stepped inside. He looked completely normal except for the dark, blood red eyes.
man that was unable to come, along with ones for his parents and Sirius. He felt Neville was standing next to him the entire time anyway.
“Great! Another snake Malfoy is dragging down with him. Just wait until you meet my best mate. He is going to chew you up and spit you out.”
“How do we tell him? How do we tell him he isn’t who he thought he was? That his greasy-git potions professor and mortal enemy trying to kill him are his parents? That Lucius fucking Malfoy is his Godfather? That he isn’t actually an orphan? That we thought our son had died? He has had everything taken from him. His parents. Twice. Black. The family he was left with abused him. I could have protected him. I’m his mother. I should have protected him. Why was my baby taken from me?” He broke down into sobs. His husband grabbed him and deposited him into his lap. Together they cried. For the loss of their son. For the heinous things that had been done to him. All the pain they had felt for the last fifteen years.
Harry’s heart leapt. Draco had been there from the start and still was here. However, Draco couldn’t look at him. He must have regretted it.
“I can go with Harry. Draco sent me to see what was taking so long. You go tell Draco and I’ll take Harry.” A new voice chimed in.
“Who is this? I haven’t seen you before. You shouldn’t be with the snakes. They will only infect you.” Ron said with a glance back at Draco.
“No, I don’t really feel like having mind altering potions in my system. What do you want?” He asked, not really giving a shit.
“So, we had dinner before Pomfrey let you leave, now we have free time before bed. What do you want to do?” Draco had taken to becoming Harry’s personal distraction.
“Severus? What are you doing here? I never thought I would see you sitting courteously with Mr. Potter.” She said when she saw him. She had a warm, inviting smile on her face that screamed, proud mother.
Harry rushed up the stairs and to his room. It was moments like this he really missed Sirius. Dumbledore told Vernon at the beginning of the summer that his godfather had died and to let him grieve. The only thing that accomplished was they were worse than before.
“I am going to speak to your parents and see if they will sign your guardianship over to me. Even if it isn’t permanent. I won’t allow you to stay in a house where you could be hurt. I made that mistake with Harry. I won’t with you. Will you be ok with that?” He asked the little girl.
When Harry woke the next morning he felt someone behind him. He rolled over to see who it was. He looked over Draco’s features wondering how they came to be in the same bed.
They set to work on their potion with an almost practiced ease and partnership. They were the first done and had to wait for everyone to finish.
“Actually, I was hoping you could help me with something. Father.” Harry’s voice never wavered. At hearing his title his face softened.
“Well. However, homesickness is no joke. Twelve first years have either broken down and cried or said how they miss their parents. One is all together refusing to speak. Maybe you could talk to her, Harry. Her name is Danica Dursley. Do you know her? Is she related to your Aunt and Uncle?” Hermione replied.
“Don’t bother. Stay here!” Harry ran as fast as his large belly would allow, to the girl’s dorm, but stopped at the stairs. Taking his first step, he prayed the stairs would allow him entry.  When his foot met with a solid stair, he climbed. He knocked on the door.
“You know about that? She isn’t biologically mine, but I am her dad. I have been there through every part of her life so far. I love Harry and Lily is part of him. Look, why don’t you go to bed? I will stay with him and you can come back in the morning. You need the rest.”
With tears in her eyes Petunia signed the papers and handed them to her husband. He looked at them then threw them on the table. “No. I don’t think I will. Dani is my daughter. She may be a freak, but I can still find a use for her.” Vernon said.
With that Jane led the girls out to the common room. Harry approached the little blonde girl he had grown up with.
Draco’s eyes grew as he saw the son of his godfather walk into his room. He was by far the most handsome boy Draco had ever laid eyes on. His jaw dropped open.
Draco grabbed his hand and said, “maybe it would be better to just show them, Harry?” Harry nodded and stood, all eyes on him. He took off the glamour first, then his robe. Hermione gasped and put her hand to her mouth. Ron’s face turned dark red.
“Language, Draco, but I agree.” Snape ran a hand through his hair. “I have a class then I will be back with Dani. She is worried.” He stood and walked out.
Snape never thought Harry would actually call him his father even after a year of acting like nothing changed in public, but actually being very close in private. He always still called him Snape or Severus. That all changed when Snape told the Order what had happened.
“Harry, I just wanted to apologize for Ron. We don’t all agree with his opinion. You are like a brother to me. You didn’t choose this and are making the best of a bad situation. I really would like to still be part of your life. No matter how small a role.”
“Alright, if you don’t mind Harry is now eating for two and I would like my son and granddaughter fed.” Snape went and sat down at his usual spot. Harry and Draco moved to go sit at the Gryffindor table when Minerva stopped them.
“Ah, Mr. Snape. You are just in time, please take a seat. Lemon drop?” Dumbledore asked as Aries sat.
“Yes, my Lord. He is almost at eight months now. After that, for male pregnancy it is a guessing game.”
Draco looked to the floor. His heart stopped. This was it. This was the moment where it ended, everything they had built between them. He felt the tears fall. He couldn’t look into those beautiful green eyes and lie. He kept his gaze locked on the floor and said, “It was a memory.”
When Draco was satisfied, they went back to the common room. Draco agreed that the less people knew of Aries’ identity, the better.
They went to the Hospital wing together not knowing the extent of Harry’s damaged body. Snape still remembers every word of the medical report and the tears in Poppy’s eyes when she looked at Harry. She handed the report over to Snape after checking with Harry to make sure it was okay to do so.
“Yeah. It just hurt more than I thought it would. Mione, I love you. Sorry about this. I know you have feelings for him, so if you want him, you can go. I didn't want you to have to pick.”
“Lumos.” He looked around and saw a small lump in the middle of the floor. He was about to turn and leave when the lump groaned. The tall man leaned down and saw the boy.
“I was just wondering where Draco is. I wanted to see if he could tell who I was. If anybody would be able to, it would be him. You can’t hate somebody for six years and not know exactly what they look like.”
Hermione shrugged. “I guess it is better than shacking up with Ron. I wasn’t joking earlier. His arse has twice as many freckles as his face.”
He lifts one of Harry’s legs over his shoulder and positioned himself at the entrance.  He locks eyes with Harry and pushes gently but steadily. He bottomed out quickly, knowing Harry is very impatient.
“Are you coming or what?” The voice echoed. Smart ass comment it was. Draco groaned, but jumped anyway.
Harry started yawning and Draco declared it was bedtime. Harry started up the stairs to his dorm, but paused and turned around to face Draco who was about to go to the Slytherin dorms for the night.
After the feast, the students started heading to their common rooms. Harry stayed seated next to Draco worrying about being alone.
“Ah, young Malfoy. It seems my slave is in labor. You shall go tend to it and get me my heir. Miss Weasley. You have done remarkably. You shall be rewarded. You get the privilege to raise my heir alongside me. A sort of mother if you will. Stay with me until Mr. Malfoy brings her.” A hissing voice said calmly.
“You are all crazy! Just watch! Nothing good is going to come from this!” Ron shouted as he ran from the hall.
“Hell no. I mean he does, but only under extreme circumstances. He also doesn’t just go around killing muggles and mudbloods either. That is what Dumbles wants everyone to think. I believe he is behind most of it. You should just sit down with your father and talk to him about it. He would obviously know more than I do. I only got inducted this summer. Remember?”
As it had turned out Hermione had already sent her trunk ahead to the castle. They got to the front entrance and started towards Gryffindor Tower. Snape stopped Harry and sent the other two ahead.
He was immediately called to Ron and Greg’s station. Theirs hadn’t turned out colourless or odourless. Just gray and smelling like a toilet.
“Oh, Harry! It is so good to hear your voice. What happened? How did you figure it out?” Snape released Harry and looked at Draco who still had not stopped smiling.
They all seemed to accept that answer and moved on. Aries spun the bottle again, this time stopping on Draco.
Now since Snape is no longer a spy Harry can go to his last year at Hogwarts as Harry Prince. Potter is dead. He died the moment Snape saved him and they wouldn’t have it any other way.
“We don’t know actually. That’s why we are here. He got upset and started crying, next thing I knew he was talking.” Draco concluded.
“Well, you know how my Gryffindor brain works. I saw an opportunity and took it. I can’t stop now though sir. I am in way too deep. If nothing else you have a spy. I think this is the way I can finally finish off the evil bastard.” Aries didn’t say which evil bastard he meant though.
“No! Absolutely not! I thought you were smarter than that Draco. You will not be doing it!” Hermione yelled.
Narcissa stood directly behind her and said, “well, I shall go contact the Aurors.” She walked to the floo, threw powder in and called out. Aurors filed in and took Ginny away to await trial.
Draco laughed at that. “I can’t even imagine. It is weird enough having him married to my Godfather.”
“I am holding you to that. That means you can’t talk to anyone else. No one. I mean it.” They both climbed onto the train and found an empty compartment. Aries pulled out a book and started to read. He found this summer he actually enjoyed reading. Mostly Greek mythology. Right now he was reading a book written by a wizard about a summer camp for demigods. He was only halfway through the first book in the series, but he really liked the Luke character for some reason.
The trio walked to the Great Hall in time to hear Minerva scream, “Like hell you are. You will be doing no such thing to that boy. Do you understand me?”
“I am fine. I got a shield up in time. Don’t worry. He did get fifty points taken though and I got twenty.” Aries chuckled.
Draco nodded. “Of course, Harry. Now, I am exhausted. I would be surprised if you aren’t. Let’s go to sleep.”
“Okay, Harry, you were kidnapped approximately six months ago. The Dark Lord had a spy in the school who saw an opportunity to gain level with Him. He has yet to be caught or revealed. I on the other hand revealed myself as a spy to free you. We will find a way to restore your speech. There seems to be no physical reason. Maybe a spell, maybe not. I promise we will find it.”
Alley to get some new clothes. He loved getting clothes that actually fit him and weren’t in tatters.
Aries turned to the two confused newcomers. “Yes, I am Professors Snape’s son. I apologize for my behavior before, but someone has to knock Draco off his high horse every now and again.”
Draco smiled over at Harry and grabbed his hand under the table. Harry blushed and smiled back. Hermione looked over at the couple with a knowing raised eyebrow. Harry just whispered, "Later."
I would like to say I am sorry to write this, but I’m not. I believe it has been a long time coming.
“Wow. That is- wow? You are right, I wouldn’t believe that. I’m sorry. I didn’t want to believe that you were doing this to spy or something. Yes, I have had a crush on you since first year. It almost broke my heart to give up on the idea of you to pursue feelings for you. Well give up Harry for Aries. Wait, Dumbledore said Harry is in hiding.”
“You are going to come with me.” He set her to her feet. “Help me up. Can’t really do it myself anymore.” She grabbed his hand and helped him to his feet.
After that night the subject was never brought up again. Everyone accepted Snape and Harry as father and son, no questions asked. After that night Harry only called Snape father, except in public where they still had to pretend.
“That would fit my theory then.” Snape then looked at Harry. “Harry, are you sure about keeping the child, with who his other father is?”
He got to the door and whispered, “Unicorn.” The door popped open. All the lights were out, suggesting Harry did indeed go to sleep.
“Well, you, Lily, and Draco may sit with your father if you wish. I look forward to seeing her. You both may call me Minerva or Minnie when not in class. Harry, you are practically my grandson. Any choice you make I will support. Now if you will excuse me, I need to go have a word with the Headmaster.” She smiled warmly then turned, her robe snapping behind her enough to rival Snape’s.
“I know you don’t remember, but we did grow close. I consider you my best friend. You are not, and I repeat not alone in this. You can ignore the Dark Lord’s involvement, because as far as I am concerned, I am Uncle Draco. I agree with you. No matter what you want to do, I am not letting you do it alone. Understand?” Draco demanded.
Aries slipped up the other body and kissed Draco deeply. He positioned himself and pushed in. Draco moaned in a low voice. He pushed back with his hips, signaling Aries to not stop.
“I was wondering when you would get here. Miss Granger said you were called. Are you ok?” Snape’s voice rattled him in the silence.
“Draco, would you come to the dungeons with us? Mione would you explain to Nev?” They all nodded and set off.
“I am sorry. I had to get him out. He is almost dead. I will explain everything I know. Until then, I need to heal him. Please Lucius?” Severus Snape never begged, but he was getting extremely close.
“I mean yeah. If Snape hadn’t shown up and I still made it, I was going to owl you anyway. This just saves time. That and if I am your kid you aren’t going to kill me right now.”
He continued sending letters to Narcissa to discuss wedding details. He had absolutely fallen in love with his future mother-in law. She had sent several items for Lily. Hats, bows, dresses, socks, and the list went on. She had started referring to Lily as a granddaughter, which made Harry so happy the first time she did that he cried for an hour.
Even before he was taken Harry hardly ever hugged anyone. He didn’t like being touched. That made this hug more meaningful.
“While you were asleep just now we removed your clothes to make it easier to work. That was when we saw your knee. Sev went and got a potion. You add the hair of the parents and it shows if their children are near. He added our hair and it showed us you. As for how you got to Lily and James, I have no Idea. We buried our son, but here you are. All of us broke that day.” Tom finished.
It had shocked everyone when Snape told everyone he was getting married. No one, not even Harry, knew he was dating anybody. Getting to call Remus, Dad, had made Harry happy though. Dani was ecstatic. She had been permanently adopted by the pair earlier that year and loved the attention her two dads gave her. She was a very doting Aunt as well. Lily loved her Aunt almost as much as her Mum and Dad.She is just about to finish her fourth year at Hogwarts. She and Dudley still wrote to each other every now and then, but it was nothing compared to the relationship with Harry.
Snape’s breath caught slightly. “Oh, Harry. Your mother would have loved that. If you want Lily, then I will gladly accept the role of her grandfather.” Harry released Draco’s hand and stood. He went to the only father he had ever known and hugged him.
“Well, if you want to be frank, I want to know how you did it? How did you con our beloved potions master into believing you are Aries Snape? Or should I say Riddle?”
YEAR 13: SEVERE BURNS(ARMS), SEVERELY LACERATED SKIN(BACK, CHEST, ARMS, LEGS), DEMENTOR ATTACK, HARD FALL (30+ METERS), CONCUSSION, RIB FRACTURE(LEFT), MAGICAL EXHAUSTION, BRUISED ESOPHAGUS, ANAL TEARING(RAPE, MULTIPLE), MALNUTRITION, DEHYDRATION, NEGLECT, ABANDONMENT
“Minerva, please be reasonable. It will be the safest place for him while he is recovering from having the fetus removed.” Dumbledore said. Harry’s hand shot to his stomach and his mouth dropped open.
Neville looked Draco up and down. He nodded. “Yeah, ok. I would like to get to know this new Draco. He managed to sit at the Gryffindor table all through dinner without picking on or  making fun of anyone. I think it might be a record. You trust him, Harry, so that is good enough for me. We are going to miss you in the dorm. Come on.”
He went to sit down when the owl went crazy again. She knocked over everything that would get his attention. After a few seconds snape snaps his book shut and stands.
“I’m not five, don’t treat me like I am. I know Ron Weasley beat you up. That is all anyone can talk about.”
Snape placed the child on the bed and immediately ran diagnostic spells over him. He started to work on the internal injuries first. He could deal with the rest later. The worst of the internal was a broken rib punctured his left lung causing the blood in the boy’s mouth he had seen earlier.
Instead of just sitting there waiting, he went and took a quick shower. By the time Snape returned Aries was out of the shower getting dressed. They had sent an elf to Diagon
Snape never had hope his son would be alive, so he had never tried this potion before. Now he had to know.
Suddenly Ron pushed back from the table. “You lot are insane. I am not getting anywhere near the spawn of that freak, and I’m not talking about You-Know-Who. Stay away from me. You are disgusting!” With that Ron ran from the room. The three remaining just sat in shock.
Snape had gone back to the Dursley’s a few days after Aries had returned. He grabbed all of his son’s things and obliviated the muggles. He made them forget Snape had ever been there and that Harry Potter had just run away.
“I’ll go.” Blaise said. He spun the bottle and the others watched it spinning. When it finally landed, it was pointing at Vincent.
She looked at him, hooted as if to say she would get help, and flew into the dark right as the door to his room flew open.
“Good. I was so worried. Look, I have class, so I have to go. I will see you later though.” She said.
Aries raised one hand and waved it. A brush of magic swept over them, ridding them of both of their clothes.
He used all the pain he had ever felt. His parent’s death. The Dursleys. Sirius. Every detail he remembered from when Lily was created.
“Seeing as Aries knows how volatile these ingredients are, I highly doubt that. Knowing how insufferable you are, he is probably telling the truth. Fifty points from Gryffindor and detention tonight with me. Twenty points to Slytherin for telling the truth and preventing a bigger disaster with good spell work. Now, I suggest, Weasley you exit the store room until Aries is done. Then you may come back. To prevent any more accidents.” Ron glared at Aries and followed Snape out.
Draco groaned. “Merlin, Granger. I didn’t need an image of the Weasel’s arse in my mind. I might be bent, but that is too far.”
Harry grabbed Draco, cuddling in close. He sobbed into Draco’s shirt and Draco just held him, knowing nothing would help make him feel better. Soon Harry cried himself to sleep. Draco just looked at his fiance watching him sleep. Promising silently to never let anything happen to Harry or Lily Marie Malfoy-Potter again.
Harry failed to notice the spells firing in the background. The fight all came to a stop when Harry screamed at the top of his lungs. Everyone stared at him.
Aries stood. “Aries. I have heard stories about you. Makes me think you don’t really know or care what you are talking about. Please go elsewhere to continue your search for the Golden boy.”
Tears poured out of his eyes. His whole body shuddered. He wrapped his arms around his larger than normal stomach, sobbing silently. He sat there crying silently when warm arms went around him. He could smell the trademark oranges that Draco always smelled of. He sobbed wishing as hard as he could that he could talk. That he could tell Draco how he felt about the baby.
Aries lifted his head and tried to keep a straight face. “What you said I wasn’t allowed to talk to anyone else because you want me all to yourself.”
