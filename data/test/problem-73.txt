“Hey! You’re Harry Potter, right?” he greeted, casually leaning against his Nimbus.
“Uh, yes you do,” Ron said, giving him a weird look. “You’re always behaving like a dolt in front of him, just like you do around Cho or Cedric. You’re always going off to meet him, mate, you even blew me off the other day because apparently that was the only time he was free. You’re going to the Yule Ball with him!”
“How come you are so interested about Durmstrang, anyway?” Ron asked, nudging Harry. “They’re all a bunch of Dark Arts practitionners, anyways. Grindelwald went there, you know.”
and burning the lot of them down immediately.
Next chapter, Rita Skeeter's shenanigans!
So I have my complete outline, pretty much (rewrites are so much easier, I must say).
“And you will tell us if your mark changes any more than it already has?” his mother asked.
“They fill people’s, mostly girls, heads with that silly idea that your mark is only about the person who you’re supposed to love romantically for the rest of your life,” she would always lament. “When really, every research done on the subject shows that they’re linked to reciprocal impact of the greatest magnitude on each of the partner’s lives. Lots of soulmates bonds have never been romantic at all.”
Three sonorous bangs echoed as Professor Galdrar, who taught Enchantments and was widely believed to be a vampire, tapped her Seneschal staff against the stone of the floor. Karkaroff emerged from the shadows behind the pulpit in his usual over-dramatic fashion. He paused behind it for a few seconds, looking down his nose at them with his washed-up blue eyes. Draco knew he thought it gave it a powerful air, but he had neither the poise nor the charisma to pull it off, and it only came off as bluster.
“Why are you so focused on the roles, Potter? You’ve been whinging for the past half-hour, and if you put the same energy into remembering the steps, we’d already have moved on,” Draco sighed, and then, firming his hold on Harry’s waist and hand, proceeded to lead them through a perfect example of a simple box set and right turn.
“Preposterous,” Draco scoffed. “Soulmarks are for positive influence of great impact between the two persons who share them. There is no way the Dark Lord is soulmarked – no Dark Wizard has ever been, and there is no way he would share a mark with you, of all people, who he tried to kill as a baby.”
Took me a while to get back in the groove, but finally, here we are!
It wasn’t that Snape’s announcement had surprised him: since seeing the words on the Prophet at breakfast, he had known his mother would contact him. He had not anticipated it happening quite so soon, though, and certainly not through the Potions Master. Snape had been somewhat close to his father, once upon a time, but the relationship was nothing more than cordial nowadays: a shared understanding based on a common past, which existed between acquaintances rather than friends. To the best of Draco’s knowledge, Narcissa Malfoy had never fit anywhere in this equation. Yet she had contacted Snape directly, and managed to get his help in securing a private conversation with Draco. It spoke of a stronger relationship than what had existed between Lucius and Snape, and of a direct one, too: Snape had not mentionned Lucius at all, and from that Draco gathered that his father didn’t necessarily know about the upcoming Floo call, and that his intercession hadn’t been needed to convince the Potions Master.
He still felt the niggling suspicion that something wasn't quite right with the situation, and that if he were to know all the details, he would not be quite so happy with Dobby's intervention. It had something to do with the way the elf had refused to give any detail about where and how he had obtained the plant, which bore striking ressemblances to the way he had acted back in second year when Harry asked too many questions. Without the self-harm, obviously, but everything else in his attitude reminded Harry of those first meetings.
This chapter mixes different things:
“Probably means it isn’t, don’t you think?” Harry said venomously. “And you’re still better informed than I am, because he hasn’t seen fit to talk to me since the day he left for the holidays.”
. But when Karkaroff gestured his precious student forward, Harry understood why he was so solicitous to him. And if he hadn’t, the way Ron’s nails immediately dug into his forearm as he breathed an ecstatic “Harry… It’s Viktor Krum!” would have erased any doubt.
“Trust me,” he said with a smile and a wink. Then, looking past Harry’s head, he said, his voice colder: “Hello, Malfoy. Don’t worry, I’m finished. He’s all yours.”
“Where would I have learned to dance?” Harry sent him a surprised look. “McGonagall is going to give us some lessons, but I don’t think she’ll have time to teach us all properly.”
“Sveta, do you know what this little shit is on about? He keeps talking and talking, but will not tell me anything definite,” Antoniy complained to his sister as they joined her in the Auditorium for the headmaster’s welcome speech.
Rita Skeeter strikes again, as promised.
“Then why did he hug Harry?” Hermione pointed out. “That doesn’t make any sense, if he was planning not to have anything to do with him anymore.”
Lucius looked as if he wanted to dispute this claim, but Draco’s parents always decided which line they followed before any discussion, and always presented an united front, no matter how much they disagreed with each other privately. They never wanted to appear weak to internal dissenssions.
And how the hell did Draco Malfoy even know his name?
A glance at the line of professors informed them that yes, a few of them were watching them – Blacklund’s glare promised a thousand torments if they did not stop immediately. They both straightened and linked their hands behind their back, resuming the military stance the headmaster favored. Let it not be said Karkaroff ever thought about his students’ comfort while he went on with his speeches. He probably enjoyed watching them try to avoid squirming and fidgeting as he droned on and on.
“No?” he laughed, bitter. “Could have fooled me.”
He barely hugged them, really, and only if they initiated it.
- some background lore on soulmarks, because we haven't seen them in a while. Might be a little repetitive for those who read in one go, don't hesitate to tell me if that's the case.
“Why was she so angry?” Ron asked, nonplussed. “I only asked her to the ball.”
“No, Mother, of course not,” he smiled at her. “It will be like an academic exchange, I am sure I will learn a lot.”
“Why don’t you ask him? He’s the one avoiding me.”
Draco could have screamed, or cried, when they led the Hungarian Horntail into the arena. Trust Potter’s luck to draw the most dangerous, most aggressive species of dragons for his Task. That was just on par with the rest of his life, wasn’t it?
“Says you,” Harry muttered sullenly, eyes fixed on his feet once again as they went through another repetition. “I’m just going to fall on my ass. I’m sure the other Champions know how to dance.”
“Darling, you must understand. Our position has been very precarious these past few years, and we must take all precautions to ensure that nothing… untoward, happens to either of us,” she said delicately, taking a seat in the large armchair facing the fireplace.
Harry, defeated, swam back to the Durmstrang student and considered him carefully. He had always thought of Draco as striking in appearance, but here, asleep in the water, the older boy seemed softer, like his sharpness had been smoothed down. Harry shook his head and put back to his mind their last conversation, just to keep himself from hurting himself again with false hopes. Draco had rejected him, that was important to remember, and for no better reason than his parents asking for it. Getting him out of the lake was one thing. Forgiving him, however, was another completely.
“And we do not appreciate your omissions,” Lucius said, his lips thin and severe.
They meet!
“Do you have the smallest tactful bone in your body?” she said, glaring at him. “That was so far away from a motivational speech, I can’t believe you lost the plot so bad. And Viktor will not drop me, because we’re not in a relationship. We’re just friends.”
He risked another glance at Granger, and saw her clutching Weasley’s arm fiercely. The ginger git was so pale Draco could have counted his freckles from where he stood. Well, at least Potter would get his best friend back, and it’d only take him almost dying.
On the contrary, Madam Maxim waited until the tables had been cleared, and clapped her big hands to draw the attention of her students. Half of the delegation from Beauxbatons rose and formed a line in front of the Goblet. The first one to put her name in was Fleur Delacour, that part-Veela girl who had such a strong effect on some of the boys, Ron included. When she walked back to Ravenclaw’s table, the young girl who looked so much like her beamed at her, and she returned the gesture by stroking her sister’s hair quickly. It was sweet, especially the way the younger girl glanced adoringly at Fleur. Somehow it softened Harry’s impression of her, of the snobbish girl who had seemed to only find things to sneer at in Hogwarts.
Oh. Ooooh. He had thought that Draco sounded like Ron just a few minutes ago, but it hadn’t crossed his mind that the words stemmed from the same underlying clause. Suddenly he felt like giggling: Draco, of all things, was jealous.
By the second week, he had demonstrated the three Unforgivable Curses to half the school, and hadn’t that been a truly pleasant lesson. Now Harry had a spell name to go with his nightmare of green light and motherly pleas, which he felt he could have done without, all in all. Neville had gotten out of the classroom in an even worse state than Harry himself, and quite a few students wore haunted looks in the halls for the last half of September. They all wondered whose brillant idea it had been to allow the mad new teacher to demonstrate curses which had last been employed on a large scale during the Wizarding War, from which quite a few students bore familial trauma. Now they had a much clearer idea of how it had all happened. Such a treat. At least the younger years had been spared the education: Moody must have found something else to teach them, because no one from the first to third year had been subjected to his little sound and light show with the fantastic twitching spiders.
“Can you tell me who in Slytherin you’ve seen using dark magic, ever?” Hermione said, snapping her book close.
That would not work, Draco knew this instinctively. There was no way a school, filled with hundreds of students, some of which had not been raised with the knowledge and reverence that soulmarks evoked in wizarding society, would not make the discovery of the most famous person in the country – and arguably all of Europe – being soulmarked their main topic of discussion, and of many rumours beside that.
A lot of events from the books won't be described, because you all already know what happens, and, well, I'm only interested in Draco flirting with Harry, basically.
Draco tried to keep his face still, but his mother had always been incredibly good at detecting microexpressions and minuscule flinches – she was the diplomat, Lucius was the politician. She was watching him like an hawk, and she saw it.
“So how would that work if we tried to speak French with the Beauxbatons students? Wouldn’t everything get translated anyways?” Harry asked, and was delighted to see Hermione frown.
any of them, Ronald Weasley, I’m just able to have some empathy for my fellow schoolmates. You should try it, instead of acting like a callous berk,” Hermione said scathingly.
Draco is still pretty much deciding about where this story is headed, regardless of what I had planned. It is slowly getting back closer to my intended outline though.
, and burrowed under the covers, hoping to sleep until he forgot ever having met Draco Malfoy, sleep for so long it might as well have been forever.
The muggleborns and half-bloods might not have understood the depth of the transgression, but for those who had been raised and weaned on wizardry fairytales, it stood different. Soulmarks were private, so incredibly private, that you only trusted those closest to you with the fact of their existence, and most people confined the revelation of its form to an even smaller circle, and generally only once it had settled and they had identified the other partner in the soulbond. To reveal a soulmark accidentally was one thing: to take a picture, of an unsettled mark at that, and publish it in the most highly read publication of Wizarding Great Britain? Unconscionable.
“I think he used the fact that he vas vat Harry would sorely miss in our riddle,” Viktor said from his other side.
Their first dinner at Hogwarts is very informative, in Draco's opinion.
Harry can't say he likes the new Defense teacher much. It might have something to do with the fact that he uses curses supposed to send him directly to Azkaban on fourteen-year olds.
, out of anyone, would give him anything dangerous."
“So you’ve said, loudly and multiple times,” Harry said drily. “I’m sure the Sorting Hat would try to sort you to it if you came within a hundred yards of it, even as a foreign student.”
Harry is having a very bad day, and Malfoy is not making it any better.
“Of course,” Svetlana said. Viktor just nodded. “There’s a thousand galleons prize.”
He was not helping, he knew that, but he was also quite unclear on whether or not he really wanted to know where this was going. Not that Harry seemed likely to quit his efforts to say his piece. Damn that Gryffindor courage. Draco wasn’t sure he could handle it.
“Stop whinging, the both of you,” Hermione snapped. It had taken three days, which Harry thought was a remarkable amount of time for her tolerance of Quidditch-related topics to dwindle to the negatives. “There will be dozens of international students, you could try and meet them, maybe even learn another language.”
“Thanks,” Harry said softly.
“Oh,” Harry said, craning his neck to watch him. “Er, you’re welcome? The others knew as well, so it would have been unfair not to tell you too.”
, borrowed from Neville, as if her life depended on it.
“I didn’t do it,” Harry growled between clenched teeth. “Here, satisfied? You can go back to your friends and tell them there is no special trick, I don’t know how my name got into that thrice-damned goblet because I
And he smirked and Harry ducked his head. He had used his whole reserve of daring for a few days on that action, Draco could rightly piss off if he expected anything more right now.
“I- Would-,” he bit his lip. “Would that be okay?”
“Brilliant. We can check with our own eyes if your skills are up to your reputation, then,” Malfoy smirked, already stalking back to the pitch. “Come now, Potter,” he said over his shoulder, but Harry was already following him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, the kid needs all the support he can get, doesn’t he?” Draco flicked the badge and the colors exchanged. “Plus, I had to show them how shoddy their workmanship was. Their Charms teacher must be truly appalling, really, if that was the best they could do.”
Draco cheered when Potter flew circles around the dragon’s head and doved under her tail and away from her flames. He cried in alarm when the great spikes caught the boy on his shoulders, and shouted in triumph when Potter rose up with the golden egg tucked under his arm. And he stood and clapped his hands off when Potter landed in front of the jury, disheveled and with darkened cheeks from his flight.
There was no way to explain this to Cedric: Harry just shrugged.
Then, because Draco had probably been cursed as a child – wasn’t there always a malediction of the princes in the fairytales? – Severus caught him after lunch, just as Draco left for his Transfiguration class with the rest of the Sixth Years Slytherins.
This was not going the way he had hoped.
“Did you?” Ron’s face cleared. “Great for you, mate! Who are you going with? Oh, did you finally ask Cho?”
Oh, bloody hell! That Transfiguration teacher couldn’t have waited just one more minute?
“No I won’t,” he said gloomily, looking at his upturned hands on his lap. “I behaved like a twat, and everyone saw. No one’s going to want to go with me. And all the pretty girls have already been asked, anyways.”
Somehow, he really didn’t want to tell Draco, with his posh ways and his sophisticated airs, about the Dursleys.
“You told stories about his exploits, dear, you did not say you were spending time with him and taking him to the Yule Ball,” Narcissa tutted. “Obfuscation of the truth is still a form of lying.”
His parents, however, firmly believed in the doctrine of pureblood superiority, passed down through generations in the House of Black, and quite enthusiastically, though nowhere near as fanatically, down the Malfoy line. Of course wizards were superior to muggles, they had magic, and of course purebloods were superior to half-bloods, they had had magic for generations longer, and both parents transmitted it. Muggleborns were flukes, random occurrences that were best left ignored and, frankly, never taught magic at all. They were bound to cause problems in the long run, their blood not strong enough to ensure their descendants would inherit magic with each passing generation. Weakening the bloodlines.
Viktor quickly followed, though the sight of Harry with Draco in his arms seemed to give him pause. He stopped to look at them, but his transfiguration made it even more impossible than usual to guess at what he was thinking. He made a sign at Harry, then at Hermione, and Harry shook his head, nodding to the blonde head close to his. Viktor made a move that might have been a shrug, and made quick work of Hermione's ties.
“Is that what it is about? We weren’t even flirting, Cedric has a bloody girlfriend!” Harry cried, throwing his hands up.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well if they didn’t go about it using the Dark Arts, maybe I’d have more respect for them.”
The ball in Harry’s stomach, tight and clenched, exploded, half a second before every vial and flask in the lab followed suit.
“Poor dears,” Svetlana said. “vell at least zey’ve got a grand castle to compensate for the lack of outside space. Look at zat entrance hall, it must be as vide as the Auditorium.”
Draco was scheduled to spend the remainder of his break at the Manor, and he had never felt less enthused at the idea of seeing his parents. But his mother was already disappointed he hadn’t been able to attend the Yule celebrations with them because of the ball, he couldn’t deny her the rest of the holidays as well.
"Well," Draco whispered, resting their foreheads together. "That was nice."
When he stopped them, Harry promptly smashed into him, tried to step back, tripped over nothing and stomped on Draco’s feet all over again when rebalancing.
Draco resisted the urge to close his eyes in despair. He had hoped for a few minutes of prevarication before they got to the heart of the matter, but he had obviously underestimated Narcissa’s anxiety on the subject. The very Floo call she was making should have discouraged him of the notion, anyways: his mother hated the practice, which she judged undignified.
“You,” Harry gulped. “You, er, you want to go to the ball with me?” he whispered, his throat dry and clamped.
“See you in ten days, Potter,” Draco smirked, so close that Harry could smell the sharp accents of his shampoo.
Draco will probably end up the Ball terribly maimed, based on Potter's abysmal dance skills, but he can't bring himself to regret it.
“I don’t know,” he said, annoyed.
He broke the surface a few moments after his gills and webs had disappeared, and took a great inspiration with shaking relief, before checking for his two charges. The sleeping enchantment must have been tied to their presence underwater, because they were waking up, and Harry crossed glances with Draco almost immediately. He recoiled and let go of him, surprised, and tried to think about how to get away, when a great ruckus saved him the burden:
Harry, Ron and Hermione considered the gnarly ball of gillyweed with expressions ranging from disgusted – on Ron's part – to excited – on Hermione's part, who was leafing through
He even managed to look properly posh wading through the muddy waters of the lake, and wasn't that particularly unfair? Harry looked down at his drenched t-shirt and shorts and grimaced.
“You know the Prefect bathroom on the fifth floor? Fourth door to the left of that statue of Boris the Bewildered on the fifth floor. Password's
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, surprised, because he certainly had not the foggiest idea what Draco’s reason for suddenly freezing him out could have been.
This was confirmed when Snape led him to his office, where a green fire was already roaring, and simply said: “I will leave you to it, then. Let yourself out when you are done, Mr Malfoy,” and disappeared into the next room.
The front page was titled “THE BOY WHO LIVED, SOULMARKED.”
“Step inside, do not stand on ceremony!” a voice called from behind – Dumbledore, of course, with Karkaroff and the giant Beauxbatons headmistress. Krum was dragging his feet behind them, watching the floor sullenly as if it would provide his deliverance. Draco snickered and waved his wand to send a soft stinging hex to him, just enough to get his attention. Really, that had been done with the best of intentions, no need to glare at him so.
“Don’t zey know how to defend zemselves?”
“I am not risking my final evaluation to hold your hand zrough a sevenz year Practical, Drasha,” she had said, and that had been the end of it.
“Svetlana,” he stage-whispered at her in mock horror. “I think our little Viktor is also turning traitor on you. He’s got a crush, and on one of Potter’s friends, too!”
“Of course,” Draco sighed. “Soulmarks are old magic, older than any written or oral traditions, and they’ve always, always been between people who changed each other’s lives in a positive manner. You can be exceptionnal all you want, you will never be the exception to the oldest rule of magic that we know of. Don’t worry,” he added, tracing Harry’s scar with the thumb of his free hand. “That’s the only mark the Dark Lord’s left on you.”
"I don't know," Harry said. "He wouldn't say, and you know Dobby. When he doesn't want to say something, he's not saying it."
“He’s lying,” Draco informed Svetlana. “Where are you going?”
“He’s never lost a match, except for that one time with the Dementors,” she drawled – she had a delicate voice, but the way she carefully enunciated each words made it sound like she was permanently bored with everything. “And he became his team’s seeker on our first flying lesson, when he caught Longbottom’s Remembrall. He had never flown a broom before that.”
Harry mumbled something he couldn’t quite catch but was ready to wager went along the lines of cursing the whole damn Tournament, including Yule Ball and everyone who had ever been involved in its organization. Draco couldn’t fault him for that.
Harry felt like pointing out that it was the furthest he had ever gone with a romantic partner, period, and he had been breathless and panicked about it all the way back to the Gryffindor Tower, and then some more hours afterwards for good measure. But that was a mortifying thing to confess to the older, more experienced boy you had done it to, and he thought he could do without the awkwardness.
The more Karkaroff tried to convince his charges that blood purity and the Dark Arts were the last bastion against the savagery of the muggle world, the more they became convinced that the muggle world was absolutely fascinating.
That was not it.
“It was not!” Antoniy protested, and, when the Sami girl rose her eyebrow at him, more sulkingly: “It was not.”
“Huuum. Or maybe ze spell is not used to foreign languages yet,” she mused. “So it can’t accurately compensate for sounds zat don’t exist in Russian.”
Lucius pressed his hand, quick and half-hidden under the table, to his right forearm, where Draco knew the Dark Mark laid. He raised horrified eyes to his father, whose own were dark and severe.
“So you will keep your head about you, and not tell the Potter boy of our family’s private affairs?” Lucius said, putting his hands together in front of him. “Including our political inclinations, and any information that may result in negative consequences for us?”
He must have realized what he had said when Harry didn’t reply, and raised catastrophed eyes to him, which Harry met with a flat stare. A ball of something really calm but really potent churned in Harry’s stomach.
“You can flirt with Kaija all your fill, then,” Draco said with a smirk.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he said, gathering his wounded dignity and trying very hard not to look in the direction of Gryffindor’s table.
“Someone asked me, actually,” he mumbled, running his hand through his hair.
Antoniy’s sharp elbow to his ribs was a small price to pay for such satisfaction. The insults which followed in Russian only threatened to make Draco smile, but he controlled his expression and kept his impassive attitude and didn’t move an inch. A good little Durmstrang student, he was. Even Blacklund would have found nothing wrong with his posture, and the Duel Professor had been known to use measuring tape and a metal square to teach proper mien.
“Oh, you lovesick fools,” Svetlana said, clucking her disapproval. “Could you spare me zis pazetic display?”
“Harry, you never told us you had a soulmark!” he exclaimed.
“I know that,” Ron said, rolling his eyes. “It’s not like you’re very subtle when you get a crush.”
Draco had to admit he was, too. He considered himself, without false modesty, an excellent flier, but he had hopped on his first broom at the tender age of five – his mother would not hear of it before that – and Viktor had known how to steer one before he even learned to walk. Legend had it that his first word had been neither Mum or Dad, or whatever the words were in Bulgarian, but broom.
“She speculates that I’m sharing my mark with Voldemort,” he spit out, and wow, Draco hadn’t read the article, but he hadn’t thought it could get any worse than revealing an unsettled soulmark to the world. Rita Skeeter lived to surprise, apparently.
“No, Harry, no,” he moaned, throwing his arm across his eyes. “Really? That ponce Malfoy?” he added, taking a peek from under his wrist.
As a child, and even as recently as two years ago, Draco might have agreed with the sentiment. Now, he did not feel so sure. Could he really renounce such a connection for the sake of his parents’ ideals?
"You have to eat
I haven't. I'm just unsure on how much I want to stress that plot point, given that I want to also rewrite the following years.
"No," Harry snapped, unable to help himself. "You don't get to say that, and I don't want to hear it."
And with that, Harry’s worries were somewhat alleviated. Hermione’s confirmation on the next day, as they walked to the portkey, assuaged whatever was left of his fears. She did warn him, however, that if their meeting indeed happened during the mess of the World Cup, it might be some years before he was able to meet his soulmarked. After all, it was unlikely to be someone who attended Hogwarts, otherwise Harry would have already declared his mark. Ron noted that it might be a first year, which, ok, fair, but when he joked that it might be the new Defense teacher, Harry bodychecked him into the nearest tree. They were still squabbling when they met with the Diggorys, and Harry couldn’t control his blush when he met Cedric’s amused eyes. When they got to the campsite, he was quick to walk away from the Hufflepuff seeker. Not as bad as falling from his broom because of Dementors but still – bad enough.
But there wasn’t really anything to fault with the current set, they would go very well with Draco’s own charcoal grey one, and Harry seemed very reluctant at the idea of ordering new ones, so Draco let it rest. He knew how to pick his battles, and teaching Harry to dance would already be an uphill one.
Draco beamed at him, and Harry had been a fool to think he would manage to regain his bearings after pushing out his answer. That smile was
“I-” Harry cleared his throat when his voice came out embarassingly small and high pitched. “Sure, I guess.”
“Well, the Dark Lord is gone, so it’s not like it matters, does it?” he said impatiently. “I don’t know what a wizard dead those past thirteen years has to do with my relationship with Harry Potter.”
“Oh, er.”
It went something like this, as far as Draco managed to retrace the precious few minutes of calm that they experienced that morning: he sat down between Svetlana and Viktor for breakfast at the Slytherin table, as per usual, and looked for Harry’s mess of hair amongst the red and gold. He found it, and found the green eyes already turned towards him, and smiled at him half-teasingly, and Harry, to his great delight, answered with a shy smile of his own and ducked his head, before raising it again. Granger, by his side, seemed to be acting in a similar vein with Viktor: the only one who appeared disatisfied with the situation was Weasley, who by his expression and the way he glared at Draco before dropping his head in his hands, must have been bemoaning the situation at length.
The night ended more early than any of them would have truly liked, and Harry and Draco found themselves on the grounds overhearing a rather pointless and rather dangerous conversation about giant heritages – really, anyone could see both participants were part-giant, what could be gained by discussing it where anyone could hear? – and feeling embarrassed at Delacour trailing her partner towards the bushes for some more intimate time.
Draco, looking like he couldn’t help himself, jerked his hand forward as if to try again.
“I’m eleven,” Gabrielle said, narrowing her eyes at him.
- Svetlana chewing out Draco for how he dealt with Harry in the previous chapter is a bit of an authorial mouthpiece, but I really don't want people romanticizing this: this is not the way a healthy, respectful relationship should go. Draco and Harry are very young and immature, and it's showing.
“What is it?” he asked, squeezing Narcissa’s hand back and avoiding a longing look at his plate. He had been flying over the grounds all afternoon, and felt ravenous.
Draco remained rooted at the spot, his hand stupidly held to his cheek, until the sudden hoot of an owl surprised him out of his trance and sent him on his way to the Durmstrang ship.
“Erm… I got you something,” he said as Draco raised an eyebrow at him. “It’s not much but… it made me think of you.”
“It will be fun,” he said, returning them to the center of the room.
“He asked Fleur Delacour to the Yule Ball,” Ginny said.
“I can see that,” Malfoy said, looking uncomfortable. He suddenly grinned: “Why don’t you fly with us? That’s bound to make you feel better, and you can boast about flying with Viktor Krum, seeker extraordinaire. He can probably give you some tips too, if you can get him to talk. Once he starts, though, he’s unstoppable,” he added, leaning to whisper this in Harry’s ear confidentially, though Krum was much too far from them to hear.
“Are you daft? Why do you think I’m asking?” Draco frowned at him.
But sometimes they're making it difficult.
“You’d have made a good Hufflepuff, Harry. Not everyone would have been worried about their rival getting the short end of the stick,” Cedric grinned. “Did you figure out the egg?”
Harry didn't, before she had told him. She hadn't left him any occasion to read through the chapter itself, what with the way she was hoarding the book for herself.
He would come to rue his words in the upcoming weeks, though neither he nor Harry realized it at the time, even when Hermione’s eyes glittered.
All of Draco’s fears disappeared when, after two agonizing minutes where nothing happened, though Harry had cast a spell no one heard, the Firebolt slammed into the kid’s hand and he jumped on it and pushed off the ground simultaneously, with a smoothness of movement a great many professional Quidditch players would have envied him.
Harry gulped, and Draco had to resist the urge to do the same. That woman was scary. She could even have given Blacklund a run for his money.
“What Blaise means,” Pansy interrupted, glaring at her friend. “Is that Potter and his friends have a tendency to attract attention.”
“Well, the tradition has fallen a bit out of fashion, but in pureblood families, people used to start courting around fifteen or sixteen. That way you had a lot of time to find a proper partner from your social circle, and if that didn’t work out, you still could move to foreign circles when you got older.”
Well, he had expected that.
Harry refrained from rolling his eyes at this. How neither Hermione nor Ron had ever considered the possibility they might be each other’s soulmarked, Harry could not fathom.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What? From Beauxbatons, then?” Then, when Harry kept on avoiding his eyes: “Not from Durmstrang, surely?”
She was almost animated by the end of her speech. That sounded very much like a good old fashioned crush to Draco’s ears, who considered himself quite the expert on the subject after three years of dealing with Rasputin’s pathetic pining for Kaija Krysi.
Next chapter, Hogwarts welcome their exchange students.
you zere bodybound, but you’re coming eizer way.”
Draco had a pretty good idea himself, from the fact that Pansy Parkinson and her friends had taken one look at his chest when they had joined lunch, exchanged guilty looks and hurried down the table to sit as far away from him as possible.
“Oh, mate. I’m sorry for you,” Ron said in immediate compassion, clapping his shoulder. That was the good thing with Ron: sometimes he could be really oblivious, but when he wanted he could be very supportive. “Then who did you ask?”
“Draco, darling,” Narcissa said as her disembodied head appeared in the fire. “How are you?”
All three of them had been more than ready to adore Professor Moody when the twins had come singing his praises and waxing lyrical about their first lesson with him. Hermione, upon hearing about what had happened to Parkinson – alleged victim – had immediately changed her mind. She certainly had no lost love for the Slytherin girl, who had relentlessly mocked her front teeth and bushy hair during their first year:
Yep, Svetlana has an accent in Hogwarts that she didn't have in Durmstrang. There's a (possible) explanation coming, as I'm trying to reconcile my headcanons for Durmstrang with the actual canon accents in the books.
Draco may or may not have been involved in a months-long campaign to ensure no one would help the git until he had missed a certain amount of classes. But that was nobody's business but his, really.
“I didn’t mean it like that!” Draco rushed out, raising his hands.
"Well, now you only need to figure out what they're going to steal from you, don't you?" Ron said, lying back into his armchair.
“Have you not?” she asked again.
“Great! We’ll start the dancing lessons tomorrow then. And I’ll need to see your dress robes. I can’t be seen with someone who doesn’t clean up nice, you know.”
“I am not responsible for Father’s political missteps,” Draco said, returning his gaze to the fire.
“Oh, darling,” Narcissa moaned. “You must stop now.”
“He went back to his parents for the hols, you said?” Ron said, as if it were a sufficient explanation. When both Hermione and Harry kept looking at him uncomprehendingly, he sighed: “Don’t you remember what I told you about the Malfoys? His dad was a Death Eater, for Merlin’s sake. He probably got chewed out for spending so much time with you and inviting you to the Yule Ball. Now he’s realized that of course you’re You-Know-Who’s enemy, which doesn’t make you a friend of his family, and he’s keeping his distance.”
Draco had a particular interest in Potions, and the promise of a man of Severus Snape’s calibre teaching him on the subject was more than enough to perfectly reconcile him with the idea of spending a year away from Durmstrang.
“Sure you don’t,” Svetlana said, agreeably. “And, Drasha, vord of advice? You should stop calling him kid, it makes you sound like a pervert.”
Harry shook it warily, glad that they were both wearing their gloves and that Malfoy wouldn’t be able to feel his clammy skin.
We'll see.
“Your relatives could have taught you,” Draco said.
“Why would I even want to put myself in harm’s way?” Draco rolled his eyes. “Rest assured, I have not developed any Gryffindor-like suicidal tendencies in four months at Hogwarts.”
“Was it wrong, Draco?” his mother asked anxiously. “Should we not have done that? I was just so happy that we might spend the winter holidays together this year.”
They were much closer to each other than Harry had realized: from such a short distance, Draco’s eyes looked a bit blue, rather than the usual steely grey, and Harry could make out the eyelashes, so fair and fine it almost looked like the Durmstrang boy had none, from afar.
The Beauxbatons Champion was next, against a Welsh Green, and did quite well, in Draco’s opinion. Her sleeping enchantment was inspired, and probably the best solution overall, but it didn’t take much to realize she hadn’t had time to properly master it when the dragon woke up and singed her clothes. Draco couldn’t understand why she scored less than Diggory when she had only gotten some fabric, rather than her
Draco could have done without all those revelations about his family, which he seemed to be stumbling into every few weeks this year.
Hermione cuffed him and he yelped.
“What are you doing here?” he asked.
They had grown, not close exactly, but certainly friendly enough in the three weeks since Draco’s arrival. Potter seemed ill-suited for fame, always trying to slink back when too many people paid him attention, and between his current position as unexpected fourth Champion and Rita Skeeter’s, may she burn in fiendfyre, campaign against him, compounded by his status as the Boy-Who-Lived, he was attracting a lot of it.
“You said you would stop talking about that,” Harry cried, annoyed. “And I did not trip.”
Harry has zero chill.
Draco wasn’t, as it turned out: he simply kept his hand around Harry’s, tugging him slightly to lead him back towards the lake. They stayed on the far end, away from the rest of the students, and talked until it was time for Draco to catch the Hogwarts Express, which he was really excited about.
“Thank you, Professor Snape,” Draco said in a subdued voice, and then proceeded to compile an exhaustive list of all the swearwords he knew in as many languages as possible – then creating new ones when he started repeating himself – until the time came.
“Of course I do, I’m pureblood,” the git scoffed, rolling his eyes. “We get taught young, so we don’t make fools of ourselves when we have to attend formal functions and start courting later on.”
Draco suspected she wanted to show Hogwarts how to dress for proper balls.
While Madam Maxime and Dumbledore went on with the pleasantries, the Beauxbatons students, about thirty of them, were alighting the carriage and arranging themselves in orderly lines in front of the carriage. They wore light blue robes, which shimmered in the moonlight and which, if the way they shivered was any indication, were much too thin for the Scottish autumn weather. They were all very elegant, to be sure, but the tooth-rattling did take away some of the effect. None of them seemed to consider warming charms as a solution, to Harry’s surprise.
“How come your relatives never even taught you one simple dance?”
“Nothing to do about it, though,” Draco said, for which he got a glare, because apparently Harry wasn’t feeling very philosophical right now.
“You will get a detention before Karkaroff even speaks,” Viktor said in his usual mild manner as Antoniy tried to cuff Draco and Draco ducked.
Flirting! Teasing! Awkwardness all around! (mostly on Harry's part, to be fair)
“See? This is why I’m leading: I actually know the steps, and I can force you to follow if need be,” he said, controlling his grimace as Harry peeked a panicked look at him from under his curls. The kid was lucky he was so cute. “And I’m trying to teach you the other part because I’m hoping that it will ensure the survival of my remaining toes. Optimistic as that may be.”
“It might have been mentionned once or twice,” Draco said airily. “But you know what your advantage is?”
They heartily disagreed on the subject. They both had soulmarks, though they both refused to discuss their shape or location. Hermione was adamant that no one was to know about hers, and only Ron and Harry knew she had one, at all. She didn’t want to be associated with the romantic perspective a lot of the students at Hogwarts had of the soulmarks, didn’t want to be limited by it. Ron, on the other hand, could not have made a secret of it if he had wished to: he came from a wizarding family, and a big one at that. A soulmark was something to be proud of, the promise of some great future. He might have been the less remarkable of his siblings in all other aspects, but in this he was singled out as special. Ron saw his mark much more positively than Hermione ever did, because no matter how inadequate he could feel in some instances, he always knew that at some point in time, he would do something that mattered enormously to at least one person. But soulmarks were still incredibly private, to be shared only between the persons who bore them. That was one rule Ron did not care to break, and so no one knew about the shape of his.
“Do you know who she’s going with?” Ron asked again, and when Harry answered negatively: “Damn. We’ll be the only two sods without a partner at this rate. Maybe we should just go with each other.”
“I am so glad you think this is funny. It’s not like I could die in those bloody trials, or be seriously injuried, or anything like that. What’s mortal danger compared to a good laugh, right?” he spat, glaring at Malfoy as the boy looked at him with his eyes round with surprise. “I hope you have a grand old time watching me fail terribly. At least one of us will be enjoying this, and you’ll be sure I’m not a threat to your own champion in that way.”
“Even if you did,” he stopped as a few bottles started rattling on a nearby shelf. “Even if you did, it wouldn’t change anything, Harry. I can’t be seen with you anymore.”
Draco deflated under the combined weight of both his parents’ stares, Lucius’, so close to disappointment, and Narcissa’s mixed equal parts with sadness and hope.
“I don’t know,” Malfoy answered, and then there was the sound of someone running after him. “Potter! Hey, Potter, wait!” Malfoy called.
Draco shrugged. He didn’t think anything, hadn’t really had time to explore the idea anyways. It was a grand idea, that was for sure, that this boy he was pashing on shared a soulmark with him. But they would not be the first two people with soulmarks to think they had found each other, then realized they were mistaken when the first of their marks settled, and the other’s didn’t.
Svetlana leaned forward, breaking the line, to take a look at her brother. With an aggravated sigh, she flicked her wand at him, and the red robes straightened immediately. She might have even shrinked them a little, if Antoniy’s grimace as he tugged at his collar was any indication. Svetlana had a bit of a vindictive streak.
That evening the Cup gave the names of the Champions.
“So modest,” Weasley muttered, rolling his eyes.
“Hey, mine could be anyone at Hogwarts,” Ron shrugged.
Draco loves his parents. He really does.
Finally, Draco gets to Hogwarts.
Despite her being three years older, and Harry’s rather moderate height, she wasn’t much taller than him. She did have a surprising amount of strength, though, and took Harry by surprise. He got himself dragged almost to the end of the corridor before he reacted and dug his heels in.
“Oh,” Harry said, awkward. “Then… What did she say?”
The elbow Harry sent into his side reminded him that he might have gone for a more diplomatic reaction – and damn, if the kid didn’t have some sharp angles on that body of his – but really, he had been too surprised to rein himself in. Weasley turned beetroot red at his remark, and between the hair, the freckles and the appalling maroon colour of his dress robes, that made for a deeply unflattering picture.
Harry could feel his face burn, from his throat to the root of his hair, in a mix of deep embarrassment and anger. Was he really that obvious about his crushes? First Ron, now Draco, was the whole school aware of who he fancied, for heaven’s sake?
Draco twisted his upper body to look at him where he laid on the grass. The sun was on his back, with the greyish light of early December colouring his hair even lighter than usual, and Harry couldn’t make out his features properly.
“I wouldn’t understand?” he repeated in a low voice. “Don’t you think I should be the judge of that? Of course I don’t have any chance of understanding anything if I don’t have any explanation!”
in her country, and simply braided her long hair as a crown around her head. The overall effect was quite impressive, but, as she told them, quite sober compared to some of her most elaborate dresses back at home.
“The Ministry believes it can foster some international cooperation, and has been taking numerous measures to ensure the safety of the audience,” Lucius answered with a severe gaze.
"It does, doesn't it?"
“Remind me to wear steel-reinforced boots for the ball,” he winced when Harry once again tried to include a fourth step into the basic box set of the Viennese Waltz and stomped on his two last toes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, it worked, didn’t it?” he said, sniffing.
“How come no one knows where Durmstrang is located, though? The students must know, surely?” Harry continued. “How do you even hide a school?”
But for all his contradictory remarks to her, Harry could see how Ron started to shift uneasily when he saw the way the younger Slytherins scampered every time Moody rounded a corner. Once, the younger Greengrass girl almost rammed into them on her way out of the old Auror’s classroom. Her eyes looked moist and her lower lip was trembling despite her best efforts to control it. The kid was short and cute and the picture of wounded innocence, and Harry felt his heart squeeze at her sight. Ron never stood a chance.
“Ve’re going to figure out vy Drasha is acting like such a lunatic,” she said. “He should be in the potions lab at zat time, since he vasn’t in the library.”
“Well, I told him, didn’t I?” the guy replied. “You’d think he’s the one who’s lived in Britain his whole life, the way he went on about how we needed to be ready for the wilderness of Hogwarts. Like it ever gets as cold as Durmstrang here.”
“Well, you’ve got me, obviously,” he said with a grin. “And I’m the superior dancer in this whole school, teachers and foreign students included.”
“Yeah, and we’ll be lucky to see snow in January here. Oh, just take it off, Svetlana,” the boy snapped, snatching the girl’s hat off her head.
Draco neglected to answer this, but the words filled him with indignation. He had never been anything other than the dutiful son they had wanted him to be, never stepped out of line, and never voiced his opinion about their outdated views on blood purity, though at least Narcissa knew he no longer shared them as fully as she wished.
“And what
Thank to those who left kudos and commented on previous chapters.
“Vell, dragons are pretty hard to hide,” Svetlana pointed out. “And aren’t Hufflepuffs supposed to be all about fairness and loyalty? Maybe he told Harry?”
“I know,” he said before thinking, then promptly swore at himself.
“Not at all? Since ze holidays?” Rasputin repeated, pushing her hair behind her shoulder thoughtfully. “I zought… Zen vere is he disappearing every evening?”
"We need to talk," he said, arms crossed.
Harry cheered avidly when Cedric’s name came out for Hogwarts, jumping to his feet with the rest of the Gryffindor table as Hufflepuff gave a huge hurrah. Cedric stood, laughing and golden, and waved at everyone as he made his way to the room where the Champions were to gather.
“That sounds good,” Viktor said which, in Viktor-speak, meant he was extremely impressed.
There's only one rule to remember about Durmstrang, as far as Draco is concerned: it's always Rasputin's fault.
“No,” he sighed. “No, this is not what I’m saying.”
Draco was sixteen. Had he not been attending Durmstrang, and soulmarked, Narcissa would have started setting up things during her tea parties to put word about that the Malfoy Heir had started looking. The absence of school breaks at Durmstrang would have pushed things back till he finished his seventh year, but there was nothing to be done about the soulmark, really. No well-bred pureblood would start the lengthy courtship process with an unsettled mark. It was not done.
“What?” Draco said.
But they all did throw a surreptitious glance to the Slytherin table, where no Parkinson could be found. Then again, neither Zabini nor Greengrass, with whom she usually hung out, were in attendance either. It could mean nothing at all, or it could mean that Moody’s victim had been one of the three. Their combined absence could mean that Parkinson was sulking it out in the dungeons, or that she had indeed gotten hurt and the others were keeping her company in the infirmary.
“Maybe because she’s shocked by the fact that someone, supposedly a responsible adult, was allowed to do this to her?” Hermione shot back. “She’s just as human as any of us, she can get scared and hurt, too.”
“I’ll have you know, Ronald Weasley,” Hermione said really, really sweetly. “That I already have a partner to the ball.”
“Library,” Viktor said curtly.
He nodded.
“I don’t kiss my friends,” he settled for.
“I had a blast,” Cedric said with a large grin, and, okay, Harry really wanted to see Draco, but damn, that face was still making him light-headed. “You look like you haven’t slept much, though.”
“What were you talking about?” Draco asked, his voice harsh. “You looked awfully chummy.”
Then the owls came, and it all went to shit.
“Oh,” Harry said, shifting on his feet. “Oh, er. I actually got a partner.”
“What?” Draco bit out. “Don’t like to be reminded of the truth, Potter?”
“Are you really mocking Viktor for having a crush on a Hogvarts fourz year? Really, Drasha? Zat’s a bit rich, coming from you.”
“Too many magical beasts, they’re afraid the students would get hurt.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco was happy to see his parents. He was. Yet he couldn’t fully delude himself into thinking that there was not a small part of him, in the background of his mind, that thought about going back to Hogwarts a bit earlier, maybe just one or two days, not too much. He wouldn’t do it, obviously, it wouldn’t do to appear too eager, and his mother would be so disappointed. He hated it so when that happened.
“Merlin, what’s with you and that sudden campaign for Slytherins? Fancy one of them, do you?”
“Oh, hey, Cedric,” Harry said, throwing a glance toward the ship. “How are you?”
But Hogwarts it was, which pretty much ensured his partner to be a crony of Dumbledore’s or someone wholly unconnected: after all, Draco had been introduced as a kid to all the people in Hogwarts who could be considered good company, and his mark had never manifested.
It was a complete lie. Harry had thought he might ask Cho for the Yule Ball, and when he had finally screwed up the courage, it had only been to see her walking hand in hand with his co-Champion. He had almost faceplanted in his hurry to flee the area, and a lot of people had witnessed it, including Draco and Ron. Ron also teased him a bit about it, but it didn’t have the same undercurrent of meanness that when Draco did it: the Durmstrang student almost seemed angry about it, while Ron simply empathized, since he had not found a partner either yet.
Harry really had no answer to this one, if his best friend really did not realize what he had said wrong, so he didn’t say anything and shrugged.
They had dessert, and Harry had a hard time choosing which ones to try: on that front he had no hesitation about testing everything, and it all proved immensely good. Treacle tart remained his favourite nonetheless, though he only managed one small piece after stuffing himself with so much food.
“Oh, him? That’s Lucius Malfoy. He’s some big shot in the Ministry, and in the Board of Governors, I think. Old pureblood family, a bit too obsessed with it. Everyone knows he was a Death Eater, but he managed to get himself out of trouble by pretending he had been controlled by You-Know-Who,” he whispered. “He even sent his son to Durmstrang, because apparently Hogwarts is not good enough for dear Draco. Not enough Dark Arts, you see. Well rid of him, we are. That git’s probably spoiled beyond belief, and he would have been a Slytherin, no doubt. Look at his mum going about him.”
So he had taken to spending a lot of time hiding out on the grounds with Draco.
Draco resented that. He was the very picture of an angel, and her ready acceptance of Antoniy’s accusation was perfectly unfair, in his opinion.
For a wild moment, he thought about taking Hermione, and being done with it. It even made sense: Draco was friends with Viktor, and could very well have been taken for him, rather than for Harry. Viktor would sorely miss Draco, not Harry. He had been working so hard on not missing him anymore, after all.
“Get lost, Rasputin,” Draco snapped, still busy scanning the Gryffindor table for the dark mess of Harry’s hair. He would even have settled for Granger’s mane, but no such luck, and there were simply too many Weasleys to trust any sightings of a ginger. “They can’t simply stop eating just to spite me,” he mumbled, stabbing into his meat.
“Of course I do not want you to participate in it,” his father said, his voice dripping with disdain. “We are Malfoys, we do not need such pageantry to assess our worth. You are too young, anyway. One of the conditions for Dumbledore to agree to the scheme was that all participants be of age. Karkaroff was very difficult about letting you be on the delegation even though you are not old enough to be selected. I had to twist his arm a little.”
This chapter's a bit angsty around the middle and ends up quite fluffy.
“Blimey, look at that one,” Seamus said under his breath, and whistled softly. Harry followed his glance and spotted an older version of the girl he had just seen, silvery-blonde, tall and willowy, who had apparently gathered the interest of quite a few of the boys. “Got a drop of Veela blood, she sure does.”
Well, Harry was embarrassed. Draco was considering if he could get away with it.
Their fourth year started with two announcements that Harry felt very ambivalent about. Sure, that Triwizard tournament sounded grand, but did they really have to cancel the Quidditch Cup for this? What were they all supposed to do while the three Champions prepared for their Tasks, just watch them? They could have played against Beauxbatons’ and Durmstrang’s teams, too! Such a waste of a great opportunity.
“I know, Mother,” he said.
They were sitting by the lake, and Draco had cast a warming charm on Harry that was much longer-lasting than his owns. It was also much more delicately balanced, in that Harry could somehow feel the sharp coldness of the air at the tip of his nose and on his cheeks, but he was comfortably toasty everywhere else. It felt like coming in from a snow day and lounging in front of the common room fireplace, and Draco said that was the only proper way to enjoy warming charms.
Harry personally thought the most obvious explanation was probably the right one, and that his best friends shared the bond, but he had never voiced the opinion. If it was, they would come to the conclusion in their own time, and if they didn’t, better not to take the risk to create awkward situations. For all that Hermione claimed they were not always linked to romantic feelings, it did get tricky on that front anyway.
the uneducated ape. At least I know how to behave myself in public.”
“No. The delegations will only come to Hogwarts at the end of October, and Karkaroff was most insistent you return to Durmstrang as per usual.”
And he knew Viktor would acquit himself honorably, whatever those sadictic organizers had in store for them, but he didn’t exactly feel the same sanguine confidence for Harry. The boy was only fourteen, Merlin’s beard, and the Tournament was notorious for the grievous injuries sustained by its past participants. Potter deserved a little help, was all that Draco was saying.
“Vot?” Viktor asked, bewildered.
“Dumbledore may be a fool,” his father said, “but there is no denying that many professors at Hogwarts are extremely competent. Maybe Severus will have time to tutor you, with any luck.”
Harry debated running away, but he wasn’t sure he could withstand the humiliation. Plus, he didn’t trust himself not to faceplant, and that would the cherry on top of the shite pie his life had been for the past two days. He walked faster, but Malfoy had the advantage of longer legs and not hesitating in taking this into a run.
This year, though, Draco had managed to force one sixth year and two seventh years into listening to the whole speech, just so they would not miss the announcement he had hinted at. That took some skill – and prior access to prime information – and he would be sure to brag about it at the Political club later. The club had a standing tradition of trying to trick other students into uncomfortable or humourous situations without ever lying, and this would put him in a good position to win this year’s contest. Older students were worth more points, as they all knew about the competition, and most of them had identified the members of the club, so they took extra care around them. Getting Svetlana, the current president of the club, was a crowning achievement, and Draco had managed it on the very first day. He would no longer be able to compete after the end of October, so he had to give it its best effort until then.
Svetlana saved the day – and probably any chance Draco might have entertained he had with Harry Potter as well – before the Weasel could step forward and clock Draco in the face as he so obviously wanted to.
“I guess so,” Harry trailed uncertainly. “Doesn’t Viktor Krum goes to Durmstrang, though?”
“Chess?” Harry proposed, and was glad to see Ron’s relieved smile at the offer. “Isn’t that new Defense professor weird, though?”
The last quote from sadfishkid's illustration of Durmstrang!Draco is coming up next chapter, and peeps, I can't wait for you to see it. There's so much flirting and so much awkwardness, I love my little disaster bi Harry.
change?” his mother repeated, with a raised eyebrow.
Viktor did spend a reasonable amount of time in the library at Durmstrang, as any top student tended to do, but he had never been a full on library rat. Two days ago he had even rejected Draco’s offer to go for a fly in favor of books, of all things. Draco had had to go one on one against Potter in a seeker’s game, and the kid had absolutely whooped his ass at it. He even had had the gall to laugh at Draco’s lack of skill at spotting the – incredibly tiny and fast, Draco wished to point out – snitch, like everyone could be genius teenage seekers like him and Krum. At least he hadn’t been brooding in silence about all the woes in his life, which had been really tiring on Draco, really, what with all the negativity, and that was the only reason he had let Potter snort at him without retaliation.
Ah! Antoniy would just die of jealousy when he told him.
“Of course we don’t,” she replied with an impatient jerk of the head. “But there is no need to be a subscriber, when such news come out.”
To Draco’s great surprise and relief, Harry’s dress robes had a nice cut, and were a deep bottle green color that did wonderful things for his skin tone and eyes. If he had been the one to pick them, he might have gone for something slightly less European in style. Anita Lulla would revolutionize the fashion scene in India given some time, in Draco’s not at all humble opinion – he had great taste, thank you very much.
“Nine,” Antoniy said. “Draco’s father got him a spot, just so he can see his precious family this year. Poor Drasha can’t spend a year away from his mother and father, you see.”
Ron visibly deflated.
“Yes, Ron, how astute of you to notice that,” Hermione said in an artic tone.
By their first week of classes, a rumour was going around the school that he had transfigured a Slytherin student into a toad and bounced them up and down to punish them for trying to hex a student, and had been told off by McGonagall. The reports differed as to which Slytherin it had been, though Ron leant towards Pansy Parkinson, who did have a tendency to go for stinging hexes in the back. No one would confirm, though, and certainly not Parkinson herself.
“No, I mean, I knew, but it’s not what’s important now,” he said dismissively, like he was chosing each of his word very carefully to snip at Hermione’s every last nerve. “It means you could go with me to the ball.”
Peace, it appeared, was incredibly short-lived at Hogwarts, Draco discovered the very morning following the Second Task. He had barely been able to bask into the satisfaction of resolving things with Harry, and resolving them quite magnificiently, if he did say so himself, when things quickly devolved into utter chaos.
“Trade secret,” Draco said, reaching for some potato and beef stew.
“You do realize that Hogwarts is hidden as well? Seriously, you should really know at least this about your own school,” Hermione sighed. “Otherwise, we would get muggles wandering around the grounds all the time. The difference is that Durmstrang is even hidden to wizards, and only students and teachers can see it. I think they’ve even got a special way to get there, so that there is no way to track the location by following the people being transported. The books were a bit unclear about this, though.”
And he swooped down and pressed his lips against Harry’s cheekbone. They were soft and delicate, lingering for one, two seconds against Harry’s skin before retreating.
He heard Draco exhale slowly.
And he did, amazingly. He did more than fine, he did magnificiently.
His parents had probably never entertained the idea that his heir could be connected to anything less than a pureblood, or, in an extremety, to a half-blood, and would accept his partner if they fit these categories – Draco shuddered to think of what would happen should his soulmarked be muggleborn or, Merlin forbade, a muggle. If his partner was a woman, he would probably be allowed to marry them, should they feel like it, but a man would never do: you couldn’t produce an heir with a man. You did not marry a man, just like you did not marry women from low social standing: at most, you set them up in a nice little house and visited them quietly after the birth of your first child, while your wife turned a blind eye to it.
Harry nodded.
Draco wants to find Harry, which only serves to make it very evident that Harry doesn't want to be found.
“I don’t think I fancy making a joke of myself trying to speak French,” Ron groaned, plopping down into one of the sofas of the common room. “And what language do they even speak in Durmstrang? No one even knows where it is.”
“Well, get on with it. If you’re not back in the Tower in ten minutes, you’ll get a detention,” she said, walking away. “And Mr Potter?” she added over her shoulder. “I will know.”
Viktor said nothing, but Draco could see the idea intrigued him. Perhaps it was not nice of him to sick him on a fourteen year-old, but Draco played Chaser himself, and couldn’t very well challenge Harry Potter to a seeker’s match.
His nervousness rose as his wish that Draco wouldn’t go intensified in an inversely proportionate manner to the distance to the gate, and as the window of time became shorter to give him his gift.
Diggory went first, against a Swedish Short-Snout. He took one look around him, spotted a large rock, and transfigured it into a dog. It started barking and jumping wildly at the dragon, who turned her large head to consider this new addition with narrowed eyes and fuming nostrils. Meanwhile, Diggory sneaked around her, careful not to touch the tailwhich curled protectively around the nest as he bent to retrieve the golden egg. He drew back, and was almost far enough to bolt out of the arena, when something must have caught the dragon’s attention, because she swiveled around, spotted him with the egg, and breathed flames at him. A great gasp went over the stands, but Diggory had the excellent reflexes of a Quidditch player, and he jumped sideways, rolling to the floor out of the arena, the egg still clutched in his arms. When he got up, they could see that the side of his face had been burnt, but it was nothing that a good Healer couldn’t fix. He was done with his first Task.
Well, sure, she was beautiful, but not enough to act like a fool, in Harry’s opinion. He exchanged a glance with Hermione, who rolled her eyes and shrugged, mouthing a very judgmental “boys” at him. Sometimes he wondered if she remembered that he was one, too.
"I think you said more than I care to hear," Harry replied, unable to keep the bitterness out of his voice even after weeks of mulling over their last conversation, or maybe because of it.
“Once again, Drasha. Supposed to cheer for our Champion, remember?” Svetlana sighed beside him.
Rasputin watched him with a considering look and took a step back, releasing him.
And that was his first impression of Draco Malfoy. Then there was a Wronski feint, a Snitch caught by the losing team, a celebration, an attack and a Dark Mark in the sky. It was all a big mess, and Harry forgot all about Draco Malfoy.
“Yeah, but you got pinned by Blacklund, so I figured you weren’t paying attention,” she said.
“Not when,” here she paused, unsure. “Not when you are as well,” she finished, her face set.
But as soon as he made a move towards Hermione, there was a merperson barring his way, without menace but with unmistakable firmness. Harry gestured angrily towards his best friend, but no, the merperson shook her head and pointed at Draco, then at him.
His worries about Sirius might have returned despite all the convenient distraction the arrival of the delegations provided, but their last class, the one that would be shortened so the whole school could stand in rows and try to look like actual teenagers rather than wild animals – those had been McGonagall’s exact words during Transfiguration – was Potions. There was no greater happiness than a shorter Potions class, and nothing could dim it, especially when Snape had been in such a foul mood and threatened left and right to poison someone so they could learn the importance of brewing antidotes properly. Harry thought he might even be able to use the memory for a Patronus. He would have to try that.
“Draco dear,” his mother said in a soft voice. “He is no friend of the Dark Lord, which makes him unlikely to feel much sympathy for us.”
"Yes," Harry managed, though he rather thought
“We can’t be too careful,” Narcissa said. “With Sirius Black’s escape last year, and the Dark Mark appearing this summer, everyone at the Ministry has been on their toes.”
“I’ve never been on it, you know, we get to Durmstrang by boat, obviously,” he said when Harry asked why. “And my parents both went to Hogwarts, both to Slytherin, obviously,” which Harry was more than ready to believe. He might like Draco, but it was Draco the foreign student from abroad, whom he hadn’t any past with, or any strong impression on other than what the older boy projected. Harry wasn’t sure they would have been on good terms had they met in Hogwarts, in the middle of the intense inter-House rivalry that opposed the Gryffindors and the Slytherins.
“Have you ever been told your bedside manner sucks?” Harry said, raising his head to glare at him.
Harry had loved last night, which had quite reconciled him with the concept of balls altogether. He had also been hoping for a nice and lengthy discussion with the reason he had spent such a good time, but it was already going on ten and Cedric was making him late. Well, later than he already was.
Harry shivered.
It lasted all but a moment, though, before he was suddenly yanked away from her, and he heard Draco's voice, cold as ice, above his head.
Draco really should have seen that one coming. He had know the kid was clueless, after all, a walking disaster, even.
Hermione rolled her eyes at him and only mouthed the words
“There are few things quite as disagreeable as learning things you ignored about your own son through other people’s mouths,” Narcissa agreed, with a slight incline of her head. “Rest assured, though, we do not disapprove.”
“He knew,” Draco whispered, watching as the Hufflepuff was led out of the stadium.
He caught sight of a pair of Slytherins six years, down a few seats from them: the journal was the Daily Prophet, which no one read at Durmstrang, and certainly didn’t receive with their morning mail, and under it there was a picture of Harry trudging through the lake with Gabrielle Delacour.
He neatly sidestepped Harry’s pinching fingers.
Svetlana pointed at the badge he was sporting on the breast of his uniform, who alternatively blinked
“Do not let your students freeze, Olympe,” Dumbledore said with a gesture towards the castle. “Let them get inside before they turn into popsicles.”
“Great, so I’ll be the only one staying here,” Antoniy said mulishly.
Harry saw his friend’s face close itself at that remark, and knew there was no way this conversation would end up in a nice manner, but Ron was already launched.
“You can figure it out by yourself,” Harry said. “It’s no concern of mine.”
“You said you had been forced,” he hissed, feeling as if he had been immerged in some burning hot liquid. “You said you had been Imperius-ed.”
“I… did,” Draco grimaced. “But then we resumed it.”
He followed Harry’s example and laid down as well, on his side, his head propped up on one hand so he could watch Harry. The scrutiny made Harry feel uneasy, like his skin was too tight against his face; he barely restrained himself from squirming.
“So vat about Harry Potter?” Svetlana asked. “Ve’re all very interested in him.”
Draco snorted, which owed him Svetlana’s elbow in the ribs.
“Excuse me for being a little vexed at being ignored in favor of flirting with Mr Bright-Smile Diggory,” Draco said, crossing his arms.
“What do you need a thousand galleons for?” Draco asked. “Your family is filthy rich.”
Oh yes, the rage was back alright.
That said, she stormed off the common room to her dormitory, leaving Ron sputtering in fury. He turned to Harry, his anger leaving place to bewilderment.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry would have begged to differ on that point, because Dobby had not hesitated to put him in some quite dangerous situations when he thought it would save his life two years before. In this case, though, he could only agree with Ron: there was nothing apparently dangerous about the gillyweed, and it would avoid Harry drowning or standing like a fool on the shore while the other Champions went on with their Task. Even Hermione could see no reason not to follow the house-elf's instructions.
So Draco had quickly understood it was better to keep his mouth shut about his family. It was accepted, even encouraged, to brag about your own accomplishments in Durmstrang, but using your family name was considered to be in bad taste. People from similarly great backgrounds already knew about it, and did not care, and those from less fortunate circumstances either didn’t know the difference, or envied you.
Harry was still a bit disoriented when he stepped into the common room one hour later, and found Ginny trying to comfort a shaken Ron.
The idea of Karkaroff being so disliked he drove his students to the very opposite set of values he wanted to teach them is just amusing me beyond belief.
Viktor must have sensed the danger, because he left it at that, and prompty walked away. And right before Draco spotted the bushy mass of hair of Potter’s muggleborn friend disappearing through the Great Hall’s doors – what was her name already? She had even sat in the stands once during one of their friendly games, reading an enormous book – too, the spoilsport.
No one could care about the minutiae of ancient enchantments as much as Svetlana Rasputin, anyway. If you let her, she would talk your ear off for hours, and keep at it even if you fell facedown in your soup bowl from boredom. Draco had learned early on to prevent such diatribes by expressing his disinterest loud and clear.
"Gabrielle!" he heard amidst splashing, and he could see Fleur running into the lake towards them.
He was shaking his head before he realized it.
Hermione shushed him, leaning forward to catch Dumbledore’s greetings. The man, who could only be Durmstrang’s headmaster, didn’t stand as much on ceremony as Madam Maxime had – and the way she pursed her lips at his familiar handshake, she did not approve. His name was Igor Karkaroff, he spoke about dear old Hogwarts like he knew the castle, and immediately asked if they could get inside and warm themselves up, Viktor had a delicate constitution.
That had been another hard lesson: his father’s name did not carry much weight in Durmstrang. There, Lucius Malfoy was nothing more than a foreign dignitary, one who knew Karkaroff well, to be sure, but with no particular power other than that. Oh yes, he was from the Sacred Twenty-Eight of Britain, but that did not mean much. After all, half the students carried their own pedigree: for example, Draco’s roommate starting from his third year, and his older sister a year above them, were Rasputins. Their grandfather had been a prominent figure of Imperial Russia, as well known across the world as Merlin himself, though perhaps not in quite as positive a light.
The whole ball passed much too fast. He liked such occasions, in the first place, but in this instance he could even venture to say that this was the best time he had had in such a context so far. Even the few occasions where they had to stay in Weasley’s general scowling vicinity couldn’t spoil the evening, and even his dark mood diminished when Granger gushed of how sweet he had been to take the small Delacour to the ball and to dance with her. It did not make the Weasel agreeable by any kind of measure, but he did cut down on the scowls and the glares back to his usual amount. Since he was now sharing his disdain between Draco and Viktor, they only got each half the quantity that had been so far exclusively reserved to Draco, so this new arrangement satisfied Draco greatly.
“Just something about the second task,” Harry mumbled.
Harry shot him a betrayed look.
The only problems with that arose during the summer holidays. Draco had not become a muggle lover by any stretch of the imagination, but he had never been much of a people lover in the first place, pureblood or otherwise.
Draco. Merlin take the git, Harry liked him.
After all, he had been raised muggle, and soulmarks were, if not extremely rare, at least not so common that people spoke about them incessantly. He had not made the link between the vague grey mark and the tales he had heard in the Gryffindor common room. Plus, Parvarti and Lavande were particularly fond of romance novels which focused on the theme, and somehow, he hadn’t felt that the plots they described between giggles represented anything to strive or wish for. Hermioned always clicked her tongue when the two girls went on about that particular subject. It was no secret that she considered the misrepresentation of soulmarks in literature a personal, and grievous, offense.
“Not formal dances. Not mine.”
Harry closed his eyes and leaned into the caress, so Draco followed the arch of the boy’s cheek with his hand until he got to the edge of the scarf and tugged it down to uncover Harry’s mouth, which he gave a quick kiss.
“I know,” Draco said, because he did. His dress robes were made of fairyworms silk and had been hand-tailored by Kognok and sons, a goblin shop so exclusive his parents had booked his appointments before he was even born. He looked more than nice, he looked perfect. Even Svetlana could not find anything to fault with his appearance: even the lack of color in his outfit was compensated by the obvious quality of the costume.
"Okay?" Draco repeated, raising his eyes back to him and pinning him with an intense look. "Really?"
The black kid had dropped his projectile, and his victim yelped and stood up, squirming to get rid of whatever squishy, sticky substance had gone down his back. In the ensuing mess, Draco met the eyes of that last Gryffindor boy he had noticed, vivid green against the brown skin, as he leaned away from the wild moves of his classmate with a wild laugh. This caused his hair to shift, the curls sliding to the side and parting to reveal the lightning bolt scar on his forehead, at the exact moment when Draco realized he had seen this boy before, in a high room over a stadium full of screaming supporters.
“He’ll do fine.”
Harry kept his eyes stubbornly fixed to the ground. It proved to be a mistake, because Draco took it upon himself to place his hand under his chin, and softly raise his head until their eyes met. Harry didn't say anything, couldn't even if he had wanted to. He couldn't watch away, either, because Draco was looking at him with such intent, serious and sad.
in Hufflepuff colors and
“Nozing,” she said. “Zeir translation spell is messing viz our accents and Drasha zinks it is all very droll.”
“Four months, Draco,” Lucius said during dinner on Draco’s third day back. “And you only see fit to tell us now?”
. It’s a great place, you should go and enjoy it. Take the egg with you, have a nice long bath with it. You’ll see, it will help,” he said.
“Good,” Harry said, smiling at him, which, unfair, much? “I think they’re calling us for the first dance,” he added, making a face.
He had also tried it. The first two had been returned unopened. The third one had spontaneously combusted and left a scorched mark on his bedspread after a snowy owl had dropped it off on it. He supposed he had Granger to thank for that neat little curse. She had a vindictive side that could rival Svetlana’s, and the bloody menace had once tried to poison one of their professors for giving her what she felt was an underserved low mark on an exam. It was par for the course at Durmstrang, of course, and had gotten her the desired bump up, since their Potions professor had found the antidote to the poison Svetlana brewed “almost challenging”. Draco still thought back on the incident fondly, since he had been the one to help Svetlana design the poison, what with being leagues ahead of her in the art.
“It’s not settled, yet,” he muttered.
So he resigned himself: either Draco would come around, and tell him what happened, or Harry would just let it go. They hadn’t been in a relationship, after all, and it was obvious Draco regretted what little things they had done together. Whatever. It wasn’t like he cared, anyway.
“Plus, if she was, how come she’s not raising a big stink about this?” Ron said, pointing his fork at Hermione. “She would never pass up the opportunity to cause trouble for a Hogwarts professor.”
Lucius frowned mightily at him, but Narcissa laid a long-fingered hand on his forearm and said: “We understand, dear. We are just worried about you. This timing is most unfortunate.”
The majority of Hogwarts students had taken to wearing badges which switched between
The First Task is dragons. Draco really has to wonder about the sanity of all the organizers of this bloody tournament.
This is what uncooperative characters look like. I had planned this fic as light-hearted and fun, mostly, then Draco decided he had to be a drama queen.
This could be subtitled: Draco has a strop.
He had gone back to the Tower, ignored Ron and Hermione’s concerned questions, and fallen face first into his bed. When he had heard Ron coming up to check on him, he had closed his curtains and spelled them with a strong
“What is this event anyway?” he asked, releasing his mother’s hand. She looked a bit disappointed at the loss, and Draco felt a pang of remorse, but she then gestured at the house elf to serve the food, and that had been his goal, after all. He dug into his food – coq-au-vin, Mother always had it served when she felt happy – with relish.
“Ask who?” he said morosely, putting his chin on his knees.
“That was your big secret?” his roommate whispered furiously, and loud enough that they’d probably end up with detention. Or he would, Draco would have no compunction about pushing him off the broom if the need arised. “A deathly tournament that you’ll take part in.”
Harry stopped. It took Draco a few meters to realize the fact, and when he did, he threw a furious glare at Harry, who couldn’t help but take a step back.
Which was very much not an apology. Harry hadn’t expected one, exactly, because he knew by now that Draco didn’t really
“I really do not have anything for you, though,” the Durmstrang boy said, considering Harry and tapping his index against his cheek thoughtfully. “Ah! How about this?”
Draco could only gape at her as she swept away to join the seventh year Slytherins for their Advanced Charms class.
“Zeir translation spell is horrible”, Svetlana said as the Durmstrang delegation made its way in the castle and they all started to realize that if their comrades sounded so strange to their ears, then they probably did as well. “I don’t even vant to know vat I sound like to you.”
“The grounds are not, and the forest on the edge is forbidden to the students,” Draco said, who had read it in Hogwarts: a History when he still thought he would attend.
Harry’s robes he had already seen, obviously, and nothing else in his appearance could hold any surprise. He might have tried to tame down his hair, but with the wild riot of his curls, it was always difficult to tell.
Then he left, though the sensation of him, and the smell of him, remained with Harry for a long time afterwards.
“Sorry I took it out on you,” he sighed, running his hand through his hair. “I’ve just been having a really crappy couple of days.”
“What happened?” he asked, exchanging a glance with Hermione, who was sitting on another sofa.
“And you still believe in this nonsense? That the Dark Lord will somehow come and restore the purebloods to their former glory? He is dead, dead and gone!” Draco laughed, feeling a bit hysterical.
He spun on his heels and stalked away, blinking his eyes fiercely to keep the angry tears at bay.
Just like that, Harry’s embarassement disappeared, and rage replaced it.
“Yes, Drasha, zat. You spent half ze evening spelling zat zing to be as visually loud as possible yesterday. You’re not fooling anyone.”
Draco looked stricken, and lurched forward to grab Harry’s arm, but Harry neatly sidestepped him.
, burnt off, but he was pretty sure that had to do with the judges playing favorites.
“No, that’s not it,” he frowned, taking another look around the Hall.
“Yeah, and Voldemort went to Hogwarts,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes again. “Seriously, Ron, don’t you think it’s a bit easy to put them all in the same bag? We’re not all dark wizards here, they have no more reason to be at Durmstrang.”
“I just like a good competition,” he said, shrugging.
“You’re a pig,” Hermione informed him. “I stand by what I said. The professors shouldn’t be allowed to punish us in ways that could hurt us. What would you have said if she had ended up with broken bones, or dead?”
After that, that awful article by Rita Skeeter about Hagrid had come out, and Harry had had other things to worry about: it took him one week to realize that he had not seen hair nor hide from Draco Malfoy since that hug on the platform.
"Fair warning," the Durmstrang boy said, some of the more usual undertones seeping back into the smile, as his hand crept closer to Harry's neck, his second one finding a place on his hip. "I'm going to kiss you."
“I swear, Ron,” Hermione exclaimed, throwing her hands up. “Sometimes you’re just as bigoted as the ones saying my blood’s dirty. You just don’t want to see it.”
“Do you even know how to dance?” Draco asked, idly tracing rounds of smoke with his wand.
Draco was always glad to see he could count on his so-called friends to betray him. At least he knew where they stood.
“So you don’t know,” she surmised.
For now, his soulmark looked like a vague shadowy form, of something that could be an animal with a sort of halo around his head, if you squinted at it. But it had looked that way ever since the summer, and not moved an inch since. Draco did not expect it to, had never expected it too: he was unlikely to go through the kind of spectacular events needed for a settling at school.
“Where did you even get the idea I meant it as a friend?” he asked, pushing that damned curl back and trailing his thumb over that lightning scar in the same movement.
“Like you have a very strong russian accent,” Draco said.
“You do know you’re supposed to cheer for our champion, not Hogvarts’?” Svetlana said as she installed herself on the other side of the Slytherin table.
“They’re muggle,” Harry said.
“Is he a good seeker?” Viktor asked, because of course that was the question that came to his mind first.
“So?” Draco asked.
“Sorry? I didn’t quite catch that,” Draco said, raising an eyebrow.
He had never been so glad to be a native English speaker. The other students sounded completely different than they used to at Durmstrang.
"I just hope it's not the Firebolt," Harry said.
“Your mother has requested a private audience with you with,” here Severus paused, just slightly enough that it was almost imperceptible, yet expressed his immense disapproval as loud as if he had rung a great bell, “some urgency. As such, I will leave you the private use of the chimney in my office, right after the last class tonight, so you may conduct a floo call with her.”
Ah. There laid the crux of the matter, of course. This was something Draco understood pretty well: Mad-Eye Moody had proven to be paranoid and not above considering the crimes of the father as the ones of the son, during classes. His attitude had left little doubt that, if he caught so much as a whiff of illegality from either Draco or his father, he would find immense pleasure in sending either of them to Azkaban. His exact words had been “better to take the whole tree out, when the roots are so rotten”, if Draco recalled correctly. And he had an excellent memory, especially for threat.
Harry played with the edge of his sleeves, eyes darting everywhere but towards Ron.
“That’s definitely a soulmark, mate,” Ron said, gesturing at Harry’s hip.
“So’s yours, and I don’t think you’d spit on a thousand galleons, would you?” Antoniy shot back.
. “And you want me to participate in this?”
“See? I knew you wouldn’t understand,” Draco sighed, trailing his hand through his – neat, always so neat, but not slicked back today – hair. “You don’t know what it is, growing up with parents like this. I can’t do this to them, it’s too dangerous.”
“Really? You lucky bastard, that’s so unfair! So I’m the only one without a date, is that it?” Ron exclaimed. “So who is it?”
“I’m fine, Mother,” Draco sighed, kneeling before the hearth.
“Great,” the Hufflepuff said. “Did you enjoy yourself last night?”
“They are reinstating the Triwizard Tournament this year,” Lucius said. Draco almost choked on a potato.
didn't quite cover the sensation.
“You shouldn’t have,” the Durmstrang boy said. “I didn’t get you anything.”
“If Vincent had not tried to rip one of the beast’s feathers, he would not have been injured at all,” Blaise sniffed. “And you only believe that because you don’t want to believe that Potter’s godfather is a mass murderer.”
Harry had fled the lab as soon as he had been able to push Draco off him after that, ignoring the damage he had caused. Draco could deal with it, for all he cared. The corridor had been empty: evidently Rasputin had assumed they would be mature enough to actually talk it out without needing her supervision. She had been wrong, about pretty much everything.
“Will I be going to Hogwarts directly?”
“I- I don’t know what came over me,” he wailed, pushing his hands into his hair wildly. “She was just there, and she was so pretty, and I couldn’t help myself!”
Harry fled.
“Hey, Harry!” Cedric Diggory said, with his easy smile.
He was almost to the ship, in front of which a few students mingled, the red uniforms of Durmstrang mixed with Hogwarts’ black robes, most trimmed with green – the Slytherins had taken to the foreign wizards quite well – and even the blue set of one Beauxbatons boy. But a superior power hated him, apparently, because he was waylaid before he could reach his goal, with a hand on his shoulder to stop him.
He could feel Antoniy stewing furiously at his side, and even caught Svetlana fidgeting twice from the corner of his eye. Draco might have been teasing earlier, but it was true that Antoniy had a reserve of patience that was abysmally small. As a rule, it didn’t cause too many problems, because Durmstrang’s curriculum was more than intense enough to provide him with constant stimulation, but he could rarely stand through one of Karkaroff’s speeches without ending up with a detention, and Draco had had to save many of their potions from explosion because Antoniy Rasputin had decided than seven minutes was way too long for the next stir.
Draco could see how it would be, from their point of view: he knew they had hoped for him to meet his soulmarked at Durmstrang, filled as his school was with European witches with the best pedigrees, and here he was, with a partner that, in all probability, attended the very school they had sent him away from. When she had heard about his friendship with the Rasputin siblings, Narcissa had encouraged him to meet as many as possible of their family: a soulbond with someone of the sprawling Russian family would have been a master stroke, an alliance such as the Malfoy line could only have dreamed of. They spent too much time with muggles, to be sure, but that could be ignored in the light of their political and financial influence.
Draco loved returning to the Manor for the holidays each summer.
One thing he had not anticipated, however, was how hard it would be to hide his nascent relationship with the Boy-Who-Lived from his parents. He rather thought that they would approve of the acquaintance – Harry Potter was a useful connection to have, of course – but a romantic involvement was less likely to be looked upon favorably. If Draco had not been soulmarked, that would have been one thing, but a mark changed everything. There could be no innocent flirting until his soulmarked had been identified, in Lucius and Narcissa’s mind. They had to be sure of the partner, of the bond, before Draco could be sent off courting amongst the pureblood families. There was no fighting a soulbond, only its nature: Draco was expected not to form a romantic relationship with his soulmarked if they were not of sufficiently good standing.
Harry has no idea how Dobby got his hands on gillyweed, but he's not about to look a gift horse in the mouth. At least since Hermione approved of it.
“You have stopped your relationship with the boy, have you not?”
It was common in pureblood households to raise their children bilingual. For Draco, it had been French, as the Malfoy line had originated there, and an extant branch had survived there until the revolution had uprooted them to the other side of the Channel. Spending so much time with the Rasputin siblings had taught him quite a bit of German, though, which both siblings spoke fluently. Their mother had been some sort of Bavarian Forest countess. By now, Draco could probably hold a decent conversation in German, though most of his vocabulary consisted of swear words. Russian he had given up on learning. He did remember the insults, though. Antoniy had quite the potty mouth, and the translation spell rather pointedly did not include such words.
And I have zero chill, so I had to post it immediately. Behold!
No matter what Draco has to say about it, I remain convinced that Ronald Weasley is just a sweet cinnamon roll who has a hard time dealing with his emotion. No folks, there will be zero Ron-bashing 'round those parts, I just love him so much. Actually there will be no bashing at all because I don't see the point (except, you know, between characters that don't like each other for good reasons).
“Potter? More like underfed and ungroomed,” Pansy said acidly. “It’s a wonder whether his muggles even fed him anything before he got here. Look at him, a breeze could knock him over.”
So I had three chapters written from Harry's point of view, when I suddenly decided I also wanted to present Draco's perspective.
Antoniy elbowed him once again. Draco repressed a wince and turned his head slighty to mouth a “what?” behind clenched teeth.
He was this close to stomping his foot like a kid having a tantrum – like Dudley used to do when Petunia refused to buy him the sweets he had set his eye on, really. Furious – at Draco for his words, at Cedric for causing this mess, at himself for reacting so immaturely – he stormed off in the direction of the Forbidden Forest, or Hagrid’s hut, he didn’t know. He just wanted to be away from Draco before his disappointment and rage came out like bile.
“He has it coming,” one of the girls answered. “Grimhildr takes him, I am sveating like I am cooking in furnace.”
Harry gulped and nodded, raising his eyes slowly to meet Ron’s. His best friend blinked at him a few times before an expression of horror came over his face and he launched himself back in his chair.
Harry opened his mouth to tell her – what, he didn’t know. That they had not broken up, because they had not been together? They had been something alright, even if they hadn’t discussed it. To go to hell? That would have been a viable option, except he found out she was right. He wanted to know. He rather desperately wanted to know, truth be told, and the confusion and sadness had been eating at him so much that even Ron had told him he should talk to Draco, much as he’d rather hex his face off.
“Yes,” he said. “You?”
“Plus, it’s no use worrying about it. You’ll definitely meet them and know who they are at some point. That’s sort of the point of it all,” Ron added, gesturing at Harry’s hip.
“This is of major import,” Narcissa continued.
“Yeah, my money’s on you,” Kaija said. “Sorry, Sveta.”
“I don’t think that,” the Durmstrang boy said, taking his hand back. “I just-”
“Please proceed to your classes in orderly fashion,” Dumbledore sighed, apparently as aware of how unlikely his wishes were to be obeyed as Draco was.
It was a different world, underwater. Calm and peaceful, with almost no sounds compared to the surface. The water, who always appeared dark and murky viewed from above, had a greenish quality when you swam in it, and Harry's webbed feet and hands greatly helped. A grindylow tried to stop him, but a well placed kick and a scalding hex got rid of it pretty quickly. Harry regretted not having any way to keep track of the time with him, but he still reached the village of the merpeople in what he thought would leave him with ample time to return to the surface. The village was pretty empty, and the only merpeople he crossed paths with raised their hands and hurried him further on, until he reached what must have been the main square. In the center of it, guarded by merpeople armed with spears and tridents, he easily recognized the four people tied to the tail of a statue of a merperson. The tiniest one was Gabrielle, who couldn't be anyone's but Fleur's hostage. Then he made out the face of Cho, her braided hair flotting behind her softly – but she had to be Cedric's, Harry reasoned, swimming past her. The next one, her hair a wild halo around her, was Hermione – and that had to be it, Harry thought, Hermione was the one he had to bring back, until her hair moved and he caught sight of a flash of pale blond hair and. No. He stopped dead in his tracks, but that was not the way movement worked underwater, and his previous stroke forward had had enough momentum that he was round the tail, past Hermione, and facing the closed eyes and sharp nose of Draco Malfoy. You couldn't weep underwater, Harry thought, and felt desperately grateful for. This was downright cruel.
“Yes, as friends!” Harry retorted, feeling like his face might burst.
“It’s just a birthmark,” Harry protested, and he moved to drag his trousers up to hide it.
Of course, Draco, who seemed not to understand the concept of personal space so long as it wasn’t his, followed him.
words of the House of Black. He had gone to Gryffindor, and trampled his family’s beliefs so thoroughly that Narcissa’s aunt Walburga had burnt his name off the family tree when he had run away at sixteen. It was hard to reconcile this version of Sirius Black with the image of a faithful Deatheater. An allegiance to the Dark Lord would have gotten him his place back on the tree, as well as his inheritance and, insofar as anyone knew, no such measures had been taken. Of course, it wasn’t as if anyone could go and check the tapestry, with Grimmauld Place closed to anyone since the disappearance of Regulus Black.
“Grimhildr!” she said, and clasped her hand over her mouth, her eyes bulging out. Viktor looked flabbergasted. Glancing around, Draco caught sight of numerous other students displaying similar reactions, which he guessed came mostly from pureblood families. Most of the professors’ expressions ranged from shocked to completely furious – Draco would have advised Rita Skeeter to stay out of the path of that Transfiguration professor, or all bets were off for her life.
He had found the time to dry off and clean himself up, and not a single of his hair was out of place as he frowned at Harry.
She was alright, that Granger girl, even without the added benefit of providing teasing material against Viktor.
“Hello, Dumbledoor,” she said as she shook his hand with a smile. “I didn’t remember the journey as quite so long. I am getting old.”
Soulmarks could take years to settle into a proper form, and only once they were, would the bond between the partners be effective. It always necessicated large, impactful events involving profund changes in both partners, and sometimes that took the form of life-threatening situations. Rarely, overall, but often enough that it was a major concern for his mother.
He turned his face away, bringing his hands up to hide it.
“I’m Draco Malfoy,” the boy said, trusting his hand forward.
Svetlana, that cow, declined to accompany them on what she dubbed their little double-date.
This is the last pre-written chapter I had in stock.
“What? You’ll be leaving me alone with Rasputin, Draco?” Kaija exclaimed, her hand on her heart. “How will I survive your absence?”
Yes, a descendant of Rasputin declaiming Marx is my idea of humor. You might have noticed that I'm not taking this fic 100% seriously.
“Vy?” Svetlana asked, genuinely puzzled.
He winked at the Beauxbatons students, who looked a bit nonplussed at the familiarity. They looked at their headmistress, and when she nodded, all moved at a calm pace towards the entrance, as if it wasn’t cold enough for them to hurry up. Harry watched them as they passed by: the majority of them looked like seventh years, and were probably old enough to enter their name in the competition. However, quite a few of them looked younger, and Harry even spotted a very pretty blonde girl who couldn’t be older than eleven, surely.
“You should leave,” Draco said, gesturing at the door. “I’m busy.”
“Sophie Parkinson seemed to think you had struck up a friendship with the Potter boy,” she said, watching him over the rim of her wine glass as she took a sip. “You did not say anything about that.”
“But his ideals survive him, Draco. Are you saying you’ll turn your back on us, and refuse to continue the Malfoy line, for the sake of a boy you’ve know two months?” Lucius said, leaning forward. “Will you turn your back on your own family, on so slight a pretext? We are not telling you to throw him away, Draco, we are not even telling you to stop. We simply ask that you treat this as the thing it is: a young love between immature people, and unlikely to resist further than a few months. If it shall go on even after you are back in Durmstrang, and somehow still survive the distance, then we may revisit the matter, and discuss what arrangements could be achieved to reconcile your duty to the family and your feelings. Is that such a hard thing to agree to?”
“I’m sure he has a reason, Harry,” Hermione said, patting his back.
“I could teach you,” he offered.
“Ron said, back when you asked me to the ball,” Harry messed with his curls, sending them flying in all directions. One of them settled near his left eye corner, which had to tickle. “He said that maybe...”
“I was just saying goodbye to Draco, Professor McGonagall,” Harry muttered.
The top box was filled with people who looked very important and very much too old to be involved in a bond with him, or so he hoped. There were a few younger people, though, mostly kids of dignitaries. One looked around their age, with very pale hair, like the man who was obviously his father and who just as obviously disliked Mr Weasley. Their greetings were frosty enough Harry almost touched the tip of his nose to check if it had frozen off, and Mr Weasley manoeuvered their party so they sat as far as possible from Fudge’s. The other boy looked at them with some curiosity and a vague air of haughtiness, Harry thought, though it might have been due to his high cheekbones and long nose. It gave the impression he was looking down on them.
“Harry doesn’t care about politics,” Draco said with a shrug. “He’s just a kid, and he just wants to go to classes and avoid problems as much as the average student. I don’t think he’s ever given the slightest thought about the interests of pureblood families, positively or negatively.”
“I can’t spend the family money anyway I want, we do have a big domain to upkeep,” Svetlana interrupted them before they could get more steam. “And I’d like to go to Australia to study their aboriginal magic rituals. It would be easier to convince my father if I already had most of the money.”
“I must say, though. It wasn’t much of a kiss, was it?”
“It’s getting more distinct,” Ron said. “Definitely a soulmark.”

“They do have Defense against the Dark Arts classes, but the rumour mill has the position as cursed, and no one stays more than one year. They had to hire Gilderoy Lockhart at some point,” Draco explained, his voice dripping with sarcasm.
“You can have your little flirtation for this year,” he said, tapping his fingers on the wooden table slowly. “But we expect you to remember your duty when you return to Durmstrang. Harry Potter is not from our world, and he has proven multiple times to be under Dumbledore’s influence. We cannot trust him to act in the best interests of pureblood families, especially considering his… frequentations,” he finished with a slight sneer, which Draco took to mean his father was referring to Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley.
His roommate hadn’t fared quite so well and had ended up with his eyes sewed shut for months. His countercurse was simple, so long as you weren’t so hated no one was willing to look it up for you. Dąbrowski belonged to that category, and it had taken so much time for him to rope a first year into telling him the solution, he had had to repeat the year. Draco would always remember the moment they had learned this with fondness, both for the look on Dąbrowski’s face and the pleasure he himself had felt in the knowledge that he would be assigned a new roommate.
Draco shook his head, unfazed.
“That’s all you have to say?” Harry asked, his anger sparkling back. “You haven’t said a word to me in three weeks and the only thing you have to say is that I should leave?”
This time, the sound of Antoniy’s cuffing him was unmistakable, and a few heads turned to them.
He sounded like Ron had during his row with Hermione when Harry had gotten back to the Tower last night, and wasn’t it such a blast to relive the scene as one of the main protagonists.
“I thought he vould never let go of me,” he whinged as he drew near them. “I vish he vould leave me alone.”
“I could ask him, you know,” she offered, turning to Harry.
Draco rolled his eyes at this. It was like Antoniy forgot who he was talking to.
Draco took the wheel starting from this chapter.
Right. Bloody champion of the Triwizard Tournament. Just nod, Harry.
“I vill not allow you to attend zat ball vearing zis,” she said, just as horrified as Draco had been. “Vy did you not transfigure zem into somezing more appropriate?”
Then he seemed to remember they were dancing, and knocked his knee into Draco’s.
It took Svetlana’s muffled exclamation above his shoulder to bring him back:
Viktor might have been calm and introverted, but he had a competitive streak that would have easily covered the distance between his home country and Durmstrang. Wherever it was. One did not become the youngest seeker ever to catch the snitch in a World Cup by playing sedately.
“Stop saying that and just tell me,” Harry said, annoyed, with a cutting gesture of his hand.
He didn’t giggle: he sensed that, at the moment, Draco was a high flight-risk.
“Good zing you’ve finally realized it,” Svetlana said. “But maybe zat particular epiphany could have happened zree weeks ago, vhen you could have actually done somezing about it?”
Now you'll have to wait until I produce new ones, and I've unfortunately fallen off the NaNo train quite hard. We're on lockdown here, have been for the past few weeks. I'm also unemployed at the moment, so I have very little occasions to step out my house. It's getting tiring and my motivation is very low. I'll be trying my best but the next chapter might take a bit longer to come out.
“Look, I just wanted to thank you for the tip last time,” the Hufflepuff said, leaning forward a bit to whisper this. “Without you I would have been toast.”
The Durmstrang delegation started moving towards the castle at Dumbledore’s behest, and as the group approached them, Harry heard a voice, smooth and jeering:
“Are you going to say something, or do you intend to keep on mimicking a grindylow until you become one?” Draco said acidly.
The first person climbed out of the carriage, an immense woman dressed in elegant black satin robes, whom Dumbledore immediately stepped forward to greet as Madam Maxime. She completely dwarfed the Headmaster, and Harry thought she might have been even taller than Hagrid.
?" Ron said. "It looks like rat's tails."
were asked.”
He dearly wanted to remind her that she was talking to the best friends of two of her sister’s rivals, who probably wished for her defeat, but Harry’s glare promised dire retributions if he dared to antagonize the girl again.
“Er, no. She’s going with Cedric.”

“How did you even get to the conclusion that I hadn’t liked it? I kissed you!” he exclaimed, instead.
“Mr Malfoy,” he said in his usual drawl, and just that made Draco panic enough that he froze dead in his tracks. Severus never addressed him outside of class or the Potions lab he had given over for Draco’s use as he prepared his Practical. So either Draco had inadvertently blown up the lab – impossible, he didn’t make this sort of mistakes with potions – or something else was at play here, and Draco had an inkling he knew from which forces.
“I had never intended to do so,” Draco sighed, leaning back into his chair.
“I understand that this is a great surprise for everyone,” the headmaster continued, his voice dropping back to a more natural level. “Yet I ask of all of you to remain calm. This is a great breach of privacy, and will be thoroughly investigated, seeing as Mrs Skeeter has previously been forbidden from stepping foot on Hogwarts’ grounds. I wish that you will all respect the difficulty this event will represent for Mr Potter, and do not participate in making this any harder for him to bear this intrusion into what should have remained his own.”
