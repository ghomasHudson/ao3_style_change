“Potter!” Draco says, arms flailing, feet kicking as he tries to keep himself afloat. Harry pulls him close. Runs his hands from his hips, up his sides, across the two half-moon scars on his chest, up his neck, brushes the side of his jaw with his thumb.

Harry understands. He lies down on the bed and faces Draco, his head pillowed on his hands.
Their Hogwarts class had been small. Her, Draco, Neville Longbottom, Ron Weasley, and that’s it.
What do you say to get a snake to return to you? Harry doesn’t know, and there’s a lot of ground to cover so he starts at
“No. I’m saying desire generates an immense amount of magical power — enough for the spell that joins wand bodies to wand cores.”
His lover will stiffen and grip him a little tighter, thinking, Harry suspects, about fire and fear and showing up to covert rendezvous slashed open, spilling secrets from wounds Harry hadn’t been allowed to heal, and Crabbe, gone.
Harry snorts. “No, you don’t. Ah— I mean that’s sweet, thank you. But no, that’s ok. It’s not really necessary. I … might have blinded my Uncle.”
“Why aren’t I in my own bed?”
“I hate you. My father would hate you.” Draco says. That makes Snape look up.
“I think I’d like to know about that too,” Luna agrees.
“It was why he couldn’t cast a patronus. I’d say it was pretty relevant.”
“I thought we weren’t apologizing.”

“Don’t let there be a next time.”

Lupin sighs. “There is no need for threats, Mr. Malfoy. I’m not turning you down. I’m making sure you understand exactly what you’re getting into before you get into it.” He yawns. “Come back at 8 tomorrow; we’ll see what we can do.”
There’s rustling from Ron and Granger’s room, then Granger herself, wearing leggings and a large Chudley Cannons shirt.
Draco scoffs and only barely manages not to say
The longer the meeting goes — the more Moody talks about how everyone but Order members are evil, and young people are evil especially — the more convinced Draco becomes that Molly has blackmail on the Order leader. Proof Moody committed tax evasion, or compromising pictures of him enjoying something morally ambiguous, like music. The only way Moody would ever allow anyone under the age of 30 — a child, in his rather restrictive opinion — into an Order meeting is if someone threatened to out him as a person who mildly appreciates Celestina Warbeck’s four radio hits.

“We don’t have the horcruxes anymore,” Harry says. “Ah, Voldemort does.”
Lupin’s eyebrows scrunch together. “How did you know that?”

“And what about the time after that?” Granger asks. “What about in 100 years when he’s still here and smarter because he’s almost 150 fucking years old? And what about when people realize what’s going on and every other dark wizard starts making horcruxes too?”
He was great at it too, even if Teddy kept on asking him why he cried so much and Draco had never figured out a polite way to say that he kept seeing flashes of his mother in Andromeda’s face.
“Come on Potter, have a heart,” Draco slurs into a pillow. It’s very Draco to sleep through a storm, but wake up to criticize Harry.
“It’s bullshit to rush to the ending you expect because you’re scared of what’ll happen when you get there. Not when it’s something like this. Not when it’s love.”
“You too. I mean — I mean —”
“I have an idea,” he says. “Pan was talking about how they can call Voldemort with their Dark Mark, and I was thinking about
“Can you go get another vial of cowbane from the potions closet? I don’t think the one I grabbed is the correct color.”
“I could’ve sworn you were already home,” Draco says when he sees Harry. “I thought I saw you upstairs. Or was it on the porch? Was that not you in the dining room? I didn’t realize you’d changed your—” Then, Harry is straddling his lap, kissing him. Recognizing this for what it is: an attempt to make sure Harry never actually has to deal with any of the toys made of the worst day of his life. For what it’s always been: Draco’s bizarre, backdoor approach to love.
“Nobody is saying that,” Ginny says. “We’re saying that we should just wait and see what happens. What do you think we should do? Try to stop it? Getting involved in a Death Eater civil war seems bad, regardless of the outcome.”
ORANGE
something now.
He doesn’t move. He doesn’t want the dream to know he’s figured it out and change in response. He wants to stay here, staring at the orange stain on The Burrow’s living room ceiling forever.
“Draco Malfoy. As I live and breath.”
“You dumbass, I love you too,” Harry finally says, and he’s laughing, and Draco is too. They tumble over into hysteria, and joy, and whatever the opposite of an explosion is.
“It’s Arthur’s birthday. Charlie, Bill, and Percy were coming home tonight anyways — now, we’ll have a right surprise party. Ohhhhh Arthur's going to cry; I can’t wait.”

Molly’s eyes scrunch around the edges. “And I think he mentioned that you cast incendio on the manor grounds. I’m sure that must’ve been intense.”
“Oh come on, I took out at least half of them. I deserve answers.”
"It's ... really good." How to explain to Hermione in a way that makes him sound not completely pathetic? “I always liked Sundays the best anyways. That’s why me and Ginny broke up, more or less. She wanted more; I wanted—well mostly, I wanted to wake up late and go for a walk and not do anything at all. That’s still all I want. Maybe someday I’ll want more, and when that happens, I’ll take the string off. But right now, all I do is wake up late and surprise my, errrrr, well, my favorite person over and over again. When he lets me, I get to celebrate with him too. What more could you really want out of a life?” He shrugs. “Besides, if I untie the string, nobody will tell Draco Happy Birthday, and I don’t know. I don’t really want to live in that timeline anyway.”

She willingly gave the aurors details of her own crime — a very high-profile insider trading case — to distract them from their search for the Malfoys. Catchlove had happily gone to jail for five months because Narcissa asked her to.

“Are you saying you fucked on my wand?” Draco can’t help himself; he needs to know.
Dean means Ollivander, currently wedged between Dean and Draco, one arm over each of their necks because he can’t support his own weight. It took almost half an hour longer than it should have to get here.
“Why are you telling this to us and not the Order?” Granger says.
“He told me you used to be scared of the ocean.”

He looks down at Potter, between his thighs, his gaze trained upwards on Draco’s every reaction.
“I’ll take questions after you Episkey me.”
Harry can’t work out if it's supposed to be a compliment or an insult, but he figures either way he shouldn’t leave Pansy waiting for their drink for much longer.
Lupin runs his hand through his hair instead of giving Draco more chocolate, which is what he should be doing. “He always had a lot of trouble with the patronus charm. Said he couldn’t stop thinking about how, if he failed, he’d have to listen to his mother scream about how he wasn’t going to amount to anything.”

“I think I still hate you. I was willing to be the better person for the sake of her,” he casts his gaze down to the kitten. “But clearly you don’t feel the need to give me the same courtesy.

“What are two things you can touch?”
“If Narcissa has them then she’s definitely going to coup. She has something he wants. He’s basically already lost. Wouldn’t you agree, Draco?” Pan says.
Draco breaths out sharply. “I don’t think I’m ready for this.”
“You can’t break into the Manor,” Draco says.
Draco’s had enough. Ron’s supposed to be his ally here. He’s supposed to be just as worried and hurting as Draco is. He’s not supposed to be able to deal with it so well. For the first time, Draco thinks there might be an advantage to Ron’s infuriating need to Feel Everything At All Times. He certainly seems to be able to handle … all of this better than Draco can.
Hermione remembers the banners changing from Slytherin green to Gryffindor gold; standing on a chair and cheering, lifting her fist in the air, and then — darkness.
“Fly the fuck out of here!”
“But the bank holiday,” Pansy tells Draco.
“Yes!” Arthur shouts.
Potter’s hand untangles from his hair and settles onto his leg. It arches into a claw and starts to dig into denim.
He aims his wand at Harry. A green flash.
Finally, Lupin says, “The patronus charm is difficult to master. I know you’re an extremely gifted student, but it requires quite a lot of power and focus. The lessons can be quite taxing.”
Draco opens his mouth to take offense, but is cut off. “Oh my god you take a million years to make a decision, Draco,

Ron, of all people, eventually comes up with a solution. “Harry didn’t like the Dementors either. The errrrr new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher’s helping him learn how to fight ‘em. I don’t know, maybe he’d do the same for you.”
“Except they don’t know how to do that. How long do you think it’ll take the Death Eaters to figure that one out?”
“Yes, I know; it’s a family secret. Unfortunately, we don’t have much of a choice. If you want to get out of here, you’re going to have to help me fix this.”
“What do you
“It’s nice to have pictures of everyone, though.” Potter sighs, and it travels from his mouth down Draco’s spine, stirs the sadness inside of him they share. One of the many reasons he and Potter unwillingly orbit one another: they both care for the same people. Two strays pulled into the redheaded fray.
He slides two fingers under Draco’s chin, angles it up to his face. Waits for Draco to be ready. The longest moment of Harry’s very long life.
“Yes, really, it’s not as though they’ve been subtle,” Granger says. “Now back to the topic at hand—”
Harry nods. “I trust you. If you say we have to, then we have to.”
“There’s three other people down here. You have options.”
Draco goes quiet. “He speaks.”

“I didn’t ask him to get involved.” Pan says. “He’s just like that. He acts like me and Paxton are his property and any slight against us is a slight against him. You know how Purebloods are.”
“They need to know.” Ginny nudges Pan’s shoulder.
He doesn’t know if it's the surprise or disgust that gives him away.
Harry shrugs. It’s not as though this is the first time.
“What did you expect? They’re a

“I can cast a patronus!”
Then the 12 alarm clocks Molly was keeping in his room — part of Arthur’s electronic collection — had all gone off at the same time. 11 a.m. Gryffindor lunchtime. Harry had roused enough to declare he was hungry and they should head to the kitchen.
“I figured it out, and you will not believe. You will not believe. It’s a key.” Draco says. “An
“I don’t have one minute. Do you know what sort of trouble I’ll be in if someone finds me in Slughorn’s quarters? Cruciatus trouble, that’s what.”
Harry never learned his name out of spite.
Potter’s eyes narrow. “I’m trying.”
Ginny had to come out to Draco twice, something he still maintains is more her fault than it is his. Like war, coming out is all about dramatics, presentation, timing. She had chosen to do it while taking refuge from a rain storm in the barn one Sunday the summer before her fifth year. Draco had been installing a radio in the Ford, his brain as staticky as the signal he kept getting.

“Up for a party? And I was hoping, if you’re feeling well enough, you could spend a few hours beforehand fixing the Ford.”
“Can any of you think of anything else?” Draco asks.
“Screwdriver’s on the table. It’s the long metal one with the hexagon head.”
“Hermione!” Ron stands up. She stares at the space above his head intently and then turns around to slide the wooden door closed.
“Don’t look so surprised. This has only ever been a hobby for me. You’ve really taken it to the next level. Wow. Wow wow wow. I’m excited to see what I — and the rest of wizarding society — can learn from you.”
Something almost tender passes across Draco’s face. He fishes in his pocket and pulls out three treats he places in front of the little kitten. The white kitten head immediately starts rubbing up against his hand. “Yes, well, she’s still
“Then don’t ask me to help Narcissa gain control of an army!”
He suspects Ron feels similarly, but Draco hasn’t been able to look at him since apparating to the tent. Ron will need to comfort or be comforted by Draco, and Draco doesn’t feel up to either.
The second night, Harry comes home to Draco snoring on the couch, RoHeGo laying on his chest. If Harry only gets to choose one memory to keep, he chooses this one. The sudden joy of figuring out what he wants eliminates the stress of trying to gaze at a future he’s never been able to picture until now. Some tension in him shatters. He watches Draco sleep for an embarrassingly long time. He wants this.
“Something’s coming,” George says. “Something really, really bad. I know we know what’s coming but actually what we know is coming is only part of what’s coming and what’s actually coming is much, much worse than what we think we know is coming. It’s going to eat the really bad thing we know is coming for breakfast. Literally. I know.”
Harry’s eyes are quizzical, and a little sad, and so very, very green. Draco can’t look at them for too long. He shuffles.
“You’re amazing,” he whispers, and Draco does look rather pleased with himself, his eyes roaming up and down Harry’s new body.

feels insignificant, but Harry says it anyways. Draco scowls. “Spare me the indignity. I owe Luna rather a lot of favors. Do you have any tea?”
Draco runs his finger over the garden etched on Harry’s forearm. “Whenever the need for whiskey got strong enough, I cut it with a different type of pain. It’s how I’ve stayed sober a year.”
Draco thinks, and sticks his head in the bowl. The world swirls, shifts, and now he’s in a dark room.
He recounts the story to Hermione on the 31st? 32nd? first Sunday in June. “Then the next day, it was his birthday again, and the day after that too . . . I think it’s the string. Luna gave it to me. I’ve got a gut feeling it’s the string.”
Harry points at the kitten, laying on its front paws, now sporting a calico head that wasn’t there the last time Draco visited. “I know you said this is normal but errrr she can’t stand on her own.”
“Hermione. Oh my god, hi Hermione. Is Harry there too?”
Ginny figures out an elegant and unorthodox solution.
“Severus …” Lucius says. “I can’t.”
There’s more rustling, muffled talking. Then, Ron exits into the living room mid-yawn, Granger right behind him.
“No I had thought not,” Draco looks at something over Harry’s head, frowning, the lines around his nose and mouth turned downward in response to some internal gravity. “Everything you said is all well and good, except I’m—” He thinks for a second. “Knotty, and eventually you’re going to figure out the puzzle isn’t worth the trouble and leave. Everyone always does, and I don’t think I would do very well if I lost you.”
But when Ron speaks, he’s firm and steady. In planning-mode, not solace-mode. “Alrighty then, they probably have the twins at Malfoy Manor, yeah? Draco how do we break into Malfoy Manor.”
“You should be proud, my boy.”
them.”
“Oh my god, when did this happen?” Ginny asks. “Was it just now? Was it last night? I thought you two were being all weird last night. Oh my god this is great. I’ve wanted this for so long. I’m so happy for you.
“Too bad. There’s a lot of shit between the two of you that’s going to come up at the least opportune time if you don’t wade through it,” Ginny says. Why does she care? Didn’t she stop talking to Pan when Draco did? Pan and Ginny have always had an intense relationship, fiercely competitive with bitter flare-ups where they would stop being friends for reasons that never made any sense to Draco. (“I’m not interested in hanging out with someone who keeps dating that cow,” Pan said once after Ginny got back together with Astoria Greenglass, her on-again, off-again girlfriend Pan inexplicably hated.)
The wards, which are generated by all of the bodies buried in the forest surrounding the manor, burn too. They flash into perception, a wall of translucent colors braided tightly together, shiny and faded, like the round surface of a bubble. The center’s charred; the burn-mark works its way across the pattern until it hits the edges and dissolves completely.
There’s a noise on the other end that Draco can’t make out, either a pained laugh or a sigh, and if Harry would hurry up and say something back that would be ideal. This is why Draco never confesses these type of things, he feels open and exposed. Plus, the dynamite is digging uncomfortably into his jeans.
The whoosh of magic, footsteps, the squeak of Draco’s mattress as Harry sits on the end of it.
Granger juts her chin in the air. She towers over Ron, who is still sitting at the head of the kitchen table. “You really weren’t going to do it?”
Draco pinches the bridge of his nose. The little gray kitten with one black head and one white head starts rubbing herself against his body. He scratches the white head behind her ear with his free hand. The black head meows, and he stops pinching the bridge of his nose to scratch behind her ear too. “As much as I would love to blame you, and I still am,

“Luna?” Dean says, shaking her.
It was a sequence that repeated the entire time they were on the run, an endless herringbone pattern interrupted only by moments when Narcissa needed to torture or kill. Narcissa made people love her, but that love was a changeling doppelgänger. Indistinguishable from actual affection until it started teething on her victim’s own life.
“This is ... real?”

“Oh yeah. Errrrr Big Time Cross,” Ron says, though he doesn’t look cross at all.
Draco thinks The Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes multicolored storefront and interactive window display is gaudy. The twins don’t care; whenever he mentions it, they counter that he has the world’s tackiest tattoo so his opinion doesn’t count.
“Errrr you know actually I think maybe I did see that. With Fawkes.”
And while he has grown up — he wouldn’t be a bystander to torture now; he’d do

are you doing here?” Harry repeats. Draco wants to tell him every awful feeling he’s had over the past month, how most of them have been sharpened to an animal edge that terrifies him, and also he doesn’t want to tell him anything at all.
Exploding charms, as all of Draco’s research has shown, require an extremely small amount of magical power to cast and are also — obviously — explosive. He basically channeled magical and mechanical power’s natural tendency to react poorly to each other somewhere specific. It was almost easy.
“Fuck that’s so fucked up,” Ginny says. “That’s so bad.”
“Come in if you must. It’s open.”
Ollivander and Pan are the only one’s missing. Madame Pomfrey has probably whisked Ollivander away to Grimmauld Place by now, and Draco refuses to expend any energy wondering where Pan is at the moment.
In his memory, the main atrium stretches up and up and up. White columns that never end; a marble fireplace charmed to never go out; a peacock water fountain, one of its feet balancing atop a cornucopia overflowing with fruits and vegetables. It’s a room he remembers feeling small in.
“I have no interest in fair. I’m interested in finishing my lecture notes in peace.”

Pansy passes their empty glass to Harry, who gets up — he lost a bet once and now has to refill Pansy’s drink whenever they ask — and starts toward the bar.
Ginny stands in the doorway, blocking Pan’s path. “Well?” Ginny says to them.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Because Dobby was already inside. The only way to bypass the blood wards is to have someone let you in through the floo.”

“Don’t talk to me,” Draco says.
Sometimes Hermione will remember exactly how odd; she’ll look at Draco and see all the ways they’re antonyms instead of their decade-old friendship sparkling underneath.

Draco says all of this between kisses. It’s not an especially effective protest.

I trust you, and you said there’s a flip-side, that we’re proof that there’s a flip-side. Which means all there is is just somewhere else I get to explore with you.”
“Have you?” Harry repeats.
“Meow,” says the white kitten head.
Outside, faraway mountains emerge and then disappear. Raindrops race the green blur of trees. Unwanted reminders of the centripetal force dragging him towards a place he desperately doesn’t want to go.

Ginny pulls Draco into the small room. There’s a first year with curly black hair reading in a corner inside.
“You don’t need to,” Draco cuts in. “I know I’m supposed to close. Potter’s just being — Potter.”
“Your hand shouldn’t be bleeding like this. You want to punch with your knuckles, not the flats of your fingers.”
The corner of Lupin’s mouth curves upward. “Thank you for the reminder.”
Nobody says anything, then Luna: “I don’t think any of us really benefit from that information,” and they’re all laughing, even — especially — George. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco sees Harry talking to Molly and Ginny; Fred half-arguing, half-laughing with Hermione; Arthur crying and hugging Ron, who is somehow crying more than Arthur is. Everyone’s safe. Everyone’s happy. Everyone’s here.
“Ollivander has a lot of bad days,” Luna says. “Not that I blame him …”
Potter reaches out and wraps one hand around Draco’s wrist.
“Believe me, I don’t
question.
Or not a goner, actually. Draco’s staying right here, with this ridiculous redhead and his even more ridiculous best friend.
But mostly, there is clarity. Clarity of what, Draco’s not sure. But he feels good in a completely uncomplicated way, good right down to his core, good all over his body. Good, even, in his racing brain. It’s as though he’s been emptied of everything except the nowness of his body, as though he’s been turned into a vessel for this one exquisite moment of happiness and relief.
“I’m sorry we have to stop Narcissa,” Draco says. “I know that her coup would mean a way out for you, but … it really would be worse.”
If he keeps repeating the motion after the finger lies slack, it’s nobody’s business. Not even Draco’s, really.
“Wanting you reminds me I wish I was someone else,” Draco says as soon as he’s able to word the emotion.
“Yes.”
“No!” He stalks back to the chair and drops into it. “I’m doing everything right. My form is perfect. My memory is perfect. It should work. Why isn’t it working?”
“Seems a little far-fetched, if I’m being honest,” Arthur says when Draco shows him the blueprints for the solution he came up with. He turns the paper one way, then another. “Let’s do it.”

Fred insists on keeping the device anyways because he thinks the fake fireplace screensaver is soothing.
The four of them hadn’t worried about it. Too many other things going on. A teacher with a lisp and a lumpy head; a troll attack that resulted in Draco and Hermione’s unlikely friendship; an end-of year feast where Neville and Ron won last-minute bonus points for being brave and getting Quirrell fired.
Molly’s kitchen is full of things. Overstuffed with antique china dishes; handmade potholders; three rows of copper pots suspended from the ceiling; a coffee maker charmed to always smell like freshly ground coffee beans; a microwave Arthur had gotten her she reluctantly admits is more effective than a reheating charm.
There’s movement in the magnolia tree, and Harry’s pretty sure he can see the tail-end of Sal, but he can’t be expected to stay on topic when Draco looks so dejected, award be damned.
I couldn’t help myself. How are we not talking about celestial bodies all the time? Wizards do not have their priorities in order. Then, my grandmother found some of my books when we were staying with her. I thought she was going to be mad at me, but no, she gave me this.”
Do you know how long it took us to domesticate wolves?
Draco wakes to Molly’s face. She’s knitting a crossword-patterned blanket in her favorite comfy armchair. It’s such a shockingly cheerful scene that Draco’s mind doubts its own reality — he must be dead, or unconscious, or under the influence of some wish-fulfillment spell. It’s too safe to be real.

“I told you I didn’t want your apologies.”
“That’s kind of an awful thing to say to me,” Harry says.
Harry loves Draco’s face and his eyes and his mouth, even when it’s trying to get Harry to care about something that Harry Does Not Care About, the way it is now. Draco’s laying beside him in bed talking sharp and fast. He wants to fight. Soon, he’ll ask Harry if he’s listening and Harry will nod and say yes love I understand you’re completely right and throw in a few buzzwords he picked up from Draco’s rant — right now: converse, appropriate funeral attire. Draco will huff and turn away, upset that Harry isn’t giving him the argument he craves and also upset that he doesn’t have a valid reason to be upset, and then Harry will get to see it: the tiny freckles, pale blond hair, plush skin. He’ll get to play with it while Draco is the way Harry loves him best: worked up.
“I do love you,” Ron says again. He’s all hunched shoulders, wide-eyed innocence, kicked puppy dog. Small and scared, despite his large stature. Unsure how to fix something like this, if it’s even possible to fix something like this.
in response. Draco’s fingers work at Potter’s gray fabric wrapping, pull it up and over his head. He rakes his gaze over taut quidditch muscles and battle scars and up to green eyes, looking back at him with the same intensity.

Ollivander peaks out from under his blanket at the sound. He’s wearing the accumulation of lots of bad days on his face — a black eye, a cut lip, a frizzy white beard and hair that’s matted against the side of his head. His eyes are wild as he looks at Draco. “What is

Granger casts a disillusionment charm over the group as soon as they’re all geared-up. Not that it’s going to do much — disillusionment charms notoriously don’t work well on objects in motion — but it at least settles some nerves. The plan is to fly until they’re outside the manor’s anti-apparation wards, then apparate to The Burrow. It’s not a very good plan — no plan that can be foiled by someone looking out a window at the right time can be considered a

Harry’s not quite sure how he ended up between Draco’s thighs. It has something to do with the two bottles of wine they downed last night, the Batman rerun on TV and Draco’s love of Halloween, but hatred of trick-or-treaters. As with most things involving Draco, there’s reasons, but no real connective tissue. Just: the moment Draco suggests they dress up as Voldemort to scare the muggle children in their neighborhood and then the moment Harry’s balancing him atop his shoulders under a black cloak.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Lupin says when Draco knocks on his door early the next morning. Lupin doesn’t do a good job of hiding his surprise. He doesn’t do a very good job of keeping his office clean either. The small room is covered in piles of books and papers. Also: half-eaten candy bars, empty mugs, and three different maroon-and-gold sweaters. Draco’s initial impression of Lupin was that he was scatterbrained and only barely able to take care of himself. The state of his office proves it: Draco’s an exceptional judge of character.
“How about you go get me another drink and while you’re up there you can decide if you actually want to win tonight or not. I’m for it, personally. Two Gryffindors. Two Ravenclaws. Two Slytherins. Has a nice ring to it. Symmetry.”
The scene shifts —
“Good night, you mean,” Draco reaches out to Harry, who steps into his embrace. He buries his head in Harry’s shoulder, breathes deeply.
Draco picks out a Siberian Arrow — the fastest broom in the hut — and hands it to Potter. Their fingers overlap on the red handle. Potter rubs his thumb over Draco’s knuckles, slow.
Cleansweep and you never learned to play quidditch.”
Also that. Draco did do that. Harry shrugs. “Then it’s a good thing I’m not sleeping with him.”
“Cooking’s cool,” Potter says, his hand still working up and down and up and down. “It’s like, the whole world is very complicated and incomplete, but this is a goal that I can actually accomplish.”

Ok, now you can tell me how much you miss me, how good it is to see me, etc., etc.”
Blaise flourished his wrist.
Draco doesn’t especially like the look on Ron’s face. “I can see the wheels in your head turning. Having someone purposely get captured won’t work. It’s stupid. It’s dangerous. You have to be keyed into the wards to use the floo.”
Potter’s braced on his elbows, one hand against his chin, the other working its way through black hair over and over again. He speaks to the ground.
Potter is very, very fit; considerably more fit than Draco and the shirt is at least a size too big. Potter’s gaze travels his body; Draco’s abruptly very aware of his figure, how slight he is and how loose the fabric hangs. Time for a topic change. “I didn’t know you cook.”

For the second time in an hour, the room disappears. The night sky is swallowed up by the type of darkness people mean when they say they’re afraid of the dark. Draco shivers and falls into it.

Granger has a lot to say about their fight. Mostly: that it was reckless and dumb. But also that Draco doesn’t know how to throw a punch.
“Wait,” Harry does a double take. His eyes darken. “You’re gay?”
Draco pulls back, just barely, and whispers arson into Potter’s mouth.
I’m only kidding a little bit. The phrasing’s a joke, but that’s a real law.”
“Voldemort was threatening my brother. What was I supposed to do? It was go along with his plan or sacrifice my family. There was no third option. I don’t have a magical family of redheads to help me with my problems. It was just me, all by myself. Choosing to save my brother’s life. You would have done the same thing in my position.”
Draco’s knuckles are white against his Nimbus. His world shrinks down to the broom and the wind tunnel surrounding him, the babbling rush of air —
“Ditto what Potter said.” Draco barely even stops at the microphone, essentially circling from his seat to the stage back to his seat again. Pansy glares at him, and Potter blushes, and his best friend’s wedding isn’t a game, but Draco has won.

He groans, his hand traveling down his own body, thinking about athletic hands pressing on the same spot, and he doesn’t want to be doing this in his kitchen but he is, thinking about scrubs and stethoscopes and white-blonde hair —
“We’re not yelling surprise?” Charlie says.
“You’re being dramatic,” Pan says when he brings the point up to them. “It’s a barbaric idea, of course, proof Dumbledore is completely uninterested in the schooling function of Hogwarts. But the Dementors aren’t allowed on school grounds, and I see no benefit in worrying about them being on school grounds until they’re on school grounds.”
“I wanted a better angle.”
“Oh my god.”

“Errrrrr don’t get me wrong, I considered it, but errrr I knew you’d feel as though we went behind your back and weren’t talking to you about things we should be talking to you about. And errrrrrrr you’d be right.”
“I’m calling your bluff,” Potter breaths into his mouth. He softly presses his lips against Draco’s — a half-second homecoming; a micro-dose of bliss — and pulls away.
Potter kisses him again, and that thought’s gone, too. There’s Potter, and Potter, and only Potter, kissing him in the Ford, not nearly close enough. Draco pushes forward, and Potter lets him, until Potter’s on his back, one foot pressed against the door, one leg stretched out under the steering wheel. His bent knee is right beside Draco’s head.
Draco recoils. Pan moves their head in an exasperated figure-eight motion. “I’m trying to say I’m sorry, you know. Last I saw, Fred and George were in the main atrium. You’ll need access to the floo to get out.” They flick their wand nonchalantly, and Draco feels warmth spread from his chest to the rest of his body. “And obviously I’m coming with you, so really you had better go ahead and forgive me because otherwise it's going to make the rest of this horribly uncomfortable —”

then dissolves into smoke. Draco will wake with whisps of anger and sadness fogging up his brain. He’ll try not to think about walking around Hogwarts sixth year with a dark mark and hoping nobody noticed. An evening of teary confessions and Firewhiskey. Draco showing Pan his mark; Pan telling him the Dark Lord had given them an impossible task.
“I would never do what you did,” Draco says. “I would have thought of something else. I would have used my brain. What you did was stupid, and wrong, and you’re never going to make up for it.”
“Oh my god just ask Snape to teach you whatever spell he used to get rid of them,” Ginny says.
“What else is new.”

“Yes. And?”
“Shit,” Ron says, his mouth full of sandwich.
“See!” Dean chimes in.
Draco’s original goal was to make a contraption able to generate the magical power needed to cast a patronus. That’s still a ways away — Arthur’s told him several times that the chasm between spells you can cast with a small amount of power and those that require a large amount of power is bigger than one might expect.

“Do we need leech juice for this?” Draco asks, even though he knows they do.
Harry decides, in the moment he kills Voldemort, that actually he’s not all that interested in rejoining a society that needs a teenager to exorcise its demons. He’s been living in a tent for six months and that’s been going well, more or less, so he chucks the elder wand off a bridge and goes back to camping. He becomes a hermit, a shade, a man who smells badly and gets twigs caught in his bushy beard.

Harry’s had a

Draco’s a connoisseur of Potter’s anger; he’s seen every shade from slight distaste to fury. Right now, Potter’s shaking, his hands bunched at his side. Seething. The only other time he’s seen this stage, Draco ended up with several scars across his chest. If he was thinking clearly, he would back off and allow Potter space to cool down. But Draco’s seething too, the only thought in his mind: what does Potter’s rage look like?
Hurt flickers across Pan’s face, but its quickly covered over with disinterest. They stare at the ceiling again. “You’re allowed to think that.”
Drank thinks later, after the doctor he hires to tell him his baby cousin hadn’t given him lycanthropy tells him werewolves are able to infect as young as three. He pays the doctor double to keep quiet and spends the rest of the month crying in the bathroom, pausing only to floo Andromeda and let her know she should get a sitter for the full moon, preferably one that already has lycanthropy or one she wouldn’t mind sacrificing to werewolf-hood, like a Weasley.

“I’m just … … …” The other boy searches for a specific word. Draco can see the answer in the anxious scrunch of his eyebrows, his tensed muscles. It’s suddenly imperative Potter doesn’t finish his sentence.
“Dementors killed my father,” Draco says. It’s important Lupin know that between the two of them, he has a more legitimate reason to be here than Potter does. Potter’s scared of Dementors because Potter’s an atrocious excuse for a human being. Draco’s not scared; he just inherited trauma.

“No it doesn’t,” Draco says. “We’re extremely off-topic. How is this going to help me cast a patronus? It’s not. You’re lazy, and a bad teacher, and you own too many sweaters. I don’t need you. I’ll figure out how to cast a patronus by myself.”
It shouldn’t be comforting, saying someone’s name over and over again, but it is. Communication without pretense; the linguistic equivalent of a hug. They reach toward each other with the minimum amount of language and allow affection and shared experiences to do the rest.

“Nobody has ever had a single positive thought at the DMV let alone fallen in love,” Draco says.
Granger fiddles with the string on the large brown hoodie she’s wearing. “Besides, we don’t know that the twins are at the manor.”

Dawlish, Crabbe, Dolohov, Yaxley. Harry hit with a spell, falling in the snow. Draco in a body-bind. Ron and Hermione dragged from the tent. Crucio. Crucio. Crucio.
Against his better judgement, he does end up going home. There’s a doll in their mailbox, sitting on a letter from Andromeda and Teddy. Dolls lining the walkway leading to the cottage. Dolls stuffed into each of the shoes beside their front door, on every stair, in each of the chairs in the dining room. When he looks up, there are at least five stuck to the ceiling.
“You’re ridiculous,” Draco says. “Not that you should feel bad about your uncle, but I’ve met you and this seems like prime guilty thought real estate.”
Draco’s bedsheets are purple. At the end of the rainbow, Harry kisses him gold.
“So you don’t love me back then?” Harry asks. “Sorry, I, ah, didn’t quite understand what you said.”
“Who was that?” Harry asks as he walks over and starts looking at the 11 varieties of apples on display. “Also which of these is best for pie?”
It’s almost 7 p.m. The tent smells amazing. From the timber of the humming, Potter’s the one rambling around the kitchen, making himself dinner.
Harry’s drunk, so he tries again. “I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND. WHY’D YOU LET HIM DO THAT TO YOU?”
Dread rearranges the dread already on Granger’s face into annoyance. “NOT RIGHT NOW!”

Draco holds his finger over his mouth, points down at his laptop. Ginny is saying, “Is someone there? Are you with someone? It’s not fair that you can see me but I can’t see you. Couldn’t you have figured out some way to make things even?”
“I don’t want to talk to you!” Malfoy says from behind the Manor’s large oak doors.
Draco throws a snitch at Fred’s head.
“No it doesn’t,” Draco says. “Narcissa is cunning in a way Voldemort is not. The Death Eaters are completely unorganized right now. She can turn them into an actual army, a force to be reckoned with, a unit we have no hope of defeating. She would be ten times the leader Voldemort is, and that would be much, much worse for our side.”
The other boy continues, slowly. “And we’re going to go to the store to see if they took anything or left any clues. Weren’t you listening?”
Snape shifts in bed so he’s not looking at Lucius anymore. “Go to him.”
Potter pauses to stare at a cork board overflowing with pictures. In one, the twins grin and cut the ribbon on their first day of business. In another, Draco and Ginny, their hands magicked into flippers, glare at an unseen Fred and George. Lots and lots of pictures of various groups of Weasleys — and Draco, and Fleur, and Angelina Johnson, and Lee Jordan — experiencing the effects of different Wheezes. In Draco’s favorite, Arthur beams with pride and Molly beams with resignation as the hair on their head dances.
“You think so?
“I kinda thought you were into it. I’m, ah, not feeling great about it now.” Potter grimaces and shoves his hands in his pockets. Goddamnit. Draco didn’t mean to hurt him.

It’s been almost 24 hours since Draco thought about the war, which has to be some sort of personal record.

on repeat in the Manor garden. Some June 5ths he shows up in the morning and spends the whole day with Draco; others he takes lunch with Luna and dinner with Hermione and doesn’t see Draco until 9 p.m. Draco’s always a knot of surprise and confusion when Harry arrives; now that Narcissa’s gone, Draco hadn’t expected anyone to remember his birthday. The slightest tug, and he unravels into a small, private smile.

“I like apple pie,” Harry says. “And Teddy’s working at a farmer’s market this summer, helping a family friend who has an orchard. It’d be a good chance to see him. Especially because he’s doing the cagey teen thing and won’t tell me anything about it.”
“Do you remember the first time we kissed? There was so much fucking saltwater in my mouth,” Draco will say in thirty years, sitting on the same boat, just as happy. And because Harry will have kissed him thousands of times by then, he will smile and press his lips to Draco’s and let it be perfect.
Draco hesitates when he says, “The Burrow,” so the floo takes forever. He didn’t bring a key either, so he has to knock on the front door for 5 minutes and then answer one of George’s ridiculous riddles. (“Boobs! The answer is always boobs!” “I haven’t even asked anything yet. I’m the psychic one, CoCo, not you. What do you get when you turn poop upside down?” “Boob!” “Correct. See told you the answer wasn’t boobs. It’s singular boob. You may enter, traveler.”) He trips going up the first flight of stairs to his room, and it makes the second flight of stairs seem impossibly long. For some reason, the ladder to the attic was put up, so he has to do the extra work of taking out his wand and casting a spell to actually get to his bedroom.
“Of course I can dance. Here. Let me show you,” he pulls Harry snug against him, casts a music spell. Harry doesn’t recognize the song, or the dance, but he recognizes the desire in the other boy’s eyes.
Child Draco hesitates, then nods tentatively. “But I’m not scared.”
“Errrrr …”
“Fine,” Draco says. He stares at Pan, who is tapping one black boot against the floor and still staring at the ceiling. “You were going to frame me for smuggling Death Eaters into Hogwarts in sixth year. There. We’re done talking.”
), both presents from Harry. Two of the three sweaters Harry forgot at his place too.
“Potter,” Draco says at the reception to Goyle’s funeral. “How is it you look exactly the same as the last time I saw you. That was almost 3 years ago.”
“Don’t joke about that. No more physical fighting. I knew you two were going to butt heads but I was hoping that you would be satisfied to
Ollivander takes another breath and continues, “You have to think about what you’re asking me to do. That’s magical theory 101: magic results from its casting. You’re meant to think of a clock when you cast a
“What do you think my father—”
The car bounces as Potter braces his hand against the side of the trunk.
way around that?” Potter’s eyes are closed; each word deliberate, pleading, fierce, painful. A lion politely warning you it will kill you if you don’t remove the thorn from its paw
You’re right. That was rude. I’m sorry. We appreciate all the work you’ve done as a spy, and we definitely can use any information you have. So.
The symbol on his arm hangs over the shop now, gaudy and tacky and ominous. Draco glances at the quivering green skull in the black night sky and quickly heads to the back entrance, Potter at his heels.
“We match,” Harry says. Draco’s in a green poncho and sage jeans. “Even though you’re not quite as committed as I am. Even my eyes are green.”
like your family.”
“No?” Harry says.
Harry stands up too quickly. The boat jerks. “Wha—” Draco starts, and Harry presses one foot on the boat’s lurching left side, capsizing it.
,” George says, victorious, and there’s nothing else to add, really, other than that wondrous little fact, the single best sentence Draco’s ever heard come out of George’s mouth.
“Ok,” Harry says. “If it’s a place you live, then I live there too.”
Draco imagines its black button eyes staring into his soul, trying to coax him closer.
“Most clubs check for polyjuice. If they didn’t, then anyone could be anyone and people couldn’t
When he opens his eyes again, Potter is gawking at the angry black ink on his arm,
them, missed the odd little rhythm the three of them have together. There’s a version of himself that only exists in relation to Fred and George. Being with them again is akin to the odd magic of regrowing bones.
They had helped him heal, but that didn’t mean they understood the wound. Draco is — and always has been — alone in his understanding.
For some reason Ginny’s words mean something to Pan, who leans their head back and gazes up at the ceiling. “It wasn’t a good time.”
“Meow,” says the kitten’s new orange fourth head. Draco scoops her up, cradles her to his chest, and
“Happy Birthday, love,” Molly says to him.
He repeats the mantra over and over again in his head, trying to chase away imaginings of what a wizarding world controlled by his mother would look like. Still, his heart beat quickens. Still, a sense of dread pushes down on his chest. Still, he feels claustrophobic in his own body. On edge, spilling out, failing to escape this moment where his past catches up to him and engulfs him completely.
The sharp edge to his voice is a symbol Harry recognizes. He pulls Draco in closer and kisses the top of his head. “I’m sorry, love.”
The shock that Draco Malfoy’s a vet does a lot to mitigate the shock of Luna’s kitten suddenly growing a second head. At least Draco’s surprised too; Harry feels a little comforted by the naked confusion on the blonde’s face when he tumbles through the fireplace at Grimmauld Place and sees exactly
Harry doesn’t look in the bag until they get home. Inside is their new pink, white and blue rug — and a medium flat brown box. FRAGILE: BEBIS.
“I know.” Potter focuses on the tomato again, cuts it into smaller and smaller pieces. Some of the juices bleed onto his fingers, and Draco thinks about wondering about what they taste like. He banishes the idea before it’s even finished forming, searches for a distraction and finds it hanging in a burlap sack around Potter’s neck.
Draco thinks about awkward talks he’s had with his various father figures.
and never used the
“And then we happened on Ron, Hermione and Harry while we were trying to escape. Wasn’t too hard to beat both Notts with the element of surprise on our side,” Fred continues. “We were trying to get out, but somehow we ended up back here. Don’t suppose you know a way out that doesn’t involve apparation or the floo?”
“Do you know what this means?
“It is to a surprise party. He doesn’t know any of us are going to be here,” Bill says.
“What, Potter doesn’t have voyeuristic tendencies?” Pan says. Harry squawks. Draco opens his mouth to say something devastating and pointed, but Pan’s already turning around and heading back out of the kitchen door. “Save your breath, Draco. I’m going.”
for it more so than
“Don’t be stupid,” Pansy drawls. “You’re the ark.”
“Stupefy!”
He can’t help it; he’s grinning. This is the first time they’ve talked in five months. She had come home for Molly’s birthday but not for Christmas, because by Christmas the Carrows were “openly tormenting the students,” her letters said, and she needed to stay and fight. Hearing her voice, being connected to her through time if not space, it’s a balm. It’s relief.
her?”
Halfway through, Harry starts laughing. “I’m sorry. It’s just — ” He hands Draco a mirror and a reflection he doesn’t recognize: his hair shorn close to his head, a couple of blonde tuffs sticking out.
Dumbledore makes a speech about dark times and turning lights on and how there are going to be Dementors patrolling the castle, looking for Sirius Black. Draco’s positive the decision is meant to target him specifically. Dumbledore hates Draco. Sirius Black is Draco’s cousin — probably Sirius Black hates Draco too, for betraying the family and getting Narcissa arrested, or something.
and ends up talking to his impromptu roommate until Draco proclaims that he has to sleep or else the entire pet-owning population of wizarding Britain will suffer.
“That’s nice of you to say. I don’t think the other Death Eaters think as much. They always laugh when I suggest we should put a salad bar in the dining room.”
“Oh yes, We saw Fred and George a few days ago. Or maybe a few hours ago. Sometime …” Luna trails off. “It was nice when they were here. George and I talked about ostriches. He’s holy, did you know that?”
Obviously Harry’s going to help him find Sal; he’ll do anything Draco asks if it means he gets to be near him. “Errrr what exactly do you want me to do.”
“My focus is fine. Do you have more chocolate? I want to go again.” Maybe he should try a different memory. The one where Draco, Ron, Ginny, and the twins had happened on a meteor shower when visiting Charlie in Egypt. He hadn’t thought that one was as happy as the memory from his birthday, but happiness is hard to quantify. It’s possible he was wrong.
“What happened?” Granger asks.
Ron’s staring at Hermione, and Harry’s trying not to stare at Draco, and Draco’s trying not to feel too strongly about Harry trying not to stare at him. Lust is not exactly a finite resource here.
“Have you seen Fred and George?” Draco asks.
“I like the idea that if you were to look down at us from one of those muggle flying things, all you’d see is the two of us surrounded by calm blue. Just you and me in this beautiful expanse,” Draco says. The languid lines of his body, lying on the wooden sailboat with his head propped on his arms, eyes closed behind blue sunglasses, all passively sing the same song. Draco is
“I don’t want to inconvenience you while your partner’s here.”
“You and your friends have worn through my patience, Draco,” Narcissa says, her voice magicked louder with a
Draco hears them. The whisperers in the walls. His friends. The ones who speak with violin-string tongues. He talks back.
“Nope, not a good reason. You’re talking,” Ginny says to Pan. She turns to Draco. “You’re talking.”
“He keeps failing his driver’s test,” the DMV employee says.
If his life had been different …
“Ron?” Ginny asks.
Isn’t that interesting. A new layer of Harry for Draco to unwrap, more surface area for him to touch.
because of what I did,
Diagon Alley’s freshly opened farmer’s market is the next tour stop. Six or seven vendors lining the road between Ollivander’s and Madam Malkin’s selling vegetables, honey, bread, and several varieties of vibrant, weirdly round wizarding fruits. Harry spots a flash of blue curls beside a
“Fred and George can’t afford to hire anyone to test out their products, so they make people they know do it as payment for being allowed in the workshop,” Draco explains. “And they like to photograph it because they’re mean, ludicrous people.”
Solidarity, obviously. It’s just he has a tendency to loose track of his surroundings and drop into a place of all-encompassing thoughtlessness when working on the Ford.

. Draco can see the oak tree now, it’s topmost branch poking through the surrounding canopy.
Draco arrives to the International Portkey Office with a mystery novel in one hand and a magically-enhanced suitcase containing absolutely everything he owns in the other.
Whatever song is playing picks up. Draco’s arm travels upwards, settles on his hip, and then they’re dancing. Harry tangles them up together, the bad choices and the better ones, and prays they never comes unknotted.
In the aftermath, there is clarity.
Harry steps closer.
“You don’t remember when they were here, do you?” Luna directs her comment at a gray lump in the corner. It grunts in response. One hand shoots out to pull the ratty gray blanket tight. What sort of Death Eater gives their prisoners blankets?
“Wait,” Harry says. “What about the Hufflepuffs?”
“Can Potter do it?”
.” Draco focuses on the lightning bolt scar instead of Potter’s eyes or his mouth. He’s liable to get lost if he looks any lower, and they really can’t do this now. Potter inclines his head, as if to say,
destroy the horcruxes. Do you really think the Death Eaters would keep following someone who took a leave of absence every few months? Merlin, you’re supposed to be the savior of the wizarding world and you can’t even strategize your way out of a hole.”
“Huh?”
“The only reason you think this is a good idea is because you’re dating the spy,” Draco says.
“What the fuck.”
He hears footsteps behind him and suspects it’s the former option.
“You’ll be proud of me, Draco, I spent most of my summer studying,” Pan says. Ginny snorts. “At first, it was only because I was trying to impress Sinistra — Her sister’s on the Wizengamot, and I’m meant to become a lawyer. But astronomy is
But he doesn’t want Draco to forget this, ever. And perfect things slide; imperfect things stick.
“Fuck,” Teddy says.
“If you knew my father, you would know that’s a ridiculous question. My mother won the house cup for Slytherin all three years she was captain.”
“Hang on—” Draco turns around to open the driver side door, but the position is weird and he ends up half-falling out of the car in the process. He steps out completely in order to right himself. His back hurts; he reaches all the way up to stretch it. The bottom of his t-shirt rides up along his stomach, and then there are hands there, exploring the exposed skin.
“I’m not helping Narcissa,” Draco says to Potter. He jogs across the field, the garden, the porch, the living room. Arthur is sitting in his armchair doing the crossword puzzle, exactly where Draco expected to find him.
. Except it is the same. Crucially different, but the same. Adrenaline.”
He sighs. “I don’t know what’s wrong. That’s what’s wrong. I’m home; everyone is safe. I should feel better, but I don’t. It’s not worth talking about.”
The voice in his mind that sounds suspiciously like Molly answers back.
The wild card, the actual wild card that isn’t the second Joker padding the deck, is that Harry knows Draco was marked. He's seen the tattoo, kissed it.
“It’s my understanding there were Death Eaters after you. Ginny said she tried to kill Narcissa? And Narcissa tried to kill you?”
“You’re a travesty,” Draco says.
“I know what a screwdriver is,” Potter says, but doesn’t move.
“I said
“You can come in, Potter.”
“Lucky you, you get to watch that particular awkward romance blossom up close. I bet you can tell every time they have sex; Ron’s never been subtle about anything in his entire life.”
“Charlie sent it to me. I’m making a wand,” Draco takes out the coin purse and drops the heartstring inside. When he looks up, Potter is gaping at him.
“I bet Crabbe would do it if we got Ginny to ask him. She errr always said she could get him to do anything she asked.”
