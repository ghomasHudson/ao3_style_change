"So what of Hermione, then? I can't be seen giving money to her, or anything, if I'm supporting her return to her husband," he asked, genuinely worried for his friend.
Harry glared at him for a second, and then his gaze dropped down to observe the amber liquid in his glass that he cradled in his hands.
When he was completely out of sight, Harry allowed himself a sigh of relief. He decided to explore the house a bit, rather than going back and perhaps facing another one of those conversations, in case someone else had different concerns. Therefore, when he walked out of the door, he went down the corridor to the opposite direction than everybody else. He peeked into one room after the other. He felt like the old days when he would walk around Hogwarts, trying to find secret places. Of course, those excursions mostly revealed dusty and unused classrooms, but the fun was in the walk, not the findings. He saw a great, but empty library. It wasn't completely empty, some shelves were occupied, but Harry only saw Muggle romance novels and none with more substance. He remembered the great library in Malfoy Manor and estimated this one to be about the same size. Clearly, the previous occupants had either taken their books, or the new one just didn't need them. It was a bit sad, actually.
That was when Ginny walked down the stairs. Harry was surprised to see her  as he hadn't expected her to be back for a while. She looked at her husband  and her eyes narrowed.
Arthur was sipping a glass of champagne as he greeted them. Harry tried to guess who he was dressed as, but had no idea. His father-in-law was wearing and old sort of robe in brown that was ragged, but on his breast he was clearly marked as the Chief Warlock. He knew this because the insignia was the same one as what they used these days.
The engines blared, and the plane suddenly seemed to put on full speed. Harry was pushed against his seat. Unable to swallow, he couldn't force his rapidly beating heart still. Then he felt the plane leave the ground, and his stomach seemed to be pulled back down by gravity. His ears clogged. Harry couldn't understand why anyone would put their body through the sensations voluntarily. He also briefly wondered, if besides flying on a broom, there was a mode of transport that he actually liked, and he came up with nothing. They were still rising, and he tore his gaze away from the fact that everything before them was higher up on the plane. He looked outside.
Hermione looked up, and narrowed her eyes. She was obviously suspecting something. Harry tried not to blush at what she was probably thinking.
"We have been outside for too long. Go inside and let me cool down a bit," he said in a suggestive tone, although it was clearly an order.
eyes." She motioned to the crowd around them. "They look after themselves and their families first. It's different, but I realised that while most of them are Slytherins, they are not bad people. Unlike their reputation."
First, they needed to get an actual violin. They went into town to find something. Draco of course found the most beautiful, and expensive instrument at a music shop. Harry felt his heart break that they couldn’t get it, but they had to settle for a second-hand one. Still, it played reasonably well, and Harry hoped that Draco would be talented enough to warrant a better violin in the future. He had never heard him actually play.
The next day found Harry and Hermione sitting in the Leaky Cauldron again. They had previously decided that it was the perfect venue for their big row. Malfoy had carefully constructed just what they should say. They had to script the entire conversation, not only the most public part, just in case someone was near enough to overhear everything. As Harry was not good at remembering things verbatim, he was just given a general outline as to what he should say. Still, it was with a heavy heart that he prepared for it and only his Gryffindor courage kept him from bolting. He just hated what he was about to do.
Harry recalled talking to her that night. He gently tried to tell her without actually saying out loud that he wasn't in love. She asked him to wait, consider it, to go to sleep and maybe talk about it when they weren't so tired. Then the talk never came.
Harry expected to get a taxi, but Draco assured him that the Leonardo Express train would be an experience in itself. As they sat down, he resolved to acting as unlike tourists as they could possible act.
. It was uncanny how that boy loved Potions, when neither of his parents did. He was also extremely intelligent, having learned how to read and write at the age of four from his Aunt Hermione. Ever since then he had read everything he could get his hands on, first starting with Harry’s old school books. Of course, besides those there were not many books around, so they had to make frequent stops at book stores once he was done with those. Which took him three months. Harry just hoped he would use all the spare time he had at Hogwarts gaining friends. Albus wanted to go to Hogwarts already, but there were no early admissions. He couldn’t wait to discuss things with professors and finally have more people to talk to than Aunt Hermione. His parents hardly understood what he spoke about most of the time, hence all the reading. Not even Hermione’s children could keep up with him, both too much like their father, Ron.
Lunch could not come soon enough for Harry. Ron was not in a good mood and he was trying everything to calm the man down, but he kept spewing hatred. He was relieved when he could go and sit down in his favourite pub. Good thing that Ron always brought home-made food and ate it in the cafeteria. They did not have a lot of money with his wife at home and two kids. Aurors were not making a lot of money and Harry was glad for his inheritance. Though at the rate Ginny was spending money abroad… Soon enough Hermione appeared as well, and she joined his table.
"That was why we came to eat here. There is always a photographer about. The Alchemist is the most popular place right now. Famous people come here to be seen. I do applaud you coming here."
"No. I'm not that kind of a man. I like you, Draco. A lot. My attraction to you had been growing these past months, I just refused to acknowledge it. Now that I have, I want to be with you. I want to give this a shot."
The redhead just stared at him, and then turned to walk towards the stairs, grumbling under his breath the entire way.
"It's not for forever, Harry, just 6 months. I think you haven't been the same either, since the war. The way you sit in front of me now, your shoulders slumped, your eyes almost dropping. Harry, you eat the same thing every day, and don't even deny it," Hermione explained, her voice full of concern for her friend.
An hour later, Harry was strolling down Diagon Alley with his wife on his arm. He wasn't all that sure what he was going to buy. Just like with most things, he liked to pick gifts out on the spot, no plan, just improvise. He would look in the windows and think about his children, thinking of whether they would like something from there. However, his wife had other ideas. She enthusiastically dragged him to the first shop she saw, which happened to be Quality Quidditch Supplies. She led him straight to the latest racing broom design and just stared at it. Harry got bored quickly. He still appreciated the broom, but he wasn't as excited about Quidditch as he used to be. He still went to games with his children, though James was the only one who enjoyed them. Albus took a book to read and Lily something to colour and some papers to draw on. Harry had considered leaving the two younger ones at home, but he wanted it to be a family outing and hoped that they would catch on as well.
Draco clearly sneered at her choice in literature and headed towards the back of the shop, clearly dismissing the couple.
Harry made a reservation at the poshest restaurant in town, and was excited for their date. He wore his best suit, tried to comb his hair and made sure he smelled good. He even got Draco's agent to do a little ruse. The man told Draco to dress up as he would be playing at the restaurant. So Draco also got out his best suit. Harry pretended to just tag along as he often did to Draco's gigs.
"I can't believe my father has a measly 50 Galleon-limit on my personal withdrawals. What am I supposed to do with this small pocket-money?"
In a matter of minutes, they reached the Manor and Harry grudgingly dismounted. He was surprised to find that he rather liked riding and considered that it may be something he would get into in the future.
They left the ancient ruins behind, and entered the zigzags of the city in a taxi. Harry thought that the following day they could spend exploring the modern side of the city. They soon arrived to a very large square.
He woke the kids up at 8am and they had breakfast together. All three children were soon dressed in some of their nicest clothes as Harry didn't want them to feel frumpy next to the Malfoys. They Flooed straight to a welcoming chamber as they no longer had anything to hide. Once they emerged from the flames, they were greeted by the whole Malfoy family. Well, except for Astoria, who carefully seemed to avoid everyone else. Hermione was also waiting for them. The kids gleefully attacked their Aunt Hermione and she hugged them to herself with a huge grin on her face. Harry was a bit afraid that the Malfoys would be annoyed by the breach of protocol, but as he looked at them, they were all smiles.
Beater positions  after the twins had left. Harry hadn't even known that the boy had become an  Auror.
"Draco, I know this is not champagne, but I want to toast to our new life. I'll be eternally grateful for meeting you at Gringotts yesterday. I have secretly dreamed of a life with you, but reality is far better than what I could have hoped for. Thank you Draco, for coming with me. So, I make a toast to you," Harry took his glass, Draco as well, and they chimed the two together, both taking a sip.
Harry tried to smile an agreement, but was actually not that happy about the comment. He usually thought Ron was too tough and quick to judge.
"Harry." The blond sighed in frustration and got up. He headed to the bathroom. He turned back, halfway through the door. "We discussed this yesterday. You were on board. Perhaps, you're still clinging to that potion-induced complacency you had been under all these years."
Harry scratched his head. This was the second time in twenty-four hours that  he had heard the term 'Light Wizard'. Before, he had thought that it  referred to wizards who only did good magic, but both Ron and Malfoy had  spoken as if it was something else. He made a mental note to pick up some  books on that as well on his way home. He was obviously missing something  and he had learned in the past that not having enough information could cost  him. He tried not to flinch at the pang he felt in his heart as he saw  Sirius fall through the veil in his mind's eye.
The room was almost dark, with a sliver of light peeking through the curtains. His sheets were a soft green, and his bed a lot more comfortable than in his dream. He was startled as the door opened, and Draco walked in carrying a tray. He was wearing pyjamas, with his favourite dark green robe thrown over it.
"I want a picture of me in front of the Arch." Harry stood in position, thinking that Al would find the Arch interesting.
Draco, on the other hand, went to interview after interview, but he kept embarrassing himself in front of his potential employers. He tried to expand his knowledge of the Muggle World, but the little nuances that Muggles learned through immersion were missing. Draco was feeling worse and worse every day. Wallowing in misery, the blond found himself being lazy in front of the TV more and more. Harry was worried. He was afraid that Draco would completely slip into depression.
Harry stared in amazement that she had actually done it and Draco had actually liked the present. The other man disappeared into the closet and reappeared dressed.
"I'm looking for the Banthai Beach Resort  & Spa," Harry read out from a piece of paper that he fished out of his pocket.
He also heard a lot about Hermione. Ron would often visit in the evenings, sometimes with his kids. It was nice to see all five little heads playing together, even when the occasional fight took place. Still, Harry was not happy that Ron never seemed to remember that the kids were around and he would often use language that was inappropriate. Therefore, Harry took to taking everyone upstairs first and cast a good one-way silencing charm on the playroom.
Harry groaned. After two months of not seeing each other, she finally came  back and that was what she opened with.
Harry arrived in front of great iron gates that seemed to sparkle in the sunlight. Both wings had an ornate letter "M" boldly standing out amidst the twisting metal that composed them. He admired their beauty for a moment and then without taking his cloak off, he passed through the gates. They did not open, but just as Draco promised, he was keyed into the wards and could enter unhindered. The walk to the actual house took a lot longer than he remembered and was a lot more pleasant. He repressed a shudder as old memories threatened to haunt him and fought them off with the present sight. It was a clear day, the sun shined on him with the last warmth of Indian summer as he walked down the path that led to the great Manor. On both sides trees lined the way and he recalled there being a hedge before, but now it was gone. Deer and birds sometimes poked their heads out from the leaves and gazed curiously at him, even though he didn't take off his invisibility cloak till he could no longer make out the gates in the distance. The trees themselves were a myriad of colours: greens, yellows, reds, browns adorned them signalling the best days of autumn.
"Oh, can we go to that new restaurant just off of Diagon Alley, the Alchemist? Everyone is talking about it."
"Goodbye, Mr. Potter! Bring Albus when you can!" the little Malfoy spoke up from the doorway, where he was still standing.
Finally, he reached the waistband of the boxer shorts and pulled it down. Draco's erection sprang forth, and he sat back on his heels to gaze at it. He had never thoroughly examined another man's cock before. Of course, he had seen others in the communal showers, but he always tried not to look too closely. It was a darker pink than the rest of him. Already erect, it was a bit smaller than his and thinner. The tip curved slightly upwards. The blond curls around the base were obviously clipped and stylised, but not taken completely off. It looked beautiful to him, just like the rest of the man. He felt the saliva pool in his mouth, and he bent down to give the tip an experimental lick. Draco moaned what could have been his name, but he was too focused on the member before him. The taste was slightly rubbery and salty, but not overpoweringly so. Harry got comfortable, lying on his belly and keeping himself up on his elbows. He bent his head again and remembered how he liked it. He swirled his tongue around the head, then slowly went down, to suck the shaft into his mouth. When he couldn't take anymore, he flattened his tongue against the underside, and went back up, only keeping the tip in his mouth. He kept repeating the procedure until he worked out a rhythm, that wasn't too slow or fast. When he didn't have to concentrate on keeping his teeth away, he started to play with Draco's balls, rolling them in his hand. The sounds the other man gave proved that he liked that as well, and turned Harry on incredibly.
"None of my business?!" Harry could feel his anger rising like never before. "I could see you through that curtain, Ginny! You were having sex with Merlin knows how many people! Sex! Is this what you have been coming for?!"
Hermione turned white, then red, then white again, obviously unable to decide whether to be sad, or angry.
"I know. We have to walk to the end of it, and from there the entrance to the hill is not far away."
On Hermione's diet. In 2008 I felt ill all the time, especially after eating. I was concerned, because I've had several problems like that and some involved rather nasty things, so I went to a doctor. After some tests they found that I have Candida in my blood, so I had too much in my system. I cut out all sugar, flour, and some other minor things, took fungi-killing medication. The blood test after 3 months of this revealed that I managed to bring down the levels to the normal one. I never slacked for one meal. If any of you have it too, then I suggest sticking to it religiously and not wavering. For those who had not had it, I have to tell you that it can be a very serious problem. If you have other conditions that weaken you, you can die from the combination. Actually, while I was on the diet, there was an actor in my country who died from a really severe case of Candida infection. So no, I'm not kidding. Anyone can have it.
He's in there now, but Harry can hear that they're not talking. He knows he should be getting ready, knows he needs to dress and glamour as Hunter. The Patronus with the location could come at any minute. But he can't stop thinking about what could happen, how this all could go down. He's been in situations like this a hundred times before, but this is different.
Malfoy seems to relax slightly and he leans back. 'That's fine. I'm not expecting it to be constant contact. We start tomorrow night. I'll bring the bonding object with me. I've booked my first meeting with a lower-level entry point. I need to get to the top eventually, hence the time. To get what I need, I'll undoubtedly have to prove myself in a number of ways. That's why I'll be expected to bring you. Markwell is wealthy, and known to be shady, but wealth and a dirty background alone aren't going to get me to the person I need.'
'He was on your fucking Ministry's Transformative Creatures Register,' Malfoy says and the anger is back in his voice. 'Seth was on your damned register, voluntarily, and do you know where that got him?'
Then he looked back up at the image of fifteen men in Muggle suits standing to watch the US and Russian Presidents shake hands.
He dropped the sheet again and leaned to one side, away from the body laid out before him. He put both hands on the ground and vomited, retching as all that came up was bile and pain.
'What do you mean, they can't take themselves back out?' Harry interrupted. 'These huge powerful forces for Death just choose to put themselves inside a human body and then they get stuck?' His tone was disbelieving. It sounded mad.
Harry found Malfoy speaking with a group of five other men in a boardroom. He stared at him, looking for signs that Malfoy was possessed by some demon force. He looked completely normal, completely human, dressed in another of his smart suits, leaning forward with his hands on the table as he spoke to the other men in an authoritative tone. For a moment, Harry felt a tendril of doubt, but then he remembered the look on Malfoy's face as he'd glanced into Scorpius' room. No one who felt that way about his child could treat him so badly without something controlling his movements.
'Plus, it's literally my job to watch people and learn things about them. You're faster now, stronger, and you certainly weren't that buff before you quit your job. They forced you out, didn't they?'
Ladon pulled back and looked at Harry, his other hand tightening momentarily on his hips, fingers digging in.
Then he cried out again as the distal club entered him, its packet of sperm slippery against his rim. It was wider than the others and he could feel it stretching him. He retreated from it just slightly, and the tentacle around his cock tightened in response. He moaned and sobbed, pulling back against the tentacles binding his arms.
'I -' he glanced away and then resolutely met her eyes again. 'I don't think I ever said sorry for … what happened to Fred.'
It was slow, at first, to respond to his deliberate call. Usually, he knew, he drew on his magic in an intense burst of need. This … this, he needed too, and he focused on that feeling.
'I've always liked this face,' Draco said, and then he leaned in, pressing his lips against Harry's.
'Bloody hell, Harry,' Ron said, when he saw him. 'You look like a drowned rat. Raining down in Creature Control too then?'
Harry flushed as he realised that made sense. Whatever magic Malfoy had imbued his green door with, to be able to open to any room he chose, it made sense that the inner workings of his home weren't totally reliant on it.
Harry looked at the bottle in front of him, and then looked around their much-reduced circle, at who was left. Hermione, Zabini and Malfoy were the only three still there with him. Harry looked back at the bottle and then opened his mouth. Maybe he should call it off. It was such a small group now. If he spun Hermione he'd have to leave anyway. He could touch lips with her, but a full frontal snog? That was wrong for so many reasons.
Harry makes a decision and stands up straight, moving further into the kitchen. He pulls his wand from his pocket and lays it on the table. Malfoy watches him with questions in his eyes, as Harry moves back to the doorway. He'd still probably be quicker to his wand than Malfoy would be to his, but at least this way Malfoy has a fighting chance if breaking the spell means Harry's going to put him in danger.
He spent the rest of the day sitting on the rooftop, looking back towards the square, writing sporadic notes of things he remembered from that afternoon, and then tracking back further, over the past week. It was soothing, to go back to his routine of tracing and recording details, looking for the links between them.
Hermione's face lit up in a broad smile. 'Oh, that's wonderful Harry. I'm so glad. I was hoping for so long that you would. Who are they? Where are they based?'
and pushed open the door to the hotel lobby, moving to a corner and locking the door behind himself. He was glad to see there was no telly in this one. The foyer was empty, the front desk unattended, and Harry took a seat on one of the couches. He cast a Notice-Me-Not and then a warming charm, after a moment. He was so bloody cold.
'Of course, Draco,' Lucius said, voice holding the slightest hint of mockery. 'We wouldn't want to do anything to upset the Ministry, now, would we?'
'Anyway, that's not what I meant. That can all be established later. Just put Wizard on the top of the form. It will change for the kinds of identification and checks your kind has available.'
'If all you do is sit and watch your snake eat all day, Potter, I'm not surprised your boss doesn't trust you with reports. Shall we?'
Harry moaned and Malfoy nipped at his lip, the sting of pain making Harry open his eyes. Malfoy's were so dark they were almost black when Harry met them and he jerked his head in a clear direction.
Harry nipped at his neck lightly, rubbing his cheek against the shaved undercut of Draco's hair as he breathed him in. Draco arched back into him for a moment and then pushed him away with a huff. 'Set the table, you animal. This is almost done.'
Hermione came back into the room, levitating three cups and a packet of biscuits in front of her. They were the assorted cream ones that Harry loved - the ones his Aunt had never let him touch.
He waited for some snarky comment to come, but instead Draco just hummed in agreement. Harry smiled and ran his fingers over Draco's knuckles.
'Daaad,' Harry said, turning his pleading gaze on his mum, who was flipping bacon with a smile on her face.
'It's why your magic is fluctuating so badly,' Hermione said. 'You're drawing excess energy constantly, from the life of everything around you. When it bursts out of you, it's changing things back and forward in time. A plant grows, a wall reverts to a previous colour, a brick becomes clay.'
He glanced over the rest of the file quickly, not seeing anything else of interest, and then he tidied everything back up. He put the half-empty packet of biscuits in Jeffries' partner's drawer and left as quietly as he'd come. A quick stop by home to make his arrangements - Malfoy especially didn't need to know the latest information in his mind - and he was ready for the next part of the night.
. You know this. You can't be with me outside of the club. You can't share my life. I don't have one.'
He sits onto his haunches, his claws coming up to gather the layers of fabric between him and what he wants. The stick is in his face now and his mate has his teeth bared in challenge. Wolf bares his back and clenches his fists to tear the barrier away.
'What do you think of it, working at the Ministry?' Harry asked, as they sat down to lunch one day. He'd been thinking about Malfoy the night before, about the way he'd been shunted from one job to the next, and the way he seemed defensive to the point of fear when he walked the halls. It worried him. It wasn't that he was trying to
Harry steps forward but Malfoy holds out a hand. 'That was only the first part, Potter,' he says. 'I would highly advise against touching.'
'It doesn't matter,' Harry interrupted. 'You can keep your secrets. I know you have a life - a family. I don't want to put that in danger. I just - I want this to be real. I-' He cast his mind wildly about for something that would convince Ladon. 'I'll wear the blindfold again.'
Conor gestured across the chamber and the four of them set off. He led them through one door and another, until they were in another large room, this one lit by magic, and lined with cases upon cases of books and scrolls. It was easily four times as large as the initial cavern they'd Apparated into, and this one had no signs of technology in it. Conor held the door open and gestured to a large, old table near the entrance.
Malfoy hasn't changed a lot in the past ten years. The last time Harry had seen him in person had been at the hearing when he was released from Azkaban. He'd served a four-year sentence and had been all over the papers after his release. And then, a few weeks later, he'd just disappeared.
But this wasn't really working with Malfoy. It was watching him. He had a set purpose and he could focus on that.
He looked back up. Jakub's eyes had been gouged out, bloody holes replacing them. Harry glanced quickly over the rest of his body. The only other damage seemed to be to his chest. Harry stepped closer again, peering up to try and understand what he was seeing.
He waited until the men had sat down in front of the telly again, facing away from him, and then he moved silently, cracking the door open and slipping into the room, pulling it closed behind him. It was dark inside the room, windowless again, and he whispered a silencing spell before casting a gentle
Harry frowned at him, taking in the tense set to Malfoy's shoulders and the look of hesitancy hovering in his eyes, as though he were waiting for a blow to fall.
Harry moved through the landscape of the dead for an age, or for a heartbeat. He felt like he was suspended in an eternal moment. The only sound was the harsh panting of his own breath. Everywhere he looked were sightless eyes, accusing faces.
'Tease?' he asked, pushing at Draco's hips. 'Flip over and I'll show you a tease.' He swallowed heavily, licking at his lips. 'I still haven't forgotten what it felt like that time you did it to me.'
'Relax, Mr. Potter,' Ladon said. 'We’re not starting yet. Your last visit was … shall we say, rushed.' Harry's memories of the night churned through him and he recalled coming in to confront Ladon, and the next minute agreeing to be bound and -
Draco looked at him like he didn't believe the words, but he turned his hand so that his own clasped with Harry's. The grip was tight, like he didn't want to let go.
'What the fuck are we doing?' Draco hissed at him in alarm. Harry was still in his red and gold Auror uniform. He didn't turn to look at Draco, but muttered out of the corner of his mouth.
Then Malfoy turned back to the hob, lifting the kettle off as he muttered something Harry didn't catch.
Harry held up his hands to stop Malfoy, casting a Patronus and speaking quickly to the stag as it stood before him, head tossing impatiently.
volume 278-280. All of the paperwork was in order - permits, spell forms, trading licences, purchase receipts - the works. It was all totally above board. Another seven folders contained his yearly tax returns and receipts for the club over the period he'd operated it. At a glance, everything seemed to be in order. He couldn't see any obvious signs of laundering.
Harry ripped himself out of the mind of the man in front of him and clenched his fists to stop the magic that was rising through every part of his body. He wanted to tear this building down, to bury every one of these bastards in it. He forced himself to breathe and to keep his magic contained. He bit his cheek until he tasted blood, hot and coppery, and then he let the Imperius Curse dissolve and blasted an Obliviation at the man that left him slack-jawed.
No, with Muggles, he just got the curious looks, the wonder at the lines of pale scars that travelled down over his forehead, across his eye and spilled onto his cheek, like a web of lightning striking against his darker skin.
'Harry, dear,' she said, eyes red from weeping. 'Ginny's this way. She needs you now. Come, love.' Molly's arm was around his waist, her hand rubbing soothingly at his side as she steered him towards the group of people.
'For Peony?' he asks, as though he can't smell Draco's triumph in the air. That had been their first clue to the anomaly. Flower shipments. They only happened once or twice a year and every time they did, the alternate locations and buyers matched up. It had to be the pattern, they had nothing else to go on.
Malfoy shook his head slowly. 'He wouldn't,' he murmured, then louder, 'he wouldn't,' almost as if he were trying to convince himself.
'What the hell are you doing?' Malfoy says. 'Get back in bed. You've broken the bloody cut open again, you idiot. It's bleeding down your back.'
Jefferson might be small but she had a no-nonsense tone that quelled most beasts and which Harry had to actively work to ignore. Paperwork wasn't worth the fight. He saved the fight up for when he wanted to bring in a Chimaera for rehoming, or get onto the team transporting a Sphinx back to Egypt.
Harry pushed himself off Draco's lap and stood. He unbuttoned his jeans with a rough movement and shoved them down, his cock bobbing free he bent to push them off, kicking off his shoes with an awkward, hopping movement.
'Do you want to speak now?' she asked softly, and Harry looked past her, eyes moving slowly from face to face as he realised everyone was watching them, had eyes fixed on either Ginny or himself.
'I want to—' Harry gasped, kissing him again as though he couldn't stop himself. 'Draco, I really want to fuck you right now. Please, please can I?'
Harry started, to hear words that hadn't been spoken in over ten years. He shook his head. 'I left it in the forest. You know that.'
Draco's eyes dropped to the box and he stared at it for a long moment before reaching out to slide it towards himself.
'Fine,' he rasped. At her skeptical look he shrugged. 'Tired.' Then he focused on the more important thing. 'What happened to everyone else?'
Under each was detailed a range of specific experiences, actions or scenarios. He felt his shock growing as he scanned his eyes down the list - he had no idea some of these things even
Harry swayed slightly on his feet and Draco felt his heart lurch at the sudden uncertainty on Harry's face as their eyes met.
Satisfied everything was as it should be, Harry pushed the door open and stepped onto the street outside. He threw his leg over his motorcycle, kicking the stand out as he started it up with a rumble. The street was busy, but there was an air of nervous tension about it. People hurried along the footpaths, looking around them constantly, cars flowed through, almost breaking red lights in the need to keep moving. This part of the city was neither wizarding nor Muggle. In fact, most of the city was like that. Harry had liked that about Prague, the first time he'd visited it, years before. Now, though, the integration between Muggles and Wizards, and the simmering fear and hatred that sat underneath it, just made everything feel more desperate.
Ladon made a sound that might have been a groan or a laugh and then the vibrator was rubbing between Harry's legs again, underneath his balls, in that soft place that sent its rumbling shivering up into his stomach, pooling there like fire.
Harry grunted, leaning back in his seat. 'There'd be strings attached. The likes of that lot don't offer a cup of tea if they're not getting something in return.'
Rose nodded and looked at Harry. 'Butterbeer makes me feel happy, Uncle Harry. Do you want me to go home and get her?'
Harry can taste the sharpness of Draco's release and the salty tang of it on the warmth of his skin makes him whimper. His hips jerk unconsciously and he sinks himself back into Draco's arse as he opens his mouth, sucking Draco's thumb hard, chasing the taste of him. Draco leads him forward until his thumb slides out and they're sharing a kiss that tastes of him. It's wet and filthy and Harry's never had anything as perfect as this moment.
'Unfortunate history?' Harry interjected derisively, standing up straight and crossing his arms again. 'That's the understatement of the century. You were a Death Eater. You got people killed. You spent years humiliating my friends. You smashed my face in -'
Draco turned back to the letters. 'That's pretty clear. The Heir, whoever he is, has been getting more and more blatant in his communication. They started out a few years ago, couching their correspondence in reflections on the masters -' he paused at Harry's confused look.
Once he was outside, he pulled his cloak back on, trying to close his eyes and ears against the screams of fear and pain around himself. He couldn't. He felt, for a moment, like he was walking through the Battle of Hogwarts again, turning away from his friends, away from those he could have saved. He squared his shoulders, trying to bring back some of that same resigned certainty he'd had on that night. He had to think of the bigger picture—he had to chase down the bigger danger.
Malfoy takes a sip of his drink and his voice is quieter, when he speaks. His eyes are still on his glass, the liquid in it swirling slowly. 'But the more I looked, the more I found things that were wrong. And I was so sick of people using ignorance as an excuse.'
He pushed his hips down until they were flush with Harry's. Until Harry was buried deep inside him. Harry groaned with the feeling of it and brought his hands up to grip Draco's thighs, unable to stop himself from touching. It was all he could do not to fuck himself up into Draco, to snap his hips forward and chase his pleasure until he came. He'd never felt anything as good as this.
'Potter, what are you—' he pauses and Markwell's dark eyes drop to Harry's chest. 'Are you wearing my shirt?' For a second his glamour shifts and Harry sees Draco's face, heat rising in his eyes as he bites his lip. Then Markwell's image snaps into place again.
It had been dead still in the Ministry for three days now - the heat had gone up and down with various levels of intensity, but the air had been still, something that made the temperature even more unbearable. Harry turned away from Dave's smile when he felt the air buffet against him. He caught sight of a swirl of black robes disappearing around the corner. Something about it tugged at his memory. Harry stood, moving away from Dave without another thought.
Blake's eyes were suddenly razor-sharp. 'This is important, Catalyst,' they said, leaning forward. 'Did it speak to you?'
Draco shivered slightly as Harry's magic flowed over him, his breathing coming faster as he stared at Harry. He didn't move or speak and Harry was afraid that he'd gone too far - had finally told Draco the thing that would drive him away.
Harry stood in front of his mirror, trying to decide which shirt to wear. Should he wear something more casual, or wear a button up - what was the etiquette for something like this? If it was anything like last time, he wouldn't be keeping his shirt on … the thought made him flush slightly and he pushed it away. It wasn't like that.
Harry shrugs, forcing a cocky grin onto his face. 'It was worse than it looked. I'm fine. What's next?'
'We run quads for a reason. It gives us an offence, a defense, a medic evac and a watcher. Your plan to bring them down to one or two people teams is going to leave Aurors open to all sorts of Dark Attacks when -'
He sniffed and wiped at his eyes, trying to get himself under control. He wasn't a boy anymore. And even when he had been, he hadn't cried in front of Molly. She had been his mother-in-law for ten years and a mother in all but name, and he'd never cried in front of her.
'Write what you are on the top, pet,' she instructed, interrupting his chain of thought. 'The form will change accordingly.'
He spent the next twenty four hours in a state of restless agitation. He almost forgot to wish Ginny a good trip as she packed on Friday morning and headed off to catch her International Portkey for the New York Yetis coaching clinic she'd been invited to. She’d seemed on the verge of saying something all morning as they moved around each other, each getting ready for the day … but despite the looks and the hesitations, she didn’t speak. And Harry didn’t push her. If felt cowardly … but he didn’t know if he wanted to have that conversation with her … whatever it was.
His last stop was the living room. He knew what he wanted from here. He crossed to the mantlepiece and picked up a photo of James. It had been taken a few months earlier. Harry held it and watched as James cackled in laughter, almost tipping himself off the side of the couch. A moment later Harry's head appeared, as he took off the invisibility cloak. James was obscured for a moment and then Harry disappeared again and James returned. His face was startled, before he burst back into happy laughter.
Harry takes a step back, away from Malfoy's touch, and takes another deep breath. Some of the scents from the club come back through as he moves further away from Malfoy.
it. He wondered if it was anything like the thrill he felt when he had the entire room hanging on his words as they pulled a case together.
Harry thought of Slughorn's memory all those years ago. He thought of how the Felix flowed through him, making him feel light in a way he couldn't remember feeling in so, so long. He breathed in the smoke again and felt his tiredness sink into his bones. He thought of how St Mungo's had banned him from Dreamless after he'd needed three bottles a night to keep the nightmares at bay. Harry was pretty sure Hermione still cast a seeking spell for it on the rare occasions she visited.
'I submitted my father's name because I believe he is intimately involved in these crimes, if not masterminding them. Everything I gathered through his correspondence reinforced that belief. He is a very dangerous man, with very dangerous ideas.'
Ginny relaxed again. 'I'm staying with Liz, from the team, just for a few weeks. I'll probably look for something after New Years. I -' she hesitated. 'Aiden and I have talked, and we want to take things slowly … just so you know.'
Despite the fact he's done everything he can to drive that part of him away, the wolf has always made itself available to him. It
Harry takes another deep breath, breathing in Malfoy's scent, the familiarity of it calming him. He needs to be calm. This close to the full moon, if he loses his shit, he could do a lot of damage to Malfoy, shifted or not.
He thought of the truths he'd realised under Ladon's hands, the needs he'd accepted in himself, the forgiveness he'd allowed himself to have.
His heartbeat sped up as he considered what he needed to do. He had three days to get ready. Three days to immerse himself in Potter's memories. Three days to learn how to imitate Potter's dead husband, down to the smallest detail.
'I needed to see Malfoy,' he said, not sure what else to say. 'What happened in there? Who was that?'
Harry is holding on to Malfoy again when they land and he pushes him away with annoyance. 'You have to stop doing that.'
would, would they? What are you doing here? Since when do you work private security?' The disdain is back in his voice, full force. He looks Harry up and down. 'Are you here by choice? What the fuck made you quit the Ministry to take a dodgy job in a shitshow organisation like this?'
Dec 18: @keyflight790 commissioned the incredible @anokaba to illustrate Harry bound and awaiting what he thinks he deserves. The art is here:
Malfoy glared down at Harry. He didn't bother asking if Harry believed him. The truth of his words was written in his implacable stare.
Harry sips his tea before putting it on his dresser and collecting a clean set of clothes. A part of him doesn't want to shower. Even after the wipe down and a night of sleep without Draco beside him, all he can smell is Draco and he loves it. But he knows he needs to. He sighs and is about to collect a towel when he thinks more fully about what's about to happen.
'Good morning, everyone,' he began, putting on his 'public speeches' voice. 'I will be accompanying you today, along with Aurors Jones, Smith and Johnson.' He indicated each in turn. 'We don't anticipate any issues on the excursion - the Muggle world is not a dangerous place - but we will also be along to make sure that you all feel safe and comfortable in what might feel like a daunting experience. Please call on us at any point during the day. Are there any questions?'
times before. He looked to be in his early fifties, hair graying and face worn, but despite that his gaze was sharp.
Then he sighed and poured the second memory in. This death reminded him of one other he'd looked into, months earlier. That man had been left in a public place as well. Harry stood up, walking to the wall as he scanned over his notes until he pulled off the sheet he wanted. He skimmed over it, biting the inside of his cheek as he read. Public place was the same, but the manner of death was completely different. The Slovakian man had had every single bone in his body broken, though his skin had been intact. No one had been able to figure out how it had happened. Harry ran his finger down the page. Intact except for...
The rumble was louder now. A sharp crack of thunder shook the Ministry beneath their feet and Harry looked up. His alarm rose as he saw black thunderclouds began to fill the sky.
'My name is Harry,' he said, stepping away and reaching into his pocket for his smokes. He tapped one out and lit it up.
'Have you seen today's rubbish?' he demanded, throwing it down on Harry's desk. Harry took in Malfoy's appearance - his brows were drawn down in a scowl and his face was slightly flushed. His hair looked tousled, as though he'd been running his hands through it. Harry suddenly wondered if that was the appearance Malfoy had meant to reveal.
Harry shrugged. 'If there is, we haven’t found it yet. We're not ruling anything out, but …' He spread his hands as if to say it was unlikely.
'More,' Ladon said, and Harry slipped his hands off the arm and onto the cushion, leaning forward. His legs widened automatically and he knew his arsehole was on display now, as well as his balls, held tight by the band around them. The thought made his whole body tense in anticipation.
Jeffries was a stickler for his filing, so Harry had no trouble finding Malfoy's case and flipping to the most recent updates. There was a packet of dry biscuits in the drawer as well, so Harry opened them, eating them one by one as he read. His stomach protested at him, wanting something more substantial. He couldn't remember the last time he'd eaten. Yesterday? The day before?
Draco dropped his hand and Harry felt the absence of the almost-touch like a blow. Draco's face almost looked disappointed and he went to turn away.
He remembers seeing Draco's name on the Black family tree, and remembers his anger, years ago at thinking Malfoy had any connection to Sirius—the blood connection that Harry would have killed to have. Anything to feel less alone in the world.
'It's so frustrating, Harry. It's like they're deliberately walling me off because I don't specialise in the same field as they do. It's the exact same thing I had with the French, Malaysian, and Chinese Ministries. It's like there's some worldwide conspiracy to keep knowledge and control of magical creatures in the hands of the few.' She huffs in frustration, and puts an arm around Rose, pulling her in close. 'I have half a mind to re-train and change fields.'
He pushed up from his seat and made his way out of his office, past Mrs. Norris' empty desk and into the Auror HQ break room. He could see rows of empty desks through the window, with one or two of the night shift members gazing listlessly at documents as they counted down the minutes to seven am. He collected a teabag and held his cup under the 'MagiBoil', staring blankly at the 'Chosen Mug' and his fifteen year old face holding up an intake number before his Wizengamot trial. Ron had thought it was hilarious when he'd unearthed the photo one day when he'd come in to help Harry with his Junior Auror filing workload. Harry'd featured prominently on the Department's Most Wanted wall for half a year … until a series of disappearances related to the purchase of heirloom jewelry from a forfeited pureblood house had bumped the joke off the board.
Ladon bit his lip, clearly struggling with his desire and his reluctance. 'Wouldn't that defeat the purpose?' he said at last.
. Malfoy's voice slices back into his mind, cutting through his barriers, an edge of desperation to the push of it.
Avery cocked his head, looking beyond Harry to Draco, face mocking. 'He's in a safe place. He's in the place the heir should be. Where the proper heir should have been.' Avery's face turned sneering, but Draco suddenly knew - and cursed himself for not realising it earlier.
He bit his lip, thrusting faster, grinding back harder. His rhythm steadied and he could feel his pleasure building.
Harry had an uncomfortable thought. He didn't know if he should voice it but at the same time, he felt like the words were crawling out of his throat. 'I—I met two people,' he said. 'In Prague. One was a DeathKeeper at an Ossuary, the other was... I'm not sure, a tree spirit maybe. They both named me a Dominus—a Master of Death.' He paused, nausea rising in him at the memory of their bodies. 'They were both killed and mutilated.'
Aoife paused and scowled again. 'And up you waltz and just bloody kill that woman, letting Conquest loose, happy as you please, no heed for the consequences. No heed for the damage a source can do when it's loose in the world again, looking for a secondary agent to subvert.' Aoife smacked her hand on the table, making her disgust and anger clear. She barely drew a breath before she continued, her words getting faster and faster.
'Malfoy?' Harry said, blinking and rubbing his face. He heard the rustle of papers and looked down to see the case file still spread out all over his bed. With an annoyed flick of his fingers at his carelessness, he gathered it up and sent it sailing into the bedside drawer, locking it wordlessly.
Draco raised his wand again and again, showing Harry his life after the war. His realisations. His changes. He drew out his first, halting experiences with Muggles and how damnably
'Harry?' came Hermione's voice from downstairs. Harry jumped at the unexpected sound and grabbed a black t-shirt. He pulled it on, then dashed downstairs. Hermione's head was in the Floo and she looked him up and down with curiosity.
He felt heat rise in him at the words, at the image of the man melting under her tender touch, after such violence had been done to him by the same hand.
Draco left every day at five to collect Scorpius from his school care, but Harry was surprised when he came in on Saturday as well.
He needs— He needs— He grinds against Draco and then growls with frustration, reaching down to lift him, hooking Draco's legs around him as he pushes him harder against the wall and thrusts against him. Draco gives a grunt of surprise but tightens his legs, pulling Harry hard against him.
Malfoy hummed in satisfaction again and then Harry felt a finger pressing at him. He relaxed and felt Malfoy's slicked finger slip inside. He pushed back against in, closing his eyes as Malfoy worked it inside him, sliding another in and crooking them just so.
His eyes adjust to the dim light and he realises they're in another of Malfoy's garages. Malfoy eyes him a moment longer but Harry doubts he can see much.
'I can't,' Harry cried, as he lifted his head and thudded it into Ron's chest. His grief poured through him like a river, like it was his blood, spilling from him, draining him of life.
'But yes, I would love to just grab a Portkey and go somewhere new. See some part of the world I never have before.' He met Harry's eyes and something in his face spoke of a longing that Harry saw in his reflection when everything got a bit too much and he hadn't been on a trip in a while. 'You must have been just about everywhere by now?'
'That's not a piece of information that's made it to the papers,' he says, his voice filled with a casualness that would sound totally natural if Harry couldn't smell Malfoy's sudden interest.
Draco's hand doesn't let up, his thumb rubbing lightly along the edge of Harry's jaw, the very spot he'd rub against another wolf to scent mark them. It's soothing, to Harry and the wolf. He lets himself focus on it, breathing in the scent of Draco, warm and comforting. He smells faintly of Harry from wearing his clothes all day, and it's reassuring. It makes Draco feel like his.
Malfoy didn't fight back. Didn't dispute it. He just stood there, shoulders slumped, looking at Harry with an expression of helpless pain.
He was lost in his own head, his feet taking a familiar path, and he didn't realise it until he found himself in the doorway of Malfoy's bedroom. He looked around, unable to help himself, as he noted the changes. It had been redecorated, painted in tasteful blues and creams. Harry wondered if that was Malfoy's doing, or that of the wife he'd lost with the birth of his son.
'And how exactly did you let that lead to you fucking him?' Pansy demanded, fixing him with hard eyes.
Harry wondered, suddenly, if Malfoy could cast Legilimency just as well while his subjects were awake. He strengthened his shields just in case.
It was a list of … of experiences, was the only way he could describe it. He looked at the main headings.
, Felix whispered. Harry knew that was a bad idea. Knew it was crazy. No one knew he was here. He would be making himself vulnerable to Malfoy. He'd be asleep. Harry glanced around the room - he'd be asleep with a dozen others while Malfoy walked among them. He hadn't seen Malfoy in years; had no idea who he'd become.
He pushed his way out of bed and slumped heavily into the chair by the window. He reached for the bottle of whiskey he'd stolen, not even bothering with a glass. He cracked it open and lifted it to his lips, drinking deeply, wincing against the burn.
If this were any other job, Draco would have written up his notes and sent them straight through to Healer Jeffries. This was what she needed to help Harry unpack his issues and move towards healing and closure.
'I miss you so, so much.' The words were a wail, barely formed. Harry felt like he was tearing apart with them, unravelling and disappearing.
At six - half a dozen rollies and three cups of coffee later - an owl tapped against his window. His wand was deposited on the bench as soon as he opened it and the owl took flight back out the open window immediately. Harry picked up his wand, cradling it in his fingers as he watched the bird fly away. He was still undecided as he showered and dressed for work.
Rudolf Avery looked to be in his early twenties and was the grandson of the Avery Harry had come up against during the war. He was one of those who hadn't shaken off his upbringing by the looks of him.
Harry frowned, trying to think. Malfoy hadn't reached for his wand, though Harry had had his out. 'No, I think it just started happening as we were talking. It only got really bad when I tried to stun him.'
Harry remained quiet, as Draco tried to unravel his own thoughts, but then he spoke, and there was an almost-defiant note in his voice, as though he was expecting to be told he was wrong.
Ron stands from the bed and crosses the room to him, pulling him into a hug. Harry returns it, overwhelmed at the way everything is coming together. Everything is working out in a way he never could have dreamed of a few short weeks ago.
'Why are you bringing me, then?' Harry asked, not wanting to dissuade her, but a bit bewildered by everything that had just happened.
'Service access,' Ron said, in response to Harry's curious look. 'Kitchens, waste disposal, stock orders, that sort of thing.'
On the morning they hear from Davies, Malfoy has glamoured into a version of himself that Harry thinks he could have become, if his post-War fortunes had turned on him. He's skinny to the point of emaciation, with scabs around his mouth and a yellow tinge to his pale skin. He looks like a potions addict at the very end of the cycle. Harry's arrested enough of them to know that without intervention, death would come soon for Malfoy in this form.
Harry followed his eyes, and for a second he thought he could hear it, whispers at the very edge of his hearing, words too fast to catch, hissing and spitting. He frowned and looked around, and as soon as he did so, the whispers cut off, as though they'd never been.
Harry looks down at it then up at Malfoy, whose face is set in a satisfied smile which holds a hint of smugness.
Harry nodded and moved across, reaching into the bag and pulling out the collar. He ran his fingers over it, anticipation tingling through him, and then placed it on the bar.
Harry watched her go, and then absently locked the door to his office with a wave of his hand. He looked at the case for long minutes, thoughts swirling through his mind. A part of him wanted to open it. To view the memories and to finally understand
'Potter,' Malfoy said, drawing closer, his eyes sliding up Harry's body in an appraisal he didn’t try to hide. Harry reddened slightly under the look, feeling strangely flustered. Malfoy wasn't into blokes, was he? He'd been married to a woman.
Harry woke in his bed with no real understanding of where he was or how he'd got there. He lay quietly in the dark, letting the memories seep back in, and as he did, he curled in tighter and tighter on himself.
Malfoy handed him a drink and Harry was only slightly surprised to see that of all the drinks on offer, it was the elf-made wine he'd been drinking since he arrived. Malfoy slid into a seat beside him.
They watched the show a while longer, making comments now and again about an architectural decision that looked hideous, or a price blow out.
And for those of you who were moved to comment for the first time ever on this story, thank you. It means so much to know my words have touched you in some way.
Harry hesitated for a moment on his answer, wishing he'd thought more about it before Apparating over, but then he shrugged, deciding on the truth.
The voice inside him whispered again, asking why it mattered that Ladon approved of his choices, but Harry pushed it away, looking up as Ladon spoke.
He laughed and Draco did too, stroking his hand over Scorpius' hair and tucking his son into his side.
'Five levels of tunnels are open to the public,' David is still saying. 'You can purchase tour tickets here, if you like. The rest of the tunnels extend for miles, though they've been blocked off to the public. They pop out in all sorts of places along the cliffs. Fascinating stuff,' David repeats.
'I didn't want to give you any reason to get handsy again,' he says as he climbs into bed. Harry notices that he takes the side furthest from the wall. He wants to be able to make a quick escape if he can. It's this thought that stops Harry from teasing him further.
A moment later Malfoy walked into the room, wearing a white t-shirt and grey joggers, a dish towel slung over one shoulder. He halted when he saw Harry, pinking slightly.
'What is this place?' Harry asked, looking around. The interior gave no clues as to what service it provided.
'Sorry,' Harry blurts, hands dropping to the hem of the shirt. He needs to remove it, and leave the room, and stop letting his instincts rule him.
Rothwell takes Draco's hand and shakes it, considering him. He's a thin man, well-dressed and in his early forties by the look of him. His hair is combed back so hard that it looks glued to his head and the look on his face is calculating. Harry can't sense a direct threat in him, more the sort of a cunning caution that smaller predators have.
Harry shook his head. 'Seeker's game. Me and you. We never did have one. I used to play against the other seekers all the time, but you always trained alone.'
He gave a bitter laugh, heedless of whether Malfoy heard him, the sound cutting something open inside of him. Shutting down the feelings he'd thought were real. Nothing Malfoy had said to him had been the truth. He felt his magic stir again, seeking the source of his pain. It reached out into the air around him, crackling like static.
They're both fully hard now and Harry can smell Draco's pre-come in the air. It's sharp and Harry wants to lick it into his mouth and rub it all over himself. He wants to be covered in Draco until they will never be able to get the smell of each other out of their skin.
He went to the front desk to check in with Dahlia - to wait for Harry, if he was honest. He had a feeling she could see right through him. He hadn't done a scene with a sub in weeks - since Harry had left. The grin that she shot him when Harry walked through the door was both triumphant and mocking.
Harry ignored it and kept reading, filing away the various sightings and connections she had made. They would all be valuable.
The scents of Malfoy are so much stronger in the air now. To a normal human nose, it would be a faint odour, soon absorbed into the rock. To the wolf, Malfoy has just marked territory. The only thing more appealing would be the smell of his come. The wolf surges forward at the thought of that and Harry grunts as he shuts his jaw tight and clenches his hands into fists.
Davies' lip curls slightly in an unspoken threat, but he turns back to Malfoy, clasping one of his hands in two meaty paws.
Harry let out a sound, half gasp, half sob and wrenched his eyes open, gritting his teeth as he swallowed heavily against the burning in his throat. A keening cry escaped him and he bit down on his cheek until the metallic tang of blood filled his mouth.
'I don't know if it was harder for her,' he mused, 'because she comes from such a big family. Or for me, because I've never had a family and I wanted one so bad.' Ladon's arms tightened around Harry, but he didn't comment, so Harry continued.
The wards around the grounds of Parkinson Estate let them through the gates without challenge. Pansy was waiting at the door.
One of the well known Muggle primary schools featured in a number of Bright's photos. Harry had since found out that some of the more progressive members of the Society had been sending their children there. There were also pictures from one or two restaurants that the Magical-Muggle Education trips had visited, which certain members had been taken with and now made regular visits to. It was looking more and more like a targeted attack. The question that mattered though - the only one they couldn't answer - was
Ginny shook her head immediately. 'It's fine, Harry. I thought about that, and Grimmauld Place has always been yours. You have more of a claim to it than I do. I think - a fresh start is probably what I'm after.'
Harry swallowed, forcing the words from his mouth, choking back his bitterness at begging Malfoy for anything. 'Please. I can’t think about anything else. ' It wasn't a lie. The thought of being in his parents' presence again - of having their arms around him - had been gnawing at him since he'd woken up from the dream two days ago. He'd seen inside Victor's mind. He'd seen how desperate his need was to get back to the bar - how all-consuming. It wasn't hard to put that in his eyes.
A moment later a woman stepped up beside him. She was completely naked but didn't seem at all self-conscious of the fact. Her eyes were fixed intensely on Ladon as he stood, surrounded by the dangling ropes. She walked towards him, movements graceful and sure, and when she reached him, she sank to her knees and bowed her head.
'I stayed though,' he throws a glance at Harry again. 'I stayed. I deserved it, I thought. Even after Azkaban, clearly I hadn't paid enough, and this was more of my penance.'
Hermione looked hurt at that question. 'We came here for you,' she said, voice soft. 'Like we always would. You've been getting our letters, I know you have. We're worried about you, Harry. We haven't heard back from you in over a year and now you turn up and you need something from
'I won't be able to help myself,' Harry says, his voice rising as he feels his teeth begin to sharpen in his mouth.
Harry shook his head. 'No. It's not good for the creatures. You can do it, but you often get losses in groups of small creatures and it makes the really big ones sick or angry. It's easier just to transport them by land or air.'
'It's delicious,' Malfoy says, tilting his head slightly to the side as he speaks, just enough to subtly bare his neck. Davies eyes flick to it and Harry feels a snarl rise in his chest. He'd told Malfoy that Davies was a were to warn him, not so Malfoy could whore himself out.
he could to get the upper hand on the enormous silver wolf tearing into him. For a moment, they had been in sync. He had seen through the wolf's eyes, had felt their desire merge into one. A second later, the wolf had leapt and the connection had been gone. Harry had been pulled back under.
' Aoife murmured, giving Conor a wide-eyed look. Conor shook his head minutely in an expression Harry didn't know if he was supposed to catch. Luna had leaned forward and was studying Harry with interest. Harry remembered her father's area of study—the Hallows—and thought that perhaps mentioning this had been a mistake.
.' An enhanced version of the Minister's voice booms out over the packed Ministry atrium. There is a flurry of clicking as cameras flash, the reporters' seats a buzz of action.
'We've both made a mess of things, haven't we?' Harry said, tracing the scars with his fingertips. He could feel guilt running through him, shame following it, mixing up inside him. The mist thickened around them until it began to fall as droplets of rain. Draco shook his head and leaned in to kiss Harry again.
Harry felt his jaw clench and he looked away, putting the smoke up to his lips and sucking back until he felt the heat on the ends of his fingers. He flicked it to the ground and stamped it out and then looked back at Ron as he blew the smoke out.
Draco took a step closer and looked down at Harry. Sleek black cord hung loosely from his hand. He cocked an eyebrow, as though able to sense Harry's disquiet. The ghost of a smirk crossed his mouth and all the uncertainty was suddenly gone.
Harry groaned and clenched hard, his torso rising from the bed as he came in hot stripes over his chest. He panted through it, whimpering at the intensity of his orgasm.
'Death took James from me,' Harry continued, voice determined. 'And these people know how to stop it.'
He looked almost exactly the same as he had thirteen years before, when Harry had seen him at his trial - when he'd spoken for Malfoy's wife and son, but not for him. Never for him. His long blond hair still flowed down over his shoulders, shining in the light from the room. His face was still pointed and cruel, lined now but retaining that edge of contempt.
Harry looks back at Ron, who's waiting in the doorway for him, and he can't think of a reason not to go. He can feel his wolf shifting restlessly within him and his instincts are very clearly telling him that he should stay with Draco, that so newly mated he should be with him, to watch over him and protect him. He reminds himself that Draco is more than capable of protecting himself and he doesn't need Harry for that in the slightest. He gives Draco a small smile and follows Ron out the door and up the stairs.
Her hands returned to his back with a soft, 'Oh,' and she scratched again, though it wasn't as hard.
But look at him. Draco couldn't even have a relationship without poisoning it. There was something wrong with him. Something wrong at the heart of him.
After a second, Malfoy relaxes and Harry sees him nod in the darkness, though his eyes aren't quite fixed on Harry's. Malfoy pulls his arm away and then his fingers are bumping against Harry's. Harry catches them, reflexively.
'That's not how this works,' he said, knowing it sounded more like a question, but needing Draco to know.
Draco swiftly evaluated what he knew of the young woman in front of him and decided a direct approach would suit her best. That, laced with a touch of flattery …
,' Malfoy said again. His movements began to speed up and he moaned softly. Harry watched his face, something stirring inside his chest, an unfamiliar heat curling within him as he realised Malfoy was bringing himself off.
The Ministry the next morning was a whole new world. All traces of the rivers that had been travelling down the passageways and the lakes that had been forming in stairwells were gone. Instead, Harry felt as though he'd stepped out of the portkey office at Kuala Lumpur. His trip the year before in search of Demiguises had been one of his favourites, once he'd adjusted to the 80-90% humidity that combined with the heat to smack him in the face every time he went outside. The windows reflected Harry's memories back at him. Everywhere he looked, there was a riot of steamy jungle vistas, rather than the standard open green fields he was used to seeing in the public areas.
In the image, they looked so young, even if it was only a few years ago. Their smiles so bright, hands clasped together in a tight grip, eyes squinting they were so happy being next to each other. Laughing to himself again, Draco remembered how many times it took for them to get it right- more realistically, how many times it took Harry to get the timer correct.
At one am, there was a knock at his door, one that had a jingle to it Harry couldn't refuse. Stumbling off the settee, Harry's blurry and sluggish demeanor remained the same as he heavy-handedly opened the door with a crash when it hit the wall. Standing, pristine and proper as always, outside his door was Draco Malfoy.
It looked like a jewellery box it was so gorgeous. The diamonds, emeralds, littered the boxes red lid Opening the box he kept sacred for times he felt down, he began to read.
When his ears were basically shredded in half by the harsh pull of the wires, Draco gasped. Shooting up like a kid having a terrible nightmare, Draco gasped at his mom. "Why? The song was almost done!" He complained.
"I can't believe they've cancelled Quidditch." Sighed Ginny, sitting a few seats down with her friends.
Su Li wanted to be the first Asian female in English Wizarding World politics. He found that incredibly ambitious for Hufflepuff's, but greatly welcomed some more diversity in politics other than white. Kingsley didn't count to Draco, because Potter is the reason he is in power.
Nodding so small Draco could have imagined it, Harry's hands came down around the rim of his shirt and lingered there for a while just running his hands around it wondering what to do. Eventually, gently as he could, Potter lifted the fabric over his head peeling off the disgusting, torn shirt to reveal scars, cuts and bruises littering his chest.
At night, Draco was finally stumped on what to do. "I don't have another bedroom set up, Potter, and I suppose you wouldn't want to sleep in my room..." he paused, pondering over what to do when a quiet voice popped up.
“Harry Potter...” the whisper of his name made Harry jump, his hand connecting with the handle to jiggle it open, but it looked like Vernon had just locked it.
"Go ask Hermione!" Muffled Ron into his pillow. Within seconds, the door was slammed shut and the five boys relaxed in their beds. "It is six am." Ron groaned.
"Would you like to stand with us, Mister Malfoy?" He jumped at the chance, hugging Harry tightly then bouncing off with a smiling McGonagall. The moment the girls excited the carriage, they sped to Draco, trying to act properly but pushing on the borders. That border was pushed when they enveloped him in a breath-taking embrace. "C'est incroyable de te revoir Draco! Comment va Poudlard? N'est-ce pas mieux que Beauxbatons?" Fleur Delacour said, cupping the boy's cheeks, examining his features, "Oh comment tu as grandi ... tu es encore plus beau que l'année dernière Draco."
"I'm here." Managing just fine! Harry found his way to Draco holding him by the elbows, "to talk to you. My father called me when I was driving here- he said there's a slot free in my dorm and on my team for my choosing at collage." He heard the intake of breath and was slightly thankful for his nose not being so abused, "I'd like you to join me."
Soon enough, the three became equated (or re-equated in Narcissa and Sirius' case) quickly and Sirius told Draco all about Hogwarts. This included his godson and his best friends.
Immediately, Potter got stuck into it: practically throwing himself down on the many blankets and pillows to find the right one. Triumphant, Draco watched, fascinated with the man, as he fluffed all the pillows to find the right ones to go inside. The blonde man smirked.
The blonde turned to him with a sparkling smile, “I’ve known them since I was small. Our mothers are close, childhood friends.” harry nodded, still not very pleased with it. Even more so when Zabini called for Draco- in French, nonetheless. “Qu'est-ce que ça fait de rencontrer ton idole, Draco?” His tone was teasing and Harry assumed it was an insult at the French-boy’s scowl.
Speaking of things I adore: Potter. I've been in love with the git since I was in diapers. But how can I keep loving someone so intensely who hates me? Hates me to the point they try and kill me... even though it was justified.
"Look! Right..." her hand scanned the lines until she reached one with the quote she was looking for, but Li found it first.
"Need a hug?" His voice leaking sarcasm from the corners of his mouth. "I won't call you; I'll be far too busy. Don't have time. Right," the blonde sighed standing up shoving his hands and pack of cigarettes in his pockets, "I'm going to the bathroom, wherever the bathroom is."
“About a minute since you last asked.” Ron grinned, taking pleasure in his friend’s nervousness because that was the only fun he’d be having in those dress robes. The clearing of a throat brought Harry out of his thoughts. He looked up the stairs to see Draco. Dark, royal blue robes flowed to his knees, a silver belt holding black dress-trousers tightly to his thin waste. His lighter shade of azure shirt. Leather brown boots with golden spirals at the top were tucked into the tight trousers. Like an angel from heaven, Draco descended the stairs, his eyes sparkled and smile grew contagious.
"You're learning French, Monsieur Potter?" He smiled at Harry, "Thank you, it's really... warming." Draco said tenderly, planting another kiss to Harry's cheek. Before Harry could even talk, Draco was clinging tightly to his arm. "They're here! They're here!" He repeated until McGonagall walked over.
I tried apologising to everyone! I sent letters, I even got a muggle phone to try and call the non-pureblood prejudice people- the normal people. Only Potter even stayed to listen to the first word out of my mouth.
"He's just excited to see everyone again. I would be if I were him." Neville argued, standing for the first time then stretching.
"I'm here for Draco." He said, slingling an arm around the blonde who immediately pushed it off. However, he wouldn't look Harry in the eye and the red wouldn't dissappear from his cheeks. Smirking, Harry also took that as a success.
Looking on, the older Weasley’s besides Arthur (who was just as clueless as Ron) smiled. Fred and George exchanged knowing glances, mentally preparing themselves for the things they’ll have to witness in the future. Percy was happy for them. Surprisingly, he was very fond of Draco, it seemed they were on a similar level of intellect and maturity.
"For your information,” he said slowly, drawing out the third word, “the curses used to be used for good reasons too. Imperious was used to try and... fix the brain, when it is presumed you were brain dead. The Killing Curse was used to quickly and painlessly (than any other way of dying) kill an incurable dying patient. Lastly, there is the Cruciatus Curse, the worse of the three in my opinion. It was used to try and re-awaken the heart." With that he walked out with his bag tightly on his shoulder. Next to leave was Blaise and Theo, glaring and sneering at everyone, even more to the teacher.
When the final note was sung, they both took deep breathes but remained looking the other in the eyes. Green gladly invaded Draco's sight. Grey graced Harry's line of vision. "Harry!" He blurted out before he could stop himself and became all embarrassed that Draco chuckled.
All the boys groaned, but Neville was the first up. He heard the blonde's excitement and decided to wake to smile at the rabbit-like boy. Seamus and Ron didn't shake, but Dean and Harry woke after with loud yawns to a frustrated cry.
From the stairs there was hammering of feet, and Harry saw a head of blonde hair. The boy automatically thought he was dead. But Draco ran over to Ron, “You idiotic Gryffindor!” He hit Ron four times in the chest before turning to Harry.
(Draco believed in Wackspurts. Luna may be seen as 'loony' but she didn't care what anybody thought of her and was just herself. Many people probably believed in Wackspurts, dabberlimps, Nargles, etcetera. But they don't want to be judged. And Draco heavily respects her for not worrying over image.)
Later that day, everyone was in the living room by the fire. The boys’ plus Ginny were playing exploding snap- minus Draco who preferred to be cuddled in a corner reading. Once the girl got over her initial shock, she would blush every time Harry spoke in her direction or to her.
Draco had done many renovations since taking over Malfoy Manor- as a distraction, mainly. It was now a month since the war had ended and when he got back Draco closed off the East Wing forever and locked the dining room door with the strongest curses and wards, he could imagine. Then, he had to redesign the place like he wanted it.
"He's tortured me since school, and I want revenge. He's caused so much hassle and trouble to us all, I'll be alive to bask in all of his pain, until the day I slowly torture him to death." It took more convincing, telling The Dark Lord what he wanted to hear, but, eventually, Draco secured Harry Potter as his slave.
“Malfoy, Draco!" McGonagall called and Draco elegantly walked up the step to confidently sit on the seat. It definitely took a long time (pushing five minutes) until the hat called a house. "GRYFFINDOR!" He smiled brighter than Harry had ever seen. Out of everyone, Harry clapped and whooped the loudest, excitedly pointing to a free seat beside himself.
(Draco was sitting on the train reading a Shakespeare play when Terry bursted through the door "That's my favourite!" He exclaimed, then they became friends. Later on, Justin walked in with a hand buzzer shaking Terry's hand and they all laughed it off. Then they became friends.)
Taking a lot of blankets and two of the three duvets, Draco was doing stuff with them and Potter had no idea what. "Per-permission to sp-speak, Sir?" Oh, Draco
The entire trip, they got to know Draco and he got to know them. Although Draco already knew about the houses and what houses they were in (thanks to Sirius of course), he listened with rapped attention. "We'll hopefully see you in Gryffindor!" Exclaimed Hermione, already hugging Draco as the train pulled to a stop.
Ding dong! The doorbell went and before Harry could be hit over the head with a hand, he ran upstairs to his room and closed the door behind him- not looking up from the ground yet.
He tried, God he tried, so, so hard not to cry when Harry asked for that divorce. He willed his walls back into place, but they couldn't hold back a few tears going down his fragile face. Why wasn't he enough?
And they kissed. Fireworks literally went off in the background, and people began to charge outside to see them. But all Draco and Harry needed was the electricity that they suddenly felt when his lips were on his. Nothing had been better up till now.
When they were signed, Draco was the first to speak, "I expect all of your belongings to be out of my house by tonight, Potter." His voice was icy sharp, softening in sadness at his next statement, "I hope you can find someone who made you happier than I did."
Through out the encounter, Harry found out that the Malfoy’s were there to sell some dark artefacts for some strange reason. Hagrid found him, guiding him out of the dark, eerie area and to the bright and sunny place of Diagon Alley. Immediately, Draco hit him around the head then hugged him.
“You two looked comfortable during that chess match.” Fred pointed out, gesturing his fork in Harry and Draco’s direction, who were sitting beside each other.
Draco drowned the words out, instead letting his head nuzzle into the warmth of the Alpha’s belly, giving himself this single moment, this second of reprieve before he would have to push him away.
His mind strayed back to moments before, his thoughts drifting and collecting into a mirage that showed a face.
“Anytime, Draco, you know that. I just— I’m glad you finally let me drag you out of that house. Actually
Draco said with a shrug, annoyed with himself for volunteering more information then she had asked for… but something about the way she was so quick to put him at ease made him lower his guard a little.
Draco finally replied, sneaking another glance to the Beta. There was a ghost of a smile tugging up his lips now and he suddenly leaned closer to Draco, almost conspiratorially. Draco leaned forward a fraction too, holding his breath to escape the harsh proximity of Ron’s scent.
There was a whisper of something, a hushed murmur of words before the burning pain below started to dissipate, only leaving him with the oddest sensation of…
Harry smiled again, his eyes casting down to the Omega’s wand, his fingers brushing over the velvety wood.
He flinched when he felt Hermione’s hand gently cover his own, her thumb brushing over his knuckle in the way that always made him shiver.
Draco quickly huffed out the rest of his words, standing up in one swift motion before pushing his chair back in.
Draco finally snapped, before he breezed past her towards the hall. He paused for a beat, closing his eyes as he let out a slow breath.
It had started slowly at first, like the pitter-patter of a passing shower… only for it to grow and twist into a harrowing storm, tearing through his body in a way that left him all but empty. A carcass picked clean.
Draco nodded slowly, trying not to show just how much this was all killing him. One whole year… one whole year to live with a
I’ve been on a little holiday break so most of this was written on my phone, please forgive any mistakes, I don’t have Grammarly checking over things 😭
He just didn’t know what to make of it, didn’t know why the kid would even want to do what he was doing… maybe he was homesick? Maybe he was doing it for attention, or some kind of cry for help?
They all eventually seated themselves and dinner was served. Hermione and Ron both flicked glances at Draco throughout the evening to check in with him, but he had answered every one of them with a calm nod, before dropping his eyes back to his food.
The alpha swayed on the spot as another wave of dizzying pain ran straight up his spine, causing him to let out a strained burst of air.
Her eyes seemed to dawdle on his face, biting her lip as she reached forward and gently placed the back of her hand to his forehead.
“Oh, Merlin! I’m so sorry, dear, he’s usually not this friendly. Sit, Rubeus, sit! Good boy, there we go, good boy.”
She didn’t seem to believe him, her brow furrowing at the easy smile he was sending her way, but she chose not to push. They had been together for enough years now for her to know that if he wasn’t ready to share something… then it wasn’t much use trying to dig for it.
Thank you so much for reading and leaving comments and kudos! I’m honestly so honoured xxx you’re amazing ♥️♥️♥️
“I wasn’t in my right mind, obviously. I would never have touched you if it wasn’t for you dumping a shitload of pheromones into the air.”
Ron went to peer into the next room but Draco spoke again, his words making both Hermione and Ron frown.
Ron said, a strange edge to his voice. Draco frowned but shrugged his shoulders, turning with a quiet exhale and grabbing the plate mid-air to carry it to the sink. He heard a tired sigh from behind him and his body tensed.
There was some part of him, some tiny seed of doubt that had hoped it was all just a big misunderstanding… that Draco would tell him he was being a paranoid old geezer and to mind his own business.
Looking at the boy held captive under his weight now, it was hard to actually see the resemblance. The hair of course was a dead ringer to the smarmy Alpha from Harry’s memories… but that was where the familiarity ended.
“It was Hermione’s parent's farm, well, her grandfather’s originally. When he passed, it was given to her father and mother, but… due to, uh, certain events, it’s in Hermione’s hands now.”
He walked to the bed, grimacing once more at the small size of it, huffing out loud as he pulled the covers back and jumped in, the springs creaking under his weight. It smelled like them.
The toast popped then, and the alpha moved quickly to grab each steaming slice, throwing them on the plates before he magicked the butter to spread itself so that he could serve up the rest of the food.
“We’ll start on this section first and hopefully we can then get to the rest of the wall before it gets too late.”
Harry murmured, a husky note colouring his voice as he crawled back up Draco’s body until he was at his neck again, burying his face there like it belonged.
It was just so different from how things were at home. Usually, Draco would spend his morning exercising, then came his tutoring from 7 am to 5 pm, and after that, he would help his mother in the garden or work on his potions.
Hermione murmured, her hand coming back up to tuck a strand of loose hair behind his ear… which made Draco think of
Neither the witch nor the wizard seemed to practice this custom though… their scents freely permeating the room in a sickly swirl. Draco wasn’t used to it, the reek of it overpowering his delicate senses. It made his knees weak.
I’m getting back into it now though, yay, so I hope you enjoy this chapter! It’s a little boring if I’m being honest 🙈 but necessary for story progression (I think lol).
Ron said slowly, his fingers drumming against his glass. Draco looked down at the table, biting his lip as his mind reeled on what to say.
Harry let out a furious roar as his hands automatically released the Omega to rush to his nose, fingers already smearing a hot stream of blood across his lips.
The witch sighed, moving her hands to cross them over her chest as she held his eyes. Draco tried not to let the confusion show, his teeth sinking into the side of his cheek.
Draco coughed out, scratching at the imposing hand as the fingers tightened a little more. His eyes had adjusted finally in the looming darkness and he got his first proper look at the alpha on top of him.
Draco called over his shoulder, his steps only faltering when Harry started to follow him. The boy turned back with a huff, a rising irritation finally flickering past his gaze.
Ron shoved his way through to pull Hermione out of the man’s grip, but the Alpha was already dropping her hand, two narrowed green eyes staring down at Draco.
She couldn’t even dare to imagine what could happen if the boy was left in the hands of someone with bad intentions… all it would take was the wrong person to release enough pheromones and the boy would be at their mercy.
“This is probably going to be a big job… be a doll and prep the wall for me while I get us something to drink.”
”Not many people know it but honey-milk weed and dried acklelope petal can h-help with… with morning sickness.”
The Alpha murmured when he greeted him, the sugared words sounding so sour to Draco’s ears. When he had looked around to see if Hermione and Ron had sensed the same thing, he had instead been surprised to find their warm smiles directed at Harry.
Draco gave him a look, a strange flash of something crossing his features that Harry couldn’t catch, only for it to be replaced by a slow smile.
Draco hummed, still not entirely present, his brow creased a little from the thought still clinging to him.
of how old they are... yet continues to leave them under their guardians’ thumb until the tender age of twenty-five? I can’t yet vote but I can take a knot at thirteen, hurrah for politics!”
The man suddenly said, interrupting Hermione as he audibly sniffed the air. Draco paled, his legs suddenly wobbly as he took in those words.
He probably got his looks from his mother, then, Harry mused. He couldn’t really remember what the witch looked like after all these years, but he could take a guess.
Draco ran, not even picking a direction, his body just surging towards the dim light of the hallway.
“I apologise, Draco, what happened yesterday… it shouldn’t have happened at all. I had no intention of leaving you last night, but I got an urgent message and–“
Harry’s steps faltered as he inched forward, his eyes going wide when saw that Draco was seated in a small puddle on the floor, a dark patch where the boy’s trousers were damp…
He murmured, his voice strangely breathy as he went to move past them. Ron quickly placed a hand on his shoulder, stopping his retreat.
He glanced back at Harry, his eyes shining brightly as he did a little twirl, Harry’s eyes helplessly grazing over his form, catching the way the shorts ended just a little above the curve of his ass.
She finished, sighing into her hands when she saw her son blink away budding tears, ignoring her gaze as he scowled down at his feet.
As the two fell into a seamless system of pancake batter and bananas, there was a strange muttering of muffled voices drifting from the direction of the lounge room.
His mother’s high-pitched wail penetrated the stunned silence, making his back stiffen as he threw his head to where she stood by the door. Her wide eyes regarded him in shock, frozen in her stance as she looked to the mess on the floor.
It would only be a matter of time before he would be clutching his belly in pain again, wracked by vicious cramps that refused to subside no matter how much he cried.
He felt raw, exposed, the remnants of the dream refusing to drift from his mind, dragging him under.
Harry growled in his ear, the sound of it rumbling through his chest and vibrating through Draco’s skin.
“Everything’s fine, hon, I guess I just haven't kept up with my stock. I’ll pick up a few things after work. Do you need anything?”
Alpha’s were territorial, and it wasn’t so strange for one to quickly adopt a place they had stayed at briefly and become protective of it… but to be territorial over
Hermione grinned at that, stealing another piece of pasta and chuckling when he chased her hand away with his fork.
The witch seemed to relax at that, but the tension was still so thick in the air, stifling all four of them into an uncomfortable silence. Something sharp twisted in Draco’s gut, his head lowering as his cheeks heated in shame.
, when he was sitting on his haunches, his eyes in line with his tutors’ ugly cock, all he could do was gawk at it, his body trembling in a mixture of fear, revulsion… and
“Sliced is fine. You’re on banana duty, so when I pour the batter into the pan you’ve got to put a few pieces on top. Don’t skimp out on me though, we’re banana crazy in this house.”
, and something inside of Harry’s gut twisted viciously at the sight, his blood pumping hot and furiously through his lifeless form.
Hermione asked with a wry smile, her eyes watching Draco shove another large bite into his already stuffed mouth.
A cold chill settled at the base of Draco’s spine when he heard the sound of a zipper being yanked down, and he laid there frozen in fear when Harry pushed himself up on his feet and stood tall over him, pulling out his
Draco’s smile grew when Ron continued to list off ingredients, a strange flush travelling up his collar as he followed the older man into the house, with the weight of an arm resting comfortably across his shoulders...
He felt the thick head of his Alpha’s cock nudge at his entrance, and without more than a warning grunt, it was pushing inside of him, splitting him apart, simultaneously opening him and filling him up.
Harry replied, opening the overhead cupboard and pulling out two plates before he placed them down on the kitchen bench.
Draco suddenly said, biting his tongue when he saw Hermione frown at the shift in his mood. He tried to relax his shoulders, wondering when they had become so tense.
Lucius had been waiting to mate him with a pure-blooded Alpha of good stock, preferably one that would help reintegrate the Malfoy name back into society. If he found out that Draco had already been taken by another, forced or not, he would probably never let his son see the light of day again.
Harry asked with a sigh, clearly unimpressed. Draco rolled his eyes, popping everything down on the floor beside his feet before he glanced up at the wall with a raised eyebrow.
The Alpha’s nostrils flared as he ripped his eyes away from the sight, instead, focusing on the boy’s pale eyes, still narrowed at him, framed by a fanning of thick eyelashes that made the little brat look much too innocent for the contemptuous glare he was aiming at him.
Through his still open bedroom door, Draco heard the tell-tale signs of Ron arriving home, the somewhat muted chatter of Hermione becoming clearer as they moved from the loungeroom and into the kitchen.
Draco asked wearily, scrunching up his nose as he looked up at Ron suspiciously. The Beta laughed, ruffling the Omega’s hair again and earning another annoyed scowl.
They all ate in a happy yet strained silence and by the time Draco had scraped his plate clean his stomach was bursting.
“Hermione said you have an interest in potions, Draco? Well, I’ve been experimenting with Flobberworm mucous, but instead of using it as a thickener as you would in potions, I’ve found that it adds this really great buttery flavour to my pie pastry.”
The sound only melded with the noise of the party downstairs, the mind-numbing boom of the music vibrating the old walls, a cacophony of incessant chatter and chortles echoing under his feet.
Draco gave him a once over, eyes scanning unabashed down Harry’s form before he finally met his gaze again.
It was interesting, really, to see the way her unguarded scent changed with her mood, uniquely new and strangely familiar. Another thing he would just have to get used to.
She whispered with a wink before she finally stepped back from him, smoothing down her shirt as she sighed.
Draco spat, the first real sign of genuine anger settling in those silver eyes. Harry held him for a moment longer before he scowled and let him go, moving over to a small wooden table tucked in the corner of the room before he pulled out a chair.
Draco moaned at the sharp sting spreading over his scalp, but all it did was add another song to the chorus of pain wrapping itself around his body.
Ron said, the smile on his face not reaching his eyes. Draco didn’t seem to notice, just smiled back and got to work mashing the potatoes by hand. He didn’t even complain anymore about having to do certain things the ‘muggle way’, he just went a did it without a second thought.
Draco gasped out, scrambling away when Harry finally released him. Draco crawled forward before collapsing, sobbing into the ground as he clutched at his stomach and gagged. Nothing came out, and the nausea that clawed at his stomach refused to fade.
When he was finally in control of his breathing again he looked back up at Ron, who nodded at him encouragingly to continue.
Lucius had been able to go to school, to interact with a wide range of students with their own unique pheromones and scents— he hadn’t been locked away like some
Just as he had stumbled into the lounge-room, a large hand grasped the back of his sequinned shirt and yanked him back, tearing the expensive material as he was flung hard onto his ass.
“Eat your damn breakfast. After this, we are both going to go through this house and clean it up. You’re living in a bloody pigsty!”
Hermione’s voice drifted through the door. Draco quickly looked around the room, that same unease clutching at his heart at the idea of Hermione coming inside
It didn’t end up taking him long at all to drift off to sleep, a sudden tiredness swarming over his body and propelling him into a restless slumber.
Harry growled, hanging his head for a brief second before he breathed in harshly, another threatening rumble rising up through his chest. Draco stilled, his instincts screaming at him to submit when he was suddenly hit with a wave of angry alpha pheromones.
Three words whimpered over and over again, the Omega’s body trembling viciously against him, all of his previous fight long forgotten.
It was his eyes though that caught his breath. Two large orbs, the colour of an ocean storm, framed by long pale lashes that should have given him more than a whisper of innocence… and yet, left him with anything
“I have everything I need for that. I’m teaching him advanced potion making, I wouldn’t have the need for anything of yours— even so, I haven't done anything practical with him whilst he’s been on bed rest. Is something wrong, Ron? Why are you so worried?”
After a moment the light started to shimmer and before Draco could reach out and touch it, it finally disappeared beneath his skin.
The boy asked absently, dropping an elbow on the table and leaning into it with a casual nonchalance, causing his sweater to slip down past his left shoulder, exposing his bare skin.
Draco finally asked, biting his lip as Ron frowned and moved past him, slowly making his way from the kitchen and into the dining room. Draco followed closely behind, trying to peak past Ron’s larger body and failing miserably.
Harry smirked, emerald eyes dancing mischievously when Draco audibly gasped at those words, the Omega jerking further back on his bed as he pulled the sheet higher over his lithe body.
“Listen here, kid, I understand you’re upset, but I will not have you treating me with disrespect. I am your mentor–
