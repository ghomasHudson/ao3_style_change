Harry shrugged and grinned. "Well, if I were Minister I would be doing some thorough investigating." He sobered. "Seriously though, Kingsley. This shit is serious. We can't have someone in the Ministry collecting financial information on free citizens. It's illegal and dangerous. If you don't fix this, I will."
"I want a strawberry sundae with chocolate sauce and sprinkles!" Lily declared cheerily, her excitement actually genuine. It was ice cream after all, no kid could resist that.
To James and Albus it hadn't seemed like they'd been a real family for a long time. Their mum had always been locked in her room or distant and distracted when their dad wasn't there. And he hadn’t really been there a lot since he’d gotten that new position at the Ministry. He’d always been away on a business trip or working late. It hadn't felt like they'd had two parents since Lily was little.
Almost immediately the little boy began babbling at him in an odd mix of imperfect French and childishly pronounced english. Much to Harry's amazement and amusement, Draco seemed to follow every single word coming out of Louis's mouth, answering promptly and appropriately in fluent french.
James raised a questioning eyebrow in a perfect imitation of Draco and Mr. Malfoy. Teddy couldn't help it. He giggled at the sight of it, but calmed when James spoke.
They lurched to another gut clinching stop. Harry wasted no time in scrambling out of the cart and forcing his legs to steady. He looked up at another massive vault door that was numbered 212.
"Oh! Rosie!" Hermione exclaimed when her daughter slurped up a noodle so loudly that it echoed. It whipped sauce all the way from one of Rose’s ears to the other. Harry lost the battle and burst out laughing.
He'd been surprised when Potter had answered the door those nights ago when he was returning Albus. The man had matured handsomely. His raven black hair was still wild and his eyes were still unnaturally bright green, but somewhere along the way he'd gotten rid of those monstrous glasses and put on some much needed height and muscle. Of course, Draco had never seen an out-of-shape Auror and that had been Potter's main job for the past eight years.
Harry leaned back in his seat and took a few beep breaths until his distress wasn’t making his magic crackle inside him anymore. It took a few moments.
Lucius Malfoy, for instance, wasn't just going to leave Draco and Scorpius with more gold than Midas. He was leaving them with real-estate, shares in profitable businesses, the means to support themselves with rental property and royalties and God knows what else.
Down the hall, Lucius wrapped his arms around his wife as she rolled toward him in the dark and snuggled against his chest.
James looked back up at the ceiling. He hadn't considered that if Harry and Draco do actually get married then it would be like having two parents again. He didn't know if you could have two dads, but since Draco could have babies maybe it would work.
"Yes, dear, and when Draco had an appalling fit of hysterics and objected to that decision by spending the night in the horse's stall in protest, you decided to let the poor thing live," Narcissa said as she stepped up to them with a serene smile on her perfectly painted mouth. "He is a beautiful animal, though."
"You know, Potter. I don't think I've had this much fun in a terribly long time," Draco declared, pressing a kiss to Harry’s chest near where his cheek rested.
"Alright." Teddy nodded in approval, once again acting as the unofficial leader of the Potter children. "Let's do it."
"I suppose she would be," Harry said, glancing at Lucius from the corner of his eye. "She was in Ravenclaw at Hogwarts."
It took him only a moment to find the en-suite master bathroom after he pulled himself from the surprisingly comfortable bed. The bathroom was traditional, but not outdated. The tile was timeless and the hardware a burnished copper that matched the cabinetry with its cherry colored wood. It was simple, but tasteful. Draco found himself impressed.
"This, Mr. Potter, is not a Quick Quotes Quill." Lucius punctuated every Q with sneer. "It is a Legitimus Quill, spelled specifically for legal documents. A document written and signed with a Legitimus Quill cannot be disputed or refuted."
Scorpius had followed Mrs. Weasley through the yard until she stopped in front of another man with flaming red hair. His grandfather had warned him about all the red hair when his dad had told them all that they were going to have dinner with Harry’s family, but Scorpius hadn’t really believed him.
Harry stood from his seat and pulled Teddy into a tight hug. "That's wonderful," Harry said mussing up Teddy's bright blue hair. "Read the rest. Let's see what the damage on school supplies will be."
"Yes, well." Lucius cleared his throat and quickly slipped the magazine from the folds of his paper and handed it to a giggling Albus. "I was finished with it anyway."
At least Harry had the presence of mind to put it somewhere out of sight. The last thing he needed was to be asked a bunch of questions that their children didn't need the answers to just quite yet.
"I haven't been around all that much since the Aurors starting sending me on foreign assignments and the Minister started using me as an Ambassador," Harry began to explain. "It took me away for weeks at a time, sometimes for a month all together, and when I was actually home," he trailed off with a shrug. "I didn't realize things had gotten so bad here until I came home a week ago to find that the house was abandoned, the kids had been staying at the Weasleys', and Ginny hadn't been heard from for three weeks."
"Okay, munchkins." Harry smiled down at them all. "Now, Eddy and Chrissy, you both know that I'm wizard and can do magic, right?"
He held his breath waiting for their situation to really hit Draco and the inevitable fallout that would follow.
"Well, come along, ducklings," Draco called as he sauntered to the doorway, Lily following close behind in an inadvertent imitation of an actually duckling. "Breakfast is on the table and we don’t want it to get cold."
“How Lily would always take whatever jewelry Ginny was wearing at the time and try to stuff it into her mouth and Albus was forever stealing my glasses to try and wear them. I remember it like it was yesterday.” A sad look flashed over Harry’s face. “They’re all growing up though. Growing up too fast.”
"When were you going to tell me, Harry?" Andromeda demanded angrily, turning the argument back around again. "When were you going to tell me that you exposed Teddy to the last of my horrid family? He is my grandson and you had no right!” she snapped, voice rising with every word.
Harry hugged Luna goodbye outside of Greene Thumbe after she and Lucius exchanged amiable handshakes. The two men watched her skip away down the Alley with a smile and wave tossed back at them before she disappeared into the crowd.
"But what if they don't? Then Albus and James and Teddy and Lily won't like me anymore either," Scorpius's voice cracked, pitched high in his worry.
"A marvelous idea, Weasley," Lucius agreed, eager to keep both of their wives from going off on a tangent about their unpleasant mother-in-laws. "Come along, dear. Let's show Molly and Arthur where the escargot is."
In the stall was a large dark horse. He stood a head taller than Lucius and his pitch-black coat shined from immaculate grooming. There was a jagged stripe of white that ran from the top of the horse’s head, down his neck, across his shoulders, and down his left front leg staining a stark white stripe through his mane along the way. It made him look like he’d been struck by lightning.
"Harry's cousin, isn't he a muggle?" she asked, turning her gaze back out to the garden where, Lucius was directing one of the only house-elves not required for medic duty to add yet more wards around the Rapier Roses, Poison Poppies, and a few others.
He nodded in acknowledgement, grateful for his wife’s sake at least, that Andromeda was going to withhold judgment on his business dealings with Potter until she had the full story. Very Slytherin of her. It showed that she was still very much a Black.
"God, Draco, I was this close to pulling my wand on her." Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair, not nearly as entertained as the rest of them. "If she is like that all the time I don't think I want my kids near her."
They both sucked in gasps of breath as the power washed over them. Harry could feel the blood in his veins begin to sizzle as the stone atop the staff glowed blindingly bright.
Teddy, James, Albus, and Lily clustered together in a group as they followed Harry away from the Alley floos and into the Alley proper. They tried to look innocent every time their father glanced back at them over his shoulder, but they didn't quite accomplish it, much to Harry's increasing unease.
The day passed by quickly. Harry and Molly peeled potatoes until their hands were covered in dirt and they had a pile of peels that was nearly as tall as Lily. Soon it was time for dinner and the children ate enough mashed potatoes to feed an army. Harry ate his fair share and chatted with Molly more about the plans for Teddy's birthday party. He tried to ignore the persistent pang he felt every time he thought about having to send the little boy off to Hogwarts in September.
Harry chuckled at that and set her back on Lily's shoulders. "She's a tad sassy, but if you like her, Lily, you can have her."
Now James's snake, Mischief, as his son had dubbed her, was going to cause him some grief he could tell. She had a sweet nature and seemed very taken with James, and he with her. But she had a mischievous streak a mile wide and Harry shuddered to think what kind of trouble they'd get themselves into.
Everyone smiled and laughed and they started to sing "Happy Birthday" in all different pitches and times and tones, but it still sounded nice and Teddy still laughed brightly as Hagrid hit a low bass note that made the ground vibrate beneath their feet.
Harry heart jumped in his chest when Albus turned to him and said, "It's not that hard. I could probably teach you." Oh God! Oh God! Draco Malfoy knew his kids were Parselmouths!
“Yeah. Hagrid has always been really good to me.” Harry smiled down at his lover from the corner of his eye and wrapped an arm around his shoulders. “So, eleven is important, then.”
Draco seemed to think about that for a moment. "I would have figured, between them, that Granger would have been the more reasonable of the two," he frowned questionably.
Lucius looked back at her and hesitated for a moment before answering. “Potter has requested that I become his financial advisor and help him make some investments to increase his estate.”
Harry was distracted from the scene by a hesitant tugging at the hem of his shirt. Glancing down he saw Scorpius with a hand curled in the cloth, cheeks flushed with shyness.
They traveled the rest of the way to Gringotts in silence, both men watching the stunned crowds around them cautiously. Harry's hand hovered over his wand in his holster and Lucius's grip tightened on his snakehead cane.
It had been an hour since then and in another fifteen minutes Luna would be late for their meeting. Harry was currently seated in the formal sitting room sipping fitfully at his tea while Lucius tapped his cane on the marble floor and drummed his fingers on the arm of his chair impatiently.
Sitting up with him, Draco flicked his bright pink straw back and forth distractedly. "Sorry I snapped, Harry. I was just surprised. I mean, they started that back before fifth year. Where on earth did you get the money?"
"Good lord," Draco muttered, cradling the back of Harry's head, he began to nip and kiss along his jaw and neck once more. "No wonder you didn’t stay that sullen about the Weaselette leaving you. Really, five years without sex?"
"Oh, tosh," Narcissa chuckled. "He's very lovely now. At least as long as Draco is the only one riding him," she finished with a smirk.
Scorpius and Albus grinned covertly at each other and James and Teddy smirked at a silently giggling Lily.
Harry did the same, turning to the doorway just as Luna skipped in, dreamy eyes scanning the decore with interest, her necklace of butterbeer corks and radish earrings firmly in place. They didn't really look out of place when paired with her sunshine yellow robes printed with large daisies.
He just shrugged and smiled bashfully. "They’re determined to have themselves a pet snake." Maybe if he played it off as childish fancy she'd loosen up and just show them the bloody reptiles already. "You do carry snakes, don't you?"
"We could live off the interest naturally so what Father earned from sitting on the Board of Governors and his seat at the Ministry went into business and property investments. Before, the only Malfoy properties were this Manor and a moderately sized chateau in the south of France. Now the properties include the building my shop is in, several wizarding housing complexes in the Wizards’ Quarter of London, a muggle town house in London, an estate in Ireland somewhere and several others on the continent. I think there’s one in Brazil, but don't quote me on that." Draco finished nonchalantly.
He grinned at her and they both returned to their snapping, but Molly continued watching him from out of the corner of her eye. It was because of this that she observed when his easy expression melted into one troubled and melancholy.
Albus weaved in and out of shoppers as he ran as far away from his father as he could. Angry tears streamed down his face, but he kept going until he bounced off of a portly wizard and tumbled to the ground.
Albus tisked in irritation and shook his head. "Not that part, stupid. I meant the part about how one of the guys I'm named after killed the other guy I'm named after."
Scorpius first crinkled his nose at the ruffling, a move strangely reminiscent to a younger snottier Draco, then smiled up at the man in front of him. "Hello, Mr. George."
His best friend was still staring at Draco with an unsmiling expression he couldn't quite place. He traded bemused looks with Ron before turning back to his conversation with Arthur.
Kingsley only stared at him for a moment, an unreadable look on his face before he leaned forward, angry tension pinching at his temples. "I apologize, Mr. Malfoy. It would seem that there is someone in Ministry employ that has taken it upon themselves to make illegal demands of our free citizens. There has been a full inquiry issued and all of your documents will be returned to you as soon as our investigation has been conducted."
Draco looked positively stunned. "Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets? He's the heir of Slytherin?"
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see James, Albus, and Lily all tense. "Not quite yet," he replied. "It's not like I need the job, and I'm not really all that pressed for something to do. My four little hellions keep me pretty well occupied."
Harry felt himself melt in relief now that it didn’t seem like he’d have to dodge an explosion of Draconic proportions.
Harry had no time to take exception to being ordered around in his own home. He could only blink bemusedly at Malfoy as he steam rolled through his home like a freight train.
"Well," the little girl began nervously. "Me and Belle were talking the other night and she said that if Daddy and Draco fell in love then they would -um- mate and Draco would be our mum and Scorpius would be our brother."
Teddy could tell that Ginny hadn’t really acted like normal for a while and that’s why she’d left. His grandma didn't think he knew, but kids are more perceptive than adults give them credit for and it wasn’t all that hard to figure out.
And Scorpius was the best. Teddy wanted him for a brother like he wanted James and Albus and even Lily.
The rest of the evening went almost perfectly after that. The kids played themselves into the ground and the adults drank tea and wine and firewhiskey until everyone was feeling quite cheerful.
"I bumped into someone and fell," Albus mumbled shyly. Scorpius's dad seemed really nice, but he was also intimidating. He looked elegant and put together. He studied the blond man's fancy robes, his eyes tracing the embroidery on the cuffs.
Draco grinned, happy for the distraction. "I know, isn't it? I had it remodeled after I kicked Astoria out. She had it fucking pink, for God's sake." He scrunched his nose in remembered distaste and climbed under the covers.
"So, Lucius and Draco were Death Eaters. That part's true at least, and now we know what they did during the war, but why does Dad trust them?" James asked.
And they really liked Draco. He was nice and funny and played with them. He didn't even mind helping when they asked. Since he’d become Dad’s friend Dad had spent every moment he could with them. He was happier and better at the whole being a dad thing, never making them make their own lunches or do all the chores around the house. He even smiled like he really was happy.
When the children each sat in a chair by themselves they all very studiously did not look at him, preferring instead to stare at their own feet or the ornate Persian rug.
Scorpius's eyes grew wide and he started shaking his head pleadingly at his grandfather. Draco on the other hand just raised a disapproving eyebrow at him.
This is one of the inscriptions that traditionally is rumored to be etched into the blade of Excalibur. Alfred, Lord Tennyson described the hilt of Excalibur to be like this in his poem, "Mort d'Arthur".
"Okay," Scorpius whispered. "Teddy, James, watch the door. If Grandpa comes back or a house-elf sees us we're all dead." The two oldest boys nodded with grim faces and turned to the door cracking it open so they could see down the hall in both direction.
Almost from the moment Scorpius had set eyes on him, he'd wanted to be friends with Albus so badly. It made him so happy now that they were friends it felt like he could burst sometimes. And James and Lily were so cool too.
After Ron and Hermione had flooed home carrying two exhausted and tomato stained children, Harry spent the rest of the evening scrubbing his own little heathens clean and putting them to bed.
"Nope, but I got the ability to speak Parseltongue from Voldemort when he tried to kill me as a baby," Harry explained wishing he hadn't started this conversation after all. "Parselmouths are born. It's not something you can just learn. I retained the ability after I killed Voldemort and then consequently passed it on to my kids." He shrugged awkwardly.
It was hot, so hot, and wonderful. Draco had never experienced anything like it. He could feel his need pounding and aching between his legs, like he could feel Harry's, hot and damp against his belly, sliding against his own. It forced a whine out of his flushed and bruised lips.
"I won't ever leave you," Harry vowed burying his own face in James's auburn hair. "I could never do that to you guys, never."
James set off after the blond boy. "I'll show you reach!" he shouted as Scorpius let out a frightened yelp and dashed off through the undergrowth.
Slowly, Draco lifted a hand and wrapped it around one of hers, squeezing it comfortingly and receiving a near bone breaking squeeze in return. "It's not your fault, Hermione. It's just one of those things that happen with no rhyme or reason that we just have to live with. It's heartbreaking and will stay with you forever, but it's not the end of the world and if you keep dwelling on it, keep blaming yourself, it will tear you apart. It will tear your family apart."
He stepped around and took a seat next to her. Looking over at her he saw her hunched over with her knees to her chest and arms wrapped so tightly around them her knuckles were white.
"Where's Hermione at?" Harry asked as he reached over to pluck a slice of cucumber off the top of the salad bowl sitting on the counter.
"Here we are, Mr. Potter." The little goblin stepped out of the cart and gestured to the massive vault door. "Vault number one hundred and forty-five."
Narcissa grinned at him and stretched up to kiss his equally grinning mouth. "Hush you. You seem to handle my enthusiasm just fine." She stroked her hand down his belly to grip his cock and give it an appreciative squeeze.
Harry chuckled at the sight of all the children with icing on their faces and clothes and didn't envy George and Angelina the job of cleaning their kids up as little Fred and Roxanne started to shove cake in each other's faces and on each other's clothes.
"So, what did you want to talk about Chrissy for?" Harry asked bringing the conversation back around.
None of the kids replied. The three Potter children just trudged quietly up the stairs without so much as glance at their father.
Harry thought about how to answer her. He knew he should talk about it with someone and he knew that he could trust Molly to be honest. She’d also never had a problem setting him to rights if he was being stupid. The only thing he worried about when confiding in Molly was how she would react to the mention of Draco Malfoy. She wasn’t exactly known for her mild reactions to shock.
It seemed to go on forever, but was over much too soon. Harry could feel the pressure building and reached down with one shaking hand to grasp Draco's member tightly and pump him until he came with an echoing shout coating their bellies in hot fluid. That tore at Harry's last thread of control and he gave one more hard thrust before emptying himself deep inside Draco's burning hot body.
"Please?" she begged as she clasped her hands in front of her chest and leaned around James to gaze up at her father.
And of course they had to have the five smartest most inquisitive children known to man. He snorted at himself as he started up the shower and hopped in when it hit the perfect temperature.
Andromeda Black Tonks had aged, that much was obvious. Unlike some women, she had aged gracefully, but certainly different from how Narcissa had aged. She had laugh lines around her cupid’s bow mouth and smile wrinkles at her eyes. Her thick wavy dark hair was streaked with gray and she'd grown rounder around the hips and bust lending her a softness that Narcissa didn’t have with her near perpetually perfect figure.
"I am not as weighted by prejudice as my late husband,-" Narcissa hid a snort behind her tea cup, "but it surprises me that you would allow a half-blood blood-traitor to
"Oh, only if you're trying to ride him." She waved at him dismissively. "He's really quite sweet if you just want to pet him." Leaning over the gate in her elegant robes, she made some kissing noises with her deep red lips to get the horse's attention.
Groaning, Harry laid his head on the table with a heavy thunk. God, he was not looking forward to how the other Weasleys were going to take this.
"It-it's some healing salves that I brew for my shop and some packages of tea cookies," he mumbled, stunned as Molly stared down at the intricately painted box in awe.
. Of course the fact that he now had a rather large snake sitting in his lap reading his paper nearly made him jump out of his skin.
"After the Tournament I tried to give the money to Cedric's parents. They didn't want it. I didn't want it or need it. My parents had left me more money than I could ever hope to use." There was sadness behind his eyes as he gave Draco a forced grin. Draco for his part just met his gaze, listening solemnly.
"I apologize for my rudeness. Welcome to our home." She stepped forward and grasped Molly's hands in a polite greeting. "I trust that your floo trip was satisfactory."
"Call the snake back and get ready for breakfast," Lucius instructed, not feeling the need to allay the children’s fear of punishment. He'd said he wouldn’t tell their fathers, but he'd never said he wouldn't punish them in their stead and Scorpius knew the distinction.
Harry gave them both a stiff formal nod. "Good morning Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy. Thank you for allowing my children and I to join you."
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed as list of all necessary books and equipment.
Harry glanced back toward the other children and found all three of them enthralled by the stable manager's spur of the moment equine lesson. The man was crouched down one of the mare's front legs lifted as he showed them her hoof. Scorpius, Albus, and Lily were listening avidly, fascinated.
Harry wondered if Draco realized that he was projected his childhood self. His tone was mocking and he had a familiar sneer on his face. His handsome face had turned pointy around the edges as he smirked maliciously. It disturbed Harry, but the kids were eating it up, just another aspect of Draco's story telling.
The lift dinged and that female voice intoned, "Department of Feminist Issues and Lobbying," in a much chirpier tone than he remembered from the last time he'd been in the Ministry.
"Draco and Scorpius's mother did not separate amicably. I believe that despite your past animosity he sees a kindred spirit in you," Lucius said. "Of course it helps that he is quite taken with your children. He and Scorpius both were almost gushing when they came home the other night," he finished dryly.
His oldest son awkwardly toed his sneaker at the expensive Persian rug. Harry watched silently unsure what to say. After a long moment of silence, James lifted his head.
Belle hurriedly slithered back into the backroom and curled her way up to Lily's shoulders hissing the whole way. Lily, James, and Albus listened raptly as Teddy and Scorpius bounced on the balls of their feet anxiously waiting for a translation.
"Now," he bowed his head a fraction, the barest of propriety, "If you will excuse me. My guests and I have other plans for the remainder of the morning."
"First things first,” Lucius began all business now. “I shall owl Mr. Weasley and request a financial report from him. A list of any current improvements he wishes to make to the company, expansions, additions to the merchandise, research and development, etc. I suggest that you owl him when you leave here and warn him of my missive. I do not think he will not take kindly to being surprised."
Draco looked around as well then shrugged. "This is the North wing, where the ballroom, dinning rooms, sitting rooms, and kitchen are located. It's by far the largest of the four wings," he explained nonchalantly.
Ron started coughing and sputtering again. Hermione just sighed and stood from her seat. "I think I'd better get everyone home before Ron drowns in his tea."
Reflexively taking a tall, sweating glass, Andromeda sipped at it lightly before setting it back down again. She didn’t know quite what to do with her hands. “Harry told me that his children and your grandson have become friends.”
Draco and Narcissa continued on into the house and asked a few of the quieter, more discreet elves to begin a search. It wasn't long until they found her.
He shrugged. "There's only one thing Father loves more than pureblood tradition and that's money. You give him some of your money and he'll twist it and stretch it ’til the goblins are crying mercy and digging out new vaults."
Deciding to ignore his disdainful tone, Narcissa slipped her arm in his and conceded, "Perhaps not, my love, but they are pure-bloods and as such must appreciate the observation of our older traditions."
Humming absently Lucius continued to scan his eyes over the crowd. "You do realize that the Granger girl has been periodically glaring at you all evening."
Harry came to awareness slowly. It started with the sound of peacocks calling outside, then it shifted to a feeling of warmth and contentment, and it ended with his eyes peeking open to the gray light of early morning filtering through Draco's windows.
“Ah.” Now, Draco could see what the nervous fidgeting were about. “Has she not talked to you, then?”
Harry’s face fell a little bit more, a sudden feeling of inadequacy coming over him. Did all Malfoy men have a special talent for making him feel completely stupid?
"Mm. Good morning." Draco grinned and pulled away to peek over his shoulder at the breakfast sizzling on the stove. "What are you cooking?"
"We should help get them together," Scorpius explained looking from one of his friends to the other. "Dad and Harry are happy together, right? And I like Harry and you guys like my dad. I want to be in a family with you all. I think it would be awesome."
"Welcome to the Magical Menagerie. Is there something I can help you find?" she asked turning her smile down toward the kids.
As if compelled, Lucius quickly stood from his seat and strode toward her. "Mother," he greeted formally, taking the hand she offered him and kissing the back lightly before he leaned down an inch and kissed her presented cheek. "I was unaware that you had changed your travel plans."
"Come on, Harry!" Teddy interrupted yanking the door open and stepping inside. He was followed closely by the other children leaving Harry with no choice, but to follow as well.
"Dad!" Scorpius yelled when they reached the counter at the back of the store tugging Albus along behind it. "Dad!"
"I can't believe it's actually working," Teddy confessed bouncing from foot to foot as he leaned over Lily to watch his snake down the hall.
Shaking his head, Draco resigned himself to waiting until Potter showed up or closing time when he could take the boy home himself.
Harry wondered if Albus knew he had a string of spaghetti in his hair. He sure wasn't going to tell him if he didn't.
Snorting in amusement, Kingsley replied, "I wouldn't have ever found out about it if Harry hadn't come storming into my office demanding to know what was going on. It reflects badly on the Ministry and is a disservice to the citizen when things like this happen. Once again, I apologize."
The kids cheered, shooting each other triumphant looks and meaningful grins as they trooped behind the counter to disappear from sight.
Just before he disappeared from view Draco paused. Looking back he addressed the two somewhat stunned men still standing in his floo room. "Weasley, Harry. Father is waiting for you in his study."
Oh, that's right. Hermione mentioned them, years ago, when Ginny was pregnant with James. She asked if there were any matris in their families. That's right. Matris were wizards born with the capability to bear children...oh...
“What do you think could have persuaded her?” Lucius asked glancing at her over his shoulder only to pause as he caught her eyes on him in the mirror. A smirk curled at his lips and he slowed his movements, much to his wife’s satisfaction.
A sobbing, painful chuckle escaped her throat. “It’s not just our marriage, Harry. It’s everything.”
"We have discovered that Harry's children are extremely easy to grow attached to," she replied lightly.
Lucius puffed up angrily. "What do you mean it can't be fixed?” he snarled. Really, there was nothing that could try his patience as much as a house-elf; any house-elf. “What do we have you for if you don’t do your damn job, you useless little- "
Nearly all of the Weasleys were milling around their gardens now, the children chasing each other through the garden and bouncing off the wards. Lucius looked downright overwhelmed by the sheer amount of red hair around him and Narcissa was getting along famously with Molly and Fleur. Which was either a good indication of future family gatherings or a sign of the apocalypse. Could go either way.
"This is beautiful," Harry whispered as his gloved fingers ran over the diamonds, feeling their facets and faces.
It was pleasant, Harry thought with a small smile as he twirled a forkful of spaghetti. Hermione had cooked her mother’s recipe and the kids were busy making tomato sauced messes of themselves giggling insanely the whole time.
Lucius collected his thoughts quickly and went on. "However, you are not really interested in why she might dislike me, you want to know why she would dislike her family." He looked at Teddy pointedly.
"Lily-flower, you have leaves in your hair." Draco leaned over to gently pluck the greenery from her fiery auburn hair before combing his fingers through it, smoothing the messy waves.
"Did all of you inherit your father's messy hair?" He sighed in playful exasperation when he realized that no matter how many times he tried, the part in her hair was still going to be a crooked zigzag.
Scorpius cringed at that and looked away. "Yeah, I know more than you know," he admitted, not sounding particularly happy about it.
Narcissa stopped all movement and stared at the elf as if she’d grown a pair of socks from the top of her head. “Andromeda,” she repeated, not really sure if she'd heard right. “Andromeda Tonks is here to see me.”
Harry clapped him on the shoulder and grinned at him. "No problem, Big D. The kids will be happy they'll be going to Hogwarts as well."
"Yes." Draco nodded, swallowing a sip of tea. "All twenty of the Weasleys, Granger's parents, Hagrid, McGonagall, Aberforth Dumbledore, Lovegood and her father, Longbottom, Aunt Andromeda, the Minister and his wife, and Harry's cousin and his family." He squinted at the middle distance adding up the list in his head. "A total of thirty-five guests, if I've done my math correctly. Not including us or Harry and the kids."
Her eyes flicked down his reflection pausing at his burgeoning arousal before she looked back up to his confident, unrepentant expression. Turning around sharply she rose from her seat with an innate grace and walked slowly toward her naked husband.
"This should only take a minute to start working. You'll need to hold your hands still ’til your scrapes mend themselves then we can wipe you off and you're done," Draco explained as he covered the other hand with practiced motions.
Just as they were about to clasp hands Scorpius glanced down and gasped. "You're bleeding! Come on, we gotta get my dad to fix it."
." Cassiopeia waved a hand in a very French gesture and picked up another cookie to nibble on. "Draco's attachment to Harry Potter is a serious one, then? Considering he invited such people like the Weasleys into our home, I would have to assume that it is so."
"Good afternoon, Molly, Arthur." He smiled letting Mrs. Weasley hug him and shaking Mr. Weasley's hand. "I'm sorry my parents weren't able to be here to greet you, but Mother went a little overboard earlier this afternoon and Father was forced to intervene for everyone's sanity." Draco chuckled at the memory. "They should be down in just a few minutes, though."
"Shit." James huffed out a heavy breath. Lily didn't even scold him for cursing, she just stared blankly at the book pages and nodded.
But now she was having breakfast with them. Narcissa was fawning over Rose and giggling with her about girly things, Lucius wasn't cruel or cold or even indifferent, and Draco was cutting up Hugo's pancakes for him.
They trudged onto the lifts silently. The whispers and murmurs of busybody observers followed them like shadows. Five year-old Lily hung onto her father's hand tightly while seven year-old Albus and nine year-old James followed behind.
Nodding, Draco ushered the boy toward his mother as the floo flared again. A large, burly man tumbled through carrying a wide-eyed starfished little girl in his arms.
"It's alright, mate." Ron waved him off and took a large gulp of his drink that went down square. "I'm just a little surprised and pissed that you're just now telling me all this."
After they had visited the Manor, which had undergone some major redecorating, their burden felt like it had lightened. The children no longer had black clouds of depression hanging over them and Harry was starting to see the sun peeking through the clouds.
"I love you," he whispered to her in the dark, barely audible. She began to cry in earnest after that, but it felt cleansing. She felt cleansed as she clung to his hand in the night and cried out the last of her grief.
If Draco remembered correctly, the kitchen should be down here... Ah! There it is. He pulled Potter down the steps and shoved him into a kitchen chair. Turning toward the cooking area he stared incomprehensibly at the grease splattered cabinets, the food crusted stove, and the dishes fermenting in brown soapy water in the sink. He didn’t even brother attempting to touch anything he just shouted for a Malfoy house-elf.
Cool gray eyes regarded him before Lucius turned his head away and stepped onto the street heading towards Gringotts. "She was with you in the Department of Mysteries," Lucius remembered blandly, as if talking of the weather. "She was braver even than a few of my own Death Eaters that night."
Thankfully, the trip back down was quick and uneventful. After bypassing it to return Stella to her tank, James slipped back into Teddy’s room with Artemis still perched on his shoulder.
"What's that, Harry?" Teddy asked as he neared, his ambers eyes riveted on the covered cage in his godfather's hands.
A chuckle broke out of him, relieved that Draco’s lighthearted attitude kept him from overthinking their situation. Harry nodded in agreement and they started shuffling everyone off to their temporary sleeping arrangements.
Lucius’s study was all dark woods and built-in bookshelves filled with volumes upon volumes of legal and business oriented texts probably with a few not so legal ones mixed in. Harry wasn't looking close enough to confirm that, though. One wall of the room was filled with great bay windows that showed a rather spectacular view of the pond and the lush gardens surrounding the Manor. Harry could even see a few white peacocks pecking around in the grass.
That was a bit of an embellishment, but Harry did have to admit that it made for a more exciting story.
The sound of the boys’ happy laughter floated on the breeze, his ears easily picking out Scorpius’s from the rest.
"My mother would do just the same thing, I suppose,” Draco said, commiserating. Then he hit Harry with a knowing look. “So, you're bringing all this up because you want me and Scorpius to suffer a night at the Burrow?"
“I was somewhat surprised to see Andromeda having tea with you,” Lucius commented deceptively lightly as he unbuttoned his shirt and shrugged it off his shoulders.
It was a troubling thought, because Draco wanted Harry's adoptive family to like him. He wanted them to be happy for Harry and accept him and Scorpius as a part of his and his children’s life for the foreseeable future.
"Do you remember me telling you, Draco, that your Aunt Bellatrix and I had a sister that was disowned?" Her gaze went far away for a moment before she turned back to Draco.
It burned in the best kind of way imaginable. He hadn't felt this kind of pleasure for nearly eight years and even then it wasn't this wonderfully torturous.
Harry made a note to speak to Kingsley about this. He couldn't imagine him sanctioning something like this.
Harry flooed over to the Manor with the kids on the day of his and Lucius's meeting with Luna feeling all kinds of trepidation. He explained to Lucius that Luna wanted to meet them there at the Manor and received a withering glare and a sneer for his trouble.
Soon, he and Lucius were both seated in a rickety cart zooming through the tunnels at stomach turning speeds.
Harry stepped up to one of the goblins at the front desk and placed two keys on the marble counter. "I would like access to these two vaults," he requested politely.
Draco turned to face him as well and smiled at him in the dim lighting. "No problem, Harry. You're all welcome to stay anytime you want. Besides," he shrugged, his lips still curled in humor, "I couldn't very well let the children sleep on the floor in the receiving room for the night. You, though, that's debatable."
As he brushed his teeth, he lectured himself on how the night was going to go. He was going to walk into the bedroom, crawl into that embarrassingly huge bed, say goodnight and definitely not think about the attractive, intelligent man laying mere feet away from him.
Silently, he nodded and left the light burning as he slid into bed and pulled the covers up around them. He stretched out on his back and left one arm held away from his body in invitation. He didn't have to wait long.
Instead of arguing with his terminally infallible wife, Lucius just rolled his eyes and steered her away from the floo room and towards their own dinner for two. "I'm sure you are correct, my sweet, but let's continue onto our own dinner before we forget it all together."
Lucius sniffed disdainfully having caught on that he'd missed something muggle and turned the contract back toward him picking up the quill and scrawling his really rather unnecessarily ornate signature at the bottom.
He glanced back over toward the other kids sitting on the stone patio and smiled at the pride Teddy was taking in Ruby and how James was indulging him while he carried on about how pretty she was. Draco was fond and amused at the sight.
Of course all the adults already knew what it said, but the children were curious and watching in awe as Teddy gingerly pried the seal on the envelope open and pulled his letter from inside.
Draco heard an angry huff from Hermione and glanced over to see that she was glaring at him pointedly, as if she really thought that his and Harry's past animosity would truly make a difference.
The dust had been vanished, the kitchen table wiped down, and the dish pile in the sink soaking in a couple gallons of soapy water by the time James, Albus, and Lily peeked their heads in nearly an hour later.
Money wasn't a bad thing. It was all how you used it. If the Weasleys had had more money their lives would have been a hundred times easier. Not that money would have made them any happier, the Weasley's didn't need money to be happy.
"You can't tell me you didn't see the children celebrating when the floo mysteriously broke, or when Scorpius bribed Shotzy," Narcissa said wryly.
Andromeda felt herself blanch then flush with shame. How much had he heard? It didn't matter, she realized, as she looked at his lank hair and his unhappy eyes. He'd heard enough.
"It was a headache. The Centaurs are a nightmare to deal with. You can never get a straight answer out of them." She grumbled as she stuffed her mouth with a soup soaked roll.
, Draco finished for him silently, his gaze meeting Harry's once more. "I know, Harry," he murmured, heart beating hard in his chest. "I feel it, too."
"It's not that hard, James," Lily chimed in from across the table. "Just look for the names Tonks, Lupin, Black, or Malfoy."
Slipping his second sapphire cufflink into the cuffs of his dress shirt, Lucius shrugged on his midnight blue business robes and smoothed out the wrinkles with his hands. He picked up his cane on his way to the bedroom door and dropped a light kiss on the top of his wife's perfectly arranged head.
"You couldn't have," Draco murmured, giving his shoulder a squeeze. "We'll see to her. Why don't you go and sit with your kids for a bit." He nodded over his shoulder to the two children crying with their grandparents. "They need you a bit more right now."
Grimmauld place may be an ancestral home, but it was no Malfoy Manor. It didn’t have acres of manicured gardens, or a full stables, or thirty rooms no one used, or half a dozen sitting rooms with furniture you can’t sit on because they’re probably older than Merlin, but it has lots of color, and life, and is so obviously
Draco's breath caught in his throat when Harry curled his fingers gently tilting his head to just the right angle as he leaned in.
They stood in silence for a time. Harry thinking about what Draco had told him. Ginny had loved their kids, even if it just wasn’t enough. She still loved them despite her break down and abandonment. Astoria on the other hand sounded like she didn’t care for anything except money and things.
James returned her smirk with a small smile and turned back to look at the horse who seemed completely unconcerned with being stared at.
Harry smiled at that as he peeked into James's room and saw his eldest son spread-eagle on his bed, mouth open and red hair everywhere. He slipped the door closed quietly and sneaked a peek into Albus's room. The little boy was curled up so far under his blankets that all Harry could see from the door was a little sun tanned nose and tuft of black hair. A look into Lily’s saw that she was sprawled over her little bed, her pink bedspread kicked off and nearly hanging down to the floor.
"I don't think so." Harry shrugged though looking a little less assured. "Draco didn't seem to think it would be a problem and they are rather fond of Teddy." He bit his lip and dropped a bald potato into the water filled pot on the table. "If it is a problem we can just have it at Grimmauld."
"Has your mother exhausted herself, yet?" Lucius asked as he stepped up next to his son to watch Narcissa rattle off instructions to their English house-elves in French.
Draco placed a hand under Harry's chin and turned his face to look at him with a raised eyebrow. "You didn't tell your kids that we were enemies?” he asked incredulously.
"Come along, ducklings. Mother awaits us with cookies and pumpkin juice." He grinned and strolled from the room, the children automatically following after him like he was the pied piper.
Narcissa was forced to avert her eyes to keep from rolling them. Honestly, why does Lucius desert her with his devil-woman mother every time the harpy visits? She was going to have to have a little chat with her husband once she finds him.
The others agreed and soon they were all tangled in a pile on Teddy's twin bed underneath his constellation stitched comforter.
"No, no," Ron said visibly trying to calm himself. "It's alright. I don't know what has been going on with her lately. She's just been getting worse." He deflated a bit and sighed tiredly. "She even snapped at Hugo yesterday. I've never seen her seriously raise her voice to either of our children before."
He'd flooed the kids to the Burrow a couple of times hoping maybe a visit with their grandparents would help, but it only seemed to make it worse. Even their loony Aunt Luna showing up in the backyard one evening to take the kids on a hunt for Crumple-Horned Snorkacks hadn’t much lightened their sprits.
"Mm." She smirked. "She mentioned that Harry got angry at her when she questioned the wisdom of letting his children associate with us. Apparently, he was quite forceful in his support of our family, my love."
This was met with stunned silence. All the boys looked at her with varying degrees of confusion and surprise.
"How do we do that?" James asked sitting up again, his eyes bright with excitement Mischief slivering down to stretch across his lap.
Draco glanced over his shoulder and he smiled at him, an unreadable look in his eyes. The muscles of his back shifting as he leaned over and snagged his pajama top off the bed.
"I don't know, son," Draco responded just as quietly as he brushed back Scorpius's long bangs from his hopeful face. "We can't speak Parseltongue and I don't want what happened today to ever happen again."
"Your son has a shop in Diagon, doesn't he, though?" Peters continued on completely oblivious to the warnings looks his coworkers were trying to give him and the increasingly infuriated thinning of Lucius's lips. "Can't imagine he gets a lot of business what with his record and all. It's tough to build up credibility when you're on the losing side, eh?" He chortled as if expecting Lucius to agree with him and be grateful for his attentions.
A mischievous glint chased away the broodiness. "I have an idea, but I'm not sure if it will work out so I'd rather keep it a bit of a secret for now." He winked at her making her shake her head in amusement.
Her breath hitched and she sobbed slowly stepping into her dad's arms and clutching at him like her life depended on it. Harry wrapped his arms around her and lifted her off the floor. Latching onto him like a starfish, Lily locked her legs around his waist and squeezed her arms around his neck nearly choking him. Burying her face in his neck she began to bawl, all the pain and uncertainty of her mother’s disappearance finally hitting her.
Harry listened and watched as her threadbare composure started to unravel. “I know, Ginny,” he told her though it didn’t ease her burden. “But why did you leave them? Why abandon our children? You could have just filed for a severing.”
"Hm. Yes, so we are." Lucius chuckled in amusement and a little bit of resignation. Not so long ago he would have despaired at being related to Potters and Weasleys. But, perhaps these Potter-Weasley offspring were not so bad.
Lucius nodded then picked up a packet of papers and began flipping through them. "Nevertheless, you seem to be doing quite well on your own, even with Mr. Potter's somewhat lackadaisical business attitude."
"You really let your kids have snakes?" he asked as he and Harry sat down at the kitchen table where they could see out the backdoor and into the yard.
Lucius relaxed back in his seat and pressed his fingers together again. "Once I have that information and have reviewed it, I will request an appointment with both you and Mr. Weasley," he suppressed a sneer, "to discuss your reinvestment options. As the only other owner of the business you really should have more of an idea of what is going on," he chastised sounding strangely paternal.
"I wouldn't call myself an investor." Harry laughed and batted at Draco's hand. "It's just the Wheezes I got a share in."
"My financial adviser," Harry repeated slower with a slight grimace of anticipation. "He's bloody rich, you know. Draco told me he accumulated most of the Malfoy wealth after his father died and he became Lord of the Manor. Part ownerships in businesses, investments, real-estate. It was all Lucius." He shrugged. "I got to thinking and I want to leave my kids that kind of legacy. I want them to have property and wealth. Something you have to work at to maintain even if you don't technically have a job."
Draco rolled his eyes and watched the little emergency triage the house-elves set up off to one side. "I have no clue, Father. She's your wife and she won't listen to me."
A gush of air exploded from Ron’s lungs. Looking back it didn't really surprise him, it just... It was just a little hard to hear it out loud.
Harry's lips turned up for a split second in a grin then he slid a hand behind Draco's neck and pulled him in, deepening their kiss.
Andromeda’s own angry scowl didn’t lesson. "The war may be over, but the prejudices are just as strong now as they ever were," she countered, coldly.
"You know what I mean," Harry grumbled, pressing his face more firmly into Draco's chest inhaling his perpetually cookie flavored scent. He felt the snakes uncurl and slither down his body to the table then the floor. They were probably going to Teddy's room, Harry thought, feeling glad for their presence.
A distinctly uncomfortable feeling was crawling up his spine. Harry turned around and made sure to keep his voice low. "Hey guys, knock off the hissing until we get home. It's drawing too much attention."
Standing just inside the threshold, they all just stared wide eyed around the study in fear and excitement. The adrenaline pumping in their veins made them just a tad bit dizzy. This was, by far, the scariest thing they had ever done.
Every time looks of fear would darken their faces. Eventually Harry couldn’t take it anymore and had started dragging them along wherever he went. The Burrow was still a sore spot for the kids, but they'd become quite adapt at fitting the four of them into the floo all together.
"I can't leave the kids alone and I can't really put this off until I die," he stated with little amusement. "If I choose a time that is convenient, would you consider accompanying me?" Harry asked Lucius tentatively. "You are Dark enough to handle anything the Blacks might throw at us and you most likely know more wizarding history and heritage then the whole of the Ministry combined. Would you mind going with me?" he asked again this time sounding rather hopeful.
Draco was surprised by Narcissa’s unexpectedly happy laugh. "That's wonderful, dear. Do you know what your grandmother's name is?"
Narcissa just watched her from the corner of her eye. That was a Cassiopeia comment if ever she heard one. To anyone other than this woman, it would be entirely too easy to become attached to a child, any child.
Molly came rushing forward practically shoving her sons out of her way to grab a surprised Draco by the cheeks and pull him into a tight hug leaving two red lipsticked kisses over his pale cheeks.
"Finances," Harry said trying to sound confident. He wouldn't let the older man know that he was, in fact, somewhat intimidating.
Ron just tilted his head to the side, a silent urge for his friend to continue. He'd gotten better at this feelings thing since school.
She looked at him puzzled for a moment before she shook her head slowly. "No, sir. This tank houses our Pythons and Constrictors. We have two Burmese Pythons -those large ones curled up in that corner- and the rest are a mix of Ball Pythons, Boa Constrictors, Reticulated Pythons, and Dwarf Reticulated Pythons."
"Yeah. Have since the war." He shrugged again lounging in his seat stretching out his legs and crossing them at the ankle. Lucius didn’t comment on it.
"Oh. No! He's not my son," Harry quickly corrected. "Teddy's my godson. His father had been one of my father's best friends," he explained. "And his mother had been a good friend of mine. He was born in the middle of the war and they asked me to be his godfather. Both of them died in the war," he finished, voice turning low and solemn.
The first scrutinizing redhead to step forward Draco recognized as the surviving twin of the terrifying twosome.
They traded a few more pleasantries before she wandered off to find her grandson and greet her sister. Draco continued on to the floo room and made it just in time to catch a very pregnant woman as she tumbled out of the fireplace.
Harry took a breath and tried to calm his next words. "I know you and Ted feared, and to some extent, disapproved, of Tonks marrying Remus and putting herself in danger, but you have to let it go, Andromeda. You're holding onto old fears that are no longer relevant. Narcissa and Lucius have never once given any indication that they cared that Teddy's father was a werewolf."
Draco stood to help as well only to be pushed back down in his seat quite forcefully. "No, dear. You're our guest. You sit and chat some more. Harry will help me."
"Mm," Lucius agreed, then lifted his finger and pointed to a diamond and the platinum stitched name beneath it. "Draco Lucius Malfoy and Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy." He tapped the star beneath it.
“Why?” Draco asked in concern. “Going to Hogwarts is wonderful. You remember how amazing it was. Why are you worried about him?”
"Hm, yes. I thought so." Lucius nodded blandly watching the horse with a practiced eye. "Narcissa had a fit when I purchased him. Claimed he was too unruly and dangerous or some such nonsense. Draco was delighted of course."
"Shotzy is sorry, Master Malfoy," he squeaked apprehensively, flicking a quick glance at Scorpius's silently pleading face. "But the floo is being broken until the morning, sir." He cringed, waiting for his punishment.
As she began to usher him away, shaking out his overwhelmed haze, Scorpius seemed to remember the lessons his own grandmother and bestowed on him and paused in his steps. "Thank you for inviting us, Mrs. Weasley," he intoned formally, a little nervously.
"No, probably not," Draco answered with a smile and snagged a ripe red strawberry, before shouting, "Scorpius! What have I told you about trying to pluck the peacocks!"
Harry glanced over his shoulder at Lucius who nodded almost imperceptibly. "Yes, thank you," Harry responded after he turned back to the goblin.
"Oh Fritz! What are you doing down there? Hurry and go round up the peacocks. They're making a terrible mess of my Azaleas!" Narcissa instructed the house-elf from the other side of the patio.
Of course he gave was absolutely no outward appearance that this bothered him. Lucius simply nodded politely to the ones brave enough to meet his eyes and ignored the ones impolite enough to openly stare. The lift ride down to the Minister's office, however, tried his composure considerably.
"What exactly is that?" Harry asked warily edging around the wooden chest to get Lucius between himself and it.
Teddy took a step toward her and hesitated. He unwound his snakes from his neck and held them out for Harry to take then he hurried forward and wrapped his arms tight around his grandma’s middle.
A small grin stole over Draco's lips. "There are some dangerous ones, but they've been warded with magic so that you can't get hurt by them," he explained. "Why don't I get my mother to come and show you some of the more exotic magical plants that we have?" He straightened, looking around until he caught his mother's eye. She excused herself from her conversation and made her way over to them.
Really, those articles on the Rotfang Conspiracy were truly fascinating. Total crap, obviously -gum disease, really?-, but they were rather well researched and thought out considering.
Lily kept running, her head down, dodging witches and wizards left and right, her eyes fastened unwaveringly on her -thankfully- brightly colored companion. She trusted Belle to not lead her astray, so she concentrated on keeping up with the snake and not losing sight of her underneath all those feet.
That earned him tentative smiles from the children. Albus pulled his face away from Draco's neck and wiped furiously at his eyes trying to get rid of the remnants of his tears.
Eddy and Chrissy gasped and watched in amazement as the chair did a little dance before Harry set it back down gently in the grass.
"Why don't you leave Teddy with me for a while?" Harry suggested brightening at the thought. "You could take a break and relax, and me and the kids could spend some long overdue time with our favorite Teddy."
Dinner went on comfortably. When it was over and the dishes were cleared, Draco signaled to a house-elf and stood from his seat. "It's time to sing to the birthday boy!"
Harry shot a look at Lucius who was staring at the girl as if she'd just told him he'd look good in a tutu.
The Weasleys and the Potters followed Draco out of the room and to the floo where they all flooed to Grimmauld in a bit of a daze.
The kids were called in and forced to wash their hands like the good little children they rarely acted like, then they all sat down in the kitchen for dinner.
Pulling himself together, Lucius inclined his head politely. "That's quite alright, Minister. Nothing was done that couldn't be remedied."
A choked retching noise came from Lucius and Harry had to laugh. "Calm down, Malfoy," he chuckled. "It's not that big of a deal. I don't have the other two anymore, so it's not like I'm all powerful or anything."
"Oh." Molly looked a little taken aback, but quickly recovered. "That sounds lovely, dear, but don't you think that -um- Lucius and Narcissa would mind?"
Andromeda sighed and tucked a dark flyaway piece of hair behind her ear. “While I was saying uncomplimentary things about you, Harry was refuting and scolding me at every turn. He forced me to finally admit that the past is the past and that I needed to let my insecurities die.”
Teddy smiled as he lifted his wrist and stroked his other hand over her body. He pulled the other snake from on top his head and curled him around his neck. "I like them," he declared. "I like them a lot."
James moved to the cabinet holding the last clean dishes while Albus moved to get the glasses and Lily pulled the silverware drawer open all without a word. Harry wanted to bang his head against the counter. Their silence was like a knife to the chest.
Harry looked down at him with a distinctly tender expression. "I'm not really sure I mind all that much, Draco. Do you?"
"Yes." Draco nodded. "He's known about the Wizarding World since Harry left for Hogwarts and apparently both of his children will be attending Hogwarts when they turn eleven."
James stepped forward and scuffed his shoe at the rug for a few seconds before he looked at Draco from under his auburn bangs and stuck his hand out shyly. "Thank you, Mr.- Draco," he murmured, face hopeful and apprehensive.
She watched him for across the table as he started to try and clean little Hugo's syrup covered face with sure gentle strokes and wondered if he was such a naturally paternal -maternal- man because he was a matris.
"Don't lie!" Albus shouted suddenly drawing the attention of nearly everyone on the patio. "Mum did run away! She ran away from us!"
Harry gritted his teeth in frustration and struggled not to raise his voice as well. "I am sorry I didn’t tell you sooner, Andromeda. But while Teddy may be your grandson, Tonks and Remus named me his godfather. I have only ever had his best interests at heart. He loves it at Malfoy Manor and I will take him there, where he can spend time with some of the only blood family he has left. I will not let your old grudges take that away from him," he finished tensely, leaned forward in his seat as if ready to spring to his feet.
Fighting the urge to bristle, Draco just nodded to her and turned to catch his son's eye. "Scorpius, you remember Grand-mère. Come and greet her," he instructed stiffly.
Andromeda seemed taken aback for a second before her aristocratic upbringing came back to her. “Yes, thank you, Narcissa. That would be lovely.” She flashed a halfhearted, unsure smile at her younger sister and hesitantly seated herself, leaning back facing the windows.
He shook his head dejectedly. “I never wanted to cut contact with her. I just didn’t want her prejudice to make things hard on Teddy, or the kids, or you. I didn’t think she would just disappear from our lives because I refused to allow her to dictate who I choose to expose him to.”
They began at one end and worked their way around like they had before. Harry didn't pause very long until he came upon a coal black suit of armor, the Black crest emblazoned up on the shield and the hilt of the sword.
"Oh tosh, Draco!" Narcissa interrupted her son's lecture. "I'll do nothing to the boy. He isn't at fault here. I have long since regretted isolating my sister. It was bad enough losing one to insanity. I wish I hadn't lost the other to pride and prejudice. Her grandson is welcome in my home regardless of whether we are on speaking terms or not."
"You're right." James pursed his lips in determination. "I'm sure Draco didn't realize just how horrible Voldemort was when he became a Death Eater. I mean, his dad was in Azkaban so he couldn't very well warn him, could he?" he declared, receiving too enthusiastic nods of agreement from the other kids.
"Lily! Don't you dare try and get into that shed!" Harry suddenly shouted jolting Ron from his thoughts.
Jumping in surprise, Albus spun around. Seeing another boy standing there he rubbed furiously at his teary face with the backs of his bleeding hands. "What?" he croaked.
The long, thin drawer center under the desktop only held various business tools; quills, ink, wax, several different kinds of wax stamps, and quite a few instruments Scorpius had never seen before. He moved on to the next drawer and only found parchment and stationary. The next, though, when he tried to open it he found that it was completely stuck.
Stepping forward and pulling everyone's attention, Draco smiled brightly for them. "Dinner is about to be served. Would you all please find your seats."
Mowgli just grinned at him and shook his head. "I will stay until your little Chameleon sees his gift then I must leave. My wife is making curry tonight."
She was one of Harry's best and oldest friends. What would happen if she never warmed up to him and her animosity created a rift. Draco didn't think he could stand that.
Harry stared blankly for a long moment, his mind sluggishly turning that information over and over trying to make sense of it.
“Hello, Andromeda. Won’t you sit down?” She gestured to one of the loungers facing the floor to ceiling windows. “Would you like some tea? Something cool to drink perhaps?”
He groaned and wrapped both arms around her, burying his face in her neck giving it a light nip. "I'm not a young man anymore, Narcissa. I don't think I'll be up for more tonight unless I want to miss the Minister in the morning."
Glancing around, Draco spotted his son asleep on a pile of pillows curled securely around Albus. It was sweet and intimate in an innocent childish way and it sparked an idea in Draco's mind that he resolved to watch out for in the future.
Just as he was taking a step toward the case to get a better look, an excited shout rang out in the shop making him jump.
"No!" Harry protested unable to hide his slight amusement at his friend's sad expression. "George doesn't know Draco and I are seeing each other, just that we're friends, and your Mum kind of cornered me when I had a -um- bit of a panic about it and she dragged everything out of me."
"Yes." Draco nodded. "She's actually quite fascinating once you get a little tea and whiskey into her."
Opening his mouth to protest indignantly, he was stilled when Harry squeezed his knee under the table. "That means she likes you," Harry whispered into his ear. "If she wants to feed you, she likes you."
"You had no right, Harry!” Andromeda violently slapped a hand on the table in frustration and anger. “No right to let those prejudice blood supremacists anywhere near Teddy."
“I am falling apart,” Ginny murmured into the breeze coming off the ocean. “I am falling apart and I didn’t want to fall apart when the kids were depending on me.”
"Yes, which is much too often, clumsy child of mine," Draco teased as he leaned over and pinched his son playfully in the ribs. Both boys giggled.
"Nah," he drawled dismissively. "They’re not poisonous and they won't disobey me. I'm the 'Lord of the Serpents' or something ridiculous like that. Technically I'm every snake’s master. They wouldn't dare harm my kids."
Andromeda seemed genuinely surprised by his manner and his words, but recovered quickly. “ Narcissa was just telling me about the children's ploys to match-make Harry and Draco.”
"Albus!" Scorpius exclaimed. Unable to contain himself any longer he threw himself across the room into Albus's equally ecstatic arms for a tight hug.
Setting his half eaten wrap down on his plate, Lucius wiped his hands elegantly on his paper napkin, and cleared his throat. "Miss Lovegood, as I'm sure you are aware, Mr. Potter would like to invest in your magazine,"he began.
Well, he'd gotten what he didn't know he'd wished for... in spades. Potter's children sure made enough noise for a small army.
"Oi! Watch where you're going, young man!" the man yelled as Albus struggled to his feet, his hands burning. They’d broken his fall and gotten skinned on the cobblestones of the Alley.
"I said, are you okay?" the little boy with silvery blond hair and gray eyes asked again in concern. He was dressed in nice clean robes and he inched closer to Albus cautiously, his brow furrowing. "Why are you crying?"
"Ah!" he said as he pulled a couple of sheets out of the stack. "Am I to assume, Mr. Potter, that you have not taken the time to go through either of the Black or Potter heirloom vaults?" he asked needlessly.
Harry may not know everything about the Wizarding World, but Lucius knew absolutely nothing about the Muggle World. He felt like they were on a little more even ground now.
"Brilliant." Ron grinned and rubbed his hands together happily only to be elbowed by his wife. "Ow! What Hermione?"
Not surprised in the least, Harry grinned at him and congratulated him. Soon the kids were off playing once more in the yard with their snakes. Harry slipped his wand back into its holster and strode over to his cousin.
"Well," Scorpius hedged. "We could look in my grandpa's study. He usually keeps all the important stuff about the family in there."
"Oh! No!" Harry jumped to reassure. "It's just- It's been a while since I shared a bed with anyone," he said truthfully, but the real reason for his nervousness was not the prospect of sleeping next to someone after so a long sleeping alone. It was that he didn’t know what to do about the way his body thrummed at the prospect of sleeping in the same bed as Draco.
Shaking his head, he sighed and propped his chin on his hand watching an old man in a bowler hat walk his dog along the sidewalk.
Combing his fingers through Draco's hair, Harry stroked over his neck and shoulders, and pressed down his back to grasp at his waist, pulling him closer.
Draco let out a breathy chuckle as he returned the favor, smiling in amusement as he inhaled the sweet and spicy scents clinging to Harry’s skin. Eyes closed in contentment, he grinned. "You smell like ice cream and soot."
Draco decided that he'd hold out judgment on that, but followed Harry's urging out of the kitchen and into the backyard anyway.
Chuckling, Lucius just stroked his fingers over the cloth and diamonds. "Well, the Black ancestors apparently valued a complete history of their future offspring. This will even have you and your children on it, from both sides if I'm not mistaken."
He lifted his humus, eggplant, and tabbouleh wrap to his mouth and took a healthy bite. Lucius chewed thoughtfully and swallowed tentatively. When it didn't immediately come back up, he figured it didn't taste so bad and took another bite, this one more eager than the first.
He nodded and grinned.  "Yeah, we get along pretty great actually. He's really great with the kids, completely natural. Charming, funny, and easier to talk to than I would have ever thought. Even if he can still be snarky and sarcastic when he feels like it." Harry paused suddenly, his enthusiasm melting into a wistful sigh. "And he's gorgeous."
"What's that you've got, dear?" Molly interrupted as she seemed to pop up in front of them out of nowhere, this time with a platter of something delicious smelling in her hands.
Their meeting with Lucius had gone surprisingly well. Harry was going to finance research and development for some products George had been itching to work on. If they proved profitable they were going to start looking for another location for a second shop to expand.
"At least it says he switched sides in the Final Battle," James offered awkwardly. "What kept him out of Azkaban after that though? Wouldn't people have thought he was lying like he did before?" he wondered.
Cringing slightly, Harry ran a hand through his hair, averting his gaze off to the side for a moment. "No, actually. It's a really rare ability. Even in the Wizarding World," he admitted. "Most wizards are wary of Parselmouths; people who talk to snakes."
Keeping a tight hold on Lily's hand and checking over his shoulder to make sure Albus and James were still behind him, Harry lead the way to the Minister's office at the end of the hall and passed by the flustered secretary without a glance. He wouldn't be there long anyway.
There was an uncomfortable silence. They all were remembering when Lucius had caught them spying on their dads. None of them were particularly eager to jump at the chance to sneak into the man's personal study.
"I miss Mummy!" she sobbed into his skin and his slumped a little. "Why won't she come back? I want her to come back!"
All the children mulled that over for a time then James made an inquiring sound. "So, if Miss Cissy is Teddy's great-aunt, does that make you his great-uncle?"
Harry shook his head and nearly laughed at the look of relief that washed over Lucius's face before he wiped it off again. "I had all three at one time. But now..." he trailed off and shrugged nonchalantly.
Dudley clicked his tongue in mild frustration shaking his head. "Nah, Marianne's not like that. She was worried just as much as me when Chrissy suddenly disappeared to our roof. She's just happy our little girl is healthy and happy. You know how mothers are."
"Oh tosh!" she interrupted again and placed a strong hand on his back propelling him toward the floo. "Get on with you. Have a nice night and be sure to tell us how it went when you get home tomorrow."
Shacklebolt stood from his seat and held out a hand. "Not that I know of, Mr. Malfoy. I will be in contact if there is any information we need from you as the investigation progresses."
Lucius blinked in surprised for a split second then turned his steel gray gaze on Teddy. He stared at the boy unblinkingly for a long moment, watching the poor boy fidget and wipe his sweaty palms on his jeans.
Looking back at his grandson, Lucius asked, "And why were you looking for information on Andromeda Black in my desk?"
"Pretty sure I sent you an owl requesting a meeting with you, Mr. Malfoy. This really isn't much of a surprise," Harry responded dryly as he took a seat in the dark green velvet wing-backed chair arranged across from Lucius' desk.
Claude looked positively scandalized. "Certainly not, Master Draco." He huffed indignantly. "Perhaps it is the roasted duck you are smelling. Some find the aroma displeasing."
Harry nodded in understanding. He remembered the way Lucius had begged Voldemort in the Shrieking Shack to let him go to the castle so he could find his son. The once proud arrogant man had been gaunt and unkempt with bruised haunted eyes. He'd seen how Azkaban had marked Lucius and he was sure it still haunted him to some extent even now.
Just then Harry stepped through the open kitchen door. "Hey, Draco. I heard something crash. Is everything okay…" he trailed off frozen in the doorway while he took in the scene before him.
That did surprised him. Draco turned to at Harry fully. "Granger didn't take it well, but Weasley did?"
They were just about to debate which room Harry should sleep in when Tipsy, one of the maintenance house-elves, appeared with some rather unexpected news.
"Yes," Lucius confirmed. "If I remember correctly, Wilberga Black struck her from the family tree. All ties were cut between your grandmother and her family, Narcissa and Bellatrix never saw or spoke to her again. Narcissa had not even met your mother, nor you until your godfather brought you here."
He had never wanted to curse someone so much in his life than he did seeing the flushed, humiliated faces of his children. He turned back around to do just that, but that wouldn't have helped them. In truth he didn't know what would help them.
"Ah, Harry." Mowgli smiled at him as he neared and held the cage up to show him. "I have brought her. Right on time, I think," he said gesturing toward the half eaten chameleon cake.
Harry did snort then. "Not everything is about you, you bloody great narcissist." And he highly doubted that absolutely all of it was legal. At least some of what he had before the war had to be a little bit dubious.
"Come along, then, Hermione," she ushered as the girl stood up as well, followed closely by Draco. "You're in no condition to be going anywhere and I'm sure your husband and children aren't much better. I'll show you to a guest suite then Draco will send Ronald up to you."
Soon after all the guests were settled great platters of food appeared in front of them and the feast began.
Her heart lurched and she shifted to lay nearly on top of him. "God, Lucius. What are we going to do? What will happen if they... if they-"
Jumping in surprise, Harry shot a look at Lucius who was frowning, his tapping and drumming halted. "What on earth is that? Fletcher!"
Glaring in frustration, he stomped out of the solarium like he’d stomped in, grumbling under his breath and cursing to high heaven.
"Draco!" Narcissa gasped from across the table in horror. "I taught you better manners than that. Close your mouth this instant!"
"Ah, yes." Kingsley nodded again leaning back in his chair and folding hands in front of him. "This matter was better spoken of in person. It's rather sensitive to the Ministry itself."
Malfoys were being friendly and charming to Potters of all sizes. Ron and Hermione are not going to believe this, he thought. But people changed after the war. Harry certainly had. Why couldn't the Malfoys?
"Oh, all sorts." Audrey waved her hand around, a bit of excitement shining through her eyes. "Originally, we started with women's health research. You know, like gynecology and-"
"Whatever," scoffed James appearing behind Lily. "You probably don't even want to find Albus. One less kid to worry about."
"Oh, you know." Draco frowned and waved a hand around distractedly. "Sound business ventures, financing promising entrepreneurs, real-estate, some donating thrown in there to make the Malfoy name look good again. James, watch that goose! I believe he's even looking into a man that wants to make a business out of converting muggle appliances and technology to work around magic."
Having the kids in the house helped a lot. The house almost felt relieved to have them. It felt like it was finally being appreciated, finally doing the job it was meant to do. Finally living.
Surprisingly enough, to Harry at least, the meeting went perfectly smoothly from then on. Lucius seemed to take Luna's occasional dreamy comment in stride as they negotiated intrest, and amounts, and research, and yearly earnings, and everything really.
Draco's son stepped out from behind his father a bit and stared up at him with hopeful awe. "Really?"
"Still," she persisted, "Mr. Malfoy's too nice to be really bad, right?" She sounded a little uncertain at the end, though.
He could take Draco, he thought. But did he feel comfortable leaving the children that long at the Manor without him or Draco there with them to combat their fears and anxieties? No. Maybe he could leave Draco with the kids and take Narcissa. She was a Black, she'd know what she was looking at.
"My mother planted them when she was Mistress of the Manor. We haven't been able to uproot them since," Lucius explained calmly, having composed himself enough to hide his complete and utter panic.
James looked thoughtful for a moment. "You mean the Malfoys were Death Eaters and fought for Voldemort?"
"But that was over ten years ago," she continued. "My family has closer ties with Harry Potter than the Wizarding World realizes. When they met up again after Harry's wife left it was hardly the farthest leap that they would end up letting bygones be bygones."
“We wouldn’t tear the place down or anything,” Draco muttered with a slightly bemused expression. “We’d just update it, you know. Curtains, rugs, furniture, paint, wallpaper, that kind of thing.”
The kids just kept on laughing. It was a happy sight to see. Harry just smiled and continued to listen.
"No!" she snapped, stepping away from him and wrapping her arms around her body. "It died, Ron, and it was my fault!" She pounded painfully on her chest with one shaking hand. "How can you even stand to look at me? Our baby is gone and it was my fault," she trailed off into a whisper, her bloodshot brown eyes streaming with tears.
"That's right. Dad testified for them at their trial." Teddy nodded. "But what does that have to do with Grandma hating them so much?"
Draco and Hermione both watched her intently. Waiting for her to continue. They didn't have to wait long.
"I don’t know much about the creatures," he responded coolly trying to make it perfectly clear that he was not encouraging Charles’s attentions in the least.
"I know what you mean," Molly said, leaning closer to Narcissa and ignoring both of their husbands. "After we got married, Arthur's mother was a right bit-"
The guilt and feelings of uselessness had not disappeared all together (Harry feared they never would), but Draco had a way of making everything seem like it was going to be alright. Which was ironic considering how much time he’d spent making Harry's life difficult back in school.
"Whatever, you prat." Harry rolled his eyes and turned on his side to face him. "Thanks for letting us stay, Draco."
With the kids finally settled into the only un-waxed guestrooms, Harry and Draco retreated into Draco’s suite.
A blinding smile broke over Harry's face as he lifted himself up from Draco's chest to better deepen their kiss. He pulled away after a long moment and nuzzled their noses together lovingly. "I love you, too, Draco."
"I'm alright, Harry," Teddy responded quietly as he turned around and buried his face in Harry's stomach for a moment. "I'm gonna go to my room now," he mumbled, stepping back. Then he bolted for the door.
Harry suppressed the urge to sigh in relief. "I took James, Albus, and Lily to Diagon Alley after I went to the Ministry and told Kingsley I quit."
"Oh! Yes, Master," Shotzy whimpered and scrambled up into the chimney quickly disappearing from view.
"You don't want us either. You're just here ’cause you don't have to work. I bet you never wanted us!" he yelled jumping up from his seat and dashing out of the kitchen with an angry red face and flashing green eyes.
"There are two other magic schools in Europe that I know of. One is somewhere in Eastern Europe, Durmstrang, but they don't accept muggleborns and they teach the Dark Arts besides. The other is in France, Beauxbatons. The Headmistress served as a liaison with the Giants for us in the war. And, of course, there’s Ilvermorny over in the Americas," he rambled on oblivious to his cousins’ slightly overwhelmed expressions.
Harry watching with an amused smirk and thought, not for the first time, that Ron did domestic just a tad bit better than Hermione. Then again, he did have Molly to use as a role model.
Finally, one evening after a silent dinner of Molly's Shepard's pie and morose children he was desperate enough to owl Malfoy in hopes that maybe a change of scenery and an escape from well-meaning but unhelpful family would finally do everyone some good.
The goblin picked up the keys and examined them thoroughly. Then he gave a fractional nod and slid them back over the counter. "And would you like your own cart for the duration of your visit?"
"Nice to see you again, Malfoy." George smiled at him kindly then turned and playfully ruffled Scorpius's hair. "You too, Scor."
"Well, I figured that since we're getting on so well, we might as well be friends. You got a problem with that?" Harry tried to sound casual, but he fiercely hoped that Draco wanted them to be friends and not just companionable acquaintances.
Sighing, Teddy pushed away from the bookcase and headed for the table. It would go faster if everyone helped, he knew.
"What are you here to discuss, Mr. Potter?" Lucius asked in a cool voice, his gray gaze calculating.
The kids gasped in anticipation and Draco grinned at his captive audience. "Now, I thought that was a brilliant idea. Everybody knows Gryffindors are afraid of snakes, so why not try it out and watch Harry cower in fear."
She dressed more casually than Narcissa remembered, not so luxurious of fabrics or intricate of detailing. So much was different, but still so much was the same as well.
"Nah, mate, it's alright.” He waved off the apology easing some of the tightness in Harry’s expression. “I kinda figured as much. It just makes it real to hear it out loud."
tone in her voice, Andromeda thought to herself with perhaps misplaced amusement. Narcissa had always been a prissy little thing when she was displeased.
A house-elf dressed as a miniature butler strode into the breakfast room carrying a silver tray in one hand.
Rubbing at his smarting ear, Harry admitted that she had a point. He could always depend on Andromeda to tell it like it is and not sugar coat anything. And despite the small lingering ache of guilt he couldn’t say he wasn’t moving on anyway. His kids were getting happier and he no longer felt like he was drowning in uncertainty. They were all getting on with their lives.
Andromeda sat back in surprise. That made sense, though, she was forced to concede. She was still leery of trusting Lucius Malfoy completely, like he was surely still leery of her, but the man was certainly rich enough. He must be doing something right.
Narcissa looked torn for a moment until she looked at her husband and saw nothing, but support and understanding on his handsome face. Turning back to her son, she nodded slowly.
"If you would begin eating," Lucius broke in coolly as he studied the two new arrivals, "I believe Scorpius has volunteered to give you a tour of the grounds. There is much to see."
"Since when have you ever felt sorry for the house-elves? And no, it's actually next Saturday. Mother is just doing some preemptive preparation." Draco flinched when a shriek of pain echoed over the gardens. Looks like poor Phletcher got caught in the Rapier Roses again.
"Hey, Luna. No, I'm not deaf. I was just in my study and it took me a minute to get here." He grinned in greeting at the disembodied head in his fireplace.
A yelp was wrenched out of him as Molly caught his ear with her deceptively strong fingers and yanked. "There will be none of that language in my house, young man. You're not too old to be bent over my knee and don't you forget it!" She let his ear go, but her disapproving frown never left her plump, pretty face.
With his mind made up, Harry jumped out of bed and walked quietly out of his room up the stairs to the owlery where his owl, Artemis, was perched sleepily with a wing covering his head.
Chuckling at that Draco stroked a hand over the snake and twirled a lock of Lily's hair around his finger. "You can tell Belle that my hair is naturally this shiny."
"He threw Draco three times," Lucius answered seemingly unconcerned with James's outrage. "The beast was a danger to my son."
"What are you-" the voice cut off when the door swung open revealing a tall silvery blond man. He looked almost exactly like Scorpius right down to his gray eyes and pert nose. "Albus?" he repeated after a surprised pause looking from his son to the little boy standing nervously behind him.
She sucked in a shuddering breath. "I was at work. I'd just found out that we were having another baby and I was so happy..." she trailed off and shuddered. "Then I felt this pain. It was- awful. I didn't even have time to make it to the bathroom before I felt it." She clasped a hand to her mouth for a moment looking almost like she was going to be sick. "I felt my baby die... in all that blood."
"Firstly," he began in a mild voice, "I will commend you all on your efforts to obtain this information yourselves. As it is, you have learned more than I would have thought you'd be able to. I am," he let the corner of his mouth turn up the barest amount, "impressed."
Harry took the opportunity to speak. "I'm sure we can figure out a way to get you one. Neville's been having fits over all the exotic and rare plants the Malfoys have in the gardens, as well. We could probably get you cuttings if we put our heads together."
A mischievous grin split George's face almost in half. "Oh sure, Mr. Malfoy. We've got your sweets like our Ton-Tongue Toffees, Canary Creams, and Skiving Snack Boxes; a whole line of products geared toward faking sick to get out of classes or boring business meetings and the like."
"And you're determined to -invest-," he barely suppressed another sneer, "in her father's magazine."
"We'll talk to Scorpius about what he knows next time we see him." Teddy yawned, suddenly feeling very tired. "He might know more than we do."
"Not really," he replied. "I have some ideas, but I haven't spent much time trying to shuffle money around to fund the research and development."
"Lightning?" Harry raised an incredulous eyebrow, his own lightning bolt scar shifted with the movement.
Draco never thought he would relish sipping tea brewed from a box of tea bags out of an over sized mug with an obese cat painted on it, but it had become one of his favorite things in the day.
They meandered toward the stables in a haphazard group. Draco was in the lead keeping an eye on Scorpius and Albus as they rushed ahead examining all the hedges and bushes they past. Narcissa was still enthralled by Lily and they strolled along at a comfortable pace, Narcissa pointing out various flora to an eager learner. James however had stayed close to his father at the back of the group. He was still withdrawn, but was looking around curiously as they trekked over the grounds toward the stables.
"Shut down the floo! No one leaves or enters until I say otherwise." The elf looked surprised for a moment before nodding and popping back out again.
If there were things Harry wouldn’t tolerate above all others, the implication that he would neglect his children’s safety was one of them. Attacks on those he cared for when they couldn’t defend themselves, was another. Stuck in her old anger, fear, and bitterness Andromeda had made the mistake of doing both.
"I'm- I'm sorry, about what I said, you know," he mumbled, face turning red, unable to meet his father's eyes. "I know Mum leaving wasn't really your fault. And I know that you- that you want us," he said sounding more hopeful than sure.
He cracked the black wax seal stamped with the Malfoy crest and quickly unfolded the letter.  Reading it, a grin stretched over his sleepy face. They had themselves a plan.
"It doesn't matter!” she snarled at him. “You still took my grandson to the house of former Death Eaters, and continued to put him in danger without even thinking about what I might have to say on the matter! Do you even know what they would have done to him during the war just because of what his father was?"
Of course his apprehension didn't stop him from feeling guilty about it. The kids hadn't seen Scorpius since that morning and were becoming increasingly anxious. They spent long hours holed up in of their rooms with their snakes and it made Harry distinctly nervous. If he didn't know any better he'd think they were plotting something.
Harry snorted into his tea and started coughing. Conveniently it covered up the surprised laughter that wanted to burst forth when he saw Draco's satisfied grin.
A shuddering breath was sucked into Hermione's lungs and she gently pulled away from Narcissa pressing a hand to her own chest as if to stop her own heartbeat. "God. I'm sorry."
It took him a good ten minutes to decided that no, he really couldn't. He tugged on a pair of faded jeans, some beat-up trainers, a t-shirt, and a jacket. No, he really couldn't.
The little snake waited until he'd made it all the way up before slithering over and curling up at the bottom of the stairs to wait for him to come back down, her fiery orange eyes watching Harry's bedroom door intently.
"So it could just be that you don't notice his accidental magic, or that he just isn't inclined to do it like Chrissy. Either way, both of them have magic. And a fair amount I would guess," he concluded, crossing his arms casually.
Ron chuckled and released his hand. "No problem. This must be Scorpius, then." He turned his blue eyes on the little boy. "Harry's told me quite a bit about you."
"What?" Harry blushed and didn't look his friend in the eyes. "Well, we haven't actually slept together, but we are -um- seeing each other, dating I guess."
"No," Harry assured, amused when Draco started purring. "I suspect at least one of them will be Sorted there if all of their successful scheming is anything to go by."
Blowing out a breath, Harry just stood in his kitchen and held onto her tight like a lifeline. In a matter of days his world has been tossed into upheaval and he’s just as lost as his kids. "I'm sorry. Shh, it's okay. Everything will be alright," he kept saying not knowing if he was trying to convince his daughter or himself.
Draco glared at him then turned his furious eyes on the still giggling children behind him. "I bet you all think that was funny."
Harry crouched down and looked up into his son's sad face. "I understand why you would think that, James. I haven't been the best dad for a while now and that is completely my fault, but I would never leave you or your brother and sister for any reason." He prayed that his son truly believed him. It broke his heart that his kids would think he would ever leave them.
“Look after of them, son,” Arthur told Draco quietly, seriously. Then he smiled and shook his hand. “We hope you’ll come back sometime and have dinner with us again,” he said as if that first command had never slipped from his lips.
"It's probably going to take a while, so we should probably get some sleep until then," Teddy suggested.
"No," Audrey shook her head in agreement. "The women specific research we do is more attuned to fertility, and pregnancy and the like."
"Maybe not," Draco shrugged. "I think they lend a certain -Scorpius! Watch those cursed roses!- charm to the children. Thankfully their freckles aren't nearly as distracting as the rest of the Weasleys'."
Harry listening to her words with the respect and reverence a woman like Molly Weasley is owed. Then he sighed. "It’s not that. It's that they're all too wonderful. It would be easier if they were still as snotty, haughty, and prejudiced as they used to be. As it is, Draco won’t stop being so bloody wonderful and I don’t think I’m ready for that yet."
"Oh!" She smiled back. "That's good then. I got your letter and I got Mr. Malfoy's as well," she told him.
Brushing wet hair from his eyes he scanned the shelf in front of him searching for the shampoo. He snatched up a likely bottle and read the label. It told him little to nothing other than
Instantly, Draco felt himself tense. Sensing the sudden change, Scorpius looked up at his dad in confusion.
Lucius grunted sounding thoroughly displeased and turned back to his morning tea. He put on a show of trying to ignore the whole conversation.
"I’m glad I could help you," Narcissa assured her, giving her a gentle smile. "Are you feeling any better?"
A little shocked, Molly leaned back to get a better look at her adopted son's reddening cheeks and his hunched posture. "Are you interested in someone, Harry?" she asked, taking in his troubled almost guilty frown.
"Mm, yes," Lucius drawled in amusement as he watched the children eye him suspiciously. They could tell he was up to something and they were wary of him. "It's astonishing what the children can accomplish once they put their minds to it. Especially with those snakes."
Harry looked over to see what the shop clerk’s reaction was to this and almost burst out laughing. She looked about ready to faint from the way she was leaning against that rack of owl treats. He strode over to her with what he hoped was an innocuous smile.
The children all slumped in relief, Harry and Draco rolled their eyes to each other, and Hermione and Ron kept looking back forth between them all in confusion. There was something they were missing, they could tell.
"A fairy light, yes." Draco nodded stepped up to her. "They are very useful, but a bit ill tempered if you try to touch, so I would suggest not attempting it."
"Why do I know that name, Harry Potter?" she demanded of Lucius after she'd turned her eyes back on the messy haired wizard.
They made it to Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour, four sundaes and a small table on the outside patio later Harry was watching his children pick disinterestedly at their melting ice cream. He sighed.
Harry sat up from his lounging position and toyed with the leaves from a strawberry suddenly feeling self conscious. "Nobody knows about it. George knows, of course, but no one else. Not even Ron and Hermione." He took a deep breath realizing that he'd just told Draco Malfoy something that not even his two best friend's know about him.
“Regardless, we have done nothing wrong and if they are still not satisfied then we will cope,” Lucius concluded.
"Yes, I suggest that you do," Lucius agreed sternly. "However, seeing as you are not a Black and that you have no real knowledge of their magics, you should enlist Draco or someone else well versed in the Dark Arts to go with you. There may be -unpleasant- artifacts in that vault that you will not know how to combat," he cautioned.
Ron knew he succeeded when Harry laughed. It was brittle, but it wasn't hysterical which was what he was aiming for.
"Albus!" Scorpius rushed from behind the counter dressed much the way he'd been the first time they'd met in the shop, in expensive tailored dress robes.
"That's right, my dear." Narcissa nodded. "In fact, I believe we have some Narcissus and Dancing Chrysanthemums in the gardens. Would you both like to see them?"
"But because you have tried to obtain this information on your own and did an admirable job at it, I will reward your maturity and," he looked the Potter children over, "intelligence by answering your questions for you."
Harry chuckled with him and looked around to make sure he had all of his kids where they should be. Albus was being chattered at by Scorpius and James was giggling along with them. All three boys were standing in the middle of the room.
Hissing interspersed with English caught Draco's attention and he turned his head to see Albus and Scorpius sitting in the grass on the other side of Harry, Albus’s snake Tal curled between them.
"Wow," Harry breathed, unconsciously echoing his son. "He's beautiful." Lightning’s head rose from his feeding trough and he turned to look at them with big intelligent brown eyes almost like he was measuring them up. “Whoa.” Harry blinked. And creepy. Beautiful and kind of creepy.
Downstairs in the solarium, Draco, Narcissa, and the children sat on piles of velvety jewel toned pillows covered in gold embroidery and tassels. They were circled around a low table covered in sweets and homemade candies and the conversation was ninety percent laughter.
Unfazed by her demeanor, Lucius reached into his robes and pulled out a folder of information. "Good. Let’s look at some options and we can come to an agreement."
Glancing at his cousin shrewdly, Harry said, "You know, Dudley, there's nothing wrong with Chrissy if she turns out to be a witch. She's still your daughter either way."
He was what Harry's children will be without their burdens of insecurity and the fear of abandonment.
Harry felt a smidge guilty for unintentionally keeping this all from her. "Draco and I are... seeing each other," he said in a mumble.
“Oh, Lucius, dear.” Narcissa smiled brightly at him as he continued to stare at Andromeda, seemingly frozen in place. “You remember my sister, Andromeda.”
Draco looked back at Potter's bright green eyes and grinned. "Don't be a stranger, Potter." Then there was a sharp crack of apparation and both Malfoys were gone.
Draco didn’t want that loneliness for Scorpius, but after Astoria it seemed inevitable. Truthfully, he should have seen that coming. Trying to sleep with her had been like trying to make love to a marble statue. Unyielding and cold, unsatisfying.
"Oh, no, that's alright," Harry stammered. "I can apparate everyone home. There's really no reason to go to all that trouble."
"What!" a man yelled from behind a door open ajar into what appeared to be a stockroom. "Scorpius, what is it?"
Jumping away from the door, Harry was half expecting another horrible family portrait to appear howling and cursing at him, but soon he realized that it was just the rusted hinges of the door screaming in protest. The door swung agonizingly slowly on its own, the shrieks and groans of metal didn’t stop until it halted it’s swing abruptly, leaving the vault completely open.
Not minding the prolonged physical contact at all, Draco stroked his hands up and down Harry's back. "What made you come into the shop today?" he inquired curiously.
Feeling worry and fear settle in her chest, Narcissa nuzzled closer to her husband and sighed. "Let's not worry until we have to, love. We both need our rest." She leaned up and gave him a tender kiss. "Goodnight."
"Sure it is, Malfoy," called a grinning Ron from the kitchen door to the backyard . "It's good of you to join us," he said completely genuinely as he stepped forward and held out his hand.
The ear splitting noise abruptly stopped and all the children looked at their fathers with vaguely guilty faces. He raised an eyebrow at them.
Luna just smiled at him absently, her eyes drifting off around the room in fascination. "It wasn't hard. I just followed the peacocks."
"Mother, would you like to explain that to me?" Draco asked after she'd sipped at her cooling tea and steadied herself.
Smiling brightly, Harry leaned over and placed a tender kiss on his lips. "Thank you. This means a lot to me."
George shifted uncomfortably. Inventing had been hard for him without his partner in crime. He’d been able to invent a little when Ron had worked with him until he’d left to become an Auror. After that he’d lost some of his enthusiasm and even though he had some ideas he hadn’t been motivated enough to bother trying to get the funds.
"How are you holding up?" Harry murmured in his ear as he walked around the bench and carded a hand through Draco's hair.
“Yes.” Andromeda smiled slightly at her. “Quite vehemently. He invited me to leave if I was going to continue to say disparaging things about your family.”
Once the kids were out of ear shot, Harry turned his attention back to Ron and Hermione. As predicted they had very unhappy expressions on their faces.
What a polite way to say that her son's biological clock was ticking, Narcissa thought ungenerously. What a wretched woman, she growled internally. How very right she was, she finally admitted.
The party was dying down. Harry had left a moment ago to help an exhausted Marianne, Dudley, Chrissy, and Eddy back through the floo. Hagrid was passed out snoring on his bench, a plate of Narcissa's good china holding a half eat chameleon cake tail was resting on his belly. Minerva was chatting with Aberforth, and the Grangers were bidding their daughter and her husband goodnight.
"Very well." The goblin stepped off of his stool and called to another goblin measuring rubies at one of the tall counters on either side of the room.
He felt a pang in his chest at that thought. Ginny was his little sister and he would always love her, but for leaving Harry and the kids he could never forgive her. It didn’t matter what her excuses were, Ron wouldn’t forgive her for taking the easy way out.
A flicker of amusement creased at Draco's eyes. He lifted his hands and began soothingly stroking through Harry's hair. "Roses and hearts, Potter?"
Feeling a tad flushed even in the shade with the cool breeze, Narcissa fanned herself with her hand. “What is it, Dinky?” she asked as she carefully saved her place and closed the book.
Harry grinned back and pulled Draco into his arms taking his lips in a tender, heated kiss. "Good afternoon," he murmured licking Draco's bottom lip teasingly.
Of course, his grandmother had told him things in a little more detail. She told him that Harry had been born to a prophecy, that he had to die to kill Voldemort, that the Death Eaters had been Voldemort's followers, and his parents had died in the Final Battle where Voldemort fell.
The little boy got to his feet and reluctantly stepped up to her. She softened the slightest bit and leaned down so that he could reach her cheek. "Hello, Grand-mère," he greeted politely.
Sighing in disappointment, Scorpius reached over to pet the snake and asked, "What did I say, then?"
"Potter, let me reintroduce my parents," Draco said and nodded toward the head of the table where Lucius sat with Narcissa at his left.
"Is it-... Do you think-... How quickly should you move on after a -um- marriage severing?" he finally asked, hoping he hadn't offended her.
Draco was charming, funny, and clever. He could still be snarky and infuriating, but it didn't burn in Harry's gut like it used to. He considered him a friend now. Someone he could talk about things with. He'd even told Draco things that not even Ron and Hermione knew.
Draco nodded. "That's understandable. It's extremely rare, and sometimes regarded as Dark magic. Personally, I think anybody who thinks that is completely idiotic."
Eddy turned toward him, eyes wide. "Um- We've never seen some of those plants. Are they dangerous?" He wrapped his arm protectively around his little sister.
Draco smiled at him before turning his gaze on James and Lily. "Can either of your speak it as well?" he asked, genuinely curious.
In lieu of a disbelieving snort, Harry couldn't help, but raise an eyebrow. Lucius’s smirk grew even wider.
"Dad's healing potions are the best," Scorpius informed Albus as he stood next to the stool watching. "He always heals me every time I get hurt."
Narcissa hummed glancing around as well. "I do suppose it is a bit opulent, but that was how my husband's ancestors designed it. And who are we to question their tastes." She chuckled.
Draco sighed and shifted uncomfortably. He had to pee, again. God, it was like his bladder had shrunk three sizes in the past week.
"Come along, ducklings," he called standing up and nudging the two little boys out of their chairs. "I believe a tour of the stables is the best place to start."
Draco looked at him searchingly for a moment in the heavy silence that had fallen over the kitchen. Finally he nodded and covered one of Harry's hands with his. "She's not always that foul. It's sort of like a game to her. She's wretched to everyone when she firsts steps out of the floo until either my mother or I kick the stick out of her ass. Then she's just mildly unpleasant."
Harry raised an eyebrow at the dreamy sound of his cousin’s voice. "Did you get Marianne pregnant again, Dudley?"
"I believe that the Black family was known for disowning members that did not meet up to their family standard as purebloods. Your grandmother," Lucius nodded to Teddy, "was disowned for marrying a muggleborn, your grandfather, Theodore Tonks."
"That's amazing," Hermione exclaimed and leaned back in her chair with a far away look in her eyes. The look that meant she was puzzling over something very complicated and extremely esoteric.
"We have names too," Teddy added, causing Ron and Hermione to turn their stunned expressions on him. "They call me Chameleon, because I can change how I look," he explained.
"No." Scorpius shook his head sadly. "He told me more about the Final Battle, but other than that nothing that would make her hate us specifically."
"I have reviewed the information you so generously provided, Mr. Weasley and I am, despite my better judgment, rather impressed," Lucius began, folding his fingers together in his desk and settling his cool gray eyes on George. "You and your brother had quite the heads for business."
Draco just continued to pin her under his scrutiny. "If you ever reach an age of such infirmity that you truly cannot censor yourself, Grand-mère, then I will be obliged to over look it. As for the present, you are no more aged in quickness of mind than I am. I will not be as amenable to forgiving you the next time you choose to speak so unguardedly.
"I couldn't bear to tell Ron," she whispered again, more to herself and the darkness than to Draco and Narcissa.
"I am, too," Harry sighed, his own eyes sad, tired, and regretful. "Come back soon, Andromeda," he said, a silent plea in the words.
"Yeah," Harry repeated with a bashful smile. "I think you could really expand it. It's doing really well since the war, isn't it?"
Peeking out from behind his father, James studied the oldest Malfoy for moment before he nodded decisively. "Yes, sir."
"I don't know where I went wrong with that girl," she continued ignoring the protesting sound from Arthur sitting at the table behind them. "But there is no excuse for what she did. Even if she was unhappy, she could have come to me, to us if she felt she couldn't talk to you."
"I don't hate you!" Lily piped up from her seat. "You're not bad anymore, and you're really nice to us, and- and- I like you!"
“She’s not talked to her sister, her family in decades, Harry,” Draco reminded calmly. “Getting past disownment and years of hurt and hate will take a while.”
Downstairs in the receiving room an unseen house-elf twitched one fireplace brick in the chimney out of place and stashed it in a bread box in the kitchens.
There was a field covered in tall grass reaching up to his knees and everywhere he looked there were other children running and screaming and laughing. He hadn’t seen this many kids in one place since he’d started primary school. It was a bit intimidating.
"Wow," Lily breathed as she looked around in wonder, Belle now safely curled around her neck. "Look at all that pretty jewelry!"
"I look forward to getting to know you, James Sirius," he said seriously. Draco had asserted his authority as the adult in their interactions.
That made Draco's heart hurt for a moment with old memories of his mother's heartbroken tears and his father's helpless silence.
Dudley scowled angrily. "I'm not going to treat her like some kind of freak!" he burst out. "I got over that for the most part when you saved me from getting my soul sucked out of my mouth. I'm just- just worried is all." He deflated and began picking at one stubby thumbnail with the other.
Harry thought over his answer. "You have got to be the richest wizard I have ever met, and despite us trying to kill each other a couple of times, I can’t deny that you are an extremely smart business man. If half the things Draco told me about you are true, I can’t think of another man I would trust with my money," he stated with completely honesty.
Kingsley cursed under his breath. "Did he tell you who has been requesting this information from him?"
Harry shot him a frightened, confused look until Lucius just sighed and rubbed a gloved hand over his face. "The only explanation I can think of is that it’s not a wizard’s staff at all, not made to channel a wizard’s magic, or..." he took a deep breath and turned unfathomable gray eyes on a sweaty, shaky Harry Potter. "Or your power is far greater than you realize and you unwittingly allowed the staff to amplify it."
Nobody else at the table noticed their silent communication, save for Lucius. He had spent a good portion of his life noticing what other people didn't as a matter of survival. It wasn’t hard to decipher the silent conversation going on between Potter and his son.
Shaking his head, Harry relaxed back in his seat. "Anyway, I figure if Ron can get a Parselmouth keyed magical chamber open by hissing at it, Scorpius can learn to actually speak it."
"I just don't want it to get harder on her," Dudley was saying, drawing Harry back to the conversation. "She doesn't really have any friends, and I'm afraid that if she really is a witch that won't help her at all. She'll be the odd girl in class and still get picked on."
"Ah." Molly smiled in understanding, reaching over and stroking a soothing hand over Harry's messy black hair. "It's alright to be cautious about these things, dear. It never helped anybody to rush in when they weren't ready. Take your time and be sure you're moving in a direction you're comfortable with," she advised.
"What, Scorpius?" Harry frowned. "Well yeah, he's wonderful. The kids adore him. Ironically enough, him and Albus are almost inseparable-"
Albus leaned against the smooth red door taking deep heaving breaths. His heart was pounding madly in his chest and his stomach was turning sickly in his belly. He'd yelled at his dad in front of tons of people and now he was lost.
Lily gasped in happiness and turned to Harry with eager eyes. "Daddy! Can I have her? She's perfect."
Shrugging, Albus shifted uncomfortably, unwilling to discourage his friend. "You didn't really say anything. It sounded kind of like Lily used to when she was baby and couldn’t talk yet."
By the time he’d gotten control of himself, Harry’s stomached ached from laughing. “Alright,” he wheezed, his free hand pressed to his stomach. “I believe you.”
They were silent for a bit before Draco leaned over and laid his head comfortingly on Harry’s shoulder. “That was nice of him.”
He looked up to see Lily and Rose slump in disappointment and slink away from the old ratty shed at the back of the property.
"I have no earthly idea," Lucius murmured from next to him sounding a little more poised than he had a moment ago, and much more calm. "That should not have happened."
The Minister and his wife found a place with the Lovegoods and Neville; the Grangers and Arthur and Molly seated themselves with Dudley and Marianne, and the rest of the group all laughed and joked while they mixed themselves up. Hagrid had a wrought-iron bench pulled up to a table with Aberforth, McGonagall, Bill and Fleur, while Andromeda sat with Narcissa, Lucius, Charlie, George, and Angelina.
There was Victoire, Dominique, and Louis, Bill and Fleur's children. Then Little Molly and Lucy, Percy and Audrey's girls. And young Fred and Roxanne, George and Angelina's kids. Rose and Hugo, Ron and Hermione's little mischief makers. And, of course, Harry and Ginny's children, James, Albus, Lily, and now Teddy.
Harry just snorted and shook his head. "Your grandmother would have a fit if I let you go home carting a giant boa constrictor."
"Good Lord!" Lucius exclaimed quite uncharacteristically. "You're part owner in Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes? For how long?"
Scorpius, Albus, and Lily rushed after him as he strode in through the open air door and called to a stable manager. Narcissa moved to walk with Lucius while Harry and James followed behind slowly.
"Well, well," he drawled to his empty study, words filled with near malicious amusement. "Draco and Potter, what offspring you have born." He chuckled, kicking his boots up on the corner of his desk and folding his hands behind his head. "What trouble you caused in youth, your children will revisit upon you tenfold. Indeed."
Lily shifted and made a sound in her sleep, drawing Draco's attention down to her. He smiled tenderly as he stroked a hand over her hair. She'd crawled up onto the bench with him not long ago and fallen fast a sleep with her head on his lap. It made Draco feel distinctly warm and loved in an entirely different way than Harry did. He loved it all same.
Cassiopeia de Vil Malfoy sipped her tea in the Manor's solarium and looked around distastefully. She truly did dislike her daughter-in-law.
"No." Draco shook his head. "They were busy stalking that God awful gnome. Why do you let him camp in your yard, anyway?"
“Quite sure, dear.” She smirked at him and released his hand after patting it lightly. “If you can’t find them, come back down and I’ll help you look.”
They sat in silence again, Hermione grasping Draco's hand like a life line, Narcissa comfortingly combing fingers through her hair. Her tears had dried, her sobs quieted, and all that was left was an empty numbness.
Harry hummed inquiringly running his hands up and down Draco's back again not minding his weight one bit.
Harry gave a slightly relieved chuckle. If she wasn't yelling at him yet then she wasn't going to. "Dunno, really. I never really thought about until now." He shrugged, eyes wandering over to watch the children's games just for something to look at other than Molly’s still stunned expression.
Harry smiled at the thought and hoped fervently that he didn't end up making a fool of himself if he broke down in tears at the party. Teddy was very nearly like his first born, it was going to be hard keeping it together at his birthday, but he wouldn't want to actually start blubbering in front of everyone.
Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, aloof, cold, and elegant, were sitting at the table eating breakfast with his children as if they entertained small groups of kids all the time. Lucius was listening attentively to a tale Scorpius was weaving while Albus sat next to him giggling madly. On the other side of the table Narcissa was chatting indulgently with an enthusiastically talkative Lily. Draco was watching it all while munching contentedly on chocolate-chip pancakes.
Harry cupped the sides of his face and brought him back down for another gentler kiss. "Yes," he murmured against Draco's soft lips. "It's absolutely wonderful."
Draco grinned at him. "Your dad just stopped moving and stared at the snake. The whole room was stunned silent. Then Lockhart, the bloody great idiot, steps up and claims he can get rid of it." Draco snorted. "Instead of banishing the thing he kicked it up ten feet in the air, so when it landed hard with a thump it came up hissing and spitting and madder than ever."
George's forwardness seemed to knock the rest of the room out of their trance and soon Draco and Scorpius were inundated with redheads and their spouses. It became painfully clear that the whole of the Weasley clan were obnoxiously friendly and that despite his worries, the two Malfoys could charm just about anyone.
Scorpius heaved a long suffering sigh and turned to his new friend. "Goodnight Albus. I had fun today."
"Definitely not." Harry smiled in a way that Ron had only ever seen him do when speaking of his own children. It was surprising enough for him to almost miss what Harry said next. "Draco's done a better job with Scorpius than Lucius and Narcissa did with him. He's really smart and a bit shy. I think he didn't have many friends before Albus, to tell the truth."
"You're even prettier when you're not glued to your dad." He chuckled at her blush and set her on the floor with her brother and Scorpius. "Now you three run upstairs and play while us adults have a chat, alright. Come and get us in the kitchen if you need anything," he instructed before ushering the children toward the stairs. Grabbing Harry by the arm, Draco dragged him down the hall toward the kitchen.
Harry whistled and looked up at the top of the tapestry realizing, now that he was looking, he could see constellations and recognizable stars in the diamonds’ placement. "This is just- just amazing."
Climbing on the bed, James wriggled under the covers and curled up facing Teddy. "What did they fight about? You didn't come down to dinner."
She pouted a bit before resigning herself to a small garden party. "Oh, alright, Draco. I won't invite anyone else." Narcissa sipped at her tea and pursed her lips in distaste. "What kind of tea is this, Draco? I've never tasted anything so... flavored."
"Hello, Mrs. Malfoy!" He smiled happily, his appearance morphing to match hers, his hair curling at the ends into blond ringlets and his eyes turning pale blue. The effect looked rather comical on him, but Draco couldn't quite laugh. He was worried by his mother acting so odd.
He gave them one last hard look before turning on his heel and striding down the stairs to meet his wife in the breakfast room.
The shuddering, gasping, panting completion had them both seeing sparks and feeling like their muscles were about to leap right out of their skin.
An image of Mrs. Black's portrait and the house-elf heads came to mind. Harry had to admit it was a valid argument.
"I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Ron,” Harry said sincerely. “I just didn't want anyone to know, ’cause your Mum would have been right pissed, then everything happened and it just didn't cross my mind."
Shrugging, James gestured to the one curled around Teddy's wrist. "She said you tasted like colors and the 'time of shedding our skins'. Whatever that means."
Draco lifted his head from Harry’s shoulder and looked at him understandingly. “I feel the same way, Harry. I think every parent does. But going to school, to Hogwarts is a happy thing. They’ll always be your children, Harry. Teddy will always be your son.” He smiled and shrugged then. “Just maybe a little more grown up than you would like.”
Draco frowned. That all sounded very suspect. The memory of their mysteriously broken floo tickled at him and he raised a speculative eyebrow. "What a fortunate coincidence," he commented.
The Manor was different from the others though. It had a Dark side, but it didn’t feel twisted, didn’t feel malignant or malicious, just dark. The Manor had been steeped in love and loyalty and happiness, but had also felt the touch of Death, and torture, and insanity.
Rolling his eyes, Harry ran a hand through his hair. "No, I mean she left me -us. She had a bit of a breakdown and dropped the kids off at their grandparents while I was on assignment for the Ministry. She was in the Virgin Islands when I finally found her.” He took a deep breath. He knew he was on his way to healing, but it was still hard to talk about. “I filed for divorce and she gave me full custody of the kids."
Harry placed a comforting hand on James's shoulder and propelled him forward following close behind. The three of them walked to one of the last stalls and Harry lifted James up and set him on the wooden stepstool beside the gate so he could see into the stall.
Lucius released his hand and turned to regard the chest of drawers curiously. "I can't be quite certain as this piece is far older than any artifact of cursed furniture I've had the pleasure to examine until now, but I think it could be a Capturing Chest."
"I know," he murmured, and he did. "I miss your mother too." Not in the way he should: as a husband should miss his wife. He missed her in the way a father misses the mother of his children. In the way a friend misses a friend. He couldn't help being angry with her for abandoning their children, but he knew there was nothing he could do now.
Lucius studied his son considering. "A tragedy that they should inherit anything from the woman at all."
Narcissa watched the children stuff their faces with a distracted furrow between her brows as she sipped her tea and nibbled delicately at a tea cookie.
Narcissa had decided to have afternoon tea in the garden today. It was a lovely day, all bright sunshine, great golden fluffy clouds, and a nice April breeze. The only thing that would make it more perfect was if Lucius would abandon his study and come sit with her.
Glancing over to see who had popped in, Draco had a fleeting thought that this might become awkward since next to no one even knew he and Harry were friends much less anything more, then his mind went blank in shock. He had a flash of instinct to draw his wand, but he ended up dropping his mixing bowl with a loud crash instead.
"Scorpius," Lucius sighed once the children had finished. "That is not something to be told outside of the family," he reminded the boy, sounding tired. Perhaps he should be thankful he'd only ever had one child, he thought. He wouldn't have been able to survive more than one.
Dudley's eyebrows shot up into his blond hair. "You were actually talking to the bloody snake?" he asked in disbelief. "Can all you wizards do that?
"Ahem," Lucius interrupted before they could start bickering, silently scolding the younger men with a raised eyebrow. He turned back to the papers in his hands. "Mr. Weasley, it says here that your business offers prank and joke items of all types. Confections, toys, clothing accessories, potions, etc. Could you give me a few examples of these products?"
The little elf popped into being directly in front of Lucius and shot discrete unseen glance a Scorpius. "Yes, Master Malfoy?" he squeaked, trying not to sound guilty.
"Oh tosh!" She pinched his side in punishment. "The poor thing was just following along with what Scorpius told him to do. I assume Tipsy was one of the coconspirators as well considering the floors aren't due to be waxed until next month."
Rolling his eyes, Lucius loosened the golden drawstring around the top and shook the bag out. "You live in the Wizarding World, Potter, and you can't guess that not everything is exactly as it seems?" he questioned condescendingly.
Albus was brought up loved and cared for with a ready eagerness to like everybody. Scorpius was not an over indulged spoilt brat and had been taught worlds better manners than Draco had been.
Malfoy Manor would always be his home, the place he came back to, the place that stayed with him while he was gone, but Grimmauld, Harry’s Grimmauld, held a special place in his heart now.
"Now, normally," she continued, "this wouldn't be a problem seeing as the children have been instructed to keep away from them, but with all the other little ones running through the gardens this afternoon, it just wouldn't be possible to keep an eye on all of them at once."
Molly’s eyes darted from the box to Draco and a warm happy smile split her kindly face. "Oh, thank you, dear! That's very sweet. What is it?" she ask as she shoved the platter into Harry's hands and snatched the box from Draco faster than he could protest.
"Salad, tomato bisque, and rosemary roasted chicken breast. I made a strudel for desert, so you better eat some. You know how Hermione complains about the kids' sugar intake." Ron gave his best friend a stern scowl before dipping his finger into the soup pot, sticking it in his mouth, frowning to himself for a moment then snagging a pinch of basil and dropping it in.
Chuckling dryly to himself, Harry got to his feet and headed toward the kitchen and the source of the noise. There were only about three people who knew or even used his phone number; Hermione, Mr. and Mrs. Granger, and-
Harry blushed. "I didn't really think about that," he admitted. "Draco just feels right. Not like Ginny, but better. Kind of like we'd just been hitting it an inch or two off the mark until we became friends and everything just slotted into place."
"I've got to head back, Kingsley. I'm sorry we couldn't have seen each other under better circumstances."
And this was the scene Draco and Harry walked in on when they finally dragged themselves away from the comfort of Draco's bed and the pleasure of each other's arms. The kids were laughing themselves silly while Narcissa scowled at her wary looking husband.
Harry tilted his head in negation. "You'd be surprised," he replied. "Hermione didn't take it well, but Ron seemed okay."
She giggled at him and ducked her head bashfully pulling Harry's hand in front of her to hide her reddening face. "Hello, Mr. Malfoy."
Lowering his head a bit and looking up through his bangs, Harry bit his lip. "So, I should go check them out, then?" he asked needlessly. If Lucius's scolding hadn't convinced him, he would have done it anyway... Eventually, he admitted, grimacing inwardly.
Perhaps, but what’s done is done. Now, older and wiser, Harry and Draco were finally getting the chance to be friends.
Rolling over and dislodging the sleeping snakes, Teddy curled up facing the window. He remembered what Harry had said about his grandma and grandpa not approving of his dad when his parents got married. Was that true? It must be. Werewolves were feared these days. Before and during the war they were even more so. What had it been like for his parents to get married and have him in the middle of a war?
There was spark growing inside Harry. A spark of anticipation and eagerness. This was interesting. It was intriguing and different and challenging. It was something he would have to learn and continually work at.
"Really?" Ron asked genuinely concerned. He could see the evidence of "getting better", but Harry's wellbeing by looks alone could be scarily deceptive.
Blowing out a stressed breath, Harry combed his fingers through his bangs and tilted his head back. "Great," he muttered staring blankly up at the ceiling. "Just great."
James caught Teddy’s attention, then caught Albus's and meaningfully closed the book in front of him.
Harry had realized two things that day. There was life after Ginny's abandonment, and Draco Malfoy was a vastly different person than he was in school. The first made him feel relieved, and the second made him weirdly fascinated.
"I understood that you wanted some space, Potter, but I didn't realize space would translate to complete and total avoidance," Draco finally said coolly.
This was the scene Draco and Harry opened the door to; their kids jumping up and down screaming their heads off with smiles a mile wide. They shared a knowing look.
"Well, then they had better hurry, hadn't they," Cassiopeia simpered lightly. "Draco is not getting any younger. Should they wish to further their lines they had better start soon."
"Well, well, well," he started mockingly. "What have we here? Why, I think it's five young children attempting to peek into places they don’t belong."
Harry stepped up and smiled disarmingly at them. "Here, watch," he said before he summoned Fritz up to them. "Would you bring us a glass of pumpkin juice and a glass of firewhisky on the rocks?" He glanced back over at his very pregnant cousin then added. "A chair as well, please."
He flicked his eyes away awkwardly. "Well, where would you like to meet, Luna?" he asked as naturally as possible.
"Oh good." Draco smiled and swallowed the tasty morsel he'd nicked. He smoothed a hand down his casual dress robes and started back into the house to meet them.
"Nothing." Harry shrugged. "Lily's snake stowed away when we left this afternoon then made a getaway. Lily chased after her and finally caught up with silly thing right outside your shop. The kids wanted to come in, so we did," he obliviously explained the simple story.
Teddy rolled his eyes again. "You just don't like it ’cause you know if you go in there you'll have to read something. Besides, it's supposed to smell like parchment, that's what books are made of."
Harry raised his eyebrow amused and nodded. "Alright, but remember that not everyone can do magic and you might not be able to make anything happen with my wand." When he received a nod in understanding he went through the routine of instructing Eddy how to hold the wand and pronounce the spell.
"I know about the prejudices and the fears, but I can't beleive that Andromeda would think I could so oblivious to it," he muttered. "I would sooner rip out my heart than willingly subject any child to that sort of unpleasantness."
"Nope, I want to see if you all can do magic yourselves." Harry grinned and forged on despite Chrissy's skeptical little frown and Eddy's dubious snort.
She flashed him a rueful smile as she made it to floo. "Will you tell Teddy that I'll- that I'll be visiting soon?"
Kingsley Shacklebolt sighed resigned and nodded. "And I can't try and convince you otherwise, can I?" he asked perfunctorily.
What he felt with Draco, what he’s seen in the other man’s eyes when they’d gazed at each other that morning. There would be no takebacks. If they started this they’d be playing for keeps. Harry didn’t know if he could handle that kind of permanency again.
Narcissa leaned over and kissed him on the cheek before returning to her own breakfast. Consequently, that made him feel much better and his menacing scowl softened to a moue of a mild annoyance.
Suddenly the frown cleared and Potter met his gaze again, regarding him with a calculating, speculative air. Lucius raised his eyebrow at him until he finally opened his mouth to speak.
"You're really not scared of us?" Lily sounded like she would break down in tears as well if Draco said he was.
Draco gave a playful sigh, "Oh, very well then. If you insist." And lifted the boy up under the arms, settling him sideways in his lap so they could face each other.
The sight of him, so different, yet very much the same, had brought back long buried feelings that Draco almost didn’t even remember having. He’d always reluctantly found Harry Potter attractive and now, grown and matured as he was, even more so. Even with tired smudges under his eyes and the lost, confused, pale unhappiness plastered across his face.
The fire raced around the room lighting the contents brightly. Harry tentatively stepped through the door and looked around. It didn't seem all that different from his Potter vault except for a few distinguishing pieces. The massive, jewel inlaid Black crest propped up in the corner for one.
Stunned, Draco couldn't do anything, but reach out and take the offered hand in a firm shake. "N-nice to meet you too, William, but I'm not sure that's exactly true."
There was some disbelief and exclamations of frustration, but sure enough, after nearly all of the remaining guestrooms were checked, they found all the furniture covered in white drop-cloths levitating above shiny, wet, freshly waxed floors.
Soon, the children were all seated in the breakfast room with Lucius and Narcissa, piling their plates high with sausages, waffles, pancakes, and eggs. It turns out plotting the downfall of their fathers works up an appetite.
A tall brunette woman dressed in an elegant -expensive- floor length robes with an empire waistline and a brocade emerald green traveling cloak stood in the doorway. She carried a long black cane with a cut crystal topper and a sterling silver foot. Her face was masked in a cold indifference that reminded everyone in the room of a younger, crueler Lucius.
Audrey nodded thoughtfully before answering. "The research that's been conducted has shown that most wizards have a pretty average sperm count and that the problems, the miscarriages occur partway through the first trimester in women and matris. The embryo will attach to the uterine wall and begin to grow then for no apparent reason detach itself and begin to disintegrate."
"What do you mean I don't have the authority?!" Harry raged indignantly at the response he’d gotten. "I'm Harry Fucking Potter, you twat! Don't you dare think for one second I won't march through the floo right now and-"
Turning, Lucius saw that the portly balding man had stepped up next to him. He eyed him up and down, just barely keeping his upper lip from curling in a sneer.
His father gave him a meaningful look. Rolling his eyes, Draco grabbed a napkin and took hold of the nearest child's face vigorously scrubbing at the chocolate. His father had never deigned to wipe his face when he was a child. Draco didn't know why he'd ever expected his father to wipe any other child’s.
"Oh, I don't know," Draco drawled sarcastically. "Maybe perfectly good floos malfunctioning, or house-elves waxing floors three weeks before they’re due, or Lily's conveniently stowaway snake leading you straight to my shop?"
Draco waved him off with a smirk. "Don't worry about it, kid. Just one more happy customer. Scorpius, why don't you take Albus to the backroom and stuff him with those cookies your Grandmama forced on us this morning?"
Harry deflated and blushed almost as red as his son. The correct phrase was a traditional serpentine response to when another snake inquired after your health. Perfectly innocent until you missed one hiss and turned it into a mostly garbled sexual proposition.
Harry ignored them. "Your mum didn't leave because she wanted to, Lily." He wished fervently he didn't have to try and explain this. “She left because she’s-”
Scorpius curled around his belly as he overflowed with mirth. "It was hilarious!" he exclaimed as he leaned against Albus for support.
Yes, well Lily had never been particularly good about remembering when to discuss something and when not to if she got excited. Really, Harry was surprised he hadn't had to explain himself to Ron and Hermione weeks ago. Ah, well, all good things must come to an end.
Harry frowned and took the letter from his son's hands reading through it once more. "I don't know, Teddy. We can owl Professor McGonagall and ask her. I'm sure she'd let you since Ruby is a mail bird and Nova and Stella are pretty self sufficient. Maybe we can convince her the snakes are for your supplementary learning."
"No, it's a very rare gift," Harry told them, pride coloring his voice. "Those that can are called Metamorphmagus. They're born with it. Teddy's mother was one as well. He inherited it from her."
It took them nearly an hour to figure out how to get the family tapestry down and stowed away without compromising it in anyway, but eventually they unstuck it from the wall and carefully rolled it up like a rug, slipping it into the little bottomless velvet bag gently. They moved onto the books and journals, Lucius confirming they were all curse free, packing them all in a second bag.
Albus shrugged at her a half apologetic smile on his face. "Moon," he answered quietly. "Tal and the others call me Moon."
Draco watched her as she looked around the room with wide curious eyes taking in the antique furniture, the enchanted clock, and the ornate wall paper.
"Well, how much could it take?" James huffed. "All the times we got to go to the Manor, Dad and Draco always sat and talked together. They were always laughing and smiling."
"Yeah," Harry breathed turning slightly wild eyes on her. "It's not just Draco either. It's the whole bloody family. Scorpius is such a great kid, I could so easily love him like I love James and Albus and Lily and Teddy." He tugged at his hair in frustration.
Harry hoped he could bring the kids along to play with Scorpius while he was busy talking money and Wheezes prank research. He’d been going on business leaving them at home and he really didn't want to do that if he didn’t have to.
Teddy was quiet for a time, then mumbled, "I hope so, too. I like the Malfoys and I want her to like them, too. It would suck if she hates them when Harry and Draco get married."
Taken aback by his forwardness, it took Draco a moment to answer without sounding affronted. Surely this redhead realized that he and Harry were in a relationship.
A gust of air rushed out of Narcissa and she looked like she might cry. "That is very true, my dear. How is your grandmother, Teddy?" She pulled herself together quickly though her eyes still glimmered.
Lucius raised a wry eyebrow, his eyes too knowing for Harry's comfort. "I can imagine," he drawled. "However, you will be passing these heirlooms down to your children and therefore must be apprised of exactly what they are," he told him, nonnegotiable.
Harry got a bashful look on his face. “I know. I just love the Manor.” He never thought he would ever say that considering what he went through and witnessed there during the war, but there is was.
Lucius snorted and leaned back in his chair, a dry smirk in his lips. "Very well versed," he confirmed, unrepentantly. "Malfoys have been a family with strong ties to the Dark Arts for centuries. It was only natural for me to begin learning at an early age," he informed with an unapologetic glint in his cool gray eyes.
Draco shook his head in amusement and strode over to his mother, popping another cracker into his mouth. "Don't you think you're working them a little hard, Mother? The party doesn't start for another few hours."
He had never been quite this happy in his life, he thought. This was even better than when his dad bought him his first practice broom and let him ride it all afternoon. Scorpius didn't have many friends. For some reason it was hard for him to make them. They were either mean to him because he didn't act like a little heathen, as his grandfather would say, or he couldn't relate to them at all. But Albus was different.
"Harry Potter's children," she started after consuming a cookie, "have been claimed by Draco." She looked her daughter-in-law in the eyes. "Do tell."
“She won’t be,” Draco assured him and leaned over to rest his chin on Harry’s shoulder. “If she is anything like Mother, she’ll have sat in her house for a few days brooding and pouting then she would have started to look at things again and tried to see them differently. Andromeda will come around.”
"He fits there," Draco protested, distracted as his hand began stroking over Harry's side of its own accord. "He's a natural Slytherin."
Clearing his throat, Harry stepped toward the opposite side of the bed from Draco. "Yeah, thanks. Your bathroom is amazing."
Teddy smiled at her and shrugged. "Can I please stay with Harry, Grandma?" He morphed into his natural amber eyes he inherited from his father, his hair turning into the shockingly bright pink that his mother liked so much. He knew Andromeda couldn't resist for too long when he looked like that.
