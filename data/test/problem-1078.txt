He went into the sleeping chambers for the house elves and lightly woke one of them up.
"And look I'm sorry for what I said Harry, I'm just really protective of my sister. I don't want her to get hurt" Ron apologized. Harry nodded. "It's not that I don't like her, because I do, but"
Before he knew it the cabinet was fixed, the door was back in place, and the scratches on the sides had gone back to their original state.
Harry spent the entire holiday thinking of Draco. He couldn't understand why Draco would lie to him.
I'm getting a lot of ppl sending me ss of my spelling mistakes. Yes I know they are there. Will I fix them...maybe. This ain't a story I'm mainly working on I have three books that have it full attention that's in my drafts I try and edit tho one as good as I can I usually write around 3-4 am I'm sorry they are there
He had spent the night in his bathroom contemplating taking his life. The thoughts of Harry's hurt face and how much he betrayed him couldn't leave his memories.
"Give me Harry Potter and all women, man and child will stay alive" he finished with a dark cackle. His words struck them like knives.
Harry laid awake that night feeling more empty than the nights before.
"Yes, master Malfoy?" The sleepy elf stirred. "I-I need you to get this letter to someone." He whispered.
His mother stepped forward. "Draco" she whispered and held out her hand for him. He looked at Her then everyone else on the side he stood at. They looked at him like he could save them.
She moved out of the way the person was in view and Draco Malfoy stared at Harry. "H-hi" Draco whispered.
He looked down at his hand and saw himself looking down through it. He looked back and forth through both mirrors and huffed. "Who gave you this mirror?" Harry spat.
Dobby appeared behind them and held out the wand he acquired out towards Bellatrix. "I've come to save my friends" He yelled.
"Hermione watch out" Draco yelled. He threw a spell behind her and one of the men fell backwards.
Draco turned to Harry and watched his facial expressions. Draco started it laugh and Harry looked up at him with furrowed brows.
while"
"How dare you stand where he stood after you killed him. In cold blood. A man who trusted you, then you murder him." Harry yelled.
She nodded and proceeded to ask him her question. "When you're with Draco, do you see a future, would you even want or think a future to happen?"
"Harry, look up there" Hermione pointed as they were watching the wards she had put up yesterday.
Harry sighed. She smiled. "I'm your best friend Harry, I've known since fourth year" she joked.
Love isn't simple but it isn't hard to understand. I knew I was in love the moment I met you, even though back then we couldn't call it love, but I knew without a doubt.
Meanwhile, Harry sat outside the Weasley burrow the family as it burned. Burned because of Draco's aunt and the rest of the skin Deatheaters.
The two boys have wanted nothing and everything to do with each other, all at once.
"I don't want the story to end"
"My darling, you didn't tell me you were friends with Potter." She whispered and kissed his neck, then his cheeks.
Draco smiled and nodded. "Well...without being too gross and Lovey, I think you would make a-a great father" He mumbled. Harry smiled and kissed Draco's cheek.
Sincerely yours, Malfoy.
"Malfoy, were you hoping it would be Ron?" Harry questioned with a smirk. The two boys beside Draco looked between them with furrowed brows. Draco shifted uncomfortably and tried to change the subject. "Well, we'll turn you in now" Draco spat. Harry rolled his eyes and moved closer. "Are you sure you to turn me in? I mean you are so close,"
He pointed the wand at the door and yelled the mending spell. He held on for longer this time. He thought of the strong feelings he had. Towards this whole thing, his family, Harry Potter.
Ron went out to see Hermione.
Harry smiled to himself and closed his eyes. "The night we had our first bond. The night I knew I loved him." He explained.
She looked over at Harry and laughed. Harry laughed with her and brought her into an embrace. "Don't worry He does" Harry whispered in her ear.
"I have to find Hermione and Ron," Harry said frantically. Draco called him by putting both of his hands on the side of his face. He held his face so Harry was only looking into his eyes. "I'll find them and tell them to meet you. You have something to destroy! Right?" Draco said knowingly.
"No- not really"
Draco sat up and let Harry place one of the plates on his lap. "I wasn't sure how to use your mini kitchen so I went down to the school kitchens and used the stoves there" he explained.
"Did he know?"
They stayed silent for a few moments, just taking in each other's presents. Both feeling the comfort they needed for other people.
Draco sighed and wiped his tears. He turned around towards Harry and shrugged. "So what if I did?" He spat. Harry slowly shook his head and looked away.
"You've been making that face since first year" he pointed.
Loving someone frees you from any chains of pain; you feel a greater sense of freedom when committed to that one person. Because you're not concentrating on finding the one! because you've already found them.
"It's been weeks malfoy" Harry spat as they walked into the quidditch tent. "Yea? Days turn into weeks. That's how life works"
"Mm," Draco moaned. "That's really good" he protested. Harry smiled and took a bite of his toast.
"Darling"
"We're you watching me and Snape?" Draco questioned. Harry sighed and then nodded. Draco shook his head, grabbed Harry's chin, then crashed their lips together.
"Malfoy" He yelled as Draco ran down a flight of stairs. He turned his head towards Harry and he saw a little smirk creep on Dracos lips. "Potter"
"Did you guys destroy the cup?" He asked. They both nodded. He looked down and saw their intertwined hands and smiled. "Seamus owes me five galleons, and Ginny owes me two"
Draco thought back on his own wise words. 'War brings people together
After the night Harry and Draco shared they spent as much time with each other as possible before the winter holiday. Tomorrow will be the last day before the train comes.
"K-keep going" Draco yelled with his last bit of energy. "I-ill be ok, run Harry"
"He looks almost Ill" Hermione muttered as Draco came into the great hall and sat at the Slytherin table. Ron turned around and joined in on staring at Malfoy. Draco looked up at the trio with furrowed brows. They all turned away.
Ron and Hermione had sat down next to him and just held each other.
Harry walked into the flooded bathroom and looked around for Draco. He heard light sobbing.
He stood up and shook his head. "Leave? Just walk away and leave" he laughed. He ran his hands through his head and took deep breaths. "I can't fucking leave Potter. You think I would be here if I could" he yelled.
"Why would we care?" Ron spat. "Don't Ronald!" Hermione warned. Ron furrowed his brows. "Don't wish sickness on Malfoy, even though he's vile". Harry nodded in agreement. Ron looked at Harry and titled his head towards Hermione. Harry rolled his eyes and turned back to look at the daily prophet.
Harry sat up in his chair and smiled to himself. He's never told anyone their full story. He wild rewind the best moments in his head. Slowly though, over the years, they faded.
She stood up and shook her head. "I refuse to hurt you. More than you already are." She cried. "My beautiful boy. I know it hurts now, but there is still tomorrow and after the war ends-" Draco cut her off.
Harry went towards the astronomy tower where Draco asked to meet him every Thursday afternoon.
Harry closed his eyes, shook his head and stepped forward.
They walked into the great hall, heads down, hearts beating.
Harry stood closer to Ron and stood straight. "Go on Ron, finish that sentence."
"It's about to be winter holiday m, we won't see each other during that time, and you think my parents would ever let that happen, you and I hang out let alone them know what hanging out for us is like. Plus you would be dead the moment they see you." He yelled.
Draco took a sharp turn down the next hallway and disappeared. Harry walked so fast it was almost a sprint. As he turned Draco grabbed him by the arms and threw him against the wall.
"So you haven't talked to him about your future ?" Hermione asked. Harry wanted to keep those memories to himself, they seemed like the only thing he had left of Draco right now.
Hermione walked up to him and brought him into an embrace. He holds her tightly as if she would let go at any sign of weakness.
Harry hadn't said a word to anyone, Ron, Hermione and Ginny, even after the hug she gave him. He had nothing to say. He told McGonagall who it was and that's it. All that needed to be said.
Harry and Draco grabbed him warning him if he were to storm up there he would get hurt or get Hermione hurt more.
As they were about the apparate out of the manor Harry held out his hand for Draco. Draco looked back and forth from him and his family.
"Sorry we took so long, we had to find a place where I could leave and not be tracked.
"Is there no one here with information?" He yelled again this time hitting the table. Draco's father slowly raised his hand. Voldemort turned to him and let him speak.
"Why are you here again, I've got this" Draco spat and held out his wand. He muttered the mending spell and tried to hold the spell for as long as he physically could.
"He ready Draco, prepare your self for the worst." Draco nodded and took out his wand. He closed the door to the cabinet and locked it. He was about to mutter the words until Snape stood in front of him.
He stood up and looked around him. "Hello?" He yelled. He banged on the walls and screamed for help.
"This can't happen anymore Harry- p-please understand" he murmured and turned back towards the view.
He had no care to hear their plans to kill the wizarding world.
"When I tell you to leave, I mean it" He spat in Harry's face. "Draco, why were you crying?" Harry asked softly. Draco took a slight step back to Harry's words. He had never heard Harry call him Draco before. Both of their gazes shifted from their eyes to their lips.
"How are-" Draco started but Harry cut him off. "How could you? How could you leave me there? How could you run off after what you did" Harry whispered trying to hold in tears.
"It's not like I'm making a move on Ginny Ron, she's a friend I'm treating her like I would treat anyone I love. With respect" said Harry.
"Remus said this letter took some time getting to you Harry. He thinks you should read it alone" She mumbled. Harry nodded and went back to the tent.
She explained to him what they had to do while Ron was listening from the other room. He felt bitter about this entire thing and this was the cherry on top.
Harry burst out laughing while Hermione felt sick to her stomach. Her faces dropped and she turned to leave the common room.
Draco slowly opened his eyes and found himself in a dark room with one low lit candle hanging fork the Ceiling.
Draco rushed out of the great hall when he saw Harry talking to Katie.
Draco looked up and looked at Harry through the mirror. "What?" He spat. "I-I want to ask. Did you curse Her? Did you poison Ron?" He muttered.
Draco didn't move. He slowly breathed in and out and kept his gaze in front of him.
"Harry, can I ask you something," Hermione spoke up as Harry had just closed his eyes for the night.
Harry and Dumbledore landed back in the astronomy tower. Harry smiled up at Dumbledore. Harry praised the old man. For anything.
After several minutes they heard footsteps approach them. Ron and Harry hid on opposite sides of the door so the unknown person couldn't see them.
Harry stood up and slowly walked over to them. He looked at them with sorrow. He couldn't do anything but stare. A voice was heard across the hall. His voice.
Draco, Blaise, Pansy and Goyal tried to climb up a tower of desks and other stuff that had been stored in here.
"Baby"
Snape took out his wand and pointed it at Harry. Harry did the same. They stood there for a moment before Snape tried to fire. McGonagall stood in front of them and blocked his spell from Harry.
Theo stood behind them a little and lightly placed a finger over his lips, letting them know he's not with them.
After several minutes of cooing the baby and congratulating Tonks. Lupin finally spoke up. "We've decided-" he gulped. "We've decided to make Harry The Godfather" he finished proudly.
Harry ran after him and chased him up the grand staircase.
Albus smiles and nods. He left his fathers office and heads down towards the floor network.
"Why can't you just walk away from this. Join us, we'll help you" Harry insisted. Draco started to lightly laugh.
"Blaise let me in" he smiled. Draco smirked. Harry moved closer and sat on the end of Draco's bed. He tapped his fingers on his knee as he thought of something to say.
"Well, we'll leave you to talk," Hermione said and grabbed Ron's arm. The boys didn't move. Just looked at each other.
Aberforth shrugged. "Not sure then, I just remember the man looking fairly similar to Sirius. Maybe I was wrong" The man stood up and started to walk out of the room.
Draco ran to his room to grab his wand. He got his jacket on and left through the flew network. He landed in some old store. Outside was a small dark lit alleyway.
"I didn't suggest running. I suggested saving yourself. Saving us. Let everyone else fight, or they can run too. Run and- yes run and hide. It may not be noble but at least they'll be alive. What about teddy? Want him to grow up without a mom...or a dad?" Draco explained.
"How am I supposed to go in there?" Draco asked as he started to have a panic attack. "Hey- Hey breathe," Harry said and placed his hands on the sides of Draco's face.
She left him to help others and he sat alone. Alone with his thoughts.
Harry spent closer. "Why can't we change it, and fight together? I don't understand" Harry asked. Draco shook his head. "You won't understand."
Harry got his suit on and did his hair. He walked down the stairs of the burrow and entered the kitchen.
It was the same night they had talked about everything. Got to really know each other.
After the school said their goodbyes to their beloved headmaster, everyone went to pack their bags to go home early.
As they all walked down the steps and saw all the bodies, blood and broken bits from the castle their hearts wept so much pain as been shed over everyone here tonight.
Everyone was silent for a moment. "Then we die together," Lupin said and they all left.
Harry cupped Draco's face with his palms. "I know, we both know what we've signed up for. We are both prepared now. We know the cost"
He cut his arms for betraying Harry, he slashed his torso for leaving him there. Draco felt nothing but disappointed in himself.
He held her in an embrace as the family figured out what to do.
It feels as though you are at peace,  calm, you're centred. You feel a stronger sense of security and feeling this was such a surprise to me, because before you I felt I was lacking something important in my life. It was you, I was lacking our connection.
Draco left with his family whole no one else paid attention. His parents aparated home while Draco and Astoria aparated on top of a hill overlooking Hogwarts.
He would use his son to hurt the boy he loves? How did he even know? Malfoy thought to himself.
Harry walked over to her and held her in an embrace. "Is my father alright?" She whispered. Harry nodded and she sighed in relief.
Draco felt so guilty that his blood could hurt Harry like this. He partially blamed himself, but then he remembered he would give up anyone's life for Harry. Even though Harry would probably protest against it.
He let his blanket go from his tight grip. He put his slippers on and held out his wand. "Lumos" he whispered and opened his bedroom door.
"Is that how it works?" Harry yelled and shoved Draco backwards. "You kiss me, then act like nothing happened" he shoved him again. "How. Dare. You. You really are the stuck up piece of shit we always thought you were" Harry started to walk away but Draco grabbed his arm.
Harry searched for the crown under all the rummage. He heard faint voices coming from the entrance and he drew his wand. He sighed in relief when he saw Ron and Hermione.
Moments after footsteps came from behind them. Draco turned first and quickly stood.
Harry told Hermione and Ron that he had feelings for someone they wouldn't approve of. He hadn't said who. But he wanted to see what they would say.
"Sorry about Dobby" Draco whispered to Harry. Harry lightly smiled and nodded.
"Does it hurt like this for you too?" Hermione asked. Harry turned to her with furrowed brows. "When you see Draco with all those girls" she added.
He looked down at his own hand and pulled off one of his rings. "You said we could get married. Take this, my mother gave it to me, it's yours now" Draco insisted.
Draco stood tall and moved closer to Ron. "And who just saved your ass Weasel" Draco snapped. Harry huffed and slapped their chests. "Would you both shut the fuck up and move"
"I love you Potter" he whispered.
"Did you hear that Katie Bell is out of the hospital?" Hermione muttered. Harry looked up at her.
What the hell was I even going to say to him? Harry thought to himself.
"Draco?" Harry whispered.
What would they do him? He thought to himself. This question clouding his entire vision. What would his future look like if he died? It's a future he didn't what to live in.
"What are we Draco?" Harry whispered. Draco shook his head. "Don't ruin it Harry" he whispered back. Harry nodded and rested his head on Draco's shoulder.
"It was a drunken night, this was before we had kissed or even told each other of our affection. We both were feeling terrible about the world around us. We had run into each other on the astronomy tower and spent the entire night together" He explained.
"You love him" Hermione finished for him. Harry's eyes lit up for a moment. He lightly nodded and held his head in his palms.
"And cooking" Harry added.
'Harry, I need to see you. Please'
Draco walked down an empty hallway towards the room of requirement and tried at the wardrobe again just like the day before, and the day before that.
They landed in front of the burrow and celebrated their small victory. Mrs Weasley ran outside and hugged Fred, she told him about George and they all ran inside.
Harry smiled as he walked upwards. "I love you More Malfoy" He yelled back.
Harry thought of the same things. But he was too focused on being a hero to focus on his feelings. But Draco was too stubborn to tell Harry how he felt anyway...so they would only end in ruin.
Draco ran down towards the great hall. As he passed the widows he saw the barrier-breaking. He gulped and continued forward.
"Hmm," Harry thought. "I cook," he said happily. Draco looked over at him with a homily shocked expression. "Woah, the chosen one cooks? Who would have guessed" he laughed.
He rolled his eyes and grabbed the paper. He read it and sat up quickly. The two on the floor looked up at him with furrowed brows.
Draco slowly opened his eyes and had a wide grin on his face. Harry smiled and kissed Dracos forehead. "Hey Love, sleep well?" He asked. Draco nodded and stretched.
"Do we still think Malfoy's up to something, for the dark lord?" Ron asked. "I think so, but should I confront him about it?" Harry questioned. Hermione rolled her eyes "you still think his a-" she stopped and got closer to the boys. "Death eater?"
Dear Harry,
Along with him all the Gryffindors and a few other houses stood in front of Harry. Even Blaise, Theo and Daphne Greengrass stood between him and the other Slytherins.
Oh but I have, I have Harry. Love isn't something made up, or a fairytale you hear before your sleep. It's real and it feels amazing.
"You're just like him" he mumbled. Harry slowly stood and put his hands in his pockets. "Like who, Ron? Please share with the tent"
"Did you do it?" She whispered. He sighed and nodded. "I gave him the ring and said the goodbyes I needed to."
"What about having kids?" Harry asked after moments of silence. Draco sighed and looked over at him. "Never really thought about it, I mean I have always had to provide an heir but, being a parent never really went through my mind" He explained.
He furrowed his brows and started to sprint after him. "Malfoy!" He yelled again.
"Do it" Draco sneered. Crabbe took the first punch and slammed it right on Harry's jaw. Then after Goyle hit him four times in the gut. Harry's knees caved in and he fell to the ground.
And they did, they made it through the last gate and Draco's vision when pitch black.
"Well, I know you fairly well now, and if you're anything like me I know that you would fight to the death for the man you love. So get your stuff and let's go" She said with a smile at the end.
"Do we still think Malfoy's up to something, for the dark lord?" Ron asked. "I think so, but should I confront him about it?" Harry questioned. Hermione rolled her eyes "you still think his a-" she stopped and got closer to the boys. "Death eater?"
As they claimed Harry, Hermione, Ron and Theo passed them.
"Because I said so" Harry chirped and quickly got up.
"We need to find that boy" The dark lord yelled. His scream caused Draco to flinch. He held his hands together tightly under the table. He was sure that blood was starting to break through the skin from the pressure of his nails.
Harry sits back in his desk chair. He lightly smiled and nodded. "A line time ago I did. They both moved on with their lives. I'm sure they are living their own dreams now."
"Anything by Radko, his witch and wolf series was good," Draco answered. Harry laughed. "I knew you were a romance buff"  Draco laughed and playfully hit Harry's arm.
Dumbledore lightly laughed. "Sometimes darkness is the most beautiful thing"
He sits in that for a moment. He laughs and quickly stands up. He grabbed his coat and heads out the door.
"Watch it yourself, Malfoy," Harry barked back in the same angry tone.
Harry set down the latter and sighed. He sighed and he broke into a million pieces. He screamed into his pillow. Hermione and Ron ran into the tent to see what was wrong.
He couldn't he thought, he ain't Harry. He ain't their saviour.
"No- Let her go now" Ron begged. "Don't touch her"
Ron and Harry waited patiently. Hermione had been gone for a good thirty minutes and they started to worry.
He fixed his coat jacket and made his way downstairs. His parents were sitting in the dining room and eating their breakfast. They are their breakfast like there wasn't a war going on and people weren't being murdered.
"Not tonight." Draco nodded and kissed his cheek. Harry smiled and held Dracos face close to his.
"Just what- run away? Absolutely not. This is much my war as it is yours. I have to stay Draco" Harry explained.
Harry heard Draco's footsteps. His heart hurt knowing he would leave the right side just because he thought he died. He felt betrayed.
Harry stood in front of the three and nodded his head. Hermione started to tear up and held him in an embrace. "I know Harry. I know" she whispered.
You thought you knew them but in reality, you knew the idea of them.
"We need your help sir" Hermione spoke. He turned to her and raised his brows. "We need to get in the castle. We think there's something in there that could help us defeat Voldemort."
Albus nodded. "Did you know them, dad? The two boys"
Or at least Ron, Hermione and Harry did.
Harry and Ron were thrown onto the dungeons ground and the gate was closed behind them. "Hermione" Ron yelled.
He sat back down and held his knees to his chest. His worst fear was smaller rooms. His father used this room when he was younger to put Draco in when he wouldn't listen. The only company he had in the room was his old house elf.
Harry rested his head on Draco's forehead and kissed the tip of his nose.
The trio apparated to Hogsmeade and quickly hid from the sound that came with their arrival.
Ron looked over to Harry then Hermione. "I just knew mate. You're my friend. Plus Hermione was fangirling over it" He answered.
Harry sighed and turned his body towards him. "What do you think of Hermione's find, Ron?" He replied in a snarky tone. Ron lightly laughed with a disgusting expression.
Hermione's eyes started to sting with tears and Ton couldn't take his eyes off her while she did it. Harry smiled and Lupin and patted him on the back. Draco stayed by the door unsure if he could move closer.
"Wait? So does he hate the boy or not?"
"I'm so in love with you Harry. This is fucking insane. Why did you have to spell me hmm?" He joked. Harry rested his head on Draco's. "I spelled you? I think it's the other way around"
After he grabbed a cup of tea a downed it Ginny walked into the room with a beautiful dress on.
"Why don't you tell him you'll be with him anyway, tell him you would give it your all just to be with him because he makes you so happy even though he can be so dumb and not use his brain half the time yet your still best friends with him and want him in your life more than ever right now and he's just hurting you by kissing other girls because you thought he felt the same way" she rambled and tried to calm her breathing.
But he needed it... "it's alright, I'm ok, thank you though Gin," He said with a smile. She nodded and linked their arms together.
Harry smirks and Grabs his things.
Draco's mind wouldn't end with the thought of Harry. He couldn't focus on his task, on his schoolwork, even on himself. He's not been able to focus on himself.
"Well, I wasn't expecting to have to go find another god damn thing that's lost. You would think Dumbledore left you a how you save the world parchment" He snapped harshly. His words hitting Harry like a sharp knife.
Draco sighed into Harry's touch. "I love you- I love you so much" Harry frantically whispered. Draco nodded and kissed his lips.
Harry woke up the next day feeling a little better. The pain of the war started to affect everyone. It became a lot more real for Harry after fourth year. It wasn't new to him, losing people he loved.
"I say we sleep on it for tonight and we'll help you more in the morning. I'm zonked." Ron suggested. They all nodded and went to sleep.
Harry has been gone for more than an hour the closer the night came the more Draco worried. Their arguments have never lasted this long. Harry refused to speak with Draco, look at him. Maybe even forget he was there.
"Mione, what if he needs me" He pleaded. She shook her head. "I'm not gonna risk your life Harry, we've come this far. I won't let you throw it all away"
Draco laughed and stood in front of Harry. "Nice Try Parkinson's" He spat.
He grabbed his bag and stood up. "Thanks for the lesson, I better get him before mom yells at me. I start next week so she wants me to get good sleep or whatever" Albus complains.
They saw Harry laying there with the letter tightly in his hands. He screamed and cried into his pillow like he had been cursed with a pain worse than death.
He jumped back down and grabbed another drink. He laughed as he saw Harry's confused face, the liquid went over his whole face.
Hermione put her hand on his. "It will be ok Harry, I'm sure Dumbledore will figure something out. Good always wins" she said in a reassuring tone. Harry tried to give a light smile.
Dracos eyes whet wide and he laughed. "I'm serious" Harry protested and sat up. He grabbed Dracos hands and held them close to his chest. "I'm serious Draco, Marry me. After all, this is over I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Only you"
Hermione tried to fight their hold on her but they fought back harder. "Be careful with her" Ron yelled. The men laughed and held her tighter.
Draco looked down from everyone's gaze and sighed. "It's settled then, Draco will get Harry and bring him here. We can't risk anyone here going near wherever he is. We might get ambushed" Voldemort explained.
"If anyone...knows the whereabouts, of Potter, they shall come to me straight away. If you don't....you shall see punishment as....equally guilty."
Hermione scoffed and hit his chest. "Was not" Ron looked at her knowingly and she blushed. Harry laughed and gave her a light tap on the back.
Harry shook his head. "What good is living knowing you ran? What good is it running and leaving everyone else for dead? We have to try Malfoy. We have to" Harry yelled.
"Then tell me"
The house-elf sat up and took the paper in his hand. "To whom?"
Without any more hesitation, he grabbed Harry's hand and left with them.
In reality Harry was mentally and emotionally breaking. He missed Draco more than he had missed the parents he never knew. He missed the way he made him feel. Harry was so in love with him. He knew that, but he also knew they wouldn't be together after this war ended.
And now...they were fixed from their flaws and without each other.
Draco slowly pulled away and held Harry's face. "I want you, Harry, you"
"Don't worry you'll understand at the end"
Harry nodded and zipped her dress up. She slowly turned around and Ginny stared into his eyes. Both of their breaths started to slow down. Ginny moved closer and Harry fought the urge to pull away.
Harry laid awake on another restless night, just looking up and the ceiling. This time Draco was with him. Harry and Draco grabbed one of the rooms upstairs so they could sleep together.
Harry faintly knocks on Dracos door. Draco looks up from his desk and slightly smiles. "How did you get in the Slytherin common room" he laughs.
Harry's eyes filled with joy. He jumped up and hugged Lupin. "I feel so honoured. I mean really that's- that's amazing. I promise I'll try to be the best." He mumbled.
He looked around and his eyes met with Draco's. Draco couldn't look at him, his guilt flooded him. Harry turned his stare to the girl next to him, clinging onto him like a small bear who was desperate for their mother.
"I've missed you" Harry whispered. Draco nodded and kissed the top of his head. Harry slowly pulled away and kissed Draco. Draco deepens their kiss. He held onto it desperately as if he wouldn't ever be able to kiss him again. Like his lips, were saying goodbye without saying a word.
"Someone take the Pansy and the rest of Slytherin house down to the dungeons," McGonagall said allowed.
She smiled and made her way towards him. "Help me with the zip please?" She asked and turned around. He nodded and moved her hair out of the way.
They hardly had anything yet had everything, all at once.
Goyal laughed. "And you weren't in Potters? Always second. I'm surprised he didn't even get the girl"
After the pain stopped everyone stood still and quiet, just staring at Harry.
He held Astoria's hand and fought himself. Fought the urge to go after Harry. Fought the urge to cry like the little boy he's been all year.
Draco saddled Harry's lap and their kiss deepened. "I love you so much Potter" He whispered to him. Harry smiled and kissed him again.
Draco shook his head and walked towards the door. He turned back to Harry and sighed. "You know why Harry...you've known for a
Harry pulled away from her and gave her an apoplectic smile. "I-" Ginny cut him off.
Hermione and Ron thanked him and ran out the door. "Watch yourself Malfoy" Ron yelled in a half caring tone.
Harry took it and kissed Draco's hand.
All sounds around Harry were now silent. He felt Voldemort's pain and to Harry, it felt like a small victory.
Theo and Hermione tried to burn it out but it was already too much.
"You know, if you want the job...it's all yours if you'd love to watch every. Single. Person. You. Love. Die. Then go ahead, have at it. You have your family Ron, you make sure they are safe twenty-four seven. I only have one person to make sure is safe. The only person I haven't lost yet." Harry retorted.
Losing someone you hardly knew is just as hard as losing someone you did.
He couldn't take this anymore. He wanted to make himself feel better. But he didn't know how, he wishes he could forget everything that's happened and just be with him. Lay with him. Kiss him one last time. One last I love you.
"I know" Draco whispered to himself.
He used the feeling of hatred for the boy. Oh, how he hated Harry Potter.
Harry stands up and pushes Draco onto the ground. Draco jumps back up and punches Harrys jaw. Which then leads to Harry punching Draco's nose. That's honestly revenge for what Draco did on the train. "You piece of Gryffindor shit" Draco bellows and runs down the hall.
Harry sighed and relaxed up a bit.
"What's your favourite memory with him?" Hermione asked one of the many questions circling her head. Coming up with things to try and make Harry feel better just seemed not the right thing to do, she thought she could help by letting him remember the better times.
Draco shook his head and hit Harry's chest. "You think my name funny? What kind of name is Harriet Potter?" He laughed.
They flew up high in hopes to grab all of the others. As they all got to the top desk Goyal, barely hanging on, started to slip. "I'm not dying! Not alone" He yelled. He grabbed onto the only person closest.
"Help!" He yelled again. "Someone help me"
The men took the trio through the gates and down a long walkway with tall edges towering above them.
Harry quietly sighed and held onto Ginny's hand tightly.
I've had a strong understanding of what love is since I was a young child, I had the understanding it wasn't real, my father and mother loved each other to the extent that it was necessary. They loved each other for the job of providing an heir, me. I laughed at anyone who said they felt the feeling. I joked that it wasn't real and I'd never feel it.
"Look," Harry said and gave them the paper. Hermione shook her head. "Harry, this is probably a trap"
Draco leaned over to kiss him and Harry happily gave him one back.
Draco stood there with furrowed brows.
Draco hugged Harry tighter and lightly cried into his shoulder. Harry pulled away and smiled at him. As Harry turned to walk away Draco grabbed his arm.
"There's nothing to talk about! Nothing happened!" He said a rushed over to Harry.
Draco huffed and left the room. He closed the door behind him and sighed. Before he made it up the stairs he saw movement to his side.
Draco didn't know why he would find himself staring at the boy who rejected him. But he did. And he didn't mind the view.
"You're Dumbledores brother...aren't you?" Harry asked. The man nodded and handed them warm cups of some liquid. He then brought out a plate of bread with some butter next to it.
Albus looks up at his father's expression. He smiled at him knowingly. "Well, it's never too late to go after true dreams. Right, dad?" He smiled.
As much as being the third wheel felt awkward, at least he wasn't alone.
"H-Harry" Draco Malfoy was heard whispering. Harry turned his head around the Corner and Draco sighed when he saw him.
"Stop doing whatever you're doing with my sister, I know she likes you, but you and me both know who you really have feelings for" he spat. Harry furrowed his brows.
Ron took in every moment of glory with pride. Everyone was chanting his name and all his dreams were coming true.
Harry tried to fire a spell at Snape but he threw one back. Snape had something but Harry blocked it out, he laid on the group with tears in his eyes and pain running through his body and mind.
He slid down the door and let the last do his tears fall.
They all went to sleep in a lounge room with two couches and a piano. Harry and Hermione are on each couch and Ron on the floor between them.
Draco sighed. "Want to talk about it?" Harry shook his head.
"Wait, sorry to interrupt again but, how will this help me?"
"Anything good in there?" Hermione asked. Harry sighed and shook his head. "Death....a lot of death" He whispered.
Draco ran into a corridor that Harry knew to be the Slytherin common room entryway. "Potter" Draco whispered and the door closed behind him.
Harry started to walk away but Draco grabbed his arm. He pulled him in for an embrace. Their hug lasted a while, Draco he'd Harry so tightly Harry feared for oxygen loss.
Draco kept up his act of not being a death eater trying to murder Dumbledore, and let in a bunch of death eaters.
"Please mother. I beg you. Make my pain go away mom...please" he begged again.
"Ready?" Ron asked glumly. Harry looked out his window, grabbed his bag and nodded. They made their way down the hall with the rest of the Gryffindors and some Ravenclaws who just made their way from the common room.
He heard light sobs coming from the sinks.
His mother rolled her eyes and placed them back on her book. She hadn't read the papers in a few years ever since Voldemort's return. She hated hearing terrible news and that's all they wrote about.
The bathroom door swung open and Narcissa looked back and forth from Draco's wand and his bloody figure.
Harry hadn't moved or spoken. He still had that burning sensation in the pit of his stomach. He was so angry at Malfoy, but he had missed him so much. He didn't know what to do.
Hermione gulped and looked between the two. "So I'm not sure what you're trying to get at, you have what you need. What's your problem. Is the tent not to your liking, is the vacation destination too cold for you?-" Ron interrupts him.
"Harry?" Draco whispered. "Hmm?"
Harry stopped talking to him. Stopped looking at him. Stopped thinking about him. The only thing on his mind was defeating Voldemort and his lessons with Dumbledore.
Harry stood there unsure what to say next. Harry sighed and started to walk out of the bathroom.
They walked into the sitting room and she set down her bags. Her parents went to meet his parents in the dining room while they talked.
"M-my son, he- he is close with the boy" Malfoy Whispered. Draco looked at him with shock.
She walked away and grabbed her book. "I know how to destroy the Horcrux." She yelled with excitement. His face lit up and he ran over to her. "Great, how!"
"Are you ready?" She asked after a silence. "Ready to marry you even though we both know we love two different people. Ready to finally make our disgusting families round. Yes, I'm ready" He whispered and closed his eyes.
Draco stood abruptly and Pansy almost fell over. "Don't you understand, if he wins there won't be a happily ever after. And even if there was why would spend it with you." He spat.
"Well we don't know for sure," he said. She stood up and looked at him. "Exactly, we don't. For all, we know they are aware of his feelings for you, and using him to get to you" She reasoned.
As they walked the trio into the mansion the smell of...death hit their senses.
He sighed into her neck and held her tighter. He had felt the need to cry for days. So he did. He cried in Ginny Weasley's arms, and she was completely fine with that. She had always loved him. Especially his love for others. She knew but she hadn't admitted it to herself.
"I think that's you Draco" Harry laughed.
"You're in love with someone aren't you?" She asked him. The light that would leave his eyes whenever someone talked about harming Harry brought her suspicions. She knew and she lived for it. "I wish it could work out for us. You know, get our happy ending" she smiled.
Present Day: 19 Years Later
"Always so worried about others Potter" Draco joked. Harry smiled and held onto Draco's torso tighter. Draco rested his head on top of Harry's, his right hand on his back and the other on the side of his head. They stayed like this for hours. Not even to move from the pain in their legs.
Draco shook his head and turned away. He stopped laughing after a few seconds and sighed. "Do you have to fight this Harry, we could just-" he paused.
But as he grew up he understood they were hatred because he loved him and knew he couldn't have him.
"Let's get some rest guys, it's been a long damn day and I'm tired," Ron said as they sat in the black family dining room.
"He looks almost Ill" Hermione muttered as Draco came into the great hall and sat at the Slytherin table. Ron turned around and joined in on staring at Malfoy. Draco looked up at the trio with furrowed brows. They all turned away.
A single tear rolled down his face as Goyle kicked his stomach repeatedly, Crabbe punched his face. Draco had said something to the guys and they stopped. Harry couldn't see their faces and could barely hear them.
Harry sat in the great hall with Hermione and Ron. They ate their food and had a small conversation.
"Anything good in there?" Hermione asked. Harry sighed and shook his head. "Death....a lot of death" He whispered.
Harry furrowed his brows. "We can't-" Draco muttered. Harry tried to walk closer to Draco but he walked farther away.
Harry let go of Hermione and walked over to Draco. He hugged him and whispered in his ear. "Thank you for being my first real love"
"To the gods and Merlin himself," Draco said with a weird smirk on his face and a hand in the air.
"Sorry headmaster, but there's a problem with your plan, you forgot about security" Harry spat.
"Can you tell me what department Draco Malfoy works in?"
He saw her say at the bottom of the stairs sniffing her tears away. Small yellow birds flew around her and made the faintest little sounds.
Harry stood up next to them all and tried to help comfort, Blaise. "Blaise I know it hurts now, but we have to keep going. I'm sorry about Theo. There isn't much we can do now, nothing but move forward" She reassured.
Before Harry fully descended upstairs Draco yelled after him. "I love you, Potter"
Theos body disappeared I'm the fire along with Goyal. Blaise balling his eyes out couldn't hand on the ledge any longer. Draco grabbed him and threw him in the back of Ron's broom. Blaise held on so tightly to Ron not conscious of how hard he was actually holding him.
Draco sighed, wiped his tears and walked fast down the corridor. Harry did his best to follow him and stay unnoticed.
Draco hurried to fix the cabinet. The more and more he tried the more frustrating it got. Snape had to step in and help him. Even though he hated his presence.
But only one of them would never act upon his feelings.
"FUCK ME" He yelled and sat back on the couch he had kicked earlier.
Ron rolled his eyes and Hermione huffed. "You took bets?" Ron asked. Harry nodded.
"Well that's your name, isn't it? Or is it Derecho, or maybe..." Harry placed his finger on his chin like he was thinking. "Drinco" He laughed.
He had quickly forgotten about his feelings and pushed Harry right back. As they shoved each tiver Hermione yelled for them to stop. She got in between them and slapped Ron across the face. "Leave. Go. Get out, if you're going to act this way get the hell out" she snapped. Ron looked done at her with anger, he took the necklace off, threw it and left the tent.
"Malfoy" He yelled as Draco ran down a flight of stairs. He turned his head towards Harry and he saw a little smirk creep on Dracos lips. "Potter"
Draco looked at Harry then Snape and wanted to run into Harry's arms. He took a small step forward but Bellatrix grabbed him and took him into the woods with her.
Draco sat in his bedroom staring at the ceiling. He watched the shadows of the night sky take over his room. He hadn't moved in a few days.
"B-but father" Draco whispered. Lucius held his wand under the table at Draco. It pierced his stomach causing him to wince in pain. "You will not speak" he spat.
Harry looked up and saw a dark brown owl. He jumped up from his spot and ushered the owl down towards them.
Draco nodded and thanked him for the food. Harry watched him and waited for him to bite his famous breakfast omelette bowl. As he did Harry watched Draco's lips intensely.
"Draco?" He heard his mother recall out. He jumped up to the door and smacked his hand against it. "Mother please, please let me out of here. I beg you" he screamed.
Draco looked around as he smelt a delicious meal. Harry jumped off the bed and brought over two plates and a cup of orange juice.
"Oh and I'm keeping this Slytherin sweater by the way" Harry muttered. Draco laughed. "And what made you think I'm going to let you keep it"
She lightly laughs and whipped away the last of her tears. "The way you watched him instead of your dance partner. The looks you gave him when he moved closer to you" she told.
But they were just in his head he thought. There wasn't a future for them...nothing besides fighting against each other and whoever comes out alive is the winner.
"My baby. My beautiful boy" Narcissa cried and held onto Draco's head as she kissed his forehead.
"It was a gift...-" Harry cut him off. "Well it wasn't theirs to give"
Neither of them wanted to go ahead of themselves so they cuddled the rest of the night.
He sighed in relief to know he was still ok and went against his wishes to come here. He wanted him safe but he wanted to say goodbye to him, even though Harry still had hoped they would win and everyone would get their happy ending!
"Hermione" Harry yelled for his friend. Faint whimpers left Hermione's mouth as the women held her face tightly.
Harry and Draco spent the entire night together. They talked and talked and got to know each other...more of each other than most people knew...
He handed Harry a silver ring that had a green gem on it with gold chips in the green. It had been a ring Harry always saw him wear. Along with his family ring and Slytherin one.
Harry knew what Draco was. But he hasn't told a soul. And he never will.
"What the Hell Potter?" He spat. Harry tried to catch his breath. "I- are- are you alright?" Harry asked. Draco looked at him, then turned his gaze down the hallway. He looked in both directions and saw no one. He grabbed Harry's hand and took him into a fairly normal-sized broom closet with one slim window that overlooked the black lake.
"T-thank you sir" Hermione stuttered. The man nodded and ushered them further into the house. Ron couldn't help but stare. The man nodded and introduced himself. "I'm Aberforth"
She kissed his lips and he let her. Let all the pain of Draco Malfoy fly past him. She moved her hands to his cheeks and he pulled her closer to him. Trying to act as if he was madly in love with her since they were children, since the moment he saw hi- her.
After a few moments of silence, Draco finally said something...the three words Harry would never have expected Draco Malfoy to say to him.
His sound made it back to him and Blaise sobs were now hear again. Harry kicked the crown into the room of requirement and the doors closed with it.
He let them do it, but Harry didn't stop them. What else would Draco do so people didn't suspect his feelings for the chosen one? What lengths would he reach to?
The light at the end of the tunnel for them was coming though, maybe not soon but it was there.
He turned to him, looked him in the eyes and said goodbye.
All their eyes went wide. A deep scream was heard through the entire room. A scream of pain, the worse taping in the world. No one knew who screamed until they saw who Goyal took down with him.
Harry nodded and let go of him. "Tell them to go to the seventh floor. Draco nodded and let him go as well.
She got her stuff ready and apparated out of the room.
"I'll run down to the kitchens for the food" Harry whispered to Ron, Seamus, and the other boys in the dorm. "Take your cloak" Ron mutters. Harry nodded and grabbed the cloak of invisibility from his trunk.
Three other students screamed with him.
Harry walked through the portrait hole and put the cloak over him. He walked down the hallways and towards the kitchens. Careful not to get caught by the school prefects he slowly opens the kitchens door and walks inside.
Draco nodded and closed his eyes for a moment. "Ok but hear me out. All this guy has caused you is pain. Why fight him and risk dying for everyone else to feel that pain.-" Harry cut him off again.
How he made him feel...he never once thought his feelings for Harry would go this far. He never would admit it when he was younger. Ever. The feelings were hatred. That's all.
Harry secretly followed Snape and Draco in the corridor. Draco claimed to have 'crashed' the party but Harry knew something else was going on.
"Leave him Potter...for both of your sakes", Snape whispered and left the same way.
"What we'll live happily ever after. If we win he dies. Then I'll be completely broken inside. I'll be dead. So broken I'll take my own life like you fear just to be with him again. And that's if I could be after with him after death. Who knows where I'll end up in the afterlife"
"So knowing he helped, what's with you two now?" Ron asked. Harry shrugged. "I haven't spoken to him. I want to but the opportunity hasn't presented itself yet." He explained. They nodded.
As he ran down the steps he ran right into Draco's chest. Harry looked at him and he was relieved to see him. Draco grabbed him and pulled him in for an embrace. As they did they got a couple of weird looks but no one was really paying attention.
Voldemort gave his great speech and scared everyone to their core. Everyone except Draco. Draco wasn't scared. He was disgusted.
Draco noticed Harry was doing the same so he pressed his wand harder on Harry's neck. Harry slowly placed a hand on Draco's arm. "What happened" He whispered. Dracos gaze moved from Harrys eyes to his hand, then to his eyes, then Harry's lips. He didn't know if he wanted to kill harry..... or kiss him.
"Well... take him away," Pansy said and pointed towards Harry. Other students said 'yea' in agreement.
Harry rolled his eyes. "It's been weeks and we haven't talked about it"
Ron rolled his eyes and shook his head. "Your little boyfriend. You act just like him. All entitled, rude, not everything is about you. This is bigger than you" he spat. Harry sighed.
Harry tried his best to hold back tears. "I keep telling you I'm done Malfoy, I sit here every day wondering when you'll leave me. We've spent the past few weeks together, and they were so amazing. What changed? Did I do something? Why do you never talk to me? I'm begging you, for once in your life, tell me how you feel" He exclaimed.
Everyone started to get ready for Bill and Fleur's wedding. Harry's thoughts were clouded all day, wondering how they could have a wedding during a time like this. Having all this death around them and still find a way to be happy.
Draco helped Pansy up and got himself up last. He held onto Harry's Torso tightly as they made their way out of there. Harry held onto the crown as tightly as he could.
Harry nodded and got up. "Where are you going, mate?" Ron asked. "To confront him" Harry storm after the boy who was already leaving the great hall.
Draco's father left him in the darkroom for a week. It was the worst week of Draco's life.
How he strutted around like a king. How he had friends who cared for him. His looks.
Harry looked away and blushed. Draco moved closer and held Harry's hands with his own. "I'm sorry, that shit gets so crazy. And we makeup and break up so many times. If I could change the way things were, I would. But I can't" he explained.
"My love"
Draco sat eagerly on his bed. He waited and waited. His house-elf appeared before him and he shot up. "Any news?" He whispered.
"Malfoy?" Harry whispered. Draco looked up from the sink and stared at Harry through the mirror. "what do you want? Just leave me be potter" Draco spat and looked back down. "Are- are you alright... is there someone I ca-" Draco cut off harry. "I said to leave" He yelled quite loudly causing Harry to jump a little. "I'm just trying to help if someone offer-" Harry was cut off once again. Draco ran over to Harry and pinned him against the wall while keeping his wand at Harry's neck.
Draco walked up the stairs and waited a moment before entering the room. He saw Hermione laying on the floor the words 'mudblood' carved into her. Draco's eyes gave her an apologetic look and he kneeled down towards her face.
He was watching the blonde boy that he hated with every bone in his body. Well, every bone except one. Harry noticed his own gaze would shift to Draco's quite often this year. He noticed how he looked more sad and broken every time a day would pass. He would sometimes even disappear and not return for hours.
Harry fake laughed. "Oh Ahah- so funny Harriet is my show name of course. Harry is just a facade" He smirked.
'it's never too late to go after true dreams'
Just the special embrace you share with your lover makes you fight through any pain...
"Well it's only-" Harry cut him off and say up. "Ok, what?" He whispered a little too harshly. "Sorry"
He saw Harry stand up. He saw him fight with Voldemort. He saw it all.
Draco sighed and turned on his side. "Fine, but I won't be there to watch you die. I won't watch as the man I love with my entire heart gives his life for everyone else"
So much had happened...so much he couldn't figure out which was real and which was not.
Ron shook his head disapprovingly and walked away. Harry lightly laughed and fought the urge to punch a dresser.
The pain ran through his entire body. From his toes to his head, his blood felt like it was boiling. He couldn't hear Hermione yell for him, nor could he hear Harry beg for his father to stop.
Harry nodded and smiled. Draco lifted himself and kissed Harry's lips.
As Draco walked towards the room he had spent more time in this year than his bedroom. He contemplated running away. Refusing the dark lord a way in, but he knew it would make things worse.
Draco always slept on Harry's stomach just because of his fear of Harry leaving again.
Harry broke away and rested his forehead on Draco's to catch his breath. They closed their eyes and stood like this for a moment. To breathe it all in. They kiss, and the truth that they would soon have to face.
He took a breathe before he was about to talk.
Harry still hadn't healed from the school year before. The pain in his heart was still there.
"You what" His father yelled. "You've- Done what! You will ruin us" he spat.
"Hey, Katie," Harry said. Katie looked up at Harry and lightly smiled. She got up and they moved to the side so they could talk.
Harry tried to get the sword in the water. Ron pulls him out and apologizes.
Snape flew out of the room by aparation and the student cheered.
"No today you will be meeting Astoria" My father chimed in.
Draco had an actual good time talking to her and they talked for hours.
The men threw them on the wooden floor in front of everyone. Harry looked up and saw the Malfoy's looking down at them.
Harry walked up to him and placed his hand on Draco's back. Draco flinched and slowly turned his head towards the raven-haired boy was confused by his anger that could be felt from all angles of the room.
Draco wasn't directly looking at Harry but he knew he was watching. Draco would watch him in the corner of his eye like clockwork.
Harry stopped mid spell and tried to run for Draco. Ron stopped him and blasted someone backwards who was coming after them.
Harry had been at his worst for the week Draco was gone from him. He felt his pain, he didn't know how but he did.
Everyone hyped him up and told him they all betted he would lose us the house cup this year.
Thank you so much for reading my story!!! Story dedication is on Wattpad for those who would like to see it!! Hope you enjoyed!
Harry sighed and slouched down. He turned to Draco one last time before turning and shutting his eyes.
He saw Hermione and that towards her. "Hermione, Harry's looking for you both. He said go to the seventh floor"
"Enough, all of you. What do you three want" Hermione Spoke loudly.
The trio walked back to the common room to celebrate Ron's quidditch win.
They moved another to their second location after Ron had left. Harry was up the entire night before watching to make sure no one was around and that Hermione could sleep ok. He was so worried for her. She barely ate, barely slept. She cried most of the night, regretting everything she said to him. Wishing she hadn't slapped him.
"Where is Harry?" McGonagall asked Draco. "He went up to see Snape's memories." She nodded and walked closer to the boy. She lifted up a washrag and cleaned off a bloody cut he had gotten when some of the roof fell onto him.
He sat down beside them and grabbed an apple. "So what's the plan for today? Kill a muggle and then have some family bonding time?" Draco sneered.
Harry undressed and put some soft pants on. He left his shirt off, climbed into bed and turned off his light.
Being with you Harry has made me feel more at home than I ever have. I couldn't put into words how much I'm in love with you. How much I wish I could be in your arms.
He walked down his holes dark lit hallway and made his way downstairs.
"B-because I love you" she whimpered. Draco rolled his eyes and sighed through his teeth. "No, you love my dick and money" he spat and walked away.
"Hey Harry can I speak with you" Ron snapped at Harry. Harry nodded and told Ginny not to wait up for him.
"Baby, tell me why? Why would you hurt yourself? Please" she cried out to him. He couldn't form any words. Just the faint noise of his sobs was heard.
