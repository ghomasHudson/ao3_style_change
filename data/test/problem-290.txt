Even so, Draco felt only a slight, little annoyance, and the absolute desire to be opened and fucked by something bigger.
“Oh don't be stupid! Your breasts will still grow, now that the ritual that suppressed your nature has been lifted! This way you will get it faster and make your master happy. Listen to me, you don't want to get into trouble with that man! "
Draco knew these things, as he had expected his parents to start talking about a marriage alliance to improve their social status.
"Yes, sir. As I told you she is recalcitrant. I assume you spoke to Mr. Malfoy about the personal history of this Omega. "
Draco found that his voice was back, though he wasn't sure he could use it without a desperate moan coming out, so he just nodded.
Draco wasn't exactly excited about it, but he knew that being a Malfoy involved a sacrifice, in times like these, so he said he was willing to accept the deals his father would make for him.
Draco saw the man holding a small sparkling sapphire with tweezers, and then he felt himself grabbing his member.
“And the fuck! There is no such thing as a bitch who can masturbate and cum like a man! No, put him one of those rings that keep him from coming. I want all the accessories adorned with sapphires and I also put one in the slit on his cock, one of the magical ones that allows him to piss without taking it off, of course. Since we're on the subject of jewelry, pierce his ears and put some rings on him, let's say a dozen. "
Draco was motionless, still completely unprepared after the sight of Tulip who, evidently, was Pansy's brother; a brother whose existence he had never known about ... and who had never even attended Hogwarts, since, by his own admission, at the age of eleven he had already been sold the first time.
“You are one of these particular individuals, an Omega. Now, if you have followed closely, you will realize that there are, statistically, about five out of five hundred individuals who can conceive offspring only with an Omega, while there is only one Omega for the same amount of people born. "
Nott pushed hard and without regard, slipping a finger inside him, and then starting to move it slowly.
But they were socially outcasts and nobody wanted to have any kind of relationship with them anymore.
He heard the man fumbling behind him but Draco didn't move, then something cold was brought close to his boiling opening.
Draco really had to and so he moved, even though he felt his legs shake slightly and even if the tiles under his feet were cold. Once in the bathroom he noticed that there was no door and that the healer had followed him.
The strange expressions on the faces of his parents, when they had greeted him on his way out for medical check-ups ... the strange change of subject when talking about marriage alliances in public ...
“Your nipples are very sensitive, suitable for breastfeeding. The previous procedure meant that your breasts did not develop but, if this were not the case, you would now have  very feminine breast. "
Draco wanted to cover his ears and not hear her, because the insane creature caused him a sudden panic.
Draco got up and ran to the bathroom, hoping to relieve stomach pain by evacuating, and was relieved when he realized that healer Smith had not followed him this time.
The door to the room was locked but not locked and he, with a little effort, managed to open it by turning his back to him and laboriously lowering the handle.
As bad as he was and could not do anything to improve the situation, he did not want to die to end it all. He wanted to live, he wanted to be open, fucked, swollen with semen.
“And now drink the potion, like a good guy. You'll see that afterwards everything will be much more beautiful! "
The thought made him feel very alone, but at the same time a rampant hatred had grown in his chest at the thought of his parents.
“Oh, that's the effect of the potion. Your reproductive organs are getting back to work after years of inactivity. It will be painful, in fact. " The healer said flatly, before ordering "go back over there now."
The man slid him to the ground with bad grace, and Draco ended up with his wet ass on the floor, still breathing heavily, and with his eyes fixed on the pool between his legs.
It was no longer just desire: it seemed that molten metal had been poured into his guts, and his body was burning.
Once there, in the coolness of the marble floor on his heated skin, Draco sighed with relief and the man said:
“Maybe you haven't got it right yet, bitch. You're in heat, and the only thing that will make you feel good is my cock swelling into a big knot in your ass, filling you with cum until it comes out of your mouth, and getting you pregnant like the whore you are. "
Draco wished he could turn his head, because the healer's expression seemed all too pleased and he didn't want to keep seeing his grin.
Draco, believing that the preliminary exams were finished anyway, started to get dressed but realized that the clothes were gone. He sighed to himself.
"Here. This is pretty much all that buyers can do to you. If anyone tries to do anything else, he will be stopped by an attendant. "
Draco stopped and watched as the man called out a large box, which landed on his knees and opened, making the raised lid hide its contents from Draco.
Unfortunately, the Alpha didn't seem so eager to fuck him, after all, and Draco felt the mattress sag near his face.
Healer Smith got to his feet and intentionally grabbed Draco by the hair and rubbed him against his groin. "Well. I will leave you a little longer like this, so that you become familiar with the position, then I will release you and let you rest. We will continue tomorrow with the other details you need to know. "
Since I didn't have time to post these past months, now I will post another chapter. I didn't have time to control the chapter for mistakes, so I will beta read it when I have some time.
Draco leaned on his heels and spread his thighs, feeling his ass dripping on the cold floor, against which he tried to rub it to cool his desire, while his hands went to his hard and forced member, and began to rub it vigorously.
It was humiliating to know that soon people would come in and look at him, touched and evaluate him as an animal, but that thought at least dispelled, for the moment, the fear of the unknown, of what would happen next ...
Draco promptly executed. It seemed to him that he had done nothing else all morning but at least, this time, the Alpha was about to put something in it, and he would not just look at it.
The man ignored him, turned him around and started massaging him again with the fresh ointment, which looked like a blessing on his hot skin.
They arrived in an elegant dining room, with huge French windows that opened onto a well-tended and sun-drenched garden, and the man sat down at the table while Draco remained undecided at the foot of the chair.
The first changes were painful: perhaps not the growth of his hair, which merely gave him a slight tingle, but his lips and jaw ached, and tore out more than a scream.
The healer sat in the chair by the side of the bed and Draco considered whether she could do something ... try ... what? It had just been made clear to him that he was a prisoner ... no worse, he was a slave ...
He remained motionless, panting for a moment, and then his head cleared a little, even though the heat, which he felt everywhere, and his desire, had not subsided in the least.
He was sure that seeing things written in black on white would only worsen his anxiety. At the moment everything worried and terrified him but his worst thoughts were those concerning his parents, and which did not give him peace. He remembered his mother and he sitting by the fireplace unwrapping presents on his birthday, or his father teaching him to use a broom ... how could his parents want to sell him? Had it always been a fiction? Was it the fake love he thought they felt for him?
If, in a moment of clarity, Draco would have thought that this was yet another humiliation, in that instant the thought did not even touch him, and he dropped to the ground, raising his face towards the man, with a vague plea inscribed in his features.
The man snorted and bent down, grabbing his long hair and dragging him up. He immediately opened his mouth, sure it was the right thing to do.
“I'll come tomorrow, and I'll give you another orgasm. But no fucking shit for my unruly bitch. You do not deserve it."
We exit the building together. Still not a word between us. I can see him waiting across the street, waving at you with a coffee in either hand and the biggest smile on his face. I look at you again and you’re already looking back at me. Maybe you never stopped.
Even though the girls had only spent a handful of days growing up together, playing whenever Lily was in England and Uncle Ron was responsible for everyone, no one had really expected them to bond quite like this. But then they started Hogwarts together and even though they were in different houses – Lily in Hufflepuff and Victoire in Slytherin – they were assigned a number of class projects together their first couple of years. By the time they were thirteen, they were practically inseparable. They had even taken to spending school breaks together a majority of the time. Even though their parents had made their peace more than a decade before, it had still been rather awkward for them at first. Lily and Victoire wouldn’t say their parents were exactly friends, even after all this time, but Lily’s father had put them on the guest list before she had. It was a moment she had celebrated over with Victoire.
I also pulled some lines directly from the musical Mamma Mia! so if you recognized them, you aren't crazy. I hope you liked this as much as I enjoyed writing it. Onto the next chapter to finish it ASAP for you! Thank you again for bearing with me.
“Last round, friends,” Neville said far louder than was necessary as he set the tray of drinks on the table. Harry muttered a thanks as he reached for his last bottle of beer. He hadn’t finished the one in front of him, but he switched it out for the colder drink instead. And as he settled back down, he felt Malfoy’s heeled foot brush against his leg again. Except this time, Malfoy wasn’t moving it away.
“She’s a good kid. Never met her, but I’ve heard all about her from Vic. From what I know, Draco did a good job raising her by himself. Or he got really lucky.” Charlie laughed at his own joke.
“Just wait,” Parkinson practically sing-songed. Not a moment later, Malfoy reappeared at the top of the stairs and everyone fell quiet.
“It is always a pleasure meeting one of Lily’s beautiful friends,” Nico purred. Daphne threw her head back and laughed.
“Is who out there?” Draco asked, sticking his chin out and narrowing his eyes. Daphne just rolled her eyes.
In case you don’t speak Greek, “ Kefáli tou Drákou” is poorly translated Greek meaning “head of the dragon.” The Latin, “caput draconis,” was the very first password to the Gryffindor common room. Please leave a round of applause to my beta for that wonderful idea!
“Good morning, Auntie Daph,” Lily greeted with a smile, and then waved to Vic beside her. “You remember Vic.”
“I just thought it might be a nice surprise,” Lily continued, and Harry looked at her as though she had grown two more heads.
Kalokairi, Greece. He dropped his hands to the desk to look at the location on the invitation again. There was more information in the envelope he left to the side, but he didn’t need it. He knew exactly how to find the little magical island off the coast of Naxos in the South Aegean. The memories of the quaint little island alone made it tempting to accept the invite. If he had received it, surely he was welcome? Surely Malfoy wouldn’t chase him right back to the continent? It was a public island. Even without the invitation, he had a right to be there. But was that really how he wanted to see Malfoy after all these years?
“You mean you could use a dragon tamer,” Pansy teased and Daphne turned red, but didn’t deny it. Draco smiled at his friends, relaxing now that the topic had changed.
“You’re home early,” he said, moving forward to greet her with a hug and a kiss. Hermione beamed at him, leaning against him for just a moment before she remembered
“I absolutely did. He was always with this guy here,” Harry pointed up at Draco with his thumb, unsure what the boy called him.
“So who are they then? When do they come? What can we do?” Teddy asked as they began to calm down. Lily looked at them both with such fondness.
“So what’s this Lavender was telling me about Lily playing Mamma Mia?” Greg changed the topic instead. Draco groaned and finally turned away from the door.
for Draco. But Draco was his best man; Lily had merely been a “junior groomsman,” Draco would always remind Greg. If you had told Draco fifteen years ago that he would be working happily alongside Lavender Brown, let alone best man at her wedding to his mate Greg, he would have died laughing from the lack of air. As it happened, on one of Greg’s trips back to the continent, he had somehow ended up having coffee with the blonde werewolf. And then dinner. And then drinks. And before Draco knew it, Greg was sending love letters almost daily. Draco had told him at the time that it was absolutely sickening, but he had written to Pansy and Daphne about how cute it all actually was.
"You don't know?" asked the healer before continuing. “No, I guess not. It works like this: many purebloods are not particularly fertile and struggle to conceive heirs. This is why many make use of potions which, however, have some side effects. In the past, it was believed that there was a possibility that the child, conceived under the effect of these potions, was completely sterile, but the number of cases was about one in a hundred and therefore many were willing to take risks. "
Draco did it without any fear and, a moment later, he found himself kneaded from head to toe. His eyes searched frantically for those of the healer Smith, fearing that the next spells could be painful, and that for this he had been immobilized.
The tone was that of someone who was talking to a capricious child, or a puppy, and Draco gritted his teeth and raised his head. If he wanted, he would force him, but he wouldn't do anything of his own free will. He wanted it to be clear that, whether straight or not, whatever happened to him, he would never, ever agree.
The boy smiled quietly and nodded and started talking as Draco noticed that he could easily pass for Pansy's younger sister.
That night Draco hadn't slept and the next morning he was like a rag, and a bad sense of panic gripped him as the feeling of helplessness continually brought tears to his eyes.
“The potions you have taken will take effect in a couple of days and then you and two other Omega will be introduced to the Alphas eager to buy you. This is the position you will take during the presentation, which will give the interested parties a good view of your ass. "
The thought made him feel even worse, until the last chilling truth completely stunned him: he would have been bought, mounted and impregnated.
His body, adorned with rings and sparkling sapphires, screamed opulence and wealth, but at the same time unquestionably relegated him to the status of an object to be displayed.
The fact that the man spoke so detached about his family, about him, about his life ... Draco couldn't even stop crying and now the tears were running down his lips to his still wide open mouth.
He screamed as the flesh lifted and filled, and the skin stretched and expanded. The pain was severe and overwhelmed even the denial that Draco felt. For a moment he didn't care, he just needed the pain to stop.
With all that in his head, scared and helpless, when he heard the door open that morning, he almost screamed.
Draco felt his body obey but that didn't stop him from shaking. Although the healer had said it would be a relief for him to lose his head, Draco wasn't in the least certain, and he found himself praying that it wouldn't happen. They crossed a corridor to a side room, and the healer opened the door. On the bed Draco saw a relaxed woman who was clearly masturbating while moaning incessantly. Draco looked away but healer Smith did not seem of the same opinion.
“You see, these serve several things: not only will they hold the milk when you have it, but they will always make the tips of your nipples much more sensitive. Let me fix the other one too. " He said moving to the other breast before starting to rub the tips of Draco's nipples insistently, forced into the rings.
"This will ease the pain a little, but obviously it's not what you need. What do you need?" the man asked again, and Draco, thrown across the bed, replied:
"Do not worry. Before I send you to your master, I will give you a potion to make sure that the heat starts exactly on your arrival, and so everything will be fine. Now you don't believe it, but you will be very happy to have a master, as soon as your ass starts to vomit lubricating liquids! "
"It is to make the skin supple and avoid stretch marks that I would have to remove one by one afterwards, and it would be a long job, while your new owner wants you tonight, you heard it!"
“Draco Malfoy, I introduce you to Tulip Parkinson. He is a couple of years younger than you and is in his second sale.
The war was over, Voldemort had been defeated and the Malfoys were out of favor. Of course, the help that he and his mother had given to Potter at some point in the war made the Savior put a good word for them and this kept them out of Azkaban.
Draco hesitated only for a moment, because even in the pain and fog of excitement and need, that part was still horrible:
He wandered around frantically, disappointed every time he walked into a room and found it empty, then eventually found it.
Draco was made to get up and the woman handed him a thin gold chain at the waist, to which two almost transparent veil drapes were attached, one in front and one behind.
“There are books on the shelves that explain most of the laws that affect Alpha and Omega. Feel free to consult them. I'll be back tomorrow to explain the latest things. "
Healer Smith made a face. “You are an object, you don't have your will, I thought I was clear. Your body reacts to the orders of any Alpha. It's just that a well-educated Omega doesn't force the Alpha to sort things out, he just does it. " Then, after giving Draco a hard look, he said, “I think it's best if you stay under Imperius tomorrow. Your father has been very clear to me: he doesn't want problems during your presentation. He certainly does not want you to shame him in front of everyone by making scenes, and it is my responsibility to make sure of it! "
He tried to remain lucid and to look around: he was in a sumptuous room, full of elegant furniture and with a large window opening onto a garden.
It was an intrusion, a penetration, and in that moment being penetrated, everywhere, was his only, incessant, desire.
Finally, after a brief absence, the healer encircled his neck, wrists and ankles with heavy strips of blue leather studded with sapphires and adorned with sturdy rings.
“Understandable, but it should be better in a few hours. Now try to concentrate, because we still have a lot to do today. Come on, now, without needing me to order it, let me see that you understand what I said to you yesterday. Get on the bed and show me your ass, good. "
Draco saw that each platform carried a name plate, and that his was on the last one, the one furthest from the entrance.
His mind was telling him it was dirty and awkward, but his hand had already pushed a finger to test his wet opening, and he was already pushing.
He was disgusted with himself, so unable to control the lewd urge he felt, and he remembered with clear clarity everything he had done and said since that morning.
“Here, you are Feba Macmillan. He is thirty-four years old and is on his fourth sale. He has already produced heirs to three important families, even if not as many as one might think, because his first two owners were satisfied with only one son while the third, even if he impregnated her only once, kept her for twenty years. I believe you can know it. Mr. Nott. Feba's third child should be your age, after all. "
Draco hadn't understood that his new master might require some changes to his body, and now the idea was making him feel bad again ... the breasts then ... and the idea of milk, pregnancy ... he wished he could throw up the little he had eaten.
He moaned the whole time, wincing with pleasure, and when his hands reached his buttocks he felt his hole stream humors, and the plea instantly reached his lips:
Draco brought his attention back to the present and told himself it would be good, for himself, if not he wanted to go crazy, do exactly that: stay focused only on the present without thinking too much about the future.
Unfortunately it was a vain relief, because, within half an hour, his body was burning with desire: his member, blocked by the ring, was pulling and rubbing against the mattress on which he was lying, tied on his stomach, with his arms. and legs apart.
“Well bitch, now a couple of things, before the healer gets to work on you and sends you into heat. First. I got you because you were for sale, so I don't have to worry about giving you back or how I will tune you. Second. I like a bit of spirit in a bitch, but you make me angry and I swear you'll go through hell. I've been clear? Answer, bitch! "
He had noticed some time before that, although his arms had been released, he was not allowed to be relieved.
"Take him to his room." He ordered, and Draco stared at the elf with wide eyes. Could he get up? Should he crawl? He did not know, but he found it safer to stay on his knees, and started following the elf to his room.
“On your knees, bitch. You won't walk upright when I can see you! " he yelled at him angrily, and Draco dropped to the floor, peeling his knees on the floor and instinctively presenting his ass.
Draco pursed his lips, trying to do the opposite, but the insistence of the healer's finger, and his wise hand, eventually made him give up, and he let out a long moan as his orgasm poured on the sheets under him .
Part of his brain told him that the place seemed vaguely familiar, but there was no way his overheated mind would tell him exactly where he was, and he paid no more attention to the matter.
The thin fabric, instead of hiding her nakedness, seemed to make her stand out even more, leaning on his member and making it noticeable, as it did on the curve of his buttocks.
The man did not look at him and left the room while he followed him, crawling fast on the precious marble floors.
“For the physical changes I would say we can stop. For the accessories instead I want you to put two nice rings on his nipples. Non-piercing, let's be clear, I want those restrictive rings to hold milk when pregnant. Better learn to wear them right away. "
With a deep sigh, Greg dropped his arms from across his chest and meandered his way back to the living area. The two-bedroom suite was more than large enough for the small family, given their access to the rest of the hotel and its aptitude for magical expansion. But for the moment they were playing host and the trio of ladies had spread themselves out, taking up more space than he thought anyone capable of. He paused in the doorway again, leaning against the frame, and this time smiling softly at his wife’s plotting face. Despite the Slytherin sisters occupying the recliners, he felt his wife somehow turned out more Slytherin than them all.
“I’m sorry, I’ve been busy,” Lily squeaked, unable to speak properly with her face smushed against Victoire, but her arms snuck around the curvy blonde anyway and she hugged her friend back tightly.
Harry gaped up at her. This was the Gryffindor that had signed up for the DA without hesitation, that had stood up in the Final Battle with barely a break in her stride. Now she was a Gryffindor used to fighting for the man she loved and their…child?
“Now all we need is for that Romanian Weasley to show up on the island and we’ll have a real Mamma Mia situation on our hands,” Daphne joked, referencing the Broadway musical the old hotel owners and subsequently Lily had been obsessed with.
,” an indignant voice rose above the rest before its owner pushed through the crowd to stand before Draco, hands on her hips and lips twisted into a sneer. Draco rolled his eyes, his lips twitching as he bit back a smile. Four long scars trailed down one side of her face, pulsing an angry red to match her irritation. Draco had always found it just a tad endearing. It was just so…Gryffindor.
, but the girls all turned at the announcement and their faces filled with glee. Music began to play over the speakers again and before Harry could take another step, a swarm of bachelorettes were encircling the bar and tugging the three men off in different directions. When Harry looked back up at the stage, it was empty.
“What did you do?” Harry directed his question to Teddy, who gaped and immediately pointed his finger at Lily.
“Daphne, Pans, I’m so glad you’re here,” he said with a fond smile, reaching up to rest his hands over theirs and squeezing them tight.
“Why would she do that!?” Teddy exclaimed at the same time as Lily nodded her head yes and said, “Sure did.” Teddy gaped at her again.
There’s a conference room on the thirty-seventh floor where we meet with the mediator and our lawyers and we fight over what goes to whom. This is our third and final meeting before it goes before a judge and I’m just
“No,” Andromeda answered. She studied him a moment longer before her gaze slid consideringly to the woman by his side. When her graze dropped to his wife’s stomach, however brief, he knew she knew. Her gaze met his and she raised a brow. He knew this was her way of asking, but they weren’t telling anyone. Not yet.
“It’s been twenty years, I’m sure there’s plenty to say,” Harry panted as he trotted to keep up. It was the wrong thing to say, or pant rather, because very suddenly, Draco stopped. Harry tripped over his feet and managed to catch his balance just in time to turn back to the man who was now
“Yes, but if we freeze him now then we can get him ready and keep him safe from Ladon until then.” Nico stepped forward, placing a gentle hand on Lily’s shoulder and withdrawing his wand with his other.
Before Lily could speak, Harry was already turning around and marching off. She watched in horror as the Head Auror stumbled towards a familiar blonde. And then as if she was sent by the gods, Pansy was suddenly intercepting him and pressing a pink liquid into his hand, guiding Harry in the opposite direction. The raven-haired man seemed too confused to protest. Lily let out a sigh of relief and turned back to the bar just as another drink was set down before her. She picked it up and threw it back in one swallow.
“Hey, mate!” a distant voice chirped a happy greeting and Harry managed to turn his head in time to see his other best friend stroll through the door with a full bottle of wine. “Is it the invitation then?”
“Are you telling me that if one of your parents was out there somewhere that you would ever stop trying to find them?”
The woman in front of him was clearly older than he remembered, but very much the same person he had gone to school with for six years. Her face was still round, her hips still wide, and her curly dirty blonde hair was pulled up into a high ponytail. The woman had more lines in her face, a hardness to her skin from time in the sun, a fierceness in her brown eyes that hadn’t been there at sixteen, and four ragged scars that ran from her temple down to the middle of her neck; but there was no mistaking Lavender Brown.
“It probably will be, but I can’t stand another twenty years of ‘what ifs,’ mate,” Ron said with a wince. Hermione turned a glare on him.
Lily made her way to the bar as the bachelor party began to filter out the way they came. She could feel buzzing in her veins pumping to the beat of the music and she wasn’t quite sure which way was up. She opened her mouth to ask for something, when a body slid into the space beside her.
“No you don’t. He was only lovely in photographs. Remember how irritable you were by month six?” A barking laugh broke through the magicked silence of the room.
“His name is Vince. He’s six,” Lavender replied, her face softening with the shift in conversation. Harry grinned at her and then she turned, the pair resuming their trek up the last of the stairs.
“You as well,” Harry said, releasing her hand so she could shake Charlie’s. She seemed to look at the taller man with a little more awe, before looking back and forth between him and Harry thoughtfully, as though she were suddenly scrutinizing them. “I must admit, I was a little surprised to get an invitation from your father at all, but I’m glad to have the opportunity to be here. Where, uh, where is he?”
“What on earth are you wearing?” she snickered, and Draco looked down with a frown. His trainers were a little worse for wear and one sleeve of his jean overalls had fallen off, showing the smudges of soil and grass stains on his white undershirt. Twenty years ago, he would have been horrified by his appearance. Twenty years ago, he also wouldn’t have ever dreamed of working with his hands instead of his magic on such a regular basis either.
The winter break was almost over and the eighth years had decided to have one last hurrah down at the new pub that had just opened off a side street in Hogsmeade. Malfoy had been getting ready in Parkinson and Hannah’s room, though Harry wasn’t entirely sure why. Malfoy had gotten closer with Hannah over the first term considering his best friend was rooming with her, so Harry supposed it wasn’t the strangest thing he had heard. Still, he found himself on edge as he waited in the common room with Hermione and the other boys for them to come down. Even Parvati and Lisa had beaten the trio downstairs.
Harry stood, mouth agape and heart pounding wildly in his chest, as he let Draco stride quickly away. Harry let him just walk away. Again. When Draco turned the corner, Harry cursed himself and began to run to catch up. When Harry turned the same corner, Draco was nowhere in sight. Instead, another tall, blonde stood gazing at him coolly, light brows arched high in surprise.
He had written them all letters. He had written Harry twenty-two. They all sat in a box in a dusty attic. Looking at how Charlie and Harry treated his daughter, Draco only just now realized how wrong he was. But there was nothing for it now. He could only keep them from finding out about it like they were in some Broadway musical and after the wedding, find a way to tell Lily. Now he wasn’t afraid of someone taking his daughter from him. He was afraid she would leave when she found out. Draco could feel the tears burning at the back of his eyes and sat down.
God, how I loved you. How I love you still. I will feel you in every last bit of me until my dying breath. But I had to be strong for both of us. You deserve better than this. So do I.
“I didn’t know you still worked here,” Harry blurted out, halting Draco’s progress out of the room. Draco scoffed.
“Luna will be there too,” Hermione said with a nod and Harry smiled. He would always be fond of his eccentric friend.
Lily sat beside her, humming happily away as she sipped on juice and nibbled at a muffin. Vic took the time to really look at her best friend. Their first class together had been Potions, and despite all the time Lily had spent being raised by
“Don’t tell me you have a secret twin sister.” Charlie could feel his heart pounding. He didn’t know if what he was feeling was terror or excitement. Both, probably.
“Marcus! Oliver!” Draco grinned and moved forward to hug his friends. Theo sighed and turned away to compose himself. When he turned back, a genuine smile was planted firmly in place. Oliver Wood and Marcus Flint stood towering above the younger Slytherins, both still in shape despite having retired from playing. They still coached different teams – Marcus, the Montrose Magpies; and Oliver, Puddlemere United. And despite the fact their fierce rivalry from school had followed them professionally, they were two of the sappiest people Draco had ever met. Not that Marcus would let anyone say so out loud within earshot.
At the sight of the dragon, Lily bounced away from Charlie and approached the barrier with a wide smile on her face. Charlie reached out to stop her, but Nico held out an arm to prevent Charlie from approaching. Nico’s other arm was wrapped around Daphne and keeping her from chasing after the young woman as well. He seemed to be the only one completely unconcerned about what the agitated dragon could do to someone as small as Lily.
“Godric, I’m so sorry, I didn’t know anyone was– Fuck, Potter. I thought I might have hurt someone important.”
“And probably ‘Dromeda,” Ron reminded him, pointing a finger in Harry’s direction. “Even if Malfoy does still blame her for Lily being a Hufflepuff.” Ron laughed at his own joke.
“Theo, wait–” But he was already disappearing into the throng of dancers. Lily quickly signaled the bartender for another drink.
It turned out that Draco Malfoy owned thirty-two pairs of heels. And Harry loved seeing him in every single one.
The dragons were inspired from many sources, but the Skrill specifically are from one of the “How to Train Your Dragon” movies. I haven’t seen it myself, but I loved this dragon and it’s on my to-watch list for sure.
With another sigh, he pushed himself up from the desk and made his way over to the fireplace. He was just going to keep talking himself in circles without a voice of reason. He threw a handful of floo powder into the low burning fire and then stuck his head in as the flames turned green, praying his friends were still awake.
“Come on, Nott. You’ve known that since we were eleven years old.” Nott sighed again and Greg grinned at him. “Go on and get your bags. I’ll show you my kitchen.”
“Hey! Hey there!” he called out, coming to a halt on the edge of the dock. The man in the steering loft stuck his head out and the man on the dock’s mouth dropped open. “Charlie?”
A short stopover to the press, "yes they were Necromancers, no they weren't zombies, yes they drained the town of significant energy, but no, it shouldn't be deadly."
Harry threw his head back in a laugh, "no. Not a dragon, although your cousin Draco's name means Dragon."
He had gotten sick of watching Potter buy terrible rosé and then get photographed by the press. So he sent a letter and attached a bottle of cabernet sauvignon. The letter simply read-
But, Harry does. He would never give someone he didn’t trust access to his home, after all. He hands over the wand and Draco helps him tie the blindfold.
Draco’s heart clenches, and he can’t stop himself from kissing Harry again. “You are so absurdly wonderful. I could never talk when we fucked before. I was terrified I would say all of the things that I like about you.”
“You brewed a Polyjuice Potion when you were twelve?” Draco asks after he stops laughing. He thinks back to their second year, the fear that invaded the entire school… How confident he had been at the time, how much he had believed that it would be a good thing for the castle to be cleansed. To this day he’s not exactly sure what happened, he heard that Potter and Weasley managed to rescue the younger sister and that the threat had been destroyed but he is curious what happened.
He loves the feel of Harry’s lips against his, so much larger and thicker than Draco’s own, he moans against the plushness. Draco, with the last moment of thought, gently pulls Harry over him so that amazing ass in on his lap.
“Yes. We remember,” Granger the Red says. “My brother still has scars on his face from how bloody good at charms…”
“Yeah,” Harry says, sitting down. Draco waves his wand again and makes the same FIrewhiskey cocktail for them. “Really, this place… It’s perfect.”
“Harry,” Draco says, because he thinks he finally sees where the conversation is going. “You didn’t have a lot of changing to do. You had good friends, who fought and sacrificed for the right things. You stood up for people, always. You were always honest, and even now you spend most of your time saving people. I’m not sure what change you think you need to make.”
Potter stands nervously, while the hordes of socialites, ambitious politicians and general groupies eye him like a steak. Within moments another dark face appears next to him, towered by a shock of red hair- Granger and Weasley of course. Though, as far as Draco has heard, they are actually both Granger now- Herminone and Ron Granger. Potter looks up at them in open relief, and Draco can’t imagine how little he’s learned to hide the feelings on his face.
Harry shrugs, “I’m honestly not sure. When I saw you yesterday… I don’t know. You’re so different than I remember, and sometimes I feel like I’m frozen as the boy I was. Five years later, and what am I doing? Going on wild adventures every year? Ron has gone into business with Fred… Hermione is saving England with her legislation and I’m…”
Harry can't help the glow in his chest, Draco's charms work is remarkable, but more than that, it's just lovely to see him here. With Harry's family, with the person, he loves most in the world. And it's no harm that Draco is very dressed down, in a pair of well-fitting jeans that accent just how long his legs are. His light blue jumper (Harry would bet his right arm that Draco spent at least half an hour trying to figure out the most non-threatening color) was soft and touchable and pulled taught over his broad shoulders.
“Still sexy?” Harry asks, his voice is snarky, and confident, the way it was when they were kids and people tried to scare him on the Quidditch Pitch.
Draco wrinkles his nose, “you do, but alas, I don’t. Back to the drawing board, I guess. What are you coming as?”
Harry finally couldn’t take it anymore and opened the door to his office suddenly glaring at the two junior Aurors. “Or maybe, you could consider dressing as Aurors and do your jobs.”
Draco didn’t ask anything else. He should have. He leans back against the bathroom’s white-painted door, and the strained warblings of Ron Weasley start to seep through the apartment.
“It’s beautiful,” Harry says wistfully, looking around the home, his eyes slightly unfocused as if it physically hurt him.
Potter looks a bit sheepish, “well, you see… At the time, we thought you were the Heir of Slytherin… And well, we only knew one way to question you…”
Harry smirks, and turns, resting his shoulders again on the mattress and arching his back. Draco’s eyes follow the smooth curve of his spine, all the way down to where Draco desperately wants to be. Draco is fairly certain he’s going to die, but he eventually presses in, feeling Harry stretch to accommodate him. He grabs Harry’s cheeks and uses them as leverage, each one so thick and grippable that he can’t force himself to let go.
Harry shakes his head, “I guess not. I just… How did you get so calm, after the war? It’s like you really found yourself here, three goddamn hours outside of London. Do you have any idea how terrible the Knight Bus ride for that is?”
After taking a shower and picking up Teddy's gifts, he meanders to the fireplace to see if Draco is around.
Harry downs the rest of his drink, “it’s not a real job.  I mean, technically speaking I’m unemployed. That’s what I put down on all of my Ministry forms anyway. I just roam around and help people, do some favors, and sometimes people do them for me… It’s not…”
Though Draco had been watching him for nearly two hours, he’s still surprised when he’s there at the end of his shift.
“We should go,” Potter says awkwardly, before lightly tugging the two of them away. Draco heaves a sigh of relief, his supervisor, Amelia, had only agreed to take him on, and let him try his cocktails if he promised that no one made a scene. If anyone caused a problem, Draco would have to de-escalate. If he couldn’t, she would take their side and he could never work a ministry event again.
“You’re not sick?” Harry replies, tilting his head, so his face is more firmly cupped by Draco’s hand.
To this day, Harry can't figure out if it was a kindness, that Aunt Petunia taught him something connected to his mother and grandmother even though she hated him.
“You are so lovely,” Draco says, and he’s surprised by how guttural it sounds. Harry is too, if the way his eyes widen is any indication. “You have the most amazing lips; they drive me to distraction.”
Draco shrugs, “well, I couldn’t exactly say I was a combat veteran, she’d ask about a muggle war which I know next to nothing about. Besides, that is basically what I was. I wanted a band of white, rich, pure men to run the world and have everyone else beholden to them. The Wizarding World isn’t quite as interested in race, but Potter… Surely you, of all people, have noticed that all of the old, powerful Wizarding families were white.”
Draco kisses him again because he can, rolling on top of Harry, who spreads his legs to accommodate him on instinct.
“Well,” Draco said, glancing at Potter’s well-fitting, cream-colored shirt and dark jeans that made him look edible. “I suppose, next to you, just about anything would. I hope that you got that shirt at half price.”
So, Draco instead mocked him, and teased him, and didn’t say a damn thing when they had sex because Draco knew he would say something incriminating about what he really thought. Potter, for his part, always let him in, so Draco assumed it was working.
Draco gives him a glare that would strike fear into the souls of dementors themselves, but Harry simply smiled back innocently. He's not a monster, so he changes the subject to, "I also brought presents!"
Draco picks up a clipboard and continues to take inventory while he talks. “After the war, we lost most of the family money in reparations. So, I needed a job- actually the first job I got was at a dodgy muggle joint that didn’t care that I had no proof of existence. Anyway, long story short, found I liked it.”
eyes light up at the thought of purchasing something for Draco’s house-elf, and Draco feels something crack inside him.
Harry didn't say anything; he knew about the case because he passed Robards desk one day and decided to take a look. It hadn't taken him more than fifteen minutes to realize the Aurors were on the wrong track, but he gave them a few days assuming they'd figure it out.
“You know,” Potter says, “I like seeing you this way. I never figured you’d be one for physical labor much, but I like watching you.”
Though from every interview he’s ever read, Potter detests that title. Apparently it all began five years ago, six months after the Battle of Hogwarts. Potter got a letter from a group of rebel fighters in Croatia struggling against their own Dark Lord. Theirs was much less frightening, and the trio is able to get him into custody in about half a year. In repayment for what they’ve done, the Croatian government had given them all heavy treasures. And thus began Harry Potter’s Heroic Hotline. Or, as Potter insists on calling it, “consulting.”
Draco pulls back with a gasp once Harry settles, “before we go any further, I need to know something.”
Teddy puffed up his chest, "I'll give everyone ice cream and there will be no bedtimes." With that last declaration, he looked mulishly up at Andromeda.
On the bright side, Draco thought, at least he can look at Potter walking away. It is quite a view. He may be a penniless war criminal, but at least he’s a penniless war criminal who lives in a world where Potter’s pants are one size too small.
Harry laughs and leans up to kiss him. They had never really kept it a secret, but they never really told anyone either. Still, no one seems surprised, and he even sees Ron give him a thumbs up.
Draco doesn’t realize that Buffy has actually physically transported him to Potter’s doorstep until he gets there and realizes he’s still in his fuzzy slippers.
Draco takes a deep breath and knows that no one in the building will cut him any slack if he’s rude to her, so he smiles and says, “terribly sorry.”
Draco speeds down the hall as he hears them walk out of the kitchen towards the bathroom in the back of Potter’s apartment. It’s a penthouse with large floor to ceiling windows in the center of the city, London’s glittering lights laid out below Potter. Draco, personally, finds it somewhat terrifyingly modern- far away from his ancient grounds.
Including, Preety Shah, a young Ravenclaw who just joined their ranks. She was on death threat duty for the past week, and Harry can see it wearing on her. Still, he realizes he should have said something sooner when he sees her in an abandoned hallway crying.
"I can't have an Auror on my team who is simply incapable of following directions or instruction. I can't have an Auror on my team who is convinced they are always right. And I especially can't have an Auror on my team who is all of those things, and the
Draco nods and leans across the bar when Harry meets him halfway for a kiss. "I'll see you later then."
“Of course not,” Harry scoffs, he almost never goes. Occasionally, Hermione, who is planning to run for Minister of Magic one day, will bully him into attending so she can “leverage his powerful national image.”
Potter opens and shuts his mouth a few times, lost for words, before blurting out, “what are you doing here?”
together, and Draco had been lifting boxes of Hag mead. His strong arms flexed with the heavyweight, and the black t-shirt he was wearing was clinging slightly more than usual to his arms and chest.
Draco was astonished to find that Harry was already trembling against him, the gentle touches doing more to drive him out of his mind than any of Draco’s previous passionate grabs. Draco bites back a smile; it seems so fitting that Harry would respond better to gentle touches. After all, how many people have touched him gently?
Draco rolls his eyes fondly and gently kisses down Harry’s neck, taking time now to pay attention to all the tiny places that make him shiver and quake. He’s run his tongue along Harry’s neck enough times to know it’s sensitive, but usually, it is perfunctory. This time, Draco luxuriates in the feel of his skin under his lips, enjoying the scent of him. Draco licks the tiny beauty mark next to Harry’s adam’s apple, barely paying attention to the way that Harry hasn’t stopped shivering.
Harry hears Draco smother a laugh before he drops down to where Harry is on the grass. "A prince, Edward? And what shall you do as a prince?"
when he spoke to Draco about him. "Oh, sorry, Teddy is my godson. I'd like you to meet him. I mean, you're family."
He heard a sharp clattering sound from the kitchen before Draco's head came poking out, looking intently at the fire.
All in all, the necromancer took Harry about two days to deal with and gave him some time to get groceries and otherwise prepare for hanging out with Teddy.
He tilts his jaw up, daring Draco to call him on his obviously ridiculous lie. He’s obviously gone to considerable length to get here, perhaps even taking the Knight Bus.
When in the name of Merlin did Harry Potter get an ass like that? Tucked into the slacks of his dress robes, it looks almost fake. The rest of his body is so lithe, his face with high cheekbones and his delicate, slender wrists which have always moved with unwavering instincts- and yet, incongruously, an ass that defies the laws of logic and gravity.
"Let's stay in," Harry whispers back. The moment feels like a secret like they were in their little pocket of the universe. "I just want to be with you."
Draco stared at him with open disbelief before shaking his head, "how is it possible that you still look that handsome dressed like a confused runaway from the '50s?"
"I'm sorry, Mr. Potter," Robards says awkwardly. "You're extremely talented… It's just… We got your personality results back…"
“I just don’t know,” Potter says; he sounds lost. “I don’t think Draco likes me, like at all. He has never said a single good thing about me; all he does is insult me. But then, he comes when I invite him to things. He… I mean, we still--”
Potter doesn’t look like a person who hears things like that regularly though. His mouth has dropped open, slack-jawed. Unfortunately for Draco, he has one of those faces that is cute even when absolutely stunned stupid,
Harry doesn’t really reply, just shifts so that his face is in line with Draco’s and they can look at each other in the eye. Draco has always liked Harry’s face, he just looks friendly and warm in a way that Draco knows he never will.
Draco shrugs as elegantly as he can with one shoulder. “I have no opinion on how you take your drink, sir.”
When he’s finished his water and lays back down and Harry lays on his chest. Draco runs his fingers through Harry’s wild, soft curls. He feels more than hears Harry chuckle against him.
Draco bit his lip for a moment, before nodding slowly. "Yeah, I'll be able to get someone to cover as long as I can be back by around six-ish."
He ducks back down to kiss him again, taking the time now to enjoy his firm, smooth skin. It’s so warm under Draco’s palms as he slowly slides his hands up and down. Harry melts against him, as if he had been hoping for tenderness for a long time and finally got it.
He hears the rustle of fabric, and he peers carefully around the corner to see that Granger has moved to embrace Potter. “If he doesn’t absolutely adore you, he’s an idiot, Harry. Maybe it’s some weird pureblood repression.”
Draco looks at him with a raised eyebrow, before setting him down gently on the mattress. “What do you think?”
“You didn’t have to see your body,” is all Draco says, simply. “Are you even planning on going this year?”
. Someone I didn't have to share or borrow. But it doesn't matter now; I don't need anyone to take care of me. I've been taking care of me for a long time."
together, and laughed- and then Draco had forced Harry to discuss his various opinions on plot points, structure, dialogue, and the Hot Priest.
The dragon reared back at her sudden appearance, sparks of electricity disconnecting from its body and sparking against the wall. Rock and ice began to fall, its shatter echoing throughout the cave. Lily stood her ground, raising both hands up to show the dragon she came without anything with which to attack. Her heart was pounding, her stomach fluttering, her hands beginning to sweat – it was always nerve wracking every first approach, no matter how many years she had been doing this. Slowly, carefully, Lily dropped down to one knee and dropped her head.
Draco lay on his back, his arms held straight up in the air so he could hold open a book and read it to the small figure curled up in on his chest. Between his arms, lying on his side completely on top of Draco, was a chubby little boy with a mess of brown curls hiding his face from view. All Harry could tell was that the little boy was sucking his thumb with one hand, clutching a worn out stuffed bunny with the other, and listening intently as Draco animatedly told him the story of a little boy who wanted to be a mermaid and his abuela taking him to a festival all dressed up. Draco seemed entirely comfortable, like this was a regular occurrence. Based on the fond, affectionate expression Lavender was looking at them with, Harry supposed it was.
Harry reached behind him and wrapped his hand around one of Malfoy’s ankles. Malfoy easily bent his knee when Harry brought his heeled foot up and let the dark-haired man lift his leg higher until his foot was even with Harry’s head.
“You have not been here in too long, little flower,” Nico said softly, offering her a small smile. “Last summer, we acquired another young male. Ladon. He and Gina are expecting.”
“What are you doing in here anyways? It’s so dark and musty,” Victoire said, wrinkling her nose with disgust as she looked around the dimly lit storage shed.
“He has, has he?” Charlie chimed in, a frown tugging at his lips even as his eyes sparkled in amusement.
“Do you like them as shoes, or do you like them on Malfoy?” Parvati teased and Harry somehow just turned redder. The rest of the group burst out with laughter and giggles at his nonverbal reply. Perhaps they had all had quite a bit of drink that night.
So when the lift reaches the bottom and the doors open, we pull away and right ourselves. I spell the tears from our faces and you smile at me. It’s still so sad, but I think my smile is just as sad too.
He stood a small distance from his goddaughter and her two best friends, standing with his arms crossed and silently watching her twirl his son about. Greg had always been the silent type – was
“Those are beautiful, Draco,” she breathed, clearly admiring the shoes while Harry was trying not to clearly admire Malfoy. “Are they Blackwood?”
The bickering couple turned their glares away from the other and onto the blonde staring them down with her hands on her hips. Teddy’s expression softened and even Victoire’s shoulders relaxed and she rolled her eyes.
They turned a corner into a small ballroom and Lavender came to an abrupt halt, throwing her arm across Harry’s chest to make him halt beside her. He opened his mouth to ask why they had stopped, but then his gaze caught the couch midway across the hall and the words died on his lips. Lying down across the couch, silhouette brightened considerably with the glow of sunlight streaming through a window, was the same blonde Harry had been thinking about all day.
Skrill were one of the most difficult dragons to keep in captivity. They were large, powerful dragons rivaled in force only by the Hungarian Horntail. Most people saw them as dangerous, protective dragons but Lily knew they were nervous, anxious creatures. They were hard to find; even harder to catch. Kefáli tou Drákou had only come by them fifteen years ago thanks to Nico, who had found a pair when one of them – Geronimo – was injured. Unable to continue on in the wild, Geronimo became a permanent fixture. And unable to continue on without her mate, Gina had come with him.
“Nico!” Lily cried with delight, throwing her arms around the man’s neck. He laughed and hugged her tight.
“Tell us how you really feel about Malfoy’s shoes,” she said simply. Harry was certain the flush on his face was creeping down his neck and he looked again at Malfoy, who raised a single thin brow at him.
“Lily’s down by the docks. The boat’s bringing a lot of familiar faces in this afternoon. Perhaps you’ll know some of them…Perhaps Lily could use the company even if you don’t.” And then Greg walked away, Harry gaping at his back until the man disappeared.
–” Harry almost collided with Lavender for the second time that day as the blonde whirled around, the basket sliding down her arm as she put her hands on her hips, but Harry managed to stop just in time. The werewolf stood two steps above him, the furious expression on her face and the fiery glare in her eyes enough to make him put two more steps between them.
“He didn’t. Adrianne left it to him,” Lavender shrugged, adjusting the basket so that it was more comfortable to trek up the stairs. Harry felt his heart twist.
“Is Theo Uncle Theo?” Victoire asked and Lily nodded. “Who is Charlie and who is the other one then?” Lily’s face flushed again.
“I’m probably needed as well, so I’d best be off,” Draco said quickly and then spun on his heel and strode for the entrance at the opposite end of the hall.
“Lily, I’m only going to ask this once, so I need you to be honest with me, ok?” Lily nodded. “Are you trying to Mamma Mia your way into finding out who your other dad is?” Lily bit her lip and looked down.
“He’s really turned this place into a dream, hasn’t he?” Theo turned to look at her when she spoke and offered a small smile. She really did look so much like her father. It never failed to keep him on edge when he talked with her.
And then Draco’s fingers were wrapped around his cock. Harry could have cried. Might have done. The long, nimble fingers he had spent years staring at and watching, coveting, dreaming about. The pale, slim hands he had missed for far too long were bringing him bliss he hadn’t felt in years. His heart pounded in his chest.
The Villa Ariadne hosted a large kitchen with enough cooking and prepping space for a dozen chefs, even if it was only Greg and his two line cooks. It was a hub of activity most of the day – magic flowing over the tables and between the ovens as vegetables chopped themselves and pots stirred on their own – but even more so now with the impending wedding. Greg was busy hustling around his kitchen, only pausing to give one of his cooks instructions, while Daphne sat in a chair out of the way, her attention divided between her business emails and her blonde friend who was currently glued to the dining room doors. Draco was peering through the window, his gray eyes continually scanning the growing breakfast crowd. Daphne set her phone down in her lap so she could really look at her friend. He was dressed in a pair of jeans and a pale blue button-down shirt today, his long hair pulled back into his now trademark messy bun. Daphne watched her friend chew on his bottom lip, his brow slightly furrowed, before he turned his head to her and opened his mouth to speak.
“Not here,” Draco whispered. Harry’s knees almost buckled. The blonde’s voice held such promise. He reached out and grabbed the pale man’s wrist, turning and tugging him along as they navigated the empty halls.
“Not often. Right.” Theo’s smile seemed to turn sad at that. Draco just felt guilty so he pulled his friend into another hug. It seemed tighter than the last one.
Charlie had gone back to the dragon sanctuary again today and was telling them a little bit about it. And then Harry had managed to get Theo to tell him about the first time he had met Lily when she was three years old without quite realizing that Harry was fishing for information. It was as Theo was recounting the tale of the very brave toddler that the lights dimmed and silence fell upon the taverna.
Nico drove the odd trio past a variety of dragons – the sand and snow wraiths, both of which excelled with blending in with their surroundings; a large gaggle of dwarf dragons, a small species that lived in hives like bees and were often found scavenging shiny objects instead of food (a huge part of why they found themselves on the endangered species list); the world’s only known living Ka-Riu, a scarlet colored dragon that often looked as though it was made completely of fire; and one of Lily’s favorites, the Knucker, a leathery brown dragon that lives in damp holes, spits purple venom, and reminds Lily a bit of a salamander.
!?” Harry froze, his hands hovering above the basket and his mouth hanging open as he gazed on at the most unexpected woman he ever expected to see on the island.
Except Harry still hadn’t had a sip of his new beer, which meant he’d only had two and a half bottles in the four hours they’d been there. The buzz he was feeling was definitely not from his drinks. Malfoy’s hand didn’t move from the top of Harry’s thigh, but his foot – which Harry realized was the one opposite him as Malfoy sat with his legs tightly crossed – continued to slide up his leg. Harry clenched his fists on top of the table and tore his gaze away from Malfoy, only to see Hermione looking right at him with both brows raised. He flushed a deep red and looked down at his drink instead.
. The box also contained an old wand that looked like it hadn’t been used for years, a few newspaper clippings, and a scattering of photographs from when Lily’s father was pregnant with her.
“Minor league teams. I don’t contract with the major leagues. You know that.” Draco shrugged at his broom-making friend.
Both Victoire and Teddy raised their eyebrows at that and then turned to the other with a meaningful look. The couple had been split up for almost a year, this time. Their relationship had had a lot of passionate starts and angry stops since Victoire was fourteen and Teddy sixteen. The pair’s relationship had been nothing less than tumultuous over the years, but they always managed to maintain some semblance of friendship in between their breakups. Lily was usually the one to bring them around. And after all the pair had been through, it was almost as if they could communicate without talking. Lily hated it. Even if the three of them could often convey a wordless conversation, the private moments between the two when they were clearly silently talking about her annoyed her to no end. She wished every time she had just let their friendship wither away.
Before she could respond and question his intentions with her father, however, a long loud horn sounded across the ocean. Everyone looked up as the Kalokairi ferry zoomed over the waves, moving quickly in their direction. Harry and Lily stood up so they could join the queue with the rest of the waiting cast.
“Goodbye, friend. I’ll try to see you soon, okay?” She felt a heavy hand settle on her shoulder and looked up into Charlie’s sympathetic face. He squeezed her shoulder in comfort and she leaned against him. “Thank you.”
“Nine am tomorrow, sir,” she chirped. His face fell. He supposed he could get a hotel for the night, get here bright and early instead. But he was so excited, so eager to get to the island and…meet the bride. The ticket clerk must have seen something in his face because she pointed towards a small boat still docked and only just starting to get ready to leave. “You can always try him – said he was going to Kalokairi when he rented the whole boat.”
Malfoy keened, trying to pull Harry back down, but Harry managed to evade his grasp. He grasped Malfoy’s legs and pulled them from behind him. Malfoy looked up at him and a brief moment of panic flashed across his face, but then Harry just pulled his shirt over his head and Malfoy’s gaze brightened again as he drank in Harry’s broad, brown chest. He’d filled out more since the long year in Dean’s Forest, no longer the scrawny starved boy of his youth. Malfoy reached out, slowly running his hands across Harry’s taut abdomen and then up over the defined muscles of his chest and across his broad shoulders. Harry let out a gentle sigh and then leaned back down, placing a soft kiss against Malfoy’s lips.
“Just go talk to him,” Daphne said, sighing at how childish her friend was being about all this. They were
“I was walking by and saw you.” Draco didn’t have to see it to know Harry was shrugging. His chest tightened further, and a tear escaped. Or maybe he was wrong; he didn’t know this man.
“The room is perfect. I can’t believe what you’ve done with the place, Dray…Aunt Adrianne would be so proud. Of all of it.”
“Narrowed it down?” Victoire repeated, narrowing her eyes at her friend. Lily began to look a little sheepish again.
“Harry, long time no see,” Daphne said slowly and Harry smiled sheepishly, running a hand through his hair. When he glanced around the table, it was to find both Lily and Vic watching him intently.
When Draco was promoted to hotel manager and asked Greg to come run the kitchen, it was the longest Greg had gone without seeing his friend. He remembered that first night in his flat three summers ago when they drank an entire bottle of cheap whiskey and didn’t talk. He remembered last summer when Draco floo’d into his still meager one-bedroom flat with the tiniest bundle in his arms that Greg had ever seen. They drank a single glass each of good whiskey and didn’t talk until little Lily smiled up at him for the first time in her life. With one look at his fridge full of dozens of pictures of her over the last year that he couldn’t be there to see, Greg said yes and moved to Greece.
Harry Potter,” Lavender hissed, bringing up a hand to point a finger directly in his face. “That is my
“Skrill hibernate in ice,” Lily explained. “Honestly, it’s probably the only reason why they live so long. Their bodies slow exponentially, and they age very little when they’re frozen. It’s also the best way to preserve them for transport. They’re not anxious that way and to them, it feels like no time has passed at all.” Lily looked down at Geronimo, who was still lying down and curiously gazing up at her from his position on the floor. “He might be a
“How can I resist you?” Benny suddenly crooned from the doorway, pulling both Draco and apparently Harry from their examination of the other. Draco felt a flush creeping up his neck, but he ignored it in favor of clearing his throat and looking at Harry pointedly from where he stood with his arms crossed over his chest.
“Welcome, ladies and friends!” The crowd cheered loudly. “For one night, and one night only, the Malfoy Taverna is proud to present the one, the only, the world’s first Girl Power band–”
“I mean, three different men fucked me right around the same time and the healer could never quite pin down a conception date, so I have absolutely no idea who Lily’s father really is.”
“How did you end up here?” Harry broke the silence again. He couldn’t see Lavender’s expression from where he trailed behind her, but for a brief moment her shoulders tensed and then they seemed to relax as she straightened her stance. Harry was wondering why she was readying herself for a fight until–
Naturally, this was all information that Hermione Granger was fully aware of. When she heard about Draco’s pregnancy during his second trimester in December 1999, she did what any self-respecting Healer would do and researched it. The only other person she had shared her findings with at the time had been her fellow Healer-in-training Luna Lovegood. Obstetrics and gynecology weren’t her intended specialty, but it was Luna’s; so at the time, it didn’t seem surprising that Luna wasn’t completely unaware about the information Hermione was so
“I know; we donate a lot to you guys and to the Lupin Foundation. I came up with the concept a few years ago, after talking to Lavender about how difficult her scars made it for her to seek work after the war.”
“It is my office,” she said in what she thought was an agreeable tone, but Hermione’s eyes just narrowed. Luna sighed and dropped the pile of files in her arms onto her desk before dropping into the creaking seat behind it. “I’m very glad you’re here. Did you get my note on the patient in five forty-three B then? It’s a most curious case. I haven’t seen a purple rash like that since–”
bring Lily into this.” Draco stood, glaring daggers right back. “You weren’t around, you don’t get to pass judgement on the choices I made after you.”
dreams. I was just trying to live, and I guess I just so foolishly hoped you might want to be a part of that life. Even if your dreams didn’t include being with me.” Draco deflated, his eyes burning again. But he couldn’t stop now, couldn’t prevent twenty years’ worth of pent-up emotion from spilling out. “You were my best friend. That’s the worst part. You just left and you didn’t even send me a letter.” Harry was taken aback.
“You obviously don’t know Dad, then,” she laughed and Harry tried to ignore his heart sinking, his smile faltering at that.
“‘Mione and Ron got over Draco, and he was way worse,” Harry said before taking a long swig of his lager.
“Potter,” Malfoy greeted him coolly; and though his body was rigid and stiff, obviously tense at having been caught wearing a pair of women’s heels, Harry could clearly see the panic Malfoy was trying to tamp down in the blonde’s grey eyes.
“I, uh, I was invited to the Malfoy-Wood wedding on Kalokairi,” Harry said, running a hand through his messy hair. “I kind of just missed the last boat.” Charlie threw his head back and laughed, the sun brightening his thick, shoulder-length hair.
“So how’s Lily? Is she excited?” Draco was never more grateful for his friend. At the thought of his daughter, he smiled.
Put back together as though nothing had ever happened, Draco straightened his back and spun around, leaving before Harry could figure out how to make him stay. Again.
“Lily!” Teddy said with excitement, and then bounded over to pick his still favorite cousin up and spin her around in a hug. She laughed. When he set her down, she was immediately pulled into the arms of her other best friend.
“No. They never fight.” Teddy frowned, his hair darkening as he tried to piece together his thoughts.
“They’re for a wedding bouquet,” Lavender said easily, ignoring his gaze as she tucked her wallet into the basket beneath the vegetation.
Harry didn’t see Malfoy in any of the rest of their classes that day, or at dinner for that matter either. When Harry got back to their shared room, the curtains around Malfoy’s bed had been pulled shut and the blonde didn’t emerge for the rest of the night. The open package that had been on Malfoy’s desk when Harry was in the room last had disappeared, though to where Harry wasn’t sure. When Harry woke up the next morning, Malfoy was already gone.
He paused at the door again. There wasn’t any music coming from inside, but light was spilling out from under the door, so he knew Malfoy was still awake. His heart was already beating faster, his stomach already fluttering as he tried to tamp down the nerves. He didn’t know
, with an expression that told Harry she knew the answer and was fishing for more information. He smiled and bit back the reminder that she should know if Draco really talked about him so much. Harry didn’t know
With as much alcohol as had been flowing through them, the group was easy to distract. But Malfoy didn’t tear his dark grey gaze away from Harry and Harry couldn’t quite keep his own gaze anywhere else for long. And every time he caught a glimpse of Malfoy’s bouncing heeled foot out of the corner of his eye, he couldn’t stop himself from wondering if the skin of Malfoy’s ankle would be soft beneath his lips or of the idea of tucking the heel just over his shoulder while Malfoy lay spread out in front of him. Harry was
Draco cursed his absolutely terrible decision a moment later when footsteps told him Harry was walking into that room. He heard his old classmate mumble something about the door being open before a distinctly familiar voice called out, “Hello?” Draco, as smart as he ever was, kept totally quiet.
“End of September,” Harry said. He took a big sip of wine in the silence that followed. It was good, but he wished he had brought his whiskey.
“He’s been taking classes online in graphic design and computer science. He wants to design websites. He’s even making one for Dad! Business is really going to pick up here once he does.”
,” Nico cast, and the odd trio watched in amazement as a gentle flow of ice swirled out of tip of his wand and began to surround the now docile dragon lying calmly on the ground. Slowly, but surely a thick block of ice formed around Geronimo until he was completely encased. When the spell was finished, Lily reached out and pressed her hand against the ice in front of Geronimo’s snout, a sad smile on her face.
“Alright,” Draco cleared his throat, suddenly broken from the trance. He stood and placed Vince onto the ground, forcing Harry to stand and move back in order to avoid being stepped on. “I think your mother needs your help, Vincent. You best be off.”
“Must be next door,” Harry said to himself, and Draco could hear him setting down a bag, followed by a zipper. Hiding in that tiny, cramped closet, Draco wished a lot of things. He wished he had never agreed to stock towels. He wished he had never agreed to let Lavender take over booking as part of the wedding. He wished he had brought his wand or even his phone with him. He also wished he had never taken Benny into the closet with him.
almost as much as he had when he returned from Greece. She was just getting out of the hospital. Unlike Harry, however, she was able to keep away from even the photojournalists with absolutely no boundaries and eventually faded away from one news cycle to the next. Harry had heard that she had gone to the continent instead of back to Hogwarts, but despite losing track of her he had still never expected her to pop up
“Trading with the sanctuary. Kefáli tou Drákou. They have a dragon that needs moving. He’s…not quite getting along with a new male.”
His veins were on fire. His blood was burning its way through his body, lighting him up from the inside. Everything seemed to be moving too quickly and yet not fast enough all at once. He had missed this, he had missed
Harry was still standing in the doorway, mouth slightly agape, as he took in Malfoy’s tall, lean figure. Harry had admitted to himself back in fifth year that Malfoy was rather attractive to look at, and his opinion on that matter had only grown once they were back at Hogwarts and sharing a room together. This, though. This was a new feeling entirely. His stomach flipped and his heart raced and Harry was sure a flush was starting to creep up his face as he appreciatively watched Malfoy model his beautiful footwear. And then Malfoy finally caught sight of Harry on his next spin, and this time the blonde immediately froze.
Other than a few complements from some of the girls, no one said a word to Malfoy about his makeup or his heels. Instead, the group acted as though nothing about this was different than usual and made their way down to Hogsmeade. With the large number of young adults that had started to move into the town after the war, the businesses seemed to be responding. The new pub was light and cozy, the ‘top hits’ music louder than The Three Broomsticks or The Hogs Head, and the clientele were almost all under thirty.
“Nico, this is one of my godmothers, Daphne,” Lily introduced. Nico grasped one of Daphne’s hands with his and pressed his lips to the back of it.
“You have James and Al with Ginny, right?” Lavender asked, her voice giving nothing away. Harry nodded. “How is she?”
“Nothing. No reason. You know, it’s surprising to see you here after all this time. What brings you to Kalokairi?” Charlie’s grin grew at the slip.
The man waiting for them at the building’s exit was one Charlie knew well. He was shorter than Charlie, though that wasn’t saying much considering he had inherited the Weasley height, and he was very stocky. The man’s skin was dark from his time in the sun with matching dark features and a lot of dark hair. The man’s beefy arms were coated with coarse hair and his long, thick curls were pulled into a messy bun on top of his head. Age hadn’t really touched this man, save for the crinkles around his eyes and the smile lines around his lips. Charlie grinned and waved at his older friend, but the man’s attention was firmly on the blonde hurrying her way over to him.
, but Harry was distracted by the black marble Dionysus spinning a matching Ariadne in his arms and the poem he knew lay on the other side. He felt his heart twist again, but even he knew it wasn’t for the end of his marriage.
The girl wasn’t an exact replica of Draco but looking at her there was no doubt in Harry’s mind just who she belonged to. Her blonde hair was pulled into a messy bun, errant curls framing her face by accident with the wild directions they faced. Green eyes gazed eagerly back at him, the freckles on the girl’s face even more apparent from time spent in the summer sun. But her features were sharp, her body lean and her movements graceful. Harry suddenly wondered what she looked like when she was a small child, as a baby. She looked far too young to be getting married, Harry thought. Harry began to breathe again when he looked back over at his godson who was waving excitedly at him, hair bright red in greeting. Victoire leaned over to whisper something to Lily and the shorter girl’s face turned thoughtful as she nodded in reply.
“Sorry, I had to get some air,” Charlie said, coming to a halt beside a marble fountain. It was smaller than the one at the main entrance, made of all white marble, and depicted only Dionysus lounging surrounded by food and drink. Charlie took deep gasping breaths, trying to get his bearings. He couldn’t look at Lily. Couldn’t look at who was most assuredly
Malfoy was wearing a pair of fitted black slacks tonight, so the lean lines of his legs were still visible though not nearly as they had been that November afternoon. This time, however, Malfoy was sporting a pair of cerulean blue pumps. The heel was thinner, sharper almost, than the red pair had been, though still six inches tall. However, the rounded toe was platformed, so his foot wasn’t as arched as the last time Harry had seen him in heels. For a brief moment, Harry wondered just how many pairs of heels Malfoy owned.
Lavender hadn’t come back for eighth year – hadn’t been allowed to, as Draco would later find out. It seemed Dumbledore was the only one capable of going to bat for werewolves, no matter the Order of Merlin Lavender had received for her part in the Final Battle. So when Lavender ultimately came to visit them, things between her and Draco were incredibly awkward. They hadn’t yet aired their grievances. But then she met Lily and Draco told her everything and now he had two permanently local friends to pester him about taking care of himself for the rest of his days.
“There you are, Lily! I was just looking for you,” a voice sing-songed and the whole table looked over as a short, chubby woman dressed head to toe in orange bustled her way to the table. Her honey brown hair was pulled onto her head in a tall bun, a few purposely curly strands too short to fit in and styled to frame her face instead. She looked familiar, but Harry just couldn’t match a name to her face.
So I sit facing the window and this time I’m quiet. I’m just looking out at the grey sky and wondering if the windows open. You’re arguing alongside your lawyer, but I can feel you sneaking furtive glances in my direction. I can hear you growing quieter with each passing moment. It takes the mediator clearing his throat loudly for me to realize
“No he didn’t. But we did, ages ago. You’re a little behind.” Theo laughed and glanced back at Draco over his shoulder.
“I understand, no need to apologize. I am very much looking forward to it! You will make such a beautiful bride.”
Harry wasn’t exactly sure how he ended up at the taverna bar beside Charlie and Theo. He had gone looking for Draco to talk to him, to apologize for earlier, and had been directed here by Lavender. Perhaps one drink would be a good idea, something to fortify himself with before confronting the love of his life. Because that was Harry’s plan tonight. Draco kept evading him, kept finding ways to get away, but Harry was determined this time.
“Why don’t you hire someone to do that?” Daphne asked and Draco sighed as they made their way along the cobbled road. They had this conversation every time they came to visit. Surely one day they would give it a rest?
“Wonderful, that’s wonderful,” Draco said, his voice tight as he clenched his hands into fists at his side. He could feel his heart trying to pound its way out of his rib cage, could feel the bile begin to rise in his throat. “Will, uh, will Mrs. Potter be joining us?” Harry’s mouth dropped open.
The open market was crowded at this time in the afternoon, but Harry found it easy to slip through, pausing to sample food or peruse the locally made soaps and oils. He watched as regulars greeted those running the booths, as a local vendor teased another with friendly competition. He wondered if things had gone differently, if he might be the one to tell them there was plenty of room for two cheese shops; if in another world he was securing them both for a large event. Harry swallowed around a lump in his throat and forced himself to turn away. It had been so easy not to think like this for the last fifteen years. He pushed away his what-ifs in favor of a swirl of memories focusing on his teenage sons. The two reasons why it had been so easy until now.
“I’d really like to travel. See the world, you know?” She sighed. “But Dad needs me. He can’t run this place alone. I mean, I know he has Auntie Lav and Uncle Greg, but it’s not the same. And don’t tell anyone else this, but I think they’re going to have their hands full with another baby soon.” Harry’s brows rose. Lily looked at him with a grin. “They think nobody else knows yet, and I don’t think Dad does, but I’m smarter than they give me credit for.” Harry laughed.
aunt,” Pansy mumbled, cracking an eye open to glare at the awkward, gawking figure of Teddy.  “Yes?”
Harry looks at him for a long moment, before he lays back down on his back ready to simply take what Draco has to offer. The show of trust has Draco frantically summoning lube, pressing cleaning and stretching charms into Harry’s skin.
Harry looked at Ron, bemused, "Uh… that is still your name, isn't it? I guess if you're changing it to Granger, we can go Granger and Potter."
Harry is thankful for the door to his office when he puts it down on his desk to scream in despair. The office was getting ready for the annual Harry Potter Day party, held officially by the Ministry of Fucking Magic. This year’s theme, apparently, is to dress as all the various “eras” of him. Harry truly, and he means this sincerely, doesn’t know what the hell that was even supposed to mean.
"Rescue him?" Harry replies, confused. "And possibly shut down the cult if I can, but I'll start with the rescue and circle back if I have to."
It didn't help, talking about Teddy with Draco earlier. Harry had always tried to be the godfather that Sirius might have been if he had been given a chance, leaned into the leather jackets, and the brooms. He didn't want little Teddy to grow up without a Marauder.
“What made them strange?” Cho Chang, a former Ravenclaw if Draco isn’t mistaken, “I mean, aren’t all centaurs a bit… Different from humans.”
“Draco!” Harry yells, finally coming hard on his cock, clenching so tight that Draco comes out of sheer self-preservation. He’s never seen Harry come like this, long and hard, his lips forming a perfect “o.”
He moves back up immediately to press a kiss to Harry’s cheek, running his thumb across the cheekbone, he kissed. “What’s wrong, sweetheart?”
Harry looks at his chest a moment, perhaps looking for scars but Draco knows he’ll find none. Snape was quite talented and had managed to heal them completely.
“Like your eyes,” Draco says, kissing Harry’s eyelids. “Like they’re already a beautiful color, do they have to be that big, too? It’s unfair.”
Harry nods and turns around, walking back towards the bedroom with a teasing smirk on his face, "are you coming? Or should I start without--"
Harry shrugged, "like… I don't know, private Aurors. Let's show them how much better we are at this than them. You and me… And of course, 'Mione when she isn't busy rewriting the Ministry codes one at a time."
“I like you,” Draco says helplessly because he’s started now; he’s not even sure he’s making sense. “I like your hair, and your smile, and your laugh, and your stupid eyes. I am… I am… I really, really like you.”
He feels Draco apparate him somewhere and it feels warm, he smiles, figuring out what Draco’s plan was. Clearly, they were going to have a lovely beach vacation. That was even kind of romantic, even though technically Harry and Draco never said anything about their arrangement.
So he had gone to his supervisor, well… that was a lie. What he had done, was following a different low-level dealer to a different cursed painting, ended up in a duel for his life, again, and managed to get a verbal confession out of one of them and a few names of higher-ups.
“Whatever business you said brought you to the neighborhood,” Draco replies blithely, with the mildest hint of a smirk referencing Harry’s obvious lie earlier in the conversation.
He can’t quite help the moan he lets out when he finally lowers his stiff body into the chair beside Potter who smiles at him.
“Shh,” Draco says softly, gently using the blunt tips of his nails to trace shivery paths on Harry’s skin. He enjoys watching the goosebumps appear in his wake. “I promise, I’ll take good care of you, Harry.”
He’s so caught up in the mystery, and frankly trying to tamp down on the overwhelming lust that crashes through him unexpectedly that he almost doesn't notice Potter and the Grangers heading right for him.
face, which is true. Harry can't help but wonder how different their childhood would have been if Harry had understood that some of his actions when they were eleven were genuinely not meant to be cruel… He just had a slightly severe face
“I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I do not exist,” Harry says with a sense of irony. “So proud of the wizarding world for accomplishing what even my relatives couldn’t do, and finally made me hate my birthday.”
The suspect, Craig O'Keefe, was a forty-year-old man with perfect posture and salt and pepper hair slicked back who was followed by four nearly identical, perfect children. Even the wife was eerily perfect, her skin poreless and lineless as she walked silently around the town. No one greeted them strangely, but Harry couldn't help but get the overwhelming sense of dread from being near them.
Harry shrugs, “maybe some of it is about that. But some of it is… Maybe I’m a bit lonely. And you seemed lonely too. I feel like no one else is lonely anymore, they all settled down.”
Not an ideal situation, but he’s loathed to admit, deserved. He knows that the war wasn’t that long ago, and everyone still bears weight from it.
“Why are you being so nice to me?” Harry asks. “How are you not even a little mad, about everything.”
Draco steps forward and into Potter’s apartment; Potter closes the door behind him and impatiently looks at him.
“Wait,” Draco says, before gently twisting Harry around he’s facing their feet instead of Draco’s face.
He supposes he could try to discuss the time his aunt, Bellatrix, came down in fuzzy slippers and curlers in her hair while the Dark Lord was about to begin torturing an informant. It had been absurd, and Draco still sometimes laughs at the strange, awkward energy that moment created.
Harry sighs, looking around his living room before catching a glance at his fireplace. On the other hand… Draco's place would be empty for a few more hours. Warm and soft, he could nap for an hour and be out of Draco's place before he finished work. Then he could return home and dress up for their date later.
He can't believe that he aced every practical and written exam, had been ranked as the best dueler on the Auror team bar none,
Teddy's sound of pure delight nearly breaks Harry's eardrums, but he can't stop smiling when Teddy immediately slipped it on, so they were both matching. He feels more than sees how Draco practically melts against him in the face of the sheer cuteness that is Teddy Lupin.
“Well,” Harry says, a bit flustered, “he owns an olive oil company and said he’ll give me a lifetime supply.”
Draco shifts uneasily on his feet, “I was walking past the kitchen when you were talking to Granger.”
He wakes up to a pretty fantastic blow job that almost makes the day worth it, but Draco has an evil smirk on his face. For the past several weeks he’s clearly been plotting something, and Harry is slightly terrified. He hopes it isn’t going to end in an orgy of Harry Potter lookalikes.
Harry looks at him, very quiet and very serious. Before he leans over, slowly, giving Draco plenty of time to stop him- and that is when Draco realizes Harry Potter is about to kiss him.
Draco sighs in relief as soon as he steps out of the floo and into his home. It’s warm in a way that the Manor never was, large plush seats, and quilts. There is a television propped up, and a kitchen. It’s small, and even then it had taken nearly all of Draco’s protected funds to buy it but he had known the second he saw it that he loved it.
Ron stared at him for a moment, utterly lost for words, and for a second, Harry wondered whether Ron would call him insane. Ron had also gone through training, and there was no reason to believe that he wouldn't get through. He was an excellent dueler, a great strategist, and generally a wonderful person. Anyone would want him on their team.
Harry gives him a long, sarcastic look, and turns back to his office while saying, “perhaps the only time in my life I didn’t have problems when I was very briefly dead. Corpse Harry didn’t know how lucky he was.”
Draco just continues about his day, occasionally observing Potter who clearly has no intention of leaving.
The look Harry gives him could probably sear through metal. “Are you mental? Yes, Draco, I am ready. And if you don’t fuck me right this minute--”
He simply Polyjuiced in as a well-connected member of the town, snuck into the family's basement, and blew it up. He heard the city slowly wake from its slumber, and then he bound the family and called the Ministry.
And they do. They eat cake, and laugh, and play Quidditch. Teddy shows Harry that he can make his hair pink now, which fills Harry with a painful, but happy nostalgia at the thought of Tonks. Harry tears up again when he realizes they are on a beach vacation, Draco has rented a beach villa on Ibiza. Harry bloody loves the beach, which Draco knows.
With that, he reaches his hand up, and Fawkes comes diving in and vanishing them both in a column of fire.
Draco would love to help him, but Potter’s words are so garbled Draco can’t figure out what he’s trying to say.
"I told you, it's the results of your extensive personality test… And that, coupled with what happened two weeks ago…"
They sit in silence for another minute before Draco pulls Harry's head onto his chest to cuddle. "You are a great godfather, I know I mentioned it earlier, but it's true. Not the type of godfather I thought you'd be, what with the leather jackets and illicit broomsticks, but he adores you."
I hope that you loved this chapter as much as I loved writing it. Please leave kudos and comments and don’t hesitate even a little to share your thoughts!
“I know,” Pansy managed to get out between giggles. A few more bursts of laughter and she managed to get herself under control. She wiped the tears of laughter from her eyes and smirked at the bright red boy standing beside her. With a gentle shake of her head, she stood up from the lounge and pushed him aside. She began to gather her things, slipping a lace cover over her bathing suit.
“Are we getting rid of the Skrill?” Lily asked, turning to Nico with wide eyes as he climbed out of the Jeep. He looked up at her with a side smile.
“You knew then?” Victoire’s voice popped back in, followed quickly by her face as she pushed Lily to the side. Her expression was set in one of righteous fury on behalf of her friend. Slytherin though she may be, Victoire would always be a Weasley. “You knew about all this and have the nerve to say you’re on her side now? Who else knows? For Morgana’s sake, you’re adults! This is
“It’s just, she always said she would only give the place to family…Lily, how old are you again?” Theo’s brow furrowed in thought.
“See what you saw? Yes, you thimble.” Vic scoffed and rolled her eyes, pushing the taller man away from her. She reached down to straighten her pants and pull down her skirt, the mood long since effectively killed. She heard movement from in front of her implying Teddy was doing the same, but Vic couldn’t look directly at him just this moment.
