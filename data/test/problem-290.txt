"I'm just waiting for my husband, Draco Potter-Malfoy," I tell her quietly, trying not to intrude on the atmosphere of the place.
“You can always do us a favor, Draco,” I hear her soft whisper. “Everything will be forgiven for us, my dragon,” she caresses my cheek with the back of her hand. “Everyone will forgive us, you just have to do one single thing, my darling,” I can feel a kiss over my forehead.
My husband looks defeated.
I say to him, feeling my soul heavy.
"That's not true, Dray," I tell him, knowing full well that no one is one hundred percent good, or one hundred percent bad. "You are sweet, I have seen you with the children. Where this thing is coming from?" I am trying to understand really hard.
Let me know what you think. I was feeling like a melting marshmallow writting the final paragraph.
I hope you enjoy this with cheese balls, crackers and hot chocolate.
"I love you," I tell him once more, before standing up and following Hannah.
I hear the shower turn on and I walk into the bedroom, where Dray has left his little winged snake in the middle of our bed. The little annoyance immediately crawls under the covers and rolls up, becoming one with the sheets.
"See it with your own eyes, Severus," I tell him, lifting mine and looking into his.
"Just a little," I tell them. "It is normal. Daddy is healing, but healing takes time and effort, and sometimes it will hurt a lot. Sometimes it won't hurt at all, until it's completely healed." The children look at me and nod. "Do you have everything ready?"
"Well, Lucius, bring our guest of honor," she tells him with stern joy in her voice. His red eyes glinting.
"All that is in gold are memories that Narcissa acquired in some form during the period that she has been dead," says Hermione. "Or at least, our data says that."
I pull away from him and lay him on the sheets, my eyes drinking into his body, his marbled skin tinted with little pink specks on his cheeks and chest, as a red mark begins to bloom on his neck. I conjur the blindfold away from his visage to watch his dazed expression. The grey of his eyes, being swallowed by the black of his own desire.
I nod and then, I took her hand to apparate away, thinking about how bad is Dray’s mental health if his mind is surrounded by galaxy-like mist.
"Okay," I tell him, giving up. “If we get ready before I have to go to work, I'll take you to a place where they will looked after your pet. I promise,” Dray's gray eyes shine like two stars in the sky and I feel butterflies flutter in my stomach.
"How inconsiderate," Dray says indignantly, gently shaking his head. His rainbow-like-hair fluttering around his head. "But it's not different from what I have to do back in High School," he nods and a new smile blooms on his lips. "And you, what color used your borrowed family?"
Draco produces a gold colored box and he smiles knowing what is inside. It is Teddy's fourteenth birthday and for purebloods the introduction to society. But, I know that for Draco this is more than just that. What's inside the box is a locket with the Lupin and Black's crest attached by a cape and inside of the jewel, a photograph of Tonks and Remus together.
"You are a hero, then," Dray told me with a small smile playing at his lips.
"Yeah. Usually, kids with issues are the only ones who has to seek out some kind of outlet. My dad thought it was good for me to go somewhere. I was always picking fights in school and I was a four years old with a lot of attitude. Got expelled from my kinder garden, twice," I listen to him with rapt attention. "Until dad hauled me into his car one Sunday and dropped me at the Academy. I had a lot of time to think that day. I thought dad didn't love me anymore because I got myself expelled from another toddler school."
“You are allergic to its feathers, champion. You can get very sick if you go near the Bohs,” I tell my youngest son in the softest tone I can find. "If we see a Croup I'll let you pet it," I tell him in a conciliatory tone.
Hermione told me once that my power will reach the same amount Harry has. Because that will make us equally, and she said that Argenti never stops developing their magical cores, until they died and transforms themselves and their soulmates into stars.
Comments and kuddos are appreciated. You make me a happy writter whenever you left your comments for me to read.
“Even if Tom believes is a good idea bring Gellert back from the death, I still can defeat him, dear Severus,” he says all-matter of fact. “I am not afraid of the person I shared a bed with once.”
And even though my eyes feel hot and there's a large piece of cotton stuck in my throat, I can't help something warm from emerging inside my heart. A smile finds a new home on my lips. This is the right thing to do. Bring joy with our hands, with our instruments, with our voices, for all those who have not been able to be happy, for all who have not been able to see one more day... But, especially, for all those who have struggled without power to see a new day. And for all those who will live with the horrible memories of being in a place like this, being eaten alive by a disease that seems to win the battle every day and of which no one is sure that it will abandon you until the day you die.
"What if…?" He starts again, and I push him down the Weasley's chimney.
"How do you do it?" Draco asks me and I feel my heart begin to beat strongly in my chest with the shock that I have taken. "Can you teach me?" I smile at the blonde.
READ THE WARNINGS
I take him in my arms, pinning both of his arms to his sides, using my owns. I lower us softly to the floor, whispering sweet nothing to his ear, while he keeps crying for help. But whatever is attacking him is not visible to any of us. I still remember how Aunt Petunia used to rub Dudley’s arm when he was trying to take the scab out of his own wounds. She rubbed softly and whispered things.
I nod again, breathing through my nose. I need to trust this guy, in order for Draco to be better again. So, he can snarks at me for my commoner manners in the table or my horrendous choices in robes… Or tastes in general.
I glance briefly at the people in the room and lift my son off the floor and place him on my hip.
An owl flies up to him, its night-black plumage and amber-yellow eyes, it appears to be examining the shoulder of the new human in the tent. The owl hoots softly and then its head crashes softly against the blonde's cheek.
“They were a hallucination,” I whisper shily to him, not wanting to burst his bubble of happiness. “And I am sorry that whoever made this to you is opening wounds that were healing somewhat, somehow.” I caress his hair with my bare hands, knowing he is like a big white cat, loving to have people play with his hair.
Until then, only a few of us will know what Dray Black is.
"And what is your name, junior assistant?" one of the boys says to him.
And so it's how I want to live this short life. Giving, forgiving, sharing...
"Harry," Hermione says rudely. "He is dead. Dumbledore killed him himself."
But we don’t need Harry, the Honorary Weasley. The Asset need The Harry Potter, the one that was once an orphan. The one that was beaten up when he was a kid, and dumb enough to thrust in someone like fucking Dumbledore.
“We need to help him,” the joy fairy says, his wings flapping agitatedly.
For a moment I think he will mentioning: For helping Harry, but he doesn't. I am pretty sure Draco might be able to duel against Dumbledore and still manage to hurt him with cheer power of will. My magic is crackling inside me, screaming to defend my mate, my better half... But I cannot give in. He is good and he is strong, I have to trust in him.
"And what were you doing today?" I ask him, squeezing his hand in mine.
“Which houses,” he asks me softly.
“Yeah. That’s your power in action,” he lets me know in a soft whisper. “You didn’t kill her. You just… did your job.”
“Draco, my darling.” My mother’s voice is calling me to wake up.
Ron nods.
Two pieces later, three male singers appear, also dressed as princes. Teddy watches them intently, his little hands trying to clap in time to the music. Suddenly the man throws a raspberry at us with his tongue and the whole place erupts with laughter.

Draco is really defying her now.
"What time is this thing again?" Ron asks, holding four rectangles in his right hand.
Head-Auror looks at her. He is really lost there.
"I didn't know there was a community of wizards in Switzerland," Hagrid says thoughtfully.
I raise my wan and I pointed it towards the woman rocking in the floor.
"War? What war? " he asks and I see the pain in his eyes. “No matter what it is or how many things you say I can do, I will not kill anyone. What would my mother or my father think of me?"
"You may leave, Auror Potter, we will continue this in two days," Robards tells me, patting me on the back. "They will be fine, Potter."
It reminds me all the thing Harry has scaped from his mouth during our dates. Voldemort always trying to capture Harry, hurting him, degrading him with words… Wasn’t it enough with taking his parent away from him while he was just a baby? Then, the trap in sixth year to hurt him. Killing another boy in his haste to hurt my soulmate.
"Ron," Harry and Hermione scold him at the same time.
My heart hurts inside my chest at the pain my kid is feeling. I let my magic wander around until I feel it brushing softly against James' and Draco's. Draco looks up to me and I know, I am so concerned that my feelings are pouring down our bond.
No. It's not like Nesha. It is something worse.
"You're torturing him," Shacklebolt yelled at Moody, who is still holding his wand. I feel the tears go down my cheeks, and I see a layer of pearl sweat on Dray's forehead. "Please, Dray," I whisper, pressing him closer to my body.
(See the end of the chapter for
"My wife has been dead for years, Harry," he tells me harshly. "I think it is time for me to seek my own happiness, even if that makes you uncomfortable."
I look at her, trying to figure out what's going on.
I laugh at my Mother’s words.
All of us nod and then, we are reaching for portkeys to Bretagne, France.
"Leave it as it is, Harry," I tell the boy who stole my heart from the first moment we met. "I promise you that in my eyes you are the most handsome man on the entire planet."
Harry smiles at me, but he makes no effort to touch me.
Severus looks at her, but he doesn't smile at her, he just nods. And once her silhouette disappears, the pain returns.
He nods softly and tugs me in Hermione’s direction. She guides us through corridors in Saint Mungo’s until we stop ten minutes later. She stops, but her hand isn’t even close to the handle. She is stalling.
“I know you are one of the good ones,” he points. “And I know it because your hair is as blond as the one in the head of a newborn,” he says softly. “Were you a bad Argentum, it will earn a few grey strands. Not as shinny and soft looking as your hair.”
Enjoy.
"Dad was a pureblood, right?" I asks Sirius, glancing at him out of the corner of my eye.
The light in this palce makes me nervous. This is the kind of places Dudley used to talk about when we were kids. The same places aunt Petunia wouldn't let me accompanied them because I am a freak.
HARRY
I nod softly.
She is the crazy one. Oh, my bad. She is the crazier one. Not even her tarty lord is as crazy as she is. How is the saying going? Yeah, two peas in a pod.
"So what does your lover think of us?" Ron asks me. "Although I assume that from the goofy smile you came with this morning, we didn't give him such a bad impression."
“I am not asking you to apologize for your actions, but for what we have forced him to do. The destiny is hard to change, Albus, but the feelings... They are like raw honey, ready to be changed to somethig else, something sweeter,” her head points to the ground. "Regulus," she says, raising her head. "Thanks for taking care of Dray." She says to me like she's doing the world a favor.
And all because of Bellatrix Lestrange.
"But, here we are," Regulus tells me. "Trying to win a war that was never started by us, nevermind the things we believe in."
Hermione bites her lip and Ron looks at her, like he can get the secrets of the world out of her with just that look.
“I am really sorry, Harry,” he says, patting my shoulder. “I knew he wasn’t trustworthy at all. No one lose as much as him and comes back unscathed.”
"No, I am not resented about that," I asnwer her question, because I am not mad at Malfoy, I am mad at myself for not being able to make myself forget how Draco Malfoy looks at his most vulnerable moments. The way his eyes turns the same shade of  a blue sky in a summer day; whenever he is sitting reading, the way he looks up, trying to give sense to the things he is pondering inside that beautiful mind of his.
Ron nods softly.
he cross his arms over his chest.
"But… Severus," the Dark Lord looks at him and his red eyes sparkle. “You're not the type to come here to tell me mere news and rumors, especially not when good old Lucius is by your side. Especially not when your brother is by your side."
"Oh, do you have magic too, like Harry?" I ask him, feeling something warm inside my chest.
"I appreciate it, Molly, but I'm already seeing someone, thanks though," and he smiles at my mother. "It's still recent we've only been out once," but even so, his eyes are shining.
I open my eyes to find ever changing ones. His hair is a sandy blond and he is well build. He seems to be in his early twenties just like me and Harry.
Magdy hits me with her notebook on the head.
And when I open them again, I'm back in Harry's living room. I try to move and the first twinge in my head makes me stop, while the nausea hits me full.
"This, Harry," Hermione begins solemnly. “This is Narcissa Black's consciousness. Each of the objects that flow through this river have a memory of her life, while she was alive, and others belong to her memories of when she was dead. "
"I know," he says quietly.
Amid green flames, Harry disappears.
"I'm fine mate," I tell him, putting a smile on my lips.
Dray nods softly, his movement diplomatic but relaxed allowing me to let my guard down slightly. Although I'm not entirely sure where we are, the reality is that the magic of this place doesn't feel hostile. And so, I don't need the compulsion to ready myself to strike.
"That was your grandfather's nineteenth wand," Garrick tells him. “Great man, very smart. Enchantment maker, his wands usually exploded. It was his magic taking care of his body," Olivander says as he always does.
Yei, now enjoy of this... Chapter.
“Something like mangled corpse left in the open for wizards to see. All of them halfbloods. All of them tortured, all of them porting the Dark Mark,” Kinsgley says, and I wonder when did came close to me. “The most horrible corpse yet is Ritta Skitter’s.”
Hermione looks at me, her eyes full of evil and mischief.
Enjoy with cookies and warm milk
"Some very nice things," he tells me in a serious tone, as he cuts a part of his hand with the bread knife. Immediately, my heart races, my muscles tense, and my magic coils within my own core, preparing, getting ready… To put our soul mate back to safety. But, before I can move, Draco takes his wand out of his sleeve, waving it gently and gracefully. "Vulnera Sanentur," he says softly, and I watch the wound close and leave perfect white skin in its wake. “Madame Pomfrey says that I have abilities to heal. She says that it is in my on my own nature."
Kreacher appear in front of me.
I feel Draco turn around in my arms and his forehead collides gently against my shoulder and I hold my husband against my chest.
However, the seriousness on Dray's face makes me swallow hard. That look is so similar to the one Cissy gave people when she was trying to peacefully and strategically process some awkward situation, as a pureblood should.
I raise my eyes to think about in the Pratt girl, but what welcomes me is the sight of warms creeping out of Mother’s arms, while a lot of blood gushes out of the wounds, lithering her perfect snowy skin.
I carefully lay him down on our bed and put up a ward in our room, one that will let us know if the kids are around, and then I throw a muffin around us, making the sounds in the room impossible to go out, but letting us hear everything from the outside. I climb onto the bed and cover my husband's semi-nude body with mine and lean in to kiss his lips. And Dray doesn't disappoint me, his lips part, giving me permission to explore his warm, wet cavity.
"Uh..." Harry looks at me like he's trying to see inside my brain. His stare is blank for a few minutes, then they are sparking again. "Yes."
"Good morning, class," I say formally, my face serious. "I think you already met my assistant for the day." I stands next to Scorpius and he immediately smiles at me.
Kreacher bows happily and disappear.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Rosse Cottage is a well-known place because wizards who are no longer human lives in there," Blaise replies in a serious tone. "They are dangerous magicians, and although the address says Rosse Cottage, it is not a small house ..." And I see him look ahead.
OCTOBER 9th, 2002
And what an odd coincidence.
"No, he loves me more," Scorpius says seriously.
"I don't respond to you, witch," Severus hisses. His dark eyes completely dead, like the body of his wife.
We start walking in the visible path of dirt again. And my thoughts wander until Hermione catches them.
I smile, as I feel his hand relax and I squeeze it between my fingers.
His eyes are shinning wickedly.
This is material from my nocturnal fantasies.
“We talked about it, but I have been away in cases recently,” I say, knowing for a fact that no one in the wizarding world calls for these things. “I just came back a few days ago.”
I can see the surprise in his face, which is weird.
I look again at what Harry is wearing today. A sweater that I had never seen before, but that does not fit two sizes bigger than him, pants that are not so tight, but are not torn or holed anywhere and...
I beg for him to hear me.
"I love you and I want you," I tell him, looking into his eyes. His flushed cheeks and glazed gaze tell me everything I need to know. "Don't think you're less beautiful or desirable because of a couple of scars, Draco, because that's not true."
Harry is preocupied. Draco is happy, even if his magic is giving him troubles.
I can see his amusement even if I cannot listen to it, and I feel something warm spread inside my chest.
Blaise rolls his eyes and looks at me like I'm stupid.
"What legacy do you mean, Minister?" the question escapes ‘Mione's lips before I can ask it.
“What if I draw you what I see,” I say to him, taking my wand in my hands.
Yesterday I took two exams of 3 hours each and today the results are out... 100/100 in both exams.
I look at Pansy and Neville. The sorrow of Professor Longbottom is heavy in the air. Bellatrix is not different then Voldemort. She made Neville and orphan too. The difference is that Neville, maybe, has a chance to see them. But, again, there is not much difference between having a set of death parents and a set of shell-like parents. None of them has the chance to share their victories, stone miles or love with the people that loved them the most in the world.
“Why weren’t the wizards-like-police trying to catch him?” I am still trying to make heads and tails from this situation.
"They are the children of Harry Potter," I hear a witch say.
I take a deep breath and let go of everything around me to focus on Harry’s smile.
My mother smiles to me while she extends her hand for me to take it.
“He is sleeping again,” Goldstein says, sighing. “I have never seen anything like this,” he says seriously. “And I am pretty sure, Mason either.”
Ron looks at me, and seconds later, Hermione arrives with a book levitating behind her with a tea service.
Even if Voldemort knowing Dray is an Argentum, I am sure patience is not one of his freaking virtues. But, rambling… Rambling surely is.
“It should be like living in hell,” I tell her.
I love comments and kuddos, and I will be extra happy today and the entire week if you left those for me.
"Thank you, Kingsley," I tell him sincerely. "See you tomorrow."
That means I'm late. I look at Scorpius and he smiles at me.
my own mind supplies me.
"He will be ok, but the wound cannot be healed by magic and it will scar, like yours, Mr. Potter," Smart-Lady Healer says and she taps on her forehead. "Sadly, we cannot close this with magic, since it was inflicted with magic. But he will be ok. In the meantime, I suggest you to take that knife to a curse breaker, that is some serious damage he suffered there. I am pretty sure he couldn't even feel the pain, not when he was making the cut, nor when he was bleeding to death." Mason looks one last time towards Draco and smiles to him. "We will make you all better again, darling. Don't you worry. Your friends in here will going to kick the ass of whomever coursed you."
The Not-Draco look at us, his eyes moving from one side to the next.
Harry hisses in the snake's tongue somewhat briefly. Snake tongue, that's what Hermione said. Although her theory is closer to the fact that Harry and his bully share a certain kind of magic.
"Room three, and no crazy noises," he says in frustration. "I will deduct it from your Gringotts account and collect a tax for being so annoying."
Give us a try.
Being the seventh child, especially in a pure line, is something that fills your magic center with an amount of power that is stupidly great. Not to mention that The Younger Black must be a necromancer or sorcerer. A child of the magic herself.
"I said be quiet," Hermione says in a serious tone, her eyes accusing us. She resumes the march and we follow behind her like the good friends that we are, or perhaps it is more due to the fact that no one wants to get lost in the Unspeakables level.
“Who is him?” An Asian woman, with straight, long hair is looking at me.
At least, this big human-size like cage is enough to let me seat cross-legged without having to keep my head down. That really suck, because even if I am not a tree, I have been in enough uncomfortable places with little thresholds to last me a life.
"Harry!" I hear Ginny's voice loud and clear, as she descends the stairs of the Burrow with speed and then throws herself on Harry, who catches her and stumbles backwards. "At last!" Ginny says leaving a loud kiss on Harry's cheek and holding him in her arms. “I thought you would never come back for me. Did you come to ask me to marry you? " she asks, detaching herself from the black-haired man.
I let the memory drop in a piece of paper.
Unless… He's actively trying to bring Dray to the Wizarding World. If Voldemort is searching for the kid, why give him the oportunity to see him in the middle of the Ministry? The only eplanation an auror can give for that is... Ambush.
Obediently, Dray does what I've told him to do and when he swallows, I'm the one who can't suppress the guttural sound escaping my throat.
I look at all the people around the table, which I don't remember that much. I sit next to Hermione and look at Ron, who seems to be inhaling his food. Mrs. Weasley leaves a plate full of food in front of me and when I lift my eyes Zephora Zambroni is sitting in front of me. Her open eyes show irises as white as milk, a unique contrast compared to her tan skin.
"Morning," I say to Draco, as his delicate hands close around my waist. "Did you sleep well?" I ask him, turning to place a kiss on his lips and ...
A good bitch my ass.
“You don’t need to know anything else?” I ask him, not believing him at all.
"Harry," Hannah calls from the other end of the hall, and I approach her as fast as I can. "Harry, I told you. He's fine,” she tells me with a smile on his lips.
I have come to this place whenever I need to be away from my home or Grimmauld Place. This place and the Poza de Chompa are the only two places that I know of that have an area for both: Muggles and magicians, within the same building. And that's because, in Chompa's case, she is a witch who married a Muggle, but here at Lauren’s Place… I know Lauren is a Muggle, but her child and grandchildren are wizards, the mother of a witch and she didn't saw Harry Potter the first time we met, she saw a kid that needed a room. Most purebloods don't come here, too dirty for their tastes. And even those who tolerate Muggles don't come that often, they don't know how to really behave in the presence of a Muggle.
I sigh and the door opens and Blaise Zabini comes in with his unspeakable robes all over him and the most serious face I've ever seen in the whole world.
"Ronald Weasley, you are the best," Dray says about excited and almost falling out of laughter, as he looks at nowhere in particular.
"Dray, you'll keep using your name," Albus tells him, waving his wand and swapping the Hufflepuff logo for Hogwarts. Remember, you're part of the Ministry, and you're looking to gather information for the school that Muggle-born children will attend before they have to start here,” says Dumbledore. “Harry will accompany you to each of the classes you wish to see today, and tomorrow Ronald Weasley will do it for him, and they will take turns until this week is over. I ask you to take it very seriously, not only because you must live for the role, but because what you can give us information will be useful to help the other wizards and witches who will attend this school."
The door opens and my three children enter through it. Teddy has black hair like me, a pair of silver highlights like Draco's and another pair of chocolate brown, like Remus' hair.
Hermione appears in the middle of the kitchen with Ron by her side.
"Okay?" Dray asks me and then shakes his head quickly. "Okay. I will bathe once I have eaten breakfast.”
"You were saying?" a lopsided smile set firmly on his face.
"Dray," I whisper again. I wish I can cast Lumos, but that would only help Draco shut down and it is the last thing I want. For now, I want my husband to remember that he can trust me. That I will never hurt him willingly.  "Love, talk to me."
"I thought no one knew about me," I hear Dray say as I move a little closer to the room. Molly still strangling the boy with love.
So, if you let me know how are you all doing, I will be glad to read you and write a response. Comments makes my day better.
His voice is a whisper and I know he is okay. While being in captivity with Voldemort, Dray was unable to form any real though, less think about his favorite song.
"Hi," he says, a slight blush covering his cheeks. "Is there anything I can do for you?" he asks me, as he stands up, practically hugging his instrument.
The soft whimper of the Occamy, the Asset’s daughter, reaches my ears and I send a wave of magic to her. There’s no fucking difference between my magic and the other’s Harry magic.
I watch Ron stare at the ceiling and immediately I feel the uncertainty escalate within me. This cannot be normal. I mean, there are things no one knows about Draco or Narcissa Black. Because Narcissa Black got pregnant without being married, it must have been one of the worst things that should have happened to her. However, with the names on the board right now...
“Did not you know, Mr. Weasley?” Smart-Healer asks Ron.
I nod, so he continues.
"Who are you looking at?" Hannah asks me, as she leans against the bar to have a better view. I try to shake my head, but Hannah is not going to swallow that story today. Not when her eyes have already found the only other person inside the premises. "You like him?"
"Of course there is some true to it, Harry," he tells me in a serious tone. "And I am!" says the blonde, waving his arms wildly. “When I dress up as Santa at Christmas, I become Santa, because I continue to keep his spirit alive and his desire to do good. I may be the shortest Santa in the universe, but I assure you that the children in that hospital care very little if I am the shortest in the world. And I swear to you Harry, nothing is more precious to me than seeing them smile... Or you,” his voice is so calm, I feel like we are having our first date once again.
"His name is Dray Black, he is a musician from the Muggle world," says the reporter between sobs. How pathetic, really. “He is a cellist, and he is recognized internationally for being something of a musical genius. It is all that I know."
“Because you tarnished our home with blood of wizards,” I shout at him. “And you want to know something, pureblood or not, they were actually part of your family. I hadn’t forgot that you and Xenophilus Lovegood are brothers-in-law because Pandora Malfoy was part of this family too. I hadn’t forgot how lovely she was towards me the first time I met her. She was a better witch than you, but she raised her kid to be better. And I hadn’t forgot that Xenophilus is as pureblooded as you are, and so are the Weasleys. And they are your family too, aren’t they?” I can feel the blood rushing to my face. “You just had one son because Mother couldn’t conceive other. I hadn’t forgot about Astra, the one that should be my sister,” I lower my voice because I can hear it echoing inside the house. “We are the ones who are impure. If it weren’t for magic, we wouldn’t even be alive. Astra was born as a squib and she didn’t survive because a so bad genetic can just kill a child on its own. And even if you too come from a really ancient house and other nonsenses you are so happy to believe and babble about, I am still not the most powerful wizard in the world. And neither was Voldemort,” I am angry. Angry. Angry. “He was a halfblood, his father was a moodblood, and still you cowered under his gaze and if he told you to suck his cock you willingly would do it. So, don’t ever come to me and talk about bullshit you really don’t understand,” I take a deep breathe and I close my eyes, trying to collect myself.
"I'm not an invalid who needs to stay home, Harry," he tells me, as his cheeks turn pink and a pair of tears escapes from his eyes. "I had a month of disability, and I'm really tired of being treated like a if I'm missing a leg. Because I have both of them, thank you very much."
I send my magic toward Hermione, wrapping her around it, while she hugs herself. I am pretty sure her heart is aching like mine, just because we both love this man, in different levels, but with the same affection.
“I could ask him, Kingsley, but in the end the decision is his. This world is oblivious to anything he knows,” I tell him, trying to sound as neutral as possible. On second thought, I should seem a bit more frustrated though. "He's just a Muggle, and he still doesn't know all the terms or laws of this society... Cult, as he sometimes calls what we are," although that was only once, the people in this room must not know.
"You are also very handsome as well," she replies, and it is the strangest thing I have ever seen.
"Harry," Mrs. Weasley greets me once I enter the dining room. "Have breakfast. There's a little bit of everything."
“Ay, Drakey Poo, did you know that Dumbledore actually hurt your soulmate back when he was a child?” she asks me slowly. “He did leave him with those rotten excuses of human beings, and they did beat your soulmate into submission. They didn’t care about him. Dumbledore didn’t care about him, until he needed Harry. Did you know that Dray?” Her hand is caressing my hair and I open my eyes to see inside her eyes. They are cruel and dead. “Your father, Regulus, tried so hard to keep you hidden from Dumbledore. Do you remember how did you meet the old man?”
What a joke that one, really.
Teddy sits between Draco and me and forces us to separate. Immediately, each twin sits on either side of Teddy. Draco kisses Teddy and James, and I'm in charge of making Scorpius laugh. That's the only thing we do for a couple of minutes.
"3 pm?" I ask him.
She pats him gently on the back and stands behind him, grabbing him by the hips, supporting Draco's weight. Until my husband puts his hands on both railings and the pressure on her subsides.
Dray turns and gets on his hands and knees.
And I can see love shining in the depths of his silver orbs. I take his hand in mine and left a kiss on the palm. Dray blushes, but his smile tightens and the flame of his magic is kindled.
My heart stops beating.
"Yes, rest well, young Argentum," I hear a voice hissing inside my head. "You will do my bind, soon." I panic as cold, red eyes of snake stares at me. An unmerciful grip is squeezing my chest hard, searching, scorching.
Harry
“We need the Horcruxes now, Granger,” Pansy says, extending his hand.
I look at Robards, who looks as sour as an old lemon.
"Watch out for the Duke, sweetie," Magdy says, as she sets the burgers on the table. "Mark decided orange juice for you," she places the glass of orange liquid in front of me. “You don't want your dad to murder you in your dreams for hurting his heir,” she tells Ron.
"To France," Robards replies. "You and your team will be in charge of put together a safe house for the boy in France."
"I hadn't bathe," I say mother and I can feel the blood traveling to my cheeks.
Well… Their faces are a bit ugly. And that is a pity comment coming out of me, because I can see their crazy faces, the hungry for killing, their lust to ravage all the good things out of me.
he says, tightening his hold on my hand.
I try raising over my own kness and then, letting my weight fall down.
“Why no one has said anything to us?” Robards asks.
“I need a scarf from Fleur and a necklace from Victoire,” he says seriously.
I look him in the eyes and I can feel my spine tingling. This shit is not gonna end good.
OCTOBER 30th, 2002
And I realize that I don't really have furniture, and that this place looks more like I'm getting ready to get out of here than to start living in it.
Ron looks at her and I know I have the same look on my face: Processing.
“I am sorry, baby,” I say to him, holding him to me and helping him out of the couch.
Draco let his head rest on my shoulder, and I inhaled his scent deeply, feeling warm and loved.
I watch him throw his head back as he laughs at something she tells him and my blood freezes in my veins. Dray says something to her and she quickly shakes her head, shiny black hair moving with that simple movement.
"Stay with me," he tells me in a whisper, trying to move and only manages to move his head.
I am sure that she is capable of finding out who her missing nephew is and why Voldemort yearns to have him in his terrorist group as soon as possible.
"You brought what I asked of you, Regulus," she says and extends her elegant hand.
"It's Harry Potter," the people around me start whispering my name and Dray looks at them all strangely.
“What Harry The First said can be true?” Hermione asks me, pinning the dozens notes my evil twin left for us.
And I see Draco turn around and head towards the Muggle fridge in the house.
And just a couple of meters further on, I can see a bright blond head sitting on the grass, a dark colored blanket is the only thing that separates him from the cold ground. From this distance, he seems so fragile and small and my heart contracts at the thought that he is fragile compared to a wizard. However, the little spark of magic inside him makes me feel hope.
Crap. This is how obscurials are born.
"Reggie," Sirius whispers. "But…"
(See the end of the chapter for
Bitch.
I nod as I open the door and see my three children. Side by side and another child, who might be the same age as the twins.
"That's one disappearance every week," Wood whispers. "Or so."
I nod and run as fast as I can towards the apparition point so I can appear at Saint Mungo’s. The next thing I know, I am standing in Saint Mungo’s.
A giant guitar.
Bellatrix
"Ewwwk" says Scorpius.
"That's no ordinary snake, Harry," the girl next to me tells me. "That snake is magical, it is a Python Choralis E."
"What if I hurt Scorpius, or Teddy, or James one day, the same way my parents hurt me?" his voice is barely a whisper that I can hear because everything around us is completely silent.
Yeah, the prat is a fucking genius.
"I love you, very much," I tell him again, closing my eyes, feeling like Nesha peak her tongue against my fingertips in support. "And I love you too, Nesha," I hiss to the occamy.
"Converse are soft shoes, Ronald," he tells me, turning his eyes back to where Harry and Charlie are. "Harry," Mione calls him, as I watch dishes dance from one place to another and most of my brothers and their respective partners sit at the table. "Where did you disappear yesterday? You said you would come back and then, only your Patronus appeared outside the bar. ”
"What is Firewhiskey?" he asks me.
Dray smiles at me.
I kiss his forehead and pulling him towards me, holding him securely between my arms. My magic thrums around me and I can feel like if a soft wind is colliding playfully against it. This is Dray’s magic. All soft edges, warm and child-like happiness.
One who shall never be spoke of in this household anymore. The one who caused the young wielder of magic to wilt in his eagerness to make him less like his own lover.
“Ok, Mister Potter,” he says, conjuring a low chair. “I know you are really powerful if the tales are something to go by, but please, refrain from interfering.”
“He is healer Davidson,” smart-healer lady says.
"It doesn't matter. Every stone left unturned is a stone Voldemort might like to turn just to acquire what he wants." I mutter. "He was in the Outter Circle of the Death Eaters."
Harry
“Draco is sustaining the Never-Ending Winter Curse,” she says sadly. “I actually cannot pronounce those Greek words and all their weird letters, but that is what means for us.”
"I'm paying attention to you," Dray tells him in the most innocent way in the world, because it's a gesture Muggles use to get other people's attention when they're not paying attention. "I promise."
And what I see makes me turn my face away from Kingsley instantly.
I blush deeply when I hear Draco's tone, authoritative and without room for doubt. I take off the uniform of the aurors and everything else, until I am in my boxers.
"We can go to Grimmauld after this, check if Draco Black shows up there," Ron tells me again.
I shake my head softly.
arthur's words makes me laugh heartily.
"Do you think he remembers telling Uncle Bill to send his patronus to tell Papa that ...?" however, Scorpius's words linger there, as Bill's patronus, a silver dolphin, appears.
However, the whole world ceases to exist when I see Dray in the official Hogwarts uniform, precisely that of the Hufflepuff house. And I can't help but smile from sticking to my lips.
And the moment it is open it starts to disintegrate. Shackles raises from the ceiling, holding me in place.
"Edward deserves to remember that they will always be by his side, no matter what, Harry," the memory bring tears to my eyes and I blink quickly.
Harry
"Whatever his reasons are he needs the child alive," Shacklebolt intervene. "So, we keep him alive and safe. And we train him to aid us in this war."
“They don’t know that, Harry,” her words sounding against my chest. “I just cannot understand.”
"If trying to speak to your husband while we are in the room, the magic will force you to shut up and if trying to enter where the healers are, the magic will also prevent you from doing it," she tells me in a serious tone, as she stands up. “Come with me, Mr. Potter. Remember, no talking or trying to interrupt the session."
“The mood-blood,” the crazy woman with the ugly wand says. “The mood-blood that is friend with Harry Potter. We hate mood-bloods.”
"Did my dad play for the green team?" he asks me in a serious tone. "And why does he always tell me that green is a color that he doesn't like, if he spent a whole year, or maybe more dressed in green?" his arms are crossed in front of his arms and his eyes look at the photograph as if he could set it on fire with just that thought, which is why I search for something to say quickly.
"Am I not special to you?" he asks me pouting.
“Stop it, you crazy, you are gonna gouge someone’s eyes any moment now,” I tell her, not caring a shit, because if I am going to die today, I at least, want to enjoy dragging some people with me down.
But, Harry…
"No love. It's not a dream or an illusion,” I tell him, stroking his cheek.
He bends down to kiss me and I let myself be engulfed with the warm magic of my only and true love.
“Dray!” I call again, peering inside the place. It’s immaculate as ever. “Hey,” I say knocking softly on the wall. A bad habit, really.
“Not the ones that are surrounding the house, Draco.” I swallow hard, because I know this is not over. “The ones in the yard were sporting a hole. A dog could walk inside the property.” Suddenly Draco left all his weight fall on me and immediately I hold him tight against me. “You ok?”
he asks me with the letter spell. His letters are a sharp blue.
“Why?” Ron asks me again.
Severus laughs next to me.
"It's the best food I've ever had," says Ron, as he begins to chew like a pig.
"His eyes ..." I say in a whisper. "Dray is the one who has been protecting my mind for the past few months."
"Dray Black is alive," I tell him in a serious tone.
"I think they're just attacking her, when others ask, they don't say anything scary," Cooper tells me. "Maybe, because they don't ask toxic questions."
“He must be amazing then,” the dark-haired man adds. “By protocol I can just accompany you all until here,” he adds softly. “I will stablish a perimeter here with other members of the AUS in case you need instant backups,” he murmurs. “Just send a patronus and will be there.”
Draco
“I did it to win his favor,” my father says in a heaty whisper.
Orbs as gray as the sky on a stormy day hover over Albus Dumbledore. Pressing. Challenging.
Here it is... Let me know what you think and leave kuddos. And comments too, I am happy when there are comments.
"Is he a werewolf?" Molly asks.
"I know he is the youngest member of the London Symphony Orchestra." I mumble, I really don't understand much about what Dray does.
Again, water starts to fall on my hair and once that process is over, I feel closer to reality. A substance is put into my hair and Draco combs my curls back with his fingers.
“Well, he is just a professor in potion class,” I resume, looking at Mason straight in the eye. “He is not, theoretically, an auror. Even if he can perform a few tricks, he is not. He is a potion master,” And I am glad because this time Hermione doesn’t make me stop mid-sentence. “He is a consultant for Aurors and the Wizengammot, but he is not an Auror.” I can feel something stirring inside my gut. “And if we are together, we are not violating any rule or law, because he is not an auror,” I hiss the last one.
What? Why?
My gaze is fixed on Regulus Black and his always passive countenance. Always serene.
"Don't worry, Harry," the gray-haired woman tells me, as she puts two huge cups on the counter. "You will love to die."
Enjoy with cookies and hot chocolate.
“Harry did,” I say seriously.
And… Yes.
I stare at Hermione and Ron. Mione is sitting by my side and Ron is on one of the armchairs of the bedroom.
The walls, painted a soft mint color, welcome me and I immediately feel peace.
I move around the kitchen as we finish putting everything together for breakfast. I hear the stairs creak and in a matter of seconds the kitchen is invaded by little troublemakers.
"That's impossible, Harry," Robards tells me. "It is impossible because Regulus Black died before Voldemort murdered your parents."
his voice is dark and I shiver.
"That was months ago," I tell him.
“Harry,” I hear Hermione voice. “I need to talk to you, about…” And she and Ron stop in their tracks, looking at the women. “The case.”
"Minerva, Alastor," Sirius says in a serious tone. "Would you leave us alone?"
Zephora nods and I feel sick.
“Someone tampered with his magical core,” he says, moving his wand over the parchment. “It says so in here.”
I stop to look at the object, they are a pair of small celestial wings with golden edges.
"Okay, Edward's card needs to be finish," Draco announces, over the sound of laughter from our children, who are trying to get frosting in each other's faces.
“Draco,” I hear my mother’s voice calling me softly, but I don’t want to open my eyes. The warm sun feels inviting and I can feel myself drifting into unconsciousness, ready to take a nap. “Draco,” I hear her soft voice again, but this time it sounds away.
This is gonna go to shit and fast. The Other Harry is emerging, trying to keep our magic at bay and for the first time in a while, I am gonna embrace my other half.
I bend down and remove the Adidas he is wearing and carefully put his feet onto the bed. I conjure a blanket from one of the cabinets and tuck him in with it. It is cold and in the brief time that I was disconcerted chatting with the enchanted head, Dray managed to absorb the cold of the place.
Enjoy with sandwiches (they are so yummy with butter and jam and cheese) and milk!
And after a few seconds, Draco settled.
"Sure, we were bron ready," I say to her, scooting close. Soothing my own nerves with power.
Wow, for me quidditch never was this confusing. But I am giving points to my boyfriend because he is catching up to speed pretty fast.
Harry
However, I don't give it much time. I wrap my arms around his delicate body.
The reactions are instantaneous.
REGULUS BLACK
“That I am an orphan and that I have no family. I am the Harry Potter's charity case,” ends Teddy. His eyes on the ground.
, Narcissa's words, not like this. But, close.
I appear in the middle of Grimmauld Place’s kitchen. Molly is the first person my eyes lands on. By her side is Mr. Weasley and Ginny, her eyes are red and she is pale.
"Oh," is all I can say. "Teddy didn't tell me that." I say in a resigned tone.
"Dray. Dray Black,” he says still standing.
“I am not a bad Argentum,” I say vehemently.
Left comments and kuddos, they make my day all better!
Harry looks at me with panicky green eyes.
“Come for me, love,” I whisper against his ear and from one moment to the next, my husband's semen hits my chin, my abdomen and my husband's and Draco drops his head on my shoulder. His insides tense and loosen and I continue with the thrusts. Three, four thrusts later and I cum inside my husband. My body relaxes completely and I smile, feeling water spill over my hair and down my neck.
Draco arch a slender, golden eyebrow at me.
But then, Dray is nothing more than a ball of love and energy that cannot be easily contained.
I hear Mr. Collins laugh.
HARRY
“We know he is coming to finish you,” the Asian girl says.
Harry breaks Dray's seal and makes him reborn.
Everyone is seating, but no one is actually doing much then looking at their own, empty plates. What a bunch of weirdos.
"Now while we're there, everyone should stay calm," and she looks at me, as if for some strange reason I'm going to break someone's neck. "And I am serious, Harry."
Send my love to you all guys.
"His core was depleted when he came in. We think he use his magic to keep the children safe. And we think it was wandless, it was a great strain in his core."  Hannah tells me.  "Draco has ..." I see her pause and search for a word that may not hurt so much. “He has what it takes to get out of this situation well, Harry. He survived a war and two years living with Voldemort, he can get out of this. Just have faith that your husband will come home to you soon. " She tells me in a soft tone. "Draco broke his left wrist, his left femur is shattered, and his spleen is broken, causing internal bleeding. We believe that, at the time of the accident, Draco was not actually sitting correctly, but looking to the back. ”
“Did you find something in the knife?” now is my turn to make the questions.
"As you, Draco," I tell him, looking at his bare hand. “You've had kisses every day too,” and even though I feel a lump in my throat, I swallow it as best I can and fall silent, just looking at Draco.
Dray chuckles softly, the sound coming from his stomach.
I can hear it. Her cries, because I had this nightmare before. She was beautiful and radiant and she was warmth. And then, she wasn’t anymore. The pain at the sides of my head, where my ears are, is too much. Blood is trickling down my ears.
"Why could not you wake him?" Parkinson ask, and then she passed them the knife. "I think the knife have magic embedded into it."
“Open that fucking cage, Bella,” the Dark Lord says, seething with rage.
“What’s up with the dancing black spots?” I ask Goldstein, taking out my wand.
I sigh heavily, maybe they don't know right away. But somehow, even though Ritta Skitter is no longer in The Daily Prophet, they still keep grabbing private information and regurgitating it in the newspaper as if we were fictional characters and not people who have a right to privacy.
"But, Hagrid ..." I tell her in a serious tone.
He laughs up at me.
“Who’s the boyfriend?” he asks me, a few papers appearing in his hand.
Ron nods again and I watch him glue the Auror robes to his body, seeking warmth. If there is something that the dungeons of the Ministry have, it is very cold. No spells really work down here except those that are Unspeakable level, which makes it practically impenetrable.
“Sign the papers, Mr. Potter,” she says to me. “I am not sure about your relationship yet, but I can see you care about him and that is enough for now.”
"His name is the last." I swallow. "What does Dumbledore have to do with all this?" I ask out loud.
"How come I get my coffee here almost every day, and you still don't know what I want to eat?" I ask, sticking out my tongue at one of the people I spent some of my school years with.
I take a bite of the breakfast Mrs. Weasley made and feel a great weight lift from my shoulders.
Wow...
"It's like this since we've been in Hogwarts," Hermione tells me. "But, as you can see, Harry is too handsome to be fooled by an ugly child."
"A lot," I reply. "Not entirely happy, though," I reply, swallowing a sad sigh.
"Thank you," I say quietly. "For helping Dray."
I nod, and I let go of Harry. He walks out of the room and I take all the Horcruxes out. Feeling cold starting to make its way into the room. I keep my thoughts on Harry and the love I feel towards him, keeping my guard up to fulfill my mission.
Draco glares at me again, this time I can see him fingering his wand.
“Pansy?” I look at her and I know my eyes are wide.
My son nods effusively.
“Is she? The woman who took your dad away?” I ask her, hearing my own voice, not even being conscious of what I am really asking her.
“What happened to her, Arthur?” I ask him.
And in a few seconds the dinning table is empty, except for Severus Snapes, the professor of potions.
When I lift my head I can see the little plant above my head. And around my neck two arms are wrapped.
“It was a club we came up with to thrive in a subject when the Ministry was trying to cover up what was happening in our society.” She pauses, her gaze far away. “They were dark times. We were trying to do a lot of things at the same time. Voldemort was always trying to capture Harry and due to that, Harry had to learn faster then the others. When we were in sixth year, Harry had mastered most of the curriculum the school was supposed to teach us and then, more. He knew how to use unforgivables and he had… Still has, a deep understanding in blood magic, wards and bonds. Everyone in this world, the wizarding world, believe he is the only one who can stop Voldemort from reigning fully.”
"Sure, Harry. I'll make Draco's favorite dessert, just in case they let you bring him home,” says Molly's voice.
“So, if Bellatrix took him she may has Narcissa’s wand?” she asks slowly.
"It's here," Hermione tells us, as she opens the door with her wand and immediately gets the scare of my life.
"James has something to tell you," Scorpius says in a final tone, as he begins to walk toward the room. His cup of tea, in a bear shape, floating behind his little body.
I swallow audibly, as I get to my feet and try to get as far away from Alastor Moody and Albus Dumbledore as possible. What Mad Eye is saying is not a total lie. However, Harry is correct, Dray is not an object of mass destruction to be used in a war. He is human and his feeling should count, he shouldn't be rushed into a war field to be used as another wand.
"Goodbye," Scorpius says to them and I can hear a giggle as his little hand moves from side to side.
The three of them stand side by side at the entrance of the dining room.
I know you mean the moon.
“Are you telling me you have no fucking idea where the moon child is?” she asks me.
Scorpius grabs my hand as we walk through the halls of Oxford University. His huge green eyes look at everything, eager to see all that the institution has to offer.
"Ulisse," I tell him, as I look up at the small speakers scattered around the room. "It brings back good memories."
Enjoy with hot chocolate and a warm blanket.
"Excellent," his eyes are sparkling in this mad way that reminds me of McGonagall whenever she is bending the rules. Dray begins to drag me into the parking lot. "I hope it doesn't bother you waiting too long." He mutters, pressing a small control with his hand. "Come on, we're going to Battersea." A car makes a sound.
“I will try my love, I will try to reach you as soon as I can, I swear to you over my life,” I say to him. My magic is starting to agitated inside my core, making the fake trees in here to dance from right to left. “Someone is trying to tear us apart.”
"She loves you," Harry tells me and takes my hand in his on the table. "Do you remember that I wanted to introduce to you two very important people to me?" I nod softly to Harry's question. "They are Hermione and Ron," both people sitting, one next to me, the other next to Harry, their eyes softening as they spoke their names. "They are... family. A kind of sibblings."
I pale as I remember my conversation with the headmaster a few days ago. The assurance in Dumbledore's words that Dray was not a little white dove.
And suddenly a woman appears in front of us, her hand tied with a rope spell, her eyes blindfolded and her lips glued together. Perhaps the Dark Lord will let me kill her when this interrogation is over.
"Can we eat something first?" Dray asks me, looking at the witches and wizards around him. "There's some kind of magical sweet I should try?"
"There is one more place we have to go," I say to everyone in the room.
And the boy just shrugs, easiness bleeding out of him.
"Papa!" I hear the screams from the hallway and get off my husband before our children enter our room as if a dementor was chasing them. Still, Draco rests his head on my chest and his arm on my abdomen.
Fear nests in my chest, as I watch Dray's eyes shine like liquid mercury. However, my blood drains when I hear Moody's voice.
“Which case was he working on?” I ask her, looking straight to where Draco is sleeping peacefully.
He shakes his head.
Hermione nods.
This is not Harry’s voice. Even if Harry is not the best singer in the planet at least, my boyfriend knows when to shut his trap.
“We live in London, it is hot one hour and the next it is already raining, so they must wear something to protect them from the cold. Especially with that new tooth that is coming out, James,” he says to the three in a serious tone. "The same goes for you, Potter."
I move away from Sirius's chest.
“It’s okay,” I walk towards him, until we are close enough and I pull him towards me, crushing him between my arms.
Because, now in the calm of this room, knowing that Ron and Hermione have my back, I can afford to analyze my memories carefully.
Dumbledore is looking at all of us in the room. Even if I am suspecting of his intentions because of Draco hearing Voldemort mention it during one of his torture sessions, I still have my doubts. For my soulmate is still not clear if he was under a curse or if he was listening the truth, but it will never hurt me to be paranoic of the headmaster. Nonetheless, he just nods softly to Kingsley and went out of the Auror’s HQ.
I fell in love with this chapter, it was so easy to write it and I am happy with this.
I roll my eyes and move my hand, invoking a board game.
“You are here for a reason, Potter,” Parkinson almost yell at me. I see her pacing the room like a caged panther. “He is not sick. He is respectful as hell; he follows the rules. If he is sick, he fires call to let us know. If he is late, he fires calls to let us know. He is never, never like this.”
I open the bag once more and Ron reaches into it with his hand. Once he takes it out, there is a flower in his hand, which opens without hesitation and I see how his eyes move over the letters that are written on the paper.
And maybe more. But I am not about to tell her the truth.
"Nooo," he tells me in a serious tone, looking straight ahead. "And what is this about?" he asks me, putting his feet covered by black boots on the grass.
Ron puts his hand over my mouth.
"I..." I start to say and his eyes sparkle with intense curiosity. "You…"
"I don't mind as long as you are happy, my love," she whispers against my ear and suddenly, I am being engulfed by her arms.
I nod, faking confidence. A smirk appearing on my lips. A blond told me once: if you don’t have confidence, fake it. No one can tell the difference, except you. And I intend to keep the act up if that mean Draco can have the surgery he needs.
Ron rolls his eyes.
"Draco will need therapy once we have removed the bones from his broken femur and a potion will built his bone from scratch. But, that process will take a couple of days, at least four. During that time, Draco will be under potions to lessen his pain and then he will have to undergo physical therapy once the bone is hard enough. We hope that his spleen can be saved for the most part, otherwise his quality of life will drop considerably and I cannot guarantee that he can continue to practice as a doctor in the Muggle world.”
“You are strong. I know we can get through this, together,” and I lay down by his side, preparing myself for the worst. Because, for the next few days, maybe I will have to love for the both of us.
I tilt my head and look up at Narcissa Black's silhouette, her loose hair dancing to the rhythm of an invisible wind. Her smiling lips and bright eyes, both directed towards me.
“It’s listed in here,” he says. “Were you not aware?”
Hannah nods softly.
"Would you be my boyfriend?" I ask him, looking into his eyes. Dray shakes his head. "No?" I feel shocked.
Nesha's cold hug makes me refrain from kissing Harry again and starting something neither of us has time to finish right now. Nesha's wet little tongue tickles my neck and I can't help but laugh as my cheeks heat up.
"What happened?" Ron asks, looking at how nothing remains of that memory.
I look up at Ron and his blue eyes move away from his wife's body to mine and I can see the concern in them. Most of the times we were in trouble at Hogwarts it was more than anything from Hermione's curiosity and desire to know things, rather than the fact that Voldemort was smart and could come up with plans to trap me.
And I stop for a moment to appreciate his slender body wrapped in a white shirt with a gold clasp where the tie should go. My boyfriend? I don't know yet, but I hope we will soon be. Dray looks desirable dressed that way.
“What’s Malfoy fond of?” I ask Parkinson, leeting the ward in peace and seeing how it start to heal.
“Harry told you?” she looks up at me.
I roll my eyes as I try not to join Dray in his laugh.
All the death eaters are starting to take their seats in front of Lord Voldemort. I can see then through the All Knowing Mirror in Dumbledore’s office. Jaxley and Bellatrix are the first to arrive.
“An Argentum is an elf, an elf of the moon. They rarely come to the universe. They are known as emissaries of death, but in reality they only assist souls in their transition from this world to the next. They guide them to walk the right path and not get lost, or to stall... stay in limbo, wandering for all eternity.” Zephora breathes. “The Argenti, as their plural name is, are elves of the highest level, their magic is pure to the ground and the few who have been born in this world are entities with great height. Dray is rather short for one of his kind, but retains all other traits. Silver hair like the moon, silky like clouds, skin as white as snow and stars in burns in his eyes.”
I cannot help it but feel dread crawling up my spine.
“Oh no,” another lamia says. She is old… Older then me. “A moon elf and he is hurting badly.”
"Wow, it must be amazing to have this kind of power," says Ron.
“We found your father,” I say to my soulmate, seating up a bit.
"This magic is dark-magic," Mione says, looking wildly at me.
“Is master Severus wanting help?” the little house elf asks me once the main door opens for me. She is small and she is using a bright pink bow in her bald head. “The Master is in the dinning room with the snake,” she whispers.
I peck him in the lips, and Nesha make a sad attempt to fly to me. Her wings still weak, because she is still a baby Occamy.
Because if he doesn’t this will just be an empty act. If he dies, I will never get a chance to ask a second time for a first-date. I will not even have him here anymore harassing me to finish my paperwork in time. Or listening to him rummaging through Grimmauld Place searching for old and moldy potion books to help him break a case. He will not be here anymore to take my bed and sleep on it like if he owns it. Or hear him complain about me not buying enough chocolate ice-cream for his sweet teeth whenever he is home.
“Do you want to have sexual intercourse with Bellatrix Lestrange?” she asks me, her eyes looking straight at me. “I was kidding,” she says softly, giggling.
"Good to meet you, Harry Potter," he tells me softly. "Do you like music?"
“Are we all sure of what we have to do?" I ask to each of those present, especially because Harry and Ron are capable to go do this task without knowing what they really need to do.
And when I walk in, there are Hermione and Robards all right. Pansy Parkinson is here too with Anthony Goldstein, of all people it had to be the Ravenclaw prat.
Dray smirk at her. The Black trade mark smirk of doom and apocalypses, painted in pale pink. His eyes shinning with something that hurts so much.
"Draco, please," I let the air out of my lungs at that single word.
He smiles softly at me.
Left comments and kuddos, they makes my day better.
"That doesn't mean it cannot be cool," the boy replies, lowering the huge suitcase he carries on his back. A black suitcase with cloth patches with names of bands I loved when I was younger, when Harry was a newborn.
I can feel my own eyes welling up with tears.
"It's not easy trying to be a good influence," I tell the Weasley's patriarch. "Harry is too scared."
“How so, Mister Potter?” Smart Healer utter her first word.
What is this thing with mothers and grandchildren? Pansy told me a few days her mother is expecting her own gran-children soon. But, I am pretty sure Pansy is something from the other world. She is so special, and no one is up to her standards. She says I am, but that's stupid. She just says it because we were raised together. Obviously, I am the best little brother she has, since she has none from blood.
“You are not… Better either.” I rasp out, feeling my body burning.
"How many nights ago?" Ron asks like the good auror that he is.
“Don’t be, Harry,” he says to me. “I will choose you again, over and over again,” he says softly. His voice spiked with sleepiness.
"What were we up to, Mr. Potter?" he asks me and I open my eyes, trying to make sense of what is happening. However, my companion's hand closing on my prick makes it impossible to think. "Oh yeah. I remember now,” the voice is so close to me and a new warmth enters my personal space.
This is the man to whom she would give a son without hesitation. A little boy with all the power of the Dark Lord. And he would torture him, until he was similar to our lord. He would torture him until he perished and then revive him with black magic.
“I chose to live in a peaceful world, and have my friends alive too,” he pauses. And I know he is remembering Crabbe. “Even if I couldn’t save them all, even if I had to torture others,” he says brokenly. “I chose you and the way you always try to do justice to others. Because is better to live in a world where you have this person speaking his voice to make a better world, then have someone who will never listen, someone that will just punished, for sins that weren’t even yours,” he says between sobs. “And I am glad my chose over my parents, Harry.”
Dray shakes his blond head.
“Harry, no!” Hermione’s voice is ringing through the air but it is too late now.
"I love you too, Dray," I whisper, fixing my eyes on his. “With all that I am and with all that I have. I love you."
I hear the crack of an apparition again and I know that Hermione has returned.
I was coaxed into not telling the truth about the abussed going down in that house, and I did my best to never brake that rule, because I was really afraid. With time, I reached the conclusion, that I, in fact, don't owe my silence to someone so vile anymore. But, growing up I was too scared for my sister, for my mother, who was raising us single handed. And I am grateful I, like my sister, find solace in music. I am cellist, she is a guitarrist. I am a pianist, she is a singer. I am free, and so is she.
“A rogue argentum,” he says softly. “Now we know Dumbledore was as crazy as Lupin said.”
“I also remember thousands of people standing up to applaud a certain blonde after performing a solo,” I tell him seriously. However, I don't feel uncomfortable or upset.
“Anima Revelio,” but, the lightning bolt comes out of Moody's wand before he even blurts out a word and the lightning bolt hits Dray square in the chest.
“I love you,” his magic whispers to me and I feel contented.
Hermione nods.
"Not from the Blacks, you can take that as a fact, or at least, not from all of them," Ron tells me, as his eyes fly directly towards the board. "If we go in order you will notice a couple of things," I see him sit more comfortably in the most uncomfortable chair in the entire universe. "Sirius was accused of being a mass murderer and of the death of your parents. However, Sirius was the first Black to belong to Gryffindor and that was not enough for his mother to kick him out of the family. It was when he decided to reject his own family, leaving the everything to someone else.”
"Why?" I ask him.
“Don’t worry young Argentum, for once, I will hear your pray,” Voldemort says. “Tomorrow at night, Young Argentum, I am going to have the pleasure to make your wish come true.”
The door opens and Goldstein is entering the room with quite steeps.
"Don't lie, mate," I say seriously. "You know I'm always going to support you, right?" Next to me, Mione nods seriously.
"It is not very common in magical British society for children to see their grandparents a lot, but on special dates the whole family gets together and people talk," Blaise murmurs, as he pulls out his wand and casts a silencing spell around us. “The lastname Rosier was born in France. Like my family, they come from other countries where customs are different and, the French just like the Italians, have this thing about families. The Rosiers have the habit of making everyone in their family know each other. And not only that,” he sighs and feels like he's trying to figure out how to put into words everything his mind is thinking. “Evan Rosier had a very close friend, the heir to the Malfoy family, another very old French family, pure blood and with so much, much money and influences in every country in Mediterranean, Europe, Greece, Romania, Portugal, Spain and Italy. The next Malfoy family heir was promised to marry a daughter of the Black-Rosier hosehold who was born the same year as Lucius, the Malfoy's only heir.”
"Gentlemen," Neekeal tells us. "It is a pleasure that you have joined us today."
"I'm tired of walking alone, Dray," he says choking on his tears. "I'm tired of fighting alone, when this isn't just for my good."
"Harry," he tells me, as he leads me somewhere, his elegant, long fingers curling around the straps of his case. He looks at me again and he is practically glowing. I can feel the spark of magic inside him growing, calling. "I know you, Harry." He says to me practically in a whisper, as he stops in front of a small cafeteria.
However, I stick with that thought and keep my hands close to my body.
He is a vibrant yellow when he is absorbing information with Hermione and a strange combination between yellow, orange and black when he is listening to Ron. Black, there’s the color.
I swallow audibly.
I say squeezing Harry’s hand which is still holding mine.
And I feel like the luckiest person in the entire universe.
The twins look at each other and something happens between them.
"I'm fine," I reply to Harry. Aida's voice caressing my ears and comforting my heart. "So, you are so handsome that a man wants to kill you?" he asked Harry, trying to lighten the mood.
The three of them nod at the same time, and start down the stairs, their footsteps making me deaf.
“Because this is Master Draco favorite,” he says to her. Never wavering. “Where’s master Draco, Harry?”
How can my parent can give up on me so easily? Why cannot they have shipped ourselves to other country? Once, Albus told me about they knowing of the prophecy. Back there I wasn’t the only infant born at the end of July. I learned this when I was in Hogwarts.
I try to remember the things I have herd with time.
Dray's first contact with a magical creature. Harry doesn't know how to eplain him not everything is as good as it seems.
"AND?" he asks and I can feel him settling back between my legs, his head resting again against my chest.
"Is that a tie?" Dray's voice makes the nerves in my stomach rise.
"That's not what I want from you, Harry Potter," the silver-colored figure tells me. "What I want is for you to promise me that you will try to love him and that even when bad days come, you will remember the reasons why you decided to accept him in your life," she tells me, as her long dress flutters around her body.
I nod softly, making the words appear in my list of food and other goods to buy. I read the list again. We need food, more vegetables and not so much meat. Master don’t like meat like that. He likes soft meats. And we need more cheese and tea leaves.
His eyebrows furrow and I'm sure he's waiting. Or maybe he's giving me a bad look. His fingers move smoothly and the words form out of nowhere. No wand.
James has his first toothache today and I am so proud, I still remember Teddy's. He was a tiny beautiful child and when he got his first toddler toothache Draco had stopped from killing him with numbing pain potion for kids, because: "We cannot take all his pain away, Harry. We can kill him if give him a dosage every time he complains his mouth hurts. You can gave him ice-cream every day, but medication is not a sweet, love. And we can potentially harm him with an overdose."
"And where's your coach now?" I ask him.
I nod and Blaise reaches in.
“Mate,” Ron tells me, his hand patting my back softly. “Sorry, I know it was your night off and I know it was your partner night off too.”
“Harry, can you please help Ronald set up the tent in the yard?” she says softly, kissing my cheek.
And I feel relieve wash over me, knowing that surely, he will be home waiting for me when this war is over.
“I think we should end with this now, Mione,” I say to her, still holding into Draco’s hand softly.
"Oh! Harry," my mother calls out to him, as she sits down next to my father and starts tearing the turkey. "Mrs. Montgomery told me that one of her nieces would like to meet you," my mother tells him, setting the knife aside and looking over the heads of Charlie and Andrei, Charlie's boyfriend. "She admires you a lot, I told her that I would ask you if you were interested in dating and then I would give her an answer. It's been a long time since your last relationship. It's been over a year now, right? ”
And I don’t need to be that Harry now. I need to be the Harry that was able to battled Bellatrix Lestrange back in sext year. I need to be the same Harry that battled against Voldemort for a long fucking time.
"Why not?" Draco asks, tickling him.
“He deserved it,” she says softly. “He knew since the beginning where this brat was and he wasn’t brave enough to tell our Lord.”
"It's scary," I finish the sentence for Arthur, as I reflect on what he just told me.
I know that voice.
“I herd that,” my mother reprimands him.
"A person told me the same thing a couple of days ago, my dear treasure," he tells me, closing his eyes and pressing his lips against mine in a gentle gesture that makes me melt and sigh. "The best thing about life is that we chose each other."
My eyes immediately settle on the tender smile that plays on his lips and somehow the butterflies that fluttered in my stomach turn into a hippogriff stampede.
And although her tone sounds resigned, I can also hear the pride in her voice. Seven years with her guiding and raising me, almost like a mother.
"I'm sorry Minister, but I can't do anything to make your dream come true," he says in a serious tone. “As you know, last night some prisoners escaped from Azkaban. Not only do we have information that Yaxley left Azkaban, but others also managed to escape last night with him,” Ron tells him in a serious tone.
"Okay," I say seriously. "I will keep my emotions in check, to the best of my ability."
However, there is something that unsettles me every time I remember the whispered words of Ronald Weasley: Nothing is really what it seems. Harry hasn't really tried to hurt his enemy.
The magic around them is moving slowly over their bodies, making sparks fly from their skins, shinning an intense shade of green and black. They are utterly pale, their cheeks prominent, the eyes being swallowed by their own skull.
"You are doing well darling, put your injured leg on the ground a little more," says the nurse. I see the sweat accumulate on my husband's forehead, and yet he keeps steadily forward. The nurse behind him the whole distance. "Five more, sweetie."
"I just know," and he beams at me.
Luna looks at me and a spark of recognition shines in her light blue eyes.
The words mother and then Narcissa scapes my mouth, but the thread doesn’t fall.
"It's like magic, but to find out if someone is your family or not" Hermione says and I stare at her. That was not what they taught me at CSI. “Or if the blood on your clothes is yours or someone else's. Or if the murderer was the good twin and not the one that everyone thinks is bad." Hermione says as succinctly as possible.
"Do you think we can find Draco Black in that piece of cloth there?" I ask hopefully.
"What's wrong?" I ask them.
“Mother!” the hurt tone in Draco’s voice makes me leap into action. “Take them out of me,” Draco says while he starts to dig his nails into his own flesh. “Please, it hurts.”
I look at the letter.
My heart floats inside my chest and I let happiness envelop me. I lean over until my lips are in his temples and leave a kiss there.
Once we are alone, I embrace Harry with all I have.
“It is called love, Nesha,” I hiss to her. “His heart is beating wild because he is in love, and that is good.”
"I am Gred," say one of the twins. "And he is Forge," a huge smile plastering on their lips.
"What is that, love?" Draco asks him looking at the paper James has in his hand.
My best friend's hand rests on my shoulder and I feel the affectionate squeeze.
"Wait a minute, champ," I make my way to the kitchen and rummage in the potions cabinet for a children's potion. "Which of all?" I yell from the kitchen, not knowing which of all the vials is appropriate.
"Alohomora," I whisper, and the door slowly opens, I try to get Dray through the small door without hitting anything in the way. Once he's close to the bed I put him on the mattress and watch him curl up against the pillow. He is so weird, because he is the oly person I know that can sleep through apparating.
I put distance between Gin and me slowly. I look straight in her eyes, looking for the woman I know she is. She looks tired, maybe a bit depressed. That’s not a good look for the little, fiery girl I know. The fighter Ginny is there somewhere, deep inside her. I know it.
For the people who are good to read this... Enjoy, with hot chocalate and a panino.
I feel my heart swell with joy and I can finally let my muscles relax.
Draco's hands return to my hair I feel the water begin to moisten it.
Tears are gathering in my eyes. And I can feel the surge of power inside me. My magic growing steadily inside my core and crackling around my body.
I hug Hermione back and try to smile for her. Although her words are not far from the truth, I know that I feel bad for different reasons. I hadn't felt so much anger inside me since fifth year, when the wizarding world turned against me.
"I thought you were single," Lenda tells me with a blush on her cheeks. "Really ..." but, Scorpius interrupts her.
A machiavellian sight: The ends justifies the means.
I notice the movement of Kingsley's wand and how it levitates the thread of blood away from Dray's pale skin, toward the portrait.
(See the end of the chapter for
"A dead woman cannot have memories, Hermione," says Ron, touching an object and holding it in his hand. "But, this is tangible."
"Don't be late," I complete the sentence with a soft nod. "I understand, professor." I remember Dray is standing next to me when I stopped feeling like a kid in the presence of Minerva McGonagall. "This is Dray," I tell the professor formally. "Dray, this is Professor McGonagall. She teaches a really special class, here at Hogwarts."
I let go of him, still hovering closer to him, just in case. His grey eyes are focus solely on Hermione and I know this is not going to be easy.
"What you said before kidnapping Dray is true, Harry," Hermione tells me. “Yesterday Regulus Black explained a thing or two to me. For example, that Death Eaters have a legitimate reason to be so malevolent,” 'Mione tells me and her lips tighten in disgust. "And actually, he's right. People are not born good or bad, Harry. Society makes them good or bad... Or at least, so it is with most Muggles." Her voice is a whisper. “In the case of the Death Eaters, their families hurt them too much and that hurt shaped them all into this hungry for destruction monsters. Which leads me to wonder: What happened to Voldemort to create a society of evil people to hurt all the living creatures?"
The patronus disappear and I feel like I can breathe better. I look again at Regulus. He looks really bad. His body is littered with dark bruises, his eye is swollen to the point it’s all closed and dried, crusted blood is surrounding the area.
Draco calms down, but there is still fire in his eyes while he walks towards me.
“Yes, and he reeked like her, when she broke up in the apartment with the other one that reeked like her.” Nesha hissed with fury.
“Are you sure this is not poisonous?” he asks while eying us. “I still have a little girl and a wife waiting for me at home, and even if I trust you, Hermione, you both weren't the smartest at Snape's class.”
I immediately walk over to James and take him in my arms to sit him on the kitchen ledge. His gray eyes look at me seriously, so similar to the Draco I met at eleven.
I see the tears fall from his beautiful green eyes.
Draco is not quite lucid and I can see it in his gaze.
“We will see ourselves out, Harry,” Hermione says, squeezing my hand with her, softly. “If you follow me Healer Mason, I will show you were is the Floo,” she says softly.
They both are looking at me dumbfounded.
“Dray, I need you to hold Nesha for a moment, ok,” I say to him, calling a wild magic wand to my hand. This should make the trick and I hope for the life of everything that’s sacred that this shit works.
I think long about the things Draco said, writte, whatever. And I feel angry, and then sad. Am I enough to heal the broken heart of this beautiful angel? Am I selfsih for wishing I will be enough to make Draco smile day after day?
Enjoy with hot dogs and soda.
"Is he Muggle?" she asks again and I nod gently. "And what did he study?"
The healer looks at the house elf. A smile appearing in her face. But, for first time since I opened my big mouth, I know I have nothing to worry about. It might be true what Parkinson says, that maybe I was resented to Draco about the dating thing that went downhill. But the truth is, Draco never stop coming here to work our asses late at night when a case was as fucking difficult as hell.
"You're good?" I ask him, pressing him closer to my chest, holding him there. "Are you?"
Hannah Abbot smiles at me as she hands me a hot paper cup.
"Look," Hermione whispers to me.
"It's called love, Scorp," James says seriously.
Sorry I am late guys, but exams are up at college and professors don't have mercy. I did two exams yesterday, one of them was up for 3 hours, but I get a 100/100 so I am so happy.
Draco placed on the table a bunch of colored pens with glitter and without it and immediately the two of them start writing on one side of the letter "We luv u", and fill them with poorly drawn human brains, orange, blue, light blue, gray brains ( the only one well drawn, according to my husband is the gray one) and once they finish, everything that was white is now full of "We luv u" and colorful brains.
“Mate, are you sure you aren’t the necromancer?” I don’t even try to cover my laugh. “And what happened to your nose? Did your necromancer believed it was funny to play pick up your nose?”
You can find me on IG if you want. I will follow you back and give your hearts.
Draco's head turns so fast I fear he will break his neck, his eyes narrowed and glowing with a warning.
"Do you understand now, Harry?" he asks me, his eyes filling with tears. "Can you understando now why I seek his company so much?"
I conjure my Patronus, who seems to have gained one more branch on his antlers and looks brighter.
NOVEMBER 11th, 2002
DRACO
"Hey sweethart," I say quietly. "We need to go," I say again. "The time we paid for will soon be up."
"Are you a male or a female," I ask the occamy.
"But I could have kept their land," Wardwood says. “That is the reason why magical sites are rare. That is the reason why we have highly powerful rituals. Because witches and wizards died and spilled their blood on the ground. His bones turn to dust and the magic is still there somehow, on the ground, in the form of dust,” says Wardwood. "And not only is his blood there with his dust," and that sounds very bad. “But there is the blood of Narcissa Black. And she was a great witch." Thank God, Wardwood's brain is slowing. He feel safe now, I can keep going. "You can actually make a ritual in there and be sure it will work, because there raw magic was spilled, the blood of a baby is still more powerful then a grown up wizard. Babies can do wandless and wordless magic, some remarkable grown up wizards can," he says. "But, not even Dumbledore can do both at the same time. That place, wherever it is, is now a Magical Place and a really powerful one, like Hogwarts," he says. "It can work. A necromancy ritual, can work in there."
Hannah nods.
“That is because of who I am,” he says softly. “Just like when you, when your powers are manifesting. They tend to change colors in an exact mirror of your emotions.”
“This is going to be so fucked up,” I whisper to him, once it down on me that doing this in a legal shade means that we are bound to keep the lives of all the people that might be down there, safe.
I hear Draco giggle again and see him stand in front of Ron to undo my best friend's tie.
Hermione looks at him like she wants to be able to extract Zabini's brain and see what is inside it.
"You have to sign Teddy's application for his next trip to Hogsmeade," Draco tells me, as he pass me the paper over to read it. "It's not like you haven't read that piece of paper a hundred times in your life, Harry James," he says, and I know he's trying to annoy me.
“She was crazy,” my father says.
"Our," I tell him without thinking and Dray looks at me lovingly. "You know? Molly once told me that love was something you could see in people's eyes and she believed it was a lie, until today."
“People just keeps denying the fact that Voldemort was never gone. They even dubbed Harry as an
"Hello," I say, once I am a couple of steps away. He raise his face so fast that I'm afraid his neck will hurt badly just for that one movement.
"I promise to join an hour before the family feast is over," he tells me in a serious tone. "My students are going to hate you for this, Potter." He tells me in an amused tone, his lips tight, hiding a smile. "Especially when they find out there won't be any extra time for their final today."
Dray looks at me, his eyes flickering rapidly in concentration.
"Although his last name will attract attention, there is also the fact that Dray himself is one of the most reserved people I know, Harry," he tells me softly. "I understand your concern for the young Black, but remember something Harry, like you, Dray, is also a survivor." Dumbledore tells me, looking at a fixed place. "Have you ever wondered, why if you and Draco Black should be essentially the same age that isn't true?"
I laugh, knowing that Kingsley is right. When Severus Snape created the formula for two people of the same sex to have children, he didn't make it easy. I still remember the afternoons Draco and I sat in front of the cauldron and passed magic to what we believed to be a single fetus.
"Does anyone know something about the Black boy?" Kingsley asks. "Something useful."
"I don't know, Kingsley," I say seriously, my hand ruffling my hair. "His age doesn't match with what we are looking for. Draco Black should be twenty-two years old, like me, born in June. However, that boy up there is twenty, just turned a few weeks ago.” I say to him in serious tone. "We should be looking for a magician, instead we have a squib," I reported wearily. "The only thing that fits are two things, his name has half the phoneme of the person we are looking for and his father is Regulus Black."
“Are you kidding me, Mister Potter?" he asks me and I can hear mirth in gis voice. "Have you ever meet your grandfather? Or Bellatrix Lestrange for a change?" he says softly, still looking up. "We are all related, and let me tell you Mister Potter, we never play by the rules, exactly." And I let his words sink in me. He kills the silent between us with words. "Cissy was ruthless, Mister Potter. She really was, specially in dueling club,” he says, his eyes glinting like if he is talking of a long, lost love. “That’s why she was a champion. She and Severus Snape were just… Too much for the others.”
"The Revelio Anima was not supposed to kill him," I hear Moody's voice and immediately feel my hand itch and my hand closes around my wand. “Nothing like this has ever happened to any magician. It is not something that tortures a person. It's just something that would put him to sleep if his intentions were hostile.” My magic is angry inside my veins and it's whispering a single word: maim.
I let go.
“Nesha,” I hiss to her. And her eyes open at a slowly rate. “Nesha, darling, I need your help to bring back daddy,” I say to her, leveling my gaze with her eyes.
"That's... That's not true," I tell her, trying to stop my blood from rushing to my cheeks. "I did it to help Uncle Sev."
This behavior now... It's strange.
"More like every day," I tell him in a happy whisper.
"This is Harry Potter," Zephora tells me. "You are Dray's soulmate."
"Daddy!" Scorpius says looking at him seriously, and then uses the spatula filled with green icing and passes it on one of Draco's cheeks.
"Is always a good place to be with my biological father," he hiss at me and I feel like instead he had punched me in the guts. "Can you understand now? Can you?"
he says to me, and disappearing.
I try to refute him, but he just shakes his head and it’s weird, because that’s my head. Just, the scar is bleeding.
“Do you have a clue about where Draco…” Hermione’s eyes are as big as saucers. “Oh my God, Merlin and Morgana.”
“There’s no need for me to explain,” he says giving me a crooked smile.
One though is swirling inside my head: There's no more darkness. My moon is shinning.
Hugs,
While I had Regulus during my childhood and adolescence, Harry had no one. I had Reggie and Cissy, my two best friends, even though we were in different houses, back when we were at Hogwarts, and the love that they both gave me… It can never be compared. They were my family when everyone else turned their back on me. Narcissa with her sweet smile, very different from Andromeda and her serious way, or Bellatrix with her cynical smile and her thirst to make others suffer. And Reggie, with his silent displays of affection, his face turned to the side whenever I needed to talk about the cruelty of our parents or his slightly curved lips, as he looked down at the floor, ready to made me feel better with just a gesture.
Goodbye precious life.
“You have to go, right?” he asks me, clinging against my own t-shirt.
"Now hold me, I'm freezing to death," I hear Dray's voice again and I lift my eyes to see how the blonde falls to Harry-memory's side. His head on his shoulder, while the wind plays with his hair and Harry Potter… Harry Potter is smiling, after many years.
Without realizing it, I stopped paying attention to everything to focus on the velvety voices of Aida and Dimash.
I lean in and kiss my husband sofly.
I smile sideways and wave my hand so five cups begin to settle on the table, the kettle floating behind them.
That’s a fucking combination for apocalypses.
"I need you to keep quiet," she tells us once again, her voice a slight sigh laden with seriousness. "It is not that I have permission to be in this place precisely."
"Do you want to do magic with me?" I ask him softly.
November 14th, 2002
“Instead, you just backed up and left Severus to do all the hard work,” mother’s voice whisper against my ear. I look up to her with blurry eyes. I can feel the warm stream of water running down my cheeks. “I should have aborted you when I had the opportunity to do so,” she tells me, raising her wand. “You are an abomination, a humiliation to my family.”
This is from Mr. Weasley’s view. So, he was there with Blaise. I grip the memory softly, and then… It is opening in front of me. This is going make it easier for Arthur to let me see.
He smiles tiredly at me.
I feel searing pain going through my body, starting on my chest and splitting my heart in half. I try to scream, but nothing comes out, nothing but my own gasp for air.
“He is dangerous,” another house elf says. His magik sparkling in his fingers, cautiously, ready to create a barrier between us.
Enjoy with turkey :9 bread and hot chocolate.
No wonder fucking Sirius was batshit crazy too. What with the shit from scaping Azkaban, when it even wasn’t a life sentence. Two more years, and the stupid wanker would have been free. But no… Let’s go to rescue the soft Harry and cause to have different personalities.
Once I feel solid again, I open my eyes. Looking straight into Draco’s living room. It is small and minimalistic. The curtains are the only thing vibrant enough in this space, and the muggle telly that Draco insisted he should own just so he can pass his muggle studies with honors.
This is the pulse of magic that lives within Dray, that little flame that always accompanies him. Small, undeniable, helpless. A spark.
I lift my head a bit more, barely catching the words that are swimming softly in the air. I wave my hand at Harry and a smile brake in his face.
“If I tell you, it will be no more,” he says, steeping forward. His hands touching the barrier that separates him form us. “He is hope, kindness and love. He is a creature from a long time gone. His kind is no more of this realm, but he belongs amongst our vibrations…” he says softly. He is talking about life. “He shall remain here until he is more then just this little cub that has no idea how to take care of himself, his magic or… his mate.”
"They did the same shit to me, Regulus," I tell him, holding Dray tightly. "They will destroy him until there's nothing left." I gave up control.
“Oh, that’s nice, darling,” she says and I think she is actually losing it. “But, there shouldn’t be any No while you are declaring your love for the one you love the most.”
Which is all good. All good.
I shrug because I really don't have the answer to whatever Madam Pomfrey is questioning.
I rejoice at Ritta Skitter's screams, as I wonder what Harry Potter's boyfriend will look like. I will find out soon enough.
I smile softly and then my eyes lands again on Draco, who is actually steady in the air. His body already in tune with the Nimbus 2000. I see Ginny mounting on her, a beautiful Windswept Third.
He blinks up to me.
I nod, remembering that we are free from the Dark Lord. The ever-chivalrous Harry Potter defeat him in a burst of magic and something I cannot still name for my life. I smile, remembering how sad I was while my lovely cousin was on our basement, being threaten and slapped by Bellatrix.
He nods softly, while Ron and Zabini joins me.
“Nice to meet you, I'm Dray… Black,” I add at the end.
I shake my head, still not believing this.
"What do you think Robards is yelling, mate?" Ron asks me with a smile plastered on his lips. "He looks as like a tomato."
A bit off by days. We are apart by those days. It’s weakening the magic of the wizards in the society. And with the darkness that lurks over us due to Tom Riddle rotten soul, Mother Magic has been sad… Depressed.
That must have stung pretty bad.
“Because the spleen is what helps the body create white blood cells, which are in charge of fighting against diseases and infections. He's a doctor and I know he work clinic time. The patients in clinic time are full of germs and we wizards are not immune to cold. So we hope to save as much of that organ as we can, Harry. If that doesn't happen, he will most likely have to give up his medical career and take extra steps at home to keep from getting sick. But, only if he lose his spleen.”
"It's true, Harry," Draco's voice fills the room and I twist my neck at the memory. Draco is sitting on a log in the middle of a clearing. His shoulders covered by my own jacket.
And she walks past me and I know our conversation is over. I smile softly and continue on my way, trying to put everything I've just discovered in St. Mungo's in order. I think about my destiny and appear again in the atrium of the British Ministry of Magic, ready to open the folder that contains the information of Narcissa Black and everything related to her health.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sometimes, yes," I reply, taking a seat, feeling my heart pound inside my chest. "But, I'm not entirely sure Dray will believe me if I ask him."
Draco tries to hide a smile full of love and ... fails miserably.
"Voldemort is not playing by the light-magic book, Mione," Ron says. "This is strategy. If we loose the little things we can hold over him we lose this war. If somehow he learn that Dray is not with us anymore, he is going to tear appart the Brittish Magical London trying to find the Argentum. This way we can be prepare to protect something that's no longer with us. This is a win-lose situation for us, and damn sure is going to give us leverage against him."
I smile softly at him.
"Yellow," says James at once.
Enjoy with hot tea and sandwiches.
Which I am assuming it is a lot. Draco is a survivor after all. I don’t know everything, but when we were back, when everything ended, he was still reluctant to let people touch him, he couldn’t even sleep in the same room with other without throwing wards, renewables wards, around his bed. He would curse even the slight shadow looming over his shoulder.
His eyes are moving slow, but in the end they settle on me. His body leans towards me and his arms wrap around my neck. Taking care not to scare him, I let my hands rub his back.
“Do you have what I have been wanting for so long, Severus?” he asks me, his voice a deadly whisper.
A smirk appears in my lips.
He shakes his head.
However, I may not have time to find out today. Or maybe Kingsley will never tell me. However, it all goes back to what Kingsley knows. Kingsley and the ancient painting of Narcissa, and there is no one who wants to claim it and Dray can see it again.
Ron swallows and, right away, I know something is wrong. It was them who gave Neekeal and Robards this information. Everything they could find was in that file. I never stopped to believe maybe they were putting themselves in real danger.
And me…
Zephora rolls her eyes so hard that it's impressive that she couldn't see her own brain in that movement.
And then she retires. I look at Hermione and Harry, side by side, in complete peace.
"This isn't really your head, Draco," he tells me softly, taking two steps back. "This is you," Harry's hand lights up with a fireball, which then rises up into the sky, allowing me to see everything around me and a little more.
She enters and I can see her opening the door to the walking closet. And I smile, knowing I can keep this up.
His hand intertwines with mine and I lower my face a little to see his gray eyes shining with joy, a few spects borrowed from the deepest part of the ocean are dancing in his irises. The smile that is painted on his lips widens exponentially.
"Harry Potter," is the first thing the girl who serves the shoppers says. "What I can help you with?"
But I know better. I have to be a good heir, and I will be a good heir.
HARRY
"I'm so sorry, Mr. Black," I open my eyes and rest them on my godfather's brother. "My intention was never to hurt Dray. I brought him here because Rowle saw him with me yesterday morning, and he almost..."
HARRY
“Once this war shit is over, I will be handing out my resignation papers,” I say to no one in particular. “I prefer if you lead, Ron.” I say to him, laying back, because this is the best way of action to take right now. “I know I might fail remembering inside there might be someone I have been learning how to care for.” I kept the protocol.
“Who is with Draco?” I ask her.
“This is Malfoy’s Cottage,” he whispers. “Remember, even if he was in our side, it doesn’t mean he didn’t need to protect his properties for the moles on our side.”
“You said no one can ever satisfy you like one Harry Potter, right?” he says, his red eyes shinning in the darkness. “But, don’t you worry precious little Argentum,” he brandishes his wand, opening the skin of my neck. “Let’s make this more sexual, what do you say?”
Long live to the Madness of the Black household.
"I know, Harry," his voice is just a whisper, but I feel him lean his head into my hand. "I trust you."
“It was created by a spell,” I say to him, feeling shame and guilt creep on my heart. “It was a consequence of my mother selfishness and the evil soul of Voldemort.”
"It's good," he tells me in a hoarse voice, practically a whisper.
Suddenly Draco crushes our son against his chest and resumes his kissing attack, while Scorpius laughs quietly on the floor, looking at his twin with love. A love I will never, maybe, will know nothing about.
“Worthless, that’s what you are Draco,” I hear my father’s voice and when I look up he is there. In front of me. His skull mask firmly in place, his wand raised. “I should not have a son as weak as you. Afraid of being the best, afraid of killing, afraid of fulfilling his heritage,” he walks towards me and the only thing I can see in the darkness of this room is my father’s shinny, white, long hair. “If you just had killed Dumbledore, I would have been so proud of you, Draco. My son, doing everything to take our name to glory.” He kneels by my side.
"So, are we closing a case based on unfaithful evidence?" I ask her, trying to be as respectful as I can.
I splutter at her words.
I ask him again.
Harry chuckles softly and in a little boy outburst, he let my head fall against his chest. The vibrations from his laughter make me relax. This is all too strange and although I'm pretending that everything is fine, the truth is that it is not. This terrifies me.
Kreacher appears with a tray of food. Sandwiches, scrambled eggs and tea. I see Dray lose complete interest in Hermione to launch himslef into the house elf and take his hands in his. Neekeal, Robards and Shackebold have their eyes on the little blond.
Left comments and kuddos, they make my day/night all better!
The best work about being a potion master is that a lot of people needs me, and I can help them anonymously. Because there’s no need to spread the panic letting people know their remedies, most of them never invented before me, has been created by someone that stood side by side with Voldemort.
“We will give you a few moments alone,” she says taking Weasleys hand in hers and dragging him out.
Just a boy, because Draco really didn't know evil until Lucius, practically, threw him at the feet of Voldemort. My beautiful husband, whose mind was brutally raped over and over again by Bellatrix Lestrange and Tom Riddle. My beautiful husband, that husband who every day tries to be the best father, the best friend and the best husband, the best doctor and the best teacher. My husband, whose still believe he deserve no love whatsover.
"I told you yesterday that Molly requested the presence of all her grandchildren at the Burrow," he tells me softly. "Sometimes I think she misses having a lot of brats running and yelling around her." And even if his words can be heard as mean for other people, I hear the love in them.
An innocent smile appearing in his lips.
"We Malfoys are worthy," he says defiantly, putting on a good imitation of Narcissa Malfoy. "Never unworthy."
"I love you too, Dad," Teddy replies his hair, acquiring an extra blond strand of hair.
The prophecy does not say who will win or who will live. It only says that the other will not be able to find peace, as long as his counterpart lives.
I shake my head. My heart breaking inside of me. The door opens and a dark-skinned, curly-haired witch appears through it.
“We don’t know that, Harry,” she says and I can see guilt in her eyes.
“Luna,” I whisper to the ward, pushing the words into it, until the threads start to unravel.
He is the one who should be concerned. He is the one that is the last Horcrux. If Voldemort keeps him as a slave, then he wouldn’t have to be worried about dying anymore. Unless… The Immortality Orb.
Harry takes Dray to his teenage home!
“How can you be sitting here, Potter?” he asks me, searching inside of me now.
I look at my core. It is burning with something scary. This is not me; this is not me or my feelings. This is a monster, and monsters are no good.
His eyes are sparkling mischievously.
"Do you think Draco has already had contact with his soulmate?" Albus asks her with his bright eyes shinning.
"I swear," I say almost shaking. The unbreakable vow is taking it's toll on my magic.
"Was he a pure-blood?" Hermione asks me.
OCTOBER 10th, 2002
“This is dark,” he says to us, his eyes firmly shut. “I can see all my darkest fears dancing in front of my eyes,” Bill says, keeping his body as relaxed as he can.
"Also, Dad says that you always have to have a strategy. That understanding your opponent is always better than just doing something stupid,” Teddy tells me.
“I don’t know, love,” I say to him, looking ahead of us. “But, Parkinson and I found you in a puddle of your own blood a few days ago and there were a hole in your wards.”
“He is, since a young age,” I say to him.
I hear a gasp.
What?
I close my eyes, imagining the living room at Grimmauld place. I feel the magic tugging at my navel and seconds latter we are in Grimmauld Place. Kreacher appears with a plate of chocolate shortcakes.
That he belongs by my side, and I can only earn that by keeping it as it is now. Sweet, cuddly, innocent in so many ways and even if it costs my life, I'll keep it that way. He deserves someone who doesn't have such a complicated life. Even before he knew what he was, who he was, he chose me because: It is difficult to reject a boy who gives me sweet cakes when I feel sad. And that was his response when I asked him why he put up with Ginny and all this heavy burden that comes with me.
In the chapter title you can find from who point of view this chapter is.
And Draco can feel it.
"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life," he tells me, as he crosses his arms and crosses his arms. Yup, Blaise thinks I'm stupid. "Who wouldn't want to date Harry Potter? You are a legend, Harry. They all want to go out with you. Every wizard and witch I know would be completely happy to be with you on a date. And that you still do not destroy the Dark Lord.”
However, I can't finish describing the situation because a couple of knocks on the door makes everyone's attention go to that place. The door opens and a short, plump girl enters the room. Her hair is a chaos of dark curls and her cheeks are rosy.
"Hello, beautiful," I say, brushing some hair from his forehead. "How you feeling?"
"Teach me what I must know in order not to be a burden to Harry," he tells them and the atmosphere in the room becomes heavy, and it charges with magic.
"You said he is not a Necormancer," Hermione spit her words with a tinge of angryness in her voice.
"It doesn't fit, Mione," I hear Ron reply. "Voldemort is not known for making friends with squibs or muggles," I feel a chill go down my spine. "He is more well known for torturing them."
“Are you setting the tent any time soon?” Molly fire the question to the whole room.
The door slammed shut on its own and my magic went on alert. I had never felt her so aggressive as in the past few days.
“But you are fighting it,” Hermione chimes in. I look at her and I can see a little notebook ready on her hands. “Why isn’t Draco able to fight it?”
"Replenishing blood potion," she says to me. "He isn't conscious. He needs the potion running through his blood stream to help him get better."
I smile and look down at Dray, still trying to melt himself into me. His eyes are back to Lilo and her big sister.
“Bacon, Healer,” I ask her while smirk at her way. “Well, Draco always like a light dinner and I am no one to oppose to his cravings,” I say shamefully.
Draco P.O.V.
“He did, before,” Harry says. “I need you all protecting Hogwarts,” Harry swept the room with his gaze. “I know all of you are capable wizards and witches. I studied, played and dueled with you all. We need to protect the castle, because here is something Voldemort wants. And if he puts his hands on it again, all hope will be lost.”
I let my magic engulf her.
"Next Minister for Magic," the redhead completes for her. I look at the girl strangely. “And I'm Ron… uh. Ronald Weasley. "
"You," and it is a whimper, while I breach him with my index finger and crook it inside his body, caressing his sweet spot inside him. "You, I need you," a breathe whisper. "Please. Please."
Even if I vow myself to never take advantage of his open invitations, I still feel blessed. I hold Harry a few more seconds, and then I am making myself let go of him, regaling him with a beam.
“He went missing a few hours ago. My master told me,” I say to him. “He was after horcruxes.”
"So, his soulmate can be whatever?" I ask her, feeling my body growing cold.
"Look Harry, it's like Nesha," Dray tells me, stroking the snake.
It was cruel, and Draco helped to win the war in ways the wizarding world will never know. The next day following the battle of Hogwarts, I took Snape and Dumbledore’s memories to Hermione. And the next month, I took them to Kingsley Shacklebolt, the Minister.
"Wait a minute, 'Mione," I say seriously. Priority. "Kreacher," and immediately the old elf appears in the room. "Take Dray upstairs and give him a change of clothes of mines."
"Why not?" Draco asks me, moving and brushing his behind against my prick. I inhale deeply and bite my lip, trying not to make any noise. I grab him by the shoulders, trying to keep him still, while trying to while my erection into submission. And it takes a few seconds to calm down and feel normal, not hormonal, again.
“It’s okay, Draco,” I say, trying to soothe him with empty words. Because, we are back to square one. We don’t know what kind of course they threw at Draco. “You see? They are falling out of your arms. They can not hurt you, love,” I say to him, trying to calm him down. “It is okay, you just have to breathe,” and I start to take deep purposely breaths.
"I love you," I say in a whisper, and leave a kiss on his forehead before playing along with the twins.
“Hmm,” Smart-Healer says looking at the queen size bed, dressed in white and gold heavy sheets that contrast with the equally heavy curtains. Two armchairs in white side to side, one of them sporting a washed-out red blanket. “Is that your chair?” she asks pointing at the chair with blanket.
"I am Dray," he replies, extending his hand.
Hermione cross the room in a few paces and she hug me tightly to her.
“Even kill someone?” father asks me.
"Dumbledore obliviated Robards," Ron blurts out like it's the most normal thing in the world.
"Harry?" he asks me, looking at me with his blue eyes, rapidly turning gray.
"Sure you did, for a moment I thought you were Professor Malfoy," she says with a sincere smile.
Immediately, I feel the blood pooling on my face and I draw the blonde towards me with my arms. And I hold him fondly, until the occamy decided it's enough and it stings my arm with its beak.
“What other option is there, Draco?” I ask him, running my hands through his hair. “And what are we doing now? This is not a quidditch game and I am not genius in this field. And I am scared I will be too late to rescue you.”
With my bare feet I approach him and my heart stops when I see how the blond's index finger descends towards a head with green, blue, light blue and purple feathers.
"I hexed a boy at school," Teddy answers honestly.
And suddenly I am falling, there's no more floor to keep walking. And I am falling hard. I can see the pavement waiting for me and I close my eyes hard, trying to stop my brain from feeling something else then the impending pain.
“Are you done now, Potter?” Parkinson asks me and I ignor her completely.
“Then, the Asset smelled like Bellatrix Lestrange,” I say to them, not looking over my shoulder to make sure they are here.
“What do you remember from that day, Draco?” I ask him, engulfing him with my arms.
But, I managed to make this one.
"He knows the answer, Professor Malfoy," she tells me in a low tone.
I nod and Scorpius enters by the open door with his straight, little back and shoulders squaring. I can sense the change in his magic, but I let him go, tugging on my bond with Harry and filling it with pride. The answer is immediate and Harry's presence invades my head for brief seconds, making me feel warm.
A small silve smoke left his mouth and in a matter of seconds his body warms up. His head moves towards my chest, as if Dray is looking for heat and I left a kiss on his head.
“You are wrong there, young Argentum,” he says slowly. “You did purify her soul. That’s a different way to approach things.”
I can see the fury in her eyes and I smile wide at her, showing her are my teeth. I wait. Catching the exact moment when she starts to say the spell, I flung myself to the other side of the cage, getting out of her spell.
I watch silently as Bill Weasley take a few hairs out of Draco’s head and dump them in the Polyjuice Potion. It gurgles and then, settles completely.
, was what Kingsley Shacklebolt taught me when I entered the Aurors. And even if it is slight, a curse is still a curse.
“I need you to help destroy Naggini,” she mutters. “She is an Horcrux too. We are going to lure inside here for you to take over her.”
And I can see where this is going.
“No,” he says fast.
Ron nods softly, without saying a word. His blue eyes on Kingsley.
I smile feeling like if I has won an entire trip to Disney Land and back.
"Do you remember what we are going to do today, Scorpius?" I ask him, once we are a few meters from my living room.
"And do what once we are there?" Ron asks to no one in particular.
Coming out of my thoughts, I rush to get ready before the Robards' Patronus appears and floods the room with my superior's shouting voice, and manages to make the nightmare, of Dray awaken once more, a reality. I want him rested and healthy.
“I want you forever happy, too,” I say to him, watching silently how his cheeks tinted scarlet. “I love you, Draco.”
“If you are talking about Potion Master Draco Malfoy, yes. We are in a romantic relationship,” I state for him.
"He's like a Hitler," Hermione responds quickly. "But, with Narcist complexes, if Narcissus had been a snake."
"Where are we going, Papa?" James asks me.
However…
And now is my turn to laugh while I look to my first father model. Arthur Weasley is laughing so hard, that no sound is coming out of his mouth at all. Just whizzing air out.
"Ginny still hates me?" I ask him.
I don't even say a greeting back and pause to stare at Kingsley.
Dray smiles at me and his eyes sparkle, and I immediately feel the magic within me curl up and heat up with pleasure at the simple act of complicity, trust and something else.
"Does anyone know his last name?" I ask to the nothing.
I feel like if I am in a hot sauna right now. I hoped you all enjoyed this chapter. Whatever.
“I think he is doing better,” I say to her, rubbing the sleep out of my eyes. “Thanks for being here, Mione.”
The girl quickly retires and I stand up.
And without waiting, I place the cloth over his eyes and tied it carefully behind his silver head.
"What is it, Dray?" I ask him, looking into his eyes at the reflection.
I look at him and give him a smile.
Yes, I am late again. Sorry guys, I try but this is hard.
I can see stars erupting inside his green-forest eyes, like being looking into a stary night in the middle of a jungle.
"Did someone saw you?" Draco asks him.
I trust Bill most of all, I trust Fleur. She is smart and a strategist. I can trust her to keep Bill out of troubles.
“Rolph Scamander,” the Unspeakable says. Her hair is starting to frizz and her curls are going wild.
"It's Dray," I tell Ron in a nervous tone, as I try to take a deep breath to stop feeling the horde of doxies threatening to tear my stomach in half.
"Can you really feel everything that I feel?" I ask Harry and he just nods softly, his hand caressing my cheek.
"Harry," I call out to him again and in a matter of seconds I feel him lie down next to me. I press my forehead against his ribs and squeeze the fabric of his shirt with my hand. "It hurts too much."
I walk forward without looking at Ron and my eyes fall right on the door of the ministry elevator.
The CoVid shot made me sick a complete week. I will update tomorrow again, because this headache is killing me.
"Ladies and Gentlemen, our soloist: Dray Black," says the dconductor, walking up to Dray for a brief hug. "And Stefany Detray, our pianist," he says, bowing his head towards the pianist once Dray is released.
"Oh, I'm not seeing a girl," he says to my mother, and yet that doesn't lessen the happiness my mother feels knowing that Harry is seeing someone. "He is a boy."
I feel my cheeks turn red as I try to control my heartbeat. I feel Dray stirring next to me, his eyes moving beneath his eyelids and I know he's starting to wake up. The enchanted head begins to speak again and my irritation grows when I know that her words will wake the blond.
"I want the boy in our hands before Voldemort can take him, is that clear?" Robards asks us. I nod as soft as I can. "You can leave, Aurors. You have twenty days to find the kid." Robards says in a serious tone and I immediately see the Unspeakables start to leave behind their leader and I wonder why they were here.
“Gellert Grindelwald,” I whisper, closing my eyes and reaching for my soulmate warm touch. "He is after Grindelwald."
“Master is really good to Winky,” she says and she hugs my leg and I caress her head. Her hair black and wavy.
(See the end of the chapter for
White hair falls softly over the electric blue fabric and I pause in my movements to caress the small part of his ear that is visible, to then go down his jaw and finish on his neck.
"I needed excuses to kiss you," Dray tells me, clinging to my body. Without thinking, I wrap my free arm around his slim body and place a kiss on his lips.
"When we were supposed to sleep," adds Scorpius.
"The bed feels too big and cold without you," I tell him, knowing that maybe he can hear me.
This is going to be completely humiliating and sweet at the same time. I know it.
00:12
NOVEMBER 20th, 2002
I step closer to him.
"It's here, Harry," the girl tells me.
"That's a great man, Harry," Arthur tells me, loosening his grip on Molly. "I hope that very soon he becomes part of the family."
"He's so beautiful," says the lady, spreading her hand across the table. Teddy stands on my lap and squeezes the lady's hand and then tries to bring the alien hand to his own mouth.
I gently push the thoughs away and immediately my eyes fall on the person kneeling on the bed. His naked body, without any imperfection, makes a perfect contrast with the silky black blankets on which his knees rest.
“And a few hairbows for your hair,” I say to her.
Ω Ω Ω Ω
“Incarcerous,” Ron yells and she sends the charm back at him.
"Let’s go to Luna," I say to Mother, creating space between us.
And there is not enough oxygen in the world to be relieved by his words.
What?
"How is Draco?" I hear Kingsley ask me as we walk towards the Ministry exit.
I see him choking on food, trying to breathe, swallow and speak at the same time. Something that seems like an impossible task. However, this guy can pull it off.
I put a ward between us and the next room. I'm sure Draco would be able to tear our house down right now. I have never seen my husband this upset before, not when Lucius dies, not when his mother passed away. Not when they made them stay in Azkaban for six months.
I hug him hard against myself, and then I am letting him go. My senses are screaming at me to hold into my soulmate forever, never letting go. But, as I clasp the bright red cloak I go back to one Lily Evans and a baby Harry Potter and I cannot let other kid being an orphan just because of Tom Fucking Riddle.
I feel jealous for a brief moment, because I just had a couple of minutes to lay down for a bit with my soulmate. This is not good. I can feel my skin itching and heart beating faster, my magic is starting to grow angry…
"I don't care who he is. He needs to get better," and she frees herself from my grip. "And I don't care if you are Harry Potter or Merlin himself, if you dare to stand between my patient and me again, I am going to hex you so hard, your great-grandfather will feel it. Did you hear me, kid?" She walks past me and I smile.
I look at Harry.
Draco is a genius, after all.
Hermione presents Harry with a new discovery. Harry start healing.
Then, it was back to Narcissa's case.
"So, are you happy that you no longer have nightmares?" I ask him and watch him blush.
Blaise shakes his head.
Colds?
But, empty words cannot work when people knows the truth and the darkness that comes with it. So, I let Draco cry himself asleep in my arms, while feeling my heart shattering in a thousand pieces with every tear that fall from his beautiful eyes.
“Draco,” Harry’s words interrupt my thinking and my notes for one of the auror’s case Head Robards asked me to help with.
“He is the one,” the old lamia says.
December 24th, 2002
I turn fast to look at Kreacher, whom is looking at me like if I am some kind of law offender. His eyes are glaring holes in my body.
December 28th, 2002
Hermione looks up at me, biting her lip, like she is actually fighting a battle between the good and evil.
I see him start running towards me and beyond his shoulder, I can see the girl who last time was holding her hand and laughing with the blonde. Without thinking twice, and without taking out my wand, I cast a hex of tangled legs at her, and I see her fall to the ground before she can open her big mouth to call Dray.
"Why?" Neekeal asks, looking at all of us.
"Why this new measure?" I ask, still not feeling entirely happy asking this.
I smile to Robards’ secretary and push open the door that will lead to my boss. I am barely twenty-four, but Robards and Hermione are always demanding to assist them in the most bizarre missions I have ever had the pleasure to be in. For example: last year we were involved in an explosion that blew off half of Triangle Alley, a shopping place for witches and wizards here in Wales.
"What is to be singul, Daddy?" Scorpius asks me out loud and everyone in the room stares at me.
Until a pinch on my nipple makes me come back to myself. And oh, my dick gets so hard, is painful.
How will he do it? Is it something all crazy geniuses know how to do?
“I trust Severus,” she claims softly. “Someone that turns up his best friend to keep good graces with our Lord is someone we should never doubt. Besides, Severus hates muggles due to that moodblood Evans.” She says Evans like they have personally kicked her puppy. But, come again. Maybe, she wouldn’t need this Evan to kicked it. I am much aware that she is capable… without her wand even.
Dray looks around the room and a smile is painted on his lips. And I can't help myself, I lean in and capture his lips with mine, trying to put into that simple act all the feelings that are running in my veins. My tongue carefully tracing Dray's lower lip and his mouth opens, letting me explore as I please.
“Let’s go. It’s time to end with this shit show,” I say to them. “Let find Rowena Ravenclaws treasure and then, we can bid them goodbye.”
His smile is sad again.
Arthur looks at me and laughs heartily.
"That's right," Harry tells me. “Time to get out of here. You're not quite ready yet. Close your eyes, Dray,” and I diligently obey Harry's command. "Think about our home, back in england, and our daugther, a winged serpent."
"And why not?" I ask him.
"But, Narcissa's body was found in France," says Hermione.
I nod gently.
I nod, holding him closer to my chest.
“No, it doesn't scare me,” his nose brushes against the skin of my neck and I feel a rush run down my back to my crotch. Eternal minutes pass and I think Dray is already in a deep sleep when I hear him murmur: "Dad is also a magician."
"The healer in charge of Narcissa Black during the time she was here, said that maybe we wanted to go for a walk there." I say and sigh heavily. "It was the hospital in charge of preparing her body for her funeral."
he says in a breath.
“Well, if you can, tell her to hurry up. His brain is swelling too fast for our liking and it’s not looking good,” Goldstein says while, moving his wand around Draco’s blond head. “This is blood dripping inside his head.”
Harry
"Is not it obvious?" he asks, but Parkinson and I stay mute. "He tried to commit suicide."
I feel him nod his head yes, but his hands are still clutching at my shirt hard.
“I will nurse him back to his snarky, prickly self,” I say to the old woman. “And I hope I can count with you to help all the way there,” I say, still gazing at Draco’s face.
Even when we sat down, everyone keeps their heads down. Most of them are fidgeting with their hands, their wands, I am even sure they are playing with their feet.
The boy lowered his eyes momentarily and made a gesture with his lips that reminds me of my own brother. He smiles at the floor and find serenity in it, as if it has soothing properties on the floor.
"I hope you find the Castle as fascinating as most of the young people who have passed through here," McGonagall tells him, extracting her hand. "Don't be late, Potter." She tells me again with an estern look.
Draco, nod, giving a peace of paper to the healer.
"I'm so sorry, my boy," Mrs. Weasley says to me and I feel her squeeze me in her arms. And even then it's not enough to make me feel less cold, less hurt, less broken...
It's funny, because she called me Mr. Potter and yet she retains that serenity of an ordinary worker.
"Chocolate frog?" he tells me, as he lifts the package in the air. I shake my head gently. "Tell me, Miss Granger, what is the subject you wish to discuss?"
"Do you know anything about a magical hospital in Warsaw?" I ask aloud to everyone.
"Harry," he says trying to beat the sleep away. "Stay by my side, please?" he asks me and I see him scope up to the other end of the bed. His breaths falling again.
"There was an accident on the Muggle side," she tells me, opening the folder.
"What's wearing Harry on his feet, Mione?" I ask her again without taking my eyes off her.
"And that's normal, Harry Potter," a voice that belongs to a ghost I've never seen tells me.
“Nop,” she says, wipping away the tears. Her voice strangled with sadness. “Magical Coma for Exhaustion,” she says it slowly, making every word clear for Draco. “I am sorry, Draco. Really.”
I glance back a Smart-Healer. She is a bit put out by this rebellious display of wills.
I nod and I quickly read the forms and start to fill it with knowledge of private things, secrets Draco and I have been exchanging over expensive bottles or whines, because God forbid the blond ever had anything less then the Jacky Trucht he loves a lot. He has an allergy to aconite, even if he is a potion master, he is always carrying a bessoir with him when he is to work with those. Chlorine odor cause him allergies too, and so I write all this in the form.
(See the end of the chapter for
And the door is opening.
"In two weeks," I tell him honestly.
James nods softly and he try to hid a shy smile. My husband kiss James' forehead and let the subject go.
“The first time we spent together the night…” I whisper and he nods softly. “But…” I pressure him.
"You took your sweet time," Goldstein tells us.
"Don't tell me," I reply sarcastically. "So you think you had it very difficult?" I ask him. "Studying a lot of spells every night," I tell him and I can feel my magic thundering around my body. "And tell me something, Moon," I say, taking a step forward. "How many times have you screwed up a mission?" I ask him in a whisper. “Because I've been on six missions with you, not counting the Narcissa Black case. And somehow, even though we never heard from her son, you managed to screw that up too."
"It's going to need wards and other bunch of high security shit."
I can't help but laugh at Dray's reference and the next second I feel the occamy sting me.
Nymphadora steps up at Kingsley’s side and I feel my face draining too. What is she doing here? Teddy is home sleeping and she is here… Doing what exactly? I swallow trying to gain my composure back when Ron hits my shoulder. I sigh trying to keep it quiet inside my own soul and body. I am pretty sure I am losing it.
"How long have you been with this boy?" Sirius asks me.
“Who else?” she asks me. “We need to know Harry. They took Regulus too. Regulus was too aware of the truth, and maybe Dray too.”
"Everything is going to be fine, Harry," she says trying to comfort me, now not only with her arms, but also with her words and her magic. “We will be with Dray the entire distance, and he won't even know that we are protecting him, because he was the one who invited us in the first place. If Voldemort remains angry that he cannot trespass on Narcissa Black's property and attacks Muggles to hurt you, we will be there and we will take Dray to safety. "
"You wish, Malfoy," I reply and conjure a chair to sit down.
“Has he any psychological scar?” he asks, softly, his wand resting on the table.
I laugh softly, as I pull him to me and conjure my wand. Then lead us to the door of the room.
I love you all guys!
“Maybe because he has experience riding one Harry Potter’s broom,” he says softly and I can feel my face hitting up to thousand degrees. “Yes, I am sure it’s that.”
I nod softly, casting an unbreakable charm on the damn box.
"You are not a monster," I tell him, taking a step forward, understanding Dray's feelings better.
Neekeal wastes no time and once we are seated, three manila folders fly up to us.
Now Neville works at Hogwarts, and this place is maintained thanks to Winky, the house elf who helps me to survive on clean underwear and robes without wrinkles or the smell of three-day sweat.
“I will conduct a last exam when he wakes up, but… I am pretty sure he cannot hear anymore,” he says softly, then he pats my shoulder. “I am sorry Mr. Potter,” he says, taking his coat in his hands.
Dray smiles at me and then I see him start to pull off his jumper. I turn around and walk out of the bathroom, closing the door behind me. I smile as I feel the slight magical pulse coming out of Dray's body, it feels stronger than yesterday, yet it's not big enough. With this force, not even a Wingwardium Leviosa could come out of a wand.
“She casted a strong spell on him to ensure his survival,” he says. “The thing is, the spell she used, out of love, was sucking on the nearest magical being alive at the moment.”
And I don’t pay any mind to the jealousy I felt back there. I start to rub Draco’s arms with both my hands, trying to apply enough pressure to create a warm feeling on his arms.
"Hello, Dray," I say, feeling a smile tug at the corner of my mouth. "Good day?"
I just care about one of those right now, and that person isn’t here.
"I'll see you later, Minister," she says, giving Kingsley a tight smile. "Auror Potter," she says softly, as she begins to walk towards the door.
"Aren't you coming?" she asks me in a serious tone.
"Yours, of course, Harry," he says in a purr and I swallow hard. "After all, someone made me wet my underwear last night," he smiles sweetly and I feel my cheeks burn once more.
"She was an excellent witch, very good at Defense Against the Dark Arts," he tells me, as his eyes move to a small portrait and I walk over to the cabinet and I can immediately see a girl in the Hogwarts uniform. Inscribed in the painting are small golden letters that read: "First Place: Defense Against the Dark Arts Club, Narcissa Black."
“Are you ready to go home?” I ask him, standing in his range of sight. I speak slowly deliberate.
I nod. Draco is not the suicidal type. He survived through a war, he spied for us. He is more resilient then anyone can imagine.
Hope is shinning on his face and I feel a pang of sadness, because I know Hermione better. I know she is withholding information. Information that can make or brake Draco today.
"Hands off my dough," I say to my husband, as I watch him put his fingers to his mouth and suck on it in a suggestive way.
I feel safe inside this cage, because now I am sure, this shit is absorbing the magic that comes not just from the outside, but from the inside too. I need to try to get out here.
January 7
"In June of the following year when the movie comes out," he tells me while smiling at me. "Now, have you thought about what kind of furniture you want in your apartment?"
“You are growing very fast. Your brothers too,” I say in almost a whisper.
“An immune what?” Bill asks, burring his nose in the white scarf around his neck.
"In a moment you will be able to go home, Ritta Skitter," our Lord says in a deadly hiss. “I just want the information that you have. I promise you that no other newspaper will publish it first than you. I just want the scoop, first of all. Just a few days before its release."
Scorpius gives him a Malfoy look and I can't help laughing to myself. His pose is similar to my mother's when she gets angry, and his gaze on the poor student makes me bite my tongue.
"With Grand Molly," I tell them in a serious tone. "I'll go see Daddy for a few minutes. "All three nod. "Scorpius, no tree climbing," I tell him in a serious tone and he pouts his lips.
"Why?" I ask her, reading the parchment.
"Mazurca," he corrects her fondly, as the melody changes. "But, you were close enough."
Something tickles my neck and I hug the pillow between my arms a bit more. After what happened yesterday with the members of the Order, the only thing I can think of is that their thinking is wrong and at the same time, I feel happy. Happy that Dumbledore is considering more than the greater good.
Cross looks at me.
"Fuck yourself on my fingers, love," I whisper against his ear and Draco obeys.
"What?" he asks them innocently.
Harry has been a really good friend these past days. His hands have been a constant reassurance that I am not dead… That Naggini didn’t took me as her meal in the night. I am really aware that I have been waking up screaming bloody murder every other night.
I nod to the nothing and keep my head looking forward. I have to swallow the fear in my throat and keep going to what I am supposed to be doing.
"Where will we take him if we find him alive?" Moon asks.
“Yes, love,” I say to him. “I will be here.”
Yeah, well... I am back. That reminds me that I will be busy for the next week, and maybe the update will be delayed a bit, but not for so much.
I watch him pulling something out of the pocket of his jeans and then pass me a light blue glove. I take it carefully and look again at the boy who usually plays every Friday in this same park.
“What was that?” Parkinson asks me.
“Okay,” I whisper brokenly. “I need to know about obscurials and Grindelwald and Patsy the house elf.”
"Harry?" Madam Pomfrey's voice makes me open my eyes and I immediately lean over to look at Harry. His fingers are massaging his temples and applying pressure to the point. "What happened?" Madame Pomfrey looks at me first and then at Harry.
“I thought he was just… a bit ill.” He says, turning pale. “He was at St. Mungo’s. Every patient that left is because they are healthy.”
"I already told you, Ron," I say seriously, as I stretch the leather jacket. "I'm dating someone."
So, I decided to talk to Draco and return two of each. So, my husband still makes breakfast in the morning and reads a story to the children at night. So my husband still waits for me on the living room couch reading and still talks to me every morning while we shower together. And he decided to help some of his college students via Zoom. Although Draco doesn't know how to use it very well, the kids help him and Dray enjoys helping them. Two hours a day, three days a week.
“Here it is,” he says, pointing to a few places where the net is not broken, most likely… unraveling. Not whining like the others parts, dim, dirty. I don’t like this. “We are going to see what he is processing right now, Mr. Potter,” he says softly. “I am going to need for you to talk to him, about anything.”
"Harry," Kingsley is the first to speak. “You called us here for a particular reason. What is that so urgent that you have to tell us on a Sunday? ”
"We'll be on time," says Hermione smiling to him. "We will not embarrass you."
“Why?” she asks me.
She nods softly, gripping hard her own jacket.
I nod softly, capturing his little finger with mine.
New chapter today. It was for yesterday, but I fell asleep (Shame on me). If you still hadn't read about how Harry brake Dray's seal, then you should go back to chapter 28.
I sigh, as I feel like a new headache is about to start.
"Is he okay?" I ask her, looking into her eyes.
Left comment and kuddos, those makes my day.
“I am sorry, Draco,” I try to comfort him again, but my own tears are threatening to scape my eyes, while I try to swallow a heavy sob stuck in my throat.
Chaos awakes.
“Luna is in the country right now,” she says softly.
“If you want I can stay home and ask Ron to take the kids to Auror day,” I offer again.
“For master Draco,” he says eying furiously at the healer.
However, James quickly shakes his head. His black hair moving at the same time as his little head.
I walk over to Teddy and put my hand on his head. Some crystals fall from his hair and I breathe a sigh of relief. My oldest son is fine.
Draco moves furiously between my arms until his face is buried in the crook of my neck.
I have been really busy this past days, but here is another chapter. Enjoy it with cookies and hot chocolate.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Papa loves me more!" he says in a serious tone and I pick him up off the floor to sit him on the kitchen island.
"You're right," I tell him, as I enter the Auror department.
I cast a mild notice-me-not charm and stand in the students entrance to my classroom.
“They are dating,” Auror Weasley says.
"I assure you, Regulus," her voice escapes her lips and fills the entire room. "He promised me that he would change and that our baby would be fine," a smile appears on her pale, tired face.
And I don’t fucking care about her.
I run my hands over my face and remember that I haven't changed my clothes and I haven't had breakfast either. However, I wish I could wait for Dray to start this meeting, but the blond is the last who should know about my involvement in this crappy war.
"My little boy," Narcissa says lovingly. "You carry your father's legacy in your eyes and in your hair," she tells him, stroking his hair. "And you carry your mother's legacy in your name and in your power," she says, while she passes a sweater over the little white head. "One day my little boy, you will conquer hearts," she says stroking his cheek. Huge blue eyes look at her from below, while a small hand reaches up. “With your power you will make them change, because my little one, wars are not won on battlefields. Wars my beautiful prince, are won in hearts. Great temples that guard secrets and the soul and heart of those who rules,” she twhispers to the boy, lifting him into her arms and cradling his little silver head against her chest. “If one day you want to win a war, my precious prince, remember that you must first seek strength in your heart and you will have to draw your strongest weapons: affection, tolerance, honor and respect. Those will be the weapons you will use to win wars, my boy,” she leaves a kiss on the boy's forehead. "Love can do everything my child, because loving is a decision and conviction is the only thing we need to change the world."
"You can come back to have dinner with us whenever you want," she says. "Either to breakfast, or to lunch, or if you just want a drink or talk to someone, or if you just need a hug," Molly is quick to whisper her love into our ears.
his glare is promising retribution now, too.
“Love,” I try to reach too him with my magic. And when he refuses to let me reach him, I try to reach him with my soul. Until he gives in to me, his body holding tightly to me.
“Moody was not supposed to break the seal in such an abrupt way. It was supposed to be you. ” Regulus tells me raising his face and burning me with his gray orbs.
"As Minister you shall know, Blaise Zabini was assigned a couple of days ago to find out the reason why there was a time-space disturbance," Hermione tells him in a serious voice. "Blaise found the reason for that disturbance yesterday night," her brown eyes serious. “Yaxley is no longer in Azkaban. Someone freed him last night. We think the disturbance that was caused exactly fifteen days ago, was a prepparing measure to ensure the freedom of the Death Eaters."
I walk into the kitchen and Draco's magic immediately envelops me. A bubble of silence is in place. I see Draco fill the teapot and pour watter into the kettle, ready to make tea muggle-style.
My powers.
"And where is your other Daddy?" the woman we meet the elevator asks him.
Immediately I feel the color fade from my face as I stand in front of the door. Dray takes my hand and pulls me into the store. Immediately the warmth of the place hits me squarely in the chest and I take a deep breath to calm my nerves.
GreeneySilvery
"Is Master Draco upset with Kreacher then?" he asks me, his shoulders sagging and his eyes starting to mist.
Blaise nods.
“Are you aware that if you are lying, Mr. Potter, we can rise charges against you?” smart-lady healer says.
"It is because she did not marry a pureblood," I tell them in exasperation. "Ted Tonks is a Muggle. Her family casted her out just for that crime she commited."
"Tomorrow, Mr. Potter, when the whole world sees what you did to your hair to celebrate your thirty-second birthday, you'll remember this, Harry," Draco whispers against my ear and I know I'm screwed. "You will remember screwing your husband, slowly and good."
Father scoffs.
"Harry," Dray calls me, tugging on my hand, his eyes on mine, mine on Rowle. I see Rowle turn quickly.
"But, didn't you believe in the purity of the blood?" I ask him, looking him in the eye.
"I remember my wedding with Cissy like it was yesterday, Sev," I tell him, conjuring up a glass of whiskey. "I still remember her dark eyes looking into my soul the day we got married," I look down at the floor, thinking of all we could have experienced together. "If only..." I lift my eyes and look to where the necklace rests. “If only Sibyl Trilauny had kept her mouth shut. If only she hadn't spoken of our son in the presence of Dumbledore."
"This is Sirius," Harry says to the white-haired boy, as I watch out of the corner of my eye as Molly makes everyone else leave the room to give the three of us some space. "He's almost like my father," Harry scratches the back of his neck and tries to sound friendly. “And then there is Mr. Weasley… Ah. Arthur, he is like a father too,” he tells Dray again, practically stumbling over everything he says. "Sirius was ... uh ... in jail?"
Hermione rolls her eyes.
"What?" and all the eyes are on Regulus Black.
Sure shit.
“Don’t stood me up, deal?” he asks me, his lips moving gently for me to read.
"Which one is mine?" I ask him.
"Tonks?" Ron asks, as if he knows something is wrong with that name. "That is not a pureblood surname."
How this woman can keep going?
Maybe if there was confusion inside my head it would be easier for Harry, but he let go and I don't try to touch him again. I think about his eyes when he is happy and soft snoring sounds while he is sleeping. This is not a rejection, this is Harry needing a moment. Just that, like when he is sleeping, he body needs a moment to keep going.
“No. Ginevra, told me in Christmas,” I point out to her. “She was trying to be nice in that odd way of hers.” I smile, remembering her attempts at throwing me the weird ball, her efforts to talk to me without insulting me in a way or the other.
Sweet irony will never be lost on me.
I smile at nothing, as I watch the boy's blond hair dance with the wind that blows in the city. Dray looks over his shoulder at me and his eyes shine with such joy that my heart hurts. This is why I must defeat Voldemort, this is why I have discover what power I possess that he does not.
"All the students are going home tomorrow afternoon, Dray," I tell him, as I watch him put on wizard's clothes.
The nurse conjures the wheelchair for him and extends Draco his wand to him. Draco lets a slight Scorugify fall on him and begins to move towards the exit.
"Oh, believe me, Draco was the person who made me make the most trips to the hospital wing," I reply to Teddy.
I pressed Dray to my body, enveloping him with my magic, but nothing happens. His screams and moans of pain still reverberate in the room.
"Wao, then, he must be around the same age as you," Hermione tells me, as she stops at the Brethren fountain.
“There’s a baby,” I say softly.
You don’t survive a fucked-up childhood, a fucked-up teenager years with fucking Voldemort breathing down your neck, his lackies trying to stab you left and right… And the Auror Weasley being jealous of you, revoking the other Harry a sense of having a family, and end up without any mental scaring.
I smile, while reaching Saint Mungo's reception area.
I swallow.
He shakes his head.
I look out to where Dray is tucking a brown cello between his legs. The black square looking up at him from a black stand with some sheets, while Harry is sitting under the apple tree watching Dray, who plays the instrument in some moments and speaks to the black square in others. Calm returns to Harry as the conversation between the black square, the blonde and the cello progresses. A smaller but loving smile appearing on Harry's lips, his eyes trained on the blond.
I left the head of the strangers.
Neither should I, but here we are.
I open my mouth trying to say something, but I think about it better. I cannot hear myself, really, I can barely feel the vibrations if I press my hand on my throat. I think about the words I want to say to Harry.
Dray holds his cello in a very peculiar way, then bows to his audience and returns to his seat in the orchestra. The applause slowly ceases and I feel comforted. A new piece starts and I feel satisfied. In my arms, Teddy is still sleeping. In front of me, the most beautiful man I have ever seen, keeps smiling and playing. And by my sides, my best friends smile at each other with undying love.
"Hello, love," I hear Draco's voice and immediately feel relief run through my whole body.
“Wha- What? How?” he says, his voice cracked, while he keeps trying to swallow and breath at the same time.
My hand travels to the head of my best friend, the person who has shared with me for so many years, and my fingers found the first strands of silky hair and I feel him cling his delicate hands to the shirt I am wearing.
“The year of the weird tournament, right?” I try to keep my mind on this.
"And Ronald is Harry's partner," she tells me softly.
Harry is a self-sacrificing little shit. I have never doubt that. He is callous when he is upset, he is quite when he is sad and contemplative when doubts assault his mind and his heart. I start thinking of all the songs I have been sharing with Harry, and all the feelings he points while listening to them.
And everything is fine, until it is no longer.
“The ghost lady at Hogwarts told us about this…” I mumble.
“Take care of daddy while I am gone, Nesh,” I say to her, lifting her to my face and dropping a kiss to her beak.
Her moonlight hair, just as pale blond as mine, made me feel less awkward back when we were at Hogwarts. The few times we meet with each other in the Forbidden Forest to talk with the one Firenze, was the most memorable moments I had the pleasure to bask in while a war was ragging over the Wizarding World.
I am posting this before a two hour exam, so enjoy it!
"Almost done," he whispers against my neck and I feel him bite me softly. "One more, Harry."
He lifts her hand full of homemade popcorn while the Stitch is up in a strange ship that’s sailing to space. And I think about my own mother, how she did work so hart in one saving. And I feel a bit jealous of my own boyfriend. His dad is always working in little savings… Because he is expecting to spent a lot of time with his son.
"Anything new to offer me about the case of Liam West?" Robards asks, and the whole room sighs.
Dray peels his face off my chest and his skin is so pale, he looks like a ghost. His eyes sweep all the people in the room and his eyes stay glued to...
Because if rich kids know how to be one thing… That’s how to be mean to the people their dislikes.
"She never did, Harry," Ron tells me sincerely. "It have been over for more then five years. She broke with you. She was hating herself before she yelled she hated you."
"That's stalkers knowledge, 'Mione," Ron tells me, while laughing at me.
Harry follows me in my caresses towards little Occamy. His praises are gently flapped in an attempt to keep his balance and not let go of the gentle strokes.
God, he is so beautiful while sleeping and I hate waking him up.
“Of course, I will do great, Harry,” he says, patting me in the back. “I have a reminder of good times here,” he says, caressing the white scarf and then rolling the tear of the necklace between his fingers. “I will see you in thirty minutes. Take care of your little dragon,” he says. “Get better soon, brat,” he says to Draco smiling to the unconscious blond.
