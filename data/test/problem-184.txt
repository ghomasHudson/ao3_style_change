"Maybe I don't ask for help because I don't need it, Harry," he says trying to get up from the bed but failing miserably
"Let's go Pansy, I'm freezing and you guys are only going to be apart for 5 days, you'll survive," the desperation was noticeable on Blaise's voice, but Harry couldn't blame him considering that he, once again, had to give Draco his gloves and scarf because the boy was a firm believer that he was Elsa from Frozen but oh no, he wasn't, the cold did bother him and Harry hated when the blond get sick.
"Sadly"
"I have a present, I was too scared to give it to you but then I remembered that moo-vie we watched, Tangled? And Rapunzel would not be proud of me if I hold back just because I'm afraid," Draco said in a quiet voice catching Harry's attention, they had been finishing their potions essay for the last hour and now the common room was empty aside from a couple of Ravenclaws.
"I just feel like I'm the fucked up in this relationship and I'm afraid I'm pulling you down with me," explained Draco against Harry's chest and he felt the other boy sigh and pulled away a little, Harry laid down properly beside him and hugged him again.
"I'm afraid that you'll need to ask some questions regarding today's events, but for now I'll let you rest, 100 points from Gryffindor and Slytherin, tomorrow expect a letter for you to go to my office, goodnight boys"
"Do you want to share what happened back there or..?"
"Why are you here?" Draco asked in a broken voice
"I don't think this was a good idea Potter"
"Cold," the pale boy stuttered and Harry took off his sweater and wrapped Draco in it, trying to not touch Draco's cuts that, even if they weren't bleeding anymore, would sting if he did so.
"I wonder the same thing, but I'm too scared to tell you about my feelings," answers Draco and falls asleep immediately, the only thing in his mind is how different Harry's hands feel from Theo's, so loving yet kind of rough. Like he could rip his heart out but treasure it forever protecting it from any harm.
“Sir, you haven't told us what's in that one,” a Slytherin girl asked.
In the end, it looked something like: Draco needs to ride a car, a motorcycle, take the subway to somewhere, watch a movie on a movie theatre, watch a season of British Bake Off, go to a museum and do something totally crazy. And Harry needed to change his wardrobe (because Draco said he dressed worse than Filtch), get presents for Neville, Pansy, Blaise and Andromeda (the fact that he already had one for Draco remained unmentioned), teach Draco how to cook something cool and do something he had wanted for a while.
“Okay, I know how stubborn you are, but let’s not push our luck, if something weird happens I promise we’ll take Malfoy seriously,” promised the ginger boy and even though it didn’t felt like enough Harry had to agree with him, with all the events that had happened since Sirius death he had been a little bit too paranoid and maybe, just maybe, he was seeing things where there was nothing to see.
The ride was wonderful, their noses ended up like Rudolph's, so red and cold they looked ridiculous but they manage to regain body heat between kisses and laughs. They fell asleep on the couch, cuddling with a big blanket not caring about their poor necks that would suffer from the awful position.
“Just fuck off already, we’ve been dying to see the day you fix your stupid crooked nose, and yet, here we are,” and with that, he took his stuff and left the common room.
Maybe that was just a side plan Harry had to not mess up the surprise he had for tomorrow, and later Draco would actually know that it was indeed a distraction, but for now Harry had won their battle of expressing how much they loved each other.
“Then why yours are so bad? Yours held a story too and I bet he would love to hear about it too,” Luna answered while grabbing another apple to feed the thestral in front of them. “I know you too well Draco, I spent a long time seeing you almost daily being terrified of your life and you have the same look right now, you’re terrified of what could happen if you say yes. But just remember that you haven’t considered what would happen if you say no”
Or where Harry begins to wonder whether things would've been different if he had shaken his hand with Draco in the first year.
"It was a letter from my mother," the blonde shrugged and ate another macaron.
"Well, now that that is solved, would you guy like a cup of tea?" offered Andy and they both nodded, no one said a word about how Teddy's hair now resembled the platinum tone of Draco's.
Or where we get to see what the future holds for them.
“They were good friends once, you know? We all were, but then he became obsessed with you and that childish game you played of being the alpha man or whatever and they started to drift apart, when the summer of 4
, not just 'a partner'" Draco was blushing deeply while giving his rant, "but if you don't like it I can just-"
And of course, Harry knew that the mark had nothing to do with Draco, but then again he spent the last 9 years hating him so he needed reassurance that testifying had been the right choice. But when he asked Luna her reasons to testify in his favour she just gave him one of her loopy smiles and shrugged saying that they were not the only ones who had survived a war. Fred told him that Draco saved his life by recasting the unforgivable to the one who had cast it. And Ginny said that he was always trying to protect the little ones and never told anyone where they were hiding even though he totally knew.
"Right back at you, love, I love you so much."
“Can we focus on
"Sure we can, I don't know why I have a feeling you're gonna enjoy Frozen, you hungry?" Harry asked and Draco nodded, so they both head to a restaurant they passed earlier.
The sounds Draco made along with his pale hands grabbing Harry's shirt was a good sign, but when he tried to take off Draco's shirt he felt the hesitance and stop.
"I mean, it's not that I want to go, but I feel like I need to, you know? I mean, I just want to know where I'm standing and what am I supposed to do after I find out" Draco finished to button his shirt and grabbed his coat, "I just need to know Harry, please don't be mad"
"I wasn't much help to the Aurors, but they said that with what you had already testified my father wouldn't see sunlight in a while and hope it's true."
“Why don’t you come to sit with us?” He asked, not really wanting to look at Hermione’s nor Ron’s faces “the wagon is big enough and it would be a waste if only us 3 use it”
Where Teddy needs a birthday week
“Oh no, it would be hypocritical of me to judge you when I spent part of my summer shagging boys and girls,” he said pretty casually and Pansy started laughing making him almost misses the deep blush in Draco’s cheeks.
"Well, I don't know a lot of things either, but if you want we can learn together," the green-eyed boy smiles and Draco looks at him with wondering eyes
"I would like to see you try."
Where Draco says he's too broken to be fixed
“You know what, I should go to muggle London to buy one of those, I’m tired of hearing Ron’s attempts of singing in the shower,” he says jokingly and Hermione laughs, it’s no secret that Ron sucked at singing, but he didn’t blame the guy when the only artist he knew by hear was Celestina Warbeck. “You could come with me, I bet you would love it, and of course it would help with your class,” he said at Draco with a smile and the blond looked at him in shock.
Where Draco wonders about the taste of Harry's lips
"How dare you, I don't remember losing, never," he joked while Ron was trying to swallow his food to speak
"Put on a warm jacket and meet me at the front"
Noticing that he no longer had anything to do in the library, he decided to go back to the 8th year common room.  Once he arrived he saw Ginny chatting with Ron, so he decided to join.
“You’re a dork” Draco mumbles against Harry’s lips
“Well, it’s on the 10
When Harry realizes that he found love where it wasn't supposed to be
"Oh Draco, you used to be better at lying," Draco didn't expect the cruciatus curse but once he felt it he wasn't surprised at it.
"No mattering the scars, I love you as a whole, not just your perfect bits"
5.- Pro – He had known him for almost 9 years.
"I honestly don't know, I was terrified of everyone in that house. And when I saw you I wanted to die so much because I really thought it was the end, but then I remembered no one knew how you looked, only my parents but Granger did a nice job with that spell so I saw a chance and took it. I just needed to buy you guys time, I thought of modifying the wards so someone could come and help you guys but then I figured that wouldn't happen so I just said I wasn't sure it was you. I was so grateful to Dobby when he came for you and your friends, I had so much hope again but that died really quick." Draco shivered and started to play with Harry's free hand.
The next morning Harry woke up to a high pitch scream and got off bed so quickly he almost fell, taking his wand from under his pillow and running to where the noise came from.
"Well, that's normal considering the blood loss Mr. Malfoy, why don't you go and ask Madame Pomfrey for the potions Ms. Granger?"
“I just want to know what I’m feeling, and why am I feeling this way” he answered vaguely and she just nodded, “how do you do it? How do you decide whether someone is worth it before even getting to know them?”
"You are the worst Potter," laughed Draco as he got up to search another book for his Potions essay. What Harry had noticed as well, and let's pause for a second to appreciate how much things Harry had noticed considering how oblivious he tends to be, was that Professor Slughorn no longer ignored Draco in class, and he actually acknowledges how good he was at it, he loved how excited Draco got when he was praised for his work and how happy he was when the potions turned out amazing. Harry almost wished he could see is Draco was like that with his friends when he was little, or even with Snape considering he was his godfather and all.
Soon his thoughts were interrupted by steps, if the room wasn’t so quiet he wouldn’t have heard them, but he did so he turn his head to see who was it. When he recognized the frail figure of his roommate he said a quiet ‘hi’, the blond barely acknowledges it but begin to come close to Harry anyways.
Stupid kid, he was stealing his boyfriend with cute words, not that he was wrong, but still. Ever since Draco entered Harry's life a lot of things seemed to change for the better, first one was that for the first time in his life he learned how magic money and Gringotts worked; he also learned that the Prophet might be a stupid-ass newspaper full of lies, but when needed it could be very useful (like when he needed people to understand that he wasn't under a love potion or being blackmailed by Draco). And finally he began to understand that nothing was black or white, rather grey, even when he didn't agree with a lot of pureblood traditions Harry now understands the reasons behind them, and well, sometimes it makes sense.
"Sure, we can go to the movies tomorrow if you want," Draco nodded not really knowing what that was but still excited to see
"I'll leave you two alone, see you tomorrow Draco, I'll let Pansy know you're okay," Blaise half-smiled and left the infirmary.
"He's dead, you're just taking revenge over something that it's over, get over the past Theo, just because you got your way with me doesn't mean I'll allow it again, also, say goodbye to your pretty status because I will end you," answered Draco while taking a step away from him.
"But no one can help you if you won't tell what's wrong"
“I did try to warn him, but he was worse than a little kid refusing to re-apply sunscreen when I say so,” the curly-haired said as they searched for an empty wagon. He honestly wasn’t paying much attention to his surroundings, so it wasn’t a surprise when he bumped into someone, what indeed was a surprise is that someone happened to be Draco Malfoy.
"Dance with me?" he heard his husband ask and the blond just raised an eyebrow but took the hand he was being offered anyways.
"Yeah, about that, your godson can be very persuasive and we got a portkey waiting for us to take us to that stupid place with the rat mascot," the resigned tone in Andromeda's tone, "I had to threaten the twins, I can't handle another problem with the government because muggles needed to be obliviated due to their pranks," she sighed.
“Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck. Desperately tricky to make, disastrous should you get it wrong. One sip and you'll find that all of your endeavors succeed. At least until the effects wear off. So this is what I offer each of you today. One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student who in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Dead. Recipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books. Issue one doubt, however. Only one set of student manage to brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize. Nevertheless, good luck to you all. Let the brewing commence.”
"Oh, I'm okay, you'll be cold otherwise"
"Was it Clouds the one who warned you?" Draco asked after a long silence, his head was in Harry's chest and Harry loved how their breathing was now synchronized.
Where Draco feel all his hurts go away
"Can you try and breathe with me, love? See how I do it? Try to do it like that, please," the blond one tried to do as told, coughing while trying to mimic Harry's breathing, but after a full minute, he managed to succeed. "You are doing so good love, so well, can you let me know if you're feeling light-headed?" Harry asked, he started to wonder what was taking Hermione so long, but calmed a little when Draco shook his head no.
"Still suspicious Potter, you're plotting something and I'm going to figure it out,"
“Well, I have my ways, you know as the chosen one I can get whatever I want” joked Harry and Draco rolled his eyes, “I’m kidding love, I just sneaked into the kitchens and asked if they could make some since I know it’s your favourite.”
So when the morning came by, despite not sleeping almost nothing, he decided that maybe he could be friends with the git… Befriending Draco Malfoy, he almost laughed at the thought but then he sighed, he couldn't deny that there were a lot of questions he always wanted to ask him. Like why he saved him that night at his manor or why he threw his hand to him when he came back from death. Or maybe there was still a lot of guiltiness inside of him from that day at the bathroom where Harry almost killed him or a little bit of anger for not receiving a "thanks" for saving him at the Room of Requirement. There were many mysteries around Draco Malfoy that in the end being his friend was his best, and only chance, to get some answers.
“I know you’re not okay, and that’s okay. We don’t have to talk if you don’t want to, and if you do I can wait until you can” He whispered and smiled when he noticed that the blond hugged him back beginning to sob softly. Harry doesn’t know how long they lasted like that, at some point, his hand started to pet Draco’s hair and soon they were laying down on the sofa, Draco slightly on top of him. He wasn’t crying anymore but Harry assumes that this was something the boy was craving so he didn't say anything to disrupt the peace.
"One question, I think I'm ready for one question," Harry holds his breath because there were a lot of questions he wanted to ask, but it also felt wrong to ask something without giving Draco the same opportunity.
Where Draco learns that maybe making friends is not the worst thing ever,
“You should just talk to him, I think you know him well enough to figure out how he hates to be lied to, or that things that include him are hidden from him,” said Luna while caressing Ginny’s hand with her thumb.
"How could I possibly think about anything when I have you next to me driving me crazy?"
Where Draco learns about the muggle world and loves everything about it
Before they decided to adopt her, Draco was scared, because lets be honest, either of them grew up in suitable households. Draco grew up being spoiled to death and Harry was neglected as hell, and even when one could think that finding a middle point between those situations Draco found it really hard because he wanted their kids to have everything their little hearts desired but he also wanted them to be humble and to earn their things instead of growing up demanding them.
The spent a little bit more time in the tower until it was close to curfew, so they started to be on their way back to the common room, halfway the road Draco paused and stared at Harry. “You called me Draco”.
"It's going to be alright, I promise,"
And yes, Harry could clearly see why she was getting too old for this, Teddy was sitting on the ground with a mess of chocolate powder around him and his hair was bright pink. Low key he felt a bit jealous sometimes about Teddy's childhood and how different it was from his, but then he forgot about that and felt relief about it and tried to make it even better with whatever he could.
be alone. And don't get him wrong, Draco wasn't complaining about his childhood, he had all the toys he wanted and sometimes he could manage to make a hose-elf (almost always Dobby) to play with him. He wonder what happened to him, last he heard Harry set him free (and he was glad because out of their servants he was one of the most poorly treated, or at least he heard Granger said that once).
"yeah, just the ones in your arm but I feel like there's more and I'm pretty scared to ask about them, because I feel some of them has been caused by me and I need to know but not yet, is that okay?"
"I know that I just... I think I need to be away from everything magic-related, you know? And I happen to know someone who needs that as well, so I think I just want a boring muggle diner and a movie," Harry smiled while taking his bag so they could head to the train. "And I'm going to be there for boxing day, so don't miss me too much."
"May I come in?" The boy asked in a small voice, and Harry nodded immediately, his eyes never leaving Draco's face. His big grey eyes were red and he saw the dry tears on his cheeks. But he also saw the milky thighs underneath the big jumper he was wearing, if  this situation was different Harry was sure as hell he would be hard "I'm sorry for waking you up, I just don't want to be alone but I can leave if you-"
"Dear good, I almost passed out when I saw that damn dragon, I thought you were hurt," was the first thing Harry said when he saw Draco standing outside the office
"Well, considering how much Lily screams I think we can handle a bit of noise," joked Harry and Draco smiled, their daughter did scream a lot, she says that it makes her feel free and more heard, and as long as it's not hurting or annoying anyone other than Draco, they don't really see a problem.
And if Draco didn't understood why the twins were threten, the next day was proof enough for him to know that owning a pranking store does things to you. God knows they still cringe everytime they talk about that time Fred and George made a rum who made the drinker say their darker secret, Harry definitely didn't need to know that Ron had called Hermione 'mommy' once during sex.
"No, not really but I feel I need to know it"
"You look exactly like Cissy" was the first thing the woman said before starting to tear up and attempting to hug Draco, but the small whimper from the boy refrain her from doing so. "I'm sorry, I just- I don't know, I'm glad to see that my sister managed to give birth to a beautiful boy"
“So you mean it? This is not a joke, right? This is actually happening and you actually love me,” said the blond more to himself than to Harry. “Oh Merlin, you
Where Harry only feels complete when he's with Draco
and yes, they were only boys, they both had to do what they needed to survive but after he saw Draco at his trial he wondered if he was trying to survive at all. His once perfect silver hair was unattended, his grey eyes were too dark and his skin looked sickly pale. He remembers him just nodding and waiting for it to end, not a single drop of hope in his face, not even when Harry started to tell the ministry that Draco has saved his life two times.
Or where Harry finally gets what he needs and stop being incomplete
"Even above all that fancy chocolates that you used to eat?"
"No need to dear, if it's in Hogwarts then it's
“Pans, you’re dating Blaise, I swear that was something we thought it wouldn’t be possible” joked Draco and she rolled her eyes “I swear! He’s so cold and masculine and then there is you, with a thousand friends and making out with Daphne every time you got drunk” Harry was shocked from this, he never thought Pansy was bisexual, but he guesses this shock wasn’t interpreted as that because Pansy asked in a very defensive tone if he had a problem with it.
“I think Harry can give us more to avoid our blackmail” answered Seamus not noticing Harry was already awake.
“What’s that?” the blond said as their hands brushed, both of the boys blushing at this.
“The war is over Malfoy, everyone is trying to move on, and so does we so maybe we should call it a truce and try to know each other and then decide if you were really a git or not,” said Ron to everyone’s surprise “also, you saved my brother’s life, so I can’t really hate you for that”
"So, today we need to go shopping because Christmas Eve is tomorrow and we have nothing but toast and leftover pizza on the fridge," said Harry as he takes a sip of his coffee.
“Wait, so
“I mean yes, but have I ever told you the story about how he tried to defend himself with a chair instead of using his wand? He’s so stupid,” he laughed lightly, “and he’s so stupidly in love with you, in a way he has always been, not that I would’ve condoned a relationship between you two back then because it would’ve been so toxic… but now, Draco, you two have been through hell and back, he deserves to be happy but so does you so my best advice is to follow your heart and not your mind.” And with that, they began to chat about other things.
"I just keep wondering why you never ask questions, because I know you have them, we all do. But you never ask questions, and I fear is because of the answers you might receive and I hate to feel that if you knew those answers you wouldn't love me the way you do"
"What's going on?" Draco finally asked and he immediately had his boyfriend on his side taking his hand.
After that they got into their costumes and went Trick-or-treating for a couple of hours, the toddler was too tired by the time he arrived home, he has shown both boys his new ability, he could change the form of his nose now. Then he proceeded to change his hair colour the same hue as Draco's, and Harry had to explain to him that he only did so with people he felt comfortable with.
One hour later and a small vial of Felix Felicis in his hands later made Harry think that maybe this book would be a good way to gain Slughorn's trust.
Draco's breathing became way quicker than before and Harry was afraid that he was gonna pass out
"I believe not Professor," answered Harry on behalf of him, because honestly Draco was just too shocked because people tend not to believe him, not that he hadn't given people reasons to not believe him, but still this feeling was so foreign yet so amazing.
But that was something to deal tomorrow, for now, he just let himself sleep.
The bone cracking kind of pain began again, only this time he felt as he was on fire, so much pain in so many places, he was sure he was screaming as loud as never before. He wanted to be safe, to this to stop, he couldn't concentrate in anything but how Harry's arms felt around him and how much his patronus shined in the darkness Draco's thoughts created.
“I had a hunch, I’m glad I was right,” he said as he began to look around, several minutes passed until he decided to talk again, “I was here that night, you know?” he saw Malfoy tense in the corner of his eye and waited for him to say something but when that didn’t happen he let himself continue “Dumbledore petrified me and hid me with the invisible cape, I saw the desperation in your eyes and even if I didn’t understand it then now I know that you were just a pawn in a game way bigger than us, so when you saved me those two times I was so confused and tried to still hate you, but in the end, I couldn’t do it because you were just a kid like I-“
“He received a letter from his mother this morning, and then he had an argument with Nott, so I don’t know what you know or what you’ve heard but I do know that you’ve always managed to find him so please, find him,” he said with a stern voice and continued to comfort Pansy saying that everything was going to be alright.
"Oh my dear, I've missed you so much," was the first thing Narcissa said as Draco entered the dining room, it was still full of bad memories, no matter how many times it had been cleaned the smell of blood reminded him of those dreadful days and nights full of screaming and begging.
“We thought you stood us up, then Blaise reminded me how long Draco takes to get ready and decided to wait for you guys for a bit more,” half-joked Pansy taking a sip from her glass of wine and Draco just rolled his eyes.
"I wanted to apologize, I didn't know what that spell did and yet I used it on you, it's one of the few things I regret in life, and I'm not saying this because we're together now, I wanted to apologize since day one, but I never knew how," Harry paused, "I figured that 'sorry I almost killed you' sounded too bad and then a lot of shit happened so yeah.."
He hated this house, he hated the memories he had craved on his brain and how all the light was gone. How this living room was once full of blood and how he could hear the screams of pain and horror from his room, how much he wanted to die each night he couldn't help anyone. Draco knew that if he inherited the manor he would burn it down to the ground in hope it would take all the darkness away.
In the end, they woke up again at midday, both too hungry to continue sleeping. The day before they had watched the entire first season of British Bake Off and today they decided they were going to try and make the greatest dessert ever, to be honest, Draco just hoped for them to be better than the person who made those awful meringues.
"Oh my gosh, Draco got one? What is it? I bet is something badass like a dragon or a wolf"
"Hey, are you okay? You've been really quiet since I arrived, I'm really sorry about the mess, I know how much you hate when-" Draco kisses Harry in order to shut him up. "Well, I won't complain about your shushing methods, but my question still stands," the black-haired boy smiles while caressing Draco's cheek.
"Can we watch a movie?" The way Draco asked reminded him of Teddy when he asked to extend his bedtime, so Harry couldn't help but smile sweetly.
And that was another topic, Draco acted to different when things got a little bit more heated than usual, he never said no but Harry could feel how the blond's body tensed or flinched at certain movements and the last thing he wanted was to push his boundaries, not mattering whether he had to wait a million years or just a couple of minutes.
It took them about ten minutes to finish getting ready and arriving at the Great Hall, once there Draco mumbles a ‘thanks’ and hurried to meet with Parkinson, so he decided to do the same with his friends.
Or where Harry show's Draco what it feels to be loved
Draco finished reading the letter and sighed deeply while throwing it to the flames and ran upstairs, most likely to their room, Harry tried to ignore it knowing that if he went after him right now the blond would most likely kill him. After all he has learned how to read Draco's moods and reactions, and this time it was a clear 'I want to be alone, but if you want to come up later with something sweet I'll love you forever', and so he respected his wishes and continue talking with Hermione about her new discovery.
“Maybe Granger did the whole thing and he just took credit,” suggested Crabbe but Pansy shook his head
"I never ask questions not because I don't want to know the answers but because I don't know if you're ready to give them. I sure as hell am not ready to tell you a lot of things, and that's okay, because I know you won't push so I don't really understand why it's okay to push
"Oh yes, I'm having trouble too, is it the last problem?" Draco nodded just to shift the attention from him to her and attempted to listen because he was indeed having some troubles, but then again he had a lot of those. He had tried to solve them the night before but a panic attack ruined his plans and he ended up crying with his face between his hands wishing there was someone beside him, a certain boy came to mind but he tried to ignore those feelings as best as he could.
"There's nothing cooler than a magic carpet Harry"
So maybe this year would be his calm before the inevitable storm like his third year was. Please let this year be that, it was all Harry wished for, but oh well, heroes always had tragic stories and Harry Potter wasn’t going to be the exception to the rule.
"Well yeah, but you don't have to get an 'it's not a phase mom' kind of style dude, just leave it longer or style it differently"
but he likes to believe that his birthday should last a week so he has small celebrations all the week, so even though this year his birthday lands on Saturday we start celebrating since Monday,” Harry answers and proceeds to tell the name of the reservation, once inside the restaurant he placed Pansy and Blaise, and now he understood what Draco meant by ‘you should use some of that money you have to learn and dress nicer'.
love me,” the boy began to panic and before he could fall into a spiral Harry grabbed his arm and hug him.
"Do you trust me?" said Harry as he offered his hand to Draco
“About that… there’s something I need to tell you,” he paused as he felt Draco’s body tense, “remember that night when you asked me what was like to fell in love with someone? At first, I was going to say yes, and my answer still stands but for different reasons. I once thought I love Cho but then I realized it was a crush that ended in the worst teenage drama ever,” he laughed and Draco relaxed a little still unsure on where was this going. “Then I thought I loved Ginny, and I do, but not in the way I once thought I did. And that’s okay because I realized that the only person I’ve ever felt something so powerful for… is you, and it doesn’t matter if that feeling was once hatred because right now I’m utterly and deeply in love with you and it’s totally fine if you don’t feel the same way but I can’t stand another day without-“
In the end the little Dragon was the best gift either of them received yet, what either of them knew was that Draco was going to make use of it earlier than expected.
"I only have one scar left, the other ones disappeared with potions and lotions, do you want to see it?"
And so they began their journey, Draco felt weird being alone with her, but he also felt so at ease, it was like it was them against the world, everyone was looking at them but not because she was with an ex-death eater, but because
“The rooms are already distributed and no, there are no changes, so I hope you sleep well and once again, welcome home” with that McGonagall leaves the room and the others start to move around exploring the place and so.
year came by Draco felt so lost and when he looked for comfort in Theo he was just left hanging” Pansy said sadly “I’m just letting you know this because I don’t know what your intentions are, you don’t seem like a bad person and I know we owe you our lives and all that jazz, but I swear I would kill you if you hurt him, I don’t care if I end up in Azkaban for the rest of my life, if there’s someone among us who deserves happiness is that stupid boy and if he finds it with the golden trio then let it be it” she sighed and offered him a last smile before leaving the common room.
And of course, he would be miserable, things would get awkward between them and the perfect relationship both of them had created will be gone, his safe space would disappear because he wouldn’t be able to go to the Astronomy Tower as often as he did now, being in the same dorm would be an agony because Harry never closed his curtains and whenever Draco couldn’t sleep he just had to glance at the sleeping boy beside him to calm down.
“Because I wouldn’t say no to you, never, I love you so fucking much I feel like I’m dying and I don’t want that to be a reason for you to stay with me when you no longer feel like that, I don’t want to hold you down, you deserve nothing but happiness and I’m afraid I won’t be able to make you happy and-“
“Hello,” a dreamy voice said from behind, Luna’s hand was intertwined with Ginny’s. “How was the ride? I didn’t see you guys yesterday” she continued as the two girls sat beside Hermione. Ron began to tell them about the ‘madness’ their return to Hogwarts has been and that's when Harry's eyes locked with Ginny’s, he couldn’t help but smile at her and she did the same soon returning to pay attention to the chat.
The 1rst of September came faster than he wished, lately, his sleeping schedule had been worse than usual, barely sleeping more than 2 or 3 hours per night, and even then, his appetite was barely there, and the constant reminder of his inevitable failure creeping in the back of his mind. He really wasn’t joking when he told Pansy that if he had to pass another year in this hell he would throw himself out of the Astronomy Tower. But of course, nothing ever happens the way he plans it, because once again, Harry fucking Potter was a step behind him, so close to catching him yet not managing it, oh how much Draco wished for him to be caught, maybe death in the hands of the savior or his order would be more merciful than life in the hands of his family and their master. But in the end, villains always had the worst end possible and the quicker Draco gets that in his head, the better.
Harry had been alone a lot of times before his 11th grade after he arrived at Hogwarts that changed forever and he was eternally grateful. He knew he could rely on his best friends and everyone that loved him, he knew that very well. But this time he didn't felt alone, he felt incomplete and the only way to finish the puzzle was to get the answers he intended to get since the beginning.
"May I be retired?" The grey-eyed boy and his mother shoot him a look full of fear. "It's getting late and I'm sure our guests are tired as well"
"I love it, thank you," Harry kissed lightly Draco's lips and reached for his gift and hand it to the boy, "I saw this and immediately thought of you so I hope you like it."
"You also learn that when you live in a house full of death-eaters," muttered Draco and regretted doing it, anytime he talked about that time of his life people either told him he deserved bein scared of it because he chose that path or they gave him a glance full of pitty and changed topics.
A couple of weeks later he learned that Elizabeth (that was her name) always felt alone and that being dead didn’t make a difference in her life, she always felt alone and people were mean to her, just like now. Maybe Draco never learned how to make friends, but it was never too late to learn, after all, if he messed up he could just stop going to that bathroom.
"Just because someone had your back in the process doesn't mean we did it for you, love, don't put yourself down, you don't deserve it"
"Because you're hurt, and I was worried"
In the end, she ended up being nicer than he anticipated, she even told him about how Harry Potter brewed the same potion almost 4 years ago, and she was kind enough to keep an eye on it when he couldn’t. He also learned that she decided to come back as a ghost in order to haunt student Olive Hornby in revenge for her bullying, and he laughed at that with her because he would do the same. Sadly her haunting plans went too far and she ended up being obliged to remain at the castle.
You can't, not you, not again, not like this.
year were everything went downhill and there was nothing I could’ve done to help you except keep up with the act of hating you and everyone who wasn't a true pureblood, obviously blood traitors didn't count” Draco finished with a dry laugh and hugged himself, either trying to warm up a little or to comfort himself.
In the end, Narcissa got house arrest for 2 years, Lucius was sentenced to Azkaban for 4 years and Draco was on probation, thanks to McGonagall he got the chance to go back to finish his studies, the fact that one mistake was enough to put him on Azkaban was not said but definitely implied. So when the 31st of August came the feeling that maybe this year was going to be a good one was slightly disturbed by the fact that Draco was going to be there, and the mark of his forearm was a constant reminder of the hell everyone has been through.
- Now he had to carry some sort of candy or chocolate for Draco to eat otherwise he would get grumpy, which wasn't actually a con because the blond look adorable
The words didn't seem to make a lot of sense to the other boy.
“Do you ever get scared of your own thoughts?” was the first thing Draco said when he felt Harry come up the stairs.
Draco learned that cooking was a lot more alike to potions than he realized, and he loved learning from Ginny, she was so funny and loved to joke around, it reminded him of the twins which always made him laugh with all the pranks they pulled, but he was too proud to admit it back then, what a shame if only he could do things differently.
"Well, then you can leave guys, I have things to do, letters to write and meetings to attend, take a candy while you see yourself out," and so they ended up outside of the headmistress with candy in hand and a smile on their faces.
"I like your arse better without clothes," whispered Harry on his boyfriend's ear and kissed his cheek while handing him another outfit for him to try out
Chapter song: Borderline by Tove Styrke
By the time he arrived at the kitchens he had the perfect plan, he knew Draco was going to be at the Astronomy tower tonight, it was Friday and they always met up there on Friday’s. So he was going to give his the chocolate parfait and wait until he was finished (he figured that telling him in the middle of a bite and making the other boy choke was not the most romantic thing to do) he was going to confess. If the reaction was positive he was going to kiss the boy and if it wasn’t then he was going to throw himself out from the tower and die.
"That was amazing, so you're telling me they do that and get it ree-corded and I can watch it as many times as I want to?" Harry nodded and Draco smiled, "that's amazing, can we watch more at home?"
"That reminds me, I need to retrieve that thing you borrowed Draco, I'm sure it's in your room, am I right?"
"It's okay, I'll teach you again"
"I don't really know, I arrived when Theo was already there with Pansy and Draco, and then I heard him say something like 'how does it feel to be the chosen one's bitch, and if he screamed the same way with you like how he did with him' and I just lost it and punched him in the face"
4.- Pro - He had the worst case of sweet-tooth and that was adorable
"My amortentia has always smelled like treacle tart".
"Me neither, but I'm glad you let me be part of it," answered Harry while putting his arm around Draco. "Now about that package."
"Are you okay, love? You look a little bit pale," asked Harry when he noticed Draco's pace had slowed down.
“And I thought I’ve seen it all,” said Pansy while sitting next to Draco, her eyelashes were curled and he almost smiled at the thought of Hermione teaching her how to use a muggle artefact. Her hair was in the same haircut as always, but shorter than he had ever seen, it suits her.
I don't want you to die, I don't want to be alone, I do deserve to be alone.
"Why would you be alone?" a soft voice mumbled and Harry tried to see where it was from through his teary eyes, "why are you crying, did someone died?" How could he forget that voice, that beautiful voice that used to annoy him and now never fail to make him smile.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy, I would love to spend the rest of my life with you, but for now I would love to spend as much time as I can with you"
"Honestly, Hermione could do a better job explaining this, but basically inside of us there are cells that have DNA and the DNA has genes that when they express they give us certain characteristics such as eye colour or certain sickness," explained Harry while knotting his tie.
“What time is it?” Draco asked as he sleepily snuggled closer in Harry’s chest.
But not everything was about Harry, Draco also had his journey, ever since Theo was out of the picture the blond seemed a lot freer than before, his confidence grew and what once was arrogance was replaced with understanding and empathy. Draco was nothing like he used to be, it's almost as he had died and this was a brand new person. And whilst Harry found horrible that thought, it made a lot of sense, because people can't just change every single detail about them, what they can do is pretend to be what others expect to be and that was exactly what Draco had been doing all this past years.
Harry nodded and Draco lifted his shirt, there was a big scar across his chest, near his heart. It was full of hatred and misunderstandings. Harry's trembling hands traced the scar and a couple of tears hit his bare chest.
“Then you’ll have 30 seconds to explain to me why before I decide whether to punch you or him,” they both smile and stand up from the stairs, “good luck, bring back a little bit of douche confidence, being so anxious doesn’t suit you, leave that to Neville.”
or where Harry is sure that Draco's plan is more than just a brag.
“So don’t go, come with me, we don’t have to go to the Borrow if you don’t want to, we can just stay at Grimmauld’s and spend Christmas together”
And maybe Harry could hold onto that image for a little bit longer, what he didn’t know was if he was doing it to make the other boy happy or because it felt better than not understanding, but when he woke by awful screams a couple of hours later he realized that holding on an idea was a stupid thing to do and that he needs to get close to the boy before everything else became too much for the both of them.
“Well, that is your name, isn’t it?” Harry answered and they continue to walk in comfortable silence.
Draco felt like he greeted death like an old friend.
It was a fucking Dragon.
"Yes Pansy, I promise I'll help you search a dress for Blaise's mom wedding, geez it's like you don't trust me anymore," sighed Draco, apparently they need 10 minutes to say goodbye because they forget to talk about the important stuff at dinner.
"I know babe, I know," and they hugged again, that was until someone screamed that they wanted a glass of water.
He needed to practice his flying, it's been months since he has been on a broom and he wasn't going to let those Gryffindors win, he was still a Slytherin and cunning as hell. But maybe he needed to eat something first, either the dizziness was due to the lack of sleep or the lack of food, you make the choice. He should talk to someone about what was on his mind, someone who wouldn't judge him nor tell him what to do, just someone.
“There’s no such thing as freedom for people like me Harry, I screwed up by being on the bad side and now I gotta pay for my sins,” said the boy once he was sitting next to him.
"Well, mister independent, are you ready?" Draco nodded as he took Harry's hand, who apparated them on Grimmauld place. "And I present you the number 12 in Grimmauld place." Said Harry with a bow and the other boy just raised his eyebrow.
"Liar" Harry says as he takes the duvet and covers him. "You need help, everyone can see it, shit even Ron sees it and he's more oblivious than I am"
"Really funny Potter, I'm surprised you are going to be an Auror when you should be a comedian," said Draco as he exits the changing room with skinny jeans and a black t-shirt that read 'drama queen'.
"Well, don't stay all day on the floor, we are having guests at diner and I want you both in you best behaviour"
“You deserve better than you give yourself credit, but I know you won’t believe me no matter how many times I tell you,” Harry said as he stood up from the cold floor offering a hand to Draco to do the same. It took all self-control Harry had to not make a scene when he noticed a recent bruise in the form of a hand around the boy’s wrist, and after a deep breath he let himself say “you know you can talk to me, right?”
Harry still wasn't over the fact that Draco was his boyfriend, if someone had told him that this was going to happen he would've laughed so hard and maybe sent them to St. Mungos in case they had a tumour on their brains… wait, do wizards even know what a tumour is? Not really the point, but yeah, Harry couldn't help but fell in love a little bit more with the boy each day that passed.
As soon as he saw his two best friends his thoughts about Malfoy went away and he ran to hug them, even though they saw each other during the summer they ended up going to Australia for a couple of weeks to be with Hermione’s parents.
talk to snakes, and yeah, let’s not forget the fact that he’s been trying to get murdered every fucking second of his existence.
“Is there any chocolate cauldrons?” He asked after thinking it for a bit and Harry nodded handing him one, the blonde took it and, even though Harry knew he was trying to hide it, Malfoy’s hands were shaking too much to be passed as nervousness failing at opening the box. Harry took another box opening it and taking two before handing it to him.
But not everything was that bad, he was really enjoying his time here, so was Ron who was really excited to tell his mom about everything he saw and decided to bring her a lot of souvenirs that he and Hermione bought. And talking about her, she changed a lot her way of dressing, you could tell that she wasn't the teen who fought a war in jeans and a sweatshirt, rather she looked so classy and what Pansy called 'preppy style', whatever that was, it really suited her. Harry was glad his friends had a good time with Draco's, because he was going to marry that boy and he didn't want anyone to feel uncomfortable around each other.
"I don't think it's my place to explain all this professor," was the first thing Draco listed once he woke up
"Your family is really weird," said Draco while trying to eat the pizza without making a mess. It took a second for Harry to understand that Draco meant the Weasley's and his heart fluttered at it, because yes, they were his family.
"I'm afraid that if you find out what's going on with me you'll think I'm dirty and won't want me anymore, and I know it's not true, that you wouldn't do that but you have to understand that my anxiety is so bad that I can't think of a better scenario," explained Draco once the classroom was empty. "And I know that I'm not doing the right thing by not speaking up but I'm so scared, and I'm not ready to be seen with more pity than usual, I just miss being me."
"Well, I just love the way the
"A muggle way, you mean, I still can't believe you forget you're a wizard Harry" laughed the redhead and the black-haired sighed, of course, magic could've done that process easier. "And anyway, why aren't you spending Christmas with us this year? If it's because of Ginny well she already got Luna, and if it's because you're feeling guilty or something stupid like that, don't forget that we're your family."
"Oh Draco, of course, I'm not mad nor should I be mad, I'm just concerned because you're literally walking into the wolf's mouth," the blond laughed lightly and held Harry's hand.
"Well, you're a lot more useful than Ron who keeps eating the ingredients and than Hermione who gets crazy over the fact that cooking is more about feeling than measuring things," Ginny said while they sat at the kitchen table, he took his first bite and moan at how good it was.
"You dork," giggled the blond and grabbed Harry's cheek with his left hand, "I love you too, I love you more than you'll ever know, I never imagined this was what the future held for me, my whole life had been planned even before I was born and suddenly I got to make all these choices and all of them always led me back to you, so it's hard to regret my past when I'm not sure if you and I would've ever existed without it," Harry just stared at Draco, not knowing what to say but relating so much with the words.
"Yes," the other boy took it without hesitation and with that Harry knocked on the door.
“At least we are not rooming with the Death eater, can you imagine? I have doing protection charms” he overheard a Ravenclaw and his blood boiled immediately looking at Draco who looked hurt but tried to hide it but continue to talking with Zabini. Harry sighed, maybe they don’t have to get used to
"I never had something like that, the closest thing I had was those chocolates that my mother used to send me, but then with the war that stopped and so my good memories around my house"
“That’s what the cigarette was for” he answered lighting it off against the ground, “how did you found me?”
Where Harry and Draco get to make new holiday traditions
“Oh, sorry, a habit of mine,” Draco mumbled, he hated how common this was getting for him.
"Gins? What's that? Some kind of charms that I don't know of?" he asked with his head tilted to the side and Harry smiled
Draco wished it was as simple as that, because now that he was sitting of the big table he felt as if nothing had changed. The food was flavourless and each sip of water felt heavy on his stomach. He hate the look of lust Theo had, and how he smirked knowing that Draco couldn't do anything about it without facing the consequences of it. And that there was no one to help him, Draco was alone, more alone than never before.
When they arrived again to Andromenda's home, Harry left Draco for a second to go and put the child to sleep, and when he came back he saw the two family members hugging, and crying while doing so. What he would give for a photo of this moment, they said their goodbyes and flooded back to Hogsmeade, where they enjoyed a butterbeer.
Or where Harry regrets something from his past
"Fine, if the git can manage it then so can I, you and I have a date this weekend," Ron said with confidence and Ginny said she wanted one as well.
"Yeah, I saw when they brought him home, it's cute, I just hope he doesn't bark too much,"
Song Chapter: Under Pressure by Queen ft. David Bowie
Hermione loved studying with Draco, she says that the boy is brilliant, she loved learning new things the boy knew and she was actually surprised he was willing to spill ‘pureblood’ secrets with her, she started to learn that dark arts were so interesting and fascinating from a study point of few.
“I was wondering if you’ll come here tonight,” Harry said as he handed Draco a cup of cocoa.
"Well, it's time for class, let's go to Herbology Draco," said Harry while offering him a hand, which he gladly took because at this moment he doesn't trust his feet at all.
They stayed in silence for a little bit, the gree-eyed boy was giving the other boy all the time he might need to continue with his story, the stag still lightning the place.
“I mean, when aren´t you obsessing over Draco? Honestly, remember 6
"Not at all, just a small Narcissus on his left wrist," Harry smiled at the memory of Draco telling him about how much he loved his mom and how much he wished he could be more like her and less like his dad. And how after the tattoo Harry told him about how his mother saved his life on the forest and how sweetly Draco kissed him that day promising that the next tattoo would be a lily.
"Good night, love you," she mumbled and fell asleep almost instantly.
They finally arrive at the new potions classroom, Slughorn refused to be at the dungeons like Snape, if it wasn’t because of Dumbledore’s mission he would’ve never taken this stupid class, hell he didn’t even buy the book because he was sure Snape wasn’t going to allow him to take the class due his ‘Exceed Expectations’ at his OWL’s. Yet here he was, at this stupid class, with no book and not the slightest idea of what he was supposed to be doing.
"I love it, we can make an appointment today on our way to the mall."
“Not really, you just need to answer something first,” Draco started and when the other boy nodded he took a deep breath, “I need you to promise that you’ll be patient with me, you’ll never lie to me and you’re not going to waste your time with me, whenever you feel like this has no purpose you’ll break things up”
Draco never learned how to make friends, well not properly; he was an only child (maybe if he had a sibling a lot of things would’ve been different) and never learned how to share or how to
“Why do you do it?” was the first thing Harry asked when he saw Draco enter the room, it was past midnight and his other roommates were asleep. The only light was the one coming from the window, the same one Harry was facing, “you do know there’s more than following your parent's expectations, right? That you can be free if you really wanted to.”
Such a pretty yet deadly thing was that necklace, he can still sometimes feel his bones breaking, or his head feeling like it was about to explode, so much pressure in it he could swear he tasted blood on his mouth. He doesn’t remember much more than that, his mother only told him that he had an awful fever but his father smirked and said that maybe this time he would learn to not touch what wasn’t his.
And they were right, he needed to act as soon as possible, ignoring the fact that he feared that if he took too long Draco would realize how much of a mess he was and would decide that he was not worthy enough. But first, he needed to talk with his best friends, not that their opinion will change the way he feels, but after all, they always managed to shake some sense into him.
Harry found hilarious the reactions Draco had while watching Christmas movies, he loved the way the blond was getting comfortable around muggle objects and how he began to question them less and less. Midnight came faster than expected and it was time to exchange gifts. Because it doesn't matter what Christmas meant to the entire world, gifts were amazing.
"Well, it's always good to know how to be sneaky, am I right?" the girl never failed to amaze him, he couldn't understand how Harry let her go… well he did but still, she was a catch and Luna was so lucky to have her. "I am as lucky as she is, it's like fire and ice, together we make a cosy environment, you speak out loud sometimes," she laughed and offered him her hand.
"Sounds too complicated, I don't know how muggles manage to find such amazing stuff without magic," replied Draco while taking his toiletries, "sometimes I wonder what else I missed out because of my beliefs" he finished and headed to the bathroom where he took a quick shower, trying to ignore the dark mark.
“I just don’t get how you can still follow orders of someone who ruined your life, I sure as hell wouldn’t be following Dumbeldore’s orders after all that happened, no matter how wise he was, it is my life and now that I’m just myself I want to live it as
"I love you so much, you can't even imagine how much"
"Magnificent, you know I'm naturally pale, not all of us can have beautiful dark skin Blaise" he tried to joke and when his friend laugh he let out a sigh, lately all of his actions felt like an act.
Song Chapter: Say you won’t let go by James Arthur
"Well, when the King of Slytherin is served to you in a silver plate is hard to not take a bit, and when the Malfoy's hands you the heir in a red ribbon you don't say no," said Theo with a cocky attitude.
Draco expressed his concern about visiting his aunt the day before, saying that maybe she wasn’t going to be really pleased when he saw him due to the relationship with his family, but Harry assured him that it would be alright, he really wanted Draco to meet Teddy, after all, he was his uncle. So Draco insisted to bring a present, for Andromeda he bought a box of fancy chocolates and for Teddy they needed to go to a muggle store, taking advantage of said trip Harry was going to buy the costumes for he and Draco.
"We're fine, your mother is okay and the others were just burned slightly, it seems like you set fire to the manor as a self-defense mechanism; the Aurors want to ask some questions but they can wait if you're not feeling well yet."
The train ride was quicker than expected, and after promising Molly he would be there for Boxing day he started to look for Draco, who was in a corner talking with Pansy.
"Likewise Potter," answered Draco while shaking it.
“And you? What do you deserve Draco?” Harry interrupted the boy’s rant feeling slightly mad at the fact that he could relate to the other boy so much, and it hurt him deeply because it all made sense now. The reason behind he didn’t heal his wounds, or why he was always flinching at sudden contact or the panic attacks, everything made sense.
"Not to brag but, I used to do bigger messes at his age, obviously mine was with potions ingredients but choco powder works too," giggled Draco while sitting next to Teddy. "I like your hair, it reminds me of a bubble gum or if it was a bit lighter I would be craving candy floss," and with that said he did a cleaning charm to get rid of the mess.
“It’s okay, people are going to be shocked at first, but then again, people are always shocked at anything you do.”
“It was when I was at the manor, I was not scared, in the end, I knew that we were at war and that could happen. They fed us whenever they remembered and sometimes it got cold, but Draco always tried to sneak more food and some blankets, he got in trouble for that so many times, I still remember his screams and that makes me sad. But he always tried to smile to me, and chat with me sometimes, most of the time they forgot he existed, he always told us he was sorry for everything, and his eyes were so sad.”
"Go away Pansy, I already told you I'm okay,"
"Oh, you're so thoughtful Draco, I'm sure my boy here is a lucky man to have your hand," Theo's father said with a genuine smile and Draco almost felt bad for him, scratch that, he felt to bad for him and how he was just a piece on the chess game his father had in mind.
The blond didn't lose time as he managed to pull down Harry's pants along with his underwear, all their insecurities were left behind and all that was left was pure lust. Harry stopped abusing Draco's nipples and made his way down until he met the blond's underwear, which he quickly removed freeing Draco's hard cock. He kissed it lightly and Draco couldn't help but threw his head back, and his back arched as his hips thrust against Harry's mouth, which he took as an opportunity to take Draco's dick in his mouth sucking it slowly, it wasn't big enough for Harry to choke on it but he could feel it in the back of his throat, he felt his boyfriend squirm under him so he grabbed him by the hips holding him in place while he continued to suck.
Harry hugged Draco one last time and gave him a kiss, he headed to the shower and tried to calm himself down. Maybe he didn't ask a lot of questions because the answers he received instead of alleviating him, only created new unanswered questions and pained him at the same time. He had a lot of reasons why to kill Voldemort, there was never a doubt of that, but the fact that he continued to find reasons to do it makes him wish he was still alive so he could kill him all over again and again, just so Voldemort could feel at least a little bit of all the pain he had created.
Or where Harry promises the world to Draco and plans on giving it to him
He could feel the hate, but it felt different, as it felt when his father first exited Azkaban. His magic was unstable and that was something to worry about, the last time it was like this the hexes left severe damage and he didn't want to imagine the damages of any unforgivable. This lasted only for a few minutes, but they were enough for Draco to wish he didn't come in the first place, he had already sent a letter to his mother and he should have been more certain his father was back where he belong.
“I mean, I can try, after all, I managed to make Crabbe and Goyle be decent at his classes, Harry shouldn’t be a problem,” said Malfoy, clearly feeling pain from saying the name of his deceased friends but trying to hide it.
"Shouldn't you be asleep?" Harry asked their daughter while he gave her the glass of water and Lily just giggled.
"I want to get a tattoo, I've been thinking a lot and I hate this mark, its worse than any scar I have and I want to cover it with something
“How many galleons do you think we can make if we take a photo?” said a voice before he heard another ‘click’ that makes him open his eyes.
"No, I want them to be free and happy, if not there's always mind-healers we can send them to," Harry laughed and Draco punched his arm lightly. "I'm kidding love, I promise you that our kids are going to be amazing, brave and cunning"
"A big day? Since when going to The Burrow is a big day? We've been doing it since we were 18 Potter," Draco complained, it wasn't a big deal.
"I hope you don't plan on murdering me," was the first thing Draco said once he met Harry at the front of the house
But Harry has also learned that Draco was depressed, that Draco feels so guilty for everything that happened that he constantly tries to overcompensate it not caring if he hurts himself in the process. He has also learned that Draco now likes to make himself look smaller in the hallways, and how little he eats during meals. He hates how bony his body has become and his heart aches at the way he can touch his index with his thumb around Draco's wrist. He hates how Draco put to sleep that fire hi used to have, and he sometimes wonders if he ever had a fire at all. And he just learned that Draco Malfoy cuts himself, adding scars to his body in order to try to hear, the wounds in his mind.
"But you're special Harry, you've always been special"
"Well, I bet Andromeda is not going to let you go now that she knows you, and Teddy seemed to like you a lot" Harry smiled at him and noticed how the grey-eyed boy cheeks were red from the cold, so the took off his jumper and handed it to him.
They ate while chatting about the movie, and how they hated the ending. It was already dark outside when they left the building so Harry decided to apparate them instead of taking another cab back home. They both sat on the couch and started the first episode of British Bake Off, Draco was mesmerized by all the pretty desserts and Harry was just hungry, so he got up to make something easy for diner.
