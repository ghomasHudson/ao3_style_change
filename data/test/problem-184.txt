It wasn’t entirely surprising, but he felt like he’d let down his team somehow. They hadn’t gotten much out of Lockwood, there were still Celtic Serpents out there and the crisis was far from over, the Minister was pulling his metaphorical hair out at the prospect of trying to hide this from the media, who seemed dead set on finding out what was going on within the Ministry, especially after being on lockdown.
The other man, all muscles and taut skin had sent his brain into a frenzy. That and the fact Potter was half hard. Draco groaned inwardly. He’d remembered running out of the bathroom so quickly he slid on the tiles and ended up on his arse. Harry doubled over with laughter.
“I-I” Harry started, he had a million and one things to tell the other man, his thoughts were whirling around his head like a hurricane, his heart hammering in his chest. He wanted to tell Draco he loved him, he wanted to tell him everything he loved about him, how he wasn’t sure how he’d live life without him, but the words were caught in his throat.
Harry knew it was ridiculous, selfish and unfair but he wasn’t sure how much longer he could take sitting in this ruddy chair. His mind flashed back to the conversation he’d had with the Minister before he’d left to come to the hospital. The Minister had put him on leave, stating he needed time to recover.
Till we’re together again, laying entwined upon our bed and watching the gently undulating constellations of our painted galaxy of stars, I love you.
Potter merely shrugged his shoulders, mimicking Draco’s movements and taking a sip of his own drink. “Of all the people in the world I never would’ve expected
"Hmm, this one." Harry mumbled, tapping his finger on the notebook. Draco looked down and briefly read the description. 'Sandy blonde hair, about five foot three, petite, wears ridiculously annoying high heels. Heard her talking to someone who addressed her as Mandy.'
“Why does my life always have to be such complete and utter shite?” Draco moaned, running a hand through his slightly damp hair. Upon pulling his hand back, he rubbed his fingers together, noting that dried blood had transferred onto his fingers.
“Can I get your number?” asked Louisa, looking up at Weasley with a hopeful expression on her face. It really baffled Draco, Louisa’s ex boyfriend Damien was what he described many times as heinously attractive, so much so it should be actually illegal. The man was well kept, had a good job and all round a decent bloke, but she’d dumped him claiming he wanted something far too serious. Louisa had known Weasley for all of five minutes and he’d never seen her
Hermione looked thoughtful, before nodding her head and gesturing towards a small office room to the left of them. Once inside, he caught her in the corner of his eye motioning outside. Sighing, he placed the parchment and photograph down on the table before him and turned around, inwardly groaning at the sight of Unspeakable Wilson.
“Fuck!” Harry shouted, stalking out his bedroom and towards the offending coffee table, he kicked the leg and picked the wand up, holstering it. “Fucking stupid thing” he groaned, turning around to face Draco, who’d followed behind him. Draco sighed and apparated.
The question caught Draco off guard somewhat, he knew it was coming - after all, Pureblood muggle hating Malfoy couldn’t possibly befriend a muggle, right? But at the same time he wondered if Potter dared ask. “I met Louisa at a group therapy session.” he said, looking down at his own drink. Draco had never really thought about it before, he had no prejudice during group therapy, by then he’d already decided that he was utterly wrong about the world. Their meeting was by chance and possibly one of the most important things to ever happen to him, in his own opinion of course.
Seamus shook his head and sighed. “No, but I don’t think they expected us to be here this time, we could check out the cabin.” Harry frowned and thought for a moment, before shaking his head. “Ward the area and shut it down, we need to see if there’s any curses active here before we go poking about.” Seamus nodded and stood up.
“Luna, where have you been lately?” Potter asked, one eyebrow raised. Draco put his elbow on the table, most un-Malfoy-like, placing his chin on the palm of his hand. He listened intently as the conversation flowed between the friends, he felt most out of place.
“Yeah, like a toilet,” Draco argued. “That would be a toilet, which is T,” Potter grinned “Try again.”
“Well see you next time Harry, don’t be a stranger.” he winked, before making his way off down the stairs. Harry closed the door behind him and padded over to the coffee table, dishing out the many containers, tossing the prawn crackers down wherever. Neither him nor Draco liked them, but they came free every time they ordered. “Mm, so hungry.” Harry moaned. He accio’d a couple forks and passed one to Draco.
Harry let out a sigh and shook his head, tracing the rim of his cup with his fingertip. “No, but - well I don’t know what else to do,” he admitted, scrunching his face up. “I didn’t join up with the Aurors, I haven’t a clue how to actually investigate.”
His mind wandered back to Potter as he passed through the London streets, he was looking forward to seeing his apartment again, especially his cat. As Draco pulled up outside his flat, his eyes settled on the jet black hair of Harry Potter.
And while we’re on the subject of food, Draco: I reckon that my mother-in-law brought you cookies because she’s precisely the same tricky Slytherin that you are. Where they those toffee and banana ones from the Elf bakery on Diagon Alley? With the ginger icing? They bloody
After Harry retold everything that Kingsley had told him, as well as the fact they had a mole within the department, Seamus’ entire demeanour changed. He looked outraged, unfortunately in his group of friends loyalty was everything. After all, they’d never have gotten through the war without it. They held loyalty and bravery in high regard and rightly so. Dean didn’t utter so much as a word as Harry and Seamus discussed the mole, eventually he straightened up and looked over to Draco, who appeared lost in thought.
Harry let out a breath he didn’t realise he was holding and they all exited the office together. Once outside, Hermione placed a gentle hand on Draco’s bicep and smiled. “This is good, Draco, it’s helpful.” he wasn’t sure why she felt the need for reassurance, but all Draco could think about was a good firewhiskey and his favourite dolphin program.
Draco groaned, pulling his knees up to his chest. To be perfectly honest he’d always been shit at eye spy but he had absolutely no idea what else to suggest, truth or dare seemed a little juvenile, or rather he didn’t really want to be spilling his secret to Harry bloody Potter.
Once Harry had fully dressed, he entered the living room and gave Draco a sheepish smile. “We match.” he said, mimicking Draco’s earlier thoughts.
Louisa made a tutting noise and nodded. “Alright,” she bit her lip and closed the glove box. “Well do you know where he lives?”
“Do we have any idea who they are?” asked Dean, who had been uncharacteristically quiet. Harry shook his head and let out a groan. Sitting back down on the armchair, he was hunched forwards, brow furrowed. After a few minutes, his eyes rose to meet Kingsley’s. “Well, I better fill you in on what we just encountered.
“Oh well,” he laughed. Lockwood leant forwards, licking his lips again. Hermione felt deeply uncomfortable, she turned her head towards Wilson who was the epitome of cool and impassive, she couldn’t help but feel impressed by her colleague. “Yes, I suppose I am.” he finally said, he eyed up Hermione - she felt suddenly sick, as though he was eyeing her for his next meal. Lavender had written the exact same thing in her report of their capture. It was an accurate description of this man.
Harry wandered over to the drawers nearest the door and opened the top one, pulling out a pair of boxers. Draco turned fully towards him, hand on his hip - he tried his best to compose himself. “When did you move into my room?” he asked boldly.
"Well, if you're not busy, maybe you want to help?" he offered hopefully, a small smile gracing his lips as he read Draco's extensive notes; they were very well detailed descriptions of random strangers he'd come across. "Can I read this?"
Draco frowned, reaching into his bag which sat on the floor next to him he pulled out a quill and ink setting it down on the table. “Yes.” he said simply, as he began to fill in the puzzle of the day.
“Yes.” he replied simply. Tsking, Unspeakable Wilson nodded her head. “I hope that will not cloud your judgement, Auror Malfoy.” Draco snorted, shaking his head. The statement had caught him a little off guard. The majority of the Ministry knew his disdain for his father, however he wasn’t sure how far that knowledge stretched.
Dean nodded in agreement, he’d cast several charms on Draco and then finally finished with stasis. He stood up quickly, pointing his wand to the man in gold piping. The man lowered his hood, a cruel smirk on his face. Auror Lockwood.
"What about it?" Draco frowned, not sure he really got the connection. "She's his partner I think, she usually turns up about thirty minutes after he's left, then after about two minutes inside she comes outside and apparates away."
“I haven’t seen any of this stuff before.” Draco admitted, gripping Harry’s hand a little tighter. Harry nodded. “It all looks very… Expensive?” he shrugged. Draco nodded too, biting his lip. They spent about thirty minutes scanning all the various objects around the room. It seemed to be family heirlooms mainly, he wondered why his mother had never mentioned it.
“No I mean, is that the answer?” he chuckled. Draco’s frown deepened, he then let out a snort. “Oh, no, sorry.” he said, a blush staining his cheeks. Harry watched him for a few moments, something unreadable on his face, before smiling softly. “Dominos?”
Draco, who was taken aback at the request for help from Potter of all people, handed his notebook over, a frown on his face. He'd read about him in the Prophet when someone had left their newspaper on his table, he knew that Harry hadn't done what was expected of him - he always thought he would be chasing after dark wizards forever, but no.
“Oh, what else then?” Draco challenged, turning round to face the other man. His eyes sparkled, a smirk on his face as he waited for Harry’s response. Harry could feel a blush rising on his face, he ducked down and shook his head. “Nevermind” he mumbled, quietly making his way to the sofa and plonking down onto it, spilling his tea a little on his lap as he did so.
When he’d received it he rather liked it, it was full of pictures of himself, Louisa, Bethany and even some of Meowth. Louisa had decided they needed a weekend away, she’d rented a caravan in Butlins, which was of course a bit too tacky for Draco’s taste he found he rather enjoyed himself.
Potter let out a noise of approval and nodded his head. “That’s cool, I obviously joined the Montrose Magpies,” he said, looking down at the dessert menu. Draco stole a quick glance in Potter’s direction, it seemed he was as uncomfortable as Draco which offered some comfort at least. “I was with the Cannons for a couple months before that, though.”
“Mm, no. I’m err..” Harry frowned at the kettle and then turned to Draco giving him a sheepish smile. “I don’t know what I’m doing, I’m absolutely knackered.” he sighed “I’m not sleeping well, nightmares again.”
“Aha!” Draco exclaimed, pulling out a heavy file. He dumped it on his desk and began leaving through the contents. Harry turned his head on its side and frowned. “What?” he asked again, this time he walked up behind Draco and peered over his shoulder. It was a little difficult as the other man was a little taller than him, but not so hard since he was hunching over a little.
“Knockturn,” Draco grimaced, the thought of going down that alleyway again filled him with dread, however, he quickly regained his composure and shrugged a shoulder. “They can’t be very good criminals if they operate in plain sight, Knockturn is mostly watched closely these days,” Draco said, thinking back to his own dealings with Knockturn, his father even.
The seventh time it happened was more unusual than the rest. Potter’s friends appeared to be waiting for the two of them in Hogsmeade - Draco had absolutely no idea how to feel about it. Once they’d reached the group, they greeted Draco as though they’d been friends for years.
“Oh, it’s only been six minutes and Potter has spotted the snitch.” Draco mused, pointing up at the man who took one of the most daring and impressive dives Draco had ever seen, his black and white Quidditch robes billowing in the wind. It was amusing now to think he believed his own self better than Potter, he wasn’t a bad seeker but he was a much better beater. This man was all strong muscles and fantastic skill, Draco found himself envying too many people these days.
“Well, I thought about it but Ron got offered a place with the Magpies, they already had a seeker but a few months after I joined the Cannons their seeker retired, so here I am.” he said, shrugging his shoulders. Draco chewed his lower lip in thought, before nodding. “Okay.”
Harry let out a quiet chuckle. “You talk to Hermione,” he pointed out, though Draco couldn’t help but detect Potter sounded pleased to be the only person Draco did in fact speak to.
Just as Draco was about to ask the burning question, a loud bang jolted him out of his musings and he heard distant shouting and the clanking of boxes outside the room. Draco held his breath and closed his eyes, hoping it was someone coming to rescue them rather than the grisly murder he anticipated.
It was their first day off work and Merlin knows Harry needed it. He lay sprawled out on the sofa in their living room flicking through the various different channels on the television. A forgotten cup of tea lay on the coffee table in front of him, his right arm hanging off the edge. He’d settled on a program about superheroes, Harry often wondered why muggles made such programs - some of the powers were so close to spells he knew, he wondered if it was breaking the Statute of Secrecy, but then again if the directors were actual muggles it wouldn’t make a difference.
Pulling out an iPod from his suit jacket, Draco pushed the headphones into the socket and placed them in each of his ears, scrolling through his extensive list of music - at one time people would have thought it strange, a Malfoy using muggle technology, but Draco didn't really care what people thought these days, he wasn't even sure he cared about what he thought himself really.
” she exclaimed, pointing through Draco’s black tinted windows at the man standing beside the black Bentley. Draco turned his head, he rolled his eyes. “Well, it seems we didn’t need the tickets to see Potter.” Louisa shot a sideways glance at Draco, a scowl on her face.
Harry swallowed, wiping his cheeks with the back of his hand. He sat down on the linoleum floor, his back to the wall. He brought his knees up to his chest and took a deep breath. All he could do now was wait, if Kingsley summoned him back to the Ministry he’d tell him under no uncertain terms to fuck right off.
“Nothing.” he said between food, earning a grimace from Draco, who promptly scolded him for his terrible table manners. Something he did frequently. Draco hummed and began eating.
“We’ve so far found the marks in a murder victims house, burnt to the wall,” he slid the parchment over detailing the field report when they’d discovered the victims corpse, as well as a detailed report of the Celtic Serpent burnt in to the wall. “A warehouse, holding maximum strength veratiserum, the mark was on the bottles - area clear of any traces.” he slid the parchment over for that too. Hermione's eyes were scanning the first piece, though he noted she re-read one part of the report. Harry had read that same report many times, to know she was reading the part about the scorch marks still being as hot as fiendfyre when they arrived. So hot, it burnt Endelton's fingertips when he’d tried to touch it. Something Harry berated him about for days, it wasn’t good practice to touch something before you knew whether it was cursed.
Harry had wandered a little further than he’d previously intended but he was convinced he’d seen the dark figure of someone running through the forest. He heard a rustle behind him and turned around swiftly, his eyes settling on Seamus who looked at him sheepishly. “Sorry I didn’t know where I was going, everything looks the bloody same.” he whispered, Harry nodded in agreement and motioned to the north. Seamus nodded too. “Have you seen Draco?” Harry whispered back, scanning the area. “No, not yet mate.” he whispered back.
“Thank you, I’m going to get back to the Ministry and see if I can find anything myself. Please alert me if anything happens.” Harry stood up and brushed off his robes, offering a small smile towards Jenkins and Williamson before apparating with a pop.
Lavender shook her head. “No Sir, the interview was a bust.” Harry nodded. “First warehouse, I’ll apparate in from the East, Seamus if you go for the West ask Dean to do the North, Lavender you go South,” The two of them nodded in agreement.
Draco’s eyes moved back to Louisa, noting she was blushing, a frown appearing on his face. “Hm,” he mumbled, from the corner of his eye he noticed a flash of red hair, he groaned loudly. “You didn’t.” he sighed, running a hand through his hair.
“Have you seen this one?” Draco asked, trying to make conversation. Draco was a serial talker, he would talk through any movie whether he’d seen it or not, often asking the other person what happens next or making up wild theories in his head then expressing them in vivid detail. Bethany had said it was the most annoying thing she’d ever seen in her life, and she had to put up with periods. Draco had cringed at that.
Draco sat down on the sofa, crossing his feet and watched Potter with interest. It was almost as though the man was absorbing everything that was
A loud bang from ahead startled Harry, he crouched down behind a bush, eyes darting around to seek out the source of the noise, to the left of him he saw a figure moving, he could barely make out the form of Lavender, who also appeared to be scanning the area.
“I can imagine so.” replied Jean, shaking her head. “They’re very close.” Lavender nodded, frowning. “I’m about to go to the hospital, do you want to come with me?” Jean let out a sigh and shook her head. “I want to, but I can’t,” she turned her head towards Endelton, who stood by the end of the corridor, shifting his feet around. He looked uncomfortable and out of place. “Got to take care of Endelton, he’s shit at situations like this.” Lavender snorted, nodding her head.
“Get someone in here to.. Collect.. Fucking hell.” he shook his head, disbelief. He’d never witnessed something so gruesome in his life. Bile rose up his throat, he grabbed a hold of Draco’s hand and pulled him out into the street, gasping as the cool air hit him. Seamus looked surprised, but nodded in acknowledgement. Harry had seen some horrors in his life, but if this affected him so greatly, Seamus could only but sympathise.
Harry watched him intently, they’d been this close together before - but it had never felt like this before. He could see all of the flecks in Draco’s eyes, all of the marks and blemishes on his face, he smiled.
“More of you here, more to maim it seems.” Lockwood laughed maniacally, Draco winced at the tone. The only other time he’d heard that sick laugh was from the Dark Lord himself. Lockwood was clearly off his rocker. “I can’t wait to see how you bleed.” Lockwood smirked, staring at Harry as though he was the most delicious meal. “I didn’t realise you were that way inclined, Lockwood.” Harry retorted, rolling his eyes. This only seemed to anger the man further, he began walking slowly towards Harry - the glint in his eye unsettled Dean who moved to clutch Seamus’ hand.
“Potter,” he greeted, a defeated tone in his voice. Louisa smiled brightly at Potter. “Hello! How are you this morning?” she asked. Draco knew this was delaying tactics, obviously the heathenous woman wanted to spend time with Weasley today, which meant Draco was stuck with an exceptionally shaggable looking Harry Potter.
Clearing his throat, Draco turned his attention to Potter and sighed. “I work in a Dentist’s office.” he watched Potter for a few moments, trying to gauge his reaction. The man was shocked, surely. “A Dentist?” Potter asked, raising an eyebrow.
I have some great news actually, I secured the contract with St. Mungo’s on the Wolfsbane Potion, so we’re going to be supplying them with the majority of their Wolfsbane supply. Obviously Theo is extremely happy about this, it means Daphne will stop whining at him about wasting his time with something that won’t pay him enough galleons. Honestly, she wasn’t this exhausting and ghastly at school.
“A little while ago, the Healers won’t tell me much.” she sighed. Harry nodded in agreement, shaking his head. “They told me he’s stable, but that’s about it. They won’t tell me anymore than that - I’m not
These days, Draco preferred the company of himself - he tried to avoid social interaction as much as he could. Often, he’d receive letters from his mother that he failed to reply to each the same as the last, his mother reminding him to eat and talk to people.
Harry’s head snapped towards Draco as Auror Lockwood went down, he was both extremely proud of his partner and horribly worried. Dean and Seamus immediately began gaining on the wizard in front of them, Harry turned around and held his wand up to the three in the back who had begun backing up. “You get the left, I’ll get the right.” Harry ordered quickly, jogging towards the perp on the right.
“What does the snitch do?” Louisa asked, clapping her hands at every quaffle that entered the goal. Louisa enjoyed football, often Draco would find himself in a Wetherspoons watching a match with Louisa over a gin and tonic, it wasn’t unusual the woman would enjoy wizarding sports too.
“Yeah?” he asked, but he really wasn’t paying attention - looking down at Draco’s lips they were perfect, it hadn’t been the first time Harry thought about kissing Draco, but he’d never come this close to actually
"Well, when you said you didn't have anything else to do, as it happens I don't really have anything to do either, so I sit in Diagon Alley and watch people," he made it sound utterly normal, which earned a chuckle from Harry. "What?"
I can see the smile curling at the side of your thin, pink lips and the sparkle in your grey eyes as you fib, oh-so-blatantly, about that spoilt old Crup of yours. A sausage? Change that sentence to ‘chicken breast’ and I think I might actually believe you. I can hear your posh, fancy vowels spilling out onto the page too. It makes me want to seize hold of you and kiss you until all the only sounds you’re capable of making are those small, breathy moans that show you’re quite at my mercy. A month apart is far,
Kingsley and Harry scoured the entire Ministry. The front of the building had a ward sealed around the door that shimmered in the light. Five Aurors were guarding the front door, and one Auror at every exit. Harry frowned, running a hand through his hair. They’d looked everywhere, Harry had attempted to use his watch to find Endelton’s location but to no avail. He was running out of time and he could feel panic rising. “Do we know who wrote the note?” Kingsley asked, turning his head towards Harry. They were standing in the middle of the entrance, Harry looked up at the giant silver chandelier above, closing his eyes briefly. “The only ones that know of the box's existence are the Unspeakables, Dean and Seamus and Draco.” he sighed.
When Harry entered the Ministry of Magic the next day, he had an overwhelming sense of anxiety bubbling in the pit of his stomach. Not only had they found Celtic Serpent evidence in Lucius Malfoy’s private vault, they also had the Deathly Hallows element to contest with. It was times like these that Harry wondered why he became an Auror. Although he was a damn good Auror, he often wondered to himself why he’d decided to dedicate his entire life from start to finish fighting dark wizards. It was a constant sense of irritation to him. The loss of his best friend on his team saddened him greatly, although he had Draco he couldn’t kick the feeling he was missing someone when he entered the Ministry.
“Ugh, I’m sorry. I wish we had more on this fucking case.” he cursed, shaking his head in dismay. He really thought they were getting somewhere with it, yesterday they’d gone back out to the crop circle area. They’d received Dean and Seamus’ report a couple of days ago in regards to the cabin. No spell traces were found and the cabin itself was clean, though they’d found traces that their wards had been tampered with.
“Me? No, er.. No,” Potter stammered, a blush rising up his neck. “I err-” Potter looked down at his hands again, making circular motions against the table with his index finger. Draco laughed, startling the dark haired wizard.
Rolling his eyes, Harry shook his head and began to tuck in to his pizza, savouring the flavour in his mouth. “Mmm.” he moaned. Draco narrowed his eyes and picked up the pot of garlic dip, ripping the tab off it and plunging the crust of his now eaten slice into the dip.
Draco’s cheeks pinked as he recalled the day he walked into the bathroom whilst Harry was showering. He’d needed the toilet badly, after running down the street for two of Harry’s favourite Scotch Pies from the corner shop, he’d entered the flat so quickly, thrown the pies on the counter and ran straight to the toilet.
“Yes.” agreed Draco. He stood up, straightening out his robes. “Why are we wearing suits, we’re only going to Gringotts.” Harry sighed, running a hand through his messy damp hair. Draco shrugged his shoulders. “I always do, we could always go somewhere after to put them to good use.” he winked.
After scrolling through various different channels, Draco rested on another documentary, this one about Polar Bears. As it happened it was very interesting. Draco’s eyes widened as he learnt the Polar Bears natural habitat was melting. Harry could see the tears forming in the blond’s eyes when they explained a lot of the bears were dying as they didn’t find enough to eat before they went into their long hibernation. It never failed to amuse Harry, other people expected Draco to be this cold and callous Slytherin, with no compassion and no love.
The Healer before her spluttered, nodding his head quickly. “I’m sorry Unspeakable, yes, I’ll get you that information right now.” he rambled quickly. Hermione heard the squeak of Harry’s boots again, narrowing her eyes to his direction. “You’re brilliant.” he whispered, suddenly appearing at her side. The Healer returned with Draco’s charts, gesturing for the two of them to enter the department. “You do realise the man waiting outside is Harry Potter, right?” Hermione then added, giving the Healer in charge a withering look. The Healer cleared his throat, gave Harry a look and looked down at the chart in his hands.
Draco had bought quite a nice flat in London and decided since he couldn’t apparate, floo or fly he’d learn to drive. Currently driving down the A1 towards Edinburgh in his Mercedes, sat beside him his best friend. He often commented on the luxury some muggles tend to live in. Draco had done a lot of soul searching in his painful two years without magic, realising his utter mistake.
Draco’s scowl deepened, he really didn’t want to think about Ron Weasley pounding his best friend. That was an image that he really didn’t need. “Lovely,” he drawled. Acutely aware he wouldn’t be getting to sleep anytime soon, Draco let out a sigh. “Do you want to play eye spy?” he asked, causing Potter to erupt into laughter. The man seemed to be fit to burst at any minute, it made Draco wonder what the bloody hell was wrong with him.
“Yup, never defiled.” Harry said, sitting down on the arm of the sofa. Draco always enjoyed coming to Harry and Luna’s apartment, it was light and airy with potted plants everywhere, wild tie dye wall hangings and curtains that hung to the bottom of the floor length windows.
Advancing quickly, Harry quickly cast an anti-apparation barrier around the warehouse and entered the side door, inside the warehouse was pitch black, he squinted waiting for his eyes to adjust to the new lighting.
Harry turned around and laughed. “When I spent every night in here instead of my own room.” he said, walking back over towards the bed. Draco cringed, his eyes resting on the still open drawer. He wandered over and closed the drawer, but didn’t reply. He left the room so Harry could get changed and sat on the arm of the sofa, waiting.
Draco looked towards his book, he felt his cheeks warm and tilted his head a little, his fringe covering his face. “Oh, well,” he stuttered, finally he looked up at Potter, who was waiting patiently for a response, he realised Potter had caught on to his discomfort, the other man’s blazing green eyes widening. “It’s..”
Harry had used colourful yarn to connect different pieces on the cork board, he smiled at the memory of them watching Law and Order together. He’d probably gotten the idea from there, Draco had mentioned whilst they were watching it they should use that on their cases and the next day the cork board sat proudly at the side of their spacious office.
I’m going to go to St. Mungo’s before I send you this letter, I know you’ll be sick with worry if I just send this without knowing.
Harry frowned, turning his attention to the Healer. “I can assure you, we have examined Mr. Malfoy thoroughly - what he’s suffering from is a curse that has affected his nerve endings.” the Healer held his hand out for the chart, which Hermione handed back reluctantly. “He was hit by a Stupefy, I can confirm,” the man started, laying the chart down on the ledge beside him. “But he was definitely hit by something else afterwards, which has resulted in the curse damage, you said he was coherent after he hit his head, yes?”
“Hi Malfoy, out here on your own?” asked a chilly looking Potter, he rubbed his bare hands together and sat down on the seat next to him. Shifting a little closer, Potter looked up at the sky, as if he was trying to figure out what it was Draco was watching.
“They found the pumpkin thief.” he said shaking his head in disbelief. Harry raised an eyebrow and smiled. “Who was it?”
Though why should he? Draco idly wondered if he would ever get over his incessant obsessing over the boy hero. Even before Draco had turned eleven he’d heard all about Harry Potter, by the time he’d gotten to Hogwarts he saw this boy as some sort of saviour, not of the Wizarding World, but of Draco. The rejection cut him deeper than he’d like to admit, but throughout the incessant bullying and taunting, deep down Draco just wanted the idiot to notice him.
“I bet you 10 galleons 8 months ago that I’d hit someone in the dick with a Stupefy. You owe me 10 galleons now Deano.” he put his hands on his hips, looking proudly at his boyfriend. “You idiot, your money is my money.” Dean rolled his eyes again.
All of the Celtic Serpents they’d met up until now had been clad in full black. If this one had gold piping he needed to make an effort to capture him. With one team member down and the other tending to him, Seamus had no idea how he’d take four Celtic Serpents down, let alone capture this one. He exhaled, they finally got through his Protego.
“Lockwood, you fucking traitor!” Seamus growled. Dean moved closer to Seamus and whispered “There’s an anti apparition charm all around this area, I tried to side-along Draco, but it didn’t work.” he kept his eyes on Lockwood at all times. Seamus idly wondered if the cloaked person casting in the back had set up the anti apparition charm. He cursed under his breath.
the words though. I think, while you’re taking those potions, and doing something that is really brave for our family, you probably need to hear them.
Draco sat on the edge of the couch studying his fingernails as he waited for Harry, of course he could just go to work without him and he’d probably be on time every day but he always waited for him regardless. The first time he’d done it, Harry asked why he waited for him - to this day he still hasn’t answered that question and after maybe the tenth time Harry asked him, he just gave up asking. There were a lot of things they did for each other that to the outside world looked odd, but neither man really cared what the outside world thought. Smoothing down invisible lines from his Auror robes, Draco sighed. Today, Harry seemed to be taking the most amount of time a person could possibly take.
Finally, Lavender reached them looking a little worse for wear, she let out a cough - Harry’s eyes scanned the area, he stood up quickly when he realised more Celtic Serpents were behind them. “Shit.” he cursed, shaking his head. Only one of them incapacitated, Harry could see at least three behind. Lavender gestured her hand dismissively, already guessing what Harry would ask.
Watching as the other man walked to his bedroom, Harry sighed and wandlessly cleared up the mess, he wandered to his open bedroom door and turned his head towards Draco’s room. “Night Draco.” he whispered to thin air.
“Yes?” Draco sighed, he chewed the inside of his mouth - he wondered once again why Potter had decided to talk to him, none of the other students did. Most people moved away from him when they saw him, or he’d hear their hushed tones behind his back.
but I find my emotions going through a rapid cycle of terror, that nervous sickness in the pit of my stomach and pure longing. I’m ecstatic the case is nearing its end, I spoke with Hermione yesterday, she’s on edge too. It must be harder for her, not knowing if her husband will return or not, especially when they have Rose. Although I am glad your letters aren’t ninety percent about food, did you know Ronald actually sent poor Hermione a letter about his favourite dinner? The audacity of that man, please give him a good scolding from me.
Curious, he followed him loosely behind, a frown beginning to form - what the hell was Potter up to? Harry, who seemed to have a piece of parchment in his hands, looked up and down, up and down again and began to move with ease, disappearing down a narrow alleyway, which Draco knew led to the back of Slug & Jiggers. 'Odd,' he thought. Knowing he couldn't follow him down that alleyway, Draco retreated back down the cobbled street.
Draco frowned and nodded, he had his fair share of nightmares, mostly to do with Voldemort or the War itself, but they still haunted him. He was sure they always would. Though he’d heard everything there was to know about Harry’s perspective, he would’ve thought Harry’s nightmares would be worse. When they were in Auror training Harry’s nightmares were so bad he had to lay next to him just to stop him from thrashing about. Draco thought about it for a moment, Harry was more important than his pride. He conceded.
. “This is nice,” Potter said, looking up at it. Draco began to explain he’d called one tacky when he’d visited Louisa’s sister, Bethany’s house and so for his birthday last year Louisa and Bethany took it upon themselves to make one for him.
Harry, oh Harry, I just received word from the Healers, I’m so sorry for my awful handwriting, I was writing to you and when I heard the peck at the window I bolted, I thought it was another letter from you, or worse. This is driving me absolutely
On another note. I arranged an appointment with the decorator that did the Grimmauld Library, he’s going to decorate our bedroom. Do you have any colour suggestions I can disregard? Kidding, of course. I was thinking of a nice pale blue, almost pastel. Light and breezy is all the rage these days.
He remembered how he had watched with tired eyes as the boy he had fought with for seven years saved him from the horrors of Azkaban.
The former Slytherin forced a tight smile onto his lips, the thought of his mother the only thing keeping Draco from throwing a wandless hex in the dark-haired man’s direction. “Of course,” the blonde forced out through gritted teeth as he finally met Potter’s green gaze. “Lead the way,
Draco found himself intensely fascinated by a piece of chipped paint on the wall just behind Dr. Caudwell’s head, lips pressed together into a thin line.
While Lucius had no choice but to face prison, his sentence had been lightened handsomely due in part to Potter’s moving statement and in part to the Malfoy’s eagerness to collaborate with the Aurors in pursuing the case against all former Death Eaters. Others were not nearly as lucky as the Malfoys were; many were found mysteriously dead in what the Prophet could only dub as honor suicides--though Draco was sure they were anything but that. Others were sentenced to Azkaban for life. The remaining ex-followers of Voldemort’s cult had gone missing. Ridiculed and shamed, never to be seen again.
The woman--Dr. Caudwell was her name--was an allied professional within the muggle field of psychology, and while her primary line of work focused on the non-magical population of London, she was also a squib. Squibs, while generally excluded from much of the magical world, were still almost painfully aware of the current events plaguing wizardkind.
than I was last time.” The reluctance mixing with irritation pricking Draco’s voice wasn't lost on the poor woman--who could only hold back a sigh in response.
, I happen to work here.” Draco managed to grind out through gritted teeth, shoulders squared and jaw clenched in a desperate attempt at masking the sudden fright the other had given him. “I’m sure it might be too much for your
Draco Malfoy, had nearly jumped out of his skin due to an unsuspecting phone-call going off somewhere down the pavement.
The Wizengamot was not entirely sure of Draco’s threat level. He had been, afte rall, one of Voldemort’s most loyal subjects by association. It seemed almost
the eye-roll in Potter’s voice when he spoke again. “Obviously. You might as well follow me, then, instead of staring at owls and empty letterboxes.” Potter managed out as calmly as he could--though the slight sneer wasn’t lost on the blonde.
, he thought to himself. The scathing bite of sarcasm balanced at the tip of his tongue, but the blonde knew better; instead, teeth clenched hard enough to cause the muscle in his jaw to jump.
Potter hadn’t changed one bloody bit since the war; he was still a smug, good for nothing jock with a hero complex--and while Draco knew a part of him was indebted to the Chosen One, he couldn’t bring himself to swallow his pride just yet.
Draco’s community service hours were tracked five days a week, every week, from eight-thirty in the morning ‘til the clock struck six o’clock sharp. The only exception to his grueling hours were his weekly meetings with Dr. Caudwell, affording Draco with a ‘late start’ in his day.
In spite of his reluctant acceptance, Draco found himself loathing his time in muggle London more and more; at least in Diagon Alley, the noise and raucous conversation were endearing. Muggles, on the hand, were a foreign species altogether it seemed. With their small, pocket-sized devices handy at all times and their blaring cars, muggles were an enigma Draco couldn’t figure out. Their mechanical devices--mobile phones, or something or another--made strange beeps and whirrs at all times, the sudden alarms enough to jar the blonde in his ill-fated journey.
“I’m fine.” It was a lie spoken with complete clarity and ease in spite of the tension still coiled within the blonde’s frame. Draco even offered a shrug to validate what he meant.
The woman seated neatly before him had her dark gaze trained on the notepad settled in her lap, a careful hand taking notes to fill the stretch of silence between them. Draco almost wanted to scoff.
Conclusion: Draco was sure Dr. Caudwell was intimately familiar with exactly why he was here in the first place.
. There was no way it could be empty at this time of day; it seemed as if everyone and their mothers in the Ministry of Magic waited for Draco to arrive in order to dump an inordinate amount of busywork into his lap.
But then again, what did he know? The Wizengamot had voted unanimously that his damaged, used-to-be-a-Death-Eater ass deserved to see a
“Oh, please,” Pansy scoffed. “You spent seven years obsessing over Potter this, Potter that! Oh, did you see he was made Seeker? Oh, did you see that my broom is nicer than Potter’s? Oh, bloody hell, is that Potter being suspiciously Potter-like at the end of the Great Hall?” Each one of her exclamations were wailed out with a shrill, pitched cadence. Pansy’s feigned-distraught expression contorted momentarily before it finally fell slack, a knowing look taking over in its stead as she raised her brows. “I do believe, my sweet, that that is nothing short of obsession.”
Draco’s entire expression went slack as his mind snapped back to a memory from the day before; Alabaster--Ryder Alabaster, the one member of the Wizengamot that had seemed genuinely sympathetic to Draco’s case and the one person in the entirety of the Ministry that seemed to warn the blonde of any ups and downs he may be forced to face--had mentioned to him that he had a special duty during the upcoming day. Admittedly, Draco’s thoughts had been faraway and disjointed, far too preoccupied with his therapy session to make real sense of what the man had meant. Draco had only mumbled and nodded in agreement without realizing the gravity of Alabaster’s words.
“Well,” Draco began as evenly as he could, slowly allowing himself to turn on his heel, “that’s quite unfortunate. I seem to be running a bit late.” His words were spoken carefully, clipped discomfort coloring his tone as he forced himself to look away from Potter in a last-ditch effort to save his already-battered pride.
Draco fixed the dark-haired man with a withering look, teeth clenched tight enough for the muscle in his jaw to jump visibly. Harry
A startled hiss escaped Draco as he turned sharply on his heel, stormy gray eyes locking onto an all-too-familiar pair of brilliant, emerald green hues.
With a slight shake of his head, Draco dispelled the thoughts plaguing his mind. His footsteps were careful as he allowed himself to fall into autopilot, long legs carrying him up to the letter-room where his daily tasks were surely waiting for him. The room in question was a sprawling office that housed numerous cubbies for every Ministry employee available and an open window for owls to duck in and out with their deliveries.
A beat of tense silence settled in the room, thick and suffocating as the man in question flared his nostrils with a sharp inward breath.
gently dusts off this fic... hi friends! i know its been a hot minute since i last updated, but i hope everyone's been doing well! the pandemic has had me going stir-crazy and after a long hiatus, i've decided to return to this fic and see where i can pick it back up from where we left off. i now have a writeblr that has helped me stay motivated, so check me out @ofdivinities if you want sneak peeks and updates!
If it weren’t for that damn Potter and his intolerable hero complex, he wouldn’t even be here, having to submit himself to the Ministry’s iron will. He was supposed to be grateful to that spectacled buffoon for saving his skin from Azkaban--and yet, all Draco could feel was disdain. He didn’t want to bend to anyone else any longer. He was Draco fucking Malfoy, for Merlin’s sake, and Draco Malfoy didn’t take orders.
His mother and father were lucky to be out of the public eye for the first time in years; the Malfoys were no longer being chased down in a witch hunt of poor taste. Which, in itself, was a blessing. Lucius had to serve a handful of months in Azkaban along with many of the others, but Narcissa--Narcissa had been what saved them all. Draco knew that he would be forced to share the same fate as his father were it not for the debt stupid Potter owed to his mother.
It was always his fault. Every bad thing that happened in Draco’s life had been, in some shape, way, form, or degree, Potter’s fault. Damn Potter, with his ratty hair and too-small glasses. That Potter was equal parts idiot and foolhardy, leaving chaos wherever the went--
He could read the slight lines of irritation around her mouth and the impatience between her thin lips as they pressed together. Not that he could entirely blame her.
After some minor edits, here's chapter 2! Chapter 3 is ready, as well, and only needs a few more tweaks before it's ready to go up. I'm super excited to pick this fic back up and I hope! Y'all enjoy it too!
His back pressed against the grimy brick wall behind him, leaving him with just a few slow seconds to inhale and exhale. Storm-colored eyes slipped shut for a moment--and for the first time since his appointment, Draco was able to just
. The roar of the city seemed to fade away into a dull rumble, the acrid and sour smells of tar, oil, and smog no longer tickling his nose.
The familiar clench of his insides sobered Draco as gray eyes blinked open to the sight of the Ministry bustling around him. The rush of apparition still lingered in his bones as the tall blonde shook out his hands and stood at his full height once more.
PHEW this one! took some effort at first but I think i'm happy with the direction it went. hope you guys enjoyed and don't forget to leave a comment / kudos if you enjoyed!
Draco pulled his hand away, lips curling down at the corners into the makings of a confused scowl before he bent his head to peer into the opening. It was dark--
The war must have destroyed all of his critical thinking capacities, Draco noted sourly; first therapy and now this. The first few days had been tolerable enough--save for the dagger-like glares shot in his direction every single time Draco turned his back to others--but progressively, his time in the Ministry became more and more intolerable.
i know the boys didn't interact at all in this chapter but... we are a slowburn so strap up! next time around, we will hopefully get some good good drarry content (eye emojis.)
Those last few words were all Draco heard before his tall frame immediately shot up to his feet, back erect and shoulders squared. Not a single one of these sessions went by without Dr. Caudwell halfheartedly wishing for some semblance of improvement in Draco’s behavior--and yet, the bitter blonde felt no remorse in expressing his disdain so obviously. He didn’t bother with a goodbye, merely offering the woman a curt nod before turning pointedly on his heel and shouldering his way out of her office.
His daily schedule consisted of picking up the tasks waiting for him in his designated cubby, skimming through it, picking up pumpkin juice for the receptionist at the front of the auror’s office, then ticking off whatever tasks he managed to complete before it was time for him to be dismissed.
The peace lasted for only a few precious moments before his entire body contorted with a muted pop and the bustling backdrop of London winked out in the blink of an eye.
Draco never had time for himself any longer--but here, even if it was just for a few lonely moments in a dark, putrid alleyway in muggle London, he could breathe without the watchful eyes of the Ministry or the wide-eyed gazes of passerbyers trained on him. It felt good.
Hidden away from the prying, dead eyes of muggles, the blonde felt as if he could catch his breath for just a moment.
to send him out into the streets with no supervision before he had been properly rehabilitated and monitored.
Draco had originally seen this as a gift. But now, he would have much rather been kissed by a dementor or ten than be subjected to this woman’s vaguely disappointed state.
Vulnerability was weakness--a lesson he had been taught far before the darkness of the war had seized his life and left it in shambles.
With a muffled grumble of resignation, Draco ducked his way past a throng of school-aged muggle girls giggling their way along the sidewalk. He barely registered the sound of their shrill, high-pitched voices as the darkness of the narrow alleyway swallowed him whole. He had found the small nook on his way to his second visit only two weeks prior--and Draco found himself taking a liking to the shaded spot quickly enough.
Despite his study of the chipping paint--the wall was a rather ghastly shade of off-yellow behind the shocking white pain, he noted--Draco could vaguely register the swing of Dr. Caudwell’s bob as she shook her head ever so slightly. She was speaking to him again, the blonde knew, but he didn’t care enough to listen this time around. There were only a few more agonizing minutes left for today’s session and the more Draco blocked her out, the less inclined he felt in participating. This was his fourth weekly visit but he had no intention of exposing the treachery of the war and just how deeply the pain of it ran. Not now, not soon, and hopefully--not ever.
His robotic footsteps carried him into the letter-room before he was able to snap himself out of his thought-muddled daze. It wasn’t until pale fingertips scraped against an empty cubby that Draco was able to fully focus back in on his work. His nails scratched unhappily against the rugged wood surface of the small crevice, forcing a grimace to his lips and a crease to form between pale brows.
It was, incidentally, Draco’s first stop at the top of the morning. Everything ran like clockwork here and Draco was no exception. It was easier to follow the schedule rather than deal with angry muttering and dirty glares by taking initiative on his own, after all.
“No.” She knew him too well. He’d never really told her – or anyone, for that matter – about his wish to have children.
‘There’s a good boy,’ Harry murmured absentmindedly, making Draco stiffen. He’d never heard Harry say such things outside of the two heats they’d shared and somehow it was
They stopped in front of the bookstore and Draco pressed his lips against Harry’s for a chaste kiss. “Nothing’ll happen, okay? It’s only two hours and I’ll be spending them in a
The door rattled open again, and this time the stranger entered. He was better dressed now, donned in a grey suit with a light blue pair of robes draped over it. “Hello, Draco.”
‘Most of this happened because everyone keeps treating me like I’m the victim of some heinous crime and because I keep acting like I am one. But I’m sick of that. I want to move on from what happened. I like you a lot but I hate it when you treat me like I’m made of porcelain.’
“Yes, we brought this dealer in illegal substances in and Smith apparently hadn’t handcuffed him right or something, but anyway, as soon as we were in the department he broke free and conjured a swarm of bats. He escaped and the entire department spent hours spelling the bats away.”
Harry went right back to work when they arrived at home, leaving Draco feeling a little abandoned. He tried to force that feeling away. It was okay - they’d celebrate later tonight. And who knew, maybe it was good to be alone for a while. To process the news.
‘Good.’ An arm sneaked around his stomach and pulled him closer to the other man. He could hear Harry sniffing up his scent. ‘Me too…’
“Healer Roberts mentioned that twins usually come early,” Harry commented as he stepped into the bathroom. “So it’s more than likely you only have two or three more weeks to go.”
‘Oh… that’s great…’ Draco murmured drowsily whilst slowly falling asleep, feeling intensely sated, tired and happy.
Elizabeth’s cries softened to a quiet sob, and Draco held her close to him until that, too, stopped. “I really need a shower. And sleep.”
“Stay with me now,” Harry breathed, squeezing his knees closer together so that Draco could feel the pressure of it on his hips.
anything, because as soon as he tried that, Draco became agitated, annoyed and a little angry. He wasn’t quite sure
‘It’s okay,’ Harry smiled, kneeling down next to Draco and placing a steadying hand in the small of his back.
WELL FINALLY! Here's a full chapter of smut. Our two lovely main characters are finally going to bond and I think it's just perfect.
Hermione returned three days later, armed with a suitcase, Harry in her wake. Draco was out in the garden, enjoying the beautiful fall afternoon when they arrived. He saw Hermione first and got up to greet her, bit froze in his place when he saw Harry.
“I guess they-” Lupin sighed, gathering a deep breath as if he were trying to force the words out, but they didn’t want to come “they decided it would be better if we could not see each other anymore. They arranged for me to stay with Tonks.”
Blaise laughed, ‘becoming a teacher is easy. But gaining a position here is much harder. They only hire Betas, of course, because Alphas could upset our Omegas. Next to that, Parkinson only wants the best people, the most qualified teachers. After all, Myrion has a reputation to live up to.’
‘I don’t know,’ Hermione sighed, ‘I’m close to thinking maybe I was wrong all along and there is nothing to make a case out of. Maybe I just overreacted when I noticed the amount of abuse records. I just – I’ll go to the Ministry to request those files.’
“No, it’s not,” he murmured. “It’s just… I’m not… You’re not my Alpha.” It came out a lot more defensive than he had wanted it to and he could feel a blush creeping up and colouring his cheeks.
“Look at me,” Harry growled and Draco opened his eyes, seeing a blurry vision of his strong mate. He smiled, then managed another needy whine.
His father’s gaze slid towards him and Draco looked back blankly, trying not to let emotion show on his face.
In the time she was gone, he made an emergency plan. He would allow Harry to take care of him, but only for things he
Draco shifted a little, wanting to look down at his feet but since he was in Harry’s lap, that would mean he would be staring at his Alphas groin. ‘I – ahm – I don’t really know how to say it.’
“How long before they take effect?” she then asked, and Draco decided that she was serious after all.
Before they left the dingy pub, Draco scanned the room, finding Remus in a darkened corner, speaking animatedly with someone hidden away in the shadows. With another pull on Harry’s arm, he indicated it to him. It made the Alpha breathe out and relax next to him before he guided Draco along into Diagon Alley.
Slight warming: this chapter contains some dubious consent. If this is a trigger for you, please be cautious when reading it or maybe skip it completely (even though you might miss out on some details on the story that way)
Draco pushed his heels into the matrass, trying to get some leverage and moaning when Harry pressed a third finger in. ‘Sweet Merlin!’ He cried out when Harry’s fingers started grazing across his prostate. It took all his attention so he never noticed Harry sliding down until he felt a warm, rough tongue lick his cock. ‘Harry!’
“Fuck, Draco, you’re so tight,” Harry panted and Draco clenched his muscles teasingly, loving the feeling of intrusion, loving how Harry slowly came to a standstill, unable to push in deeper. When Harry moaned, Draco relaxed his muscles, allowing the Alpha to move again. The slow slide, deep, slow thrusts inside him made Draco choke on his own breath and moan readily. “Harryyyy…” he whined.
Suddenly filled with energy, he put them on and yanked the door open. He hugged the lady firmly. ‘Thank you so much.’
“I don’t… Draco, it’s… hard for me to talk about.” Harry closed his eyes. Draco could feel the tension in his body, and although his instincts pushed him to do something about it, he wasn’t sure if anything he could do would help. He pressed a little closer to his warm mate, lifting his hand to card his fingers through Harry’s hair. “Did he hurt you?”
Adelaide nodded. ‘The neighbour – I drank tea with her every Friday morning – heard some unusual noises and alerted the aurors. I don’t remember much of this because when I was transported I was still in heat, but Molly told me that one auror couldn’t keep his mouth shut and told someone at the Prophet. When I was brought here I recovered quickly though.’ She looked up to him, as she was just a hint shorter than he was, and frowned a little. ‘And then you arrived. We all thought you were going to die, Draco.’
Apparently, what Draco needed was to decorate the entire house for the holiday season. He went to the unused room on the top floor where all the Christmas decorations were stored and spend several days sorting them out. The first day he went in there, he nearly choked on the amount of dust that had accumulated over time. “Sweet Merlin, Harry don’t you ever clean this room?”  he coughed as he stepped back onto the hallway.
He nodded and watched how she pulled out her wand, muttering a few things under her breath and conjured some more blankets. She waved her wand and the blankets were draped over non-existent bed posts, creating a blanket fort within minutes. With another wave, the tray with tea, food and un-approved literature floated through the door in the fort. ‘Close your eyes, Draco.’
“Mommy?” Elizabeth - impossibly small, the absolute cutest even at age four - stood in the doorway holding her stuffed dinosaur insecurely. She had skipped the little hellion phase that Victoria was still stuck in.
“Bella will set you up with the extra vitamins, and I’ll make sure she adds some more information on twin pregnancies. I’d like to see you back in three weeks.”
A hand slid over his cock, fisting it firmly and at the same time, Harry moved his fist inside Draco.
Mr Potter looked at Draco’s mother, waiting a bit too long to reply. ‘Of course, Mrs Malfoy. I understand.’ He relocated his gaze back to Draco. ‘You may dress now, thank you.’
‘Good morning, darling.’ His mother sat at her usual spot, cup of tea in her hands and the Daily Prophet next to her. He sat down carefully, as dainty as he could. It was still a work in progress though and he could tell from his mother’s frown that it still wasn’t the perfect, elegant motion they were trying to create.
‘It’s okay…’ Harry soothed. He carefully let his hand slip out and made a shushing sound when Draco sobbed in despair. ‘It’s okay…’ Harry kept one hand on Draco’s back when he moved to lie down as well. He made more soft, shushing sounds as he pulled the Omega on top of him, positioning him so that they ended up in the position he knew Draco favoured.
‘Oh, right. I forgot,’ Draco apologised and he put his hand to the cold, brass gates, that opened when he removed his hand. The gates would only open for an Omega, and had been glamoured to only show the school building when one stood outside the gates.
‘I thought so,’ Harry chuckled. He tugged on Draco’s trousers, pulling them down with his pants in one go, making Draco gasp. A warm hand re-positioned his leg, giving Harry access to his arse as well. ‘Fuck, Draco. You’re wet.’ Harry gently pressed a finger against his entrance and Draco whimpered, ‘I am?’
“You’re just saying that because seeing me fat and pregnant makes your Alpha lizard brain happy.” Draco allowed his voice to sink, using his best imitation of a brute: “strong Alpha make strong babies.” It made Harry burst out into laughter. “Please tell me I’m not actually like that.”
Draco followed him into the bathroom, where Harry readied a bath. Harry ran his hands through his hair. ‘Get yourself together,’ he muttered to himself, ‘your Omega needs you. Your personal feelings don’t matter. You promised you’d take care of him.’ He drew in a deep breath, sighed just as deep and then went back into the bathroom where Adelaide was still waiting and went down to the guest room with her in silence. Harry stepped into the room first. ‘Draco? Adelaide told me…’ he did that awkward cough-thing, ‘anyway, I’m taking you to my room, can you still walk?’
wasn’t inappropriate – and pulled him along. ‘Come on, we only have an hour and you need to see it all if you want to give Adelaide that detailed report.’
Draco walked up to Harry, who was still at the checkout desk, and hugged him from behind. ‘Thank you Harry.’ He wasn’t really all for public displays of affection, but Harry needed to know that Draco was still interested in this courtship. If Adelaide hadn’t picked up on Draco’s engagement, Harry probably wouldn’t have either.
Draco leaned into the kiss to make it last a bit longer. “No, I’ll be fine,” he sighed. Last time Harry had brought him to the Burrow this early they had walked into a rather disturbing scene and Draco hoped to avoid such things from happening again by dropping by a bit later.
He’d never liked vomiting and this was no different, but as he flushed his mouth clean with water, he reminded himself that it was for their baby, and that it was a sign it was developing healthily.
‘Damn it Draco,’ Harry cursed, ‘I don’t know what else to tell you. I like you, I want you, and Ginny and I are
Draco sneaked out of the guest room, turning his head every few steps to check if Adelaide was still asleep. Having made it out of the bedroom safely, he looked at the dreaded staircase. Most, if not all steps were creaky.
Rolling over once more, he wondered what time it was, and if his mother knew what had occurred last night. If she knew, she must know about all the other times. But she never had given him any hint that she might know. Maybe she knew, but thought it was how he was supposed to be treated. Maybe she thought it was what he deserved. Maybe it was really what he deserved.
“We’re going to up the dosage of your potions, and add in something that’ll help stimulate the next heat, okay?” she then continued, “you should be expecting the next heat in two, maybe three weeks from now if you start with the new ones tomorrow. How does that sound?”
alone, and if the scent of himself and the twins on the Alpha were not enough to send other Omegas running, this would show everyone who would dare set eyes on the father of his children that he had a fiercely possessive Omega at home. One that was not to be fucked with.
Mr Potter answered his smile and got up. He bowed once more and left the room, not even giving Draco time to get up as well and mimic the motion.
Hermione accepted the call. Her voice sounded far away and distorted to Draco. He opened his eyes, only to be confronted by both Ron and Remus looking at him worriedly.
‘It’s okay,’ Harry reassured him as the put Draco down and turned the shower on. ‘You will go into heat again soon enough.’
“Yeah, it’s upstairs, in the nursery,” he said. His brain didn’t catch up on the question. It was slow, occupied by other things happening in his body and the weird-feeling, hard-to-describe tugs that had been coming through the bond in unison with the cramp and contractions all morning.
The next morning, Harry and Draco got up together. Breakfast was a quiet affair, and despite the fact that Draco wasn’t afraid anymore, it was a bit awkward, too. When it was time for Harry to leave for work, Draco reached across the table and took Harry’s hand. “Don’t go.”
Eavesdropping was impolite and very un-Omega-like to do, so of course Draco jumped out of his seat and stealthily walked up to the wall. He flattened his body and pushed his ear against the wall, trying to overhear more of the conversation than just his mother’s dismayed cry. It was difficult though, and for the most part he could only make out parts of the conversation. Mr Potter spoke clearly and it was easier to hear what he was saying. His mother, probably aware of the fact that Draco could eavesdrop on the conversation – that was exactly why they had chosen these rooms, so she could overhear what Draco would say – spoke much softer.
The first thing that came into his vision was red hair. Not just red hair, but like, red hair. It wasn’t really vibrant but very red still, and he guessed the lack of vibrancy was due to old age. That seemed most probable, because the lady looked like she was… old was impolite to say, but she seemed to be about his mother’s age, and he never thought of his mother that she was old. She had a warm, friendly smile and he smiled back at her without really wanting to.
“Draco – where did you get that child?” Harry eyed Draco alarmingly. “Don’t tell me you stole a child.”
‘I don’t think Harry would mind it to quarrel with you. He quite likes how life-like you are,’ Mrs Weasley gently questioned Draco’s answer.
Draco waded through the haziness in his head. Did the Alpha have a name? He must have… everyone had a name… ‘Harry… Please…’ he begged again.
When they broke apart, Harry murmured, “you know what, I think I’d rather lay down with you for a bit. We can take that walk tonight.”
Mrs Weasley gasped, her eyes widened and she covered her mouth with her hand in surprise. ‘Really?! Are you sure about that, it’s such a defini-’
Back home, Draco convinced Harry that going upstairs, taking a shower and getting properly dressed would be well worth his while, so while Harry did that, Draco scoured their room for things that smelled like him and Harry and collected them in a spare laundry basket. When he was done, Harry wasn’t out of the shower yet, so Draco went on to the office to look for other things.
Draco made a poor attempt to smile back at her, his stomach churning, because now he’d have to tell her. ‘It’s just that I went into heat that night and I was still mad at Harry so I refused him… and erm. Harry didn’t respond too well when I kept declining his offers to help me.’ It was uncomfortable to talk about, but Mrs Weasley had helped him with how to phrase what he wanted to say without it being so horrible that he couldn’t talk about it at all.
“I’m bringing you back to the Ministry,” Harry said, tone not allowing protest. “You can discuss the terms of your pardon there with the appropriate person.”
The sunlight on Draco’s skin felt good, and he lifted his head to allow the light to stroke his face. He sighed.  “It’s good to be outside again.”
The sound of Harry’s voice made an odd sense of relief rush through him, and he shook his head against it. “No. Don’t placate me.”
“They’re like safe houses, just a little less friendly and homey, I suppose,” Remus answered, gazing ahead of them, his mind once again hard to reach. “I doubt Hermione will be able to get them to agree with that, though. I’m thinking low-security prison, daily visitation rights with monthly conjugational visits.”
Draco looked at Harry, studying his handsome face in the light of the green flames and looking away coyly when Harry looked back. He could feel Harry’s gaze burning on his body and bit his lower lip, feeling the slight tinge of arousal coil in his stomach.
“Harry what’s wrong?” he asked finally, letting out a sigh. Harry looked up at him, frowning. “What do you mean?” he asked, picking his fork up. He twirled spaghetti around his fork and raised it to his mouth, staring at Draco expectantly.
Frowning, Draco ran a hand through his hair and opened his notebook, scanning through it, he ran his fingers along the lines and shook his head, turning to the next page. "What does this bloke look like?" He turned the page again, looking up to meet Harry's gaze. "Err - he's about six foot, black hair..."
“Stupefy!” Came the voice of Lavender, Harry hadn’t even noticed she’d entered the building. Backing up, Harry exited the side door, closing his eyes briefly. The light change dazzled him, he slumped down against the side of the building and took in a deep breath. He could feel the panic rising up in his chest, almost unable to breathe.
“We checked the barn, the farmhouse and the stables.” he noted. Over to the right there was a vast forest stretching across the entire area, which meant to the left where a dirt track led from the farmhouse to the outside road was the only way to get in or out with a vehicle. Of course that didn’t apply to wizards, but Harry wondered about the forest. “Did anyone check the outskirts of that forest?” Harry asked, pointing over yonder. Draco followed his finger and frowned, shaking his head. He looked down at the piece of parchment he’d brought with him eyes skimming the checklist. “No, they checked the boundary of the field, the barn, farmhouse and stables, the only things that weren’t checked were the cellar to the south of the farmhouse and the forest area, they checked the main road and the stretch of their dirt track, the vehicles outside, the combine and the tractor.”
hair. They’d be better off ginger.’ Ron can be a cheeky swine sometimes. Personally, I just don’t care. I’d love it if our little one had your gorgeous hair, but if they inherit my untameable locks then so be it. We’ll love them in all their knotty glory.
Trying to get Louisa’s attention seemed to be a task in itself, she was completely absorbed in the conversation about Quidditch, from enthusiastic hand movements, her eye’s widening, to the smiles she flashed the red headed idiot, it made Draco’s skin crawl. Not because he found Weasley particularly abhorrent, but more because Weasley was an arsehole. In Draco’s honest to Merlin, slightly biased opinion.
A massive apology for the lateness! My brother ended up getting out of hospital late last night so I had to drive down and collect him. I offer a double chapter as an apology <3
Harry stopped outside the last door at the end of the corridor, taking in a breath he reached out and turned the door handle, stepping inside the room. His eyes immediately rested on Draco’s frail, unmoving form. Harry felt sick, just yesterday they’d been having an albeit weird, but lovely day together.
Draco nodded, he shifted around in his seat and settled against the back of the booth seat. “I see, I thought you’d have joined the Aurors.” he said, Draco hated making small talk. It seemed utterly surreal he was exchanging small talk with
In front of him was the newest edition of the Daily Prophet, with yet another headline depicting the Saviour of the Wizarding World’s antics. “Every fucking day, all the bloody time - can’t they just leave me alone for five minutes?”
“Hello, Granger.” he had replied shortly, bowing his head a little. Draco was starting to get irritated at the amount of unusual reactions his body made towards Potter, as they trawled through the many shops in the Village, Draco mostly kept his head down, staring at his feet as he walked. He’d never felt quite as uncomfortable as he did in other people’s company.
He could hear the clanking and banging of Harry rummaging around his room, grunts and sighs. Draco stood up straight and walked towards Harry’s bedroom door, knocking lightly. “We’re going to be really late today.” he mumbled, wincing as he heard Harry curse loudly. “I can’t find my fucking wand!” Harry yelled, wrenching the door open. “It’s on the coffee table.” Draco frowned.
Harry had landed bang in the middle of St. Mungo’s entrance building. His spell began fading, instead of recasting it Harry moved forwards and wrapped his arms under Draco’s frail body, carrying him through the double doors. “Auror down!” he bellowed, signalling towards the Healers on duty.
“I love you too.” Harry said, leaning forwards he pressed his lips to Draco’s, the blond’s eyes widened, he smiled against Harry’s lips his eyes drifting closed.
When Harry entered the Ministry, he let out a sigh. It felt wrong being here without Draco, he was a constant in his life. He felt nothing but a hollow shell without the man he cared so much for. Harry had decided whilst sitting in St. Mungo’s staring at Draco’s unmoving form that when he woke up he’d tell him, he’d tell him everything.
Looking up, a paper air-plane memo began flying through the office and landed in the centre of Draco’s desk. Carefully, he unfolded it and read the words. “Meet me, water cooler, twenty minutes. H.G.” standing up, he straightened up his robes and walked over to the cork board, inspecting Harry’s handiwork.
well, he still considered a better friend than any of his old ones. It saddened Draco a little, but he knew after the war a lot of the Slytherin’s had either moved out of the country or didn’t keep contact because of his family loyalties.
Harry stopped in his tracks and let out a laugh. “Well they publish articles every other day telling the world of how much of a ‘
“So, I have to ask,” said Potter, who sat casually leaning against the booth wall, circling the rim of his drink with his index finger. Draco raised an eyebrow. “How did you end up with a muggle best friend?” he finally added, he looked somewhat embarrassed to be asking the question, well he was either embarrassed or inebriated judging on the pink tinge to Potter’s cheeks.
When Draco first met Bethany, she looked at him critically and told him if he hurt her sister she’d break his neck. The smirk that formed on Louisa’s lips could rival his own, she carefully told her sister that he was in fact gay, and if he wasn’t she wouldn’t be interested anyway. Draco protested highly at this.
Harry began to read through the book, nodding his head at times, shaking his head at others. He especially liked Draco's margin notes 'This guy seems like a bit of a wanker' and 'Dropped his wallet, bent over and I could see the bloody moon.' He could tell Draco had spent a lot of time doing this considering the book seemed to be full of entries. He also noted Draco's handwriting hadn't changed since school, still beautifully written cursive.
Harry always felt like he was being interrogated every time he came here, he was always on what he labelled as ‘the wrong side of the table’ “There’s an organization we’ve been tracking and investigating, we don’t know their official name so we’ve dubbed them the Celtic Serpent,” he started, picking up the photograph he slid it along the table for the two of them to look at. Hermione’s eyes scanned the photograph, then raised to meet his. Although she’d been his friend since he was eleven, she really didn’t give anything away in her facial expression, neither Unspeakable Wilson, who he still didn’t know the first name of.
The sight of your owl tapping on the window, your fancy writing on the envelope. Even the slight scent of the Pepper Up potion that I inhaled as I ripped open your letter. I’m not ashamed to say I felt a lump in the back of my throat. Each of these reminds me of home, Draco. I’d do anything in my power to Apparate back to your side. I’d possibly even give that wheezy old Crup Orion a kiss.
After eighth year, Hermione and Ron had moved in together - Ron had immediately proposed to Hermione. Harry moved into a flat above a Domino’s Pizza in Muggle London, just outside Diagon Alley with Draco.
The eighth time it happened, Draco was sat at the furthermost table in The Three Broomsticks, he was staring down at the table, his eyes trailing all the different shapes and patterns in the grain of wood.
Once Harry had left the office, he let out a breath and made his way through the corridors, finally coming to the lunch room. He spotted the white-blonde hair of Draco and frowned. Draco stood by the water cooler in the break room with Hermione, they appeared deep in conversation. When Hermione’s eyes travelled and rested on Harry, she straightened up, nodded her head and exited the break room uttering a polite hello to him as she walked past.
“Endelton, where the fuck are you?” he mumbled under his breath. If he didn’t get to him in time he’d be as good as dead, the only reason Draco wasn’t dead right now was purely to do with their timing.
Though he was sure the shittiest meet up in the entire world would be your former nemesis enquiring about your ex boyfriend.
His head shot up, turning in Lavender’s direction. He gestured for her to enter his office and opened the door, slipping inside. Lavender jogged back to her desk and pulled a few files off her tray, then made her way quickly towards Harry and Draco’s office, closing the door behind her.
Kingsley cleared his throat and gestured for Blaise to sit down. “I have made the Department of Mysteries aware of our current case,” he started, shaking his head. “I must say, that is the most graphic and truly horrifying report I have ever read, Auror Malfoy.” he sighed.
Although Draco liked Glen, he couldn’t help but feel every time he came he flirted with Harry, sometimes it was a wink, a playful shove of the shoulder, their eyes would meet longer than Draco liked. He knew it wasn’t his place to be jealous or stop his friend from being with someone, but he’d never really saw Harry with anyone before and the thought of doing so made him feel nauseous and uneasy. “Hi Glen.” he said, nodding his head towards the boy. He was maybe about twenty four years old, dark black hair and eyes as blue as the ocean. He wasn’t bad to look at and you could tell he went to the Gym. Curses, Draco thought. He really didn’t stand a chance did he?
