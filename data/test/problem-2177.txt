"What- why are you here?" Potter asks, still managing to retain some of that Griffindor confidence despite his confusion.
Draco shakes his head. "I really wish you didn't lie to me, Harry. It's more than disagreements, i'm not dim, I know that. And honestly, your friends are well aware too."
"There's a book I need. Excuse me." Draco says when it gets too painful, escaping before his heart is damaged beyond repair.
That was the wrong thing to say. "Is it? Oh well, pardon me then." He slams the door on Harry's foot again, making him grunt in pain,
He can feel the trio's eyes on him as he practically flees the table, darting into Merlin-knows what aisle.
Healing pleases him. No one would guess so ; the irony of an ex Deatheater for a healer seems too much for most people to look past. He can't fault them - It's strange to him too.
"He's a snake. He'll lie just to get you to trust him, and when you turn your back he'll bite, i'm telling you. He's playing you!"
"Potter, there's no need." He says it shortly, a lot harsher than he intended it to be. He can tell that Harry picks it up immediately, but because he's somehow
"What? Oh really, Potter, i'm not going to say I missed you too. What are we? Third graders?" He huffs quickly. Of course he'd never admit to it. His attachment to Harry shall forever remain hidden in some deep, obscure part of his mind.
"It's ugly." Draco mutters. He looks away when Harry draws his hand out from under the covers, light catching the black ink burned into his skin, like a brand of the enslavement he'll never truly be free from.
"I have to borrow usually, just for the class. I'll have to talk with Professor McGonagall about borrowing one for the entirety of the N.E.W.T.s."
"I'm sorry." He blurts, and even to him it sounds awkward and out of place, though he's trying to be sincere. He's sorry that Harry sounds sorry. Sorry for the aching pain and guilt painting his voice.
Another simple pleasure - that's why Potter, and Draco, are here. A childish joy for young adults who've had to grow up too quickly.
Draco freezes immediately, irrationally worried that somehow he'd managed to bore a hole in his mind with all his racing thoughts, letting Harry see right through him. But Harry continues, taking Draco's visible discomfort to mean something it doesn't.
It feels like a stone in her stomach. "Draco?" She asks, though it's futile to do so. She knows he's talking about Draco, it couldn't be anyone else, even if he'd left out the gender.
"Probably not. I'm not allowed to do advanced spells unless they're supervised,so they won't see the point in letting me have mine back."
Draco frowns. First of all, it's strange Harry's telling him to begin with. Second of all, the thought that the great
The words seem more real coming from Harry's mouth and not her head, and she almost childishly begs Harry to take them back.
"What?" Draco says dumbly. Harry, standing in that pose with his hair tousled and his awfully casual muggle clothes stunts Draco.
Harry's lopsided grin returns to his face, and he grabs Draco's arm to pull him closer in again, but Draco resists.
But, instead of his usual nightmares, he dreams of something- or someone, rather - far more unsettling.
Draco looks up at the second uninvited guest of that day, standing in the frame of his door, not entering, but not daring to leave. "Harry..."
The retort Draco had planned out falls dead in his mouth. He can't make fun of Harry for treating him like a child, not when he's looking at him like that.
“He stepped down, trying not to look long at her, as if she were the sun, yet he saw her, like the sun, even without looking.”
And of course, his father never talked to him about love. In fact, the only thing he said on the subject was;
How do you feel about angry Harry? Is he behaving too possessive, too controlling? Or is he just  sick of being questioned?
"Okay." He says. "Okay. I'm sorry." Draco sighs, rubs two fingers to his forehead and shuts his eyes. He's starting to understand Harry's perspective, and god does it make him look like an ass.  "I didn't mean to insinuate anything."
He rolls over, fully intending to let his hazy mind get the better of him, leaving him to drift back into his potion induced dreamless sleep. But his plans are dashed when a soft projectile hits his head, drawing out another groan from the barely conscious boy.
but he really solidifies his reputation of acting before thinking when he marches forward, drawing his wand.
"I can vouch for him!" A third voice interjects. It's Hermione, bounding into the room. She'd obviously been listening to every word, as expected. "In potions, today. He was just as much of a wart at first, and I thought he really hadn't changed, but then I asked him to talk to Harry, and he said yes in a heartbeat."
His head is spinning, and his chest feels tight as a coil, and he's quickly loosing control over himself and the conversation so he has to say something.
It's sad, really. He wants Harry's happiness, even if it means he's not the one to give it to him, and whatever it is that's going on with them ... it can't be making either of them happy. The speed at which they switch from loving to distant is starting to give Draco some serious whiplash.
Draco steels his nerves, promising himself that tomorrow, he'd muster up the courage and push down his ego and apologise to Harry.
He's preoccupied with the way Ginny's fingers intertwine with Harry's on her lap, how they brush over the top of his knuckles, how he squeezes her hand back ever so often to show his appreciation.
"Stop." Harry says, closing the door and walking past Draco to pick up the dumbbells and dump them in a chest nearby.
"Well," He clears his throat, standing up abruptly. "You were right. The lake's way too cold for this."
Draco takes a step away from the door. This is awful, he's eavesdropping on their private conversation like some sort of obsessive stalker. But he can't help but overhear.
"I saw her inside earlier, actually. I don't mind waiting for her to come out. Or we could go in and you could find her?"
Harry's talking, Draco's sure, but he only catches parts of what he's saying. The spell caused an overwhelming ringing in his ears, like someone's inside his head, knocking around a bell.
"Come with me." Harry says, interrupting. His eyes are bright and open, and shamelessly cajoling him into agreeing. "Please. I'm sorry for today ... just let me make it up to you."
Harry had vehemently denied that public impression was a valid reason to forbid their relationship, but evidently he's changed his mind. Or maybe, it's not the public's impression he really cares about. Draco was right to bring up his friends; and now that Harry's
A whole day of Harry ignoring him; even if he's not at fault, is painful. Harry needs space, and he needs to work through some things by himself, Draco knows that. He just wishes, somewhat selfishly, that it wasn't the case.
They all know what she means, despite her uneasiness with finishing the sentence. The remnants of the war continues to haunt most, leading to an increase in the demand for a protection based curriculum. People want to know they can be safe again.
An uncomfortable silence settles thickly over Hermione and Draco when she returns, both unsure of what to do other than finish the work set out for them.
Draco's eyes close, and he realises starkly with Harry's words that his fear isn't a fleeting one. Slowly his breath and thoughts return, fatalistic and far more reasonable to his mind.
"One blueberry muffin. It's sweet, you've got to eat it." Harry says, dropping the muffin onto Draco's plate with a triumphant look.
"Alright." He says quietly. The shame, which he'd managed to ignore for thus far, starts to inch it's way back into his mind. He escaped Azkaban, but he's doing his time regardless.
"One of the hardest lessons in life is letting go, whether it’s guilt, anger, love, loss or betrayal.
." Ron repeats, leaning in to search Harry's eyes with his own. And then, he's walking out the same way he came in; agitated and upset.
"Alright. I'll wait out here, if you need me." She makes no move to leave from Harry's side, instead chewing up her lip in worry. Harry looks at her pointedly.
He's saying so much more with this kiss, raw, unadulterated passion bleeding through and overwhelming both of their senses. He's demanding and a little rough but just enough that it won't hurt Draco, and his actions speak a million words, though they really only need to speak one;
It's just that, for once, things seem to be progressing exactly the way Draco hoped them to. Hermione's spent countless nights with him, studying from dusk till dawn, until their tired eyes sting too much to read another word. Luna's walked him to class when she's afraid to leave him to brave the corridors alone, babbling on about this and that to calm private nerves he'd never dare voice to her. Even Ginny's shared a rare smile with him on occasion, when he'd accidentally let a snarky but superficial dig at Harry fall past his lips.
He sits and watches as students get paired up one by one, silently rejoicing when Ron's paired up with a Ravenclaw boy. Or rather, not with him.
"I'm not surprised." Ginny answers, and it's the first thing she's said to someone who isn't Harry. "I mean..."
It rolls into the water with a plop as Draco sucks the blood from his skin, and a funny feeling rises in his chest. It keeps rising, through his lungs and up out of his throat.
There's a pounding at his door, desperate and angry and brash, and Draco's so startled that he very nearly shatters his cup. He's really not in the mood to talk to anyone right now, but the nagging feeling that the door will probably break down under the deafening blows anyway makes him set down his cup down on the bench and walk to the door, tugging it open after a moment's hesitation.
Draco shivers, at a loss for words. His voice- low and ruined, it sends chills down Draco's spine. And the way he looks at him; eyes narrowed like a challenge, a duel. Daring him to say no.
The grin that stretches across Harry's face is unnervingly innocent and naive, considering the situation.
Almost like he's whispering soft comfort in his ears, like his arms are wrapping possessively around his chest and waist, like his lips replace his hands and drag gently down his neck ...
Potter is laughing with his friends - It sounds different to Draco, somehow. He much prefers it when he's the one to make Potter laugh.
." It's not Harry's fault, really. Draco's just taking out his frustration on him. He figures if he can't see Potter as 'just a friend' - he discovered that soon after vowing to rid himself of his feelings, much easier said than done - he should at the very least get some grace period to vent his dissatisfaction.
Harry sits opposite him at the tables, next to Hermione and facing outward to the rest of the hall. It stings him a little bit, much more than it should, and suddenly, Draco realises just how exposed his usual seating position leaves him. Funny, he never thought about it when Harry's body was so close to his, stilling any threats or whispered accusations that could be thought up by other students.
Hey, I know, for once she's on schedule! I wish I could promise you my next update will be as prompt as this one, dear readers, but unlike Draco, I'm not so sure I can stick to that promise. Por favor me perdoe?
Draco peers around him, to see the Griffindor stumbling down the hallway, clutching his stomach, in clear agony.
Draco flinches at his tone. It's accusatory, cold. Ron's never liked him, but it's not just hatred burning in his eyes. It's something much more visceral than that.
He wants to argue, he wants to feel every bit of the rage he felt that got him into this mess to begin with, but he just can't, not when Harry's looking at him like he's the only thing that matters in the world.
makes him weak at the knees and weak at the heart, too. Harry's effectively stunted Draco both cognitively and physically.
"Sure." He says lowly, whispering the password and stepping past the threshold, into the communal living space for the dorms as quickly as he can. He's doing Harry a service by that apparently, seeing as he would like to take as little risk of being seen together as possible.
And it's paradise; the smile Harry has saved just for him, the rough but gentle fingers kneading into his shoulders, the secret conversations they have, glimmering lake and lonely moon the only witnesses.
"I don't understand." Draco says. "You say that like there's no chance you'd ever be friends again."
He hates that Harry's not the only one he feels sorry for, too. Ginny's an amazing, albeit cautious, person, and as much as Draco detests her relationship with Harry, he simply cannot detest her. Especially not after she's been so tolerant with him.
Draco's too distracted again. God, Harry looks so attractive when he's focused. He has no right to be, the rest of his classmates look like they're about to throw up when they attempt non verbal spells.
Draco doesn't care enough to conceal something so conspicuous from Harry, so he relents. "It's this whole ... Christmas celebration. Forgive me for being sick of people talking about how they'll spend it with their
"It would seem so." Draco murmurs, his embarrassment only aiding his reluctance to turn around and face Harry. Even if he did, he doubts it would do much good in the way of his nerves.
The grip on his waist tightens, in such a proprietary manner that he's almost convinced he shouldn't have even asked.
It was a bad one. One that sticks around with him for most, if not all of the day that follows his sleepless night.
Almost as pathetic as Draco is - so hungry for even a small show of mercy and benignity that he becomes possessive over Harry's very much non specific altruism.
But disgust is absent from Harry's reply. "I'll talk to her, if you want. About getting your wand back."
Draco realises the likely hood of Harry succeeding in his endeavour is probably non existent, but the gesture means more to him than the act. His words were more than just that; words. He's really willing to let people know about them - and more than that, he's willing to publicly argue
But even as they fall into a childish rhythm, Draco can't help but think about that look on Harry's face.
Ron and Ginny aren't at the table when Draco finally returns to breakfast the next day. His eyes dart over the awkward empty spaces, heavy and impenetrable in their hollowness. He can feel Harry's eyes do the same, can see him tense up next to him.
"Wait." Harry says, after a few second. Draco's hand hovers over the door handle. "I'm sorry. Please don't go. I shouldn't have said what I did."
the one about to conquer a fear, but this is clearly not the case, demonstrated rather evidently with the way he enthusiastically mounts the broom, all the confidence Draco doesn't have.
"I was already close when I heard you. I was taking a shortcut out of the castle." He replies causally, the words tumble from his mouth like
Draco's not-sleep is disturbed by a rough banging on the door. He almost writes it off as the wind, until his name is being whispered harshly at him past the wood. "Draco. Wake up."
just her replacement?" Draco whispers so quietly, so incredulously; he half hopes Harry doesn't answer.
Hey, at least I finally made them kiss right? Please don't be mad, I'm swamped with exam revision ( not a good enough excuse I know, lead me to the gallows for that is what I deserve). Maybe their first real romancey romance is consolation?
Now this, this is too much. It's like he's in Draco's head. Actually, Draco's starting to think that maybe he really IS inside his head. Harry's got to be using some kind of
Ah, Ronald. Draco looks up from where he'd stumbled back, hand clutched protectively to his chest. "What- Weasley what are you doing?" He asks, more confused than scared or angry.
The boy who lived is SUCH a ridiculous name. Draco can't understand why people say it with such reverence. It sounds utterly idiotic. He wouldn't be caught dead referring to Harry Potter as such.
Draco, now more than ever, has to look out for himself. Ginny, Ron, the whole family really, despise him with an intensity he can't begin to describe.
"Do you ... do you love me like you loved her?" His tone isn't steady and calculated like he imagined it to be. It's weak and agonisingly limpid as his eyes, and he knows Harry can look through him and flay him out, raw and exposed as he'll ever be.
The boy who lived, legend for his bravery, looking jumpy. It's strange to say the least, but Draco doesn't know how he didn't notice before. The closer the pair had got to the dorms, the more anxious Harry looked. Now, he's basically bouncing on his feet.
He looks nervous, ready to watch his life spiral out of control and it’s too much like Sixth Year for Harry to digest.
The lift shudders and groans, making Draco nervously glance around them, wondering if this is how it really ends for him. He only let’s go of his tight grip on the handrail when the lift stutters to a stop, doors opening with a loud clang and an announcement—
The conversation dims slightly, Emma shooting Everly a chiding look even as Draco studiously avoids looking at Harry.
Draco finds himself seated across from Harry. He’s already in conversation with Everly, the Harry of now a more sociable and open version than the one he remembers. He realises this is the first time he’s actually seeing Harry interact with someone in a social setting. It’s a jarring thought, reminding Draco just how hidden away into each other they were.
I need to breathe, the air is struggling in my lungs as I look down at where we’re joined. I can see sweat drip down my nose and onto his back as I hang my head over his body, waiting to give him time to adjust.
- all mingle together as Harry weaves through the crowd around the bar. It’s a routine, they have a pattern. Tonight is a night to reclaim.
It was Potter. Though the other was quite bundled up against the cold—a thick scarf wrapped around his neck covered most of his face—the glasses and messy, windswept hair were dead giveaways. Despite the chill in the air, Draco could see he was sweating, his breathing laboured and loud in the otherwise silent morning.
They move together, lips brushing hesitantly at first before they gain confidence. Malfoy pulls back, leaning his forehead against Harry’s.
, feel Draco’s body. Draco shudders at the touch, biting down on Harry’s lip when Harry digs his fingers in a little. He knows they should stop soon, Scorpius can walk in any minute and Harry isn’t sure just how much he knows about Draco and his relationship. But it’s so easy to get lost in the kiss, especially when Draco is doing that
“Harry,” Draco calls out in greeting, eyes soft as he takes in the scene in front of him. “I see you’ve caught the little runaway.”
Mrs. Weasley, the head of the family, not all the other, numerous, Mrs. Weasley’s, has hugged him more than once, thanking him for the pie he bought, cooing over Scorpius and trying her best to make him feel welcome. Draco doesn’t have the heart to tell her that he has a thing about people other than Scorpius, Harry or his mother touching him.
Prompt for the week: "It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends."
He’s just at the last stage of the spell process, waiting for the previous spell to settle, he raises his wand, the incantation ready on his lips –
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The fourth morning was the coldest, and for some reason Draco found himself more restless than before. He’d tried all of his usual tricks to calm down, even attempting some of the meditation tricks as he’d been advised by the Ministry-appointed Healer he was required to communicate with as part of his sentence, but nothing was helping. Frustrated and a little exhausted, he found himself heading towards the lake before he could make up his mind. By the time he was halfway there, he figured he might as well go all the way—the worst case scenario was that it could be someone from his year and he’d be forced to attempt some form of interaction. Not that most people responded to his attempts, but Draco didn’t want to give anyone a chance to say he wasn’t doing his bit to integrate himself with those at Hogwarts.
Harry’s words die in his throat as he takes in Draco’s appearance. They’ve been playing in the snow for an hour or so and the bitter wind caused a flush to stain Draco’s cheeks, wisps of hair peeking out from beneath the wool cap that Molly had insisted on knitting for him. Even dressed in all these layers, and there really are too many layers, Harry wonders how Draco ever survived the Hogwarts’ winters, he can’t help but rake his eyes over Draco’s body.
“I’m not sure how I can assist, to be honest. My line of work focuses more on research than on solving cases,” Draco remarks, following Everly towards the back of the Atrium from where multiple lifts are zooming in and out every second.
Harry shushes him with a kiss, unable to keep his hands off of Draco. “But nothing,” he assures him, tucking a lock of Draco’s hair behind his ear, “the best surprises in life are unplanned.” Draco’s sigh of relief is enough to make Harry kiss him again. This time Draco pulls back, moving just enough so he can look at Harry, his face radiant with a smile.
Maybe it’s the tensing of his shoulders or the way he purses his lips but Harry doesn’t push it. He steals another quick kiss, smiling when Draco’s frown melts to a confused pout.
He still remembers the hopeful edge to Father’s voice, the look of relief on Mother’s face when that wolf had brought those prisoners in. He can still smell the stench of his fetid breath on his robes, the rotting stink that permeates the room.
Harry manages to light the fire, open a bottle of wine and light some candles. Even though the electricity isn’t on and there seems to be little in the way of food besides crackers, it’s enough for them to spend the night and wait for the storm to die out. Apparating is out of the question in weather like this and he feels exhausted, neither conditions conducive to a safe Apparation.
Malfoy takes a deep breath, strokes the puppy’s back once before letting him down to the floor. Harry realises that he can’t just stand there and listen without having something to do. Almost on autopilot he reaches for the kettle, tea
Harry. That was another topic he was trying hard not to think too much about. It was difficult though, to go from spending more than half his day with someone to only being able to catch up via rushed Floo calls and a single, brief visit. He was trying not to feel too upset about it; he knew Harry had a lot on his plate with first getting the required paperwork and the medical tests done and then the actual Trainee Program itself.
idea what to do with today's picture prompt and clearly my brain can't come up with simple alternatives.
Draco chuckles, neatly slicing a few into pieces and sliding the plate over to Teddy. “Harry isn’t here right now,” he whispers conspiratorially.
I could eat Draco out for hours, have done so many times before. But there’s something exhilarating about doing so while he’s sleeping. I miss his moans and shouts of pleasure but I love being able to move him around and have him completely at my mercy.
Harry shrugs, not wanting to get too into detail with the reasons behind why he knows how to cook. “I do, but I enjoy baking more.”
Draco sits on the stairs the entire night, waiting for the front door to open and for Harry to walk in. Around three he startles awake, the door closing softly behind Harry.
Teddy does indeed wake up at five, managing to hold off for fifteen minutes before he’s shaking Harry and Draco awake. They stumble down the stairs, half asleep, holding onto each other in case they slip.
He had turned then and found Potter standing closer than before, looking nervous as he pointed above them.
“I got a letter from the Institute a few days ago,” Draco starts, playing with the tassels on the blanket. “They offered me a promotion to lecturer if I go back and said they’d even fund all of my research as opposed to the insulting fifty percent they were offering earlier.”
He was content with life continuing this way, a new normal where he was left alone and could make sure he followed everything mandated in his sentence while spending the morning in peaceful silence with Potter.
The day Draco got the letter inviting him to work for the Ministry’s Department of Records and Documentation as a Restoration Expert, he had decided that he needed to set his priorities straight. He had worked hard to get this job, gotten a degree in restoration and archiving, interned under the Prof. who had led some of the major excavations in Egypt and then spent a further six months working for minimum wage to get a feel for the department.
He knows he’s cutting it close, the hour inching closer to four faster than he’d prefer. He also knows if he puts this report off for tomorrow, he’ll regret it even more than having to listen to Hermione berate him for keeping his date waiting. Besides, it's not the first blind date she's set him up on and going by his success rate so far he has a feeling it won't be the last.
The only person who looks they’re having fun is Luna. She’s been chatting with Malfoy non-stop, ever since the moment she walked into the pub with the git in tow, ignoring everyone’s shocked expressions and, in Dean’s case, barely whispered mumblings of displeasure.
Blaise looks away innocently, moving aside some papers on Draco’s desk before hopping onto it. Draco barely, barely, resists the urge to hex Blaise; he has better ways of making Blaise pay. Tripping over the arm of the chair and almost falling down again, Draco stands up, brushing off his coat with dignity while glaring at Blaise.
“Shh,” he whispers, running a hand through Draco’s hair, “they’re okay. Both of them, Draco, they’re okay.”
He flushes, ducking his head. “Scorpius is a wonderful child, he deserves to get every possible opportunity he can. And If I can help any way, then . .” He shrugs, trailing off.
They finally make it to the Atrium, Harry being the first one to run off. He pauses near the revolving doors, looking back to wave at Draco.
Harry steps in with a grateful smile, looking around him, hoping to catch sight of Draco or Scorpius.
Harry arches his back outside their room, finally starting to feel the aches creep up his muscles after a day spent in mostly the same position. Draco tuts and places a hand on Harry’s back, gently moving him towards their room.
As he started walking towards him, Draco frowned as he realised the other boy wasn’t running like he usually did. He seemed to be walking slowly, back hunched over. Before Draco could react Potter stumbled, almost tilting over before managing to catch himself at the last minute.
The remaining 4 chapters will be little glimpses of their life ahead, the family they build together. From the bottom of my heart, I thank each and every single person who read this silly little fic, left a kudos, bookmarked it or, most of all, commented. You kept me going. Thank you. :')
"Draco?" Harry calls again, vanishing the soot with a quick wave of his wand. The house is quiet, the silence disrupted only by the occasional passing cars. The bedroom is as he left in the morning, the sheets rumpled and covers half pushed to the floor. Seeing no visible note from Draco, Harry already has an inkling of where he might be. A glance at the wardrobe confirms it. While his suit is still hanging in the very spot it's been since he got it back last week, Draco's is conspicuous in its absence.
That’s how Harry finds them an hour later, Draco immediately shushing him as soon as he enters. Harry looks on fondly, tucking the blanket tighter around Teddy as he settles down on the floor in front of the couch, giving Draco a detailed account of what happened at the Ministry.
The bell rings just as Harry is throwing away the remains of his first failed attempt at making plum pudding. The idea to throw a housewarming party hit him last night, it would be the perfect way to get his friends all together and show everyone his new house. Besides, it had been ages since everyone had spent time together, what with work taking over all free time.
Feeling victorious at the thought of finally seeing the photo, Harry smiles. That moment feels like it happened ages ago and yet feels like it happened just yesterday. It's sometimes difficult to think back on that period of his life after Hogwarts and before Draco. He knows those two years did happen, but compared to his life now they are so inconsequential that he barely thinks of them. Riffling through the photos now, he's almost startled to see actual evidence of just how much he's changed since meeting Draco.
Harry stands against the entryway, smirking at the sight of Draco in an apron. It is cute, yeah, but the sight made him want to push Draco up against a counter and mess him up a little. Unfortunately, with Scorpius just outside that isn’t really an option but he
He smiles as a familiar great grey owl flies across the sky towards his window. Hermione had been very reluctant to bet an owl, but after months of trying to get Pig to listen to her she had finally caved and let Harry convince her into buying one for herself.
It was short, their lips barely brushing before he leaned back a bit to judge Potter’s expression. The other didn’t let him go far though, finally raising an arm to wind across Draco’s waist and pulling him closer. This kiss was longer, heavier, filled with promise and nervousness and an overwhelming sense of
The sense of comfort he once felt around Harry is starkly absent. Draco isn’t sure if it’s because of the time apart or the way they parted, but it’s enough to throw him off a little. He feels unbalanced in a way he hasn’t in a while.
“I’m . . “ Malfoy’s voice wavers, his breath hitches as he tries to keep his emotions under control. He takes the cup of tea from Harry with a whispered thanks, his fingers clenching around the handle. “I’m not proud of my actions after my release, Potter. I acted like a selfish, brat who tried to pretend that nothing in this world was more important than him. I know that, for you, that’s probably no different than how you perceived me in Hogwarts.”
“I have absolutely no interest in making it a full time career,” Draco makes sure to mention. “I enjoy my research and alone time too much to quit over this of all things.”
Harry waits as Draco collects his thoughts. Without realising it, they’ve moved closer, Draco’s head on Harry’s shoulder while Harry still has an arm around his waist.
Ron already knows where this is heading, no brilliant swirls or hearts for him today. “Order one more hot chocolate then, and one of those cinnamon rolls he loves.”
Harry get’s pulled inside before he can finish his question. Within seconds Draco has him backed up against the closed door, one hand clenched tight in Harry’s jacket as he tries to get their bodies as close as possible. Within moments, Harry is panting, dinner and his nerves all forgotten as he kisses back with fervour, nipping on Draco’s bottom lip and rubbing a hand up and down his back, the wine bottle long dropped on the side table.
Instead, he very carefully takes a seat next to Scorpius and looks outside. Teddy and Draco are shaping the snowman’s body and he knows it’s going to take them a while to get it done, and judging by the mulish expression on the face of the tiny blonde sitting next to him he knows that he’s going to get nothing by pushing.
He doesn’t stay back to hear Harry’s answer, stepping onto the open lift and swiftly shutting the door. When he finally looks out, Harry is still standing there.
Harry smirks at the cover showing mistletoe twigs tied together by a red ribbon with the words “Let make out” underneath.
“Thanks. It’s been pretty great so far.”  Harry trails off. As the silence grows, he mentally curses Hermione.
“Oh, Scorpius.” Harry throws caution to the wind and gathers Scorpius onto his lap, wanting nothing more than to comfort him. “Your Father loves you very
“Aww, no,” Draco soothes him, laughing, he places a quick kiss on Harry’s cheek before pulling him forward by the hand. “I did really work hard on dinner and I would like to hear you compliment me on my efforts.”
Malfoy laughs, the sound wrong, filled with bitter humor. “He does, even when there’s nothing to find.”
The lift pauses at every other floor, witches and wizards getting on and off. With each subsequent stop the frown on Harry’s face deepens, the glances he shoots at his watch getting longer.
Teddy’s energy carries over after dinner, it’s closer to midnight than he would like by the time Draco ducks under the covers. He curls his feet appreciatively, the warm sheets welcome after the brief chill that settled in after their shower. Harry is by the dresser, toweling his hair aggressively till he gives up and uses his wand to blast it with hot hair.
Harry hides his smile and tries to act like he didn’t a word as Scorpius turns back to him and says, in full seriousness, “That means we are neighbours”.
He wouldn’t say he was content spending his days like this, finding the least uncomfortable corner of the Manor to research on what he could plant in the gardens. The majority of his days were spent planting what he’d ordered, relying on owl post for those, the sun warming the back of his neck till it hurt. It was a new normal he felt he could
Harry presses a soft kiss against Draco’s neck, humming in satisfaction when Draco throws his head back, giving Harry more skin to whisper against.
“Draco.” Harry smiles shyly. He doesn't look even half as surprised as Draco feels right now. “It’s nice to see you again.”
He feels someone brush against his front, but without opening his eyes Draco knows it isn’t Harry. The touch is too hesitant, too shy. Harry doesn’t ask, he takes and that’s what makes Draco want to give in to him. Draco steps back, right into the arms of the man he’s been waiting for. Harry wastes no time in pulling Draco close, his hold on Draco’s waist almost bruising in just the right way. They stay like that for a moment, still in the centre of the moving crowd. Draco sighs and rests his head on Harry’s shoulder. Harry starts moving them to the music, his hips lined with Draco’s; there’s no mistaking how turned on Harry is as they sway to the music.
Within seconds I have him spread again and I get to work: kissing, licking and sucking his hole until my spit is dripping down his crack onto his bollocks. I push the tip of my tongue past the ring of muscle and almost moan as he tightens around it. He’s still loose from a few hours ago, which means I won’t have to finger him open again. It also means I can easily fuck him with my tongue.
“The ones we use in Anti-Venom Potions?” Harry asked, leaning forward with interest as Draco moved the pots around. He stuck a piece of parchment in front of each as a label.
He’s muttering to himself, cookie in hand as he flips pages to find something he can throw together with the limited time he has. He’s lost in thought, chewing mindlessly when arms wrap around his waist. It’s a good thing he catches a whiff of Harry’s aftershave, his hand already wrapped around his wand, ready to react as he gets startled.
“Nope.” Harry shakes his head. “I didn’t have a very nice family for a very long time but now I do and it makes me so happy.”
“Some other day, perhaps, your friends are getting impatient,” Draco smirks over Ron’s incessant knocking. Harry tamps down the flare of irritation he feels at his best friend’s ill timed arrival.
“I was stubborn, but more than that, I was embarrassed. I knew that even though I had tried my best to hide my activities, mother was more than aware of what I had been doing for the past few months. I . .,” Draco trails off, takes in a deep, shuddering breath. “I couldn’t face her, I needed time to set everything right.”
It’s crowded and sweaty, bodies moving all around them, and it’s perfect; Draco feels himself get swept up in the tide, moving along the crowd till he’s right in the centre. Blaise has already thrown off his coat somewhere, his shirt tight enough to make men stare. Draco smirks and takes a look at the men around them before leaning towards Blaise and pointing him towards someone who’s been eyeing Blaise all night.
He takes the time to look around the room, it’s nice, cosy, Malfoy clearly hasn’t followed the same decor theme followed at Malfoy Manor, it’s quite a stark contrast. The sofas are comfy, deep grey with red and gold cushions (and Harry
Harry rolls his eyes and nudges Hermione forward, the league of his nameless puppy’s admirers was growing by the day.  Harry can’t take him for a walk without being stopped multiple times on the way so that people can pet and coo at the puppy.
“I dunno?” Potter had shrugged awkwardly, one arm curled tight around the cauldron. “Did anyone ask you to?”
So armed with a tin of his blueberry lemon cookies, Harry Potter walks up the stairs to Draco Malfoy’s house, his face set in a determined, slightly forced, smile.
“Harry, then,” Draco starts, rolling his eyes at Harry’s satisfied smile, “as I was saying, there’s something else you should know, Sc-”
He's already toeing off his shoes and dropping the cardigan to the floor, the slight dip to his side of the bed already beckoning him with the comforting feel only a well-used mattress can have. As he's just about collapsed onto the bed, he feels his feet nudge something heavy. Giving in to curiosity, Harry takes a look and blinks in surprise at the red cardboard box peeking out from under the bed. It's small, about the size of a shoebox but fancier with the Hogwarts crest on the top. As he hefts it onto the bed, it strikes him where he's seen it before. They had received their final letters from Hogwarts in these, a commemorative gift for the Eighth Years to mark their special year. Harry knew for a fact this wasn't his, having long discarded the outer box.
Draco can only nod, shaking Harry’s hand. His grip feels different too, calluses where there were none before.
Before he knew it, Draco was running, a sinking sensation threatening to overtake him as he watched Potter sway where he stood.
Draco though, Draco understands and with a kiss against his Harry’s cheek he wraps Harry up in his arms and takes his weight, lets him lean on someone else for once.
They finally make it to the end of the corridor, in front of an inconspicuous door with a potted ficus next to it. There’s a shiny plaque on the other side of the door.
. Out of his work clothes and the casual jeans and trainers he wears to the Manor, Harry looks older in his more formal outfit of a fitted blazer over trousers. Draco watches on as he greets Emma, giving her a light peck on the cheek and meeting Tara for a hug.
Dinner, after, had been Harry’s favorite part of the evening. He was no nowhere near as tired as he should be, having spent most of the night laying awake in bed thanks to his building anticipation.
He gets his answer the one time Draco gets carried away in his discussion with Emma. It is past seven by the time he realises. On his way out of the department, he’s surprised to spot Harry pacing in front of the lifts. Even as far away as he is, it is clear to Draco that Harry is clearly agitated, one hand running through his hair like it always does when he is stressed.
“Finally, and this is perhaps the most integral,” Draco says gravely, waiting for Harry to lean towards him a little. “Teddy’s toys and Milly and Zeb and the peacock are here.”
“I’ll have the Blitz Banshee and I think Malfoy would like a Hangover Horntail?” He asks, giving the bartender the order when Malfoy shrugs.
Blaise’s smirk softens into a fond smile. “You’ve proved yourself, Draco, more than ten times over. I know I keep saying it but I mean it, don’t let this overtake your life.”
The sixth floor was still unused, the reduced student count allowing for sections of the castle to be sealed off in anticipation of repairs. As part of the eighth-year team working closely on the restoration of the most damaged parts of Hogwarts, Draco was closely aware of which sections were abandoned.
Bottles of champagne are flowing all around and they are soon being hugged by everyone in the room, but throughout it all, Draco and Harry don’t let go of each other’s hand.
fall asleep there,” Potter explained. “Too many people,” he added on softly, looking away in embarrassment.
“No,” Malfoy snaps, pulling the covers away. Harry almost laughs at the owlish expression on his face when he realises Harry’s naked too. “Why aren’t you freaking out right now?”
Harry trudges behind Hermione as they try to make their way down the crowded street in Diagon Alley. He mutters as he moves the many bags he’s carrying from hand to the other.
He’s so lost in the wave of mild terror at the situation coursing through him that he misses Malfoy rising to stand and face him. Now that they’re face to face, Harry finally gets a good look at Malfoy. He looks older, as expected, but hidden under the age sculpted features are still hints of the boy he remembers.
Once he starts cleaning though, he finds himself sort of enjoying it. There’s something almost therapeutic about it. If Draco were there, he would probably call Harry an emotional fool and order him to clean faster.
He’s not prepared for the rush of longing that steals through him as he imagines Draco and Scorpius decorating the tree together, laughing and giggling together as they share this memory. He wants to be a part of it.
that I expect you to come out to see me. Or, you know, wait for you to show up or something. It’s okay either way. If you’re there in the morning or not. You know. It’s
“Come on,” Harry tries, slipping his hand under Draco’s shirt to caress the smooth skin of his back. He slides his hand higher, taking the shirt with him, fluttering his fingers against Draco’s side till he’s squirming, trying not to laugh.
“Sorry, sorry.” Someone rushes into the room, the door clanging shut behind them. “Traffic was brutal and
He puts down his book and stands up, tugging Draco with him. Wrapping an arm around Draco’s waist, he waits till Draco relaxes into his hold. The room is dark, save for the light from the fireplace which lends a warm glow to the ambience.
"It's the best gift anyone has ever given me," Harry says, hoping Draco does not doubt how sincere his words are. "Thank you," he adds, pressing a quick kiss against Draco's palm.
“Mrs. Adams was so so so mad at Robbie,” he babbles excitedly, the spoon in his hand forgotten as he shares his day with Harry. Draco watches on in amusement, gently guiding Teddy’s spoon to his mouth so he actually eats something. He ignores how he himself can’t seem to summon the appetite to finish his meal.
The shed catches his eye again, still as desolate as the day he brought the property and Harry wonders if he can convert it to a workroom of sorts. He’s been toying with an idea for ages, snippets of memories from a time in school before Hogwarts, precious moments free from Dudley and his friends that he would spend in the art and crafts room.
Harry feels no concern for tomorrow because he knows this night, this one chance was more than he could have asked for and more than he could have known that he needed.
Harry waits patiently, no hint of nervousness on his face. Harry’s return into his life also, inevitably, brought back a lot of old memories. While they feel like bittersweet moments from a time long past, what strikes Draco the most out of those memories is how much
The note is short and apologetic, making Draco sigh in sympathy at the thought of Harry spending another night hunched over his desk.
His drunken Auror partner a.k.a. Git of the Year frowns at his answer; he’s swaying dangerously on his seat, the glass of ale in his hand tipped at a precarious angle.
They don’t stay long after, just enough for Harry and Draco to get the more common questions out of the way. Their conversation is stilted in a way it never was before.
He’s shed his outer coat and rolled up his sleeves by the time the sun is at its peak, the temperature charms doing their work by diminishing the direct heat of the noonday sun. Deep in thought, Draco misses the faint knock on the glass door, the sound of leaves crunching underfoot and the unmistakable shuffle of sneakers on dirt.
“Shut up.” he lightly shoved Harry and stalked over to the sofa. “Come on, let’s finish that Potions essay you’ve been putting off.”
I itch to reach out and touch, to feel his skin beneath my palms, to spread him open and see evidence of a few hours ago; to see him twitch and yearn for more.
“Yes,” Harry says, adding hesitantly. “If you want to be. Big families are fun, so many people who love you and want to take care of you. That’s what your Father and I want, for you and Teddy so that both of you are never alone.”
The moment he steps through the doors to Fierté, Draco feels himself relax. As it’s Friday night, the club is certainly more crowded than other nights, but Draco knows that compared to the other clubs out there, it’s not even half filled. Fierté is very selective with its members; given its proximity to the Ministry and Diagon Alley it’s meant solely for wizards and witches.
Harry carries on obliviously, using his wand to reignite the fire under the pot and getting started on chopping the beef. Draco watches on in rapt fascination, eyes tracking Harry’s arms as he deftly handles the knives, the corded muscles in his arms prominent as he chops through the bone with ease. He’s still in his work clothes sans his jacket and outer robes. The stiff white shirt is slightly creased, no doubt from Harry tugging at it all day. It’s still tucked into his well tailored grey trousers, Draco’s eyes tracking his form. He hums appreciatively, proud of himself for finally showing Harry the wonders of proper tailoring.
Harry bites his lip to keep his laughter inside, they’ve already entered Draco’s house. It’s just a matter of getting him to the bathroom.
Malfoy smirks. His eyes never leaving Harry’s face as he nods. “Sure. Harry it is. Is this where I insist that you call me Draco?”
are the male version of a temptress. Tempting me with your, you know, your hair,” he gestures fondly at the offending hair, “your perfect clothes and the way you walk and when you bend –”
in his life he would be worried about the severity and single minded focus with which he’s been consuming these sugary nuggets of gold.
Harry brings Teddy by in the evenings, saying it's good for him to tire himself out before bed. Unlike the first time Harry always sends an owl beforehand, waiting for Draco to confirm his availability before dropping by.
Finally, with a nip at the swell where his arse starts curving, I can focus all my attention on the place I’ve been waiting to taste the most. I carefully move his leg a little further, making just enough space for me to lie down between his legs and get comfortable. I have no intentions of moving for a while.
“What did he do?” Harry prompts Teddy. He looks exhausted, on more than one instance Draco caught him dozing at his seat while he was serving up dinner. However, as soon as Teddy joined them at the table it’s as if he found his second wind. He listens on in rapt attention, his deep laughter mixing with Teddy’s light giggles as he learns about the hijinks of a group of toddlers.
“Potter,” Malfoy groans, “what I’m saying is that I’m not here to bother anyone. If it makes any difference, I’m probably more uncomfortable than anyone else in this room.”
“What?” Draco yawns, trying to drag the crying child to the sofa so he can ask what’s wrong. Harry doesn’t look panicked, just sleep deprived with a pillow crease on his cheek, so Draco doesn’t feel too concerned. So clearly Teddy isn’t in some sort of grave danger but who knows what goes on in the mind of
brewed Calming Draught in a vial and casts the spell on it. He waits with bated breath as the spell works, waiting for it to either change colour to indicate potency of the contaminant or stay the same.
Harry grinned cheekily as he stole a kiss, swooping in for more till Draco’s glare melted into something a little fonder.
Having slept barely four hours, Draco whines into his pillow, willing the incessant chiming of the Floo to stop. After it goes on for another minute and he can hear Milly knock, Draco pulls himself out of bed, stumbling against the nightstand. Pulling on a sweater, he makes his way down the stairs, just about managing to make it without falling over.
He waits patiently as Draco works, his messy hair now a familiar white-blond again. Once Draco leans back a bit, Teddy chews on his lip before speaking up, his voice wobbling.
“Teddy has always wanted a little brother or sister. He was so happy when I told him we were all going on a vacation. He’ll be so sad when he hears you don’t feel the same way.”
Malfoy doesn’t look up from the book he’s reading, one of the many he’s been poring over since they uncovered the reason behind all the magical fluctuations, but Harry can see the tenseness in his shoulders finally relax a little.
“There’s nothing to be done now,” he mutters, downing his potion for the morning in one go. He sighs as he steps under the warm water, the delicious pressure of the spray on his back making him stretch in relief. At the pull in his lower back, Draco bites back a moan and wonders if they
As Blaise dances against the tall, dark haired man Draco feels a pang in his chest; he wants his own man here, pressing up against him.
Winter holidays that year were, perhaps, Draco’s favourite from his entire time at Hogwarts. There were less than a handful of students staying behind, Draco and Potter included. They spent their days helping the Headmistress get some of the smaller repairs out of the way, and at night they retired to the room, which was now covered in festive decorations, complete with a little, stunted tree in one corner that Potter had explained, with flushed cheeks, he’d asked Hagrid to find him.
Trying to be stealthy by using a wandless charm, Harry manages to snag the camera without Draco looking over. He's not too confident in handling it though and the loud whirring of the film is what finally grabs Draco's attention. It's just as he's looking over, eyes bright with a shy smile in place that Harry gets the hang of it. Click. Draco blinks in surprise, eyes creasing into a teasing smile as he places his cup on the windowsill and all but saunters over to the bed.
“Uh huh.” Harry laughs, turning onto his side to face Malfoy, “I’m onto your nefarious act to steal all the blankets.”
But this is Potter's way of extending an olive branch. Why, is still up for debate, but who is Draco to refuse his offer?
- So i've played pretty fast and loose with the timeline, and this chapter has a pretty big jump. So, this day takes place ten days before Christmas, so the 15th. I couldn't find when they all leave for Christmas in the books, so I decided to make it the 22nd.
He moves closer still, and Draco doesn't dare to even flinch. He can feel him more than he can see him, the suddenly suffocating air smelling like, tasting like,
There's nobody in the common room- everyone's at breakfast, so Draco's anxiety over getting caught eases a little.
The nightmares themselves aren't too awful. They're more memories than dreams, Draco supposes. So while reliving them is traumatic, he reasons that if he's survived them once, he can surely survive the
"I'll see you around, Draco?" He says it like a question, even though it's a non contestable fact. There's not a lot of 8th years returning, they're bound to have classes together, starting tomorrow.
It's just them. This epiphany strikes Draco and ignites something in him he didn't think possible. Carefree, blissful joy. Raw and overpowering and untameable and beautiful. It makes Draco throw his head back, bright grey eyes capturing a gleaming grey moon, and laugh.
"Five minutes, got it 'Mione." He says quickly, offering her a placating smile, gently trying to usher her out as soon as possible.
She'd known since that first day at the library, when Draco couldn't keep his eyes off Harry and Ginny, and when they came back together, Harry wearing a self satisfied smirk.
driven by a hormone-induced haze, he's probably woken up to smell the roses that reek of horrible truth.
"And I just ... It's really only about ...." He rambles, struggling to get the words out. Draco almost feels bad for him.
"You know that's not what I meant, Malfoy." Harry sounds frustrated, Draco's words successfully ruffled his feathers.
"I don't want to do this, Harry. Please." Draco's voice drops, eyes lowering to the ground. "Please, just go."
Draco's torn between cursing himself for walking down such a eerie looking corridor to begin with - It seemed like a shorter route - and resigning himself to his fate. He could reach for his wand, but he'd be too slow, and his wand too weak.
Harry kisses him, out of the blue, right after lamenting about his problems with Ginny, and Draco expects a different answer to the one he got?
" He pushes a plate of bacon towards him, which Draco wrinkles his nose at. "No, come on. You don't like
"Of course everyone's all for it." Harry says, angrily ripping up tufts of grass, staining his hands green. "Making me into some ministry official. So how can I say anything about it? I'd let so many people down." He dusts off his hands, sighing.
Draco doesn't consider himself a saint, but the growing feeling of guilt pooling in his stomach makes him start to walk away from the door quickly, before he's tempted to listen in to the whole conversation, and do something he'd really feel ashamed about.
Harry's dressed in muggle clothing again, blue jeans and a worn out moon-grey hoodie. His appearance further befuddles Draco. "Harry ... what are you doing? It's the middle of the night and-"
Draco's ears must be deceiving him. His eyes too, as he could have sworn he saw Harry's eyes flick down to land on his lips.
Autumn fades away, and Winter sets it's sights on Hogwarts far sooner than Draco realises. The first three months of school had gone by in somewhat of a hazy blur; and while another more weary student may deem this fortunate, Draco regrets not grasping tighter to the new memories he'd accumulated.
Okay, all done! Hope that clarified some stuff - I didn't want anyone to get too confused and all that. Thank you for listening to me lecture haha <3 Tysm readers and commenters and everyone who's supported me!!
I started this story maybe not so serious about my writing, but i've really been trying to improve and add new depth to this story. It's still all for fun, and still very playful in terms of canon compliance, but i've been trying to add more subtext and symbolism and all that fun writer jazz. I think this is genuinely one of the best chapters i've written in terms of depth, and that's overall, not just for this work. Also, all this confidence i've gained if definitely because of you guys, the readers. It's even started to help me in my school grades, my writing has improved very drastically and you've all motivated me to be better. I can't thank you all enough.
The way he stands in front of him, emerald eyes shimmering like the water under the sun's light, makes Draco believe Harry's got the whole 'more than just being alive' thing down pat.
When he sits, right in the front, next to Granger and Weasley and far from Draco, the ink is finally spilled, drawing the story of Draco's internal turmoil to an abrupt close.
Draco really wishes the fire that burns through his whole body at Harry's smirk could warm him up externally too. "I'll borrow one. I think discipline counts as educational purposes."
Draco doesn't laugh, nor does he tease him about it. He just stares, letting the information sink in.
"It's what you should want! Harry, this is a huge opportunity for you! I can't believe you're brushing it off!"
, Harry. You have to choose." He says, the ultimatum poisoning the air and making it hard for Draco to breathe steadily.
Draco rolls his eyes and looks away, more to hide his smile than to express any real annoyance. Being in the right is nice, sometimes.
He falls to his knees next to his bed after waiting a second to make sure the door won't swing open to a disgruntled Hermione chastising him again.
The words bounce around in Draco's head, echoing and resonating and having an effect on him he didn't think they could.
Draco stops. Harry's words are a knife through his chest; Draco feels the tug on his heart as though it really was being ripped from inside him. Harry's truth is the sun, and the longer Draco stares, the more damage it does.
"Ron, i'm trying to be understanding here!" Harry says, prematurely snapping in his frustration. He thought he'd loose his cool at
Harry releases the stone , and it skips over the blue expanse of the lake elegantly, dipping below the surface when it stops.
Draco doesn't look at Harry while explaining. If there's one thing Draco can't bare, it's the awful, sinking feeling of shame.
Harry smiled at Draco, and then looked down at the bag, “Thank you Draco. Thank you so much,” he hadn’t seen the gift yet, but he knew that what every Draco had made him was bound to be amazing. He graciously took the bag and moved the wrapping paper to the side. He pulled out one of the small candles and looked at the label. After reading what it said, he quickly smelled it, and began smiling, “It really does smell like Hogwarts! Oh my gosh Draco! And you made one for the Burrow? And Godric’s Hollow! Oh Draco, I can’t believe you remembered everything that I told you.” Harry said, excitedly looking and smelling each of the candles.
Draco smiled at Harry’s contagious excitement, “Of course I remembered, I remember everything you tell me. You’re important Harry,” he said, grabbing ahold of Harry’s hand after he placed down the candle he was holding.
Draco shook his head, he can’t think like that. While Harry is absolutely important and deserves all the best things in the world, these gifts were supposed to be simple, and maybe hold a little bit of sentimental value; they do not need to encompass how Draco feels for Harry. Truly it would be best if it doesn’t show any of Draco’s feelings. It’s not like Harry doesn’t like men, Draco knows that he does, he’s seen Harry go on a few dates with some. Sometimes, if a relationship ended badly, Harry would show up at Draco’s door and he would just pull Harry in and they would sit on his couch in the living room and talk for hours, sometimes about the relationship and what happened, but usually anything else.
“Alright, let’s head out then. It’s at Ginny and Luna’s place this time, do you know where that is or do you wanna side along?” Harry asked, standing up and placing his cup down on the coffee table. He knew he would most likely be coming back to Draco’s after the party, so he decided he would clean it up then.
“Fine! It was you that I got for Secret Santa!” Draco said, rolling his eyes at Harry’s insistence that Draco tells him who he got.
Draco felt like he couldn’t speak, instead, he slowly nodded then rushed upstairs to the bathroom. When he got there he closed the door and took a look at himself in the mirror. His cheeks were slightly pink due to Harry’s comment and his hair was, of course, wet. Flaws, flaws all over the place, and yet Harry? He liked them, more than Draco being perfect. Draco shook his head, and began casting a drying charm on his hair, and finished washing up for him to be ready. When he was, he came back downstairs to find Harry sitting on his couch with a small cup of tea and a light smile.
The truth was, Draco had been in love with Harry for as long as he could remember. Even when they were at each other’s throats Draco still found himself imagining a world where things could be different. Now that things were different, now that Draco found that both of them were being pulled towards each other like magnets, he also found that he wanted to make the best impression he could at all times. So when Harry showed up at Draco’s place later that day, and his hair wasn’t even dried yet, Draco was quite anxious indeed. But he couldn’t just leave Harry waiting on his doorstep! That would be an even worse impression than wet hair.
I dig my fingers into his cheeks and use my thumbs to spread them apart, finally giving me a close up view of his arsehole. I wasn’t easy on him the night before and I can see that in the redness around the ring. It makes my cock ache with the need to fuck him again, to feel him clench and be so fucking tight around my prick, but there’ll be time for that later.
It was a testament to just how out of it Potter was that he went along with Draco without complaint. Thankfully, given the time of morning, the castle was empty—even Mrs Norris was absent from her usual prowls in search of unsuspecting students.
“No, Scorpius, we talked about this,” Malfoy explains, patient and heartless as ever, completely impervious to his son’s heartbreak, “we are not getting a dog.”
go on that date soon. I was feeling slightly unwell myself today so of course someone in the fic had to reflect that.
He didn’t find any mention of it in any of the family journals, poring over each at night to find an explanation for its existence. He’s busy from the moment the sun rises, starting with checking the conditions from the night before to then researching possible hybrid combinations to test.
They have managed to pinpoint the Room of Requirement as the origin of the curse that’s causing surges of magic. It’s been kept contained to just one wing of the castle for now but at the rate it’s growing, they’re sure it would take over the whole castle within five days.
Harry learns that Malfoy is an adorable and affectionate drunk. He stops after one drink himself just so he can appreciate this version of Malfoy, free from inhibitions. By the time they reach the castle, Malfoy is all but leaning on him, rambling about Harry’s hair.
It was only once Draco was satisfied with the authenticity of the cauldron and had levitated it over so it was situated closer to the couch, that he decided to speak up.
As the months went by he found himself spending more and more time among the plants, finding a penchant for regulating and growing some of the tougher plants needed for potion making. It was oddly cathartic, a connection to a form of magic he’d spent his formative years perfecting, yet different enough that he didn’t feel the familiar pangs of pain he felt while brewing.
I hold my breath as  I reach out to trace his spine with a finger, my touch teasing and light. He doesn’t move. I take my time mapping out his back, ghosting a kiss along his shoulder as I sit up on my knees and take in my fill of him. Merlin, but he’s gorgeous. And he’s all laid out for me.
“Oh, nothing like that,” he explains, moving aside to let a witch carrying a crate pass. “Teddy’s day care ends at five, and I’m
They go on the date that night, and Harry finds himself falling just a little bit further. They’re still ribbed at by their friends, everyone mocking just how
Harry casts another irritated glance down the street, there’s still no sign of Hermione. The red telephone booth provides him some measure of protection from the biting wind but he can still feel his lips tingling.
When I can take no more I slowly pull out a little, shuddering at the hold his body has on me, greedy enough to not let go even in sleep. Without pulling out completely I push back in again, feeling his hips jerk as I rub against his prostate.
As snow drifts past the window, sheets of it covering everything in sight, the dining room at Malfoy Manor fills with laughter and conversation, the clinking of glass and the gentle crooning of Celestina Warbeck.
"Then when?" Harry tries again. He's not sure if he really wants to see the photo or if he just wants to keep talking to Malfoy. This Malfoy, who is so different from what he was expecting. In his Muggle jeans and smartly pressed sweater, with an air of vulnerability around him that Harry isn't used to seeing, Malfoy looks approachable in a way he never has before.
Teddy nods, pointing in the vague direction of the living room where he’d dumped his things earlier. The
If Harry hadn’t been leaning against Draco, he wouldn’t have heard the whispered question, an unspoken fear they’ve both been thinking about.
They get to St. Mungo’s in record time, Draco’s wince more pronounced with each contraction. Thankfully, the Healer is waiting for them, ready to sign them in.
Twenty seconds before the Fiendfyre rise its head, ready to devour them, Harry Potter says three words that hold the key to his heart.
As the days speed towards winter, Draco finds himself reaching for an Invigoration Draught by midday. Barely five hours into work, Draco feels his energy flagging. It’s the most baffling thing because as soon as he reaches home, around the time he puts his things away, there’s a spike in his spirits that leaves him feeling re-energized. Blaming it on his body adjusting to the chill in the mornings and the late nights spent in the study while Harry pours over the proposal, Draco adjusts to the new normal as Halloween rolls around.
“Go on,” Harry urges gently, tugging at the blankets till Malfoy is once again nestled next to him, the blankets tucked around them.
By the time they were halfway through the night, one of them would start drifting off, the other following close behind. Draco tried not to think about how he was sleeping more these past few weeks, with Potter close to him, than he had since the start of the summer.
Harry stops at the door to the living room and takes in the sight in front of him. Draco is on the couch, trying not to direct Teddy and Scorpius on the
“I asked you to wait for me,” Harry chided, rolling up his sleeves as he settled down in front of Draco.
Harry coughs. “RIght, about that, listen Malfoy, I know that was out of line, I’m sorry. Umm,” he continues, fidgeting a bit, the biscuit tin held awkwardly in his hands, “as an apology I brought you these.”
Curiosity sated, Draco was about to make a hasty and quiet retreat when he managed to accidentally kick a stray pebble. The sound was enough to jerk Potter out of whatever frame of mind he was in, the boy spinning on his heel, his wand out before Draco could quirk an eyebrow in surprise.
I also experimented a little with the letters, I'm not entirely sure how well those work with the fic but I figured why not since I had some spare time.
“I wasn’t fair to you.” Harry speaks confidently, his eyes bright behind his glasses. “I’m sorry. For not prioritising us and for not being there for you the way you were there for me.”
It’s only when he’s back in the waiting room, that Harry feels the emotions overwhelm him and he all but falls onto the seat next to Ron’s, letting his best friend take his weight. The next thirty two minutes are the longest of his life as he alternates between pacing the room and hugging the life out of his friends. When Healer Walsh  enters the room, Harry sobs in relief as the man walks up to him and says, “You can go see them now. Draco is still sleeping but your sons are waiting to meet you.”
Draco rolls his eyes fondly but makes no moves to take it off. He lets Harry grab his hand and tug till he's reclining against the pillows and Draco is leaning on him.
Blaise hops off the table, coming to stand in front of Draco, “It’s Friday night, my friend, and that means it’s time to party.”
Draco feels warm all the way down to his core. He would have never imagined meeting such kind people that he would actually want to stay in touch with.
. There’s no reason I can’t have both. Maybe this makes me a pervert who gets hard on seeing his boyfriend sleep, but it’s not my fault. Draco shouldn’t be allowed to look so pretty as he sleeps.
Before he can ponder any further, Harry grabs the dishes from his hand with a quick peck to his cheek.
“Are you sure he won’t accidentally spoil anything?” Harry asks cautiously, keeping an eye on Teddy slowly making his way down the row. Draco shakes his head, noting down his observations to send to Emma.
Teddy is still a little shy in front of Draco, opting for one-line answers and preferring to hide behind Harry or try to get the elves to play with him. Draco tries to tell himself it’s okay—he’s never been too fond of kids to start with—but a part of him wants Teddy to like him, to be as playful with him as he is with Harry.
Loki jumps as Draco opens the door, quieting down when Draco shushes him. The puppy, though he’s fast outgrowing that name, sleeps in Scorpius’s room but when he wants to be let out in the morning it’s Draco or Harry he comes to wake.
Harry frowns in confusion as Draco carefully takes off his coat instead of answering him, making sure it's back in its customary spot on the back of a chair before he turns back to face the bed. Harry fleetingly wonders if Draco is getting ready to hex him, losing that thought as Draco toes off his shoes and climbs onto the bed.
Draco stares, certain he’s never come across this structure, despite walking through this patch of the gardens many times before. It’s all metal and glass, the panes slightly dusty, but he can make out shapes and greenery behind them. The building is about five times the size of Hagrid’s hut, with the highest point of the domed roof towering over thirty feet above the ground.
Draco carefully helped Potter climb the stairs, shouldering the entrance gate open before guiding him inside.
Draco paused from where he was rifling through his bag. The abrupt change of topic threw him off. He frowned, confused, over at Harry.
“Well, yeah, I just wanted to know what it's like.’’ Harry pushed his glasses up to rub tiredly at his eyes. “My dad was an Auror, too,” he added softly.
Christmas at the Manor used to be the day he’d get whatever he asked for. There had been no gift, no toy, no new broomstick that he demanded and didn’t receive. It was the day all his wishes were fulfilled.
Malfoy had shown the room and then walked out the door, muttering about “meddlesome Gryffindors” and “pain in my arse”. He’s not sure if he should keep waiting or just leave his biscuits here and go.
Thankfully the sidewalk is considerably less crowded, making it easy for him to sprint to the end of the street and into the park. Even though it’s still too bright out for the holiday decorations to be on, there are people strolling along the paths, the sound of children playing can be heard from all the way across the park.
Dave is nice, easy to talk to. Harry can see why Hermione thought this might work. Despite his best efforts to pay attention to the man in front of him, Harry can’t help but think back to the moment in the park.
One such point of contention was their friends. Draco didn’t have many to start with, and any he was close to had long decided that Hogwarts was no longer the place for them. They were still in contact though; Pansy wrote the most regularly, letters filled with requests for him to visit or to take care of himself if he insisted on staying away.
Scorpius won’t get a chance to go to Hogwarts. He’ll never get a chance to learn about magic or fly a broom.
“Hey, Malfoy,” Harry waits till the man is looking at him before he continues, making sure to maintain eye contact, “it’s okay. It’s not something you can control, I would know because I used to get them too.”
It's hard to resist teasing Draco a bit further though. "Look at you," he leans forward eagerly, the plush blanket sinking under him as he tries to get Draco to look at him,  the flush on his cheeks very telling. "Let no one ever say Slytherins aren't sentimental fools."
Not happy with this at all, I had a ridiculously exhausting day. I feel bad for sharing such a sucky chapter, hopefully tomorrow's is better!
As a lift finally arrives, Harry sighs in relief. He rushes in and presses the button for the Atrium, Draco following behind him.
“You haven’t given me any reason to feel differently, Harry,” Draco whispered, the fight seeping out of him. “I’m just so tired of being the only one fighting. I can’t do it anymore.”
!), Draco heads into the kitchen to get started on dinner. It’s not his forte, Harry is definitely better at whipping things up, but Draco wants to surprise him for once.
Harry grimaces. He had only agreed to the books because Hermione had insisted. Malfoy laughs as he ruffles his son’s hair.
“Oh, Harry,” Draco coos, softly brushing away the tears pooling under Harry’s lovely eyes. Harry catches his hand before he can pull away, bringing it up to his mouth to press a lingering kiss before grasping it tightly.
Before Harry can leave, Draco calls out, "Blaise is free to babysit Scorpius on Friday. If you're available for dinner? I still need to make up for skipping out on you last time." He looks nervous, fidgeting with his sleeve as waits for Harry to reply.
Like Draco would ever willingly come between something Harry maybe wanted just because he didn’t want to be left aimless alone.
“So . . . “ Harry trails off, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly. He knows what he wants to do but he’s still so scared of taking a wrong step and ending up all alone.
Scorpius looks shocked, understandable because Harry hasn’t ever had reason to be so firm with him before, but he nods nevertheless.
When Harry storms out of the house, Draco can’t even remember what it was that started the entire fight. All he knows is that he said things he shouldn’t have and Harry kept taking it till he couldn’t anymore, storming out after finally giving back as good as he got.
His bafflement must be apparent for the man to speak up, extending a hand for Harry to shake. “Dave Holland? I work with Hermione, we met at her party last month.”
Curious, he grabs his wand and heads outside, the midday sun pleasantly warm. Within minutes he’s at the maze, walking around it to reach the other end. As he turns the corner, he raises a hand to block the direct sunlight and squints through the glare.
“Did you know, when I was your age, I had no friends. Only my cousin and he wasn’t very nice so I used to play alone.”
Hermione’s smirk makes Harry swallow nervously. His belated, “I don’t know what you mean,” is weak, even to his ears.
“Harry,” Hermione whines, linking their arms together, “I’m sorry, I got caught up in some work that came in at the last minute and -”
He wants to share this feeling with Malfoy, show him how he makes  him feel. But he can’t find the words to express himself, so he kisses Malfoy instead. Slowly and softly, one hand cradling Malfoy’s cheeks as he presses him back against the wall. Malfoy wraps an arm around Harry’s waist, the other hand burying  itself in Harry’s hair, making him moan and nip at Malfoy’s lip.
He knocks once, fixes his tie and flatten his hair. The door opens and he’s face to face to with his one time nemesis after six years.
“Come on, into bed both of you,” Harry gently herds them along, knowing full well just how long it’s going to take them to get changed and tucked into bed.
As Draco takes Scorpius inside, squaring his shoulders, Harry points out, “Teddy, he’s just five, you’re thirteen. He didn’t really mean it. You can fix this.”
He’s ready to give the people a piece of his mind—there’s absolutely no reason anyone should be calling him
He didn’t even want to entertain the thought of having to go back to the dorms; he’d rather go live out in Hagrid’s hut with his slobbering beast of a dog.
It’s as he’s walking up the snow covered steps that lead to his front door that he hears the sound of a child’s laughter from the house next to his. He only looks that way to take in the beautiful decorations around the house but what he sees makes him freeze on the spot.
As he thinks back to the rush of yesterday morning, the mad haze of him and Harry brushing shoulders as they got ready together for once, reaching over each other for things and taking little ill-times breaks to make out against the dresser. With slow dawning he remembers hearing the reminder ring through the bathroom and with even more clarity remembers Harry using his tie to pull him towards the bed.
Harry can feel the heat creeping up his cheeks and he hopes Hermione thinks it’s because of the cold and not because he can’t stop thinking about how Draco had looked in the bathroom. How much he had wanted to lean in and kiss him.
As he walks past the information desk, nodding at the witch who hands him his morning reports, his eyes track over the patients queued around the desk. He’s almost at the elevators, hand out in front of him to press the button when he freezes. With slow dawning horror, he turns and his eyes instantly find the witch standing halfway down the queue.
Dinner is a comfortable affair, a routine born out of many such cosy nights. Teddy is full of energy, eager to update his Uncle Harry about all the high intensity affairs in his class. It makes Draco look on fondly, biting his lip as he wonders how the scene might look with an addition. He can already imagine where the high chair would go, maybe with Teddy trying to feed his little cousin. It’s an image that makes him warm, makes him want to instantly blurt out his secret. He waits though, uncertainty still ever present. Soon though, he promises himself.
Taking in the sight of Draco, with his wind tousled hair and smudge of ink around his chin from where he was probably lost in thought while replying to one of Hermione's many owls, Harry almost wishes he had the camera close so he could document this moment right here. He resists the urge to look for it though, some moments are best preserved the way they are.
“Mr Malfoy,” she shakes his hand, grip warm, “thank you for accepting our request. I’m Madeline Hanes, Director at the Office of Forensics.”
Harry flushes, aware that he was ready to jump instantly into action, but the thought of Scorpius being subject to discrimination for something he hasn’t done makes his temper rise and his heart clench with protectiveness.
Though he took down the Stasis Charm—he needs more organic conditions to test viability—there’s still a shimmer of magic around the glass structure. It tickles his skin as he passes through, almost as a welcome. Milly and Zeb have instructions not to disturb him while he’s in here, but the fresh cup of tea every few hours shows they’re still checking on him.
Blaise lets go, but stands between Draco and the table, his arms crossed and hips cocked, “Friday nights are ours, Draco. It’s tradition and you don’t mess with tradition.”
After carefully stashing the significant pile of Teddy’s gifts under the tree, Draco makes his way up the stairs. A quick peek into Teddy’s room brings a fond smile to his face, chuckling at Harry’s inability to say no. As suspected, he enters his bedroom and spots not one, but
Harry was still looking at the letter clutched tightly in Draco’s hand, brow furrowed. “He was one of the examiners for my Defence Against the Dark Arts N.E.W.T.”
“This is ridiculous,” he pouts, running a hand through his now messy fringe.. A flick of his wand makes the knives stop mid air and rest gently along the cutting boards. Grabbing another cookie, Draco goes back to reading the recipe from top to bottom, determined to figure out where he went wrong and how to fix it. He’s so engrossed in reading that he doesn’t register the chiming of the Floo or the sound of his husband dumping his things near the kitchen door.
"It was on the floor," he explains, hoping he looks as contrite as he feels, "and it had the Hogwarts crest, I just wanted to see what was in it."
The meeting with Mrs. Pembrook, the Society’s current Chairman, went well, better than Harry had been expecting. Draco had come prepared with questions, each answer making him relax a little further.
With a stroke of inspiration, Harry grabs his wand and fashions a bow out of parchment lying on the bedside table. With a quick wave of his wand he makes the bow float over to Draco till it settles daintily on his head, a little lopsided but still very pretty. As the gold font visible on the front of the bow sparkles a little in the light he realises he used one of the spare invites. It seems even more fitting now.
Draco is quiet next to him, their hands occasionally brushing each others as they walk back home. The silence between them is comfortable, each content to just enjoy the company of the other. They pass a group of carolers on the corner, their voices providing a melodious background to the otherwise silent night.
Malfoy looks pointedly at the half-empty glass of Gin in front of him. Harry blinks at the glass, then blinks up at Malfoy. Shaking his own empty glass around, just about whacking Neville on the head with it, Harry tries again. "Why aren't you drinking? I mean finishing? "
Harry heads for the living room, the door left ajar, giving him a perfect view of the scene inside. The fire is lit, casting warm light over the room as his children play on the rug in front of it. Scorpius, his little scholar, is poring over a colouring book, filling the colours in neatly within the lines. Albus, the complete opposite of his twin, is focussed on his Quidditch models, making the miniature of his Aunt Ginny zoom around the room.
Scorpius trails off, sobs wracking his tiny frame as he hides his face in Harry’s shirt. Harry bites back his own tears of frustration at the world for making his little boy feel so insecure and hugs him tighter,
Teddy smiles up at him, his already messy blond hair even more rumpled now. To Harry’s constant chagrin, Teddy spends the majority of his time with hair like this, a mix of theirs, like he can’t pick which he preferred.
Knowing there wasn’t much else he could attempt in terms of repair, Draco had found himself creating some semblance of a room within those damaged walls. While the side facing the corridor was still intact, the outer wall had been clearly hit by some sort of spell, a large chunk of it missing, creating a pseudo window of sorts between the two existing arched windows. A standard Shield Charm and enforced heating spells were enough to give the room some semblance of warmth. The extra cushions and spare blanket he smuggled from the Slytherin common room added to the strangely comforting atmosphere of the room.
training exercise.  Truth be told, Harry’s been waiting for a chance to finally step out into the field and actually use all the defensive and offensive spells they have been reading about for a long time.
“Now come on,” Draco calls, standing and pulling Scorpius up with him. “There’s a piece of chocolate cake waiting in the kitchen for a special little boy.”
with his tongue and Harry can actually feel his knees go a little weak, he decides to leave it to Draco to stop and let’s himself get lost in the moment.
Of all the possible ways he saw this night ending, this wasn't even a possibility (Malfoy kicking him out, Malfoy hexing him, Malfoy hexing him and
“‘Fraid so,” Harry says solemnly. “Though,” Harry continues, leaning forward till he’s almost nose to nose with Draco before saying, “I can make it worth your while.”
“Did you know I’m still under probation?” Malfoy asks. Only his eyes and hair peek out from above the blanket and Harry is stunned by the sudden urge to brush back Malfoy’s hair from his face.
Later, after consuming breakfast, which Harry doesn’t remember much of because Draco had his foot pressed against Harry’s the entire time, Harry asks Draco what Pansy sent him.
“Hey you,” Harry greets him, sliding the drink over once he spots the scowl on Draco’s face. To his surprise Draco nudges the glass away, opting to move his seat next to Harry’s and lean against him.
He’s unaware of the snow falling softly around him, living in this neighbourhood is going to be more interesting than he had thought.
Draco looked up and sure enough, levitating in the air above them was a bright sprig of mistletoe, tied together with a golden ribbon. Potter was looking at him, his eyes bright and full lips set in a determined pout. He didn’t move, gazing expectantly at Draco.
Malfoy nods and take a seat on the floor next to Harry. They are settled against the couch, with the fire roaring in front of them and the storm raging outside and it’s comfortably cosy.
Harry blinks awake gradually, the pull of sleep trying valiantly to drag him under but the cold air around his feet wins. Half asleep he pulls at the covers, smiling in triumph when he manages to drag them over so he can be saved from the wretched cold. He's blinking awake a few seconds later though, wondering just why it had been so easy to get the blanket when his bedmate is notorious for hogging them through the night.
He turns left, the fresh layer of snow crunching under his boots. Hermione had mentioned his date would be along the central path that runs clear across the park. Harry frowns as he recalls how oddly secretive she had been about the date, forgoing her usual detailed brief for a cryptic, “You’ll see.” All he had to go on was that this mysterious man would be in a blue wool coat.
Without waiting for a reply he turned on his heel and marched back to the castle, back straight and head held high. He could feel Potter’s gaze on him even as he climbed the stairs to the Entrance Hall.
He’s entirely unprepared for the sight of the little boy sitting just inside the door, watching the scene outside with tears in his eyes.
Draco sat back, disappointed. If the Floo was locked, it meant Harry wasn’t home. With how erratic Harry’s schedule was, Draco wasn’t surprised to find no one home despite it being only nine am.
While, fine, there is a point to be made  here because  it  is true that he and Malfoy  make a really good team, what with Malfoy’s extensive knowledge of tracking and planning and Harry’s penchant for attacking and then learning,  that doesn’t mean he wants to spend an
“I was sorry to hear about his passing away.” And Harry really is, as far as he was concerned, spending his remaining lifetime in prison was a fitting punishment for Lucius Malfoy, he wouldn’t wish death on anybody.
Even as he keeps a lookout for his date, Harry slows down a little to enjoy the walk. It’s been a while since he’s managed to take some time out in the middle of the day to go for a stroll. The Department of International Magical Cooperation had really expanded after the War, setting up sub-departments to strengthen ties with magical communities across the globe. When Harry had joined the Forgien Relations team, it was just him and two others trying to set up some semblance of structure. As they’d started stationing diplomats in partnering countries, the staff size had grown tenfold and so had Harry’s workload.
