It was a comment that went over both Harry and Ron’s heads, but again Hermione found apropos. And it led into a discussion of England’s various colonies over the years that only reminded Harry of Draco perusing the bookstore shelves. The meal came to an end with Ron crying out that History of Magic had been more than dull enough, he certainly wasn’t going to start studying muggle history as they all cleared their trays and headed back to the lift.
“Tell me anyway.” Harry ran his fingers through Draco’s hair as strength dripped into his limbs. “Want to hear you say it.”
“He said it last night. He was so angry, and words just kept coming out of his mouth. And it terrified Malfoy.” Ron stopped. “I think Malfoy’s in love with him too. How does that even happen?”
Ron huffed, “Yeah, Mum had a field day with that. Thinking we’d have a double wedding. Had to set her down and have a chat about it.”
“You don’t look particularly happy to see me,” Harry said, catching the tension of the moment.
It was close to dinner time when Harry returned home. Malfoy wasn’t in the flat when he arrived, and for a brief moment Harry panicked. Where had he gone? Had Atkinson found him? Was he out wandering the streets in some bout of insanity? At least he couldn’t apparate.
They went to the register so Draco could pay for his book and then they stepped back out into the fresh air. “Who’s Winston Churchill?” Harry asked, having decided that was a fairly safe topic of conversation.
“Wait!” The girls followed him. “We just want to know if he’s as lovely as you make him out to be.”
“I know!” Draco shouted. “I went because I wanted to be there for you. You can’t be my whole world! I can’t just drop things on a whim because you ask! And I will want to.” He stopped suddenly, sucked in a huge, slow breath. “I think it’s better if we don’t do this anymore.”
Vale grinned widely. “Let’s just say, high enough that if we wanted we could wage war and win, quickly.”
“We can wash that stuff.” Harry gestured towards the bedding.
He laughed at that. “Can’t say your friend’s wrong. Although, it doesn't mean you can’t change.”
Draco sneered. “I’m not part of the Pack, you made that abundantly clear.” And Potter was honorable, even if Ajax didn’t know that yet.
He sat heavy on the bed, pulling Draco down into his lap and sucking a needy kiss to that juncture between his neck and shoulder. “Harry,” Draco whined.
“Christ Tilly, I can’t go.”
“You didn’t say anything?”
“I know.” Malfoy straightened up a little. “I know I am difficult and that I can’t answer your questions. I know I’ve asked too much from you. I wish I could explain.” He paused, took a deep breath, and then, for the first time since Harry had arrived home, looked Harry in the eye. “But I drank the tea.” He said it slowly, deliberately, and Harry suddenly remembered Malfoy’s direction the other morning.
“Shockingly, that doesn’t make me feel any better about this.” Ron ran his hands through his hair as the consequences started to dawn on him.
And Harry was exhausted, and not quite comprehending, but hadn’t he just explained all of this? Hadn’t he just told Ron that Draco lived in that bloody horrible lab? And, okay, maybe he’d left out some of the details from the last few weeks, but really, Harry didn’t think Ron wanted to know about that and it wasn’t important to the investigation.
Harry paused at the door and sent one last look back at Draco. He had curled in tightly on himself, tail tucked tightly against his body, and head resting just as closely. He looked--sad, and lonely, and Harry felt for him, didn’t want to close the door, the image pulled at memories of his own lonely childhood. But with a quiet, “Sorry,” he did.
And then he looked at the man sleeping in the bed next to him. He and Luc had been on again-off again for years now, and they had only recently started up again. While the sex was pleasant, Draco wasn’t sure if he was more than mildly interested.
She snatched his left hand and yanked it towards herself, flipping it palm up as she went. “What the fuck?” The both looked at where the blood and yellow bile had stained his shirt, leaving a perfect white oval in the middle. Tilly reached to the cuff, to pull it back.
“Okay.”
He took his meat laden sandwich to a park and ate in the sunshine. The salty crisps and pleasant weather improved his mood marginally, and Harry tried smiling when he returned to the office. But Fredrick then ran into a potted plant. So Harry switched to nodding, and then gave up altogether for fear of more injuries.
“You don’t think it was weird?”
Harry let out a long sigh. “Yeah, well, I’ve never--” For Merlin’s sake, it’s not like he hadn’t had sex before! “It’s just the first time with Ginny, and…” He trailed off. What if, when Harry looked at her he didn’t know what he wanted? What if that kind of stuff was different with girls than boys? What if Harry was too rough with her? Harry had
And then there was the creak on the stairs, too soft to have much weight, but a quick, darting sort of step, and Draco couldn’t help but feel just the littlest bit pleased. It was, of course, completely unacceptable for Teddy to be sneaking away from his party to come visit, but Draco couldn’t help the little spike of warmth in his chest.
Unconsciously, Harry stepped towards him. “Malfoy!” he shouted over the din.
Sophie waggled her shoulders and gripped the broom to sing into it. “I ain’t got cash, I ain’t got cash” she looked meaningfully at Draco, “I got you, baby!”
Harry jerked to look at him. “What do you mean?”
“Don’t worry, dear.” Molly patted Harry’s hand. “I know it took Ronnikins ages to find the right ring, but Ginny will love whatever you pick for her.”
Harry dithered for another moment, still caught in the urge to kiss Malfoy. The pub would be a nice escape from the flat, and it would be nice to see Gin and Hermione and Ron. But a part of him wanted to stay, to sit on the sofa next to Malfoy and put something stupid on the telly, to see where that might lead the evening.
“Come on.” Potter growled a bit.
Florence licked her ridiculous red lips. “I want you to brew for us again. We’re out, and--and--” She looked away again, twisted her head around so Draco could see the tendons in her neck. “We’ll pay. There’s others too. We’ll all pay.”
“You shouldn’t have.” Harry reached up and ran his fingers lightly across Draco’s jaw. “You didn’t even say goodbye.”
Malfoy was silent for a long moment. “I should leave. I thought--” He shook his head, hair falling in wisps about his ears. “but I was wrong.”
And Harry twisted his wrists, still pinned the wall above him. He wanted to be closer, wanted to catch Draco, to touch him and do some licking of his own. And he wanted to stay there, pinned to the wall, listening to the sounds Draco was making and feeling the weight of him. Harry might have whined a little.
Draco didn’t know what to say, and Neil dragged his thigh against him again, maddening and slow and somehow perfect. “Oh...” Draco squeezed his eyes shut.
A slight pressure on his shoulder, and Harry sank to his knees, hands at his side as Draco undid his own button and zip. As he pulled out his own cock, red and swollen and held it out towards Harry’s lips. And Harry didn’t wait, opened his mouth, one hand curled around the base and sucked Draco down. He watched, kept his eyes up on Malfoy’s face. It made it difficult to get the whole of Malfoy’s cock in his mouth, but Harry wanted to see every second, every flicker that crossed his face as he came. He tongued the slit, pumped his hand in time with his mouth, sucked and licked, and slowly Draco came undone.
Draco put down his spoon, no longer interested in eating. “Have the negotiations progressed so far?”
“But Pansy Parkinson,” Harry cried.
“You seem very interested in reading though.”
“Draco Malfoy, it is time for you to come home!” Harry shouted and then waited. “I’ll say it! I will shouted it right here, in the middle of fucking Chelsea at the top of my fucking lungs if you don’t get out here! I’m not joking! This is your final warning! The next sentence out of my mouth is gonna say it AND EVERYONE WILL HEAR, YOU WANKER!”
“I don’t want to talk about Atkinson right now.” Draco scowled and took several steps down the aisle. “What do you think about trying a new tea?”
“I can’t remember. The last thing I remember is getting dressed this morning!” Evan tried to suck in great gasps of air.
“It should be the day of the full moon,” Draco said suddenly. “If they view the memory, there will be questions about Pack and shifting and wolfsbane and hyssop. We can give a demonstration at sundown.”
“Petitioners Draco Malfoy and Faye, no sirname, are here to make arguments regarding the Werewolf Legislation Act.”
“Doesn’t matter.” Draco scowled.
“You don’t like anyone--” Draco broke off and looked at Sophie who was scrubbing down a table. “--like him.”
And Harry couldn’t help but line himself up and push hard and fast. Draco cried out and clenched tight around him, because he wasn’t loose, not quite enough, and he wasn’t wet, not quite enough. But Harry couldn’t wait to do things properly, and he bit down on Draco’s shoulder, and Draco shuddered, hands clawing desperately in his shirt and hips bucking wildly to get Harry to move faster and harder and deeper.
It helped, of course, that Draco was standing around outside the door just as he had for that very first meeting. And that she wasn’t asking for any names.
“Better than a dry scone and some weak tea.” Jude shrugged.
“You’re sure?”
Faye refused to be deterred. “Then I request to be recognized by the Court.”
Harry scooted out from under the blanket, turned on the nightlight, and left the door open a crack in case Andromeda wanted to check on him. He took the steps lightly to avoid any creaking and opened his door slowly for the same reason. His room might be an entire floor away, but Teddy had good hearing. The Friday night shift meant splinchings, drunken castings, and potion overdoses. It meant getting a little physical to keep the peace, and on one memorable occasion getting pissed on by a muggle. So Harry pulled on some old denims and a loose long sleeve shirt with no buttons. Because there was nothing like getting into a drunken brawl, having a bloke tear your shirt and then having to summon all the buttons while giggling girls made equally giggly passes.
Her cheeks and eyes were a bright red when she did.
With another crack, Hermione and Ginny left, and Evan said, “Tea?”
“Yes, I tried Parkinson’s and I went to his office.” Harry paced over to the kitchen door. “He’s not there.”
Harry hedged for a moment. “It’s the Unspeakable one,” he said at last. “So Malfoy stole something, right? But why? He didn’t have to serve time in Azkaban, just pay some fines and community service, which he did in the Department of Mysteries, which is a pretty prestigious place to work. Why would anyone put that at risk just to steal something?”
Hermione shook her head and tucked a curl behind her ear. “Thank you Harry, but I’m alright.”
“Here here!” Ron pounded his fist on the table.
There were grumbles around the table at Faye’s words, but then Vale, the one who had been angry with Hermione spoke. “There are benefits to us for doing this as well. As Draco would have said, if he were here, this is our chance to find the ones hunting us like dogs.”
Because Draco touched him sometimes now, let his fingers rest on top of Harry’s when they talked about Maddox wanting to get into Magical Games and his parents wanting him to help run the family store. He came out from behind the counter and sat on the stool next to Harry, letting their knees brush as Harry talked about June fighting with her father who was muggle and didn’t understand why she didn’t want to go to University like other kids her age.
Teddy let go of Draco’s hand and opened the front gate. “I found him!” He was so proud of himself.
Robards stood up, his chair banging into the wall behind his desk. He leaned over, pushing his face into Harry’s, and Harry realized that he had his clenched fists on Robards’s desk and was pushing into that space as well, challenging him. “Potter! That is enough! We find wolf pelts, not bodies, this case is one of vandalism until such a time as the Wizengamot declares Weres to be Beings during their shifts rather than Beasts. I understand your irritation at the minutiae of the law, but we are instruments of that law, the strong arm. And we must obey to the letter. So, until you come to me with the body of a murdered Werewolf, there is nothing that I can do.” Robards very specifically sat down and looked down at a pile of papers.
Draco didn’t know if Harry had woken up aching with the loss, but he had. It was a loss so similar to what he felt now, trapped between holding and interrogation, trapped between revealing secrets and an inability to save Harry, trapped between anger and longing. “If you can understand the difference between sex and making love, you might perhaps be able to understand my reluctance to discuss this particular moment,” Draco replied to Ron. “If you aren’t willing to share intimate moments with me, then why should I share mine with you.”
Harry shook his head, didn’t turn to look at Draco who was probably still visible, probably back to dancing with Handsy Bloke, hands in his hair and mouths so close they might as well have been touching. Harry swallowed. His stomach was back up where it belonged, but pitching and rolling, and he could almost taste the bile at the back of his throat. “Let’s go.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” She replied snidely, head tilting with every word.
He sucked in a breath. He needed to focus on his meeting with Nigal Barfour, on the chance he had been given, the possibility of an
She nodded and stepped towards Neil.
At the bar, he found a stool, and several ales later, a warm feeling in his belly radiated out towards his fingers. And the room was warm, and the people were warm, and the delightful little buzzing in his head made him giggle to himself. He rolled up his sleeves and signaled the bartender for another.
Draco’s steps stilled again. “Why?”
“Apparently, some low level security guards were the ones to sabotage your lab.”
Harry slouched in his seat at the pub absently spinning his phone on the table. Ron had suggested they go out with Dean and Neville since Neville was leaving for some trip on Friday, and Dean had an art exhibit opening up. So, they rescheduled their usual Friday night for a Thursday, this time at a muggle pub four blocks from the Ministry.
Harry started in his room, picking up all the laundry, changing the sheets, tucking that little box in the back of his sock drawer with the mismatched socks that he couldn’t quite bring himself to throw out. The room certainly looked--cleaner if not cheerier, without all the clutter on the floor. He pulled the duvet a little straighter, saw the Quidditch magazines peeking out from under the bed, and then utterly panicked.
She pointed at the table. “I brought coffee.”
“You better be careful with Gin. Who knows what Mum would be like if the two of them were pregnant.”
Halliwell led the way to the lifts, the Healers and remaining spectators quickly parting to let them pass. It was silent in the lift, crowded with the four of them. Harry put his hand on the scruff at Draco’s neck, kept running his fingers through the fur and thinking, don’t die don’t die, over and over. Alice had her nostrils flared, trying to get a better idea of what was happening.
Malfoy growled again, not angry, but low and heady. “There it is,” he said, face pressed so tightly to his shoulder that Malfoy’s nose was practically in Harry’s armpit. He ran his hands down the length of Harry’s arms, pushed them up over his head and ground himself fiercely against Harry.
“That’s enough!” The Healer’s voice rang through the room. “Mediwitch Halliwell, step away from that dangerous creature!”
“See, I can ‘elp you, Draco. I can make it better.”
The door chimed as Vale and Draco came in, their heads tilted at odd angles in laughter. Vale had his hand wrapped around Draco’s waist, and Draco’s was draped over his shoulder. Hermione glanced over at Harry, who had also looked up at the chime and was suddenly all smiles. He crossed the room immediately, and Draco let go of Vale to put his hand in Harry’s.
“Can you use it? Draco, use the magic.” She sounded panicked
Ginny said something to George about the Holyhead Harpies. “They’re the second oldest team in the league, that’s got to count for something.”
Draco turned. The bloke speaking smiled at him, green eyes bright, sly turn to his lips, long blond hair pulled up in a bun. He was shorter than Draco, but not by much, lean, like Draco too. And he looked at Draco as if he had just found a treasure and was waiting for the right moment to steal it.
and the rum to do much more than point down the hall, and Draco had to untangle himself from where Neil had draped his leg over Draco’s thigh. The loo was back down the hall, towards Paul’s room, and Draco peeked his head in the open door. Tilly, Evan, Paul and some girl Draco didn’t know were all crowded around a computer screen watching some video.
As soon as he couldn’t see Malfoy, he had doubts about this plan. Last time he had done this, the relief had been short lived and quickly replaced by loneliness.
Harry was filling out paperwork when Draco approached his office. Ron was still out with the flu, but Hermione insisted he was on the mend and would be returning tomorrow. Harry could hear Malfoy out in the hall, laboring just a little underneath at least three bags. Harry sighed and shook his head. It was bad enough he was stuck on desk duty while Ron was recovering. Did that misery also have to be compounded by escorting Malfoy across the Ministry every day?
Draco couldn’t tear his eyes away. And still the fires burned and the people ran. It was like a wizarding photograph, with the same scenes repeating again and again, although Muggles had found a way to do it for longer stretches of time. And then they’d show the ships again, hanging ominously above the island like rotten fruit.
surreal,” Malfoy agreed.
“I’m good looking!” Ron insists.
“Hermione—” Weasley pleaded.
, and the other Muggle Immersion professor. Gryffindor recklessness obviously ran in the Evans family, Draco surmised.
He flipped the blankets back and put Al inside, Malfoy following with Scorpius. They tucked them in tight together and Harry scratched Ms Danger’s invisible ears. Then he vanished the sweets wrappers and took the remainder of their hauls to hide on the top shelf in the sitting room.
“Just a minute,” he finally said. “We’re just finishing this up.”
“You can thank my mother, Potter. She taught me everything I know. Now if you’ll excuse me. I have a scavenger hunt to finish so that I can continue translating the boring and obvious clues to your sodding heart.” He retrieved a piece of parchment spellotaped to the bottom of the caterpillar’s bowl and waggled it at Harry before stalking off.
“I know,” Harry said, letting out a huge breath. Sometimes, it was hard to reconcile the man Dudley was today with the boy he’d been. “He really is…Do you think we should contact my aunt and tell her?”
“Oh, sure,” he said. And then, to be a good conversationalist, “But you had a good time?”

to die.”
, as it had been for days now. She didn’t look afraid or repulsed. She looked—almost nostalgic.
Luna is unconcerned. “We could possibly have the diffusers blow up from the floor—like a mysterious mist. In fact, that might work better, as the Amortentia won’t have as far to travel to reach the audience.”
“Nor will one do you any good if you’re off your face,” Millicent added.
he didn’t say.
Harry watched Malfoy look around the room, saw it when realisation appeared on his face.
disabling my wards? You do realise that kneazles are supposed to help their masters
“You want to grab some lunch?” Harry asked, eyes still on Draco.
“I would—” Malfoy stopped abruptly. “Actually, yes, it would be a great idea. They’re looking for two men and a woman, so Potter, you and I will Glamour into women and Millicent will—”
She shifts in her chair, pulling both her feet up beneath her bum. She regards him. “Draco has family in Beirut,” she says.
“I curled up on my bed, but I was too wound up to sleep. When I’m tired and I can’t sleep, for whatever reason—I think about sex. It gives me something familiar and relaxing to focus on, like counting werewolves, and if I—don’t take it too far—I can fall asleep.”
Draco turned abruptly away from the window, suddenly and desperately wishing he were still out there, a free wizard. The only time he’d ever been truly free in his life.
Harry rolled his eyes but in truth he didn’t mind. He really didn’t mind too much when he was with Draco. Even when they fought, which happened surprisingly rarely (perhaps it was a Hufflepuff thing) Harry liked being around him. Draco led him to the top of a hill beyond the Shrieking Shack and, finally, stopped at the top.
, he remembered.
“Definitely not.” He stared down at his books, cursing himself for being such an idiot. There was nothing wrong with being an Auror. It was the sort of thing he did. He could be good at it. It could be
She eyed Harry again, and he swallowed despite himself, seeing the resemblance again.
The fourth time was indeed the last one. The liquid condensed at the top of the alembic was purer even than distilled water, and a thousand times more precious. Harry separated the shimmering gold-wine sludge of impurities from the crystal clear pure solution and the blood-red stone still sitting at the bottom of the cauldron.
The door opened and Draco stuck his head in. His eyes slid to Snape and back to Harry. “You’re late, Potter. You were supposed to meet me twenty minutes ago.”
Padma dropped Harry, Hermione, and Lee off at their Airbnb, and the three of them went inside without a word. Hermione set up shop with her laptop and Wikipedia in front of Netflix. Lee took the kitchen table. Harry could’ve joined either of them, but he was feeling raw, as though his guts were spread open for anyone to see if they looked. He couldn’t stand to have them look at him right now, so he went upstairs to his room.
“I said I didn’t
, and never let him go?”
“Where is that fucking thing…” Potter muttered, as he destroyed his rooms.
Harry raised his eyebrows. Hermione, Lee, and Padma looked insulted.
“We still don’t know how to create that change, though,” said Draco. “And I don’t fancy the idea of you drinking Poison in order to find out.”
“I wouldn’t trouble her with that,” Harry said. “Maybe just cast Fiendfyre on the glass to Separate out the common parts.” As soon as he said it, he stiffened. “Sorry, I—”
The guards conferred with the Queen, who nodded, and one came over to fiddle with Dudley’s phone, tapped it with a small dagger, saying a few unintelligible words. Dudley took it back, tapped on the screen, and grinned.
Severus knew more than he was letting on, and wanted to wring it out of him; relieved because Draco was certain both his and Potter’s faces screamed ‘We wanked each other off last night!’ and he didn’t want to have to listen to it from Severus.
Harry snorted.
Harry spent most of the instructions checking out the other fit beachgoers, but immediately perked up when Luna said, “The sand sculptures must represent not what’s most important to Harry, but what’s most important to
Millicent. I’m Malfoy’s
On that, Harry had to agree. He watched Malfoy’s repressed, excited mannerisms as they talked, and felt a deep longing build inside him. The two of them, they could change, too, he thought. The ingredients were there. Perhaps the foundation was forming. He just didn’t yet know the recipe.
Fortunately, Hermione brought over adorably shy and comfortably-freckled Dune then, and Harry didn’t have to talk to Malfoy again. Dune was a good conversationalist, if rather blushy. Harry was charmed by his smile and then by his flexibility when he demonstrated what happened after being forced into ballet during developmental years.
At first, nothing happened. It wasn’t until the flame turned blue-hot that the explosion occurred. It rushed outwards and slammed into the wards like a bright wall of fire and reaction. The wards were acutely outlined by fire pressing at them on all sides, pushing steadily outwards, with no sign of retracting.
“Yes, well, I’ve been studying it at work,” Hermione said stiffly, and Harry knew he’d annoyed her. She pointed to the top. “DNA is something that wizards still don’t bother to understand, but as you can see, it’s very interesting indeed. In fact, here is her twenty-fourth chromosome pair, Chromosome zero. That’s her magic.” She beamed at Harry, the very picture of a proud mother.
Then he began to sweat a bit while he waited to see if Scorpius would ask any follow-ups, but Scorpius only eyed him, shrugged, and pulled out a Chocolate Frog from his play robes. Draco, too stunned by this expert hiding and less expert reveal, let him get halfway through the Frog before he managed to gather himself and tell him to wait until tea time.
And why was he so scared?
They chattered on as they lined Teddy and his things up to be Apparated, and then they popped out. To Harry, it was the strangest feeling of both an outing with his family and group Apparition with a stranger.
Cautiously, Draco lifted the lid. Inside, there was a generous application of wizarding space, and the box had been filled with dozens of Muggle items of varying sizes.
Harry ordered the coconut short-ribs with groundnuts, but Draco ordered the lamb-cassava risotto and when their food came out, he desperately wanted to try some. Fortunately, Hermione also ordered it, so he just took some from her plate. She rolled her eyes and stole one of his groundnuts in return. Neither of them were interested in Ron’s sundried tomato thing.
—and that’s life…life with
They play until the setting sun becomes civil twilight, and still no Aurors. It’s got to be fate that when Harry lays down ‘What’s that sound?’ they both hear a click. Harry tenses immediately. He knows that click. Behind him, he sees Shaadhon running, panicked, towards them.
“God, you’re heavy,” Harry mutters at the tenth step.
Malfoy gave him a narrow look. “Potter, shut up. It’s entirely possible. Most people think you’re useless already.”
“We brought presents,” she said, levitating a stack of brightly wrapped gifts over to the Christmas tree by the window. “Under the tree?”
They didn’t have to take votes in Hufflepuff. Things were decided largely democratically and entirely without ayes or nays. They could just look at one another, every one of them scanning the faces of the rest of the group, and understand. No one loved this idea, but no one had a better one, and they all knew that they were short on something very precious: time. They took vote without a word, and Harry knew what it would be before it was even announced.
“Focus on me, Harry,” Draco said. “Clear your mind of everything else.”
“Can I help?” asked Rosie.
“Coming?”
At one-hundred, he paused, and attempted to steady his breathing. “What are you doing?” he whispered.
Dexter Loupe.”
Everything was true except for one little lie: “I can’t wait to take him on a date without the cameras.”
Draco poured him another glass as the water heated up. “Don’t watch it,” he said. “It’ll never boil.”
“What the fuck is glonde?” asks the model.
It’s just that Harry’s never been the type to get lonely. He doesn’t miss people. But sometimes, he misses Draco. The annoying twat. He shrugs it off and slaps down another card. It explodes.
fate, then?”
Lee and Malfoy both wore dour looks. Narcissa finally took a cautious, if elegant, bite of her noodles.
“Saturday next.”
“Same,” said Harry.
He couldn’t say goodbye. He’d changed his mind—if he saw Scorpius, said goodbye, it would make all of this too final. He had to be optimistic. He had a plan to stay out of Azkaban after breaking the Statute of Secrecy, but he couldn’t account for every variable. They had to be able to adapt.
She gave him a cautious look. “Can you?”
, Harry understood where the confusion came from. Magical weddings didn’t have themes like Muggle ones did. There weren’t any colour palettes, no venue viewings, no caterers to choose from. Everything in the wizarding world, so far, was homegrown. Families brought out the good china and steam cleaned the carpets in their manor houses.
She clucked again.
Harry shrugs. “Just thought you might’ve, I don’t know, experimented.”
Draco smirked. “No, your hair’s fine now that it has some length to it. Your face on the other hand…”
Draco rubbed his thumb along the back of Harry’s hand. “Now I won’t have to. And neither will you.”
No one calls him Potter anymore. He made the mistake of wanting to separate himself from the Boy Who Lived when he started his first line, so he’d opened his fashion house under only the name ‘Harry’. Now everyone calls him Harry. Sometimes Mr Harry if they’re especially socially awkward. No one calls him Potter. Except Malfoy.
“Yeah,” he said, "But I don't really know if I could do a better job even now."
“Ron will be an exceptional Auror,” Hermione decided. “He’s very good at constant
. The cat seemed to bristle for a second, but then it turned away, and curled up on the floor of the pen. Harry’s brow furrowed. Could cats be dejected?
“I can do anything I want.”
“Agreed,” said Lee. “Never wanna do that again.”
Given Malfoy now being on staff, tinnitus was really the limit.
Severus himself wasn’t there, which both relieved and frustrated Draco. Frustrated because he was
reprimanded for them refusing to speak to us about the case — was the only reason you were a more literal cocksucker afterwards! If you needed the excuse of annoyed goblins to act on your interest in me, then you’re a shit Gryffindor.”
interviews. I’d wager that’ll get you down to a card at Christmas and birthdays.”
Harry’s a good Auror. He wasn’t promoted for nothing. But he works better when Malfoy’s with him. He works
It would be boring.
At the front of the room, Theo and Padma stood facing one another. They summoned a golden Protego to encircle them and took hold of the ends of the other’s wand with their free hand, creating a circle of power between them.
to get him back…
They followed Malfoy’s parents down a cobbled path that came to a cul-de-sac at the edge of a steep hill. There was enough light left for Harry to look down and see the White Horse of Wiltshire directly below them. And just beyond that, larger than anything Harry’d ever seen: a geometric shape, like a flower of life, pressed into the wheat below.
be after Voldemort?), but…Lockhart? He narrows her eyes and Demelza rolls hers in response.
Harry rolled his eyes, tossed a little wave at the others, and tagged along after Draco out of the Great Hall. They didn’t immediately go to Hogsmeade, but first diverted down to the Sett so Draco could drop off his things. Harry waited for him by the oak tapestry, tracing his name with his eyes.
around all twenty-two of them.
“And with him, we’ll want our Modern Languages and History teaching pairs, along with Professors Vector and Babbling. Professors Croaker and Goldstein, if the two of you could also attend tomorrow’s emergency meeting with the ICW in case any Theory or Mysticism expertise is required.”
“Can’t you help, too?” says Ron and when he looks at Harry, Harry sees that the mania’s still there. His eyes are sybil-blue and maybe he does have some seer in him. He was always grand at making up homework for Divinations, and didn’t he just predict who Hermione had gotten herself bonded to?
“I guess you can still cheat on someone even if you’re in love with them,” Draco finally says.
into human sacrifice now, Professor? Do you feel any different?”
Over November, the Hufflepuffs did dozens more landfills. At least one a night, and often two or three if the spaces were small enough or the chemicals few enough.
“All right, Potter,” Draco said, still eyeing Boot warily. “Let’s see if that hideous scar of yours can get us a table at Incendio.”
“No, not enough bedrooms. We got them a similar Airbnb nearby. They’re arriving tomorrow.”
Malfoy grinned. “Because no one knows how to rile you up like I do.”
Harry tuned them out once they started getting into the finer points of macronutrients, as he did not care. He was feeling a little queasy from the Portkey and they still had two stops to go before they landed in Atlantis. He was usually fine on Portkeys; what was wrong with him today?
Harry erected a muffling charm over their table, and settled in to listen to Millicent question Hermione about her abandoned Animagus form. It was at the point when Hermione was describing the degree of stripe delineation along her form’s right flank that the feeling of warmth returned to Harry’s calf. He stilled, looked up from beneath his lashes. Draco was staring back at him, expression still.
Ron did manage to see them to the station on the day they were to return to Hogwarts. He’d apologized, and felt ruddy awful about hurting Hermione’s feelings, and she’d accepted it, as she always did.
Ten minutes later, they’d decided that Harry was just going to have to open at account at the bank.
He swallowed his own, and they jumped in.
It used to be that when Draco spoke, the whole room lit up, every synapse in Harry’s brain sparking like fireworks. But this room is still dark. Harry clenches his fists at his side, mute with fury and hurt. He is acutely aware of both how little he means to Draco right now and how much he
“What happened?” he whispers, and he knows it’s stupid, fruitless. As impotent as he is himself. If Ron were here, he’d know what to do. Best healing spells on the force, Ron has; it’s how he got promoted so fast. Harry waves his wand slowly above her, running diagnostic after diagnostic. Everything comes back
The Council in question shifted, unhappy, but nodded.
Harry really had no idea what was going on in the Room of Requirement, and he did not relish being the person who found out. His ear had begun to ring as he remembered the last time he’d been in there.
His distress over the lack of his fantasy league buddy was, frankly, endearing. It made Harry feel warm. “You’re in a league? I’ll go in.”
“So—what the hell are we going to do?”
“Not likely,” Millicent called from several seats down, having—somehow—heard through Potter’s privacy spell. Draco smirked. That was just like her.
“I suspect we’ll never break him of that habit, love,” Hermione replied. “I’m very proud of you for continuing to uphold your personal values. You can help me order around the caterers.” Rosie glowed with pride.
of helping them!”
Libertas stared dourly up at them from beneath straight black hair. “Hello.”
Lee’s expression morphed again. “Harry, give me the damn potion, you wanker.”
Harry rolled over, tossing both an arm and a leg over Draco’s body and completely disregarding any silly notions of ‘personal space’. He sighed happily. “Let’s do it again some time.”
“The twenty minutes I’ve seen of it is,” Harry said.
Malfoy scowled. “No.”
. Harry has no idea what it’s about, but they’re laughing,
Harry did not beam at him because that would be overstepping. Instead he said, “Brill. See you then, mate.”
Draco rang off as they crossed the Mall. “He’s coming down now,” he said. “Apparently there’s an Inter-city Apparition point just inside the Smithsonian Castle.”
“My father wanted me in Durmstrang,” said Malfoy.
“What time is it?”
“I’m allergic to you,” Draco muttered. He looked desperately around and his eyes landed on a truck two spaces down. “I want that one instead. Crêpes are always safe.”
“I despise you,” Harry mutters, without heat. Then, to himself, he adds: “How did this happen to me? I’m a
rather a big dick,” Harry observed.
Another customer came in, and he turned to help him. Harry moved his chair around to face Millicent and Malfoy.
“It’s an instinctual response,” Eloise said. “We saw a fellow badger in danger, and we closed in to protect him.”
“I know,” Harry said. “But I’m still benefitting from it.”
“Sponsors,” called Alick. “Bring forward your initiates.”
His wand buzzed. Very carefully, he resumed stirring—clockwise on odd numbers, anticlockwise on evens. Draco’s voice had dropped in pitch and the numbers one through one hundred took on new, erotic connotations in Harry’s mind.
He flicked his hand out and summoned two glasses of pumpkin-cranberry punch for them, and Malfoy’s eyes followed the movement as if he’d never seen anything like it. But he and Harry had never been friends before so of course he’d never seen Harry do something nice for him. Unless one counted saving his life. Harry really didn’t. That was just something the old-him did, like a hobby.
He will go through with this, and he will
“Honestly, I’m terrified of removing my robe,” Harry said.
Harry stared at the soup. “This is considered breakfast?”
“The books all said that when I reach the visualisation stage, I’ll be calm and prepared for change.”
“I don’t think we’re getting anywhere else tonight.” Draco sighed, raising his head from an obscure potions book and rolling his neck. “I’ve got nothing. It’s still too big an area to clean. Even their Mer neighbourhood is too big. Shall we head up and join the rest of them outside?”
The next night, they were in Inverness, and it was bloody freezing. The ritual went quicker this night, but they felt even more drained than the night before. Professor Sprout passed out chocolates in class instead of points for good answers the next day.
Malfoy of course had no idea what he was talking about, but it seemed to get his attention anyway. “How far did you get?”
Draco turns to him sharply, Hermione more considered. “Why would we want to drag more people into this nightmare?”
Their voices rose up from the centre of the semicircle. Alick and Emily’s joined hands started to glow. The rest of them picked up the spell and the glow shot down their line, a wave of clasped hands lighting up. They sang the spell several rounds through, their hands glowing brighter and brighter. Harry was beginning to dread that it wouldn’t work, that they’d have done all of this for nothing, but then something happened.
He lounged back against the painted stone wall to wait. The yellow-white paint was chipping in places. There were names scratched into it in some places. Not a legacy Harry was keen to join. Around midnight, UK time, he clocked that no one was going to do anything about him until morning. He pulled the thin blanket loose from its hospital tucks and got in.
“Gudreegza!” Teddy exclaimed. “Et Gobbledegook!”
“Good luck securing a permit,” he said. “I heard from Croaker the Ministry’s restricting all non-essential travel after this week’s travesty.”
He turned the corner to the kitchen, already apologising, “Andromeda, I’m so sorry, I overslept—” And stopped dead in his tracks.
His door opened as he was finishing the last of his tea—still perfectly hot because Kreacher was nothing if not a fantastic cook. He craned his neck to look, but there was no one there.
“Obviously,” Snape said. Harry heard his robes shifting. “Draco—you will make sure that Potter wears all of the safety gear?”
Malfoy doesn’t need to be a Veela to have allure over Harry, but Harry will keep pretending that he does, because the only other option is that Harry’s been in love with him for seven years all on his own. It’s like Amortentia whenever he’s around, and Harry is happy to breathe it in.
But seeing them all spread out here, Harry knows the moment Draco gets it.
A car horn beeped outside. Hermione grabbed her handbag and a crate. “That’ll be Padma and Blaise. Wow, these are really heavy. We should probably avoid a weightless spell—if we can’t see them to uncast them, we may miss some and they’ll float to the surface.”
“Proposing,” Neville reminded Draco.
. The words were barely audible and completely unintelligible to Harry’s ears, but Malfoy sounded composed and confident. He’d done this spell before—certainly not on this scale, but at least to his mother’s Dalmatians or his friends. Harry felt the magic rising, felt his own drawing forth in response to an unheard call. It swirled through his body, down his arms, and into Malfoy’s own.
from his bag, and did his best to be useful. There was a chapter on how fire intensified magical spells, and an appendix with a cool spell that could put out fires by separating the elements. That one might be fun to try in the reverse if he ever went camping again, which would be never. He read through a few more pages, into the chapter on physics, and became engrossed in a discussion on how banishing and vanishing spells worked within it.
Snape rolled his eyes. “Gryffindors and Slytherins. Merlin help us.”
“So I’m the one for you, right?” Malfoy said, grinning. “Going to pick me?”
“I do,” Harry admits. He reaches down and pulls at his prick a few times, unable to help himself even if he wanted to. Malfoy bats his hand away. “
Harry shot him a look. “
But of course, Malfoy apparently only heard a fraction of what he said. “What do you mean you’re flexible?” he demanded.
“To the Mers, fuckface. And don’t ‘to whom’ me like you’re fucking Granger. We have a job to do and I won’t sit here listening to you play at proper English when you could be doing something useful like cleaning the fucking water.”
“There’s no shame in failure,” Draco said then. “We’ll write about the experience, but we’ll show that we failed at the first step, instead.”
Harry huffed. “My notes are in my room. I’ll be right back.”
Let it never be said (by Minerva) that Harry wasn’t at least
“It is magic,” she said. “When they made us, we were meant to correct their race’s defects so they might integrate with us and live on this earth, instead of aboard their starships, as they had done for thousands of years.
“Now, as we approach the last days of Yule term, I remind you all, once again, of the necessity of maintaining your studies during the holiday. It wasn’t all that long ago that apprentices weren’t allowed to leave their masters and mistresses for more than a day at a time, in order to ensure maximum knowledge retention. Don’t make me regret the leniency that Hogwarts extends you, in the name of holiday goodwill.”
“For all I know, you don’t even have a secret. You’re just going to pretend you have one for ten years and then tell me it was all a laugh over a pint one day.”
“Winter kids, huh?” said Harry. “Luna says winter children are more independent.”
Ron’s face is grim. “Got a lead on those files you sent me,” he says. “You got a map of the area?”
Neither of them made mention of the fact that they were likely to end up there without their magic. Not that it would make much of a difference in gaol.
“That’s so fucked,” Harry decided. “I think if I’d been you, I would have rounded up my Mum and moved to America. Or Chile, maybe. Voldemort probably would’ve ignored countries that didn’t speak English.”
The best part of not being able to speak is that he doesn’t have to make appreciative noises in regards to Ron’s spaghetti tonight. Of course, it leaves Hermione to take the brunt of the ‘So how is its?’ but Harry has never claimed to be a good friend, so he just sits back and smirks at her when Ron’s not looking.
“I know,” said Hermione. She read through her own checklist, finger skimming the paper as she went down. “You and I will arrive at three on the thirty-first and start in on the colour theme charms. Oh, and here’s a copy of the event timeline for you. Be sure to double check those firework and noise permits we secured from the Department of Community Affairs.”
“It fell that day, and the Creators saw our truth, saw that magic had proliferated so that almost half of our youth had it and it would be even more within a few generations. They sailed in from the stars and began eliminating those with magic.”
“Are you not fighting to return home, darling?” said Narcissa, carefully settling a new wrap of noodles around her fork. “To win, you must defeat your enemy. To defeat your enemy, you must know your enemy.”
“I love explosions,” Justin explained. “In this case, I think one might actually be useful. We could… hmm, wait a tic. No, never mind,” he said, deflating. “We can’t explode landfills. It might hurt Muggles.”
stone.”
Harry writes.
“Breeders,” said Narcissa, shortly. She rattled off something else in Mandarin, got a response, and said, “They use Muggles to reproduce—males to impregnate their females, females to carry their males’ children. They’re correcting their race with ours.”
He wished he was taking Albus trick-or-treating this year like he usually did, but he was grateful Gin and Luna were willing to do it instead, even though he’d not told them any details about why he needed the night off this year.
“What, exactly, is entailed by ‘enthusiasm’?” Harry asked, not unreasonably in his opinion.
Gryffindors saved the people who needed it. But Draco didn’t need Harry to save him anymore, so he would just have to help save the world. Because Draco was in it.
“I was just thinking,” said Harry. He swerved to avoid a sweaty Muggle in a suit passing in the opposite direction. “Why did you sell me litmus strips?”
“Me too,” Harry said.
Draco,
The apartment was lit with fairy lights that definitely weren't there a few hours ago. Draco toed off his shoes and placed his coat on the rack next to the door. There was a mug of hot chocolate on the kitchen counter and as Draco brought it to his lips, he realized it had been sitting there for a while, judging by its temperature.
“I’m alright,” Draco says, but as soon as he speaks, Harry can smell the alcohol on his breath.
He’s wearing Harry’s favorite jacket. Draco has his hands deep in the pockets of the warm dragonhide. The jacket somehow makes his outfit 100x sexier. The dragonhide pairs well with his tight fitting trousers and his crisp white shirt. It’s large size hangs down Draco’s sharp shoulders and thin frame like a cascading waterfall. The black contrasts with his porcelain white skin, making him look paler than usual. The sight is enough to turn Harry on.
“Mmm. Happy Christmas,” Harry said, pushing himself up and rubbing his eyes.
The clock reads 1:23 am when Harry jolts awake. He’s sweating and shaking. He looks around and comes face to face with Draco who is leaning over him in concern.
------
------
For some reason though, he can’t think of his address. He can’t think, period. He just stands in the fireplace with a fist full of powder in one hand and his jacket in the other. When he looks down at his hand though, it’s not his jacket his holding. It’s Harry’s. The soft dragonhide feels like silk in his fingers. ‘He must’ve forgotten it on his way home,’ he thinks. He caresses the hem of the jacket before gently slipping it on himself. He can remember the first time he wore it 2 years ago. On his first date with Harry, Draco had “forgotten” a coat and Harry, being Harry, had wrapped the warm material around Draco’s lean figure. It had become his favorite item in the 1 year that they were lovers.
-------
“I love you too.”
“Yes, I suppose so,” Draco says. He drops the floo powder back and steps further into Harry’s living room. “Are you going to lend me some clothes?” he asks.
Pansy sees Draco’s gaze lingering on the door, lost in thought. “You should go, darling,” she says.
He quickly exits the stage as the minister walks up to the mic. Hermione stops him as he beelines for the door. “Where are you going?” she asks, clear worry in her voice.
“I’m going to prepare slowly. Then bury myself in you. Take you slow. I want you to know how much you mean to me,” Draco said. He tugged Harry’s pants down and threw them somewhere in the room. He reached over to his bedside drawer and pulled out a bottle of lube.
Draco leaned down and kissed Harry then began thrusting into him with ernest. He fucked Harry slowly as promised. He wanted Harry to feel loved, deeply and truly. He didn’t want to rush this. He had been waiting a long time for this moment and wanted to make it worthwhile.
Harry presses a kiss to Draco’s hair. “Sleep,” he says. Draco does just that.
Draco walked down the familiar neighborhood to his apartment. When he got there, he was forced to whisper a small charm to unlock his door because his hands were full of presents. The door opened to a small living room with matching cream sofas and a dark coffee table. He immediately spotted the letter sitting on his table and placed the packages down on the sofas.
“Okay,” Draco says, but he doesn’t move away.
When Draco comes, it’s with Harry’s name on his lips. His nails dig into Harry’s back and his back arches beautifully. He throat is exposed and Harry can admire the deep marks that he’s sucked into Draco’s skins. The warm cum coats Harry’s hand and chest.
------
Harry’s muscles tightened and his breath hitched, and he came between Draco’s and his chest. Draco moaned into Harry’s neck and felt himself release into Harry after his own. Harry shook underneath him with aftershocks and Draco laid his body on Harry’s, bringing his arms protectively around him and holding him close. Finally they stilled and they laid in the dark, panting softly. Harry murmured a cleaning charm that made Draco shiver. Harry readjusted them and pulled the blankets over their bodies.
Draco shakes his head. “Hungry,” he says.
“Don’t say that because I’ll never be out of your hair,” Draco sighs dramatically.
Draco stirs gently and turns around to face Harry. “I was busy,” he mumbles, pressing his nose to Harry’s chest.
Draco wakes up at 2 to use the bathroom. The pressure on his bladder is uncomfortable after a night of drinking so much. He untangles himself from Harry, careful not to wake him up, then walks over to the bathroom.
Harry runs his hand down Draco’s chest. He traces the scar he placed there all those years ago and whispers an apology against Draco’s mouth. Then he moves his hand down to Draco’s naval and slides it under Draco’s waistband to cup his heavy length. Draco let’s out a groan and ruts as Harry begins pressing his hand firmly into him.
“I love you too, Draco.”
Harry tugs on Draco’s shirt, breaking their kiss briefly to pull it above his head. Then he does the same with his own shirt. When they’re skin to skin, Draco lets out a soft sound and continues to kiss him.
“I’m an adult, ’ll be fine!” he shouts and before they can stop him, he walks out of the room, ignoring all the looks he’s getting from his sudden outburst. He almost falls a couple times as he makes his way to the floo but he doesn’t stop. He rips his jacket off the coat rack and steps into the floo with a handful of power.
Sure, Draco got things in order. Reestablished himself. Opened a small apothecary. Bought a flat in muggle London. Created new relationships with old enemies. But he still longed for Harry.
Harry’s own cock is straining against his sweatpants but his focus is solely on Draco. He pushes Draco’s pants down to uncover his member and begins stroking him.
“Oh? With what?” Harry says.
“That’s why I can’t sleep. I see you in my dreams,” he pauses, “and in my nightmares.”
Tonight marks the 6th anniversary since the war. Harry fixes the cuffs of his shirt while listening to Hermione’s speech on equal rights for witches. He’s standing on the sidelines of the slightly elevated stage in the elegant ballroom the ministry has rented out for the night. It’s the annual war anniversary gala which, over the years, has turned into an event where charity heads and philanthropists mingle.  Like always, his speech is last, right after Hermione’s.
“I’m going to use the bathroom. Brush my teeth and all. You’re welcome to use it after me,” Harry says. Draco replies with a sound of agreement and sits on the bed as Harry walks into the ensuite bathroom.
He lays down where they are and drags Harry down with him. Harry lies down and Draco rests his head against Harry’s chest. They fall asleep to each other’s breathing.
Draco doesn’t know what he means but ‘this’ but he nods. He wants whatever Harry can give. This seems to relax Harry too and they walk into the room.
Draco was all smiles again. “Good!” he said. “Would you pass me the pumpkin juice? I wanted to get your opinion on the assignment Slughorn gave us. Did you notice anything peculiar about it?”
“None,” said Neville. The others agreed.
“That is—quite a theory, Unspeakable Potter,” Apex says.
“I was thinking it before but then completely forgot about it with all of the other… confusion. Regression analysis will show us which chemicals are correlated to magical absorption. We can use magical artefacts with built-in spellwork instead of casting spells on the samples in order to get them to react.”
Padma smiled. “And you’ve met Theo Nott, my fiancé,” she said. He and Nott nodded, which caused Padma to smile even more. “Wonderful! So! I’m really excited about all of this. When Hermione told me she was starting a wedding planning business, I was all over it. I’d already started worrying about how Theo and I were going to plan all those damned Struggles with our caseloads, and the wedding on top of that! Shiva help me, I thought! And look, he did!”
“Help me,” he said.
“If it was easy, don’t you think every second degree Alchemist in the world would have made one by now?” Harry said. “I know this is right.”
“Well,” said Hermione, at breakfast. She served herself some eggs, exchanged polite words with Neville and Luna further down the table. “Well.”
“Sorry, did you say nine hundred?” asked Potter.
“Severus has told me much about the world since my people and I left it,” Sostrate said, leading them in. Her black hair was braided down her back, nearly reaching her hips, and her robes were the same clean, burgundy linen as the first time they’d come.
Harry smirked. “It's ingrained now. Just accept it,” he said.
The living room door opened and Ron stuck his head back in. “Hermione!” he said.
Harry hopped into the shower, sighing happily at the scalding hot spray. It warmed him through and he felt, finally, able to face the day. Facing days was something he was finding more and more difficult.
She pulled out a jar with holes spelled into the top. There was a terrifying, hairy motherfucker in the jar, little legs trying to reach through the air holes.
Harry bumped his shoulder to Draco’s. “You didn’t hate me last night. In fact, you—”
He trailed off, biting his lip and angrily mouthing words as he wrote. Harry couldn’t help smiling at it. He forgot to return to his book, and ended up watching Malfoy write the entire letter to his relatives in Massachusetts. He felt himself studying the sharp point of Malfoy’s jaw, and how his lip went white when he bit it, but immediately filled with colour again when he let go to mutter more disparaging words for his American cousin.
At the beginning of December, Hermione and Millicent left for Australia. Peep and Crookshanks were left behind, in Draco and Harry’s respective cares, which sucked since, of course, they were always in Harry’s rooms playing some weird cat game with Severia whenever he returned from the lab. He really had no idea how everyone was getting past his wards. Severia was a squib and therefore couldn’t—
to expose the magical world?”
Indeed, there were a number of purple squares that were out of place, making the unicorn look more like a manticore with purple spots floating around it. Harry glanced at Draco, who’d taken on a thoughtful look, and stood to take a closer look at the paper. After a few moments, he pulled it off the refrigerator and said, “Teddy, could I borrow this for a couple days? I want to show it to Ms Sephora at work.”
“I think he’s
come out with this ‘losing your magic’ shit! Honestly, Harry, I really feel like going on telly and doing magic for every single Muggle in the world, reliving our seventh year in a tent, and then giving away your magic is something you should’ve, oh, I don’t know, mentioned to us first!”
The guests started arriving at a quarter to six, and Harry’s eyes stayed glued to the door. Finally, Draco entered, escorting Millicent again, and Harry wasted no time in sidling over to him. Draco seemed to sense him even before he wound his way through half the guests, for their eyes met and locked over Parvati’s son’s head.
Reluctantly, Draco agreed.
Why this wasn’t a done deal was quite beyond Harry. Hermione didn’t have any other support, and apprentices didn’t receive any stipend beyond room, board, and ten galleons a month. Barely enough for necessities. She needed it.
Harry huffed. “Yes, Professor.”
. Somehow, despite their never-ending arguments while dating—and sometimes, Harry cringed to remember the particular nights at Grimmauld Place: during sex—their breakup had been swift, clean, and with minimal crying (all on Ron’s part).
Harry settled in for another round of distillation. It was close. So close. It might be the final round, he reckoned. This time, when he sat down next to Draco, Draco’s hand slid into his, and their fingers interlaced. Harry’s breath hitched; he said nothing, and they watched the steam rising through the still and condensing at the top. Their essences were mingled together somewhere in that steam, and Harry didn’t know how to handle that. He was currently blocking out everything that had been said today, on account that he didn’t think he would be able to get through this process if he didn’t.
The discussion started very politely, very earnestly, very—in Harry’s opinion—reasonably.
“You once came into work with a broken femur,” Ron points out.
Luna finally looks back down at him, blinking as her eyes adjust from having stared straight into a row of
“It isn’t legal, for the record,” said Gawain, who was perhaps just ten years Ron’s senior. “Blackmail, that is. Asking a man to serve his country is totally fine.”
“Anyway, Mother says she’s willing to host Christmas again this year, but you have to host New Year’s. I expect she’ll tell you herself when she gets here, but I just want it noted that I did my duty as son and delivered the message.”
“What the fuck
Ron'd come home from a particularly bad case not long after making full Auror, covered in the blood and other stuff of his former partner. Harry remembers because he’d been sitting on their couch with Hermione, fixing the hem on one of his jumpers while they watched Gordon Ramsay bitching on the telly. Ron had walked straight passed them into the kitchen and Vanished everything in the icebox that had even touched another living thing. None of them have eaten animal products since that day because Harry and Hermione were stupid enough to promise when Ron, pale-faced and hysterical, begged them not to.
“Are you okay? Are you alive?”
“What is it, Granger?” Draco asked.
“It’s weird,” he decided.
Malfoy had pulled out a dining chair and was sitting in front of them, arms crossed and frowning.
Harry swallowed. “It’s not.”
The students snapped to comply, creating a knot of connected bodies. Harry grabbed hold of Dudley with one hand and Ms Williams’s available hand with the other, and Apparated all of them straight to the gates of Hogwarts.
“What the fuck is an enemyship?”
me to drink poison,” he added as an afterthought. He hoped he couldn’t, anyway.
“Hey,” Harry said softly. Millicent took one look at them, rolled her eyes, and went over to greet the couple.
“Nothing!” she said. “Mum and Dad say things have pretty much returned to normal in the Muggle world. People all think it’s really weird, and there are some fringe groups convinced it’s one paranormal thing or another, but for the most part, they’re all happy to believe it was a tectonic plate shift.”
Pansy was still, inexplicably, holding her teacup from their interrupted catch-up in the staff room. The tea threatened to spill over with every rushed step they took, only some latent magic in the tea set keeping it all inside.
Immediately, a flurry of people began talking in low voices in dozens of languages.
It took the work of a few minutes to scan the news leads, and as he’d expected, the Atlantis press conference was in almost every one of them. Their faces were viral on Facebook, Twitter, BBC, the
“May I ask—who are they, Your Majesty?” asked Draco. “Where are they from?”
“Obviously,” Draco says. “But we’ve never really talked about what we’re going to do now that,
“Ah, thanks.”
“I still don’t see why you’re so interested in the portraits, Mrs Black,” Harry said to his inside pocket as he and Draco walked along. “They’re all going to be still. The Sackler Gallery has Asian art… loads of dragons.”
She smiled at this, something Bellatrix would never have done in quite so sane a way. “And the same for Transfigurations,” she said, turning back to Malfoy again. Harry could see that too—Transfigurations didn’t even usually use incantations. It was a much freer magic than others. “I can see why the two of you are so drawn to these subjects. You have the look about you.”
“The first, he said,” said Hermione. “It’s this one.”
There was a silence as Harry and Draco continued to stare at one another. Harry didn’t know what to say.
Luna purses her lips ever so slightly. “Did you try any of the other things on the list?”
She looks up, her eyes shining. She looks afraid to blink and Harry doesn’t blame her. “Am I really that messy?”
Severia peered into his cauldron, and wrinkled her nose at the steam coming up. She seemed to be inherently aware of the times he planned to go to the lab now, and refused to be left behind, cosy pants drawer or not.
After Ron and Dudley fell asleep, it became quiet, but Harry tossed and turned. His body felt unnatural and his mind was a mix of worry and regret and relief. He crawled out of his bed and padded over to Malfoy’s. Malfoy looked up at him and there was, underneath the blankness, still a shimmer of affection there. Affection and something like happiness at seeing Harry.
Harry had repeated slowly.
Draco smirked. They sipped their drinks and let the hum of people relax them into something less than awkward—something that felt less like two blokes who’d seen each other naked and more like two blokes who were just mates.
“Mr Malfoy,” Orkney said mildly.
“Fuck it, let’s get a whole menagerie,” said Draco.
“I am not,” Harry said. “I get on just fine.”
He looked at her askance. “...Doing what?”
Finally, the feeling came.
Ron’s eyes narrowed. “You send her home right now, Harry. I swear to Merlin, if you give her a Snitch—!”
Hermione burst out laughing, then slapped her hand over her mouth. “Sorry, sorry!” she said. “It’s just…if I may channel Harry for a moment: Who fucking knows? People or creatures from other planets—or aliens, as we called them in the Muggle world—have always been one of those things that we don’t quite know if they exist or not. There have been sightings throughout history, people claimed to have seen nonhuman people, or to have seen nonhuman-made aircraft, but it’s always had an element of conspiracy to it. Do they exist, or is it a hoax? And if they do exist, why are they here? What do they want from us?”
Hannah hesitated. “Alright fine, I do, too. I just don’t want us all to get arrested.”
Ron nodded, thinking. “But you’re insistent on being so anyway.”
I’m worried about. Did you read it?”
Malfoy threw his head back, sighing at the ceiling. But he stood back and let the door open wider. Poseidon glared at them both. “Fine. Come in.”
Finally Draco continued, “Teddy, has Granny told you where babies come from yet?”
She shook her head. “Not without modification—otherwise, we would all cease to exist until magic brought us out again. I wasn’t lying when you first came to me asking me to redo the spell. But, I could not do it again, anyway. You see, magic never comes free. What you take, you must also pay back. Neither I nor my remaining Council have magic any longer.”
They landed square in the Apparition Zone in Diagon Alley, just before the bank. It was closed for the evening, but much of the retail stayed open late. Was it just Harry or did Draco take a fraction of a second too long to release him from Side-Along position?

“Neither is blackmail,” said Draco, shrugging.
Draco smirked. “For you, maybe.”
“Port-keys in five!” called Zach.
“My godson!” Harry insisted.
Harry didn’t know. But he wanted to.
The gargoyles guarding McGonagall’s office had a Scottish brogue. Draco was not sure if that had been there during Dumbledore’s time, but he was dubious the same.
“Harry,” Draco panted, his fingers digging into the flesh at Harry’s shoulder blades. “Don’t stop, don’t stop.”
Draco grimaced. “I know he’s dead, but it still stings when you say his name.” He gestured to the faded mark on his arm, disguised by a delicate floral sleeve winding all around it.
“No.” He flicked on the burner and turned to face Draco directly. “Just hybridisation. I’ve done a beak and feathers.”
“That sneaky bastard,” he said aloud. “He’s making me beg.”

The barrel door opened. Harry couldn’t be arsed to turn his head to see who else would be coming in, but he didn’t have to. Madam Pomfrey’s distinguished ‘Tsk tsks!’ were recognisable enough.
“We need to destroy the impurity, and then reconjoin the quartz with the calcined ash. What destroys things?”
Rita Skeeter would start an inquisition.
Harry looks at him askance, momentarily baffled. They usually don’t go six months between shag fests. More like two. Lately, it’s been closer to a few days apart, here and there. Harry’s never been sure if that means anything or if their mutual dwindling of ‘serious’ romantic partners has just pushed them closer together more frequently because they’re fucking lonely.
, Potter,” Draco stressed, as his hands came back around to pull Harry against him again. Harry shuddered, the feeling of Draco’s expensive shirt against his bare skin almost overwhelming. “Not even for Losers Who Lived.”
“Dating too much for you, Harry?” asked Michael. “Need a little break?”
Harry huffed and let his eyes roam back over to his house’s table. There was Draco, sitting with Neville, Luna, Sally, and Mandy crowded around him. Imani and Fayth weren’t far away. Maybe it was just Harry, but he felt unravelled after last night, and as he saw the thoughtful looks on the faces of his fellow new Hufflepuffs, he thought they did, too.
Harry laughed, but it was deprecating. Well, it was worth a shot, he supposed. “Alright, Malfoy,” he said. “You win.”
After yesterday, he thought it was pretty fair to be creeped out, but he was starting to wonder if he
“Yeah,” said Harry. “The nitric acid from the aqua fortis…it released the hydrogen and oxygen molecules that make up water.”
Harry’s eyes sink closed.
“Oh, fuck off. And go get ready. We have a wedding to attend.” He stood to take his plate to the sink. He gave it a cursory wash (dishwashing was still a new and confusing concept to Draco) and set it awkwardly in the drying rack. He gave Harry a saucy wink as he left the kitchen, calling, “Brats! Get showered and dressed and make sure you brush your teeth! We’re leaving in one hour!”
He rooted around in his backpack and pulled out a lovely oval, 5” x 7”, gold-leafed, wooden frame. Inside, there was a dreary
“Two ounces,” Snape suggested. “I am not certain, but given that you’ve used one-half litre of base and the stone looks as though it will displace about 30 millilitres of water, that is the amount I would use. Add it slowly.”
“Seems that way,” Harry said, still scowling. “I think Gin secretly encourages it at home. She always looks delighted when he says it.”
“Yeah, that one. Hermione always said I was a pessimist.”
It had been four years. Why couldn’t Harry just fucking move on?
“And to be fair,” Harry continued, “What threat were you? Hogwarts parents actually
“Obviously, crumpet,” said Ron. “Oh, Hermione said to tell you, Harry, that they’ve got to move Padma and Nott’s vow of loyalty ceremony to another location because rain’s forecasted this weekend.”
Desultory—but neatly—Scorpius continued packing his favourite plushies into his travel bag. Draco had already packed up their flat. The furniture, linens, dishes, clothes, and so on were shrunk and stacked neatly in his suitcase. He didn’t know what McGonagall would provide with his suite of rooms, but any deficiencies could always be made up for with a trip to the Manor.
“He stares at you kind of balefully a lot, though,” Dudley continued. “I think that’s one of his tells—to be dour when he’s into someone.”
“I also wish to tender my resignation,” Harry whispers. “As I will be unable to continue to abide by the Department’s first covenant of no interpersonal relationships.”
Harry quickly grew accustomed to the heart-stopping crinkle at the corners of Draco’s eyes when Harry made him laugh, and the frenetic rush in his veins whenever Draco would grab his hand while they walked together. Harry’s lungs would collapse under the vividness of Draco’s gaze on him, and it would take half a minute before he could breathe again. Draco was everything Harry had fantasised he might be, and worse: he was more.
Harry hesitates in the doorway. Draco’s voice hasn’t been that void since the beginning of eighth year. His shadow disappears against the dark wall, and even as his eyes adjust, everything feels black and cold.
She looked at him, startled, before walking up to him and taking the first Snitch.
He was right there. And then Malfoy moaned, his bollocks tightening against Harry’s knuckles, his shaft throbbing and that was all it took. Harry fell over the edge, his orgasm surging through him, over and over.
Millicent snorted. “Of course Dudley’s the one to drum up all the support,” she murmured. Dudley shot her a grin, which she returned.
He could practically feel Snape rolling his eyes, despite not even having a view of his face at present.
“But they’ll just fuck it all up again,” said Draco, eternal pessimist. They deflated again. Watching Hufflepuffs interact, how they ebbed and flowed all together, was probably very funny to outsiders. But outsiders would never see them like this. It was how Hufflepuff had survived so long, and certainly how their secret society had.
“I am serious, I have no idea what you’re talking abo—”
Narcissa repeated the request in Mandarin, and the alien laughed—a horrible, shrill cackle more reminiscent of insects than people. It replied.
“I don’t know,” he finally said.
Harry nodded. He could’ve figured that himself. “And the incantation?”
Draco snatches him in, pulls him so close Harry can make out each sleep-deprived capillary in Draco’s eyes. They are nothing like Narcissa’s.
The wizarding cataloguing system had only helped to stomp out whatever Ravenclaw tendencies he might’ve once had. It took him twenty minutes to find Paracelsus, who was not located near any other P authors, but instead under a sub-category of German and Swiss wizards who wrote on Alchemy, Potions, Poultices, and Transmutation, sorted by year and relevance to modern magic.
The cat regarded him, blinking slowly. Draco was now scratching her behind the ears and she was accepting it regally, like a queen condescending to have her hand kissed by a peasant.
“It’s like we took a holiday to another country together just now,” Harry whispered to him. He was simultaneously trying not to feel hopeful and not get his hopes up. He’d come close to baring it all to Draco last night. Maybe he’d forgotten everything that was said after a few drinks.
Socorro smiled at him. “Hello, Harry.”
Draco tugs his hand, and Harry turns. Draco lifts one eyebrow. “It’s only her magic if you believe it is.”
“We’re on the way to lunch, not a seminar,” Mitchell says. “Chill.”
With Malfoy arriving in the morning, Harry needed it.
dorm room.
Until the cat calls started, anyway. Harry jerked back, blushing furiously.
Draco laughs harshly. “No,
, Harry agrees. He doesn’t know who it is, but he’s sure it isn’t Fievel.
Harry obeys and only then glances up to see the matching looks of scrutiny on Mummy and Daddy Malfoy. Harry clears his throat. “Sorry about that. I’m a product of my upbringing,” he says, which he suspects will endear him to them because there’s nothing a Malfoy likes better than the bourgeoisie knowing their place.
“I don’t, like,
Severus merely smiled at Draco and Potter. “Nothing, Minerva, that you’ll want to know of in advance.”
Harry nods. “Yeah, she’ll love you just as much as before.
Behind him, Lucius cleared his throat softly, and Draco raised an eyebrow at him.
He always likes to finish Draco first, so he can be fully present, hear every sound, taste every inch. After, only after Draco unloads himself in Harry’s mouth will he reach down with trembling hands and touch himself, or so he can flip Draco back and bury himself to the hilt in his body. He’ll decide when he gets there.
Potter laughed breathlessly. “I hope awhile.”
Harry snorted, unable to prevent the laugh that burst forth. He had no desire whatsoever to send Draco to Antarctica, but…well, maybe there was something in that suggestion. Something completely different from what Ron intended. Harry diverted back to the Quidditch shop. There was, in fact, something Harry could get him, something that he wouldn’t be able to get on his own, something that would hopefully show Harry had no intentions of caging him.
“Thanks,” said Draco. He took a sip and immediately started to feel warmth and alertness flow back into him. “Thanks,” he said again.
So he’s not exactly keen on the fact that he’ll have to shortly tell the man that he’s knocked his son up. With twins. Of which both are girls. And Draco’s already said one can be a Potter.
Malfoy shrugs. They stare at each other for a moment past comfortable. Harry busies himself with some paperwork he’s been putting off since Christmas. Finally, it’s close enough to six that they can walk out without looking too conspicuous—not that it matters much for Malfoy since he’s never fucking coming back, the stupid selfish fuck.
Severus nodded, absorbing this new info. “A hundred years difference. And then a sudden flood. What held the water back for those one-hundred years and then suddenly released it over Atlantis?”
Draco grins slyly. “Already did. That’s our problem, or have you forgotten?”
“Why would I?” asked Harry.
“I have two seats, actually,” Draco said. “Mother has the Black seat. Because you never claimed it. And I sit the Malfoy seat."
Ron gave him a sideways grin. “I know, mate,” he said, and even though he was smiling, there was sadness in his voice. “There’s time for happiness yet. For all of us.”
“I’m an Unspeakable, who is supposed to be enjoying a sabbatical,” Hermione grit out. “I specialise in Mind Magics and I can tell you with one hundred per-cent certainty this spell
Hermione jumped up, upsetting Rosie’s milk and not bothering to right it. She grabbed Harry’s arm as he stepped towards the Floo. Harry spun around, glowering. She ignored this. “Read your damned owls, Harry.”
“Good thing I’ve got Malfoy helping me now, too, then.”
Harry narrowed his eyes. “Ron.”
He passed the mobile to Pansy, who squinted down at the glass picture and then scrunched her eyebrows. Draco peered over her shoulder and felt his expression follow a similar path.
Twenty minutes in, both his and Hermione’s potions were a steady buttercream colour.
“Excuse me,” said Harry. “Have you forgotten that we are all going to lose our magic and possibly our lives in the very near future?”
“I have met them, of course. There is more to this story: When humans began to slowly attain the bodies and minds our creators desired, they chose the best of many to begin work on the cities they would come to inhabit. They took the most elegant of figure, the keenest of mind, the strongest and the most artistic, and brought them to an island to breed together.
Harry thinks.
“What did you discover of the Atlanteans’ magic system? Was it similar to that of the Greeks who came after?”
Harry’s were a bit more utilitarian than Malfoy’s. When he was forced out of Sirius’s old jacket, Harry kept to a frock-coat with a more muted pattern, all in emerald and teal, rather than one of those with all the gold embroidery. He was comfortable in them, and in a pinch, they passed more easily for Muggle clothes than traditional robes did. A quick Colour-Changing Charm on the robe to make it all black could turn it from Victorian to stylish peacoat in a snap. And while dragon-hide boots looked nothing like non-magical mammal leather, it could pass for snakeskin, if one was willing to look like a jazz singer.
Draco’s mouth snapped shut and he stared resolutely forward. Harry readjusted Mrs Black’s portrait inside his linen blazer. Her frame kept digging into his ribs.
“If you ever need anything, just to talk, or… you know, watch Manchester on telly with me, you can come over anytime. Anytime, Hermione.”
There’s this difference in London Malfoy and Beirut Malfoy. London Malfoy’s cold, collected, a fine Auror, who, despite years of dedicated work and a top-notch solve record, is still despised by three-quarters of the department.
Harry tossed a wave over his shoulder as he rushed to catch up with his house. He fell into step behind the other eighth years. Malfoy was talking to Sally-Anne Perks, who he couldn’t really remember ever speaking to anyone when she'd been in Gryffindor, but here she was, chatting away with Malfoy of all people.
“Hey Albus,” Harry said. “Did you have a good time tonight?”
The best part of a volcano wedding theme was that volcanoes spewed out lava, which was red, and sparks, which were gold. Harry was very good at decorating in Gryffindor colours.
“Is my fucking wife there with you, Harry?” Ron demanded as soon as Harry came into view.
“All you think about is my cock,” Malfoy continues, teasing it at Harry’s hole. “I see you, don’t think I don’t see you. You’ve been
The distinct, horrifying sound of a modem began from Lee’s computer. Harry stared at him. Was he trying to use dial-up?
It’s just that—Malfoy is Harry’s
Harry sits back on his haunches and looks up at Draco. He wipes the back of his hand across his mouth. Draco stares at him for a long moment, his lips parted, his eyes still dilated from spent arousal. Harry’s heart double-beats once. Has it worked? It looks like it wor—
It felt like every important moment in Harry’s life had been connected to Draco in some way, and he couldn’t think of anything but the smell of burning and the screams of Fiendfyre. That had been the moment Harry
“What about me?” asked Harry.
Su Li presented on an article from the Quibbler. Then Anthony Goldstein went, and then Ron showed them a lonely hearts ad from last Thursday’s
to get up himself. A shadow fell over his page, and it didn’t have a large, bushy area at the top like Hermione’s did. He looked up and inhaled sharply at the sight of Draco in his rooms.
Hermione grinned a bit. “How did your session with Professor McGonagall go? Did she talk you into going into Healing?”
She was always so bloody cheerful, as if losing her magic had taken with it all her stress and worry. But then again, she’d been able to quit the Ministry fully without regret, work on her children’s novels full time. Harry was grateful he could still co-teach with Dudley, though Dudley now took the lead on the magical side.
The Queen stepped forward and a hush fell.
It was hours later before the wards burst bright red, signalling the level of calcium oxide had reached the threshold Harry set. There was a rustle of fabric from Snape’s frame, and Harry knew he was just as antsy as Harry now, even if he’d never say it. Harry approached the cauldron, carefully peered inside. Through the red haze of the wards, he could see what was left of the stone floating on top of the acid in it’s little protective bubble.
“Harry,” Ginny said, softly. She was sat on Harry’s dated, old royal blue settee, balancing a cup of tea on her knee with her free hand. Dudley had taken the other arm chair. Ron and Hermione were by the fireplace, on a small loveseat Hermione had conjured, though they’d left Rose and Hugo with Molly and Arthur for the evening.
Harry looked back down at the newspaper. “Nobody asked you to.”
“Clearly it is!” Hermione turned, hand on her hip. “Look, I think it’s time you acknowledge that the two of you are just too different to make this work long term!”
“Harry?” Ron asked quietly.
Jude nodded fiercely. “Okay. Thank you, Harry.”
It wasn’t exactly a ringing endorsement, but then, Harry wasn’t sure Andromeda would give anyone that kind of praise.
“I don’t know. I’ve never tried to be brave.” Draco glanced over her shoulder to see if someone might be walking down the hall, but no one was. “Do you need to be brave?” he risked.
“He just told you!” Dean snarled.
Harry was struck a bit dumb by the look on Draco’s face, faltered just slightly at the sight, and then promptly stumbled over his own two feet. He flailed to keep from pitching onto the table, his hand weaving in the air, tea slopping over the side of the cup.
“Does he know the others?”
Teddy buried his face in Draco’s leg and said. “I’m gonna be family for you too. I’m gonna be the best family for you.”
Auror Brennon hauled Jones up, her face a twisted snarl of hate. “Filthy Weres! I should have gutted you in the closet! Dogs! Every single one of you!” she screamed as Auror Brennon wrapped his arms around her waist, physically yanking her from the room, her voice echoing through the empty space.
So, I probably should have put this in the first chapter notes, but I totally forgot. This story is finished. It has nine chapters and an epilogue, and I will be posting one to two chapters per week. I will post chapter 9 and the epilogue at the same time.
Teddy nodded emphatically, carefully taking the cup from him. He looked at Faye and said sullenly, “Harry’s a good Alpha.”
She wasn’t wrong.
Harry sighed loudly. “I am tired of cleaning the bathroom. If getting you a new wand means you can clean, then I will do that.” Harry threw potatoes into the skillet angrily and sprinkled salt and pepper on everything.
“You said he lives on Gray Inn Road?” Harry said suddenly.
Carefully, Harry peeled one of Malfoy’s hands from his legs. “You’re a man. See? Flesh and bone.” He held up Malfoy’s hand for him to see, ran his fingers over Malfoy’s palm.
“Oh.” Evan sighed and shook his head. “Why he can’t give that bloke up, I’ll never understand.”
“Yeah, okay.” Draco nodded, relieved that Neil had forgiven him so easily.
Ginny licked her lips and made no motion to move. “I always thought, when I was older, ready to settle down, that we’d get married. I love you, Harry,” she said, a little bit earnest and a little bit sad.
“I bet it’s more expensive,” Ron said glumly. “Like those apples.”
It was an assault on the ears and nose, the noise and the scents overwhelming and impossible. And Draco whined low and rubbed his snout against the floor. Hunt! Pack! He sniffed for the scent of his prey strong in this place. He breathed again, to keep the sickening flower and the musk of the man close, tried to ignore the other scents that threatened to distract him.
Astoria turned her luminous smile on Draco, “Only good news.” She stepped up to her father and kissed his cheek.
“Well that begs a question.” Harry pointed out, but didn’t actually ask the question. He stepped back into the kitchen and put the chicken in a pan.
“Fuck!” Harry shouted, dropped the glass, and grabbed the hand holding the knife. “Accio wand!” He shouted, and the wand smacked into his hand, blood still dripping from Draco. “Episkey! Episkey!”
“Okay.” Draco breathed out, and the tube arrived at their stop.
“Do you know Harry?” Lee cut into that brief fantasy.
“I don’t know what to do.” Malfoy said after a moment.
When it was his turn, Harry closed his eyes before stepping up to the podium. Once he could feel the smooth metal under his hands, he took a deep breath and looked out over the crowd. “We’ve let hate and fear of the unknown split our society. It’s time to invite those who have been lost back into our world. Students, like Jude and Sarah, who attended Hogwarts and were then prevented from returning--because they were bitten by a werewolf, because they were cursed and deemed too dangerous to be around other children, because they lost the war and thought there was no place for them. There are students who do not have a safe home to return to for summer, who are bullied, who have been told they are unwanted.
Draco nods solemnly and accios a cup. He fills is with water and hands it to Harry. Harry takes it with shaky hands and sips.
Draco gasps out in pain. “Harry!” he yells.
“Why are you so angry? I just came to return this!” Draco says. He pulls one hand out of the pocket ands grips the fabric at his chest.
“Draco,” Harry whispered. His eyes were still closed and Draco felt his his hand twist in his jumper, gripping him tight.
------
“Happy Christmas, Draco,” Harry said. He reached his arm around Draco's back and held him tight.
“Wow,” Harry says. He lets out a laugh and shakes his head. “You don’t know.” Draco can practically feel Harry rolling his eyes.
Then Draco feels strong arms wrapped around him. Harry presses his face against the nape of Draco’s neck and holds him close to his body. Draco tenses up at first, but then Harry is drawing circles onto Draco hand with his thumb and he begins to relax.  He muscles unclench and his jaw goes slack. He finally feels safe after months of going to sleep in an empty, cold bed.
“Oh.”
Draco runs his hands along the duvet then under to the sheets. They’re just as soft as he remembers them being. The sheets are crisp and white, while the duvet is a soft green. The first time Draco had seem them he had been surprised by the color. But, after coming to know Harry, he found that they suit him well.
“As have I,” Draco said. He took a seat in his bed and opened his arms, an invitation for Harry to come to him.
------
“I couldn't dream of it,” Draco said. He buried his face into Harry's neck once again and let out a sigh. “Good night, Harry. Happy Christmas.”
Harry finally located the flat and unlocked the door with a simple ‘alohomora’. He looked around and immediately his spirits fell. Draco had not one Christmas decoration up. Or any decorations at all for that matter. Harry had always made sure that there were plenty of pictures and artworks around their flat to keep everything interesting.
“I’m the reason he’s leaving, Pans. I can’t do that,” Draco sighs. “I need a stronger drink.”
Draco burrows into Harry’s warm arms and they finally get a good night's sleep
- Blaise
They sat in silence again for a while. Harry was too nervous to address his presence in London and Draco was too afraid to ask.
When he gets downstairs, Harry has the tea ready and set on the small table in the kitchen. He smiles at Draco when he enters. “You still like 3 sugars and milk right?” he asks.
“Draco wait,” Harry says, before Draco can step in the floo.
Harry eases them onto the bed.
“I suppose.”
Draco stays silent for a minute before speaking. “What, what are they about?” he asks.
Get your bum over to mine and bring some liquor and/or food.
“Come on, then,” Harry says. He begins the journey back upstairs to his room with Draco in tow.
The crowd roars in applause and Harry climbs the stars onto the stage. Hermione passes by him on her way off and she gives him a small hug and kiss on the cheek. “Good luck,” she whispers to him. Harry nods.
Harry notices that he’s acting strange. Draco’s eyes look glazed over and his stance is shifty. He walks closer to Draco. “Are you alright?”
“You can plan on me… “
He opened the letter and found an invitation to get out of the house
Draco is the first to pull away. “You’d let me stay? Even after what I did?” he asks, unsure of himself.
“I’m sorry,” Draco says because he can’t think of anything better.
“As in...?”
“After breakfast then?” Harry asks. He tilts Draco’s face to his own with his hands and kisses Draco’s mouth open.
Draco wraps his arms tightly around Harry’s torso and presses his nails into Harry’ back. He moves his lips down to Harry’s shoulder and nips at the skin.
Finally, Draco slumps in Harry’s arms. He’s breathing heavy. He buries his face into Harry’s neck. Harry strokes Draco’s back as he begins to rut against Draco’s spent body. He’s so close from watching Draco. A few movements of his hips and his aching cock spurts in his sweats. He presses his face into Draco’s hair as he comes.
Then, he reaches over and grabs Harry. He pulls him into a tight embrace and rocks him gently. Harry slumps in his arms and wraps himself around Draco. Harry begins crying and Draco shushes him, whispering sweet things into his ear and telling him it’ll be okay. He’s safe, no one will hurt him. They stay this way for a while. Draco runs his hands through Harry’s hair and Harry cries into his neck. When Harry’s tears stop, Draco pulls away and wipes his face with his sleeve.
“What now, Harry,” Draco says. He looks exhausted. There are bags under his eyes and he has a hunch to his shoulder.
“Stay?”
“You’re drunk,” Harry says, dropping his hand from Draco’s chin and taking 2 steps back. “Of course you're fucking drunk,” Harry says with a shake of his head.
“Then why are you wearing it?” Harry growls. He’s mad and Draco knows it. “Why do you do this, Draco? Why do you get drunk and come here while wearing my jacket?”
“Nooooo!!” Draco whines. He shrugs Theo’s hand off. “‘m fine. I ‘an go myself,” he slurs.
“How long then?” Draco said.
“Mmhmm,” Draco hums. He’s still looking away.
“I can do that,” Harry says.
Draco watches Harry leave the ballroom. His heart is in his throat but he won’t get up and chase Harry. He refuses to.
They fell asleep to the sound of each other's breathing and the soft sound of the music, still on repeat.
Pansy is here.
They sleep until noon. Harry wakes with Draco tucked in his arms, chest pressed against back. He presses small kisses on Draco’s back and eases Draco out of sleep.
“I'll be home for Christmas...”
Draco still doesn’t look at him. It reminds Harry of tonight at the gala during his speech. It infuriates him that Draco won’t even glance his way.
“Draco,” Harry panted, “Get on with it.”
Draco turned his attention to the huge Christmas tree in the corner of the room and reached for the bauble with his and Harry's initials. He turned it in his hand to look at the messy heart he had drawn 2 years ago. He felt his throat constricting as he hung it back up on the tree.
He walked to the living room and found 2 stockings hung on the fireplace mantle. A green one with his name on it and a silver one with Harry's. He grabbed the picture of him and Harry kissing and felt tears in his eyes.
“Why?”
“If only in my dreams.”
Weasley and Granger had pestered Draco for the first couple of weeks about Harry’s whereabouts but they had quickly realized their friend would not be returning anytime soon.
He looks to his right where Hermione is standing off stage. She gives him a smile and moves her hand as if to say “go on”. Harry clears his throat and begins his speech by thanking everyone. His speech is generic, hardly different from each year where he gives gratitude and talks about people they lost in the war, ending with more thanks and a promise to see everyone next year.
He sits and drains the glass within a few minutes. He gets up 2 more times for glasses of fire whisky but no one says anything. Thankfully, his friends know when to stop talking and let him be. After his third glass he gets up, albeit on wobbly feet, and hugs everyone around the table. “Ima head home,” he says to them, barley keeping his balance.
“I don’t know,” Draco mumbles. His voice is soft, barely a whisper. Draco begins taking off the jacket. He slips his hands out of the sleeves and holds it out for Harry to take. He feels like he’s losing his home as he stands there with his hand stretched out but he knows he had already lost his home when they broke up. When he left.
Draco lets out a shaky breath.
Draco had left him 5 months ago. Harry had begged him to stay, not wanting to be alone in a big city. Though he had lived there for over 2 years, Harry still felt small in the vast area. Draco had begged him to move back to London. In July, Harry had not been ready. But now, he was.
“Draco,” Harry says, softly. He reaches his hand to Draco’s cheek and gently turns his face towards him. Draco’s skin is so soft, Harry imagines it better than a baby’s bottom. Finally, finally, Draco looks at him. Harry can’t breathe when he looks into those gray eyes, but he doesn’t look away.
“Draco.”
As disappointed as Harry might have been, he had anticipated this and unshrunk his bags from his pockets. The first thing he pulled out from his suit case was a picture of him and Draco the week before Draco left. Then, Harry hadn’t known Draco was planning on moving away and their smiles were bright with Draco’s arm slung over Harry’s shoulder.
He looked down, towards the forest floor, and there they were: the little crawling spirits of long-dead creatures, too stupid to know they were dead. He could send them on their way in this state. He could look into the afterlife if he tried hard enough.
“Why do you think you’ve been thus far unable to find a meaningful relationship?” Luna asked.
Harry shrugged. “What do
“It sure does,” Andromeda said. She added to them, “Teddy’s learning a lot at his Gobbledegook lessons. He greeted every single banker when we walked by, didn’t you, Teddybear?”
His chest tightened, a frenetic, aching feeling as their lips met. He clenched his eyes shut tight and put everything he had into that kiss, knowing that he wasn’t honouring the offer he’d made Draco, but unable to stop himself. Draco made him a liar. Draco made him more honest than he’d ever been in his life.
“Not this time,” said Queen Sostrate. “A Queen cannot ask a sacrifice of her subjects she would not give herself—I was overruled last time, but it is my turn now.”
“I’m not,” Harry admitted. “I was trying to find something on how Muggle chemicals interact with magic.”
They were crepuscular, Hermione had said. He could see why now. How much nicer it would be to enjoy the world like this every day, with no land-humans around. It was peaceful here. Hesitantly, he waved. She tensed further, then dove into the water.
“I figured I had to be the one to do it, if it was going to get done,” Harry agreed. “You know how you people are.”
But Draco had grown exponentially since those early years of studying ancient magic. He knew Atlantean spell-casting as well as he knew modern casting now. They could do this.
Luna exchanged another speaking look with Gin. “We need to get a sample of that to Fleur and Theo for testing.”
“Do you truly believe he has been taken by extraterrestrials, Mrs Dursley?”
The kids were unusually quiet as they trooped along towards the park, and their unnatural hesitance to chatter about any and every little fucking thing set Harry’s teeth on edge. It was like yawning: because they felt uneasy, he felt uneasy, too.
“Padma!” Hermione said, happily. “I didn’t expect to see you!”
“Merlin help you all,” Severus said, his eyes glittering. “The spell only worked on people currently on the island. And those it did—there have already been reported neurological damage: brain swelling, loss of hearing and other senses. The rest of the world just went mad—mass shootings all over, especially the US, that all started within minutes of the spell. Some people, instead of forgetting Atlantis, have forgotten their own names, their families, their careers.”
A moment went by, the curtain twitched by the door.
that he gets in his head and chest and wrists more than makes up for it. Draco closes the space between their bodies, his chest laying flat against Harry’s and he kisses the damp skin of his shoulder. Harry turns his head and their lips meet messily.
“Hermione,
Draco licked his bottom lip, nodded once. “Of course.” He turned and started up the slope to the castle, slipping the stone in his pocket as he went.
Astoria covered her mouth, stared at Draco with sparkling eyes. He shrugged, having no idea what he was supposed to say. She was the free-spirited art teacher, after all. He was fine being the conservative historian.
“Food,” Draco said, just as the elf he’d called returned with a rucksack full of his things.
, Hermione’d said.
“What in Merlin’s name is going on?” Malfoy growled from the other side of the bed.
Draco snorted. “You’ll make an excellent little goblin one day.”
“Tell me everything,” Draco said, as he pushed open the back door and strode in. He was in a t-shirt and sleep pants—the closest to undressed Harry had ever seen him in front of other people.
Malfoy sneered. “I could say the same.”
Pansy had her hand over her mouth. Draco couldn’t remember seeing her eyes so wide since the war. “What on earth did they
Potter had lunch brought up to them and they worked all through the morning and into the afternoon. He called the ICW around lunch and tried to relay the urgency of their discovery of the UFOs’ mission and how all magical people were all in danger, but Herbert Kurzschluss’s assistant only said he’d pass the message on. Their Floo call was never returned.
“Not when I’m doing lesson plans, that’s for sure,” she said.
Harry and Neville shared a look.
, and he— “Oh.
“Woah!” Fergus McTavish exclaimed. “That’s killer.”
Hermione tapped some more, bottom lip between her teeth. “All right, let’s try this place. It’s back near the Tube. Should be much quicker without our bags.”
They crossed Trafalgar Square, all twenty of his students fixing hawk eyes on the crowd around it. The tourists snapping photos in front of Nelson’s Column appeared in good spirits. The British Muggles, hurriedly making their way to and from work looked generally displeased by the raucousness, but that was hardly unusual.
Harry took hold of Malfoy’s elbow and felt him twist them away into the void.
“I know,” he said. It sucked, but if Hermione could handle Life After Family, then he could do Life After Malfoy. Even if he was the only one who knew it had been there to begin with. Merlin, fuck, it hurt to hold it all himself, but he wouldn’t betray Draco by telling.
He liked having Draco here. It felt like Conjunction, and he thought that maybe this was just as real an Alchemy as the stone in his pocket. Whether or not it was safer, was yet to be determined.
, Harry thought dryly.
Harry was momentarily speechless. “Yeah, of course. The, er, Great Fall.”
After barely escaping what would no doubt be an awkward confrontation with the Headmistress, Harry and Draco made it out to the grounds. Harry wasn’t quite sure of his new gait, but he managed to make it down the steps, and then the rocky, grassy slope that led to Hagrid’s and the Forest beyond. They curled around the edge of it for a few minutes, looking for a discreet place to enter.
Harry jumped up and dashed over to the cabinets to find some plates and bowls. Lee came over to help, giving him a wry look as he pulled open drawers looking for the silverware. They had the table set and the food out in short order. To Harry’s infinite surprise, Malfoy had uncorked a bottle of red and poured a glass for his mother in the interim, before offering Hermione a glass with a quirked eyebrow. It was much too difficult for him to actually
Draco pressed his lips together tightly, and Harry dragged him, but they were a long way away from the edge of the diseased area, and then—Draco’s eyes dulled, and he started to twitch, and—
Dennis laughs again, his quill automatically jotting it down. “Can’t say I blame you, Harry. I swear I thought for a minute he had a
“Scared?” Draco asked through their electric earmuffs, feigning nonchalance.
“Works for me,” said Harry. Draco popped the cork and tipped it back. He passed it to Harry. “Cheers.”
…at least for the brief second between when your skin touches it or breathes in its dust and when your entire nervous system
Potter, meanwhile, was rushing around his rooms gathering books, papers, a Muggle laptop, a plushie from his son’s room, and tossing clothes onto his sofa. Draco took the opportunity to remove the Scottie landscape from his hearth and shrink it down.
“Potter,” Draco growled.
Apropos of abso-bloody-lutely nothing, he said, softly: “I like it when you make connections with Potions things.”
“Good luck,” Harry said. “I’ve got my Festival-Fringe-Incident second years first thing, and they still haven’t forgiven me for that day.”
“Like it would be a lot more exciting if you weren’t here filming it.”
Across to the Slytherin table, Seamus was having a grand time playing Snap with Ginny, the Patil sisters, and Morag. The Ravenclaw table was mostly empty, save for a few bedraggled younger years. Harry looked for Malfoy all through breakfast, but he never showed.
during the loungewear. Can you believe it? Ha! He must
Harry stoically refuses to look at or acknowledge the state of his formal living room. Draco—well-bred—follows suit.
Harry shrugged. “I think I’ve wanted that since Binns’ class.”
They were silent. Harry glanced around, seeing thoughtful looks everywhere, finally settling on Draco, who was staring at Harry with an expression he’d never seen before.
“They still will,” said Millicent, which Draco thought was rather perceptive, but then again, it was Millicent they were talking about. She’d been the most perceptive of all the Slytherins in their year. “But you’re right. I’ll have a better shot at convincing them if it’s alive.”
The older years arrived at the castle, all loud, jubilant voices and shrieking laughter. This somehow settled Harry’s frayed nerves in the way that being around other people, regardless of how little they could help you, made you less afraid of the dark.
She actually rolls her eyes at him. “I’m very impressed by the region code this Floo call is coming from,” she says. “Did you know you’re calling from Western Asia?”
“Watching Weaslette try out, looks like.”
“How can you prove there aren’t any hidden props?”
“Hey, Gawain,” he said.
He supposed he deserved it. It didn’t make it any easier to bear.
“Oh,” said Harry. He shrugged. “Well, I’ll make it then while you tell me what to do. Do you want a Pad Thai Dog or a Khao Soi Dog? You’re not allergic to eggs or nuts, right?”
“It’s not just rubbish floating in the water, though,” Harry said. “I took a sample and tested it last night. The water in the bay is full of a particular strain of algae that thrives on petrochemicals. The algae eats the chemicals and blooms, and that soaks up all the oxygen, which is why they’re drowning down there. We have to get the chemicals out, too, which is much trickier. And then we have to keep the Muggles from dumping them again.”
Two-and-half hours into their career prep session, and McGonagall was exasperated.
Harry gamely ignored the fact that Malfoy had been talking of other people’s money for ten minutes now.
“I fell, honest!” Scorpius said.
She’s locked her office door, but Harry would be a shit Auror (or maybe just a shit Harry Potter) if he weren’t able to dismantle the locks and sneak in undetected. Had Ron alerted Dawlish? Has the Ministry known about this the whole time? Harry sorts through the files scattered on her floor.
That was an early practice of his Legilimency skills that he was still regretting. The folly of youth.
“The ships are gone?” asked Malfoy.
“We will
Malfoy shrugged. “True, but I’m preparing for a Transfigurations apprenticeship. I don’t have time to teach you Potions. Nor do I care to.”
They had a small cauldron of caramel – courtesy the house elves, who adored all of Hufflepuff – simmering. It was perfect to dip the warm apple slices in. Their eyes met briefly; Harry was learning the art of communicating without words. It was simpler than he would’ve thought. All it required was paying attention to the people you were with, learning them, letting them learn you. His smile told Draco ‘thank you’, and the softening of Draco’s eyes, beautiful in the firelight, answered him.
“Eighty-four!” Teddy said triumphantly.
The first week of December, Draco was still a pathetic mess. It was a heady combination of late nights doing ridiculous experiments and equations, trying to add a wand variable into the Queen’s spell, combined with the most blowjobs he’d had in literal ages.
Malfoy seemed pleased. “Now siphon a bit and put it in your water cauldron. Just a bit.”
Harry was beginning to fret a bit. First, Draco talking to the papers, and the Lee being the only one of them summoned back to DC to help. He had no idea how the American Magicals were reacting to the news, but he suspected it wouldn’t be good.
you expecting?”
“Yes, it is,” she said. She turned back to him, smiling. “How are you feeling?”
“Your Majesty,” they all murmured, bowing and curtseying as necessary. Dudley’s friend Piers looked around the stone room, his mouth gaping. Weasley and Granger weren’t doing much better.
“We’re going to my office. Let’s go.”
“You seemed fine with my abilities the other n—”
“Get out of the kitchen,” Draco instructed. “We have to do some host things right now.”
“I didn’t agree with what Shacklebolt and the rest of them chose to do after the War, no,” Harry agreed. “At first, with the trials, I didn’t notice. It all happened so fast and I was… frankly, I wasn’t all there right after the War. I was a mess, and I missed a dozen opportunities to insist on changes, but then they were gone. People were back in their comfortable zones of status quo, already afraid of moving forward again, already setting themselves up in the same paranoid, terrified, conservative habits and policies that got us into war the last time.
a culture. We are many, many cultures, actually, but we are all over the world. In every country, we exist. In nearly all, we have remained hidden, at first due to our own fear of non-magical people, and later because of law. An international body, the International Confederation of Wizards, established a global law in 1692 that prevents any magic-user from revealing, through action or inaction, the presence of the ‘wizarding world’. By doing so today, Harry and I are committing a grave act of international treason. We therefore ask your cooperation, attention, and kindness, as it is unlikely we will be…free to provide this demonstration ever again.”
The two Potions Masters—or Mistress, in Fleur’s case—needed to get at the sample on his chest, so, reluctantly, Harry took Ms Danger in to curl up with Albus. She snuggled in under Al’s blankets, and Harry felt marginally better that his son wasn’t alone, open door or not.
“How do you feel about that?” asked Miles.
“Is he at least vegetarian?” Ron asks then.
“But he wasn’t the first one,” Granger added, quietly.
“I checked,” Hermione said. “He’s definitely not under
. Draco shifted and then he was stretching his arm across the brief expanse of floor separating the beds. “Then choose me, Potter,” he said.
“I know. I think we should just let it go,” said Hermione. “But the ICW’s committed to this path, and I’ve got to help them do it.”
Malfoy shrugged. “We only use glass goblets for guests at home, or copper if the occasion calls for it. Much more polite than silver or gold, which can hide a number of nasty things.”
Malfoy opened his mouth and wrapped his lips around the head of Harry’s cock and Harry bit down on his hand to stifle his moans. It was so, so very good, and it had been years and years since anyone had done this for Harry, but fifteen minutes later, he was no closer to coming than he was in interdepartmental meetings at work.
He sets the mail down on the counter when he’s done, goes to the icebox to pull out a jug of pomegranate juice, chugs straight from the glass, puts it back, and then spells away the jizz from his table. Where the fuck is his Crup, he wonders. Hermione comes by to feed her and let her out during the Seasons, but it doesn’t mean the little shit won’t start in on Harry’s loafers if she gets bored enough.
, he thought sometimes, when they won’t even be in the same building all day.
“I must be polite?” he said in disbelief. “Your glasses are an affront to civilised society.”
Snape scowled. “Alchemy will be the death of us all,” said Snape, as if he weren’t already dead. He fixed his eyes on Harry. The paint glittered with his anger and his curiosity. “We can’t discuss this here. Meet me by my rooms.”
, he says.
“Harry!” calls a familiar voice.
It was just – how had Harry gone seven years without realizing how attracted he was to Malfoy’s face? It was one of the first faces Harry noticed in any room he walked into. Only Ron’s and Hermione’s were more noticeable. Malfoy was not conventionally attractive, but he was striking, with sharp cheekbones and a deadly jawline. His irises were so pale they almost disappeared in certain light, and his mouth was wide with pretty white teeth that weren’t straight – the canines were a little crooked, and pushed in front of his other teeth. But when he smiled, he looked dangerous and approachable all at once, and Harry had always had a thing for danger. He’d just never seen the approachable until recently, when he’d fallen asleep every night facing Malfoy’s bed, hearing his breath even out, learning that he didn’t snore – but of course, why would he? Malfoy had a perfectly good Roman nose and genes selected from very careful breeding.
It may’ve been Harry’s imagination, but it looked to him that Hermione was sitting awfully close to Pansy Parkinson again. Hermione's cheeks were a little flushed.
“Merlin, you’re like my mother, Longbottom,” Draco muttered. “Hello, Lovegood. Have you seen that nargle nest on the fourth floor bannister?”
His phone buzzed again. He pulled it from his pocket. There was a photo from Ron, a shot from an evening edition
“As you just said, it’s Bring Your Kid to Work Day,” Draco protested, pointedly eyeing the kid in their office. “We can’t just leave him here to do his homework alone.”
He tosses the folders on the coffee table one by one, the labels and colours increasing in severity and clearance level as they hit the wood. Draco’s not working the Turkey cases. No one is, actually. Not for months. They’ve been closed, assumed sorted, and the only reason Harry was even able to make the connection is because of the days he spent staring at nothing but the cover sheets to these folders and those like them.
Harry froze. Were they going to talk about that arm-over-the-shoulder thing from last night? Should Harry have pushed him off? “Yeah?”
“Wait!”
, Harry,” he said, rising from his chair.
Harry nodded. “He said he’s attracted to me, too, but he really needs to win. For his son.”
“Yep, Waterstones is shipping them to the Hogwarts postbox. Owls should have them redirected by the end of the week. And I brought scones, from Mum.”
“Why?” said Harry.
,” Draco snapped, but he was just as angry with himself as he was with Potter.
“Muggles are the worst, huh?” Harry said, sympathetically.
“My goal is to spend as much time with Ron as possible,” Hermione says. She takes a sip of her wine—controlled, purposeful—and adds, “In fact, Ron and I are taking a holiday.”
“Yep,” said Harry, pleased. Malfoy came in and took the seat next to Millicent. Harry grinned at him. “I’m already in first place. I’d say the season’s starting well for me.”
“Which is how you’re so great at Animagus transformations.”
aroused even if his body’s currently dictating a refractory period.
he asks, eyebrow raised.
, and here you are, a Hufflepuff, and you don’t seem too perturbed about it.”
“And whoever went back in time would have to watch out for their doppelgänger for the rest of their lives,” another added. “What a pain.”
“What?”
“Dudley!”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Imagine.”
Slowly, he opened his eyes. Still as death.
He’s drunk enough at this moment that when he calculates the risk/reward of the thought in his head, he determines that it’s a sound decision. Harry stands, grabs the hem of his shirt and pulls it over his head. Draco glances up at him, his eyes skittering away, but it’s warm enough that he doesn’t think anything of it. He returns to the file. Harry pops the button on his jeans and Draco’s eyes flash back to him, wide with shock. Harry watches his face for reaction as he unzips and steps carefully out of his jeans until he’s standing in Draco’s living room in only his pants.
He’d always loved this room, filled as it was with warm wood floors and the most obnoxiously royal blue settee in the world. He took another bite of shepherd’s pie, sighing heavily once he’d swallowed.
“She was looking into how Arithmancy could be used to affect the animation of Renaissance portraits. Specifically, those holding passwords. You’ve got a Botticelli on your door. Granger wasn’t talking,” —and here the cat gave a very vocal and unequivocal hiss— “So I disabled the password with her hypothesis equations.”
The water cuts off, Draco comes out still towelling his hair. Harry takes a moment to watch his arse flex as he walks to the wardrobe and pulls out his work trousers, shirt, and robes. The heady, oppressive feeling of a thousand protective spells from the wool fabric invades the bedroom.
The wizard pointed. “Go past the Starbucks with the three-tailed Mermaid, not the one with the two-tailed Mermaid—that one’s in the NoMaj section—and take a left. It’s just there. For currency exchange, you’ll want to stop by the First National Bank of Numinous People. They can exchange Magical or Non-Magical for you. It’s outside Security and through the atrium. Follow the signs for Metro until you start seeing signs for the bank. It’s disguised as a closed magazine kiosk.”
When he finished his last set of 100 stirs, he set his rod aside and took a moment to just look at his potion and feel calm. It was perfect. Better—it was
magical society, not just ours?”
“Brought you a cheese and chutney sandwich,” Ron said. She beamed at him. It was her favourite kind.
Once they’d left, Malfoy turned to Harry, a smirk pulling at his lips. “Which one’s Mum Two?”
Alarmed, Draco said, “What?” He started looking all about himself, as if they were still on them.
“Yeah, we’re really outnumbered,” Harry said. But Malfoy knew that. They’d already talked about it.
Luna shook her head. “They’re vegetarian.” She closed her eyes again.
Malfoy smirked at Harry upon seeing his new wire-framed glasses in Transfigurations on Tuesday. Harry pretended not to notice, but it was sort of nice to be able to see and he wondered how many little smirks he might’ve missed before, just because his glasses were shit. He’d never realised that life looked so sharp before. Snape even deigned to comment on his
“Can you believe it, Harry?” Hermione whispered. She was so excited to be sitting at the head table, even as she was absently tugging at the fitted sleeves of her robes. Vector’s green and yellow family colours weren’t bad on her, but they were better on Millicent.
“That gets us closer,” Harry said. “If we can put a million in the Bay, and if we could entice them to breed themselves, it would only take about two years to filter the entire Bay. That’s not terrible, considering how long it took humans to fuck it up.”
Before he could pull her back, Hermione was in front of it, squinting up at the letters along the top. “
She sighed, removed her glasses, rubbed her eyes. “How much will I regret this?” She looked up at them, questioning.
.” He was pulling on his hair, little blond strands coming out in his fingers, and all Harry could think of was the feel of Draco’s horrified breathing against his neck, and the stomach-churning sounds of Crabbe dying, and the ten sharp bruises on his waist that had taken four weeks to fully disappear.
Slowly, Draco reached up and pulled Harry’s glasses from his face. He folded the arms and tucked them in his shirt collar. “Your eyes,” he said.
“Up you get, mate,” Harry said, prodding Ron’s ribs with one icy-cold toe. Ron moaned sleepily, and rolled over. Harry prodded him again, this time with all five icy-cold toes. This time, Ron yelped, and sat straight up. Harry grinned at him. “It’s Christmas.”
He reached into his pocket and brought out Mrs Black’s shrunken frame. “She has an industrial strength Cheering Charm on her,” he added, and Narcissa’s face brightened infinitesimally.
Draco shrugged.
“How do we stay sitting?” he whispered.
He decides to give himself the month to think things through, not make a hasty decision, and so answers (sort of) an ad he sees for a bedsit sublet near to the Embassy. It’s already furnished and moving in entails picking up his Bottomless Bag from his hotel room, checking out, and Apparating to an alley nearby. The landlord gives him a key and an odd look, his eyes noting the scars on Harry’s face, not just the lightning bolt one.
“And the alien,” Draco added.
They were getting a bit old for this
Harry swallows. “So—it’s just me and… and Malfoy working on this.”
Surely at least Ginny… Harry looked to the Slytherin table. Ginny was between a seventh year Hufflepuff and Morag McDougal from Ravenclaw. She had a plate full of posh little finger sandwiches and cheese and a huge glass of pumpkin juice.
“No problem, Harry,” Ernie said, and dashed away, letting the curtains fall shut behind him. Harry pulled himself from the bed, feeling quite bright and chipper, and nodded good morning to Malfoy, who’d apparently been first to receive a potion. Ernie was at Neville’s bed, giving him the same spiel and Neville was moaning piteously at the sunlight.
“Don’t. We don’t need slow.”
He watched Malfoy’s parents work out the etymology of that, and the way Narcissa’s face froze and Lucius’s mouth twisted once they did.
“I don’t mind your messiness,” Harry says, but it’s the wrong answer.
Draco inhaled sharply at Harry’s touch, and their eyes met, both startled. Draco’s pulse was hammering beneath Harry’s fingers, his skin heating. At once, Harry remembered Draco’s fantasy, his throaty voice as he recited it, and his breath thick and heavy. Draco’s eyes were mercurial in the fading light. Harry squeezed his wrist tighter, and barely recognising what he was doing, stepped closer. Draco didn’t step back. Their mouths were inches apart. He could feel Draco’s breath puffing against his lips and it sent shivers down his back.
“We don’t work Fridays here. What are you doing here, Potter?” Malfoy asks.
“But you do. You do it when you have a need for it. I’ve seen you.”
. And he wants to feel claimed. He’s wanted Malfoy for entirely too long to give up on him just because it’s Veela-induced.
If Luna were here, instead of West Wherever, she would’ve reminded him that he didn’t owe anyone his guilt and, even if he did, it didn’t help them. She would have told him to plant a garden instead, and pay it forward, and a bunch of other shit that would’ve helped his heart, even if it didn’t help the world.
But mostly, he was relieved they’d stopped suggesting they take the alien to the ICW. No one had any faith in that body, or the Ministry, to keep the UFOs’ inhabitants from killing them all. Draco finished his chocolate in silence, having nothing to add. It seemed like ages before the staff broke up to try to get an hour or two of sleep before morning.
“Potter,” Malfoy said, eyes raking down Harry’s body. He swayed closer to Harry, trailing a finger down Harry’s chest. “I was thinking about you last night. I want—”
... Harry writes slowly.
“Yeah, it is. A processionary caterpillar. Whose fur causes asthma, miscarriages in horses, and urticaria. You can figure that word out can’t you?”
“I think so, yeah.” Harry focuses only on her. Whenever he looks at Draco, he just—wants him. He wants him and he loves him and his hands feel empty without touching him.
“But we can’t—how the hell are we going to fight them?” said Draco, forgetting himself.
McGonagall’s eyes narrowed. “Not as well as you would be, as I’m sure you know.”
“I want the grey lights,” Harry says, returning to the matter at hand. “And are you even going to have time for the diffuser? We’ve Rehearsal in six hours.”
“I just did the Suntan Solution,” Harry said, indignant.
“My working theory remains that the Mark is a magical artefact, embedded in my skin, not a spell cast
calls it ‘chic lack of forethought’. Harry calls it ‘indecision and laziness’.
Harry craned his neck down to the middle of the table, and found McGonagall’s sharp green eyes glaring back at them. “She did, mate.”
“Draco,” Potter said, pointing to him and causing him to blink at the sound of his own name from Potter’s mouth, “is an historian of Atlantis. He’s studied your casting methods and history for years—what we know of them from records anyway—and he could probably help adapt it to modern spellcasting. I have a friend who’s very good at solving magical problems who could help, too.”
“Is Beirut all desert and stuff?” Harry asks, to drive away the weird.
Draco looked away again. “Because I’m afraid of being caged,” he guessed.
“Take Shaadhon,” Ziyad says immediately. “He can sniff strong magic out. As a matter of fact, he’s been really excitable lately. I thought it was just you showing up, but now that I think on it, he started a few days before you arrived. Has it been here all along?”
Harry blushed.
Harry nodded again. He rummaged in his kit for his alembic, and then attached it to the top of his cauldron. Once secure, he raised the flame again. They settled down on the dead grass, leaning back against the shed wall beneath Snape’s stuck frame. Somehow their shoulders came to touch, and neither of them moved away. It was warm and quiet in their little area, and there was something profound in watching his hair melt into Draco’s.
rather fit. “But I concede on Dexter. He’s my second chaser.” At Hermione’s smirk, he felt his face flush a little. And further, how did Hermione even know those names? He’d been sure she always tuned them out when he and Ron were talking Quidditch.
