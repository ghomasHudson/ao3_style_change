Potter’s cock slipped out of his lips, and he could not help but cough a little, his throat burning and sticky from the perfect abuse. “Are you ok? Was I too rough?” Breathed Potter, sitting on the floor, leaning against the bench, one leg bent to support his arm. Not sure he had enough breath to speak just yet, Draco took a moment to appreciate the state of the man in front of him: body glistening with sweat, his face glowing in the afterglow of his orgasm, cock softening between his legs. but still thick, tip filth with cum. Simply divine.
A blessing, because he really was a sight to behold, but also maddening because he made him horny and randy twenty-four seven.
He backed up enough to breathe normally again and then dived back in, obtaining another sinful groan from Potter. Draco kept doing that, not caring about the saliva running down his chin or the tears wetting his cheeks. He was face fucking himself on the huge shaft and he had to admire Potter’s auto control, but at the same time, he cursed it. He wanted him to lose control, to pleasure fills his head until his body would pursue his orgasm with no hesitation. Apparently, the Golden Boy needed a little incentive.
“Draco Malfoy speechless, that’s not a sight you see every day.” He walked to him and handed the red roses, while placing a soft kiss to his cheek. “Happy anniversary, love.” “You’re out of your mind, Potter.” He stated with a big smile on his lips, eyes crinkling and a dimple showing. “I’m mad for you. Only you.” Draco’s eyes shined with so much love that his breath was taken away. He kissed him again, this time on those beautiful and tempting lips, tasting earl grey tea and lemon tart. It was slow and deep, Draco wrapped his arms around his neck, bouquet still in hands, and surrendered in his arms.
“You lucky I love it too.” And just like that, he wrapped his lips around his cock, pushing down the foreskin to reveal the throbbing head. Surprisingly not, Draco played with his gland, tongue teasing his little cleft, making him grit his teeth in a desperate attempt to maintain control over his body.
“Oh God,” Whispered Harry between a kiss, “You’re so tight.” “Lose me up, then.” He panted out, short-breathed by the never-ending kisses. The momentary lack of oxygen made him light-headed and his whole body soft and pliant. Harry’s body was hot under his and he felt his heart pumping warm-lust blood in every vein, temperature rising at every touch and kiss.
The last bouquet, wrapped in white paper and a red ribbon, consisted exactly of thirty-six Marcel Pagnol red roses, of a beautiful velvety red currant red and with the intoxicating scent of raspberry. Even Harry, who knew absolutely nothing about flowers, was impressed by the beauty of those flowers. He only hoped that they were enough to leave Draco speechless.
Held against his chest with strong protective arms, soaking in the bathtub, Draco did not feel the need to hear those three words, because sometimes actions were louder than words. But he did feel the need to say them to Harry, to let him know how much he appreciated him. How much he loved him.
“You’re insatiable.” Cried Harry, voice thick with lust. “Sue me.” He bit back, a teasing smile ghosting his lips. “You’re going to be the death of me, Malfoy. How many times I have to make you come until you’re satisfied? My dick will fall off.” “Now, we don’t want that, don’t we? Besides, I’m still too sore from yesterday, even my ass needs a little of rest if I want to be able to walk at all today.” Draco moaned softly as Harry sucked on his weak spot, right above the collarbone. “What do you have in mind?” “Put the pancakes under statis charm and then met me in the shower.” Harry smile was a mix of malice and tenderness that was simply fatal. “I love you.” Draco’s heart skipped a beat, the traditor, as if it was the first time, he had heard those words. But in his defense, Harry had a way to make him feel so special and loved, that it was simply a natural reaction. Nobody could be strong enough to remain impassible when those eyes looked at you the way they were looking at him. After all, he was just mortal.
“I’m going deeper, now.” Announced Potter after a while, voice strained with pleasure. Right on cue, his dick hit the back of his throat and went a little deeper. The action sent shivers down his spine and straight to his dick, which he finally touched with relief, jerking off at the same rhythm of Potter’s thrusts. Little by little, Draco found himself swallowing all of him once again, nose in his pubes, throat tightening around his girth.
Once he was in the master bedroom, he made his way to the bathroom. It was one of his favourite rooms in the house. With a walnut wooden floor, elegant carpets, green floral wallpaper, deep green furniture, with golden details, and some plants in the corners, it was easy on the eye and helped to relax.
.” Longbottom hummed in acknowledge.
Harry liked to rim Draco until he would come almost untouched, rutting desperately on the sheets, or finger him while sucking him off. He would release the most delicious sounds. Draco’s breathy moans were so hot that when he would come, Harry would be so hard that his cock would hurt.
“The view is really nice.” He admitted without thinking. “Yes, it is. But it has nothing on you.” It was a cliché, but it still managed to make his heart flutter with glee. “Shouldn’t you say it while looking at me?” “I don’t need to see you to know how beautiful you are. You always are. Even when my eyes are closed.” It was too early for Harry to be that smooth and all Draco could do was surrender to the sweet tongue of his soon to be husband. Something, he guessed, he had to learn to live with. If Love was a war, he was happy to declare defeat.
“Draco…” Came a breathless voice that he could have recognized among a thousand. He spun around and before him there he was. With his long hair tied in a messy bun, golden glasses framing his eyes and dressed in all leather, Harry was a sight to behold. He was wearing a long black dragonhide coat, with jagged and ruined edges. An elaborate verdant leather waistcoat hugged his wide chest, with four belts on the front and the silver buckles shined softly under the light of the torches on the walls. Underneath all that, a simple black turtleneck, which Draco envied so much at that exact moment, now shivering with cold.
His patience was repaid when he stepped into the showers section. Auror Hussain stepped out of the shower, dripping wet, cock in full display swinging between his legs as he took his towel and started to dry himself, not noticing his look of appreciation. He thanked every god above, as that image would have come in handy once he was home, alone in his bed. He could feel his cock filling under his towel, but not enough to become a problem.
“Thanks, even if I don’t understand what’s so funny.” He shook his head. He knew he was sporting a besotted expression, but he could not help it. “Don’t mind me. I guess I’m just excited for today.” “Speaking of which, I’m afraid I should get up, if I want to make it to work. Not everybody can be Head Auror and decide when to take days off, can’t we?” Draco huffed unhappy. It was evident he was not thrilled to spend their special day at work and Harry almost felt sorry for his boyfriend. Almost, because it was all part of his surprise. Just the thought made his heart race.
Reluctantly, he broke the kiss, biting for good measure Potter’s bottom lip. “Do you think you’re ready to fuck my mouth?” “Everything you want.” Three words that almost felt like a physical touch. Potter stood up, cock still hard as steel throbbing in front of his face, shiny with saliva and precum. “If it gets too much, tap my leg three times.” Instructed Potter, to with he simply nodded. He felt a cushioning charm settling under his knees. Another of Potter amazing thoughtful wandless spells.
“It’s also the second biggest part of you.” He almost snorted. Bet on his boyfriend to make a dirty joke about his big ass heart.  Merlin, he really loved him.
In the past, he would have felt extremely uncomfortable and embarrassed, laying there, still and completely naked knowing that someone was checking out his body. For much of his life, Harry had been too thin and skinny. The Dursleys fed him what he needed, not a bite more or a single gluttony for pleasure. Only at Hogwarts he began to eat portions better suited to a growing boy, but they were unable to erase the eleven years of malnutrition suffered. Then the war took place, where the last thing on his mind was gorging himself on food. Even after the conflict, the trauma of all the losses he suffered was too much for him to concentrate on his physical well-being.
With half-lidded eyes, Draco watched the man he loved getting lost in the pleasure, wrapping around them like a warm blanket. Pride swelled in his chest as he was the one who could render one of the most powerful wizards mad with lust. He made sure to make it good for Harry, maintaining a constant rhythm and squeezing around him every time he sunk low to the very base, obtaining in return the hottest of sounds.
Maybe he followed his rules better than he thought, which he should have been happy about, but really was not. Trying to find a rational answer to the big, (or small, who knew?) mystery hiding beneath Potter’s towel, he concluded that there had simply never been a suitable opportunity. It had always been busy in the locker room since they were trainers and while his little hobby did start at the time, he had also been busy restoring his family name. That explanation pleased his mind. He had just to be more observant and catch the man while he was changing. Yes, it was perverted. Did he care? Not really. Again, he had never been a saint after all. Besides, a little bit of curiosity never killed anybody, right?
“I love you.” He whispered helpless, too gone to understand what was leaking from his mouth. “I love you too… Even more if you resume the speed of a few moments ago.” Harry laughed amused. Bet on his needy bottom of a boyfriend to ruin the moment. “As you wish.” He speeded up once again, breathing heavily on Draco’s neck and kept the pace until the man under him started to mutter meaningless words. His clue that Draco was near to come. The perk of having a vocal partner during sex.
Time went by, and later on, Draco would have been impressed by both of them to discover they managed to go on for almost half an hour. Half an hour of delightful time-consuming sensual sex. No wonder, though, cause their speed had been so leisurely that for a moment he thought it would have not been enough to take Harry over the edge.
Potter’s eyes were incredibly intense behind his golden frames, almost quivering with trepidation. He saw burning desire and want. So much want, he thought he was going to get eaten whole. But Potter was not the only one desperate for a bite, and since he was still alive, it was enough to think Potter did not actually dislike the attention. In for a penny…
As always, Draco’s heart skipped a beat, and his knees dangerously went weak. Potter was the most gorgeous human being in that whole building.
Waking up all alone on a Sunday morning, was never pleasing. Especially, when your body was still sore from a long and mind-blowing night of sex with your tough boyfriend, who happen to be hung like a hippogriff. Where was his love and attention? He expected to be woken up by strong arms around his waist, kisses on the nape of his neck and a lot of cuddles, like most of the mornings when both Harry and he managed to have days off simultaneously. Those were the best days.
It was not until a couple of days later, after they regained the ability to be in the presence of each other without ending up naked on the floor or a piece of furniture, that they resumed one of their most intimate rituals.
“Malfoy, I’m coming!” Cried out the man, balls deep in his mouth, as he emptied till the last drop of cum down his throat. It was too much, too intense, and Draco’s orgasm burst, setting his whole body on fire. He came between Potter’s feet, surfing the weave of pleasure till the very end, the movement of his hand fast and desperate. Balls completely dry, heart fulfilled to the brim.
He had almost forgotten about his own cock, throbbing between his legs, until Harry’s hand made its way between their bodies, grabbing his dick and stroking with matching speed. With that, Draco’s mind went dizzy with pleasure. The touch on his desperate dick and the way Harry’s stroked at every thrust his sweet spot, all of that at an incredibly slow pace, was delicious. Like drinking in little sips the most expensive of wines, getting unhurriedly drunk, until the last drop of fluid pleasure was gone.
Just like that, he slid up the long slick shaft and back down with exasperating slowness. They put aside the bickering and the only sounds filling the room were the heavy breaths and little moan escaping from their lips. Harry let him pick the pace and just accompanying his movements with small thrusts of his hips. They were in perfect sync and the world disappeared for the time being. Harry’s face was buried in his chest, leaving sloppy kisses on his burning skin. Where had his glasses gone? Another display of wandless magic. Had Harry even noticed, or did he just do it without realizing? And why did he find all that so irresistible?
He gave a good lick from base to head, his tongue flat against the rock-hard shaft, but incredibly smooth. Potter shivered at his action, leaning back and hands in a strong grip on the edges of the bench. It was only the beginning. He wanted to make Potter scream his name while he came from his mouth, see him lost in pleasure, panting and moaning for more. He wanted to make it so good for Potter, blow him out of his fucking mind, that he would fuck his mouth like a beast.
Longbottom let out a long-pained sigh. “You two are so unnecessarily dramatic. You know?” Draco frowned in confusion. “What do you mean?” The prick had the audacity to roll his eyes. Roll his eyes at him! “That you two are acting as if the whole situation is a tragedy. This is your first big fight. Every couple has to go through it, soon or later, and you two are no exception.” “But I hurt him! About his parents, for crying out loud!” He complained, with a mix of anger and guilt in his voice.
“By the way, do you know where my glasses went? I think I vanished them but I’m not sure where.” He could feel Harry squeeze his eyes in an attempt to see but miserably failing. “No idea, but here’s a deal: if you take a quick shower with me to clean us from all the stickiness and then have a long relaxing bath with me, I’m going to help to find them.” He knew he could have asked for something more selfish, and his Slytherin side was a little disappointed, but the afterglow always made him sappy and cuddly, besides, it was all his well-fucked brain could think of. “I don’t see why I should say no. Deal.”
He was so lost in their mind-blowing make-out session, that he noticed the oiled finger slipping between his cheeks only when it pressed against his hole, light and teasing. The silent display of wandless magic made his heart skip a beat and his dick throb so hard it hurt.
He did not stop working Potter until he felt the muscles under his palms stiffen and Potter adverting him, like a true gentleman, of his imminent orgasm. One second later, Draco stopped his administration and prevented Potter from coming with a firm grip on the base of his cock, which caused a loud frustrated whine from the man.
The man obeyed, standing up abruptly and almost gouging his eyes out with his stupid huge cock. “Watch out! You almost made me blind!” And maybe it was a little dramatic, but the threat of that thing was not to be underestimated. “Sorry, sorry! Did I hurt you?” He kneeled, taking his face in his calloused hands, that managed to be kind and held him with a tenderness that made his poor heart grew too big for his chest. “Don’t’ fret, Potter. A cock isn’t enough to kill me. Even if yours could have defeated Voldemort on its own.” His attempt at a joke did not seem to be appreciated by the man, whose expression remained covered with concern.
He heard a distant whisper as if it had ridden the wind from a faraway place. At first, he could not distinguish what the voice said, but he could sense the warmth dripping from the tone. “Draco… Draco, wake up…” Called a man voice, deep and velvety. As he slowly emerged from his slumber, he felt a gentle touch on his face. He nuzzled into the big hand and a sweet smile played over his lips. “Draco, are you awake?” He managed to produce a sound, that sounded too much like a purr for his taste, as an answer. Harry chuckled in his deep baritone voice, that always succeeded in stirring the butterflies in his stomach. “It’s almost lunchtime. Do you want to sleep some more?”
It was so intimate the concept of shaving someone in his most private parts. More than kissing, more than sex. It was thrilling and erotic. Or at least that what Draco tried to make of it. Harry usually acted like a kid who did not get the memo. Smearing shaving cream on Draco’s face or telling some stupid crass joke, that always managed to steal a laugh from him. Once, he even smacked his face with his stupid cock, something so out of character for Harry, that leaved Draco gobsmacked, and his expression must have been hilarious because the man almost fell from the chair out of laughter.
“I can feel it.” “It doesn’t make any sense! That’s the most useless and reckless thing you could do right now…”  Draco knew he was right, but he could not help the storm of emotions inside him that made him completely irrational. “Well, after all, I’m in love with the king of recklessness, aren’t I?”
Draco picked up the gold band with his long fingers. “This, is for you.” He declared, taking his hand and slipping the ring into his finger, which magically adapted in a perfect fit. “So, this is yours…” Harry stated, picking up the platinum ring and put it on Draco. They intertwined their hands so the rings would be side by side. “Who would have thought you had such a great taste. I’m starting to rub off on you.” Teased Draco, his eyes twinkling with glee. “You really like them?” His tone showed how relieved he was more than he would have liked to. Draco brought his hand to his mouth and kissed the ring. “They’re perfect. The best gift I ever received. Now I feel bad for what I had in store for you.” He looked down, not meeting his eyes, his cheeks deepening in colour. God, he loved a flustered Draco.
“So, you’re telling me I could have stayed in the Great Hall and you would have come to me?” Harry nodded. “Yes, of course. I would follow you everywhere, Malfoy.” Then he leaned in, catching once again Draco’s lips in a languid kiss, their mouths and tongues moving with expertise. A slow and sensual dance imprinted in their bones. As natural as breathing.
“I must confess, I was rather disappointed when I woke up all alone in a cold bed.” He could feel the smile on Harry’s lip even without seeing it. “I’m sorry, love. I thought to surprise you and bring you breakfast in bed, but you beat me.” Draco watched over his lover’s shoulder and saw the wooden tray filled with a plate full of vanilla pancakes with chocolate and blueberries and two cups of coffee.
*****
Then he got dressed, starting with the skin-tight black velvet pants, following with the white shirt, featuring a deep neckline decorated with volant, giving a generous view of his chest. He put on the mid-thigh high leather boots, before putting on the highlight of the whole look: a beautiful simple velvet corset with satin details, which emphasized his slender waist, making his shoulders appear broader. With the help of magic, he tightened the corset until he started to have a slight difficulty to breath. Beauty is pain, as Pansy would tell him about wearing ridiculous high stiletto heels. He picked up the heavy dark velvet cape and walked in front of the full-length mirror on the wall, throwing it back and wearing it sideways, over the right shoulder and under the left armpit. He charmed the knot to last all night, so he would not have to worry about it unravelling.
“And also modest! You’re really the whole package, aren’t you, Malfoy?” “Modesty is for saints and losers. I’m am neither of those, unlike you.” His eyes followed a drop of water running down Potter’s body and he had to physically stop himself from licking it away. Never in his life would he have thought he would be jealous of a drop of water. He chastised himself for his weakness, returning to meet Potter's gaze.
“I told you to wear something comfortable and casual.” Stated Harry, sounding resigned but fond at the same time. He arched a blond brow, a grin twisting his lips. “Hello? Have you met me? This is the most casual you’ll ever get from me. Better put your heart at peace, Potter.” He took the helmet Harry was handing him and wore it. He straddled the motorbike and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, resting his chin on his shoulder. “Hold tight.” Said Harry, wearing his helmet and starting the engine. And he did just that, holding onto Harry as his life depended on it. As they set off, he tried to concentrate on the feeling of his body against Harry’s and not his fear of that infernal ramshackle. The things he did for love.
“That’s not what I meant. I was just afraid mother did not give her blessing. That’s all.” “Oh. She did. She kissed me.” He blubbered incoherently, to which Draco chuckled and he felt his cheeks get hot. He was making a fool of himself. “I hope not on the lips.” “No, on the cheeks.” Draco hummed. “Good. I’m the only one who can kiss you. Those lips are officially mine now. Forever.” He turned his gaze to the rings and stared for a few second in complete silence. They two jewels were a pair, a yellow gold band studded with emeralds and a platinum band covered with rubies. They were thin and elegant, and Harry thought they were the perfect union of the two of them. They would thus wear both the respective colour of their own house and of the other.
Unfortunately, the show did not last long, as the man hid his body with a burgundy towel. Draco almost screamed but was stopped by the last bit of sanity in him. Before Potter could notice him staring, he turned to his locker, picking out a new pair of underwear and socks, while generating a generous space in his memory for Potter's butt.
He went back to his bed and retrieved the pair of black velvet opera gloves that he wore over his shirt. There was no denying that he looked good. It was polished and sexy, his legs seemed endless thanks to the boots, his waist was snatched, his pale neck and collarbones tempting. The only colour in the whole outfit was the deep emerald green of the silk lining of the cape, providing an elegant combination with the black.
He took a couple of slow and deep breaths, trying desperately to calm down and not let his anxiety ruin the moment. He needed to follow his heart and trust himself. He knew that Draco loved him and even if he was not ready to get married, all he had to do, was wait and ask him again in a couple of years. They would still be together, live in the same house and wake up in each other’s arms. Everything would have been all right.
The charm only helped a bit and, as he looked around, he noticed for the first time in a while, how impersonal and dark his chambers were. Not that it was his fault, he tried his best to furnish the place with new furniture, changing the carpets, curtains and paintings. At first, he had been rather proud of the results, but now, after spending most of his time in Harry’s rooms, the difference was painfully evident.
Invisible to the muggles, they flew over the roof’s houses, leaving the busy London at their backs. As soon as they reached the countryside, they landed back on road, making sure nobody was around to take notice. Again on solid ground, Draco felt the tension in his shoulder mitigate and found himself able to finally open his eyes, that he had not noticed he had closed.
After the initial stretch, he got to enjoy the slow descent. Hot, thick and hard flesh, skin so smooth it felt divine against his sensible entrance. The sensation of Harry’s freshly shaved dick sliding deep inside him was, as always, glorious. The contrast between the silky skin and the roughness of his hardness was maddening. He bit down his lip, as he finally seated in Harry’s lap, feeling the tingling of his pubes under his perineum.
A last sweep under his balls and he was done. With a wet warm towel, he took great care to clean him from the cream left, managing Harry’s cock like the most precious treasure in the world. Checking his work, he felt his mouth watering at his already impressive boyfriend’s cock, looking even bigger with his pubes trimmed and, shaft and balls perfectly hairless.
“Good morning, sleeping beauty.” Teased the man, as Draco made his way into the room, walking around the desk and stopping in front of him. Harry looked at him with brows frowned and a curious glint in his eyes. “What?” Without a word, he opened Harry’s arm and straddled his lap, wrapped his arms over his shoulders and nuzzled his face into his neck. Finally, home.
He felt himself blush and furrow his brows in a little scowl, because while before it was just flirting, now the admission seemed much more than just appreciation for a male body. It made him feel vulnerable and defensive. “Yes, I do… what about it? As I said, I’m certainly not the first to tell you…” “Well, you see, when people fawn over you for the silliest of things, it’s difficult to say if they mean it, or just want a piece me, a night with me so they can run off to the bloody Daily Prophet and have their five minutes of fame…” He took a pause, looking unsure, “That’s… that’s not what you’re doing… right?” Draco scoffed affronted. “I don’t give a fuck about the Daily Prophet! What I want, is for you to throw away that fucking towel and let me suck your cock!” His irritation seemed to entertain Potter, who flashed him a smug grin.
“You saying yes it’s already the best gift I could have ever wanted.” Draco rolled his eyes at his cheesy words. “You’re such a sap it’s disgusting.” He was not very convincing with the besotted smile he had plastered all over his face. “Well, you’re going to marry Mr. Sappiness, so you better get used to it.” He bit back cheekily. “I guess, I could. Luckily, Mr. Sappiness is looking smoking hot in his suit. So much, in fact, that I wish he could take me home and let me ride him, while still dressed. Too bad I still need to work.” Draco thought he was being an evil tease, but he did not know he had another ace up his sleeve. “It sounds very tempting. So, it’s really convenient I have asked your boss to give you the day off.” Draco looked at him gobsmacked. “You did what?” “Since the start, you had the day off. I just asked the hospital to make you come so I could surprise you.” Draco expression morphed into one that Harry would only have descripted as mischievous. “Maybe the black corset and the lingerie I bought aren’t going to be wasted.” He purred, voice dripping with sex. Harry’s dick gave an interest twitch at the mention of the sensual garments. He imagined Draco, riding him while wearing knickers and the beautiful contrast between the black and his light skin. Was it lace or silk? Did he also buy stockings and a garter belt? Merlin and Morgana! He hoped so!
Only after many minutes under the hot stream of water, he realized he was still smiling like a fool. He scowled at the tile wall, scrubbing with energy his armpits. What he was not going to do was spending his time thinking about Potter and his glorious body. But just as he thought formed in his head, images of his toned and virile body flashed in front of his eyes. Damn it. In the last ten minutes, he had broken two of his precious rules. Precious rules that were set for his own mental health: don’t look too much at a naked Potter and don’t think about him naked. While he failed those rules more than he would like to admit, the only consolation was that at least he tried. But he was weak and gay, while Potter was strong and hot. It had been a lost battle since the start.
No need to say, the last two months had been rather hectic. Between their works, the preparation for the engagement party and the party himself, and the reporters that had harassed them for weeks for an exclusive, they had almost no time to just enjoy their new status. It was unfair. Though he had had a good time at their party, surrounded by friends and family, he missed having little dates with Harry. A walk in the park, taking Teddy to somewhere, going to a nice café to taste a new popular cake or tea. Simple things, but that he found to be the most valuable.
With heart racing and sweaty palms, he opened their walk-in closet, where on his side rack, concealed under his invisibility cloak, was a garments bag, containing an accurately chosen suit by Pansy herself. She was one of the few who know about his intention to propose to Draco. He remembered like it was yesterday, when he requested her to meet him without mention anything to the blond man.
He slightly got better in the years he had been in a relationship with Draco, starting to wear more fitted clothes and ditching hoodies and jeans as his to-go outfit. Draco said they did nothing for his great physique and, in retrospection, he was right. The only thing his lover seemed to approve of his old wardrobe, was his leather jacket. Not that he would have thrown it away if it was not so. It was Sirius’ and it was one of his most treasured possessions.
A few tears escaped Draco’s eyes and he dried them with his thumps, stroking gently the soft skin.
Sitting with his knees spread, he took out his fingers and put his hands under Draco’s thighs, lifting him and positioning his legs around his waist. He lined up his already lubricated cock and pushed gently the head over the ring of muscles. They both gasped and then moaned loudly in harmony.
Harry took a look around the familiar place with white walls, a wooden floor, various bookshelves, the chairs for the patients and the coffered desk that had seen more action that it was supposed to. He took out his wand and set to work.
A little gasp escaped from him, as the fingertip popped through the ring of muscle. Harry took his time before sink all the way to his knuckles and he clenched around his finger, hungry and desperate for more.
“Your shoulders are wide and solid. I love the way they fill your clothes, especially your Auror uniform… Those shoulder were strong enough to carry the weight of the whole world, even before becoming so muscular.” Draco trailed up his body, nibling at his shoulders, sending little shivers of pleasure down his spine. His cock was getting harder and harder and his willpower was wavering. It was too early to surrender, besides, he liked where it was going.
As they looked into each other eyes, their lips soon met again, as being pulled by an invisible force. The kisses were so heavy with love, that he was getting drunk on them. He could taste tears on Draco’s lips, and he could not tell whose they were. After a while he pulled back, as Draco followed his lips in an adorable attempt to continue the kiss. “Why did you stop?” He inquired breathlessly. Harry smiled pleased by the desire in the other voice. “You have to choose the ring, so I can put it on you.” “Oh, right. I forgot about the rings.” Admitted in a whisper that Harry found so sweet and endearing that his heart throbbed with delight. He showed the rings to him, who looked intently at the two of them. “How come you don’t have the Malfoy family engagement ring? Did mother not want to give it to you?” He asked with a frown that indicated he was worried, and he felt his heart drop and blood go cold. He should have known better to choose by his own the rings. “Actually, I’m the one that refused the ring. I just thought we both needed something new. Something that was just us and nobody else. I’m sorry, I should have known better. If you prefer your family ring I can go back to your mother and ask her-“ His rambling was cut off by a soft kiss.
Draco leaned against the doorframe, crossing his legs and watching with light heart, Harry cooking, while singing and moving his hips along with the music.
“Listen Malfoy, it’s not my place to say it, but it’s obvious he loves you.” Draco froze in place and could taste his own heart on his tongue for a second. “What are talking about? How can you be so sure? Did he tell you?!”  He asked frenetically, on the verge of a meltdown. Longbottom gave him again that sly smile and he wanted to punch him right in the face. “No, he did not tell me anything, but there’s no need. He looks at you like you hung the sun, the moon and the whole night sky. He smiles like a fool when he’s with you and he never stop to talk about you when you’re not there.” He felt dizzy, his knees weak and the butterfly in his stomach going crazy. The corset might not have been a clever idea as he struggled to breath. He must have looked like a complete idiot, gaping like a fish out of water.
“I love the way it feels deep down my throat, while you fuck my mouth like you own it… I know you like to see my pretty lips stretched around your ridiculous girth, the tears in my eyes as I try to accommodate all of you… When I choke on your huge cock, you dirty bastard…” Well, when he put it like that, Harry could not disagree. He did love to have Draco on his knees for him, sucking his dick like it was the most delectable food on earth. He still remembered the expression of shock and lust the first time Draco saw him naked. The way his lover had licked his lips and his eyes had darkened with desire, worked wonders for his ego.
Walking out of the bathroom, a cloud of steam following his steps, wrapped in a soft emerald bathrobe and a towel around his head, Draco was still feeling on the verge of tears. He sat at his vanity and looked in the mirror, his skin was flushed red from the long hot bath he had just took, and his eyes were tired and glassy from the tears that had joined the water in the tub. He looked dreadful and felt as much.
He would slowly wake up, his senses focusing, Harry’s hard and warm body under him, their legs intertwined. The only sound he would hear Harry’s soft snores, something he should not have found so adorable, yet he did. He would rearrange himself against his boyfriend, head buried in his neck, front pressed on his side, his free arm around the wide torso, hugging him tenderly. He would fall asleep again and when he would wake up the second time, Harry would have his arm around Draco’s waist and his face snuggled in his hair. Harry would mumble a “good morning”, his voice still thick from sleep.
Harry’s were bathed in sun’s rays for most of the day, the wood was lighter in colour, giving the place a more homely vibe. Red curtains framed the wide windows with a beautiful view of the Dark Lake, and you could find personal belongings on every surface. It was a little bit messy, for Draco’s taste, but he loved it for that exact reason.
“Thank you. Thank you, so much. It’s the most beautiful surprise I ever received.” He whispered softly; voice thick with emotions. “I’m happy you like it. I was afraid it wouldn’t be enough.” He admitted shyly. Draco laughed, throwing his head back. Harry opened his eyes and saw the amusement on his face. “You have literally transformed my office a field of roses, Harry. It's incredible. You’re incredible, Harry Potter. I don’t know what I did to deserve you… I’m so thankful to have you. I love you." He melted at the sound of his voice, at the love dripping out of every word.
As he positioned on his side, so did Draco, a silent request to be hold, so they could cuddle. Harry took him into his arms, releasing a content sound at the sensation. It was no secret that he was a cuddler and while Draco pretended to dislike it, after three years together, he knew way better to be fooled by his terrible act.
Harry slipped a hand from under Draco's thigh, wrapping it around the other’s dripping cock, which had smeared with precum the flat and milky stomach. “Oh, God! Yes, yes! It’s so good, so damn good!” He felt his hole clenching around him, and it made Harry see stars. “God, you’re taking me so well, love… Your arse feels incredible… Always so thigh for me, you were gagging for my cock, weren’t you?” “Yes, yes! Give it to me, Harry! Fuck me into the mattress, I want to feel your fat cock all day today! Until I come home so I can ride you stupid!” Merlin, his mouth. His nasty lovely mouth. It drove him crazy. He fucked him as hard as he could, with deep and precise movements of his hips, hitting every time his sweet spot.
“I see… maybe I should be more direct, shouldn’t I?” He felt Potter’s breath on his neck, and he turned around, finding himself face to face with the man, who was sporting a smug smile. Smugness never looked hotter or more dangerous. His heart was beating so hard and loud, it was all he could hear. “What you’re doing, Potter?” “As I said, being direct…” Replied Potter, positioning his hands at the sides of Draco’s head, trapping him against the lockers. Green eyes piercing through his soul. He was going to die. At least the last thing before his eyes would have been Potter’s naked torso, wet with sweat. There were worse ways to perish.
His cheeks were cold from their speed and the cold air blowing against them, but he did not care. He found riding in the countryside without a real destination oddly romantic. He felt like they were in a world created especially for them, where nobody could interrupt them. Inside his chest grew the inexplicable yearning to ask Harry to continue driving to the horizon and beyond. To run away from everything and everyone. It was a crazy idea, but sometimes, it was all he wanted. Escape from his past, from Harry’s fame, from the press and from the ones that were against their relationship. Sometimes it was all too much, and he knew Harry felt the same, if not had it worst.
The sex had been simply godlike. Slow and sensual or hard and passionate, Harry never failed to make him scream, and beg for more. Deliciously hung, Harry fucked with his whole body and mind, leaving Draco, more often than not, limp and incapable of form any sentence with real meaning. And while their performances in the bedroom were, to say the least, impressive, what Draco loved the most were the little things. The secret smiles they shared in the Great Hall, in front of everybody; the furtive touches in the hallways, the way Harry could make him laugh and the other way around. How they would use their first names only when alone, waking up in the same bed, kissing goodnight and good morning. It was incredibly sapless from him, but as a Malfoy, he never had the chance to experience such things. But now, with the Malfoy name fallen in disgrace and his father in Azkaban, he had nobody stopping him from pursuing what he really wanted: being in a sweet tooth-rotting relationship with Harry Potter.
He wondered once again where he could have gone. Was Harry visiting his parents grave? Did he go to Weasley and Granger’s? But most importantly, was he feeling lonely? Did he need him? Did he need someone to hold him and remind him he was not alone? Maybe his heart was being selfish and arrogant, but it craved to be that special someone for Harry. Draco loved him. There was no point in denying it. He spent most of his time thinking about him, yearning his touch, his smiles and his eyes on him. The blond was aware he sounded crazy, but that was the truth. He was mad about the man.
He also made himself more conformable, sitting right next to Potter, their arms touching. “I just need a cup of tea with honey, and I’ll be all right.” His voice came out a little strained, but it was to be expected. “Here,” Potter, showing off once again his power, summoned a glass of water, that he handed to him. “It’s not tea, but it will help.” He drunk in big gulps, not really minding his poise. The cool fluid hydrated the dry walls of his throat and gave him some relief. “Thanks, I needed that.” “Don’t mention it.” A nice silence fell on them.
As his hands reached for the towel, Draco’s heart drummed in his chest, but his mind was fogged with euphoria and a little bit of madness. The burgundy fabric touched the floor and for a moment, the world stopped. Well, he had been dead wrong. Potter was not small or pierced. No. It was big. More than big actually, huge was the most appropriate term to describe it. And from the look of it, he was not even fully hard. He felt faint.
The hot water was a cure-all for his sore muscles, he could not wait to go home, wear one of his most comfortable pyjamas and drink a good glass of wine. Wrapped in a towel, he made his way to his locker, the noise of his slippers echoing at every step.
Taking a deep breath through his nose, he dived in, taking all of Potter’s huge cock, his nose finally touching his pubes, Potter’s scent was so strong that it hit him like a punch in the gut. A jolt of pleasure shook his whole body, which ended right on the tip of his cock, precum oozing onto the floor. “Holy shit!” Exclaimed Potter, hand coming to held Draco’s head, finger slipping in his hair in a surprisingly gentle touch. Draco’s eyes burned with tears as he struggled to keep Potter’s deep down in his throat, little gagging sounds escaping against his will.
“Hello, Potter.” He said in a bored tone, with as much nonchalance as he could master, even if his heart picked up the pace in his chest. “Hi there, Malfoy.” Answered with a tired smile the man. His bronze skin was glistering with sweat, and his hair was in a half-up ponytail. It was clear he was just done with his evaluation. Draco wished he could have done his evaluation. Just the two of them. No clothes were required.
In just half a year, his ex-nemesis had become his all and everything. But did Harry feel the same? Longbottom’s last words kept to buzzing in his head and before he knew what he was doing, he began to look for a plant in the crowd. It was not difficult to find him, being one of the tallest men in the room, leaves excluded. He was looking over the dancefloor from the right side of the stage, where the band was now playing loud and energetic music.
An amused smile stressed his lips. It had surely been a long way coming for Kreacher to become so amenable. He still remembered how Harry cried about the gruffness of the old house-elf, who had refused to leave the house when given the opportunity but also refused to follow Harry’s directives.  Apparently, none of the Golden Trio knew that the bond between a house-elf and the house itself could be so powerful that the condition of the second could affect the other's behaviour and health. Grimmauld had been uninhabited for so long that Kreacher started to age as well and his mood mirrored the state of the house. Therefore, when Harry started to renovate the house, eliminating every single ounce of dark magic, which took a whole month and three Unspeakable, and infusing new glory to the house, Kreacher changed. Nothing too dramatic, but his posture became straighter, his voice a little less hoarse, his magic stronger and his attitude more positive. Not that now he was a ray of sunshine, but he was clearly satisfied with the house renovations and content to take care of it.
He cleared his throat and let his heart lead his tongue. “I love you. I love everything about you, even what at first I found annoying, I ended up falling in love with it. I love how grumpy you are in the morning if you don’t get your dose of cuddles. I love the way you prepare tea, even if you tease me for my childlike taste, you never fail to make it perfectly sugary and milky. I love when you bring me lunch on your days off to my office, so we can eat together. I love how much passion and dedication you put in your work. I admire you every single day for what you accomplish, for all the lives you save daily. It’s the reason we met, and I thank every god above that I ended up in St Mungo’s that day.”
“I love how masculine your chest is. I know you’re a little insecure about how hairy you are, but you should know by now how much it turns me on. I love the feeling of our chests pressed together. My skin will burn for a little while after and it drives me crazy…” Draco sucked on his nipple and Harry almost groaned in frustration, because it was not enough. His dick was fully hard, laying on his stomach enquiring attention. “But I also love it because it’s the home of your heart. I’ve never met a man or a woman with a kinder heart than yours… It’s compassionate and forgiving…” The fact that Draco was managing to arouse and making him emotional at the same time was simply maddening. Harry was crossed between fuck him into the mattress and get on one knee and ask him to marry him. Luckily, he was ready for both.
“Wow.” Breathed stunned Harry and it made him chuckle into his neck. “Always so eloquent.” He teased, feeling a tender smile tugging his lips. “It’s not my fault if you rode me stupid.” Bit back his boyfriend, pressing a kiss against his temple. A gesture so simple and innocent, after all they did, but that it made him blush nonetheless.
He took off his clothes, putting them in the laundry hamper, wand in hand. As he approached the tub, he noted that Kreacher had been so quick that the white clawfoot tub was already filled with hot water and foam. From the scent, he could tell that the elf had used Harry’s favourite bath salts, cinnamon and orange blossoms. He was more of a vanilla or lavender type of guy, but he knew how much Harry loved when he smelled like autumn. He would nuzzle into his neck at any given time, so he could smell him and leave little kisses over his skin. It never failed to make his heartache with adoration.
He was almost about to surrender to his boyfriend, when Draco stopped his administration and popped his dick out of his mouth. Cold uncomfortable air hit his wet skin, but he was curious to see what the men had in mind. Without a word, Draco climbed up his body and pressed their bodies together. Their dicks slid against each other and he felt Draco’s precum wetting his stomach. For some unknown reason, Harry’s heart started to beat faster and his body shivered in anticipation.
A knock on the door took him by surprise, making him jump on his feet and almost squeal. Almost. He still had a little bit of dignity left after all. “I’m coming.” He said with his heart in his throat.
Physical touch was something really important in their relationship. On one hand, there was Harry, who had been touch starved since a kid, on the other, there was him, a child raised by pureblood standard. Which meant, that he had no model of reference for that side of a relationship. He could count them on his fingers the times he saw his parents in love attitudes. Needless to say, the first attempts between Harry and him had been rather clumsy and awkward. At some point, Draco had grown tired of the situation and had Harry sat down for a talk. So, he had discovered that Harry ached contact, but did not know how to ask for it, and he explained his upbringing and how it fucked up his notion of romantic interactions. That conversation was what they had needed to relax around each other. They had started slow, holding hands while walking around Muggle London, their feet touching under the table and innocent cheek kisses. Now, they were so comfortable with each other that they did not care if they were in public or not. They would steal quick kisses on the lips if they felt the need, hands would find their place on thighs under tables, Harry arm would often be around his waist, a little demonstration of possessiveness that drove Draco crazy. When at home, Draco had no problem to find a place in Harry’s lap, demanding cuddles, and Harry was always more than happy to deliver.
God, he was so unfairly good-looking. He had manly features, a strong jaw and a thin layer of beard shadowing his face. Without his glasses, his eyes were so green and vibrant, they were almost too much to look at. He had let his hair grow in the past years and who would have guessed that length was the answer to give a sense to that mess of a hairstyle. He loved and hated it at the same time. Loved it because it was maddening hot, especially when he tied it up in a messy bun or a low ponytail. Hate it, because he was dying to put his hands into those beautiful curls. He would have sold his mother for a chance of doing that and it spoke volumes because he loved his mother very much. He hoped that the smile with which he smiled back at Potter was not as awkward as it felt on his lips.
In Harry’s arms, dancing in their kitchen in a world of their own, Draco thought he could not be happier. He was actually overwhelmed by how much love he was feeling at the moment, the bad mood of before completely forgotten. His heart was beating loud and fast, but it always did when he was near Harry. In the early days of their relationship it scared him to death, because he was so dangerously in love with the man that if they would ever break up, he would simply fall in pieces and never recover.
“What are you trying to say?” The man lowered his hands and gave him an exasperated, but fond look. “What I’m trying to say is, you’re not the only one who made the mistake of trying to cheer up Harry during this period of the year or try and make him forget, for a couple of hours, the death of his parents. We didn’t know better. We assumed, in our naivety, it was what he needed. But it wasn’t. He got angry with us, said some regretful words and then came back to apologize for it the day after. Now we know better. He likes to spend the day remembering and not forgetting. Usually, he goes to anybody who had known his parents and asks them to tell him anything they remember about them, even the most insignificant of the particulars. That’s what he craves and needs.” Draco felt his eyes burning but kept the tears under control. Crying in front of him would have been simply humiliating. “He could have just told me so. I would have understood. Even if I’m a, and I quote, an
Even with his eyes closed, Harry could feel the weight of Draco’s gaze on him, and he knew it was full of adoration and lust. “Harry… You’re so gorgeous. I will never get tired of soaking in the sight of your body…” Draco was talking like he had honey in his throat. His voice as soft and teasing as a silk scarf brushed over his hot skin. He loved being drowned in Draco’s praises, as Draco did. It was a shared kink of them, probably caused by the lack of parental approval in their youth, if he had to have a wild guess.
Longbottom gave him a comforting smile, proving he knew what had happened between the two of them, at a certain extent at least, but had the grace to change topic.
Draco tried his hardest to hold back the tears, but a traitorous one escaped, nevertheless. “It’d be my pleasure.” He answered lifting his head and giving him a kind smile. Harry kissed him kindly and slowly. “Thank you. It means a lot.” He kissed him soft and tender, and the simple gest opened the gates of his eyes. Silent tears fell down his cheeks, surely smearing his makeup. Not that Draco cared. He was once again in Harry’s arms. He loved him back and wanted to meet his parents. Draco was overwhelmed with emotions.
His rambling was cut short by strong arms around his waist and a hot mouth on his. He needed a moment to understand what was happening, in which his body had already reacted, kissing back and wrapping his arms around Harry's neck. Harry was kissing him. Kissing him as he had never done before. As if he needed it to breathe, taking away Draco’s breath instead. Draco could not think of doing anything else other than kiss Harry back with just as much passion. Pressing his body against Harry's, as if they were melting into one.
He did not expect to find another person at the lockers, less of all, a shirtless Potter. Draco pondered his choices: backing off and watch from around the corner, like a creep, the man getting naked, or making his presence known. But before he could choose, Potter seemed to sense Draco’s presence and turned to look at him.
“So good, so fucking good for me, love…” He muttered as he was approaching conclusion, his balls rising and his mind going blank. “You fucked me so good, Harry… Come for me, fill me with your come…” Draco mewl into his ear and it was enough to push him over the edge. His body tensed and his cock throbbed inside the warm and tight hole, coming with force and emptying his cum till the last drop. He rode the wave of pleasure through and through, with strong and deep thrusts, embracing the burning feeling in his low abdomen and cock. His body shivered from the intensity of his orgasm and gave up, making him fall, with all his weight, over Draco, who huffed at the impact.
Out of the shower and dried up, they made their way back to the bedroom, where Draco dressed up in his healer robes and Harry pretended to be busy doing the bed. Subtle. Really, like a dragon in the middle of London. He needed to calm his nerves.
“I don’t know if it’s too soon, but would you like to come to my place?” “Now?” Asked surprised Draco, heart skipping a beat. “Yes, maybe we could take a shower here, then go to mine. I can cook dinner, offer you a cup of tea and honey, and maybe…” The rest he whispered it into Draco’s ear, voice deep and seductive, and he could feel blood rush to his dick one again at Potter’s filthy propositions, and this time even his arsehole twitched his approval. That man was going to be the death of him.
They both went limp, tired by their performance and dazed by their orgasms. They were sweaty and sticky, but Draco did not care. He nuzzled Harry’s neck and kissed him there, as a hand came to stroke his back with soothing touches. Even if they took their sweet time, they still were panting, so they stood in silence for a couple of minutes, catching their breaths and cuddling.
“Watch your tongue, professor. What would say Lovegood if she heard you? She would think you were trying to flirt with me.” Gasped Draco in mocking disbelief. Longbottom’s loud laughter filled the castle. “Don’t worry about Luna! If she was here, she would agree with me. Who I should be afraid of, would be Harry. He’s rather the jealous type. At least for you. One time, I saw him throw a wandless and wordless jinx at a man who was eye-fucking you at the Three Broomsticks.” “Really?” He asked surprised. He had never noticed any jealous behaviour from Harry, but maybe he had been too busy ogling at him.
For a gay man, the men Aurors’ locker room was like a meat market. Or at least that was what Draco liked to think. While the stench of so many sweaty men altogether, especially at the end of a long day of work in the field, was not pleasant in the slightest, he did enjoy the display of muscles and flesh.
He tightened the belt of his ice-blue silk nightgown, as he kneeled in front of Harry, who watched with a predatory glint in his eyes every movement. Placing his hands on his knees, he made him open wide. Eyes locked together. Without a word, Harry opened his bathrobe. Draco drunk in the glorious view of the man, all beautiful light dark skin covering the strong muscles of his chest, abs and legs. Dark hair obscured his broad torso and a tantalizing happy trail led to his low abdomen, where, between bushy and wild curls, rested his cock. That stunning thick and long cock that drove him crazy like anything else. Seven inches soft and nine hard, no matter its state, it was always, in a single word, impressive. Such artwork deserved a better frame, something more prime and polished, to emphasize its beauty.
Harry took several seconds to catch his breath and so did Draco, since all he could hear were their tired and heavy breaths. When he felt he had enough strength to move, he shifted so his body was not pressing down on his lover’s. He must have done a really good job to not receive a single complain from the blond, who usually told him to get off him because he was too heavy. Or maybe it was because it was their special day, but he had a feeling it was cause of both.
Draco walked down the stairs of Grimmauld Place, completely redecorated the moment Harry had asked him to come and live with him. As he approached the kitchen, he could hear music and Harry’s voice singing over the wireless. It was something muggle, since Draco had never heard the song before, he could tell the singer was a man and it was something retro, if Harry’s efforts to teach him something about muggle culture had not been in vain.
When they felt satisfied, they stopped kissing and simply rearranged themselves in a real hug, with Harry’s arms around his torso and Draco’s around Harry’s neck.
As usual, they did it in the bathroom. It has been a while since the last time. Harry had been away on a mission for some time and when he came back all they could think of was making up for the lost time. Kissing until they had no air in their lungs. Exploring each other’s bodies like the first time. They had never had so much sex, but in their defence, it had been the longest time they had spent away from each other. Two weeks when Draco had to sleep in an empty bed, touching himself as the only way to satisfy his sexual desire. So, as soon as Harry walked through the door, he could not control himself.
“Longbottom?” He asked confused. “Yes, it’s me.” Answered the professor of Herbology, lowering his arm. “I thought I'd stop by and see how you were doing, before heading to the ball.” As in every single instance concerning his feelings, his face fell into an unreadable mask. “I don't see why it should be otherwise.” His voice was bored and emotionless. However, Longbottom did not seem convinced by his little performance. He was one of the few to know about his relationship with Harry. Not by his will. The poor man had been just unlucky enough to open the wrong classroom door at the wrong time. It was not like they were trying to keep their involvement a secret, but they were trying to keep it from the press.
So, it was a little surprising to hear Draco being so vocal and sappy. It made Harry’s whole-body melt in love. Well, except for one “stiff” part. “Now, where were we?” He could hear the smirk on his lover face and was almost about to give up, when Draco wrapped his long fingers around his cock and squeezed, making him gasp. Draco chuckled pleased by his reaction, knowing well that Harry was almost at his limit. That little shit.
“I love you too, sap.” “But I’m your sap.” Chuckled Harry and Draco felt his already wide smile becoming even more warm, his heart swelling as a balloon ready to explode in a rain of glitter. “Yes, you are.”
“Draco, what are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be at the ball?” Harry asked with a deep voice, startling him, lost in admiring how handsome his boyfriend was. “I was looking for you. I needed to find you.” He said foolishly, words falling from his lips. “That’s why you were running all around the castle?” Harry sounded confused, but he was not the only one. How could he know what he was doing? Oh. Right, his stupid magic map. If he had it, he would not have had to run around the castle as if he was possessed. Sometimes life really is not fair.
Open as wide as he could, he presented his mouth in offer. Soon the weight of Potter’s cock was once again on his tongue and strong but careful hands on both sides of his head, fingers interlocking with his blond hair. Potter started a little tentative, only thrusting half of his length in his mouth in slow motion, which was not bad since it gave Draco another chance to get used to the intrusion.
Potter turned back to him. “See you around, Malfoy.” “Good evening, Potter.” He watched as Potter walked away, sinking in the view of his broad shoulders, before getting in the same cubicle from where the man had walked out. He closed the door behind him and took off his towel to hand it over the door.
They kissed for what Draco guessed were long minutes. None of them tried to get some kind of friction or contact over their hardness. They just kissed. Long and deep. Like the word had stopped just for them, so they could enjoy every little movement of their mouths and tongues. Harry still tasted of the hot chocolate he had drunk earlier. It was sweet and decadent. His lips were a little bit chapped, but he loved the rough sensation on his skin. It helped to make everything feel more real, not only a dream in Draco’s mind.
He closed his mouth around the head and Potter moaned in relief. He swallowed what he could, not much as it had been a while since the last time he had blown a prick that big. By a rough estimation, he guessed Potter was eight and a half inches long, and thick. So fucking thick he had to stretch his mouth as wide as he could. A first-rate piece of meat, the finest in the whole Auror Department for sure.
Harry was awakened by feather-light kisses on the corner of his eye, and his mouth morphed automatically in a tender smile. He could feel the weight of his boyfriend laying on top of his left side. Naked skin against naked skin. The kisses shifted to his jaw, then to his neck, where he lingered a little more, nibling delicately right above one of his weak spots. “Harry…” Whispered onto his skin, his name almost sounded like a prayer from Draco’s lips. He tried to not react, curious to see how far his boyfriend would have gone to wake him up.
With strength coming from his hard Auror training, Harry stood up, holding Draco with strong hands under his thighs, still half-hard and balls deep inside him. He made his way to the shower, where he took care of him this time. Cleaning him from every single drop of come he had all over and inside him. Another little ritual of them, after he took care of Harry, they would reverse roles, letting Harry care for him instead. It never failed to melt his heart, the way Harry was so gentle and sweet, plastering little kisses on his face and shoulder as he washed him. The way he would prepare the bath just how he liked it, scorching hot water, lavender bath salts and a lot of bubbles.
“Maybe,” The man chuckled, pressing a soft peck on his lips. “But it’s because I feel we didn’t have enough time for each other in the past weeks.” At Harry words, he felt his heart grow lighter. “I was afraid I was the only one feeling that way.” He admitted softly while stroking the nape of Harry’s neck. Eyes locked together. “No, definitely, not. I missed you. Even if we live in the same house and sleep in the same bed, it seemed we did not have the time to enjoy each other company.” Harry mirrored his movement, eyes going tender with love. “I missed you too. Why don’t we do something this afternoon? Just the two of us.” “Are you asking me out, Malfoy?” Asked teasingly Harry, to which he could not help but smile. “Yes, I am, you dork. Are you free?” “For a date with my future husband? Always.” The world “husband” made Draco’s heart flutter. Merlin, he really could not wait to marry the man.
“I’m going to give you one thing: the flirting was subtle, it took me a while to catch on, but the staring was not. We’ve spent enough time at Hogwarts staring at each other that I can sense your eyes on me even in a room full of people. So, tell me: there something I can do for you, Malfoy?” He whispered low and deep, his voice slipping on his skin like warm honey. Since when did Potter become so secure of himself? Confidence suited the man. Maybe too much and Draco’s dick seemed to agree.
Draco kissed him tenderly, just an innocent peck on the lips and then whispered in his ear. His voice needy and thick with desire. “Please, Harry, fuck me.” And just like that, Harry’s last string of control snapped.
“The last who gets to the showers is a loser?” The grin on the other face was blinding. “Ready, set… go!” They both jumped on their feet and run, their laugh filling the lockers room. No towels around this time to hide Potter’s body away from Draco’s hungry eyes.
He attacked Draco’s pale neck, sucking and biting just the way he knew drove his lover batty. “Oh Harry… You’re a beast…” Cried in a deep voice Draco, who slipped his hand into his messy hair, and he could not help his mouth to twitch into a little smug smile. “You love it.” He whispered in a low voice, still dry from sleep. “Of course, I do, little arrogant bastard, I would also love to be fucked sometimes this morning if you don’t mind… Some of us need to go to work…” Bit back his lover with his usual sharp tone, just a little more breathlessly. “Feeling bossy, this morning, aren’t we?”
The steam of the hot water fogged the mirror and the green tiles of the walls. Harry sounded cheerful, humming in the shower, as he took out from the cabinet under the sink all they needed. Their first time came to his mind. Between arousing and excitement, he had almost come untouched and Harry had been not far from it once he was done. And while the initial thrill was now just a reminiscence of discovering something new, he was still feeling enthusiastic.
“There are one thousand ninety-five roses. One for each day of the last three years we have spent together. One thousand and fifty-nine white roses, your favourite. Thirty-six red roses, one for each month. A drop of passion in a sea of purity. Like my love for you.” A light blush coloured Draco’s pale cheek and he could see his stormy eyes getting glassy. They shined like stars in a cloudy sky. “This morning you opened your heart to me and now it’s my turn, so you better listen carefully and endure all the sappiness without the sexy part, all right? It’s part of your surprise.” He said with a teasing smile, proud of himself for his steady voice. Draco nodded and pecked him on his lips. “I’m all ears.”
He was just beginning his second year of teaching, when his rather dull and lonely life was turned upside down by the arrival of Harry Potter, hired as the new Flying instructor, Quidditch referee and coach, called by Headmistress McGonagall herself.
Once he was done, he advanced to the next step. As he applied the pre-shave oil, he stroked Harry’s cock with intent, trying to make him hard. “That feels good…” Said softly the man, head falling back and eyes shuttering close. “Yeah? Can you get hard me for me, love?” Harry chuckled low and dangerous, “Oh, love, I’m always hard for you. By now you should know that.” The timbre of his voice was enough to stir arousal inside his groin, warm and tender. The want of his boyfriend never failed to melt him down. He was helpless when it came to Harry. Just working him to complete hardness, feeling his weight in his hands, was enough to make his own cock twitch with interest, blood slowly flooding between his legs.
“Fuck, you’re so big… You’re stretching me so good, filling me entirely up… I can never get enough of your massive cock…” Between the praise, washing over him like a hot pour of desire, and the actual carnal sensation, Harry felt dizzy, his blood boiling inside his veins. The way Draco was biting his plump lip was maddening. He slammed right into him, all way to the base, making Draco scream.  “Sorry, sorry… Did I hurt you?” Frenetically asked Harry, coming to his senses, heart hammering in his chest. “No, no… Fuck me, please, Harry… I need you to fuck me hard and fast…” Reassured by his lover, he was more than happy to comply. He gave a few slow thrusts, giving Draco the time to adjust to his size and find that perfect angle to hit his bundle of nerves that would make him shake and scream like a banshee.
Blood boiled in his veins and his heart drummed frenetically, echoing in his ears and almost covering Potter’s voice. His orgasm started to build deep down his stomach, a hot spark ready to explode. At some point, Potter’s moves became frantic and a little broken.
Out of the blue, his towel vanished in thin air. He arched an unimpressed brow to Potter, who had a shit-eating grin plastered on his stupidly handsome face. “What? It isn’t fair I’m the only showing off his goods, is it?” He gave a slow uninhibited stroke at his cock and Draco almost screamed for how hot the action was.
"I'm afraid this is all business, Lucius," she answered. "These three students were seen breaking into not only Gringotts but Azkaban as well. And you've been implicated the crime as well."
"Draco," he whispered, clutching at the sheets when Draco reached the waistline of his pants, and there was a sigh against his stomach.
"I suppose not." Dumbledore answered. "Harry will know what to do when the time comes."
half-laying on top of him with his fingers dancing along Draco’s sides as he tickled him.
wanted to talk to her any more than Draco did. "I want to talk to Harry."
he knew what he was going to say. He knew what would make him happy. Would it truly be so horrible to reach for it? “Harry, I—” and he was interrupted by a woman's scream. They jerked away from each other, listening as the screaming continued from somewhere above them.
"I don't need to."
" He sneered over the word, wrapping his hand tighter around his wand. "Why not risk our lives for it, eh?" He directed his eyes at Hagrid, letting the ice set in. "I sure hope you're exactly who you say you are."
"Why must something be going on?" he asked, and Harry just rolled his eyes. Severus really should discourage this. He knew Lucius always went complaining about their problems to Harry too, and he was beginning to think Harry knew more about his love life than he did. "There's nothing wrong; there's just something not right."
"I am relaxed," he snapped.
"I'll do it!" One said, stepping forward to step into the compartment boldly. She had long black hair and large black eyes that gave her an altogether slightly intimidating look as she fixed her gaze on Harry.
"Potter." He smiled, tilting his head. "Couldn't wait to see—" then he caught sight of Potter's hands. Harry had his right hand circled around his left wrist, holding his hand close to his body as if it was hurt. There were cuts carved into the skin of the hand, making blood ooze out and onto the sleeve of his robes. "What happened to your hand?" Draco murmured, reaching for him.
"And if I don't want to?" Harry asked.
what was beyond the door. Eventually, he woke to the pounding of Ron's feet on the stairs and the sounds of voices in the kitchen below.
Bellatrix's cell right
"It was like she really didn't want to be kissing me in the first place," Harry twirled his thumbs together thoughtfully. "Then when she stopped, she just started sobbing on me and…"
"I'm just…" Malfoy started, his lips twisting in his trademark sneer. But when Harry raised his eyebrow, Malfoy seemed to change his mind, narrowing his eyes defensively. "I thought you didn't care."
“Pawn to F5,” he snapped back, and Severus sighed at him.
"But I just wouldn't feel comfortable speaking to him about it," Nott sighed heavily as if he'd been terribly burdened by the fact. "You see, it's about Draco. I'm awful concerned, Professor." Severus tensed, exactly the way he knew better than to give the little brat the satisfaction of doing. But it was already done, and Nott was already smiling knowingly.
. He couldn’t deal with this. He lurched to his feet, grabbing his clothes and fumbling to put his robes on as he paced toward the Slytherin Commons.
"Draco," she muttered, promptly climbing of off him. "What are you doing here?" He raised an eyebrow at her question; she was the smartest person he knew. There was no way she couldn't figure it out on her own, and he wasn’t going to admit to hovering around outside Gryffindor tower on the off chance Harry walked out. "Oh," she answered, sniffing and wiping her eyes.
“We should go to bed,” Draco said, pulling away just enough that Harry had to sit up. “We do have class tomorrow.”
He'd never explained why, though Severus could guess it had something to do with the invasion of privacy and the lack of control that the spell forced on the recipient.
Granger and Weasley came in a second later, sitting by him with pitying looks, as if
"You're not fully healed."
Thanks for all the wonderful reviews! You're all the bees-knees!
By the time, his feet would have been tripping over root and vines would have been reaching down to snatch at him, he was on all fours. His body became shorter with more coiled muscles and a sleeker, thicker hide. His four large paws collided with the ground and sent him springing into the air. He dug his claws into a nearby tree and hefted himself onto the branch, letting out a single loud screech to tell everyone else this area was occupied before he turned carefully in a circle and began to lounge on his tree branch.
"Talk about trust," Draco answered, and he could feel it now. He could feel the numbness of shock dissipating and horrible realization of what Harry had been saying sinking in. He could feel the pain blossoming in his chest and the stinging behind his eyes, but he pushed it back. He pushed it back and forced himself to consider the horrible possibility that maybe it was better this way.
“So, you and Potter’s recent activities have nothing to do with your rejecting Malfoy’s advances?” Scrimgeour asked, looking pointedly at Severus finger. Severus shifted. He still had yet to put on Lucius’ ring, but that had nothing to do with Harry, nothing to with his relationship to Harry. As if he—they were…they idea that anyone could suggest that he would take advantage of Harry after everything—
"But-."
"Don't twist my words back at me, Potter," he answered. "That is what you think, isn't it? You think Severus will say something I don't want to hear."
breathe, just take a deep breath." Draco shook his head frantically, he couldn't—how could Harry not see that he just couldn't and-
He pushed the sheets off himself, wobbling slightly as he got to his feet and then hesitated. He
And of course, he wasn't fine. That night, while he was cleaning up dinner—he had thought he was being so smart—waiting till he thought everyone was in bed. It hadn't worked though.
"Um." Harry shifted, rubbing the back of his neck uncomfortably. "I, uh, you needed to speak to me?"
"I don't think Granger will be involved," Harry answered, his lips twisting with something close to disgust. "She seemed too upset after Weasley and Nott told the school about Draco. Her conscience must have finally kicked in."
that Harry had come to him. It scared him that he couldn’t just tell Harry to leave him alone.
Jasmine Bradbury had been murdered in her own home, no evidence of anything left behind. Of course, the first thing suspected had been foul play, but there was no way to prove anything. It had taken Harry a week of digging and looking into people and searching her house before he discovered the traces of dark magic that pointed to the involvement of a certain Dark Arts artifact that had been the cause of Mrs. Bradbury's death. Unfortunately, for all of them he still hadn't be able to identify the culprit. And once Dark Arts was involved the Dark Arts Retrieval Department got involved.
"Dolores," Lucius murmured, his right hand tight around his cane. She smiled at him as if she was a high school girl.
"NOOOOOO!" Harry was yelling. He was on his knees this time, his face buried in his hands and about in inch away from sobbing his lungs out.
"Alright," Severus muttered, stepping toward Umbridge while drawing his wand.
"I…" Harry hesitated, studying his hands and carefully avoiding Draco’s eyes. "I heard something at the hospital."
"Harry," he whispered, reaching out. "I'm not going to hurt you…" Harry flinched away from his hand, staring at Draco for one second more before whirling around and sprinting down the corridor as if hell hounds were on his heels. This time, Draco made no move to follow him. He had no idea what he would even say if he did. No idea what had caused Harry to run away this time.
"Why was I not told of any of this?" Lupin asked, stepping further into the room. "The Order-."
"Hermione told me that you heard I was on the case, so you requested to be put on it with me," he said, almost stuttering over his words. Malfoy glanced up, as if he was almost looking for an answer up on the ceiling. He sighed loudly, glancing back down to stare at Harry with his sharp grey eyes intense.
“No,” Draco answered, his voice firm, confident, and the way he said the word made Harry relax against him, his own hands fisting themselves in Draco’s shirt as he relaxed.
not to care. He’d tried the whole keeping his hands to himself thing. It never seemed to work, no matter how much he knew he should just stay away.
Lucius was running like he hadn't since he was in school, his braid flying behind with Severus right in front him. They'd left Sprout by the lake with the students, heading up to the castle alone. There was smoke rising from the first few floors of the castle, a thin brown smoke seeping from the windows everywhere above that, and they could see Death Eaters milling around the grounds.
How was he supposed to look up to a man that believed in blood purity when blood purity was all shite? How was he supposed to look up to a man who would scrape his knees to the floor for a monster when he claimed to be proud? Draco didn't know the answers to those questions anymore. He hadn't for a long time. And it made him shiver every time he had to pretend that he did. Because if there was anything in this world Draco didn't want to be, it was his father's son.
"Don't say my name," Potter flinched away from the hand, his face turning a strange sort of green. Lupin immediately withdrew, his face spread with remorse and pain. And suddenly Draco felt pity run through him—pity and curiosity. He wanted to know what Lupin had done to turn Potter against him because this—the way Potter was looking at him with the bitter set of his lips and the hate deep in his eyes—was obviously something personal.
"Wait a moment," Sirius Black called, scurrying after his Godfather in a rather undignified method. Harry looked like he had been given the shock of his life time. He sat rigidly beside Draco, his shoulders tense as he looked at the far wall unblinkingly.
rounding up the other students."
"Malfoy asked to be assigned to the case," Hermione told him.
"Oh, how
"There's no point when it doesn't lie flat anyway."
"He was safe and sound at home," Severus said. "Nowhere near the Department of Mysteries."
"Draco? Wha-?" Harry started.
Thank you for all your wonderful comments!
him; he didn't
"No." There was a beat and Harry realized he'd answered too quickly. But he really didn't know the answer to her question.
Draco thought, struggling to remain on his feet.
"He deserves to know," Draco repeated when Potter was gone. "You can't keep him in the dark, sooner or later, he's going to do something stupid and—"
"It doesn't," Draco said, closing the door again. "But I was rather hoping you would know how to fix it."
"What?" Draco answered. “Absolutely not!”
They were standing outside the muggle inn, both cast in disillusion charms as they watched the entrance. It was the place Bisham had said Jasmine used to meet her lover; she'd only known because Jasmine had owned a key with the room numbers and name of the inn on it. So far though, no one had come or gone. The owner hadn't known anything, and Harry was stuck standing outside with Draco Malfoy.
"I don't need your help," he answered.
"I don't—" Harry answered, blinking like an idiot.
That was, until he was needed. He was always needed. He wasn't allowed to have a peaceful life, even though everyone hated him for it.
Severus almost jumped at the blast of red light that came from Blaise Zabini's wand. Umbridge stiffened, before falling to the ground in a crumbled heap.
was coming.
"Malfoy," Harry answered, yanking his hands away and this time Draco couldn’t keep his grip. "I have to get to Quidditch, I'm already late." Then he practically ran from the classroom. Draco let him go, his hands dropping into his lap. Teach him to try and help someone.
"But he didn't tell you how to destroy them?" he asked. Harry just shook his head, and Severus pressed his lips together, eyes still locked on the diadem. When he spoke again, his voice was low as it was when he was thinking hard about something. "You said the ring you found was a Horcrux?"
all the time.," his voice tired and bitter. "Yet, here I am."
He stood over his mother’s broken body and felt the anger course through his veins. Hot, vivid, unstoppable, and he couldn’t help but want to race through the forest and destroy Greyback himself. To tear him apart with his hands and his teeth. His father’s hands on his shoulder, cold and calculating and telling him to move, and he was lunging before he knew what he was doing.
Besides, as much as the rumors bothered Harry, he never did anything to discourage them, because at least he had the satisfaction of seeing Dracona snap at someone who
"Well," he said, letting out a strangled laugh. "I mean that now, we have to go talk our way out of this mess with Umbridge."
to say it, and he didn't need to hear it to know it was true anymore.
"So, I'd prefer if you'd just leave me alone from now on," he said, and Granger was opening her mouth to argue, but Harry was already walking away, tugging Draco with him by his hand. And Draco knew the sense of satisfaction he felt was probably wrong, but he couldn't exactly help it.
(See the end of the chapter for
And when Draco was finally released, he didn't know what he expected. Maybe Draco to at
Lucius leaned down, his lips colliding with Severus' again, his tongue dancing around the edge of Severus' mouth, his hands skimming up Severus' stomach. He gasped, and Lucius' tongue darted forward, parting his lips and sucking until he felt himself moaning from the pleasure of it.
Draco wasn't stupid, but he also knew that there were some things he couldn't force Harry to talk about. But that also didn't mean they didn't affect him. That much was obvious by the way he avoided human contact as if it burned. By the way he'd reacted the first time Draco had tried to kiss him. By the way he still hesitated as he stared at Draco's lips.
He didn't understand, but he couldn't help but believe. It was obvious that Draco cared. It was written all over his face in the tear tracks and the shaking of his shoulders, and Harry could do nothing but stare.
The past three days had been bliss for Severus. It was better than he could ever have hoped to have Lucius looking at him and only him—It was almost good enough to make him forget how quickly it would end.
"Um, Cho? Are you….?" he started and then trialed off. What was one supposed to say to a crying girl who was just standing in the middle of the room?
Blaise almost just walked out. Almost. He figured that was a level of rudeness even he wasn't allowed.
"Perhaps," Lucius answered, his voice quiet, suspicious as he cast a glance over Draco's shoulder, straight at Lupin.
"Oh, my God, Malfoy," Harry muttered, feeling lost. It felt so good. Better than he remembered sex feeling, and he was sure it hadn't been
Harry thought mercilessly,
Then 5:00 was rolling around, and Harry sighed, just giving up completely. It wasn't like it would be the first time he'd go without sleep. He waited as long as he possibly could before going into the office. Even though it makes no sense to avoid it; it wasn't like it would be any less awkward the longer he waited.
"And just what does that mean?" his father asked, face emotionless as he stared down at Draco. He was frustrated; Draco knew he was frustrated. They had both known an argument was coming. An argument that wouldn't give an answer Lucius would like. They were in Dumbledore's office with Draco seated in front of the desk and his father a little to the side, standing stiffly as Dumbledore himself looked on the scene with a troubled expression. Remus Lupin was on the other side of Dumbledore's desk, watching quietly but not contributing to the conversation.
"Oh, Professor, I really couldn't."
"Well, then it's time for us to be off." He stepped off the porch, gesturing for Harry to follow him. "I shall send your thing to Grimmauld Palace, so we are not encumbered by them," he said, pulling out his wand. "However, I would like you to bring your invisibility cloak… just in case." Harry reached out, fumbling around in his case and pulling out his cloak. When he was done, Dumbledore waved his wand and his trunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished, then he stepped forward and began to stroll down Privet Drive as if he did this every evening. Harry scrambled after him, half wondering if Vernon was still standing on the porch gaping but too afraid to turn and look.
He stepped away from them, gasping out a ragged breath. The Grey Lady had been right all along. He
Diggory had tried to stop him the next morning, had tried to talk to him. He had let him. He had been stunned that Diggory hadn't taken the punch personally. He'd been even more stunned when Diggory talked to him as if he was a whole person, as if he wasn't broken, as if he wasn't worthless.
Granger just stayed silent, her eyes following him as he shoved open an empty classroom to his right and ushered them both inside. Weasley was still glaring at him as Draco closed the door, accusation clear in his eyes, but Draco refused to be intimidated by their judgement. He refused to care if they thought him guilty.
"But-."
"His mother," Harry answered, feeling his eyes widen. "What happened to his mother?"
"-it'll lead us to the lake," Lucius finished, his grey eyes lighting up. "We don't have to find our way out."
“I would have married you before,” Severus said, and Lucius paused, pulling his head away to look down at him, his silver hair falling over one shoulder. Severus couldn’t resist reaching out, running his hand through it, feeling the soft strands tangle along his fingers.
" she snapped.
"Why not, huh? Isn't it fun to play with other people's emotions? You certainly seem to think so?"
have something to say. Granger and Weasley are planning on-."
"What happened?" Harry frowned up at her.
"Yes." He sighed, looking like someone had invited him to wrestle a dragon instead of invited him to a party. "I suppose he was impressed because of my brewing skills."
"You really want me to leave?" Malfoy asked softly, and Harry whined as Malfoy’s breath ghosted across his face.
"I'm going to-."
"He'll have scars," Severus said finally, and Lucius felt himself relaxing, finally about to breathe again. And then Severus was turning to look at him, dark eyes blazing and furious.
He pulled away, Harry letting out a strangled exhale as he did. And Harry's eyes flicked down his body, somewhere between awe and horror reflected in his gaze, and Draco opened his mouth to just tell him they didn't have to do this—that maybe cuddling would be fine instead, even though his cock was starting to hurt, and he had really been looking forward to finally seeing Harry naked. And then Harry was looking up at him, his pupils blown wide with lust, determination shining in his eyes, and Merlin, he was...
. Draco was so right for him it
"Well—I jus' heard Snape sayin'—I shouldn'ta heard this at all!" he said abruptly interrupting himself, but Harry just continued to stare until he continued. "Snape was sayin' Dumbledore took too much fer granted, an' then Malfoy was—"
Of course, the food made his stomach hurt, and he still woke up with the scream catching in his throat, but it was always easier to quell the fears when he looked up and knew Severus was looking over from his desk, and he knew he hadn't moved. It was stupid; Severus had never been able to protect him before.
"I guess I'm early," Longbottom said.
“Good,” Harry said, his voice dark, and Draco’s gaze swung around, locking onto him, and the understanding in his eyes was unnerving.
"Being anything but enemies with Potter is enough. You know this, Draco, you know your parent's expectations of your behavior." Severus said. "You need to decide what side you want to be on."
" Harry answered; and he sounded so indignant that Draco had to turn his head away to hide his smile. "Are you laughing at me?" Harry asked suddenly, all the seriousness drained from his voice. When Draco looked, he was almost smiling. One side of his mouth quirked the tiniest amount.
"You don't need to know anything," Harry answered.
“I’m fine, Father,” Draco answered, and Lucius let him go, stepping away from the door in front of them. They’d already talked about whether he should go inside with Draco or not, and Draco had been adamant enough that Lucius had agreed to not to.
"But what about the others?" Longbottom asked.
Luna blinked at him before shrugging and heading for the door. Zabini looked first at Lucius, then Severus, then Draco and Harry as if sure he was about to miss something if he left. He furrowed his eyebrows, opening his mouth to argue. Harry didn't know why they'd even let him stay, except that he'd already sort of known what was going on, and really, Zabini had a way of worming himself into situations that he wanted to be in.
Harry talks about his feelings.
"So, our children are worth less care than the criminals and laws the ministry deals with?" Adarins asked, staring at Lucius; the picture of shocked glee.
to love you, Harry Potter. But fuck you, I do, and I don't know how to keep going if you let yourself be taken over by
But no, he was just confused. He'd get over this—this infatuation in a day or two.
"How can
"I don't think your girlfriend would much appreciate that, Potter," he said, coming to a stop, turning to face Harry, and Harry had no choice but to do the same.
And then Draco and Harry were boarding the Hogwarts express, Harry trying not to act different and knowing he was failing. And now that he was looking for it, he knew Draco was doing the same thing. There was that brush of guilt in his eyes, that wary turn of his head, the way he clamped his hand down over Harry's just a little too tightly as if he was afraid Harry was about to toss it aside.
"Why are you and Harry always fighting?" she asked, ignoring him completely. He really needed to look into what he’d done to be so accosted by Gryffindor’s.
"By keeping you lot out of the way!" Nott hissed. "The basement and Dungeons are flooded so no one's coming up from there. Fiendfire on the 1st through 3rd floor to shepherd Potter right where we want him, Mongolian Mist from the fourth floor up to ensure no one's coming down, and all the common rooms are locked, so no one's coming out of those."
And Draco couldn’t decide if Harry was never allowed to have sugar again or if he had to have it every day from then on.
Harry gets some troubling news.
"Wait, what?" Draco replied. And Lovegood blinked over at him as if the answer should have been obvious by now. And he supposed it should have, but that didn't make him any less frustrated or confused. "The Diadem's in the room of what?" he asked.
to be someone else. Someone Harry wouldn't kill.
"Yes," Draco answered immediately, taking Harry by the wrist, leading his hand up until his palm was against Draco's stomach. He bit his lip as he guided Harry's hand up and up and over his chest and over his nipple. And Harry gasped in front of him, his eyes wide before he was stepping forward, taking Draco's bottom lip between his own and bringing his other hand into play. He stroked up and down and around, gently caressing Draco's stomach and chest and sides, and it was all horribly frustratingly not enough.
"What? Why would I ask Draco to Slughorn's Party?" Hermione asked. Ron turned around in his seat, an ugly sneer on his face as he turned to face Hermione.
He'd known the Dark Lord was getting impatient, but he'd been hesitant to carry out the plan he had settled on. Now though, feeling his dark mark burning on his arm and the horrible weight of the Dark Lord's impatience burn along with it, he knew his time was up.
Severus' eyes were locked on Lucius, on the blood seeping through his robes and the trembling of his limbs from the cruciatus curse. His eyes flicked over to Harry, to the nail marks on his cheek, the bite on his neck, and the rumpling of his shirt. "Oh, do ignore them, Severus," Voldemort said, flicking his wand dismissively. "We were just having a bit of fun." Harry blinked once, long and slow, and Severus looked away, his expression never changing.
"Helpful," Potter answered, his voice snarky and sarcastic, which Blaise kindly decided to ignore. He figured if this was how Potter usually was, then maybe everyone else rather had a reason to hate him. Blaise certainly did. If he didn’t before; he did now.
"Draco…" Harry murmured.
had gotten away from her tyranny.
"I'm still studying my form." He answered, clenching his jaw against the insults he could hurl her way. It was never in his best interest to ask someone else for help. "There's really nothing else to say." The only person who had been tested and not been found wanting was Severus and Harry didn't even trust him with all his secrets.
"You think I don't feel?" Draco asked, talking almost before Harry had finished. His voice was low and soft, echoing around in Harry's head far more effectively than Harry's shouting could ever have been. "You think, what? That I don’t talk to you because I’m afraid you’ll break?” Harry was too disturbed by Draco's tone to nod, but he seemed to feel Harry's intention. “You don’t have the first clue what I think.”
"Curiosity." He shrugged. Weasley opened his mouth, his face flushing hit and angry, but Harry’s eyes were still on him, speculative and brooding, and Draco didn’t have the patience to think about Weasley.
Nott smiled wickedly before stashing the wands in his hands and sauntering out of the room. Harry suddenly wanted to smack himself. How had he been such a fool as to not think of Snape? Draco had trusted Snape enough to go to him yesterday. Of course, now Draco himself was missing….
Thanks for your reviews!
"What?" he answered, twirling around to glare. "Someone has to do something! Umbridge can't just—"
"You'd better not die, Potter," Draco told him, and then he released his hair, stepped back, and began to walk away.
"Of course not, but I can't just give The Dark Lord whatever he wants," Severus said, and Harry's hands clenched down on the chair. They were tight for one second, two, and then they relaxed, and Harry exhaled.
Harry had to get through this if he ever wanted him to get out of his clothes. "I just-," his already flushed face went even more red, and Draco could feel the heat of it from even where he was standing. "Can we both be naked?" and Draco groaned; it was so awkward and innocent and
He shifted his weight, trying to maneuver his broken ankle out from under himself. Pain spiked through his body, making him black spots cloud his vision, but he managed to stay upright, watching as his father considered Harry. He would never give him to Harry, but he
"Chang's friend told Umbridge about the meeting," Draco whispered back. "I barely had enough time to warn you." His lips tightened, and he fixed Harry with a pointed stare. "Not that it did any good apparently." Harry blinked and then realized what he was talking about.
When Professor Babbling released them again, Granger was already talking, hefting her book bag and following Draco out of the room.
He expected the punch. He did not, however, expect it to hurt as much as it did.
"Alright," Draco sighed. "Don't tell me." Harry tilted his head, casting Draco a curious look.
It took them no time at all to find the check-in desk, with a fresh-faced wizard who looked cold, tired, and wary. He took one look at them and frowned as if already doubting that they should be there.
had happened.
"Well, the Gregsons are one of the few purebloods who don't use Gringotts," Ron said.
"She has a note for you, Potter," Draco said, leaning forward. He had that look on his face, that look of singular focus in silvery-grey eyes that sent a pang of want through Harry. It was so easy to get caught up in him. Draco pulled the letter from Hedwig’s leg, his eyes flicking across the parchment.
"Draco, you stop," Harry said, tugging against Draco’s hands.
the help in the first place. He could still feel the dried lines on his face where the tear tracks had been, and Harry hated how it made him feel. Hated how much he still wished Draco hadn't let him walk away.
"Really?" Flitwick asked. "Congratulations."
“I would have stopped you if I didn’t,” he answered, and Severus’s lips curved, his eyes softening as he bent to kiss Lucius again, his fingers returning to his anus and pushing two in. Lucius flinched at the way it burned, the uncomfortable pressure and pain in his arse, but Severus was already stroking his cock with his other hand, his tongue in his mouth, and Lucius was relaxing before he knew what he was doing.
"Yes," Draco answered, his voice so soft Harry almost missed it.
Fortunately, she seemed to have the situation under control. Granger ordered the giant to put her down, her voice surprisingly steady and the giant surprisingly listened. After she was back on the ground the giant shifted himself around, so he was facing a tree, apparently losing interest in them. Granger let out a breath, shaking faintly, and Draco couldn’t help envying her. He probably would have just screamed.
"I didn't."
Of course, Harry leaned away from him, curled in on himself and turned his head further away. Draco sighed and turned to watch the nonverbal duel in the middle of the classroom, promising himself he would deal with this later.
"Leave," he commanded, "You will attack no one else here." The Basilisk looked at him for a moment before slithering down the corridor and disappearing.
"I did," Dumbledore answered, pulling out a draw and lifting out a rune carved basin. A Pensieve. He walked back over to his desk set it down. Then he waved his wand around his temple, withdrawing a silvery, gossamer-fine strands of thought and placed them into the Pensieve.
"Harry!" this time it was Neville's voice that interrupted them. Draco cast a distasteful look down the hallway but watched as Neville approached. As he drew closer, Harry saw that he was cradling a white bundle in his arms, his face scrunched up anxiously. "Harry," he said, panting, "the mail came and—"
Malfoy nodded to him, and Harry turned feeling awkward as he walked out of the house, watching as Angela shut it behind them. He hesitated, half-turning toward the nearest Apparition point and half-turning toward Malfoy as if they had any more business to do. Except they didn't. No doubt Malfoy wanted him out of his hair.
“I do.”
"Hmm," he answered, and then Blaise was suddenly there, swinging an arm around Draco's shoulders and throwing him off balance.
"Didn't he just use the bathroom?" Draco muttered once he was out of the room and Harry shrugged, frowning thoughtfully at the door.
"Really?" he asked. "You knew your own father would torture you to get to me?"
Eventually, Granger and Weasley came off. Always the last ones. Though he wished they would hurry. He always got bored just standing here, having everyone stare at him without being able to throw something at them. Granger came up to him, hesitating on the balls of her feet as she always did. He stepped away, just to remove any temptation she might have had about hugging him.
"Yes," he answered, and Blaise turned an eyebrow at him but even if Draco didn't know that Severus had been teaching Harry over the summer, he'd seen the fight between him and Voldemort in the woods.
"But….?" Harry trailed off, hesitating. After a moment, Dumbledore turned and looked back at him, his eyes still twinkling in the moonlight.
in Lupin's eyes. Something feral.
"Draco?" Harry asked, his green eyes wide and his grip tight on Draco's arm, and Draco knew he was being unfair. But then, he didn't want to be fair. He was so tired of keeping it together, and he just wanted to be jealous and petty and angry, for one singular minute, even if he would be guilty later, even if he couldn't help thinking that maybe Harry should just be with Weasley rather than Draco.
"Well, you didn't try hard enough, did you?" Harry answered.
"I'm not staying here to-."
Ever since Severus had become headmaster, he'd been busy, or Harry had been avoiding the rooms that used to belong to Dumbledore. It was hard to tell whose fault it really was, but it was still true that Harry hadn't really been near Severus in a long time.
"I suppose," Lupin said, and they were standing and staring at each other, and Draco supposed he should to be asking what he wanted to ask, but he just couldn't.
"So, she's right?" Harry asked, and Malfoy blinked up at him.
," Granger hissed.
"What are you doing here?" Ginny Weasley asked, her voice snapping as he stopped to look down at Harry. He didn't bother to look up at her. Really, the more important question was why
Draco jerked away, gasping for air and looking for all the world as if he had just committed some unforgivable crime.
against him. He straightened his back, raising his chin and refusing to let Malfoy see how much he really just wanted to be left alone. His head hurt, his eyes hurt, his legs hurt, but most of all his pride hurt. He was
He sighed as Professor Grubbly-Plank asked a question and Granger answered in five seconds. Besides, even if he

“He could have killed you!” Weasley scowled at him, his face beginning to turn an unattractive red color. “How could you possibly be friends with someone-.”
"It looks like he's eating her, doesn't it?" Ginny continued, sounding immensely bored with the whole affair, and Harry almost envied her; he wished he could not care who Ron was in a lip-lock with. "But I suppose he's got to refine his technique somehow. Good game, Harry."
And Draco suddenly remembered what exactly Harry had said about Blaise being in love with him. He wondered how long that had been true, how long he hadn’t known. Hadn’t wanted to know.
“What are you still doing here?” Severus snapped at Harry, of course not seeing Draco’s fleeing body. Harry just sighed.
"I talked to him after you left this morning."
"That's not an answer," Blaise grumbled, but Potter still refused to say anything as he walked up several flights of stairs and then down one long corridor, finally ending at an unused girls' bathroom on the second floor. Blaise raised an eyebrow when Potter ushered him inside but went along willingly enough.
to know after all.
"Why indeed?" Dumbledore answered. There was a long silence that Harry refused to fill and eventually, Dumbledore turned toward him completely. "So?"
"How did we not catch this?" Lucius asked, and Severus just shook his head.
"I should go," Harry said, stiff, tense. It was the voice of the scared, unsure, twelve-year-old little boy, who had no idea what to do with Severus, no idea how much he could ask. The voice Severus hadn't heard in so long. It was physically painful for him to hear again, for him to realize how much he'd hurt Harry by suggesting the mind healer, even if it needed to be done.
"No!" Draco snapped. "No more lies." Harry looked at him for a long minute, green eyes tight on his face, and Draco could almost
Harry felt dizzy as he gained consciousness; he felt like he was rocking back and forth, moving around, not on solid ground. He groaned, trying to roll over and someone caught him, hands on his waist as if they had any right to be there. He jumped, wrenching himself away and almost tumbled off the other side of the Thestral in the process.
And he had been right.
Draco's body was lined up against Harry's, just brushing enough that he could feel his erecting through their clothes, the muscles straining and stretched. Neither of them was getting any real friction. Draco seemed determined to keep it like that. His hands stroking through Harry's hair, not pulling or tugging. His tongue caressing his mouth, not biting or sharp.
"There's no 'but' to this, Malfoy. Just leave me alone."
"He just…" Lucius shook his head, blonde hair falling around his shoulder as he twirled his teacup around in his hands. Harry just waited for him to speak; he knew better than to rush Lucius. It inevitably ended in disaster. "He seemed to think I would leave him or some such nonsense." This time, Harry couldn't stop the loud snort that came out. Lucius stared at him for exactly two seconds before his nose tilting up in the air, and his face turned haughty.
"Oh," Longbottom answered, his eyes flicking to Draco and then back to Blaise. "I almost didn't come."
"I can keep a secret," Draco interrupted, and Harry must have caught his meaning, because he blushed, glaring across the table and refusing to drop his gaze. It wasn’t attractive.
"But-," Harry started.
"I know," he answered, shrugging Blaise off and continuing down the corridor. He could feel the frown against his back, but he knew there was no way Blaise could know about his mission. And Draco had to make sure it stayed that way. Blaise may have understood and supported him when he thought all that happened was the Dark Lord getting some kind of twisted revenge on Draco's family for what happened last year, but Blaise would turn his back in a second if he knew the truth.
"I wouldn't stay away from you just because your father told me to."
"Do you have any idea how I felt when you came in? Covered in blood, carrying Harry in your arms?" Severus snapped out, his eyes shining darkly, looking impossibly venerable. "I know you may not care about Harry but-."
“Your vampire costume is impressive, Malfoy! You even got the fangs and the corset going on.” He gestured with his big hands at Draco, who looked at himself by reflex. “Thank you, Longbottom. I appreciate the compliment. I must admit, you look rather dashing yourself.” He tried to convey some emotion with the compliment since the man had been kind enough to come all the way down to the dungeons.
He slipped a hand between their bodies and when he circled Draco’s entrance with his finger, he found it loose and wet. His finger entered without resistance, making his boyfriend shiver underneath. “You’re already loose…” He stated while pushing in a second finger and starting to fuck him. He found immediately Draco’s sweet spot and pressed with intention. Draco screamed and arched his back in a beautiful arch. God, he was gorgeous. His velvety milky skin was flushed pink and his platinum hair were ruffled all over the place. He was the definition of disheveled and looked simply delicious.
“I need to apologize too, Draco. I did not mean the things I said. I was just angry, and I regret every single word. I should have talked to you instead of storming away. I promise I’ll try to do better in the future because I’m planning to never let you go.” Draco smirked teasingly. “No need to threaten me, Potter. You could have just simply asked.” Harry’s soft laughter full of joy and he could not help but join in. “You’re a prat, Draco Malfoy.” He said with so much fondness in his voice that Draco’s heart swelled two times its size.
Was it… Was it possible that he had never seen Potter’s dick? How did he manage to miss something like that?! He reviewed every Auror cock that he had filed away in his brain, which he was not ashamed to admit was a lot, but they never belonged to Potter. For crying out loud, he had even seen Weasley’s freckled cock! And yes, the curtains matched the drapes, but that was not the point!
It was Harry who broke the comfortable silence between them. Speaking lovingly in his ear, his voice thick with emotion. “You know, usually the only thing on my mind on this day are my parents, but this year was different. I couldn’t stop thinking about you. How guilty I felt for screaming at you. How lonely I was without you. I always feel particularly lonely around this time of the year, but this year was simply unbearable. Not only I missed them, but I also missed you. Next year, I want to bring you with me when I go to visit them. What do you say? Will you meet my parents?”
He opened one of the drawers of his vanity and took out the palette of eyeshadows and the brushes. He had never done makeup before, so he waved his wand and enchanted the brushes to do all the work. He closed his eyes and felt the pressure on his eyelids and under his eyes. When the charm ceased to work, he took a look at the outcome. The dark red smoky eye made his gaze even more intense and haunted. Perfect. He untied the towel on his head, his long hair falling on his back and his face. With another tired movement of his wand, he dried and combined his hair in a high ponytail, tied with a black velvet ribbon, and soft side-swept bangs, covering his forehead.
Feeling his own orgasm building inside his crotch, he gave his all and something more. He bit down on Draco’s shoulder and he felt his ass tighten around him and so the grip in his hair. Draco came with a cry, over Harry’s hand and their stomachs. Harry did not falter and kept fucking into him, still not over the edge, knowing that Draco loved to ride his orgasm until the last spark of pleasure.
“You’re like a grumpy kitten when you wake up, you know that?” Harry chuckled amused, wrapping an arm around his waist. Draco wanted to disagree, but all he could manage was a mumbled “fuck off”, which made Harry laugh even louder. The waves of his laughter vibrated through his body and he could feel a sleepy smile forming on his lips. He loved Harry laughter, it was so carefree and sunny, it could light up an entire room. “Well, you’ll have to wait until I’m done. Be good and stay put, all right?” He hummed and felt the body underneath his move slightly, rearranging to accommodate him and the new position. He let Harry go back to work since he was scratching pleasurably his back, with slow and tender movements. If he could purr, he would have done so. Which was an embarrassing thought, because Malfoys were no kitten.
Pansy was right, he looked good. With his well-groomed beard and messy curls, he could almost be passed for a model. He was not as tall as one, but heigh was the only thing he lacked, and he knew he compensated in other departments. As was clearly visible by the prominent bulge that his trousers did nothing to conceal. He felt a little bit uneasy to showcase his goods so arrogantly, the only one he wanted to show what he was packing was Draco. But as he imagined the reaction of his lover, he hoped, soon fiancé, he found the boldness he was so in need of. That day he had to be the daring one and gather all the bravery that Gryffindors boasted of so much of.
He sighed tiredly, shifting his gaze to his bed, where his costume for the ball was laid ready to wear.  That fucking ball. He clenched his hands in two iron fists, pressing his nails into the skin until it hurt. If only he had kept his mouth shut. If only he had thought and asked before acting, they would be together now. Cuddling in front of the fire, drinking some wine and eating some food stolen from the kitchen. Instead, he was alone, in his lonely cold room, wondering where Harry was and if his mistake had cost him the most beautiful thing he had ever had in his life.
Still in only a pair of black boxers, he began to dress himself, starting with the elegant white and dark green striped button-down shirt. He had been hesitant at first, when Pansy had showed him the piece of clothing, feeling it was a little bit out of his comfort zone. But she had assured him that it would have been the perfect choice for the look she had in mind and all he had to do was trust her. And so, he did.
dating an ex-death eater? The headlines wrote themselves.
Harry’s chuckle ringed in his ears. “You do have your mind in the gutter all the time!” He accused; amusement evident in his voice. “I will not admit anything without the presence of my lawyer.” “Afraid I will tease you to death, love?” Asked Harry, kissing him behind the ear. He snickered softly. “I thought I was the tease of the two of us.” He leaned against Harry’s chest, while his fiancé put his chin on his shoulder, cheek to cheek. “Believe me, I know. I learned from the best, after all.” The man breathed softly. He could hear the smile in Harry’s voice, but could not find anything to say, his eyes lost in the landscape.
"Doesn't it ever get lonely?" Malfoy raised an eyebrow like he didn't believe him.
"Aren't you going with Harry?" Hermione answered.
It wasn't that he'd never thought about kissing Dracona before. She was horribly distractingly attractive, but she was also unavailable. As in, emotionally. She had shut down every time they'd gotten close to that discussion; she was bothered by the rumors; she glared at him when he looked at her. He'd put the idea so far out of his head that he didn't even think of it anymore. Mostly.
Thanks for your comments! You're all wonder-bread! That is, unless you're gluten free....
Even if there were other—darker—things he could never forget to fear.
"No, that was merely the record kept by the Department of Mysteries," Dumbledore said, standing and walking across the room. "The person who heard it has the means to recall it perfectly."
," Draco said again, his voice sounding oddly old and croaky.
"Possibly," Borgin answered, shifting his feet and looking as if he wasn't about to commit himself to anything. And Draco didn't want to do it. He didn't even want to be here, touching this cabinet or looking at Borgin at all, but it was something he’d known he had to do as soon as he’d left his house with Dumbledore. He’d given up his chance to say no. "I'll need to see it, though. Why don't you bring it to the shop?"
"Harry!" he called, lunging after him. "Harry, wait!"
Just because Potter was acting dark and dangerous didn’t mean he actually was. He was only playing a part, trying to intimidate Blaise.
Ron found Malfoy walking briskly toward the Great Hall. He was coming from the wrong direction of the Slytherin commons, from the direction of the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, which apparently equaled guilty to Ron if the way he grasped Malfoy by the front of his robes and slammed him into the wall was anything to go by. Draco wheezed as he was slammed against the wall, surprise twisting across his face.
"I never said now was better," Severus answered, blinking one long slow blink, completely unperturbed by Lucius' outburst. "I said it was never simple."
"You don't need to sit way over there," Lucius snapped, glaring across the compartment at him.
YOU-KNOW-WHO?
"Yes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have proven themselves trustworthy, just make sure they don't repeat this to anyone else."
"Oh, sure," he answered, and then lead the way out of the Defense classroom. Blaise stared; he'd told himself he wouldn't. He'd told himself that he would do what he would do no matter what; that Draco and Potter's relationship really wasn't any of his business, but it was harder than he thought it would be. He'd spent the past couple weeks watching as they got closer and closer, and he wanted to
He stepped into Severus' private rooms, catching Severus' eye for half a second before focusing on the steaming cauldron in the corner. It was a dark poisonous green, and Draco knew from experience it tasted just as horrible as it looked. One of the easier poisons to identify, fast acting, deadly, it had to be ready by now. He looked over to Severus.
"Okay, that's it," Draco said, turning to leave. His hand was still firmly tangled with Harry’s, and he wasn’t about to let go. "We're done. I'm not listening to another minute."
"No," Draco had insisted, still retreating. "I'm not you, Harry. I know I'm not. I'm selfish and I'm a coward and this is one thing I won't do." His voice grew stronger with every word and Harry knew when he walked out that door, he would never be coming back.
"Oooh, Great!" she said, her smile wide and giggly in that girly way that he used to find attractive. "I'll see you on Valentine's day then." She bounded off, leaving Harry blinking after her about as confused as he ever was.
he wasn't being mocked this time, though he had no idea whether he could trust the feeling,
"Alright," Severus snapped. "And there's really no need to tease; I hardly think Lucius goes around speaking like that."
"So," Pansy asked, stepping up to him and effectively blocking Draco's way to the stairs. "What have you been up to Draco? No one's seen you all break."
to go through it, but then Mr. Weasley dragged him off the wrong way and—
"Harry," Hermione said, her teacher voice turned on. "What if one of the ways to brew potions was wrong or it told you to do something dangerous, and you did it?"
"Practicing moderation?" he asked.
"Could you ever truly
"Is that so?" Severus said, raising one skeptical eyebrow.
The dinner was as boring as Draco predicted it to be. The entire time he couldn't help but think his house elves could have made something so much better, but then he could hardly have blamed Slughorn for that. It was almost amusing the way Slughorn talked only to Harry, leaving the rest of them pretty much alone. Harry's annoyance and stuttering answers made it so much the better.
"I'm not upset," Malfoy answered immediately. Harry decided it would be best to just ignore him while he was being stupid.
"Potter," Zabini said, his eyes flicking behind Harry as if he'd try and dash around him or something. Then he sighed, and faced him, apparently coming to terms with his fate.
"Can I kiss you?" Draco asked, because he knew saying what he really wanted to say would only make Harry run the opposite way, and really, he did want to kiss Harry again.
Blaise had always insisted that just because he didn't hold class rank with people like Draco and Potter and Granger didn't mean he wasn't as smart as them. He'd always said he was more intelligent than Granger if someone were to start judging street smart instead of book smarts.
"What's going on?" Draco asked.
"My Lord?" Bellatrix asked, and she was already twirling her wand between her fingers, stepping toward Lucius threateningly.
"Severus' office and private rooms are that way," he pointed to the left where the staircase down was already shifting up and over, leading the perfect direction. "Why are you leading us to the entry hall?"
“Believe it or not, but I’ve not had much occasion to run around ordering sweats,” Harry answered, rolling his eyes up at the ceiling and holding them there—as if Draco was the one being completely absurd.
"What was Luna talking about?" Draco asked. He could just see Harry's back as they made their way through the woods to Draco's spot for the transformation. "With Weasley?" He saw Harry sigh, saw the way his shoulders slumped like he really didn't want to talk, but he must have realized that Draco needed the distraction, because he didn't ignore the question.
He tried to stand, fell, and then managed it just in time to catch sight of the raven bobcat disappearing between the trees. He didn't bother to call out, he knew Harry was gone.
"What did he want?" Harry asked, eyebrows furrowed. His hands clamped down on the chair as he looked steadily back at Severus, green eyes filled with shadowed intensity that Severus hadn’t seen from him in so long.
"Out loud, Harry." Malfoy said. He did moan at the sound of his given name on Malfoy's tongue.
“Do you think they’ll really do it?” Harry asked, pulling open the door to their room.
"What?" Harry asked.
Draco would have been inclined to help Harry out if he would stop looking at Weasley's face, over and over even after the bint's eyes had returned to normal. She was talking to Neville like a normal person and still Harry stared. Draco told himself Harry was just concerned, the Weasleys were family to him. It made sense that when one showed up crying, he would be concerned, but that didn't stop the bitterness from creeping up his throat and choking him. He felt like kicking Harry again, but managed to refrain. Somehow. Barely.
"Potter," he said quietly. His eyes snapped up, locking on Draco. He blinked once, twice and then finally seemed to shake himself out of his daze. He looked down at Pansy, still shivering before him.
there," Ginny Weasley snapped.
"What?" Draco answered.
But he still couldn't shake the feeling that he was giving something profound up by being here. By asking for Lupin's help. Like he was admitting he wasn't strong enough.
"No?" Ron asked, blinking. "But…"
"My scar…"

"Potter, really," Snape snapped for probably the fifth time in the past ten minutes. "Do try and pay attention to what you’re doing. If I have to drag you to the infirmary, because you weren't paying attention
"Harry-," he started, but Harry must have understood the tone of his voice, because he was suddenly pulling away from Draco, rolling off the bed, stepping away, his robes wrinkled as they hung off him.
"Well," Lucius stood, leaning his cane against his chair and stepping up to Severus. "Worry does them no good." Severus cast him a suspicious look, stepping away and retreating behind Dumbledore's desk.
"Yes," he answered, throwing Draco a cautious look before turning his attention back to Slughorn, but it was already too late. He already had the man's attention.
"I didn't say that," Harry told her. "I'm accepting your apology, not forgiving you," he blinked at her, slow, his dark green eyes cold on her face. "I get what was going on in your head when you did all that, but that doesn't mean I like it," he paused, and Draco could tell by the look in his eyes what was coming next. "Or you."
The 5th years filed in, taking their time to be seated as the examiners passed out their tests and answer sheets. Eventually, they started. Draco filled out the answers carefully, making sure his paragraphs made sense and answered every question completely. His eyes flicked up to find Harry's messy dark head, slumped over his table, eyes closed as if he'd fallen asleep. Draco sighed, lowering his head back down to his paper.
"Wait," Lupin said, stepping forward. Potter paused, his shoulders tensing so much Draco was suddenly worried he would whip around and curse the man. Draco looked over, unsure if he was talking to Potter or him. "You father has a point, Draco," Lupin said, looking at him intently. "If you continue with this plan, a lot of people could get hurt—innocent people."
"Didn't I say enough in my letters?" he muttered, resisting the urge to sneer at her. For someone so smart, she always had a tendency to ask such stupid questions.
It was so much easier to confess when he was holding Harry, breathing in his scent, and aching with every part of himself. Now that he no longer missed him quite as bad, he’d lost his nerve, no matter how much Harry’s disappointed look hurt.
"It should be," Potter answered, though Blaise wasn't a fool enough to think he was actually convinced. "So, is that all you know?"
"What does it hurt you?" Draco asked, rolling his eyes. "You can only be safer if you're closer to Dumbledore."
"That's the point," Draco answered, feeling like he should start speaking in baby words sometime soon. "The only people she wants with power are the people who are loyal to her and for the most part that doesn't include the teachers or the prefects. So, watch what you say and when you say it." He gave Granger a hard look. She blushed and dropped her eyes. "And also, the other teachers won't be able to help you. Actually, she's planning on sacking Hagrid next week."
"They're in the drawing room?" Harry asked.
"When?"
He stared across the room, his eyes moving from the fire grate to the entrance to his office. As much as he hated to admit it, he needed help. He would have to ask Lucius. Again. Lucius, who he had already asked too much of and given nothing in return. He reached down, his fingers closing around the ring sitting on his desk, the Malfoy symbol engraved along the side.
my business?"
"What? Are you serious?" Zabini answered, his voice high and echoing against the stone corridor, and Harry wondered vaguely if he could get away with just wiping Zabini’s memory because this hadn't gone anything according to his plan.
catch one of your friends." A pause. Draco stepped toward the door and then away again. It was just a trick. He couldn’t let Lucius get in his head. "Draco are you willing to take the chance that it's a bluff? Just come out and no one needs get hurt. Especially, not your precious, Potter." Draco flinched. There was a long pause and he could almost hear the satisfaction in his father's voice when he spoke again. "If not…
"Well, you don't exactly seem like you
He had expected Draco to run away; it was inevitable. It was also impossible to stop himself from hoping Draco would change his mind, that he would come find Harry and tell him he felt the same way.
"Nothing," Draco answered, his eyes narrowing, and Blaise opened his mouth to explain only to find he couldn't.
"You always had a problem," Severus answered, carefully cutting a piece of meat on his plate. "That is, until Narcissa wanted a child." There was a beat and he wanted to smack
to know. Because it was her problem.
He got to his feet carefully, feeling self-conscious as he looked around. They were by a riverbed, the water flowing gently down-stream. He didn't hear any wildlife around them, didn't see anything. He was covered in dirt, his hair a complete disaster. He raised his hand to run through his hair, coming away with a couple twigs and blood. He stared at his fingers, trying to remember where it had come from. What—
"Draco," Dumbledore interrupted. "I hate to inconvenience you, but may I use your bathroom?"
really be interested in Harry? Harry blushed at the thought of Draco licking his cock and telling him he was beautiful.
“What are you talking about?” Draco answered.
It wasn't until he caught sight of Theodore Nott that they truly began to pay attention to him. It wasn't that Draco wasn't expecting the look of hate and revulsion that passed across Nott's face, it was just that he didn't expect Nott's head to turn toward him while drawing his wand in the middle of Diagon Alley.
"We need to find him," he said, and Lucius followed him out of the room. He had no idea what part Lupin was really playing, but he knew they needed to find out. He knew-
to be said. Draco swallowed harshly. He wanted to cross the space between them and crush Harry to his chest and tell him nothing would ever hurt him. But the words would be hollow, because the Dark Lord
"Right you are, Cuz," a voice said, echoing around them. They turned, coming face-to-face with Nymphadora, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and…
"And why don't you just tell Lucius this?" he hesitated, and then cocked his head. "Besides, your obvious relationship issues."
"Harry?" someone's voice, sounding very far away. Hands reached out, and he tried to flinch away, but they were already there, lifting him up and against someone's chest. And he was relaxing before his conscious mind knew what his unconscious already did.
"You don't know what you're talking about," Severus snapped, his eyes flashing dangerously. Harry just raised an eyebrow, regret absent from his gaze. Severus sighed, leaning back against the pillows and closing his eyes. "Why must you always be such an arse?" he asked.
"So, what? You've had you're shag and now it's time for you to run along to your next conquest. My, Potter, I didn't actually take you for being the fuck 'em and leave 'em type," and Malfoy was sneering at him, his chin held high, voice as condescending and mocking as it could possibly get, and Harry had no idea what he'd ever seen in him.
"Charms, Transfiguration, Alchemy, and Potions," Severus said, reading off the chart in front of him. His eyes flicked up to Draco before moving back down the piece of paper in his hands. "You won't be continuing with Defense Against the Dark Arts or Herbology?"
"Draco—" Harry tried. He didn't know what he was going to say, just that he needed to say something to get rid of the horrible tension between them. He had run to Draco without a second thought and now almost found himself regretting the impulse. He still wanted Draco with him, he just wished he knew what to say to him.
Besides, Harry had never claimed to be nice.
to work with him," Harry answered, and he knew he sounded dangerously close to a whine. He
Thank you so much for your wonderful comments. Honestly, you guys are just the best! I am getting close to catching up to my writing, so I'm going to go back down to updating once a week one Wednesdays.
He couldn't believe the man, couldn't believe his interference. He knew Draco couldn't be distracted this year; he knew there were more important things than school homework and still he threw work and books into Draco's arms as if he were any other student.
"Both of you stop," Hermione suddenly interrupted. Draco started, looking over at her in surprised before he could help himself. She looked… wrecked. About as bad as Draco felt, her eyes more hurt then angry, and he immediately remembered that both of her best friends had ended up in the infirmary within 24 hours.
Harry’s hand was still wrapped around Draco’s when they walked out of the Forbidden Forest. It felt a little like Draco hadn’t let go of him since they’d talked, but then, Harry couldn’t blame him when he didn’t want to let go either. He paused at the edge of the forest, Draco’s fingers tightening. It had been so long since Draco looked happy. Since Harry felt happy. He felt the edge of his mouth curl up as he stepped onto his toes, leaning toward—
"Our esteemed Headmistress Umbridge is keeping it hush-hush. She doesn't want anyone to know," Zabini said, his face dark. "Wouldn't want anyone to think she wasn't fit to rule."
Warning: References to Rape
"Very good," Lupin praised. "Watch that shield charm, Hermione. You have to be prepared for all incoming attacks." Granger flushed and went to her seat, her face flaming as Lupin called two more people up.
"Which is?"
long. And Draco was lost. So utterly lost. And he should never have tried to pretend he wasn't.
"Your father loves you, Draco." Harry answered, continuing the conversation and seemingly oblivious to Draco's seduction. "He just doesn't know how to show it."
Draco frowned, but said nothing. Now wasn't exactly the time to be questioning Harry's fundamental beliefs about himself. But they
"You don't have to forgive someone to get along with them, Draco.”
"Harry, m'boy!" Slughorn said. He wasted one glance at Draco, who just scowled at him. He was never sure just how Slughorn seemed so determined to ignore Draco's contempt. Maybe he just knew if he was rude to Draco, he would never win Harry over. Or maybe Draco's temper really meant so little to him. Draco honestly didn't know which he preferred.
Lovegood was in the library, scribbling on a piece of parchment while reading some magazine upside down. She had her usually glasses on, the frames flaring out with silly designs, and she took more than a minute to look up when Harry called her name.
"Why didn't you tell me sooner?" Draco asked, and Harry sighed. He was still in bed, his back propped up against the headboard so he was sitting up.
It scared how much he’d
"No," Draco snapped, clamping his hands down on his chair to keep himself seated. "You don't understand, Professor. I will not be locked away like a dirty secret. I want to transform in the woods. Potter and I have worked it out between us and it-."
"So? Who cares what they think?"
“They probably want someone that can’t be accused of being biased,” Lucius said, tapping his walking stick against the ground. “McGonagall has no reason to lie for the ministry while Adarins does.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He was just a toy to Malfoy. He hadn’t forgotten, but it was so hard to pull away from Draco when he was touching him like that. It wasn’t just the physical sensations. It had much more to do with the pain and the pleasure and the lack of control filling up the spot inside himself that he’d gotten so tired of feeling.
"Technically, she's done it before," Harry said; Zabini just glared at him.
"Are you alright, Harry?" Dumbledore's voice said. Harry started, just realizing Dumbledore was even there. And not just Dumbledore but the Atrium was full of people, bursting one at a time through the fireplaces along the walls. Neville shifted just behind Dumbledore, still cradling Hermione in his arms.
He stopped in front of the Slytherin dorm, murmuring the password quietly before stepping inside. Being careful to keep his feet concealed, he headed up the stairs and to Draco's Prefect room. Harry knocked quietly, waiting for a moment before frowning at the door. Draco was an extremely light sleeper, he
“But-.”
This was the first time they'd been alone together—or together at all—since he'd told Lucius how he'd felt. He wasn't exactly sure how it happened, only that he was cleaning out Dumbledore's office and Lucius had come in and started talking. He supposed he was so busy thinking, he'd forgotten to use common sense.
"People change, Harry," Draco insisted. "Your mother married your father for a reason, and I'm sure it wasn't because he was an arsehole."
"Go ahead," Potter answered, and Draco only had time to blink at him before another wave of pain rippled through him. This time more powerful than the last.
Also, thanks so much for reading and hanging on for the ride! You are all so amazing and wonderful and deserve all the good things!
"Harry," Draco's voice was low, dangerously soft, and Harry could tell by the look in his eyes that he was following his train of thought almost exactly. The difference was, if the burning fire in Draco's eyes was anything to go by, he obviously didn't agree. "You can't just give up."
"You can't do anything to me," he answered, twisting his ring around and blatantly pointing it at Malfoy. "If you do, it'll actually be your friend here that feels it."
"And how does she know?" Sirius' eyebrow rose further.
"He didn't do anything," Draco sighed. "Harry's not… it's not his fault."
"Yes!" Harry said. "I need to find Dumbledore, I need to—"
Harry recovered first, shifting with a groan away from the sticky mess of cum and pulling out. Draco winced, and shifted, his hand clutching tight around Harry's back. His lips twisted when he shifted his legs and the cum dripped out of his hole, and Harry momentary felt bad. He should probably clean up, but he didn't exactly know where his wand was, which was bad.
"You're here a lot," Lovegood told him, and he could just imagine the starry look in her eyes to match the sound of her voice.
Lucius wasn't trying to hurt him, but that didn't change the fact that he had. And as painful as it was to see Lucius conflicted and smarting, that didn't change the fact that Severus was tired of being hurt by him. He was tired of Lucius' believing deep down that Severus was somehow lesser.
"Very well," Lupin sighed as if he was genuinely upset about this turn of events. He stood, pausing to hover over Draco's prone form. "If you change your mind-."
"Or maybe he'd tell
"Now, Potter. I don't think you're in any position to be making demands. Give me the prophecy."
"Did you know his name?" Harry asked.
He gasped when his slacks came down, his feet leaving the floor, and he was clutching the desk, and Severus was suddenly there, holding Lucius up, mouthing at his perineum. He gasped, one hand coming up to cover his mouth as something between a moan and sob opened up inside his chest. He had never been particularly vocal in bed before; it was something his partners had always complained about, but now it was as if he couldn't keep it in.
"You can't hate the world."
"What happened?" he asked, and Harry turned his face away.
"What's wrong?" Severus asked.
"Why can't you admit that you're afraid?" Harry answered, his head still turned toward the ground. He wouldn't give Malfoy the satisfaction of getting a reaction from him. Not because Harry particularly cared about winning, but because this wasn't about them or him. This was about Malfoy.
It was horrible, and it hurt, and it made him to want to hurt Harry as he’d been hurt, dig around in his chest and make him understand how painful it was just to kiss him. Draco grasped his wand again and with a single flick found himself naked alongside Harry. He wanted Harry to understand. Their cocks brushed along each other and they groaned simultaneously. He wanted Harry to hurt him as only Harry could. As no one else had been able to reach inside of him and pull the pain out.
there. Regret, guilt, anger, something, but there was nothing besides a blank kind of confused defiance that Draco didn't know what to do with.
"We finally got caught while trying to shag in the middle of a hallway," he said. Draco was quite proud of the self-control he managed by refraining from hitting him.
"Lucius," he said eventually, looking up. He looked tired, his dark eyes full of an emotion that Draco couldn't identify, but his father obviously could. Lucius took a step away from Severus, his mask revealing nothing. "He doesn't need to take the potion. It only suppresses the beast so he's able to think for himself, but if he's in the woods away from anyone, it shouldn't matter if he doesn't want to take it."
He was
So, he was turning on his heel, running out the door after Severus before he could think how very unrefined he looked, how very unMalfoy the whole thing was. And Severus had barely gotten halfway down the corridor when Lucius grabbed him by the arm and dragged him through a door and into an empty classroom.
"You can?" Potter asked, his gaze somewhere between shocked and suspicious, and Draco couldn’t blame him.
"You…" Harry felt a little like someone had tipped his world on the wrong side and asked him to finish an Arithmetic problem. The idea of Hermione and Draco having a civil conversation seemed so foreign to him, so horribly out of his reach. "He talked to you? About feelings?”
"Why did you bring me here?" Malfoy asked.
was what he was talking about.
"Oh, of course, Professor, of course," Nott answered, emphasizing the words in a way that made it clear that he really didn't agree with Severus at all. "But then don't you think it's odd that they both disappear every time the moon's full?" Severus froze, and Nott's smile was large and ugly. "
"Leave me alone," Harry called behind him as they rounded the first corner. And maybe it wasn't fair, but his words sent Draco's already bubbling anger tumbling over the top, spewing out of him and making him shake. He was so tired of chasing after Harry only to have him pull back at the last second. Of having to worry about which lines to cross and what he had done wrong this time.
