Pansy stood and hit his shoulder playfully. “You’re so cocky,” she teased. “I’ll be back in a minute with my makeup bag.”
Other people were crowding around them now, helping Pucey to his feet. Draco looked around for someone who could help but the only teacher present was Lockhart.
“Well, the truth. Tell them that Hogwarts is no longer safe. It is as we feared, the chamber of secrets has been reopened.”
The last presents he had to open were from Draco. There was a small stack of them, all wrapped neatly. He picked up the long narrow on first and riped of the shiny paper.
He saw Theo look between them both, thick brows furrowed in confusion as he attempted to figure out what was going on with them. Seeming to give up he broke the awkward silence, “Pans and I are going to Hogsmeade this weekend are you two coming?”
“What are you talking about?” Ron demanded from the bed he was keeled over. His leg was bent at an awful angle. He held a writhing Scabbers in his hands.
“Move aside, Harry,” Lupin said. Harry hesitated. “I’m only going to tie him up,” Lupin explained. Harry stepped back, felt Draco’s hand slip into his. The touch brought him great comfort and he relaxed a fraction. They all followed the floating, tied up, pitiful figure of Peter Pettigrew.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up into his hairline as unfamiliar words fell from Draco’s lips. French. He must be speaking french. He couldn’t help but stare. Since when? What? He found himself having a hard time stringing thoughts together. He was instead weirdly fixated.
“Not until after dinner,” Harry said. “There are too many people around who will panic. Besides everyone is safer in numbers with all of us here in the great hall.”
His hand slid up to cup Griffin’s cheek and he’d never imagined kissing another boy would feel this good. It was a little messy, he had no idea what he was doing, but he couldn’t have been that bad because Griffin was making these little noises that encouraged Draco to continue what he was doing. When one of Griffin’s hands slide under his shirt and stroked his hip Draco sucked in a short breath and felt goosebumps rise all along his skin.
“Get your nasty feet away from me, Potter.” But Harry only stuck his tongue out and Draco had to look away before Harry saw the blush on his cheeks.
Just then a girl with frizzy brown hair threw the compartment door open. She was already in her robes. "Have either of you seen a toad?"
The desk he was sitting on in the empty classroom they were using was uncomfortable but not so uncomfortable that he wanted to stop what they were doing.
“Are you bloody joking?” Pansy looked at him, clearly revolted. Harry cackled and Draco rolled his eyes at his friends idea of humour.
Harry heard a cough from Draco’s bed and froze. He’d remembered to put up silencing charms right? Draco wouldn’t hear him?
“But at the Yule Ball you had her lipstick all over your face?” Harry looked completely perplexed and lost.
Draco imagined the hot water washing over his skin. He wouldn’t mind that right now. “If you’re sure?”
Harry glanced down at the map to check that no teachers were up ahead and had a heart attack when he saw Filch’s name. Scrambling back the way he came, Harry pelted back to Slytherin common room. He was on his way back up to his dorm room when he heard a sniffle from one of the massive arm chairs by the fire. Figuring he could stay up a bit longer he took a peak.
“You look dashing. Your hair is still it’s usual birds nest though,” Pansy said laughing, running her hands through it.
“Do you think he’ll try again?” Ron asked, fidgeting with the starch white material of the crisp hospital bed sheets.
Draco wanted to grab Harry and pull him away from all the people looking at him like there was something wrong with him. He wanted to drag him away before someone else realised what he had, that Harry was a-
“I just- I guess I thought since we’ve been, you know, well I guess I just thought I meant more to you. Even though we hadn’t talked about it yet, what we were, I assumed we were something,” Harry said, grounding out emphasis on the last word.
Harry would look back and wonder whether the map had actually done him any good that day. Hogsmeade had been wonderful at first, more magical than his friends had described, but he’d also learned a haunting truth. He’d been hiding under the cloak of invisibility in the Three Broomsticks, talking with Draco, Pansy, Blaise and Theodore when he’d overheard a conversation among Professor McGonagall, Hagrid, Professor Flitwick, Madam Rosmerta and the Minister of Magic. Without knowing he was there they’d discussed something dreadful, that Sirius Black had been his father’s best friend, that the man who was apparently his godfather had also been undercover for Lord Voldemort and been the one to betray his parents.
“I’m not implying anything, the stories said the beast would purge the school of all who weren’t worthy of studying magic and that’s what it’s doing, but while we’re on the subject you should probably watch your back too, blood traitor.”
"Harry! Think fast!" Draco hollered, throwing an apple he'd pulled out from his pocket into the air. It went over the green house . Harry sailed after it, leaning on the broom to increase his speed. To his shock and satisfaction he caught the apple. However he pulled up short when he realised he was in plain view of everyone on the grounds. He quickly retreated behind the greenhouse. "Malfoy, you dumbass! People definitely saw me!"
"All the same. I can't imagine growing up without my Mum and Dad. Anyway, let someone know if you do spot a toad." She gave him a small smile.
“When did you stop sleeping in matching silk pyjamas?” Harry asked him, exiting the steamed up bathroom.
"You want to be helpful?" Draco's eyebrows were raised. "Go get these ingredients." Draco shoved the textbook into Harry's arms. "I'll set up the cauldron."
Harry shook his head. “I never ever want to be on her bad side if this is what it’s like to be on her good side.”
“Are you two going to just stand there bickering?” Harry and Draco turned to see Theo smirking as he strolled toward the manor, a familiar glint in his eyes.
“No. My mother’s letter was pretty good. My father’s made it seem like I’d hardly see him. He made it seem like the divorce was just mother’s fault. I honestly don’t know what’s going to happen.”
The shabbily dressed herbology teacher steps forward. “I believe you and your second year classes are growing mandrakes?”
“Look,” Blaise held out a pin and snickered. “Potter can suck instead of Potter sucks. Is that better?”
Harry chuckled. “Fair enough. I will admit though, I like your hair better in the morning. You know, when it isn’t gelled back?”
Claudette put her hands on his shoulders. “Tell him.” It sounded so easy when she said it like that.
Harry felt Draco’s cool fingers, gentle at his chin, turning his face so he had to look into the other boys grey eyes. “No, you didn’t,” he insisted, voice firm. “Harry, Black is free now.”
You’re father and I have news that may not come as a shock to you. We’ve been having problems that we just can’t work out despite our best efforts. As you may have noticed the two of us no longer live together. The last year we’ve taken some time apart and we both agree that it is better that way. Because of all this we feel that it is time that we divorced. We both still love you very much. Your father and I want you to know this is in no way your fault. Please write me back with any questions or concerns.
Well that seemed like a pretty chill response. Draco wasn’t sure what he'd been expected but that hadn’t exactly been it. “That’s it?”
After Theodore left the girls dorm, very proud of his long pink sparkly fake nails, Pansy felt calmer. She wasn’t totally okay. It would take some time to accept and come to terms with her parents separation but already the weight that had been sitting on her chest felt a little lighter.
Pansy averted her eyes and looked down at his hand in hers. She pressed down on the last nail on his right hand and started on his left. “I knew it was going to happen. They stopped living together like a year ago.”
Upon apparating into the front hall of Malfoy Manor, Harry immediately felt at ease. He couldn’t put his finger on it exactly. It wasn’t as if Malfoy Manor was home. However, it smelled the way Draco did and it was that familiarity that he suspected put him at ease.
"Thanks." Draco seemed to miss the sarcastic undertone in Harry's voice he was so focused with the task at hand.
Blaise made a face back and Pansy threw a decorative pillow at him. “Never have I ever stuck gum under a desk.”
Draco nodded. There was a slight sting in his chest but he knew Harry had gone through enough as it was today without having to talk about how he felt for Draco. “Fair enough.” He waited for Harry to crawl back under the covers before he switched back off the light. When Harry snuggled into his arms any of Draco’s remaining tension ebbed away.
Draco lay on Claudette’s bed beside her. The inside of the Beauxbatons carriage was similar to wizard tents in the sense that it was a lot more on the inside than the outside suggested. On the outside it was just a carriage, the inside was a massive room with thick swaths of coloured fabric dividing off sleeping areas. There was no one else in the carriage right now so it was just the two of them.
“He’s clearly in love with you!” Harry exclaimed, sounding half hysterical. “I didn’t think it could get worse. Now things are significantly worse. He’s gone. He’s dead and everything’s falling apart!”
Draco stared at Harry. "Us". Draco felt so relieved. Harry still wanted to be his friends. He nodded. The compartment door crashed open for a second time and for a moment Draco thought Hermione had returned. However, this time a small crowd of students came in.
Yet, despite all this, his eyes were drawn to Draco, like magnets. He was wearing a well fitting pressed suit which made him look particularly elegant. Even though what Harry had told him earlier was true, even though he did prefer when Draco didn’t have all that gel in his hair, it did accentuate his high cheekbones and sharp jawline when he did.
Draco stood up abruptly. “Stop being a bunch of pansies. I already told you, I don’t like anyone!”  With a flush high on his cheeks, Draco stormed away, leaving the rest of the group shocked by his sudden outburst.
Draco strained to hear whatever Harry was talking about but heard nothing out of the ordinary. “Hear what?”
“-then you can live, free,” he told Black. “It’s the only way. If you don’t you’ll have to run for the rest of your life. We all know you'll slip up, make a mistake, be caught one way or another. If we turn him over though, you’ll be a free man.”
“Well sorry for asking,” Draco raised his hands in innocence. “It’s just I don’t understand how else your name was drawn!”
Draco bit his lower lip. “Even if we go to them we still don’t know the entrance to the chamber of secrets. Without that this information won’t be of much use Let’s find it and then tell them.”
“Get out of my way, both of you!” She pushed past and shoved open the infirmary doors. Before her she saw Harry in an infirmary bed, his head against a pillow. He looked pale and there were bandages on his head but he was awake and laughing at something Draco was saying. Draco, who sat beside Harry’s bed. Something that had been roaring in Narcissa’s chest settled at the sight of her two boys together and alright. She knew that as long as they were together they’d be okay. The friendship they seemed to have formed was one Narcissa wished she’d had as a girl.
He spent the rest of the holidays trailing Pansy, unless she was with Draco. When she wasn’t the two of them spent a lot of time cuddling while she read or making out.
Draco reached across him, holding an unfamiliar dish. “Voici. désolé, il n'essaie pas de paraître impoli. C'est seulement qu'il n'a jamais entendu parler de Bouillabaisse.” (here you go. sorry, he is not trying to come off as rude. It is only that he has never heard of Bouillabaisse)
Draco’s fingers strayed from Harry’s hair to trace one of Harry’s eyebrows. “You know he really likes you because ever since you helped him with making dinners that first Christmas you came here for my parents have been treating him better. Like they think if Harry bloody Potter is good to house elves they ought to be or something.”
Blaise pressed his lips together, his revulsion clear. “So you’re wearing a piss coloured shirt to spite Draco?”
Draco didn’t suppose it would be very effective to try and talk them out of going in so he reluctantly followed them in. It looked a bit like the green houses at Hogwarts but it had way higher glass ceilings and the plants were bigger and more exotic looking.
“He better not be late. The train won’t wait for him.” Pansy stood on her tiptoes, trying to find him.
Harry sat as still as he could as Pansy stared at his face, tongue between her lips in concentration. He felt creams and powers go on. Then there was the section he had to close his eyes for which wasn’t much fun. The whole time the truth or dare was still going on.
When he came to the top of the landing he saw them. Griffin moved from kissing the other boy to sucking at Draco’s neck and all Harry could do was stare at Draco’s blushing face. His eyes were closed but they flashed open the moment Harry stepped on a creaky floor board. The second their eyes met Draco pushed Griffin away. But it was too late, Harry had seen.
P.S. I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it's my fault he no longer has a rat.
Harry buttoned up the shirt to the pair of silk green pyjamas Draco was lending him. “Christmas of course.”
“-and I hear you, I do, but you’re name got in somehow. So what’s the most logical explanation?” Pansy asked with an expectant look on her face. Like he had any answers.
I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven't a hope of finding me here. I am planning to allow some Muggles to glimpse me soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so that the security on the castle will be lifted.
“Oh, stop it Harry.” Pansy tossed a throw pillow in his direction. “He’s worried and honestly rightfully so. If you truly didn’t enter your name-”
“I don’t actually,” She interrupted, teeth grit. “I like them. Just because you’re emotionally constipated and being  an inexplicable prick right now doesn’t mean you have to go after my hairstyle.”
“We wake up all these people.” They all looked at the other patients. It was an eerie sight that gave Pansy chills. “The sooner that happens, the better.”
“We’ll get away with it,” Harry said, nudging Draco with his shoulder. “After all I’m Harry bloody Potter, right?”
Draco lay back down. “Imagine all the things we can do now that we have that, until the spell wears off, of course.”
Christmas was a depressing affair that year. As the Malfoys were in hiding, going to the manor was off the table. They’d eventually all sat down and made the decision to stay at Hogwarts. The Castle was beautiful, gloriously decorated, everything glistened with magic. From the trees down every corridor. It was unfortunate that the castle's stunning appearance and jolly professors and peers all happy for the holidays didn’t translate to jovial moods from his friends.
"Really? I had no idea" Harry muttered sarcastically as he fumbled forward. Draco moved to stand but Harry's hand shot out and grabbed at his wrist. "Give me my glasses back or I'll pour all your hair gel down the drain," Harry threatened.
“I’m glad to know that’s how you feel about my class, Mister Nott,” McGonagall said from behind Theo, passing off a screech owl to Draco who took the creature and placed it on Harry and Pansy’s desk, in the middle of them all.
While Pansy went off on Theo, Draco was surprised when Harry leaned over. The weight of the other boy rested fully on Draco. “Can I sleep with you tonight? Like old times?”
Draco itched to go upstairs and take his shower, to get away from this conversation. “She might have other plans. Her family always goes away.”
“Harry, come look at this!” Pansy said from around a corner. Harry shrugged at Draco apologetically but followed the sound of her voice around a massive leafy plant.
Harry had developed a habit of taking his cloak of invisibility and the Marauders Map for a stroll down the corridors when he couldn’t sleep at night, a habit he was aware drove Draco insane. That night he went out just for that reason.
“His mother’s family is french so I suspect most of his life- “ she told him, spooning peas onto her plate. “Would you stop glaring at that poor girl?”
Draco slid the compartment door open and immediately regretted it. Harry looked up from where he had his head in Pansy’s lap. “Hey gorgeous.”
Draco tried talking to him but Theo would just get defensive and grumpy and stalk away saying there was nothing wrong.
“What a nice young polite gentleman!” Mrs Clemonte said to his mother who gave her a small smile in return.
Harry curled around Draco who slept on his back. It was uncomfortable but Draco didn't want to wake Harry. A tear stain was drying on his shirt and Draco tried to focus on that instead of his thoughts. He’d been meaning to ask Harry why things between them had shifted so suddenly from better than ever to tense and awkward. Then Harry had a nightmare and they’d rushed to the Ministry of Magic to save Harry’s godfather only for Sirius to come to save Harry and die at the hands of Bellatrix Lestrange, his cousin, Draco’s aunt and one of the Dark Lords most loyal and dedicated followers.
Harry peered down and sure enough his torso was gone. Or not gone, just invisible. Harry looked up, hoping Draco would have an explanation.
“He’s not bad to look at either,” said Pansy, giggling. “His hair looks like it would be so soft to run your hands through.”
“Harry Potter?” If it was possible, Dobby’s eyes seemed to widen even further. “How long I have wanted to make your acquaintance.”
“I guess so.” When Draco didn’t answer and refused to look at him, staring downward, Harry huffed. “Why are you mad at me?’
“You’re one of their best friends. They’d never turn their backs on you.” Draco wasn’t so certain. “You didn’t think I would, did you?” Draco could only shrug. How could he explain how terrified he’d been or how scared he was still. “Will you tell Harry?” She asked.
“Yeah, but still.” Draco shrugged and went back to packing his trunk. “ It’s fine. You’re a Quidditch prodigy, right? Youngest seeker in a century? That has to count for something. I swear it’ll be fine. My parents aren’t monsters.”
“They can wait a little longer,” interrupted Draco, feeling more angry. Harry had no good reason to feel hurt right now he didn’t get to be upset. “Why are you avoiding me?” The vulnerability he felt leaked through into his voice when he spoke.
“What do you mean why?” Pansy pulled a face. “You and Harry have only been here for two years and both years you end up fighting the Dark Lord and almost dying.”
“My sincerest apologies,” Draco said, sounding completely insincere as he put his book on the nightstand and lay down.
He shrugged, coming around to her side so she didn’t have to twist around to see him. “They kind of are.”
“What’s on your mind, Draco?” she asked in french. That was one of the nice things he enjoyed about hanging out with Claudette, getting to practice his french.
"You ready?" Blaise was back. Harry smiled and forced a laugh, trying to make up for Draco's sullenness. "Probably not."
“He’s my Godfather. He asked me if I wanted to live with him instead of the Dursley’s once his name was cleared.” Harry’s heart was everywhere and nowhere all at once as confusing as that seemed. Gone from his chest where it felt like it had been ripped from, clogging his throat and sunk to his stomach. “That isn’t going to happen now.”
There was less than a week left of the break left. Harry lay in bed in the still dark silence, unmoving. He’d grown so used to falling asleep beside Draco. So used to the other boy hogging the blankets, so used to falling asleep to the sound of Draco’s gentle deep breathing, so used to waking up with their legs tangled together, sometimes their backs pressed together, other times their faces inches apart.
There is something I never got around to telling you during our brief meeting. It was I who sent you the Firebolt. Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I used your name but told them to take the gold from Gringotts vault number seven hundred and eleven - my own. Please consider it as thirteen birthdays' worth of presents from your godfather.
Harry looks down at his soaking wet trainers. His socks are damp and he can hardly feel his frozen toes. He wiggles them around a bit, trying to regain sensation. Harry knows he appears rather shabby, that his clothing must look very old and worn, especially in a place like Malfoy Manor. He doesn’t know what to say so he keeps his eyes averted and shakes his head.
She kissed them both on the forehead and hugged them tight. “Study hard, but not too hard. Don’t forget to have fun, but not too much. Stay on your teachers good sides and-”
But this is just Harry, why does Draco feel this way. A feeling of heavy dread settles over Draco as realization hits him over the head. No no no no no. Harry’s his best friend, just his best friend. They’re close, sure, like friends are. His heart is pounding. Merlin, why did Harry have to go and get buff. Then Harry’s eyes meet his and Draco knows with sinking certainty.  Nope. No way. He’s just a closeted gay harmonal teenager. That’s what this is. He’ll just hook up with some random guy in a bathroom. That’s all he needs. There’s no way he has feelings for Harry.
Pansy gasped and sat up so fast that watching her made Harry’s head spin. “We should make friendship bracelets!”
Harry was about to pull Draco in for a kiss to tease Blaise when he caught sight of Pansy and a boy who must’ve been Adam descending the stairs. He had broad shoulders and straight black hair. He moved with a lithe grace that reminded Harry of the way Draco moved.
The next morning Harry, Pansy and Draco were eating breakfast together when the sound of owls swooping into the Great Hall came from the rafters to drop off mail. Draco only just managed to not ask why Harry hadn't been sent anything. He barely remembered that Harry didn't have anyone to send him anything so the two of them shared the box of fudge brownies from his mother
Draco took a step closer to Harry and reached out a hand to grip his shoulder. Normally Draco didn’t do physical contact so Harry understood the weight behind the moments Draco consciously reached out. Over the last few months as he and Harry had gotten closer Draco had realised that touch grounded Harry, who hadn’t gotten very much touch as a child either.
Draco rolled his eyes at the banter and tried to quench the jealousy he was feeling from the way Harry was smiling and joking with the Gryffindors. Usually it was Draco who was on the receiving end of most of Harry’s attention and it annoyed him how much he didn’t like watching other people get it.
“You boys are making such a mess,” his mother shook her head, taking out her wand, she vanished the snow before it melted and ruined the hardware floors.
“I’m not daft, Draco,” Harry snapped, bitterly, standing up and pacing. “The letter is pretty self explanatory. It’s a love letter. Clemonte goes on and on about how much that evening in the library, when he stuck his tongue down your throat, meant to him. I’d kind of caught onto the gist of it when he compared your hair to winter fire and your skin to fine porcelain. I especially liked that part when he said your lips are as pink as the petals that will bloom on the cherry blossom trees next spring and even softer to kiss-”
"Prick," Harry mumbled under his breath but did as he was told. When Harry got back to the table he pushed all the ingredients in front of Draco. "Your Highness."
“I’m not in love with Griffin Clemonte.” The moment he the words were out he felt stupid. Harry was clearly devastated over his godfathers death and here Draco was clearing up his feelings for Harry as if that was anywhere near as important.
Harry spent the rest of the afternoon writing to Sirius and Remus who were living together at Grimmauld Place. He enjoyed reading the letters he got from them, half written by each with notes added by one to the other’s section. Draco sat on the couch across from him, reading a book by a classic muggle author, Pansy sat on the one he was leaning against flipping through her most recent issue or Witches Weekly. Blaise sat closer to the fire as he wrote a letter to his mother while Theo lay on the rug to take a nap, his arm draped over his eyes. When an old grandfather clock in the corner struck five o’clock Draco suggested that they all get changed for supper.
Draco just shrugged and went back to looking over the balcony railing. I don’t think so, Harry thought. Scooping a handful of snow over the arm of the chair on his other side, so Draco wouldn’t see, he packed it tight before hurling it at the other boy.
Draco remembered what Claudette had said before. How did he not see it? “You were acting so jealous.”
The train released a warning whistle and they hurried their goodbyes with his mother (“See you boys at christmas!”) to board the train and get a compartment. The only one that was empty enough to fit them all was the one with Theodore Nott, a Slytherin boy in their year, who was sprawled out on one of the seats, his legs up and back against the window wall.
Harry stretched his legs out in front of him and twisted so that his back popped. He let out a sigh of satisfaction. “What do you care?”
“Actually I hadn’t but thanks for letting me know.” Harry grit his teeth and slumped further into the sofa.
“This summer is the Quidditch World Cup. I’ll write to you about pick up sooner to the day of, Harry,” Draco told him.
She winced but tried to hide it, looking down as she straightened her skirt. “Could you just trust me about this.”
His door burst open and Harry whirled around, his wand already drawn, only to see the blurry faces of Draco and Pansy.
Draco had never felt so on top of the world than in that moment standing at the top of the hill with all his friends, looking down at the view before them.
"You suck Parkinson," He sighed, letting his head fall back against the arm of the sofa. "Honestly Blaise, thank you. I might pass now." He said, yawning.
He sat beside her in Transfigurations while Draco and Theodore at the desk in front of them. McGonagall had just finished her lesson and Harry set down his quill, hand cramping from writing so much.
“And I guess I was just wondering what’s wrong? If there’s anything I can do? If you want to talk or rant or anything.”
"Seriously serious?" He loved how easy the banter always was between them. He knew he’d have a friend in Pansy for a long long time.
The stands thundered as the audience roared. Draco wondered at his peers ability to be so lively as rain poured down on them all. A small smile curved his lips as he watched the rest of the slytherin quidditch team tackle Harry the moment his feet touched the ground. The Gryffindors looked miserable. The game had been so close, Draco couldn’t blame them. It had been a tie all the way up until Harry had pulled some impressive moves to catch the snitch.
“Never have I ever!” Pansy screwed up her face as she thought. “Never have I ever smoked a cigarette!”
“Theodore, are you seriously rolling a joint right now?” Pansy demanded. Harry’s eyes went to what Theo was taking out of the plastic bag and had to suppress his grin. Classic Theo.
Harry pulled a face, disbelieving of what Draco was telling him. "How's a hat meant to tell me what house I'm in?"
Draco raised his eyebrows and took off his sweater, there was a white T-shirt on underneath. Pansy protested but Draco had technically accomplished the dare and they moved on.
“Yeah, I’ll be fine, Pans,” he reassured her even though it felt like he could physically feel something breaking in his chest.
Harry’s knees grew wobbly. The story made no sense at all. How could Scabbers be Pettigrew? But twelve years was a very long life for a rat, even a magic one. And Scabbers was missing a toe on his front paw. Just the way the only thing they’d been able to find of Peter had been a finger. Harry’s blood ran cold as everything Lupin and Black told them started to add up. Draco, Pansy, Hermione, Ron and Harry all exchanged looks of distrust and unease as Black explained how he’d tracked down Pettigrew, how he’d seen the picture of the Weasley’s in the Daily Prophet, how there, on Ron’s shoulder, had been Scabbers.
“Of course, Pans. You’re wonderful,” he said, smiling down at her as he wiped away the fresh tears on her cheeks. “The only reason anyone might think any of those things about you is because they don’t know you. That’s their loss.”
The rest of their ride to Hogwarts continued in pretty much the same way. Draco imagined Theo would be a new addition to their friend group this year. He didn’t mind, the kid was funny. Draco just wished he could be the one to make Harry laugh like that.
Draco huffed. He’d had too much to drink to filter anything he said right now. He should just go to sleep. “You look handsome, happy?”
Dumbledore came in behind her. “I want to take Harry home this summer. We know he lives with his emotionally abusive Aunt and Uncle. They make him live under their staircase, Dumbledore.”
His mood on the train ride from Hogwarts started off dreary. He was not only disappointed that he wouldn’t get to live with Sirius but he was also upset that Lupin wouldn’t be returning the next year as Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor because Snape “accidentally” let slip that he was a werewolf.
"You know him?" Pansy turned to the boys behind her. "Well why didn't you say so?" Neither of them answered her. She turned back to Harry and Draco. The latter introduced himself.
“Because it makes me jealous, alright? I’m jealous. And angry. Is that what you wanted to hear? Are you happy now?!”
Harry groaned and lay down on the sofa, putting his head in Pansy’s lap. He closed his eyes when she started stroking his hair. It felt particularly good because she had long fake nails. Harry wasn’t sure he was a big fan of them, they were sort of scary, except in moments like these.
They were sitting on the chalet balcony overlooking the mountain. It was one of the most beautiful things Harry thought he’d ever seen. The snow covered trees that went on forever without an end in sight. “Well, have you ever tried it?”
Carved pumpkins with flickering candles within floated above the students as they walked through the halls. It was Halloween and Harry was really looking forward to the feast this evening. His thoughts of the food that would be served were interrupted.
Draco stood outside the slytherin changing room, waiting for Harry to come out. He’d known the other boy long enough to know he’d want to shower and change before the celebration party that was probably being put together now. Draco stood, skulking in the shadows and waited for all of Harry’s teammates to leave the changeroom. He counted each of Harry’s teammates exit the changeroom, waiting for Harry to come out.
“That was grumbly. No way was that a term of endearment!” Harry exclaimed, as always, completely oblivious.
“This is revolting.” Blaise licked a thick strip up the bottom of Theo’s foot then made a hacking noise. “I need water.”
He supposed that was true. Biting the inside of his cheek and fidgeting with his sleeve he asked, “Are you and father going to be here this year?”
Harry had a feeling then that this year was going to be quite the difficult one, Dark Lord rising to power aside.
However, only seconds after Gabriel and Timothy had left, their banter fading, he heard the change room door swing open again. He turned, thinking maybe one of the boys had left something behind, but froze upon coming face to face with Draco.
Your mother and I have been together for a long time. When I first met her we were young and infatuated. Unfortunately infatuation isn’t enough to make a marriage last. But we had you, so we’ve been trying to make this work for years. It’s been harder since you left for Hogwarts. You know how your mother is, she’s crazy. I’ll never understand that woman or her logic. She’s so bossy I just couldn’t stand her anymore.
Harry voiced Draco's thoughts. "They're dead." So were Harry's eyes. The other boy was looking away from him now and out the window. They were flying through the country.
“I hate when you speak french. I never know what you’re saying,” grumbled Harry, though he didn’t mean it.
Draco gave his parents one last glance before steering his trolley towards the train, Harry close behind. When they were close enough to board the train the two boys took their trunks from the trolleys and hauled them through the length of the train until they reached an empty compartment. Harry helped Draco lift his into the overhead shelves. When both were stowed away they looked each other over.
Harry’s own cheeks burned. Daco wasn’t wearing anything and the only thing covering him up was a towel wrapped loosely and hanging low around his hips. Droplets of water fell in rivulets down Draco’s porcelain pale chest. Harry dragged his eyes up to the other boys.
“You should probably take one too so you don’t catch a cold. I can finish making this for you. It’ll be ready and warm by the time you’re done.”
Harry sat back down beside Draco, heavily. He took a deep breath in, trying to hold it together, breathed out. He looked up at Draco miserably. “You should have gone with them.”
Tears sprung to Draco’s eyes and threatened to spill down his cheeks. He blinked furiously trying to keep them from doing so.  He stabbed a finger at Harry. “YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO BE MY BEST FRIEND!”
Harry knew how hard Draco was on himself, how deeply he loved and cared for his friends, how much he doubted their love in return. His chest filled with determination to show the other boy how worthy he was.
Theo turned back to Harry as he bit into the frog. “Right then, so not including Pansy,” he said, chewing with his mouth partially open.
"We should head back," Draco says gently. He quickly adds, "So we're more comfortable. And inside," before Harry can protest.
"Always only thinking about yourself. Anyway, I left, and ran into some first years who seemed intent on asking me a million questions. It felt like a very personal interview with someone from the Daily Prophet. I tried to bypass them but they kept following me. I eventually snapped at them, told them to get lost. I think I scared them."
"Nobody's going to see that. Mine are on my neck. I'll have to wear a scarf tomorrow, I hope you know that."
He was losing sleep because of Draco. He was losing sleep because of all the people Draco had hurt and killed in the name of being a good Malfoy. Hours after the war had concluded, Draco had pondered over the idea of what would have happened if things had been different. What if he hadn't been stupid enough to let Death Eaters into the School; what if he hadn't been persuaded into taking the Dark Mark; what if he hadn't insulted Weasley during their first train ride to Hogwarts, and both he and Potter had become friends with him? Would things have turned out differently? Would they have even had a war?
Draco noticed a significant lack of photos of the Weaslette. There were plenty of her with her brothers, or with Granger and Lovegood, but only one of her and Potter together; and even then, they were separated by Mrs Weasley standing proudly between them. Draco found himself frowning as he scanned the walls with quick eyes, certain he had missed the photos of them together. He could have sworn they were dating. Had he been wrong?
"Sorry," Potter tried to say, but he was interrupted by another yawn. He laughed. "Wow, geez. That food really made me sleepy."
"It's not you," Harry says between sobs. He's gasping for breath now and Draco so desperately wants to hold him, but he understands he needs space. He lets Harry have his space because it's the least he can do.
He knows this has gone from a zero-to-one hundred situation much too fast. Harry was crying not five minutes ago, but now he's crying out Draco's name in desperation, and Draco can't find himself to care. However, he does pull away, just for a second, to make sure Harry is okay.
"Can't go anywhere without seeing your face, can I, Potter?" Draco sneers, but there's no heat behind it.
A resigned silence fell over the two of them. Weasley looked like he wanted to argue but couldn't decide what to argue on. Draco felt rather much the same way.
The room was nicely decorated, unlike Draco's room, which he had kept bare and empty. A visual representation for how he felt on the inside, really. Lots of pictures of Potter and his friends covered up most of the walls. There was a spotty plant by the window, which Draco gave an affectionate smile. That had to have been a gift from Longbottom.
It was as if the room could sense a new alliance. The buzz of their combined magic became overwhelming. A soft whine filled the silence, lasting no more than a few seconds before it exploded into fireworks that neither boy could see, but both could feel. Draco looked around with surprise, and when his eyes met Harry's, a jolt of electricity shot up his arm.
"I was crying because I felt like we were on different pages. Ron and I argued over what was happening between us. He accused you of using me, that our sneaking around was the only way you would ever see me. I tried to say otherwise, but Ron's stubborn. So am I, I guess. He told me to get my shit together or stop talking about it, which was fair, but it still hurt. I haven't told Hermione yet, so I couldn't even confide in her. And I don't trust anyone else."
The first thing he needed to do was to get a good look at Potter himself. No doubt Granger and Weasley were sound people to determine Potter's state, but their opinions were nothing but hearsay to Draco's own conclusions. Draco was only going to be able to make a successful sleeping potion if he had a better idea of how Potter was coping.
Draco picked up the remaining treacle tart and placed the whole thing in his mouth in one go. Potter watched on with wide eyes, his expression a dangerous mix of awe and disgust, which Draco dignified with a grin. His cheeks protruded outwards from the stuffing in his mouth, and a few crumbs slipped between his lips, to which both boys groaned at.
Potter's room was the first door to the right after you came off the stairs. Draco's room was one door over from Potter's, separated by an unoccupied room nobody had dared tried to enter. After the hell that was the Room of Requirement, everybody had been much too afraid to accidentally open Pandora's box again. McGonagall hadn't mentioned anything about it, so they all left well enough alone. Draco didn't even spare it a glance as he passed bye; using his fear instead to fuel him forward and knock on Potter's door before he could convince himself otherwise.
“Now that you know what to do, it's time for you to actually execute the transfiguration. Please get into groups to share owls.”
Pansy stopped running her fingers through his hair long enough to give him a sharp look. “There’s a difference between getting laced every once and awhile and walking around high most of the time like Theodore does.”
"Nice one!" Flint hollered, his voice was raspy in his throat. "Throw it back." Harry did, because as it turned out he didn't mind this sort of catch that resulted in adrenaline pumping through his veins. What with the wind in his hair, tears streaming out of the corners of his eyes he went so fast, his heart hammering in his chest and making him feel more alive than ever before.
This obviously wasn’t true. Harry had never seen Pansy cry before. Ever. He’d seen each and every single one of his other friends cry at least once. Draco over not being able to find the pair to a very specific set of socks he apparently just had to wear despite him owning a plethora of other socks. Another time over not having anymore of the facial cleanser he used at night before bed. He’d cried about clogged pores and oily skin. The strangest time might have been when he’d yelled at Harry to kill a spider then cried when he did. Blaise when he was telling them all at a meal, as they ate steak, that cows had friends and that they mourned one another when they died. He’d been fine until later that night. Harry found him flopped over in bed crying and laughing at himself about the “poor cows”. Theo had cried when he rolled a joint he said looked “funny”. Whatever that meant. Come to think of it Theo cried a lot when he was high. About really weird stuff. Pansy on the other hand, he had never seen cry. This, unlike most of what he’d seen his other friends cried about, seemed important.
I am enclosing something else for you, which I think will make your next year at Hogwarts more enjoyable.
“Malfoy isn’t it?” Lockart asked. “Malfoy, surely, as a teacher at Hogwarts you’d trust me to assist-”
Harry had never been anything like the annual Malfoy Christmas Party before. He’d finally accepted the point to having four living rooms as the entire house was full of witches and wizards. Draco must have noticed Harry’s hesitancy with the crowd because he’d pulled Harry back up to his room to talk for a bit.
Pansy nodded, understanding, and Draco tried to relax his tense shoulders. His whole body was stiff with stress. “I won’t tell anyone. Don’t worry,” Pansy reassured him, voice soothing as she took his hand between both of hers and squeezed it.
Whispers followed him as he made his way up to the front of the Great Hall so that McGonagall could place the sorting hat on his head. Crabbe, Goyle, Draco and Pansy had all already been sorted into Slytherin. Now it was his turn.
Harry shoved Theo’s voice out of his head and tried to imagine a naked girl. He’d seen a few busty women in Blaise’s magazines he thought he’d hidden well and tried to imagine them in numerous scenarios but found they did very little. Harry tried a few girls he knew, hoping maybe that would do more but Megan Jones on her knees, Hannah Abbott riding him and Lavender Brown under him did nothing for him. Then it came to him. Pansy. Of course. Why hadn’t he thought of his girlfriend before? He squeezed his eyes tight and tried to imagine her hand jerking him off instead of his own. Imagined her tongue on him. Imagined himself in her. He sighed, frustrated, when that didn’t work either. Maybe masturbation just wasn’t his thing.
“They’re really good! I couldn’t just not get them for you,” he said, defensively, as he slid out of bed and made his way toward the bathroom. “Come on, get up, it’s present time.”
Theo smirked, winking at the woman when he kissed the hand she’d extended to him. “That would be me.”
Harry pulled his books to his chest tightly, a wave of disorientation passing through him. “What? That random girl from a few days ago?”
“Take this you big wuss,” said Draco, handing him the jumper he’d pulled off earlier in truth or dare.
Harry made a show of draping the cloak around his shoulders. It wasn’t a particularly impressive thing compared to the silver and green cloak Draco had told Harry he could keep which is why he was puzzled by Draco’s reaction. The boy sat up fast, mouth hanging open. “What the bloody hell! That’s an invisibility cloak!”
He knew his friends knew something was up, but so far Pansy was the only one aware of the specifics.
Anger like he’d never felt before roared up in Harry. “YOU FUCKER! I DON”T THINK HE WOULD HAVE WANTED YOU TO BETRAY HIM AND MY MOTHER!” Harry yelled as he lunged at Black, but Draco and Pansy held him back. “LET ME GO! HE KILLED MY PARENTS AND I”M GOING TO KILL HIM!”
Flint grunted. "That's right." The older boy sucked on his cheek as he surveyed Harry.  "Would you have any interest in playing for Slytherin?" Harry grinned so wide he thought his face might crack open.
She nodded and twirled a strand of curling dark hair between her fingers.. “Your boyfriend is a jealous one.”
“Don’t call me a nutter when you’re hair looks like that.” Harry glanced up from his food but looked back down quickly because of the look Pansy was giving him. He hated when her eyes were all pointy like that at him. Not that he maybe didn’t deserve it right now.
“What?” Harry stood stock still, his face was flushed from his rant and his expression was one of bewilderment.
“I don’t think they’ll accept him,” Blaise said, refilling his scotch glass. “Apparently they’ve all got some thick sticks up their asses in Russia. They wouldn’t want word to get around that they take in boys like Aldrich when Hogwarts won’t let him stay. It would make them seem inferior.”
“Pansy, we’re best friends,” Harry huffed. “Can you imagine how weird it would be if he found out I was head over heels for him?”
"So why did you say it?" Draco only shrugged. "Don't do it anymore, okay? People won't want to hang out with us."
Her eyes swam with tears but she blinked them away. “Thanks, Theodore. Sorry you have to see me like this,” she sniffed.
Harry hesitated for only a moment before handing over the thrashing rat. Lupin took him and looked to Black. “Together?” Black nodded and stepped forward, holding up the wand he’d taken from Draco in the struggle when they’d first entered the Shrieking Shack.
“Of course I can. I’ll send him an owl this afternoon- Theo what the fuck is that?” Draco demanded. Peeking out the top of Theo’s robe sleeve was the head of a snake.
“When did I realise I was pathetically pining after my best friend?” Harry ran both hands through his hair. “When it finally dawned on me why I was so upset about seeing him make out with another guy. When seeing him eat a dripping nectarine and lick his fingers is enough to give me a boner.”
Draco stared at him, eyes round. The other boy was suddenly speechless. They stood in silence. Harry expected any reaction except the way he actually did.
“Nope, orange is.” Theo looked all too pleased with himself, leaning back, crossing his leg over so his ankle rested on his knee, smirking.
It was the last evening of the winter break and students were milling around the common room, settling back in. They’d arrived around noon on the Hogwarts express and she’d only just finished unpacking her trunk when she’d received the letters. A Hogwarts house elf had delivered them to Pansy before snapping his fingers and vanishing in a puff of smoke. She sat down in a leather chair with a high back and stared at them, dread rising in her gut. She had a good guess about the contents of the letters. They came in thick yellow envelopes, the wax seal displaying the Parkinson family crescent. The first had her name written across the front in her mother's familiar elegant cursive. The other had her name across the front in her fathers loopy scrawl. The letters themselves weren’t anything impressive. They weren’t long. Only a few lines.
“Ron told us all about how you couldn’t get your Aunt or Uncle to sign the Hogsmeade permission slip.”
Dumbledore fixed Draco with a hard look. “When Hogwarts was created there were fours founders, the namesakes of the four houses. Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students they taught at Hogwarts. He believed that only all magic wizards and witches, in other words purebloods, should be allowed to study magic. The other founders of Hogwarts disagreed. Unable to persuade his co-founders Salazar left the school. Before leaving however it was believed that he’d built a hidden chamber, the chamber of secrets. Before he left the school he sealed it off. It is said that only his true heir can open it and unleash the horrors, the beast within, that would purge Hogwarts of those unworthy, in Salazar’s view of studying magic.”
Out of the corner of his eye Harry saw Draco bite into the nectarine. Juice spilled down over his lips and dripped from his chin. Harry licked his lips and threw down a random card when his turn came around. He swallowed hard and leaned back against the couch behind him. He held his cards up in front of his face, doing this made it easier to look at Draco without making it obvious that he was doing so.
The snitch changed direction just as Harry was about to grab it and he grit his teeth in frustration as it shot up toward the sky. Harry pulled the front of his broom up to gain height and followed in pursuit even though he lost some  of his speed. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Ravenclaws seeker just barely avoid crashing into the stands. He shot after the snitch, it whistled through the air, twisting around the players, Harry wove between them, trying to catch the little golden ball.
“Not necessarily, follow me.” Harry led Ron down to the dungeons where the Slytherin dorms were. “Wait here,” Harry said, indicating a statue. “I’ll be back in a moment.” He raced to his room and was busy pulling out his invisibility cloak from the bottom of his trunk from under his bed when a voice startled him and he hit his head.
Maybe Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were playing a cruel joke, he wouldn't put it past them. But what about Diagon Alley? That couldn't have been made up. Beginning to wallow in despair Harry began to feel as though he were fading into the whirl of conversations going on around him.
On the way to the living room Draco got another look at Griffin. Why didn’t boys this good looking attend Hogwarts?
Draco led Griffin up the stairs to the library. His heart pounded in his chest and his palms felt sweaty.
Rushing up to them Harry was out of breath when he reached the small group. "Pardon me but could you show me to platform 9 and 3/4?"
“Or we could ditch and stay here,” Harry mused, refusing to let Draco get away by looping legs around the other boys waist and his fingers through his belt loops and dragging him back to him. He pressed himself closer and languidly kissed Draco’s neck and relished in the noises that came from him.
Harry and Draco ended up in a gigantic library playing wizard's chest when Dobby appeared instantaneously before them to give them the treacle tart. The creature seemed to really want to talk to Harry but Draco dismissed him and the house elf left them alone to continue playing until dinner when he appeared in the same way, shocking Harry and making him start hard enough to jostle the game board and upset the pieces. (“How the hell do you get used to that?” he asked Draco, feeling rattled. Draco had only shrugged. “Dobby’s been around my whole life. I never had to get used to it, it was just kind of normal I guess.”)
“I swear I didn’t mean to.” His eyes widened and his thick dark eyebrows rose. He had rather interesting features, Pansy thought. His brown hair was a rumpled wavy birds nest atop his head, nearly as bad as Harry’s. He had fine bone structure, a sharp jaw and a long, straight nose. His lips were full and plush and for a moment Pansy thought about kissing them. But that was silly.
Harry wet his lips, his mouth felt suddenly very dry as the full force of how protective he felt toward Draco washed over him. It was stronger, he realised, than the protectiveness he felt for anyone else. The notion terrified him. Draco was the one he loved above all else, the one he’d kill for.
The other boy gave him an impatient look. Harry loved how easy it was to rile him up. “Especially not those ones. Please tell me your joking?”
“I thought you knew that considering I’ve been snogging you at every opportunity possible,” Draco said, blushing.
Great so now we're playing fetch. Harry internally signed but didn't have much time to think because Marcus had pitched the apple and it was descending quickly. Harry raced after it, but the apple was dropping too fast. Acting before he thought about whether or not what he was doing was a good idea Harry pushed his broom into a dive, steep enough to snatch the apple before it hit the ground. He just managed to pull the broom back up before face planting into the dirt.
Pansy grimaced and gave him an apologetic look. “I realize now I should have phrased that a little differently perhaps.”
Harry rolled his eyes at his friends dramatics. “If your piss is this shade of yellow, Zabini, you are intensely dehydrated.”
Blaise frowned and looked over at Theo. “But he wears weird shit. I don’t want to wear any of the things he’s wearing right now.”
“I got it for Christmas last year,” Harry started to explain as they half sprinted up to the second floor. “At first I had no idea who sent it to me. There was no sender's name attached. But then I found out at the end of last year that it was from Dumbledore-”
“This is the best vodka any of you will ever have in your life. This is premium stuff, guys.” He took a long sip and passed it to Harry. It burned his throat and made his eyes water. He handed it off to Draco who raised his eyebrows but took a long chug too. They passed the vodka around as Draco showed them the kitchens and dining rooms, all the bedrooms and sitting rooms.
Harry tried to keep his eyes down on his cards but the way Draco eating a nectarine was more distracting than it should have been.
Pansy walked into the infirmary, letting the doors fall closed behind her. She spotted Harry, Draco and Ron immediately. They were the only patients sitting up and moving. The rest of them were stone still, petrified.
“Then...but of course!” She said, like something was occuring to her, she collapsed in a fit of laughter.
Harry stood up and covered his face with his hands. His heart pounded against his chest, so hard. His thoughts were reeling.
Draco’s face twisted. “So, maybe Clemonte can just go and fall for someone after sticking his tongue down their throat but that doesn’t mean I do.”
“Well let’s go in, shall we?” He said, after stepping away from hugging Harry. Theo picked up the knocker and slammed it down on the thick wood of the door. The sound was joltingly loud and abrasive.
Harry had noticed Draco being uncharacteristically quiet. Usually if they were talking Draco had an opinion and he was very vocal about it, it was weird that Draco hadn’t spoken up. Harry felt the cushion beneath him shift as Draco fidgeted and pulled his legs up onto the sofa.
“No, of course not.” But fear was gathering in the pit of Draco’s stomach. Why couldn’t they have one nice, normal school year, for once?
“Well then I remembered something else. After every attack, at the place it occurred, there have been spiders fleeing the scene. It’s been the same every time. So I checked the books again and look what I found.” Hermione dug into her bag and pulled out a book. She flipped through the pages until she found the one she was looking for then turned it around for them to read.
Harry reached out and cupped Draco’s face in his hands to deepen the kiss. Draco gave a little breathy moan that made Harry melt. To his disappointment a second later the other boy pulled away. “We should go meet the others.”
Harry sat on his bed, motionless, staring out the underground windows at the turquoise water beyond. The dormitory door opened and Harry’s eyes flicked to the door to see Draco, his eyes went back to the water. The other boy came and sat at the edge of his bed with him.
“Yeah, I know.” Harry glanced at Draco’s face, searchingly. He seemed to find what he’d been looking for because he kept talking. “Sirius said I should do something. I don’t know. Maybe, it’s stupid, I know, but I was thinking maybe I could teach kids?”
Pansy took a shaky breath. Without giving herself time to digest she opened her father’s letter. It was significantly more negative and passive aggressive.
“Well either you can use it or continue to look like a Gryffindor banner,” Mrs Malfoy told her son, winking at Harry who grinned.
“Before all the decent ones are gone.” His skin felt uncomfortable, tingly. Why did his skin feel tingly? That wasn’t a normal skin feeling. He reached up and adjusted his tie. Desperate to pertain some image of normalcy he asked, “So, who’d you ask Theo?”
Before I continue, I find it important to express that I have always acted in a way that I’d hoped would make you proud of me. I would never intentionally attempt to disappoint or disrespect you.
“How did you know which ones I wanted? They’re for potions outside of class, they wouldn’t have been in the textbook.”
The door swung open, “You’re here!” She shrieked with happiness, cutting off Theo and knocking him back by the force of Pansy throwing her arms around his neck.
"I was wondering if any of you had studied for tomorrow's herbology test?" The boy asked, bracing himself with his hands and leaning against the sofa he and Pansy were slumped in.
Harry fell into Draco’s arms and clung to him desperately. They fell asleep curled into each other, the knowledge that something they couldn’t stop, something dark, was coming.
“No, I can’t imagine she was,” Pansy said wryly. “Alright, my turn. I’ll save you the energy of having to ask, I’ll do a dare, Theodore.”
“If I knew why I wouldn’t be asking!” Draco descended the stairwell at what was nearly a run as Harry sped walked after him. “Come back here and talk to me!”
“We’re not the best people in Dumbledore’s eyes,” his mother admits. “He likely would prefer that Harry didn’t spend any time with us at all.”
“My father’s probably in his study and my mother’s probably in her sitting room. They don’t really do Christmas. Usually if we want something we just get it, instead of waiting for one day.” Harry wasn’t sure what to say to that. “Want some more eggnog? Last night was a lot more fun with it.” Draco left the room and came back with two glasses, the eggnog and a bottle of pure malt whiskey. They spent the morning slowly getting tipsy, busting into fits of laughter while they opened all the gifts.
He only let go when she pulled away to wipe at her nose so it wouldn’t drip on his shoulder. That would have been really embarrassing and gross.
“Nott, is going to be late if he doesn’t sprint fucking run. McGonagall will give him detention for sure and Pansy won’t have a date this weekend to Hogsmeade. Do you want a date to Hogsmeade or do you want me to walk you to your classes?”
Getting an idea Draco swiped Harry's glasses off his face and shoved them up his own nose. "Shut up, Malfoy," he mimicked.
"Come, Draco dearest, we must get you to the platform before the train departs. The Hogwarts Express isn't waiting for anyone."
Harry’s thoughts whirled with all the screaming and yelling. He felt as though nothing were adding up, like there were massive parts of a puzzle that he was missing and without them he couldn’t make out the full picture.
Harry leaned to see out the window. Theo was pointing at a rather beautiful woman with smooth dark skin and deep brown hair that fell in tight curls around her face. She was tall and willowy with small breasts and an hourglass figure. She rich blue robes that fell from her shoulders and hung from her frame in glittering swafts of fabric.
The young boy appeared out of the trains billowing steam so suddenly that Narcissa barely managed to catch the handle of Draco's trolley before it hit him. Time froze around Narcissa Malfoy at the sight of the bespectacled child. It couldn't be, but it was.
“It was a rooster actually, but thanks. I just remembered what that book Hermione had shown us mentioned that it’s cry is fatal to a Basalisk.”
Steam billowed on the platform and the group quickly made their way onto the train. They were there early enough for some of the good compartments to still be free.
Harry shook his head hesitantly. Marcus stared at him a heartbeat longer, seeming to consider him. "You," he pointed at Malfoy. "Come down here and give me your broom. Potter, throw down that apple." Draco looked confused, and a bit ticked off to be told what to do but obliged. Soon Marcus was hovering a few feet away from him. "Go long okay?" The older boy ordered more than asked.
“The others aren’t half as observant as I am,” she replied flippantly, waving aside his worry. “Besides, if they thought they knew something I’d think they’d probably bring it up.”
From there things only got worse. For starters his Anti-Dementor lessons weren’t going half as well as he’d hoped they’d be going at this point. All he could produce was a vague shapeless silver shadow that was too feeble to drive the Dementor away. The first time had been the worst, having to listen to the sounds of his parents distressed last words.
Harry was already in a bad mood. The meal had been long and drawn out by their guests incessant questions. Even after that they had to sit through at least an hour of sitting in the living room and sipping at cups of brandy while Mrs Clemonte kept up the small talk. It certainly didn’t help his mood that the whole evening he kept catching Draco and Griffin trying to sneak glances at one another. He shoved down his annoyance and zoned back into the conversation Mrs Malfoy and Mrs Clemonte were having.
He shakes his head and wills words to come out of his mouth but he can’t find the right ones. He’s having a hard time even looking at her. Draco crosses his ankles and blinks his eyes hard, trying to not cry anymore.
Draco’s arms circled him and pulled him impossibly closer. Harry couldn’t get enough of him. His hands moved, cupping Draco’s face, pushing back his hood, scraping his fingers through his hair which was soft like warm silk before he wound his arms around Draco’s neck. He was delirious with pleasure. He groaned softly, low in his throat.
“I’m not,” Draco said, words clipped, expression pinched. “Merlin, why does it feel like we keep having this conversation.”
Just then the music slowed down and Pansy slid her arms around his neck. Harry tensed up, he’d never done much slow dancing before. The tension eased from his body before long though, turned out there wasn’t much to it. Slow dancing was mostly just swaying back and forth with your arms around another person.
It was a long time before Harry fell asleep that night. There was something so calming about falling asleep next to Draco. The other boy seemed so vulnerable and Harry found himself reveling in his ability to watch the other boy, cheek pressed to the pillow, mouth parted ever so slightly as he slept. That night when he slept he dreamed of doing the exact same thing, falling asleep and waking up in the same bed as Draco, but based on the appearance of the two of them, it was some many decades in the future.
At least he's not going to Durmstrang, she told herself. Narcissa had barely convinced her husband not to send their son off to such a wretched, fowl, and not to mention far, place. She glanced down at Draco and shuddered. No, that most certainly was not the place for her sweet boy. He didn't need anymore coldness in his life.
Around half way through the film, Harry let out a rather deep sigh. Draco froze for a moment, before he quietly called out Harry's name. When he got no response, he tried again. Harry remained motionless and didn't acknowledge Draco's attempts at gaining his attention. It took a moment for Draco to realise that Harry had fallen asleep.
They lapsed into silence, not exactly awkward but certainly not comfortable. This was the first time they had been alone since the war, and there were a million things Draco wanted to say. He would have said them, if he thought now was the appropriate time. But Potter had just admitted he was bisexual and Draco was stuck staring at his profile, the way his jaw was cut so sharp it could slice his fingers open, the way his hair fell over his glasses and into his eyes, and Draco couldn't even fathom bringing up such terrible topics right now. This moment was much too intimate for such things.
"And how do you suppose we do that, Harry? We have to have the right materials for me to lose my virginity properly."
They would have to talk more when Harry woke up. Draco was more than happy to help him in the interim, but they'd have to find another way to get Harry to sleep without him. Maybe he'd work alongside Harry in producing a spleen potion, rather than doing it himself. Maybe that would help. Either way, Draco was determined to be the one to fully cure Harry Potter of his sleep troubles. He wouldn't be doing it for anyone else but for his friend.
"I've looked through every book I can find," Granger said with a defeated sigh. "Both Professor McGonagall and Madame Pomfrey gave me permission to look in the Restricted Section of the library and I couldn't find anything. We fought through a war, Ron; I doubt any of us will be okay for a while, especially Harry. We just have to hope he wears himself out enough in the next few days that he passes out on his own accord."
