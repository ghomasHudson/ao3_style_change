Harry turned and exited the office, pausing at the door frame. “We’ll get him back on his feet, sir.” He squared his shoulders and made his way toward the lifts that would take him to the lobby and beyond to Valere Apothecary where he knew he would find Severus bent over steaming cauldrons.
“Closed another one, my dream team?” Harry grinned at them, but it faded when he caught Hermione’s scowl. “Oh, no, what’s gone wrong this time?” He asked as he pinched the bridge of his nose, pushing his glasses askew.
“Do you really think she did?” Draco grinned and took another sip of his wine. “That would make two of you.” Draco’s smile took on an edge that lit a fire in Harry’s libido.
Hermione rested her hand on Harry’s shoulder as the three of them watched Dean Thomas be moved to the intensive care unit of the hospital.
“Hermione mentioned that my brother has the resurrection stone in his possession.” Harry paced the ritual circle inlaid into the floor of the room in glimmering silver.
Hermione huffed as she followed him into Harry’s office. “I really don’t see why we should bother Harry with this, Malfoy. He is probably too busy to see us anyway. We can just tell him at home.”
“Keep your knickers on, Potter, can’t you see she’s doting on the magnificent me?” Draco teased as he pulled out of Hermione’s grasp and walked over to his lover and planted a firm kiss on him. “Alright, we’re ready. Off to see the wizard.” Draco chuckled at his own terrible pun.
“You know I haven’t seen him since the incident. I don’t see why I have to start now.” Hermione ground out before she willed her jaw to relax. It wouldn’t do for a dentist’s daughter to grind her teeth after all. She took another large slow breath to reign in her emotions. “Aside from the fact that he lied to all of us for years on end, he had me heavily drugged into believing that I was in love with him.” She could feel the rage swelling beneath the surface of her now calm exterior.
The chatter died down as all eyes turned to Hermione and Arthur. “I hope you’ll accept my apologies for what happened at the Burrow that time. I’ve spoken with them and tried to impress upon them the wrongness of his treatment of you, love. I’m sure they’ll come around.” His smile turned sad and Narcissa reached out and squeezed his hand.
She heaved a sigh and nodded. “Go on then.” She pulled Neville aside and began to catch him up on the latest Rontastrophe from their Weasley brunch.
“Harry, you know that’s not true. Viktor was the only one who even noticed me back then, and that was fourth year.” Hermione pulled away and sat at the table, pouring their wine. “If anyone else had been interested I’m sure Viktor wouldn’t have been the first person to ask me out on a date. He wouldn’t have been my first kiss, among other things.”
“Oh Harry, Darling, we were beginning to suspect you’d be too busy this week.” Molly Weasley engulfed Harry in a suffocating hug the moment he stepped clear of the floo inside the Burrow.
“Enough.” Arthur’s command stilled them, and even the pounding on the back door silenced. He must have called up wards in the chaos. “Hermione, darling, it was lovely to see you. Though I rather think that we ought to call it a day.” He smiled gently at her.
“Thank you for your time, Molly. That’s all the required questions. Now, I would like to let you know that when Hermione started to come back to us, we went to get her tested. Took her to Gringotts. They ran extensive tests, they were quite thorough. Their findings were quite disturbing and at odds with what it seems your precious Ronniekins has told you.” Draco stood, collected his ballpoint and notepad, and tucked them away in his pocket. “If you love her like a daughter, or ever loved her, ask Harry to show you what we found.” Draco watched the conflict across her face before he turned and exited the house without another word.
“Come on now, you know how important this new line is, Gred.” A stone settled in Draco’s gut. Who was Gred? He waited for a response but instead was treated to George’s frustrated groan of “Right. After this is done. It’s the last time. I swear.” Draco’s hand lowered and his brows drew together. What could George be working on that was so important, that he wasn’t working on it with another Weasley but this Gred fellow?
“Granger. What did that weasel want with you?” He turned his aggression toward her and she flicked her wand at him, immobilizing him where he stood.
“Now, my dear, come tell me all about your fabulous career.” Narcissa’s hand trembled slightly as she reached again for her cup and saucer.
Harry made his way to the minister’s office through the deserted halls and lifts of the ministry. It was well after hours and it seemed that the minister was burning the midnight oil over his backlog of paperwork. He stopped in front of the office door, the lamp light reflecting off the gilded name plate of Minister of Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt. The door swung open as Harry raised his hand to knock.
“It seems we’ve moved past boxes of chocolates.” She nodded toward the platter as she raised the cloche to reveal a glossy feather shaped cake surrounded by the words “I’m Levi-o-sorry”
“The usual.” She stood and patted his cheek while he was defenseless. “You know, it was surprising that it happened so soon, but it wasn’t unexpected. Are you done? Have you calmed down?” She backed away and took in his disheveled appearance and clucked her tongue at him. “I’d just done this tie up.” She released her hold on him and straightened his tie again.
“I need to ask you some questions, so please answer as best you can.” draco pulled out his notepad and flicked his wand at it and pulled his ballpoint out and enchanted it to take dictation temporarily. It wasn’t a dictionary-quill but it would do in a pinch.
“Do you want me to brush your hair too, Harry?” Draco offered. Harry looked at him unsure and hummed non-committedly, tapping his torc. He then spun around and walked out of the room determinedly.
“To prove my good intentions and that I mean you no harm, I'm giving you your freedom. The cup is still a portkey, all you need do it touch it and it will return you to Hogwarts.”
Harry smiled, then wrapped his arms around Severus for their morning hug.
That came out a lot warmer than Severus expected and even Harry was looking at him perplexed.
“And another nurse to give Poppy a hand.”
“Because you were sad, and I wanted to make you feel better, and Severus said... I thought Severus said that people do that to one another to make them feel good.”
Harry nodded and Severus pleased with how well this was going walked over to the chair that sat in-between their beds. He sat down and pulled the parchment from his pocket. He smoothed it out on his knees and cleared his throat.
Harry looked up at him eyes wide.
And even some saying. “that’s what his cock looks like? It’s got some length, I suppose, but there is nothing to it. His girl ain’t going to tell the difference between that and his fingers”
Sirius ducked his head and muttered with petulance. “I just frigging wanted to make sure it really was Harry and not some bloody trick.”
(someone walks close by the work)
“However, none of that changes the fact that I would like to talk to you. So far, we have only communicated through intermediates and things can get lost in translation. Unfortunately, we can’t talk now.”
Harry nodded looking down at his blanket miserably. “They want the boy-who-lived, their fairy-tale hero not me.”
“But what about our features that are the same?”
Harry sat down next to Draco and said earnestly.
Crying out with joy Severus begged. “Claim me. Mark me. So, everyone knows I’m yours.”
Mr Malfoy sighed. “There are those who believe this and unfortunately it has become the accepted view by the public, but it couldn’t be further from the truth.”
“Voldemort has returned!” Dumbledore yelled. The whole pub fell silent at this. Seeing this, Dumbledore rose to his feet, desperate as he had no other support to plead his case. “Voldemort has arisen and is raining chaos and destruction down upon Brittan. You must stand up and fight against him.” There was a long moment where no one spoke, then a rose rang out.
Sirius huffed quietly. Draco turned to the Grimm and spoke. “Cousin, we are going to be in the blue sunroom if you would like to watch.”
Using caring hands, Tom rolled him to lie on his back. Kneeling between his legs, Tom spoke.
“Nobody wants me,” was said in a defeated voice from behind them. Severus blinked in shock as Draco spun back around to face Harry.
“Yes. Please,” Severus begged. Tom entered him in slow, gentle thrusts. Once he was buried to the hilt, he paused letting Severus acclimatise to him. Once they were ready, he became to move.
“I also want my lover to promise me he will tell me the instant I do something that he does not like.” Tom stared without compromise into Severus’ eyes.
“Severus?” Tom interrupted his panic blabbering.
“I’m sorry,” he said.
“That will be one of the first things I will recommend that they change,” Filius stated firmly. “More teachers on hand will only help.”
“My Son,”
“Since Harry was still fucking standing and didn’t change his appearance, yes.”
“The Wizarding world is superb at seeing what they want to see and not what is really there, as you full well know. James Potter became their hero, and so they wanted to see him in you. ”
They lay quietly, letting Harry absorb this information.
Draco woke up and looked around in a panic. Something was wrong, but he couldn’t pinpoint what it was. His bedroom looked the same as it always did. Closing his eyes, he sent out his sense. A moment later his eyes sprang open, and he jumped out of bed. Harry!! Harry was in distress.
The next second a massive black dog appeared. Teeth gleaming as it let out a furious snarl. It leapt at Vernon knocking him to the floor and snapping its head down tore out his throat. Screams bounced off the walls. And there was a mad scramble of movement. Harry was kicked and trotted on as everyone tried to evade the snarling black mass of madness in their midst. Someone accidentally kicked him in the head, forcing him unconscious.
(See the end of the chapter for
“My Lord? Using Occlumency I have already searched my mind and I cannot find any memory of Lily and I together nor can I find any sight of tampering.”
“I’m not surprised, even I have only witnessed the sight once. If you grow your hair out some more the weight will help bring some control to the lot.”
He made sure that Albus heard him muttering sourly about his weekends being taken away from him. But the truth of the matter was his weekends had somehow become the hi-light, the thing he looked forward to and rewards himself with after the annoying tiring frustrations that he had to deal with while he was at Hogwarts.
“Yes, well, all Gryffindor’s are idiots.”
Sirius turned around and placed his arms on Harry’s shoulders.
Harry feeling like he was slightly floating again began to shake his head then paused before holding out his arm where Wormtail had taken his blood. Pomfrey waved her wand and looked at the diagnostic. She then summoned a jar and gently unwrapping the bandage she rubbed it into the cut before reapplying the bandage. Everything else seemed to be ok. Since he was dressed in the hospital pyjamas Pomfrey must have dealt with all the other wounds.
“What have you been up to this morning?” Severus asked.
“Yes, Harry dear?”
He continued to walk off calling out in Parseltongue
He waved Severus towards the seat opposite him. He had been hunting for the answer to how Severus became to be Harry's father. The opportunity had worked in his favour as he was able to miss lead the spies by throwing in Severus request with the rest of his demands on current politics, what went wrong with the resurrection potion, foreign affairs and so on. He made sure that each spy only got a tiny piece of the information so that no one person would know completely what it was he was after. The best way to keep them honest was by making sure they did not have much to betray.
task. Draco was naked, nude, completely bare, and he was…he was…
“This is a formal interview, Malfoy, and I’m required to obtain confirmation from you of any pertinent information, regardless of whether I already know or suspect the answer,” Harry fixed Malfoy with his best stern investigator expression, keen to gain the upper hand and keep it this time. “Is there somewhere we can speak privately?”
“Nev’s seen, like, war crimes,” Harry said, and cut into his tomato. It had just the right amount of salt and pepper on top. “He’ll be alright.”
Ten minutes into a conversation about the uses of Friar’s Balsam in the treatment of mermish fever blisters, and Harry was sliding his hand dangerously high on Draco’s thigh.
“I don’t,” Draco said, heart in this throat. “I don’t want anything from you.”
Harry! And half of it is now out of season!”
So she was just going to get right to it, then. “You tracked me down using questionable means to confront me about my routine?”
“Can you remember the first time you felt desired, Potter?” His lips were nipping at Harry’s ear with every word, and fuck, but Harry was hard, so fucking hard. He felt too hot. It was difficult to focus.
“Spare me five minutes to get a cup of tea.”
about it, honestly.” Weasley put a hand on his stomach, puffed with laughter. “Oh, I reckon that might almost be my favourite part of that whole year!”
“Not to me, I like them both.” Potter nudged Draco’s knees with his own, and Draco spread his legs further apart, and curved his spine, opening himself to Potter. He took Draco’s earlobe between his lips and teased it with sharp nips of his teeth, and Potter pressed one hand to the swell of Draco’s arse and traced a thumb over Draco’s entrance; his cock had left a generous smear of wetness on Draco’s skin, which Potter now circled his thumb through, pressing in gently and steadily until he breached him. Draco had only been exaggerating slightly; they had fucked, slowly and lazily, earlier that morning, but Draco was in no mood for slow now. He wanted to feel it, rough and quick. Potter seemed inclined to indulge him, twisting his thumb with quick efficiency but only working Draco just enough, just enough to make it work, to make it feel good, to bring Draco to the edge of rough, and too rough.
“What in Salazar’s name is this?”
“Thank you all for your cooperation. As you know, today is the quarterly planning meeting, and the objective of one and all of us is to convince our dear Undersecretary that our various causes are worthy of funds from the budget. Given the circumstances, this will be a challenge to say the least.” He cast his eyes around the room sternly. “In order to improve our chances, we need to tighten up our game, otherwise this is going to be a very boring quarter for the Department of Magical Games and Sport, and the Auror Corps will have our collective arses for the rise in crimes committed by the general public due to sheer idleness. Worse still, we will be the laughingstock of the international magical sporting community, and I think we all had our fill of that during the infamous spring of 2004. So, without further ado: The Rules. Firstly, if you’re wearing purple, anything purple at all, please immediately charm that item
in this lifetime.
“I’ve been using it since Wednesday,” Ron said, “I thought you knew.”
Malfoy knocked his shoulder against Harry’s, and signalled to the bartender for two more of the same. “You sure?” He tilted his head and looked at Harry. “You’ve been quiet. And you seemed like you couldn’t get away from us fast enough just before.”
forks from
The curry was tepid, and too salty. The rice was dry, and the roti rubbery. Draco poked at it sadly, while Weasley inhaled his jacket potato smothered in beans.
Harry’s laughter gave him butterflies.
It had gone so well, that Harry had gotten started on the other two rooms on the second floor that afternoon as well. Loads more dust, not as many Lego’s or stuffed moon calves. He left the beds stripped down to their mattresses for Draco to inspect, although Harry felt strongly that those should probably just be Vanished, and if there were any lingering, even slightly dark or creepy whispers of magic remaining, they were scoured out of existence now. The rooms now smelled just slightly of vanilla, and Windolene. One was a twin, ideal for Narcissa and Andromeda, and the other a small single room that they’d mutually decided would be ideal for McGonagall.
“Yeah. But I also really like
The door to the lab burst open and Harry looked up, startled, to find Devlin in the doorway holding an enormous branch from what looked like some sort of flowering bush. Harry pushed his glasses back up his nose, from where they had slowly slid down to hang precariously from the tip. The branch, and Devlin, came back into focus, and Harry realised that what had at first appeared to be flowers were actually large, semi-opaque rubber cocks.
“Are you going to fuck me, or play with me, Potter?” Draco was still breathing fast, and his cock had softened but was still heavy - it wouldn’t take much. Not much at all. Harry’s next kiss was almost a bite. “I’m not a fidget spinner, you know.”
, better than anything I had, and sometimes I feel...like it's better than I deserve. And so many people don’t have things, like I used to. I know I should do something with all of this, but...I get stuck, and I don’t know how to start.” He looked up at Draco. His hair was slipping out of its tie again, and his eyes were soft. “Then I feel guilty about it, and anxious, then it kind of spirals until I just shut the door.”
“I think we would have been friends.” Harry didn’t like the way his voice sounded. Earnest. Like he was really saying, I think I love you. I think I’m in love with you. I want to touch your stupid, pretty hair.
He returned to find Malfoy and Ron sitting alone - the others having gone for fresh drinks, or to the loo, or maybe just home - and their heads were bent rather closely together, in apparently intense discussion.
Draco looked at him softly. “Yeah, the boss gave me a compassionate day because my fiance nearly got killed to death in a workplace accident.”
Draco grunted. His skin was chafing slightly from the sea water. “Nice. Listen, I saw a chippy not far from here, and I’m fucking starving. Let’s pack up the van and get something to eat.”
“What is it?”
Malfoy confirmed that galleons were indeed fine, and Harry wondered again how it was going to look submitting an invoice for anatomically correct rubber genitals in his next petty cash claim.
“Oh,” Harry said, a peculiar mixture of pleased and disappointed at Malfoy’s departure. “Yeah, I’m hoping you can get your hands on a plant for me at short notice.”
Malfoy swigged his pint again, and tried to sneak his hand back into the packet. “Just what I need on my birthday.
stop crying, Hermione!”
Potter’s face was thunderous throughout the briefing. Well, throughout the portion he was able to attend, anyway.
“You couldn't have used a Patronus? That elf took a year off my life.”
it when he had to go away. Knowing that Draco would be there, in their flat, all alone, eating a bowl of cold, soggy cereal for his morning meal. Probably pouting sadly to himself. Draco loved breakfast too, mostly because Harry made it for him, and took so much care in preparing it, wanting him to start his day in the best way possible. Draco would lie-in most mornings, as long as possible, and would shuffle into the kitchen, usually nude, when he could hear the clink of cutlery being nudged aside by plates as they were set on the table. Draco smelled so good in the mornings, so warm and sweet, and his hair was all tangled and fluffy, and his eyes were all sleepy and round. It was mushy, Harry knew it was, and he'd never admit it to any of his friends, but sometimes he liked Draco to sit warm and naked and directly in his lap to eat breakfast, so that he could feed little bites of toast with apricot jam to him, or a segment of orange, or a moist piece of muffin. And they would talk idly about what they were doing today, and what needed to be added to the grocery list, and whose turn it was to renew the wards on their flat. Draco would yawn widely and then stretch, and every toned plane of muscle would shift under his velvety skin. They would also usually end up fucking, torturously slowly, on those days that Draco ate breakfast from his seat on Harry's lap. The milk and juice jugs would wobble and splash, as would the tea pot, while Draco rode Harry right there on the kitchen chair.
Harry drew a sharp breath and looked up at Malfoy, who was looking right back at him intently. He looked away again, cast his eyes across the club and saw that the busy workers had finished their business at the DJ booth, and the bar staff were ready at their stations. The music became fractionally louder, and the next moment the first wave of patrons came surging up the stairs and onto the floor, a rush of bodies moving to claim seats, to order drinks, to hustle into the restrooms and touch up cosmetics and hair-do’s.
Draco clasped his hand briefly, and took it off his neck. “I’ll be fine. You stay. Have a bit of fun for once.”
"We're friends," Potter interrupted fiercely, looking at Draco again. His eyes were shiny with the reflection of the telly. Draco felt hot inside and out. Potter considered him a friend? He didn't know that. It felt…good.
“Of course. I’ll get out of your hair.”
“Smith,” Zabini murmured. God, this was too good. He was starting to see why Draco enjoyed it so much.
"Come on, Draco. Let's get out of here."
“You said you were meant to be somewhere hot and foreign, getting sucked off by someone hot and foreign.” He shrugged, and smirked at Draco, letting his eyes wander down his very much bare chest. “I’m here to help with that bit.” Draco truly didn’t know how to respond, and he suspected his mouth was open rather rudely. Potter stepped forward slowly, and hooked his forefinger into the towel around Draco’s hips. “Is this okay?” Draco nodded mutely, and then Potter was kissing him, and everything else dissolved into a chocolate-scented blur of pleasure for several long minutes.
They fell into silence again, not uncomfortable. Draco could feel Potter watching him, and felt warm.
“Creepiest living being in wizarding London,” Draco said, folding the note into his pocket. “Permit’s done. We can go directly to the Ward Room now.” He cranked the lever down to Level 9 instead of 2, and refused to meet Potter’s eyes. His body had felt rather lovely pressed up against Draco’s. It was becoming harder to ignore his attraction to Potter, who definitely had not been helping with his constant innuendo through the morning. Fancying Harry Potter was a bad idea, though
Ginny steepled her fingers and took a deep breath. “Malfoy brought you some dildos. And you tested them out.”
Draco pushed his mulberry silk sleep mask up into his hair and looked around his still-darkened bedroom. There was no Ministry owl waiting with a scroll. No Patronus glowering at him from beside his bed. The phone continued to bleat
They were standing so close that Harry could feel Malfoy’s body heat warm his bare arms.
He knew he had, but it also seemed sort of unbelievable. No wonder Hermione had been so worried about his wellbeing. He was practically a fucking hermit.
? He should have asked Malfoy to bring some lube. He seemed to recall lube had been important, and Harry cursed himself silently for not having sorted his sex life out well before now.
“That seemed to go well,” Malfoy stepped up beside him. “Wouldn’t you say?”
What?
Potter picked up the pace, and Draco threw a hand across the surface of the bench, his palm flat on the table top. Soft towels nudged his fingertips, and he could smell that tantalising mixture of in-wash stain remover and washing powder, a faintly lavender-tinged, soapy aroma, wafting down from the damp, warm towels strung above their heads. Maybe it
He pushed the jeans further down his legs - nice thighs, thick and strong. The hair on his legs glints in the low light. He likes this part of the body too, loved the contrast of hard muscle and softness in Ginny, and the tight pull of expensive fabric in Malfoy’s trousers as he lounged against the brick outside the club. Running a hand up his inner thigh, he enjoys the gentle scratch of the hair, the contrast of muscle under soft skin. He cups his balls, rubs them gently and rolls them in the flat of his palm. He never takes his time like this. Never watches himself like this. Never appreciates himself like Malfoy told him he should.
“Yes, what’s he drinking, Morgan?”
Sleep hadn't been easy the night before - Draco had managed perhaps an hour or so, at best. His stomach was too cramped with misery and humiliation to let him rest, his mind speeding again with better ways he could have said things, other times he could have approached Potter, other ways Potter might have reacted. He was restless, and sick with embarrassment.
“Send the fucking thing before you wimp out.” Adrenaline raced through him, leaving butterflies in his belly and a wild flush blooming up his throat. He tapped the screen, got the photo attached to a message, and at the last moment, added ‘for your collection’ below it.
The upper hand was his again. He could absolutely pull off casual and dismissive now that he had caught Potter sucking on a lukewarm tea bag.
“Malfoy.” Weasley sat down in the chair opposite Draco, at the horrible bar off Diagon, and immediately balked. “This place is dead posh. My god, these chairs are grim. Five seconds in, and my arse is already cramping!”
“Steady on, Potter. I think Roger’s had quite enough, don’t you?”  Harry ceased thrusting, and looked wildly at Malfoy, whose brows once again climbed towards his hairline. “Ok-aaay,” Malfoy said slowly and calmly, letting go of Roger’s buttocks and gently removing the dildo from Harry’s hands. It decoupled from Roger with a slick pop. “Perhaps we could take a quick break, Potter, what do you think?” Malfoy’s voice was quiet and soothing, and he removed his gloves with efficient movements. Harry was feeling a bit hot and faint, and he clumsily mimicked Malfoy’s actions until both gloves were scrunched on the bench.
“Not always,” Harry mumbled, feeling hot in the ears.
. I declare today a Department of Magical Games and Sport holiday, and therefore have dismissed all staff still at the office. No exceptions.” Without dropping Draco’s hand, he used his forefinger to poke Draco in the chest. “That’s you. You’re the last staff member at the office.”
“Couples therapy? Before we’ve even made it down the aisle?” Draco’s voice was light, but Harry knew him better than that. “Do you think that’s a bad omen?”
Ginny exhaled and dropped her chin onto one hand, elbow propped on the table. Her other hand was doing vaguely rude things to the handle of her knife. “Good choice, fantastic backside presentation. What else?”
“Why not both, sweetheart?” He cast silently, and slicked his petting fingers with oil. “Fucking and playing don’t have to be mutually exclusive.”
A waiter's corkscrew, whatever the fuck that was.
“You sound just like Ron did, when we were hunting for Horcruxes.”
Ron forked an unwisely large serve of eggs into his mouth.
"You know that's not true. I didn't jump at the chance to be your warden, watch your suffering. I did it because if you have any chance of getting out of this sooner, it's probably going to have to be because of me. I intend to vouch for you. Your first appeal should be approaching in around a month."
“Did something happen with Malfoy, Harry?” Ron put his cards down carefully on the table, and said, looking pleased, “Six hearts.”
“Calm your tits, Potter,” Malfoy said, with a shrug and a smile. “I’ve had my fair share. I was a spoiled child, don’t forget.”
Harry turned to Ron, as if to say ‘are you hearing this’? “I don’t have a warrant card - I’m not a fucking
“What sort?” Malfoy looked up briefly from his task, frowning slightly.
Potter scratched the back of his neck, sheepish. “I suppose you wouldn't believe it came with the phone.”
Ron rubbed his stomach absently and looked fond for a moment. “That was some top notch crackling.”
But now he was looking. Harry was looking at himself the way Malfoy had made him look at the other people at the club. Harry wasn't a skinny little boy anymore, even though, somehow, until just now, he’d still sort of felt like one. He pressed one hand to his belly. He looked.
Malfoy’s mouth was still twitching slightly. “High praise. I always liked Charms at school, and Potions. I actually have a lab of my own, for work. I always prefer to test out any Muggle products before I stock them, for safety and such. You’d be surprised at the sorts of things that could go wrong when wizarding folk start messing about with Muggle gear - or, maybe you wouldn’t, given all this.” Malfoy waved his hand in the general direction of the cock bush. “I normally get a sample of anything new on the market and then hit them with all the usual charms people might like to use on their sex toys. Cleaning charms can really deteriorate the materials in rubber items, for example, but silicon holds up rather a lot better. So if you were to come into my shop looking for, say, an anal toy.”
Orange Singlet hooked a finger in a belt loop at the front of Harry’s jeans, and tugged him forward, out of Malfoy’s reassuring grip and almost against his neon-clad chest. “Hi. I’m Paul. And you’re gorgeous.”
“Do you need me to send through the preliminary interviews for the Keepers?” Weasley said, holding open the Refectory door for Draco. He shook his head.
“But you like your job. You like sports, remember?”
Weasley grinned, fondly. “Yeah. She’s a bit mental, our Hermione.” He pointed at Draco. “She’s decided you need rescuing, and since she can’t hassle Harry about it directly-”
Ron, equally smug, looked at his cards one last time. “Pass. Kitty’s yours, ‘Mione.”
Malfoy’s voice was, as ever, a confident drawl. “Oh
Grimmauld Place was still Unplottable, but Draco knew the secret. He was allowed past the wards, the Floo unlocked for him and a select few. When he came through around ten minutes behind, he expected Potter to be on him instantly, but the parlour was empty. Draco followed the faint sound of movement downstairs to the basement kitchen, a room he’d rarely been into.
“Why are we all whispering?” Draco didn’t need to, but he half turned anyway and found Potter standing behind them, calmly eating a pumpkin pasty. There were crumbs all the way down the front of his robes. Draco’s fingers twitched.
“What the fuck are you on about,” Draco asked, not sure it was worth wasting his breath over.
“Of course you do,” Harry said fondly, watching the last of the cartons of quidditch kit float through the Floo into Draco’s small suite of rooms at the castle. “Am I getting a list, or do I have to pay attention?”
“Fuck off, Potter.”
The weekend was trickier. Navigating Friday night so that he didn’t spend the weekend pining over Malfoy became a second job. Ron had been surprisingly helpful. He was pretty sure Hermione had spoken to him, and told him (and probably Ginny, too) to give Harry a break on the Malfoy issue. The first Friday night after the infamous shag, marry, kill incident, Harry managed to get Bujalski talking about her potions internship, and he carefully ushered Ron into place so that he wasn’t sitting directly beside or opposite Malfoy. Ron seemed to catch on without needing it explained, and the following week brought a selection of Wheezes sweets from a new range due for release before Christmas, and they spent the evening laughing themselves hoarse while each chew morphed their mouths and noses into a new animal’s features. It was easy not to fixate on the shape of Malfoy’s lips, when Malfoy was trying to drink a pint around a toucan beak.
A second knock, and a soft call of his name.
Harry shrugged. “I’d make toast. I’d get a toaster as similar to the cursed one as I could find, identical if I could manage it, and I’d make some toast in both toasters and see what happened. Compare them. Observe the behaviour of the cursed toaster, how hot the flames were, and how high, and what exactly was happening magically at the moment the flames burst out of the slots. Are the flames intended to harm the user or just frighten them, or was it a misguided attempt at improving the performance of the toaster? And once I had that figured out, I’d take the thing apart and extract the magical signature, and then I’d use that to track the culprit down.”
had he done it? He'd hardly dared to imagine it, doing that, he'd hardly ever let himself go there with his thoughts. But sometimes, he couldn't help it - he found himself poking at that part of his mind like a tongue pokes a damaged tooth. Those feelings had been in there, growing quietly like a cavity, for a long time now. A weakness. Ever since the war, perhaps. Undoubtedly it flourished during his time at Hogwarts as the gamekeeper. He hadn't wanted to acknowledge it, oh no, he hadn't wanted to
They discussed Ron’s present dilemma in earnest as they made their way through the car park to the restroom, where in turn they each flushed themselves all the way to the Atrium at the Ministry Headquarters. By the time the lift doors clattered open at Level Two, Harry had successfully talked Ron out of a subscription to
“Oh, god.”
Draco had been staring into space for an indeterminate length of time, when Potter finally caught his attention.
“I’m not into violence, that’s a nasty rumour.” A little light spanking hardly qualified as
“Thank you, Pierce, send him in.” Draco didn’t bother to look up from his paperwork, even when he heard Mister Ten-Thirty enter the office. “Sit.” He pulled a folio from the pile near his right hand, and flipped it open. “So, you say you have experience, Mister…” Draco looked up, his expression serious. “How is it that you pronounce your name?”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Malfoy said, his voice light and dangerous. Furious, then. Murderous, maybe. They reached their office door, and Malfoy opened it and didn’t bother to wait for Harry to enter first, as he usually would. He went instead directly to his desk, and started shuffling through their files with brutal speed.
“What do you want?” He whispered the words into Potter’s mouth. “You going to ride me?”
“There is more that we need to discuss but I am going to leave it for the meantime. You need a chance to heal and recover. Speaking of it is three days since you were last awake. From what I gather you activated the portkey that the Dark Lord gave you.”
Harry had taken to avoiding all reflective surfaces. He hated the very sight of his freakish shrunken skin and hollow cheeks. He also tried to avoid touching himself as much as possible, he didn’t like the feel of his bones sticking out. It was like even his skeleton found him abhorrent and was doing its best to break out of his skin and flee.
“Yes, I...”
Once Dumbledore sat down Harry shot out of his seat and fled the great Hall running from the stares coming from all three schools. Ron and Hermione found him back in the hospital wing. Sitting on a bed looking out at the sky.
Slightly concerned he had checked with his Mother worried that because he had come into his inheritance early, he had broken something important. Narcissa had sat him done and explained that that wasn’t the case at all. There had been another case documented of an Eros who came early in their teens and that Eros and mate had become parents nine months later.
A desire for Draco to be here sprang up. Draco had always drawn people's attention off Harry and onto himself. Despite how selfish it was, Harry would have loved to have Draco come swooping in and strut himself around until everyone was looking at him and Harry could slink off to the shadows.
“Sirius, this is urgent and absolutely necessary. I wouldn't ask if it wasn’t.”
And yet before him lay the evidence that his pride in his abilities was folly. The level of malnutrition Harry suffered from was not something that could be achieved in a single month. The amount time of which he had been with the muggles. It was systematic abuse years in the making. Which meant for years and quite possible right from the moment he set eyes on Harry he had been showing signs and Severus had let his schoolboy grudges and hatred blind him from the truth. This was another crippling blow for Severus had thought that he was always clear-sighted and saw the truth others hid from. Yet it seemed he was just a fallible as the rest of his colleagues.
“James,” Sirius moaned. Harry beamed internally. Not only was he making Sirius feel good and getting head pats, but he had somehow brought up a wonderful memory of his adoptive father for them to share. A moment later Sirius took a deep breath and woke up. He looked down then blanched
“No! You can’t make me. I’ll die before I go back.”
“Yes,” Sirius confirmed, “Now, let’s start from the beginning, why were you bloody blowing me?”
Harry froze, the one thing Vernon hated more than Harry was homosexuals. If he ever got the idea that Harry was one then the pain that he would melt out would be beyond excruciating. He would do anything to avoid that.
As he slid next to Sirius, he felt something hard poke him in the stomach. Harry froze, not breathing, the sensation of Dudley flashing through him. When nothing else happened, he blew out the air in his lungs and concentrated on the breathing exercised Severus had taught him. Slowly his heart settled, and he thought about it logically. He wanted to do something to make Sirius feel better. Everyone had been assuring him that this act when done between people who love one another was not a disgusting bad thing. That people did it to bring pleasurable feelings to someone they loved. Harry bit his lip and continued to think about this. It would differ from the other times because Harry was choosing to do it. And Sirius wasn’t forcing him. Even if Sirius was forcing/ asking him that was fine because Harry loved Sirius and that made all the difference.
“Your stay there might not be the most comfortable, but it is vital. I have already had this discussion with you before. If it wasn’t so important to the War efforts, then things might have been different. Be that as it may, this is how it has to be.” Dumbledore said firmly.
“Do you want me to stop?” Tom asked.
“Of course Severus, I have no problems with that request. You only need to let me know when and I would be delighted to fulfil your wish.”
Pomona reach out and lay a comforting hand on Minerva. “You were not the only one.”
“Dumbledore has finally sent for me,” Severus said. “I need to go,” handing Tom the brief letter. Tom took it but kept hold of Severus’ hand. He skimmed it, then nodded his head, not stopping Severus from doing what he must.
“Maybe he doesn't want that. Has that thought occurred to you?”
“How do you feel?”
He planned to make precise lucid and comprehensible notes for the conversation about being Harry’s father before bringing it up. In the vague hope that it doesn't turn out such a mishmash disentanglement that his apology ended up as. The only saving grace was Harry was far too weak to move and so couldn’t go running for the hills.
“You're a traumatise young boy, you don’t know what you're saying,” Fudge said.
“Up, out, get out of this house. You're stinking up the whole place. I don’t want to see your freakish face until it's time to cook dinner!” She screeched.
“I’m telling you it is of vital importance that you believe me and do as I ask,”
To the stage that he was waking up the whole house with his unnatural racket. Uncle Vernon in particular was most displeased. And an Uncle Vernon who had not gotten a good night sleep was an Uncle three times as bad as one who had. This fact had surprised Harry who originally thought that he couldn’t get any worse. He now knew there was always worse and to count his blessing that things were not going any further.
“If Severus has hair like mine, why didn’t he notice the similarities.”
Head whirling, Severus sank back onto the bed. He watched with lust-filled eyes as Tom sensually strip for him. Once they were both naked Tom crawled onto the bed and turned Severus until he was lying on his stomach. To prepare for tonight, Severus had already preformed the necessary spells. He was therefore caught unaware when he felt tricking oil pour onto him.
“Daddy, daddy, don’t go,” Harry threw himself into Severus’ arms, wrapping his arms and legs around him and clinging with all his might. Severus finally gave his son the hug he had been dying to give him for months now.
“I can’t get my nails done; it will affect any potions I brew.”
Author comes staggering over, bits of leaves, grass, fluff, feathers and glitter is stuck all over them. their fingers are glued closed and it looks like they have cut chunks out of their hair.
“You don’t brew with your feet, so we can just paint your toenails.”
“I see, then he is still a wilfully blind as always. Tell me, who is abusing you then?”
“Mine” he growled into the base of Severus throat.
He didn’t share. He bared his teeth at the thought of someone else trying to have a part of his Harry and tighten his grip in the wavy hair. Harry arched up into the hold wordless begging for more. Draco relaxed his grip and let out a pleased hum as he went back to his stroking. Harry was looking up at him trustingly and that helped settle Draco. He had been told by every single one of the people that he dated that he was too clingy and possessive. No one had wanted that much of Draco's attention until Harry. His sweet Harry who looked so shyly pleased every time that Draco acknowledge him it made Draco resolute to shower Harry with all the attention he craved. His Harry was perfect. It was like Merlin made him just for Draco. They fit together so well.
It was only now that Harry realised the touch hadn’t hurt him at all. He stared at Voldemort perplexed. What was going on here? Wormtail let out a particularly loud sniffle and Voldemort stunned him without looking away from Harry.
“Of cause, that is as you said up to you.”
Mr Malfoy looked up startled then followed where Harry was pointing to his wrist.
Severus watched Tom warily.
“Mate, is that? Did you piss yourself?” Ron asked horrified looking at the growing wet patch in Harry’s bed.
Harry stared at him, astonished. How on earth did he guess that? Sirius laughed at the stupefied look on Harry's face, then started to pull his shirt off. He paused halfway with his arms stuck in the air and his face half-covered.
Tom chuckled lowly, placing a kiss on Severus’ back. “Obviously no one has told you about the joys of taking your time and doing a thorough job.”
“What for?” Harry asked astonished.
“Your incredibly skinny for someone who is not abused.”
“No!” Harry shouted arm outstretched scared Sirius was feeling so revolted by Harry touching him he was going to mutilate his own body. Instead, ice-cold water sprayed all over Sirius groin and he let out a breathless yell collapsing back on the bed, knees drawn up as he clutched himself. There was no sound besides from their breathing for a minute while Harry stared at his godfather wide-eyed. Sirius slowly uncurled and cast a drying charm before sitting up to look at Harry.
“These are what I was talking about,” Sirius said, twisting his arm to tap against two scars. One on either shoulder blade. Harry reached up and gently traced them. They were plucked and raised, but faded white with age. Whatever happened, it was a long time since then.
Tom smiled pleased and stood up, walking over to Severus. He tilted his chin, then softly kissed him.
“Really?”
Tom looked up waiting politely.
Severus nodded his head and turned to leave.
Author never though the childish game of hide and seek would give them such valuable life skills, nor that the army camo clothes they had in the wardrobe from their teenage rebel phase would come in handy.
“I WILL KILL YOU FOR THIS.”
Author crosses finger that hopefully this means they can stop running for their lives from the pack of rabid readers they somehow have collected.
“What happened?”
“It's my notes for the upcoming conversation.”
Tom held the square covered board along with the required white and black circle stones as he entered one of the smaller sunrooms. He had asked via house elf if Mr Potter was amiable to receiving his company and had been oddly surprised when the answer had come back positive. He had found himself unusually attached to young Harry. He as of yet had no explanation why it was that he had wasted countless hours worrying about the child's well been. Or why he had made sure that Severus and Narcissa had everything they required to attend to Harry’s needs. So far, he had kept away from being physically present knowing that he was a symbol of all the suffering Harry had gone through. But he was hoping that if they had small controlled interactions that Tom would have the chance to slowly change Harry’s perspective on him.
Severus walked along the moor, his eyes searching for another clue as his heart slowly continued to break. Dumbledore had given him the heads up, there was an incidence at the Dursley residence. Severus arrived quick enough that he examined what was left of the house before the Auror’s arrived and warded the site. Severus saw Aurors making the sign to ward off evil when they thought no one was looking. There was no way to mistake the destruction as anything else than the work of an Obscurus.
Then there was the whole Potters thing to deal with. The fact his mum had hurt Snape was weighing on his mind, he wanted to fill guilty about, no he did feel guilty about it. But his talk with Voldemort was echoing loudly in his head and combatting the guilt. Could there be the chance he didn’t have to feel guilty about it? It's not like he had any say or control over what his mum did before he was even born, right?
He stretched out on his bed and closed his eyes, not in the mood to do anything more than doze for a while. His eyes snapped open when he heard his door being unlocked. His trepidation didn’t disappear when his cousin entered, followed by his best friend.
Piers came with a groan and fell back, collapsing on Harry’s bed. He made no move to cover himself up, pants still down around his ankles, instead closed his eyes with a blissful smile. Harry spat everything in his mouth onto the floor. “I don’t consent, I don’t consent” He babbled looking up at Dudley.
Harry reached up and gently tapped against the golden torc around his neck. A habit he had gotten into whenever he was slightly unsure. Draco had given him it on their three-month anniversary. It was just as finely engraved as Lucius wrist bands. Once Draco had placed it around his neck, he had spoken a single word of power that had sent out invisible shock waves. The magic had closed the torc so people could never remove it. Harry had asked what language the word came from, as it was not one that he had ever heard of before. Draco had replied that it was Enochian, a language native to winged humans. Seeing Harry's fascination with the language Draco had from then on said a couple of words to him every day.
“None the less, I wish to offer my sincere apologies.”
Severus entered the Blue sunroom only to be greeted with his son running up to him.
Tom led Severus over to the chairs and got him to sit down. He then sat across from him and raising his wand gave Severus the curtsy of speaking the spell out loud.
“Yes, yes, yours!”
“Can I ask you about being a mate?”
Fudge drew himself up.
“Be a peace,” Severus said.
“Harry doesn’t normally spend Christmas holidays there. And it’s a week before school goes back why now?” Ron asked.
The frustrating child continued to be mute.
Severus ducked his head, not sure what was the right response. Was Tom just saying that to be nice? And yet his instincts were telling him Tom may have regained his sanity, but he did not turn into a goody-two-shoes. If he was asking then it was because he wanted it.
“There is no way,” Piers said.
“Yes sir, sorry sir,” Harry whispered letting go of the Headmaster sleeve.
“It’s a bit boring but ok.”
Hermione nodded and got up and left.
Drumming his fingers on the table, Tom watched the old man continuing to breathe. After two hours he came to the bitter conclusion that the dam stupid fool was going to live through this. If the curse had not killed him by now, then it wasn’t going to. Someone else must have come to the same conclusion because shortly after the air became cold and icy crept up everyone’s glasses freezing their drinks. The crowd drew back from the door. It wasn’t too much longer before the Dementor that the frost was heralding floated through it. The Dementor paid no attention to anyone else, even with the whimpers and quiet cries that broke out. Instead, it headed straight for the broken mess of the floor that was Dumbledore. Tom was in a prime position to whiteness the Dementor’s Kiss. It was both as horrifying and painful for the subject as the legends had stated.
Severus slowly meandered through the heather. It has been weeks of him coming here every day to check on Harry. He kept the sight of Draco’s tent in the corner of his eye. Harry had loved it and moved in as soon as Severus finished setting it up and backing far enough away.
“Right, well...” Severus floundered. He did not have a plan in place for this and had no idea what to do. “When you do have questions, you are welcome to come and ask me.” he tried he was at a loss what to do now. Personally, he would love to flee and go brew for a couple of hours but even his antisocial head knew that running away after dropping an emotional bombshell was not done. Casting his eye around he looked for inspiration. Nothing seemed to leap out at him so he fell back on his own childhood and one of the only bright points.
Severus nodded it would do for the moment. He had a lot of work to build up trust before Harry would be completely honest with him. Severus knew he had to start out on the right foot, which meant no more stalling.
“Now, my Lord. I can’t wait any longer.”
“Yes, his aunt was most concerned.”
“I’m not abused,” came automatically out of Harry mouth but Severus ignored it for the moment. He knew most abused kids protested it out of habit.
There was an answering squeak and something invisible disappeared. Draco looked back at his book. He knew from trial and error that unless Harry dragged him with him, then he didn’t want to be hovered over. Draco was willing to listen to his mate and thankfully they had compromised on this issue. If Harry wasn’t in Draco’s sight then he would have a house-elf with him. To help him if he needed it and make sure he didn’t hurt himself. Neither had really like the end results, Harry didn’t want someone with him when he wanted to be alone, and Draco didn’t want Harry to be out of his view. But they had both thought this was a fair to each other.
“I will do my best not to disturb him but it is vitally important that I talk to him.” he looked down at Harry who had tightened his grip of Padfoot almost strangling him.
Dumbledore gave him a look of annoyance.
“Oh Harry, I’m so glad we found you.”
“Now, Minerva, don’t be too hard on the Lad,” Filius interrupted. “There is a reason Severus is not under suspicion like the three of us.”
“.... Talk to him, need to know exactly what happened......”
Tom heard a knock on his office door.
“Who is looking after the school?” Severus asked.
She sighed sadly but accepted his reasoning.
Harry had once explained this theory to Blaise, who had been whining about how long Draco was taking to get ready. Harry wasn’t sure he had explained it properly because Blaise had gotten a funny look on his face and said blankly. “Right, of course,” He had turned away but Harry had still heard the sour mutter, “Fucking made for one another.” Still, he had never bothered complaining about the time Draco took again, so Harry counted it as a win.
Maybe he should just take it day by day and see how it goes. After all, he could still back out. Snape no Severus if he was doing this then he would call him by his first name. Severus had not made him promise anything. In fact, Severus had not made him do anything about it at all, he had just given the information the Harry then left the ball in his court. It was now up to Harry if they went any further with this.
Suddenly he was engulfed in a soft cloak that covered him completely. Hood drawn up so he no longer had to see all those eyes staring at him.
Harry found himself studying Mr Malfoy who looked different than every other time Harry had seen him. He wondered if it was the fact that he was in private now instead of public or if the fact Harry was mated to his son that changed him. Because he didn’t have the sneering face or ugly look that Harry was so used to. Harry studied his unhurried movements and facial expression and the word peaceful seemed to best suit his look. Peaceful looked kind of nice on him.
Harry took a deep breath holding it for a long moment then let it out and began to talk. He stumbled and stammered at certain parts but managed to get through the retelling.
“Thank you, my Lord.” Severus breathed, his emotions threatening to overwhelm him. All the panic and worry for Harry combined with his budding feeling for Tom that he had valiantly been trying to suppress and they burst through his occlumency shield, flooding his system. Which made him do something completely out of the ordinary. He shot forward and mashed their lips together in an unexpected kiss. Tom had frozen, not moving and Severus drew back mortified.
“The point being, Pup all I was fucking using to think with was my bollock and my cock. So, when some pouncey fluffy wings sprouted out of my back, I wanted them fucking gone quick smart. How the hell was I going to get laid if I had chicken wings growing out of my bloody body? Then there was the fact that my dear bitch of a mother kept raving on about wings being a sign of purest blood or some shite. So, I got my best mate to cut them out for me.”
“I will take that under consideration,” Dumbledore said to her before turning to Harry. “Lucius Malfoy claims he kept you to himself. That his wife and son did not know of your imprisonment there. Is that true, Harry?”
“Like having to let her boss you around, and do whatever she says? Does it ever annoy you that you don’t get a say?”
“I didn’t know Wizard got tattoos.”
“You don’t look like James Potter.”
“It's an abstract strategy game that was invented in China over 2500 years ago. The aim is to surround more territory than your opponent.”
“Ouch” Blaise looked around then turned pale. “Fuck!” He cursed and stumbled backwards away from Draco.
The exclamations came from everyone still in the hallway. Dumbledore poked his head out of the kitchen.
“Right, pretend that any sexual act is like drinking a glass of firewhiskey.”
“cause your family and family don’t...” He squirmed then went with the analogy they had been using “don’t drink firewhiskey together?”
Author looks around themselves bewildered. This was it. They were done. They rock back and forward on the feet swinging their arms aimlessly. They are not sure what to do now.  They get a crooked little grin as they realise despite all their tricks and hiding and misdirection, they will miss having such a loyal bunch of readers following their every move.
Harry backed away from them, shaking his head.
Mortified, Harry prayed for it to end soon. He knew his body was beyond abhorrent, so why the hell was so many people still staring at it. Surely all they need was one look to see how disgusting it was. And yet everyone was still examining him.
“The other day Mother was painting her nails with tiny little bottles of different coloured paints. Is that something only girls do?”
“No, no apologies,” Sirius said firmly “Not until you explain what the bloody hell going through your head. Why did you think that was an ok thing to do?”
Dumbledore raised his hands, and order quickly returned to the kitchen. He then turned to Harry; his eyes did not even have the hint of a twinkle.
He had to be so careful with Harry. He had been horrified when his mother told him that Harry couldn’t afford to miss a single meal. He had thought he was doing the right thing by giving his mate what he wanted when he had allowed Harry to say no to the extra bowls.
Harry looked a little nervous at this and Severus continued
Tom looked at him then he joined Severus on the day bed stretching out and slotting Severus alongside him. He cupped Severus face and placed tender kisses on his eyelids, then cheekbone, then the corner of his jaw, then coming back up to his chin before finally his lips. In what was becoming his trademark move, Tom slowly and thoroughly kissed him. Dominating and claiming every tiny bit. When he slowly drew back Severus was completely boneless in his arms.
“What’s the meaning of this?” Dumbledore asked standing up from the chair beside Harry’s bed.
“Have no fear. Draco will not do anything of the sort. Part of his creature inheritance is a powerful compulsion to give Harry what he desires. And as his empathy opens, he will feel what Harry feels. It will not occur to Draco to even offer until Harry is ready for it. And if Harry never desires sex, it won’t make one ounce of a difference to Draco. Once we find our mate, they are perfect for us no matter what their desires are.”
“Which in the case of my son and yourself, would mean that you would protect him from all harm and he would deal with all the issues and hassle of being the Boy-Who-Lived.”
The eldest of the lot ranted and raved, muttering about boogie men hiding in the shadow, ready to stab people and constant vigilance. They sentenced him to a lifetime sentence. The second one was wiser and besides from admitting to all wrongdoing and offering his apology said nothing else. Shackbolt was his name. He was stripped of his rank and shield and sentenced to fifteen years with a review possible in ten. The youngest was still a trainee and since she had been following both her trainer and a senior Aurors lead. Combined with the fact she had not been present for most of the atrocities meant the court was lenient with her. She would have to start her complete training from the beginning again after she completed her two years of house arrest.
Tom spent the next half an hour leisurely sipping from his drink and watching Dumbledore. He was not the only one. Most of the pub was watching, interested. Some enterprising soul had a book-running with people placing bets on how long he would survive.
“Sirius!!” Harry half laughed, half groaned.
“What? But that can’t be true, every like literary everyone tells me I do.”
“There is, and I’ll prove it. I’ll let you go first even,” Dudley bragged back. Harry got a sinking feeling that this was going to be worse than normal. Dudley turned to him and demanded. “You’re going to suck our cocks, Potter.”
“I told you before Severus I would prefer if you called me Tom.”
“Why did you say anything?”
Harry just nodded at him, wide-eyed and paled faced.
“Then where did I get this?”
“Your mother came to me one night out of the blue and informed me that her husband was stricken with the common Pureblood curse that left males sterile. She was desperate for a child, and didn’t want to bring any shame upon her marriage.” Severus paused and looked away trying desperately to not think about that night. He made sure his occlumency shield were firmly in place before attempting to continue. “Long story short she asked me to help her out and she was pregnant with you by the time she left.”
“Really?” Harry asked.
Harry slumped back not expecting an adult to calming agree with his outburst. it took all the wind out of his sails
He tried to get a couple hours of sleep during the day while Vernon was at work. All he managed was a light drifting. He hoped it would be enough that he wouldn’t fall asleep tonight. By the time the house settled down to sleep Harry had a plan. He stood by his window dressed in his boxes and singlet watching the night sky. He couldn’t fall asleep if he wasn’t horizontal. As the night slowly progressed Harry became wearier and wearier. His eyes kept sliding closed until he couldn't open them anymore. His head dropped then jerked back up before dropping again. Finally, Harry lent it against the window and lethargy crept up and took him over.
“hmm, to sweeten the pot I give you my servant. Do with him as you will.”
“These are trying times that we are living through,” Dumbledore continued pulling some attention back to him but not all. “We must remember to stay strong in the face of adversity. To strengthen the bonds of friendship we have made here. For if we stand together the Dark will never be able to drive us apart.” Dumbledore raised his goblet.
“Yes, I am,” Tom replied warmly.
“Are you a faggot?” Dudley asked
Still, he needed to get more supplies and food to lure Harry in with. He also needed to keep Tom, Narcissa and Draco updated with the good news. He reappeared in the courtyard of the safe house Tom organised for them to stay in while the ministry attempted to raid Malfoy manor using Lucius incarceration as an excuse. The furthest they would get would be the Manor grounds. Narcissa locked the house down tight once the Order had dragged away Lucius and Harry. They planned to keep out of view after all the ministry couldn’t grab either of them and force them to comply and open up the manor if they were not available.
Perhaps he has not realised Severus though, it is my duty to inform my Lord that he is free to desist.
Harry’s skin broke out in goosebumps and he renewed his struggle.  Wormtail cringing and sobbing shakily rose to his feet and withdrew a black robe from his pocket. He clumsily draped it over the figure who shrugged off his help and he collapsed once more cradling his stump to his chest.
“Ah, so your conversation with Harry didn’t go according to plan?”
“Easy Harry it's just us,” Came Hermione's voice.
Aunty Petunia opened his door and sniffed at him.
“Oh, trust me, Severus, I want to.” Tom put his fingers under Severus’ chin and lifted his head. Then he lent in and slowly brushed their lips together. It was nothing like the awaked squish Severus had performed. Tom moved slowly, cradling Severus head in his hands. His whole demeanour radiated power, dominance and smugness. Severus had no idea what to do, but Tom did. He easily took the lead and slowly, like he was in no hurry to get anywhere, took possession of every millimetre of Severus’ lips. By the time they drew apart, Severus was gasping for breath and Tom’s eyes had darkened considerably.
“You will, or I'll tell Dad I saw you taking it up the ass. That I saw you with some pervert old men.”
“The only features you have in common are as follows. You are both male, both have black hair, both wear glasses. If that was all that was need in order to call someone your father, then congratulations Harry, you now have hundreds if not thousands of Fathers in Britain alone.”
“This idiot decided to bring a dementor with him when he went to go see our prisoners. And in a move that shocks absolutely no one, the dementor decided to feast dealing out two kisses.” Snape sneered.
“Indeed. As it has been in the case where the future happiness and strength of the relationship depends on what I have to say. It was a complete debacle. My impuissance to be able to convey my thoughts has ever been my Achilles heel.”
“A token for you. If you rip it, it will bring you to me no matter where you are and then we can have that talk.” He gently put it into Harrys trouser pocket.
“Harry, I'm afraid we have run out of time to indulge childish whims. You are old enough now to understand that every second counts. Would you have us lose precious time because you want an adult to hold your hand treating you like you are afraid to sleep?” Dumbledore asked solemnly.
“Let’s go inside,” Draco suggested quietly “and I can warm you up with a nice hot drink. Then we can look at all the different colours available and you can choose which one you would like me to paint your nails in.”
“Yeah?”
“Yes, as...”
“More?” Tom rumbled.
“No, that’s not true, I don’t know what that man was doing. I was going through the budget when the Aurors escorted me out. And there is enough to hire a least two teachers per subject and get a couple more elective classes running again.”
Harry stood up and tried his hardest to ignore the torn feeling inside like he was soiled like something precious had been taken from him. He crept upstairs and slid under his bed so he remained out of sight not bothered by the trapped heat anymore. He felt extremely fragile right now. And he couldn’t understand why it hadn’t lasted that long and he didn’t have any permanent marks from the encounter. And yet he was shaking just as bad as he did after a long session with Vernon’s anger. Unable to understand his feelings or his reactions Harry buried his head in his arms and wept silently. He didn’t move from his spot until he heard Petunia getting the pots and pans out for dinner. Then he pulled himself out from under his bed and went to the kitchen to start cooking.
“They must be freezing, here let me help,” Draco summoned a hand towel and the slippers Blaise had given him one Christmas. Harry made a questioning hum as Draco knelt, ignoring that his pyjama pants became instantly soaked with icy water at the knees. Moving slowly and telegraphing what he was planning, Draco lifted one foot. Harry’s arms shot out and held onto Draco’s shoulders for balance. Draco thoroughly dried the foot, then slid it into the slipper. It was a white fluffy monstrosity that rose past the ankles. Draco had never worn them as Blaise had given them to him as a prank, but they were super warm and soft. Perfect for Harry. He repeated the process with the other foot, then stood up. He received uncertain looks from both Harry and Sirius, but promisingly in Draco’s eyes was the wisps slowly fading away.
“I’m a bit cold, I think I might get out dressing gowns,” Draco summoned his, but for Harry, he summoned Severus old gown that Harry had worn while he was still wondering the moors in his madness. Draco wrapped Harry up and could feel his body relaxing as the beloved piece of clothing brought more sanity to his eyes.
Author would under different circumstances be very impressed with the readers creative skills, they had seen a bookmark being re shaped into a pitchfork. And the torches were lit with angry flaming comments.  But since such skill was being put in place to hunt the Author down, they would much prefer that their readers were a bunch of dumb rocks instead.
“Have hope, Harry had a habit of overcoming inconceivable odds after all.”
Severus inclined his head. “The court was kind enough to decide that since I had been Dumbledore’s unwilling pawn for sixteen years that I had suffered enough.”
While Narcissa got to work weaving Voldemort prepared a quick ritual to see how close they could tie Severus with Harry. They already had the fact they were both human, male, and British. But those were terribly weak ties, even the fact Severus was his teacher wasn’t that much of an improvement. What they were hoping for was the fact their family trees met up somewhere in the past. If Severus turned out to be Harry cousin so many times removed that would be perfect. All of Britain wizarding families were so interbred that the chances were quite high. The closer they were related the stronger Severus would be able to sing the healing the better it would be for Harry.
“WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?”
Tom paused and disappointment settled heavy in Severus stomach as Tom removed the comb from his hair. Fingers under his chin made him rase his face, so he was looking at Tom.
“Can’t, Mother needs me to return to the villa. Something about her husband feeling poorly.”
“Don’t be tiresome Severus, you know as well as I that in an ideal world all the children would be safe and healthy. But we don’t live in an ideal world. We have to make the best with what we can. Come now, it’s your analytical mind I need. What’s better for the whole takes precedence over what’s best for the individual.”
“What joys? Oh!” Severus shivered as he felt Tom’s finger slide against him. Tom then showed Severus just what he meant by both joy and taking your time. He coaxed and pulled groans and whimpers from Severus’ throat until Severus was making tons of noises he had never made before. His entire body taut with delicious tension. The noises shot up a pitch when Tom added his tongue into the mix until Severus was so lost in his head all his focus drawn to where Tom was touching him. His body rocking back onto Tom’s fingers and tongue as he subconsciously asked for more.
Hands shaking Harry did so.
Draco gave his head an extra scratch in reassurance, cooing something in Enochian, then led him to the dining room.
But by halfway through his bowl Harry brain which had gotten louder and louder with every spoon was now screaming at him. Dropping the spoon Harry shuddered and turned away from the sight of the food. It didn’t matter how much he wanted to please Draco he couldn’t force himself to pick up the spoon again.
Harry didn’t look convinced; Hell, Blaise wasn’t convinced, and he had been buddies with Draco since First year. The smug tosser could make more of an effort to convince the hero of the light before Blaise found himself splattered all over this courtyard.
“What are they?”
Harry swayed, looking around searchingly. When he caught sight of Severus, he began a drunken stumbling run towards him. Severus at once shot forward to meet him. Harry halted an arm’s length away at looking at Severus desperately. Severus could see a change in Harry’s eyes. They looked clearer than they had.
“Go on then, get my dick out.”
“It’s very Gryffindor,” Severus wasn’t sure what else was safe to say about the rainbow nail polish. But it was enough. Harry grinned, pleased.
“You are not what I expected.”
“Are you sure there is nothing I can do that will convince you to come back?” She asked kindly. Severus shook his head firmly.
Sirius grinned at him and drawled. “Some went and got themselves their own winged cupid.”
“Dumbledore won’t let me see him. Every excuse I come up with he has a corresponding rebuttal for.” He pulled his hair, frustrated. “I can’t push for more because I never want Dumbledore to get his hands on the information about Harry’s true parenthood. He would instantly twist and use it for the greater good. And I will not have Harry chained to slavery the way he has me. I know it’s not logical but I feel like I’m being torn apart, the thought of my child in their clutches and out of my reach is highly distressing. I’m finding it increasingly difficult to live with this decision. Fatherhood has made me lose what tiny grasp and pride I had on my self-control. Any yet I cannot shake the feeling he is in danger and I am not on hand to help him.”
Degradation for his appearance once again make its presence known overriding his fear. Bitterly he spat out the truth.
Severus bit his lip in frustration. This was why he never wanted to be a teacher, or work with children. His people skill was dismal. He had never managed to convey with any decorum what was on his mind. It somehow became terrible muddled between his brain and his mouth. Ask him about potions and he could give a lecture on the subject for hours on end. But ask him to talk about anything else and his elegance and wit left him. There was a very good reason why he came across as a grumpy abrasive personality. It didn’t encourage people to hang around and talk with him.
“And you’re my idiot.” Draco cooed. Harry made some grumbling noises, but Blaise noticed didn’t object past that.
Blaise diverted his eyes once again as Draco fed Harry from the small bowl that came out for him every two hours. Blaise was pleased to see someone was finally doing something about Harry stick figure impersonation, but he couldn’t watch Draco feed him. It was weird because Blaise could sit through a full-on orgy and not be discomforted, yet this act felt so intimate between the two of them that Blaise had never felt more like a third wheel intruding then now. He would prefer it if the two of them were doing sexual acts instead. But there had not been even a hint of it the entire time he was here
“The board of Governors are there, and a contingent of Aurors. They politely asked the three of us to vacate the premises while they check to see if we had any hand in Albus treachery.” Pomona said.
“How?” Harry asked incredulously
“Would the word slave suit you better, madam?” Severus replied coldly. Minerva looked like she was going to continue arguing before she took a deep breath and looked away.
“NO, I won’t.” Harry snapped squirming even though he knew it was pointless. Once Dudley got a hold of you there was no escaping until he let go.
“Don’t worry, he will be back to his normal amount of snark once he has had a cup of tea,” Draco reassured him.
Harry figured he was in the hospital wing it smelt like it and he was pretty sure he recognised Madam Pomfrey voice. It was enough to assure him that he was safe for the moment and he fell asleep.
“You can choose as many colours as you want.”
“Forgive me, Severus, I am still coming to terms with the fact the man I thought I knew never existed.”
Severus recognised the look Tom was giving him as he cradled Severus’ head between his hands. Their body’s rocking together. It was love. Here was the proof that this relationship meant just as much to Tom as it did Severus.
And now somehow, he had a kid, a son who had been abused that he had to look after without hopefully adding more trauma to his shoulders. He lent back in his chair and pinched the bridge of his nose. He was doing a terrible job of reassuring the boy. It seemed his bedside manners were just as bad if you were family then if you weren’t.
Harry was confused, why couldn’t they talk now? He physically couldn’t go anywhere and the chances of someone finding out where they are were pretty slim at the moment.
“.... Left to long! The shock had him with one foot in the grave...... luck I managed to bring him back”
“You are. You are a little fairy faggot and I think you should make up for all the sleep I've lost because of you.”
“Eat up Harry, you have got to keep your strength up.”
“No, no. I won’t.”
Harry bit his tongue so he wouldn’t complain, but he could do nothing to stop the whining that was coming from his throat. Dumbledore had a bruising grip around his upper arm and was marching him towards the fireplace. Harry tried his hardest to be strong and brave and not cause more hassle than he was. But he couldn’t stop himself from turning his head back and making eye contact with Sirius. His whine rising in pitch. The last thing he saw was Sirius breaking out of the Order’s restraining hands and leaping towards him before green fire swallowed everything from sight.
“What’s that?” Harry asked interrupting.
“I would love to have sex with you.” Tom replied.
“Am I safe?”
“Were you friends?”
He held up his hand as they drowned him in different explanations.
“Sleep Severus, take a couple of hours to recharge. You will be no good to Harry if you are exhausted.”
“...Needed the information he could give me.”
Severus pushed out of the memory and leaned over the chair, throwing his guts up. His whole body broke out in shivers. Once he finished heaving, he collapsed back in the chair and closed his eyes concentrating on just breathing. Slowly his sense expanded and he realised the smell of the vomit was gone, someone must have banished the mess he made. He also had a cool cloth on the back of his neck and his hair was pulled back away from his face. Something was slowly stroking through it and the repetitive motions help settle him. Blinking open his eyes he was met with the sight of the Dark Lord calmly combing his hair. Seeing that Severus was aware once more Tom tied his hair back into a low tail then walked back to his seat.
Harry shook his head.
“Good. That’s what I’ll do then.”
As soon as Severus entered the room, Dumbledore turned to him and said gravely, “I’m afraid I have some shocking news. Harry Potter has gone missing.”
“Sirius, I need you to get in contact with our informants overseas.”
“Yes, I'm trying...”
Harry listen to the pair of footsteps fade away but didn’t bother moving from his spot. He was surprised to hear Snape didn’t think their talk went well. From Harry’s point of view, it was fine, well as fine as these awkward talks could go. Snape neither dithered around not saying anything nor did he try and baby thing or make them too complicated.
“I found out that James Potter like a lot of the male Pure-bloods was sterile and unable to sire any child. It's unclear whether Mr Potter ever knew of this information but his wife certainly did. Around the same time as this medical test was being run, Lily Potter purchased both a fertility potion and a love draught. After that, the trail runs cold. I’m afraid the next place to check for clues will be within your mind.” Tom informed Severus who had become expressionless as he went on. Hinting at the depth of emotions he must be burring under his Occlumency.
“There is no clasp? How do you take them off?”
Harry was touched that Sirius was asking, but the ridicules pose he was stuck in helped Harry answer with complete truthfulness and actual light-heartedness.
Lucius gracefully sunk to his knees. She untied the ribbon that was keeping his hair in place, then fanned the golden white locks across her lap, the ends spilling over the edge. She pulled out a brush and starting at the end of his hair began to brush it gently, working out any tangles. Her wings elegantly unfolded and spread open, stretching up as high as they could go. Providing a spectacular background.
“I don’t know about that you seem to do alright with me.”
“We then did not have contact with one another for another four years.”
“Does it ever bother you? Having to be her Mate?”
Fudge looked down his nose at Harry
When Harry had told Sirius, he had bound him over as the Grimm wiggled with joy at the prospects of being able to hang out in extensive grounds of his childhood play area. Every time Harry stepped outside the castle, Sirius would be there to accompany him.
He hummed as both the Eros petted and cosseted him. Vaguely he made plans to spend some time outside today. Sirius would only appear when Harry was outdoors. Tom had looked at him when they first came to the safe house and said that Sirius wasn’t an Animagus anymore but a mix of the Obscurus magic and Grimm that housed the soul of Harry’s godfather. It shouldn’t be possible, but Sirius shouldn’t have survived being consumed by an Obscurus. Harry didn’t care what was possible or not he was just glad that Sirius was a part of his life. Part of his life or not, Sirius could no longer stand the thought of being caged. Even in such a big place as this safe house. Sirius could no longer have four walls surrounding him. The only way he would enter a dwelling would be if Harry was in danger. Deadly danger, because if Sirius came in then he would kill everything in sight.
“Yes, really,” Severus answered slightly peeved.
Harry rolled to his side struggling to breathe. He could feel his lungs expanded but they were not able to draw any air in through the blood. Panicking Harry could see black spots dancing before his eyes before he managed to draw back his lips and suck in a tiny amount of air through his clenched teeth. Keeping himself as still as possible Harry put all his focus into inhaling and exhaling through the tiny gaps.
“Yes, Harry, it doesn’t fucking matter who is asking you are too young to drink.”
“I promise a hug from you always makes me feel so much fucking better, no matter what is going on. So how bout it?” Sirius asked opened his arms “Can I have one?”
Harry watched as Draco walked quietly over to him in order to not disturb Snape. Harry’s eyes were drawn to play of morning light over Draco’s bare chest. He didn’t know why the sight was so fascinating to him. Draco had been walking around bare-chested for days to let his wings grow properly. And yet despite having seen it before Harry couldn’t stop looking. Thankfully Draco tolerated Harry gaze on him. He hadn’t mocked Harry for looking and had even once been extremely nice and let Harry examine him from all angles one day. Harry was pretty sure it was only the fact he was Draco’s mate that he had let Harry touch him. Harry knew it was weird and not cool but he had been dying of curiosity to see what real muscles felt like. With all this looking that Harry was doing, he had noticed that Draco was changing a bit every day. His shoulders were becoming broader and he was packing on muscles. Especially in the shoulder and back area. But his arms were getting extra as well. Harry observed that it was linked with how much his wings had grown that night. Wing which still were patchily covered in white fluffy down but were already the length from Draco’s shoulders to his knees. And they were still growing. The wings were going to be huge by the time they were done.
Uneasily Harry stepped onto a chair then stood on the top of the kitchen table. He always hated being the centre of attention. The crushing weight of their gazes as he was scrutinised from every angle filled his body with uncomfortable pressure. Even after years of fame, he had not adjusted to the attention piled on him.
“Draco!”
Longbottom had an odd expression on his face. “He wanted to come across immediately. Said it was the most beautiful thing he’d seen.”
"Cock - I want cock!"
“You sure there’s nobody special?”
Her eyes widened. “You’re going to talk to him?” Of course not. Draco is a coward of the highest order, always had been. There’d be no talking to Potter, telling him that this thing they’d been doing together was done, thanks for your time and all the very best. It’s not that he thought Potter would be attached, or hurt - quite the opposite. Potter would probably laugh at him. He’d probably just rotate another blond into the routine, and barely register the difference.
Harry sat up properly and Conjured himself a Muggle whiteboard and erasable pens. Waving his wand over the report, he copied the spell diagram and transposed it onto the whiteboard, and began to scrawl and mutter to himself. “Gemino curse, incantation
A box to store cufflinks, Crocodile leather. Unused.
Draco groaned. “Don’t remind me, I’m still upset over it. This is not in that league, thankfully. I think I’m just more morose than usual because of this fucking relentless music.” He pointed his wand at a stack of papers near the corner of Potter’s desk, and they shivered briefly before re-arranging themselves in the correct, neat order. He felt slightly better. “Anyway, I’m just running the numbers for the St. Eligius Cup next May. You remember that Abraxans only drink single malt whiskey? Well, I need to have the proposal done in time for the January budget meeting, but there was an explosion last week at the Penderyn distillery, which is the only single malt manufacturer authorised to officially supply winged horse races in Britain, and now the price per barrel of whiskey has gone up by two hundred percent. If we go ahead with the Cup under these conditions, we either won’t be able to afford any meat to feed the Thestral’s, or we’ll have to divert funds from something else and I can honestly see the Summer Swim program getting the cut.”
Harry listened to Malfoy’s voice and tried to focus. He remembered how the men in the club had reacted to him. Men who didn’t know a thing about him - they weren’t reacting to the Boy Who Lived. They didnt give a fuck about the mark on his forehead - probably just thought it was the product of a wild night out with the lads in his youth, a few stitches and a funny story to re-tell on pub night. He looked at himself again. He liked his hair, sort of. He liked the colour, anyway, and that it made him look like his dad. His dad was handsome and confident and full of cheek, everything Harry didn’t feel. He’d like to be more like his dad, to channel that confidence, the magnetic quality that he and Sirius had seemed to have in spades.
He was going to have to cancel all of it, each item on his carefully constructed and much looked forward to itinerary being crossed out instead of ticked.
Draco just looked at him.
“When you what, Potter?”
“Are you sure you want to use your last veto on this?”
Potter blinked at him, and put the glasses down on the coffee table on top of a newspaper. “An iPhone. They’re new. You still don’t have a mobile, do you?”
“Yeah, alright.”
Draco pressed his lips to the shell of Potter’s ear, and whispered. “Fresh laundry. There’s something about the smell, the bleach, the washing powder.” Draco made a low noise, and pressed Potter back until they collided with a high bench stacked with folded towels. “Fabric softener. Makes me hard.”
Harry almost said.
-” Now he pinched his fingertips gently and prised a jagged red thread away from the rest. “That looks a lot like a Warming charm to me.”
“Mmm,” Harry grins at Teddy, who currently has blond hair and green eyes. Malfoy hasn’t noticed. It switches to black and grey, and Harry blows out a breath and tries not to notice the way his guts tumble around like a washing machine when he thinks about what babies with Malfoy would look like. “It’s early days, actually, but we had a promising snog last Thursday and with any luck, he might let me do it again sometime soon.”
“You really are a wanker.”
Harry sighed heavily. “This is the worst brunch of my life.”
“I could lift your heavy backside onto my cock, I reckon.”
He'd betrayed himself. Why had he kissed Potter,
“Impossible,” Hermione said, and scooped a huge portion onto Ron’s plate, half burying his chips. “You have a cast iron stomach and an appetite that frightens me at times.”
“Fucks sake,” Malfoy muttered, putting his drink down, and rummaging in his trouser pocket.
Ron and Hermione exchanged a look over the top of their cards. Ginny was supposed to be his partner, but she’d wandered off to get another jug of Pimm’s and ginger, and Harry wished she’d hurry up because he was pants at remembering the rules for Five Hundred, and also he was getting rather thirsty.
Hermione entered the kitchen right on time. “How are my boys? And my tenderloins?”
Malfoy grunted again. “Tell that to Robards. It’s like he thinks
Harry waited until Devlin had gathered the samples and left the lab, before allowing himself to take a proper look at the floral arrangement on his workbench. The cocks trembled in concert, quivering ever so slightly in response to vibrations in the air – the sound of Vicky slamming the filing cabinet drawer closed outside in the foyer was faint to his ears, but he could see the bush rustle immediately in response. Harry could only imagine what the rest of the garden looked like, what with the constant rumble of bin trucks and lorries making their way along Throttlebottom’s busy street. It was almost like they were waving to you, inviting you to come over. Harry looked at the closed door briefly, then extended his wand to poke just the very tip against the side of one cock. It bobbed in reply, excitedly.
That was a tricky one. On the one hand, it was his favourite mug. On the other, tea without proper china.
“Why are you pushing so hard about this?”
“I think there's a case to be made that I turned you hard, actually.” He felt rather than heard Draco’s quiet laugh.
It was said with careful flatness. Draco tried to pull his hand away, but Harry held fast.
Potter laughed, and it was even more annoyingly attractive than his pasty-less smile. “Alright, I’ll go get my risk assessment reports. May I spare a minute to get a cup of tea, though? I promise you that I’ll be next to useless if I don’t have one soon.”
“What?” It felt like he’d fallen through the looking glass. “What photo, what the fuck are you on about?”
“Okay,” Harry said, and Malfoy smiled at him.
...but he’d never been harassed so much in his life. Not even right after the war. He was approached, constantly, he received unwashed knickers in the post around the clock, and the nudes -
When Harry was a safe distance, Draco tossed a fresh handful of powder into the Floo, and re-opened the connection. “What’s Minerva going to think when she sees you all rumpled?”
Potter adjusted his glasses and thumbed through some of the pages he was still holding. “Shift change at midnight, everything went as usual, all owls accounted for. Three had been checked out for overnight deliveries and were expected back in the morning, but the rest were in the roost where they should’ve been. There were only two Keepers on Gamma shift, that’s midnight to six, and they were both on the lower deck for most of the shift doing meal prep.” Here Potter shuddered, presumably at the thought of what that must entail. “Both claim they didn’t notice anything particular, other than a particularly stiff wind at around 2.30am. Apparently it wasn’t unusual enough to prompt a roost check, because the owls were only found to be missing about an hour before Alpha shift arrived at 5.45am.”
him nodding over the
He’d even fucked a woman once, jet black pixie cut with clear green eyes, and little tits that he’d enjoyed feeling in his palms far more than he’d expected he would. She’d looked remarkably like him, just smaller. He hadn’t had to try very hard to come, although the absence of another cock was disconcerting (and he had no idea what to do about the hard, slick little lump she had between her folds, though she seemed to have that well in hand, as it were), as was the absence of even a solitary strand of pubic hair. Why would anyone get rid of all that hair? Draco liked hair, all over, rough and dark, holding on to all the pheromones, and body odour. He imagined Potter would be rather hairy. He imagined it all the time. Sometimes he imagined it all over his sheets, or his fingers, or occasionally the inside of his pants.
“Yeah mate,” Ron said, already halfway across the car park and closing on the cafe. “It can wait a few. Not that I’m not keen to hear, but,” Ron gestured sheepishly. “Full English.”
“Will you
“Get out, Agatha,” Draco said with exasperation. “I don’t understand how you can just mouth off to your direct senior as calm as you like, but then quake at the mere suggestion of Harry bloody Potter.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Really. Any other hidden talents, or is this the only one?”
“Right,” Hermione said firmly. “Ginny, you will shut up going forward or I’ll hex you silent. Ron, stop making that face, you’re not helping. Harry, take a deep breath and stop freaking out. Don’t forget that the kids will be back at half two, so we can’t all carry on over this news for the rest of the afternoon.” She gave them all a stern look. “I’ve waited a long time for this and I won’t have you ruin it.”
The pasta salad was no complicated dish. The spirals only needed a little time to boil, and the lardons came in a pre-chopped packet from Waitrose, so he could fry them off at the same time as the pasta was cooking. The rest of the veg just needed a fine chop and by the time he was done, so was the pasta. While it was still hot and slippery in the colander, he tossed through a spoonful of the mayo, to stop it from sticking together in a horrible noodle lump, then dumped his curry powder and mustard in the jar, and gave it a quick stir, then an almighty shake.The spirals were dressed in golden yellow in moments, and the bacon, and scallions, and peppers, and coriander mixed through, and then there was nothing else to do but wait for Malfoy, and quietly implode.
“I don’t really dance,” Draco lied, and Potter’s smile widened.
Harry looked at Ron in appeal. “Help?”
Draco tugged Harry’s hand, and drew him out of the shower. “Take me to bed, and show me how much you love my hips, then.”
She laughed, and it did not bode well for any of them, least of all Longbottom. “Suppose you’ve seen His Majesty, then.” Draco glared at his drink. There wasn’t a living being in the place who hadn’t seen Potter arrive. Draco could see a barely legal blond boy directly across from him who was almost wetting himself with excitement about it. He decided it hadn’t been a question that required an answer, so said nothing, and instead dipped his finger in his drink. It was colder than it should have been, considering he’d ordered it a good half hour ago, and this place was broiling hot. It tasted of Ice Mice. He fucking hated Ice Mice. Theo had bought it for him, but Theo had tastebuds in his arsehole, so Pansy liked to say. “Listen, are you going to be alright?” She looked back at Longbottom, her eyebrows drawing together with concern. “I didn’t plan this. I wouldn’t put you in his path if I could avoid it, you know that.”
“I remember.”
He’d wondered many times what Potter was up to. His departure from the Aurors had occurred when Draco was barely through training and was a Junior sent to talk to old ladies feuding with neighbours over rose bushes, and all the crap jobs like filing and copying. Weasley never mentioned it, even when they became partners, and eventually became friendly. He did try to discreetly dig for information from time to time, even now that Weasley was promoted and was technically his boss, but the ginger git always gave him a certain look when he did, like he knew exactly what Draco was doing.
“Very good, Harry. Is that what you like? A hard cock in your mouth, and a couple of digits sliding into your tight hole? You want to straddle his face while yours is pressed in his lap?”
. Draco tasted copper in his mouth, and realised he had bitten the inside of his cheek hard enough to bleed.
ready. In need of some advice. And really very hungry, he realised, as his stomach burbled. Man could not live on Lucozade alone.
“Sit!” Teddy yells, and Harry looks at Malfoy, whose eyes are huge with panic.
He was vaguely familiar with most of London, a byproduct of his former Auror days, and Tabernacle was only a few minutes walk from the station. Not far enough to account for the redness in Harry’s cheeks, but he was determined to go through with this, every agonising moment of it, no matter how much he blushed or sweated, or how much Malfoy rinsed him for it. He needed this. Malfoy and Hermione were right (which would probably cause either of them to die of shock if they knew they were in agreement), and like everything else he’d overcome in his life, it was a matter of throwing himself into it and letting his body find its natural rhythm. Just like it had with flying, with Quidditch, with magic in general.
Fuck.
There was comfort in his weekly routine, everything planned out just so. Comfort even in his uniform of business shirts, bland ties, and boring novelty pants. He liked the security of a normal, average life. He never had to plan a social calendar or even an outfit. He revelled in the humdrum; going to the toilet whenever he felt like, which had been a luxury in the years before Hogwarts, and having the freedom to leave the door open when he was in there if he liked, and the seat up without anybody complaining. He could wander around the house in just his pants, or less, back and forth from his bedroom to the bathroom blissfully nude, and he took as much time as he wanted in the shower without any Weasley’s banging on the door telling him to hurry up because it was their turn, or dorm mates accusing him of having a wank. And if he
Malfoy snorted. “You
“Yes, I said alright, keep your hair on.” Christ alive.
“Nothing,” Hermione said smoothly. “Seven hearts. What’s going on with Malfoy, then?”
what, Malfoy. When I - put my mouth there. Between her legs.”
,” Draco moaned, and they stopped talking about cleaning and parties for just a little while longer.
). He was also allowed to keep the chest of baby clothes, which he insisted upon while blushing furiously. They hadn’t had a proper talk about kids, but Harry wanted them, and he wasn’t ready to let go of the baby stuff just yet. Just in case. Draco didn’t object, but he looked as if he had a few questions about it.
Harry moved his hand from his hair and finally shoved down his pants, freeing his cock which was about as hard as it had ever been. He pressed his left hand to the mirror, and started to stroke with the other. The lube was warm and slick. Malfoy would like this. He’d like watching this. He’d tell Harry he was a good boy, to give him a show. He’d bite Harry’s neck, and pull Harry’s hair, and Harry would come and come and come.
“Sort of.”
Harry tried to cuddle him, forcing his arms to work and clasp around his hips, and Draco kissed him exhaustedly, just a brush of tongues and lips now.
“And did you give her a hard time about it?”
Wedderburn was new.
“Shut up,” Draco could see his reflection in the glass table top, and his face was brick red. “I’m not a Victorian spinster!”
“Nope, it can all go,” Harry said, determinedly. “And no, not all the rooms will be this easy. I made sure I only kept the free Quidditch kit in this one, nothing that was personal. I was trying to be organised.”
well that ends well, eh?” Weasley looked so pleased with himself, that Draco only shook his head, rather than say any of the snide remarks he would otherwise have liked to. “Come on, that was pretty good!”
“A disgusting amount,” Draco said, Levitating it down the stairs to the landing below. “Some sycophant gave it to my parents for a wedding anniversary in the eighties. It’s fuck ugly and we all hated it, but I bet it could raise a few sickles for Mungo’s.”
Harry didn’t quite know what to make of that. Hermione had been the first one to say
Ron was towards Harry’s left, so Pereira went next, and immediately and without shame admitted to wanting to boff Etchells’ brains out. Oldmeadow said he’d marry Dawlish, because Dawlish was close to retirement and hopefully would be persuaded to do all the housekeeping once on home duties, as Oldmeadow apparently hated cleaning more than anything, including Dawlish.
“Change rooms,” Weasley said. “You’ve got about ten before they hit the pitch.”
. I worked hard to get where I am, for many years-”
“Yeah,” Draco said, still feeling a bit wrong-footed from Weasley’s comments over lunch. “Did you look over the interview summary?”
“Here’s what I think,” Granger leaned in, tapping her nails on the glass table. “You look like someone is ripping your heart to shreds in small increments. He’s bumbling around in a black temper, completely confused and frustrated. I would guess that neither of you has bothered to have an actual conversation about your relationship, like a pair of utter nitwits. You quite obviously have deeper feelings than just casual sex, and you’ve decided the best solution is to just vanish from the radar.” She raised her eyebrows at him. “Go on, tell me I’m wrong.”
“No, we’re clear,” Potter said, and he commenced divesting Draco of his outer robe. “You’re dirty, you know that?”
“Shut
Given there was no chance of an honest conversation in his near future, Draco did what he could to limit the overlap. He put in for a permanent shift change, and now he was on late, 1pm to half-ten. It was absolute hell on his body clock, he felt like he had the flu for a week, and kept getting up for those dawn runs, at first. Until he’d run into Potter near the Tate Modern gardens. Potter was sprawled out on the steps near the Millennium Bridge, with a cigarette in one hand, and a Costa cup in the other. Potter called out to him, and Draco had nearly tripped over his own feet.
“Yes, public recreation and amusement
The less they looked like Potter, the more alcohol Draco generally needed to reach an acceptable level of satisfaction. He’d try nearly anyone with that diabolical combination of dark hair, light eyes, and glasses. He wasn’t fussy - well, he
“Everyone is visible from the office,” Malfoy was saying. “The glass is integrated with the charm, which allows it to look like a regular wall on one side, and reveals all those present in the shop, on the other. That’s how I keep an eye on things, and see if I need to send anyone onto the shop floor if it’s getting busy. I’m not normally out there, you see,” Malfoy said conversationally, as he watched a rather large wizard pay for a length of velvet rope and a blindfold. “But it’s been a bit relentless today, and all my people are already on the floor. I don’t like to keep the customers waiting. They mostly know what they want, and would prefer to be in and out quickly, as it were.”
“Nope, no thank you,” Harry pulled Draco away and into the middle of the room for a dance. “Your mum’s crying.”
“Won’t it be less fun for you if he does all his seething in private?”
Ron gave him a knowing look. “Enjoying a bit of hand-to-gland combat, I’d reckon.”
“I’d like to see you try.”
“Fanny Ballhatchet? At a postbox in Cockfosters.” Harry rolled his eyes. “I suspect you’re probably right.” He folded up the list and tucked it back into his notebook, closing the cover and slotting it and his quill back into his robes. “Look – thanks Malfoy. This has actually been a great help to the investigation.”
“Merlin, Harry,
“That would be grand, thank you Vicky.” Harry fished out his wand. “I took care of the

Harry never really looked at himself. Never had done. He’d never had much time or reason to. There hadn’t been a mirror in his cupboard, nor much light to see with even if there had been, and the bathroom was a place he’d hurried through once a week while the Dursley’s were at their Sunday morning service, carefully wiping every trace of water and steam from the mirrors and tiles afterwards with his scratchy, musty towel. Whenever he looked at himself in those days, it was to see a pale and skinny goblin staring back, too small, with scruffy hair and crooked, broken glasses. A freak in second hand clothes. It was better not to look at all, to let his focus slide past that unfortunate creature and concentrate on the task at hand.
His mouth twisted sideways in a smile, and he nodded. “I know. You’re right.”
“Shhh,” Harry kissed him firmly again. “Crying is healthy. It releases oxytocin, which is a chemical in your brain that can make you feel better.” He brushed his fingers through Teddy’s fringe, which flickered a warm pinky-purple in answer. “Hermione told me that, so it must be true, because she’s the cleverest person I ever met.”
“Do I even want to know why your teapot is in your filing cabinet?”
Harry did as told, not bothering to ask how an examination of his throat might reveal whether a curse affecting his magic was cured, or not. He’d long since given up questioning the methods of Healers and Mediwix. Healer Hosford was pointing his wand down Harry’s gullet, and a curl of orange steam seemed to be travelling slowly out, propelled by his long and lusty ‘aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah’. But the orange seemed a friendly colour, and Hosford didn’t seem alarmed by it, so Harry decided he wasn’t alarmed either.
“There’s something about you when you’re barking orders,” Potter said from somewhere just behind Draco’s right shoulder. His breath was warm and distinctly whisky-laced. Draco clamped down on an involuntary shiver before it betrayed him, but could do nothing about the goose bumps which prickled along his nape despite his best efforts.
“You say ‘tried’, which implies I was unsuccessful,” Harry looked pointedly around their kitchen, then at Draco’s engagement ring, and back at his own. Draco narrowed his eyes.
Draco gave his teacup a little poke and re-heated his tea, then did the same for Potter’s. “What do you think this is, domestic terrorism? Foreign interference?”
“It’s called magic. You may be familiar with it from such places as our seven years at Hogwarts, or your current job in the Ministry of Magic.” Draco waved his wand in Potter’s face. “Don’t touch anything in my office, Potter. You’re a fright. You have ink on your fingers already, and it’s only a quarter after seven. How does that even happen? You’re yet to actually pick up a quill today, I’m sure.”
beside Draco, his hand closing around Draco's wrist. Draco froze.
“Clubbing? Malfoy, we’re thirty two.”
“Is that an offer?” Potter called after him, but Draco refused to turn or answer, because his face was red again and he absolutely wouldn’t give Potter the satisfaction.
, take it."
“It’s barely four.” Draco had a feeling there would be other kinds of stiffness afflicting him if he let Potter give him a massage.
ing the whole lot.”
“They’re too small to be carrying such large parcels!” The words burst forth along with a few fat tears. “You should see how their little bodies suffer! It’s cruel, magic-folk are horrible to creatures and the owls included. I was just trying to rescue the smallest ones, I promise. I didn’t mean to do treason or anything — I promise!” Verity was howling properly now, and Potter put his arm around her reassuringly, pressing a crisp handkerchief into her hands.
"Yes, please. A cup of tea would be appreciated."
Malfoy smirked. “I assumed you were already well aware of your brewing deficiencies, Potter. I’d be happy to schedule a daily reminder of all your flaws and weaknesses, though, if you’d find that helpful.”
“You made me
“Of course not!”
“What’s this?” Draco’s voice was nearly a croak.
“Hmm. Maybe I deserve a special reward, later.”
things.”
“Which bit? ‘Your cock is amazing, Potter, don’t stop’? I’d rather remember that, if you don’t mind.”
. Going out with
“No problem.” Finally, something he wouldn’t feel guilty for spending money on.
“Should we wait until after we’ve asked him the huge and inconvenient favour of sorting out the results of my childhood poverty and poor impulse control?”
Draco shrugged, and busied himself closing and locking his door. “Yeah, but I kind of like
Potter leaned against him, laughing against his neck. “I did it on purpose, you idiot.” He began to mouth gently at Draco’s throat, which felt like literally the best thing that had ever happened to him. Draco struggled for breath.
Seamus, the prick.
Blaise seconded the plan, and Theo could always be counted on to vote with the majority. So out Draco was, in tight-fitting dark trousers and a white tshirt that was really more of a suggestion of clothing than anything of substance, propping up the bar at a place he couldn’t remember the name of, with a shot of something clear in front of him, and neon light all around.
Draco felt a familiar lump in his throat. “Well. There might not be anything to step into, anymore.”
“Who can say. I didn’t make them.”
Potter looked at his hand again, and rubbed at a splodge of blue along the side of one forefinger. “Well, it’s probably there from yesterday, and if I can’t budge it, it’s probably not going to rub off onto your precious stationery anytime soon, which, by the way, you are very weirdly attached to. Now come on, Malfoy. Why don’t you tell me why you’re actually annoyed with me so we can sort it out instead of shouting at each other every day.”
"Let me see it."
“Erm, no preference. Anyone you fancy?” The moment the words had left his mouth, Harry realised his mistake, and he turned his face away from Malfoy’s side of the office and mostly hid his head in a large scroll of parchment. “Any
Draco stared. “Yeah, he said. Harry, what the hell is going on?”
“Are you sure it’s alright for us to be here?”
“Since when?”
"I didn't have anywhere else to go, you know."
Ron laughed so hard that the dong fell onto the table with a dull thud. “Maybe not, mate, but Hermione has these anatomical models from her third year Healer training. Maybe she can tell you where she got them.”
“Yes, thank you – got it.”
“You made me sandwiches?” Harry stared at them.
Draco decided it probably wouldn’t actually kill any elves if he shouted, since they were normally accustomed to being screamed at anyway. “Get out.” They vanished with a collective squeak. Potter hesitated at the door, and Draco rolled his eyes. “Not
“Might be my penis, actually,” Harry said, and Neville, who had just walked in from the sitting room, turned directly around and back the way he came.
“We could go together, if you like.”
The shampoo was fully rinsed now. “I don’t give you enough credit for your wisdom.”
He gave Malfoy two fingers and nearly spilled his tea on himself for his trouble. “Obviously I have a full time job, as you can see. I’m in the office by eight most mornings, and normally head off around six. I have lunch with Ron most days in the Ministry refectory, unless one of us is in the field. Sometimes we might venture out for a pub meal if Hermione’s free too. Monday, Wednesday and Sunday are gym nights. I’m not technically required to train now that I’m not auroring, but I like keeping it up. Thursday is always beers at the Leaky with the old Auror crew. Friday night is family dinner with the Weasleys, and the last Sunday of every month I have lunch with my cousin Dudley.”
"None left…all out."
“Oh, have a day off, Malfoy.” He sipped his whisky, and Draco did his best not to notice the smooth movement of Potter’s throat, or to gulp his own champagne. “So, I expect you’re going to celebrate my genius in your closing speech, then?”
“Oh,” Malfoy’s voice is soft, surprised. “And - and what about you?”
Draco mumbled against his neck, where he seemed to be trying to lick his way to his internal organs.
"You know I didn't want you to be sentenced, don't you."
in Azkaban for that, actually.”
“Don’t make a fucking scene in front of Teddy.” Potter turned sharply, and Disapparated both of them to Number Twelve. Draco stumbled on landing in the parlour, and Potter steadied him by the elbow.
“And you would know,” Ron said proudly, “because you and me were exactly the same.”
“Alexander McQueen?”
“You two are being weird,” Harry said, staring after Ron’s retreating back..
“-people kept sending me gifts and things. Like, just ordinary people, you know, but also  business, stuff like that. Sometimes they cried. I didn’t want to accept it all, but I felt like I couldn’t say no sometimes.” Harry looked around himself, helplessly. “I always meant to do something with it all. Not bin it, that would be horrible, and such a waste, but do something good with it. Like, an auction or a raffle, maybe, to raise money for Janus Thickey, or donate it to Hogwarts, or maybe set up a fund and distribute it to families who can’t afford it.” Harry shrugged. “Something good.”
Draco blinked at her, ironically still stuck on fanny. “I’m speaking to Potter a normal amount, for colleagues who work in different departments.”
my workload! You’ve increased it! Do you know what happens any time you even express the mildest of concerns that there may be any sort of security issue at an event? Scrivener tries to cancel it! And then what do I have to do? Run around behind him, trying to smooth things over, wearing green like a bloody twit with a pocketful of butterscotch doing my best not to say ‘canoe’ while persuading him that a gobstones tournament is not tantamount to lining innocent children up in a firing squad!”
After a little while, Theo took Draco to BT and got him the iPhone, and Blaise went out for macchiatos and brought them back with warm croissants filled with lemon curd, and honey
Harry quickly settled his bill, after ordering the jugs of beer he’d come to get in the first place, and sending them over to the table with a flick of his wrist. “Excuse me,” he caught the attention of a bartender, who stopped short and blinked in surprise when she clocked his scar. “Can we use your staff Floo? It’s an emergency.” He didn’t say it was Auror business, but he let it be implied, and the bartender seemed happy to oblige Harry Potter.
“No.” Draco hadn’t slept. What he’d done instead was panic, nearly cry, nearly vomit, nearly Apparate back to Potter’s house. He spent the night in a spiral, decanting the memories of their conversation into his Pensieve, of the last time they’d had sex, of a dozen or more other encounters together to try and make sense of what Potter had told him. He’d paced for hours considering the chat with Weasley. He’d even resorted to playing Coldplay on repeat through the stereo, but in hindsight that had only served to exacerbate the glum.
“From you, you bloody git!” Harry forgot himself and used his wooden spoon to gesture at Draco, causing grains of arborio to spatter on the flagstones. Draco shook his head in what may have passed for genuine disdain to the untrained eye, but which Harry could see was full of teasing mirth, and pulled out his wand to clear up the mess. “The only reason you got away with it was Smith didn’t realise it was you, and I refused to tell them who I was with.”
“I don’t think that’s true,” Ginny said. “I think that lovely head of yours is absolutely empty, except for one thing.”
Harry laughed and cracked open the can. “Yes, alright, thank you.”
“Yeah,” he said again, feeling hopeful. “So you have tomorrow off too?”
“Welcome back.” Draco smiled down at her, his hands continuing their soothing rhythm. “Shall we see what the little piggy has brought us?” He pulled a reluctant laugh from her that sounded more like a scoff and they focused their attention on Harry, whose brows had knit together in concern. “Well, don’t keep us waiting. What does he want?” His hands stilled on Hermione’s shoulders as he waited for his lover’s bad news.
“Harry, I’ve told you to call me Kingsley. I think we’ve known each other long enough by now for you to be comfortable with it.” Kingsley leaned back in his chair, dropped his quill, and flexed his hand to release the cramp from writing for so long.
He pulled his spiral note pad and ball point from his pockets and flipped to a sheet bearing the name of this establishment. If he couldn’t find a lead from here he would have to approach people who may hold a grudge against Hermione, and that would be an awkward conversation to be having with people who you knew personally. It was always more difficult when you knew, or thought you had known, the suspects.
“Thank you.” He accepted the glass and took a measured sip, savoring the burn of the alcohol. “I believe you know what happened to Auror Thomas the other day.” At George’s solemn nod Draco continued, “Thomas was not the intended target. We- no. I failed to detect anything more serious on the food item and though I managed to keep him alive, I still put the lives of my fellow aurors in danger.” He took another sip and stared into the charred hearth as if seeking the answers to the universe within.
“Talking to the cat again? What evil plots are you two conjuring up now?” Harry strode in looking dapper and ready to walk through the floo for a party.
Hermione’s brain just would not stop. She had gone into the office in the hopes that working through the paperwork of their recent case files would be a productive way to distract her from what had happened that morning. After they had taken her to bed and demonstrated just how intensely they felt about her, several times in fact, they had had a serious conversation about their relationships with each other. It had been weighing on her well into the afternoon and even the thought of George in thrall to the resurrection stone didn’t chase the thoughts away long.
Draco nodded and continued, “While there is a detailed account in the file it was actually Winky’s friend Dippet that reported Holly’s suspicious activity to us. Winky brought the information to me and I followed up with Dippet today. I was just arriving back from that when I ran into Holly in my office.”
Draco nodded and finished off his tea. “Just a couple more questions, Molly, and then this formality will be out of the way.” He smiled invitingly, leaning on his charming nature to put her off guard.
“Draco. Did you recently borrow one of the family alchemy books by chance?” Narcissa continued on as if the tension at the table didn’t exist.
“Someone get that fucking cake to the lab. I want to know exactly what poison was used. I will send him to Azkaban personally once we have the proof.” When no one moved an inch Harry barked, “Now!” and it was like a shot had gone off. Everyone was in motion, the cake was taken to the lab, Saint Mungo’s was called for a team to move the downed auror for further treatment, paperwork was suddenly intensely interesting.
“Alright, Harry, Draco, let’s get her back home.” Arthur herded everyone into the living room to say their goodbyes, Hermione’s hair slowly losing its volume as her rage calmed to minor irritation. He pulled her into a tight hug and whispered to her “I understand, daughter of my heart, but don’t do something you may regret. Magic always seeks to balance wrongdoings like those done to us.” She melted against him and sobbed into his chest.
“You should have seen their faces, Draco.” She passed the plastic bag of takeaway to Harry and spread her arms, turning on the spot, her crimson dress clinging to her in all the right places, its short skirt stretched tight across her thighs, black accents matching her black stockings. His heart was pounding in his ears and his vision narrowed to the beautiful woman in front of him. He reached out and pulled her into an impromptu waltz around the dining table.
Draco scoffed at her and smirked, “Never would have guessed.” He reached down and patted her knee gently. The intimate contact, innocent as it was, caused a small gasp to be drawn from her.
“Well, you see, one Christmas we were all set to go to the Weasley’s and Draco-” Harry’s mouth was firmly covered by a hand.
“You’re both doing it now. The scowling. Something must have gone completely tits up.” Harry groaned and reached for the case file. “Well let’s get into it then, so we can get it over with.” He flipped the folder open to the report and scanned it. “Her mother.” He deadpanned.
Hermione’s hand tightened on Draco’s thigh. She was doing so well. Draco had been on the receiving end of that fiery, beautiful, temper of hers many times. If the Weasel wasn’t careful he would find her limits sooner rather than later. Draco placed his left hand over her hand she had rested on his thigh and glanced over her head at Harry. Harry’s mask was quickly slipping into righteous indignation on the part of their Hermione.
Harry was brought out of his musing by shouting from outside his door. He leapt up and made it to the break nook in record time, Hermione and Neville hot on his heels. He found Draco leaned over Dean Thomas casting every spell he could think of to determine the cause and stem the convulsions of the man who had no love for him. “What in the hell happened here?” Harry barked and someone shouted “The cake, sir!” while another voice shouted “Accio! Bezoar!” and in Harry’s hand was pressed a solid weight. Poison. Harry quickly pulled Dean up, tilted his head back, and shoved the bezoar as far down his throat as he could manage, then massaged the esophagus of the slowly dying man until it passed into his stomach to work at absorbing and neutralizing whatever poison Ron had decided to put in that blasted cake.
“Thanks.” Hermione muttered before sipping her tea.
“Right. Right. I meant… I don’t know what I meant.” George deflated with a shake of his head, “Anyway, he’s top of the list. But there are other people who hate Hermione. Of course there are. She has been beating people senseless with her wit and personality since before Dumbledore’s Army. I wouldn’t be surprised if Cho Chang or Marietta Edgecombe were still holding a grudge over that little extra curricular.” He laughed, a genuine laugh, and it eased some of the tension that had settled inside Draco.
Thank you for your patience with this story which can be slow to update. We lost two more employees at my job so everyone is pulling doubles and six day weeks until we can get more bodies trained. Also, just a quick warning that the latter two thirds of this chapter are a bit lewd and if that’s not to your taste I apologize. I won’t blame you for skipping it, but I feel like it serves as an intimate insight into our main characters and I hope that if you choose to read it that it is enjoyable.
“Oh of course dear. It’s no trouble. I heard about what happened to Dean Thomas. He was such a sweet boy. I’m so glad he pulled through.” Molly gazed sadly into her cup.
“Oh, hullo Ron, nice to see you hard at work.” George stood and blocked Ron’s view of the table. “How, may I ask, are our supplies getting ordered if you’re not taking stock and doing the job I asked of you?”
“Still, sir, you should join us next time. I think Hermione would enjoy another debate with you. Imagine what the two of you could come up with if you stopped walking on eggshells around each other.” Harry slipped his hands in his pockets and observed his former professor.
“Granger. Punctual as usual.” He winked as he pulled the chair next to hers out to seat Harry between them. The insistence that she come to tea, that she meet them there separately, the pushy way he forced the floo address on her, the air of a barely contained smile, it all fell into place. Harry and Draco had conspired to surprise her with another family dinner to replace the brunch Ron ruined.
“Oh Hermione, dear, you’ll understand when you’ve married that sometimes you need to grease the wheels a bit. Especially if you’ve had a fight. There’s no sense in not patching things up is there?” Molly grabbed Hermione’s hand and patted it as though she were a small child.
“It was lovely as always, if not a bit more dramatic than usual, and I hope we can do it again some time, just us men. Hermione as well, of course.” Draco shook each of their hands before being embraced by Arthur.
An owl, carrying a lavender colored envelope, swooped into the room and alighted on the high back of a chair, sticking its leg out for him to take the letter. He absently thanked the bird and petted its feathers, turning the envelope over to reveal his mother’s familiar cursive that read ‘my dragon’. He broke the wax seal and read the missive inviting him, his betrothed, and their partner in crime solving to an early evening tea with her. Noticing the owl awaiting his response he quickly penned a note that the next evening would be preferable as he would also like to arrange for the Weasleys to join them, briefly explaining the row at the family brunch. He folded the reply, stuffed it into a small leather tube, and tied it around the owl’s leg.
He flicked his wand and the photo rejoined the rest of the paperwork shifting lazily in patterns to help Hermione think. “We should probably go back and interview the elves. We were interrupted the other day, after all. It will get us out of the office for more than a few hours and keep your mind off things like the Weasel.”
“Sorry, Longbottom.” Draco gestured for him to step closer and look. “This is the worst yet she’s gotten from Weasley trying to win her back. You have to see it.”
His laugh sent chills down her spine, she noticed his pupils dilating. He was enjoying their banter. Good. She had missed being able to be open with others without thinking what Ronald would say. She had missed being able to flirt with others. If she had given any kind of positive attention to another in front of him it would always end up in one of their blow outs. Her smile faded.
Harry burst back into the room and pulled off his blazer and tie. “I’m needed in the office. They’ve got a lead on the poison. I shouldn’t be gone overly long but don’t wait for me. I’ll be back for pudding.” He leaned down and kissed Draco on the lips, and turned and pulled Hermione in for a kiss and realized a hair’s breadth from her lips that she wasn’t his and diverted his kiss to the tip of her nose. “Have enough fun for me, too.” He smiled at the flush on her cheeks and took off toward the floo, rolling up his sleeves.
“Longbottom, Bones, a pleasure as always.” Draco smiled at the pair and turned to Weasley, his lips curling into a self-satisfied smirk. “Weasel.” He ushered Hermione into the seat next to Harry and followed her into the booth, effectively sandwiching her between the two of them. A public, if less than subtle, signal that she was being protected by the two of them while Weasley sat across from Draco on the outside of the booth. His disheveled appearance and general lack of calm did nothing to dispel Draco’s smirk. The Weasel was off kilter, good, that meant that Hermione would have the upper hand in their little party of Hogwarts alumnus.
“Potter. I would say that you were definitely right. I am almost certain she liked the idea.” Draco tried to make a joke but Harry couldn’t get the picture of her out of his head. Bent over his desk, fingers buried in her quim, on display for anyone to see reflected in the glass panes of the window behind her. His hands were trembling a little as his cock throbbed.
“Please, stop calling me that. If you have to call me anything just call me Harry.” Harry pleaded for the dozenth time with the spirit of Death.
Harry pulled back and cupped her cheeks with his hands, gazing adoringly into her brown eyes. “Hermione, we’ve talked about it, many times, and if you’ll have us then we want you to be ours. His, mine, and ours. For as long as you’ll have our sorry arses. We have been so desperately in love with you that you brought us together and we ended up loving each other as much as we loved you.” He layed kisses all over her face as he spoke and ground his hips into hers, pressing his erection into her, as if to punctuate his desire. “We knew, when he’d stolen your heart, that we would love you from afar and as platonically as we could manage, but we kept slipping. Kept taking liberties. We knew that we could never forget our love for you was the furthest thing from platonic and so we tried to give you distance, because you seemed so. Fucking. Happy. With that piece of dragon shite.”
“We made it, by some miracle.” Draco smoothed his napkin onto his lap and leaned toward Harry. “Thank you for indulging me in a public date.” His voice droppped conspiratorily.
Harry sighed, caught Draco’s eyes, and tilted his head toward the empty chair across from him. When Draco finally settled into the chair he squared his shoulders. This wouldn’t be easy. “Hermione isn’t the kind of woman to back down from a fight. She won’t be cowed by something like this.” He took a long sip of tea before smiling at his lover. “She was always like that though. Don’t you remember?” He took Draco’s hand across the table and stroked the back of it with his thumb.
“Alright, I’m ready to go.” He pushed the door open and was met with the sight of Draco tilting Hermione’s face up toward him as he whispered something to her. Her face flushed from more than just her wine, her eyes flicked to him nervously and she licked her lips. A nervous habit of hers. Draco released her and nodded once, his point apparently proven, and he herded Harry back to the floo. “Don’t dally Potter.”
Hermione chuckled at Draco’s feigned arrogance. The three of them made their way to the sitting room and flooed to the Ministry of Magic’s atrium and began the walk to their department. As they went to step into the lifts a hand closed around Hermione’s wrist and pulled her back into the crowd. The doors of the lift closed on Harry and Draco as they turned around at her yelp of surprise.
Draco strode with purpose into a garish red and orange building on Diagon Alley only to be greeted with an eerie silence. It was just closing time but there were no customers milling around the bombastic displays of pranks. No children screaming in delight as they discovered tiny balls of fur that looked suspiciously like those Tribbles from that cheesy space show Harry had shown him.
The floo roared to life behind them and Draco and Hermione stepped out together to a chorus of “‘Mione!” and “Oi, Malfoy!” and before you could say quidditch the three of them became surrounded by redheads. There was much jostling, shoulder clapping, hugging, and all around merriment.
“Ready?” Harry poked his head through the kitchen door frame. He smiled at the domesticity of Hermione straightening Draco’s clothes. “We are going to be only on-time if you keep fussing. I know you love being early.” He teased.
Draco leaned in with a low whistle, “That... is a terrible pun. Glad you’re shot of him if that’s the measure of his wit.” She lifted the cake to dump it into the bin but he stayed her hand. “Now, love, let’s not waste a perfectly awful cake.” He pulled the platter from her hands and led her toward Harry’s office. “At least let Potter take a look at it firsthand.”
Draco left with the cake to deposit it in the break nook and Harry leaned against his desk watching Hermione wildly gesticulate as an echo of her temper flared during her explanation. Her cheeks flushed, arms flailing, hair trying to break free of its confines, all of it sent a warmth spreading through him. She was finally back to being the lively witch he had fallen for. He would not lose her again, especially to someone like Ronald Weasley.
In which Hermione investigates a kidnapping.
“Shall we, Granger?” He held out a hand to her, casually flicking his wand to turn on the music, a lilting waltz. She placed a hand in his and stood to join him, her heart hammering in her chest. He pulled her tight against him and adjusted her hold to a more traditional wizarding style before sweeping her into the dance, skillfully leading her through the dining room and into the adjacent sitting room. Time slipped away from them as the heat from Draco’s hand on her hip spread through her body and into her core.
Harry was late. It was date night, more or less, with Draco and the paperwork in the Auror office was seemingly never-ending. Harry stood and stretched, flicking his wand at the stack of reports they neatly arranged themselves in his ‘in box’ on his desk. He wouldn’t get any more work done today, even if he stayed another hour or three. He pulled his cloak on as a silvery otter slipped through the closed door and Hermione’s voice echoed through his office.
“Oh please, as if it was some momentous occasion. It’s just sex Draco.” She tilted her head in thought, “It had felt as though it was supposed to be something special at the time. I’ve come to realize that virginity is just a social construct and there is nothing fundamentally different about me compared to when I was a virgin. Except maybe my own comfort with myself and my sexuality.” She rolled her eyes and took a drink of her wine.
“Good morning sleepy head.” Harry responded cheerfully, breaking away from Draco’s hold to prepare a cup of tea for her. Draco leaned back against the window sill and watched the scene unfold. Harry placed a mug of tea and a small plate of biscuits in front of his best friend.
The door to Harry’s office was slightly ajar and his voice carried through the gap, “No, Dennis, I don’t have anything official to comment about the matter. You are an excellent investigative reporter, and the moment I have something concrete to say on the matter I will OWL you. Good day.” Hermione stood to the side as the door flung open and Dennis Creevey stormed past them, a quill and parchment trailing behind him. Draco entered the office first, and shut the door behind Hermione as she seated herself in front of Harry’s desk.
Harry gently pushed the kitchen door open to find Hermione with a single plate of pasta in front of her, glass of wine well in hand, and her wand tapping her thigh in annoyance. He leaned against the door frame, smile creeping onto his face.
Draco maneuvered behind her, placing her between the two men again, his thighs cupping hers, he wrapped his arms tightly around her waist. “You are so much more to me than just my partner, or my lover’s best friend. Hermione, I love you so much more than I could have ever expected. Every time we rush into battle you are the center of my focus. I can’t lose you. I fight so hard to keep us both alive, both coming home to Potter at the end of the day.” He buried his face into her curls as he fought the tears springing up in his eyes. His voice cracked, betraying his pain, “I know that you are more than capable of taking care of yourself, and you’ve saved my arse more than a dozen times in our years together. But love, please, let us do our best to protect you as you do to protect us.”
Draco stepped up beside her to peruse the information. “The Patils take the bond seriously, you know. I know you had a thing for freeing house elves when we were younger. SPEW, wasn’t it?” A flick of his wand brought a family photo of the Patils and their ten house elves forward to float in front of them.
“Oh, just the one for George, he asked for one featuring a broom, a quaffle, and a beater’s bat. I think he had mentioned a special event for Angelina coming up. I was happy to do so, of course. Oh I hope he’s planning to propose.” Molly beamed happily at him. Clearly at ease in his presence.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Draco pulled her tight against him, settling her bum tight against his crotch, spreading their legs enough for Harry to kneel between both of their thighs. As his lover and his partner kissed he swept her hair aside and laid kisses along the length of the back of her neck.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Hermione laughed at the girl’s enthusiasm and shook her head. “I’m surprised they still talk about that. Come on, let’s go let Kensington down easy, yeah?” She tilted her head toward the door and they made their way down to the training rooms. Hermione would have to give Kensington a hard ‘no’ on helping with the trainees. Every new class it never failed he would ask and refuse to take her no as final.
“Isn’t it just?” She scoffed, “Though she has returned, and so our case is technically closed. Though you should have seen her in that chair, Draco.” She stood and started pacing as he looked on. “Fidgety, not looking me in the eye, stuttering or hesitating on answers that should come easily. Completely suspicious.”
“A pun, right now? You are the worst.” She lobbed the nearest thing she could get her hands on at him, which happened to be a paperweight in the shape of a snitch. He caught it effortlessly, damn seekers. “We’ll need to write it up and submit it to Harry, either way.” She flopped into her chair and glared at the notes she had taken. “Now tell me about this lead?”
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
“It seems our faith in Master Snape is ever rewarded. Mister Potter, you must go to him and the moment those antidotes are done brewing take him to administer them to Mister Thomas.” Kingsley dropped into his chair and leaned over resting his elbows on his knees, hands clasped.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Hermione let out a sigh and glared at the open doorway as if it were somehow at fault. Auror Kensington was always after her and Draco to give demonstrations or teach classes. Their combination was originally volatile but once they reached an understanding they had worked together almost seamlessly. Their combination of intelligence, wit, and creativity quickly outpaced other auror pairs, they had been thrown impossible case after impossible case over the years because they had garnered a reputation for solving almost anything.
“It’s Fred. Gred is what George always called his twin brother Fred.” Hermione whispered as she stared morosely into the fire, lost in thought her hands resumed carding through his hair.
“But Granger, it’s date night. He should have set an alarm like I did. I’m starving you know. Wasting away, I am. My dear oblivious husband is letting me waste away. You don’t even have the decency to feed me while I’m waiting. You’re a terrible wife.”
They sat together in silence pondering the possibilities of why George, who had taken his twin’s passing harder than any one of them, was having imagined conversations with Fred in his workshop and it was implied this was a regular occurrence.
“You’ve slept most of the day, how do you feel?” Harry prodded gently, trying to see what she remembered this close after waking.
Draco smiled as he opened the door and strode into his lover’s office. “Oi, Potter, you need to see this one in person! Look at what the git sent this time.” He set the platter on the desk directly in front of Harry’s chair, turning to see two sets of eyes staring at him. Harry rose and crossed his office, Neville following behind slowly. “Malfoy, I was in a meeting. What was so important it couldn’t wait until Neville was finished?”
“But you’re an Auror too,” Ted was giggling again, and his hair had finally settled on his usual lovely brown.
“Kismet,” Malfoy said, with a surprised laugh. He leaned one shoulder into Harry’s, and didn’t lean away. “Look at you. Granger finally got you the word of the day bog roll, did she?”
Harry took a swipe at her foot, but she moved away too quickly. “Nothing much. Fire-breathing toasters, biting tea cups and toilet seats. A few weeks ago we confiscated a batch of cosmetics which turned people permanently orange. That almost completely evaded detection over the summer as most of the victims had recently been on hols in Magaluf and looked pretty much orange as it was, between the fake tan and the sunbathing.”
would have his loyalty for as long as there was a Lovegood in the editor’s chair. But Ginny was supposed to be at the family dinner that evening at the Burrow, and Harry had somehow managed to sleep through the sports update the night before on the wireless. If he showed up without knowing the Harpies place on the league table, Ginny would kick his arse, which would be entertaining for everyone other than Harry, and Hermione might accuse him of being a workaholic again based purely on one ill-timed nap. He could frankly live without a repeat of the dreaded intervention of 2008. Hence, the early edition of the
He sent a wandless charm at his latte to warm it up, gave it a little too much, then burned his throat while gulping it down in one. “So you guys are fine with it?”
Harry blindly groped for Malfoy’s wrist, and pulled him down onto the bed. Malfoy yelped. “Shhhh,” Harry threw an arm over his hips, and took Malfoy’s wand from slack fingers. “Don’t wake Nev.” He cast a wordless spell, and a bubble of silence encased the bed. “Quiet now,” Harry pushed his nose into the back of Malfoy’s neck. His hair smelled good. “Sleep.”
Potter let his eyes drift down Draco’s body like fingertips. His drew his wand from his thigh holster, and gestured with it. “Turn around, you lush. Healing first, flirting later.” Draco turned the water off and braced himself again against the tile, and Potter’s magic collided with his back a moment later. He made a noise, it was punched out of him rather than anything voluntary, and the pain coalesced before fading to a low thrum.
Without meaning to, he was forming a list of factors for and against starting something with Malfoy in his head. If he wanted to be more than a brief fling for Malfoy, then there would need to be more than just physical chemistry between them. Harry had already accepted that he wanted at least the fling - it had been so long, and Malfoy had woken something raw and desperate within him that he absolutely had to indulge. It felt though, like there could be something more there. Malfoy seemed a calmer man than he’d been as a boy, someone who knew himself and had confidence - not the false bravado of youth that bandaged over doubt, fear and self-loathing. He was clearly a capable man as well. His business seemed very successful, and discreet, the charms he’d created for his shop were clever and impressive, as was his ability to recognise the magic tangled together in the Throttlebottom case in the few moments he’d spent at Harry’s side in the lab. Harry found himself wanting to know what Malfoy did at the weekend, whether he cooked at all, and if he was any good at it if he did. Was Malfoy still interested in potions? What was his home like? Was he tidy, or a bit of a slob?  Who did he support in Quidditch these days, and how had he come to own a sex shop, and what did he like best in the bedroom?
Weasley looked absolutely delighted. “Yes, but mine actually fit.”
“Why not? Thank you.”
He looks so upset that Harry can’t bear it. He’s shaking with laughter as he puts his hands on Malfoy’s neck, thumbs his jaw, and kisses him. Malfoy’s mouth opens in apparent surprise, and Harry slides his fingers into Malfoy’s hair, and his tongue into Malfoy’s mouth.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Get out of my office.” Potter backed out of the room, awkwardly juggling the files and ducking away from the more aggressive memos. “Thank you!” Draco called after him, before closing his door and locking it with a wave of his wand. He fully intended to take complete advantage of this opportunity, effective immediately. He pulled the Quodpot contract closer, and frowned, crossing out several lines and re-writing them.
Ginny threw her herself dramatically back in her seat again. “I don't think I can wait, Harry!”
“In the orange singlet.” The vest was a horrendous colour, like a traffic cone, but the man underneath was gorgeous. “Looks like he has nice thighs.”
Malfoy’s laughter ricocheted through the quiet alley like a rogue hex. “Potter, that line was pure shite. I take back everything I said. You’ve done terribly and you’ve learned nothing.”
“Git,” Harry muttered, and so he began thrusting away with the dildo, like it was some sort of clumsy, sticky, obscene sword fight.
fucking okay!"
His neighbour didn’t reply for a little while. “So. You come here every week and try to find a Harry Potter knock off.”
Draco stood on the podium, determined not to squint even though the sunlight was glinting off the water directly into his eyes. There were half a dozen giggling children, wriggling around in bathing suits and pinching each other on the step just below him; three of them were Pansy’s brats, adorable, photogenic, and absolutely incapable of sitting still or keeping out of mischief. The press loved them, and Draco wasn’t sure who was getting more attention, the kids at his feet, or Scrivener on the podium beside him, booming out a pretentious sort of speech to open the Summer Swim program that effectively awarded all of the praise to himself, and didn’t mention the rest of the team even in passing. St Adjutor’s Public Baths for Witches and Wizards was full to the brim with members of the media, parents and children, nearly all of the staff from the Department of Magical Games and Sport and a handful of assorted VIP’s.
“Hey,” Draco said reproachfully, “Blaise is my best friend!”
Theo blinked at him, blearily. “Can this wait until Monday?”
His shoulders slumped a little, and he nodded at Fivepennies again. This time she nodded back. Message received.
“Yum. Also excellent. Anything else we should know about?”
A combination of both is to blame for Harry pushing Malfoy up against the cottage wall two nights ago, and snogging him blind.
Malfoy only laughed, and pulled away. “Looking, Potter. Just looking. Now turn around like a good boy, and tell me what you see that you like.”
“How dare you,” Draco tried to say, but his words were mostly muffled by Potter’s lips and tongue.
“Fuck off. You know you’re the best we’ve had.”
The scar in the middle of his chest was something Harry normally tried to avoid thinking of, let alone looking at, but tonight it didn’t make him feel like a freak. It was just a scar, after all. It’s not too bad, in the scheme of things - he hadn’t lost an ear, or worse. A Muggle might ask, someone from their world might know what had caused it and be frightened, or turned off, or fascinated, and Harry never liked the thought of that very much. But someone like Malfoy. Malfoy might run his fingers over it. Malfoy might kiss it. But he didn’t think Malfoy would let it come between them. Malfoy had scars too, ones Harry had given him, and others from the war, maybe some you couldn’t see or touch. Malfoy would understand. Malfoy would want him anyway and it wouldn’t be just because he was the famous Harry Potter. Wouldn’t he?
It was almost incendiary, the burning feeling in his fingertips, desperate to touch Malfoy, to take him by the hips and press him against the bevelled edge of the bar, and to take down his carefully casual bun and get his fingers into his hair, wrap the long, silvery strands around his fingers. His mouth nearly stung with wanting it, the press of imagined kisses on his lips and tongue. But there was also the heavier flame of disappointment, there. He could hear what Malfoy was saying, without saying it in so many words. Just friends.
, and Draco would kill him.
Draco turns again to Teddy. His face is entirely red, now, and he pulls out his wand and retrieves the spoon, charms it clean. Ted has claimed the bowl and has mashed its content into a bright pink smear, with roasted veg remnants up to his tiny plump elbows. No sharp points, there.
Ron shook his head. “You’re such a drama llama, Malfoy.”
“Just tell me why you being traditional means we can’t see each other anymore.”
Draco went home with Potter.
“I used to be jealous when you two were partners.” Harry was mostly on his stomach, his face in the pillows.
“Standard approach tactic, non-lethal force, contain and apprehend. You good to lead?” Draco nodded. “Right. I have your back. Shall we?”
Ted hooted with laughter. “You can’t say that! Oh my
There was a Playstation, and a Playstation 2, and an XBOX, and a Wii. Two brand new Dyson’s, the models now obsolete. A set of three non-stick frying pans, a vegan cookbook, a salad spinner still in the box. There was a chest - a big one - that was crammed full of baby clothing, things he’d bought for Ted when he was little, then for Rosie and Hugo, but had never given them. There was a camp chair. A tent. A box of Halloween decorations. There were three boxes of the same dinner setting, Christmas patterned. Every Muggle board game ever manufactured. A kite. Another, bigger kite. A model kit for a Ford Anglia. A full set of luggage in a horrible yellow. Worse, though…
