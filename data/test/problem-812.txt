“I have been thinking about this for a long time. You do not have to decide right now, dear, but I just want to let you know in case you decide it is the right decision. I trust your judgement,” She closes her eyes for a moment before reaching out to grasp Draco’s hand. His mother carefully places the object into his palm and wraps his fingers around it. As she drops her arms, Draco is gathering the courage to look down at his hand.
Draco flinches at the reminder of that incident—he’ll never admit it to anyone, but he recognizes now that he may have overreacted to the Hippogriff attack just a tad.
Potter’s frown deepens, his face puzzled. “Did you just call him Draco? Hermione—”
Draco glances at Greg. “Hat on.” He nods and quickly complies.
I remember!” She snaps, sending Ron a fierce glare, “But that doesn’t mean we should stoop down to his level and treat him the same as he did us. We would be just as bad as him and all the others who treated people like me horribly,” Hermione softens slightly, “Trust me, I get how hard it is going to school with Malfoy again. You don’t need to forgive him, I haven’t either. He’s still prickly like he used to be. But feeding into the hatred will put us right back where we started. It’s not right to treat him poorly. We’re all just kids who got sucked into this war.”
“You know what Malfoy—” Potter starts.
Blaise just
“That’s the spirit!”
“So, Draco,” she starts, causing Draco’s breath to lodge in his throat, “I’m impressed.”
for beta-ing this chapter! I hope you enjoy it :)
on himself before he reaches for his hat, ready to retaliate.
“Don’t rush, dear, it’ll ruin the effect.”
Draco sits up and turns to Finnigan whose eyes are glued to Pansy’s chest like they’re his lucky pot of gold.
“I can help you if you’d like?” Theo offers.
,” Potter stresses, stepping into his space, “I’m not a savior, the war is over, I’m tired of talking about that—”
Draco watches as a significantly large group of girls bound over to Wood, giggling amongst one another. Of course, with Wood coming back with the reputation as the star player on the Falcons team, he’s bound to attract a bunch of fan girls.
“And may I ask, who ended up being right about that?” Harry challenges, regretting the words as they left his mouth.
“Blaise somehow knows
I don’t care what lovers quarrel you’re having with Potter, you can shove that up your ass. You ditched Greg and never finished your game with him! He currently looks like a kicked crup, and I can’t take that kind of heartbreak Draco!” She yells, loud enough that Draco is positive the entire tower heard her.
“How would you know that, Blaise?” Theo asks, quirking an eyebrow.
“Following me again are you, Potter? So predictable. Well, you’ve caught me, I’m up to a devious plot,” Draco drawls.
Theo doesn’t react much to this, only humming as he moves closer to Draco.
He grin widely, leaning back into his chair and crossing his legs. “I’m in.”
A raucous knock on the door brings Draco back to reality.
“You really think he’d want to help me?” Draco asks incredulously. “Surely, he has other fangirls to help with their homework. And I don’t need it anyway, I’m perfectly capable of handling this on my own.”
“How do I fire you?”
“I suppose I can’t say no to a good show.”
“Oh don’t be such a killjoy, play with us! Tell us who you have and we’ll help you get them out,” Pansy asserts.
“Jar!” Ron calls triumphantly.
“I’m not the only one with a weakness,” Blaise says devilishly.
“No! I—” Potter’s eyes are manic, filled to the brim with anger. He redirects his attention back to Smith with a startling, dark expression. “Smith, you disgust me. Don’t touch him or anyone else again. Next time I won’t let you go as easily. Got it? Get out of here before I hex your bollocks off.”
Draco grins sardonically, clasping his hand firmly. The kids all cheer.
Hermione flushes, grabbing a book and opening it forcefully. “N-no of course not, that’s—anyway! The point is, Harry won’t stop talking about it, on top of how he’s going to get you out of the assassination game, and it’s getting out of hand.” She takes a quick glance around before casting a spell. “Just a silencing charm, relax. But you don’t understand how far he’s taking this. I caught him taking drops of Felix Felicis the other day so he could get out Anthony and then Parvati! And he wouldn’t listen to me when I insisted he didn’t take it, I couldn’t believe it!”
Draco looks at her, completely lost at her meaning. “Hermione, I understood none of what you just said.”
“Coach Malfoy,” he specifies.
Draco can feel Potter’s breath on his face, and he inadvertently shivers at the sensation. He berates himself, wishing his body would not betray itself—not that there’s anything to betray. However, he doesn’t want Potter getting any false ideas. He’s already thick in the head, after all.
Draco shuts out the hauntings of no longer distant cries and desperate pleas of mercy before raising his wand arm up to the empty space in front of him. The firm grip on the wand doesn’t waver as he delicately carves a vertical line next to one almost identical to it, eyes narrowed in concentration, with only a silent whisper of the spell formed by his lips. 217. It’s not quite half yet, but he’ll get there. One day at a time, he breathes.
“Well, that was because of the fancy brooms your Father bought the entire team, but I don't have a reason to put my faith in you,” she says, crossing her arms.
Harry blinks in disbelief as he hears the door shut. Even after everything, Malfoy still has the audacity to be a complete git. He doesn’t know quite what to think of him anymore. Before the events of the war, it was simple. Malfoy was just a snotty, schoolyard bully who sought to make their lives miserable. It was easy to hate him then, when there was no greater evil directly involved. But during the height of the war, Malfoy was as much a victim of Voldemort’s terror as the rest of them. Although he let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts, it was against his will. Harry would never admit this to Ron or Hermione, but if he were given the same options to choose from—bring the Death Eaters in or let Hermione and Ron die—he couldn’t say that his choice would be much different than Malfoy’s.
The presence of darkness is a gift. It provides Draco with a blank canvas to fill with his conceived visions of himself in the Slytherin common room, lounged on the couch by the fire, Pansy and Blaise sitting on either side of him. It allows his mind’s eye to escape to a better place. Someplace vast and open where unrestrained laughter echos through the air.
“Hello Granger, it seems that amongst the chaos your books have fallen victim to Seamus’ brutish endeavors, if I may?” He asks, gesturing to the books with his hand and levitating them back onto her desk when he receives no response.
As Draco is pulling his nightclothes out of his wardrobe, ready to call it an early night, the door of his room is spelled open, slamming against the wall with a loud clatter.
“Really? Then why have you been avoiding me?”
“Susan Bones,” he tells her boredly.
“Awful,” Draco responds, which he knows is not comprehensible. With a grown, he turns over on his side, facing Greg. “Completely and terribly horrible. Worst morning of my entire life.”
Coach Sylvester laughs and settles herself onto the sofa, gazing at Draco intently. “So Draco, I’ve been wanting to ask you something. I figured you’d give me a straight answer.”
“Yes… I’m going to see how Pansy is doing, I’ll see you later.” Draco says, practically running out of the room.
McGonagall clears her throat as she stands in front of him holding the parchment. Draco turns and accepts the parchment doing as she says. Draco stares down at the elegant scrawl of his name, mystified that he will be taking part in an activity so ludicrous. He quickly places the piece of parchment back in the hat without a word, leaning back into the couch with a huff.
“Did I say you could speak over me?”
The players all scramble to fly away, and Draco notices how fast they all move on their brooms. He’s quite impressed. Draco waits eagerly as they all loop around the pitch, heading back in his direction. He smirks, gripping his broom tightly as he dashes away from them. He hears their protests, which makes him smile brighter. Draco zooms past Wood who gives him an odd look, and heads towards the trees.
“Oh please, plenty of people would pay thousands of galleons to get the chance to caress my smooth, luxurious legs. There’s no need to compare mine to yours, Draco, I believe if you wanted to, you too could charge people to touch your alluring calves and earn more than the fortune you currently possess.”
“Then I resent you for at least not letting me in on it so I could watch. You’re cruel.” Pansy crosses her arms and scowls.
“I hate this,” She says despairingly, her cheek resting against his chest.
how he did it? Can’t anyone over the age of twelve do that spell? Draco, don’t blow smoke up my ass.”
“You’re being so terribly dramatic that you’re making Blaise sound like a humble, sensible person,” Draco drawls.
As he begins the incantation, he feels Theo move from his previous spot, his hand sliding to the back of his neck.
Greg, being an even less fan of the mornings than Draco, needed to be woken up by him every morning. If Draco didn't go in there and spray him with Aguamenti or a similar charm, he most likely would never make it to his first class of the day. During their earlier years at Hogwarts, Blaise always handled it as the only morning person, but he refused to this year, claiming, “Draco, I no longer live with him, and it’s time for you to assume the responsibility of dragging the lug out of bed. It’ll help you grow up a bit.” He reluctantly agreed, but it turns out it hasn’t been too much trouble for Draco. In fact, he takes slight pleasure in his creative tactics to wake Greg from his deep slumber.
Draco stiffens. “I don’t need your help.”
Her expression loosens slightly, and the corner of her mouth curves up. “Great. So, about the Charms essay…”
“Jealous he’s taking away from your sexy time with the Weasel?” Draco prods, arching an eyebrow.
Draco quietly snickers to himself, knowing how incredibly wrong Granger is about that assessment.
Weasley and Potter both scowl at Blaise before taking their seats on the other end of the table, grumbling lowly to one another.
“Well, I’d say your assessment of Granger’s intellect is accurate, but I’ve come to realize that there will always be exceptions.”
After stalling as much as possible in the Great Hall—chewing his food slower than a flobberworm according to Pansy—Draco reluctantly heads over to Coach Sylvester’s office, anticipating his potential demise. Summoning him to meet her alone is a terrible sign, so he is not particularly ecstatic for this meeting.
Coach Sylvester ignores her and faces Draco, “I underestimated you Draco, I like your style. Don’t tell anyone I said this, but you remind me of a young, ambitious Sue Sylvester who stepped over everyone in her path in order to climb to the top. Keep it up,” She says proudly, “Now, I have to go corral a bunch of bratty first year Piffindorps or whatever their house is called and make sure none of them fall off their brooms.”
Potter furrows his brows, looking ready to argue but is cut off as Draco’s group dashes over to them.
Draco makes a low noise of agreement as Pansy laughs sardonically.
Ginny herself hasn’t pushed for anything to happen after the kiss in the common room. He can’t tell if she can tell how he’s feeling and she’s waiting for him to take initiative, or if she feels the same way as him. Harry hopes it’s the latter.
Theo sighs, “Just, please, think about it?”
“Shut it, Panties,” he spits. He’s only just met his little group of aspiring seekers, but he feels a bit protective of them now.
,” Potter taunts, speaking with an irritatingly whiny voice at the end.
I was saving.”
“I don’t know the prat’s entire class
“Well, not many people can handle hearing me speak low of the person who defeated the most dangerous Wizard of all time.”
“Either way, you’re a right pain in my arse,” Draco grumbles.
Draco doesn’t need to look at her to know she’s smirking. He almost—almost—gasps in shock, but he refrains at the awareness that Smith himself is sitting at a table near the couch, laughing boisterously with Fletchley.
“Save the act. I know you want to help me get him out,” She says firmly.
Hermione doesn't say anything for a moment, giving him a heavy look. “Well, he just wants to win, so I don’t see that being the motive,” she says.
Harry looks away. “I know,” he says quietly. Malfoy explained everything that occurred in Malfoy Manor when Voldemort first moved in. It was disturbing, and despite the horrors Harry went through himself, he shivers at the thought of having to stay in the same house of emotionally unstable maniacs for any period of time. Harry doesn’t think anyone deserved to go through something like that, even Malfoy.
He’s always loved Ginny, but his feelings now lack the intensity they once had.
“Potter, tell me why you’re stalking me. Again, I should add. I’m quite familiar with this behavior.”
The common room remained silent for a moment before conversation broke out, the loud buzz filling the room. Draco quickly sets the hat on the floor and examines the strange object in his hands. It’s small, bright green, and has a tiny lever, one that looks like could be pulled back by a fing—
“Uh, nothing I just…”
“I just thought we could go study in the Library together,” Theo says, without explicitly rejecting the idea.
“I get he killed the Dark Lord, who seemed alright, but that was a while ago. Why do people still talk about him? They always stare at him and try to do things for him. But it’s not like Potter wanted to kill him, right?”
Draco attempts to tug his hand away, to no avail. “Impressive. It seems your seeker skills haven’t abandoned you since the last time we played, lucky you. Now, if you couldn’t already tell, you bespectacled git, I am not a snitch, so if you could get your grubby hand off my wrist, that would be grand. I don’t want to catch your Gryffindor germs.”
Draco snaps his head up, gazing at Pansy sharply. “Pansy, you have a free as well, yes? I could help you with Potions too as we both know you struggle with it.”
“Still can’t bloody believe Coach Sylvester picked Malfoy of all people to help with the Quidditch Club. When Ginny told me, I almost dropped my chicken. And I never drop my food,” Ron says, piling sausages onto his plate with vigor.
“Right, and my hair is bright green. Are we all saying things that aren’t true?”
After sipping his coffee in bed for a few minutes, listening to Greg’s soft snores from his bed nearby, Draco makes his way to the bathroom to proceed with his morning routine consisting of skin care and combing his hair. If he’s going to be wearing this hideous accessory all day, then he’s going to at least make sure he looks presentable.
“Alright, but then I get to call you PP.”
After a beat he finally glances down and opens his hand. There, sitting calmly in the center of his palm, is the shiny, circular object in question.
“You guys should do a seeker's match!” The young Hufflepuff girl chimes in, her eyes bulging with excitement as she bounces on her toes. “Also, your hat looks quite silly!” She laughs, and it appears that she has quickly gotten over the Death Eater issue. Isn’t he more intimidating? He’s quite insulted.
Pausing for a moment, he takes in the largely increasing number. 147, he counts. He stares for a second longer to absorb the detailed petals of the gold and scarlet hollyhocks that grace the surface before adding a new addition to the collection. Even the designs of his room took part in the molding of his whole identity; the flower representing ambition. If Draco had any ounce of that trait within him to begin with, nothing remains now.
He trusts Hermione’s judgement, so he won’t directly intervene. However, he can’t shake the feeling that Malfoy is trying to take advantage of her. It doesn’t hurt to see what Malfoy has been up to lately. The map and invisibility cloak folded in the bottom of his trunk come to mind.
“Can we do it again? Mister…” A Ravenclaw girl says.
After the grumbling settles down, McGonagall continues, “In addition, you may not steal or magically summon another person’s hat. That will also result in a detention and removal from the game. Understood?”
“He was running away like he saw a dementor, and I sent him a tripping jinx so Pansy could squirt him. Pretty simple.” Draco shrugs.
Draco swallows uncomfortably, bracing himself for her potentially negative reaction. “Well, he gave my father a mission and he failed to complete it. At the time, I didn’t realize it, but the Dark Lord allowed me to become a Death Eater as a punishment to my father. He gave me an impossible task and if I failed, he would kill my mother and I. Ultimately, he was setting me up to… to die,” he chokes out.
Blaise has the audacity to laugh.
Draco turns towards the direction he came from to see Coach Sylvester chasing after him, holding two much larger versions of the muggle weapons the eighth years have been provided with in her hands.
“Alright, we can stalk him around the school I suppose. When should we first attempt this?”
- Seamus got Justin Finch-Fletchley out of the game already, he’s not thrilled about that
“That was an accident! We were making our castle.” Pansy huffs.
“Doesn’t surprise me, Death Eaters can’t—”
“He did? Did he tell you anything else?” Harry asks, leaning forward avidly with that glint in his eye he only ever gets when they’re on the topic of Draco.
“Nice try Blaise, you’re just going to ruin it. I don’t even know who your target is, so why should I tell you mine?” Pansy argues.
- While walking to the kitchens, Theo proposes that Draco goes with him to France after the school year, and to Draco’s surprise, gives him a kiss on the cheek
“Well, excellent job. Now, who can tell me how Miss Sullivan made it there first?” Draco asks the group. Every hand shoots up immediately.
“Well, Susan’s headbands are always quite extravagant so perhaps she doesn’t notice—”
As the book lands in front of her, Granger jolts back into reality and looks up at him, schooling her features into a neutral expression. “Thank you, although I could have quite done that myself,” She says with an overly formal tone, but Draco also caught the gratitude behind her words.
Draco lets out a sound of astonishment. “You’re brilliant.”
Just say Granger, he thinks bitterly.
“Sounds lovely,” Draco says, a twinge of jealousy slipping through his words.
you say? So do
Pansy doesn’t respond for a moment, and just when Draco is about to dismiss it she answers, “He— he had…
“So, which potion are you most struggling with at the moment?” Draco asks.
“Was Potter there?”
Draco sends him a swift stinging hex for that.
Theo pushes on, leaning over the table and lowering his voice. “Draco, you just need to hear me out.”
Hermione snickers into her hand, muffling the sound to avoid getting reprimanded by Madam Pince. Draco smiles, feeling accomplished he made Hermione laugh.
“Ha! Very punny!” A Gryffindor girl shouts.
He stares at her for a moment considering how he should answer. He knows the last thing he should do is lie to her—that would only make matters worse. That means there’s really only one way to go. Slowly, he glances down at his left sleeve concealing his arm. “What side do you think?”
appreciated—”
At some point during the party, Draco had placed himself on Theo’s lap, attempting to make out with him. Theo, being the gentleman he is, gently pushed him away, saying “Trust me, I’d love to, but not while you’re in this state. It wouldn’t be right.”
“Well I’d say it’s best to start by no longer referring to them as Mudbloods.”
“What are my favorite biscuits?” Draco asks, hoping Theo has forgotten the answer.
your target, you never told me.” Pansy asks, wiping her tears away as she turns to look at him, her eyes wide.
“So, you think I’m up to mischief and you’ve decided to follow me? Quite understandable, considering I have proven to be capable of mass murder and misdeeds. But I’d say you’d be better off staying away from me in that case.”
“I have half a mind to take them away from you. Make you run a bit to get some exercise. That bacon isn't going to make you any fitter, Weasley.”
Blaise flushes and looks away, continuing to eat his meal without saying a word.
“Malfoy, stop it!”
“Did someone finally turn Weasley into an actual Weasel?” Draco asks hopefully.
Reina nods vigorously and beams up at him brighter than Pansy when she buys a new purse and shoves it in everyone’s faces. Draco would find Reina’s expression a bit unnerving if she wasn’t a Hufflepuff. “I’ll see you tomorrow!” She says before walking off with a bounce in her step.
“All I know is, I can’t wait for that ferret to embarrass himself in front of the whole school, it’ll be bloody brilliant,” Ron says.
“What am I supposed to do? Back down? Absolutely not, we already shook hands on it. I will beat him,” he says resolutely, though he doesn’t fully believe his own words.
But during this class, he can't resist the urge to look. Even in such a disheveled state with his unruly hair under the pointy hat, his tie severely crooked, Potter is captivating. Draco has no idea why, and it infuriates him. He just wishes Potter would stop being so
“Hardly. Not when all I have to do is shoot air into your hair for you to shriek and run off like Peeves is chasing you with dungbombs.”
“I got you, Draco!” She says victoriously, pinching his nose the way they always do at the end of a tussle, signifying a victory.
“I’m not. It’s true.”
“So, you say the Slytherins have been getting harassed by those Gryffindors? Have you been experiencing this yourself?”
Later that night, while staying at Gryffindor tower, she had kissed him, pouring a whole year of separation into it, clinging to him like she never wanted to lose him again. But it didn't feel quite the same as it once did. There was no excitement, no invigoration pumping through his veins like he remembered.
“As you wish, Savior.”
It infuriates him that Potter thinks he’s so much better than everyone else. That he just allows people to throw themselves at his feet and praise him, feeding his already massive ego.
Theo locks eyes with Draco. “Well, Draco, not everything has to be complicated,” he says, his challenge subtle enough for only Draco to catch.
Hi, I’m back! It’s been a while, but I’ve still been spending a lot of time on this, and there’s a much more content that will be posted soon! A huge thank you to my beta
Coach Sylvester takes a sip of her tea, and turns towards the fire in contemplation.
Coach Sylvester’s booming voice fades as she continues down the corridor, out of sight.
They both know that neither can stand the sight of the other, so why Potter decided to pick Draco with his patronus during class is beyond comprehension. And of course Potter couldn't leave it at that, he couldn’t resist making a remark about the potential form of Draco’s patronus: “What do you think yours will be, Malfoy? I bet it’ll be a ferret.”
“And yet your Gryffindor impulses took over so you could save the day once again, ultimately blowing your cover.” Draco smirks.
Draco quickly glances down both sides of the hallway just in case Millie is lingering nearby and looks back at Reina when he doesn’t see anyone present. “Draco is acceptable off the pitch,” he says, accepting the parchment, “and thank you.”
Draco’s eyes widen for a moment before he narrows them. “Potter, that’s absolutely ridiculous—”
“Well, it’s the treatment she deserves for how magnificent she is. Shame on you for not doing the same!” he cries, aghast.
Draco closes his mouth, scowling pointedly at Pansy, communicating that they will discuss this later. He turns to Greg with a reassuring smile. “Yes, of course.”
His words are cut off as Smith collapses to the ground and Draco is released from his restraints, the ropes falling to the floor. He turns to see who his hero is and—
Before Draco has a chance to move, he thinks he sees a figure move in his periphery, which is gone when he turns his head to look. He swears he caught a glimpse of someone, the cuff of dark trousers. Shaking it off, he follows Theo into the kitchen; He has more urgent matters to attend to.
Potter hesitates, his eyes darting around as if searching for words in the air, and something shifts in his expression. “I… had a feeling that I’m your target. You know, in the game… because I was Smith’s target. I just wanted to make sure, that was all. I’m determined to win, you know.”
“Ah, Malfoy,” Ginny says, turning to Harry with a smirk. “Still butthurt Coach Sylvester picked him over you Harry?” she teases, punching his shoulder a bit too rough, causing him to wince slightly.
Potter’s frown deepens. “No, I’m not jealous, but your warm up for them could have been better.”
“I can when it makes Mum cry and George drink himself to oblivion! It’s clearly not making you feel better when all you’re doing is yelling about it. Enough is enough, we need to move on at some point or we’ll always be stuck in the war,” Ginny had said firmly, putting her foot down.
“Because I have the perfect plan and I want it to be a surprise,” Blaise says mischievously.
“We’re not Hufflepuffs, Draco, we have a sense of self-preservation. Something you seem to be lacking currently,” Blaise says.
Gilderoy Lockhart!”
don’t,” Blaise says under his breath smugly.
“Millie, lovely for you to join us! You’ve just missed Draco being a dramatic pain in our arses.”
Draco raises an eyebrow with a haughty expression. “Wouldn’t you like to know?”
Potter shakes his head, “No, that’s not what I’m saying. You’ve done some horrible things, yeah, but I know that you were coerced into most of that. Voldemort threatened you, just like the rest of us. I don’t think you’re free of guilt from your actions, but you don’t deserve to rot away in a place like that.”
- Meanwhile, Ron is rooting for Harry and Ginny to get back together, but—awkward—Harry doesn’t want to and keeps it to himself
“Alright, have your bloody sickle back,” Ginny concedes, tossing the coin at Ron with enough force that it smacks into his face before he can register it coming.
“Should I ask how you managed that?” Blaise asks warily.
Draco looks away. “Since now.”
“Hmm, I suppose you’re right,” She says playfully, flicking his nose.
They stare at each other for a moment, and every second makes Draco gradually more uncomfortable. He simultaneously wants to step closer towards him, perhaps feel the strength in his arms once more and run as far away from him as possible—it’s a terrible dilemma. Eventually, Draco settles with shoving Potter’s shoulder lightly before storming off to his room. He can hear Potter laughing behind him, and he hates how much he likes the sound of it. That wasn’t meant to be funny, it was supposed to be threatening.
“Excellent job Mr. Potter, thank you! Everyone, please practice this every day if you can! Even if it’s only for five minutes, because every minute counts. Start thinking about your most happy memory! I’ll see you all on Thursday.”
Thanks for reading! Let me know what you think in the comments!
As they all rush onto their brooms, Draco begins making his way over to the chest. Once he gets closer he spots She-Weasley bending over in front of it to grab the quaffles, and she turns at the sound of his footsteps.
Behind him, Hermione makes a stifled noise that Draco chooses to believe is a cough.
“From my blood rituals in the Forbidden Forest, of course. How else?” Draco sniffs, arching an eyebrow. The threat seems to be wearing off, as no one seems nearly as shaken as they used to. He’s both relieved and disappointed. “Who doesn’t have that, Finnigan?”
“No, it was just a tripping hex. And Smith wasn’t my target, so that’s why I was able to do it.”
“It’s not like it was my choice to fight it. And might I remind you that it was
The portrait opens again to reveal Millie who’s repeatedly clenching her fist. She sits on the floor next to Greg.
Draco’s thoughts also occasionally involuntarily drift to the library this morning when Granger stomped in, studying furiously at an empty table near his own. The first week of their return, there were a few instances where the two had been there to study at the same time. However, neither dared to do so at the same table as one another. They both had an unspoken agreement to ignore each other without a single glance, and proceed with their revision.
“Hilarious Draco, I’m rolling on the floor,” Pansy says dryly.
“Would you rather rot at the Manor?”
In the corner of her eye, Hermione sees Harry glance up from his food in interest. He always has the same look on his face whenever Draco is brought up in conversation or he enters the room, which she finds reminiscent of a dog catching sight of a squirrel. She supposes he’s always kind of been this way about Draco, but it's worsened since the start of eighth year. Part of her is a bit concerned, but “I know he’s a bit… shrewd, but he was still a competent seeker, you have to admit it.”
“No, just Draco.”
The pair make their way to the Great Hall, both fashioning their unsightly hats with Slytherin arrogance. Draco tries to blink the sleep from his eyes and adjust to the early morning light passing through the castle windows as they walk through the bright halls.
, Draco notes to himself.
“Yeah, I was flying for a bit at the pitch and on my way back he appeared from behind, but startled and dropped his gun once I turned to look at him. Then I punched him.”
“Come here you big baby! These bad boys are loaded with my sweat and I’m— oh, Draco!” She falters, stopping for a moment to address Draco.
call me that!” She shrieks, shooting a hex towards him that barely misses his head.
Potter’s head snaps back up, curiosity gone with his frown firmly in its place. “Don’t you
“You think I’m daft? If you paid attention for five minutes you’d see how miserable he is with large crowds. Besides, Harry is a horrible liar.”
. I won't leave the others like that. Feel free to do so yourself, but I don't want to just run away.”
Draco simply nods his head yes, fearful of opening his mouth, wanting to keep the monsters inside him from clawing their way out towards her. His mother is the only person left in the world he loves. Not that the numbers were ever very high, before.
“There isn’t one, Harry,” Hermione interjects. “Draco was helping me with something for a moment. It’s alright.”
Ginerva rolls her eyes with an exasperated groan. “Whatever, just don’t fuck this up.”
Draco is shivering in his old quidditch robes as he stands beside Coach Sylvester, currently resenting his entire existence. No person is worth dealing with this kind of weather, it’s unbecoming. Except maybe for Pansy.
Harry closes his eyes, releasing a long breath. He knows she didn’t mean it like that, but sometimes the grief rears its ugly head, and he can’t always contain it. “I know, it’s ok.”
They walk down to the Great Hall together in surprisingly relative silence. Draco didn't think she would be so bothered by what happened, but maybe she’s just desperate for him to stay in the game.
They both laugh breathlessly as they tumble and fall to the floor, wrestling each other like they did as kids back in the fields of the Manor.
“There’s no need. Neither you nor Greg are equipped to attack me at this hour, and I already know Theo doesn’t have me. Even if he did, he doesn’t sound too eager to participate in this game.”
“If you’re insinuating that I talk like that, Potter, then you’re more ridiculous than I thought. That sounded nothing like my voice,” Draco scoffs.
That seems to snap him out of whatever trance he was in, because he blinks furiously, his face flushing slightly. “I— no, uh—” He cuts himself off, pulling his eyes away to scowl down at his food and stab the eggs on his plate.
“So, may I ask how do you fly a broom then?” He asks as the thought pops into his head, puzzled at how she manages it with no magic.
Coach Sylvester stays silent for a moment, considering, before letting out an amused laugh. “Well, that would explain the hordes of girls who follow him around through the corridors like a gaggle of geese.”
Draco’s bravado falters slightly at the dig, but he maintains his composure. “Ah, so you’re here to take over. Well, not everything has your name on it, so how about you run back to your pet Gryffindors and leave me alone. I am coaching just fine.”
Before anyone can ask, she slaps Blaise across the face.
“That was uncalled for, you know how difficult it was to get rid of that putrid smell. That was the worst week of my life. But anyway, I don’t recall such an instance of you—”
“No. When Potter suggested you were up to something and Weasley was insulting you, Granger practically told them where they can shove it. She said it’s not right to treat you so harshly after everything that happened last year, which I actually agree with. She did mention though that she hasn’t forgiven you yet.”
Over the summer, after getting into countless discussions about the events from the previous months, Ginny declared there would be no more speak of it. Everytime a conversation veered towards anything war or Voldemort related, they had to put a sickle into the jar, which was an old watering can Ginny had found in Arthur’s shed. She kept it on the kitchen table and had labeled it “Moldywart Jar,” and Hermione thinks it's the closest she’s seen one of the Weasleys refer to Voldemort’s name.
“Why not?” She asks, exasperated by his refusal.
“As you should be, I don’t spend 40 minutes getting ready in the morning for nothing,” Blaise grins, sliding his hands carefully over his hair.
Draco thinks for a moment, imagining the many instances of bludgers being sent his way that would undoubtedly occur. But part of him misses flying; it reminds him of a more innocent time. One without the worry of death in the back of his mind. Also, he knows Potter will be insulted that he wasn’t chosen to help, which would make this more than worth it.
“Smith—”
The Manor has yet to dissolve the ghosts of the events from months prior. If one pauses long enough in a vacant corridor, they could still feel the once prominent presence of the Dark Lord as he stalked through the dining room, blood-shot eyes piercing through anything they landed on. One could sense the smooth strokes of Nagini’s slender body sweeping the ground, following the man’s gradual, steady stride across the room like a shadow of his inner form. Or the evocation of the familiar chill that travels down along the ridges of one’s spine at the raise of the Dark Lord’s arm, wielding his yew wand, a fatal spell on the tip of his tongue.
Draco fumes, a retort on the tip of his tongue. However, before he gets the chance to tell him off, informing him of how surprising it is Potter can stand considering how enormous his head is, Professor Byron dismisses them.
Draco looks at him suspiciously. He has an idea of where Theo is going with that. “Maybe,” he says.
It’s pointless, Draco knows. He’s been practicing this spell for weeks—even before it was assigned in class. He hardly has any good memories to choose from and he’s never been particularly proficient at Defense. The only reason he passed with high marks in the past years was due to the many incompetent teachers he had. Only Lupin was actually adept at teaching the material, so he actually learned a lot that year. In fifth year, he was fortunate to be one of Umbridge’s favorite students, so he had no difficulties in that class. Unbeknownst to anyone who was not in the Inquisitorial Squad, Draco loathed the rotten woman as much as everyone else in that school. But at the time, he couldn’t resist having some power—as well as lording something over Potter—for once. Perhaps he took things a bit far, but it’s too late to change anything now.
Hermione makes a noise of disappointment and purses her lip in thought. Eventually, her eyes brighten with an idea, and she meets his gaze, giving him a mischievous look Draco’s not sure he likes. “You know who could help you…?”
“I do not!” Pansy squawks defensively. “And no, I don’t have a free.”
“Blimey,” Potter grumbles, clambering to his feet. “I know that was you Malfoy, I’ll be back for you!” Potter calls, running out the Portrait.
Potter just looks at him dumbly, of course, with his mouth open while Weasley’s face scrunches in aggravation.
“Hello, Smith, enjoy Divination? I would assume your grade is suffering if you couldn’t see this coming in your future.” Draco drawls.
Hi guys!! It’s been a while, I know. I started school last month so I haven’t had much time to edit or write because of homework (boo), but yay new update!! I hope you guys like this chapter and let me know what you think in the comments, they’re amazing and very helpful! Thank you to
Greg steps into the room cautiously as if expecting something to jump out at him. He scans the room and once he seems to decide he is not in danger, he nods and walks past Draco towards his bed, resting his back against the headboard.
Whether the Aurors did this out of twisted humor or just by mere coincidence, Draco would never know. However, what he does know is that he can hardly do more than conjure a light or summon objects—and that’s after at least several attempts. If this was done to make Draco feel just as powerless as before, then the Aurors have proven successful.
Draco nods solemnly in understanding. “True, and in all honesty, I think I haven’t taken you all into consideration either, so I apologize for that. I’ve been reevaluating everything around me the past few months. I’m… getting there.”
“Yes you’re right, my Transfiguration textbook. I’ll see you in class,” Draco says, leaping out of his seat.
“Hello to you too, Hermione. What are you talking about?”
“Because most children are not spooked by merely the sound of a book slamming shut.”
“Draco shut up before I hex you,” Pansy spits in a furious whisper, ”And this time, I won’t grow your eyebrows back.”
“Yes, but when it comes to you, any bit of common sense he has is thrown out the window. Nothing I say will convince him to let this go.”
“That’s Barmy!” Ron had cried. “You can’t just control what we’re allowed to talk about.”
Blaise lifts his wand towards Draco’s head, and he dodges out of the way, using Theo as a human shield before it can reach him. Theo stiffens at the touch, and Draco can hear his breath hitch faintly.
“Because… it’s Malfoy. When has he ever done anything with good intentions? What if he’s trying to improve his reputation? He’s a Slytherin, so of course he’s going to try clawing his way back up, and next thing you know he’ll be a Ministry aristocrat like his father bossing everyone around like when he was—”
Before starting Hogwarts this summer, he thoroughly considered composing letters consisting of cordial, sincere apologies for those he had harmed in some way. What ultimately stopped him was the realization that none of them would have been very receptive of his words while the wounds were so fresh. The only thought that would course through their heads while reading the letters would be
However, Draco must resist participating in this game at all costs for the sake of his future.
“Fruitlessly practicing my patronus,” Draco grunts.
Draco keeps his face neutral, not revealing any emotions. “Isn’t what?”
,” Draco grumbles.
“No, I say that as a reasonable person who prefers to get the proper amount of sleep. I’d like to be fully awake for my classes, thank you. And my knickers are
“I do.”
“Yes, and it seems the situation has not changed much since then, has it?”
“Don’t worry about it, Pans,” Draco says gently, not wanting to stress her out.
“What is your name?”
Draco stops and slowly drops his arms beside him, gazing into the stunning, light blue eyes that just don’t seem quite right. They’re soft, comforting. Like the sky on a clear day. When the bees buzz about and children play merrily until nightfall.
Draco shakes his head fondly and laughs, “You’ve never needed an excuse to do that before.”
At that moment, Theo appears from the door to their shared bathroom. He frowns in confusion at the sight of Pansy, “What’s the matter Pans? Did you lose an earring?” He asks innocently.
“Oh Pansy, you’re just jealous of my undeniable beauty,” Draco grins.
“Understand what?” Potter growls, taking a step towards him. “Being ostracized by the entire wizarding world? Having people stare at you constantly, harass you? Try half of my time at this bloody school. Second year? I was the Heir of Slytherin, summoning a Basilisk to attack muggleborns. Fourth year? I was a fraud, and I put my own name in the Goblet as a way to gain glory and even more fame. Which you so happened to be a part of when you slandered me in the Daily Prophet. Fifth year? I was considered a lunatic for claiming Voldemort—Don’t you dare flinch at the name—returned. Oh, and I recall that you were part of that too, serving as Umbridge’s little pet in her Inquisitorial Squad from hell. So, no, bully me for not having much sympathy for you.”
Greg has always been more intuitive and observant than most people ever give him credit for; he just mostly kept his thoughts to himself or occasionally, shared with Draco. But that's a secret Draco isn’t willing to give up, and perhaps Greg is better off appearing completely ignorant of his surroundings. Draco doesn’t doubt Greg’s placement into Slytherin despite the differing opinions of others. Though he may lack intelligence, Greg chooses to associate with those who can make up for his weaknesses. And that’s a true Slytherin if Draco has ever seen one.
“Tell Greg I said good morning and that he needs to brush his teeth before class,” Pansy calls.
“Let him have some fun, don’t you think he deserves it?”
“Draco!” Pansy shouts when he approaches her, sitting up in her seat. “I was wondering where you were. I need you to help me pick out a new pair of boots. I can’t decide between the suede, over-the-knees or the leather booties.”
“Good. So, here are your weapons and your—you call these hats Minerva?—hats. And if I see any of you sissies wearing those godawful things and cause my eyes to bleed, I won’t hesitate to make fun of you. I might even throw pumpkin juice in your face. Who knows. Depends on if one of my first years falls off their broom that day,” She says, walking back to grab her bags in front of the fireplace.
“Then I’ll call you PP, how would you like that!”
“You’ve never managed to beat him, so why should I believe that you will this time?”
Draco ignores Blaise’s sound of annoyance as he unfolds the parchment to read it.
“Yes, but if he comes back in here and hexes you, we’re not stopping him,” Pansy says, now sitting up properly and engaged with the conversation once again.
Pansy pouts, leaning back with her arms crossed, “Well, then I’m not going to tell you who I have.” She says defiantly, but Draco isn’t falling for it.
Greg frowns. “But how?”
Blaise clears his throat, looking terrified. “Yes, of course.”
Pansy scoffs. “I’m insulted that you think I’m daft enough to believe that excuse. What did Potter do? Did he push your shiny buttons a bit too hard?”
But when he saw her again, blood-stained and exhausted, there was no feeling of utter relief like he had imagined. He thought once he reunited with her, he would feel like a starving man finally receiving a warm meal. Instead he stood before her in Great Hall, the life drained from both of them, and he didn't feel remotely sated.
Draco wants to scream and call for someone to rescue him, but he knows no one in their right mind would want to help him. A small part of him feels like he almost deserves this.
Draco almost frowns, confused as to when Potter even left the table. He was just here eating a minute ago. How did he manage to do that so quickly and without notice?
” A familiar, irritating voice reprimands as he and the rest of the group fly back to the ground.
“You’re not helping, child,” Draco says, but the girl simply giggles with her Ravenclaw friend.
“Meet me in my office tomorrow night after dinner, I need to talk to you.”
“Did you use dark arts? Learned something from your Death Eater Father—”
Draco blinks, unsure of how to respond to that. He simply nods, which seems to satisfy her, because she walks off without another word. Once Coach Sylvester is out of sight, Draco turns to Pansy who is trembling slightly, eyes glued to the floor in shock.
Draco mumbles back a hello, muffled by the pillow pressed against his face.
“There’s a book I need. I’m going to get it now,” He croaks, scrambling out of his seat towards the book stacks before Theo can respond. He almost jumps when he spots Granger staring at him questioningly from a nearby table, his heart picking up speed. Draco could swear that he didn’t see her there when he first arrived. But as he studies her face, he concludes she must have been listening to their conversation, being as nosy as ever.
Draco grins, accepting the cup gladly. “Well, cheers to that.”
“Since when have you been a legilimens?” Draco pokes playfully, and Theo sends him an intense expression that he can’t decipher. He’s been doing that a lot recently, actually. Draco turns away uncomfortably, choosing to look out the long window of the corridor instead.
Draco’s inner mantra is broken as Ravenclaw Patil barrels past him, moving so fast she knocks a book off Granger’s table, slamming to the floor with a loud
“Do you… regret anything?” Hermione asks.
Draco hardly takes in a single word coming out of Potter’s mouth, because his eyes have decided to overtake his other senses and focus solely on Potter’s face. For some reason, his eyes insist on taking in every feature in display; the curve of his lips that move around as speaks and spread to reveal his stupidly brilliant teeth, his inquiring, raised eyebrows that appear above his glasses when a student asks him a question, the occasional unconscious wrinkle of his nose when his glasses begin to slip, even his untamable hair that frequently falls down, covering his forehead and concealing his one-of-a-kind blemish that he’s sure every girl of wizard-kind would avada kedavra someone for the chance to kiss.
“That’s fine, Greg, most people can’t produce one until their late twenties. I don’t understand how we are expected to produce one
“Ah, Potter. Come to finish what he’s started?”
“Well, you are risking your last remaining brain cell, Weasley, be careful, otherwise there will be none left for Potter to use,” Draco sneers, watching victoriously as Potter’s face turns indignant, “As for my hair, at least it’s in impeccable condition, unlike your bird’s nest, Potter. And Weaselby, your ginger hair clashes harshly with the four house colors. You look like a christmas tree gone wrong.”
Ever since the encounter at the kitchens, Theo has been trying to get the two of them alone. As much as Draco normally enjoys Theo’s company, he doesn’t want to be pestered about leaving Britain with him. He contemplated the offer thoroughly, and he can’t leave Pansy or his mother behind in good conscience. Draco knows they would both refuse to come, insisting they would appear weak to the rest of Wizarding Britain. Both of them have been working to rebuild their social statuses, so fleeing is not an option for either of them. They would never forgive Draco for going without them. A part of him may also be afraid of Theo making another move on him, which could be detrimental to his studies if it escalates past a kiss on the cheek.
“Adopt a Hufflepuff, Draco? Such kind charity work,” Pansy cooes mockingly.
“I thought Harry was going to be here…” A small, Gryffindor boy says disappointedly.
Pansy rolls her eyes. “Yes, excellent reason. Well, this will not be my problem. If you lose and decide to pout indefinitely, I will not be there to coddle you. Since Greg believes so highly in you, you will become his problem. Enjoy Greg, and as a tip, the more chocolate you feed him, the less he will whine, though not by much.”
“Even in the dead of night, when you least expect it. You’ll be laying in your warm bed, cozy and defenseless, cuddling with your precious teddy bear that your parents gave you when you were a year old, the one that comforts you after a nightmare when BAM!”
“I hate this.”
“Yes Professor,” He replies, returning to his spot on the couch compliantly.
“I don’t believe you, insufferable prat.” She says, with no heat behind the words, but doesn’t push the issue. She simply lays beside him and strokes his hair soothingly.
Immediately after crossing through the doors, Draco snatches the hat off to card his fingers through his hair, trying meagerly to style it slightly. As they approach the eighth year table, Draco feels Potter’s gaze on him. Draco sends him an icy glare that goes unnoticed as Potter’s eyes are glued to his hair.
Hermione takes a breath before speaking again. “Look, the war is over now, Harry. There is no evil dark lord forcing people to do his dirty work. If Draco has decided to turn a new leaf, then I’m not going to scrutinize him for it. We can’t act suspicious of him forever, otherwise we’re never giving him the chance to change,” Hermione pauses, “And… it’s hard to stay so resentful towards him. Hearing his experience at the trial I—” Hermione chokes back a sob.
Greg swallows, not looking at Draco. “Blood.”
“Aww, Mommy’s boy!”
“I see. Well, everyone seems to be tight-lipped about the pandemonium he caused, and I was hoping you wouldn’t be. I can’t handle talking to a bunch of wusses.”
“You will not be getting this back until tomorrow!” Madam Pince declares, holding up the water gun. “Now, off with you!” She dismisses with a huff, stomping back to her desk.
“Ah, of course it was about me. Those two couldn’t keep my name out of their mouths if you threatened to banish them to Antarctica.”
Draco muffles a chuckle into his tea cup, amused at the image. Perhaps he should make that a reality. He knows Greg and Blaise would be on board, maybe even Pansy if he nags her enough. “Yes, he’s quite the celebrity now after killing the most powerful dark wizard of all time, twice. And he did it with only a disarming charm, nothing quite extravagant to warrant that amount of attention but...”
Draco looks down at the ground to hide the faint blush on his cheeks, “Don’t flatter me, Theo.”
Ginerva falters slightly, but schools her features into a scowl. “Shove off,” she says before flying over to the nosy prat.
Draco doesn’t know what possesses him to do so, but he reaches up and flicks Potter’s scar, most of which is somehow unobscured by the monstrous hat on his head. Of course Potter can’t manage to wear a hat correctly. Draco should expect nothing less from him, but Potter somehow manages to reach new levels of stupid every day.
“Yes, I’m aware he’s still suspicious of me.”
“He is right though,” Harry continues, ignoring Ron’s scandalized look. “Sorry, Ginny.”
Hermione flushes, avoiding Ginny’s smug look. She thinks it's best she leaves now before this conversation escalates. “Um, I’m going to head to the library, I’ll see you two in class. Bye Ginny,” she says, giving Ron a quick peck before dashing out of the Great Hall.
Theo frowns, considering, “So… how’s that cheating?”
“What’s in the letter, Draco?” Blaise asks, reprising his place against the doorframe of the bathroom.
Theo glances at Draco quickly before looking past him towards the wall, swallowing intently.
This gives Hermione an idea. No matter how much she badgers Draco about seeking help from Harry, he refuses to do it. She’ll never admit this to Draco, but she knows Harry has a better chance of winning the match than he does. Perhaps if she pushes just a bit, things can work out for the both of them. “Oh, that’s right, he did happen to mention that last I saw him in the Library.”
Draco flashes her a disgruntled look. “Yes, it’s going about as good as a Giant trying to break into Gringotts.”
“Bloody hell, Ginny! I need that arm, you know.”
“Fine, let’s get on it then. My dorm, now.” He says definitively, until his plan is rudely interrupted by McGonagall who he forgot is still standing there.
Draco crosses his arms, frowning down at his bed. “...because he’s a bespectacled, undignified git. With a bird’s nest as hair,” he says weakly.
They fall into a comfortable silence after that, Draco pulling out his Herbology textbook to read. However, the few, peaceful minutes are soon shattered by the loud clatter of the bathroom door swinging open, a signature motion of one specific person.
cheated in) while sitting in front of the common room fire, and knowing smiles across the table at dinner during Blaise’s many vainglorious rambles about his appearance.
“Come on!! Then we can see who the better seeker really is!
Draco smiles tiredly. “Greg, I’ve never been more thrilled over the idea of steak and kidney pie in my life.”
“Yeah, I’m sure that’s what he’s made you believe,” he drawls.
“You know,” Draco starts, smirking, “I’ve already chosen the memory that would consistently conjure a patronus. I simply have to imagine you’ve finally unburdened me with your presence and fucked off to the middle of the ocean where you’re never to be seen again.”
Draco breathes, bracing himself. “I want to go, I truly do, but I can’t.”
Draco could easily fall for Theo if he allowed himself to, because honestly, who wouldn't? Theo is wealthy and bright, with a witty and charming personality. He’s tall, with broad shoulders and soft, sandy hair with curls that fall over his forehead. Theo is everything a person could want in a boyfriend. His smile fills Draco with butterflies, swarming through his entire stomach. His touch sends shivers down his spine. And his voice is like warm honey sliding down Draco’s throat.
“Now,” Theo starts, moving to the side, keeping one firm hand on his shoulder, “think of your memory, focus, and cast.”
“Wait,
Draco snorts. “Hardly, he doesn’t have the legs for it. Not like I do.”
Draco panics, his cheeks flushing. “No I don't think that's necessary—”
“You never play this game with me when I ask! I thought you just didn’t like this game anymore.” Blaise plops himself beside Draco, leaning his elbow on his shoulder.
“No. They wouldn’t want to hear what I have to say. Neither of them.”
Draco nods slowly. “Um, yes of course. So...  you don’t hate me now? Want to punch my lights out?”
Draco envisions Theo in his mind, his lips on his own. Draco’s fingers carding through his soft, sandy hair, taking in the sight of his comforting eyes. He casts, the words coming out as a whisper, and opens his eyes.
Draco holds her gaze for a few seconds. “I don’t. But I don't think I’m ready to consort with Muggles yet either. This is a lot for me, you know.”
The next 94 days are spent resolutely scouring the library for texts that will help him form a plan. Draco does not want to dive straight into this and improvise; he may be a lot of things—a Death Eater for one—but he is no Gryffindor. He has dedicated almost every hour of every day into constructing the most flawless, elaborate plan conceivable in order to prevent Voldemort from coming back to life. His mind whirled of endless possibilities that could occur due to potential actions; he wants to prepare for any and all scenarios so that no curveballs can be thrown his way. Draco knows how risky this plan is, but he officially has nothing to lose at this point, because the worst has already happened.
“But he could have just taken advantage of the situation.”
“Don’t you worry, Draco, I’ll make sure everything gets resolved. Nothing will get in my way, because the Slytherins don’t deserve this kind of treatment. The tide is already pulling in, and the fierce tsunami of Sue Sylvester cannot be obstructed. It will destroy everything in its path, and these foul cretins will not survive it,” Coach Sylvester declares.
“Where’s your hat?”
“I figure you’ll ask anyway regardless of my answer.”
As Pansy laughs at Blaise’s stupidity, Draco looks up to see Weasley walking in, covering the eye Draco presumes was socked by Millie’s fist just a few minutes ago. He walks up to Hermione, his face scrunched up in pain.
Draco would too if he was in a room full of Gryffindors.
If Draco wasn’t completely bent, he would also find her quite attractive. It baffles him that she has affections for the Weasel. He is one lucky tosser.
“Mr. Malfoy, I am sure you have more dire matters to attend to, but I am not quite finished if you could please take your seat for a few more minutes,” she says,
“Dracula? Ah yes, I like that one. Coach Sylvester is a genius for coming up with that,” Blaise says reverently.
Draco groans, but doesn’t fight the smile that widens. “Merlin’s beard, you’re such a nuisance.”
A small group approaches Draco reluctantly, all of them avoiding his gaze. He tries his best to keep a pleasant expression, but he knows it’s futile. If anything, a smile from a former Death Eater would only be more terrifying to them.
Draco stands frozen in place, feeling properly chastised despite not being the intended audience. He realizes the true value of McGonagall’s warning—do this at your own risk—and he’s more glad than ever that he has not dismissed her suggestion.
He quickly hides in the nearest section, trying to regain his breathing as his chest tightens. Too much is happening at once, and his mind is spinning out of control. He closes his eyes, but rising flames engulf his sight. He quickly opens them, focusing on the books in front of him and taking deep, slow breaths to calm his heart beat.
Although Draco has been questioning his entire perspective of Muggle-borns lately, he doesn’t want to impose a crisis on Greg just yet. He decides it’s best to play it safe by relaying his previously held beliefs.
A few tense minutes later, they hear the opening of the latch, and students start climbing down the ladder one by one.
Harry just shakes his head and continues his breakfast.
” Draco calls back, mocking her irritating, whiny tone.
The edge of her lip curls up the tiniest bit, which he takes as her agreement.
“So, I got Bones out of the game,” Theo says shyly. “Without any help,” he specifies, turning to Blaise with a pointed look.
Blaise launches at her, tickling her ribcage and neck. Pansy’s screams are muffled by her laughter.
“He only completely humiliated me in front of the children! Stomping over to challenge me to a Seeker’s match.”
While formulating his plan, Draco recalls the information he overhead his father discuss with the residual Death Eaters during his fourth year about the Dark Lord’s return. Eventually, he determines that his main objectives are to prevent Potter from going to the graveyard and to expose Barty Crouch Jr. as Mad-Eye Moody’s impersonator.
“I am! But if it was going to happen, I might as well have gotten the opportunity to watch.”
Hermione rolls her eyes. “Yes, but personally I think it’s unwise of them to offer him a job without proving he has the official qualifications. It’s not fair, firstly, and he’ll be behind all the other Aurors who have been properly educated. I know defeating Voldemort sounds impressive, but I don’t think that alone means he’ll be a competent Auror. There are rules and skills involved that he definitely didn’t know during the war.”
“Now, this year our goal is to promote inter-house unity in order to create a more positive and inclusive environment for the students at Hogwarts. Over the years, we have failed to recognize the vast division between the different houses, and I am here to reestablish friendly competition among all the students. As the oldest at the school, you are all expected to participate in this campaign, both in and out of the classroom. If, for example, you’re a Ravenclaw and see that a younger Slytherin classmate has dropped all their books, I expect you to lend them your help.”
Someone stop him! They’re going to crash!”
“What is he
“Well, you deserved it!” He calls, casting a silent Expelliarmus before she can continue her barrage of hexes. In response, Pansy crosses her arms with a huff and glares at him. Sometimes, he finds that Pansy looks no different than she did as the spoiled, petulant child she once was. It’s both adorable and nauseating.
“Oh, shut up,” Draco says, but there’s no heat behind his words.
Draco can’t help smirking. “Well, he should listen to you, you’re his best friend aren’t you?”
“Yes, that’s it…”
Draco gasps, scandalized by the accusation. “That’s low of you—”
“Ow! What was that for?” Potter gripes, rubbing his forehead.
Over the course of 42 non-consecutive days, Draco had memorized every fact about the crafting of wands. His old wand, 10" long, made of hawthorn wood, with a unicorn hair core, represented contradicting nature along with faithfulness. The new wand set with various limitations was 12 ¾ inches long, made of ebony, and had a phoenix core. Ebony’s compatibility lay within courageous, strong-minded individuals, and when mixed with the phoenix’s adamant independence and judiciousness with its chosen owner, it proves to be an exceptional match. In other words, it was, quite frankly, the worst combination for Draco to use as a tool for his magic.
Draco chuckles and places himself onto the bench across from Pansy feeling quite smug. If just the sight of his bed head is enough to disorient Potter that much, then he should wear his hair like this everyday.
“Oh, like I couldn't have handled it without them?” Draco says, attempting to ease the tension. “You underestimate my outstanding dueling skills, Pansy.”
. But that would only be on the rare occasion that she isn’t being an absolute pain in his rear.
“And why is that something I should know?”
He agreed to it only because she praised him over his quick reflexes, and it wouldn’t hurt to rub this in Potter’s face.
A knock startles Draco out of his thoughts. “Who is it?”
He ignores Potter’s childish remark, instead arching a haughty brow and taking a step closer to him as an intimidation tactic. “Perhaps it’s just that scar of yours infecting your brain, making you act completely mental.”
The paintings of ancestors that previously fashioned the Manor’s towering enclosures are gone, leaving only barriers that make up the maze of his prison. Draco gives his thanks to any potential omnipotent beings above that he was not given the same fate as his father, but he cannot ignore the cold ache that seeps into every one of his bones as he crosses the floors once touched by the balms of his worst nightmare.
you come in here and disrupt the students studying in my library! I told Minerva not to allow students to participate in this crude excuse of a game, but she refused to budge from her inter-house unity nonsense. Both of you, OUT, or I will make you dust off every corner of this library until you can no longer feel any of your fingers, understood?”
Despite the countless hexes and threats he sent him, Smith never seemed to get the hint that Draco wasn’t interested; nasty, stubby, dirty-blonde Hufflepuffs aren’t his type. Smith could get kissed by a dementor for all he cares, and Pansy shares the same sentiment.
“Like what you see, Potter? Are my eyes that captivating?” Draco smirks.
“Ok, enough of your vanity. Theo, where’s your hat?” Pansy asks.
“What a charming best friend you are,” Draco drawls.
Draco looks back to Theo and raises his eyebrows in a manner that communicates,
“I’m not speaking to you.” Draco glowers, looking resolutely down at his plate, still not feeling much of an appetite.
Draco sighs, “I know.”
“I doubt it was that simple,” Draco says.
“Alright, you wimpy British geeks, listen up,” Coach Sylvester barks as she stomps up next to McGonagall. She faces them all with a fierceness that Draco feels heavily resembles Snape’s look of contempt. The thought of his late favorite professor puts a pit in his stomach.
Pansy pales, scooting away from him. “No… no don't you
“Don’t know, mate. I think he was just born that way. I bet when he came out of his mum, he sneered at the healer who delivered him,” Ron jeers.
“Well, then I’m glad you showed up when you did,” Pansy says in relief, still looking quite shaken by the encounter.
Potter huffs a laugh, completely full of himself. “No need, the satisfaction of getting you out will be more than enough reward.”
“It amuses me that you assume I’m powerful enough to break the magic involved. Although, it doesn’t quite surprise me that you think so. You didn't even believe your best friend when he said he didn’t place his name in the Goblet of Fire back in fourth year. You just lack the common sense you
“Ah look what we have here. This is the moment that separates the imbeciles from the losers,” She turns to Weasley, “Carrot head, you look like you’ve sprouted from the ground, ready to get picked and eaten by a group of vegans. Potter, you look like a hairball that’s too big to fit in the trash bin. And Finnigan, you just look more like a gnome than you already do.”
“If I’m being honest, I wasn't even planning on doing it, but then today she walked right in front of me without her hat on. I had my muggle water-shooting contraption with me, because Blaise never allows me to leave our dorm without it, so I couldn’t resist. All I did was shoot her from behind,” Theo says.
“I feel like you’ve been avoiding me,” Theo says calmly.
“No,” Draco says, looking away, fervently studying the glass of the window.
Today’s package includes a Lonicera periclymenum, which has always been Draco’s favorite. As a child, he would pick these from the garden and suck the sweet nectar out of them when his parents weren’t looking. Pansy taught him this, of course. He would never think to play in dirt on his own.
“... A Peacock quill you didn’t want.”
The boy gulps, looking more nervous now that he has been directly addressed. “I mean… he was the first player in a
Draco scoffs lightly. “How considerate of you,” he deadpans.
Coach Sylvester leans back into the coach and smirks. “I knew you’d see it my way,” she says proudly.
“I don't know how one could go about forgetting such a thing. It’s horrendous. It flattens my hair out so horribly that I have to spend extra time fixing it every night. I feel like I’m becoming Blaise and Draco!” She cries in dismay.
“Are you out of your mind? Set me down!” Draco demands, kicking his legs and hitting Potter’s arms in protest—which are much more firm than he expected.
“Who cares what she says. Also their assessment wouldn’t necessarily be incorrect—“
“I figured you’d be thankful I took that off your hands after you begged me to.”
Theo scoffs disbelievingly, “That’s like saying Potter actually put his name into the Goblet of Fire for the Triwizard Tournament…”
“I suppose you have a point. Well, I have no qualms over speaking ill of Potter. In fact, I thoroughly encourage it,” Draco says, smirking.
“I— yeah, but I still want to know.”
As he passes the table containing the irritating trio, he catches part of their conversation, which is not transpiring even remotely quietly.
The boy hesitates slightly before answering, clearly not deterred by Draco’s expression. “Well… he did beat you in every match…” he trails off, looking down at the grass.
“I know
“And yet, who ended up receiving an invite to tea?” Draco smugly points out with a raised eyebrow.
“Yes, I’ll make sure to do that, but it may take four to five business days. And I’ll need payment for shipping,” Pansy says.
Ron suddenly looks up, his eyes widening in disbelief as a thought seems to pop into his mind, “Hey, wait a minute, why are you taking his side in this? Did you somehow forget that he caused—”
Greg grunts in response and moves toward his bed to lounge on it.
“Now that we’ve reviewed the material from the previous school year, we’re going to start practicing the Patronus charm,” He announces. “I am aware that this is not normally taught at NEWT level, however I believe it to be an imperative skill for each of you to know. By the end of this term, if not, the end of the year, all of you will be able to successfully cast one.”
“Anyway,” she says softly, shaking herself out of her thoughts and looking back at Draco with sadness behind her eyes. “I want to start a Quidditch club that’s separate from the teams where we run drills and teach the kids how to play the game. Those Purebloods get an unfair advantage over the Muggleborns by getting to learn at a young age, so they’re more likely to make the team. Plus, those who don’t make it never get the chance to play. It’ll make the Quidditch jocks less smug.”
“Draco,” Theo says fondly, placing a gentle hand on his arm, which drains all the irritation out of his system.
“Really?” He asks, gobsmacked. He figured she invited him here to tell him she’d be replacing him with Potter.
Draco retreats to his room to grab his books and head to the library for a quick study session before he has to meet Coach Sylvester. As he walks over to his desk, a small piece of parchment slips out of his trouser pocket. He stares at it for a moment loathingly, then casts an incendio without a second thought, not bothering to watch as the ashes drift to the floor. There’s no need for him to read the name on the parchment when he already knows his target. Besides, Draco has seen Harry Potter’s name enough to last him a lifetime.
Draco’s eyes shoot open in panic. “Coach, that is not necessary—”
“Well, I’m going to wake Greg now. I’ll see you all in class,” Draco says abruptly, packing his things and standing from his seat. He turns to Pansy who is giving him a pointed look, seeking an explanation from him. There is nothing he can say that won’t reveal the truth, so he gives her a reassuring smile and quickly walks out of the Great Hall.
have me, don't you! Oh Merlin!”
Draco blinks. “Really?”
A figure appears in front of him, and it’s Zacharias Smith, the second to last person on this planet he wants to see besides Potter.
“—Then what is it you want? The deepest desire in you, what you are deprived of from the She-Weasley—”
It had been just a pair of soft lips locked onto his own.
“Fair,” Draco says. “Anyway, it seems this has been on your mind for a while.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t think for a second you’ll get away with that, Blaise!” Draco shouts, casting a swift
Draco almost chokes on his tea, covering his mouth with his hand. Of all people to help with the Quidditch Club, she wanted him. “I’m flattered, Coach Sylvester, but how does that have anything to do with Potter?”
There are still too many open wounds related to the war, and sometimes they unintentionally push the wrong buttons. Last summer at the Burrow, Harry accidentally mentioned Ron’s absence during the horcrux hunt. Hermione cried, and Ron didn’t speak to him for the rest of the day.
“Well, thanks for that,” he grumbles, rubbing his nose.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I am not obsessed with Potter! You seem to be the one more invested in this than I am. This match is no big deal. We’ll play, I’ll win, he’ll owe me a favor, and all will end well. There’s no need to have a hissy fit about it.”
In the common room, Draco spots Pansy lounging in an armchair in front of the fire, flipping through a fashion magazine.
Draco scoffs at the accusation. What does Blaise know? “Piss off,” he grumbles.
In fact, for a while now Harry has wondered if Dumbledore knew Malfoy was in that predicament all along and chose not to do anything about it. The thought made him realize how similar their situations were in the war; pawns used as a means to an end.
“Well yes,” Draco huffs, “I’m just using it right now as a reference. But don’t say it in public, especially in front of Gryffindors.”
“Ok fine. But now you have to go flying with me.”
“See? Listen to the children. They enjoyed themselves. Now, go tend to your Saviour boyfriend, he looks rather eager to speak with you,” he says, glancing over her shoulder to see a furious looking Potter in the distance. He looks ready to run over and confront them, but Potter would be mistaken, because Draco knows that the girl Weasley is very much capable of taking care of herself, if that bat bogey back in fifth year is anything to go by.
A crooked smile broadens Potter’s face, and Draco absolutely can’t stand the sight of him standing there, looking so gratified in Draco’s mortification. “I’d hope it’s not.”
After the next, only 217 days will remain, although in reality, Draco knows his sentence is truly life-long. He’s aware that nothing will ever be the same again, and it may be for the better, despite it being against his self-interest. The Malfoy name has been tarnished far past the point of restoration. Even the defense of Harry Potter—the now Savior of the Wizarding World—could not manage to gain an ounce of sympathy from those his family had harmed. This was not something Draco failed to anticipate; not after the hundreds of irrevocable breaches created by the brief flashes of green light. Occurrences that never should have taken place.
Finnigan pales. “How the hell do you know about that?”
Draco laughs. “Watch out Pans, Blaise is about to swoop in on the object of your affection, and the two of them will ride off into the sunset.”
“You find this amusing? It’s not like you’re spared from her harassment,
,” Madam Pince interrupts, appearing beside them with her hands placed on her hips in indignation. “I have had quite enough disruption in here for today, stop this at once or I will personally remove you both!”
Ron’s fork clatters onto his plate as he stares at Harry in disbelief. “But he almost bloody well took me out with that poisoned drink. And what about what he did to Katie Bell?”
- Even worse, Pansy finds out her new target is Potter and she doesn’t take it very well
Why you and not me?”
“Have some faith, I didn’t make the team during second year for nothing,” Draco says with a smirk.
“You are mistaken. What I do not have is a problem. What I am experiencing is a catastrophe. A
Madam Sylvester—or Coach Sylvester as she prefers to called—holds her intense stare a beat before walking to the bags she brought with her placed in front of the fireplace.
Draco snorts. “Older students in the other three houses, though mainly from Gryffindor. Just now on the way here, my shoulder got hit with a stinging hex.”
“Always such a delight in the mornings,” Blaise says grabbing Draco’s cheek with a squeeze.
“And I thought
“Pardon? ‘Felix Felicis’ you said?” He asks dumbfoundedly.
“Hermione… what was that?” He asks, keeping his voice level.
Greg’s smile returns—as Draco knew would happen. “Okay.”
“Hey Draco,” Greg greets absently.
“Yes, I’m very much aware of that,” Hermione says wryly.
As Draco opens his mouth to retort, Greg chimes in. “Draco? Are we gonna play?”
As Draco reaches the doors, he delights himself in the sound of Pansy’s screech, which may or may not have been caused by his stinging hex.
“In front of everyone. In the Great Hall. On top of the eighth year table,” Potter adds with a vicious smirk.
Hermione scoffs, mock offended. “Hey, don’t forget that he’s still my best friend,” she says, her lip curling up playfully.
“Bo-ring!” She declares
“Well, that’s my job,” she sniffs.
“Yes, I apologize for the disruption from my hooligan children. I found them in the woods as babies, hungry and helpless. I tried raising them the best I could but they’re simply too wild.”
He continues his new mantra and sets the wand onto his dresser, rubbing his fingers together absently. The wand he possesses is no longer his own. Upon the end of battle, both his and his mother’s wands were hastily confiscated by Aurors, and they refused to return them after their sentencing. The one rolling back and forth on the mahogany wood of the nightstand was given to him the night he returned to the Manor, which was made to only be able to do simple, everyday spells.
However, what truly rattles Draco is the reminder of Potter returning his wand. Potter had arrived at the Manor dressed in his usual ratty muggle attire, looking like he’d rather be anywhere else but at Draco’s doorstep. When Draco got to the door, he thought the Ministry had changed their mind, sending the Savior himself to throw him into Azkaban. Of course they would send precious Potter to have that honor of delivering Draco there himself. But instead, Potter wordlessly held out the hawthorn wand, and when Draco accepted it, he turned away, disappearing down the drive. Draco doesn’t remember how long he stayed there, staring after Potter’s retreating figure, even after he disapparated.
“Come in!” Draco calls, spelling the door unlocked.
Of course, he would want the right to brag that he managed to get a patronus out of a Death Eater, it would only add to his board of achievements—one that he is sure Potter has hung beside his bed. Draco bets it helps him go to sleep every night, looking at all the various plaques marking his successes.
Draco gives her a long look, wishing there was an easy way to explain it all, but he gives it a go. “You see, everyone likes to believe they're open minded simply because they accept Muggles and Muggle-borns, and yet none of them can comprehend the stress we as Slytherins went through during the war. Pansy and Blaise didn’t want any part of the bloodshed, but if you’re Pureblood, you're expected to follow Voldemort or you're considered a Blood Traitor. There was no alternative. No third side. Gryffindors see everything in black and white. I had to do what I needed to for my family, and I didn’t trust our previous Headmaster to get us out of it. So now, our house has been tainted with the image of evil, when that’s simply not true, and they hex us in the halls as if that will satisfy their hunger for vengeance. I may have committed heinous acts, but not everyone in my house has done so. The Greengrasses, for example, fled the country during the peak of the war. Why should they suffer scorn and dirty looks simply for what Hogwarts house they’re associated with?”
“But… but it’s
“Yes, I did and I have to say it was quite impressive. But Malfoy here was not your assassin, it was Pansy, and there’s no rule against another person in the game hexing you. So go cry to your
The spell heads towards Theo who quickly moves out of the way, and it hits the window behind him instead. After a moment he shakes his head, turning towards the group. “That was a close call,” Theo says, keeping his voice even.
“Mr. Potter, I have heard from many others about your proclivity for this particular charm, would you mind coming up here to demonstrate for the class?”
“Yes, I know,” Draco says, sighing as he gets to his feet.
He recalls feeling so enamored by her in sixth year, and how she quickly became the only thought occupying his mind. For those last few, blissful months, all Harry wanted to do was spend every waking moment in her presence, with his hands tangled in her soft hair, taking in her warm, flowery scent. They were the final untainted months he had before everything in his world collapsed as Dumbledore died and the Death Eaters had taken over Hogwarts.
“No,” Potter says firmly.
“Actually, runt, it wasn’t cheating,” Coach Sylvester appears unannounced, “That was called skill, which, unfortunately you seem to lack. It’s not their fault your penguin legs can't do more than waddle a few feet down the corridor. Now get up or you’ll squash the egg you’re carrying between your feet,” She demands impatiently.
Draco stares at him for a moment and before he can help it, lets out an irrepressible, almost maniacal laugh. Potter stands there shifting his footing awkwardly, and Draco knows there must be more to it, but he doesn’t think he’ll be able to get it out of him just yet. “You’ve got to be kidding me, you can’t honestly be taking this game seriously? Oh, but of course you are. The Savior can’t go one moment without trying to steal all the glory and stop the Death Eater from his wrongdoings once again. Well, I’ll have you know that you are indeed my target, and you have no chance of beating me,” Draco says with his most pretentious smirk.
“How was Quidditch?”
… as much of the floor as one can have while in my presence,” Blaise smirks, his tone playful.
Draco takes a deep breath before casting again, still thinking of Theo. In his mind, his hands are weaving too easily through the curls, there’s no bite of his lips, too gentle. He squeezes his eyes harder, telling himself to push, that it’ll work.
“Lovely. Well, so far I can’t produce more than a whisp that’s dimmer than a first year’s lumos.”
Once Blaise puts his wand away, Draco slowly releases his death grip on Theo’s shoulders and moves to stand beside him, crossing his arms, “I hate you.” Draco scowls half-heartedly at Pansy.
“So, now you’re probably wondering why you’re here, and I’m gonna tell you,” She says, her intense gaze locked on his. She pauses for a moment before continuing. “I want you to help me run it.”
Coach Sylvester simply raises her brow, looking at him dubiously. “Okay. And Potter, who I could crush with just my thumb, was the only person able to defeat him?”
“At least I don't have to wear that awful hat anymore,” She says with a flourish, chucking the hat off, landing on the bed with a jingle.
Draco sneers. “That was my intention. And don’t pretend you aren’t already aware of how dramatic you are.”
Draco makes a soft grunt, before letting her gentle fingers lull him to sleep, his final thoughts before losing consciousness remaining on Potter’s stupid face, lit with joviality towards a joke made at his dispense.
“You know, he wasn’t wrong. It’s a bit ridiculous for you to wear the hats in the Great Hall when it’s off limits to strike at your target,” Hermione points out, “And maybe he’s like that because the two of you won’t leave him alone, so he returns the attack in order to stand up for himself?” Hermione offers, looking at them as if they’re five year olds.
Draco can’t help but find that fact quite amusing. “Interesting, that’ll be useful information to know. Please tell me more, does he snore in his sleep as well? Any guilty pleasures?”
“Yeah, the kids wouldn’t shut up about you afterwards.”
Coach Sylvester scoffs. “No, I don’t have the energy for that runt. I just like you better, you’re not a bumbling, smug idiot. The first meeting will take place a couple weeks before tryouts, and I’m planning to postpone those so we have enough time. So, what do you say?”
Draco raises an incredulous eyebrow. “And why is that?”
“Do you ever brush your teeth?” Draco wrinkles his nose pointedly. “Your breath is foul, you great slob. Taking after your friend Hagrid are you?”
Greg considers this for a moment, then nods. “Yeah.”
“What else is there? Have him polish my wand?”
“All we need to do is attack him before he starts to develop the habit of putting his hat on before leaving class. So, we’ll catch him right after his divination class this Friday. It’ll be early enough where he most likely won't have it on as he’s leaving, and we both have a free period during that time,” Pansy explains.
The entire week he’s been practicing but even the pressure of having to show his classmates has not been enough to produce any results. He’s surely doomed.
“Nice! That was much better! Try again.” Theo says, staying in place.
He’s been standing in the middle of his dormitory for over an hour, casting this incantation repeatedly, remaining unsuccessful.
Potter leans in, his eyes fixed on Draco’s. “Don’t call her that. And I don't want anything from you.”
Draco refrains from rolling his eyes. “I’ve tried all those.”
“Because I don’t go around kissing her feet like you do.”
“I’ve been asking myself those same questions at least twice a day for the last seven years, Greg, so unfortunately I have no answer to give you. What I do think, though, is that people most likely feel that they owe him for what he did for them,” Draco sighs. “And though he isn’t as wonderful as people make him sound, be careful of saying that to others. People are looking for any excuse to send us away, and no one trusts Slytherins anymore.”
“Uh… not really. But I’ve also never talked to them… it’s so confusing.”
Coach Sylvester stares at them unimpressed, but otherwise disregards them. “Well, that’s his problem to deal with,” she says, disdainful.
Pansy wraps her arms around herself and looks back down, shaking her head, “I can’t do this, there’s no way. I don’t want to play anymore,” She whimpers, her eyes welling with tears.
He freezes, a flare of panic rising in him at the mention of the Dark Lord. That was the last thing he expected to come out of her mouth. He’s terrified that this conversation could end with his arse getting kicked. Even though he hasn’t known Coach Sylvester for very long, he doesn’t entirely loathe her company. He doesn’t want to get on her bad side, as he suspects she could easily make his life a living hell. He takes a few deep, calming breaths and thinks carefully about his choice of words before he speaks. “He was a merciless, cruel man,” he says coldly. “If you could even call him a man, more a monster. He murdered lots of innocent people and he got what he deserved.”
“Why don’t you come with me?”
He thought perhaps it was because the battle had just ended, and he was too overwhelmed with grief to feel anything else. But then weeks had passed, then months, and he still felt the same subdued affection he had for her before they had dated.
“Are you sure there is no one else you wish to invite, such as the Bloody Baron? Perhaps his company will be more invigorating for you.” Theo says bitterly.
His sleep had been interrupted by one of his incessant dreams about the war. This most recent one, which occurred most often, was of the night the Gryffindor trio came to the Manor. In the version conjured by his subconscious, Draco revealed Harry’s identity, which led to his father summoning the Dark Lord. Upon his immediate arrival, he killed the three of them with no hesitation and fed them to Nagini for dinner. Then the Dark Lord put him under the Imperius, forcing Draco to watch as their bodies were slowly and painfully mutilated. Draco would stand there, helpless, fending off the tears that threatened to fall. The dream always ended as soon as Nagini turned and lunged at Draco, jaw unhinged.
Draco considers it for a moment. He can’t say that Greg is wrong; she has grown to become a brilliant witch.
When Draco first saw it earlier, he thought it was a tool left behind by the elves that is used to wipe the floors.
“Interesting…” Draco trails off, feeling a bit suspicious. From Blaise’s current behavior, Draco has a feeling this most likely won't mean anything good.
Potter’s eyes widen comically as he opens his mouth and closes it before speaking. “You’ve just been acting a bit… unusual, that’s all. You’re much quieter,” he stumbles.
One hot, scorching day when they were eight, they were eating ice cream in the grassy field behind Malfoy Manor. Pansy turned to him, mouth full of vanilla, chocolate swirl, and said, “Draco, you’re my best friend.”
“Ron!” She scolds, cutting him off before he can finish.
,” Potter reproves.
and incog for beta-ing this chapter! Also, thank you all so much for your kudos and comments, they make my day!! <3
“AHH!” Blaise leaps in fright, practically sitting in Draco’s lap while clutching onto him for dear life. “Pansy, stop!”
Blaise ignores him as he continues, “A few minutes ago, Finnigan eliminated Fletchley from the game.”
the one usually short of luck, but it seems that today the odds are not in Pansy’s favor.
“Get back down there
He sits in pure agony in his charms class, counting down the minutes and waiting for Flitwick to release them. After Pansy’s comment about the professor’s “appealing stature,” Draco can't look at him the same without picturing horrific images in his mind. Every time Pansy looks up at the board, Draco sends a scowl in her direction, occasionally sticking his tongue out at her if he can get away with it.
He interlocks his finger in his lap, trying to keep himself from staring at his arm. “Well, my family, we’re Purebloods, and my father was one of his most loyal followers during the first war before I was born. When V-Voldemort returned, my father crawled back to his feet.”
He ignores Pansy’s calls for him, and assumes that Millie held her back from following him. Draco’s just not in the mood for her pestering reassurances. He walks down the corridor, his mind racing to think of a place that would be most suited to his need for the world’s absence. A place full of peace and quiet. A small pocket of this castle where he can forget his overbearing guilt and self hatred for a while. He once had a place to himself here, a place open and wide, high enough to mute the noise, the quiet ambiance broken only by the flaps of owl wings and murmurs of the Forbidden Forest.
Draco panics and scrambles to think of how to reassure her, “No, my Pan Pan, don’t cry. Potter is too noble to think anything of it. He wouldn’t call you a slimy Death Eater if you tagged him. And… it would be good to show him he’s not the best, wouldn’t it?” Draco tries warily.
Pansy ruffles his already atrocious hair and he slaps her hand away.
Draco stands with Pansy in the corridor on Friday afternoon, waiting anxiously, and each second that passes causes his heart to pound harder in his chest. They’re hidden behind an alcove, out of sight, watching the trapdoor leading to the Divination classroom. Pansy keeps a firm grip on Draco’s shoulder, whether to ground him or reassure herself, Draco doesn’t know.
It’s almost as if Draco’s words summon her, because Coach Sylvester herself stalks into the Great Hall seconds after his comment, her stride full of her usual unwavering confidence, as she examines all the eighth years seated at their table. The only people wearing the hats are Potter, Weasley, and of course, Finnigan.
“Don’t even think about it,” Ginny warns, a playful look in her eye. “Anyway, don’t try to change the subject.”
Pansy scoffs. “And
“Yes, Hermione, I’m well aware that because I didn’t stop Malfoy in time the Death Eaters got into the castle and Bill’s face got maimed, thank you for the reminder.”
However, Draco is not going to wear his hat any longer than necessary—it flattens his normally fluffy hair—so he quickly stuffs it safely into his bag.
“What crawled up his arse and died?” Pansy asks.
“Lovely.”
“Who did you get?” Pansy asks eagerly, leaning over to see the name written on the parchment in his hands. Draco hastily crumples it in his hand before incendio-ing it.
“Yes, but I can do my studying another time. And frankly, it’s none of your business,” Millie says curtly, stabbing her sausage with her fork.
Draco shrugs. “Why not.”
Draco doesn’t get a chance to tell her he will absolutely not be meeting with her as she runs off, continuing her pursuit for Thomas.
“Hmm, well then perhaps… a person?” Theo says, a slight tremor in his voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Draco! Where have you—”
A tense silence fills the hallway, ringing in Draco’s ears. But soon Potter breaks it.
“Look away, you perverted leprechaun. You see enough of those in your hidden pensieve memory of Madam Rosemerta’s breasts.”
Draco shrugs. “I don’t see the issue. It’s just a silly game.”
Draco opens his mouth, an apology on his tongue, but he chokes. Unable to speak, he closes his mouth and simply nods to her again. He can apologize tomorrow, there’s no need to rush. He turns around to return to his table when he nearly runs straight into a familiar figure. Draco’s eyes refocus and take in the upclose sight of round frames. Potter. He takes a second to adjust himself, and narrows his eyes.
When no one moves, Coach Sylvester stalks out of the room, shoving Zacharias Smith into a bookcase in the process.
Pansy gasps dramatically and jinxes Draco’s hat to swivel around his head with a jingle. He sends her an indecent expression as he adjusts his wretched accessory back into place.
“Because I have standards, Blaise. And dignity. I’m off now, enjoy your freedom, Pansy.”
Draco grimaces inwardly, “Blaise?”
Draco releases a breath, feeling relieved. “Yeah?”
“What if… she isn’t.”
Hermione clears her throat, sobering up quickly. “Anyway, please don’t allow this to get out of hand. He takes things a bit too far with you.”
How Greg always manages to find out the menu never ceases to amaze Draco. Perhaps he’s charmed the kitchen elves with his never-ending appetite.
He throws open the door, storming out of the classroom before he can hear Potter’s response. A few moments later Pansy runs to catch up to him in the corridor.
“Oh, how would I live?” She asks, her eyes sparkling with amusement.
The boys gape at her, and she sighs again, “Draco actually has the right idea, so I’m going to the library to finish reading. I’ll see you both in Potions,” She stands from the table, kisses Ron’s head, and sends Harry a brief smile before departing, putting her head in her book.
“So, Zacharias is such an idiot. Today I saw him walk through the corridors for several seconds before remembering to put his hat on. All we need to do is wait for him to leave class and shoot him as soon as we catch him without the hat on.”
They both pause for a minute, considering.
“Of course she is, our darling Millie. If it weren’t for you, the ladies would never leave me alone. Your services are ever so appreciated,” Blaise gushes, batting his eyelashes.
Abruptly, she jerks forward as if to attack and Draco flinches away towards Pansy, moving her body in front of him. Coach Sylvester smirks before leaning back up, facing the rest of the students again.
At the end of class, Pansy follows Draco out the door, keeping pace with him before he can disappear down the corridor. Draco was hoping that he could get away with not being questioned by Pansy about Potter, but he should have known she would be determined to accost him.
Pansy throws a pillow at his face.
Before Weasley can respond, Draco continues, “Now, since I actually study and complete my own homework without leeching off my more intelligent best friend, I am moving to the library, far from you numskulls.”
Millie growls and runs straight into the door, which almost startles him away. As she continues using her body to break down the door, he hears a loud, barking laugh from the other side.
Draco stands there frozen in shock as Potter catches his breath from his heated rant. Potter has officially lost his mind. Draco wasn’t prepared for this—he didn’t sign up to be his punching bag. Potter needs to dump his baggage on some other poor sap, because Draco has more important things to do.
A part of him almost wishes that he had gotten Potter as his target so he could finally knock him down a peg. He is so sick of hearing all about how he saved the entire Wizarding World from the Dark Lord’s reign. Their lives are so insignificant that all they have to discuss is the scrawny bespectacled git and his ability to cast an Expelliarmus charm. How miserable.
The next morning as Draco is groggily stumbling into the bathroom, he almost runs into a figure much bulkier than Blaise or Theo. His eyes snap open to focus on Millie who is standing on the other side of the bathroom with her gun pointed straight at him, a fierce look in her eyes. He bolts out of the bathroom and locks the door behind him before she gets a chance to squirt or attack him. It seems his former skills as a seeker do occasionally come in handy.
“Sorry, Draco,” he mumbles.
“Good evening, I hope you all have had a relaxing week back at Hogwarts. I understand how difficult this time must be for everyone, so once again, I want to express my appreciation to all of you for returning here to complete your NEWTs. Your dedication to your studies is not lost on me.”
“You’re choosing to waste time on this farcical game instead of revising? Millie, where are your priorities? Don’t you want to become a member of the Wizengamot?” He asks desperately.
“Such a show off as always, Potter. You can never pass up an opportunity can you?” he jibes, striding past him forcefully.
“Sorry!” He shouts over his shoulder, turning the corner.
“Why Potter? Seeking another chance at glory? Ever the Gryffindor,” Draco says, rolling his eyes.
“But you cheated! McGonagall said you can’t attack your target, that the magic prevents that!” Weasley shouts.
“She can’t hear us. Draco, do you want to come?”
“He’s not a Death Eater anymore, and I can tell he’s trying to change his ways.”
Thanks for reading! Let me know what you think in the comments! :)
Draco bursts into the common room, startling those near the portrait. He spots Pansy sitting in an armchair beside the fire across from Blaise, laughter echoing, without her hat on. She turns to look at him as he approaches, lighting up at the sight of him.
Her eyes widen in panic. “No! I— look, I believe it to be best if we’re on… decent terms. But I can’t do that if you still consider me beneath you just because of my blood heritage.”
“That’s quite enough, thank you.” Blaise says, sliding up next to Draco, slipping his arm around his shoulders, “I think we should all heed McGonagall’s words regarding inter-house unity, yes?”
Theo ignores him, “Pansy would be just fine, she could come visit—”
“Oh Salazar!” Millie curses, glaring at him before stomping out of the room in a huff, slamming the door as she goes.
, he supposes. Draco has never seen Potter so sure of himself, with confidence radiating from him so exceedingly that it could have knocked Draco over. He hopes this doesn’t last, because it’s utterly infuriating. Nevertheless, this strengthens his resolve to beat Potter in the assassin game; Draco is dead set on being the person who finally wipes that smug look off his face.
That's a bit of an understatement,” Ron scoffs, staring at her with concern in his eyes. “Is he brainwashing you?”
“No, I— I feel like I don't really see you much anymore. You’re always with Pansy. I just wanted a moment to talk to you alone, is all,” Theo admits, pausing beside him. He glances at Draco for a moment before looking away.
“I saw you and that other Slytherin scum, Nott, having a little moment in front of the kitchens. So pathetic. He wouldn’t be nearly as good as me and you know it.”
“Ron, no. I don’t want to hear about that, spare my ears.”
“Hey! We haven’t started yet, cheater!” Pansy shrieks, smacking him on the arm in retaliation as water drips down her nose.
He keeps his head down towards his food but looks up at Draco from beneath his lashes. “I’m pleased by the offer, but I must refuse. I have to talk to Professor Flitwick about my project.”
“—I’ll do anything you want as repayment for your heroic deed of saving my life,” Draco sneers, unable to contain himself at the fierceness in Potter’s eyes. It’s intoxicating.
A panicked scream from upstairs fills the common room, and everyone turns towards the sound. Seconds later, Gryffindor Patil—in her nightclothes with no hat on her head—flies down the stairs before running out of the common room in a panic.
Great, what a wonderful activity to have these students partake in to forget about the war a few months prior. A game that involves murdering one another.
“After deliberating with the other faculty members and gathering ideas from a few students—“
He turns his attention stubbornly to the fireplace of the eighth year common room where McGonagall—the new headmistress—is standing, waiting with practiced patience for the students to settle. How this woman has yet to lose her mind from a career of enduring hundreds of rambunctious children nine months out of the year is beyond his intellectual capacity.
Patil and Finnigan both nod meekly, looking like they’d prefer to be having a cup of tea with Draco’s Aunt Bella right now.
Draco is impressed, although not too surprised by Longbottom’s dauntless behavior. During the final battle, Longbottom finally grew into his Gryffindor shell when he charged into the fight, battling dozens of Death Eaters before slaying Nagini. Despite still acting a bit shy at times, nothing seems to intimidate him anymore. Draco doesn’t blame him though. If he had defied the Dark Lord to his snake-like face, declaring that he would join him when hell freezes over, he too would no longer find anything else to be even remotely terrifying.
“I don’t believe you,” Draco taunts. He can almost feel Potter’s face on his own, his breath tickling his cheek.
Pansy practically skips over to him when she spots him at the doorway of the common room, her face so young and alive. The bell on her hat rings gently in sync with her steps, and she’s sporting it with pride, as if it’s a new trend she’s setting.
The three of them stare at each other for a few seconds before Pansy bursts into a fit of high-pitched laughter. Greg joins in a moment later, chuckling lowly. Draco doesn’t quite find this as humorous as the others, so he wipes the water off his face before climbing back onto his bed, waiting for their laughter to die down.
Greg nods firmly, as if it’s obvious what he’s saying is true. “Just dress up as a dementor again.”
“Actually, no, I don’t care to know. I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear you,” Draco says, staring ahead into the dancing flames as a distraction. He winces as the fire crackles, but forces himself to concentrate on it, telling himself that it’s not a threat.
“Didn’t seem like it when you sat in the stands watching like an overbearing Quidditch Mom, wanting to argue with the coach about overlooking a foul.”
“Thank you, Malfoy. And... just call me Hermione, if you would. I think we’re past the frivolity of surnames at this point, don't you agree?”
As he gets to his feet, about to storm into the bathroom and give Blaise the bat-bogey of his life, a quiet, hesitant knock at his door halts his movements. He noticed the knock was much lower on the door than it would be for your average eighth year student, besides perhaps Finnigan, though Draco knows he would never be so polite.
Harry sends her a smile he hopes is convincing and makes his way to the doors—but not too quickly—and begins plotting his course of action.
“Alright,” He says reassuringly, patting her back before getting off the bed to follow Theo out into the hall.
“How thoughtful of you, Potter. I admire your morality,” Draco mocks, batting his eyelashes. “Thank you for sparing me, your kindness is
“What is this nonsense she—“
“Well, you’re no fun. And don’t try to tell me the sound isn’t scary. How is this a game meant for children?”
“Pansy,” Draco says warningly.
Draco looks back at Theo who’s frowning slightly as he sips his tea. Despite maintaining appearances, Draco can tell Theo is not very pleased by his efforts to avoid being alone with him, so he quickly relents. “We’ll go together after lunch then,” Draco says.
“Good morning darling, enjoying your drink?” She greets.
Draco flops onto his bed, head first into his pillow. Stupid Potter. It’s not like Draco wanted to part of this stupid game. If only he could strangle the git without being sent straight to Azkaban. He doesn’t care that Potter spoke in his favor at his trial, it doesn’t make up for his irritable nature. His unruly hair and savior complex make Draco want to shove him against the wall and smother him.
Draco can’t help but laugh at her pinched expression which earns him another—harder—smack.
“So, Malfoy, I just got Anthony out,” Potter says, that obnoxious grin spread across his face, making his eyes glow. Draco has to force himself to look away before anyone notices him staring. “I caught him right outside the Great Hall.”
for beta reading this chapter, you are fantastic and I appreciate you so much!! :) Now, enjoy the chapter!
“I bet you would, you Death Eater scum,” the boy snarls, eyes scanning over the four of them. “Get out of this school. You all deserve to rot in Azkaban,” he jeers, throwing a hasty jinx before dashing around the corner out of sight.
At his jibe, Potter huffs in frustration and clenches his hands into fists. His green eyes are flaming, lit up with the familiar intensity that sends a rush through Draco’s body. Potter’s eyes are zeroed in on him, and Draco curls his lips into a smirk, relishing in the satisfaction of his reaction.
Draco clicks his tongue, shaking his head. “It seems the Patils have had rotten luck in this game.”
Draco continues, unwilling to let up. “Then perhaps you should reconsider.”
“Of course. I can handle Potter, don’t you worry,” Draco says reassuringly.
Draco turns around to see Justin Finch-Fletchley with a sour expression and notices a smug looking Finnigan following suit, “And why does Finnigan look like he got his wand polished by someone besides his own hand for the first time?” Draco questions.
“You made a bet over a Seeker’s game with Harry! How many more bets do you need to make with him before you’re satisfied? Or is it never-ending? Will we be eighty when the two of you bet each other to race on your walkers to the nearest bathroom?”
Harry doesn’t want to say that to anyone, however, because the last thing he wants to do while the Weasley’s are grieving Fred’s death is produce any more bad news. Harry knows how much Molly especially loves the idea of him and Ginny as a couple. She even dropped him hints on a few occasions last summer when she caught Harry alone, reminding him of how happy they were when they were together. Each time, Harry indulged her with a smile and nod, unable to cause her any more heartbreak.
Draco promptly starts on his toast, shoving the thought of Potter out of his mind. He takes his Transfiguration book out to distract himself, because there’s no such thing as studying too much.
Draco startles, looking up as Hermione slams her books onto his table across from him, staring at him like she’s seconds away from throwing him out the window.
“But yeah, yeah, inter-house unity blah blah,” Coach Sylvester revises, “I want to see all of you looking around every corner. Trust no one. Not even your best friend, because they will stab you in the back.”
Draco takes an unconscious step back. “Don’t fear, I only planned to sacrifice two of them to the Gods, I suppose now I’ll only do one for your sake…” he drawls.
Draco scoffs, looking out the nearby window for a distraction. He can’t stand Hermione’s earnest gaze. “Potter doesn’t believe that.”
“What happened to your fist?” Pansy asks, slightly horrified at the sight of her bruised hand.
Eventually, his mind started wandering outside his body into places so terrifying that he felt as if the snake was still sliding throughout the cavern, its tongue poking into his ear, accompanied by a hiss.
. Draco stumbles backwards, catching his balance, and then he peeks out and sees that Finnigan is close behind, chasing Patil down with his water gun out in front of him. The ringing from the bell on his hat announces his presence as the two weave through the tables with Padma attempting to outrun Finnigan.
“Stop complaining, Ronald! This game will be good for all of us to bond! I don’t think Millie will be that bad.”
“We shall see then,” he says, ending the conversation.
“You’re only saying that because you get your knickers in a twist in the mornings, Draco.” Pansy counters.
“Yes, that’s correct. So it’s exactly why I know who her target is and you don’t,” Draco smirks. Blaise flashes him scowl, which draws a laugh out of him.
” They cry in unison.
“Of course he’d help you! He can never resist teaching anyone a Patronus charm. And you realize he avoids them like dungbombs right? He absolutely hates all the attention he gets.”
“Did you do so terrible at the club that Coach Sylvester tasked a Hufflepuff to notify you of your termination?” Blaise taunts.
Well, maybe this will be fun after all.
“Hardly!” Blaise cries.
Blaise is already standing in front of the mirror when he walks in. He’s fresh out of the shower, only a bath towel shielding his modesty. Draco doesn't even blink as he walks in, rolling his eyes as Blaise sends him a charming grin.
Draco huffs “Of course I didn’t” he grumbles quietly. They both walk the rest of the way to the common room in companionable silence.
?” Weasley scowls.
He turns back to his group, who all look ready to hop back on their brooms. “Well, that was a good start, and congratulations, what is your name?” He asks the Hufflepuff girl.
Theo sighs, letting the emotions drain out of him. “It’s fine, we’ll just talk about it later,” he says sullenly.
Potter chuckles, his laugh warm, and does as Draco says. Once Draco’s feet meet the floor, he immediately straightens himself and steps away from Potter.
This sparked a reaction out of everyone as no one likes getting reprimanded by Madam Pince.
.” He sputters, staring after Hermione as she walks out of the Great Hall.
“Malfoy,” she greets not so kindly.
“What? I’m not wrong!”
The three hours Draco has had to endure before meeting up with Pansy in his dorm have been nothing short of torture. Draco excels at many things, but patience is not one of them. As someone who was once spoiled with anything a child could ever ask for, and given things the instant he demanded, those skills never quite developed in him.
“No, I’m just being logical. Draco is more than qualified to be a Coach,” Hermione says. She doesn’t know too much about Quidditch—to Ron’s disappointment—but from what she’s seen, Draco didn’t appear to be that much worse than Harry. His skills most likely didn’t come as naturally to him as much as Harry, but that shouldn’t be discounted.
“What do you think your patronus form will be?” Pansy asks casually, looping her arm through his own. He knows she’s trying to distract him. This is her usual method when he’s distressed about something, and part of him is grateful.
“It’s too late.”
“—we have decided to have you all participate in a muggle game called Assassin.”
Draco doesn’t return his gaze, still staring down at the unopened letter. “Yes, why? Seeking to make passionate, steamy love in the Forbidden Forest?”
There’s no way that he’s doing that, so Draco has no option but to crush him.
“I am nowhere near as horrid as those creatures, that is an offensive accusation!”
Theo takes a second to respond. “Jaffa cakes.”
“Well, my whole life my father preached about how much better purebloods are than Mud—Muggle-borns. Of course, I believed him, because why would I think otherwise? They didn’t have two magical parents, so in theory, it makes sense for their magic to be less powerful than a Pureblood’s. I looked at my father as my idol, my ideal role model, so anything he said was fact in my mind. But then you see…. Voldemort wasn’t even a pureblood himself, and our entire side was essentially wiped out by half-bloods and muggleborns. So really, it’s hard to see how it makes much of a difference anymore, whether or not we really are superior.”
Draco dodges her attack by moving off the couch, and she falls face first into the arm of the couch, her body laid across Greg’s lap. Draco laughs mockingly while Greg looks equally bewildered and amused at Pansy’s antics.
“Yes, I’ve seen that plenty,” he says dryly into the lip of his mug, taking a long sip of his tea. There’s a brief pause where Draco thinks it’s the proper moment to make his exit when Coach Sylvester breaks the silence.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy!” Pansy yells, her tiny figure radiating enough fury to startle Draco to another dimension.
“Madam Sylvester!” McGonagall calls in dismay.
“Yes. And another time before that when he was only a baby, if you can believe that.”
“Well, since when has Potter ever been keen to follow anyone’s advice?”
Blaise gasps, striding over to Draco in a few, short steps, and he snatches the letter out of his hands. Blaise quickly scans the letter before handing it back over, looking very displeased. “
“What the hell was that?” She shouts, zooming towards him on her broom, anger radiating off her small figure.
Theo stands up. “You need a perfect memory, one that is so overwhelmingly happy that you feel no sadness.”
happened for you to suddenly change your mind,” she pushes.
Hermione just shakes her head, but she catches something in Harry’s eye—intrigue—that gives her hope. “You’ll be eating your tongue once you see I’m right, and I’ll hold the right to say ‘I told you so’.”
“You’re cute when you’re angry,” Potter laughs. “And hey, it was only fair,” he says, holding his hand out to him.
“Ron, Riddle is dead. At this point, you should be able to say Voldemort,” Harry says, giving him a side-long glance.
“Theo, I can’t,” Draco says sadly. He could never leave his parents behind. Or Pansy for that matter. He couldn't live with himself if he did
“Oh coming from a Gryffindor, how hypocritical. And it was not dangerous, they are all capable flyers, clearly, so I don’t see the problem. If there was a real concern, Coach Sylvester would have said so. Seeing as she’s quite occupied with her group, she seems perfectly content with my coaching methods.”
“I still can’t believe that’s what you came up with for your end of the bet, Harry” Hermione says.
“Erm, no,” he says, shaking his head, “I mean, he’s never really been quite good at being evil in the first place. He couldn’t even kill Dumbledore.”
“It’s alright mate, no pressure, I was just wondering. I think you two really made each other happy.”
As he envisioned, none of it felt right. Although Draco realizes that the spell is stronger when he thinks of a person he desires, the memory of Theo wasn’t enough, nor was his actual presence. It dawns on him like a blinding flash of light that he can’t allow himself to lead Theo on like this anymore, not when Theo’s feelings aren’t reciprocated the same way. Without being able to explain it, deep down, Draco knows Theo is not the right person for him. In a perfect world where Draco wasn’t so fucked up, so guarded and cold, perhaps his affections would be different. When Draco gets in his moods, spitting out snarky comments, he would only hurt Theo’s feelings. He wouldn’t push back or challenge him.
“Yes, Potter is a complete barbarian, running through the common room at this hour, disturbing everyone who is just trying to mind their business. It’s deplorable.”
“So where were you in this war?” Coach Sylvester asks, the question slapping Draco in the face.
“So, back to the topic. Jealousy, basilisk, hypocrisy, Malfoy.”
Sue gives him a grim smile, seemingly accepting that answer, and stands from  her chair. She takes slow steps over to the window, peering out of it thoughtfully. “I appreciate that.”
, Draco understands now.
“Of course you do,” Draco grumbles into his cup of coffee.
“I was able to stalk you without you noticing wasn’t I?” Potter says, his eyebrow raised with a challenging look.
“Yeah, alright. Do you still want to plan?”
Millie arches a brow toward Blaise. “That’s usually the case isn't it?”
“She’s the last person whose attention I’d like to—”
” Potter mocks again, using a voice that has absolutely no resemblance to Draco’s own whatsoever.
“Blaise, you filthy bugger! I’ll get you for that!” Draco shouts.
“Stop it! I tell her not to but she does it anyway.”
“I’m not playing,” Theo says simply with a shrug.
Theo gapes, his casual demeanor dissolving instantly. He quickly collects himself, and forms a neutral expression, “Do you want some tea and biscuits from the kitchens?” He tries.
Greg makes a face of contemplation before shaking his head. “No, I don’t think so.”
Draco scowls but Theo goes on. “Any from your childhood? Getting your first broom? Winning a quidditch match? A favorite birthday.”
Draco squeezes his eyes shut, pleading with his mind not to provide the visual once again, as it does almost every night without fail. It creeps up on him, like shadows from the afternoon light, as he stares at the canopy above, or from the sound of running water, the water that streamed down as he lay, a pool surrounding him with the flowing of crimson.
When neither responds, Draco turns to Pansy and Blaise, “I’ll see you two in a bit,” he says, grabbing a breakfast burrito for Greg before he walks off.
As soon as Coach Sylvester walks off, Draco can't hold back a laugh, which instantly recaptures the attention of the two dunderheads.
“I just thought you’d find it...”
“Hello, Ginerva. Fine morning isn’t it?”
Of course, that's when he spots Potter sitting on the stands, staring straight at him with a look of bitter judgement. Draco sends him a crude expression that would most likely disappoint his mother before addressing the group.
He watches Potter and Weasley waltz into the Great Hall in true, unbashing Gryffindor fashion, chatting animatedly about Merlin knows what. They’re still wearing those obnoxious hats, the bell on top springing with each step.
Draco’s owl, Harold—a name completely unrelated to Potter—comes into his sight and lands next to his coffee. He’s carrying a parcel, one that Draco instantly recognizes as his Mother’s. Every year while Draco was away at Hogwarts, she would send him a box of sweets, usually chocolate, a letter, and a flower from the gardens. When he was younger, he would toss aside the letter and flower to dive straight into the chocolate. But in his later years, the letters became the brightest part of his week.
Pansy knows that Smith is the one person Draco wouldn’t be able to resist going after. Behind Weasley and Potter, Smith is one of the most obnoxious gits to ever exist. When Draco was still a prefect, he gave Smith more detentions than every other person combined, because he never left Draco alone. Smith always cornered him in empty corridors and attacked Draco’s neck with his mouth, firmly grabbing his arse.
A scoff is heard a few seats over and Draco doesn’t have to look to know it’s Weasley being a git. McGonagall turns her reproving gaze to Weasley, which quickly wipes the disdain from his face and replaces it with fright. She pauses for a beat longer before addressing the rest of the common room once again.
Something inside Draco drops. He blinks and after a moment, continues up the stairs to his dorm, controlling his breathing.
Draco starts at the reminder of the trials. Most of it was a blur; he was not in the ideal state after staying in the Ministry holding cells for a month. However, seeing Potter speak in defense of Draco and his mother was truly a sight to behold. Never in his life did he expect Potter to save him from punishment. Draco would have felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude if he didn’t already have numerous other debts he owed Potter. Of course, his mother had been ever so appreciative of it, going on and on about how much of a “good young man” he is. She mentioned it continuously for the entire summer to Draco’s dismay. He can’t recall there being a single day in which he hadn’t heard the name “Potter.”
Potter is behaving so oddly, Draco can’t put his finger on it. He doesn’t think he’s ever been carried like that by Potter, and he especially never imagined that ever being a possibility—one that he would obviously loathe to ever happen, well,
“Fine.” Draco sighs, getting in position. He flicks his wand the way he’s done countless times—grudgingly how Potter instructed to do it—and only a faint glow appears before flickering out again.
“That was fantastic, and so well-deserved,” Pansy chokes out through her laughter.
“Help me get Smith out. It’ll be fun seeing him all perturbed.”
Draco shudders, remembering when Peeves dropped them in the corridor during second year. He was just walking back to the dungeons after Quidditch practice when he was completely bombarded. He took five showers that night, and had smelled no better than he did before.
“None of us have told her or anyone else. We don’t see the point in doing so, it would be impossible for the Professors to monitor every corner of the castle, so nothing would really change. And it would only make us look weak,” Draco explains.
“Well, what do you know so far? It seems you’ve already been told his name.”
Draco had prepared for this, however, and he casts a tripping jinx, sending Smith crashing to the ground, landing flat on his face. As Draco strides up to him, Pansy runs to catch up and shoots Smith in the back with the water gun as he groans on the ground, in pain.
“That didn’t look like minding your business.”
He looks around the pitch and sees that all the players have gone to their groups. Draco looks at the students standing a safe distance away from him and counts 5 in his group. All of them look younger than fourth years, with bright, eager eyes despite looking a bit timid. There are two Gryffindors—a boy and a girl, an eager looking Hufflepuff girl, and two Ravenclaws. He’s shocked by the lack of Slytherins. He remembers in first year when most of the Slytherins a couple years above him all tried out for Seeker, wanting the position with the most power. Perhaps they deem this club below them, as most have already learned to play at home. Draco knows he would feel the same way.
“—Same with your mother, Draco. You aren’t responsible for her well being!”
“What doesn’t matter?” He asks patiently.
As they settle themselves onto Draco’s bed, Pansy turns to him with zeal.
“As dreadful as every morning.”
“A thank you would be nice, you know,” Potter says dryly.
Blaise came up with the nickname Panties back in first year when he had a terrible crush on her—somehow under the belief that it would earn her affections—and it quickly caught on amongst the other Slytherins in their year. Since then, Pansy reigns hell on anyone who ever utters the name, showering the perpetrator with stinging hexes until their eyes are swollen shut. Normally, Draco doesn’t provoke her with it, but on occasion he deems it worth it.
A faint, glow appears at the tip of his wand. He hasn’t been able to ever produce more than that, even while in the best mood.
He exits the castle braced for the cold, and treks over to Coach Sylvester’s cabin placed near the quidditch pitch. He realizes that this was never here before, and he wonders if she demanded she had one built for her. Draco swallows back his panic, reminding himself that Pansy will surely notice his absence… or at least Greg. Well, he hopes so.
“Why don’t we just steal his hat? I feel like that would be much more efficient.”
“Fine,” she says with a loud sigh. “Well… he’s been needing help conjuring a patronus, and after I told him you taught all the members of the DA how to cast one, he said that would be his favor. I say that’s a much better prize than yours.”
Hermione rolls her eyes at him, as if he’s the slow one. “Forget it. How much have you been practicing?”
By instinct, he looks to the ground beside him and evidently finds no bag present, of course. He sighs, reluctantly spelling the door unlocked, and thankfully Draco is not ambushed with questions as Theo returns his bag. Draco’s face must be telling, because Theo simply places the bag next to him, squeezes his shoulder, and exits without a sound.
Draco stops his eyes from widening, and nods politely. “Yes, Hermione. Then, just Draco is fine.”
“Take your own advice, because the only shining gold you’re going to see is the sight of my arse as I fly past you and catch the snitch.”
“Ah, excellent question. You see, he hid in the bathroom connected to his and Fletchley’s room and shot him from behind as he was taking a piss. I can imagine Fletchley wasn’t very pleased to be caught in such a compromising position
“That’s so daft. As if winning this trivial game will be enough to overshadow the unfortunate matter of his lack of height. It’s not worth the sheer degradation.” Draco mutters.
Draco leaps to his feet, his cards flying across the table. “Well, I am going to call it an early night. See you all tomorrow,” he says hastily, running straight for the stairs to the dorms.
The following day, Draco swiftly exits the classroom, wanting to get as far away from Potter as possible. The audacity of him to humiliate Draco in front of everyone, and not even have the decency to feel remotely remorseful.
“Hello my darlings, have you heard the news yet?” Blaise cuts in, slinging an arm around Draco’s shoulders.
Pansy whacks Blaise forcefully, eliciting an inelegant yelp out of him. Draco suppresses a cackle.
They all freeze up in fear. That’s not a flimsy claim coming from Millie. Not the girl who shaved Pansy’s when she used the last of Millie’s shampoo during second year. She refused to grow it back until the following day, which, for Pansy, was considered utter torture.
“Pansy, I’m afraid to ask, but how did you find out his timetable?”
Potter quirks a brow. “Malfoy, you were getting groped by Smith just a few minutes ago. If I hadn't been here, he would’ve...” Potter trails off, unable to finish the sentence. Draco shutters at what could have been, but he sets those thoughts aside.
Blaise gives him a disinterested look before turning back into the bathroom. Not a moment later, a jinx shoots straight in Draco’s direction. Draco darts out of the way in time, laughing at Blaise’s poor attempt. “I thought you had better aim than that, Blaise. Pity.”
It honestly sounds like paradise, exploring France with Theo, all the worries of the past behind them. But he knows that leaving will not erase his problems. And his family would never agree to move. His mother refuses to leave the Manor, so he would essentially be abandoning her.
Draco’s mind whirls, the new information setting him off balance like a storm sending a boat off course. Draco isn’t sure if he’s understanding her correctly, as it’s impossible for her as a Quidditch Coach to be a Squib. Though he thinks back, and he doesn’t recall ever seeing her using magic, or even welding a wand. It would explain why she makes tea by hand.
“While pursuing your target, the magic from your signatures will prevent you from using any spells to apprehend them. This also applies to the person being pursued. Only the water gun may be used in the process of capturing your target,” McGonagall says, “everyone please pick one from the bag, but do not look inside,” she finishes as she begins to circle to room again, having the students take a name from the hat.
He hears an unlocking spell being cast and the door swings open.
This throws Draco off, bewildering him. Why does Potter sound so sure of that? He keeps his expression hard.
“Actually, if I’m being honest, it only makes it hotter,” Smith utters through a low moan.
“Oh how grand! Yes, allow me to kiss your feet, and shine your shoes while I’m down there. Thank you for giving me another chance, Oh Savior! I shall repent for my actions until death consumes me,” Draco declares mockingly, with dramatic gestures in his direction. “Yes, Potter, I may be much more subdued this year, and I congratulate you for using your observation skills that seem rather underdeveloped. But, I refuse to grovel and beg for forgiveness. If one thing still remains in my life, it is my dignity. So leave me the fuck alone, Potter, because you don’t understand—”
“Well, I know
“He should be revising for his NEWTs! Not spending all his time plotting to eliminate you. He won’t stop talking about the game now. He’s so focused on getting you out that he hasn’t been eating, and Ron swears he sees Harry with his light on for hours in bed. You have to call this off, because he won’t listen to me. I’ve already tried.”
“Exactly. Now you’re catching on,” Draco smirks, poised to stand up, only to be thwarted by Pansy’s yank on his arm.
“How’d you do it Malfoy?” Fletchley accuses, sitting beside Smith whose smirking at Draco venomously.
“What did I do this time?”
“So, it’s a deal?” Potter asks, offering his hand for a shake.
Draco smirks. “Actually, she’s requesting that we have tea together tomorrow.”
Draco nods absently before scanning the room, deciding to sit in the chair closest to the door out of precaution. He listens to her as she makes the tea, ensuring she isn’t making any sudden movements.
On top of the motivation for Pansy, now he has an extra motive of staying in the game just to spite Potter and his pet Weasel. He doesn't mind it one bit.
“Are you lying?” Greg asks simply.
And of course, Blaise insisted on keeping the scarf, deciding he would start a new fashion trend. “I’ll call it: Potter-chic! He’s all the rage right now anyway, what with saving us all, so it will be splendid. I’ll make a fortune.” Draco was not amused by this in the slightest.
Harry looks a bit startled at being called out, but she doesn’t waver.
?” Blaise gasps dramatically, “What happened to Slytherin loyalty?” He accuses, dropping his utensils with a clatter.
“Is that Potter?!” The young Gryffindor boy—Dacian—calls. “Coach Malfoy, ask him to do a seeker's match!” He pleads.
“I won’t allow you more than that,” she says, shooting him a warning glare.
Why not.
Hermione sighs, releasing a held-in breath. “I guess I can’t expect that from you so soon. But I hope that one day you’ll get there.”
I can’t look at Flitwick anymore without imagining him riding—”
“Reina Sullivan, third year,” she says with a proud smile.
“I was just serving justice for his disruption, Blaise. You have to admit that was quite the entertainment.”
“Yes, that is something we know quite well already, and?” Draco raises a challenging eyebrow.
“Mmm, yes. He told me what he was going to ask you but I don’t think it would be fair to say.”
At first, despite not protesting against it, Hermione found this new policy to be a bit insensitive, as she knows it’s important to work through your emotions in order to move on from them. But eventually, after too many late nights of crying and arguing over those who had died and what they should have done differently, she realized Ginny had been right; their discussions weren’t helpful, they merely reopened fresh wounds, pouring salt on them the longer the conversation went on.
His eyes follow the curved lines of stems expanding and weaving across the expanse of the wall. In this moment, the pervasive wallpaper, flowers growing upon flowers, appears to have more freedom than Draco ever did—unbeknownst to him until the moment he reentered his old home, realizing it felt no more suffocating than before.
“Alright, let’s start off with a race. First person to reach the goal on the opposite side of the field and return to me wins. Line up, let’s go!” He shouts, waiting only a few seconds before counting down “Ready, set, GO!”
“Don’t be sorry, it’s just a matter of survival. We have to convince the entire Wizarding World that we have reformed and become muggle-lovers for the sake of our own self-preservation.”
Draco releases Pansy as she grumbles at him in offense. His scowl deepens from his embarrassment and he crosses his arms. He’s not afraid of her. He just can’t afford to ruin his perfectly sculpted nose is all.
Draco sighs heavily, thinking of how best to explain it to Greg in a way he’ll understand. He struggled for months on this subject, agonizing over it during the summer in the Manor. He felt like his life had been turned completely sideways, unsure of what to believe. He didn't see how any of what he had been taught truly mattered anymore; it seemed pointless. However, he still can’t completely get over his usual revulsion of them, his natural disdain at the mention of Muggles.
“I bet you will, my dearest Draco,” Blaise calls back.
Draco doesn’t actually know if Finnigan has that in his wank bank. At least, he didn’t until now. He only heard from Blaise that he has the same, which Draco personally finds quite disturbing.
After having to fight off Blaise who attached himself to Draco like a leech, begging to let him come along, Draco knocks on Coach Sylvester’s door, which swings open almost immediately.
Draco sits there, feeling quite awkward at her fierce tone. He may hate Potter with a burning passion, but Coach Sylvester seems ready to commit murder at the thought of her previous adversary. She looks admittedly terrifying.
Hermione scowls, “Fine, but it’s not like your obsession actually prevented—” She cuts off, realizing what she’s saying and looks away, cheeks flushed in embarrassment.
Suddenly, Millie appears at the door, holding her gun out in front of her, which almost startles him off the bed. She puts it away once she examines the situation, “Don’t worry, I handled it. They should all leave you alone now.”
“Well I am good at charming clothes, so eat before I charm yours away,” Pansy smirks, returning his challenging look before taking a sip of her pumpkin juice.
The concern on Potter’s face morphs into indignation, his brows furrowed. “Don’t act like you’re the victim, Malfoy, you’re not the only person suffering from the war. At least you were given the opportunity to come back to Hogwarts, after everything.”
“I could spell it that way, if you’d like?” Harry offers, his lip quirking upwards.
McGonagall pointedly clears her throat.
“Ready Draco?” Greg asks suddenly.
“Oh. That’s been a hard spell for me. I haven’t gotten it yet.”
“Shut it before I give you a black eye.”
Theo leans in, placing a soft kiss on his cheek, which leaves a lingering tingle in its place. Draco can’t budge from the spot. They stare at each other for a moment, a heavy intensity in the air.
Harry laughs, picturing the instance in his mind. It saddens him a bit, thinking about how much simpler that time had been—even with the stress of Buckbeak and Sirius.
“Yes, you should.” Potter winks, and then he’s gone, returning swiftly to his seat with his fellow Gryffindors.
“Ah, I will never tire of grumpy, early-morning Draco,” She says, squeezing his cheek. Pansy laughs as he dislodges her, “Let’s go to breakfast, a nice omelet will do the trick.”
“What are you doing Malfoy?” Potter looks past him towards Granger. “Is he bothering you?”
Pansy clicks her tongue and smacks his arm reprovingly. “I hardly believe I annoyed you enough to the point where you are choosing to subject yourself to pursuing Potter. Although… saying it out loud, it does make sense.”
“Distressed and happy I get the same result. Fantastic.” He mutters to himself, taking note of his utter failure.
Draco hums absently in agreement. “What subject?”
Now, sitting visibly in the front, Theo would be unable to pull any stunts on him without being chastened by Madam Pince. Even if he did attempt anything, Draco’s consolation would be getting a show out of it.
Hi guys, I’m back with a new chapter! As always, thank you to the wonderful
This chapter is dedicated to all my Theo Thots, so maybe grab something you can squeeze, or a pillow to scream into. Enjoy!
Pansy and Blaise laugh, and Draco turns to meet Theo’s eyes, an intense and unreadable expression on his face. Draco decides to ignore him.
“This is a prototype created about 50 years ago when the Unspeakables first began researching time travel. Lucius’ great grandfather was part of it, and he kept one for the family should they ever need it. Lucius told me about this after he returned to the Manor, just in case. Everything is explained in these journals written by Oraios Malfoy. It includes all the research he and his colleagues had found.” She hands him two, leather-bound notebooks, both worn down around the edges. As he stares down at them, the engraved initials O.S.M., made visible by the reflections from the moonlit windows, there’s no doubt in his mind what his decision will be.
Draco scowls, clenching his fists. “Of course I’m acting unusual, Potter. Isn't that what you all want? For me to simply keep my head down and act properly chastised for my actions? Despite what you may think, I’m not hurting anyone. I’ve been minding my own business, so fuck off, because you have no idea what the past few months have been like for me.”
“I’ve got yeh Padma, surrender!” He shouts, not unlike a barbarian.
“Great job! How’d you do it?” Pansy asks fervently, her curiosity spilling out of her.
Draco makes his way towards the en suite bathroom, focusing on the feel of his feet pressing against the soft carpet—his attempt to ground himself. As he approaches the sink breathing in deeply, he avoids looking at his reflection in the mirror, unable to meet his own gaze now without seeing Potter standing behind him with his infuriating look of pity sent in his direction. Only seconds before the nearly fatal curse left his lips, permanently slicing Draco’s abdomen, scars extending from his hips up to his sternum. He can never seem to escape that emerald gaze behind the infamous round frames, even while hidden away behind his own cell.
Potter looks comically gobsmacked. “Do you not hear yourself? Maybe you should come along with me and have Madam Pomphry check your ears.
Potter nods, seemingly pleased with his answer. “Good. Prepare to lose, Malfoy,” he taunts.
Coach Sylvester turns to him with a pleased smile. “Well, I don’t usually like to say this, I prefer not to brag,” she starts with a smug smile that tells Draco she tends to do the opposite, “but I’m espoused to the world famous Quodpot player, Duke Puffstenburg. We’re currently long distance. His brother is the founder of Puffstenburg Broom Company, and he was willing to make me my own personal broom.”
“Speaking of halfwitted Gryffindors, here come two more.”
A second meaning to that phrase comes to mind, but she refrains from mentioning it. “Well, I’m sure if you actually thought this out you could have come up with something,” she says. “Anyway, speaking of Draco, has he asked you about anything recently?”
“No, that’s not— Smith was assaulting you for God’s sake. I was only trying to keep him from hurting you.”
“So, I know you’re a, what’s it called, Slytherin, right?”
Potter instantly flushes and blinks away, staring resolutely at a nearby bookshelf. “
“Mother calls me that already.”
“I’m joking, don’t wet your pants,” Coach Sylvester continues. “But I won't be when you get to try outs and don't make the team. So, each of you split up into groups by which position you want to play. All the Seekers go to Malfoy, Chasers go to the Weasley girl over there, Keepers go to Wood near the goal posts, and I’ll take the Beaters.”
“Oh, don’t get your knickers in a twist, I made sure to punch your left one. I know how important your right one is for those lonely nights when Hermione is not in the mood—”
Potter cuts off his words as he shoves Draco straight into the wall, hands pinning each of his arms beside his head.
“Draco, I know your ability to wait is as long as my hair, but you’ll be alright love,” She soothes, flipping her bob with an affectionate eye roll.
Pansy raises her chin proudly, “Yes, the best a person could ever ask for!”
“Hey, you haven’t told me who your target is! Who is it? Do you have
Draco doesn’t deign to respond because they both already know the answer to that question.
“No, I don’t think that’s it. He’s just a poncy git,” Ron grumbles through his mouth full of food.
“I am aware that the name sounds quite alarming, however no real murders will be taking place. In this game, each of you will be given a name of one of your peers, and that person will become your target. I will provide you all with a muggle device referred to as a water gun and you will track your target down and shoot them with water. Once you eliminate your target, you will assume their target. The only way to remain safe is by wearing this hat on your head, and our house elves were kind enough to make them for you all” Professor McGonagall pauses to gesture to a massive, unsightly witch’s hat placed on the coffee table.
The hat is large and pointy with a bell at the tip. Various patterns poorly sewn into the crown of the hat with red, blue, yellow, and green—Draco assumes to represent all four houses in a disturbing way. Around the band are small, sewn figures of the animals of each house—a lion, badger, eagle, and snake. Hanging from the edge are letters that spell out Hogwarts repeatedly around the brim.
He is starting to accept the idea of Muggleborns, admitting to himself that Granger is more skilled than he will ever be even with her blood status. Clearly, blood does not define power; that has been demonstrated. However, he still can’t shake his bias towards them that has been ingrained into him since the minute he was born.
Draco sighs. “You’ve got a point.”
Greg suddenly appears by his side, oblivious to what just happened, “Ready for lunch? I heard they’re serving steak and kidney pie.”
“Nice try Pans, now get off Greg. He did nothing to deserve such a brutal attack. So, how about you apologize while I go grab some parchment and a quill. Then we can start planning Smith’s demise,” Draco offers.
“Well, then they used to be. I remember you always begged me to run to the kitchens with you to grab some,” Theo counters.
“Alright, you’re so terribly boring,” Pansy whines.
“Come on, forget these imbeciles,” Blaise mutters.
“None of that now,” Pansy dismisses, wacking her hand carelessly against his chest, “We have important business to discuss in just a minute, if you have managed to forget about.”
Draco nods, unsure of what else to say on the matter. It’s not like changing your beliefs is as simple as waving a wand. He just doesn’t… know. It’s all very overwhelming.
Potter doesn’t move for several moments, trapping Draco in an unwavering, calculating stare. Draco refuses to be the first to look away, but truthfully, he couldn’t if he wanted to. Potter’s eyes are devastatingly enchanting.
“Hey, I never said I was involved!” Blaise says, putting his hands up defensively.
thing I wanted to avoid. And the only person backing us up is Coach Sylvester, but who’s going to believe her? No one likes her!” Pansy cries frantically.
He knows that ideally, he needs someone who will save him, pull him out of the water, but what Draco truly desires, involuntarily, is someone who will fall right in with him without hesitation.
you’re the absolute best! Enjoy the chapter! :)
“Is it something to do with you? It would be the least of surprises,” Pansy says.
Draco remembers accepting it begrudgingly, choosing instead to curl into him, tucking his head into Theo’s neck.
“Check your pockets,” Coach Sylvester says.
“Yeah.” Greg nods again.
Potter rolls his eyes. “You’re impossible.”
“—I just
“DRACO!” She screams before attempting to tackle him.
- But Draco’s also not having a good morning, as he finds out Pansy wants to smash Flitwick and he gets into an argument with Potter and the Weasel. All before first period.
“It’s not a violation when you know you want it too,” Smith breathes out, gripping Draco’s buttcheek firmly. “You’re just playing hard to get,” he breathes against his cheek.
Harry looks up, finding her at the Gryffindor table looking as fiery as ever. Her sleek, red hair reaches down to her lower back now, and her smile is blinding as she laughs at someone’s joke.
“I didn't ask you to.”
“Sweet Merlin’s tits. Literally.”
“It’s a gift, I know,” Blaise says suddenly, leaning gracefully on the doorway, the bell on his hat jingling faintly, “What are you two hooligans up to?” He asks, moving to sit on Draco’s bed next to Pansy with Theo hot on his trail, placing himself beside Draco.
“I get it. Just be careful, okay?”
Draco laughs as the portrait closes shut.
“Who is it?”
“No, I’m going to use that time to go after my target instead.”
Draco’s eyes dart up from his book, thoroughly startled by the sudden voice. No one ever approaches his table, no less Hermione Granger who looks much too intense for him to handle at the moment. He was in the middle of reading Charms textbook in hopes of finishing his essay due tomorrow, but he can tell from her acute expression that that will not be the case.
“No, you dolt, if you weren’t such a swot and left the dorm every once in a while, you’d know that Smith is spreading around that Draco cheated in the game. She also found out that Potter was apparently his previous target.” Blaise corrects.
Coach Sylvester shakes her head disapprovingly. “The praise always goes to those who don’t deserve it.”
“You could never.” She smirks.
At the end of the clinic, Draco sees Potter standing at the edge of the pitch with his arms crossed, looking put out. But Draco has no ounce of sympathy towards him, because Potter did this to himself by enduring the cold for no reason other than to be a wand in Draco’s arse.
Draco forces a smile. “Yes, you’re right,” Draco says, swallowing thickly. “I think I’m going to take a break now.”
“Alright, well you need a stronger memory. Clearly the one you have isn’t good enough.”
Draco scoffs. “And give the people a free show? That’s so generous of you.”
“Yeah… yes, good idea,” Theo says faintly.
“Yeah, he was being a pain in my ass, trying to tell me how to run my own Club. He can go eat a dirty sock. Sore losers don’t get anything,” she says, walking over with the tea cups, handing one over to Draco.
Draco feels a tingle shoot through the back of his neck, which he tries to ignore. He resists the urge to rub it, convincing himself it’s nothing. He isn’t fearful of the corridors at the moment. Only the eighth-years get released early from class, and it’s impossible to hide the jingle of a bell.
“So, you didn’t even tell us,” Pansy says, breaking the silence, “how did he even manage to do that so early in the morning?” Her eyes are still glued to the smirking idiot as he sits down next to Thomas, slapping the palm of his raised hand. Whatever that means.
Draco is cut off by the sudden appearance of Potter, who is sliding into the bench across from him, breathing hard like he ran over here. Blaise startles slightly, leaning away from him as if Potter will infect him with his Gryffindor germs. Draco doesn’t quite blame him for it.
“Chocolate Hobnobs,” Draco says.
“Malfoy, you’re not evil or dangerous. I wouldn’t have testified at your trial or returned your wand if I believed that,” Potter says, his tone unreadable.
She stares down at the table, looking ashamed, “Sorry.”
Draco belatedly swats her arm and shoves lightly at her shoulder, “I don’t know how I put up with you.”
“How is it that after everything, Malfoy is still a self-centered prat?” Harry frowns as Malfoy disappears through the doors, furiously fighting the heat spreading in his cheeks.
“It’s hardly an insult, Weasley, I’m well aware of my fair, porcelain skin. I prefer it over your abundance of freckles, each one fighting tremendously for a spot on your skin,” Draco sneers, “And we’ll see about that Weasley, you underestimate my abilities.”
This seems to shake Potter back to reality, because he releases his arms. “Sorry,” he says, taking a step back, the ghost of his touch still wrapped around him. Draco is finally able to regain his breathing.
This doesn’t really pertain to Draco, because he has too much on the line to be focusing on this game. He can’t slack off on his studies, because he needs to do well on his NEWTs and get a good job. It’s what is expected of him, so personally, he doesn’t have a preference for who his target is. He’s not obligated to go after them if he doesn’t want to. Besides, he won’t have time since he spends most of his afternoons in the library. He would prefer not to upset Madam Pince and feel her wrath because of this ridiculous game. It’s so juvenile—
“Welcome Draco, take a seat in any of my lovely furniture. Tea? I know how much you Brits like that,” she offers, heading into her kitchenette.
“Well,” Draco sniffs. “You should be! You couldn’t out-stealth me if your life depended on it. I’ve already caught you following me. Aren’t you planning to become an Auror? You lack complete subtlety, you’re like a Hippogriff in an antique store.”
“So, who the hell was Voldemort?”
“So what happened then? Was she upset?” Pansy persists, clearly oblivious to the tension.
The next week, Draco is sitting at his desk in Defense, waiting endlessly for the class to end when he’s pulled out of his daydream by the last words he ever wanted his Professor to utter. His fantasy of stomping on Potter’s face a second time fades away as he darts his eyes to Professor Byron, frightened.
“I’m quivering,” Potter says blandly.
“Not with the dark tricks up my sleeve, Potter. I did trip Smith, you know, sent him flying flat on his face. That wasn’t a lie. So you are no match for my stealth or magical abilities.”
“I had an arch nemesis once. He was like stubborn gum under my shoe that wouldn’t unstick. He kept trying to sabotage my team, taking away our funds for his stupid club. He’d walk down the hall, acting like he owned them, and I just wanted to smash his stupid chin-face into the ground,” Coach Sylvester glowers, holding her mug tightly as she stares into the fire watching the memory flicker in the flames. “Potter reminds me of him… with his messy hair and self-righteous attitude, God I can’t stand the sight. He could be his twin,” she grumbles.
“That you’re dropping out of school to become an escort?” Pansy quips, her voice losing the bite it normally has.
“Oh, not so fast, Malfoy!” Potter shouts, excitement clear in his voice.
“If you feel this way, that I’m scum of the earth, then why didn’t you just dispose of me, have me sent away to Azkaban for the rest of my miserable, worthless life? As the beloved Savior, I know they would have taken me in at your word.”
“I only make you think that.”
Since the incident in the Room of Requirement, faced with near death, the threat of being engulfed by flames imminent, he jumps at the sight of fire; whether it’s a candle lit on Greg’s nightstand at night or a flaming torch in the corridors. He thinks it’s a stupid thing to fear when he has seen and experienced much worse, but all he can do is try to work through it a little bit at a time.
McGonagall is cut off by the sudden crash of the portrait swinging open, hitting the wall, as the Coach in question walks through it.
Draco groans. “Everyone seems to be keen on examining my appearance these days. Am I that appealing?”
Potter laughs.
Draco bristles at the threat, realizing Pansy may have been right about needing to avoid Slytherin tactics in this game. But in his defense, it's practically second nature for him to resort to those techniques; It’s hard to break such a habit.
