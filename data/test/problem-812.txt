"We will be stating guilty to the child endangerment only," Doolidge said "however we would like to contest the severity as Madame Umbridge did not realize the true extent of the damage."
"Hey ginny" he rep[lied softly as he tried to escape. Ron and Hermione quickly helped him since they knew what would happen if he was late. As they ran down the platform they saw Harry's uncle standing there along with molly weasley.
“I promise that this will be the last time you’ll see me. I won’t come back. I won’t put you through anything like this again. You can go on with your life without any more interference from me. It will be as if I’d never existed.”
"they felt the need to make up for 2nd year and in reality 4th year was just a ploy to get Dumbledore off all of our backs they never really turned their back on him" draco said petting his boyfriend's hair
"Easily as Draco said most of this is a front that house elf fully respects me as Lord of the house of black. And even as he didn't he wouldn't betray Harry since he is the heir of black."
Elective courses offered and their requirements: textbooks for these courses have already been purchased
"Of course madame" Dumbledore said. Inside his head he was glad to get it back but reluctant to hand it over to the meddling woman. Ever since she showed up all of his plans had been falling through.
"That pain," she continued not letting anyone speak, "is something i will never experience again. For the death of a mate means the death of that Faerie. I had wondered why I did not die. Normally we do not last longer than a week, yet here i am 70 years later."
SO I LOVE THIS DRESS HOWEVER I DONT THINK THE COLOR GOES WITH THE MODEL'S HAIR SO KEEP THE LEAVES, THE BASIC STYLE AND MAKE IT AN EMERALD GREEN COLOR.
"A horcrux is a remnant of your soul that you cast into another object or person by means of a ritual in order to make you immortal. It is a vile process to complete and severely complicated. Only two people alive know how to do it."
“None of the studies are assigned except mine” she said, “that one however is at the far end of the house above the nursery and library so you can’t miss it.”
"Then pack enough clothes for a month to start. We can always get more. and then find me a plane to london. The quickest flight, I dont care if it leaves in the next hour. Time is of the essence.
“Age is the answer for the most part. There is no creature involvement from what we know. True my family has vela but its at such a low percentage it would not make any difference.” Lucius responded, “The boys started courting when they were twelve but Harry’s home situation combined with pretending to hate each other has caused a strain.”
"madame Umbridge you are hereby charged of the aforementioned charges of Child abuse, Misuse of a magical object, Child endangerment, and Attempted Murder." Kingsley Shacklebolt called "You will now be judged before this commitiee. Abstaining votes from Chief Wugmump Dumbledore and Lord Potter Peverell Gryffindor"
Bella let out a breath and the others realized that she had been waiting on his approval as her mate. With the tour now completed each couple went to their room to unpack and get situated. Remus made sure everything was in place and he, Sirius, and Severus each apparated to Grimmauld Place in time for the meeting.
Damien suddenly hissed and flew from her shoulder to Edwards. He then began to sniff and nuzzle his face.
As they rode down to the lowest level lucius commented "I did not think anything was stored down here."
Suddenly a small goblin rushed into the room holding a pet carrier and a small dragon perched on its shoulders.
"Ill start with the blocked core since it will take the most energy. That way his own healing can kick in if needed."
Returning to Foxwood manor everyone went about reading their textbooks and picking out their classes.
“Yes we were able to figure out once he focused on the ingredients and less on the actions it worked out,” Severus replied, “While he may not be a potions master I do feel like he has an excellent future in gathering ingredients or becoming an herbologist”
"Well, and I fully suspect that group of people we saw her with will be coming with her they looked to be the coven that she had been telling us about the letters. In which case Remus and Lucius should probably go to the muggle London airport to pick them all up. Renting a car would be best and then entering through Diagon Alley you should be able to floo to my quarters straight from there. That way Dumbledore doesn't hear of her coming."
As she said this sirius pulled off the cloak for both him and Harry. People of course began to shout in outrage and aurors fired their spells but a purple shield surrounded them both and everyone turned to Bella to see her hand outstretched.
The Cullens were happy with their new wardrobes as it allowed them to retouch a piece of their past.
"there were times i really thought Vernon would kill me," Harry said ,"One time i thought he was going to rape me. He had already beaten me so badly but then he started opening his pants and I knew if he did this i was done. I was going to kill myself. Then he just froze and walked out. I couldnt understand it at first"
"And he won't Draco. Bella will be able to heal him and should be able to help with other problems we have been discussing. I can formally introduce you once Harry wakes up as she probably will not wish to make instructions more than she has to she absolutely hates that formality unless as with people she doesn't like in then she revels in it." Severus says with a smirk while the two marauders nodded.
Remus and Lucius both stood in muggle clothes and looked at the video screens trying to find the flight
"Severus whats wrong," She asked anxiously, "You never use the mirror unless its an  Emergency. And what have I said about calling me your ladyship or anything of that  Manner?"
They had not waited five minutes when he returned with the Bank president. After exchanging the formal greetings they made their way to the vault shafts.
The next day was the leaving feast and even Dumbledore couldn't manipulate the points enough for Gryffindor to come out on top. As such Ravenclaw won the house cup. They then all went to the train. ron and Hermione were kind enough to create a buffer so Draco and Harry could spend their last few hours together.
these are just pictures of all the outfits everyone got on the shopping trip. labled with who the outfit is for
"No you didn't," bella says sighing," you were reacting to not only your thirst but everyone else's. I don't blame you and if I find you blaming yourself I will find a way to smack you across the head where it will actually fucking hurt."
what other couples would you like it for? not lucius/severus not that that wouldnt be great but i have another plan in mind and in that plan they are happy being grandfathers. the pairing list will follow with the next chapter so dont worry about lack of choices.
"Yes I would like a full breakfast spread for nine people and a couple pitchers of warms animal blood for seven."
"Your right," Everyone turned to Rosalie,  "We haven't asked. Edward didn't even ask to meet your family when he came to pick you up for the baseball game. Everyone assumed since your living on your own that you had no one."
"Soooo- you were all going to leave," Bella starts, "without saying goodbye, without giving me a damn explanation or anything else. REALLY."
"No! no, apparently that is what you mean. Because instead of asking me my opinion about the party, or anything else, hell even what happened with James, You decided you want to make decisions for me as if i were a two year old child."
---------AN Important the wizemongt is set up like it is in the movies however above the center dias where the Minister of Magic and other official sit are two Diases. The first one above it is for the Founders houses and the second one above it is for the high table-------------------------------
The group then headed out to explore the rest of the manor and to be seen to their rooms. The spiraling staircase was daunting, even if it did not wobble or show signs of weakness under their feet. As they climbed Bella explained that the second and third floors were composed of bedrooms and studies.
"I mean," the potions master replied a she looked at his patient, "that a combination of the blood loss from the blood quill as well as his blocked magic from Dumbledore is a lethal combination. I can't save him not on my own."
"Let us move on to the next charge" Amelia Bones said "There will be no altering of the charge as it stands"
Harry sighed, wanting to share it with someone, and he knew he could trust her with this secret, even though it wasn’t his. He leaned forward over the table, and she did the same so they were close enough to talk quietly. He cast a Muffliato spell around them for good measure, he knew Draco would be rather die than let anyone find out about his condition. Hermione stared at him, somewhere between alarmed and intrigued
“He used the Cruciatus Curse on Bellatrix Lestrange less than six months ago, Ron!” she cried, fighting tears now.
Blaise arrived an hour or so later, having been enjoying his Sunday lie-in, and Pansy quietly informed him of the morning's events. He looked at Draco with wide, worried eyes, grabbing his hand before Draco could withdraw it. He knew about past events, what little his friend would disclose, and feared for him.
book?" She asked, reading the back cover with feigned disinterest, though she seemed to scan it several times. Draco grabbed it from her, ignoring her derision.
times more bloody embarrassing." He muttered, sitting on the sofa. Harry couldn't help but grin at that, sitting beside him and patting his knee, rewarded with a pink flush over the sharp cheekbones and the knobly bridge of his nose. He was ever so slightly freckled from the recent sunny weather, Harry was pleased to notice.
“Goodness me, bring him in.” she called to them, moving to the bed closest to her office. “What’s happened?” she asked, helping Blaise get Draco settled on the bed, his whimper of pain very clear.
The next morning, Harry woke up to soft, white light from the windows, through which he could see big fat snowflakes falling. Draco was fast asleep beside him, snuggled up close to him under the blankets. They were both still naked, Harry’s arms wrapped around the Malfoy’s narrow waist. He could feel the steady breaths on his chest as Draco slept, his fingers curled idly between them, and was content to doze for a bit longer.
“Go on then.” Harry’s voice said cruelly, gripping the white hair tightly, but Draco ignored him besides a small wince. “Don’t make me Imperious you.” Harry warned. “I’ll have you begging Snape to fuck you in the middle of Potions.” Draco looked up at him, steely eyes wide with rage and fear. He knew he’d do it, the Monster he saw as Harry had already used the Cruciatus curse on him. His eyes stared up at him angrily, then darted to his wand, and he took a deep breath.
It was another half an hour before Draco came out of the bathroom. Harry had restored all the objects on Snape’s desk to what he hoped was the original layout, and looked up when the door opened. Despite being impeccably dressed once again, Draco looked awful. The bruise on his cheek was dark and angry, having made its way up to his eye socket, and he’d cleaned up the dry blood from his lip but the cut itself looked very sore, and he looked painfully thin as he shuffled through the door. Harry wanted to help him, but he knew Draco would hate that more, so he watched, heartbroken, as Draco Malfoy inched his way towards the sofa in the corner, using anything he could get his hands on as support. When he made it, he very slowly and gingerly lowered himself onto the cushions, carefully avoiding sitting at all. He ended up lying on his side facing the room, and Harry, and curled up. Harry looked away when he started crying again, and went into the store room to continue their task, filling in Draco’s list as well as his own. It was the absolute least he could do, his whole body feeling wretched and disgusting with guilt.
The other hand moved Harry’s cock to align with Draco’s barely lubricated hole, and the Monster thrust forward. Harry watched Draco’s eyes go impossibly wide as he was violated, staring back at him. His screams stopping for a moment though his mouth stayed open beneath Harry’s hand. Pain and pleasure caressed the edges of Harry’s mind, but he was far too horrified to feel it.
“Gryffindor tower, of course.” He said warmly. “Your friends are very worried, and I think sleeping in your own bed again would be good for you. Routine, Harry...” He said sagely, though Harry very much doubted ‘routine' would help at all.
"Yeah, you too. I, um…" what the hell was he suppose to say, "I hope you're happy, Draco. I really do." He said, feeling tears in his eyes. He took a deep breath and sniffed, smiling. "Congrats again on the new flat. See you around." He said, and Draco nodded stiffly. Blaise gave Harry a measured but approving look, watching him back away. Harry sighed, finally feeling like he was far enough away to turn, and went to join his girlfriend.
"Goodnight, Potter." He said, before striding away back downstairs. Harry waited five minutes before heading off to bed too.
“That’s not good enough! You must still be ill if you have this little appetite, Draco, please.” She sounded passionate, begging her friend. Draco himself didn’t say a word, and finally Harry heard them saying goodbye and they’d see him later. A moment more passed and Draco Malfoy came round the corner, but stopped dead when he saw Harry waiting there. His eyes were wide and he looked like he was considering running off in the opposite direction, only to jump suddenly when Snape’s drawling voice echoed behind him.
The Monster laughed when it realised Draco was starting to harden under Harry’s hand, gripping him tighter until he groaned in pain, begging his assailant to stop, to leave him alone.
He had learned many secrets, too, from the flapping mouths of grunting Death Eaters, the part of his mind that experienced pain and humiliation sealed tightly away while his unfeeling, logical brain drank the information in like wine.
Awaking from a doze, Blaise was relieved to see Draco still beside him, still asleep, and the back of his hand had moved to press idly against Blaise's chest, presumably in his sleep. Blaise grinned at the Malfoy, then looked up to see Goyle wearing much the same expression. He was dressed casually in a rugby jersey and jeans, eyebrows raised at the two of them.
He went to bed, warm and slightly drunk, after a couple more shots with the others, barely recalling what had happened in that shelter it was all such a painful blur, and fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.
on top of everything?" Ron demanded, Harry shushing him to keep his voice down. Ron had returned from his walk to find everyone very nervous, his two best friends meeting him outside to discuss. Hermione had dug out as many books as she could from the house and her bag, Luna finding some as well, on werewolves, and was in the process of studying them. Draco was still napping, unaware of their discovery, and they wanted to keep it that way for now.
“Headmaster.” He greeted with a small nod of his head, face grimly neutral. Dumbledore patted Harry’s shoulder and told him to sit down, going round to join his colleagues. Harry obeyed, sitting down stiffly and having trouble deciding where to look. McGonagall was looking pointedly at her notes, Snape was staring at Harry like he were an angry viper about to strike, and Dumbledore just smiled at him.
“Are you going to explain what you did?” Draco spat at him, his grey eyes cold as steel. “Explain that you did this to me…?” his voice cracked, turning away slowly. He took a deep breath and attempted to stand up, leaning fully into the cubicle door as he hauled his broken body upright. Harry watched with renewed horror at just how badly he’d hurt Malfoy: the thin trembling legs, the dark bruises shaped like Harry’s own hands on his jutting hips and slender throat and around his eye, the agony on Draco’s face as he tried to swallow it down with a tightened jaw and clenched fists. Ignoring Harry’s lingering presence, he tried to push himself off the wall, as if assessing his own strength, and almost immediately buckled. Harry leapt to catch him, but the flinch and look of terror in Malfoy’s face that his touch elicited was enough to make him want to never touch Malfoy again.
“That’s it, Potter.” Draco lunged, easily sidestepped by Potter who scurried off to another aisle. Draco sprinted after him even as he continued to read out more paragraphs of drivel.
“I was trying to pay you a compliment, you arrogant arse.” He nudged Draco and they both laughed. “Thank you though,” Harry said, “for telling me to go. I wouldn’t have done, if you hadn’t, you know. You helped me, more than you know.”
Malfoy was sitting in the living room, newspaper in hand, the very picture of poised elegance. Harry awkwardly shuffled in to stand opposite him. He stared at Draco, not for the first time drinking in the extent of his beauty. There was something inherently turbulent about the nature of his gaze; the intensity raking up both a lively sense of excitement and a thirst for knowledge.
Potter chuckled. “What about that time in first year? You got as all sent to the dark forest, remember?”
Draco sipped from his mug, resuming his reading at the same time. Harry wasn’t sure what to make of the short interaction he’d just witnessed. There was respect between Malfoy and his house-elf. He remembered the way Draco used to treat people he considered to be beneath him, let alone house-elves.
Harry sighed, running a hand through his hair. The door in front of him clicked open but instead of greeting Malfoy, he was faced with a wide-eyed house-elf, staring up at him.
Harry felt himself blush. He took another sip, anything to distract him. Malfoy’s cheeks were also flushed, Harry realised. Oh, this was too perfect: anything he could do to humiliate Malfoy, Harry would welcome with wide arms.  Obviously, any kind of flirting was making Malfoy uncomfortable, and Harry planned to use that to his full advantage.
They didn't need to talk about why he craved cold water after an episode, it was just something he needed to do. Blaise was there to make sure he didn't stay cold long and, in many ways, the ritual brought them closer to each other. That's not to say their relationship wasn't strained at times but, as with anything difficult and ongoing, there were good days and bad days. Their new flat had automatic controls they could calibrate to assist with such attacks, just in case, and room for them to be separate as they sometimes needed. They would have their own bedrooms, though intended to share as often as possible - it was simply a means of escape if it was required. Draco occasionally had bouts of extreme introversion where he couldn't be around others, even Blaise, and needed somewhere to relax by himself, and Blaise liked to have his own space just for himself every so often.
Molly Weasley could be loving and as bubbly as anyone, but Harry had seen what she could do, both to Fleur and Bellatrix Lestrange. She could be unforgiving too. Harry didn’t ever want to witness that side of her directed towards him. If Ginny and he were to split up, he was afraid he might just have to.
“I was kind of surprised actually,” Harry said, “at dinner, when you said it was about time we settled things.”
Kingsley raised his brows but didn’t say anything more. “Harry, he’s…he’s not doing well. He needs someone there, making sure he isn’t targeted.”
care about Malfoy. It was Malfoy. Why should he care? Harry had testified on Malfoy’s behalf sure, but it was just because of Harry’s debt to Narcissa. Was…was Kingsley looking at him funny? Harry had always felt an obligation to help people but, come on. Hadn’t he given enough?  He played with his collar: did someone turn up the temperature? No. Harry didn’t care about Malfoy. He despised the man. Why on Earth did Kingsley think he’d help him?
Draco shrugged. “Well,” he said, “Wilde couldn't exactly have written explicitly about queer men and wizards, now, could he? It was Victorian England, Potter.”
“If you would be so kind, Potter, I would ask you to leave your robes here.” Draco’s lips quirked into a familiar smirk. “I presume that you’re wearing something underneath.”
The coffee charms may not exactly be canon but I thought it'd be a cool thing to have. If you enjoy, please do let me know - I'd love to hear what you think!
Despite their protestations, they did eventually decide to leave, and Blaise pulled Draco into a hug. “Take care,” he said, “I’d hate to have to arrange your obituary service.” He gave Draco a meaningful look and looked over his shoulder to throw Harry a two-fingered gesture vaguely resembling ‘I’ve got my eyes on you’.
Potter shrugged again. “Not sure,” he admitted, “just never really pegged you for the type to disobey the rules.”
“Yes,” they each whipped their heads around to face Andromeda, “it can be either a boy, or a girl’s name, anybody's name. What matters is whether you feel like it belongs to you.”
Draco smiled, drained the last of what was in his glass.  “You know there’s no one else Potter.” Draco looked tired, so incredibly tired.
“Give us a minute,” Blaise shook his head, tugging at his laces with more force than necessary, “I’ve barely just got my shoes back. I should sue.”
Harry shrugged. “My job to keep you safe.” He paced around in a small circle, spinning on his heel whenever he needed to turn around. It would be so easy to trip him up.
Teddy sniffed, nodding. “Can you…have you ever made it longer? Have you ever changed to look more like a girl?”
Potter held out his hand when it was time to go. Draco placed a hand on his shoulder instead. Draco didn’t have time to wonder what Potter’s slight frown might mean, and they apparated with solemn faces.
My excuse is exams, which I think is vaguely valid? On second thought, no, this is definitely more important.
“Are you certain that you won’t be joining me for dinner this Saturday? There’s plenty of room in the manor.” Draco didn’t look at Harry as he spoke, his silver eyes trained solely on the ground.
“It isn’t about me, or Ginny,” he said, “it isn’t even about how I feel.” He sucked in a deep breath. “Molly, Mrs Weasley, always saw me as her son. I looked at her the same way, I guess, as a Mother. When I started dating Ginny…I think she saw that as a way to keep me closer. She wants us to get married almost because then I’ll be a Weasley, properly. God.”
“No offence,” Harry said still hovering in front of him, “but you don’t look fine.” He tried a small smile and Draco snorted, pressing fingers to his forehead.
Her hair was still kept in a familiar classy bob, though one side was longer than the other. She leant against the doorframe, grinning, snakelike. Predatory.
Harry stood to his feet, flashing her an easy smile. “Not at all,” he said, jabbing a thumb over his shoulder in Draco’s direction, “he’s just got a migraine, happens a lot.”
The table spread smelt like homecooked bread and pumpkin spice. It didn’t smell like Hogwarts, not in the same kind of way. It smelt like family. To Harry, it smelt like home.
“Although,” Potter said, smirking, “the restricted section was always a highlight of the Hogwarts library.”
Harry’s week had dragged on (Kingsley giving him days off until his work with Malfoy commenced, trapping him in limbo), and his weekend was turning out to be just miserable. Ginny had taken Teddy to see Luna, without him, despite the fact that Harry was his Godfather, not Ginny. It was yet another heartless attempt to avoid him. He wondered if Luna asked where he was.
Malfoy abruptly stopped. His grey eyes were wide, and he was staring directly ahead of him. Harry frowned, placing a hand on his arm.
“Ginny.” Harry swallowed. Probably should’ve been clearer; he’d sounded a bit like a hitman. “It’s all done. You were right. About not pushing my family away, I mean.”
“Is everything alright? And don’t just say yes, I’ll know if you’re lying.” Harry wrapped his arms around himself.
Malfoy stared at him for a good few seconds before he slumped back in defeat, looking paler than usual. “I knew this would happen,” he said, his voice practically a whisper.”
Kingsley sighed, standing to his feet. Harry’s eyes narrowed as he followed Shacklebolt’s movements. Kingsley shrugged. “You have to understand…with his family history—”
Draco’s heart thundered in his chest. This was unfamiliar, domestic. He pushed his chair back with a resounding scrape, making his way to stand beside Potter near the oven. The smell was overwhelming here, and he looked over Harry's shoulder at the little pan, simmering on the stove.
Ginny looked at him, properly, she thought, for the first time. She saw Harry, gazing up at her. She looked past all the legends, through her childhood celebrity infatuation, straight to his core. She saw not the boy who lived, but the boy who gave. Gave and gave and gave. He’d given her so much, forgiven so much. Now he was giving her his blessing, for a love he’d never be part of.
“Oh, Harry,” Ginny took his hand with a squeeze, “I should’ve said something sooner, when I first realised, it’s just I—”
“Keesey hates to interrupt, Sir, but this is the third letter this week,” her eyes were widened as if delivering news of the gravest kind, “Keesey has to ask, Sir, when will Mister Potter be replying to his family?”
He was just rearranging the section of the library reserved for theatre when he felt someone tap his shoulder. He swivelled around to find a girl, a few years his younger, smiling up at him by the bookshelf.
Potter stood awkwardly in the driveway, making a small circle in the gravel with his toe. Draco whisked away to the front door, producing a key with a flourish.
Harry always had the suspicion that she expected him to do the same. She’d fallen for the hero, the boy who lived, not Harry. He was just Harry. Just Harry, and maybe, just maybe that disappointed Ginny. Though she’d never tell him, Ginny was too kind for that, Harry knew she wanted more, and Harry…he wasn’t enough.
Harry shrugged. "I think it's cute," he said, not missing the way Draco's brows shot up and his ears turned red, "I've got a record player back home. Maybe we could listen to them sometime."
Harry felt his stomach twist at the memory of Draco’s flushed cheeks. He tried to ignore it as he poured himself a glass of wine. He was just frustrated. It had been a year of having nothing but his own company, two years of barely being touched.
“Don’t call her that.” Harry was leaning forwards in his seat, knuckles growing white as he clutched the arms.
“To my office, please, Blaise. And you, Harry.” Dumbledore said calmly, walking past them all. Blaise broke his staring contest with Potter, and followed the teachers. He vaguely heard Potter’s friends asking what Blaise had meant, but Harry just said he’d see them later.
He returned to his friends, telling them it was just the signature, and told them the whole story later.
“Put it in your mouth.” The Monster snarled, and Draco’s eyes closed as he obeyed, his thin pale eyebrows trembling in a frown as he let the hot stiffness into his mouth. Harry’s hips moved forward, the Monster holding Draco’s head still. Draco’s eyes widened in alarm, trying to push himself away from the intrusion. “Suck.” Harry stared down at him, watching him begin to suck, his eyes squeezed shut. Harry let out a shuddering moan as he felt the hot wetness around his cock, velvety tongue tentatively making contact with the underside. Draco let out a small, voiceless sob when the Monster pushed Harry further into his mouth, his hand opened and desperately trying to remove the hot, thick organ before it went down his throat.
“Me neither actually. Lucky neither of us snore, I suppose.” He said. Draco smirked despite himself, and glanced at him.
This time, though, he looked around to see Hermione and Draco there as well, the three of them all standing in the same places they had been sitting, but Shell Cottage was gone.
Then a cleared throat had them all looking up and at the doorway, where Luna stood. Behind her were two surprising but by no means unwelcome faces: Bill and Fleur.
“Whoa, mate…sorry, didn’t mean to scare you… What the bloody hell happened to your face?” Draco was still staring at him, grey eyes wide, but he seemed to calm himself down, letting out a shaky breath. Pansy rushed in, glaring at his bruised cheekbone.
“Y…yes… I hurt Draco…I hurt him so badly…” he sobbed, shaking his head slowly. “I w-wanted to stop…I’ve never wanted anything to stop more in my life but…something was controlling me…in my head, in my chest…the Monster wouldn’t let me stop…-”
“Good, that's that then…” he said before standing up, and going back to the bed to gather his clothes.
Harry saw Draco’s hand shakily reach for water jug and, doubting he’d be able to lift it right now, poured a glass out for him. He handed it over before Draco could protest, and Malfoy only gave him a small glare before sitting forward to sip the cool liquid, holding the glass in both hands.
The Malfoy boy was close to fainting when they finally arrived at the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching ballet to his trolls. They didn't met anyone on the way, thank God; he would have had no explanation for such a strange scene.
“Professor...” he said, his voice weak from lack of use, not moving towards him. Dumbledore strode over to him, his face finally visible. He was smiling in his gentle way, half-moon spectacles perched on his crooked nose, his presence relaxing Harry as it always did.
“Monster? What do you mean?” McGonagall asked. Blaise looked at the teachers, and saw they were both staring at Harry. McGonagall looked completely dumbfounded, her face white, and Dumbledore had a hauntingly blank expression, studying Potter fixedly.
“Harry, you know what you need to do. Snape is a good teacher, he can help you block him out. Swallow your bloody pride and learn from him, Harry, please.” her own voice shook, sounding more childish than she'd wanted. He looked at him, face red and eyes puffy from crying and sleep deprivation. Ron mentioned he thought Harry was addicted to Dreamless Sleep, that didn't surprise her either. “I'll go with you, ok? Keep you grounded, so you can learn. Ok? Promise me, Harry.” She said needing him to nod at least, so she knows he listened at all. He did nod, wrapping his arms around her waist and hugging her tightly.
When Snape finally returned at 6 o’clock, he found both boys bore very clear signs of a physical fight. Draco even had bruises around his neck, like Potter had strangled him.
Draco was walking down the corridor, on his way to the library, thinking about how tragically excited he was to just sit down and do some homework. After the strangeties of the Christmas break, it would be nice to just get back to (his) normal as best he could. He rounded the last corner, trying to decide between Potions or Charms as his first essay of the day, when an obnoxious bark of a voice made him jump.
“Expelliarmus!” Harry’s wand and mind responded reflexively, he didn’t even think the Monster cast the spell that had the wand in Malfoy’s hand flying into the air. “Incarcerus.” It added, pointing Harry’s wand at Draco, who was already reaching for the other wand in Crabbe’s pocket. Thin cords shot from Harry’s wand, wrapping tightly around Draco’s tin wrists and lashing them together, the Monster easily hooking a hand around the cutting ropes to keep them out of trouble.
Blaise followed Dumbledore and McGonagall up to the Headmaster’s Tower. He could sense Potter behind him but knew that, if he looked back, he’d do something he’d probably regret. They arrived at a large stone gargoyle, and Dumbledore said ‘Caramel Cauldrons’ and the gargoyle began to spin, moving upwards and bringing a spiral staircase with it. Blaise was taken aback, having never visited the Headmaster’s office. Potter, however, didn’t even break stride, passing Blaise as he followed the teachers up the stairs. Blaise clenched his jaw, and followed.
“Look at you!” she cried, grinning. He smiled at her, then glanced at Blaise, who grinned back at him. “What happened?” she asked, piling food onto her own plate.
“We had a little breakthrough last night, I suppose.” Blaise said, Draco smiling at him, their eyes meeting for slightly longer than usual.
“We don’t blame you, Potter…” McGonagall said quickly, finally meeting his eyes. “Just seeing what You-Know-Who did through you was so awful…forgive us.” He understood how they felt, he felt it himself, saw it every time he closed his eyes… He managed a half smile and a curt nod, and left the office.
"S-secret passages. Easier to... get around undisturbed." He practically wheezed, feeling completely bereft of oxygen.
Bill, who had been frowning at Draco thoughtfully, looked at him and smirked, his arm around his wife. His scars tightened at the movement, but he barely noticed anymore.
Anything could be useful, the Order  will know what to do with it." Draco's eyes were wide with panic, shaking his head.
“Potter…? What do you- H-how did you get in?” he demanded, looking between Harry and where the door usually appeared, now blank wall once again.
“If you’re so concerned, Potter…pass me that water jug and a glass.” He said, pointed to the table beside Harry. He obeyed, bringing the jug full of iced water and lemon, and a glass. He placed them both on the ornate bedside table, the top surface of which was inlaid with rose motifs. Draco sighed, and pushed himself to sit up slowly. His brow furrowed and his jaw tightened in apparent discomfort, but he was able to do it himself, though Harry was poised to help him if he asked. He settled himself back on the cushions, pulling Harry’s robe on the way it was designed so it covered him completely.
His Monster had been undulating in his chest the whole time, only to spring up like a delighted puppy as soon as it saw Draco. Harry had immediately averted his eyes, tried to keep his gait natural as he walked past, feeling like his feet were embedded in concrete as he moved. He needed to change this, needed the Monster to leave. He still feared what he'd do to anyone else, but now his thoughts of harm strayed mostly towards himself.
Snape stowed both wands in his inside robe pocket, and produced two folded up pieces of parchment from another. “Now, I want you to take a list of ingredients each, and count how many individual units of every ingredient there are. The nature of units vary, for instance a unit of doxy eggs is a jar, a unit of unicorn tale hair is a bag, and unit of dragon bone is per bone – loose items like bones are stored in boxes but don’t count how many boxes there are. Clear?” he asked, looking at them both. Harry nodded, and presumably Draco did the same because Snape thrust the two lists at them. “Compare numbers when you are finished to check there are no discrepancies. If there are discrepancies, you will need to recount those units. I will return at lunch, but I expect you will be here all day at least.” He said, going over to unlock the ingredients store room which had another locked entrance into the Potions classroom. “Quills and ink are on my desk. I will be locking the office door, you may use the bathroom in my office.” He said, sweeping past them to the door and, with that, he left. The click of the door locking echoed in the large stone room.
“Goodbye Potter,” he said haughtily. He didn’t look around but heard Potter mutter something incoherent under his breath, “I look forward to seeing you again on Wednesday.” He wasn’t sure that he did.
Draco breathed a laugh. “That’s because I’m not important. You came to me for support because I don’t mean anything. It’s easier, that way, to offload, no judgment.”
Harry scowled. Grumbling something indiscernible, he pulled out a chair from the kitchen table and slumped into it. Sulking, Draco thought, and he smirked.
“Mione, it’s fine, really.” Harry smiled at her weakly, though it wasn’t as forced as he might’ve expected. “Why’d you ask?”
Harry stared up at Draco, his beautiful features, pale and sculpted, eyes closed as the wind toyed with his hair. God, he wanted to kiss him. To take his face and make him see just how much he deserved to be loved. How much Harry loved him.
“Would Mr Potter like anything to drink?” Keesy asked. Harry’s eyes were still trained solely upon Draco’s features.
“He leaned in, breath fluttering as our noses nudged closer– shall I continue? I can definitely continue.”
“I’m gay.” The words slipped out calmly, smooth, as if Draco had meant to say them. He hadn’t and he was suddenly very aware that his very real, and very shocked, schoolboy obsession was sitting very much in front of him. There was no turning back now.
Malfoy rubbed the back of his neck. “They deserve it,” he said, “if children don’t have access to books, it debilitates them. It’s the same with kids who don’t like reading. I do what I can to help them.”
Hopefully, you like where I'm going with this! Let me know what you think. As always, thank you for reading :)
The rose bush was the only plant in the garden left trimmed and sculpted. Sometimes, Draco would weed the earth around the roots by hand. Once, he even found an earthworm.
Potter gawked at Draco’s elegant fingers, a dark blush crawling over his cheeks. “Wha…” his voice came out as a squeak and he cleared his throat, “what am I supposed to do with that?”
Draco pursed his lips and, shaking his head, stepped outside into the brisk air, closing the door behind him. Potter looked concerned.
Potter nodded slowly. “I suppose we were both arseholes in Hogwarts,” he said with a sniff. Draco huffed a laugh.
“What’re you doing?” he asked, brow creasing. Draco rolled his eyes. He didn’t answer Harry, holding out his hand.
Hope you enjoy! Please drop me a comment if you did (or didn't...constructive criticism is also welcome, within reason of course).
Malfoy stood up straight, placing the pen pot back on the desk. He rolled his shoulders back into a shrug.
Keesy shook her head enthusiastically. “Oh no, Keesy couldn’t possibly sir. Keesy needs to begin cooking dinner.”
“If you must know,” Malfoy’s constant undermining was pushing Harry to the edge of his temper, “Keesy stayed because she had nowhere else to go. I’d have thought you of all people would understand that.”
“Hey.” He lurched around at the sound of Potter’s voice. “Woah,” Harry said, hand supporting Draco’s elbow, “easy there.”
Harry nodded, resting his chin on Draco’s shoulder. “Well,” he said from behind, “it’s never too late to learn how to cook.”
“I think you’ll find that I just might be.” Harry rolled his eyes. Malfoy, as usual, was dressed in a fine suit, accentuating his slender form.
he thought, trying to work out his current feelings. He was worried, anxious, but also aroused and eager like before. Whatever magic was affecting Draco, Harry was sure it was affecting him too, maybe it affected Blaise as well.
. Blaise was saying something that made him laugh, looking at him with a softness Harry was surprised any Malfoy was even capable of.
He didn't fall asleep for a while, still hyperaware of his partner's breathing and muscle tension in case he was needed again. Instead, he looked around the room from his position on the sofa bed, holding Draco close and stroking his slightly damp hair. He memorised the cracks in the walls' plaster, the little mouldings that ran along the edge of the ceiling and around the light fixture.
"He keeps to himself." Draco said, adding a spoonful of fruit salad to his plate. "He found the Stoker book quite entertaining though, I think. Completely fanciful, of course, Muggle fiction usually is. He liked Polidori's work a lot more." He said with a shrug, eating a slice of bacon. Harry's head spun a bit from the casual revelation.
“Yeah…ok…” Harry mumbled distantly, heading for the boys’ dormitories. He knew he could think in there.
Harry cast Muffliato on them, allowing Ron to go off on one again about Draco still being dangerous.
“Keep… k-keep going...!” he cried, his hot hand making Harry want it all over him. He leaned down over Draco, one hand on the pointy hip as he started thrusting, deep and slow, the rhythm making Draco moan so erotically Harry was nearly tipped over the edge half a dozen times. He went down on his elbow beside Draco’s head, his body feeling like it was almost protecting Draco’s as they moved together. Draco was meeting his thrusts now, clearly wanting Harry to come as much as Harry did.
“Concentrate on your breathing, ok?” he said, looking at him and only him. “Don't look at him, look at me. Look at me, Draco.” He encouraged, turning slightly to face him. Draco did as he was told, tearing his eyes from Potter's flushed, smiling face, to look at Blaise's soft eyes and dark skin that looked really nice and rich in this lighting. “Good, now think about your breathing. Every breath in, every breath out. Which one is harder?” he asked, expecting an answer.
"Thank you..." He said softly. Blaise murmured a feeble ‘you're welcome’ and knelt down to gather Draco's clothes - pyjama trousers, a huge thick jumper and thermal socks. "I-I was so cold...I just wanted to feel warm... The water was so hot it hurt, but it felt so good..." Draco was mumbling softly, staring at the floor. Blaise frowned, holding the trousers open for him to step into, which he did, one hand on Blaise's shoulder for balance.
Harry’s true self, or so he thought at least, felt like he was watching through a thick layer of clear ice, seeing everything but lacking the strength to break through. He wondered if Crabbe was feeling similarly…or Draco, for that matter. Perhaps he’d made himself somewhere safe to go in his mind, where he couldn’t feel the pain in his body. But…judging from the truly anguished sobs coming from Draco, it seemed he was all too present…
“Very well. Go, now.” he muttered, not looking up as he sat down at his desk. Harry looked at Draco, who drew himself up to walk almost confidently towards the door. Harry glanced back at Snape, relieved to see he hadn’t noticed anything different about his desk, and followed Draco out of the office, though stayed a fair distance away from him. Draco turned the corner to head for the Slytherin Common Room and dormitories, his hand on the stone wall as he slowed down, dropping his fake strength. Harry knew Draco would hate it if he tried to help, but he would feel even worse if someone saw him while he looked this weak.
“How come…no one helped you this time? Have they all gone home?” Draco nodded slowly, looking down. “Who would you usually ask?” Harry asked, trying not to show how incredibly curious (and a bit jealous) he was. Draco glanced at him before sighing.
“Just wondering…” he said, glancing at her. She was looking at him suspiciously and he sighed. Why did she always know when he was lying? “I…I’ve heard of some… sexual curses…?” He saw Hermione blush instantly, but didn’t look up at her for fear of doing the same. “Um, like ones that… make the person feel really unwell and stuff if they don’t…
They finished their meals and Harry got right back to opening his gifts. Hermione had given him a book about becoming an Auror and other advanced magical careers, which looked really interesting; Ron had given him some new Quidditch goggles with his glasses prescription so he’d be able to see (he assumed Hermione had helped a lot with that one) and a selection of sweets; Tonks had sent him a very fancy shaving set with a note that said
This seemed to give the Monster another awful idea. Still thrusting mercilessly inside Draco, it pressed Harry’s wand to Draco’s neck and said “Crucio,” loudly and clearly. Draco’s whole body constricted in agony, his back bowing almost inhumanly, screaming hoarsely as his head jerked against Harry’s shoulder as he leaned into him to feel every tremor. The feeling of being inside him was phenomenal and Harry came the hardest he could ever remember, deep inside Draco’s spasming body, stumbling a little as the Monster relished the orgasm.
Pansy looked up from her book and followed Goyle’s distracted eyeline to see Crabbe walking in with a dazed expression on his face. Pansy frowned, watching the large boy lumber over to them and collapse into the armchair opposite.
, were good company, even just on canvas, but to have pale imitations of his parents would likely have driven him insane, as the Mirror of Erised had done to so many.
He was moving on, healing slowly but surely, and no longer relied on potions to sleep. He was, honestly, ok.
His parents were likely begging the Dark Lord to save their son from certain destruction, their (second) worse fear of him falling into the hands of Potter and his lackeys realised. Voldemort, who had made it clear that the Malfoys were no longer held in high stead, would be unwilling to waste resources on his sorry life, but would be concerned about Draco spilling his secrets.
him into telling them what he and Snape had talked about. Draco had told Pansy about what really happened in Hogsmead that night Draco nearly froze to death. Looking at Draco now, he looked like he actually had. He was perfectly still, his eyes wide as they stared at Crabbe, his face pale, gaunt (despite some recent weight gain) and terrified.
Then Harry stood up, breathing hard, and slapped Draco hard across the face with the back of his hand. Draco fell into the newly locked door and didn’t have time to stand up properly before Harry was on him again, spinning him round and pressing his face into the cold metal wall. “How fucking dare you.” Harry snarled into his ear, feeling him tense with fear.
“No, I'm fine. I just…” he bit his lip, unable to articulate the tornado of feelings in his mind, but everything stopped when Potter pulled him into a tight hug.
Draco was absent, he noticed. Pansy told Flitwick that Draco was ill and in bed with a nasty cold, the little professor encouraging her to send him to Madam Pomfrey. Harry observed the Slytherins out of the corner of his eye. Crabbe was there with Goyle, struggling with their Charms work but completely fine otherwise, Pansy glanced at Draco’s empty seat a couple of times, speaking to Blaise, who looked…angry? He shot a couple of evil looks at Crabbe, probably blaming him for letting Draco get sick. Harry’s stomach was all guilty sickness and knots, barely able to eat a crumb most of the day. His friends asked him a few times what was wrong but they soon gave up, knowing it was pointless.
“Shit. This is what happens…?” Harry muttered, shocked, though Draco probably hadn't heard him. He was curling into himself, his shaking so bad he could hardly stand. Harry grabbed him around the waist, ignoring his little gasps, and forced his mind to think.
"Excellent." Draco said, stiffly, glancing over at the other Slytherins. "We'll meet you in the Entrance Hall at 2 o'clock then. " He said with a nod. Harry finally returned to his own body and nodded too.
“Yes, sir. Harry Potter attacked Draco… He’s covered in bruises and…Draco said Potter…he said Potter raped him, sir.” He lowered his eyes as he said this last painful thing, his fists and jaw clenched to stop himself screaming. There was silence for a moment, he couldn’t see their expressions but he imagined they would be similar to Madam Pomfrey’s – shock and sadness. Potter was completely silent. Say something, you coward. Blaise thought angrily, watching him from the corner of his eyes. His head was down, his fists were clenched too, shaking.
“Oh, right… You can wear my robes for now, I’ll walk you back under my invisibility cloak.” Harry said. Draco turned to look at him, and nodded, looking down before turning away. Harry sighed, yawned, and moved to sit on the edge of the bed to put his shoes back on. Thinking about it, he pulled his socks off and held them out to Draco. “Put these on, your feet must be freezing.” He said imperiously. Draco looked at the socks, his nose wrinkling with mild disgust, but took them and pulled them onto his obviously cold feet. Harry smirked and put his shoes on his bare feet, strangely reminded of the day he set Dobby free from the Malfoy family.
"I mean… yeah, in a way. I'm protecting him from Anthony and that, but I'm helping him with… the other thing as well. So he doesn't need them anymore." He said. Ron nodded slowly, brow furrowed in thought.
Finally, Ron stood up, rather menacing as his height dwarfed Draco's sitting position. Then he gave a nod, speaking to Harry.
“Sorry...” Blaise said gently, his own wand appearing over the basin and he whispered ‘frigida minimus’ when he saw Draco’s hands were pink under the crystal surface. Draco withdrew his hands after a moment, the water feeling too cold again. He dried them on the dark green towel, and looked at Blaise with sad eyes. Blaise smiled sadly back, carefully taking his hand, skin still hot from the water but rapidly cooling, and was glad when Draco didn’t pull away. They went back to Blaise’s bed and Blaise got back in, holding the quilt open for Draco to join him. Draco looked nervously at the inviting space on the mattress, wanting so badly to be comfortable and warm but afraid of the body already there, even though this body had never hurt him. He'd vacated the same space only moments ago, his skin crawling with unspoken horrors, even a single slightest brushing of skin against the boy beside him in the narrow bed made him want to scream, yet he missed Blaise's presence and warmth immediately.
By 2 o'clock, the weather had turned again so they attended Sunday lunch as usual at 3, eating at their respective tables since it was too busy for them to pile onto each other's. Both Harry and Draco were disappointed, sending each other not-so-covert glances across the room and blushing every time. Both sets of friends noticed and teased them fondly.

Harry’s belt was undone, and his cock fell out, pressed between Draco’s arse cheeks once again. It was hard already, though Harry felt no arousal at all, and Draco was screaming, fingernails scrabbling against the wood of the desk. The Monster tutted, lamenting the lack of magical silencers at its disposal, and forced Draco onto his back on the desk, tugging his hair and arms. Harry’s eyes met the huge grey ones, tears rolling down his face as he cried, unashamed and desperate. The utter terror in Draco’s face was horrifying to Harry, but delightful to his Monster. One of Harry’s hands pressed itself over Draco’s mouth, sufficiently muffling his screams for help.
He wasn’t crying, but he wanted to, Harry could see that, plain as day. “He owns me…” he said softly, looking down. The moment the first tear fell, Harry darted forward and pulled Draco Malfoy into his arms to hug him. Draco didn’t even try to resist, crying into Harry’s shoulder. He was almost completely silent, his tears only apparent when Harry’s shirt became damp under his head. He hugged Draco tightly, rubbing his bony back through his own robes.
He had regretted coming back into the castle immediately. Since he'd been allowed back into student life, he'd used the Marauder’s map to actively avoid Draco and his friends whenever he could. He was convinced Goyle would try to beat him up if they ever crossed paths and he wouldn't put it past Pansy to send a nasty hex his way. Blaise's priority was clearly Draco, and Harry had no wish to make things worse for the Malfoy boy.
any good memories!" The blond boy sobbed brokenly. That hit Blaise like a rogue bludger to the gut. Did Draco truly have nothing in his life to remember happily? True, he'd never been able to produce a Patronas…and they all knew his family wasn't exactly the laughing type but...
“No, no,” Draco shook his head, “it’s quite clear to me that Shelley was a necromancer. She merely adapted her story to capitalise on the fears of her society.”
His mother had tried her best but eventually she couldn’t take it. She’d moved to France, avoiding anyone she could. She’d asked Draco to come with her, but he’d declined. Perhaps he should’ve gone with her, made a fresh start. He just couldn’t seem to leave the manor, like it trapped him, like he’d forever be a part of the events that had happened there. Pansy, he’d seen a few times, and Blaise, though they never stayed over long. They didn’t seem to enjoy their time at the manor any more than he did and these days, he rarely left the house, despite his feelings towards it. He didn’t even want to think about Astoria. Their relationship had collapsed almost as soon as it had begun, their marital ‘arrangement’ lasting no longer than a year and a half.
“Do you think,” he started, but cut himself off. Harry checked behind his shoulder, small smile, arched eyebrow.
“I’m gay, Potter.” Draco was beginning to feel overwhelmed. “I like men, males. Wizards. Whatever you want to call them. What do you need, proof?”
Potter’s arms wrapped around his waist, breath against his ear, head on his shoulder. He almost shivered. It was beyond dreaming.
Their laughter died into a comfortable silence, broken only by the sound of crickets, clinging to stems in the undergrowth.
If Harry was a kite, Hermione was the rock at the end of the string, making sure he didn’t fly too far into the sun.
“Malfoy…” Harry was propped up on his elbows, staring at Draco, sprawled across from him on the floor. Draco scrambled to his feet turning away from Potter and walking briskly towards the reception desk. He was done for today.
Malfoy just pointed in front of him. Harry almost let go of Malfoy when he saw what had left him so shaken. He managed to hold on, Malfoy clutching his robes for dear life.
He and Draco, they could never escape what they were to one another. Now more than ever, that they were talking, actually getting to know each other. Now that he knew Draco might feel the same way as he did.
“Kinda? It was entirely my idea, Potter.” Ah, there was the familiar drawl. “No, but you really did help me.” Draco’s voice was soft, sincere, and Harry’s heart leapt to his throat. “You gave me the courage to call them again. I’ve…been so afraid of judgement. I’ve always been a coward.”
Potter was unphased. “Are you sure?” his green eyes glinted with that arrogant mischief Draco never could bring himself to despise. “’Gently, he lowered me down against the desk, auburn hair like fire falling over his eyes, lips plump—sound familiar?”
“Ah,” said Pansy, “yes, of course.” Some kind of non-verbal communication passed between the two, and Harry stared as Pansy squinted her eyes in varying different ways. Eventually Draco sighed, nodded, sighed. He waved his hand flippantly and Pansy grinned in triumph. Clearly, she’d won whatever staring contest they’d been having. “Blaise, we’re leaving!” Pansy called, “Draco’s found his new muse.”
Draco just smiled, though it didn’t reach his eyes. “Yes,” he said, “because nobody would have a reason to hurt me now would they?”
Harry felt his cheeks burn. He’d been staring for too long. He plopped into the armchair behind him. He stared around the room. He felt exposed.
Draco gulped, his eyes wild. It was only then, after Harry had stood there, panting, that he realised what he’d just said.
The gates were wide open this time, the metal bars twisting over each other. They looked nonetheless menacing, barring Harry’s path with a haughty malice.
The house elf nodded, her forehead creased with worry. “Master Draco is dreadfully shaken,” the elf said, “can Keesy ask, what happened with Mr Potter?”
“Here,” Harry said, passing him the spoon, “you stir that around and I’ll just finish with the ham.”
Hermione nodded determinedly. She didn’t say anything more, but Harry knew that she was offering her support.
Potter’s deep green eyes told Draco he didn’t. He nodded slowly, hands slipping away from Potter’s grasp.
Harry shrugged, doing his best to pretend that the prospect didn’t excite him. “I don’t know. Maybe.”
“We’ll apparate after I’ve locked up,” Draco said, “we should be able to do it from here, it’s late enough.”
George was the first to greet him; he’d started hugging a lot more after the war, and he clapped Harry rather heartily on the back. Molly had been rather perturbed when George had first dyed his hair a dark, yet still noticeable purple, but she’d quickly let the matter drop when George had been able to look at his reflection again. His smile was still the same as it used to be, but there was now a haunted look deep within his eyes and not everyone could stomach holding his gaze for very long. Still, he’d managed to retain his mischievous streak and Harry was certain it’s what Fred would’ve wanted.
Potter barked out an incredulous laugh. “’Expressed concern,’” he mimicked, “the only think you were concerned with was making sure I served detention.”
Harry forced a strained laugh. They should be enemies, him and Malfoy. Maybe Harry had been enchanted.
“I don’t see why you’d even think of me.” He sat back in his chair, digging his toe into the carpet like a petulant child.
So, Harry Potter looked away, deciding he would wait. However, he could get close to what he wanted, even if he couldn’t have it just yet.
Draco bristled. Damn Potter. “I was under the impression that this was your new job,” he forced himself to say, “would you really like me to fire you?”
“Oh.” Draco looked at his thumbs. Astoria. “Pureblood tradition requires an heir.” Draco’s shoulders sagged. “My parents had, well, they’d arranged a marriage between Astoria and I. We decided to maintain a…flexible marriage, but I grew too careless for her, too distant. There was no façade worth sustaining, everybody could already see through it. She left me and I ran. Ran by staying where I was, I suppose.” He chuckled, breathy. “Withdrew, is probably a better word. I withdrew.”
Draco frowned. Snitched? Was this a fancy Quidditch metaphor? “I presume you’re referring to how I expressed my concern for your safety to Professor McGonagall?”
He wondered how Draco felt inside the manor, alone in its shadowed halls. He wondered if Draco’s thank you had more than one meaning.
Harry glared at him. “Why am I here Malfoy?” he was beginning to feel his confidence blossom back, sprouting new buds of irritation.
His loneliness was pathetic, he knew that, but he couldn’t help it. Emotion was the one thing he’d never quite been able to force down, no matter how hard his Father pressured him to do so.
Harry didn’t go to Hermione immediately, as really he should’ve done. Instead, he decided to return to Grimmauld, to steel himself, he supposed. Hermione could wait another day. She probably wouldn’t think Draco had kidnapped him until at least a whole week, seven days, had passed.
“Look,” Harry lurched forwards, decided against it, fiddling with his hands. “Look, you did some really shitty things, but so did I. If you say you didn’t react to get Hagrid fired, I’ll believe you.”
“Potter, if I wanted you dead, I would have found a much more elaborate way to do it.” Draco smirked. “Besides, you’d already be dead.”
It’d been nice, having Harry at the mansion. Domestic, even. Harry had cooked one night, the muggle way in fact, and Draco had tried to help, though he was rather, he hated to admit it, hopeless.
Ginny smiled, but it was weak, faltering, replaced with a hollow grimace. Guilt hung heavy in the air. “Luna.”
Harry frowned. Those were mighty fine words coming from a woman who had just doused his head in flour. She placed her hands on her hips and smiled warmly, taking a step back as if to get a better look at him.
Draco cleared his throat and Potter spun around to face him. His shoulders visibly relaxed when he realised the new arrival was only Draco.
“No,” Malfoy said, “I can take it from here.” Harry winced, unsure as to why he’d upset Malfoy, but he understood that he had.
Ah, Draco thought, here comes the storm. Draco hadn’t brought it up yet, he remembered his own divorce and understood that Harry would need time, but it had been four days since his drunken incident and evidently, Hermione Granger was beginning to worry.
Harry bit his tongue to stop himself saying. "Finally," he said instead, "something the great Draco Malfoy admits he doesn't know."
“Wizards.” Her lips curled up into a smirk and Draco felt a sudden chill scrape its way down his back. He swallowed.
“He…he is?” Harry’d expected Malfoy to be doing, well, something, not just sitting there waiting for him to return.
Keesey looked conflicted but she nodded all the same, curtseying before she whizzed away to wherever it was she liked to spend her time when she wasn’t dusting cobwebs from the manor.
“No, no, it’s nothing,” he said, placing a hand upon Keesy’s shoulder, “I’m just meeting someone, properly, for the first time in a long while.”
Eventually, they found their way to a quaint little building, two stories high with a little shrub garden outside the door. Potter gaped.
“You’re right,” Harry sighed, “you’re right. It’s just, just, it’s been nice. You know? To be here, forget about all that.” He waved his hand in an absent gesture.
I'm still alive! I'm so sorry this chapter's so late! My sibling gave me COVID and I was super sick. BUT I'm back now! And, I have new inspiration and should be back to a normal posting schedule.
“I freed them.” Harry’s brows shot to his hairline. “Oh, don’t look so surprised. Can’t you drop your prejudice for five seconds, Potter?”
“You’re threatening me now?” Draco tried not to laugh too much at the sight of Harry’s red cheeks. “I never realised you cared so much about muggle literature.”
A tear slipped over Harry’s cheek. He blinked in surprise, wiping it away, staring at the shine it left on his fingertips. He snorted. Look at him. Tearing up over boiled water.
“Is it the impossible size or your ego, Potter? The reminder of the Dark lord, emblazoned like  a beacon into the very skin of your thick forehead?”
“Who’s this then?” Alicia asked brightly. She always did like to try to pry into his personal life, so it was altogether unsurprising that she wanted to know about this particular matter. She frowned slightly at Potter’s strange appearance. Draco knew his outfit would cause problems. “He your partner?”
“It’s fine.” Malfoy busied himself with collecting some of the papers on the reception desk. “We should get going. It’s almost time to close up.”
Harry stared at the paper. “Dinner?” he asked, quiet at first. “Dinner? Malfoy you have got to be joking.” He jumped to his feet, waving the papers in Malfoy’s face. Malfoy blinked innocently, sipping from his glass.
Draco glanced Harry’s way where he was trying very hard to clean his glasses, inspecting the narrow frames intently. A difficult task to accomplish when you’re practically blind without them.
How he’d felt when he was with Malfoy…it was nothing. He was supposed to hate Malfoy for Merlin’s sake! He really had changed, however, Harry had meant that, and Harry had never been a very good liar. He knew he didn’t hate Malfoy, couldn’t. He sighed, leaning back against the couch. He needed to pull himself together. Especially before he saw Malfoy again. He couldn’t be like this in front of him on Wednesday. Especially not after Malfoy’s horrified reaction, the last time they’d met and gotten close.
They’d stood there, transfixed, when Draco seemed to remember he had a job to get to, and that Harry needed to gather intel for his own.
Ok, so I know it's not exactly canon, and I'm honestly not sure if what Draco did was entirely possible according to magical lore, but I was having a look at "magic reveals" in the Harry Potter books (like how Harry regrew his hair and everything) and I thought that maybe pureblood families like the Malfoys would be looking for something powerful and explosive. J.K never really gave us much backstory on any of the other characters surrounding this kind of thing so I thought I'd have a play around with it.
“I’m glad.” Harry wasn’t sure what else to say. Had it always been like this, their relationship? He was sure he remembered better times, happier times.
“Yes, I know.” Kingsley pinched the bridge of his nose when Harry folded his arms, cocking his head to one side. “We understand that you had a, let’s say tumultuous relationship when you were at Hogwarts—”
“You don’t have to be, you know. Relationships fail all the time, it doesn’t make you any less of a person Harry.”
Harry grinned, opening his mouth to say something more when Keesey popped in, brandishing an envelope.
Harry shrugged, forcing a smile. “Wasn’t much paperwork.” That was true, there hadn’t been. He swallowed. “How was your day?”
“You’re a funeral director dear,” Pansy drawled, “that’s in no way the same thing.” Blaise scowled, grumbling something that sounded suspiciously along the lines of ‘always picking on me.’
Harry was still staring at the spot they’d just vacated when he felt Draco’s hand on his shoulder. “I’m sorry about them,” he said, “they can be—”
Draco’s face fell and he slapped a hand against his forehead. Though, he peeked between his fingers to see Harry’s flushed face and he tried a shy smile instead.
“I—” he started. Licked his lips. “I can’t say I understand completely, what it is you may be experiencing, but having been through a divorce myself, though this doesn’t require nearly as much paperwork I…you need people around you. You can’t push everybody away because you yourself feel helpless.”
Draco jumped as Potter placed a soft hand upon his wrist. “You were just a child. You didn’t understand what you were doing.”
Draco felt his cheeks heat, a combination of shame and hope. “I said I’m fine,” he tried to shake Harry off.
She slapped him on the shoulder, hard. There was a comfortable silence, Ginny biting her lip. “Do you, do you have anyone?”
“Take the hand Potter.” Potter continued to stare, swallowing tightly. Draco sighed. “Imagine it belongs to your girlfriend, if it helps.”
“Shut up Potter.” He leant his head back and closed his eyes, for the first time thankful that there didn’t seem to be many people in the library. Once he’d managed to control his breathing he straightened his back, steepling his hands against his lower lip. “She said wizards.”
Harry swallowed, wincing at the mention of his partner. Their relationship had turned stale months ago. Ginny was his best friend but sometimes he thought that was all she was to him. Sometimes he thought that was all she wanted to be. However, he felt about Ginny, what Kingsley had said was true. No matter how much he wanted to make the world a better place, Harry was neglecting his family. They were too important to him.
“But I’m not a boy!” Teddy tore his arm away, welling up. “I…I don’t want to be a boy. I don’t feel like a boy.”
Draco met his gaze with a weak smile that never quite reached his eyes. “I know,” he said, looked down at the papers on his desk, “I don’t think I’ll ever be able to forgive myself for what I did to you.” His voice was a whisper, scratchy; it didn’t feel like his. “And your friends.” He’d been wanting to say those words for so long and now that he had…the weight was still perched firmly on his shoulders. He’d meant what he’d said about not forgiving.
“We all thought you were.” Harry’s comment should’ve stung, and it would’ve done some time before. He probably would’ve snapped back with a decidedly more venomous retort, but Harry’s expression was soft, and Draco found himself chuckling instead.
Harry smiled at him, her. His Goddaughter. He ruffled Teddy’s hair. “’Course it’s ok, Ted.” Harry paused, “is, Teddy ok?”
Harry frowned. Malfoy was an incredibly talented man. Surely he wasn’t struggling to hold down a job?
Harry cast a tempus, frowned, and then checked his watch. Draco would have to ask him why he did that, at some point. “It’s not that late,” he complained.
Draco kept his footsteps light, smirking as Harry became far too encapsulated by his emotive reading to notice him rounding the corner, sneaking up behind him.
“S’pose I’m just worried that, if I leave Ginny, they won’t want me in their family anymore. Maybe they’ll blame me for the split. It’ll disappoint Molly, for sure.”
“Malfoy I can’t give up my Saturday evenings.” Harry didn’t want to look at Draco’s expression. It wasn’t smug, wasn’t irritated, just drained. “I’ll take the job, but you know I can’t give up time with Ginny.”
He was startled by a sharp knock on the front door, the impatient raps signifying the arrival of Potter. He was late, though surprisingly only by a few minutes.
Draco had always wanted that handshake with Potter, but now, holding his hand, there was nothing that could have prepared him for how easily their fingers slotted together.
He was well aware that he was staring at Malfoy with an idiotic grin, but he felt like he deserved it; he deserved to be happy.
Pansy’s laughter was contagious, to Harry at least; Draco was still standing with a sneer surgically attached to his lips, but Harry was wiping tears from his eyes by the time Blaise finally emerged from the manor, disgruntled as ever.
For now, Draco would settle for the unwavering support of his house-elf and the constant reminder of his self-administered isolation, permanently emblazoned on his wrist, until the day he died.
They still had some air to clear, but the tension was gone. Seeing a man utterly pissed on your doorstep seemed to put a few things into perspective, for both parties involved.
He was startled from his thoughts when Ron slapped him on the side of his arm, grinning like a maniac. “Hey mate, it’s been too long.”
“Potter do you realise how ridiculous you sound?” Draco folded his arms as Potter pranced about gleefully. “Potter this is a public library,” Draco tried exasperatedly, “any number of people could’ve taken out that book.”
“Don’t always get what we want,” Harry said, before launching himself from the desk and offering Draco a hand, “come on then. We’re leaving.”
“Wizards,” the girl repeated with a frown, “do you have any books on Wizards.” She pulled out a battered copy of ‘
After a while Potter stood to his feet, walking sheepishly towards Draco, his ears adorably scarlet. His hands were shoved deep into his pockets, and he looked as if he were about to say something, but Draco cut him off before he could.
Keesy came back with a tray balancing two steaming mugs and a plate of biscuits. She handed one mug to Harry and placed the tray on the table beside Malfoy. Harry wondered whether she was the only house-elf Draco had. He suspected there were others.
“Harry, pleasure,” he said, “it seems I’ll be hanging around Draco for some time,” the bastard actually winked, “expect to see me often.”
"It's not a collection," Draco groaned, burying his face in his hands, "I just like them. We had a few in the back of the library and I was intrigued, that's all."
“Oh Blaise, that would be unfair,” Pansy said, “we all know you’d win as soon as the name ‘Malfoy’ was even mentioned.”
The process was slow, and Draco knew his hand was cold. He watched Harry’s expression shift from bewilderment to something deeper and he squeezed his hand gently, without really considering the consequences.
“Alright,” he said, “alright.” He stroked Teddy’s hair, vowing silently that he’d always be here to protect his Godson. Harry frowned.
Malfoy snorted. “Please,” he said, “you look like you’ve just had yourself a good snog.” Malfoy’s eyes widened. “Not that…not that I’ve ever really thought about what you’d look like after that.”
The sky was a dull orange, ebbing away to lilac behind the curtain of reeds surrounding the burrow, nearby water shimmering as if it were alive with tiny flames.
Eventually, after an outburst, Draco had succeeded in partially exploding a piano stool. Though not as elegant as Lucius might have liked, his son had shown power, potential. He proudly spoke of his son’s achievement, his ascension to the magical world. He just failed to remember that Draco had been unwittingly aiding the growth of his mother’s garden for some time.
“Thank you,” he said. Then, hastily, “Potter.” He pushed Harry out of the door before he could say anything in retort.
Harry blinked, released his group on her hand. Luna. Of course. He remembered how happy Ginny had always sounded, whenever she’d spoken about her. He remembered the way her eyes lit up when Luna spoke, the way she laughed. You could fall in love, just with Ginny’s laugh, and it was never as true as when she laughed for Luna.
“I hope to see you next week,” Draco said, “turn up on time or don’t turn up at all.” He stood up, walking to hold the door open. Once they’d navigated their way to the front door, Draco paused for a moment.
“The pages are all folded,” Potter continued, spinning away as Draco made a grab for the book once again. “You really must love it Malfoy. What is it about it that you love? The danger? The steamy romance?”
“I’ve told you already,” Harry was saying from where he stood by the stove, “you don’t need to worry about it.”
He saluted Draco, nodded to Harry, and started to walk down the driveway. His head was held high as it ever was, and it was difficult to imagine Blaise as anything but somebody extremely important.
“Yes Keesy?” He’d freed the other house-elves, not wanting to be reminded of how his father had treated them. He wished he had done so out of the kindness of his heart, but he hadn’t. He’d freed them because he couldn’t face his own guilt, because he was a coward. Keesy had chosen to stay behind with him – she’d said that she had nowhere else to go. She was an odd one really, always eager to look after him. It was nice, sometimes, to have her company. He didn’t deserve her kindness, not after the way he and his family had treated her. “What is it?” Draco asked.
Regrettable, Harry did need to reply to his friends at some point, and really, he should see them in person. Draco was a practical man, he understood the principles of family, even if he had never had one of his own.
“Malfoy,” Harry began, “are you really sure you need a bodyguard? Do you really think you’re under threat?”
Harry Potter being an asshole tag is pretty real in this chapter but never liked some fics I read that painted him as some kind of saint. That being said, he was definitely provoked.
“Yes, well,” Ginny said, snapping Harry from his thoughts, “there’s a lot about Harry that would surprise you.”
The elf, Keesy, nodded. “Mr Potter is most loyal,” she sighed, “Keesy only worries for Master Draco. He’s this way, sir.” Harry nodded, warmth creeping over his cheeks.
Malfoy’s knees buckled and he looked ready to collapse. Harry caught him with one hand under his arm when Malfoy could stand no longer.
Ginny had told everyone about their split, whilst Harry waited with bated breath. Eventually, though Molly had looked stricken, they were offered support and love and, though Ron would never admit it, some relieved smiles.
“I think the Ministry is rather preoccupied with keeping me under surveillance at all times by the famous Harry Potter,” Malfoy sneered
Draco heard him apparate away, no doubt with a little wave. He closed the door behind him as soon as he could, breathing a sigh of belief. He leant his head back against the door and groaned.
Arthur walked up behind her, a tired and contented smile on his face. His hands were deep inside his trouser pockets.
Malfoy’s brows creased slightly, he regarded Harry with a strange look. “Alright,” he said. Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Did Malfoy just give up without a fight? If Harry couldn’t see it before, there was no doubt in his mind now that something was wrong.
Harry shook his head, spluttering out an irritated scoff. “Anyone else,” this could not be happening to him, “you could’ve chosen anybody else!”
Draco frowned. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure where Potter was. He sighed. He supposed that he’d do well to locate him before the man burned down half the library.
“Get out of my house Potter.” Malfoy’s voice was a whisper, and he was staring directly ahead of him at the wall.
Draco nodded slowly, gazing at the ceiling, unsure of how to react. “It’s nowhere near as impressive as the library at Hogwarts,” he eventually said.
“Oh joy,” Malfoy said, though his cheeks were slightly pink, “scavenging off my purchases now are we Potter?”
Draco stared at Harry. Hurt flickered across his features. He blinked twice. “The same could be said for you, golden boy,” Malfoy's smirk was dangerous, “you and that scar of yours, how on earth does the Weasellette cope?”
Harry choked, shaking his head in disbelief. “The character made a deal with the devil! It wasn’t magic.”
“Sure, but only if you don’t use your wand this time.” Harry patted the kitchen top next to him. “You can watch now if you’d like, there’s still some more to do.”
In pureblood households, the manifestation of magic was supposed to be a significant time in a child’s lifetime, something to be celebrated. Lucius had simply dragged Draco back to the house, imploring his son not to speak of what had just happened.
Potter paused for a moment. “You have?” he asked. Draco almost stopped in his tracks. He hadn’t. Not really. He may have had a rather large, abominable crush on Potter, but he didn’t miss his company. They always fought, Draco just felt resentment, fuelled by years of rejection.
She threw herself at Harry, knocking him backwards as she squeezed his neck. “Thank you, Uncle Harry.”
per se, but he looked strong, healthy, unfairly attractive. Draco had been surprised to see Harry sitting gloomily in the café a few days earlier and, as usual, his original intent had been to humiliate him. Only…he found he couldn’t. A painful ache had settled in the pit of his stomach and his heart had fluttered just as it had done all those times at Hogwarts. Why did it always have to be Potter? The bloody chosen one. He’d already checked over his reflection more times than he could count, and he jittered about like a power drill set loose along the pavement. His excitement was most unbecoming.
Draco was sulking, he’d readily admit that, slouched across the table with his chin on his elbows. “It was pathetic.”
If Harry had looked behind him before he disapparated, he might have seen Draco Malfoy watching him leave from the window, a forlorn expression masking his pale features.
He had to get a hold of himself. He couldn't be crushing on the man who lived, not anymore, that was ridiculous, not to mention unwanted. Potter would probably gag if he ever found the true nature of Draco Malfoy's feelings.
Harry tried to ignore them as he walked past. He paused at the door, lifting his hand up. He could still turn around, never look back. He sighed as his knock echoed emptily down the hall. A small part of him knew that maybe things could’ve been different if he’d tried to help Malfoy in sixth year, instead of hounding him down with the intent to harm, because, if he were completely honest, that had been his intention. Maybe he owed Malfoy, maybe Malfoy owed him.
Harry nodded, biting his lip. “For dinner, I’ll cook,” he looked up again, green meeting silver, “if you’d like that, I mean.”
Harry grinned. “Well,” he said with a grin, “I never thought I’d hear myself say this, but that’s actually very honourable, Malfoy.”
"That would be the point of the word surprise Dumbledore," Fudge cried victoriously thinking inside his head about how if the teachers failed he could plant more spies.
They all started talking after that. As exams ended and everyone was down in the chamber. Bella and the Cullens each shared their stories, and then Bella explained to the Cullen's how she met each of the older wizards.
"Goblins who live in the kingdom look and act different then those who work in the wizarding world. It is because they are around children constantly."
Severus and the kids nodded and entered in their separate ways. almost immediately the great halls eyes were drawn to the group who entered specifically the fact that Harry and Draco were holding hand.
Harry who was extremely pale at that point nodded and quickly hurried after him. When they got to the house he locked his items in the cupboard and ran upstairs already knowing what was awaiting him. Vernon followed after him belt already in hand when suddenly he stopped his eyes lit up green and he turned around.
"the problem is what to do with Umbridge" hermione said, "We can't do anything without dealing with Fudge to. After all he won't let go of his way into Hogwarts."
Harry was devastated as well as Draco whom he had been secretly seeing with the help of Ron and Hermione since their second year. Draco had been one of the few people to believe that he was not the one endangering the school and since then they had begun a fast spiral from friends to boyfriends. Harry was surprised when Ron and Hermione had agreed to help him, but they told him that they had some atonement to do for second year as well as they saw that even though they were young Harry and Draco clearly loved each other. That summer and all the summers after per Severus' and Remus' instruction Harry kept a diary as well as a memory case filled with all of the abuse the Dursleys had done to him. If they had enough evidence then the ministry would have no choice but to put harry into someone else's care, those someones being the people currently in Severus' room discussing the future.
Harry nodded, sucking in a deep breath to compose himself. Bloody Malfoy, always catching him off guard.
Draco had to raise an eyebrow at that. Something was definitely up with Potter’s personal life. He’d find out what, in time.
Harry’s eyes widened. That stung a little, though he wasn’t sure why. Wasn’t he guilty of the same thing? Not now Potter, please God, not right now.
“Stereotyping me again?” Malfoy did his best to look angry, but he sounded hurt, defeated. Harry winced. Draco sighed. “No,” he said, “I suppose your suspicion warranted. If you must know, they left after the war.”
Though it didn’t change the fact that he’d be working with Malfoy in just two days. Malfoy. Would horrors never cease?
He would think about Draco after he sorted everything out with Ginny. There was no time for that now, no matter how he…felt. God.
“Yeah,” Harry swept his heel across the floor with an irritated kick, “well, I didn’t think it’d lead to this.” He shrugged, but his cheeks were stained pink. “Besides,” he said, shuffling in his seat, “I owed his mother a life debt.”
could have left too, had she wanted to,” Malfoy said, emphasising the name, much to Harry’s growing annoyance, “she just chose to stay.”
Draco looked up at Potter, twisting his wrist around to take hold of Harry’s. “You really believe that Potter?”
“My,” his voice came out scratchy and he cleared his throat, “Father thought it best if I learned spells, and magic. He felt this was a job for the house-elves.”
At least Keesy was a help, bustling from room to room, a sort of evangelistic presence, making sure that Draco never strayed too far off the rails. He came close, of course, but never so much that he’d become a lost cause.
“I believe we may have already established that, yes.” Harry looked as if he’d just walked in on Granger snogging Weasel. Come to think of it, he probably had at some point.
Harry pulled him into a gentle embrace. “‘Course Ted.” He thought about Malfoy, alone in his empty manor. “Why wouldn’t I be?”
So we'll have to wait a bit for Harry and Ginny to actually, you know, talk but they'll get there. They just need time.
Harry was quiet, wishing he knew how to reply. “Do you think she loves me?” he asked, eventually. Hermione was silent, finding herself without an answer for the first time in a very long while.
“You know that muggle family I grew up with?” he asked. Draco frowned at himself. They’d probably taught him how. Careless oversight, on his part. “Yeah,” said Harry, bobbing his head, “they weren’t exactly the greatest.”
Ginny was like fire, like a flame. She was unstoppable, gorgeous and knew exactly what she wanted. She had the ability to burn, but she was always there when you needed warmth. After the war, Harry had wanted to slow down. He withdrew, preferring to take time to himself – something he’d never been able to do before. Ginny had thrown herself into Quidditch, soaking up applause and saving the game from her opponents.
“Oh, I’m sure.” Harry pushed himself up on the desk and started to swing himself over to the other side.
Love. Harry had thought about it before. He had, but it was only now, standing beside him that it slammed into him like a tonne of feathers. Feathers, not bricks, because it wasn’t a painful blow, but a blow, nonetheless. It scattered between them, effortlessly, inescapable.
Merlin give him strength. He’d already lent Potter his clothes before but somehow this felt different, intimate, purposeful. “Yes,” he managed, “I’ll have Keesy send them up.”
“It’s just funny you should mention ‘Care of Magical Creatures,’” Harry said, picking at a splinter on the edge of the table.
(Also, yes, I just had to include mildly jealous Harry. I don't like possessiveness, but a little jealously is always fun.)
He loved Hermione, but sometimes her blunt interrogative manner made him wand to snap at her to mind her own business. But without her, as he understood, he’d never have succeeded in the past. Sometimes, her stubborn refusal to accept ‘I don’t want to talk about it’ as an answer was exactly the thing Harry needed. To other people, perhaps, Hermione would seem too intense, too confident in her abilities, but to Harry, she was grounding. Sometimes he needed to be grounded.
Harry could feel Hermione’s eyes on him throughout the day’s proceedings and if he noticed the looks Ron shot him whenever he squirmed at the mention of marriage, he pretended not to have seen them.
She pulled away from him, trying a small smile. “I understand, and I don’t hate you, either,” she said, “though I’m still angry at you, for apparating drunk.”
Harry glared into his abandoned drink. He hated it when Malfoy was right. By now, the coffee had cooled down, the smoke thinner, the dancers dropping as they plummeted softly through the air.
I had to mention Harry's eyes because I always found it odd that everyone just likened them to Lily's all the time. I felt like a lot of people just saw his parents instead of him and that's part of why, excluding the whole 'bested the dark lord as an infant, he never felt like he could just be Harry, without the Potter.
Harry stared as Malfoy dripped a swirl of honey into the tea, stirring it slowly. He slid the cup towards Harry once he was done, leaning forwards across the table.
When he finally arrived home, Harry was met with a heavy curtain of dull silence. They were currently looking after Teddy, just for a few days, whilst Andromeda took some time to herself. Even with Teddy there, however, the house felt drab and impossibly empty. Ginny ghosted through the halls, an empty reflection of the woman Harry had once fallen in love with.
Ok so, the wand throwing deleted scene from the Battle of Hogwarts is not strictly canon but I just kind of really wished it was? Let me know what you thought and stay safe :)
Harry snorted. “I guess you could call it that.” He let the wooden spoon rest against the pot and met Draco’s questioning stare. “They made me cook for them,” he sighed, “sort of like a house-elf. That’s why I’ve never really felt comfortable around them. Could’ve been, suppose it was, me.”
