“Draco, I wish I could have been there for you. I don’t know if I’m angrier at the people that hurt you or at the fact that Dumbledore didn’t end this fucking war faster.” Harry sighed and pulled Draco tighter to his body. He whispered, “Draco Malfoy, I love you and I would do anything for you. I hope you can trust that.”
“No one helped clean the open wounds. No one treated the infections. The wounds were gaping and opened. They tore the skin jaggedly, therefore creating even more scar tissue. I probably came close to dying several times from sepsis... err... systemic infection. I would have fevers for days on end. The pain was excruciating. The pain from the broomstick was nearly as bad as the cruciatus curse. The pain from the infections was less, but more... I mean, it covered a larger area.
“We met when he delivered your invitation,” said Luna. “I’m glad Harry left the handwriting to you, Draco. You both look much improved. I was worried about you.”
“Yeah,” admitted Draco. “Um… I know you want to take this slow and so do I. I mean… I’m not sure what that means.”
Draco replied, “I think we just agreed... with each other... in the affirmative... to get wed at some point in the future.”
when a loud knock came at the door. Harry went over and opened it, finding an irate Pansy Parkinson. He said, “Uh, Draco. There’s someone here for you. Hi Pansy!”
“Well, I’ve rented a two-bedroom flat in Muggle London while my house is being refurbished,” said Harry. “The decorators are finishing up tomorrow morning. I could get a second bed and call for my House Elf?”
Bloody hell! I finally found Harry. Mother suggested that I try the old Black estate in London. I sent the eagle-owl. I transformed a silver statue of a dragon into a harness the owl could wear. If he couldn’t get my message through that would be fine. If someone was intercepting Harry’s owls, Harry might see the dragon emblem and it will remind him of me, Draco, the dragon. I sent my calling card. I couldn’t risk any details that might be seen by the press or other unfriendly eyes.
Harry and I were both afraid of turning each other away with what we might say, even though we were thinking the exact same things. I am still in disbelief of this. It is hard to go against a hatred that most have against people like us. I just hope I don't fit the stereotype of a poofter. Maybe it’s not so bad. Don’t know yet.
Harry was the first to speak, “Draco! You were shouting my name while wanking! What the fuck are you doing here!?”
“No, but you will need to remove those slinky new silk boxers and I’ll remove by new, brightly colored jockey shorts.”
“We had them both over for dinner last night. I just assumed you knew,” said Harry. “Oh! Draco, pass out the
bottom or just the… uh… crack?” said Harry, trying to hold back his laughter. Draco had already burst into laughter.
“Yeah,” said Draco. “We shouldn’t pretend that things never happened, but it always helps to escape for a short periods. Let’s never forget that.”
“I haven’t slept in a real bed in… I don’t know how many hundreds of days. How about we get curry take-away for dinner? Tomorrow we’ll go on a spending spree. We each need a new wardrobe of clothes. How’s that?”
“Merlin!” exclaimed Draco. “You are wise, O savior! That’s deep. So… no promises? Take it day by day? Be honest with each other unless we are too pained to answer certain dark memories?” Harry nodded and hugged Draco harder.
“A credit card?” asked Harry. “Umm... It automatically takes money from my bank account and sends it to the store... electronically.” Draco looked confused. “It means that I can use the card to pay instead of carrying around coins and notes.”
“Can we take this… relationship… slow? I don’t know if I’m in the proper mental state to rush headlong into…”
“I knew the consequences of my actions... or of my mother finding my secured sketchbooks,” said Draco. “It was my choice to not follow their ways. It was
“Dude!” exclaimed Harry. “You came up to your chin, you idiot! Think I can’t see that!? Your semen is soaking into the sheet and your cock is softening.” Harry paused. “Are you—?”
Harry smiled and took Draco’s throbbing cock into his mouth. He worked his tongue in a swirling motion around Draco’s leaky tip. Harry started bobbing up and down, gradually adding more of Draco. Harry’s tongue moved further down Draco’s length, the tongue now encircling Draco’s cock. After a few minutes, Harry pulled away, looked up a Draco, and said, grinning, “Please warn be before… I’m not sure I want a mouthful of Malfoy.”
During his fifth night at the Leaky Cauldron, Harry was lying on his bed trying to fall asleep. Rita Skeeter was getting to him, which was driving him insane. Harry swore he heard his name being called. This was not an unusual occurrence. It was usually caused by some over-enthusiastic newlyweds that had a crush on Harry. He swore he could pick out the voice.
Oh, I forgot (a recurring theme, huh?)… I went to a Muggle porn shop and bought several books on gay sex things. Hopefully, I’ll get some pointers on how to do the nasty and how to give a good blow job.
“The first time Moldy Voldy tried to kill me... when he killed my parents... his soul was fragile and somewhat fractured,” said Harry. “Do you know what a horcrux is?”
Draco dropped the hood on his cloak and gasped. “I’ve never seen anyplace so… warm and inviting. It’s like a doll’s house!”
They took a quick shower together and put their underwear back on. Harry asked, “Draco, would you mind writing an invitation for tomorrow? I’d like to shock them.”
My lovely friends Luna and Harry stood up in public and defended my mother and me. Mother and I took the stand, separately, after Luna and Harry. Fucking hilarious (…dripping with cruel, acerbic sarcasm). What a waking nightmare. The Wizengamot has decided that mother and I are not “not guilty”, but we will “not be prosecuted due to extenuating circumstances.” For me, it was Luna’s testimony that cinched the deal. Harry didn’t hurt either. Mother saved Harry’s life. I don’t think I need to say more about that.
Harry placed his lips on Draco’s and pressed. Almost immediately, they deepened the kiss, tongues battling each other. Draco pulled back after less than a minute. He asked, “Why?”
you threatened Kreacher with clothes… probably your panties. How droll. Fine,” said Draco. “I was expecting a howler. Didn’t you get our owl?”
“Apparently,” laughed Harry. He took Draco’s cloak and put it in the entry-way closet. “Have a seat on the sofa. I’ll get us some tea.”
Draco led the women into the apartment past a stunned Harry. He finally came to and hung up their cloaks. “Welcome to our little home,” said Draco.
“I walked into the Forbidden Forest and sacrificed my life. I let Moldy Voldy kill me. I died but decided to come back to my body. Technically, Moldy only killed the part of himself that lived in me as a result of the first killing curse when I was a baby. I don’t know if I’m still immune from the killing curse. I’m terrified that someone out there will try to find out. I’m still a parselmouth, so I don’t know.”
“You mean,” began Harry, “how did the most skilled legilimens in the British Isles not know that I was being brutally abused? You mean, how did the most powerful Wizard, in charge of my welfare, bring me down and down and down again? You mean, how did the head of a school hang me out for the wolves? He sacrificed me.” Harry sighed, “Albus Dumbledore so believed in the prophecy that it blinded him to reality. That, my dear Draco, is the only way I’ve been able to explain it… however poorly.”
Harry stood up. “They didn’t know I was a poof. Hell, I didn’t know I was a poof. That didn’t stop them from raping me with a broom handle. It’s better than it was. When I started Hogwarts, I had very painful bowel movements. Madame Pomfrey worked her magic to make things better. There aren’t any control issues, but the stretchiness isn’t there. I don’t know if I will be able to be anally penetrated. The spots where there is no hair growth are areas of scar tissue.”
“There were two such Wizards born at the end of July… me... and... Neville Longbottom. He doesn’t know. Dumbledore chose to sacrifice me. I learned about this at the end of our fifth year and into the sixth. Anyway, because of the fucking prophecy, Dumbledore did nothing to stop Moldy except to develop my knowledge and skills. He fed me to the snake man... on purpose. He could have stopped Moldy with his advanced skills and powers, but because of the prophecy, I was to be sacrificed to save the Wizarding world.
It was three weeks after the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry Potter had left the Burrow because he was sick and tired of the immense sadness everyone felt over Fred’s death. He would have gone back to Grimmauld Place, but upon entering the neglected house he thought, “All mirth shall be left on the doorstep by all who enter here.” He couldn’t remember the exact quote, but that would suffice for now. Harry took up lodgings at the Leaky Cauldron. He knew it wouldn’t give him privacy, but he had a lot of work to do in Diagon Alley in trying to find magical housing contractors and such. He also had to work with Gringotts to inventory his vaults.
Narcissa Malfoy nee Black and Lucius Malfoy (Grantors), for and in consideration of: One Galleon, release and quitclaim to the Grantee:
“And a comfortable dog bed for Kreacher,” laughed Harry. “Um... Draco...? I... um... would you mind if I… tried something?”
Harry nodded. “Let’s get back to our guests.” The two men went reentered the sitting room. “I’m sorry gals. I got a little emotional and didn’t want to cry in front of our guests. I was... overwhelmed.”
Harry was back in a few minutes with a stout pot of tea and several biscuits. He sat the tray down on the table in front of the sofa, rattling the teacups as he sat it down. “C’mere, Harry. I’ll pour out. Two sugars and cream?” asked Draco. Harry nodded. He watched Draco with his thin, pale hands, gently pour out tea for the pair of them. Harry thought he noticed a slight tremor to Draco’s hand.
Lots of things on my mind. Who am I? I’m not the Draco that everyone thinks I am. I’ve always put up the façade of confidence so that others would not be able to peer in and see my weaknesses or emotions. THAT is the life of a Malfoy. We don’t make mistakes. We blame others for our mistakes. Well… fuck that! No more.
“I’m sick of secrets,” said Draco. “Secrets caused all of this angst and pain. Thank you for telling me that story. It was lovely, yet tragic.”
“It means that we are going to have a hell of a lot of work to get to know each other and to be able to stand each other. We can’t just base the whole relationship on sex.”
Oh, I was afraid that my dick was too small, but Harry’s ended up being the same size! Oh, how relieved I was. It’s six inches hard. I just measured. I was so nervous about that… no one would ever believe.
“That she found my sketchbooks and broke into them?” said Draco. “Yes, that is true. She broke a complex privacy spell. I know how skilled she is at doing such things. I used to hide those books, not keeping them in plain sight. Well, I let down my guards in the last few months. I was exhausted and tired of the dark world. I didn’t have the energy to care about hiding them anymore. I kept them spelled shut, but not hidden from view.
“If I would burn a piece of toast... If I would drop a crumb on the floor... If I would talk back... If I glared at any of them... If I didn’t do something they didn’t tell me about...
“The Burrow,” said Draco. “You need to be with family... and I want to meet my new family. Did you let them know about the
“Lay on your left side,” instructed Draco. “I’ll be here behind you but won’t touch your bum.” Draco shimmied up so that his chest was against Harry’s back. “Make a small space between your thighs, so I can get it in there.”
Dear Mr. Journal, I haven’t written my thoughts and feelings down for over a year. I’m starting this new journal so that my grandchildren may learn more about their grandfather. Of course, I don’t want kids, so I won’t have grandkids. As this is an historical account, I will introduce all of my abbreviations as they occur.
“I’ve been waiting to do that for a long time. Guess be both had short fuses today.” Harry quickly kissed Draco on the lips. “Draco, do you need anything?”
“I used to blame myself for the abuse. I knew in some way that it wasn’t normal to treat a child that way. I mean, they didn’t treat their own spoiled kid that way. It took a lot of counseling at Hogwarts for me to understand that it was
“Well, I hardly think either of us want to visit any magical areas anytime soon,” said Harry. “Before you say anything, you need to know that you will owe me nothing, but I will keep an accounting, as I’m sure you’ll wish me so to do.”
Pansy, still drying her eyes, said, “You! Don’t you remember!? You told her I had Wrackspurts in my… Well… she said that’s impossible because they’re only in your head, not…
Draco pulled down his own boxers, exposing his hardening cock. “Jokey shorts off. We’ll need some lube, and I can’t reach my wand from here.”
Grantors do hereby convey, release, and quitclaim all the Grantor’s rights, title, responsibilities, and interest and to the above-described claims of the Grantee.
Rita Skeeter (Hogsmeade). This reporter continues to be turned away from Hogwarts since the Battle. Fortunately, many of our Savior’s former classmates have been more than candid with this reporter about his actions. It appears that Potter is a well-known poofter. We have it on good authority that Potter can frequently be seen lifting shirts and staring at arses. Fellow Gryffindors confirm to us that Potter’s breakup with the youngest Weasley was not due to the negligence of her affectations, but his phallus worship.
I must admit that at times I was very suicidal. No one ever suspected. I have always joked about plunging a knife into my chest, but no one knew when that joke was no longer a joke. I still remember the time when I could, for the first time, see that knife puncturing my heart, causing my death. My question to the “straights”: how many people actually take their lives from the pressure you put on them?
“Sex should be between two consenting adults trying to please each other, at a minimum. Making love to a person requires an intense attraction, the sharing of feelings and emotions, and tenderness. So, in my mind, I have not had sex. No intercourse. No blowjobs. No mutual masturbation. Nothing. Does that make sense?” Draco was now shaking and crying.
“You mean the lack of stiffness in your pants when we snogged?” asked Ginny. “Yeah. S’okay. I figured that you just needed time to figure it all out. Draco, I assume?”
“He’s still here,” said Draco. “He’s just doesn’t fear for his life every day. He doesn’t have a physically abusive father who continually beats him. He doesn’t have to live up to extraordinarily high expectations and standards. He doesn’t have friends who only like him for his money and family’s station in society. He isn’t constantly worried about how a desperate crush he has on a raven-haired man with sparkling green eyes.” Draco paused. “He’s got a lot less stress, and he doesn’t have to pretend to be someone he isn’t.”
“When we met in Madame Malkin’s that first time, I had only known that I was a Wizard for less than 12 hours,” said Harry. Draco gasped. “Dumbledore decided I should be left with my Muggle aunt, uncle, and their little prat of a son. Hagrid transported me from Godric’s Hollow to the house in hell. McGonagall was against the plan.
Harry flipped through the top sketchbook slowly. When finished, he raised his eyes, now wet with tears, and looked at Draco. In a strained voice Harry said, “They’re beautiful. I had no idea.”
“Harry, really!?” scolded Hermione, as if he should know better than to ask. “Everyone’s fine with you being gay. It didn’t shock anyone that you’ve fallen for Draco. I mean, come on! Ron shook Draco’s hand.”
“We’ll talk about your salary and your budget for forensic accountants and solicitors later tonight,” said Harry.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “So... my aunt Petunia was fiercely jealous of my mother’s magical abilities. In her mind, magical abilities made one deviant... weird... odd… dangerous. Her husband, Vernon Dursley, only fueled that fury once I came along. They passed those tenets to their fucking bastard of a son, Dudley.
“Please, sit,” said Harry, nervously. He looked into Draco’s steel-grey eyes. “You’re shaking… like me. Scared? I’m terrified.”
Okay… now the hard part. What to do…. I wish Harry would contact me. I need to talk to someone about this… He is the only one available. I need to talk. I am literally going crazy thinking about this. I am horny 24 x 7 and cannot think of anything else. HELP!!! Am I gay… (ughhh… that word… yeah… don’t like it yet). Do I like girls??? Not as much as boys. Has been that way for a long time. I guess I have been attracted to guys for quite a while… since about second year? Who knows? I just have this overwhelming attraction to the same sex for a while. What should I do? Only Harry knows (well, now mother). Last Tuesday was special. That hour of pleasure is truly what I want… I think… Help! I need help. I feel like I need to tell someone my own age. I need to talk to someone. Not ready to talk to Lucius, although I can’t because he’s in Azkaban. Lucius is a goddam bigot. I think I truly hate him. He just pisses me off so… He does everything to make me mad. That pisses me off. Oh well… just more built-up stuff in my head. I need it shrunk at a head shrinker. Do we have magical psychologists? I want a meaningful relationship. Maybe with Harry. Maybe with someone else. Where do I go? What do I do? How do I ward off the ridicule? How do I let the world know that I am… yeah… that. HOW??? WHY??? HELP!!!!!!!
“I already told you about the beatings, forced fasts, being locked in the cupboard, being fed table scraps, etc. Let’s delve deeper. I don’t want to hide this from you. I fear doing so may become... toxic.
“Kreacher,” said Harry. “We also had a little help from a solicitor that had a falling out with Draco’s family. There’s another little part of the story that could keep her out of the newspaper business forever. Draco.”
Much of my fear of poofterdom stemmed from the treatment of gays in our society. The American (home of the free indeed!) sayings, “Liberty and Justice for All” and “All men are created equal,” are just bullshit. The treatment of gays in the UK is just as horrible. I was so afraid of people labeling me as: “that cock-sucking faggot fucker.” I don’t appreciate things like that.
Draco nodded. He grabbed Harry into a passionate kiss. “And tomorrow morning,” began Draco, “we go shopping for towels and bedding.”
“So,” Harry began after a long silence. “You’ve been turned out by your mother. I’m sorry. I know how much you love her.”
“Really!?” asked Harry, rather incredulously. Draco nodded. “Please, I think you also know now that I can’t handle enclosed spaces or bondage-type things. I have panic attacks when I hear a whip.”
Kreacher said, “The Headmistress said that Kreacher would be welcomed back at any time. Kreacher likes Hogwarts.”
“Come on in, dear,” said Molly. “A friend of Draco is a friend of ours.” Pansy promptly fainted into the arms of Harry, who had sent a patronus behind Pansy’s back that everyone either ignored or didn’t see.
It has been a long twelve months. I didn’t go back to Hogwarts for my sixth year. Instead, I helped my family house the Dark Lord (V). The Manor is now a qualified disaster area. Those filthy Death Eaters and catchers were here day and night. Talk about rude, unhygienic, uncouth Witches and Wizards! I can still smell their foul stench. Six of our twelve House Elves were killed for pure pleasure. They provided good sustenance for Nagini, V’s snake. That all is for another book.
There was also this tape labelled with the word “Cake” with miscellaneous stuff on it. Cake is yummy, but is that the artist or group? No idea. It’s a bootlegged demo (is that possible?) that has a wonderful song with the line… "As soon as you're born you start dying, so ya might as well have a good time..." I want to live like that.
As soon as Harry did so, Draco slipped his cock between Harry’s inner-thighs. “Okay,” said Draco. You can relax your legs a little. Draco began sliding his cock back and forth between Harry’s inner thighs, just below Harry’s bollocks.
This reporter knows that the young man has received no one of any exceptional repute in his few days at the Leaky. He’s been seen coming and going from Gringotts and several Magical contractors’ establishments. It’s also been reported to this reporter that the killer of the dark one has been seen in the Minister for Magic’s office. We have evidence that Mr. Potter has been negotiating with Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt for a less than deserved Order of Merlin, First Class. Will he get it? This reporter will not rest until the weird comings and goings of Harry Potter have been solved. Several members of the Weasley family have refused to answer our requests for comment.
Guess it didn’t surprise her too much. She asked if it was Harry (freaking) Potter. I nodded. She hugged me. Since, she has been very supportive, but we both agreed that Lucius need not know. I’m calling him Lucius now. I hate that bastard. He doesn’t deserve to my father.
“Must be the new clothes that actually fit.” Changing topics, Harry said, “It sounds like your monthly visitor has passed, no?”
“It’s okay, Draco. I understand. We both agreed on the articles. They will help stop certain ridiculous speculations. Are you having any regrets?”
“You realize that only three people have ever been recorded as being able to cast a wordless patronus with a wand,” stated Draco.
“I’m happy too,” said Draco. “Whatever we have here is eclipsing the pain I should be feeling right now. I can’t say that I’m… fixed…? But I’m doing a lot better. There will be struggles, I’m sure.”
“That’s far from selfish, Draco,” said Harry. “It’s self-preservation, no? You were saving yourself from a lifetime of mental torture, pain, and yearning. I can’t blame you for that. It took a lot of courage to come out to your family. You must have known what the worst-case scenario was.”
Well....you, Mr. Journal, are number three to know. I always knew that I was different… that way. Then in second year, I started noticing that I was attracted to the same sex. I kept it bottled up for over 5 years until that night after the battle. Harry talked to me the next day (Monday) once he had woken up. We talked a little about it. Then he and I went down to Hogsmeade to pick up some supplies… We walked back to Hogwarts alone with our goods. We talked more.
“You mentioned courting,” said Ginny. “You’re not going through all of those Pureblood wooing and courting rituals, are you?”
Harry hummed. “Guess so.” After a moment of peaceful silence, Harry asked, “Who are you and what did you do with the Draco Malfoy I discovered at Madame Malkins all those years ago?”
“Would you mind continuing our conversation in a reclined position?” asked Harry, bashfully. Draco drug Harry into the bedroom, with Harry closing the door on the way in. They laid down on the bed on their backs, each man more than a foot apart. They clasped their closest hands. Harry turned towards Draco and said, “This is a small flat, Draco. There’s no way you will never see me… uh… without a shirt… especially if you are lifting it.”
Okay… I want to find Harry. I have tried everything to find him. I even sent an owl to Weasleyville. He’s not there. Yikes! I want him. I am almost sure of that now. Wow. Big step… Am I going too fast….? Gotta see what he is up to. I think I love him. Need to talk to him. Got to…. Big decision… I think it is for me (the decision to live as a poof). Is it a decision? I’m not entirely convinced. I think I just AM. Fuck! Why isn’t anything easy for me???
“I used to cook breakfast for them and was not allowed to consume what I created. I was always fed the least of the people in that house. I never had my own clothes. Those that you made fun of, and rightly so, were hand-me-downs from my garishly piggy cousin, Dudley.
“A little, but that wasn’t the main reason. Hermione, Ron, and I thought he was just an evil git… and you,” admitted Harry. “How wrong we were.”
intuition,” said Harry. “She’s a better seer than Trelawney will ever be!” A thought struck Harry and he turned away from Draco. “Draco! Draco. Oh, shit! I’m so sorry. I forgot… I mean… I didn’t think… I didn’t—”
Although the Grantee has renounced his familial duties and obligations and his societal duties, the Grantors shall consider this Contract to come into force Sixty Days hence by the Grantee’s lack of conciliation.
Harry smiled and said, “Let’s just say that love makes strange bedfellows. You’re down. I’m down. Maybe we can pick each other up. I don’t know. I’m nervous because I’m so worried that this won’t work out. I need it to work out. I’m willing to give it everything I’ve got; I’ll have you know.” Harry tapped Draco’s nose with his index finger.
“Our tea is getting cold. Let me heat it.” Harry broke away from Draco and aimed his wand at each teacup.
Muffled, through the thin walls, Harry heard, “Potter! Oh! Potter! Harry!” Annoyed, Harry exited his room to find the sound. Someone was fucking with him. Harry used a silent alohomora to slip silently into the room next door and startle the wanker. Once inside, Harry silently cast a sound blocking charm and lit his wand. “Malfoy!”
“No. I slept on the hard, cold floor with nothing more than a sheet underneath me. Sometimes they locked me in there... for days on end. No food. No water. Lots of spiders. Once I got my own bedroom, at some point they put bars on the windows, locked me in there, and created a cat door to push through cold, condensed, tinned soup. The tea was always cold.
I am not “openly gay.” I am not a “biological error.” I do not pray on children. You cannot make me love women. I am just a boy who likes other boys. That’s all there is to it. That is all I know. And that is cool.
Molly pulled Harry into her arms and hugged the stuffing out of him. She kissed Harry on the cheek. “You’re family, love. You and your boyfriend will always be welcome here.”
“Kreacher, would you be comfortable living here and serving us?” asked Harry. “I would like you here.”
“We’ll see,” said Draco, honestly. “I’m not sure how long it will take to straighten out Harry’s finances.”
I saw Harry and fought on his side in the battle. He was hot, but I kept hearing about all of the women he had slept with (back when we were in school… not true, by the way). I noticed him looking me up and down more than once after the battle. I obviously thought something of this. I really wanted this hot boy and I thought he wanted me.
Draco sat up, and Harry crawled behind him to hold the love of his life. Draco settled into Harry’s warmth.
Kreacher scratched his chin, bowed, and said, “For Master Harry, Kreacher will do anything. He saved us.”
Harry said, “Please go to the Burrow and invite Hermione and Ronald for dinner tomorrow evening at six for pre-dinner drinks.”
Harry wrapped his hand delicately around Draco’s ragingly pale erection. Draco took Harry’s with a firm grip. They gently snogged each other while jerking the other off whilst moaning and babbling the other’s name. It was but five minutes before each man was spent. Harry cleaned them both with his wand and pulled his y-fronts and jeans back up.
“Okay, Kreacher,” said Harry. “Please be kind to Draco. Remember, he’s an heir of the Black family, albeit disinherited. Do you have a problem with that?”
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and began his story, “Once upon a time, in a land far, far away… err… thirty-five years ago in Surrey… there were two young sisters born of Muggle parents. They had the names of flowers, but one was neither as delicate as a flower nor as beautiful. The evil Muggle sister, Petunia, looked like a horse. Lily had sparkling green eyes that were filled with magic.
“Me too,” said Draco. “I can’t believe it’s only been a little over a week. I feel like I’m in a fairy tale.”
“There will be a lot of girls and women who will be disappointed,” said Luna. “Does Pansy know, Draco?”
“What about George and Pansy, huh?” asked Draco. “I always figured Pansy was a bit of a dyke, but George!”
Then came the “pervert” magazines I bought. They all featured hot young guys. For the first time I was letting my poofy feelings rush out of my body. Actually, they mostly exploded onto my stomach in the form of that white creamy goodness.
“Sounds a lot like my situation… although, I would have made it sound a bit more… posh,” teased Draco.
“So, my loving uncle came up to shove a broomstick up my arse. I have since found out that scars get much worse under certain scenarios. One, repeated injury to one location. Two, untreated open wounds. Three, infection. Four, persistent infection. Five, untreated infection. Six, slow healing wounds.
It could go somewhere from here, but I am unsure about that at present. At least, it was a new experience. I can now say that I know the size of Harry Potter’s penis… just kidding. I haven’t told anyone what happened or about what I am thinking. I am not sure if I should. I think I need to sort some things out first. I would never mention your name unless you want that. Right now, and for a long while, I just want to keep this between us. Okay? Thanks.
“Slightly fluffy hills with a lush valley,” said Kreacher. “Good night, gentlemen.” He turned and left a laughing Harry and Draco to themselves.
Being gay doesn’t mean we are any different from other people. The “straights” must get that through their heads. I just want to live in a world in which it doesn’t matter who you wanna be with. We should all just be able to be cool boys without people viewing us as “freaks.”
Harry grabbed Draco’s hardness and said, “Hands first, clothes on. There are… scars… quite deep ones… I need to explain them, but not now.”
“The shaft on a Muggle broom is about an inch in diameter,” said Harry. He bent down, touching his toes, exposing his anal area. Draco squeaked, shocked. He didn’t know what he was looking at. Draco only knew that it was the result of something despicable.
“It appears so. Complex spells are quite draining, however,” said Harry. “A patronus will drain me for a several hours.”
I am gay. That is all I know. I will say this one thing: no one or no thing made me gay. That is my stand on the subject. If I could pinpoint the time that I first noticed my poofy feelings, it would have to be in the second year, but I think I’ve told you, Mr. Journal, that before. I was interested in the male physique. I lusted over other guys. They just really turned me on… like nothing else. I just dismissed it as a minor curiosity. I kept doing this until a week ago. Oh, how stupid I was!
“Luna talked a lot about you after… she… was rescued,” sighed Harry. “She told me something similar. I never directly confided…”
Harry pulled up his y-fronts and motioned for Draco to lay back down on the bed. Once both men were in bed, Harry pulled Draco into a strong embrace and let him cry into his shoulder.
“So, why the article?” asked Draco. “I know you wanted to announce our love and end the rumors. Is this just a big
Harry was thoroughly confused, but shrugged and said, “I guess I just have that effect on people. I come out and the rest of the world follows.”
“About that,” began Draco seriously, “Harry and I nearly wet ourselves last night whilst hearing about something abundantly fluffy. What was it, Harry?”
After the Battle was over, Harry Poter (Harry) sought me out in the Great Hall, I think. Maybe I was just near him. Anyway, we were both sweaty, smelly, dusty, and dirty. We hugged emotionally and cheered in each other’s arms. It was erotic and exotic and… wonderful. He has this strong intoxicating scent. I never thought I’d like icky sweaty men that hadn’t bathed in days. I was in the same condition and he didn’t seem to mind.
“Poofter Potter has rented a flat in Muggle London and is moving in with one Draco Malfoy today,” said Harry. Hermione and Ron gasped.
“That’s saying something!” exclaimed Ginny. “I hate to ask Draco, but have you heard from your mother?”
“Oh!” said Draco. “Quite convenient. Muggles seem to have many things that would improve our lives, no?”
“The young boy attended the same school as his parents where he found a teacher of potion making, an absolute git. The teacher really, really hated the green-eyed young man. Severus, the teacher, never fell out of love with Lily. He also never stopped hating James. Lily and James were dead, but the teacher’s memories were not. The emerald eyes and messy dark hair of the young boy painfully reminded the teacher of his anguished past.
While Harry was frying up some bacon, he said, “George, get over here!” Harry turned around and whispered in George’s remaining ear for some time.
Harry looked around the room and smiled. “Well, we’ve only got two singles here. George, if you’re straight… and... Pansy, if you’re straight… Just saying!”
Harry, since the battle and conversation with mother and I, kept always telling me that he had to have a chat with me… Well… on last Sunday night, we went outside. He wanted to have a chat about how females can be. I guess he was trying to talk about the Weaselette? He noticed that something was wrong with me. He wondered what my problem was. We stood out of sight of everyone, and he tried to guess what was bothering me.
“A pillow-biter!?” exclaimed Draco. “It’s none of the savior’s fucking business who I fancy. Yeah, I’m as bent as a nine-quid note. Happy now!?”
“We did,” said Draco. “I should have known that you wouldn’t do that to me. I’m still a little... jumpy… uh… insecure.”
“Yeah, he’s a poof. Always knew it,” grumbles Argus Filch, Hogwarts caretaker. “Never cared for them shifty green eyes. That parselmouth… He ain’t natural.”
I was (am?) so much in the closet. I passed off my obsession with nude male pictures as “curiosity.” Well, it almost killed the cat. The tension just grew and grew. Keeping those emotions hidden made me almost go crazy. I was afraid to display my feelings for fear of being rejected by my family and community.
“We… reconciled… last night,” admitted Harry. “No sex. We’re going to take things slow. I’ve loved him for ages. I’m sure you’ve seen that.”
“I had nothing to lose, didn’t I?” asked Draco. “Luna told me you were lonely the day she was at the Ministry giving her sworn affidavit in my favor. She said you were looking for a
George stood up, stalked over to Draco, grabbed him into an incredibly smothering hug, and said into Draco’s ear, “You loveable bastard. Of course! It’s the most beautiful thing anyone could do.” George kissed Draco on the cheek and stared into his eyes. George then whispered in Draco’s ear, “I know you won’t but if you dare harm Harry… I’ll still like you.” He pulled away from Draco and winked an eye at him.
Draco laughed, “I’ve never… made love… to… anyone. Let’s promise to help each other on our new adventure. Okay?”
“The snake,” said Draco. “Moldy Voldy would rape me with the tail end of his snake. The pain... Merlin! The Death Eaters passed me around like a common trollop. Many were unhygienic. I was forced to suck them off. My bum was used as...
I talked to him later that evening. We had at least a 1 hr. conversation. It seems that he feels the same way I do. ‘Til that point he hadn't talked about it. We both ended up saying that we have thought about each other. Then we agreed that we wanted to try something, so the next day (Tuesday), he came over to my room and… stuff happened. Not everything, just some things. We did some things, and it was nice. Afterwards, I took a solitary walk around the lake and said to myself, “I guess I’m gay (hard word to say).”
Harry thought for a minute before responding, “If you are agreeable, your mere presence is all that I request… request, not require. You are free to leave at any time, though it would be devastating to me. I cannot lie.” Draco looked into Harry’s eyes, confused. “Draco, I cannot and will not force you to do anything you don’t want. You need happiness in your life. If it ends up that I can’t make you happy…” Harry now had tears rolling down his cheeks.
At about nine o’clock, Harry stood up and took Draco’s hand. Harry led him from the dining table through to the sitting room. Harry whispered, “I’m sorry, Draco. Kreacher’s taken your bed. The other bed won’t be here until tomorrow. Are you sleepy?”
“Let’s just say that she was a little shocked,” said Ginny. “I mean, Harry, you aren’t exactly the most…
Draco sighed, trying to release the tension in his body. He continued, “You know Moldy Voldy lived at the Manor for quite some time. There were many Death Eaters around… nearly all the time. The Malfoy name was shamed by my father’s actions… or lack thereof. More on that some other time.
Potter huffed, blowing at the steam rising from his tea. “I’m here to talk to you about what you wrote in the magazine this week.
Potter glared at Draco. Draco could see his jaw twitching, and Potter’s hand looked like it was itching to just grab his wand and throw a hex at Draco. “I love Ginny. I care for her, and I want to spend the rest of my life with her. The sex doesn’t
Potter swallowed heavily, still glancing at his mug. “Does that mean…?” He trailed off, and after a second, met Draco’s eyes. He seemed unsure.
“You’re always more than ready to ruin my life, even when you’re not a part of it anymore. I haven’t seen you in a couple of years. Where the fuck have you been? You look like a mess by the way.” Potter continued, barging into Draco’s house, and pushing past him like the impolite prat he always had been.
Draco swallowed his words and cleared his throat. “You should be with someone who makes your heart pound and
Potter nodded his head, standing up to give Draco his own mug. Draco turned his back to Potter, walking into the kitchen. As he kept their mugs in the sink, his chest rose and fell, rose, and fell. “
“Potter, you have no idea about the kinds of things I want to do to you,” Draco drawled as his face neared Potter’s. Now that Potter was single, Draco could not wait to introduce him to the wonders of sex and how it could be enjoyed. He wanted to show Potter the different flavours of its enjoyment.
” His eyes burned with undecipherable emotions that had Draco swallowing again. He saw Potter’s eyes flitting up from his lips to meet his eyes. Neither of them breathed for a few moments. Then Potter stepped back as he cleared his throat and Draco immediately dropped his hand, stepping back himself.
“I—” Potter blinked and there was a look so intense in his eyes that it made Draco forget how to breathe. He watched Potter’s facial features soften along with the look. “I know, Malfoy, I know. I’ve always known, and I’ve always noticed you. You
It seemed like an important part of their relationship, which Draco agreed it should be, and it mattered to her (which it should) so if the boyfriend wasn’t sexually attracted to her, then the only solution was for them to break up. Another option was that they were not sexually compatible but that did not seem to be the case here, and even if it had been, he would still have suggested a breakup. Draco could think of no way around it. A breakup was inevitable sooner or later for the couple.
“So, what are you here for Potter? Did you just want a cup of tea or was there something else you needed from me?” Draco questioned, trying to feign innocence in the look he gave Potter.
As heat coursed through Draco’s entire body, Potter pulled away breathlessly, his eyes opening just a second after Draco’s own. “That was so much better than I’d imagined,” Potter muttered. “Fucking
magazine. It was a bit harsh, his advice about breaking up with the boyfriend, but it had to be given. If her boyfriend loved her and he wanted to have sex, but he didn’t like having sex with her, then their relationship clearly wasn’t as perfect as the girlfriend was making it out to be. And the girlfriend clearly wanted to have sex with him and was concerned about why it wasn’t doing anything for her boyfriend.
With every sentence he had spoken, Draco had taken a step towards Potter, until Potter had stood up at the last sentence, making Draco realise that they were barely standing a few inches apart. He had subconsciously reached out to touch Potter, right in the middle of his chest as he had said, ‘
“Have you tried spicing up your love life by, say, using sex toys or roleplaying, or anything of the sort? He might be into some weird, kinky sex you might not be aware of. Perhaps he doesn’t want to scare you with his 50-shades-of-grey side (Have you checked if your house has a red room? Or the basement, perhaps? Tell me what you find there). You say that your boyfriend wants to have sex, try to find out what kind of porn he watches to satisfy himself. Find out whose image pops into his head when he masturbates, who he imagines fucking or getting railed by, what sort of features do they have? Are the features similar to yours? Do they look just like you? Is it you he imagines he’s having sex with? If not, then break up with him because that means that it’s not you, GWNGFE, it’s
?” Draco could never have imagined, for the life of him, that it could be Potter. Not War-hero Potter, not body-that’s-just-begging-to-be-fucked Potter, not green-eyes-that-follow-you-everywhere Potter, not the-way-he-licks-his lips-when-he-looks-at-you-is-so-hot Potter. Not this man standing in front of him. He could
“Malfoy.” Draco startled as he faced Potter, who was leaning against the kitchen counter. Draco stood with his hips pressed against the edge of the sink. “I’m sure you must have been wondering who it is that I imagine, in the darkness of the night and when I’m all alone in my flat, if it isn’t Ginny.”
.” Potter hovered close to Draco’s lips, so fucking close that Draco felt their lips brushing tentatively.
Potter shuddered, his eyes sliding lower and lower down Draco’s body until they glanced back into his eyes again. “I wish I could feel that skin beneath my fingers, trace a map on it with my lips. I close my eyes and imagine having that body pinned beneath mine.” Draco’s breath hitched at the look in Potter’s eyes. He was sure his own eyes mirrored that look. “When I come, I call out to a person whose first name starts with the letter D and last name ends with a Y.”
Draco fisted it through his trousers and closed his eyes, his legs twisting around the thin bed sheets. A soft moan fell from his mouth as he thought of green eyes, a smartass mouth, those soft lips, his scar, and that body. But it was the look that he had given Draco, the intensity and the burn of it, and the way that he had uttered the word
He waved his wand over the cauldron, brows furrowed in confusion. “It is a love potion, but not a known one that’s quite odd. I won’t know how this potion works or how to reverse it without knowing what went into it. What did you add into the potion?” he asked. “We followed the directions exactly, we didn’t change a thing.” I looked towards Potter who looked just as confused as I did, then his expression changed. “The ingredients, when you bumped into them, something else must've gone in.”
I instantly begin to sort various ingredients into the order in which they need to be prepared. I send Potter to fetch other things such as a cutting board, knife, and mortar with a pestle to grind. Putting in some of the base ingredients I realized Potters done gathering the supplies, which means it’s now time for me to instruct him. With I sigh I turn to Potter, “Here, grind this moonstone into a fine powder, then take this bicorn horn and carefully dice it, do not cut yourself or we’ll need another horn.” Unfortunately, I had finally broken the silence, for which Potter now decided to speak. “Of course that would be the only way you would ever feel concerned for me.” he chuckled to himself “I wouldn’t call that concern for you, but my grade, I doubt my concern will ever include you.” I turn back to the potion adding the rose thorns. “I doubt your concerns will ever include anyone but yourself.” Potter states while continuing to grind the moonstone. “Well, what I concern myself with is my concern don’t you think?” I made sure for him to understand that my concerns are my business.
I stood out front of his office hoping maybe another teacher would walk by and give me the password or I'd have to wait for Snape to get here after class ends. With a bit of luck I see Dumbledore himself walking down the hall. "What brings you here Mr. Malfoy?" His eyes look at me over his half moon shaped glasses.
Upon entering the classroom everyone was already seated with Snape at the head of the classroom. "Is there a reason for such tardiness?" Snape drawled.
"Sorry Sir someone," my eyes glared toward Potter while emphasizing the word, "spilled their breakfast on the front of my robes, creating the need to change." I held myself slightly higher as I finished. "Very unfortunate, have a seat before you disrupt any more of my class." Snape dismissively waved his hand, signaling the end of the conversation.
This is so unfair, why did it have to be me? “Malfoy, head down to Dumbledore’s office. I will meet you there after class.” I look to my godfather and nod. I pick up my bag from the ground and walk out hesitantly, for some reason wanting Potter to follow. I walk slowly thinking about the situation I’ve gotten myself into. Suddenly I pause in the hall, what’s wrong with me? Since when do I not blame Potter, I mean it was his fault, right? He pushed me into the potion, then tricked me into drinking it, yeah that’s right. I continue through the halls on my way to the griffin statue, realizing Snape didn’t give me the password.
“Somethings wrong.” I said aloud this time. He seemed confused at first but after a glance around the room he understood. “Maybe it just takes a minute to kick in.” he proposed. I looked back at him, but this time my eyes were drawn to his lips. “I can feel the effects, but I'm still too rational. That’s not how it’s supposed to work.” I looked around the room another time and spotted Snape. “Get professor Snape.” He didn’t even bother arguing, he just did as he was told. “What problems did you two cause now?” Snape inquired. “I think somethings wrong with the potion.” I didn’t want to admit it, but I knew I had too.
"Stupid Potter making me late, who does he think he is? What does he think just because he’s the supposed chosen one he thinks he can do whatever he wants? Well, he's wrong and I won't let him! I'll just have to make him pay for thinking he could get out of his mess unscathed after messing with me! I mean come on Pansy, who does he think he is?!" I sharply turn to Pansy awaiting her response as we continue to make our way to potions class, now late after a wardrobe malfunction. Earlier in the great hall, Potter had bumped into me while he still had half a piece of jelly toast in his hand which had gone directly onto the front of my shirt, creating the need to change.
“Enough I said!” We both turn our attention to Snape quietly. “Both of you remain silent, return to your potion without incident, or you’ll both be given detention. Am I understood?” we nodded in response. Snape stood up straighter and left as if gliding across the classroom. I turned to cut the horn properly and added, as it was the last ingredient, all that was left is to stir it twenty-seven times clockwise. I took the spoon and poured it into a vile to which I handed it to Potter to drink. “Oh no way am I drinking that, for all, I know you could have poisoned it.” he shook his head at me repeatedly “Why don’t you just drink it?’ he challenged. “No way am I falling in love with you, even if for an hour.” I was offended that he had even suggested that.
After taking a seat in the back Snape had begun the day's instruction, "For the next potion, partners will be assigned by compatible marks. As such I will be assigning one student with high marks to another with low marks in an attempt to help the hopeless improve, even if by a microscopic margin." His eyes drifted towards Potter lazily. "Now listen for your names, I will not be repeating myself." Snape continues to drawl on stating each pair, "...Parkinson and Zabini ...  Weasley and Granger," I had only picked up on a few familiar names not really listening or taking an interest until I heard my name.
“We will be creating minor love potions which you will be drinking in order to receive marks. If done correctly the potion will wear off by the end of class, however, to ensure none of you end up among the deceased, do not drink without my direct permission. Follow all instructions carefully, even one mistake will warrant a zero for both participants. That being said those unlucky few that brew incorrectly will also have to deal with the displeasing side effects.” Snape’s eyes cast over the classroom ready to reprimand any student not listening to instruction. After a moment of silence realizing Snape is done speaking students begin to move about the classroom pairing up with who they were assigned.
"I'll be fine Pansy, I'm not a child, I don't need your concern!" I snapped. "Be that way if you wish, I'm off to sit with Blaise." spinning on her heel she walks off toward the front where Blaise sat waiting. Potter sat down his things unwillingly as he sat next to me. I keep my eyes on the board as to not acknowledge the boy to my left.
“Both of you, that’s enough!” we both turn to see Snape standing over us. “What seems to be the problem this time?” Snape looked even more unhappy than he normally did. “Potter almost ruined the potion!” I spoke first, beating Potter. “Cause you tried taking the knife from my hand!” he turned to glare at me. “Yes, because you were doing it wrong!” I glared back.
I look over to check his work to see him cutting the bicorn horn incorrectly, “Give me the knife you’re doing it wrong.” I reach to grab the knife but Potter pulls it away. “Give it to me!” I reach again and grab it, but it’s still in his grip. “Let go Malfoy!” we remain tugging on it until Potter shoves me back into the table hitting the shelves and cauldron, causing all the ingredients to rattle in their glass bottles. We both turned to watch, but with luck, nothing seemed to fall into the potion, nor did any of the potion come out of the cauldron. I let out a sigh of relief then whip to Potter, “Look what you almost did, you’re lucky nothing fell in, no thanks to you!” He looked pissed at what I said. “ME! It’s your fault, you're the one who tried to take the knife,-!” I interrupted “Because you were doing it wrong, Potter!”
The room felt colder than normal, but Draco engaged every ounce of self-control to make sure his sudden fear didn’t show. He curved his lips into a smile, though he was sure it must look all wrong.
Potter lifted his eyebrows and shrugged, unable to wipe the hint of a smile from his face. “Just felt like it.”
Draco stood up and came around the other side of the bench, running his hands across Potter’s back and around his waist so he could draw him close. Potter was just a little shorter than him, the perfect height for Draco to lean in and breathe gentle words into his ear, soft words that Draco had never known he had in him.
He wanted to make a quip about how many curses the Ministry inflicted on its Unspeakables for training, if Potter could identify them by feeling, but judging by the look on Potter’s face he didn’t want the answer.
It wasn’t as though he hadn’t seen Potter since school. When Potter had been an Auror, they had run into each other with alarming frequency. If Potter was in a good mood, they’d trade insults; if he was in a bad mood, it would mean a grunt and a rude shove which Draco coolly and maturely ignored, right before hexing him when his back was turned.
Granger’s brows furrowed together, her face transforming from faintly confused to concerned in less than a second. “Then why are you so worried? I didn’t think the two of you were that close. Is there something you’re not telling me?”
Instead, his thoughts kept drifting to Potter, as though following a familiar path to a destination he’d lost. He’d be lying if he said he never thought of Potter, but when he did, he thought of him as he was now: an annoying but distant problem that didn’t have much to do with Draco anymore.
With a shrug, Potter turned back to the glass contraption. “Sure. You’re passed out on the garden path, and I’m only going to remember this as a fever dream. But I’m also messing with you—I’m trying to woo the Veela.”
Suddenly, Draco remembered why he’d come here today. He lifted his head and gazed up at Harry, seeing his own languid affection mirrored in his lover’s face.
Draco turned away. It was no use getting involved in the argument. Smith was clearly sloshed, and the kid hadn’t meant any harm.
They were going to do this. He was really, really going to do this. For a split second, the hilarity of the fact that it was Malfoy comforting
Potter looked at him like his head was spinning. Draco thought about taking pity on him, but pity wasn’t Draco’s style. He slid another piece of parchment across the table.
She stood, brushing off her jeans and taking one last look at the fading lights above them. “I reckon you can get them brighter,” she teased.
For a tiny, excruciating moment, the loneliness inside him opened wide, the ache in his chest so strong he wanted to keel over from the pain of it. It spread through him, and somehow as it did, it eased. It was still there, but open now—seen, heard, acknowledged.
“I know,” Harry said, coming to trail his fingers along the path Draco’s had taken, brushing the front of the pots and watching the leaves stretch in the moonlight.
In answer, Potter gave him a funny look, then stood up and Vanished his coffee set. “Doesn’t matter. Sorry to barge in on you like that, Malfoy. I know what I’ve got to research now.”
“It was better,” Malfoy confessed, drawing Harry out of his thoughts. When Harry simply stared at him, he smiled faintly and conceded: “Different.”
“You’ll be joined by an Unspeakable,” Professor McGonagall continued. “And we’re hoping that between the two of you, some progress will be made by Monday. We’ve arranged for two separate rooms at the top of the tower for you each, but of course come Monday, succeed or fail, you will adjourn to the Ministry for debriefing. Not yet knowing what they do, we can’t have you exposed to the artefacts for too long.”
It had been so long since he’d held anyone. Even before the quarantine, but particularly since. He just wanted… it didn’t mean…
Potter moved closer to him, examining the bead over his shoulder. He brought with him the smell of pine needles and cinnamon.
Potter was already standing, Accioing his coat from the coat room. “Severity one,” he said shortly. “If it’s one of my cases, it’ll be an open security breach with threat to kill.”
Before Potter could say anything more, Draco Disapparated, the room fading out of sight like a ghost.
The first thing Draco noticed, when everything came back into focus, was the sound of carollers coming down the street. He wondered who the fuck would be singing carols in the middle of the night, and then he registered the light coming around the curtains—it was the middle of the day, and they had been stuck inside for hours.
And Potter had somehow used his rambling notes to come up with a solution? How was that possible? Unless he had done what Draco suspected he had. But it was so unlike Potter, so impossible to conceive…
Harry clenched and unclenched his hands nervously, feeling like he was about to take a test he hadn’t studied for and was very much about to fail. He’d never been good at tests.
“Faint orange hue to the catalyst.” Draco pointed at the parcel. “Explosion sounded like it went off in an anechoic chamber. Faint taste of sulphur in the air. It’s a standard curse, Potter. He’ll be all right.”
“Yeah, but you’ve never liked Crookshanks, even before Umbridge,” he said, and like that, some of the tension that’d been present since Ron had shown up was broken.
He turned away from the window as Harry laughed, warmth suffusing his body at the sight of his partner’s happiness.
Malfoy snorted. “I think I enjoyed it at the time. Until I saw the queue of patients on the other floors and put two and two together. Despite what you think of me, I wasn’t a stupid child.”
The broom shot into the air, and at the last second, he pulled his hands away so that Emily could catch it. She giggled, her entire face lighting up with joy.
Malfoy recovered first, but not into his perpetual state of calm. Instead, the same shrewd expression Harry had seen earlier crept across his features. It took gargantuan effort for Harry not to respond to that expression with even more anger, but after a few slow breaths, he fought it down.
“I can come back another time?” he suggested, unable to keep from staring around at the chaos of the room.
He leapt to his feet, steadying himself against the wall, and hunted for a piece of parchment. He had to tell Potter. There was no guarantee that he would approve of Draco’s plan, but since it involved leaping headfirst into danger on the slim chance that it would save them time, Draco had a sneaking suspicion he wouldn’t object too strongly.
Draco took a slow breath and let it out through his nose, strangely relieved and yet filled with a tension he couldn’t place. “Two months isn’t very long.”
“Looks like glitter,” Hermione said, leaning across the table like the others, so that all their heads were huddled together.
“Of course.” Potter scoffed. “We’re both adults, despite what Hermione suggests. Why on earth couldn’t we? It’s not as though we’d be actually dating.”
them—and they’ve made me see the world a little differently. When I saw you before, I was still stuck in survival mode, I think. But that doesn’t allow for compassion.” He took a breath. “I had to learn compassion with... with this man. It feels different now. I’ve spent so long trying to convince them that change is possible that I think I accidentally convinced myself along the way.”
Potter ran a hand through his hair. “The Veela I’ve… annoyed… lives in the hills along the border of this sanctuary,” he said, making Draco’s stomach dip. “I’ve seen it flying after midnight.”
“We couldn’t have picked somewhere better today?” He asked, sliding into the seat besides Draco and wrinkling his nose.
He passed out onto the ground. As his eyes closed, they took with it the glittering vision of an hourglass before him with only three slow grains of sand yet to fall.
“Well,” he said after a moment had passed and Harry had kicked off the door and made his way over to his bed. All the while, Malfoy tracked his progress through the room, swivelling the chair around to follow him. “I imagine it’s pleasurable once you get started.”
“You’re the Curse Breaker,” Potter said slowly, as if he were talking to a young child. “If something happens to you and this gets out of hand, we might not be able to solve it. I’ll do it.”
to see Malfoy, if only so he could have a chance at hexing the git. But he remembered how Malfoy had waited for him when they’d left the Hall, how he’d hovered, almost nervously, while Harry chatted with everyone. He remembered the look on Malfoy’s face when Harry had followed the rest of them into their rooms, and how he’d melted into the darkness before Harry could think of how to phrase the question of whether Malfoy wanted to come in with them, let alone figure out if Harry wanted him to.
“If you don’t get on with it,” Malfoy panted, hips jumping spasmodically against Harry’s fist, “this is going to be over before we really even begin.”
“Where is your wand?” he asked, realising that he had barely seen Harry hold it since he arrived here.
But then a hand caught in his, and instead of pulling away, like Draco instinctively felt he should, he did what he desperately wanted to instead—he followed it.
He hadn’t even touched Malfoy, and Malfoy was already proving to be the best partner Harry had ever had.
The second Harry steps free of the Apparition point, he’s hit by the overwhelming scent of dust and heat. Too busy trying to orient himself, he almost misses the Welcome Witch leaning back against the corrugated iron fence, a ripped flannel shirt knotted around her waist and a tie-dye shirt on top. She holds out a pamphlet to him, chewing loudly on a wad of bubble gum and not bothering to make eye contact with him even when he takes the pamphlet from her hand.
He remembered Potter’s hands on him, the way they came together with an urgency he’d never found in anyone else. He remembered late nights spent together, planning and working on various projects, the way the lamp-light caught Potter’s eyes and made them blaze like fire. He remembered Pansy watching them, expression full of concern about things that Draco had thought she didn’t understand. Really, she had understood far better and far sooner than the rest of them. He remembered her giving them her blessing only hours ago.
Ron’s face crumples in sympathy. “I’m sorry, mate. Can I tell Hermione what’s happened, or do you want to tell her yourself?”
Draco dropped back down and mouthed gently at the tip of Potter’s cock, tracing the head with his tongue and lips, coaxing Potter to thrust upward into his waiting heat. It was intoxicating. He was almost light-headed with disbelief, consumed by the force of his desire and the heady power he felt in bringing pleasure to someone he cared for. If he could, Draco would do this for hours just to see the expression of awe on Potter’s face, just for the sweet reward of his pleas.
It was nonetheless surprising when Potter nodded, and it forced Draco’s thoughts to return, once again, to the baffling mystery that was Unspeakable Potter.
As Harry gets closer to the Queensland coast, his surroundings begin to change. Leafy trees replace the spindly skeletons. Desert becomes forest. During one particularly ambitious leap into the unknown—which nearly results in a Splinching—he lands amidst a tropical rainforest full of singing parrots, strange flightless birds, and the most beautifully deafening weight of silence. He wishes he could stay there longer, but the flightless bird cocks its head at him in a way that makes Harry certain it can see into his soul and is currently calculating the most efficient way to rip out his heart. Just as he Apparates away, he sees it charge for him.
So he doesn’t bother to try, and instead shoves at Draco’s chest until he’s kneeling on the chair and Harry can guide him backwards, still kissing, off the chair and in the open balcony door towards the bed. When he’s there, he trips a little on account of his board shorts still being halfway down his thighs, but he manages to shed the rest of his clothing without disaster and gets started on Draco’s.
Potter slid his hands beneath Draco’s shirt, pulling it free from his trousers before drawing Draco’s tailored jacket slowly back down his arms. Draco heard the sound of fabric being folded and slung over the rail of the balcony, and then Potter’s hands returned to his skin, moving around to his front and undoing his trousers button by button.
“You’re as rich as I am, yet you live like a pauper,” Draco snapped. “Forgive me for questioning your sanity.”
Potter cocked his head, an infuriating smirk appearing on his lips. “If I didn’t know better, Malfoy, I’d say you were scared we were going to lose. What’s it matter? It’s not like it was a bet. If we can’t convince them, we lose nothing. If we can, we get dinner at Bentley’s and the chance to rub it in their faces for months.”
Amidst the screaming of the three witches, each of whom are wearing t-shirts with Harry’s face on them and waving identical copies of a blue-covered book Harry has never seen before in the air, he comes to a realisation. This is never going away. He can run the entire length of the world and they’ll still find him.
Before long, Harry is riding the edge. He threads his fingers through Draco’s hair—soft with product despite how Harry’s hair is still salt-thickened and rough from the sea—and grips just hard enough to hurt. In response, Draco’s speed quickens, bringing with it a warning hint of teeth, and Harry moans.
“You said you kept those sweets here.” Malfoy clears his throat, and Harry feels a lingering stab of desire at how hoarse he sounds. “And I thought you’d be home later. I was going to take a few home with me, but my curiosity got the better of me, I’m afraid.”
In the past, Eleanor had worked with him to process the parts of his past that haunted him, but whenever he’d tried to he’d ended up wound tighter and tighter, unable to feel anything except the urgency to
Draco gripped the wall and shut his eyes. The lace of the curtain fluttered around him, twisting around his fingers as he flexed against the brick, desperate for something to hold onto. He clenched it beneath his fist, turning his face slightly and opening his eyes. The world passed by through the hazy material—dark shadows in the night, twisted trees, and the pale shadow of Potter moving behind him, adjusting his trousers and bringing the hard weight of his cock to line up between Draco’s thighs.
There was a figure in the corner of the room, and Draco realised he had seen it before. They were no longer dreaming—and he hadn’t been dreaming when the cloaked figure first appeared either—but there was definitely a hooded Veela standing in his living room, and Draco selfishly, stubbornly, and stupidly did not want to offer it tea.
“We need to get a message to the Healers,” Draco insisted, looking around for someone he could accost. “He’s probably been overexposed.”
If I didn’t know better, I’d have thought you were drunk when you wrote that. Sadly, I have a little too much familiarity with drunken letter-writing; you didn’t spill your ink nearly enough. I’ll have to assume your words are true.
“It was meant to be a pocket world,” he said, lifting his chin. “I made it look like our, er—” his eyes darted to Morgan, but she just sighed and nodded. “Our grandmother’s,” he finished. “But I guess I shouldn’t have used the fairy boxes. The magic was too strong. It took over.”
He counted the seconds, waiting for Potter to draw away in alarm—for the weight of Draco’s emotions to ruin everything—but it didn’t happen. Instead, Potter groaned and melted into him, his lips parting and his tongue coaxing Draco deeper into the kiss. Draco made an embarrassing sound and then tried to cover it by changing the kiss into something urgent and messy.
,” Potter cut back, voice rising to the familiar pitch Draco recalled from their last years together at school.
“While both certainly sound appetising,” Draco said, leaning in to run his teeth along Harry’s collarbone and pulling off Harry’s shirt while he was at it. “Something about lying back and watching you do all the hard work appeals to me. What do you think?”
“I hardly use my Floo,” Draco said, putting down his quill and Vanishing the specks of ash that fell on the carpet. “Anyone with decorum knows to Apparate to the foyer where the elves can announce them.”
“I mean, I’m not a Veela,” Potter said, studying his very human hands, eyes flicking to Draco’s. “But it looks to me as though the last debt is an offering of mercy.”
He looked back down to see Potter watching him. Potter’s eyes shimmered in the unsteady light of the candles, making him look like he was crying one moment and fiercely bold the next.
It’s nearly dinner time, and Harry knows he should go back to the hotel, but he doesn’t want to. Something unpleasant is stirring in his gut, like his body somehow knows if he goes back bad things will happen. He imagines Draco hexing him, but that doesn’t feel quite right. Punching Harry is out of the question; he’s never seen Draco punch anyone before and there’s no reason why he should start now, even if Harry has been a spectacular twat.
“We need our minds to be wholly on the task,” Potter said before reaching into the front of his shirt.
His first touch was hesitant. They’d talked about penetration before and agreed that giving it a try before the real thing was probably a good idea. Malfoy had admitted to fingering himself before, and they’d agreed he’d be better of the two of them to be on the receiving end this time, if only because he sort of had an idea of what it was meant to feel like.
Potter sat bolt upright. “If it started to leave, it might have left behind a clue as to where it was going.”
“I just assumed you wanted to take things slowly because you were nervous, so when I heard Zabini and Parkinson talking and realised you, er, likely wouldn’t be nervous at all, I didn’t know why you didn’t want me.” The words stuck in his throat, and he realised for the first time just how true they were. He choked a little as he repeated them. “I just thought you didn’t want me.”
The quiet sound of someone clearing their throat made Draco spin around. The shopkeeper was staring at the two of them, eyes wide, and he realised with slowly dawning horror that he knew her.
“Of course they’re taking bribes,” Draco muttered, more to Granger than Potter who seemed to at least understand how the world worked. “Even if you stop one, another will take their place. You can only ever manage that sort of system; you never stop it.”
In fact, he would need to ask Blaise to investigate the lead he had found regarding the O’Reillys and two peacocks discovered roosting in an old barn near Bath. If he was right, it would be the last of it, so he could not afford to miss the chance, but neither could he afford Potter messing it up for him. Potter had always been a nosy child, and since he had grown up to become an Unspeakable one could only assume he had become not only nosier but more entitled about it. Draco would send Blaise a letter now.
Draco wasn’t sure how the rest of the night passed; he was powerless to focus on it. Drinks were set in front of him, laughter surrounded him, conversations ebbed and flowed, but it was as if every second was transient, lacking connection with the seconds before and after. The only constant was Potter, and Draco was drowning in him.
He swallowed and lifted one hand in a placating gesture before turning away. “Have you found any other leads?” he asked the wall. “I don’t fancy guessing the specifics of a prophecy when it could be anything. Unless we have the exact wording, knowing a prophecy exists is next to useless, whether it’s Veela or otherwise.”
Draco drew in a breath, awed not just by the fact that they were about to find out exactly what the curse did, but by the simple beauty of the sight before him.
Except it wasn’t that easy. The gritty cloud of his mind was agitated, restless with unease. Something else was looming.
A deep ache started up in Draco’s chest, filling him with a sadness so deep he didn’t know if it would ever end.
Harry whirled around, heart drumming wildly in his chest, and spotted Malfoy by the door. By the time his heartbeat had returned to normal, whatever traces of awkwardness he’d seen on Malfoy’s face had disappeared, and he cleared his throat again, avoiding Harry’s eyes.
Potter regarded him, green eyes piercing in the low light. He’d watched Draco the entire time he’d walked over, barely moving at all except for his eyes which tracked Draco’s slow progress through the crowd.
Fire absorbed them, surrounding them, and the last of the sand trickled through the hourglass as Harry’s wand welcomed its second core and Draco’s wand finally, after so long alone in misery, welcomed his soulmate home.
Potter’s expression grew still. When he spoke, it came out in a strange voice, too quiet, and all he said was, “It’s time to wake up now, Malfoy.”
All those families. Everything he’d done wrong. How could he ever deserve to let it go? One hundred lives, two hundred—how could his debt ever be repaid?
The sounds of guests laughing and music thudding through walls surrounded Draco until he found it hard to concentrate. The week had passed in a blur full of meetings and overtime to the point that Draco was genuinely glad to have an excuse to let off steam. The uncomfortable exchange with Potter the other day was already out of his mind, and he found himself eager to find him. The last party they’d spent together had been fun; he was looking forward to doing the same again.
“Who am I to make that call?” she answered, gazing at him with an empathy that made him uncomfortable.
Several of the chapters had dog-eared corners—the mark of a desperate man—as he’d returned again and again to the sections detailing the more ferocious Veela traits, analysing himself against the symptom checklist to make sure they hadn’t emerged yet.
to keep coming, because now we’re reaching all these things inside that I never knew needed to be reached, to be held.”
“I must say,” McGonagall said, looking around at them all with a faint smile. “My first instinct is to address you all as students, but while you are indeed apprentices in your many fields, it is more than clear that I can no longer call you that. Hogwarts is proud to welcome you home, and I wish you luck in your endeavours over the summer. Those of you seeking unicorn hair in the forest, please be advised the herd has moved to the western fields, while the thestrals have migrated behind the lake. Professor Hagrid will provide you with an overview tomorrow.” Her smile suddenly turned wry. “Those of you who have sought special permission to study explosive spells under the tutelage of the esteemed Professor Staltwort,” Seamus and Ron grinned. “Do take note that any permanent damage to Hogwarts grounds will result in an enquiry from the Ministry. Now, to bed.” She clapped her hands, and the lamps lowered, their flames flickering gently in their sconces.
Harry kept waiting for Malfoy to say something, but he should have known better. He knew just how stubborn the man could be, and, true to form, Malfoy remained silent as they headed off in search of the path of the unicorn herd.
He turned away and they went through the rest of the questions quickly, finding—somewhat alarmingly—that they had guessed every one correctly. The parchment wiped itself clean just as they were about to stand up and hand it in—well before the other groups had finished—and several new questions appeared.
Draco groaned, pushing himself up from the floor and stretching out his stiff limbs. He felt Potter stirring behind him, and he had the strangest sensation of lost time, like there was a memory lingering just out of reach. But even though he knew he had been working inside the curse for nearly two hours, the last thing he could remember was the taste of that vile potion.
He turned and met Potter’s gaze. “Even if we do ignite rumors that we’re fucking—” Potter’s eyes darkened, “—that’s not what will win us the bet. Hate sex is hardly a mature relationship, and Pansy would never pay out on that.”
The last thing Draco saw before he disappeared back to the comfort of his own flat was Potter’s thoughtful expression. He rather thought it mirrored his own.
Well, if he wasn’t going to bother to look closely, Draco wasn’t going to help him. He swallowed down the bitter rage rising inside him and turned away.
“Quite.” Draco shifted in his seat, trying to regain the upper hand and finding it impossible. Potter was an Unspeakable; he probably knew more than Draco did. “A person may be forgiven for thinking that this blood conduit is functionally the same as a magical creature, like a Veela or a house-elf, but it is not. Blood as a conduit still limits the magic to the blood, requiring focus to appropriately wield the channel of power. A creature
Potter frowned at the parchment, eyes scanning the lines quickly. He read it through, then went back to the top and read it again.
“I don’t want to argue with you about this,” he said gently. “I want to help you. You’re not a basket case; you have trauma. I do too, and I’ve dealt with it only marginally better than you have, but fortunately I don’t get faced with mine every single day at work. Please,
“I carried your wand, Malfoy,” Potter muttered, expression fierce. “I know how it felt. A Unicorn hair core? In a wand that had been used for the Dark Arts for more than a year? That wand should never have worked, not just for me, but for
“Congratulations,” Draco said, bending forward to hug her. “I can only imagine how much work that took to arrange.”
No, he wasn’t crying over unrequited love. If he was certain of anything, he was certain of that. He was crying because… because something was wrong with Potter, and Draco knew—he just somehow
Wordlessly they fell into step beside each other, joining the rest of the people who were going for walks or runs around the lake. The little ducklings waddled along the path in front of them, and the two of them slowed down until their pace was more of an amble, allowing the ducks to race around their feet. Even in the chill of autumn, the sun was warm against their necks. It made Draco realise that he couldn’t recall a time from their recent relationship when he could actually remember the world around them. He’d been so utterly absorbed in the slow, downward pull of it all that he’d let himself get lost along the way.
“I want to.” The words came out several notes lower than his normal speaking voice, a thick rasp to his tone that would have embarrassed him if he wasn’t so fucking turned on.
Harry snorted, and the fog in his mind finally lifted. The world had colour again, and it took him several attempts before he could speak. “Yeah, all right. Trust
For a moment, Potter didn’t respond. His eyes were strangely glassy and distant. Draco’s heart leapt into his mouth and he was a hair’s breadth from reaching across the table to shake Potter when he suddenly blinked back into focus.
Malfoy reached out to him, and Harry flinched in surprise and a little alarm, but Malfoy only rested a hand on Harry’s knee and pushed down with gentle pressure. Harry realised that his knee had been jiggling. With great effort, he forced himself to stop; the world lurched unpleasantly.
that will be invaluable in experimental magic.” He bared his teeth; no one in their right mind could call it a smile. “After all. It’s what I do.”
He suddenly remembered what it was like this time last year, wrapping presents alone, drunk, and wishing stupidly that Harry was there with him. He pulled back and stood up, ignoring Harry’s protest and spinning him around so that his hands were braced on the dining table.
It made him laugh, and then his imagination had Potter turn to him, eyes dark and heated just like the memory of that one night when he had seen behind the walls to the broken man beneath, when he had seen what it might be like to know him in a different way. Before he knew it, his cock was hard and his thoughts were running wild with images of Potter bent over the couch, shirt unbuttoned and half caught up in Draco’s grip as he thrust inside him, slow and hard.
Draco’s legs jiggled with nerves, and his grip on the park bench was getting tighter and tighter with each passing minute. Potter was late. His mind began to whir with old insecurities, old fears, but he was stronger now, better equipped to handle them. Not that he had ever been weak—that was one of the first things Eleanor had made him understand. He hoped Potter understood it about himself too.
It wasn’t because he had feelings for Potter—those felt separate from this whole thing. If he could somehow take away everything else about the situation, he rather thought that his feelings might be relatively easy to deal with. He and Potter got along quite well now; there was every chance that Potter would agree to a date. And if he didn’t, well, Draco wouldn’t be the first person to deal with a broken heart.
“You never were the brightest quill in the box,” Draco agrees, but there’s a smirk on his face that reveals he’s only joking.
Draco grimaced. “Surely, I would have left a note then too. Why would I just leave it for us to guess?”
“Defeating Lord Voldemort was never going to be enough.” The words dragged out of him. They were thoughts he’d long mulled over, but never closely examined since, in many ways, they cut too close to home. “To affect real change, you need to dismantle the systems that allowed him to gain power.”
“Get over it, Malfoy,” Potter laughed, true relief infesting his voice, and then in a gesture Draco had no way of predicting, he picked Draco up and spun him around in a delighted circle.
She nodded, blue eyes conflicted. He hadn’t told her exactly what had happened, but he could tell she understood.
“Do you want my mouth on your cock?” Draco asked with a sly smile, pumping his hand slowly up and down Potter’s length. “Or on your arse?”
Granger jabbed him hard in the ribs with her elbow. “Ron, stop it. Draco’s serious. What are you apologising for? I’m positive it isn’t necessary.”
Did you try the eclairs? I distinctly remember the first time I ate one. It was rich and slightly melted, and the tabby cat was stretched out beside me in a sunbeam so warm and cozy I felt like that moment must be what Heaven felt like. An eternity filled with morning sunshine, cats, and eclairs.
“Still,” Potter said. His voice was surprisingly firm, the unexpected authority in it sending shivers down Draco’s spine. “I’d be more comfortable if you had some kind of additional security in place.”
Draco said something in response, but it was muffled. Harry pushed at him until he sat up and glared, speaking audibly this time.
His breathing had picked up and as Harry watched, he started going a patchy sort of red all down his neck and chest.
“You don’t mind that I just called you Draco, do you?” he asked quietly. It was meant to be just between them, but he was very aware of Ron and Hermione a metre away, who were probably able to hear everything they said.
It was utterly convincing, since it was the truth. Even Pansy looked momentarily taken aback before she shot Draco one last suspicious look. He had a sinking feeling that final look was for a different reason entirely.
“Yes,” Draco snapped. “I lived it, every single second of it, and this is the worst fucking hangover of my life. If the curse is done, I want you to leave so I can get over this in peace.” His voice choked on the final words, and he fell silent.
He gave Potter a secret smile, making sure that Hannah saw. Potter’s cheeks flushed in a way that made Draco’s chest tighten, but he had no time to examine it further.
After that, Harry pretended not to watch him at all. He was just about to suggest it was time they all go to sleep, when Seamus suddenly shushed everyone.
It was one of the reasons that Potter’s promotion had bothered him so much; why hadn’t he seen it coming? He’d put Potter’s increasing surliness since Hogwarts down to the general brutish demeanour that seemed to go with his job description, but now that Potter had demonstrated such unprecedented depth of intelligence and skill, Draco was at a loss. It was clear now that he wasn’t like the other Ministry-approved thugs—boorish and mean simply because their entire life’s purpose centred on running around outside and chasing down the latest target. So, why then was he so much less cocky than the Potter he remembered at Hogwarts? And how had Draco underestimated him so poorly?
Wrapping Christmas presents was always a sober affair for Draco. He tried to mask it by inviting Pansy into the whole saga, drowning them out in the most hideous wrapping paper he could find, and consuming goblet after goblet of mulled wine. This year, however, Pansy was unavailable, and there was nothing to distract him from the painful reminder that each carefully selected gift was a farce.
“Absolutely awful,” Harry agreed happily as they calmed down, wiping a rogue tear that’d escaped off his cheek with the heel of his hand.
“Well, Potter, it would appear our charming acquaintances have such a low opinion of our intelligence that they think we would attempt such a gauche act.” He turned to Potter and had to fight back a laugh at the narrowed eyes that met him.
By the time he had arrived home and set up the protective spells in the workroom, Potter’s owl had returned with a curt acquiescence to the time. Draco could practically smell his sleep breath through the parchment, and part of him wished he had sent it in the middle of the night after all, since his courtesy had been so rudely received.
Draco had thought Potter’s infuriating mood swings were something that only happened around him, like Potter was so conflicted by the need to be civil to Draco whilst simultaneously wanting to slam his face into a brick wall that it kept leaking out in fits of petulance. Now, he wasn’t so sure.
“Have you ever seen anything like this before?” Potter asked, before casting a couple of protection charms over the bead and slipping it carefully into his shirt pocket.
This time Harry didn’t bother to hold back his groan. He set his glass down on a coaster—roughly hewn wood carved by a Muggle woman in Surrey—slid his hands into his jeans, palmed his hard cock, and began to stroke.
Draco’s eyes land on Harry and grow wide with desperate relief. “Potter!” he yells and scrambles forward to grab Harry by the collar of his shirt. “Save me!” he hisses.
Draco’s chest filled with warmth that had nothing to do with the crackling fire in front of them. The thought that Potter enjoyed his company enough to waste hours of time together made his inner eleven-year-old dance with glee.
As much as it hurt, he realised how much of a mask he had been wearing with his friends. It was only on those nights with Potter—ironically, when they had been planning complex deception—that he had been able to stop
Blaise had disappeared to get clothing early on, returning with steaming coffees and bars of chocolate for them all. Draco’s tasted like ash but he knew it would help, and Blaise had gone to the effort of it, so he ate it all. Every bite caught in his throat, the rich scent of sugar drowned by the bile he kept wanting to spit out. The coffee was better—at least it was warm.
Pansy’s fashion lines were renowned, not just on the catwalk but as pieces of art displayed across the world. She had investors lining up every other week for a piece of her pie, and Draco couldn’t be prouder of her.
.” He paused. “Although, it does have a faintly messiah-istic feel to it that we could exploit.” He cut that thought off before it could begin and handed Pansy her glass. “Listen, Pans. I’m on their case now. I can’t afford to cause scandal.”
Weasley floated the tray of drinks onto the table and slid in next to Pansy with a grin. “It’s nice to be in a magical pub for once.”
He turned away, but before he made it two steps, he heard a quiet voice from behind him say, “Yes, I forgot something.”
Draco turned back to his notes. He didn’t have the package in the room with them, of course. It was out the back in his work room under a number of security spells. At this point, he hadn’t even opened it; he was too caught up on the bizarre results of his diagnostics.
All his notes, every sick, desperate thought and memory of when Voldemort had been living with him. He’d written it down—anything to keep sane, to have some form of company—and then the Ministry had seized it all during his trial. They’d taken everything from him, every record of every dark act he and others had done.
When he answered the door the next morning, Draco made sure he had showered, groomed, and drunk a triple strength hangover potion. Even still, it felt as though Potter was eyeing him suspiciously.
“The man’s a moron.” Draco was surprised at the venom in his own voice. “Did you tell him you’d addressed all his issues?”
“I do,” Harry agrees, smiling against Draco’s mouth. “And if you play your cards right, I promise I won’t tell everyone you drank beer from a shoe.”
Harry pulled back with a grin, pleased that he had managed to push Malfoy so far with so little. It felt good to know that he was responsible for making Malfoy look like this, sound like this. It was empowering.
Neither he nor Potter were responsible for those words, and Draco’s blood chilled as the voice—sounding like infinite skies and the howl of wind around mountains—washed over him.
Unless you were a stubborn old man who refused to make amends for his choices, and instead chose to allow Fate to destroy you on the altar of your own pride.
Everyone else had gone back to the dorms, but Potter was still in the showers, water sluicing over his shoulders and tracing a delicious line down the centre of his thighs. Draco stared at him, part of his brain wondering why the hell Potter was using the Slytherin change rooms, and part of him not caring in the slightest.
“I would have stopped reading, Malfoy, honestly, except it was your journal that gave me the answers I needed. I couldn’t ignore it.”
Potter led him from stall to stall down the market strip, and together they composed a basket of fruit and flowers so large that by the end they needed magic to hold it up. Laughing, they’d cast a Lightening Charm and attached it to a bewildered owl, sending it to Blaise’s house.
Neither of them could look at each other, staring down at their mugs as the water slowly cooled enough to drink.
I went there every day this week, but I couldn’t recapture that moment. The sun was warm, but I couldn’t feel it on my skin, and when I tried to pat the kitten, it hissed at me. I don’t blame it; my hands were very cold.
“Why don’t you take care of it?” Draco asked, as if he were proposing something as simple as removing a jacket. He took another sip of his whiskey and swiped an errant drop off his lip with his thumb.
Once or twice, Malfoy’s breath hitched. Each time, he stopped to make sure he wasn’t in pain. Every time, Malfoy glared at him and told him to keep going until, finally, the noises went back to being recognisably ones of pleasure.
Malfoy’s grip tightened, breath hitching, and Harry realised that he was probably squeezing him a bit too hard. But when he loosened his grip, Malfoy stepped in closer, and the arm that was around his waist came of its own accord to Malfoy’s neck, fingers sliding through his hair as Harry moved in closer still.
to be better than that,” he said imperiously, motioning for Harry to scoot further up the bed so he’d have room to get on.
The same terror that had filled him that night returned, wiping away all the years between that boy and the man he had become. He found himself searching for an exit, a way to get out of this horrible mess that he knew deep down was partially his fault, just like he knew he would never escape the guilt of it, no matter how many times he tried to make amends.
It was no good letting him wear it everywhere; Draco just kept wanting to bend him over and fuck him in it.
“Morgan.” She smiled and waved goodbye, leaving him alone while she purchased her supplies and joined Granger out the front.
Harry looked up, face bright with hope, but then he froze as his eyes landed on something behind Draco’s head. “Nearly.”
Massaging his temple, he tried to think once more of the box and the carefully wrapped gifts inside. He felt a surge of curiosity, but even as the box morphed into the cursed package, his curiosity remained warm and safe.
A few words of the argument drifted over, but it was incomprehensible—something about the child getting in the way of Smith’s drunken attempt to cast an Accio. After a moment, Draco realised the child was a Squib. He probably hadn’t recognised the magic then and had somehow interrupted.
He saw Potter and Morgan and George and Kalen stumbling and grabbing a hold of the walls and each other to steady themselves, and he suddenly felt the weight of the space between them—all the things he couldn’t brush aside.
The door opened wider, revealing a ramshackle kitchen and dining room with dishes floating everywhere.
It floated up from his hand and hung, poised, in the centre of the room. Then, it gave a little shudder and descended into the furthest corner, to the one gear that hadn’t lit up in their diagnostic paths: the tiny gear that moved steadily around on its own. Draco leaned over and squinted into the glass; he could just make out a tiny name.
Malfoy’s voice is softer now, gentle with tones of affection that Harry has never heard from him before. He closes his eyes and feels every fibre in him reaching for the sound, propelling him forward to the owner of the voice.
,” Draco argued indignantly. “It also said you hurt me, if you recall, when anyone with a functioning memory knows—” He broke off, thinking of pinboards and red string and Potter’s photo having yet to trace to anything Draco could name. Draco swallowed. “What is this then?”
“Sure,” Malfoy drawled, plucking the piece of parchment with their instructions out of the air as it floated toward them. “Did you know this is going to take all morning? What rubbish. I spent six years of school with you—I don’t need to know your favourite bloody colour just so we can go hunting for unicorn hair together.”
After a few seconds of frozen horror, Draco turned and punched the wall. It crunched satisfyingly beneath his knuckles, leaving a small indent of his strength behind. The skin was instantly grazed and bleeding, and Draco stared at it numbly, unable to reconcile the sensations flooding him because he couldn’t remember anything that had just happened, at least, not before he’d apparently ruined everything.
He remembers the way Draco had thrown Harry behind him, protecting him from the witches’ advances. Draco followed him here all the way from England just to look out for him. What had he said when Harry questioned him? He’d been worried Harry was running away.
Draco turned his attention to the peafowl, finding Potter’s face suddenly difficult to look at. “Igrelda’s getting a mean look in her eye,” he said idly.
. Was Potter acknowledging that there was something between the two of them? Or did he have some kind of warped sense of work-place bonding?
They stared at one another for several moments, guilt written all across Kalen’s face. Before they could speak, a whirring sound filled the room. Draco looked over at Potter, and saw him staring at his pocket in alarm. Draco realised what was happening a second before a brilliant white light filled the room and everything disappeared.
“I’ll tell us not to do anything,” he said. “I think— I don’t know— I think I can dismantle its defences at least. Then maybe we can see what the hell is going on that’s making it think it’s currently exploding.”
“Yes,” Granger confessed, looking guilty. “We cornered him and tried to get him to talk about it. I tried to get him to see a Mind Healer. Merlin, I don’t know how many times I tried to get him to go.”
Then, Draco shifted ever so slightly, hitched his hips up so they were partially suspended off the bed, and he started moving more energetically. The new angle had him brushing past Harry’s prostate, and he found himself moaning and squirming, trying to get more of it.
“How thoughtful of them,” Malfoy said, looking like he very much wanted to set the parchment on fire. “Alright then, let’s hurry up. There aren’t many.”
It was like nothing Harry had ever seen. Familiar, but different. He lowered his head and placed a kiss on Draco’s inner thigh, listened to the answering gasp of breath. He did it again, and again, for the simple pleasure of hearing Draco sigh, for the slight smile on his lips, for the hand that reached down to thread fingers through Harry’s hair, stroking him like a promise.
“It is,” Harry agreed, taking the hint and allowing them both to sink back into the tentative camaraderie they had been building.
Harry studied him for a moment, but no more descriptions were forthcoming. It seemed that Malfoy was content to leave it at that—moment over, time to move on. Harry wasn’t sure how he felt about that. If he was going to do this thing with Malfoy of all people, he didn’t want to rely on the two of them just guessing that they were doing everything right. Malfoy had already admitted that part of the enjoyment came from knowing that the other person was having a good time as well. Harry had spent too much of his life dealing with half-truths and deceptive smiles; he didn’t want to go ahead if there was any chance they weren’t being open.
“Nothing,” he chuckled. “Absolutely nothing. Only how similar we really are when it comes down to it. You want to be prepared. Like
It wasn’t that the smell was bad; he was disgusted that it smelled so nice. He wanted to lean into Potter and just breathe in the scent of his collar.
He runs his tongue along them, and Harry realises that they are just as shiny with saliva as they are with Harry’s come, and the thought nearly sends him over again. He slides his hand to the back of Malfoy’s neck, relishing the way the skin is slightly damp with sweat, and grips him, not hard enough to hurt but firm enough to hold him steady. He’s not sure what Malfoy sees in his eyes when he turns back, but something there makes his breath hitch, and then he is coming, thrusting into his own hand and crying out.
“Pardon?” Draco tried to look indignant and failed, mostly on account of the fact that Potter was staring at him like he was a particularly decadent appetizer.
Potter, no matter what she says, I have not been staring at you for six years with poorly disguised bloody pining.”
Draco’s heart stuttered in his chest. Maybe there was another path. Maybe what they were building had been real after all and they could turn it into something solid, something with the power to rescue Potter without destroying Draco in the process.
Potter glared at him, and Draco forced himself to remain quiet lest he ruin this momentous occasion.
Draco palmed him loosely, moaning into Potter’s mouth as the slick slide of Potter’s cock met his skin.
He realised his error, of course, the moment he finished and noticed that he hadn’t allowed himself time to bring clothing with him into the bathroom. Maintaining a dignified tilt of his chin, he wrapped a towel around his waist and opened the door. Through a cloud of dissipating steam, he saw Potter turn to him reflexively before freezing. If he had been holding something, Draco was quite certain he would have dropped it.
“I’m only telling you what I see. I might be wrong, I might be right. I’m only telling you because I wouldn’t be any kind of friend if I didn’t.”
How the hell had Malfoy found out? Surely somebody must have told him. It wasn’t like he had gone and talked to Rita Skeeter about it. He didn’t think any of his friends would have told Malfoy anything, even something as insignificant as his preferred Quidditch team. In fact, most people probably didn’t talk to Malfoy about him at all.
“Lily had friends that were not very nice to her friend Severus. She often rebuked them for their taunting and jeering of her weird friend, but his love went unrequited. Eventually, they grew up at this special magical school and Lily fell in love with one of Severus’s sworn enemies, messy-haired James. Severus hated James and was jealous of his affectations towards Lily.
Rita Skeeter (Diagon Alley, London). One Harry Potter was seen sneaking out of a mysterious man’s room next to his at the Leaky Cauldron. At two in the morning, Potter left the room and ran back to his own. We can only guess what the two poofs were up to. Apparently, our Savior likes to take it from strangers at the Leaky. All we’ve been able to determine is that the person in the other room is in fact a man. He came to the Leaky earlier in the day wearing a thick black hooded cloak. The name in the register was the name of a deceased Death Eater. We will not rest until we find the truth!
“Would you like some mental health help?” asked Harry. “I won’t force you, but I’ll me more than willing to pay. Your mental health and our relationship are worth more than all the gold in Gringotts.”
“Tonight,” said Harry, smiling. “Although, I always think of you as Draco in my dreams. It makes you look more… approachable.” He paused. “Draco, I’m lonely. I’m depressed. I need someone in my life to help with my… issues. You need to know that. I also have fierce nightmares.”
“Anyway, I gave myself up in the forest to save the Wizarding world. I let him cast the killing curse at me with no resistance on my part. It killed the part of him inside of me. It attached itself to me because his soul was fragile from having created so many horcruxes. Well, he destroyed his own horcrux, me, in the forest. We think he imparted some of his magical abilities on me. The parseltongue skill obviously came from him. After the second killing curse... wordless, wandless magic.”
“Much of the pottery of the period portrays this act of intercrural sex with the elder male standing facing the teen. He would then thrust his penis between the younger man’s thighs. It was the beautiful act of intimacy. I modified it because your prick juts out straight and might make it difficult from the front. Did you like it?”
Harry sat up and woke Draco from his slumber. Both men dressed and went into the kitchen for a nice meal. Kreacher outdid himself. Draco and Harry were quite surprised. That morning, Harry and Draco first shopped for their preferred brands of personal care products. Draco stocked up on various hair products. He had never seen the likes of a supermarket such as Tesco or Sainsbury’s. He reveled at seeing so many products all in one store. Draco waited outside the store while Harry popped back home to give Kreacher the Tesco bags to put their purchases away.
so many times. Ron, I’m sorry that I constantly made fun of you and your family. I apologize to both of you, sincerely. We can’t forget the past, but I can only ask that you might learn to accept me as I am today. I know it’s hard to believe, but…”
“Harry, Hermione, and I are giving them the second-best scoop of the century in an article entitled,
Last year, I think I knew, internally, that I was gay, without using the word. I comprehended the subject of poofiness and knew that it applied to me but was still unable to proclaim it.
“Well, he wears his emotions on his sleeves, but I’ve learned some things lately that he has told no one else,” said Draco. “Right Harry?”
“That sounds like our... their... main staircase. There was a closet in the space under the first six stairs. It was two and a half feet wide, at most. That was my bedroom until I came to Hogwarts.”
“It locates the source,” he explained, as he set the dial down in the centre of the balcony. “There’s no point searching for the source of a curse until you know what the curse is, because it has nothing to track, right? But if this isn’t a curse, and it isn’t operating on its own volition…”
“Huh? Oh, nah,” Harry quickly grabbed a serving of pie so he could avoid looking at her. “I was paying too much attention to take notes.”
Potter wouldn’t look at him. He stared mutely ahead, eyes blazing. “Why are you even here, Malfoy? We’re not
He heard the sound of clothing rustling and something heavy hitting the floor, and just for a moment he froze as the mental image of Potter undressing and lying back on the ground, legs spread, hit him out of absolutely fucking nowhere. A terrified whimper escaped the back of his throat, and he whirled around in horror.
The bedroom was tiny. It made sense, Harry supposed. There hadn’t been time to focus on luxuries—only the essential. Decision after decision, each made with no time, no precedent. But then, it had been that way during the battle too…
“I don’t understand how they’re getting through the wards,” he said finally, turning his piercing stare onto Draco.
Harry smiled, and continued in a gentle, soothing tone, “In that case, you won’t mind turning out the light.”
“Start stretching,” he was ordered, and obediently, Harry did, pressing against the walls that squeezed in on him tightly.
“So we need to keep this natural,” Draco reiterated, thankful that his rapidly beating heart was somehow remaining inaudible. “Believable. We need to convince the world that we somehow fit together so perfectly, so inexplicably, that they can’t believe they never saw it before.”
Or, perhaps being surrounded by laughter and love was turning him into a sentimental twat, and as soon as they parted ways he would fall back into his blissful life of bachelorhood.
He and Potter didn’t have a hope in hell of pulling off this spell. It was needling and temperamental. It required constant attention from the anchor to ensure it didn’t take hold of the curse breaker’s own magic and rip him—quite literally—limb from limb. More than that, it demanded absolute synergy between the anchor and the curse breaker. If there was any moment of dissention between the two of them, it would take a hold of the opportunity to swallow both of them into the Ether, and all would be lost.
When he’d agreed to sign up for the summer program, he’d been secretly overjoyed at the chance to come back to Hogwarts for three months. It wasn’t that he didn’t enjoy studying in the pre-specialist program at the Ministry, but even after three years away, he couldn’t pass up the chance to come home. Besides, Hermione had told him there would be a range of past students studying a number of different things for the program, along with students from Durmstrang and Beauxbatons. It had sounded fun—a light-hearted escape from his newly adult world.
Draco’s tone wasn’t scathing, like it would have been years ago with that sort of remark. Instead, it was a simple question. Harry felt himself warming all over again to the idea of getting to know this new Draco—the one he was behind the barbs.
His eyes slid lower down, pausing at Draco’s hips, and his breath hitched. Draco began to panic; could he see the bulge? Was it obvious? Draco gave him another shove, but it was like trying to move a mountain.
He was hesitant to ask. If anything was going to make Potter revert into a swirl of horrible emotions, it was the reminder of everything he had wanted to achieve.
Draco muttered a cleaning charm, taking a moment to enjoy the soft scent of mint that suddenly surrounded them, mixing with the heady aroma of Potter’s sweat-slicked skin and their combined arousal. Then he lowered his mouth and traced a long line along Potter’s crease with his tongue.
“Both. I liked what we did the other night, and wouldn’t be averse to doing that again and maybe even going further, but I want to be prepared before we go all the way.”
That was… Honestly, I don’t know where to begin. If you were trying to convince me to open up to you again by opening up to me first, then, it was… well, truthfully, it was pathetic. I’m not here to tell you how to live your life, but if you want to be vulnerable with someone, Potter, you have to actually be vulnerable.  I don’t know who you’ve told that story to, but I can practically hear how many times you’ve said those words. They don’t mean anything to you, and neither does the act of sharing them with me.
Blaise frowned. “Your feelings are always important,” he said softly. “And you understand that this is going to take a toll on you, right?”
The Great Hall came to a grudging silence, full of quiet murmurings and laughter as everyone waited to be allowed to leave.
A strange shudder raced through him as he said those words, and he wondered what moment the curse had witnessed to deem them soulmates. Had it been when Potter stole his wand, leaving him defenceless at the mercy of the greatest Dark Wizard alive? Or had it been when Draco’s family had carved hateful words into the skin of the people Potter loved most? Which one, which one… So many choices.
A peacock appeared on the path behind Blaise, and Draco distantly noticed the distinct red feather above her eye—Igrelda. But he couldn’t place any of that into context, because his mind was whirring. If he hadn’t cursed Potter for trespassing, when had he cursed him?
Potter stared at him before exhaling in a long breath. “The Horcrux was still inside me,” he said, and Draco felt like he’d just been punched in the stomach.
Draco had tried to change. And along with that attempt had come the realisation that, while his false approval and simpering smiles might make the people around him comfortable, concealing an entire part of himself just made him fucking miserable. If Potter had even the slightest capacity to look beyond his own nose, he would have realised that Draco
Then, slowly, never taking his eyes from Harry’s, Malfoy lowers his mouth and slides his lips, centimetre by glorious centimetre, back down Harry’s cock.
He remembered those times huddled on his living room floor, crying because he had never felt emptier or more alone.
“Peacock feathers?” he queried, stomping around the kitchen island and towards the increasingly wrong-footed-looking man in his living room. “That’s what you’re after? Or are you requesting that I climb a tree for you and obtain a nice array of raven plumes to match that stupid hair?” Something occurred to him in the middle of his rant. “Are you honestly telling me you’ve been here for thirty minutes because you couldn’t get my front gate to open? You are a
“Hmm, we’ll see,” Malfoy said simply. He was heavy-lidded and was cupping one of his cheeks in his hands.
The lube was incredibly messy as he smeared it around Malfoy’s entrance. He avoided touching the furl at first, drawing rings around it to try to accustom both Malfoy and himself to the feeling of it.
But why would it put Potter in danger for it? Draco searched for another answer, but could find no obvious link and eventually Vanished the board before Potter could walk in and question him.
Draco blinked but said nothing. They’d been friends for years now—why would Potter question whether he was welcome in Draco’s house? Although, come to think of it, this was the first time Draco could recall him visiting on his own.
As if to punctuate the point, a particularly loud expletive was shouted, followed by a long, drawn out moan. Harry warmed to his point at that, convincing himself even as he was maybe, possibly, hopefully convincing Malfoy.
Draco gaped at him. After a long moment of silence, he said, “I give you permission to read my journal, Potter.”
Draco smirked. “Doesn’t feel right. So, you said he’s better than he was, but I just wondered whether you were
“You’re using me to avoid your emotions,” Draco protested quietly. “I rather think we should talk about it.”
It was crazy how turned on Harry was. He’d never had this with a partner before. Whenever he fucked someone, it had always been a confusing mess of guessing—what do you want? Is that good? Are you being honest or are you just trying to impress me because I kind of saved the world that one time?
He found himself ruminating on what Potter had said earlier today, what he’d been afraid of. Perhaps Potter’s ‘ordinary life’ lacked this level of friendship as well. Maybe this was his awkward way of saying that he enjoyed Draco’s company and wanted to have more of it.
He was furious. Rage coursed through his veins, and suddenly the strange intensity in Potter’s eyes was like a mirror, even if Draco still didn’t know the source of Potter’s anger.
It was a good brew, based on petals from the Dendrobium chrysotoxum—the Gold orchid, said to bring youthful qualities through its elixir. Potter didn’t deserve it.
Harry blinked in surprise. “Right. Well, I put chocolate eclairs, since your mum sends you those all the time. Was I right?”
Then he leaned forward on the table and propped his chin on his hand. Draco suddenly felt like he was staring down a predator.
“In fairness to Pansy,” Potter murmured to him, a slight smile on his face as he ducked his head closer to Draco’s for him to hear. “Ron accidentally set his glass on fire, then he accidentally set Hermione’s glass on fire, and then Hermione threatened to dump him if he didn’t get her a new drink. So, technically, it was true.”
Then Zabini had dragged Ron out onto the dance floor and tried to intimidate him by grinding against his crotch, only to find that, out of the four of them, Ron did the best slut drop. The sound of Zabini’s surprised laughter rang clear across the noise of the club, breaking down the last of the walls that had tentatively been held between them all. Parkinson slung her arm around Hermione’s shoulder and led her out to dance, while Bulstrode winked at Neville and waited for him to follow.
Harry swallowed, took a deep breath. “Oh, I don’t know,” he said airily, struggling to sound normal and not like he was in the middle of an orgasm. “All right, I suppose.”
When you told me you were leaving for France—getting up and going, just like that—it was the first time I had ever imagined such a thing. Just leaving. For a split second, I think I saw the cage door open up.
He pushed Draco’s shirt back from his shoulders and rose up to bite down gently on his neck. Draco shook his head and pushed Harry back, fighting for control of his breath.
Part of him hoped it wasn’t a sign that his body was getting confused from all this contact with Potter. They were spending so much time together, pretending to fall in love, and it wasn’t as though Draco needed much prompting to find the man fit. He’d already acknowledged his reservations about this whole thing—acknowledged and dismissed them. He didn’t need his body betraying him after all the work he’d put in to move forward in the best way possible.
Potter laughed, sounding slightly unhinged. “Yeah, okay, and once I confess, the final stage will activate and you’ll fucking kill me. Call me crazy, but I don’t see much incentive.”
Hermione looked like she was bursting to ask a million questions, but for once, she seemed to contain herself.
Draco nodded slowly. “Just making sure you were still keen. It’s been weeks; you might have become bored.” He grinned, trying to take the edge off his words, making sure he didn’t reveal just how much it meant to him that he maintain this closeness to Potter right now.
Irritation spiked, and Draco straightened up with a jolt. “And killing a Dark Lord doesn’t mean you get to play judge, jury, and executioner.” No, apparently that was Draco’s job, which only pissed him off more. “Who are you to question what Fate deems adequate?”
Draco smiled weakly, too caught up on how easily he might have lost this, and he didn’t just mean identifying the curse. In fact, he wasn’t sure he meant the curse at all. He thought that the way Potter wouldn’t look directly at him might show he wasn’t alone in his thoughts.
They made their way down onto the sand, helping each other over rocks they could barely see. Draco leaned down to rinse his dirty hands in the water, shivering at the icy bite of the waves, and splashed his face several times until he could no longer feel his own skin.
He threw his hands up in the air. “Heaven forbid I treat the Saviour like a real human, capable of mistakes just like the rest of us. Silly me—I forgot you’re some kind of demigod instead.” He gave an elaborate bow. “Would you like your tribute in cash, or do you take credit?”
Draco sniffed delicately. “I suppose it’s too much to hope you could grow to learn the appropriate pureblood decorum?”
There’s a wave of a hand, a shimmer to the air, and then the pleasant taste of mouthwash overwhelms him. He parts Draco’s lips, caressing with his tongue until the tension disappears from Draco’s body and he melts down into the kiss. There is an answering hardness against Harry’s thigh, and with the hand that isn’t currently clasped behind Draco’s neck he squeezes the firm mound of Draco’s arse and pulls him closer.
The words broke through something inside Harry he didn’t know was there. Suddenly the restrained mask he kept seeing on Malfoy’s face all day made sense.
It watched him, tilting its hooded head to the side as though assessing him. Moonlight glinted as the tree outside his window swayed, and for a moment he saw a flash of what might have been a beak.
“What about you, Malfoy?” Ron asked, already halfway through a bottle of beer he’d pulled from somewhere. “What are you even studying?”
Harry reached out to adjust Draco’s lapel, and Draco ran a hand through Harry’s hair. They were as ready as they could ever be, and after sharing a final, secret smile, they stepped into the Floo and left to face the outside world together.
Draco shook his head mutely, and the words fell out like they were the most natural thing in the world, “I’m sorry I insulted you last night. I went too far. I didn’t mean to accuse you of abandoning your friends.”
Potter did, but Draco almost wished he hadn’t, because when he slid down to the ground, Potter didn’t let him go as Draco thought he would, but pulled him closer instead. The room felt smaller than before, his skin hypersensitive to the slightest movement against it. He wasn’t sure if he was imagining the look in Potter’s eyes, because there was no way Potter could be looking at him like that, not when he wasn’t drunk.
“Yes, Master Harry Potter?” asked Kreacher. “Do you wish the presence of Kreacher?” Kreacher bowed, saying, “Mister Draco Malfoy.”
So… I guess I AM a teen. I’ve never acted like one. In the last couple of years, I’ve had to grow up way too fast. I feel old now. I’ve always been a precocious prat… I’ll save that commentary for another day.
I was one of the lucky ones. My bottled-up fears did consume my life, but thankfully did not make me do anything that would have put me under six feet of dirt. Letting my emotions out was harder than getting Heinz sauce out of a bottle, but it is all working out well.
much. I envied it. I was jealous of your wonderful qualities that have made me feel welcome today. I can’t say
“To answer your questions,” began Harry, “yes, I trust him. The Veritaserum proved that last night. He’s also gay and has been kicked out of the Manor. He’s only got a small suitcase and three galleons to his name. He’ll be turned out of every Pureblood household. I just sound a little depressed because I don’t know how this is ever going to work. Molly, could you explain?”
They entered the kitchen and saw most of the family gathered around the table. “What’s this!?” asked Harry.
“So, you’d be good with a couple at a time, then maybe… in a while... when you’re ready... a Weasley family meal?”
“Harry, I know we said that we’d take a break from our intense histories for a few days, but could you tell me a bedtime story? Like… a fairy tale?”
“Did Hermione tell you that Kreacher told us about Ron’s fluffy hills and furry valley?” asked Harry.
frozen over. I’m sorry for underestimating all of you. Come on, let me show you the place. Draco, please help Kreacher get the food to the table.”
My problem is not that I don't know what my problems are, but that I don't know how to handle/solve my problems and lingering issues. Let's see.... I am lonely. I don't know how to meet friends without flashing loads of galleons. I am afraid of new things to the extreme. I hate myself. I can't place a value on my worthiness. My self-esteem is low. I treat myself like crap. I treat others better than I treat myself. I don't know how to cope with anything… I am miserable, I look at anything I do in a negative way. I feel that others don't value me. I feel that I am an annoyance to other people. I have problems accepting help from anyone. I have problems interacting with others… I let little things bother me. I cannot relax. I don't know how to really have fun. I haven't had a truly happy and good time in years… if ever. I still can’t produce a patronus. Harry will help me with that… I hope!
After their guests left, Draco and Harry showered and laid down on the bed. Harry let out a great sigh.
“I’ve read a lot about Pureblood courting and romance, but little else,” said Draco. “I get what you’re saying, though. I also want to be more than your... uh... fuck buddy.”
Rita Skeeter (Diagon Alley, London). Our Savior, the Golden Boy, the Boy Who Lived Twice, has been found to be hiding out in room 12 of the Leaky Cauldron. Certainly, the heir to the Potter and Black homesteads can afford to live in his own home. He was spending his post-war celebratory period with the Weasley home. Did the family of gingers kick the Savior out on his arse? Is the Savior a little too popular for the grieving family? Are his devious sexual proclivities too much for the Pureblood family?
?” smirked Draco, making hand signs. Ron and Hermione turned Weasley red. Everyone else laughed heartily.
Harry somberly said, “I know. It wasn’t just switches and whips. There were pieces of pre-cut lumber. There were paddles.” Harry paused and sighed. He was not facing Draco. “Are you okay?”
!? It couldn’t be! Harry had kept him out of Azkaban for the time being, but why would Malfoy be at the Leaky?
“No!” exclaimed Hermione, blushing furiously. “I like it,” she demurely stated. Pivoting, “Ahem! It looks like they printed our entire article on Skeeter with no changes. That’s a shocker!”
Harry interrupted, “That two ravishing young men with serious mental war wounds who have loved each other for years should be living together? I don’t know.”
Harry rolled over to face Draco and asked, “Luna?” Draco nodded. Harry asked, “Do you mind if we take a few days off from talking about the... unpleasant things? It’s a lot. I need time to process all of this.”
Draco looked into Harry’s eyes and said, “Everyone was so beautiful to me. This is what I’ve been missing in my life.”
“I appreciate your kind words, but that’s not how Purebloods see it,” said Draco. “I was more than aware of what could happen to me. I just thought that my mother might be more understanding.”
After all cloth barriers were removed, Harry began to passionately snog Draco. After a few minutes, Harry sent his right hand down between Draco’s thighs. Slowly, he pulled his hand up Draco’s vulnerable inner thighs until he found Draco’s scrotum. Harry gentle rolled it around in his hand, then made his way up to pass lightly over Draco’s now erect cock. He smiled at finding a very hard Draco in his midst. Harry stood up and pulled on Draco’s legs, then arms, until he was seated on the edge of the bed. Draco leaned back, propped up by his arms behind his back.
“That’s brilliant, Draco!” exclaimed Harry with building tears in his eyes. “I did. I sent the new owl. It was a great idea, sending Kreacher to Diagon Alley to buy it. Did you get a howler from Pansy yet?”
“Fine. Thanks, Kreacher,” replied Harry. “You may have any closet you desire. We do not need dinner for this evening. There’s a full larder. How did Headmistress McGonagall take the news about you leaving?”
A certain platinum blonde beauty of a Death Eater has been turned out of his noble family estate after revealing his shirt lifting antics. One no longer wonders what the family head is thinking whilst abiding his time in Azkaban.
Draco slowly increased the speed of his thrusts. Once he hit a pleasant pace a few minutes later, he was getting close. He began to stroke Harry’s leaking cock. In another minute, Harry and Draco were both screaming each other’s names, coming in harmony.
Draco pulled himself away from Harry. He had stopped crying and sheepishly asked, “How did Dumbledore keep doing that to you?”
Harry choked up, tears threatening to spill from his moistened eyes, “We’ll do whatever it takes. Will you excuse me for a moment?” Harry stood up and walked swiftly to his bedroom and closed the door. He began to cry, then fell flat on his face on the bed.
There were audible gasps around the room along with stunned expressions. “George?” asked Molly with a shaky voice, failing to hold back tears.
“It’s nice that they felt comfortable enough to come out,” said Harry. “You too. I’m elated that you had us go over there. I didn’t expect it this soon. Then again, this has been a whirlwind relationship.”
“Oh! you mean Ron’s fluffy hills and furry valley?” asked Harry. Draco nodded. Hermione and Ron blushed. “I’m surprised you can sit down Ron. I mean, you got zapped in the arse by a House Elf.” Ron looked cross while Harry, Draco, and Hermione howled.
“I came to Hogwarts with a scar, a flap, covering a significant portion of my anus. Going to the bathroom was an excruciating experience. On my second day, the skin tore, as it was wont to do. I went to Madame Pomphrey, and she fixed what she could. I later learned that she told McGonagall and Dumbledore. Minerva could do nothing, unfortunately. Albus could. He didn’t. End of story.”
“Nothing,” said Draco. “You’re the only one to know much of this. I’ve never felt like I could entrust this information to anyone before you, Harry. Merlin! I love you.”
After both men took a sip of the truth serum, they questioned each other, becoming content that the other was not lying.
Harry replied, “If I have to let them experiment with my wandless magic... yes. I’ll do anything for you. I hope you feel that.”
Draco and Harry answered the door of the flat. Luna was standing there in an elegantly flowing spring floor-length dress. Behind her stood… “Ginny!” shrieked Harry.
The door widens and Draco steps aside to let him in. When Harry enters the room, he sees two suitcases laid out on the bed and all of Draco’s things packed neatly inside. He wonders if Draco would have left without saying goodbye, and if maybe Harry actually deserved that.
“Your hair might look like it’s been plucked for broom bristles, but the just-shagged look suits you. It suits you so well, I just want to shove you up against a wall and take you apart whenever I see you.”
“Well, I don’t know,” Harry said, pretending to consider it. “What if you see some nice flowers I might like, and you don’t know which one to pick?”
“Listen,” Draco said carefully. “I have something I want to talk to you about. Can we meet after dinner?”
“I wasn’t sure how far I’d want to go, or if I’d like any of it,” Harry went on, tracing small circles across Draco’s back. He laughed suddenly. “And you were a surprise.”
Draco eyed off the food, but found he wasn’t really in the mood for something so decadent. “Shall we go for a walk through the gardens?”
Draco ran a hand through his hair and studied the idiot snoring on his chaise longue. He supposed there was a chance the curse would fail, unable to find any compatibility between them at all. But as much as the thought of becoming soulmates with Potter was not only ludicrous but frankly incomprehensible… Draco couldn’t risk those odds. He had to break it himself.
Which meant Potter wanted him with or without the Veela charms, and he was so deep in the wanting that he hadn’t even noticed Draco change.
Blaise shook his head and held up his hands, silently pleading for mercy. “I don’t mean that he’s manipulating you. He’s absolutely not. But please understand, Draco, before you continue with this, that if you’re not careful, you could get hurt. Really hurt. That doesn’t mean you don’t do it; it means you have to do it
“I cannot work with you on this if you’re going to insist on acting cryptically in ways that I can only assume are a threat,” Draco said tiredly, studying the wisps of fluff floating in the air—remnants of down feathers divested of their bodily shackles. “You didn’t even ask if I was allergic.”
There was no heat to his insult, though, and even if there had been, Harry was riding too high on excitement and nervousness to really have cared. Instead, he squeezed Malfoy despite his grumpy protest, and let him to his silence.
Pansy sighed. “It’s never that easy, not when it matters. Did you try to do what you thought was right?”
Harry’s head drops back involuntarily at the soft moan that falls from Malfoy’s lips. In that second of distraction, when he is staring at the ceiling and wondering if he has taken the first step down the road to madness, he feels soft lips close around him.
After sweeping his hand in a wide arc, which seemed to Draco as though it did nothing but send faint sparkles floating up into the sky, Potter slowly turned the handle and opened the door.
Unease settled on Potter’s features, along with another glimpse of the rage Draco had seen earlier. “Unless you remember how I hurt you, I guess.”
“You know I wanted you so much I actually started to smile when I thought of those stupid badges?” Harry said conversationally.
And he really wanted the answer. Potter seemed to know something Draco didn’t, and since Draco’s own research diving into his ancestral books had proven largely unhelpful, he wanted to know what it was.
They stared at one another. They stared so long, Draco felt only something truly momentous could break the moment, but then all Potter said was, “Pure-bloods really like peacocks, hey.”
“Congratulations, gentlemen,” she purred, just as the entrance doors swung open and Weasley and Granger burst through.
“I’d love to join you… sometime,” Potter said slowly. “But maybe not now? I’m feeling a little—” He broke off and shuddered. “This has been great. I really enjoyed myself, but I think I need a break now. I think I need to be alone.”
Potter thrust inside. It was a slow slide to the base, but once he was in he quickly began to move, reckless and unsteady. The distant sound of laughter and voices drifted up over the balcony; the wind was easing and people were braving the elements once more. But up on the second floor, it was still just as wild as before. The doors of the balcony rattled in the breeze, the curtains pulled taught in Draco’s fist.
It was intoxicating, too, not knowing what that something would be or how it would look when it finally arrived.
Potter paused, a small frown marring his features. “Malfoy… Are you all right? We don’t have to if you don’t want to.”
The hitch of Malfoy’s breath nearly unravels him. It’s so real, so believable, that for a moment he questions his own sanity. Then he pushes it aside and gives in to the moment.
He turned and, pointedly ignoring them, began unpacking his trunk and setting up his side of the room.
Malfoy paused, turning blank grey eyes back to him. The silence was waiting to be filled, so Harry filled it.
Potter smirked. “It can be easy to lose yourself in these dream-states,” he said, running his hand down the cord until his fingers lightly brushed the top of the anchor. “Anything real and tangible helps prevent that from happening.” He looked up suddenly, and Draco felt caught in the intensity of his gaze. “You don’t need to worry; I’ve done this before. Not for this spell, but for many, many others. I’m good at it. My magic is tuned to the anchor,” he gave it a little wave, “and the second we start to lose ourselves, I’ll feel it. I’m not going to let us get consumed by this curse, Malfoy, so just focus on figuring out how it works.”
Rifling through the briefing, Harry began to pay attention to the beginning theories this time instead of the conclusions they’d drawn so far. He needed to go back to basics.
Granger stuck her head around the corner and waved at him. “I thought I heard your voice, Draco! Did Harry tell you we were here?”
He could still hear Potter breathing behind him, and he distantly acknowledged that, for the first time, he had truly unnerved him.
“Yeah, you know, houses in areas that have been targeted a lot. High crime areas.” He cleared his throat. “Families with Squibs. Half-bloods in pure-blood districts.”
“You get some odd ones, Harry,” Weasley mumbled around a mouthful of pastry. “What about that wizard who went to Durmstrang? The one who kept hinting he had a sex dungeon.”
“Malfoys often have Unicorn hair as our wand core,” Draco spat, clenching his mug tighter. “Are you calling me a liar?”
They divided the presents and soon there were shreds of paper flying everywhere as they wrapped and taped and stacked. Draco managed to sneak eighteen pieces of tape onto Harry’s sweater, but then he realised Harry had somehow managed to wrap his belt buckle when he wasn’t looking, and he was forced to insist on a draw.
But chaos descended, and Potter—naturally—fought him as the enemy, wrestling him for his wand. Even still, it wasn’t until Dobby proclaimed that he had come to rescue
Malfoy pulled back immediately, the eager anticipation on his face fading to be replaced by what looked like, against everything Harry would have expected, concern.
He slid slowly to the base, eyes on Draco the entire time, before retreating backwards and pulling off with a faint
“Merlin, Harry,” Draco whispered, grabbing his arm and pointing to a bush off the side of the path. “I think we’ve found them. I thought it would take days!”
He wasn’t only asking one question, and he wondered if Potter knew it. How was he so certain Draco could do it? How was he so certain he
“The only thing I can do,” Draco said with a wry smile. “My feelings aren’t important right now. I’m going to keep this up as long as it takes to get Potter the help he needs.”
“Oh, come on. We were all there; don’t try to pretend it didn’t happen. Every other second it was ‘Potter this’ and ‘Potter that’. I was always worried it was going to be worse when you became friends, but it never happened so I thought you’d gotten over it.” She took a second to roll her eyes, pinching the bridge of her nose between two manicured fingernails. “Of course, now that you’ve discovered he’s got some deep and tragic story to go along with the bad hair and glasses, you can’t take your eyes off him.”
And then, he and Potter could go their separate ways, and he could put this whole, sodding mess behind him.
Harry grabbed hold of his wrist and pulled him into a kiss. “The trick is all in the levitation charm,” he said easily, brushing their lips together and running his hands up through Draco’s hair.
Malfoy reached his hand forward, just a little, and took hold of Harry’s fingers. They both looked down, watching where their hands met, pale white against bronze skin.
Potter came to stand beside him, hand resting on Draco’s shoulder. It was warm and comforting, and he had to fight the urge to just close his eyes and lean into it. His fingers landed on the small piece of glass, and he took it out and whispered the charm over the top.
The times when he wasn’t in therapy, Draco worked from his apartment. He conducted meetings via Floo call, arranged paperwork via owl, and started to enjoy his time alone. He’d never much liked being alone. The silence would build in his ears until he started to hear things and he had to run, to escape. But it was different now. He could play whatever music he wanted, whenever he felt like it. He ate in fine restaurants, enjoying the atmosphere just as much as the food. There was no need to pretend, no need to put on a mask just to get by in simple interactions.
Potter seemed to relax at the clear sign of dismissal. He shifted to face Draco more directly, a genuine smile beginning to appear on his face. Draco’s shoulders relaxed, just a fraction. Maybe tonight was salvageable. Maybe it wasn’t going to fall apart.
But he couldn’t bring it in himself to regret it, and with a rush of affection, he pulled Malfoy down into a kiss.
Power radiated from the Sanctuary, ancient, furious power, but the clueless wizard on his path continued on, dooming them all. Draco sank back into the bushes—which had become, through Draco’s discomfort, the bushes of the present—unwilling to watch the moment the Veela cursed him.
And then, it hit him, flooding back in an awful, painful rush, and before he knew it he was in Potter’s arms, his fingers twisted violently in Potter’s hair while their lips met furiously, the two of them pushing and shoving at each other like they hadn’t yet decided if they were fucking or fighting. Possibly, they hadn’t, and it wasn’t until Draco’s shirt was pushed back off his shoulders and Potter’s mouth dropped back to his neck, to that faint mark, that he was certain at all.
He turned back to his friends, still grinning. Hermione looked thoughtful while Ron goggled between the two of them unattractively.
Draco stopped reading the paper when it kept publishing ridiculous lies about the pair of them. But if he’s started reading it again, maybe he’s stopped caring about the articles?
Potter answered, emerging from the bracken lining the shadowy south side of Draco’s front fence. A line of hopeful peacocks and one peahen followed him. “Yeah. Thought so.”
And there was the conversation with Granger. She’d said he hadn’t changed. Granger was smart; surely, she’d know if Potter carried this much damage from the war. So, if that was the case, what did it all
“Did it work?” Potter asked, brushing his hair back out of his eyes and adjusting his position against the balustrade.
His cock is already rising to the occasion, half-hard and getting harder when Draco slides further down the deck chair and laves a line along it with his tongue.
“Every other record of this spell had the wizard appearing in front of the curse. The fact that we were always inside it was the final clue,” Draco explained. “It told us the curse’s purpose, though we didn’t realise it. The whole thing was made to trap someone inside and then disappear—when it became aware of us last time, right at the start of the session, instead of going into an intruder-induced craze and eating us, it assumed it had succeeded. It was getting ready to take us away.”
Draco blinked at her. “Neither.” And then, because he had to give the right impression, “We talked.”
?” She hissed. “Bollocks. As if I’d tell anyone apart from you. It’s only going to make the prat more desirable and famous. I’d sooner spread a rumour that he’s been fired and sent away to herd sheep in Ireland.” Her eyes brightened. “Do you think—”
Against all odds, Malfoy’s teasing was actually helping to make him feel more relaxed instead of riled up like it usually did. He was really coming to enjoy the new and improving Malfoy, the sarcastic bastard that he was.
The moon was almost full, banishing all but the most secretive of shadows from the night. Harry took in the lines of Malfoy’s face, the harshness of his cheek bones and chin, the way his neck caved in the centre before rippling into sharp collar bones beneath the sheer line of his shirt. All those years of watching him, and he had never noticed how beautiful he was.
“You said something was wrong with your magic,” Draco said when he realised too long had passed with him staring at Potter’s arse. The gold had fortunately faded from his irises, but he’d bet the curse wouldn’t need much to get going again. “What does it do?”
They made their way out of the pub, leaning on each other’s shoulders and stumbling to a nearby alley where they could use the Portkeys Granger had brought with her.
Harry drew in a breath. Malfoy was watching him with hungry eyes, and Harry no longer knew if it was for his body or for the words he was saying or if it was just for him… just him.
The Healers shoved a Portkey into Potter’s hands and disappeared with a flash just as Blaise Apparated into the restaurant, dressed in nothing but a silk robe with water pooling on his skin and hair.
By evening, the shopping had done what it had been intended to do. Draco felt more at ease within his own skin, and just the knowledge that he was about to visit Eleanor, who would without a doubt carry him through whatever mess he’d backed himself into, filled him with a sense of calm. He took his time getting ready, dressing with care but choosing not to conceal the lines and shadows on his face, and left.
“The anchor keeps us linked to ourselves and to the curse,” Potter added quietly. “The only times the spell ever went wrong were when the person controlling the anchor let themselves get pulled too far one way. You don’t want to end up with someone who doesn’t know what they’re doing, or who panics at the last second and tries to anchor you back to yourself when you’re still tied to the curse.”
Hermione and Ron had arrived before them and were occupying one of the couches in the corner off to the side. It was situated in front of a fireplace, which was flickering with a small fire to keep the room warm and modestly dry.
Still, he was a professional, and Potter was an idiot, so he pushed the thought out of his mind as best he could. By the time he opened the door to Potter that afternoon, he was more likely to hex him than snog him, and that was exactly how Draco liked it.
A surprised laugh escaped Harry’s lips, and when he looked up to see Malfoy smirking sheepishly, he couldn’t stop. Soon, Malfoy joined him, the sound carrying clear and bright across the roofs of London.
They bid goodnight to the others and Flooed back to Potter’s apartment. At first, Draco thought they must have gone to the wrong place, it was so dark and cold. But when Potter turned on the lights, Draco recognised the faces in the picture frames that sat on the mantelpiece, and he knew they were home. The photos were the only decoration in the living room, and the furniture was sparse at best.
to create a barrier that made his cock glitter faintly. Grinning shakily at Draco, he retrieved the vial and slicked himself up.
“You’re wearing the same clothing,” he said. “I know your sense of taste is irreparably damaged, but you still show a tendency to shower regularly. Did something happen last night?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “So, naturally, you take me here for our first date. Typical. I feel like a werewolf who’s been unwillingly scent-marked.”
“I’m fairly certain you faced a hurdle or two when you took down Lord Voldemort,” Draco drawled, searching for that cutting tone that would rile Potter just enough to make him lash out rather than run. “It didn’t stop you then. What’s the difference now?”
The sincerity and love in his eyes is too much; Harry looks away, but he doesn’t draw back his wrist.
Harry didn’t understand it. In particular, he couldn’t wrap his head around the fact that people were brazen enough to have sex so baldly and without any discernable need for privacy or any consideration for the people who may or may not have been unwittingly handed front row seats for the showing.
It was as if all the air had been sucked out of the room. Draco couldn’t look up, couldn’t see the expression on Blaise’s face. So he just kept talking.
Harry stared at the ceiling, eyes wide in the darkness. “I’ve never had sex before,” he said, a split second before his mind caught up to his mouth and he realised two things very quickly: firstly, that he actually was quite a bit more drunk than he had thought, and secondly, that the only way out of this situation was to dive headfirst into the lake and never come out.
“I can’t believe you still only have one set of dress robes,” Hermione muttered, fond exasperation on her face. She turned back to Harry and Draco. “It’s good to see you both! It’s been nearly a month, hasn’t it? I’m so sorry. This little one has been sick, and we’ve all been a bit frantic, but we can’t let it get so long between visits again.”
Potter’s shirt had already ridden up, exposing the fine hairs that trailed down his belly and below his waistband. Draco peeled the shirt over Potter’s head and threw it behind them where it landed in shadow by the bed. His jeans quickly followed, landing on the crumpled pile of fabric and leaving Draco with the breathtaking vision of Potter’s skin bathed in moonlight.
“I’m in,” he said, waving his hand so that his clothing flew across the room to his lap. “We should get her something, too.”
are talking about manipulating society.” He raised a hand against Potter’s objections. “Manipulation is a dirty word, but it doesn’t have to be. You’re not lying. You’re not deceiving. You are simply considering what you want the public to see and how that might affect how you want the public to act. You want them to understand the consequences of their prejudice—yes? That’s why you wanted to accompany that family to the station. You want them to understand that the Ministry will not stand for the sorts of attitudes that led to the rise of a Dark Lord, and on a deeper level—a level you don’t entirely understand yet because it’s not a way of thinking you’re familiar with—you want them to be faced with the direct impact of those prejudices.
Potter awoke from his undignified stupor in time to step the last remaining foot into Malfoy’s space, bringing them nose to nose, and glared. “I’m not asking you to do anything,” he insisted, as entitled liars do. “I’m requesting your
Potter hesitated, but finally nodded. “I’d like to go back in and work out what happened, but we can’t,” he agreed reluctantly.
Harry awoke sometime after midnight, but well before dawn could appear. He padded softly out onto the balcony, barefoot despite the chill in the air that soaked up through the stone floor, and kneeled down to study the dial. It hadn’t stopped spinning yet, not that he thought it would, and he quickly moved away before he could feel too queasy watching the movements.
He glared at the offending item for several moments more before knocking back his glass of mulled wine and summoning the bottle of Firewhiskey to replace it.
Draco wasn’t offering, but his body betrayed him all the same, his cock already stirring with interest. He knew all the hidden alcoves of Blaise’s house, knew exactly where to go to ensure they wouldn’t be disturbed.
“Pure-bloods won’t let the program through if they believe it’s giving preferential treatment to Muggle-borns and half-bloods,” Draco reminded him patiently.
Now that he was faced with the real thing, he was beginning to wonder if there was more to it. If maybe these small changes that Malfoy was making didn’t extend to something more, something deeper. Which meant that Harry might have to change too.
Penned at the top of each checklist was a note Draco had only ever skimmed before. It had become part of the scenery—irrelevant to the young Veela descendant who cared only for what might happen to him now. The future was irrelevant.
“Since this is written in your chicken scratch, I’m guessing I already have. Rather than waste time, let’s just get our memories back.”
Potter stood and crossed the room, standing a careful distance from Draco. His eyes were wide and skittish.
Draco laughs, and Harry gives in. He does as Draco says, edging up the bed and lying still. He gives Draco a wink and closes his eyes.
“Don’t look so pleased with yourself,” Malfoy snapped, though Harry noticed he wasn’t moving away and didn’t especially look like he was going to hex Harry in the immediate future. “You caught me off guard tonight is all. Next time, I’ll be more prepared. You were the one who came faster than a virgin being touched for the first time.”
He lifted a hand in farewell and followed Potter out into the corridor, just as Percy and Ginny passed by them.
Draco lifted his eyebrows and, with a savage and malicious glee, let go of his hold on the glamour that kept his Veela charms hidden.
?” Malfoy asked after it was clear Harry wasn’t continuing. “Inhale three treacle tarts at dinner? Spill half of your mashed potato on my shoe? Act like a—” he cut himself off abruptly.
Potter’s eyes darkened, and he moved forward with a lurch, eyes glazed and filled with desire. It opened up a pit of yearning within Draco’s heart, seeing a future he could never have become real before his eyes. This curse might well be the worst thing that had ever happened to him, because there was nothing in it he could trust, and—he was slowly, painfully realising—everything that he had always wanted.
“What?” he whispered, feeling suddenly sick. The first two had run out, and this final one seemed shorter, half the sand already gone. “But there’s no execution now, is there? What does it want from us?”
Granger’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. “Well, that’s more than we’ve ever gotten.” She shared a rueful glance with Weasley.
“You and me.” Potter’s gaze held him captive. “If we’d been on the same side, what could we have done together, Malfoy?”
For a second, he thought he saw a spark of lightning behind him, above the balcony, but when he turned nothing was there. He spun back to the exit. Malfoy was already racing across the floor. He grabbed the handle and rattled it, but nothing changed.
Draco remembered only a few days ago when he had thought Potter was hiding something, or a few weeks before that when he had thought simpering heroism was all Potter was capable of. He knew that wasn’t true now; he knew that Potter was complex and flawed, and that, somehow, it made Draco want him more. No matter the emotions he saw on Potter’s face now, he didn’t feel afraid or rejected or unsure—he just felt certain that this was the man he wanted. They didn’t always match, but nothing ever did.
A rush of heat flooded Draco’s body. He was sure it was tinting his cheeks pink. Hopefully he could just blame the cold. “Quite sure,” he replied, only a little breathlessly.
“What do you mean, are we sure? We’re as sure as we can be. I mean, you’ve seen him at his worst. It still happens, but it’s never as often as it was.”
Still, the slowly unfurling bud of hope in his chest shrivelled again and died; so much for a weekend spent actually talking to someone again. He and Malfoy might be civil enough these days, but it was better for both their sakes—and the sake of their mission—if they just shut the hell up.
His breathing began to slow, his eyes drifting closed as they just held each other, warm beneath the stars, heartbeats thudding gently against each other’s chests. It should have been awkward, but Harry’s emotions were far too warped these days for him to bother with that. He didn’t care.
Draco scoffed. “That’s because I wasn’t wrong, Potter. Why were you with her for so long if you weren’t even attracted to her? The advice I gave She-Weasley wasn’t wrong, and she most certainly wasn’t wrong in taking that advice.
Potter flushed slowly, and Draco realised he had been staring at Potter with something akin to disbelief in his eyes. Draco did feel a slight hint of disappointment since the breakup meant that Potter did not, in fact, have a red room or a basement with freaky toys in it. Did that mean that She-Weasley’s face and body was not what Potter imagined when he masturbated? Who did he imagine he was having sex with then?
Potter sat next to him, quietly sipping his own tea. “It’s perfect,” he said, and his shoulders relaxed. A peaceful look crossed his face as he gazed off into the distance.
Potter’s cheeks reddened, and it was a charming look on him. If only Potter wasn’t such an absolute prat and didn’t hate him so much, they would have gotten along just fine. “Well, you didn’t exactly ruin my life this time. I mean— it isn’t—” Draco raised his eyebrows as he took a sip of his tea and Potter’s cheeks darkened. “The person you wrote about in the magazine, the one you said you imagined…imagined…”
magazine and he’s got the brightest green eyes.” Draco tried to hide his face in the mug of tea he was drinking. “You should hear him when he talks and see the way he walks. It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen or heard before.”
magazine. He was quite proud of it if he was honest with himself. He had argued with himself for days when the idea for his next topic for the sex advice column had popped into his head. Draco took turns with answering sex-related questions from his fellow readers and choosing a particular sex-related topic to write about in his column.
“That is ridiculous, Potter. I haven’t seen She-Weasley since the war,” Draco scoffed. Potter’s hand still held his arm.
to him, as those teeth bit into Draco’s skin and that tongue licked a trail down Draco’s body. The things Draco had imagined doing to Potter, had imagined Potter doing to him had been too many to count and too embarrassing to speak of.
Draco opened the door calmly, with a mug of tea in his hands and offered it to Potter, who looked like he was about to burst into flames of rage. “Ah, Potter. You have arrived just in time. Here’s your tea.”
