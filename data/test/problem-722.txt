After a quick visit to the kitchens to speak with the Elves and a stop at the library, Harry jogged back to the eighth year tower and slipped back into the common room. Draco had moved up to sit in the chair, legs folded beneath him and blanket draped across his shoulders. “Come with me,” Harry whispered, setting the book down on one of the spindly tables and holding the door open for Draco. Harry led them through the halls and down countless flights of stairs until they reached the kitchens. Draco gave Harry a questioning look and he merely smiled back. It was warm, in the kitchens, and a peppy Elf with wide blue eyes was waiting expectantly for them. “I is Missy, sir, and I has your ingredients all ready for you,” she said, leading them over to a table and a stove. Harry watched as comprehension dawned on Draco’s face as he took in the array of milk and cream, cocoa and chocolate and cinnamon.
“I promise. If I’m honest, he reminds me of someone I know. Stubborn, a bit of an attitude,” Harry said and looked directly at Draco. Draco flushed and turned away.
“Me too, really. It’s a shame we’ve only got one more full day here,” Harry sighed. “I wish we could stay longer,” he continued, stealing Draco’s thoughts and putting them into words. “But—”
Maggie, who was brushing the same white pony that had snuffled Draco’s hand earlier, took one look at their dripping clothing and rushed off into an open door at the back of the stable. She returned moments later, laden with towels. She set them on a small table, before taking a closer look at Harry’s muddy bum. “Did Bear throw you?” she asked, and Harry nodded. She shook her head. “Knew there was something I forgot to tell you,” she mumbled to herself. “No matter! If you’ll just lead the horses into a crosstie, I’ll have them haltered and untacked for ya. Fiona!”
“No, it’s fine,
“Well, it’s a good thing you’re a Healer, then.” Harry kissed the tip of his nose, then tipped his head back and yawned loudly, poking Draco gently in the shoulder to get him to lift his head off of Harry’s legs. He stood up and pulled Draco to his feet, slipping an arm around his waist to steady him on the way to the bathroom. Obviously tired, he helped Draco slowly undress before prodding him into the shower and undressing himself. Draco turned the water up until the shower was filled with steam, and Harry climbed in behind him. He rested his forehead on Draco’s shoulder and reached in the general direction of the shampoo and conditioner bottles. Draco smiled and handed him the bottle of apple shampoo, which he began lathering gently into Draco’s hair.
Harry reappeared moments later, laden with two bowls of something steaming. “I made chicken noodle soup, in case your stomach is a bit weak,” he explained. “Now budge up, I want to sit.” Harry nudged at Draco’s feet until he brought them up to his chest and settled the bowl on top.
that, but I wanted to try,” Harry sighed and grabbed a rolling pin from next to the flour canister.
It was the nap, he surmised, as he slid out of bed sometime after Harry had finally fallen asleep beside him. He grabbed a pair of Harry’s trainers by the door and resized them to fit his feet, before quietly slipping out the door and shutting it gently behind him. Draco hadn’t left with a clear goal in mind, only that for once it wasn’t raining and he wasn’t about to spend another however long that was laying and staring at the ceiling. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw a small stone path. Curious, he followed it around to the back of the house and down to the edge of the lake. He rolled up the bottoms of his joggers and tugged the sneakers off, walking along the small pier and sitting on the edge, sticking his toes into the gently lapping water. It was about as cool as he expected, given the chill in the air the rain had left behind.
He stepped onto the mounting block and put his foot into the unfamiliar stirrup, before grabbing the horn and the cantle and pulling himself into the saddle. He nudged Ember away from the block and over to a break in the trees, where he assumed the trail was. Draco watched with no small amount of amusement as Harry struggled.
“No, it’s just—you’ve never made pizza before.”
“Um, yes. Is there a problem?”
“Those two squirrels out there, fighting over that chip. I’m quite curious as to who will win,” Draco mused. “Personally, I’m rooting for that striped one. He looks more deserving.” Harry rolled his eyes.
Waking up was a slow thing. First his mind, as it fell away from dreams and into the present. And then it was his body. Which was altogether different, as almost immediately Draco realised he was pressed up against someone. Or rather, they were pressed up against him. Harry was snuggled close, an arm and a leg both thrown over Draco, and he was still sound asleep. Silently panicking, he ever-so-carefully removed both of Harry’s limbs from his torso. He let out a breath when Harry only slept on, oblivious to Draco’s inner turmoil.
. “What are you making?” Draco asked.
He settled back against the pillows and closed his eyes. A minute or two later, a finger poked at his shoulder until he popped an eye open and glared at Harry. “Nope,” he said, shaking his head. “Sorry. Do you want my help getting to the sitting room? I think you’ll be more comfortable there, and we can watch a film.”
Pain. Pain was the first thing Draco felt when he woke up. Head, arms, legs, chest.
He rummaged through the cupboards in search of tea things, and procured a box of Earl Grey tea bags and a small container of sugar. The kettle he found in a different cupboard above the stove. Mugs with various ridiculous designs were above the sink, along with mismatched plates and bowls. He took out a mug patterned with multicoloured cacti and filled the kettle with water before setting it on the stove and starting the burner with a flick of his wand.
,” he whispered, and was pleasantly surprised when it swung open as if pushed. Unlike
Once clean, Draco dressed in a clean pair of flannels and one of Harry’s Muggle band shirts, slipping under the quilt and sheets and sliding his arms around Harry’s stomach. “I’m sorry I slept through the day and ruined what you had planned,” he whispered against Harry’s neck.
“Yes. I planned this trip entirely for you, you daft arse. I can tell work is stressing you out so I wanted to get you away from, well,
Not long after, Harry’s quiet, triumphant “Yes!” cut through the comfortable silence and he turned into a small car park. They got out and dashed to the door, laughing.
for Harry to read. After some rearranging of clothing, he found the small grey cover hidden beneath the banana swim trunks, and he smiled a bit at the memory of Harry dropping them on his bed while he was in the bathroom packing his toiletries. He grabbed the book and strode back into the sitting room, where, to his mild outrage, Harry had completely stolen his couch and wrapped himself fully in the quilt. “You are a menace,” he announced, dropping the book in the general vicinity of Harry’s head and being rewarded for a small
Draco watched from his limited view on the sofa as he chopped carrots and celery and some sort of meat before doing something on the stove, content with sipping his (much cooler and non-tongue-burning) tea and observing. Not long after, a rumble of distant thunder cut through the relative silence of the cabin, and Draco looked over the top of the sofa just in time to see a bolt of lightning streak across the sky. He wondered if the weather they’d had all weekend was customary for the region, or if Mother Nature was just keen on dampening them. The joke was on her, though, Draco thought. He loved thunderstorms.
“About three hours from when I got in the shower, which was maybe thirty minutes ago?” Harry ventured, shrugging.
Draco stayed under the water for as long as he could, but when the tips of his fingers got wrinkly he reluctantly turned off the water and stepped out of the shower, drying his hair off with a towel. He dressed slowly, and when he exited the bathroom Harry was wrist-deep in a bowl of
Draco shoved the blanket back and stood up, half-shuffling to the kitchen to place his empty bowl in the sink before heading to the bedroom to retrieve
This, Jamie learned, was a sore spot for the old elf.
“I appreciate you sharing that with me.”  Harry replies, expression kind.  “I imagine that was a challenging time.  I
“You have Potter’s babies now though.”  Pansy points out.
“I think you know I want to
Jamie imagined that was what was locked in the attic.  Once in the early days of their move to Grimmauld, he and Al heard yelling there and scurried up to the third floor to see what was happening.  It sounded like Nan did whenever Granddad brought home an old muggle thingy.  A terrible screeching and angry words muffled by the distance.
James shrugs.  “Didn’t.  Dad did.”
It is distinctly terrible for Harry to watch Draco drinking from the cup he is offered with three drops of Veritaserum in it.  Adam’s apple bobbing.  Harry blames himself.  He was unable to protect Draco from the scrutiny of the ministry.  An organization he represents.  He should have foreseen this possibility.  The questions, gossip, and rumors he experienced in recent days – he thought – would be it from the ministry.  Particularly, since it seemed solely aimed at him.  He assumed it would ebb and flow as the media discovered more about them and wrote further disparaging articles.  Perhaps some verbal abuse from other ministry workers, maybe some from staff in his department.  But not this.  Not Draco hauled into an oversight hearing of all things.  His primary concern had been focused on Draco’s safety and he suspects that blinded him.
“Sorry for blathering on.  I know you’re Gin’s friend too . . .”  He trails off.  He trusts Luna implicitly, but he knew it was hard for their friends and family to hear why he and Gin didn’t work as a couple.  He usually avoided speaking about it.  But Luna was often an exception to topics he typically avoided.
They lean in to each other to kiss.  An automatic action on Harry's part from being near his boyfriend.  The sensation of their lips touching filling him with a sense of comfort and excitement.  His boyfriend breaks the kiss after a long moment, keeping close.
“He is so dreadfully scared of you.”  She says suddenly.  He cannot quite read her tone.  Somewhere between concerned and defensive.  Harry looks at her questioningly.  She smiles and clutches his arm tightly, eyes sharp.  “This is the shovel talk by the by in case you haven’t caught on.  You
“Where do you work?”
Harry pays for their food out of his own pocket, grabbing the paper napkins Malfoy insists on, and joining him on the bench.
can’t.”
“I care about you too.”  Astoria returns, biting her lower lip and gaze shifting to the ground.  Posture upright and expression troubled.
“What are you doing in here, boys?”  Draco questions evenly.  It will not due to scold them here.  He does not want one of them to try to run or fight one another as he has seen them do sometimes before when Harry confronts their misbehavior.  They could trip and something heavy could fall on them.  What if he was not quick enough to shield them?  What if it is one of the Black family's cursed heirlooms?
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry shrugs.  “She can live here.  I’ll give her a raise if you like considering this is a larger place.  Plus, the hazard pay for working with Kreacher and the sprogs.  Besides, it takes at least one house elf’s full attention to keep you running.”
Malfoy already knows that to remain undetected he cannot use a lot of magic and only in the cottage.  Harry did supply him with a small caldron and cache of potion-specific ingredients, but potion making was almost always undetectable by wider tracing spells wizards might use.
The man really should have been a Slytherin.  Gryffindors should never appear so calculating.
Lily jabbers away, holding his hand as they wait for the boys to be released.  Spelling the three letter words she has learnt at nursery school for baby Aaron.  Who did appear to be paying attention if only because someone loud and energetic was in front of him.
Pansy had two children.  Gabrielle being six and baby Aaron.  The baby, six months old if Draco recalls correctly, does not seem troubled by the loudness of his mother.  Aaron blinks slowly up at him.  Sleepy faced.  He rubs his face into Draco’s shirt.  Draco suspects the infant is trying to determine whether to continue pursuing sleep or not.
“She is a very nice lady, but we do not love each other the way people should when they decide to get married.”
“No.  Can’t say I did.”  Draco drawls out.
“So, moving in together is going well I see.”  Hermione remarks wryly.  Ron chortles in response.  Leaning back in his seat and placing his intertwined hands on his belly.  Expression thouroughly entertained.  Harry scowls at both of his best friends.
Narcissa first summoned him was a year or so after the end of the war to request his assistance dealing with a blackmailer.  He suspected she would invoke the life debt then, but he was wrong.  Instead, he helped her as best he could because he was an auror by that point and all too aware of his indebtedness to this woman.  He also felt a bit sorry for her.
“I wouldn’t know.”  Draco answers.  Fiddling with the step of his glass.
him.  He’s like a magnet for them.  It is hard for him to resist.  They are each so different.  It's the same way with brooms.
It’s a losing battle.  Not that he’ll admit that to Draco.  He can feel himself start to sweat as his boyfriend starts to undo his shirt.  Draco glances shyly up as he goes.  Revealing more skin flushed pink from Harry’s attention.  Clever fingers flicking open the fronts of his trousers as the slacks lower over trim hips.  Harry’s breath hitches at the dark, delicate cloth left behind.  All sensation rushing south.  Beginning to feel floaty rush he was seeking.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy.”
“Ooh.  Say it again.”  Harry teases with an ornery grin.  He wins either way.  His boyfriend will repeat his name or get flustered.  Draco rolls his eyes, ears turning pink.  Flustered, then.  Harry slides his thumb over an ear from where his hand is in Draco’s hair.  Is it weird to find another man’s ears attractive?  Is this a new kink?
“You’re range of motion at the knee is less this time around, I see.” Hargreeves informs, kneeling beside Harry’s chair, and finely adjusting the minute knobs on a metallic device that was currently encompassing Harry’s right knee.  Harry rather thought it looked a bit like a muggle toy he'd seen as a boy with its bended wires and beads going from one end to the other.  However, these were whirring along of their own accord.
“Work?”  Father repeats in a drawl, mouth sneering.  “How common.”
As Harry carries the brooms to the shed and locks them inside, James mimes out his prolonged agony.  Holding a hand over his heart and lying prostrate on the stone bench.  Albus prepared a few words in advance, on a tear-streaked, lined piece of paper.
“He’s young, Draco.  I bet he will come around to you.”  Pansy advises.  “After all, he may still be adjusting to his father dating.”
Ron harrumphs.  But no one else reacts.
Draco buries his face in his hands.  “You would bring that up, you cow.”
“How’re things?”
I liked men then.”
“Won’t you have a seat?”  Mrs. Malfoy proffers extending her hand to the unoccupied couch as the woman returns to her own spot by Mrs. Tonks.  “Dot will be back in a moment if you’d like refreshment.”
“Was it illegal?”
“Did you give up on the main building for today?”  Harry asks curiously.  Draco heaves a sigh as he finishes the charm and looks toward the sky.  Harry notices Draco's jacket is folded neatly by the man's feet and his sleeves are rolled back, revealing pale forearms.  It was rare for him to glimpse Draco's bare arms outside their bedroom.
Harry nods in acknowledgement.  “Ron.”
“But it
“That’s the thing – I
“No – not that.”  Harry responds, momentarily distracted.  He had suggested the charm to Draco for the manor restoration.  So far, every time Draco had tried to clear rubble or enter the skeletal remains of the west wing he had been prevented.  Harry tried to help once and was thrown back several yards.  His hands scalded.  Draco insisted on being the only one to attempt magical intervention on the main building after that incident.
“Oh.”  Harry voices, interest piqued.
“Oh.”  James replies, tone indicating disinterest.  “Sounds boring.”
didn’t even want to share a bed with me at the end of the row.  We’ve never slept apart if we were cross with each other before.”
“Well, I’ll be.”  Granddad says, expression curious.  “Who would've thought a Malfoy would be called a blood traitor?”
“We were doing fine without it.”
Draco stops in his tracks at the name.  Spinning back to scrutinize his old mentor.  Severus levels him with a sad expression.  Strangely poignant.
Draco is excited for their trip and looking over at Harry it is obvious his boyfriend feels the same.  Grinning back at him.  Green eyes shining.
“I’ve got it, Ron.”  Harry says, reaching his hand out to the tray.  Ron mirrors the action leading them to another stalemate.  Green eyes meeting blue in a battle of wills.
“You two
“I’m willing to try.”  Harry responds.  It was far from the first time he had volunteered for a new treatment after all.  There had been mixed results for him in the past, but he would do a lot to improve use of the leg.  A good part of why he continued coming to this clinic, beyond meeting his own needs, was to add to the ongoing research they were doing to help others.  The Mercury Clinic had already improved the lives of people in the magical and non-magical populations.  It was inspiring to be a part of that work.
Draco nibbles a bit at his snack, before putting it back down on the plate.  “She thought you might have hurt me.”
If he had only known what it would be like to be with Draco so intimately he would have tracked him down years ago and shown up on his doorstep everyday until Draco agreed to be with him.  He is so, so thankful that he followed his instinct to pursue Draco when they met again.  Draco is achingly sweet.  So loving.  He left Harry twisting with desire for him without even knowing he did it.
“Maybe later.”  James excuses, pocketing the wand.  Brown eyes shifting away from Draco’s observation.
The kids have been with Ginny all week.  It's been great to have more free time to be with Draco.  He misses his kids, but he does not dislike the time for himself.  A sort of routine has developed between him and Draco during this time.  Now, it's easier to meet up with Draco at his flat after work.  They have spent more time alone in one of their homes like this than ever before.
,” Al hisses beside him as the crup whines in his grip.  “Just bring ‘em in.”
Hestia extends a leg as they roll up their letter.  Draco seals it carefully with his wand after determining everything is in order.  They open the big window in the library to send her off.  Lily and Al watching from the window seat as she flies into the distance.
“What are they saying, Jamie?”  Al whispers looking caught as he hauls his much heavier and lumpier canvass bag.  Jamie sincerely hopes the portraits won’t notice it’s wriggling.  He hadn’t considered
equally possible this originated outside of them.  Any dark wizard or witch who is a student of history might make similar moves.  Riddle certainly learned from Grindelwald.”
“I will tell them the truth, Father.”  Draco had said.  Chest aching dully.  He had committed himself to being honest to a fault.  It was the one brave act he could do.  “I will tell them everything.”
“No, Draco.”  Severus refutes easily, tone dour.  “You
“’Kay.”  Albus agrees, eyelids falling shut.
This, in itself, was not unusual.  Although more often than one of his fellow deputy heads was also in attendance along with one or two members of the Wizengamot.  Instead, it is the four of them.  Kingsley Shacklebolt sat behind his immaculate walnut desk and the remainder of them in his orbit.  Hermione takes a seat, her briefcase neatly placed on her lap with the quill sticking out of it.
“Or just the manor.”  Draco adds, lifting his wand.
“’Arry?”  He croaks out once he stays conscious for an entire minute.  His throat is dry and it hurts to speak.  He cannot seem to feel much of the rest of his body which may be for the best.  There is some restraint where his right arm is, but he is unable to look over to confirm this.  He can see where a tube circles through the air and descends somewhere to his lower body.  Fluid passes through it every few moments.  Bringing him nutrients and hydration and removing his waste.
Draco is crying.
“This place is so much nicer.”  Teddy proclaims, gesturing around the dining room.
“You did it all for her, didn’t you?”  Draco says slowly, feeling as if he already knows the answer.  He was aware Severus acted as a double agent, but he did not know for certain until after his own trial that his professor was truly loyal to the Order of the Phoenix.
“That’s right.”  Jamie agrees, remembering.  It was scary when the old lady started screaming.  She was awful.  Draco didn’t like her either.  He had Dad take her away.  Then they lost their brooms because of it all.  That was a bad day.
The spare bedroom is unofficially his.  He even keeps clothes there.  They just installed a couple hooks on the wall to hang his robes.  Well,
It is not challenging to get into conversation with Albus.  Who is clearly a very precocious boy that has never met a stranger in his life.  Draco wonders how that could happen with the way Potter keeps them away from the press.  Lily the youngest is shy at first, eyeing him uncertainly from her spot beside her father.  She is slightly lighter in skin tone than her brothers and her hair is the vibrant red that marks her as a Weasley.  If only she knew how scared he was to meet her.  She may have be more confident then.  The older boy – James – does not open to conversation easily either.  Brown eyes growing bored as the conversation continues.
All alone in the hollow remains of her world.
house and tell you we need to talk.”
“No – I mean – I’m up for it.  Let’s go.”  Harry agrees eagerly, getting up as Draco spells the lights off with a flick of his wand.  There is an instant where he glimpses the man reflected by the streetlights outside and the dim light of lab behind the door.  Pale hair catching the glow like starlight.
Draco’s laugh is wonderful.  His smile thrilling.  The surprised joy that cracks through the man’s expression when Harry adds something Draco told him in an earlier conversation.  Showing he’s listening.  The quiet, endeared look Harry gets in those moments is a slowly burning ember in his heart.
Harry doesn’t get a chance to observe him long before Draco looks up, but he likes what he sees.  White blonde hair looser today, tucked behind one ear, and looking recently trimmed.  His boyfriend is dressed in a dark purple three-piece suit with a lightly striped, lilac button up underneath.  It isn’t one he’s seen before.  It looks good.  Handsome and brighter than what he usually gets to see on the man.  He notices Draco is still wearing the ring he gave him.  Part of Harry had been afraid it would be banished when he returned.  Instead, his boyfriend has it on as usual along with the cufflinks Harry gave him so many months ago.
to serve them last time.  Gaze lingering on Draco while his boyfriend took a drink.
“Oh.”  Harry voices, smiling at her awkwardly and hunching his shoulders slightly.  Feeling a bit embarrassed.  They had been lovers for over ten years.  “No.  We’re not.  Should I apologize?”
“And Mr. Draco is . . .
under any circumstances wish to be minister of magic.
Sometimes Dad’s answers ended like that and Jamie knew not to ask more.  Al tried occasionally which Jamie could tell made Dad uncomfortable and sad even if he did normally respond.
“I liked feeling loved.”  He replies slowly, gathering his thoughts.  “I liked feeling I legitimately belonged somewhere and wasn’t being begrudgingly tolerated.”  Harry tells her.  “I never felt loved or wanted growing up so once I got a taste of it, I wanted it all.  I didn’t get married for entirely the right reasons, but they weren’t wrong ones either.”
“But that’s it, isn’t it?  A part of it anyway?”  Ron speculates with a deeply unhappy look on his face.  “You two are used to – you know – a lot or
“I’ll try.”  Draco whispers.
Jamie shrugs in turn.  “He’s alright, I guess.”  It seems weird again.  He can’t quite put his finger on why though.  Why wouldn’t Dad tell them about having a friend join them for dinner?  Dad always said something if they were going to meet up with Luna or Neville.
“He isn’t wrong.”  Harry jokes.  “I have been known to excite both witches and wizards alike.  It is a gift and a curse.”
“Not too bad.”  The mirror tells him cheerily.  “Fix the cuffs though, dearie.”  Harry does as he is told as Kreacher shuts one of the bureaus with a snap of his fingers and Harry’s shoes tap dance out to greet him.  Harry grins.
Harry sags in on himself causing Ginny to laugh.  He has to think.  There had been fleeting feelings and thoughts that were unconscious for years.  So many he wrote off, not knowing enough to pay attention to it especially when the attraction to women was so very present.  He suspects the war also played a significant part in delaying the realization.
“Hopefully, nothing further comes of it.”  Mrs. Malfoy comments.  “Perhaps those magizoologists you invited to dinner might have some theories?  I understand Mr. Scamander is a prominent figure in that field.”  She drawls.
“I will pick you up after nursery school on Monday.”  He informs her calmly once again.  Having told her this before last night.  “Mummy is going to look after you for a few days.  You’ll be with your brothers.  You’ve stayed overnight here before just fine.  You’ll be okay.”
Draco can understand that desire although for very disparate reasons.  He has avoided crowded wizarding areas since the war.  The first few sojourns into the ministry during his probation taught him to dread and avoid them.  Living in France was significantly better.  The hatred less intense from the wizarding community there.  The dark lord’s hold on the country had been tentative during the second war.  Only just infecting the Ministère des Affaires Magiques de la France.  Still, Draco found himself more comfortable with creature folk in that country.  The Malfoy name was well-ruined in those days – not that it was much better at present.
His cock is definitely interested in the goings-on now.  Their bodies moving languidly with each other as Harry moves slowly, eyes on him.
They’re able to clean up quick after they wash the crup in the tub.  Doing their best to get all the dirt and debris out of her fur.  He’s glad he thought to wash
“Oi, I saw that!  Don’t think I didn’t!”
“Forgive me for having full sets of furniture because I’m a functional adult.”  Draco drawls, sounding put upon.  “I would prefer not to live in the mismatched remnants or your Gryffindor, post-divorce décor.”
engraved on the lid.  Medieval in make.  He doubts anyone has laid eyes on it since his great-great-grandfather redid the hall.  He concentrates on wrapping heat around his chest.  Concentrating on how he wants it to fix everything, every horrific thing that has happened here.  Everything dark and foul remaining.  It may very well be the last thing he does.  Releasing a spout of flame to encompass the core fully with the last of his strength and determination.
“Thank you.”  Rolf says graciously.
Harry takes him by the hand, and they hold the ticket between them.  Watching the clock tick down to when the enchantment will activate.  The familiar sensation of being pulled through time and space always leaves him a bit dizzy.  Draco has
Harry knows Draco is cautious.  His job requires it.  His survival did once.  It’s the constant vigilance that only fades when tucked away with those you trust most.  Those first few times they meet before they’re even dating, Harry finds himself pushing.  Already wanting.  Unable to stop.  Needing more of that unguarded quality.
“Flatterer.”
almost noon.  It’s even sunny outside today which gives him a bit more energy.  So when Malfoy doesn’t answer the first knock on the bedroom door or the second, Harry slowly opens the door further and walks quietly inside.
like reporters.
“I am not his social secretary.”  Draco states, tone unamused.
They meet again for a kiss.  Every bit of him thrums with how much he has missed this.  He is even more pleased when Draco opens easily and lets their tongues roll against each other.  An electric rush filling him with heat as he feels his heart beat that much faster.  The hot puffs from their breathing intermingling as Harry hastily opens both their trousers so he can get a hand on them.  Magically lubing up his own palm as he goes.  He tries to push Draco backward as he ruts up against him, but it doesn’t quite work out as they both fall with a thump to the oriental rug beneath them.  Knocking the air out of him at least as he takes the brunt of the landing.
“You only go in there if you have Olta’s permission.” Draco cautions them from outside the house elf’s room.  “This is her home too.”
“I need to locate the core."  He responds, trying to refocus on his goal.  "I can attempt to restore the original spell or cleanse it or something then.  That is the only way I can escape this place.”
Draco couldn’t resist jabbing. “How romantic, Harry,” he teased. Harry went a bit red. How interesting. “But seriously. If only I’d known, I would have brought my riding gear,” he sighed dramatically. Harry rolled his eyes and the flush faded from his cheeks. Draco was sad to see it go.
“Is that your official Healer’s diagnosis?” Harry teased, walking over and placing the mug, blue with dolphins this time, beside the bed. He looked suspiciously like he was trying not to laugh, and as he sat at the foot of the bed let loose a small snort. Draco scowled.
“Yes, I’m almost done, I just need to pack those ridiculous swimming trunks you bought me, and I’ll be ready to go,” Draco responded with an eye roll, grabbing the bright aqua-green coloured shorts dotted with bananas off of the bed beside his leather duffel bag. “Seriously Potter, why bananas?”
“Her name is Luna Lovegood. She’s lived here for about four years?” Harry tried. He ripped off a chunk of toastie and dunked it in his soup, before eating the whole thing in one bite. He grinned at Draco’s cringe.
Harry jumped to his feet. “Stay
“Why did you not wake me up for dinner, then?”
“And I’ve never tried on beds before, I wouldn’t want it to be stuck accidentally as a table.” He set the leather duffel at the foot of the bed and surveyed the room. It was small, which was to be expected considering the size of the cabin. But what lacked in space was made up for in decoration, as Luna had somehow managed to fit a full bed, two bedside tables, an armchair, and bookshelves, without the room feeling too cramped. In fact, it made the whole room feel quite cosy, and the brightly coloured summer quilt draped over the bed only added to the feeling.
his neck made.
“There’s a mounting block just out there, call me if you need any help. As for the ride itself, if you follow any of the trails you should eventually make it back here. It’s basically a long, meandering circle,” she directed with a thumb over her shoulder. Draco gently tugged the reins and led Ember out of the barn, and over to the wooden steps. He could hear Harry a short ways behind him along with the heavy sound of hooves on the concrete flooring.
This did not alleviate Al's worry.
“You’re here.”  Harry greets flippantly.
“Whatever for?”  He asks, watching the woman fidget with her sleeve.  Eyes shifting between him and her son laying beside her on the couch.
A small box is summoned by Malfoy which he opens to show Harry the medicinal tinctures inside.  “Each contains at least seven doses worth if used correctly.
such a fool.  Age has not improved him at all.  Imagine, believing he can break in here with brute force?  I do not have the faintest clue how you put up with him.”
“You and the children would call them ‘dippins’.”  Draco drawls in reply, as he peruses the menu.  Eyebrow raised, but expression amused.
The last time he saw Luna, they spoke about his insomnia.  She told him to try and clear his mind when he wanted to sleep and focus on his breathing to keep the night trodgers at bay.  He doesn’t know about night trodgers, but he thinks it helps.
Harry is a warm presence throughout the evening.  Never too far from sight.  Smoothing over any awkwardness and bringing their guests together.  Mother even appears grudgingly impressed with his boyfriend despite her distaste for a good half of their guests.  Still, she gamely plays hostess when needed as the evening progresses.  If she resents it, she hides it well.  He suspects it helps that Aunt Andromeda is here.
, needs to keep his hands to himself.”  Harry complains with a frown, crossing his arms, reminding Draco sharply of the boys.
He could have lost so much today.
“Oh.”  Draco responds, feeling off guard.  “They do?”
“I’m sure she didn’t mean it like that,” Percy interjects, defending his wife.  “Audrey’s worked with some very dire cases.  Any help was welcome, I imagine.”  He concludes nodding toward his wife.
“Yeah.”  Harry affirms.  “The lease on his flat runs out at the end of the year, so. . .”  He trails off at the end.  Observing Ron’s reaction.  His friend’s mouth crooks, shoulders hunching incrementally.  But Ron does not seem angry or even annoyed.  If anything, he seems sorry.
“Nothing.”  Draco answers immediately, sounding lost.  Desperate grey eyes churning something excruciating in Harry’s chest.  “That name means nothing to me.”
Pleasure explodes out of him, ricocheting up his spine Harry arches forward as he comes against Draco’s stomach.  Moaning as his body shakes from the shock of his release.  Draco thrusting himself into the grip he left around them.  He feels oversensitive as his boyfriend jerks hard in his hand and comes too.  The man emits a grunt and there is a dull thud as the back of Draco’s head hits the mirror.
“I’m very used to being alone.”  Draco adds after a period of quiet.  “I was alone most of the time in Azkaban – which was preferable, believe me – but it is nice to have a friend.  Even if it's you, Potter.  It’s been a while.”
“Draco included?”
They spend their last night in Brussels walking along the boulevard.  The last couple days spent wandering around and enjoying each other’s company.  Half fulfilling Harry’s declaration to his friends earlier that they would not leave their hotel suite.
Draco works his way up Harry’s leg.  Pressing soothing circles methodically into the knots of muscle he has around the scars on his knee and thigh.  Harry finds himself sinking deeper into the mattress, breathing deeply.  There is a low level of arousal that is keeping him awake as Draco gets closer to his groin.  Otherwise he could probably fall asleep like he is.
This chapter's story existed so early on before I wrote all these others.  I just think it's cute.  I don't know why the name Maud except that's the name that first came to me and I could picture Al being very sure of it.
He pauses mid-step.
“Severus would have understood.”  McGonagall returns crisply, “But yes, he would have hated it.”
Ginny sighs, expression contemplative.  “Do Ron and Hermione know?”
They nod earnestly in agreement.  Jamie doesn’t even cross his fingers.  He doesn’t want Olta cross at him.  The flat is boring otherwise.  Draco doesn’t have a telly or wi-fi like Dad has set up at Grimmauld.  Dad lets them bring toys to entertain themselves and some toys start to live there in the big chest that Draco keeps in the open part of the sitting room.  It’s just for them.  He and Al checked.  They find surprise toys in there a few times and some boring books that Al takes.
“I’m hardly the one who needs –
“About you being an animagi?”  He remarks allowing himself to settle back among their pillows.  If he kept himself relaxed perhaps that would help Draco too.  “No.  The opposite.  But, if it’s the registry you’re worried about, I’ll talk to Kingsley and we can figure out what to do.”
Harry grins, raising an eyebrow at Draco's directness.  He finds it incredibly hot that his boyfriend was able to voice what he wants.  “Okay.”  Harry answers simply.  Guiding the man back to his earlier position.  Draco opens immediately taking him in with vigor.  Eyes shutting.  Harry returns to thrusting into him, Draco’s tongue moving to taste him as he goes.  He has Harry panting.
It is too quick.  They’ve been apart more often than not in the last several days.  When they are together work on the manor, their jobs, or his children have kept them occupied.  Always something.
“He wasn’t exactly a hero in the war.  In fact, he regrets a lot of he did and didn’t do then.  He has this nagging idea he shouldn’t be with me because of it.”  He shares.
James is naturally disinterested and dismissive, but he does answer.  “Fine.”
“I guess.”
“You’re always nice, Pans.”  Draco says fondly with just a touch of sarcasm.
how seasons work.”
“Draco.”  He begins slowly, considering how he wants to ask this.  He was still uncertain what he thought about the whole thing.  Torn really.
Kreacher makes a simple breakfast of oatmeal with fruit cups.  The children eat the oatmeal, ignoring the fruit completely.  They also ignore his prompts to at least try some.  He counts it as a win when the children each choose one fruit to eat.
“I’d win anyways.”  Harry teases, ducking when Draco lightly cuffs him.  “Just breathe, Draco.  You’re doing fine.”
babied her.
busy.  We were both already stressed and then we lost our tempers with each other.  Everything is off and I just – I just miss him is all.”
Lucius was probably going to spend the rest of his life in Azkaban.  The witness testimony alone was damning enough, but there was physical evidence of his crimes now too.  That had not existed at the end of the previous war.
“I did.”  Ron accedes, shaking his head again slightly.  Probably at himself.  “I – Hermione suggested we try dinner again.  Your lot and mine.  At our house?”
“I shouldn’t a left.  Shouldn’t of takin the shortcut.”
Uncle Ron moves from his relaxed position to focus more on Jamie, leaning forward.  “Are you sure they were talking about
His lab partner hums in acknowledgement but does not respond.  Draco lets it go.
“My apologies.”  Draco replies hastily.  He
Draco laughs lightly at that.  Pansy looks questioningly at him.  “We were.”  Draco answers honestly.  “In an astounding turn of events, we were.”
He tries to let Malfoy have a lie in that first morning, he really does, but eventually he gets bored putting around the house and it
Lily nods her head, fat tears rolling down her cheeks.
The man covers his face with a hand as if embarrassed.  Giving Harry some pause.  Maybe it was better not to pry.  There were so many topics they'd yet to cover in depth.
Draco squints, getting clumsily to his feet.  Headache somehow heavier around his temples.  He tries to recall.  Everything is fuzzy and there is a bad taste in his mouth.  Metallic.  The walls are moving oddly and a bright white, obscuring further inspection.
“He has his charms.”  Draco replies absently, brow furrowed in thought.  Harry will tear the manor down if he thinks it will help or save him.  But like him, Harry will need an opening to get past the wards the manor has on itself.  His limbs are numb now, he focuses on taking a deep breath through his nose.  Willing himself to calm.  He must think.
Hello and thanks for reading.  I've been working non-stop lately so these have been slower coming out.  I'm hopeful to post another before the end of the month.  As always, I own nothing but plots.
Harry loves the intimacy and casualness of it.  Learning more about this man in his unguarded moments.  He has a few pairs of work clothes at the flat now since he's been sleeping over.  Draco’s house elf, Olta, has been kind enough to launder them.  Storing them in the closet space and drawer Draco cleared for him.  A similar one was created recently at Grimmauld for Draco.
“Just let me finish this real quick.”  Harry says hastily, finishing his food in record time and putting the tray on the floor, before turning back on his side to face Draco.  Propping his head up with his hand.  Dark hair a tousled mess.
Four years ago, while still an assistant deputy auror, he was levitated into St. Mungo’s emergency ward with his right leg feeling like it was on fire.  His pant leg smoking, and the stasis charm trying to contain the curse was failing every other minute with dark purple sparks flaring up spectacularly when it did.  Barely restraining his panic at the near certainty he was going to lose his leg.
Harry stands and goes to pour himself more wine.
“Harry.”  He cries out, trying to signal him.  Scratching a little too vigorously at his boyfriend’s scalp.  What is the etiquette for warning your boyfriend you are about to come in their mouth?  It is not an idea he gets to pursue much longer.  Potter’s hand is suddenly pushing Draco’s leg up and over his shoulder, snaking the other hand into the back of his pants.  Fingers lubed and circling his hole.  Pressing in around the rim.  A jolt goes through his body.  Draco grips Potter’s hair roughly and the fool just swallows him down.
Both Potters stare at him.  James enraged and Harry obviously concerned.  Green eyes flicking over him and lips drawing into a tight line.
He puts Lily to bed.  Changing her quickly into her pajamas and taking her to use the toilet, before covering her with her special blanket and charming her nightlight to faintly glow.  He dips his head into the next room to see Al already muttering incoherently to himself and quite asleep.  His younger son slept like his Uncle Ron.  Harry hangs back in the hallway then, watching from a distance as Ginny says goodnight to Jamie.
“What?!”  The man’s expression falls at that admission.  “Really?”
“Where did you learn that?”  Arthur asks Draco.
“What are you going to do with it?”
“Maybe.”  He allows.  It was possible.
“No.”  He dissuades softly, patting the crown of the boy’s head.  “They were frightened.  We all were.  We are awfully glad you are safe back in your mother’s home now.”
“They have you too.”
“I don’t know, ‘Mione.”  Ron grouses, crossing his arms and glaring at Harry.  “Seems to me everyone here ought to know what Harry’s been up to.”
“How many individuals in the auror department are aware of your romantic attachment to Mr. Malfoy?”
“The manor is inhospitable.  No one can live there, Mother.  The ministry has it sealed and for good reason.”  He said.
“I think so too, Lily,” Teddy tries to reassure.  “But good people can make mistakes.”
No.  He cannot be that.  He is not allowed.  They might be hurt.  The boys were already mocked at school because of him.
It feels like everything is coming together.  That this is a natural result of the life he and Harry are building together.  They have never hosted anything like this.  He ought not to be so surprised how well their groups mix.  After all, they have had smaller gatherings of their friends before at Grimmauld.  Astoria is quick to engage everyone which is a relief too.
“She isn’t dancing on the counters yet.”  Draco remarks.  “That’s the limit for serving her last I checked.”
They have had arguments before but never like that one.  It reminds him of the gnawing sensation he’d carry around after a big blowout with Gin.  Like a rag wrung tight and hung out to dry.
Astoria snaps a commanding hand in the air and a tray of bottles float over to them.  Re-filling drinks at the table, including the empty glasses in his and Draco’s hands.  Harry is impressed.  He has never seen that charm before.
How could Malfoy do it?  Accept everything?  Harry hoped the fool would have leaned more heavily on his part on their side during the battle or even what happened at the manor.  Try to save himself a little bit.  Sure, Malfoy turned tail for their side only at the end, but he fought for Hogwarts – for Riddle’s defeat.  Instead Draco Malfoy fell on his sword.
we won’t have magical children?”
But as a rule, no.  I don’t enjoy them much.  I promise you I would find them tiresome if they were left in my care for too long.”
“Are you just gonna chuck her in, then?”  Harry asks, tone hopeful.  Draco appreciates the enthusiasm.
Hermione and Pansy discuss their concerns about Al, Rosie, and Gabby’s year.  It never occurred to him to be concerned that Al was not getting a long enough free period.  Of all his children, Al was the one who
“It doesn’t show.”  Malfoy cracks dryly, making Harry laugh more.
Ron’s mouth is agape.
“Daddy!  Papa!”  Lily shouts exuberantly rushing over to the men before anyone else can say anything.  “Jamie and Al got a cruppy!”  She declares doing an excited little hop in front of them.
“Really?”  Al comments, immediately distracted.  “What’s it called?”  His brother asks as Jamie’s forehead hits the table in front of him with a thud.  Lily giggles.
Harry cringes.  He thought he got rid of all those, but he'd been in a hurry by that point.  Damn Ron.
are the ones you need to win over.”
Dad scoffs loudly with a disdainful “Come off it!” and Aunt Hermione murmurs lowly in a frustrated tone.
“There are several activities you can do at home to support him.  Reading together and working with him to spell things out in a variety of ways are often the most helpful.  My staff will provide you with a packet when you check out.”
“Harry Potter is here - in Brussels.”
“It's in the country.”  Harry replies, observing Jamie very obviously scope out the room.  “And no one lives here.”
“I doubt that very much.”  Harry disagrees, restraining himself from guffawing.  The fact Draco didn’t bring whatever this was to his attention sooner spoke more to his boyfriend being embarrassed or ashamed about it than outright hiding something nefarious.  He shivers feeling cold.  “Look, Draco, I’m cold and I’d like to have part of the blanket again if you don’t mind.”
Draco elects not to stay for the soaking after the boys clamber in.  Water briefly going over the lip of the tub making a puddle.  James and Al snacking on bits of fruit.  Harry applying a liberal amount to his own arms as he sits on the counter.  All of this is beginning to feel like a ludicrous fever dream to him.  Instead he goes and lays down in an attempt to clear his head.
“I do apologize.”  He starts, turning back to his companion, and pulling short at the headmistress chuckling.  A soft, friendly sound.  Professor Minerva McGonagall is honest to Merlin laughing at him as she attempts to conceal it with a hand.
The expression on Draco’s face is much less indulgent now.  He is glaring at his friend. "J’avais dit ça à Astoria en privé! ”
“Nuh-uh!”  Lily argues back with a glare, before turning toward him where he sits a few chairs down.  Face expectant. “Tell them, Papa.”
“I cannot be guilted into this, Mother.”  Draco says, holding his hand up.  “Please know, if anyone could coax me into seeing father again so soon, it would be you.  Fortunately, I have already done enough this year to inspire your approval – the manor comes to mind.”
Harry catches him in a fiery kiss again and they both moan into it as his boyfriend begins to finger him.  Lubed hand opening Draco slowly.  Draco is used to that sensation.  Revels in its intimacy.  Harry has brought him off like this more times than he can count.  Sending delicious sensations throughout his body as they snog.  They go like that for a long time until Harry adds a third finger making him feel fuller than ever before as he takes a shuddering breath.
“I like that idea.”  Harry agrees.  Giving Draco a sure expression.  Astoria is important to Draco.  Probably the second most important woman in his life after his mother.  She was the only one outside of them that was aware of their relationship.  He feels increasing guilt every time he considers that even Ron and Hermione don't know yet.   He doesn't want to keep their relationship quiet from his friends much longer.  He needs to tell them soon.
“No, you’re good.”  Draco reassures feeling bold.  “I just wanted to touch your face.”
“What was it like for you here, you know . . . then,” Harry broaches.  “During the last year of the war?”
“Yeah?”  Harry remarks, moving apart before bringing them back together.  Standing in the middle of his ex-wife’s sitting room, holding Draco close anyway.  His expression much lighter than it was a moment ago.  "I love you too."
Burton Hollingsworth.”
“I’m not asking you to!” Potter called after him, jogging to keep up. “That’s not what I’m saying at all. Look,” Potter said, glancing up and down the hall before grabbing a fistful of Draco’s robes and dragging him through the nearest door. Draco’s breath caught before he could stop himself. He was standing in a closet. A very dark and tiny closet. With Harry Potter. Merlin, had Hogwarts broom closets always been this small? “I
a way. A compassionate, tender way. And Potter’s cheeks went a little pink, and his hand pressed a little more tightly against Draco’s chest, and his lips opened a little, and Draco suddenly feared that Potter had understood everything Draco had just said.
“It’s missing, I’m afraid. Plus, it reacted similarly to a love potion. Unfortunately I think it’s one of our least likely candidates.” Draco sat back in his chair and sighed, closing his research journal.
Maybe Harry was just confused. Draco certainly was. He was still trying to wrap his head around how Harry made him
about the war before, not quite like this. It offered a sort of relief, like the war was a distant tale in a storybook. Like the war couldn't hurt them anymore. He felt a fraction of its weight lifting off of his chest. “If you speak a word of this to your father--”
“Oh?” Granger took a sip of tea and reached for a biscuit.
“For the record, pup, if I really wanted to kill your dad I would have done it already. Tell me about the hooded thing.”
Draco jumped rudely awake, shouting in a panic and reaching for his wand as something (Werewolves? Death Eaters? Hippogriffs?) attacked him. Er. Tackled him. Er. Fell on him. From the ceiling of his bedcurtains. The heavy body on top of him groaned. Draco blinked, his tired mind still waking up after he had already reflexively cast an Incarcerous on the unfortunate git who just--

Draco collapsed onto the tile, incapable of moving. “Holy shit,” he breathed at the ceiling, his arms sprawled out beside him.
It wasn’t exactly a feeling anyone was expected to feel toward one's enemies, or even ex-enemies. It felt more like...well...no. Draco still refused to believe he
?” Potter yelled and stepped forward, tense again, and then forced himself back against the wall, loosening his fists. “I know we tend to bring out the worst in each other, but I just meant…” he sighed, but he didn’t finish. Instead, he began pacing along an invisible line in the middle of the pit. There was silence again, as the rain pattered against them and the tree canopies overhead. “You know. With so many people in my life dead, and Ron and Hermione frequently busy or away, I’ve realized,” Potter sniffed and glanced at Draco. Then at the sky. Then he stared at the dirt wall. His voice was tight. “This is going to sound like the stupidest thing you’ve ever heard.” Potter held his breath and looked at the sky again, blinking as raindrops caught on his eyelashes. “I think you might be the next closest thing I have to a friend.” Potter released a sad, choked laugh. “Can you imagine?” He shook his head and jammed his hands into his pockets, turning to face the far wall. “You. A friend. In what universe?” He turned around and slid his back against the dirt wall until he was sitting in the mud. “But besides a handful of people I rarely get to see anymore, you’re all I have left. You're the last person who won’t blow smoke up my arse. The last person who sees
? It’s a miracle you ever reproduced,” Draco said, lowering his voice. “Now go over there,” he pointed toward the bartender, who was cleaning a glass, “and order the damned shots. I concede to your original victory.”
When Draco appeared at the front gates, he hadn’t expected much. He had expected a crumbling mansion, filled with traces of dark magic and evil energy. As he walked through the gates and toward the main doors, however, he found that it looked pristine in the evening light. Draco had expected a ruin, but the Manor was as beautiful as the day he was born.

. He was able to find a grey and a charcoal, but that wasn’t enough. If Draco was going to reenter society, he wanted to stand out. He wanted to be noticed. He wanted something...unexpected. For Malfoys, black was not only expected, but it would be too reminiscent of the Death Eaters that everyone would be trying to

Draco stiffened at first, instinctively feeling a blend of protectiveness, fear, and shame.
“Merlin, no!” Pansy exclaimed, scrunching her adorable nose. Then she quickly added, “No offense, Greg.” She looked back toward Draco. “I’m happily single, thank you, and this one is fresh out of prison,” she said, patting Greg’s arm affectionately. “I’m trying to help him circulate. But ooh, look at you. I nearly forgot how well society suits you. And that outfit is just…” Pansy hummed. “Are you
The way Potter smiled flirtatiously at him from across the meeting room. The way Harry sat on the end of his bed in the morning, trying not to laugh as Draco made jokes at Weasley’s expense. The way Potter played Quidditch with Draco and his children, that look of pure joy. The way their elbows touched at the pub. That warm, golden light between them and the delightful, tingling taste of Harry against his mouth. His heart suddenly felt fuller than it had ever felt in his life, and he
Draco nodded slowly. This meant no, didn’t it? He’d have to do his scientific research properly and responsibly like a bloody Muggle. He’d have to order the stupid rats, which meant he’d have to wait at least a month for them to arrive, and then he had to sort them and prepare a plan for quantitative data, set up a control group, test each potion one by one, and--
Granger’s eyebrows pulled together, and she looked down at her notes. “As I was saying--” she droned on.
“Your father. Actually.”
Draco sat in the hotel lobby and admired his surroundings while Granger talked to the hotel receptionist. Everywhere he looked, there were gilded mirrors and candelabras and fancy chandeliers and sofas with clawed feet. At one time in his life, this style of living was to be expected. It was normal. Anything less had been deplorable. Now he took in the sights, enjoying the colours and architecture as the treasures they were. When the Hogwarts crowd started moving again, Draco was on his feet. Some lingering faculty members drifted away with keys in their hands, but Draco wasn’t in any hurry to get his. He was enjoying the scenery. He was enjoying his last few moments in good company.
“Yes, Potter, this is what I meant about the doors.”
“What do we do?” Harry asked frantically, trying to pull himself upright. Instead, he collapsed forward onto his belly, holding his weight with his elbows as he looked fearfully toward the ceiling.
Malfoy had been sitting three seats to the left of Headmistress Granger at dinner, and it was clear that Potter was intending to walk straight toward her. But then, as he had approached the table, Potter’s eyes happened to glance his way. And stopped. Everything had stopped. Potter had stopped moving. The whole fucking room had stopped moving. Draco had even stopped breathing. Because their eyes had locked. Potter was staring directly at him, and Draco was staring directly back.
when he had said,
like that should be it. Still not trusting his legs yet, he summoned his research journal and quill and began to report what had happened so far. The Fountain of Vermouth had clearly been a result of Potion 3, which explained its alcohol characteristic. Potion 1 was still a giant question mark.

him with his eyes. Draco supposed that Potter hadn’t seen him out of his robes--with the exception of the recent bedroom incident--in ages. Draco was wearing neatly trimmed charcoal trousers and a long-sleeved silver shirt with an emerald waistcoat. Draco smiled, thinking about Potter’s coy little smile Saturday morning and his “

Well, leave it to the Potters to ruin his perfectly good misery.
Potter pressed a foot into his palms and, trying to sustain balance and Potter’s weight, Draco grunted as he pushed himself to his feet. Potter went soaring upward until his fingers dug into the wall only two feet below the edge, but then they lost balance and both were toppling backward into the dirt.
When Draco had lined his shelves with sleeping draughts, he tried to find the Room of Requirement. Just to see if he could.

“He was perfectly prepared, and I am sorry for overreacting.”
” Draco wanted to move his eyes in her direction, wanted to see her reaction, wanted to see what she was seeing. He had never heard her swear before, Muggle or Magical, so something must be very wrong. He heard her rush to his desk and fumble through the drawers. “Do you have any antidote potions?” she asked a little frantically.
Draco wasn’t entirely sure why they were doing shots, but he gulped back the firewhiskey anyway, and it warmed him from the inside.
“Well," Harry scratched the back of his head, "I’m sure the bed is big enough for both of us.”
Draco felt a little unsteady as he kicked off of the ground and into the air. He wavered on his broom at first as he slowly flew toward the Quidditch pitch. And then it was easy, as natural as breathing. Draco leaned forward, his broom darting up toward Lily and James.
“James!” Draco stopped, grabbing James by the arm.
“Time’s up!” Lily said, walking across the room.
“Just pick something. You’ll be fine.”
Granger sighed. “Very well. I’ll miss our talks over tea.”
Draco sat down next to him, hooking his elbows around his knees. “What are you reading?”
The absolute last thing Draco had ever expected was for Potter's children to invent creative ways to get Harry and Draco in the same space. If Draco didn't know any better, he'd think they were actively

Draco wandered through the old hallways, not even sure where he was going until he rounded a corner and found himself facing Headmaster Dumbledore.

And, in a final lesson, this man had taught him that he wasn’t capable of killing. Dumbledore had taught Draco that there was always

“He…” Potter was scratching his head again in the dark. “He’s always been fascinated by stories of the war, and he has this thing about Death Eaters, and… when he was old enough to start pursuing the stories on his own, he started reading old newspapers, and between that and, well just
“Sorry about your breakfast, mate,” Weasley said, looking at the spilled pastry and pumpkin juice. “Want me to fetch you something else?”
Draco supposed it was a good thing he wasn’t anyone anymore.
“No! ...Um. I mean, that is... that depends if you…" Draco sighed. Was he now destined to stammer incomprehensively like Potter for the rest of his days? "I--I can't remember how to say this. Something about liking you so much I can’t think straight and…”

A crash came from the other side of the bed curtains. “Merlin’s beard!” a young voice cried.
“Straws,” Potter squeaked as if his life depended on it. “This is unbelievably stupid, Ron, and your game is stupid, and I can’t believe I’m saying this, but please draw the bloody straws. Or play Rock, Paper, Scissors, or whatever it is you want to do. I’m going to the loo. If you find me in bloody bits it’s because I tried to disapparate while intoxicated. Fucking hell.” Potter stormed off.
“Also gorgeous. Elegant.”
Longbottom wouldn't be satisfied with casting a bloody Incarcerous like a normal wizard. Draco could feel himself condescendingly rolling his eyes as he struggled against the plant. When the vines began constricting around him, he could feel his breath being squeezed from his lungs. "Your side," Draco coughed as the vine tightened painfully around his ribs. "I'm on your side."
“She’s...er…lovely?” Draco said, actively trying to not sound as predatorily jealous as he suddenly felt. “You should...Apparate, or whatever it is that you do,” he said, trying to sound supportive even though the thought of it soured his stomach.
Draco walked past him, purposely bashing against Potter’s shoulder with his own as he continued down the hallway. Potter just wheeled around and walked beside him. “Don’t you have anything better to do than follow me around?” Draco asked.
It was a strange sensation. He felt himself start to stumble and lose his balance before a hand, warm and secure, wrapped around his upper arm to stabilize him. Draco froze, unable to breathe, almost afraid to look over his shoulder--afraid that this hand belonged to someone other than the man he wanted. But then, even through his robes, Draco felt that subtle sliding thumb and was even more afraid to

.” Potter was still wearing his hideous pyjamas.
Draco tiredly leaned up on his elbows to see Harry standing in the corner of the small kitchen, holding a mug of tea.
Draco ignored him. "I would be tarred, feathered, and levitated arse-over-kettle through the square. No.” Draco pulled a pillow off the bed. “You take the bed. I'll take the floor.”
“Malfoy?”
“I’m relieved to hear that,” Granger sipped her tea. “Things have been so difficult for Harry with Ginny gone, you know? He’s been doing so much better recently, and I just...”
He found Granger sitting at a small tea table covered with white lace in the far back corner of her office. “Professor Malfoy,” she said as he walked in. “How do you like your tea?”
in place. The rims of Harry's eyeglasses had changed to a thin, tasteful gold. He wore white gloves over his hands. His black shoes shimmered in the light from the starry ceiling and candles floating throughout the room.
"Ron--" Longbottom chided.
"Sod off," Draco repeated, completely breathless.
“I was wrong,” Draco murmured.
And then Draco did relax. He didn’t even try to pull away as Harry unfastened the buckles of his leather cuff. For some reason, having
That wasn’t Potter’s wand.
For some incredibly irritating reason, this made Potter laugh harder. But at least he was standing up. At least he was moving out of Draco’s so-called bed. No. No.
“Here.” Draco opened his eyes. Potter was holding out his research journal in one hand and the dropper in the other. Draco balanced the journal on his knee, hastily scribbled the date and
Draco stared past Potter and up into the door in the ceiling of his bedcurtains. Right into Potter’s disastrous bedroom.
Apparently a trace of dark magic had been discovered on one of the portkeys, and everything was stalled until the Department of Magical Transportation could investigate. On such a significant day, no one wanted to take any risks.
It suddenly occurred to Draco that Harry had been hiding behind the wards of Hogwarts for so long--intentionally, with the rare exception of Auror work--in his attempt to recover from the tragedy of his wife’s death that this may very well have been his first public outing since he stepped down from his position as Head Auror. Harry had been out of the spotlight for a long time. To be fair, he'd never been particularly good about being

, naive and misplaced though it may have been. It had been a long, long time since he had felt anything close to it.
The palace was quiet as Draco made his way toward the throne room. Dimly lit candelabras flickered against the walls, barely illuminating giant paintings. Once he arrived at the entrance, he saw two more Death Eaters inside, taking turns sitting on the throne rather than working on the wards. Merlin, they couldn’t even do their

Eventually, everyone else left the table except for Harry, Draco, Granger, Weasley, and the children. They had repositioned themselves so that they were all sitting a little closer to each other, and Weasley was telling some ridiculous story about something that had happened during a Quidditch game that year, but Draco wasn't really paying attention.  With a good meal, a good bourbon, and the Ministers’ compliments in his ears, Draco settled back and watched Lily lead her brothers and cousins in a game of Exploding Snap. With Harry at one side, his new friends on the other, and the children laughing across the table, Draco felt like he was part of something. Something important. It wasn’t important in the same sense that being a prefect or winning a Quidditch match or winning a seat in the Ministry was important. It was better. It was important, because for the first time in a long time, he felt
James was running toward the door and Draco was tempted to Obliviate him; he had never intended for this to happen. He never should have dabbled in the first place. He should have known that his stupid emotions would somehow get in the way; it was why he tried to avoid them in the first place.

Harry was protective of his children, Draco knew. He was a good father. Harry was afraid to lose more people he loved, he’d made that much very clear, and that fear extended to his children most of all. Draco hadn't

He would play nice for as long as he needed to, until he was able to learn what he needed to learn, and then be free of the wretched place.
“I have to ask,” Potter said softly, allowing the door to swing nearly-closed behind him but not letting it latch. “Does the thought of me half-naked in your bedroom make you ill too?”

“Well, don’t fall off the face of the earth this time, mm? We’ll have lunch.”
be over for me! What the bloody hell do you think I’ve been doing all this time?”
Draco moved toward his father’s room. When he opened the master bedroom door, he was overwhelmed by a familiar scent that filled him with nostalgia. The air still contained traces of the scented potions his father once wore. He hadn’t expected that. He hadn’t expected anything of his father to be left in the room--to still be

“Yes. Follow me.” He was about to march back out of the room, but then stopped. He could almost hear Granger screaming at him. House elf revolutions and all. He was so used to commanding house elves about, that he hadn’t really thought about the implications of slavery. The last house elves he had actually interacted with had been back at Malfoy Manor. “Er… if you wish to do so. I need assistance.”
Pansy Parkinson laughed warmly against his shoulder. “Where have you
Lily simply hopped onto a stool across the table from him, pressed her elbows on the table and placed her chin in her hands. “What are you making?”
.” Draco reached for his shirt, which was still tucked into his trousers behind him, but Potter pressed him down and wouldn’t let him move. Potter was ruining it. They had been having a perfectly decent moment, and Potter went and ruined it.

Draco thought of his mother sitting in the sunlight in her little garden in France, how proud and happy she always looked when Draco arrived for tea. “Expecto patronum,” he said a little more clearly. Barely a mist. He was past the pitch now. He was running out of time.
“James!” Albus and Lily had entered the healing ward, and both ran to sit at the foot of James’ bed.
“Out!” The door timidly closed.
“James, I need
The way Potter had walked into the Great Hall, boots trailing mud on the floor. The way his robes were open and hanging in tatters around him. The way his sweaty black t-shirt had clung tightly to his torso. The way his pale jeans had been tattered enough to reveal a glimpse of thigh. The way his robes had swayed with him as he walked and how, as if suddenly thinking of decorum as he entered, he made an attempt to smooth out his wild hair, straighten his crooked spectacles, and button his robes. The way his thin beard and dark hair, still haphazardly attached to his head, had made Potter look positively haggard. It was clear that Potter hadn’t shaved in at least a week. Draco wouldn’t be surprised if he hadn’t showered for that long either. Potter hadn’t even made an attempt to wash his face, which looked like it had gotten into a fight with a fireplace and lost.
for fuck’s sake. After fifteen years he still wasn’t sure he was ready to face her. He didn’t even know how to begin making amends, or if there were any amends he could even make. Perhaps she had hired him simply so that she could make his life as much of a living hell as he had once made hers.
that?--and taking a seat next to Weasley before reaching for a whole turkey leg. Draco intentionally avoided Potter for the rest of dinner, which was easy because they were sitting on the same side of the table with four people between them. But he could still hear Weasley give some sort of exclamation every now and then, and Potter’s resulting laughter. He could see Potter’s hand reach for a glass of mead every now and then. He gathered pieces of Potter’s tale--something about an old Auror case he had been called in for and a Dark Lord worshipper.
to Draco’s left. Potter’s wand had washed into the pit. Draco leaned toward his left to pick it up, and felt a familiar, almost-forgotten sensation spreading through his hand. He was hit with a wave of nostalgia. The fact of the matter was: it wasn’t Potter’s wand at all. He ran his fingers along the familiar curves of smooth hawthorn. “Is this

him for their own? He settled into his seat next to Potter, hardly sure what to do with himself.
“I won’t tell him,” James said. Draco felt relief wash through him as they both stared down at Potter walking below them. “The thing is, though... The way he looked at you during that fire, before he flies down to save you? I’ve seen that look on his face before.” James swallowed. “It’s the look he always gets when someone he loves is in trouble.”
Neville Longbottom was quickly approaching Draco with his wand extended, and Draco exhaled his relief. It wasn't Death Eaters. He wasn't caught yet. "Longbottom! Have you seen--"
“...I’m gay.”
"Maybe," Harry conceded, his arms tightening a little around Draco. "But I'm still glad you were so obsessed with finding it. It led you back to me."
, and he wanted to get back to Harry.
Draco closed the door to the Slytherin toilets. Opened it again. And walked right back into his bedroom. Whatever this was, it seemed to be distinctly tied to his room. And at this rate, the vermouth was making him so drowsy that he was getting too tired to care about late-night students walking into his room. He cast protective wards over all of his belongings, cast cushioning charms on all of his walls so that no students would injure themselves by falling into his room from odd angles, set up several ladders throughout the room in case any students needed to get back into the ceiling, and crawled into his bed. He threw his robe and black leather gauntlet toward a chair, let his hair down, flicked his bedcurtains closed with his wand, crawled under his covers, and shimmied out of his clothes. He made small snow angels in his sheets. Silk, silk, silk on his bare skin. This felt right. Now he could finally sleep.
There was a swishing of silk, and he felt Harry sitting up behind him. “Morning.” Harry pressed his bare chest to Draco’s back and wrapped a lazy arm around Draco’s middle while pressing the lower half of his face against Draco’s shoulder blade. Draco relished the warm golden heat that thrummed through him at Harry's touch. "How's it going?"
“Where?” Potter asked James. “Show me.”
Harry, but he certainly
Draco could tell, because it was positioned directly on top of
“Never,” Potter repeated, his voice even softer as his hand tightened around Draco’s wrist, sending something warm and unpleasant tingling up his spine.
Draco sighed and looked toward Potter and Weasley, who were walking by him in the hall, likely returning from dinner.
Harry was soon so surrounded by his clinging children that he could hardly move. "I'm fine," Harry laughed encouragingly, wrapping his arms around them. "Everything's fine."
and he had played as a boy
Nonetheless, Draco still found himself standing on the battlements in the snow in the evenings, watching Potter patrol the grounds. Draco wasn’t about to let another dementor incident happen again. It didn’t matter that Potter wasn’t speaking to him; he still dreaded the thought of Harry being unable to defend himself. For as long as he was still at Hogwarts, he may as well make himself useful.
“I know. That’s why I’m here.”
Potter flushed and Draco stared into his glass, but they didn’t move their elbows. Potter had tried going home with a

at his pale forearm and dark gauntlet against the green silk as that tingling heat slowly, slowly faded away. He stayed like that until he lost track of time.
There was a timid knock on his door, and Draco went to open it. Potter was standing sheepishly in the hall, looking as if he might flee at any moment.
Ten minutes later, he still didn’t feel much of anything except a happy sort of warmth. He felt quite comfortable. How nice it was, to feel so comfortable in Healer Victoria’s presence. So comfortable, in fact, that he wanted to share his comfort with her. The best way, obviously, was to tell Healer Victoria exactly how he felt about her, so she could feel this calm and comfortable too. “Victoria,” Draco grinned.
