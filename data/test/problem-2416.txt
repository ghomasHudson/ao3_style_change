Guys I'm sick :(  Prey for me to get better soon please cause I feel like I've been hit by 27 busses consecutively
"We turned up for practice and the Slytherin team was there too and apparently they had arranged a joint practice."
"But we both know that's not true. Would you rather I didn't tell Seamus?" Harry asks. He probably should have spoken to Draco before telling the school about his love life.
"How about we get our teams together on Wednesday and have a friendly game of quidditch? Like joint practice." Blaise suggests and Harry thinks for a second. It would be good to see how his team play against other people before an official match. Besides, Blaise is a nice guy and Harry wouldn't mind hanging out with him more.
"You can come to ours for Christmas and New years?" Draco offers, hopeful. Harry grins.
"I will ask Filius to cover, he has no class with him currently."
"You're welcome, Draco." They stand a stare at each other smiling for a few seconds before Harry talks again.
"I'm not sure that's a good idea, Professor." He says, not wanting to let her down but also not wanting to do it.
"You can't miss meals, Harry. That wasn't part of our deal." Harry nods.
"I slept in a cupboard under the stairs until I was 11. My aunt, uncle and cousin made me do everything for them, I never really had much to eat and they only gave me my cousins old clothes to wear, which were like 4 sizes to big, at least. My aunt resented me because I guess she figured I'd be a wizard like my parents and she was jealous of my mum or something. My uncle was verbally abusive and my cousin used to beat the shit out of me. The only reason I was allowed the spare bedroom is because Dumbledore made them treat me better, but they still triple locked the door every night and they put bars on my window. The only reason they stopped abusing me is because they found out my godfather had been to prison for murder and they were scared of him." Harry says and Draco looks over at him in shock.
They chat through tea, Narcissa asking Harry and Draco questions, about school, how they started talking, how their relationship developed. Those questions made Draco blush but they answered them all. She asks Harry how he's been, tells him he's always welcome to come by the manor if he gets lonely at Grimmauld place on his own. Says he's always welcome to come by for a meal, stay the night, stay a few days. Tells Harry he doesn't have to be alone. Harry has tears in his eyes as he thanks her, squeezes Draco's hand under the table to stop them falling, and Narcissa smiles at them both and tells them for the umpteenth time that she's happy for them. After tea Narcissa tells them she has some business she needs to attend to, and once she's left the room Draco turns to Harry.
"I know." Draco frowns at him.
Draco sees Hermione walking alone, probably on her way to or from the library, on Friday midday. It's been 3 weeks since he first comforted Potter and his curiosity is killing him.
"Harry, babe, your book's upside down." She says and Harry chuckles before putting the book down.
Okay so I literally have 1/4 of the next chapter written and I have major writers block and no motivation so I don't know when the next chapter will be posted but I'm hoping I get motivation soon, I'm sorry <3
"He'll be happy to see you." He says quietly and Draco blushes darker.
"And from what I could tell he's actually becoming friendly with Zabini."
"Dumbledore. Said I was protected from Voldemort because of my mum. And I had to stay with my aunt because it kept that protection going. If I stayed with them then Voldemort couldn't find me." Harry says, absentmindedly playing with Draco's fingers of the hand he's holding. "Also, you know, I didn't have anywhere else to go. Rather be miserable in their house than miserable and homeless." Draco nods slightly in understanding.
"You wanna come in?" Harry asks and Draco bites his lip before nodding and wow that was attractive. Harry opens the door and lets them both in before shutting it and walking over to the sofa, sitting on one end whilst Draco sits on the other. Teddy gets down but looks at Harry with wide eyes.
"Mate you know we didn't-"
He wasn't expecting silence.
"Yeah."
"You can open it, Potter. It's yours." She jokes but Harry is basically shaking. He opens it slowly to see around 250 small vials and he knows immediately what they are.
"Mate are you okay?" Ron keeps asking him every so often and Hermione keeps banging on about how "You should be taking notes, Harry, this is important." And Harry knows they mean well but he just can't bring himself to respond. He isn't okay. He knows this. He knows this because if he was okay he wouldn't constantly be thinking about all the people that died and how it should have been him. He wouldn't be regretting the fact that he chose to stay. He wouldn't be wishing that Voldemort would have just killed him in the forest, or in the graveyard, or in front of the mirror, or in his nursery when he was one and a half. He wouldn't constantly hear the screams and cries of people dying around him. He would be able to talk to his friends and sit and relax without feeling the guilt of surviving, or the burden of knowing if he'd just gone to meet Tom Riddle a few hours earlier, when he asked the first time, all of those people who died before they lived would still be alive.
"No." He whispers, but he lets Draco walk him into the hall and over to the Slytherin table. Harry can feel the eyes of nearly everyone in the hall on him as he sits next to Draco, opposite Blaise and Pansy.
"You don't have to do that, you know." He says softly and Harry frowns.
"Yeah but it's not the same as me being here." Billy grins and Harry rolls his eyes.
"What's up?"
"It's great to meet you!" She grins, holding out a hand, and Draco shakes it with a small bemused smile. Harry excuses them, telling Diane they have to go but he will see her later, before they continue to walk.
"Yeah I know, still nervous though mate. I'm always nervous before quidditch." Harry says and it's true, he's had a lot of near death experiences when playing quidditch and although he is amazing at it and wins every game and loves flying, he still gets nervous.
“What do you think-“ she starts before Sirius rushes into the room.
So I'm finally back into the swing of it (Hopefully) which means I can post regularly again!!!
"Thanks Hagrid."
"You and Draco." Blaise says and Harry takes a shaky breath in, shoving his hands in the hoodie pocket.
"Harry do you want me to get Madam Pomfrey?"
"Kreacher you've seen wizard parties before right?"
"To making a boring party fun." Blaise grins, and they chuckle as they clink glasses.
"He likes you. He usually growls and breaths fire when someone other than me or Teddy touches him." Harry says, his voice gentle, and Draco smiles slightly.
"Oh yeah, I'll be fine." Rhys says, and Harry knows he's not going to be able to keep up with him but carries on running anyway. Harry can run for hours on end, his longest run was 5 and a half hours. It was just after the war and he kept running until he was on the verge of passing out because he just needed a distraction. He knows this is probably not normal and definitely not healthy, but there's only an hour until dinner so maybe Rhys can keep up until then.
"Then leave me alone." He whimpers and Hermione looks shocked and hurt and Harry feels bad, he does, but the longer he looks at her the guiltier he feels.
"She was what?" George asks in shock.
"It's up to you. I'll do whatever you decide on, Draco. You're the one that's going to be dragged into the spotlight. I'm used to it, but it's not- it sucks." Draco nods, biting his lip nervously, and Harry smiles softly, brushing his thumb over Draco's lip so he releases it.
"He's got a lot of siblings. I'm sure he's just busy." Draco's frown deepens, but before he can question it any more Harry stops walking. "We can apparate now." He says, squeezing Draco's hand, and Draco needs to think for a second so he can focus on apparating rather than the hand in his and who it belongs to. He would really rather not splinch them.
"Harry!" Ron calls and the three of them stop laughing and look over to see Ron, Seamus, Dean, Hermione, and Neville standing by the entrance to the pitch. Blaise is the first one to stand up, holding a hand out to Harry who takes it, letting Blaise pull him up. He whimpers when Ron walks closer and Draco stands up too, standing next to Harry.
"I'm okay, and I don't mean to pry but Potter even I can tell that you're not okay." He says softly and Harry shrugs.
Harry wakes up the next day lying next to Draco, as usual, however before he even opens his eyes he can tell Draco is watching him.
"So have I darlin." He says before kissing Draco softly.
"I don't know. It happened so fast. I don't even know if he meant to." Harry admits and McGonagall nods.
I'm sorry it's been so long since I updated this but guy's it's happened again. Writers block has taken over and I am stressing out. For some reason I have no motivation to write. I'm hoping it will go soon and I'll be able to bang out a few chapters at least, but I've currently only got half of the next chapter written. It's frustrating as hell cause I know what I want to write I just can't, you know?
"I will. And I get it if you can't talk to us or look at us, but we miss you, Harry. And we went the wrong way about it but we miss you. And I get you're friends with the Slytherins now but can we arrange joint custody or something cause we miss having you around." Harry smiles slightly, wiping his eyes, and Ron smiles.
"Okay." He whispers, pecking Draco again. "Have you done anything like this before? I don't wanna hurt you." He asks. Draco blushes and diverts his gaze from Harrys eyes to his shoulder as he nods.
"Okay, we decided that for today's practice we could play against each other. Now this is a friendly game, not a competition. If there's any foul play I will kick you off the team." He says to his Slytherin team and Harry nods. Ginny, who had been confused why the Slytherins were here, is frowning. When did Harry and Zabini get friendly?
"Me? Potter are you okay?" Harry shakes his head and grips Draco's arm tighter when he feels a wave of dizziness hit him. Draco wraps his arm around Harry to keep him up and sighs.
"Yeah." He says automatically.
"You can come with me and Hermione? Ron's staying here to practice quidditch." Harry says and Draco hesitates before nodding as the announcement tells 8 years to get to their common rooms.
"It's amazing." Draco says before looking down and stroking the dragon, watching as it relaxes against his touch, and where the dragon goes, it takes the dark mark with it, so it will never be visible again. Harry bats Dracos hand away, giggling at his protests, and runs his finger down the dragons back. The dragon stretches it's wings wide and Harry grins as the dragon looks as if it's smiling.
"Yeah, you are. Why won't you let people help you? You're always being the fucking golden boy with a hero complex, the chosen one who saves everyone, but you refuse to let anyone help you. It's fucking infuriating." Draco growls and Harry steps closer to Draco.
"I still can't believe you're reading the same author." Blaise chuckles and Draco looks down at Harry's book before looking back up at Blaise.
"I mean it though. They're not gonna like the fact that I'm with you."
"I love you too, Potter." He says and Harry smirks.
"Firstly, there's no way Blaise would let me not take part in whatever he's about to start, and secondly... I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to be." He starts talking confidently, but his voice is smaller and quieter during the second half of his sentence, and Harry feels his chest warm up slightly because Draco wants to be there.
"Hey, You okay?" He asks as Harry stops in front of him. Harry nods.
"Oh, hey Potter." Blaise says and Harry smiles slightly.
"A few years ago Dumbledore made Snape teach me cause Voldemort kept looking into my head and putting things there or trying to find information and I had to stop him doing that. Also cause then I could look into his mind and find out what he was planning or where he is and stuff." He's never told anyone that before, and McGonagall sighs.
Just a wholesome chapter.
"Hey buddy, I missed you! Did you have fun with Hermione?" Harry asks before turning back to Hermione.
"But you do it. Speaking of which, you should go and eat."
"Won't tell a soul Malfoy. I didn't have you down as a softy." Harry teases and Draco glares at him before unwrapping Teddies arms from him.
Harry pulls his potions homework towards him along with his textbook and starts writing, getting about a quarter of the way through before he realises he needs more information. He stands up and wanders over to the shelves that he knows holds the book he needs, and when he finds it and goes to reach for it his hands bumps someone else's, who is also reaching for the same book. Harry pulls his hand back at the same time as the other person, and when he looks to see who it is he see's Blaise.
"We should hang out. Like all of us. Me, Pansy and Draco and you Granger and Weasley." He says and Harry nods.
"Can we come and see him later?" Draco asks and Madam Pomfrey shakes her head.
"Cause I'm depressed, Ron. I'm depressed and tired and so broken and I don't want to make him deal with me."
"Meet us in the entrance hall at 1? That's probably where Andromeda will pick up Teddy from." Draco agrees and Harry kisses Draco softly before he leaves Harrys room.
"You sure your mum would be okay with that?"
"People are none of your concern, Harry. You need to worry about yourself now. Which is why, should you want to, Poppy and I have arranged a Healer, therapist is his official title I think, from a muggle hospital in London to see you. It can be once a week, once a month, every day, however often you choose, and it can be here or at the hospital, wherever will make you comfortable. Do you think it would help?" McGonagall says. Sirius used to tell Harry he wished he had a sort of therapist for his PTSD. Vernon and Petunia always said that people that need therapists were freaks, but Harry knows it would probably help him, and if Sirius was strong enough to admit he needed one then so was Harry. He nods.
"What...?" Blaise asks and Harry takes a shaky breath in.
Also fun fact I've been super sick again (what else is new) so I went to my GP thinking I have another chest infection and she said I have a virus (just like a common cold) but she thinks I also have asthma which... I mean it makes sense but surely they could have figured that out before the age of 20?? Anyways now I'm starting to doubt if I actually had a chest infection in December so I probably took antibiotics for no reason which sucks. And I have to have respiratory tests at some point to see how shitty my lung function is so thats fun
“Do I still smell the same?” Draco asks, trying to cheer Harry up. Harry nods and leans back to look Draco in the eyes.
"I need to talk to you a sec." Harry sounds nervous and Draco hesitates before sitting next to him.
"Well right now you all need to eat and then we have herbology." Hermione says and the boys roll their eyes before following her out of the common room.
"Yeah. He said we should all hang out at some point." Harry says and Ron shakes his head.
"What I was trying to say-" Blaise continues, "is that Harry is a vast improvement. I'm just excited to see the look on Brandon's face when he sees you two together."
"Maybe you are." Draco says, reaching for the book, and Blaise holds it out to his side so Draco can't reach it. Harry bites his lip to stop himself from laughing as the two of them struggle for a minute. Draco eventually gives up with a sigh.
"So have you Draco, Pansy told me." Hermione adds and Harry chuckles, grabbing Dracos hand.
"Harry stay at the manor tonight." Draco pulls back to look at him, eyes pleading, and Harry can't bare to disappoint or upset him, but he also doesn't- "You won't be intruding." Harry rolls his eyes.
"I know this is a bad time, but I never hated you." Draco says nervously, a light blush spreading across his cheeks, and Harry half smiles lazily.
"So she knew?"
"Do you usually get like this after using it?"
"Draco are you okay?" He asks, making sure not to move his hand. Draco grabs the back of Harry's neck with the hand that isn't holding his and pulls him back towards him.
"Stairs by the notice board." Harry tries to walk without putting too much weight on Draco but he's so tired and dizzy that he can barely keep his eyes open. Draco all but carries Harry up the stairs and follows his directions to his dorm room.
"Why are you impossible to embarrass?" He asks.
"Of course not." They stay awake playing snap and chatting quietly until 2am when they both feel so tired they can't keep their eyes open, and Billy goes back to his own bed.
"That can't have been comfortable." Harry says and Draco shrugs, stretching his back which, admittedly, is aching, but he didn't want to interrupt Harry.
It's 45 minutes after they got to the library, and Draco lets out a small groan, resting his head in his arms. He's just finished his essay, and he has a headache.
"Then just stick with the others. Not too closely though cause Rhys definitely has a thing for you." Blaise says and Harry raises an eyebrow.
"It'll be fine." He says softly, and Harry nods, taking a deep breath.
"Is- Is he okay?" Harry nods.
"I believe you, Potter. I just wanted to check. How was your run?"
"So how was class?" Harry asks.
"Me too. But we're not going to know unless you actually try and sleep." Draco whispers with a small smile on his face and Harry laughs through his nose slightly.
"I'm sure you will think of something, Harry." McGonagall smiles and Harry nods. He figures he might as well try.
"They're not really." Harry says and Draco is quite surprised when the kid just shrugs and goes back to his book. Draco turns to Harry who just smiles slightly and sits on the sofa. When Draco sits next to him Harry turns to him.
What we thinking lads? You like the chapter? You hate it? You want me to end the fic asap cause you're sick of it or you want it to go on forever??
"She's not the only one that can't keep her mouth shut." Harry jokes and Draco rolls his eyes, muttering something about 'fucking Gryffindors.' Harry just smiles at him slightly before realising he still doesn't know why Draco has been distracted.
"Okay, okay, I'm sorry, I'll drop it." Blaise says and Draco sighs, looking back down at the potions essay he can't finish yet. He knows Blaise means well but he really wants to talk Harry and make him feel better and hopefully make him fall in love with him but he's so scared of doing anything wrong or messing up or making Harry hate him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"That's the spirit." Blaise says and Harry notices Draco pointedly not looking at him and wonders if there's something wrong. He just shrugs.
"I'm not gonna talk about it."
"Sorry."
"So, when is Teddy going back?" He asks and Harry sighs.
”Sit in front of me?” She asks and Harry raises an eyebrow but shifts to the side so he’s right in front of her. Pansy runs her hands through his hair, splitting it into a middle parting, before starting to french braid each half. She does half of a french plait before tapping Harry’s arm, who gets the hint and hands her the band on his wrist, and she ties off the plait so it ends in a short pigtail before moving onto the other side. Harry likes having his hair played with, so he just stares ahead as Pansy plaits his hair, and he notices Blaise and Draco, even though they’re still talking, are now watching Pansy. Pansy has noticed them watching too, and she smiles slightly because now Draco is the one who looks entranced. Pansy finishes Harry’s hair and sits back with a satisfied grin.
"You're such a fucking tease." Draco mutters out and Harry grins.
"Harry you two need to just make out and get it over with." She says and Harry blushes as Ron runs over.
"That is perfect." Harry corrects him and Blaise smiles slightly. They both sit quietly, occasionally talking, whilst they write up the process of making the potion as they wait for the other pairs to finish, and after 10 minutes Slughorn starts walking round the class. He gets to Harry and Blaise and smiles when he looks at their potion.
Draco smiled. “Of course.” He mouthed again, not speaking aloud again.
Harry couldn't believe someone would give him anything. He had to force back his tears of joy so that he could actually see what the gift was.
The emptiest compartment was at the end of the train and even then there was one person in it. One person who just happened to be Draco Malfoy.
The werewolf rolled his eyes. The child could act so much like Sirius every once in a while, but those moments were few and far between. “Come on Padfoot! There is a very anxious little birthday boy here that really wants to go to the park!”
The toddler looked at them hopefully. “Would you?”
Draco continued eating as well, but kept sending him worried glances every now and then. They finished eating, and a few minutes afterwards, a person called a Prefect led them out of the Hall.
Harry tensed when an arm brushed against his shoulder, telling him that someone had sat down next to him. He jerked his head around with wide eyes to see who it was and if he was in trouble. He sagged in relief, realizing it was Blaise. “Hey Blaise.” He greeted, giving him a small smile.
Harry smiled, eyes getting slightly glassy from how amazing it was to have a friend. “Thank you Draco. I-” Harry didn't get to finish his sentence before Draco’s head suddenly shot up towards the front and he turned around and gave him an apologetic look.
Harry frowned. “Yeah, why? Is that weird?’
Draco did just that, shooting the professor another glare. They waited for the rest of the class to file out of the classroom, before walking up to Professor Snape's desk, Draco with a question in his eyes and Harry with slight fear in his.
Malfoy was shocked to the point that this time he didn’t even bother schooling his expression and a contemplative expression mixed in with the shocked one. A moment passed, and then he gave him a small smile. “Okay Potter,” he started softly (and maybe even hopefully), “truce.”
He raised his eyebrows. “Not even Granger or Weasley?”
They went to bed after that, because Harry's denial of answering his question had left a slight awkwardness in the conversation and before they knew it, it was morning.
Harry tightly pressed his lips together and grit his teeth. He didn't even know these people and these people didn't know him. So who were they to make assumptions about him based on other people that he didn't even know? “These people don't even know me, how dare they pretend that they do.” He said angrily, though still managing to say it in his usual soft spoken voice.
Harry looked back and forth from the two quickly, his brows furrowed in his sallow face that was far more skinny than it should have been for a boy his age. He was trying his best not to shy away.
I was also wondering, should I make this into a series of separate books or should I combine it all into the one?
With a sigh, Severus set his things to the side once the house elf had disappeared and decided to head to his rooms. He’d had plenty of revelations for one day.
Life seems normal on the night of November 1, 1981 at Number 4 Privet Drive, perfectly normal indeed. The perfectly normal family inside the home sleeps soundly, blissfully unaware of what had just transpired the night before and what was getting ready to occur.
There was something unusual about the boy though, besides the obvious. He had noticed at dinner that the boy was shocked when the food had appeared. Not only that, but he had to be seemingly coaxed into eating when he was clearly starving. If Severus didn't know any better, he would question what kind of home life the boy had.
Sirius and Remus turned to them and smiled. “Hey ‘Cissa, long time no see. Thank you for bringing our Godson back to us.” Sirius said with a grin.
It immediately became apparent to her why Severus had brought him to her. He was far, far to skinny and short for his age and his cheeks that should still be slightly pudgy with youth, were hollow and sunken in. He was slightly paler than he should have been, his skin an almost sickly color and with dark circles under his eyes. All of the signs pointed very strongly towards severe Malnutrition, and she had a strong, horrible feeling that it wasn't the only terrible thing the poor child suffered from.
”It’s okay. It was a while ago, I’ve had a bit of time to get over it. We all lost a lot in the war.”
Harry walked with them as they looked out for people with the description he gave them, too worried to attempt to speak much. Blaise, Pansy, and Draco tried to cheer him up, automatically attached to him, but it didn’t help much.
Harry frowned slightly in disappointment. “Okay,” He continued to whisper, “Umm, can you please put me in a house that is not super you know, um ‘loud’.” Harry finished, slightly afraid that he would do the exact opposite.
(See the end of the chapter for
Pansy gave him a small and sincere smile. “You are absolutely welcome.” She had to resist the urge to tell him he had no need to thank her, because she had a feeling it wouldn't bode well.
They apparated shortly after that, Sirius only taking Harry off of his shoulder when he’d tried to climb down himself. When the toddler was set down, however, instead of running straight toward the park like they had expected him to he just stared at it with wide eyes.
He looked slightly unconvinced, but he didn’t say anything further.
“Hey little Harrykins!” Fred and George greeted at the same time with huge grins, Fred ruffling his hair as they finally let him go. (Harry can of course already tell them apart.)
Pomphrey was the first to speak. “Harry, have your Aunt and Uncle ever harmed you?”
Harry looked up into the eyes of Draco’s mom, which were much like her son’s. “I’m Harry and um, my Uncle Moony has scars on his face and my Uncle Padfoot has long dark hair and eyes kinda like your’s. They were with a bunch of people with red hair.”
He watched in anticipation as Professor Snape talked to a stern looking woman with slightly greying hair pulled back into a bun that he could only assume was Madam Pomfrey. He was at an angle where he could easily read both of their lips, so he watched them carefully.
He tensed, and decided that if he had any chance to get away from the Dursleys, he had to try and go through the post the red haired family had just went into. He stepped back a few feet, and ran through.
“How come you’re dressed like that, and where’s your stuff?” Pansy asked in her blunt way, and Blaise elbowed her. Harry sighed when he saw her lips move, because she talked way too fast and he had no idea what she had just said. He realized he would have to tell them then, so they wouldn’t think he was being rude.
Poppy mentally shook herself, her heart clenching at the little Indian boy’s politeness. “Hello Harry, Professor Snape said that you came here for a checkup?”
Harry clung to his Uncle Moony as they aparated away, Padfoot following soon after. They landed just outside of the Leaky Cauldron and the toddler’s little hands clung onto one of each of his uncles’ as they walked through the busy area to get to the entrance of the alley.
Harry was shocked at her heartfelt speech, and the determination that shown in her eyes. The fact that she had cursed showed how much she meant her words. He pulled her into another, much tighter hug. “Thank you Hermione.” He mumbled into her shoulder.
Harry smiled shyly, “Um you talk slow.” When he said this, Draco looked like he didn’t know whether to be offended or to take it as a complement, but just shrugged it off.
Harry got more and more nervous as the minutes past and they were still discussing his report.
An hour or so later all three of them were called over to their parents (whom they'd just then realized were together) to eat lunch. Once they made their way over there Harry received plenty of birthday wishes and was also introduced to the rest of the Weasley family. The raven haired boy had automatically decided he liked the other set of twins in the family as well and talked animatedly with the four of them for the majority of lunch.
Harry smiled at him softly. “Her name is Rena. I got her over the summer. I wanted another pet, but-” he paused, smile faltering for a moment, “I couldn’t bring myself to get another owl. And then this one practically tackled me outside of the shop she was being sold in, and I had to get her.” He figured he would go ahead and answer the blond’s unspoken question as well.
A hand was placed on Harry's shoulder, and he looked up, startled, tensing in fear and recoiling. He was braced for impact, the instinct the Dursleys implanted in him not going away anytime soon. Draco quickly jerked his hand away, and looked both apologetic and worried.
Harry jumped, and looked at the man with wide startled eyes. When Snape and Pomphrey nodded at him comfortingly, he relaxed slightly.
Draco’s eyes widened slightly. “You seemed to be able to understand me, I had no idea.”
At some point though, Harry got lost in the crowd of people and lost his family and friends. He looked around the crowd of unfamiliar faces and struggled to not panic. He couldn’t find them, but he saw three other children standing with what looked to be their parents and decided to go ask if they could help him. One of the children was a tan girl with shoulder-length black hair, one was an african american boy, and the other was a boy with pale blond hair and skin. He tugged on the blond one’s sleeve. “Um, hi. I lost my family, do you think that you and your parents could help find them?” there was a slight tremor in his voice.
“Floral,” he decided, the air outside of the steam room coming as a cold shock to his system once they stepped out, sealing the door behind them. “Oof, I can finally breathe again.”
“Open up,” Healer Malfoy-Potter called, banging on the guestroom door. He didn’t blame Grace for not responding. If it were Draco with child in that strange room, he would have locked the door against the world. “Have you at least taken your prenatal potions?”
“Healer Malfoy,” the pudgy man said in a strangely conversational tone. “Have you read this morning’s Prophet?”
It had actually happened on the table that Lucius’ mother had given them for their wedding. He’d felt guilty when he burnt it, but only for a moment.
“So, yeah. My question is: how are you getting over it? I mean what’s helped you move past it?” the blushing man finished.
“Wow,” an Auror with a long blonde ponytail muttered before showing her partner the card she had drawn from Harry’s grab-bag of minor cases. “Murder of a couple in ‘64.”
“Is that what you want, then?” Harry asked, flipping it back on Draco as he was wont to do. “A better reputation for the men?”
“Draco,” Harry laughed.
Harry shook his head. “Nope. You can’t go to bed.”
“Cinderella, Cinderella, let down your long hair,” Pansy joked.
“No, I’m being serious!”
“No ruining the surprise,” Harry insisted and watched Draco rise with a smile of his own. Who was really the one in control here now? “Come with me.”
“And then you met me at London Pride.”
“Daddy…”
“Guessing you’re not into electro-play?” she grinned.
Remus and Sirius had three hours of sulking to kill.
“I would never,” Harry said, acting incredibly offended. “Here, let’s go with something you already believe: Your lips are divine. After we snog they’re red and puffy, and they never fail to look delicious. Not ever.”
“So cute,” Draco murmured of his lover, ruffling his wet hair under the downpour. “There, now let’s get to the fun part.”
“Good. Started a project, which felt nice. You need a greenhouse for the gardens to start again, and I’m building one.”
“Network car outside.”
Harry stood up, hands folded behind his back.
Harry prided himself on being a gay man who didn't faint at the mention of anything feminine. Just because he was married to a man didn't mean he would forget everything to do with a cisgender woman's biology.
The only thing Harry wanted more than a sore body later was a spent one now. He clenched and fluttered around Draco half on purpose to drive him mad and half because he couldn’t stop himself from doing so. Being rammed repeatedly sent jolts up his spine and back down towards his cock, leaking again between them while Draco’s dribbled inside of Harry.
“You are!” Harry practically screamed, body convulsing to hold back his orgasm.
“Draco has told me of it, yes,” Harry answered, not sure if he’d be tested on it later.
“It’s him,” Draco said confidently, taking out his wand. “Wingardium Leviosa!” Draco lifted the mask from the older man and saw a pink, familiar face staring back at him. “Head Healer Augustus Pye.”
“I try,” Harry nodded before giving Draco a kiss on the temple. The whole idea of being ‘sweet’ was sticking with him somehow… And then he remembered the bowl of chocolate drops to their left.
“What, open up an empty room? There’s hardly anyone here and I assure you that I can pay for the cost of the room upgrade out-of-pocket,” Draco snapped before mumbling to himself that Shacklebolt would, of course, have to pay him back.
“Did you know,” Draco stated. “That I am really sick of that fact that the only conversations we’ve been having lately are heavy, horrible ones like the war is suddenly back upon us? So, if you could just tell me if you found the damned thing or not—“
So, he did.
“One!” Harry yelped as Draco’s bare hand left a stinging mark on him. “Two, three, four,” he gasped out while Draco held nothing back.
Tiffany was a sucker for muggle gossip rags in spite of her wizarding upbringing.
“And go on your ‘unreliable-and-spiteful bloke’ kick?”
“Go on.”
Leaving his office and the buzz of crime being solved behind, he screwed his eyes shut and apparated to his front door. That way, he could surprise Hermione and little Rosie.
“I’ll owl someone,” Draco suggested. After all, he knew plenty of Healers that he wanted to make miserable by dumping this on. Augustus Pye was at the top of his list.
“As you should. I never thought that the Malfoys could change you.”
Draco nodded. “Fade away, then. Would you like some water?”
“Sweetheart,” she tried carefully.
That made Draco laugh. “Not fair? That’s a new one.”
Harry put down his travel suitcase by the far edge of the room so Draco would have some space to throw his down, too. Harry slept in nightclothes while Draco preferred to strip and pass out on the closest bed-like surface.
“That’s not the point!” he shouted, actually feeling his blood heat up in anger. “The point is that we’re getting whatever baby we can get, and if it’s a muggleborn, or a different race, or anything different from us, then it’s still our baby! That’s our
Prepare yourself for one of my favorite tropes of all time. Also, my recent re-watching of The Shining may have influenced this. A lot. Sorry again about the slowness of updates! I just moved into my dorm and I’m getting into the swing of being a college student.
“Yes, Daddy,” Harry answered and wriggled against the lounge, getting comfortable and resting his head to the side so that he could look back up at Draco.
Surprises for everyone! This chapter was a lot of fun to write, and I hope you have fun reading it. Drarry is keeping me sane in quarantine hell. Stay safe, wash your hands, and take lots of baths, everyone!
“Yeah,” the sandy-haired man rasped. “Yeah, I do.”
“Fuck off.” Pansy crossed her arms.
“’Usually get’?” Draco questioned, amused and happy to be talking nonsense with Harry.
The tradition of talking things over with a bowl of chocolate drops between then had begun the week they’d moved into the apartment.
Harry had to pull back from their kiss to remove the tank, but he hardly felt the absence as Draco’s hands pawed at any and all of the skin Harry revealed. It was dark, and Draco couldn’t see much, but what he was feeling was more than enough.
Teenage romance was unbelievable.
Then it was Harry’s turn to smile. “I can’t say I know it, but I like to hear it,” he settled on, playing with the hem of the sheets.
Confused, he did just that.
Harry was all too happy to comply, though. He pushed his index finger in past the smooth rings of muscle, other hand tightening around Draco’s prick to keep him groaning.
“I’m glad, you look damn good,” Draco responded seriously. “There is nothing wrong with that answer.”
“It’s Ginny, the Editor-In-Chief of Safeword, the Madam of the hour apparently,” Harry grinned. “I spent all day with her today trying to track down where her employees were during the time when our story was sold, and we came up with a grand total of nothing.” It had been nice to catch up, though. “You knew of her before all this?”
“Really, you’re welcome any time,” Harry insisted. “Just owl me whenever you want to come take a look.”
“So you’re not just blind, you’re oblivious, too,” Draco observed with a strange fondness to his tone. “You’re a funny one.”
After the guard noticed one of the circles of neo-Death Eaters at another table trying to sign something out, he bounded over to put an end to it.
Grace’s stomach churned with an unshakable nausea that made her hands shake when she looked up at the offending cake and the container of icing next to it. She would have to open that container. She would have to get a knife. She would have to ice the cake alone.
“So do I, but—“
“Yes,” Harry answered quickly.
How could Draco focus on spells when he was being complimented so?
“I mean when you first saw the ring,” Draco sighed. It had been love at first sight with Harry and his wedding rings in a dark Knockturn Alley shop full of curiosities and rarities of all sorts. Just because Draco’s ceremony was done didn’t mean he was done with his wedding-planning- obsession.
“Where do we even start?” Harry asked, unsure. The neon-bright walls of the veritable toy palace off of Diagon Alley made his head hurt, but they all seemed to be color-coordinated with a type of toy.
From the second Harry walked into the hotel where their first meeting took place he was sort of blown away. The rooms there were much more than he could afford.
After dinner Harry occupied himself with watering the plants he’d gotten for the outside and for inside the house, having written down in a journal the instructions to care for each. Sunlight, water, and fresh soil meant something beautiful could grow at this Manor.
“You’d make a fantastic professor. I know fantastic professors when I see them,” Sirius said, thinking of Remus. Remus, Remus, Remus. Wait—time to get back to Harry. “And you were an ace seeker back in school.”
It was, after all, an extraordinary circumstance he found himself in with Harry Potter as his companion and fellow witness.
“No,” Randy said quickly. “Here is fine, here is fine.”
Draco had almost forgotten about the other Weasley siblings who weren’t Harry’s best friend or his old beard. It really had been a long time. He remembered getting pranked by the twins—oh, best not say the ‘t’ word, yikes—and remembered how the Dark Lord had crashed Bill and Fleur’s wedding.
Hope you’re all enjoying this as much as I am! I promise to keep updating, I promise I have an ending in mind for this one and it’s a long ways away. This one is for Nessa, and they know why. I love you, Valentine.
Draco started with a light swish of the flogger on Harry’s chest. This time, he decided, it would be a build to the pain. He’d make Harry work for it until he was close to begging.
The bite of pain sent a shockwave up Harry’s spine. He knew Draco was even bigger than this, but also that Draco would give him enough time to adjust to this before moving up to that. He just had to relax.
Draco rolled his eyes fondly. “You should be so lucky to have me in your bed. Macklemorian priests are actually only allowed to be gay. That’s the whole point of ‘Same Love’.”
Harry immediately flocked to his side so he could feel a warm, encouraging hand on the small of his back. He hadn’t slept well at all, so he rested his cheek on Draco’s shoulder.
When it seems the front door had answered Draco’s plea, even he was a little startled.
“I doubt you even wear those ear-plugs,” Draco snarked. “The sex I have? You’d want to be hearing it.” He got up to begin his nightly routine upon saying that, reminded of how fantastic he looked with less clothing on.
“You’re one of ‘those men’ for her, y’know.”
Draco’s stomach did a backflip. “If this is just because you feel bad for me—“
“We could always do a video tour,” Harry suggested.
“Fuck, do you realize how gorgeous you are when you’re eager to fuck me? That greedy hole takes everything I give it.” Draco wanted to claim what was his.
Harry blinked because he really didn’t know what he was ‘gonna do’ about that. Teddy was always a joy to look after on the rare occasions he worked up the courage to see him, and though more hyperactive Bill and Fleur’s kids were sweet when fed.
.” Sirius gave his husband a nudge and pointed to the girl in the doorway.
“Madam, if you could please seal the door,” Draco said to Ginny.
Shaking his head, Harry took the man’s hand. “Related to Bond, James Bond?”
Also, Remus and Sirius hadn’t died. Ha! What a spite to Nott that must have turned out to be, considering he was stuck in a cell for the rest of his miserable life. That was hardly a life at all.
“They’re the only ones who would print the story right,” Harry insisted.
Draco’s products took up about eighty percent of the space in their bathroom, and Harry had just taken to using them himself. Draco had better taste in colognes than he did in men, but Harry only borrowed the shampoo and soap. He never got why Draco needed conditioner, dry conditioner, hairspray, exfoliating cream, and potions of mysterious origins to keep clean, but whatever he was using worked.
“It’s not ‘real estate’, it’s
“Wait,” Harry said quietly, slowly.
When the saw a professional crew walk down the street focusing on two well-dressed men (Harry was finally looking sharp thanks to Draco) they pounced on them. Draco and Harry hadn’t even taken promotional shots for the show yet and people were treating them like celebrities.
Pansy couldn’t sleep. It was too hot outside and much too noisy.
He sprinted up their spiral staircase to see Hermione playing with Rose on the floor of her pastel blue room, painted with butterflies on the wall that were charmed to move on their own and float towards whoever came in the room. They rested by Rose’s crib when she slept.
“My ‘turf’? Hogwarts is my home, Draco, but I don’t think of it in any possessive way. It’s home to a lot of people, and now you too. It’s not like you’re coming for my job—nobody wants my job. I’ve been here two years, proven the ‘curse’ of the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher wrong, but still nobody ever applies to this post every year but me.” Harry offered a small smile. “It was a competition for your position, though, I heard from McGonagall. I’ve heard only good things.”
Ron sighed because he knew Harry hated it when she said that but it was true and right. “Look, I get ignoring us for a day, but twice in a row? Harry—are you even in there?”
“You look good,” Harry assured Kennedy in Draco’s stead. He’d noticed Draco wasn’t as animated as usual that morning and was planning on keeping a close eye on him until they could talk about getting him some rest alone.
“You get hexed quite a bit,” Draco whispered. “So I suppose that’s true.”
Now that made Draco smile. “You do? Tell me, sweetling. Tell Daddy how much you love being fucked.”
The hosts had been instructed to wear street clothes at all times, so Harry and whatever other lucky bloke he was doing this with would be constantly underdressed.
“It depends on who caught you. Students laughed and ran, McGonagall gave a stern talk and a warning the first time and a trip to the office the second time, Dumbledore gave you the sex talk—which was emotionally scarring enough to make sure he never found you again—and Snape just sort of looked at me disappointedly.”
A determined look came over Ron’s face. “Then what was it? Er, just like, a blowjob, or—?”
Their bodies met in perfect harmony, with Harry now for the fourth time since they’d started that Draco had been inside of him that he was the perfect size. Perhaps that was just his body adjusting, but it worked either way. Draco slotted into Harry easily after the past days of training, and proved his ease now to bring him to the edge.
Still, he repeated the introduction until Kingsley was satisfied with the number of copies. Harry couldn’t wait until he got to the part where he wouldn’t have to read rehearsed lines.
“Of how I’m going to make you come,” Draco smirked as he sat up, lips greeting Harry’s for the first time that day with kisses and devotion.
Harry cracked a crooked smirk. “You wouldn’t,” he answered because that was what he liked about Draco. For all of his exaggerations and eccentricities Draco Malfoy was not a people-pleaser, and meant what he said when he said it.
This was the first smart move he’d made in a while, even Grace had to see that.
Draco could think of a few things. “How beautiful I am? How you somehow got me to like you? That I have such questionable taste in men?”
“Hey.”
“Shoulders back,” Draco ordered, moving them for Harry. “Back straight, hips square.” Draco assessed him head-to-toe once more. “And chin up, love. You’ve got a lot to prove to me.”
“You cannot tell anyone at school anything. I can’t believe you would do this, play some sick fucking joke—If you say a word about anything I said to you, if you so much breathe it in Granger or Weasley’s ears a fucking syllable—Let’s just say I have enough dirt on you to get people’s minds off of my dysfunctions,” Draco snarled, defenses flying up like walls around him.
Sirius shook his head. “No, you don’t.”
Colin gave up on his lily for the moment to place the daisy flower crown around Theo’s head. It made him look like the prince of the wild.
“That’s Malfoy-Potter to you.” Harry gave Draco’s cheek a long kiss before turning to the box in front of him again. “I’m still full from breakfast. Want one?”
Grace crossed her ankles. “My Aunt always told me that it’s best to break bread before going to the Break Room.”
Draco’s thumb dug in circles along the side of Harry’s spine and moved slowly downward. The circles made the fabric of his shirt bunch up under Draco’s hands, but neither of them really minded. They had found a moment of peace in a storm of women and their babies.
“And?”
Still, Draco understood him perfectly. “There you go,” Draco murmured, smoothing his hand over Harry’s bare back in circles. “There, go ahead darling, you can cry all you like. I’m so sorry you had a nightmare, my sweet.”
“You’re killing me, Potter. Malfoy-Potter. My lawfully wedded husband whose thick, lovely cock I would very much like to have in my mouth. So beautiful, so handsome…” Draco moved from touching himself to running his hands up and down Harry’s thighs. “I want to feel you in the back of my throat. I’ll get it slick so you can push into me directly after. Wouldn’t you like that?”
Draco gasped into his mouth before fully realizing what was happening and riding that train all the way to hell.
“I hate him,” Remus muttered as he collapsed onto their couch, not even needing to specify who the ‘him’ in the situation was. Harry would tell them of Lucius’ coerced interview the next day, and how they had found the last missing piece of Benjy. Finally.
Seeing how he’d shocked and terrified Harry’s innocent ears, Sirius patted him on the back. “He quit when he finally got with Lily—she hated the smell—but Remus and I had made quite a habit out of it all on our own.”
Draco himself was terrible with any uncomfortable physical sensations. He bruised like a peach and always held a sour attitude when he was in pain, unlike the blissful release it seemed to bring for Harry when administered properly.
And if he and Draco were having a child? Oh, that would ruin Harry. He could hardly blame Rachel for wanting to give up the baby. “That’s horrible,” he murmured.
He’d lost a great deal of the baby fat that haunted him and replaced it all with muscle. His body reflected his hobby of wrestling, which he enjoyed comparing to fight club in order to escape the boredom of his day job of accounting.
you?” Harry laughed again. The question came out a bit more seriously than he intended, but he’d just never seen this side of Draco in person, only online.
“You’re really okay with it?” Draco pressed. “I love weddings; I happen to think they’re one of the most important events in a person’s life. Are you positive you want me there at yours?”
“Hm. Say I’ve gone to some university open house for applicants only where I talk to current students and form bonds and make connections or something,” Draco told him. That sounded slightly reasonable and responsible enough to throw his father off of his trail. “I’ll be back around… Hm. I don’t know when I’ll be back.”
“Oh, around once a month. I’ve gone with Pansy, Blaise, and Theo before, they have memberships as well. I’ll see them this weekend, though.”
“Wait.”
“Then I bid you farewell,” said Draco, opening his office door and showing Pye the way out. Thankfully, he took it without bidding Draco the same.
“This one is from…” Harry waited for the screen to load after clicking on the message with the subject line ‘Perfect guy for me’. “’Dear MTV, The love of my life refuses to meet me in person, even though we live in the same city.’”
“Fuck,” Harry rasped. “Fuck, fuck…”
Hopefully, there would be more than one season of the show as well.
“You didn’t have to pull out all of the stops,” Draco observed of the small banquet his parents had put together. “But you did. Interesting.”
Harry and Draco flattened their palms on the baby bump, crouching down to get closer. The first thing they felt was Grace’s heartbeat so they searched underneath the surface.
“You have?” Harry asked doubtfully. “This is not even an important conversation, you know. A baby has been born that we should probably get around to holding and telling the parents about how beautiful he is.”
“Yes, of course. Did you not hear me? You’re Daddy’s special, special good boy.” Draco kissed his chin. “You did so well, took everything I gave you and ran with it. You’re an excellent playmate, Harry, quite imaginative. When you promised me ‘anything’ I had to keep from coming right then and there.”
“Since the little bugger isn’t getting baptized, it’ll be in hell with Harry and I when we go.”
“Well, I’m afraid I can’t simply—“
Harry laughed. He couldn’t help it, Draco just looked so petulant when he wanted something and wanted it immediately, like a spoiled kid.
Well, not in this exact version of it, but on this land, this property. Draco had grown up here, in this idyllic, isolated place where nothing could really go wrong. Then came Harry Potter in a robe shop in Diagon Alley to muck it all up.
This wasn’t to say that Macklemore had done anything wrong since there were more errors with the way the media praised him lavishly as the first straight savior of the homosexuals, but he was a joke nonetheless.
There was only one gift left on the table: Harry’s. Draco had seen the small box in plain white giftwrap be placed down when they arrived here hours ago, and had raised an eyebrow at Harry who had simply smiled.
“Wait, you think it’s true?”
“I’m the guy,” Randy sighed. “I’m the one Lorraine has been talking to.”
The small orb to the side of Harry’s desk went from a calm, clear mist to a sea of red. “Someone needs backup.” That had also been one of Harry’s additions to the Auror department, per Draco’s request. He liked his husband in one piece.
*** *** ***
“Motherhood is magic.”
“Goodbye.”
At this point Harry was just buying whatever fit to shut Draco up, but that was giving him more than a few pains in his wallet.
“Right.” Harry saw the light that meant they were recording come back on. “Oh, here’s a good one. The subject line is ‘I’m ready to meet my prince charming’.”
“’And’ what? I don’t even know what we’re looking for anymore,” Harry sighed.
He shrugged. “Good thing we’re never getting old.”
“There you go,” Harry murmured and slipped the owl a conjured treat, taking the parchment from where it was bound to its claw before sending it on its way. “Thank you,” he called after, watching it flap its wings and fly off.
Harry’s throat clenched. Draco Malfoy, clad in leather and absolutely dripping with men while one took care of him between his legs? Yes, this was like no Healer’s appointment he’d ever had before. “Wow,” was all Harry could say before realizing that was probably an insensitive thing to say in the first place. “I mean, like, in a ‘good for you’ kind of way.”
Draco shrugged. “Saving the world, I suppose.”
“You know, that means Grace and her lies still get through to the second round.”
Draco faltered slightly at the mention of them and on instinct he wanted to block the question with another question. But if real trust was to be had here, then Draco couldn’t rely on impulse alone. “They are well,” he began. “As you likely know, they are still under house arrest in the France Estate. They keep to themselves, follow all the rules outlined for them in the trial. Mother’s taken up painting and baking.”
Harry’s face softened. “It’s going to be fine, Draco. No matter what your father says, it won’t be powerful enough to stop me from loving you.” He put a hand to Draco’s cheek and Draco nuzzled into it for comfort. “I mean that. No bigoted nonsense or personal attack could stop me from coming back home with you to this Manor tonight.”
“What?” he asked, amused. “Would you like to mop the basement? You’re welcome to, you know, but you don’t strike me as the mopping sort, dear.”
“But we haven’t even met them, and that hardly seems fair.”
Draco ran a hand through Harry’s thick and wild hair, sighing softly at how familiar it felt to him now. “Now that’s what I like to hear,” he said with a small, smug grin. “You like it rough, pet?”
Harry, Lorraine, and Draco followed by the rest of the crew shuffled down a narrow flight of stairs to the floor below Lorraine’s apartment with only some minor trips. Lorraine, being the only one who was familiar with the footing of the apartment building, reached the bottom of the stairs first but waited for Harry to be the one to knock on the door.
He sat with crossed legs on his bed, settling into the rumpled sheets with all the messages of the blokes who liked him just based on a measly paragraph description. It made something rare blossom inside Harry’s chest—hope. That was dangerous.
Theo had seen that one coming, and spent the whole night preparing retorts. “You literally killed a member of your family. My mother. Are you forgetting that, or are you just mad after being locked up so long?”
“I do,” Harry nodded, resolute. “Will you have me?”
Pansy Parkinson, Draco’s longtime confidant, had a house on the Jersey Shore. Draco recalled it fondly, as the last time he’d been there it was a blur of booze and men (and some women for Pansy) cycling through the house and spilling out onto the beach.
“Healer Lark? Oh, that won’t be necessary. Those are my aunts,” Draco informed him fondly. When Lark saw that the crazy poof Malfoy was behind whatever the hell was going on. “Just take the kids back to the ward.”
“Tryouts will be at the end of the second week of instruction,” she announced from her clipboard. “Shall we head to the tower, Professor Potter?”
It was the beginning of the month, which meant a ritual that Harry had introduced in his first months of being Head Auror when the cases coming in had mostly been broom accidents and minor domestics. He and Ron had gone into the archives and come upon the thousands of cold cases that had been boxed and stored after the trail went dead. It kept the department efficient, and had intrigued a certain Kingsley Shacklebolt.
Harry could do nothing but cry out, leaking dribbles of come from his untouched cock.
“Uncle Harry, are you two getting married?” asked Lucy.
“That hard enough for you?” he teased, the next swish of the tails coming at only a slightly faster speed.
“Fuck, Harry!” Draco’s toes curled under and his eyes screwed shut in a moment of complete tightness in his body, clenching hard around Harry before the release came to him gut-first. An explosion of heat followed by a burst of white overtook him, leaving him to shake and shudder out the last of his release over Harry’s chest who welcomed it with open arms.
“Now you’re just lying,” said Draco.
At first, Colin was delightfully oblivious. “What?”
There were only a couple photos, too. All profile pictures. “Try the first one,” Draco told Harry. The first profile picture Chris ever used was of a dark-skinned man wearing a fuzzy vest and an appropriative bamboo hat at some photo shoot for an unnamed brand.
Then Draco did something that sent Harry’s eyes rolling back into his head. Draco flicked a clamp, sending shocks all the way down to Harry’s cock.
“That was completely different,” Lucius defended. “We were promised to one another.”
Ron and Theo were both sidekicks to the power couple and knew it. They could probably have a lot to talk about, and near-identical complaints about Draco and Harry. They could swap secrets and embarrassing memories, which Ron was severely lacking in information on Draco.
Should he threaten Draco’s dates or should the parents of Draco’s dates be threatening Draco? Who was going to pay on dates? Should he advise Draco to get sexual experience in at this age or advise him to guard his virginity with his life? The absence of gender roles left Lucius in the dark.
It was not love at first sight, not in the slightest, as cute as eleven year-old Draco was to eleven year-old Harry. Draco had been a little prick, not unlike Dudley at all, and Harry gave Draco his first dose of reality by rejecting him outright. Before that Draco had lived in a bubble where everyone extolled and adored him and his abilities.
A pitiful groan escaped Harry’s mouth. Draco had only been rutting against him, but he was already hard.
Draco had been cruel to everyone in school, and he could hardly blame them if they were still bitter as adults for the venom he’d injected into their young lives.
“What?”
“Yeah?”
“Yeah?” Draco asked idly, tucking a lock of raven hair behind Harry’s ear. “Define happy.”
And Hermione was a soldier about it.
“But now…”
From the other side of the room, Ron couldn’t help but laugh at Harry’s pre-pubescent vocal crack. “Right, yes, it never happened,” he agreed through his laughter. Poor Harry had been so disturbed by what he referred to as ‘The Incident’ that Hermione had to get him some warm milk and a cauldron cake to calm him down.
All eyes were on Draco and Harry who were very much alive, lit like candles in the black-marble room.
Sirius hugged him again before turning into Padfoot so he could jump all over Harry to be pet. Sirius barked and licked his face. Sure, it was weird, but Harry rubbed Padfoot behind the ears anyway. No family was perfect, but this makeshift one with Sirius was phenomenal. Harry would get more baby stories that he couldn’t remember out Sirius later.
This time she was wary not to run into any other patrons of the night. Grace’s heels were only an inch high, so she was able to sprint without falling flat on her face. Actually, with the baby bump, it’d be flat on her uterus. Ew.
After having attended high school together, to say they hadn’t parted on the best of terms was a massive understatement.
“Goyle and I meet for drinks once a month. He’s more of a pub bloke, and that’s fine. He’s gone steady with a Hufflepuff from our year and works in Knockturn Alley.” It had been shaken down by Aurors before but there was nothing illegal there, just some darker-than-most magic. Nothing wrong with that in Draco’s eyes. “It was hard for him to get work with his name. I know the feeling.”
“Of course. It’s your story to tell. I can start with a few guided questions, and we’ll see where they take us,” Luna began, getting out her wand. “The quickquotes quill I use,” she explained, summoning the quill and a long roll of parchment. “Are made to record only what you’re saying, not anything else. I know Skeeter adds… description with hers, but here it will just be our words.”
“What? That’s absolutely absurd. Were you going to go egg his house?” Draco had only seen that in muggle movies Harry showed him, but it looked like a practical revenge tactic.
Ah, the juicy part. Draco had never spoken publicly about his feelings on the war. Not once had he ever responded to the thousands of inquiries after the trials or on the anniversaries, but these students… they deserved the truth.
As if Harry could feel the increased in heartrate, he pulled back and looked at Draco with a tilted head. “What’s wrong?”
“You are capable of great things, all of you,” Draco insisted. “And I cannot wait to see them. My office is open to you all especially as my house and my responsibility. Even if you simply need to talk, I will be there to listen. Teenage years can be… tumultuous, to say the least. Know you are never alone in this journey to becoming fully-realized witches and wizards. I am here for guidance, assistance, instruction, and to keep you from making the mistakes that I did. Are we clear?”
A lot of people seemed to get that wrong about sexual dominants. Draco, madly enough, was not a selfish man in bed.
“Right,” Draco nodded, his thoughts having momentarily been elsewhere in the land of possibility—the possibility of Harry bent over washing the floor in a maid’s outfit.
“Oh-!” Harry exclaimed in surprise, arms curling around the small of Draco’s back. “Hello there.”
He stressed over telling the Marauders his secret, he tore his hair out over coming-out to his parents, and bitten his nails to nubs when he realized he was in love with one of his best friends.
Lucius’ head cocked waiting for Draco to elaborate.
Whatever bizarre force had been stopping Harry from seeing Draco as a romantic partner—whether it was the fear of Draco rejecting him or something more deeply rooted—had seemingly vanished.
“We’re also clearly fucking
It had started out simple. He’d dream of men on top of him, holding him down and being rough. Then, the men stopped holding Harry down and tied him down with chains and ropes. They’d only let him out if he was a good boy, which involved answering a lot of questions.
“Hey now,” Harry laughed. “I’m already left out as the only brunette here.”
Harry laughed. What kind of question was that?
“I mean, look at the story. She messaged the official Macklemore fanpage not expecting a reply—just to say she liked his music or whatever—“
“Second to Fourth, meaning I need to finish the fourth floor. Ugh, there’s just so much that needs to fit in here to please father…” Draco cleared his throat when he realized he sounded like a kid again, stuffing his face with spaghetti in quiet embarrassment.
“You’re my Daddy!”
“Fuck, fucking dammit.”
“You’re incorrigible.” Draco let out an annoyed huff, looked away from the camera, and picked up his phone. He grumbled something along the lines of ‘ridiculous’ and ‘unbelievable’ as he dialed the network representative.
“Shut up,” Alvaro laughed into his shoulder. “The first thing you say to me in person and it’s about my height? You’re such a little bitch. Where’s my ring?” The words were harsh and frank but the tone he said them in was full of joy.
Harry laughed imagining Tom Riddle saying the words ‘sexual deviancy’, that no-nosed freak.
“You really are sweet.”
Draco was practically halfway out the door when he realized Harry had spoken. “What?”
Spending so much time with Draco had cleared up a few things about Draco’s particular sense of humor and his intention in doing what he did, but the man was still for the greater part an enigma. Draco did things that Harry really could think of no rationale for, like insisting on ordering water at restaurants without the customary lemon and snapping at waiters if they dared to leave it in. Draco always had a look on his face like he was perfectly justified in doing all of them.
“Do I really sound like that?” Draco demanded of Harry, smacking him a few times for effect and in hopes of a quick response.
. Fuck. Where do you come up with shit like that?"
Harry hadn’t been expecting that. Draco had, but he was so focused on his father’s confused and disgusted facial expression that nothing his mother said mattered. This also wasn’t the outfit he’d wanted to wear when introducing Harry to them again. Why, why hadn’t he gotten to do this his way? Why had someone robbed him of that moment?
“Don’t worry about it. My years in Hogwarts were some of the best of my life, and all of the teachers there—“ now that Snape was gone “—are absolutely kind and wonderful, and it’s a great school. For free.”
“Well, if you insist.” She took her chair and put on her most devilish smirk. “So I was coming off a win streak in Atlantic City, coins all over my tits, when…”
“Just tell me something, Draco. Which one of you is it?” Lucius interrogated. His deadly serious tone made Harry have to swallow down his dread. He had to be brave for Draco, for himself.
Harry nodded eagerly and, heaven help him, smiled right back at Draco.
That was a shock. “Please tell me you at least have pictures,” Harry grinned. He’d never had the means to masquerade as a woman himself and sometimes liked to wonder what it would be like to wear some kitten heels and a corset.
Narcissa, exhausted from the arguing and from seeing that
“Darling,” Draco said affectionately, without having intended to finish the sentence.
Harry’s hesitance was to be expected, Draco supposed, but it didn’t make it any less chilling to see Harry’s carefree mirth drain from his eyes. “Hey,” Draco said, turning Harry’s chin up so they could look each other in the face. “It doesn’t hurt, not anymore. Don’t you give me that look.”
Harry nudged Draco’s side. “Really, though. Look, here’s one detailing how they’d desecrate my corpse. There is, for some reason, a lot of horses involved.”
Most of the requests Harry made in bed were brilliant. They were naughty, filthy, and completely obscene. Draco loved him all the more for those wild ideas, and found it to be yet another lovely surprise of moving in with The Boy Who Lived after months of dating.
“They don’t,” Draco confirmed. “It’s just a rumor that human life can exist in such a barren wasteland.”
“Agreed.”
Finally, a barely-clothed elf stumbled into their room. “Gerda is very sorry, the peacocks… The peacocks do not like Gerda. Not one bit.”
“Is that Harry?” came a voice from within. “Oh, Harry, let me see your face!”
With a little hum Harry moved back against Draco. “I like to be your good whore,” he said softly. “Tell me what you want, Daddy, and I’ll do it.”
“So,” Sirius said, putting a reassuring hand on Olivia’s shoulder. “Tell me what you’re thinking.”
Draco reached down for a last time, clamping hard around Harry’s cock and tugging. “Who’s your Daddy?” Draco demanded. This couldn’t last forever but he’d make a hell of a memory of it.
“Yeah, well, he also raised you like a lamb to the slaughter and lied and avoided us at any occasion, then left us some cryptic gifts. I’m going to venture to say that even though Albus had some wisdom and positive influence, I don’t think we should trust that entirely,” Ron muttered bitterly.
Hours into the party already, they arrived at about the same time as Pansy and Maggie. The urge to grab a fistful of those ridiculous red curls would always lurk in Theo for some strange reason. He just wanted to see if they were real, was all.
“Yeah? That’s good to hear,” Draco nodded.
“You’re welcome to visit any time,” Draco invited her. “The Manor is far from complete, so you’ll have to excuse the construction, but if you need anything from my library you’re more than welcome to it. We have some collections that have been in the family since, well, always.”
Draco’s silver eyes snapped to her brown ones. Could it be her fault?
your card?” she asked boldly. King of Spades.
“Actually,” Harry said, thinking of his tough day at work. “I imagine you didn’t get my owl to the hospital, or you’d be angry with me for that, too.”
“I guess, um.” Harry put his hand behind his head. “It just feels wrong to talk about. I just want a healthy kid.”
But the students of Hogwarts were likely a long ways away from impressing anyone with their potions follies. Draco was prepared for lots of melted cauldrons. He just hoped nobody would cry over them.
Harry gritted his teeth. “That wasn’t Draco.”
At the mention of the word ‘discriminating’, Luna Lovegood appeared seemingly out of thin air with her puffy blue dress. “Is he giving you any trouble, Harry? I could always talk with Headmaster Dumbledore.”
Harry was sleeping more soundly than he had in years, so all of Draco’s gentle movements were really entirely unnecessary, but Draco kept it quiet just in case when he slipped an arm around Harry.
Harry nodded without a moment’s hesitation. “Yes, I do.”
“Harry Potter! With Draco Malfoy!” the voices roared from outside the landing of the fireplace.
His arse got a pinch from Draco’s free hand. “Stay still,” he commanded. “I’ll make it worth your while.”
The waitress returned with Draco’s card. “We hope you join us again soon, Sirs and please, bask in the clouds with us as long as you please this evening.”
Harry just breathed, focusing on the air going in and out, the rhythm slowing to match Draco’s guiding breaths. When he was steady enough he nodded.
“And it never will, no matter how much my father nags me,” Draco declared. He had apparated them to the beginning of the driveway to give them enough time to talk about what was to come. “Harry, I really must ask you again if you are okay with this.”
Harry shamelessly rutted into his hand, his own hands still groping Draco’s arse. Merlin, was he sculpted. “Now you have,” Harry grinned right back. He stole another kiss so he could moan into Draco’s mouth, the heat in his stomach rising with each thrust inside him and stroke of Draco’s hand.
It struck Harry then. Draco’s birthday—this weekend! He tried to maintain his cool, train his face to not look like he’d just had a panicked epiphany.
Remus had agreed to meet with the Auror squad later that night, since this clue was even more ridiculous than the rest. It was detailed, and long, and made Harry’s stomach churn to read.
He shook his mop head of hair again. “No, I’ve got to man up to some stuff, and this is just the first on my list.”
“What they mean to say,” Raina translated through gritted teeth. “Is that we have the fewest students of any house. Slytherin hasn’t won a house cup in eleven years. How are we supposed to win out over the others?”
the Draco on the screen said with a scowl.
Pansy laughed and rolled her eyes. “This is not about me, Zabini. This is about you and the Golden Girl.” Plus, Pansy had all she needed, strangely enough.
Before Sirius could get around to describing how the ‘mob boss’ had ‘begged for his pathetic excuse of a life’, he heard Olivia scaling the stairs once more.
Harry peeked out a window. “That’s a lot of space,” Harry observed. “You could put a Quidditch Pitch out there and have room to spare. What are you going to do with it all?”
The man who ordered it always got prissy about people not pouring the toppings in correctly, so Harry did his best to be precise.
“You’re still busy now,” the rookie Auror tried, hoping his humor would save how tremendously he had fucked up his job. Who let a student disarm them?
“Harry,” Lucius said, half as a greeting and half as a request. “Do the lights in that room turn off?”
And when it came to fried rice and orange chicken, Sirius always had a second serving.
Ron grimaced slightly at how apathetic Harry sounded. “So,” he tried. “How are things?”
“I will find who is responsible for this,” Harry swore in front of the family. “Who exposed such a private part of our lives. I will.” Harry had the means and the magic to get answers from anyone he wanted.
“This way, this way,” Pansy led Draco further in, taking Harry along for the ride through the eclectic crowd. “I’ve got to show you—“
“Yes.” Harry easily slid out of the tank top, tossing it to the counter and looking back up at Draco. Now there was one tall, good-looking man. His hair looked like gold spun to platinum silk the way the light bounced off of it. This whole flat looked really different now that he’d taken the blackout curtains down in a panic.
“You,” Harry panted, finally able to breathe through his mouth again. “Love you.”
“And that’s why I work so much, why I have almost no free time. Kathy knows I’m gay and knows what we did was a mistake, but… I could never just leave my kid. I want to support him even though I don’t love his mom,” he told Alvaro. “He’s my kid and I love him. I just… I didn’t want it to ruin things between you and I. I knew that a kid might scare you off.”
Draco had been a part of the Clique To End All Cliques. It was a group of snotty, privileged rich kids that had way more money to spend then they could possibly ever deserve. If Harry’s memory served him correctly, Draco had been in that gang with Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott, and… Crabbe? Maybe there was a ‘Goyle’, too.
“Oh, joy,” Theo deadpanned.
“As hot as
“God bless and keep you,” Mr. Georges finished, tucking the bills away into his overalls.
“It’s four in the afternoon,” Harry told Draco. “You really needed the sleep and I needed the break from being ordered around.”
“What?” The joke landed flat. “Look, why don’t you just eat.” Blaise got stupid in the mornings before he was fed.
‘Uncle Draco’ was thrown for a loop with each sentence. He’d never been spectacular with children but this extreme discomfort was a first. These children at least hadn’t read the Prophet’s filth but what if one day they did? Would they still be so eager to call him Uncle? It took Draco a moment to realize he wasn’t responding, just standing there looking petrified.
“Theo emptied them out, actually. He kept half for himself and gave half of it away.” The half he kept was more than enough to keep him rich for the better part of a thousand years, too. “So if anything was there, I think Theo would have noticed a body part a few years ago.”
“Father,” Draco half-laughed half-rebuked. “No.”
The out-of-body experience began when they saw the subject header of the email.
“Is this supposed to make me feel better or something? Because you’re doing a pretty shit job at it,” the son remarked in a sad effort to keep his cool.
“It’s not like that, Harry. We just have to pick the best candidate. Okay, now here’s Rachel Priestly. She’s twenty-six, married her high school sweetheart, but he died a few days after they found out she was pregnant. Now she’s giving up the kid because she can’t raise it on her own,” Draco went on.
“I know,” Harry said softly against his shoulder. “I’m not going to.”
“You should,” Harry insisted. “Some of them are very good. One day I’ll get you to watch Star Wars.”
“We have, ah,” Harry started.
Harry whimpered at the absence but was soothed soon again to feel Draco’s hands grip his bruised thighs. “Yes,” Harry willed him on. “Please take me.”
He tried to channel his own guilt, his own neuroses, into something positive. It made him a thorough Healer, always skeptical of the easy solutions now. His methods were sound, and those patients that didn’t reject him outright usually came to be quite grateful of his services, making him their primary Healer. He took pride in that, and sought greater power in St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries not to line his already-stuffed pockets but to help more people. Maybe if he helped enough people in such a real, tangible way like saving their lives or easing their pains then it might be enough.
Draco made a face. Had he just admitted to himself in some strange way that he was Harry’s friend? That Harry was his friend? This whole working situation was really fucking with Draco’s perception of friendship in general.
Harry’s mind skipped to him being taken advantage of by the other man, made to feel used and open with the other man’s cock. He’d never wanted it so badly before.
place?”
“Brendon Finlay.”
“Draco,” Harry said, eerily calm for the magic essence arching around him. “Who is this?”
But this was no dirty dream, this was the real deal. “Harry,” Draco said, leaning forward so their faces were inches away. “Are you ready for me?”
When it stopped, she looked to Draco with wild eyes. "
*** *** ***
“What?” Harry asked, furrowing his brow. “Just because she harassed you at work doesn’t mean that she could get past your, er, filtration process.” It still made his stomach feel uneasy to think about. Hermione’s words stuck in his head.
“’Another scream from the vault. ‘
“I didn’t hurt anybody,” the young boy defended, taking a step back. “I only came here to apologize.”
“Well.” Draco wasn’t sure how to approach this, as he was with most things, so he just did what he usually did and charged in to make a mess of things. “We need to speak with someone who personally knows Macklemore.”
Draco beamed. “I love you too, Harry.” He said it even though he knew thousands would be reading it, and he said it proudly.
Draco was smiling through the whole exchange between his friends, though he was even more worried about Harry now, but he grinned hugely at the joy filled expression on Harry’s face. Even in the short time he had known him, he knew that the expression didn't grace him often.
"A drop." Harry hears after a few minuets and he looks to the side and see Malfoy looking at his essay.
"Really. The world isn't split into good people and death eaters." Sirius says with a knowing smile and Harry nods.
"And do you feel you can talk to mister Weasley now?" Harry thinks for a moment before looking down and shaking his head.
"Winky please don't tell anyone if I don't eat." He says and Winky looks at him.
"Hey Potter did I leave my jacket in here? I can't find it." Draco asks as Harry lets him in and walks back over to the sofa.
"Minerva has informed me to tell her if you refuse food and I think we both know this is the better option." She says and Harry puts the potion on the table next to his bed and shakes his head.
"I'd love it a lot more if you would stop fucking about and actually do something productive." Harry grins at how impatiently needy Draco is.
"What do you mean?" He asks, genuinely confused how she knows everything.
"How did you know that's why he's blushing?"
"Well it wouldn't be the worst thing." He mumbles and McGonagall smiles at him.
"Mister Potter." McGonagall says sternly and Harry presses his lips together. He knew she'd be upset with him but he doesn't like hearing the disappointment in her voice. He's flat out refusing to look at Malfoy.
"So we just need to go flourish and blotts?" Harry asks, looking at Draco. He notices that Draco is sitting up straight but he's holding his butterbeer with both hands and looks uncomfortable and Harry frowns.
"My dragon likes you too so we're even. Maybe our dragons can be best friends." Harry jokes and Dracos eyes drift to Harrys still exposed dragon before looking back at his.
"That's cute." Draco says and Harry nods.
"Not great. He's not exactly thrilled that I'm dating you but I think he's more mad that I told George before I told him." Harry explains and Draco sighs.
"I'm not hungry."
A few more minutes go by in silence and then Harry realises Draco's stopped writing and is looking at his quiz, his eyebrows furrowed and the end of his quill tapping against his lip absentmindedly as he thinks. Harry looks down at his essay and reads the question he's answering.
Ron doesn't have a plan as he says the password and enters the common room, only that he needs Draco Malfoy's help. It's 4:30am though, and he doesn't know where the boys dorm rooms are, so he walks over to a Slytherin sat by the fire asleep and shakes her shoulder gently. She wakes up, bleary eyed, and frowns when she sees Ron.
"Oh they definitely do." Pansy says with a smirk. "Just cause they're meant to hate you doesn't mean they can't appreciate your attractiveness."
"Thanks." He mumbles and she grins again.
"Brandon." There's an awkward moment where no one says anything else, Brandon staring at Draco with a look that makes all four of them feel uneasy.
"It is just about the biggest fuck you to all of them." Harry says and Draco raises an eyebrow at him.
"Hey." He whispers back, his hand still on Harry's face, and Harry reaches up and pushes a few stands of hair out of Draco's face.
Draco watches as Harry comes and wow Harry looks like a fucking god. His muscles are so visible and he's panting and his eyes are only half open and his hair is a mess and he's staring right at Draco and Draco needs to remind himself to breath. Harry pulls out of Draco and lies next to him, gathering the blond in his arms and pulling him onto his chest.
"Wasn't as uncomfortable as when Weasley walked in a few minutes ago."
"Why don't you ask Hermione. She seems to know how I'm feeling more than I do." He mutters before pulling his hand away from Draco and leaving the room.
"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside, I'm not one of those who can easily hide..." Draco's never heard this song before, but the way Harry is singing it makes Draco's heart beat faster.
"I smell like home?" He asks and Harry nods, smiling slightly, the extra courage the fire whisky is giving him is slowly lessening but it's still there for now and Harry is going to take advantage of it.
"Room of requirement. I had to avoid all the eyes on me." Harry mumbles, feeling at least a dozen pairs of eyes on him at the moment. Hermione starts rubbing his back and Harry raises his head so that his chin is resting on his arms instead of his forehead. Ginny and Ron start talking about the quidditch match in a week or so, Gryffindor vs. Hufflepuff and it's the first game of the year. Harry was allowed to stay captain, considering the 8th years are essentially retaking 7th year as the war made it so they couldn't finish our education. Ginny is still chaser and Ron is still keeper and they've been practicing all summer. They have only been back at Hogwarts for a week but Harry was keen to start practicing, flying takes his mind off of things, so he held tryouts the day after professor McGonagall told him he was captain.
"I- I'm fine. I just- dizzy." He mutters and Blaise wraps his arm around Harrys waist.
"I'm okay with it, by the way. Well, I'm working on it. He seems to care about you, like we had a 3 minute conversation and he didn't insult me once." Ron jokes and Harry smiles.
"Well done! You did so well!" He says and Harry smiles slightly, pulling Seamus and Dean into a hug.
"Where are we?" Draco asks and Harry throws his cloak and map on the table before turning to Draco.
"No he's not." Malfoy says, glancing at Harry before looking back at Teddy. Teddy reaches out his tiny hand and grips Malfoy's thumb and Harry smiles slightly as he sees Malfoy's eyes immediately soften. Teddy looks at Malfoy for a second before letting go of his thumb and flinging his tiny arms around Malfoy's neck. Malfoy automatically places his hand on Teddy's back before looking at Harry and glaring.
"Sirius Black was your godfather?"
"Sounds like a plan." Will says before he and Rhys leave the castle.
"Shit I have practice in like 5 minutes!" He gasps and he almost falls over as he jumps out of his bed, realising he's still holding Draco's hand. Draco chuckles and lets go so Harry can get up properly.
"And my dads animagi was a stag." He explains and Draco moves on to the constellations.
"He thanked me." Blaise smiles slightly.
"Maybe he's being tactical, I mean they have to play quidditch against each other, maybe he just did it so he could see their game plan." He says, trying to give their friend the benefit of the doubt, and Dean shakes his head.
"How did you figure it out?" Draco asks after a few minutes of avoiding Harry's eyes, settling them on the wall opposite them.
"Narcissa asked me to." Harry says and Draco raises an eyebrow at him.
"Lovely. Get up, both of you, the quidditch game starts soon." Hermione says before leaving the room.
"I don't know. I had a bit of a freak out in history of magic, and herbology wasn't the best." Harry shrugs and McGonagall nods.
"Could we- maybe like... Is tomorrow too soon? But it would have to be, like, after 3 ish, if that's okay? Cause I promised my team we could go to hogsmeade together." Harry stutters and Pomfrey nods with a smile.
Draco feels relief wash over him at the sight of Harry but frowns at his actions. Is he always this closed off from Granger? They always seemed so close. Granger looks kind of hurt by his actions so Draco turns to her, mutters "Ill make sure he's not dying" to try and reassure her before following Potters lead and heading upstairs.
"Something happen?" Dracos voice is soft and Harry thinks maybe he wouldn't make fun of him or judge him for what he was thinking last night, but he also thinks maybe he's just being optimistic.
"Wow, Malfoy giving a genuine compliment." She jokes and Draco offers a smile.
"Harry I don't think you understand that, for my whole life, I have heard stories about you, listened to my father and the other followers plot against you, heard your name constantly. I've spent the last 8 years constantly aware of where you are and what you're doing." Draco whispers, keeping his eyes shut because this feels like a confession he shouldn't admit to. Harry is silent just long enough to make Draco regret it.
"Mister Potter when was the last time you had a decent night sleep?" She asks, immediately noticing the bags under his eyes. Harry shrugs.
"Your handwriting." Harry says and his voice is quiet and nervous but Draco hears a hint of determination as if Harry has been wanting to say this for a while.
When he stops talking he glances over at Hermione and sees a bright smile on her face.
"Why not?" Draco asks.
"No! Well... sometimes we just want to have a laugh, mate." He mumbles, hesitant, and Harry instantly feels nauseous. He knows he shouldn't but he can't help it. Before he can stop himself he's looking into Rons mind.
"Shut up, Potter. Don't be ridiculous." Draco is blushing furiously and Harry grins.
"Erm, Hi Malfoy." She says, deciding if he isn't being mean to her or Harry then she won't purposely be mean to him.
They start walking side by side, Harry breathing deeply, trying to calm down, and Draco glancing at him every once in a while to make sure he's okay.
"Well, I can give you some calming draught, but Harry I don't want you to become reliant on it. It seems to me you have not properly processed all of the things that have happened to you. Which is understandable, considering just how many things have happened to you. You haven't really had time to. Having such a big weight placed on your shoulders when you were so young, along with everything else, has not been good for your mental health." She says and Harry feels a tear fall down his cheek. He knows all of this, but hearing someone else tell him he's so messed up is hard to hear.
"They still need work, but thanks. You too." He says, pouring the syrup into the cauldron as Blaise stirs. The liquid goes from a bright pink to a deep blue.
"You're hot when you blush." Harry mumbles in Dracos ear, causing Draco to blush more.
"I'm usually not but apparently I have no say in what happens when you're around. My body goes into autopilot." Draco says, slightly embarrassed, and Harry smiles slightly and tilts his head to the side, as if he's confused.
Harry slumps back into his chair and opens the book. As he reads he notices someone has drawn small constellations in the margins of the book and Harry finds himself paying more attention to them than to the actual words. Harry walks to the front of the library to where Madam Pince is and checks out the book, and when he gets back to his table he sees another book on his table that definitely wasn't there before. He puts the astronomy book in his bag before picking up the new book. He's surprised to see it's a muggle book, Pride and Prejudice. The copy is old but pristine, no bent corners, no marks on the cover, and no cracks in the spine. He knows it's old, however, because the pages are slightly worn which shows its been read a lot. It's definitely well looked after. Harry frowns at it, wondering where it came from. The Hogwarts library doesn't hold many muggle books, and this is definitely not one from the library, it doesn't have the Hogwarts stamp on the inside of the cover. It's a beautiful copy, and Harry hasn't read this book yet. He sinks into his chair and reads for an hour, until Hermione shows up to make Harry go to lunch. Harry grabs his bag, keeping the book in his hand, knowing he's going to read it during lunch.
"Yes. Yeah I'm fine." Blaise looks at him for a second before deciding to accept that he's okay.
"Yeah sure, why not." Harry says and he catches Malfoy's eye before winking at him when no one is looking which makes him blush.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You sure this wont cause suspicion among the Gryffindors that see me lying on you?" Draco mumbles as Harry runs his fingers through Draco's soft hair.
"We both know I know whats going through your head right now." Harry mumbles before gathering every ounce of courage he has and pressing a soft kiss below Dracos ear. Draco swears he stops breathing for a second and he freezes before he feels Harry do it again. His heart is racing as he wraps his arms around Harrys waist and he feels Harry smile against his neck. He pulls back slightly to look into Dracos eyes and see they're full of lust, love and nerves. He's certain his are the same. Harry still can't help but tease Draco, though, so he smirks slightly.
"Mate, are you sure you're okay with this?" He asks and Ron looks up again, rolling his eyes, and he doesn't look mad at all.
"This is what master Sirius used to wear." Oh. Well shit. That doesn't bode well.
The four of them get to potions and Harry sits next to Seamus as Hermione and Ron are sitting together, and once Professor Slughorn has started talking Seamus looks over at Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You want tea or something?" Draco wants to say 'something more than just water' but he also doesn't want to upset him. Harry glances at the pot of tea on the table, then up at McGonagall who is looking right at him, before bringing his gaze back to Draco.
"Thanks."
"I'm- I'm scared." McGonagall frowns.
"If you don't take him, Draco, I will. Just for the sole purpose of pissing everyone off." Blaise says, winking at Harry, and Harry laughs when Draco flips Blaise off and shuffles as close as possible to Harry's side.
"You're the reason I'm alive too." Harry says, and he means it in more ways than one, and Draco smiles a beautiful smile that makes his eyes sparkle.
"Oh brilliant idea pansy get us drunk that'll help the situation." Draco mutters, but they all make their way over to the bar anyway.
"I know. I er, I have the resurrection stone, and I use it to talk to them sometimes." He sees the concerned look on Draco's face and hastily adds "Only 3 times. And one of those was an accident." Draco relaxes slightly. "Last time was when I was in the hospital wing. They mentioned you. I asked if they like you. My dad," Harry breaths a quiet, quick laugh. "He said you were an ass, but so was he, and so was Sirius. I was too, to be fair. Remus, he said that you're good, and you care, and that's all that matters to them. They like you, Draco."
"He's... well he's coping. Most of the time. The war really screwed him up. Plus he hates the fact that people still call him the chosen one and all that stuff. He hates the fame, but he can't get rid of it. And he has nightmares about the war. He can't shake the guilt; he's convinced all the deaths that happened are his fault." She sighs before looking at Draco. "Don't tell anyone this but sometimes he says he wishes the curse had worked, because at least he wouldn't have to live through the aftermath of the war and the thought that it's all down to him." She says before frowning. "Are you okay? I know people still don't get that you were forced into what you did." She says and Draco sighs before shrugging and standing up straight.
"Miss Granger I'm going to have to insist that you leave." She says as Harry shoots up, gasping for air, and he sat up so fast his head is spinning and he feels sick. Madam Pomfrey gives him a potion that Harry recognises as a calming draught and Harry has a sip of it before taking a deep breath and falling carefully against his pillows, shaking
"Brandon Avery, my dear Harry, is Draco's ex boyfriend." Blaise smirks, and Harry nods, because he knew, or at least figured, Draco had been in a relationship before him. Draco knows Harry has. He doesn't see it as a problem. He glances at Draco.
Harry and Draco went back to bed after their kiss, just lying next to each other in silence with Harry's arms wrapped so tight around Draco and his face pressed into Harry's neck. Harry is stroking Draco's back softly, and he can feel Draco's smile pressed against his skin, both of them just basking in the fact that they're in love. Harry's still scared though. Still terrified because yeah loving Draco and being loved by Draco is amazing, but it makes it real, and it means if anything happens to Draco then it's going to hurt so much. It would have hurt anyway, but before, when he didn't know that Draco loves him, he could pretend he hated him, and he had nothing to lose, so it lessened the pain. But this is so real, and to lose this now, Harry is sure it will kill him.
"Well I thought you were going to fucking die." Harry mutters and Draco smiles.
"Why it's Perfect. Absolutely perfect. I can feel it calming me down from here." He grins before moving on to the next pair.
There’s another memory within this one, starting with James sat on the same sofa as the last one, looking nervous as he runs his hands through his hair.
“We’re having a girl! Harry’s gonna have a little sister!” James says and Sirius grins.
"Hey." Harry says softly, continuing to look out of the window next to him.
Draco wakes up first, as usual, and the first thing he notices is that his legs are tangled with Harry's. They've woken up like this a few times and it always makes Draco's heart flutter. He opens his eyes and checks to see if Harry is still asleep. Harry's face is mere inches away and Draco can feel his breath, deep and even, signifying Harry is still asleep. Draco leans back a little bit so he can look at Harry properly and smiles when Harry tries to pull him closer again, his grip on Dracos side tightening as he does so, and Draco blushes because now his entire body is pressed against Harry's save for their hands which are linked in between their chests. Draco forces himself back only slightly to prevent Harry from pressing against a certain part of his body that, if Harry would have woken up, would have led to a very awkward and uncomfortable conversation. Draco has found that he's had to avoid Harry seeing or accidentally touching that certain part of him a lot since they started sleeping together, but what he doesn't know is that Harry has the same problem. Harry's hand moves from Draco's side, falling so his arm is wrapped around Draco, and Draco freezes slightly when Harry's eyes start fluttering open.
Draco, from where he had been sitting in silence for the last few minutes, decided to speak. He knew that Harry wasn't particularly happy with him at the moment, but maybe he would forgive him because Severus had taken it so well. He lightly tapped the still shocked boy on the shoulder to get his attention, and he definitely did not like the slight flinch his friend did.
He had no idea what to say. Did he tell them the truth? Or did he lie? The Dursleys had always said that if he told anyone about their punishments that he would get one worse than he had ever had before. But, his new friends had said that some of the things the Dursleys had said were wrong, so maybe they were about this too? The Professor might be angry with him for being a freak and getting his stuff destroyed...
When the boy slowly, fearfully, shook his head  no, Snape cringed. He had been afraid of that. Then a thought struck him. He was a practiced legilimens, and he’d been experimenting with a new strategy.
Draco and Severus shared a very concerned look, and all pretence of the boy being like his father faded entirely. “No, Harry, I am absolutely not going to punish you.”
Both surrogate-parents walked on either side of Harry as they held each of his hands and led him over to the two playing children that had caught his attention. When they stopped in front of them, Harry ducked behind Sirius, clinging to his leg and only one of his eyes peeking out. The man laughed and reached his arm back to pull him into an awkward hug. The two redheaded children they came to meet looked up from the sand at the sound of his laugh and looked at the family curiously.
Harry nodded, so Draco gathered his things and they left.
Harry continued to smile at him. “Do you think you can bring me to him soon so I can thank him? I've only gotten one gift in my life and I-” He broke off, a pained expression taking over his face. “Let's just say that didn't end well for me. I want to make sure this one does.”
They didn't speak as they waited for Professor Snape to arrive, knowing from the other students that he always arrived early and hated students speaking in his class out of turn. It was a really good thing that they arrived as early as they did.
Draco frowned, but couldn't push the question further because class had started and Binns began speaking.
“I don’t give a shit about blood protection.” he spat, interrupting him, “I care about Harry and I care about the fact that Harry would not be loved in that house!” Sirius inhaled a breath, calming himself a little. “I’m in the will, Remus and I get first priority custody of him. So give him to me before I call in the other Aurors.”
“Yeah, I’m going back.” He said, trying in vain to attempt cheerfulness.
Draco was also mildly surprised--his godfather didn’t apologize to people often.
Dumbledore had said the boy was deaf, but he seemed to converse easily with his new  friends. Though, he had learned not to trust Dumbledore. Not only that, but he was sorted into Slytherin of all places. Severus had originally expected him to be an exact copy of his father, all arrogance and foolishness. But, it was beginning to dawn on him that that was not the case, and he was wrong to have judged him without having met him first.
Harry was at a loss about how his new friend could already read him so easily. “I...just...um...its nothing.” He stuttered. ‘Questions are annoying, I’m not allowed to ask questions. Aunt and Uncle said so.’ He thought to himself.
This was all the go ahead Harry needed to get his own small portion of the large amount of food around him and start eating.
When Harry finally spotted them, Sirius was looking around frantically running around just outside the shop and asking if people had seen him and Remus wasn’t far behind him, looking almost in tears. Harry’s friends actually were in tears, even Fred and George, and he felt so bad.
"Draco..." he started tugging on the blond boys sleeve and pointing, "what are those?" He made sure to tear his eyes away from the carriages, so he could look at Draco and read his lips.
They continued to speak and the Weasleys and Narcissa’s husband also joined the conversation, while the children introduced themselves to one another. Both unlikely groups became fast friends, easily adding in Blaise and Pansy’s parents to the mix when they came out of whatever shop they had disappeared to originally.
So, the beginning of the chapter is in third person Severus' POV and then switches back to Harry and Draco's third person POV.
“Typical Hermione.” Harry said, shaking his head affectionately and chuckling.
“Hello. That's a nice little sculpture you two are making.” Sirius greeted with a smile. “What are your names?”
Harry froze in fear at being addressed, but luckily was able to read his lips at the better angle and didn't need to look down. He only wished that he knew the answer to the question he was asking. “I-I don't kn-know sir.” he winced as he felt his voice stutter.
Draco’s eyes widen slightly. He may be 11, but he knows that this is not normal behavior and that something is very wrong with Harry's homelife. “No, no Harry, it's okay. You can cry if you want to cry, whatever your uncle said is wrong. I just wanted to know if you were okay, and what made you so upset, I was never going to yell at you.”
They reached two large doors which were held open by McGonagall and another creepy looking man who had a cat by his side. The first years shuffled in anxiously, and gathered at the beginning of the loud great Hall and stood in a huge crowd. McGonagall told them to stay there once they all were in and headed up to a front table with a bunch of adults sitting at it. Harry tensed, overwhelmed by the large amount of people. They were all talking, he could see, and wondered how he would ever be able to survive in this school. He wouldn't be able to understand most people when they spoke to him, or hear when someone came up behind him. He nervously ran his hand up and down his left arm in nervousness.
Harry smiled at him again. “Thank you.”
Harry was beginning to think that that was not as innocent a question as it seemed to be, judging by the professor's face. He didn't think he could really form words to answer his almost question, but he managed. "I misbehave and Dudley is a perfect angel." his voice came out slightly resentful, and he knew, that by the end of this, he was going to get into so much trouble at the Dursley's.
The family clung to each other for a little while longer, reassuring each other that they were all there. When Harry was finally set down, he was thrown into another hug by his four worried friends, and he hugged them back just as fiercely. When Harry was finally officially let go from the embraces he turned to the Malfoy family and Draco’s two friends, who were smiling at their reunion. He motioned towards them. “They helped me come back.”
Draco made a face like he was about to say something else, but before he could, something out of the corner of Harry's eye caught his attention.
Hermione looked up at Ron’s greeting, and gave Harry a bright smile, closing her book. “Hey.”
A few moments of comfortable silence passed as the two boys occupied themselves with different things--Harry was reading a defence book he had dug out of his bag while Draco entertained Rena--before they heard the train squeak to a stop. They were thankfully both already dressed in their school robes, as they both were surprised that they had already arrived. A quick look out the window told them that yes, they had actually arrived and weren’t stopped by something as they had been in third year (and if Harry let out a quiet sigh of relief, than who was to blame him really because this year just might be the only normal year he ever got in Hogwarts).
Harry turned his attention from his gawking audience to Draco, looking at him in confusion. “Um, why are they all staring at me?” He could feel the slight waver in his voice.
The twins also didn't notice their parents talking to each other, as they were trying their hardest to get as many smiles on their new friend’s face as they good. They both felt an automatic need to protect him from the harshness of the world that even at four they knew existed. This boy, who they figured out was the Harry Potter their parents told them about, was a living representation of that.
Harry grinned and it lit up his eyes. He had the kind of grin that you couldn't help but smile back at and want to see more often. “I’d love to be able to help you guys. You have been so nice to me so far and I just want to be able to give something back to you.”
“I haven’t, but it seems amazing! Where should we go first?” Harry asked eagerly.
“Oh Harry…” Hermione started, the tears in her eyes a mile away from the excitement that had shown in them just a few moments before. “I'm coming through.” She said, before a whoosh sounded and suddenly she was standing in front of him, quickly pulling him into a tight hug.
Draco looked at him sympathetically. “That's what people do, especially when your famous. Even me, though I'm not as famous as you. They judge me by my last name, because they think that my family did something that they didn't. Not just me though, they judge the whole of Slytherin House because we have an “evil history.”
The desks in the room each sat two people, so Pansy and Blaise sat together in one and Draco and Harry sat in another. Harry stared at Professor Binns in awe, still unable to believe that he was seeing an actual ghost and that they actually existed. He shook himself and carefully shifted his new quill pieces the couple pieces of parchment Draco and Professor Snape had given him on the table so it was lined up to his liking. He had to stop himself from asking his new history professor a billion questions about what it was like being a ghost and how he liked teaching the subject that he was.
Thank you so much for reading and feel free to leave me some constructive criticism!

Harry frowned. “No, it's anonymous. I wish I knew who it was so I could thank them.”
Draco chuckled, but it was slightly dry and some of his nervousness began to show. “I'm afraid not, though I wish they had. That information would have been really useful.”
read his lips anymore after that. Because, it had finally hit him that he wouldn't have to be at the Dursleys’ nine months out of the year. He could potentially, for the first time, have a real home with real friends.
Draco’s smile became very clearly strained. “We did.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dumbledore looked at him with the same cheery expression. “Now, now Hagrid- this isn’t goodbye. You will see him again when he comes back to Hogwarts. The time will fly by in no time.”
“I dunno.” the little boy mumbled as he looked down at his shuffling feet.
Draco gave him a small smile. “Okay. Um, I was going to say that they're going to be calling our names soon, they're in the L’s now, so I'll be going up any minute. When I sit down at the Slytherin table, keep your eyes on me and I'll gesture to you when they say your name. Whichever house you're sorted into, I'll still be your friend, even if you're a Gryffindor. Remember that.”
The Prefect finally looked directly at them, so Harry was a able to understand the next thing they said. “Students, this is Slytherin common room, which alongside your dorms and your classrooms, will be your home for the next seven years (excluding Holidays of course).”
Draco shrugged. “Maybe we'll be surprised.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The intelligent boy didn’t look very convinced, but nodded nonetheless.
Let me know what you think so far, or if you have any questions or concerns.
Harry attempted a reassuring smile. “I'm fine ‘Mione, really. I've just got a few… demon’s to battle is all.”
Harry gave a small smile and agreed, taking the robes that were handed to him a second later and quickly changed into them. They sat down and continued talking, and a few minutes later the train stopped. Draco, Blaise, and Pansy all grabbed their things and then Harry followed after them when they exited the compartment. They stepped down the stairs and off the train into a place that Pansy, Draco, and Blaise explained previously, was Hogsmeade. The rest of the years other than first, headed over to the horseless carriages, which harry blinked at, utterly astounded.
Harry ran his hand through his already messy hair, thinking about the fact that it was going to be a long next few weeks before he returned to Hogwarts.
Snape’s eyes narrowed slightly. “Very well. Where would I look if you told me to find a bezoar?”
Through the whole interaction with the box, Harry hadn't noticed Draco watching him. So,  when he started crying Draco was alarmed and came over and tapped Harry on the shoulder.
His godfathers shared a look. “Come on, what’s wrong pup?” Sirius asked, crouching down next to Remus on the child’s other side.
“Do you know how to write?” Snape asked slowly, afraid of the answer.
Harry stared in disbelief at the Hogwarts acceptance letter in his hands. He had already quickly read over it, and was standing slightly away from one of the dusty old sitting room windows of 12 Grimmauld Place. Harry, for a moment, felt as if he were thrown back to the summer before his first year, just finding out he was a wizard.The letter he had received, was an official Hogwarts letter stating that Hogwarts was inviting all of its previous seventh years back to attend as eighth years. He had never thought he would go back there. Though, there was never a doubt in his mind when he had first read the letter that he would be going back, back to the place he had considered home for 6 years. He only hoped it would still feel that way after everything that happened, because he needed the feeling of home that Hogwarts gave him more than anything.
A few moments later, he saw the door open out of the corner of his eye, and looked over at the people who entered. There were three people, two of them boys and one a girl, who looked to be about his age. In the front of them, was a boy with slicked back, pale blond hair, striking silver eyes, and pristine, nice looking robes that made Harry feel even more inferior. The other boy was dark skinned, and in a simple t-shirt and black slacks, while the girl had loose, curly, dark brown hair, tan skin, and dark eyes and was in light pink robes. Even with the blond boys hair, none of them even came close to resembling the Dursleys or any people they would associate with, and he almost sighed aloud in relief. Harry gave them a shy smile, hoping that maybe, just maybe, these people could be his first ever friends.
Harry nodded sheepishly, looking embarrassed. “Yes sir.”
Hermione grinned even wider, though he had previously thought that it would be impossible for her to do so. He was glad that his false cheerfulness was ignored for the moment.
they do that to Lily’s child! How could Petunia do that to her own sister’s son?!  And, Severus thought, if they had done that, what else have they put the poor child through?
They waved away his thanks and sat at the four person desks at the charms classroom once they arrived there. They didn't really learn much of anything in that class, as it was the first day so they just went over the syllabus.
Harry looked at him in complete shock, normally fairly well kept mask falling from his face. An adult was apologizing to him for something? He couldn’t believe what he was ‘hearing’.
Before any of the redheads could answer, Sirius did. “How about the Quidditch store they have? We could get you a new toy broom?”
Pansy’s eyes softened and after making sure he was looking at her, spoke softly. “You can ask as many questions as you want, especially about your parents, here. What your aunt says does not hold up while you’re at Hogwarts.” She paused and at his hopeful expression returning, decided to continue. “And it seems that he did. I'm sure most of the staff here knew them, maybe you could ask them about what they were like later.”
"You wanna tell everyone?" Draco asks and Harry shrugs.
"How-"
"Yeah." He says apprehensively. Seamus looks at Harry, watching Draco's hands for a moment, knowing that Draco is probably the one allowing Harry to sleep so soundly. Seamus turns his gaze to Draco, looking at him thoughtfully. He know's Harry is in love with him, which is probably why Draco is helping him sleep, but why would Draco actually willingly sit there running his hands through Harry's hair unless he loved him too. He nods at him before turning back round the corner.
"He's Harry Potter, You think he's not gonna get some?" Pansy asks and Draco glares at her. He doesn't mind Potter getting some, he just wants it to be him he's getting it from. Pansy knows exactly what he's thinking from the look on his face and she smirks.
"Can you read my thoughts?" Draco chuckles.
"It's too late! You had your chance. How could you do this to me? What about the children?" He asks and Harry sighs.
"So when would you like to meet again?" Michael asks as they enter the wing.
"How are you gonna tell him?" Hermione asks, leaning closer to Harry and Harry shrugs, glancing back over at Draco to see Pansy sat on his lap grinning and Blaise sat next to him practically vibrating with what looks like happiness. He wants to tell Draco in a way he knows he means it, because Draco doesn't get that Harry genuinely doesn't blame him for what he did in the war. An idea hits him whilst he's watching Draco and he turns to Hermione with a smile.
Harry sighed, and gave him a weak smile. “Its okay, I understand.” He couldn't be mad at his friends, especially when said friends intentions had been in the right place.
Harry didn't,
He didn't want to disappoint the man who was helping him so much though, so he followed him in silence.
“You- you’re apologizing to me?”
Harry’s eyes widened in wonder and hope. “He knew my parents?” He asked before he could stop himself and then a look of fear crossed his face. “Sorry, Aunt Petunia says never to ask questions, especially about my parents.”
“Padfoot! Moony!” He exclaimed running toward them, relieved and guilty tears falling down his face.
“Have you guys been here before?” Harry asked, looking around him in awe still at Diagon Alley.
Albus Dumbledore with his long white beard and pointed hat, stands in wait outside of the home next to a worried Minerva McGonagall. If you were to look in the direction that they were, it would appear as if they were only looking up at the stars. But, if you looked long enough, you’d see that they were waiting for the sound and the appearance of a roaring motorbike.
Sirius laughed and Remus rolled his eyes good naturedly and so the Weasleys and the makeshift family headed to Quality Quidditch Supplies. It was only a little bit away from where they were, so they got there quickly and walked around in wonder with lots of enthusiastic conversation, even from some of the adults.
Harry was looking from the professor to the charmed quill and parchment in rapt attention the entire time and walked out of the class with a smile.
Harry looked at him like he had just told him the single most important thing in the world. “Who?”
Right now though, he had to start out with reassuring the child before him, then he could possibly consider seeing if he could convince him to take a trip down to Madame Pomfrey's with him. There, they could assess what further damage had been done to him. “Firstly, young man, you absolutely deserved those those things and your relatives shouldn't have done that. Secondly, I will see to it that you get some new supplies and make sure that they don't fall into your aunt and uncle's hands.” Somewhere, in the very back of the man's mind, he noted that he was going very soft for the boy with Lily's eyes, very quickly.
He broke out of his awe when the sudden fear hit him that he would miss the train, and hurried over to an opening and climbed through it. He walked down the long halls of the train, set on looking for an empty compartment. He finally found one towards the end, and slid open the door and sat down. He glanced out the window, and then pulled his wand out of the waistband of his overly baggy pants, and began to twirl the only thing he had left between his fingers.
Inside, Severus was angrier than words could detail, but he didn’t let any of that show on the surface. He didn't want to scare the clearly fragile and jumpy boy. So, he decided to ask one of the questions that had been nagging at him. “How are your aunt and uncle with their own son?”
Harry gave him his first large and sincere smile of the afternoon. He was overjoyed at the thought that his opinion mattered to someone for once.
Well, anyway, I hope you enjoy!
Draco tapped on his shoulder, and he looked up reluctantly. “Aren’t you going to change?”
This chapter is probably a little shorter than normal, and I'm sorry for that. I wasn't feeling very inspired today as I was writing it and I just wanted to finish it.
Hi, long time no see...
“I love you too, pup.” the two men responded automatically. They smiled when he ran away from them and immediately went towards the toy broomsticks they had.
”Thank you.” Harry managed, though it can out even quieter than normal. He couldn't express how grateful he was to his new friends, and to Professor Snape. He had never thought that he would be given the chance to be happy, that he deserved to be happy. That he deserved things like gifts and friends, and that people could even stand to be around a freak like him, because that was always what his aunt and uncle had always told him. He just hoped with all that he had in him that they wouldn't decide that he wasn't worth it anytime soon and prove his relatives right.
"How dare you. I am not pretty." He says and Harry grins.
"The students ship? Where?" He asks and Harry chuckles.
Harry sits in his usual seat at the back right table next to Ron and when Draco, Pansy and Blaise walk in and Blaise gestures Harry over to the back corner he raises his eyebrow. He's guessing Draco told them about what happened considering there's still a blush on Draco's cheeks making him look absolutely adorable.
"I am."
"I am." Harry says softly. "You're staring too."
"I'm fairly certain that 13 year old Draco would either just not believe it or jerk off." He says and Harry smirks.
"Cause I know everything." Blaise says and Harry bites his lip and looks back up at the ceiling.
"You know, Harry doesn't stick up for just anyone." She says quietly and Draco frowns slightly, looking over at Harry, who has his back to the table.
"Empty threats, Draco." Harry whispers in his ear, throwing a leg over Draco so he's straddling him, not moving his arms. Harry is very much enjoying watching Draco try to stay together, but Harry is determined to break his composure. Dracos hands are itching to touch Harry, and he just wants to grab Harry and pull him closer, but he doesn't even know if Harry feels the same way he does, he could just be teasing him or trying to get him to talk.
"So what you been thinking about that's got you so distracted? And don't say stuff cause I will hex your dick off." Harry jokes and Draco sighs.
"Nothing we wont continue when you get the fuck out." Harry jokes, but he actually means it, and Draco brushes his finger across the back of Harrys waistband, so George can't see, making Harry bite the inside of his cheek.
"Harry it's okay." Draco says again, running his hand down Harrys arm and grabbing his hand, his other hand cupping Harry's neck.
"What does that mean? What do I smell like?" Draco asks curiously and Harry gets the feeling he's using the fact that Harry has consumed alcohol to get him to say things he wouldn't when he's completely sober; jokes on Draco though cause Harry would say this any time.
"So... she not even gonna acknowledge the fact that you're lying on me?" Draco asks and Harry looks from the closed door back up at Draco.
"We were teasing him or he was thinking or talking about you." Pansy finishes for Harry, who grins.
"I'm gonna go eat. You can... stay here. If you want?" Harry nods slightly and Draco blushes.
"Except there's always been a you and Draco."
"No, Draco. Now is not the time to read." Blaise says, taking the book from him, and Draco raises an eyebrow at his best friend.
“You never told me you chose to be my roommate.” Draco says knowingly after a few moments of silence and Harry rolls his eyes, of course McGonagall told him.
"Being alone." His eyes are watering and he didn't think he'd cry and by the looks of it neither did McGonagall. She smiles sadly at him.
Hermione and Ron are sat at the end of the long table and Harry sits next to Ron on the very end of the bench, happily tucking into the slice of steak and kidney pie on his plate; It's been a long day and if he's eating maybe people will finally stop asking him about his tattoo. Teddy, who is sat on Harrys lap eating some mash, starts to get a bit restless and Harry decides, as they're sat at the end, he can do something he knows will calm him down. Harry sits Teddy on the end of the table and casts his Patronus. A big silver stag appears and stands at the head of the table, causing many students to gasp, or jump in shock, as Harry's the only student that he knows of who can produce a Corporeal Patronus, not even Hermione can. (A/N I know he taught everyone how to in the fifth book but we're ignoring that canon cause it makes this work better). Teddy immediately stops fussing and smiles curiously, reaching his hand out to touch the stag. Harry watches as Teddy strokes the stag, occasionally taking bites of his pie but not feeling very hungry. He feels eyes on him and looks up to the teachers table to see McGonagall looking at him. She catches his eye and nods appreciatively and Harry smiles slightly before turning back to Teddy. He seems to have calmed down so Harry stops focusing on the stag and watches as it disappears. Teddy looks at him with wide eyes and Harry smiles at him as he yawns.
"Yeah he can be a bit of an arse."
"And you're sure no one shot any spells?" McGonagall asks and Blaise and Draco glance at each other before looking back at McGonagall.
"But that's when Harry got all dizzy and looked like he was going to pass out so we took him to the hospital wing." Blaise finishes and McGonagall nods.
“GUYS!” Lily says to get the four lads attention before she turns to James.
"She offered me some potions and stuff, but if I take them then the second they wear off everything will be twice as painful."
"Minerva." Harry says and McGonagall rolls her eyes.
"Yeah, we're partnered in potions and we had joint practice earlier. He's not all bad, I guess."
Harry presses a kiss against Draco's hip before standing back up and kissing a blissfully relaxed Draco. Draco grabs Harrys top lazily before deciding he is genuinely offended by how many clothes Harry is wearing. He grabs the hem of the top and pulls it over Harrys head before letting his eyes rack over his body. He has seen Harry shirtless many times, but never in this situation. He looks over the scars covering his chest, his eyes lingering on the one above his heart caused by voldemorts second killing curse, and the one directly below his neck caused from wearing the horcrux. His eyes travel down further as he admires how beautiful and toned Harry is, before noticing the bulge in Harry's joggers. He's a lot more nervous than Harry seemed, but the fact that Harry is just stood there watching him with a loving look on his face, not rushing Draco or taking the piss at how nervous he is, it makes Draco braver. Draco bites his lip before slowly pushing Harry's joggers and boxers down.
"Oh my god how when where what happened tell me everything." Pansy says in one breath and Draco smiles, explaining what happened, stopping before he gives too much detail.
"Somewhere I know no one will look for me." Harry says, not wanting to give his only quiet place away.
"Are you sure?" He asks, kind of breathless because hearing Draco ask Harry to fuck him is the best sound Harry has ever heard. Draco nods but Harry needs to know he isn't just saying this because he thinks it's what Harry wants to hear. Harry moves so he can see Draco's face and looks him in the eyes.
"It was not."
"Nothing." Malfoy says and he notices Harry clench his jaw.
"I'll sort it out don't worry." She smiles before walking away.
"Yeah. Greatest person I ever knew." Harry's voice has gone wistful and Draco holds his hand properly.
"I don't want you anywhere near my name. It doesn't deserve you. Besides, I want to be a Potter." Draco says and Harry smiles slightly.
"You got a good team together." He finishes and Harry looks up at him, shocked at the compliment.
"Thank you, Professor."
"Yes sir." Harry says, and Pansy grins. They spend the next half an hour talking, and at 10pm, when Draco is leaning his head against Harry's thigh again, Harry's fingers carding through his hair, and Pansy is drifting off with her head in Blaise's lap, they decide to go up to their dorms.
”Perfect.” She says and Harry turns to look at her.
"As if you could find a better keeper." Rhys says just as the final few arrive. Blaise, who had been watching the interaction between Harry and Rhys closely and not liking it at all because they're far too close and Draco is his best friend and he really would love it if Harry and Draco got together and if Rhys gets in the way that won't happen, moves so he's next to Harry before addressing the two teams.
Harry and Draco lie down, connecting their bodies as if it's second nature to them, their legs slotting together and their arms winding round each other, fitting perfectly together as if they're pieces of the same puzzle, made to slot together. Tonight is different though, because they usually lie in a less intimate way. They always fall asleep with their foreheads pressed against each other and holding hands between them, so even though their legs are touching, there's a small gap between them. And yes, they wake up completely wrapped together, but doing it in your sleep is different. Tonight though, Harry slots his arm under Draco's neck and Draco presses himself flush against Harry's chest, his face pressed into Harry's neck. Harry wraps his arms around Draco, burying his face in his hair. Neither of them know why today is different, or why Harry suddenly had the confidence or nerve to pull Draco close or why Draco let Harry pull him close and he buried himself in Harry's chest. Neither of them notice Blaise's soft smile and eye roll as he climbs into his own bed either.
"Drop it Potter." Draco says and Harry smirks, sitting up on his knees and placing his hands on the headboard either side of Draco.
"Oh I will. You gonna sit down, Draco?" Draco blushes slightly before sitting on the chair next to Harry's bed.
"Professor we just want to talk to him!" Harry closes his eyes tight, willing the dizziness to go away, and Draco stands up.
"Is he gonna want any of this?" Draco asks before seeing a plushy snitch and grabbing it. "No okay I'm getting him this." He says and Harry chuckles at how childlike and adorable he is.
"I see your point." She says and Harry looks back up at the sky when Seamus and Dean arrive.
"I'm sure he will forgive you." She says. "Now go and eat something. I mean it. You're loosing too much weight." She says and Harry smiles guiltily.
"When she died, she was pregnant. I was gonna have a little sister." Harry says.
"What do you want from me, Ron?" Harry asks. He can't be bothered to beat around the bush, he just wants Ron to get to the point so he can read his book.
"My office." Harry knew this was coming. He walks past the three of them and makes his way up to McGonagalls office, noticing McGonagall didn't follow him which means she's still talking to Malfoy and Blaise. Harry stands in front of the desk, waiting.
"So I'm gonna go see him again after transfiguration." Blaise says and Draco doesn't look at him but Blaise knows he's listening.
"Potter?" He asks quietly and Harry blinks rapidly.
"I know you didn't mean it, Mione, it's fine. Why's he been distracted?" He asks and Hermione rolls her eyes.
"People are staring." Harry says quietly and Draco squeezes his hand a little bit tighter.
"He confuses me, Mione." He mutters and she rolls her eyes, smiling down at her oblivious friend.
“You spoke about your aunt and uncle.” He says and Harry frowns slightly. He doesn’t like to think about them.
"I just don't want her to worry." He says and Harry turns his hand over and grips Dracos hand in his.
"Firstly because you are a supportive friend, secondly because there's a certain seeker you love watching." Draco glares at him and Blaise and Pansy roll their eyes.
"It's called being in love and not knowing how or being able to express it." Hermione says and Harry shoots up.
"Do you- Should we talk to Malfoy?" Ron frowns.
"I just need his help." Then, noticing her skepticism, he holds his hands up. "Honestly, Harry needs him."
"Funny. You were a spoiled brat." He jokes and Draco glares at him.
"I could tell." Draco's joking about Harry nearly killing him, but Harry still feels awful about what he did to Draco.
"Doesn't mean we weren't worried, mate." Dean says and Harry nods, putting his hands in his pockets.
"Because it's your name." Draco says, blushing, after a slight pause, and Harry grins, grabbing Draco tight and kissing him hard on the lips.
"Doesn't change the fact that no one will want me to be part of the slytherin team. And they'll assume you only picked me as a seeker because I'm your friend." Draco mutters and Blaise sighs, shaking his head but agreeing not to say anything else about it.
"Honestly I'd rather not enter the lions den again so soon." Harry nods and grabs his guitar before following Draco to the Slytherin common room. They make their way up to Draco's dorm room, both of them feeling extremely awkward, and when they get there they stand awkwardly. Harry is just now realising how tired he is, and the thought of sleeping feels enticing for once rather than terrifying, but when Draco took him to his room the other day Harry was pretty much out of it and it wasn't this awkward. Draco sits on the side of what Harry is assuming is his bed, and Harry sighs before sitting next to him.
"Yeah. She spoke to you yesterday, right?"
"What you thinking about?" Harry's brain is moving a million miles a second and it's driving him slightly mad.
"I think you need a nap, cause my mother loves you and you're delusionally tired." Harry smiles slightly as he sits up.
"I know you're awake." Draco whispers into the space between them, and Harry's lips twitch into a small smile.
"You think you're confused. You should have seen his face when he came to me earlier." She chuckles, running her fingers through Harry's hair.
Gryffindor are winning 90-40 when Harry finally catches a glimpse of the snitch, flying around the Hufflepuffs goals, which is coincidentally right in front of the stands Draco is sat in. Harry makes a beeline for the snitch and catches it easily, grinning as he feels the cold metal against his palm and he makes eye contact with Draco and winks at him as Madam Hooch declares the end of the game. Harry flies to his team mates, not before seeing a bright blush spread across Dracos face, and is immediately engulfed in a hug from Katie Bell.
"Of course darlin'." He whispers before casting a wandless charm to lube up his dick. He lines his dick up and slowly pushes the tip in, stopping when Draco gasps. Harry leans down to kiss Dracos neck, just under his ear.
"Harry stop looking in my head!" Ron snaps and Harry glares at him.
"Ron, since we've been dorm mates me and Draco have kind of called a truce. We aren't at each others throats anymore." He says, almost laughing because that's not true, they're at each others throats more than ever, just in a different way.
"Only a bit?" Draco asks, a smile toying at his lips, and Harry laughs quietly.
"What was that about?" Ron asks and Harry shrugs.
"Okay, well done everyone. You all did really well. I'll post the list on the common room bulletin at some point so keep a look out." Harry says before dismissing them and walking over to Dean and Seamus, who have just put the bludgers away. Seamus wraps his arm around Harrys shoulder.
"Can you not be loud please." Draco hisses and Blaise raises his hands in surrender.
“She was pregnant, Mione.” Harry turns to her. “She was pregnant when she died.” He chokes and Hermione pulls Harry into a hug.
"Potter, I can't begin to imagine how hard the past few years and months have been for you, but you can't give up or stop trying. I've had some of your professors say to me that you didn't try during your lessons today." McGonagall says and Harry sighs.
"Yeah, okay. I'll get the ingredients." Harry walks over to the supply closet and starts grabbing what they'll need. He and Blaise are, it seems, the first pair to either state which each potion was or decide which one they want to make because Harry manages to get everything they need and take it over to their table before anyone else stands up.
"For 10 hours?" Malfoy asks, not believing Harry at all.
Wagwan my G's, wa's gwanin? ya girl is going on holiday to Italy on Friday so I'm not sure when the next update will be, I'll try and post next week but I'm not sure if I will be able to. Thank you for reading this though, I appreciate you and love you all <3
"You're gonna get a lot of grief from the wizarding world, you know." Harry whispers, and Draco nods.
Harry sits at his usual table, Malfoy already there, and puts his bag on the table as he sits down and puts Teddy in his lap. Malfoy looks up from his textbook and frowns at Teddy for a second.
"I'm sure he's fine, Granger." He says as the common room door opens and Harry walks in. He notices Malfoy and Hermione sat together and just looks down, walking towards the stairs that lead to his dorm room.
"Not when it means I have to stop lying with a very attractive naked Draco." Harry mutters and Draco blushes a deep red.
Draco doesn't know if it's better or worse that Harry is still asleep when Weasley comes up to the dorm. He does know that the fact Harry is still lying on his lap makes it a whole lot more awkward though.
"I know."
"I think I'm gonna head to the library, but thank you, Seamus." Harry mumbles, and the two of them make their way out of the classroom before going their separate ways.
"I know." He says and she frowns.
"I have."
"Don't apologise. Is there something wrong? You wanna talk about it?" Harry knows he can talk to Draco, and he knows he should, but he feels guilty, piling all his shit onto him.
"I don't believe we've met." Harry interrupts him, and Brandon was obviously expecting Harry to stay quiet because it takes him a minute to comprehend what's happening.
"I have your Constellation tattooed on my back. Of course I have feelings for you, dumbass." Harry says and Draco smiles brightly before leaning down and connecting their lips. Harry feels actual sparks the second their lips touch and he wraps his arms around Dracos waist, Dracos right hand tangling itself in Harrys hair and his left hand resting above his constellation in the middle of Harry's back. When they finally pull apart for air Dracos eyes are shining brightly.
"Are you okay?" Harry whispers and Draco nods, too tired to form words.
"You need to sleep too, Draco."
"Harry I have been imagining you fucking me since I was 11." Draco blushes hard and Harry smirks.
"Hey Harry I'm gonna run into hogsmeade real quick, you want anything?" She asks, not even acknowledging the position the two boys are sat in. Harry looks over at her and smiles.
"Pomona mentioned you were out of it. Poppy said you had a visitor after lunch."
"Yeah well it looks better messy." He says, not trying to deny it because there's no point. Hermione grins at Harry and wraps her arm around his waist.
"Shit." He sighs, standing up, slightly wobbly from being asleep for 4 hours.
"It hurts. Surviving hurts. Living hurts. The guilt hurts. No one else got to choose. So many people died and they didn't get to come back." Harry's never told anyone this before and Draco can tell from the look in his eyes.
"Lie with me?" He asks and Draco blushes dark but lies down next to Harry. They both lie there looking up at the ceiling, Draco's blush a dark contrast against his pale skin, until Harry rolls onto his side so he can look at Draco.
"We can't have just one normal year at Hogwarts can we. Please say you're gonna help me." Harry asks and they both chuckle.
"What are you thinking?" Harry asks nervously and Seamus smirks.
"Do what?"
"Thank
"Thanks, see you later." He says, slightly awkward, and just as he's about to turn and go back to his table Blaise stops him.
They walk out of the common room and Harry explains his plan, which Hermione is all for. As they walk they chat casually and when they get near a student or group of students Harry lowers his voice and whispers a random name from their year or the year below or Hermione whispers 'really though? when people find out it's Justin he'll get questioned by everyone.' replacing the name with a different one every time.
"So Pettigrew knew when he ratted them out?" He asks and McGonagall sighs.
"I think I'm gonna head to my room guys." Harry says, briefly disturbing their conversation and Hermione frowns.
Just your bog standard fluffy chapter that makes your heart go aaaaaaah!!!
"She said we need to keep an eye on you." Blaise says and Harry sighs as they enter the potions class.
"Morning, Zabini." Harry replies just as Professor Slughorn starts the class. He tells the class what potion they need to make and lets them get started.
"What if she hates me?" Draco laughs, squeezing Harry's hand.
"You're always gonna have me." Draco whispers, and he means it. Even if Harry doesn't want him, as cheesy as it sounds, Draco's heart belongs to Harry, and there's nothing he can do about it. Harry shakes his head.
"But- what about your class?"
"I don't go that often either, and when I do Professor McGonagall makes me go with Hermione and Ron and she makes sure Hogsmeade is full of aurors. And we can only stay there for an hour before the crowd gets too excessive." Harry says before adding, "But it's Teddy's birthday and he's my godson. And your cousin." Draco sighs.
"He came to find me a few hours ago. He said he had a fight with Weasley and that he looked into his mind and saw what they thought and they had a fight about it. I took him to the Slytherin common room but he was sad so I wanted to cheer him up, and suggested a little 1v1 game. Well, it was the three of us so I guess 1v1v1." Blaise pauses to make sure McGonagall is okay with what he's saying, and when she nods he continues.
"I'm glad. I would have had no idea who to choose if you had said no." McGonagall says with a small grin.
"I can't." He says and his heart is racing and all he can think about is Fred and Sirius and Lupin and Hedwig and Dobby and Colin and there's screams in his head and before Hermione can say anything else Madam Pomfrey is rushing over.
"He's fine." Luna says, standing up and holding a hand out to Harry, who takes it and allows Luna to help him up.
"Since when? When did you decide you didn't hate me?" Harry asks and Draco rolls his eyes.
"So are you." Harry whispers, kissing the top of Draco's head.
"I did." He says and Draco mentally groans. Would Potter be willing to do his? Probably not.
"I'm afraid so." And he sounds genuine but Harry isn’t sure Draco is aware of how damaged he is. Of how hard it is to deal with him. How hard it is to love him.
"Draco, if you don't want to it's okay. I don't want you to say that just cause you think it's what I want to hear." Harry says, cupping Draco's face, his fingers brushing the bottom of Dracos hair and his thumb stroking his jaw.
