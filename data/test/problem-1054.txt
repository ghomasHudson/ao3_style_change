For a moment he just hugged the blonde then he realised what the last sentence meant. “Wait do you seriously had prank wars with your roommate?”
In one smooth motion, she walked over to the cabinet behind her desk and found a pepper-up potion.
“I don’t know, a lot happened that year. Bellatrix started to teach me occlumency.” Harry noticed that at the word ‘teach’ Draco grimaced, he wanted to press but knew that right now this was not the best course of action, so he let the blond finish. “My father also started to put more and more pressure on me. He wanted me to take the mark and I really didn’t want to do it. Severus started to get weirdly involved in my life. The whole summer was a disaster. I don’t really remember…” Draco trailed of which made Harry looked at him.
Black Lives Matter, so like don't interact if you think differently
“Draco can you please open, you are scaring me. You know I don’t want to hurt you. Open the door please.” She needed him to do it, she knew that in this state if he saw a wand there was no way of knowing what will happen.
“Boys it rather late, so I would appreciate if at least one of you get to the point.” She looked at them expectantly.
After he finally got his breathing back under control, Potter spoke again. “I couldn’t sleep because I need to go do some shopping and I really don’t want to deal will the crowds.” He pauses for a second as if to make sure that Draco is okay. “I managed to hide from all the press and all the people up to this point, but with going back to Hogwarts I’m afraid that my brief period of peace finally ended.”
The smile was driving Harry crazy. He couldn’t focus on anything that wasn’t Draco. Draco in his clothes, Draco specifically stealing his clothes for the holidays, maybe he will even wear one of his sweaters to the dinner at the Burrow. Once again the need to tell Draco about his crush arose. He couldn’t stop thinking about the hugs they shared. He knew that soon the image of them hugging won’t be enough for him. Draco was like a drug for him and during their newfound friendship somehow he got hooked. He needed to do something.
Suddenly a hand was on his right forearm, he didn’t notice when he moved it and started to scratch at the mark. The skin on his left forearm was red and the skin broke in few places. He looked at the blood with vacant eyes.
Silence filled the room and Harry started to feel nervous bring under Rosmerta stare, but then the witch smiled. “I forgive you, we all had our reasons for fighting in the war. I know how purebloods are brought up and you being a Malfoy couldn’t be any better. I hope you are better without them and seeing that you two are in a relationship I believe you are.” This tie Rosmerta looked at him and smiled, her smile was warm and Harry felt as his smile crept onto his face. “Now boys what can I get you?”
Harry was complaining the whole walk back to their apparation point. Draco thought that their trip was very successful, Harry had new trousers, new shirts, new shoes, new everything and he was very proud of the whole wardrobe change. Draco was sure that everyone at Hogwarts will appreciate the change and honestly the fact that Harry was still arguing about the fact that Draco told him that he lacks style is pretty amusing.
“Are you okay? I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.” Harry’s eyes lathed at him and he tried to stop the shiver that threatens to go through his body.
After the 6
“Well, then it’s the high time you watch one. I think you will like it. As for what you said about your family, they may be blood purists, but I believe that you quitted, or am I mistaken?” Harry's voice was playful and Draco hated that this made him defensive.
“What did you do?” He was expecting this question, but he had to admit that the fact that this was the first thing Ron asked still hurt a little.
Don't be an asshole and remember that trans people and non-binary people are valid and beautiful or handsome!
“And what happened to your clothes?” He could clearly see that Ron was annoyed at him for waking him up because of something like this.
“I…” Draco starts, but didn’t finished and Harry worries, but then he looks up and holds his free hand out to Neville. “I will help you, but I have a condition. We can discuss it later because I don’t everyone to see as Harry drags me away from here, but tomorrow we can discuss your plant and my condition. Now goodbye Neville.” When Harry looks at Neville the boy is basically jumping with excitement, he sees him nod, but after that, he is pushed forward by the blond Slytherin almost losing his footing and landing on the stone floor.
Together they walked inside the room and immediately Harry could see that Andromeda knew Draco more that he thought he did. The walls were covered in books, some muggles, some wizard. The desk stood near the window so that Draco could see the garden, Harry noticed that one book laid on the desk, from the title he gathered that it was about healing. Looking around he noticed the bed that had Slytherin green covers and the wardrobe. Although the room was small, Harry could see the happiness and excitement in Draco’s eyes.
Draco shifted his eyes and looked at the man sitting in front of him. Dr Bright looked at him, his mouth slightly open. He looked as if he didn’t expect this kind of outburst from him. To be honest, Draco didn’t expect to lose his temper like this either, but he was tired of people that didn’t know him telling him that he will never change, that he deserves to root.
“Don’t thank me yet. Your father really did a number on you, I need to redo the healing charm.”
Harry’s voice made him snap out of his train of thoughts. “So, how did I do?” Draco looked at him for a moment not comprehending. Harry gestured down to the paper that he still was holding.
He didn’t stop on his way to their table but he did slow down and let Harry catch up. When he felt Harry’s presents next to him, he smiled and kissed him on the cheek.
After a moment Draco smiled and tears appeared in his eyes. “Oh, Harry that would be amazing.” Suddenly Draco stood in front of him and kissed him.
The girl looked at him with a little frown. “What club?”
At these words, Harry noticed that McGonagall’s whole domineer changed. She looked at Draco and Harry could see that she was curious, impressed but also deeply worried.
“What a show mate!” He heard George shout. Harry felt as his cheeks redden, he wanted to flee but Draco took a hold of his hand and pulled him towards himself, making Harry land just next to Draco.
“I hate that you are right.” Draco looked at him and couldn’t hold his laughter anymore, the grimace on Harry’s face was comical.
He walked through the streets of Muggle London, his luggage at his side. He knew where he was going, but he wasn’t sure if he will be welcome.
“The I fancy an extremely pale person that has platinum hair, a personality that most people don’t like and captivating eyes.” He smiled when he saw the look on Ginny face slowly changing from one of anxiety to one of recognition.
“Andromeda invited me to spend holidays with her and Teddy.”
Draco scoffed. “There were rules. No pranking while one is asleep, nothing that would seriously harm the other and the most important one, no one can help you in your prank. The war is one on one not one on the whole house. There was also the unspeakable rule of nothing gross, but other than that everything’s one the table.” Harry smiled at Draco’s words.
Looking back from his potion book he noticed that Harry was also trying to study the subject, his eyebrows were furrowed and he wore a lost look on his face, which indicated that the boy had no idea what he was reading. Suddenly a brilliant idea came to his mind.
Still looking at the drawing he asked. “When did you do it?”
Today Draco promised that he will help Harry with the correct way of holding the knife and he hoped that this meant that Draco would get extremely close to him. He missed the blonde even though he was right next to him. Slowly he pulled back and looked at his boyfriend, the blonde was looking at him with a smile and a slightly wild look in his eyes and Harry knew that if they didn’t have any obligations they would be on their way to their room. He kissed Draco once again and stepped away from the blond. He smiled at the pout that the Slytherin gave him.
“Draco relax. Breath, in and out. You didn’t do anything wrong. Come on sit.”  He felt so pathetic but complied.
(See the end of the chapter for
After Andromeda left, everyone started to leave one by one and a half an hour later the two of them were left alone.
“I believe you.” He looked up, the man reached for his wand and Draco recoiled instantly. “I’m not going to hurt you, I promise. I going to heal your hand okay?” He didn’t know if he could trust the man, but his hand started to sting, slowly he nodded. The relief was instant. “I realise you don’t trust me, but I think you should find a therapist or someone who you can talk to.”
Draco smiled. “I love you too.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco could just nod his head and hope that this will end before he has a whole meltdown. “What about Hogwarts?” His voice was still raw, but at least the tears started to slow down.
With the corner of his eyes, he could see as Ron reached for his pillow and before Harry could do anything it landed on his face. He laughed and closed his eyes, this is going to be a good day.
The silence stretched and for a moment Harry thought that Draco will stay silent, but after what seemed like forever the blond finally spoke. “My parents. You know they weren’t great.” Draco’s voice was muffled by his pillow, but Harry knew that the boy needed some comfort and right now he couldn’t disturb him. “They told me a lot of things were bad and they punished me for even thinking about them. But at the gallery, the people in these paintings looked happy.”
“Andy, what did he said?” He knew that he shouldn’t be pushing, but he needed to know the full story.
Harry barely made it on time to the welcoming feast. He smiled when he noticed Teddy in the crowd of 1st-years. He watched as Minerva read the list of students pausing slightly at Teddy’s name.
“Oh, what do you propose?” Harry sounded curious and Draco took it as a good sign.
“What do you think?” harry asked with a smile.
“He made me swear never to tell anyone. At first, I wanted to argue with him, but he finally convinced me that if anyone else knew Lucius would most likely kill them before they could do anything with this information.” There was a pause, and he worried that Andromeda would cry again. “I think about this all the time. What if I helped him that day? Would I save him from the fate of becoming a Death Eater, would he be happy?”
New idea
Draco noticed that this brought Weasley’s attention, he looked up from the baby and glared at his friend, for a moment Draco was worried but when the redhead spoke he wanted to burst out with laughter. “Are you kidding me. Harry, you know that Hermione is helpless in the kitchen and the last time I tried to cook something ended up in flames. You cannot keep doing this, we cannot spend our whole money on taking out.”
I know that most of you are not interested in what is happening in Poland, but I want to ask for your help. You see for the last 5 years Poland had a very homophobic president, you may know him recently he said that LGBTQIA+ community are not people but an ideology, yes this is Polish president. He is also very anti-abortion and wants to make it illegal in Poland, even though Poland already has restrictions and abortion can be performed only in 3 instances, maybe you heard about Czarny Protest (Black Protest). Another thing is the fact that he basically outlawed sexual education meaning if you as a teacher teach about sexuality, anticonception, abortion, etc. you can go to jail for up to 3 years. So yeah this dude was reelected and before you say that Polish citizens are stupid it was mostly because this country still cannot separate government form church and this dude promised money to people as well as earlier he introduced benefits that are supposed to help but are in fact ruining our economy. All of this brings me to the reason for why I'm even writing it, I want to ask all of you that will read it to talk about this, to spread the info because right now Poland is one of the worst countries in Europe for LGBTQIA+ people (we have LGBT-free zones), it would also mean a lot if you spread positivity and send messages of support to LGBTQIA+ people in Poland. And if you are from Poland pamiętaj, że jesteś ważny i możesz coś zmienić. Wiem, że jest źle, bardzo źle, ale za 5 lat są wybory i może się wydawać, że to daleko, ale wiesz mi, tak nie jest. Za 5 lat więcej ludzi będzie po naszej stronie, więc proszę, nie poddawaj się i co najważniejsze nie daj im wygrać! ***** *** Nie będziemy siedzieć cicho!
Harry notices that Malfoy slightly flinches and moves away. Andromeda holds her hand in place and after a while, the boy slowly brings his cheek to her hand. He notices that Andromeda frowns.
A smile started to spread on Draco’s and Harry could feel his cheeks heat up. “If I knew that you appreciate my fashion sense so much I would have taken you shopping a long time ago. But honesty I would love to change your whole wardrobe and make you more presentable.”
He couldn’t remember the last time he felt this peaceful. The longer he stayed at Andromeda the freer he felt. He wanted to be happy, but the feeling of impending doom that he felt every day didn’t let him. The more comfortable he got with the idea of living without fear, the more he dreaded the day it will all end.
Before the blond could run away Harry grabbed his hand successfully holding him in place.
Hello,
“The Boy-Who-Lived-Twice is a cuddler, who would have thought. Just you wait till I tell Weasley and Granger or better maybe I will tell Neville.” Harry smile at the blond antics and hugged him tighter.
To be honest, Harry would be glad if Draco did it for him, but unfortunately, he knew that he had to do it. “Packing takes like half an hour. I don’t understand why I would do it a day before. What if I need something that I already packed? I bet you didn’t think about that.” He almost wanted to show Draco his tang but stopped himself knowing that the blond will most likely not even look up at him.
“Sir, yes, sir.” He watched as they sat on the grass and began to check their broom for any damage.
Draco knew that holding Harry’s hand was selfish, what if someone sees them and will give Harry problems. All the different scenarios kept popping up in his head, but still, he couldn’t let go of the comfort that this small gesture brought him.
The Slytherin looked up at him and locked his gorgeous grey eyes with Harry's green. He couldn’t describe how perfect Draco’s eyes were, not only grey but also silver could be seen in them.
“Okay, Mr Potter, show me what you got.”
“Okay”
Remember to wear a mask and wash your hands.
In many cases what pushed people into a breakdown is usually a small seemingly unimportant thing, unfortunately for Draco, it was the same. After coming back to his room, he spieled his quill onto his potion textbook and that was enough for him to break. All his frustration, insecurities and doubt came crashing and he couldn’t stop the tears. The only good thing about this situation was the fact that Harry was not in their room, he couldn’t imagine what would he do if Harry witnesses him crying once again.
please stay a little longer, I believe we have some things to discuss. I hope that this year will be full of friendship and that we will finally get rid of the prejudice that somehow is omnipresent in the school that was meant to accept all. Now have a good first night.”
Rosmerta looked at Draco then at him and finally after what felt like forever she nodded. “Very well follow me to the back.”
Walking through the forest with a purpose felt weird, all his life he never actually knew what to do in here, so the fact that now he actually knew where he is going seemed wrong. He tried to stay calm but the further he went the more nervous he felt. Maybe it was actually stupid, why is he suddenly behaving as reckless Gryffindor? He could feel the presence closer and closer, after what for him seemed like seconds but in real-world could be hours the shadow appeared in front of him.
“Yeah, I have the same problem. I suppose it has to do with growing up far away from the city or any kind of fumes. From what I remember Malfoy manor is located in a small village in Wiltshire so the air is much cleaner, just like at the Burrow.” He looked at Ron and smiled because this was exactly what he meant, he didn’t want to be rude, it just that he hates the city.
“Draco, I love you so much.” Harry hugged him tightly. “I would love to adopt a child with you.”
“Andy needs to go and Teddy has school tomorrow.”
A small smile appeared on Draco’s face as he sat nearer to the wall, opposite to Ron and next to him. Harry was aware that by sitting next to him Draco shows him that he isn’t going to run even if he wants to. This made him a little proud.
When he looked down Draco’s face was red and Harry was sure that this meant that Draco actually asked him this question. All he could choke out was yes.
Draco smiled as he watched Harry’s face reddening. “Thank you, Neville. Do you think that the potion will work on the advanced cases? I know that it worked with the shaking of my hands but it was a mild aftereffect.”
“Did you pay them to walk in front of us? Draco began to laugh at the question which did not put Harry’s nerves on ease.
This story will basically focus more on Harry and him coming to terms with the fact that somehow he became someone that he despises. When Draco decides to finally leave all the hate behind, Harry goes on a journey to not only find Draco and apologize but also to make sure that he himself changes and doesn't become the person he hates.
“I remember, but you were home at midnight.” Harry looked guilty, and Draco began to worry.
“Why aren’t you sleeping.” Before he could stop himself the words came out of his mouth. Shit. He could feel panic making its way to the front of his mind. Why did he say this? He was so stupid, he has to fix this before he starts having a full-blown panic attack. “I’m sorry, you don’t have to answer that, it was stupid of me to ask. I think I need to go.”
The look on Hermione’s face could be compared to wonder, but also something else. “I know that you are trying Draco, I really want to accept your apology not only because Harry is friends with you now, but it’s not enough  I need an explanation. You called me by a slur and I need to know why.”
When he looked at Harry once again the boy was laughing with him. “I will tell you a secret, you succeeded. I was so annoyed at you for this, but now I kinda find it funny. You were the only person that could rile me up like this.” After they composed Harry spoke once again. “I think we really need to go to sleep and maybe explore what else is in the room in the morning.”
“It’s important in order to see if you are a threat to other Hogwarts students.”
“Draco, you’re here.” He could feel the blond relax in his arms.
Reluctantly he let go of Harry’s hand and watched as the boy exited the room leaving him only with the new headmistress. He couldn’t find any words that would convey how sorry he was for the way he acted so he stayed silent waiting for the screaming to start.
This chapter describes Draco's childhood, so there is a mention of torture and child abuse. Stay safe and please if you cannot read this but want to know what happened, just comment and I will try to summarise it in a way that won't be triggering.
The End
“I didn’t want you to help me, Harry, I wanted to do this for you.” He watched the shocked expression that took over Harry’s face remembering that this was most likely the first time someone ever did something like this for the Boy-Who-Lived. “Also I’ve got you a present. I don’t know if you will like it, if not I understand and you can return it I won’t blame you. Anyway, here.” Quickly he took the present from behind the basket and held it towards Harry.
of February was never a priority on Draco’s list until now, he knew that the boy who lived most likely never had a Valentine day date and although Draco didn’t care about the holiday he wanted Harry to experience it. Asking for Andromeda’s help was getting easier and easier, she didn’t even question him when he asked if she could send him his favourite blanket.
Finally, he gathered his courage and with a shaky voice, he expressed his doubts. “Harry, do you realize that Weasley hates me?” He knew that his voice sounded strained, he felt his body tensed.
She opened the door wider, so he could get in. He didn’t know what to do. But the warmth radiating from the house was so inviting, and he couldn’t resist.
Harry couldn’t take his eyes away from the blond. Does this mean that he has a chance with Draco? Can he actually ever have a relationship with him? He couldn’t make this question disappear. Draco shifted next to him.
year.”  Draco knew that he shouldn’t find this particular thing funny, but he couldn’t stop the laugh that escaped him, when he finally composed himself enough to look at Harry he noticed that he boy was frowning a little. “I’m sorry it’s just I’ve been so petty and jealous of you that I decided to learn an advanced charm that I will probably never use again just to spite you.”
Since Draco’s promise of help, they spent even more time together and Harry wasn’t jealous. He just didn’t want Draco to leave him, ever. From what Draco told him, his cooperation with Neville was simple he helps with the production of the potion and in return, Draco will be the one to test it. Harry knew that Draco was tortured by his parents and the Death Eaters but he never knew about the damage that it left.
“Are you seriously going to take McGonagall’s proposition?” His voice sounded hopeful and Harry couldn’t help but smile at the blond.
in a bright coloured letter, at first he didn't understand, but when he lifted his eyes from the title to Harry his eyes caught on the painting that shows a woman wearing hijab with a big smile on her face, next to it is a painting of another woman this time in a black barque holing bright yellow lemons in hand that created a beautiful contrast from which Draco couldn't take his eyes away.
The moment in which Harry's heart went I wanna take care of this boy
Stay strong people and don't let assholes keep you down!!
Thank you for reading.
“I’m exhausted and I don’t want to go upstairs. Can I please use you as a body pillow?” Harry must have misheard because there was no way that this was the actual question that Draco just asked him.
Draco felt as a smile was slowly making its way on to his face.
Harry smiled and run towards what Draco assumed was the entry. Draco knew that he wouldn’t catch up to him, but nevertheless, he jogged towards Harry and together they entered. It was loud and crowded but also colourful and full of life and he hated and love it at the same time.
“Lucius dear, don’t you think this isn’t a proper way to talk to someone’s father?” He could see the smile that spread on Narcissa’s face.
Now for the promised summaries:
Draco froze, he couldn’t believe that the thing that kept Harry on edge for a week was a question concerning him. A warm feeling made its way from his stomach to his cheeks. He smiled and looked at the boy.
Hermione started to talk with Andromeda about some book at both of them read when Harry spoke. “I’m going to Andy’s tonight, so you’re on your own with dinner.”
From that point, Neville always sat next to them sometimes asking Draco questions connected with potions. The blond was extremely talented at potions which turned out to be a good thing since Slughorn preferred to let them work on their own which lead to explosions and melted caldrons.
Harry, his Harry choose to be seen with him, to be his friend. Draco wanted to hug him so badly, but he knew that he couldn't, at least not in front of everyone.
“Cuddle?” Harry smiled and adjusted next to Draco.
Without warming the spell that Draco’s carefree exterior out on him broke and Harry could only hear shouting. “How dare you laugh, you Death Eater scam. How can you parade here when the victims of your crimes will never again. You should be ashamed, you should be dead.” He couldn’t identify the voice, but the words that were spoked made his insides twist.
Harry thinks Draco is pretty, then does a risky move and thinks that he fucked up (Spoiled Alert! He didn't.).
Love you all!
“Can help you?” Draco couldn’t see Harry’s expression, but his voice was ice cold.
“What happened Draco? Can you tell me what’s going on?” she could see the blood slowly dripping on the floor? He was crying.
Harry was talking with Weasley and Granger about the teachers and what they think the arrangement with the dorms will look like. He tried to pay closer attention, but sitting so close to Harry was making it very hard to focus. He couldn’t take his eyes away from the boy, he remembered how soft his bird nest of hair was. He wanted to touch it again.
“Tell me Draco did someone ever tried to help you? Did some teacher ask why aren't you eating or why do you look as if you haven't slept in a week? We all saw how your last year here treated you and I’m not talking about help with the task you were given, I’m talking about a way out, about safety.” Draco was silent, Lucius always told him that asking for help was a weakness and he was punished for weakness, so no he never asked for help, but now thinking about it no one ever suggested to him that he could get out.
Draco simply nodded and once again walked to his bed, took his pyjama and walked to the toilet. He knew that he could change in the room, Harry wouldn’t judge him or make fun of the scars that permanently covered his body, but he still felt uncomfortable with the idea of showing them. Quickly he changed not looking in the mirror and lest the room. Harry was already laying under his covers, he made his way to his bed and lied down.
Draco watched as Harry blushed slightly. “I didn’t want her to see me in pyjamas at noon.” Draco looked at him and only just noticed that Harry was in fact in his pyjamas, patterned in small moving golden snitches.
After they ate, Draco washed the dishes and the two of them walked to the study where Harry placed the new couch and the TV.
When Hermione first heard about the idea she laughed at Harry, but after the initial shock worn off she convinced them to let her help with the preparation and with spreading of the news, which Harry knew that she was good at from the days of DA meetings. At first, he half expected her to try bully Draco into letting her co-teach, but when after the first class, during which Draco helped Hermione with perfecting one of the most complicated potions, she came to him and told him that she did learn something, he knew that she will let Draco do the teaching.
At this confession, even Hermione looked baffled. “You never had alcohol?”
When they stopped in front of the next painting he couldn’t breathe. It showed a couple, some would argue that it was nothing special, but for him, this painting was something he was never allowed. He can’t do anything but stare, McGonagall’s words burning in his mind “your parents told you that something that is a part of you or maybe something that you really wanted to try one day is wrong”. His parents told him that this was wrong, that he was filthy and if he was to become a hair he had to get rid of his weird fascinations. But now looking at this painting he couldn’t shake the feeling that they were wrong. When he looked to the right he noticed that the whole wall was dedicated to paintings with the same theme.
Instead of answering Harry laid Draco on the bed and before the blond could sit he laid next to him. “Harry?”
Draco exhaled loudly and smiled at Harry. “I love you too.” The kiss they shared was long and passionate. “Do you think we should tell the others or keep it a secret so they find out after the fact?”
Harry’s smile grown because of what Draco said because he did want to shout this from the top of the Astronomy Tower, but now that he was given permission the prospect of actually climbing all the stairs of the tower didn’t sound so appealing. Instead, he decided that from now on if Draco is okay with it he is going to be as tactile as he can.
Wear a mask, stay hydrated and keep on fighting!! <3
“I wanted to study but then the chosen one decided to actually open his bag.” The blond was smiling.
Please remember that the Native citizens are also fighting and also needs support.
OMG, they were roommates! Also if you cannot tell I'm a fan of the Marauders and now Hogwarts has Mr Black and Mr Potter once again.
Finally, Malfoy once again brakes the silence. “I’m – I can try.”  This time he sounds smaller as if he couldn’t believe that this is actually happening, as if he couldn’t believe that Harry is capable of putting their past behind them. Sure, Malfoy didn’t apologize yet, but Harry now understands a little better and he would never allow someone in need to suffer.
“You won and I won’t say it again.” Draco could just nod as the boy came closer. “Now come and help me to get rid of the feathers or you will be sleeping with a chicken.” Draco started to laugh at the comment.
Harry held his hand towards Draco and waited for the boy to take it. He closed his eyes and after a second he felt the weight of Draco’s and landed in his. Harry could feel warmth spreading over his body and with that he apparated.
Draco was happy, the four of them decided to spend their first summer after Hogwarts away from London. Even though he missed the busyness of London, the anonymity that Spain brought with itself felt amazing. The weather was sunny and hot making, it a perfect escape place.
“You want to look inside my head?” Draco’s voice sounded weird, it had an unnerving quality to it.
Draco looked at him and then at his bed and back at him. “I think I prefer the kitchen.”
“I don’t know who you are or what you lost in the war if you want to hurt me, punish me or make me pay, know that I won’t stop you, but whatever you do this won’t bring your loved ones back, this won’t help you trust me. I also need you to know that if you think that for a second I wanted to be in Voldemort’s service you are mistaken. You may not see it that way but there were victims on both sides of the war.” Harry watched as tears made their way down Draco’s face.
“What was the first?” Harry couldn’t stop himself from asking.
After the eventful dinner, Harry couldn’t wait for the New Year’s Eve. He was right to do so because the kiss they shared at midnight was mind-blowing and Harry just knew that it was one of many.
Harry could see the look of wonder on the blond’s face. He wanted to look away, but Draco took his hand and led him to the first bookcase.
Reluctantly he got off his bed, opened his drawers and started to put his things into his trunk looking for what was missing. After packing one-third of his belongings he looked up and saw that Draco was looking at him. The man looked proud and smug at the same time. He looked down and realised why Draco looked so pleased.
“What are you thinking about?” Potter’s tone was soft, he liked it. It was so unlike the tone that he used to use with Draco.
“If you want me to make a list of things I wasn’t allowed it would be way too long and I think it would take a lifetime to complete.” His tone was even but Harry could hear the bitterness.
Something changed and Ron’s words made her realize why she felt so weird. The boy in front of her did not look or behaved as the blood purist asshole she grew to hate. Suddenly she realized that she forgave him, but it’s gonna be a long way for them to become friends. “Ronald, this is not how you talk to people.” She turned to Draco and saw that he had a puzzled expression. “Just ignore him Draco. I must say that I did not expect a story like this, but I think I can understand. In a way your father made you associate pain with us. I’m sorry and I forgive you and before you ask I’m not doing it only for Harry’s sake. I genuinely want to get to know the real Draco.”
“Do you feel better?” His voice was still soft and Draco loved that he got to experience every possible Harry that there was.

As Harry began to feel asleep he imagined all the afternoons and night they could spend together like this after they moved in together. Who knew that the two of them would work so well together. Harry felt a smile appear on his face as he imagined how their new house. The future started to look promising after McGonagall proposed him a position of DADA professor. At first, he was hesitant since he had no experience, but after he sat down and discussed the proposition with Hermione, Ron and Draco the three of them managed to give him some very good arguments. Ron and Hermione knew that he was a good teacher since the DA times and Draco informed him that the rest of the professors, as well as the Headmistress, would help him if he needed it. Besides, if after a year Harry decides that he wants to stay he could study and prepare himself for the position better. Harry smiled and moved closer to the blond, with his left hand he covered them with a blanket and fell asleep for the first time he didn’t fear what the future held for him.
“And Harry, when you figure out why you want to dress nice for the ferret, don’t be afraid to talk about this with me or with Hermione.” He didn’t know what to say to this, but he felt a warmth growing in his chest.
“I’m sorry” Draco’s voice startled him.
When they arrived in front of the door Draco stopped and looked back at Harry, his expression was unreadable for a moment and then Harry saw a small smile appear on his face that quickly was replaced by worry.
With one move he hugged Andromeda, he felt as she wrapped her arms around him. “Thank you. This is the most one ever did for me. I can never repay you.”
I know that a lot is happening in the world and I don't want to minimalize anyone's struggle, but please take a second to learn about the horrible Polish government and please try to help.
Upon arriving in the Great Hall, hand in hand with Harry, Draco was expecting a lot of things, but he was not prepared for Neville Longbottom to run at him at full speed while holding a newspaper. Before he could comprehend what happened, Harry was helping him get up from the floor of the Great Hall.
“Not fair. Sometimes I have to write an essay.”
He eyed the ice cream subspecialty. “I don’t even know how this kinder something tastes how am I to compare the flavours?” Draco was confused if this tasted like something else shouldn’t he know the flavour of the original candy?
. For a moment Harry felt as if he blacked out. The only thing he saw was Draco dressed in all black with pants that hugged all the right places.
“5 minutes but isn’t the manor at least a few hours from here? Was he able to apparate when this happened?”
The blonde looked at him and Harry saw how exhausted he was, the storm of emotions that was today really took its toll on him. “I think I would much prefer to sleep.” Harry smiled hearing the scruffy voice that was tainted with exhaustion.
“As ready as I can be.” He knew that this wasn’t the answer Harry wanted, but at this point, this was the only one Draco could give him.
Draco didn’t know what she wanted to hear from him so he said the first thing that popped into his head. “I never asked for help.”

“Oh, Draco this is brilliant.” When he finally looked back at Harry the boy was smiling and still looking at the small package in his hand. “Help me put it on.”
For a moment the blonde looked afraid and then he answered the question, his voice was weak and Harry just wanted to pull him into his arms and never let go. “I always had the same dream, every night, no exception. I dreamed of a crossroad but no matter what road I took I always ended up at the crossroad.” Draco paused once again and looked at him. Their eyes met and Harry tried to hold his stare. “Then Voldemort came to the manor and my parents welcomed him. After a week or so the dream changed. There was something there with me, in the beginning, it was just there I could feel it but it didn’t really do anything. Then it started to get closer and closer and I started to run away, but I couldn’t.”
Draco seemed surprised, he didn’t speak for a moment and then a small smile appeared on his face. “Thank you, I think this was the second-best speech someone gave me.”
“Yes, Harry.” Draco exclaimed with a breathless after they parted once again.
“Yeah, I’m sorry. I just. Never mind. I’m going.” He hated that he sounded unsure, so unlike himself.
Black Lives Matter. Keep fighting, y'all are gonna change the world!!
Harry hated it, all the people that wanted to touch him, talk to him only because some prophecy said that he is the one that will kill the dark asshole. He thought that after seven years he would be used to all the attention, but it still made him uncomfortable. He felt as if his skin was crawling. Immediately after he left the train he was assaulted by a small army of people, he couldn’t even see Draco over the small crowd that gathered around him, but then all the people went silent and then the screams started.
Let me start by saying that Black Lives Matter always mattered and will always matter
“It has a protective charm inside, I wanted to give you something that would be useful.” Before he could continue Harry’s mouth was on his and the two of them were enveloped in a passionate kiss.
“Of course you can stay as long as you need Draco. But I have one condition.” At this both Harry and Malfoy look at Andromeda, he noted Malfoy just looks resigned as if he waited for an impossible demand to be placed on him.
Suddenly he felt movement from his right and upon looking there he realised that the transfiguration class ended and people started to pack. Quickly he reached for his bag when he heard McGonagall’s voice.
When he entered Draco was laying on his bed, face down. Harry didn’t know how to start this conversation but after a moment of contemplation, he decided that waiting is not going to do any good.
Stay safe and keep fighting.
A cough drove his attention away from the boy sitting next to him. He looked up and noticed that Hermione was looking at him and then a Draco. At first, he didn’t know what was wrong, but then he looked down and noticed that he was still holding Draco’s hand. He felt a blush making its way up his neck.
“Honestly Harry I don’t know. After everything that happened, I told him that if he ever needed a place to stay he could come here. He showed up a few minutes before you came. He looks like he barely holds it together. I think there’s something wrong.” Harry’s expression was unreadable and she hated the fact that these two boys that are so much alike are so cold to each other.
“See I told you, they are great.” When she looked at Harry he was wearing the biggest smile she ever saw on him and without realising she smiled too.
Then came the day when he was healed and Voldemort wasn’t in the Manor and Draco wanted to run, but his aunt came and dragged him to the ballroom where the golden trio was surrendered by Death Eaters. He knew what was going to happen and he couldn’t let Voldemort win, so he lied. And then he was punished for it and the worse thing was that he didn’t really care because maybe his lie gave Potter and his friends a chance at winning. Maybe finally he did something good.
Harry quickly looked at Draco, who still was talking with Hermione. “Should you be telling me this?”
Between constant visits to the library, studying, attending normal lessons, doing his school work and sleeping less and less Draco was going insane. He knew that he won’t be able to survive on only a few hours of sleep much longer, but Hermione and he still, after three weeks weren’t able to find anything like this in any book that was even slightly concerned with the topic of occlumency. Most of the night Draco felt like crying, he was aware that this could take time, but he was slowly going mad.  The days bleed together, every day looked the same, nothing was helping him and he knew that sooner or later the feeling of being trapped that was so familiar to him when he still was living in the Manor will come back.
In which McGonagall notices
The smile grew and Harry’s cheeks were slowly reddening. “Well I draw this on our second day back and I put it in your bag two days ago because I wanted to see how long it would take you to finally use any of your books.” Harry almost laugh seeing the mischievous glint in Draco’s eyes.
In two long steps, he was in front of Draco. He wrapped his hands around the boy, he could feel the shanking of Draco’s shoulders and he knew that he will make sure that no one will ever get the chance to hurt him. Carefully he shifted them so that they were laying on the bed, Draco’s head was pressed to Harry’s shoulder. Harry moved his free hand and started to rub Draco’s back making sure that the blond was comfortable.
“Maybe it needs to be a combination of two potions.” The suggestion was vague, and he was aware that he could help more, but he knew that Pandora wanted to develop the potion on her own. She only sought his help when she needed to test it or when she wasn't able to find anything useful in books.
Black Lives Matter and they always mattered, stay safe and keep fighting.
(See the end of the chapter for
After another moment of silence, Draco looked at him with fear in his eyes. “I… it’s complicated, I don’t know what is happening. My dreams they changed and I don’t know what is going on.” Harry wanted to say something, to ask what he means, what change, but then Draco spoke once again. “There was something there with me and it was closer, Harry. It was too close. I don’t know what it is I just know I can’t let it touch me.”
The man opened his mouth and most likely said something to him, but Draco was too anxious to understand him. After a moment the man understood that Draco was in no position to comprehend what was spoken to him and pointed at his door inviting him in.
Draco thought that he will never see Potter again, but the boy who lived showed up at his trial and thanks to him Draco and the fact that Draco did all of this to save his family. He took the mark so they would survive, no one knew that the family he so desperately wanted to save never existed in the first place, but he didn’t want people to know. They could send him to Azkaban if the truth comes up, couldn't they? So he didn’t say anything about the torture, about the beatings, the punishments and he asked Andromeda to keep quiet.
The witch looked at him with a sad expression. “For that I am sorry, I want you to know that you if you ever need anything can come to me at any time of day or night. But this is not all, I heard about your home situation. Your aunt let me know what happened and if I understand correctly you no longer wish to be addressed by your family name.” At this Draco nodded. “Very well, what name do you wish to be addressed by?”
“I’m sure that you remember that I also testify in favour of Draco. You see his home life wasn’t very good and it definitely didn’t change for the better.” He watched as Andromeda took a big breath and slowly exhaled the air. “When he was younger he somehow found out of my existence and showed up here, he was bleeding and almost all his body was covered with bruises. I asked him who did it, but of course, he didn’t tell me. I did the only thing I could and healed him, at least as much as I could. He was here for almost a week when his father showed up. There was so much fear in his eyes, Harry. It was horrible. Draco didn’t want to go, but Lucius only rose his cane, and he went silent. I didn’t want to leave him alone, so I heard every word that his bastard of a father said to him.” Her voice broke.
For a moment both of them were silent. Harry could see as Draco slowly thought about his proposition. Finally, the boy spoke, his voice was calm although harry could hear the emotions behind it. “I would like that.”  Draco sounded unsure and hopeful at the same time and Harry thought that this was a start.
“Yes, she did.” He answered the question and turned to the door where Harry was standing. “May I know why were you hiding from your employer?”
Harry approached Hermione and squatted next to her. “’ Mione we’re back for the children.” At his voice, Ron awoke and sat up on the sofa.
After a quick trip to the new dorm and a short chat with Hagrid during which Harry promised that he will visit next week, he all but run back towards The Great Hall. Draco wasn't there yet, so he tried the door, but it being closed, Harry started to pace the hallway. He knew that it was stupid and McGonagall would never be a threat but he couldn’t get Draco’s shaking form out of his head.
If you wanna see something really horrible this pride month I recommend you read about the policy of the Polish government towards LGBTQIA+ community. Please if you know someone in Poland that is a part of LGBTQIA+ community show them your support, show them that you see them and that they matter and that the Polish government cannot erase their existence. If you are from Poland I see you, I support you and stay strong.
“I love days like this.” The expression on the Slytherin's face was dreamy and Harry couldn’t resist it, he planted another kiss on the blond’s lips.
Draco looked at him from his expression Harry could read that somehow he managed to offend the blond. He smiled waiting for the rant hat Draco was about to deliver. “What’s so special? What’s so special? Harry this book is one of the most useful in the whole magic world. I can’t believe you. This book will most likely be my future, Harry.”
Harry looked at the boy in front of him and smiled a little. “Do you trust me Draco?” at first the Slytherin didn’t move, but after a second he gave him a small nod. “Then trust me when I tell you that your parents were and are wrong, there’s nothing wrong with you or with me. You can be yourself and you can be happy, please don’t let assholes tell you otherwise.”
“No, I’m not leaving you. I know that you don’t have a functioning quill and I also need one, if the shopkeepers want to behave like children then they also lose me as a client.” He hoped that the annoyance that he felt did not make its way into his voice. “We can just go shopping in muggle London.”
“If that is okay with you, I’m willing to try.” His voice is slightly different, a little tense.
Harry was laying on the sofa of Grimmauld Place, his eyes trained on the fireplace. Today Draco was coming back from one of his lectures, that focused on reversing advanced poisons and Harry was determined not to miss his arrival.
I'm writing the three last chapter, and after that, I'm going to start working on another fic. Thanks for reading!
Harry pulled slightly away, just enough to look at Draco’s face and with his thumb wiped the tears that escaped him. The raven-haired boy moved closer and rest his forehead on Draco’s. “Come on, we can cuddle.” Draco couldn’t answer him, too afraid that his voice would betray him, after a moment he slightly nodded his head hoping that it would be enough for Harry.
Please don't give up the world need people like you, people that are not afraid to be yourself and are not afraid to stand up to others.
Draco was slowly making his way down the stairs. He was dress in black long sleeves button-down shirt and black tight pants.
He made his way towards his two friends hoping that Draco will follow.
“I heard that you and miss Granger are looking into occlumency, may I ask why?” Draco looked surprised, he wondered how much he should tell her.
Immediately he knew that something is wrong, he jumped out of his bed and quickly made his way to Draco’s side. “Draco, wake up!” For a moment he thought that it worked because Draco stopped moving, but then the trashing came back and Harry was almost thrown off the bed. “Come on Draco. You have to wake up!” He really didn’t want to touch Draco in this state but soon it became clear that there may be no other way.
“What do you mean the dream changed?”
Hermione smiled and kissed her husband. “I’m pregnant and we would like Harry and Ginny to be the God-parents”
He wanted to argue but a vision of new sweets made him shut up. The ice cream was actually amazing, it was sweet but not overly sweet like Harry said they would be. When he looked up he noticed that Harry had an expectational look on his face.
“No, I don’t think it is” he felt as the cane was moved away from his face and then Draco was on the floor. His cheek pulsates with pain. He knew better than to scream.
“I’m okay, just missing Pansy and Blaise.” Harry kissed him.
The door on the opposite wall creaked and opened. Bellatrix stood in the doorway, but that wasn’t possible, right? Bellatrix was dead, she couldn’t do anything to him, not now and not ever again. He knew Bellatrix, she was crazy and her crazy was reflected on her face, but this person didn’t have the look, that hunted his nightmares. He could feel himself back up into the wall. The person was getting closer and Draco didn’t want to look, only pain will come if he misbehaves.
He watched as the man in front of his rose his brow looking unimpressed. “There’s only one way to find out what is missing Harry”
Oh, immediately Harry knew what Draco was talking about, the Dursleys also had a lot of opinions like that. They loved to loudly announce that people like him were sick, he stopped believing them when he found out that they fabricated his whole life, but Draco didn’t have this opportunity. He believed his parents, Harry wasn’t sure if  Draco was gay or bisexual but he knew what the boy needs to hear right now.
“Draco, I need you to tell me everything. I know that your father most likely did it and I understand that talking about this is hard but I need to know” Oh, great now he felt like he didn’t have a choice.
“I really don’t feel like eating. It’s just being back you know, I’m nervous.”
“Draco, this is a brilliant idea and you want to tutor the students.” This time he noted that Harry’s voice was soft once again.
“I’m sorry.” He hoped that Harry didn’t notice that his voice was breaking.
Rosmerta rose her hand to silence Draco. “I do not want to hear the pureblood Malfoy, what I want to hear is Draco.” For a moment Draco just looked at her, his right hand was holding his left forearm and by the way that his sleeve was looking Harry could see that the hold was tight.
“I knew you gonna like it.” Draco didn’t miss the happy tilt in Harry’s voice. “So, are you up for some clothes shopping or do you wanna go back to Andy’s?”
“Emm…” He looked up towards Draco and their eyes locked. Draco smiled at him encouragingly and tilted his head towards the door as if to let Harry know that he should talk with Ginny in private. “Yeah, okay. Let’s go.” Slowly he made his way towards the door expecting her to follow.
“Harry James Potter, next time you are taking care of the little nightmares. I seriously won’t be envying when they will finally attend Hogwarts.” Draco started to laugh at comment and Harry once again questioned if he wants to teach at Hogwarts when that happens.
“Remind me again, what’s the difference between frog and toad?” He smiled when Draco chuffed.
At first, Andromeda couldn’t believe her eyes when she saw her nephew on her doorstep. Another unbelievable thing was the fact that he was holding a suitcase. He was also rambling. She highly doubted that Draco would stay only a few days, but she knew that he didn’t have another place to go.
“Now I believe we have some things to discuss before you attend Hogwarts again. Firstly, when it comes to your accommodation, there is a new tower for the 8th year. Your rooms will be double and your roommate is already selected, there is also no possibility of changing your room or your roommate, understood?” McGonagall paused as a low disapproving murmur could be heard. When his classmates finally stopped the new headmistress begun again. “Additionally there is a separated table for you in the great hall. Secondly, I will not tolerate bullying, hexing or abuse of any kind. It doesn’t matter if the attacked person wasn’t fighting during the battle or was fighting on the wrong side. I don’t care what you think about the trials and the punishments, everyone is welcome in Hogwarts. This school is not only a source of hope, but it is also a home for the lost and the ones that need it. I will not allow for bullying of any kind. Of course, other students will also be informed of this. And finally, if you ever need help, no matter who you are and how unworthy you think you are, believe me, help will be given to these who ask." Draco looked at her and found McGonagall's eyes already locked on him. He wanted to show her that he understood, but all he could do was stare. Finally, he gave her a small nod and the headmistress continued. "Now I believe that there is a feast waiting for you and of course a speech needs to be given. Your carriages are outside the station. Welcome home.” With that, she spun around and disappeared.
Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off of him, a smile was spreading on his face.
“Draco, are you okay?” Harry’s voice broke the silence and Hermione could hear the concern that laced his voice.
“Magic.” The raven-haired boy only looked at him with furrowed brows.
“She wanted to know more about my sudden interest in occlumency and reminded me about the offer that she gave me at the beginning of the term.” He hoped that Harry understands what he wanted to say.
“Can you two be quiet, I have a sleepy Slytherin in my arms.”

Trans and no-binary people are valid, bi people are not cheaters, asexual people exist and there is nothing wrong with them in fact there are awesome!
Black Lives Matter, always did and will always matter. Support black creators.
“We need to go inside.” He could feel the reluctance in his voice and almost laugh at himself.
The prospect of safely spending the day in Hogsmeade without having to worry about their friends interrupting them or judging eyes of the other students sounded nice. “You can take me anywhere as long as we won’t be going to Madam Puddifoot's. I have nothing against pink, but this place screams enough.”
If you are from Poland remember you are a person, you are amazing and I see you and the fact that you are not giving up fills my heart with so much pride for you. Never give up, we are going to survive this! <3
Sleep took him almost imminently, one moment he was laying in his bed listening to Harry’s breathing and the next he was standing in the similar crossroad. Something was there he could feel it, it was closer than before. He remembers that when he first had this dream he would walk and walk for hours trying to find out where each of the four roads would take him. Each time he would end up back where he started and when he woke up he would be more exhausted than before he fell asleep. When Voldemort lived at the manor the dream changed, Draco could feel that he was no longer alone, something or someone was with him. He didn’t know whether this thing was looking for a way out or him. After a month of this, he knew that this thing took permanent residence in his dream, he could feel it getting closer and closer. One night after some Death Eater decided that testing his new curses on Draco was a great idea, he decided to wait for the presence. He knew that this was stupid but he was exhausted and at this point, he didn’t care if this will kill him or not. He sat in the middle of the crossroad waiting and even though he could feel the thing moving and coming closer to him, it never actually approached him. Now he knew that if he turned around he would be able to see the thing. Slowly he started to walk the opposite way. He could feel the thing coming closer and closer, he didn’t know when he started to run. Vaguely he could hear that someone was calling his name, but he couldn’t focus on the voice, he couldn’t stop running, he couldn’t let this thing catch him.
Teddy is going to school
Harry exaggerates his breathing hoping that Malfoy will follow. After a few minutes, he notices that the boy in front of him relaxes slightly. “Better?”
“It went good Hagrid. But we are not here to discuss the exams. You see little birdie told us that you are going to visit Madam Maxine this summer.”  Hagrid blushed at the mention of Madam Maxine, and Harry smiled at his friend. “Draco decided that you are in need of wardrobe change if you two are going to spend the holiday in Paris.” Harry started to full-on laugh when he saw the blush hut adored Hagrid’s face.
“I’m sorry. I should have done that. This was stupid, I don’t even know if you like men or me. I’m sorry.” Harry could feel tears appearing in his eyes. “Shit I will go.” His vision was blurry and the only sound he could hear was the beating of his heart.
Harry loved seeing Draco’s whole face lit up when he smiled and right now the boy looked lovely. Harry could feel his heart hammering in his chest. Draco’s voice startled him from his thoughts, when he looked at him he noticed that they were standing closer than he expected.
“Do you wanna play sometimes. I could be a Keeper if you want.” Draco smiled at him and kissed him again.
Andromeda helplessly watched as her nephew was convulsing on the bed. She knew that there was no other way of getting rid of the curse, the boy already suffered enough. After what seemed like forever his body slowly stopped moving and the wound started to close up. Harry stepped away from the unconscious boy, and she saw as her nephew faced became peaceful. She knew that it wasn’t over, the boy will need another round of spells in a few hours. She hoped that he will be still asleep for them.
Stay strong, wear a mask drink water and most importantly remember that you are valid and beautiful!
“Do you think you can win?” This time it was him who scoffed.
Harry has a very weird and eventful day.
Hello,
“If we go back who will save your atrocious wardrobe?” He knew that he bravura in his voice sounded fake, but at this point, he didn’t care. He wanted this day to be at least good.
Guess who is going back to school
He couldn’t chock out anything other than a barely audible yes.
“Oh, it’s nothing, Mr Black. I do not let my students be mistreated in any way.” While saying this McGonagall looked at the two ministry officials, her expression was cold and Harry knew that he would do anything to never be on the receiving end of this stare.
“Thanks, dad.” They smiled at each other.
He knew that Harry is going to look for some excuse, but recently spending time away from the raven-haired boy was becoming more and more difficult. He knew that now that they won’t be rooming together for two weeks their scheduled film/game night will resume, but it was still not enough.
“Oh, okay.” He stood up and held his hand to Teddy, a smile appeared on his face, when the boy didn't hesitate to take it. “Come on, time to say goodbye, Teddy.” He watched as the boy ran from one person to another saying his farewell.
McGonagall is my queen and this is the only summary you will need.
Hello,
So once again Black Lives Matter and they always matter. I will be writing this statement forever so get used to it.
Hello,
“It’s not like I already don’t know this stuff, so no harm is done.”
After the talk that he had with Harry Draco felt a little better. In a way, he always knew that what his parents told him was wrong, but he never thought that one day someone will actually tell him that. His entire life Draco thought that he was destined to be unhappy, he thought that marrying some pure blood which and producing an heir of his own was all that awaits him. He never imagined that he will be basically laying on Harry as the boy who lived tells him that he will never let anything happen to him.
to everyone's surprise, I post a chapter on the right day two times in a row. (The next one will be a day later because work)
“I don’t know if this is such a great idea.”
Their room was the last on the left, there was no keyhole and for a moment Harry was lost. He began to wonder if there was some sort of password that he forgot when Draco tap him on the shoulder. “The door handle has your magical signature inside, all you have to do is touch it.” The blonde didn’t sound condescending and Harry was grateful for it.
The situation in Belarus is awful, please talk about what is happening there and try to help in any way that you can.
“I won’t let anything happen to you.” He wasn’t sure whether the blond heard him, but he didn’t really care. This was a promise that he will keep no matter what.
Harry stepped closer to him and enveloped him in his arms. Draco could feel tears making their way down his face, he was very glad that Harry didn’t ask what happened. He knew that it was irrational, but the accumulation of his frustration usually leads to him breaking down over small things.
“Honestly, Harry. It’s like you don’t listen to your son. Toads generally have shorter legs as well as rougher and thicker skins. You have to spend more time with your son when he sits next to the pond. I seriously don’t know how the frog possession started, but I feel that this one isn’t going anywhere.”
The 8
He felt his heart skip a beat. “I don’t know if I’m allowed there.” When Harry looked at him questioningly Draco reluctantly complied. “The whole imperious thing.”
“Maybe I will. Oh, by the way, don’t call him Malfoy, he kind of told his parents to kill each other and he’s currently waiting for Lucius to disown him”
He smiled. “I'm not sure, yet. Maybe, I think it would be fun.” Harry leaned down and kissed him just as a loud crash came from outside.
“What is this?” He knew that his father would scold him for his childish behaviour, but for all, he cared his father could fuck off.
After dressing and making sure that his hair was perfectly styled he made his way downstairs, where Andromeda was already waiting for him with Teddy on her hip. He took his cousin and the three of them made their way to the fireplace.
“Today I realized that I have no casual clothes that fit me and I was wondering if you would want to help me find something that actually looks good on me” Harry watched Draco’s face closely waiting for any kind change on it, but his face stayed blank. “I mean you don’t have to, I just thought that since you clearly have a good fashion sense you could help.”
