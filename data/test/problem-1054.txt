Again, Draco kept his mouth shut, even though after what he’d heard from Harry he was fairly sure he knew exactly what Slughorn wanted Blaise for.
so much?” The unexpected rawness in Harry’s voice made Severus’ insides churn. Straight to the point, typical Gryffindor boldness.
And yet, did that truly ruin their trust in the headmaster completely? Severus felt decidedly conflicted.
Potter whirled around, eyes blazing, and Draco put on his best condescending smirk. They stared each other down for several long seconds, before Potter had the
Draco inhaled sharply, terror flitting over his features. Harry’s face betrayed no reaction at all, but he did reach out to Draco, taking his hand and giving it a squeeze. If Albus was surprised by that, he didn’t show it.
“Severus is injured, dining room,” was all Harry said before sending the stag off and turning his attention back to the table.
and figure out the plan as he went, only narrowly remembering to grab his wand for light. He all but flew down the stairs, making barely any noise, a skill honed by years of sneaking through the Manor way after his bedtime, ready to dash back to his room at the slightest hint of his parents. Upon reaching the ground floor, he slowed. He’d checked the drawing room upstairs for good measure and it had looked empty, but with Potter that didn’t necessarily mean anything, since he somehow managed to
“Angrier. I honestly expected you to tell me you never wanted to see me again. And I wouldn’t have blamed you for it either, what I did was reprehensible.”
The Dark Lord retreated from his mind and Severus relaxed marginally. It was a fleeting relief, because the next thing he knew was that he was thrown against the wall and bound by black ropes shooting from the Dark Lord’s wand. The look of wild insanity in those red eyes promised nothing good, and suddenly Severus found himself afraid for his life.
Harry instinctively glanced at Draco and their eyes met. The Draught of the Living Dead was easy for them. They’d both done it perfectly according to Severus’ standards. A smirk flitted over Draco’s lips, then he broke their eye-contact and began to sort his ingredients. Harry suppressed a wide grin and went to work as well.
Remus laughed. “As I said, I’m not entirely sure. I know that I’m attracted to you, that much is obvious I believe. I’d even dare to say that I like you, but there’s a fine line between friendship and romantic feelings. Sirius has been gone for not even two full months; I’d be lying if I told you that I am completely over losing him—again.” His eyes had turned incredibly sad as he spoke, and Severus felt a wave of affection for him. Remus blinked and seemed to come back to himself, then he looked back at Severus and asked, “What are
She shook her head again. “No, I do not. While I did grow up in a pure-blood household, I made certain acquaintances during my school years that thoroughly dismantled any blood-supremacist ideologies I’d picked up at home.”
“Yes, sir,” grumbled Harry, echoed by Draco, then he turned to his friends and added, “Sorry, guys, I’ll see you at the feast. Save me a seat?”
Harry woke up feeling well-rested for once. In fact, he was nearly sure he’d never slept so well before in his entire life. And not a single nightmare. Draco had stayed wrapped around him during the night and Harry couldn’t help but smile down at the sleeping blond, revelling in the heat that radiated from Draco’s naked chest. He shivered slightly as memories from the previous night came flooding back into his mind.
No sooner had he seen them, when Severus strode over to where Harry and Weasley were standing, his face a mask of cold fury. Draco couldn’t quite tell whether the emotion was real or not, but he relied on the assumption that it wasn’t. Either way, it didn’t bode well.
Draco paused this time to actually think about what Harry was asking. They’d have to tell them eventually, granted that they didn’t decide that this wasn’t working within the week, which Draco seriously doubted would happen considering their past few hours. Or the past few years, even. He liked Harry. He
Harry nodded, relieved. Severus was watching them closely, his eyes still burning with questions and undirected anger. Suddenly, Harry felt a wave of affection for the man. His father. His father who had yelled at him, but only to protect him. His father who had apologised without hesitation when he realised that he had hurt Harry. His father who hadn’t even heard yet what the Dursleys had done, but looked ready to murder someone, all on Harry’s behalf. His father who…cared.
He started by telling Draco again about never being given his own clothes and having to wear Dudley’s hand-me-downs despite them being way too big—he already knew about that. Then he told him how he hadn’t known when his birthday was for the longest time, because they only ever celebrated Dudley’s, never his, and how his Christmas presents usually consisted of tiny garbage items like paper-clips, while his cousin was drowning in presents. He told him about never being allowed to go on vacations with them, having to stay with Mrs Figg instead. He told him about all the little degrading things they’d done over the years to make him feel like he was worthless, like only calling him “boy” or “freak” and never his name, while praising Dudley to the moon and back. He told him how Dudley had bullied him, literally hunting and chasing him to use him as his personal punching bag.
Narcissa looked at him thoughtfully. “I can barely believe that, but I have to admit that he is acting very unusual and it doesn’t match his previous behaviour at all. Have you tried to talk to him again since?”
The spell was remarkably effective, not only closing the wound but also pulling at least some of the blood back into Severus’ body. Within mere minutes, there was nothing but fine, white scars left of the horrible gashes. When Harry was satisfied, he looked back at Severus’ face, only to see that his eyes were closed again and— Was he still breathing?
A few minutes later, Kreacher had picked up the countless bags of clothing and they left Twilfitt and Tatting’s behind, strolling down Diagon Alley in the mild evening sun. Draco was pleased with himself. If nothing else, at least Harry had proper clothes now. And two Lordships.
“I’m a light sleeper. Something must’ve woken me up,” he responded nonchalantly, examining his fingernails as if there was nothing of interest going on.
As soon as Narcissa and Draco had said the words, a link formed between their cores. It was a thick thread of light, glowing so bright that its colour was barely perceptible. Harry thought it was green, or maybe blue. It was really very difficult to tell.
Potter didn’t talk to him at dinner. He didn’t talk to him the next day either, or the next. Instead, he ate silently, the tension between him and Severus so thick you could’ve cut the air with a knife. As soon as his plate was empty Potter disappeared immediately after each meal, avoiding to talk to anyone at all—save for Lupin, who had the privilege to be allowed to visit Potter’s room. If Potter was there in the first place.
And, yes, maybe he was treating it all too lightly, but he knew that if he were to really stop and think about the war ahead and the things he’d have to do sooner or later, he’d probably lose his mind. There was no time for such things anymore, not for him. Not for the sodding Chosen One. He knew what he had to do, there was no other option, and he’d accepted that. It really
Harry nodded, seemingly satisfied with Severus’ answers. Still, Severus hesitated. Surely Harry wouldn’t let that go so easily.
Harry pulled his knees to his chest and wrapped his arms around them, rolling himself into a tight ball.
Severus’ face was frozen in surprise for a second, before turning into a sneer, as his eyes flew back to Draco, then to Harry again.
since he’d arrived at Grimmauld Place. Not that Potter addressed him by name a lot in the first place, but the few times Draco had heard his first name out of Potter’s mouth, it had made his breath hitch. Anger flared up in Draco’s stomach and his eyes flashed as he drew his wand.
“Alright, alright,” Harry laughed. “Still, I’m sorry. For being here. I just know that Sirius and James used to be with you during full moons, and I didn’t want to leave you all by yourself. If you want me to leave, I can go. Just, er, I don’t know, tap your paw on the floor if you want me to go?”
For some reason, that hurt more than the fact that Snape himself hated him. For almost sixteen years, Harry had built an image of James—
“An incredibly dark spell, openly accessible to anyone who found this book, without any explanation whatsoever. Without the counter-curse.” Severus exhaled slowly. “Thank Merlin it was
His entire self-image had been shattered that day. His father hadn’t cared one bit. Instead, he’d told Draco that he was disappointed for coming in second-best after a mudblood. Draco had turned his self-hatred against Potter for rejecting him, and against Potter’s friends out of jealousy.
As the feeling of contentment ebbed away, his brain caught up on what exactly she’d said. “How did that conversation remind you of Harry’s relatives?”
Pansy huffed and rolled her eyes. She gave Draco her best “are you sure you want to risk doing that” look, and he threw his arms up in defeat.
Harry’s mind was racing in circles. Malfoy was supposed to become a Death Eater. His mother clearly did not want that to happen, but what about him? Did
Harry’s jaw tensed. “Right. Except that his secrecy led to me walking right into Voldemort’s trap and getting Sirius killed. Forgive me if I’m not the biggest fan of not being told things anymore.”
Snape’s eyes flew up when Harry addressed him directly, betraying a hint of surprise, quickly giving way to irritation. Harry glared back at him.
It was on one such evening that the idea of Remus supervising the DA came up. Harry had been devising lesson plans for weeks already, including anything he considered potentially helpful during the upcoming war. Remus’ training had long since exceeded the limits of what was taught at Hogwarts, especially since Severus had joined them as well, teaching Harry spells that ranged much further into the dark arts than Remus’ curriculum had. He didn’t particularly like the idea of using such violent spells, but Harry knew that in order to have a chance at winning this war he had to use any means available to him. So he accepted the instruction and learnt the spells. The only time he balked was when Severus wanted him to learn Sectumsempra—the curse that had almost killed him all those weeks ago. Eventually, he had relented with a frown and shot the spell against a tree, tearing deep gashes into the bark. No spells like that were ever considered for the DA. He stuck to Remus’ teachings for that, hence why he wanted Remus to come and supervise.
“They’re invisible,” said Luna matter-of-factly. “They fly into your head and make your brain go fuzzy. Everyone has them sometimes, but you used to be surrounded by them—now you’re not anymore.”
“Alright, Harry, I’ll take your word for it. Just— Be careful, please. I don’t like the thought of you messing with evil things like that.”
“And you’re seriously trying to tell us that she— that you—” Mrs Weasley gestured between Severus and Harry.
Blaise arched an eyebrow at him, pointedly looking at the notebook in his hands. Draco held his gaze, keeping his face neutral. It was easier than it had been back at Grimmauld Place. Lying. So much easier. For a moment Draco wondered whether that meant that he didn’t care for Blaise, but he dismissed the thought as quickly as it came. Of course he cared for Blaise, they were best friends. But their dynamic had always included their masks—they both accepted that occasionally lying to each other was just a part of their lives, of their assigned parts to play in society. Their trust was based upon the fact that none of their lies would endager their friendship, and Draco intended to uphold that trust. He’d never lie to Blaise about something that was directly relevant to the two of them.
“I know this is a rather difficult situation for you, but can we at least talk about this?” he asked gently, eyes pleading.
“One more thing,” said Harry. Draco turned to face him again, opening his mouth to ask what when Harry cut him off with another kiss. Draco immediately melted into it, letting out a small whine when Harry pulled back again. Instinctively, he wrapped a hand around the back of Harry’s neck, keeping him close—just one more second.
for Draco to touch him. It was that he feared Draco’s reaction to what his fingers would find on his back, the consequences it might bring.
But the main reason for Harry’s astonishment was the right side of the room. While there was still plenty of open space to practice in the left half, the right half of the room was covered in a fully formed landscape. Uneven, earthy ground with several trees, stumps, big and small rocks, and even a narrow stream of water that originated from what looked like a slightly elevated cave. It was
Remus barely managed to raise a shield in time for Harry’s first attack. Not a stunner, a Reducto. Good to know that the boy still had enough faith in Remus’ abilities to trust him to deflect such a spell aimed directly at his ribcage. Firing back, Remus took two steps to the side, partially hiding behind a tree. Harry evaded the spells instead of blocking them, his steps as secure as they had been after weeks of fighting at Grimmauld Place. Yet the terrain
Draco nodded and Harry dropped a final kiss to his lips before quickly slipping out of the changing room. Hermione eyed him suspiciously as he took his place on a stool beside her, but nobody commented on his apparent tardiness. Draco didn’t emerge immediately and when he finally did, he ignored them completely, paying swiftly for his robes and exiting the shop without a single word, Narcissa joining him at the door where she’d been waiting for him. Neither of them even looked at Harry.
“I believe he mentioned renaming it to Defence Association, so it can keep ‘DA’ as its shorthand. Was that all you needed? I was about to leave in order to help Filch at the gate.”
“Well, for one my previous treatment of him. Unfortunately, there is no better explanation than the fact that these charms made him look and act and sound exactly like James Potter, and my old resentment for his would-be father got the better of me. I have no excuse. Still, I want to explain it. Then there’s how I’ve treated his classmates, which is a bit more complicated. There are specific reasons for some of them, but there’s also the simple fact that I was always aware that the Dark Lord would eventually return and Albus would want me to return to my position as a spy. Better to have a reputation for favouring pure-blood Slytherins and bullying muggleborns and children of former Order members.”
“Sorry,” he murmured, playing lightly with Draco’s fingers, “it’s just, uh, I’ve never actually— Well, I’ve never been with a guy before. Or a girl, although I at least kissed a girl once, which was rather horrible to be honest, but I guess that was more due to circumstance and— I should stop talking.” Harry took a deep breath, as if to steady himself. “I—” He trailed off, seemingly lost for words, but Draco thought he understood. He mirrored Harry’s actions by pressing a soft kiss to Harry’s hand before he spoke.
Remus smiled at him, breaking off another piece of his chocolate bar and popping it into his mouth, before holding the bar up to Severus.
The sound conjured images that made Draco’s breath hitch. Memories of smooth skin and half-lidded eyes, and it was more instinct than choice to lean down and cover Harry’s mouth with a kiss.
Draco smiled — or, well, he would’ve smiled if he’d been able to — and hollowed his cheeks, sucking. Harry’s reaction was beautiful, even if the jerk of his hips almost made Draco gag — the sound was worth it. Gods, he could get addicted to this.
“Thank you, I’m glad they turned out well. I’m afraid I don’t have a lot of practice in the kitchen since the house-elves usually took care of meals at the Manor.”
He opened his mouth to speak, but found himself at a loss of what to say. Potter just smiled and nodded, somehow seemingly reading Draco’s mind.
“I like you, too,” he said softly, and Draco wished he could capture that sentence out of Harry’s mouth and bottle it, just so he could keep it with him all the time. Pulling Harry down, Draco kissed him again, and for a few minutes they were both too distracted to continue their conversation.
“No, it isn’t, you’re right. So, let’s say I stunned someone and then levitated them off a cliff to kill them. Is it a dark spell now? Is the stunner a dark spell, too?”
His friends nodded solemnly, but neither said anything. Silence settled over them once more, and the antsy feeling returned to Harry’s legs.
He only nodded in response and sat down at the table. If he was lucky, he could eat and disappear again before anyone else came down. Narcissa would leave him alone at least.
They cuddled in silence for a long while, until his mother’s chiming charm called them down for dinner. Noticing Severus’ empty seat upon their arrival, Draco scowled. If they had patched things up, why wouldn’t Severus join them for dinner?
“To ensure his position as our spy, to gain Voldemort’s trust completely, and to ensure that nobody else has to suffer the task of killing me—if he hadn’t gotten away, this task would’ve fallen to Mr Malfoy,” Albus explained.
“Right, because that would’ve been such a realistic scenario,” Draco said with a dejected sigh. An uncomfortable weight settled in his stomach. “Don’t you remember what I told you? Even though I haven’t agreed with my father’s views in a long time, I still felt compelled to keep up appearances. You said it yourself: I was a right git to you. My father would’ve made me regret it otherwise.”
“So, what’s the big secret of those ‘lessons’?” asked Draco, sinking one hand into Harry’s hair and massaging his scalp.
“We have the French Malfoy estates—” Draco began, but Severus cut him off, “No, the Dark Lord already has too many people inside the Ministry. If you leave the country it’ll be too obvious that you’re fleeing from him. Outright desertion won’t go unpunished. It’d be best if you just disappeared upon your return from school, possibly with the excuse that without Lucius, you didn’t feel like the Manor was your home any longer—we’ll come up with something if you ever get into the situation of having to explain in the first place.”
ehehe, so here’s the chapter that changed the rating for this fic from Mature to Explicit. It’s my first go at writing smut, so I hope it’s … satisfying?
They were standing awfully close to each other now, close enough for Remus to feel the heat radiating off Severus’ body. It wasn’t even close to the full moon, why was he so sensitive? Their eyes locked, and Remus felt
Snape snorted at that, earning a raised eyebrow from Harry. Narcissa was visibly relieved and began thanking Harry repeatedly, causing him to blush a little.
For a moment, Harry just stared in awe, before remembering why they were doing this in the first place. He refocused his attention on Narcissa and motioned for her to continue her explanations.
Remus stood back and watched as Harry demonstrated the spell, gave a quick explanation and then went off to form groups, always pairing a couple of younger with some older students and mixing houses wildly. The first groups were already starting when he was barely half done.
“I don’t know, Harry, but I’m sure there’s an explanation for this. Just try talking to him again tomorrow, after your lesson.”
It wasn’t entirely true. While being there for Harry was important to him, the Wolfsbane potion would also make his transformation a thousand times more bearable than without it.
“Don’t get cocky, cub, I might put you on your arse yet,” he replied, even as he went for the high ground, accepting Harry’s offer. The boy’s confidence was not unfounded after all, and at this point Remus would take any advantage against him he could get.
Harry laughed softly, and it soothed Remus down to the core. Without even a trace of fear in his eyes, his cub snuggled into him as if he was nothing but a big dog, rather than a monster.
The energy between them changed in a heartbeat, and Severus felt his whole body tense in anticipation as Remus came to stand above him. He leaned down, one hand on Severus’ jaw, his lips hovering close enough before Severus’ that they were breathing the same air. The tension mounted until it became unbearable and Severus closed the distance.
She seemed to struggle with herself for a moment, before glancing at Snape. “Severus,” she said softly, causing the man to wince, “you can’t tell me you don’t see it.”
“Oh, right! Which one did you want to look at specifically? I wouldn’t want to drop all of them on you, you’d be buried.”
“You’re welcome,” she said with a smile, then got up, setting her wineglass down on the coffee table and turned to leave.
“I would ask Albus to find another way, if possible. But there are things my position demands of me that I won’t be able to avoid.”
“One moment, Mr Potter, I will give you the official record of your complete inheritances. All it takes is a signature and a drop of your blood on the official documents to formalise your acceptance of the position as the head of house Black.”
“You better,” grinned George as they returned to the main room of the shop. “Still seeing your Slytherin?”
“He’s…dealing. It’s getting better, I think.” Remus ran a hand through his hair, trying to find the right words to describe Harry’s state of mind. “In the beginning, he disappeared somewhere in the house almost all day—Merlin knows where, I swear I checked every room the first day. But then, after a few days, he started to wander around the house, never really staying in one place too long, although he did disappear again sometimes in between. I honestly see him in the hallway more than anywhere else, apart from when I go to his room in the evening to talk a bit.”
“Of course I forgive you,” he said. Relief flashed on her face and she smiled again, more genuinely this time.
When Draco saw his own gift floating over to them, he tensed slightly. Harry must’ve noticed, because he shot him a quick smile before starting to remove the wrapping. He had debated the gift for quite a while, even after he’d already settled on giving Harry the bracelet. The choice had been between Quidditch, healing and defence, and Draco had laboured over the decision for days. In the end, he’d picked healing, because it was the thing least likely to be covered by other people’s gifts, but he’d refused to settle for something as simple as a book—partially at least.
To be honest: That one was a pain to write. For some reason conversations just didn’t sit right and I’m still not sure if I’m entirely happy with it. There were so many things I could’ve put in here, but none of it felt quite right, so I didn’t. Perhaps it’s just that the atmosphere of it got to me, because I imagine sitting there with Dumbledore to be rather uncomfortable for everyone, given the current situation. Either way, there it is, hopefully the next one is a little lighter.
Harry, who’d broken off mid-sentence at the sudden movement beneath his feet, blinked twice, then shook his head with a smile and continued, “Okay, uh— Where was I? Right — the main purpose of the DA is simple: learning how to defend yourself. With an active war going on, a little extra practice in defensive spells and strategies can’t hurt. Being able to duel properly and holding your own in a fight might very well save your life in the near future.”
“Well, last year we used the Room of Requirement and the room’s abilities were quite useful at times. I was planning on doing it there again.”
Severus watched stone-faced as Potter bolted from the kitchen. Although he was loath to admit it, he wished he could do the same. Wished he could avoid the undoubtedly unpleasant conversation that was bound to unfold.
Nobody argued. Instead, they followed him down the stairs and to the library, where the door was still closed. Harry didn’t knock.
Hermione could, of course. Harry considered raising his hand, now that he was finally able to answer questions in this subject, but Hermione’s excitement at seeing—and more importantly, smelling—Amortentia made him decide against it. He’d already smelled the potion when they’d practiced it at Grimmauld Place—he already knew it smelled like broom polish, treacle tart and
“So, we’re dating? We’re exclusive?” Draco asked. He had to be sure. Harry’s eyebrows shot up, then a shadow of anxiety flickered over his face.
Satisfaction swept through Remus and he didn’t even fight the grin that spread on his face. “Do I want to know how you did it?”
known him all his life. Him and his father had been friends back at school, despite being several years apart. They must have been rather close, for his father to name Severus his godfather, but whenever he asked, both of his parents evaded his questions.
Draco and him spent most of their time together, knowing that soon they wouldn’t get many chances to just
“Missed you,” Harry murmured against his lips, kissing him again before he even had a chance to answer. Draco moaned when Harry caught his lower lip between his teeth, pulling slightly before letting go again.
Draco put the journal away, feeling somewhat melancholic. Gods, they were ridiculous. It hadn’t even been a day.
“Of course you did,” Narcissa allowed with an exasperated sigh. “And now you don’t anymore, splendid. I see the way you look at him, the way he looks at you, you’re both completely in over your heads.”
“Lucius Malfoy’s actions have nothing to do with Draco and Narcissa and neither of them is a Death Eater. Voldemort—” Everyone, including Draco, flinched at the name. “—had plans to force Draco to take the Mark, so they fled their home. Dumbledore has promised them protection.”
Severus looked up at her, surprised at the offer. Minerva was usually rather particular about what sort of detention she gave for which types of misdeeds.
Feeling dizzy, he sank down onto the bed. He couldn’t grasp a clear thought, it was all too much. Who would put such charms on him? And why?
“Fascinating,” murmured Dumbledore, then continued at normal volume, “Well, it seems that fortune is with us — you have a natural talent for Legilimency; no doubt you got it from Severus, he is rather good at it as well. That spares us months of effort to teach you just the basic spell and we can move on directly to the actual work: learning how to break through a well-built barrier that shields a defended mind. You will cast the spell again and I will give you ample time to find firm footing in my mind. Then, I will push you out — you should try your best to prevent me from succeeding.”
Draco exhaled slowly. It was a lot to digest, but not necessarily because it was about the Dark Lord.
Harry laughed at the cacophony of voices, holding his hands up to silence them. It took a while for the chatter and excitement to calm down, by which time Harry and Remus had returned to the little platform in front of the blackboard.
“He told me he didn’t ask for my company and I should leave. When I asked him about our Occlumency lesson he answered that tomorrow would suffice and I should meet him in the library for it. Then he slammed the door in my face.”
Lupin eventually saved him from his never ending thought spiral. “How about you stay here for now, Severus? There are plenty of rooms that are still free. I doubt that Harry will be ready to talk before tomorrow if he hasn’t reemerged by now.” He sighed heavily. “And I’ll talk to him. I’ll tell him how close you and Lily were. He’ll come around.”
Draco wished he could see Harry’s face, as the Gryffindor huffed in mock annoyance, clearly embarrassed. He laughed softly, but was cut off by Harry suddenly pushing him onto his back, hovering above him.
Grief threatened to swallow him whole. He tried to ground himself by digging his nails into his forearm, with mediocre success. Still, he managed to breathe again and forced himself to focus on his surroundings. He still needed to find his glasses.
For a moment, there was an awkward silence in the room. Harry hoped Severus would just do as he usually did and simply walk out. He should’ve known inviting him into his rooms would backfire somehow.
his mind supplied. Albus happened. Albus had allowed Harry to stay in an abusive home for eleven years, had allowed Harry to go off on reckless adventures far too dangerous for a boy his age, probably all in the name of preparing him to eventually fight the Dark Lord. Severus felt his barely subdued anger bubble up again.
Draco smiled at the thought and fished his notebook out of his bag. It was warm. His heart skipped a beat as giddy excitement bubbled up in him and he quickly flipped the book open.
After three days, Draco’s frustration with Potter’s downtrodden mood got the better of him, and he threw a mild stinging-hex at Potter just before the Gryffindor could slip into his bedroom.
“I doubt that he will,” Remus said. “He’s warming up to you, I think. At least that’s what it looks like from my perspective. It might be slow, but it’s happening. And after what you told me of your conversation from last Sunday, he’s willing to forgive you, he just needs some time.”
, because I don’t know what to think. I’m kinda growing to like him, and I guess I’ve forgiven him for most of our history, but I’m not sure if any of it is happening for the right reasons. Or what the right reasons even are. And it all confuses me to no end, but I thought I had time to figure it out, except he almost
“The month after was both better and worse than most at the same time. Dudley was so scared of me that he left me alone completely. Vernon, however, seemed to think that he had to fit the punishment of an entire year into that month. But I had something to look forward to, so I made it through. I’ve only been back for the summer holidays since, and Ron and Hermione always sent me food so I wouldn’t be too hungry, so it wasn’t that bad. I mean, maybe apart from that first summer, when Dobby levitated a cake through the living room and they put bars on my windows and fed me through a cat flap. Ron and the twins broke me out with a flying car.” He laughed softly at the memory.
“He’s gay, for Merlin’s sake!” Lupin snapped. His amusement disappeared abruptly, replaced by immense grief. “Was gay, I mean. Not that it’s any of your business.”
Harry opened his mouth to tell Hermione about Severus’ tips, when his eyes fell on the note scribbled next to it; it said to crush the bean, rather than cutting it.
Fred laughed and put up his hands defensively. “Don’t worry, just making sure. So, we don’t hate Malfoy anymore?”
Harry suggested one more round, but Remus refused, claiming that Harry had to watch his strength more carefully.
This, however, was not such a case. This was about Harry, it had nothing to do with Blaise. And even if it did, if there was anyone more important to Draco than his best friends it was Harry. He’d lie his head off for Harry—though he doubted that Harry would ever put him in a situation that’d force him to lie to Blaise in a way that would betray his trust.
was suddenly visible. Draco felt himself thrown back onto the Quidditch pitch, the only other time in which Harry wore such form-fitting clothing. No wonder Draco had always lost those matches, it was impossible to focus like this. And now he was
“Molly, he can’t be,” Minerva cut in. “Harry’s magical signature shows no signs of any creature magic. It would be unmistakable.”
Ron squirmed a little, but eventually gave Harry a defeated nod, saying, “Alright, alright. Message received, the ferret is here to stay. But I stand with it: I won’t hang out with Malfoy for you.”
But Harry just shook his head mutely, eyeing the scroll as if it was cursed. Draco’s mother sighed and moved to stand in front of Harry, looking up at him, as he stood at least a head taller than her. Still, Harry seemed tiny in this moment, his expression looking like he was completely lost.
It made sense though, in a rather cruel way. Of course family was the one thing Harry would be hopelessly insecure about. Of course the thought of truly belonging was so foreign to him that he just
Instead, he watched the reactions on the faces of the audience. Many of them looked scared, particularly the younger years, but some wore expressions of grim determination or even hints of enthusiasm. Remus noted that even the seventh year students had come, apparently willing to learn from Harry despite technically being a year ahead of him. For a moment, he wondered how many of them were here simply to get a look at the Chosen One, and whether Harry had considered that aspect when he’d decided to continue the DA. Remus knew the stares and the gossip bothered him, but had he anticipated it to this extent? Would he even have realised that he’d give any groupies the perfect opportunity to come gawking?
Draco gave him an irritated glare, but his expression quickly morphed into one of delight. He jumped up excitedly and shrieked, “You used it! Did it work? Did you like the smell? Is there anything you’d want to change?”
The hallway was completely silent. For a moment he wondered where the hell everyone had gone. On second thought, though, he decided he didn’t care, so long as they weren’t between him and his room.
“What do you think?” he asked idly, as he strolled to stand in front of the large mirror in the fitting area.
Harry continued to stir his potion until Slughorn clapped his hands and called, “Time’s up, everyone stop stirring, please!”
to know him right now—he only knew how to rile him up. That dynamic, however, he was intimately familiar with. A semblance of calm washed through him, as he yielded to what he knew best.
“Give it a rest, Mum, it’s just a snake. I’ve got a friend who has a Boomslang and it would never hurt him, and he isn’t even a Parselmouth.”
“I might not like him, no, but anyone with a brain can see that Harry is happy with him, and isn’t that what matters?”
He explained about the cupboard, about how they’d lock him in there for days on end sometimes, without food. He told Draco how he’d generally never been allowed to eat what he wanted, even though he had been the one cooking the food most of the time, ever since he was still very little. He remembered how he had burned himself on the stove because he was too small to reach up properly.
It was too much and not enough all at once. Harry let out a desperate noise, his free hand reaching down between their bodies as well, grasping Draco’s hard length through his pyjama pants. Draco choked on air as Harry’s fingers tightened and his palm rubbed downwards. All of a sudden, Draco’s fingers flew up to the edge of Harry’s pants again, dipping inside the tiniest bit as silver eyes looked up at Harry, hesitant, questioning.
Unfortunately, with his first priority objective—riling up Potter—achieved, Draco found himself growing restless again between their encounters; despite their ever increasing frequency. Although he had plenty of books to entertain himself with, now that his mind was satisfied with Potter’s level of liveliness, he had too much space to think about other things. Darker things. Things like the fact that his father would probably have forced him to take the Mark if he hadn’t been arrested. As the days passed, these thoughts took up more and more space in Draco’s head.
“So,” Hermione began hesitantly, but Ron cut her off, blurting out, “You and Malfoy called it quits again then? I can’t say I’m surprised, he’s—”
“Why are you giving Potter lessons in Occlumency? And where is he anyway? Why did he not return to school?” asked Draco, crossing his arms.
The voices died down immediately. Keeping his face as neutral as possible, Severus quickly placed the basket on the coffee table in front of Harry, who eyed it curiously. When he shot a questioning glance at him, Severus gestured for him to open it as he sat back down next to Remus. He held his breath as Harry reached out and flipped the basket open. Harry’s eyes widened and Draco sucked in a sharp breath.
Harry’s eyes were hard as steel as silence settled over them. Severus’ heart was beating too fast, and he forced himself to breathe slowly and deeply. The worst was yet to come.
“Harry, I need you to come with me, okay? Can you follow me? Just keep breathing and follow me, love.”
. He was at Grimmauld Place. Not Privet Drive. Draco kept his eyes locked on Harry’s and Harry lost himself in the swirling silver-grey irises. He didn’t know how long they stood there, but eventually, the ringing in his ears subsided and his heart began to slow down.
Ron scowled. For a moment Harry considered getting the Trick Wand and Nosebleed Nougat he was holding for him, but the thought of exploiting the twins’ generosity towards him felt wrong, so he said nothing as Ron put the things back on the shelves with a sour expression.
But they shouldn’t have stayed in the Room of Requirement overnight to begin with, and if they didn’t show up soon there would undoubtedly be questions they’d be unable to answer. They parted with great reluctance, both seemingly wanting to hang on to their lingering intimacy as long as possible. Draco left first with Harry’s Invisibility Cloak to sneak down to the dungeons without anyone questioning what he’d done up on the seventh floor so early. Harry could pick it up in Severus’ rooms later.
For a moment, Severus wondered whether he should be stricter with Harry about that. Was he supposed to keep the boys in check, prevent them from fooling around too much? As soon as the thought had formed, a laugh rose in his throat and he shook his head.
Determined, he straightened up and turned to leave, when there was a knock on the door. Two knocks, quick and firm but not loud. It stopped Remus dead in his tracks. He knew exactly how each person in this house knocked. Harry knocked twice, but slower and louder. Narcissa always knocked three times, almost softly. Draco also knocked three times, but far more firmly. And Severus— Severus knocked twice, quick and firm but not loud.
“I don’t think he’s going to reject you,” Narcissa insisted. “He’s trying to give you time and space because he doesn’t want to pressure you, that’s the only reason he’s keeping his distance.”
It ended as suddenly as it had begun, and the creaking and crackling of Grimmauld Place filled his ears again, thoughts streaming back into his mind. He still felt the tension lingering in his body, but he could breathe again.
Severus eyed the bottle of mint green liquid Draco had given him with mixed feelings. While the boy seemed awfully sure that this concoction was the solution to Severus’ perpetually greasy hair, Severus himself wasn’t sure what to think of it, given that Draco had
A split-second later Harry appeared in front of him, discarding his Invisibility Cloak on the floor and pressing up against Draco who was now trapped between Harry and the sink digging into his back. Harry’s smell washed over him and lightning shot through Draco’s blood as Harry pried his lips open with his tongue. He tasted sweeter than usual, like he’d just eaten something sugary—they must’ve had dessert with Slughorn—but underneath the sweetness it was still
The response never came. Instead, Harry heard a loud thunk and a gasp, followed by Severus’ panicked calls, “Narcissa? Narcissa!”
“Certainly,” replied Severus, summoning an elf with a snap of his fingers and instructing her to bring Sirona’s basket to Harry’s dorm with the rest of his things. Looking at Harry again, he added, “There’s something else I would like to show you.”
“What do you mean, I sent Harry into a panic attack?” Severus cut in before Narcissa could argue back, his eyes flitting back and forth between Draco and Harry anxiously.
The noise made his head pound — he must’ve hit it when he landed — and he groaned as he pushed himself up into a sitting position. Harry was already halfway to him, grinning broadly.
in his head, but he rationalised it away with the fact that “Malfoy” would be ambiguous with Narcissa in the house—had sent a hex at him in the hallway and somehow
“You do nothing at all today, my darling, it’s your birthday,” she said dismissively, waving him away before adding, “Do pick up your gifts and bring them to your room before dinner, though.”
Admittedly, they could’ve talked more if they hadn’t been so busy snogging, but while still trying to prevent anyone from noticing what was going on between them, their time together was already significantly limited and they obviously had to make use of every second to satiate their hunger for each other. Between daily apparition practice followed by duels with Remus in the garden and nightly conversations in his room, daily Occlumency sessions and discussions about healing magic with Severus, as well as the meals Narcissa insisted on, there was barely any time for them to sneak into each other’s rooms without risk of being detected.
“I could use a drink after this,” said Severus, hoping his voice didn’t sound as cautious to Remus as it did to himself.
in there!” Draco’s voice hissed, sounding surprisingly worried. And angry. Remus turned his ears towards the door, intrigued. He had noticed that the boys had begun to treat each other more civilly, but Draco
He cleaned up his work station the way Severus had taught them. There was a distinct logic to it—Harry hadn’t dared to question it then and by now it was a habit—and he found that he was faster than even Hermione. As he waited for her and Ron to finish, he watched the Slytherins across the room. Pansy was keeping up a steady stream of chatter which seemed to pearl right off Blaise and Draco, while Theodore Nott had his head lowered and seemed utterly focused on packing his things. According to Draco, Theo had spoken up for him and the DA.
Remus smiled and nodded. “I shall be there. Did you have anything special planned for your first lesson?”
Albus hummed in acknowledgement. Then, after a short silence, he said, “Yes, I suppose that would work as well. You would offer your Floo as his means of travel?”
Draco ran his hand through Harry’s hair soothingly, letting his fingers trail down Harry’s neck with every stroke. He increased the pressure, kneading the tight muscles between his fingers, which drew a contented sigh from Harry’s lips.
Draco breathed, tangling his hands in Harry’s hair again—if only to steady himself. Harry grinned up at him, green eyes sparkling with mischief even though his pupils were blown wide with lust. He ran his hands up Draco’s thighs; slowly, teasing, his face so close to Draco’s crotch that he could feel Harry’s breath on the sensitive skin of his cock. Draco whimpered and Harry’s grin widened. Settling one hand on Draco’s hips—providing Draco with some much appreciated stability; his legs were shaking at this point—he ran the other one over the exposed skin around Draco’s hard length, avoiding to touch where he knew Draco wanted him to.
“Watch where you’re fucking going, Potter,” he spat angrily, pushing Potter harder than usual. Hard enough to make him tumble down onto the floor.
“Mr Potter,” he said in that silky tone he always used in the classroom, his eyes clocking the Slytherins down the hallway, “come in.”
“Draco, as much as I hate to say it now, but I refused your handshake because you were a little prat, not because of anyone else’s opinion. When we met in Madam Malkin’s—do you remember that? When we met there, you reminded me of my cousin. I was incredibly insecure after being thrown into a completely different world all of a sudden, and you were, well, an arrogant bully. And no, I shouldn’t have judged you so quickly, I know that. It was unfair to you and I’m sorry, but back then— Hagrid was the first person who was ever kind to me. That entire day at Diagon Alley, getting my stuff for Hogwarts with him, was like a dream come true, a dream in which I wasn’t ignored, yelled at, chased or laughed at, a taste of a life away from the Dursleys. And then I met you and you were just like Dudley; spoilt rotten, condescending, laughing at me because I didn’t understand your world at all. My first instinct was to get defensive.”
He glanced anxiously at Harry, but the dim light of dawn was barely enough to make out Harry’s face, let alone decipher his expression. Just as he was about to say
“And what are you moping about?” Severus’ drawl ripped Draco out of his rumination and he sat up quickly, straightening his robes.
“We talk about you sometimes, although he’s never brought it up by himself as of yet. I mostly ask him about his Occlumency lessons, which are going alright from what he tells me?” He looked at Severus questioningly, hoping that the man agreed with that statement. To his relief, Severus nodded without hesitation.
It was Harry who saved them all, living up to his heroic reputation, by casually asking the twins how their business was going, which had Fred—at least Draco thought that was Fred—immediately launching into a detailed account of everything they’d been experimenting with. Draco had to admit that it sounded rather impressive, despite some of their products being decidedly absurd. Apparently they had even acquired a shop space at Diagon Alley and were preparing to open their doors within the week. To his relief, he noticed that other conversations had started up as well, with Bill talking to Remus and Severus—Draco thought he heard something about tricky curses—and Charlie seemingly interrogating the Weaslette about something that had her cheeks flaming and throwing nervous glances at her father, who was quite obviously listening in. Fleur had roped Mrs Weasley into a discussion about a cake, and Draco quickly realised that they were debating a wedding—seemingly Fleur’s own. To a Weasley. Draco shuddered at the thought. Oh well, whatever made her happy.
Since I completed my outline, I’ve been jumping back and forth between scenes, so my consistent head start is dwindling and I want it back.
Harry stopped for a moment as he noticed how weirdly contradictory that thought was, as if he was refusing the idea to get back at Snape—who would only be bothered by that if it was actually true. No, no, he wasn’t refusing the idea because he didn’t like Snape, he was refusing it because it was ridiculous. Yes, that was it.
Oh, right, Weasley. All the Weasleys. And Granger. Dread came crashing back into Draco like a freight train. He hadn’t had a chance to apologise to Weasley yet, and the red-head did
Blaise frowned. “Usually you go on and on about Potter, but never mind then. Why aren’t you with the others?”
“Not today,” Harry replied angrily, simply wanting to be left alone so he could read this damn book and get his mind off Draco.
“It’s sort of like an extended duelling club—I don’t see why he’d say anything against it,” said Harry, and he was glad that Neville seemed to accept his answer.
to protect him from actual, physical abuse. He wanted to dismantle her bone by bone, along with her monstrosity of a husband and disgrace of a son.
“It’s my birthday on Wednesday,” Harry began carefully, “and I was hoping to see Hermione and the Weasleys.”
expanding, unfolding, growing in his ribcage. He vaguely remembered a somewhat similar feeling, the first time Lily had told him that she loved him, back in their fourth year at Hogwarts. It was wonderful—and absolutely overwhelmingly too much. Severus suddenly realised he’d stopped breathing and quickly sucked in a sharp breath.
They lapsed into sullen silence. After a short while, Harry shook himself out of his rumination. He didn’t want to waste the limited time they had together with brooding. They moved on to lighter topics. Just as they were discussing Harry’s plan for the first DA session, the door swung open and Draco slipped inside.
Severus heard himself scream again as his own spell tore open his chest, leaving deep gashes spilling blood. The bonds around his wrists disappeared and he collapsed into a crumpled heap on the floor. Everything was pain.
“After he healed the Sectumsempra wounds, you had passed out again and weren’t really breathing, or at least it looked like you weren’t. Your breathing had been rather erratic before, so maybe it was just invisible in comparison, or maybe you actually weren’t breathing—I couldn’t tell you. Harry, he— He sort of panicked. Keep in mind, that he had done a rather powerful bit of magic just a few minutes earlier, and then gone right on to heal the Sectumsempra cuts. He was probably completely exhausted and just too fired up to notice, and we were all on edge. Either way, he said your name and when you didn’t respond he got agitated. He called your name again, and again, and then—” Remus trailed off, his expression an odd mixture of emotions that Severus couldn’t fully decipher.
It merely showed how talented the four founders had really been, and how much effort they’d put into the spells imbued in the castle when building the school.
“He won’t be pleased if I don’t show, but I’ve talked my way out of worse predicaments,” Severus responded, hoping to sound convincing enough.
Draco was behaving like a sodding Gryffindor, but the memory of Potter’s lips on his spurred him out of his hesitation. He could
“Are you here alone?” asked Harry as they made their way through the pub towards Diagon Alley, barely able to believe that Mrs— Molly would allow such a thing.
he thought despite himself. Now Potter wouldn’t constantly be surrounded by adoring fans, wouldn’t be distracted by loud, obnoxious Gryffindors. Maybe they could—
, like Episkey for example.” He tried his hardest not to sound irritated at Hermione’s constant questioning of his judgement, but his success was mediocre.
She raised an eyebrow at that, but didn’t comment. Instead, she turned her attention back to the stove, where a pile of pancakes waited under a stasis charm, while another one sizzled in a pan. Just as she levitated it onto the pile, Remus entered. He looked extremely tired, no doubt the aftereffects of the full moon.
Severus shook his head vehemently. To even consider that was ridiculous. The odds of a one-time thing resulting in a pregnancy, while she’d undoubtedly slept with Potter countless times, were practically zero.
“Blaise! Merlin’s beard, don’t sneak up on me like that,” Draco complained, snapping the notebook closed. “Is your lunch with this Slughorn person over already?”
He could’ve just told them the truth right away, but their constant incredulity whenever either Severus or Draco were concerned was starting to really get on his nerves.
True enough, the snake had slithered under Harry’s clothes, and Severus could only assume that she settled either around his arm or his chest to stay out of sight. At Grimmauld Place, Harry had usually carried her around his neck, but that’d be too obvious for the Great Hall.
“Maybe she didn’t tell him who it was,” Harry whispered, although hope was flickering in his eyes now. Draco’s mother shook her head.
“Or Draco,” he mumbled, blushing slightly, but she continued to stare him down until he finally rolled his eyes and added, “Or you.”
Relentless, that’s what she was. Absolutely relentless. Severus shot her a glare, then sighed and admitted, “Because he’s my son. You were right.”
“Exactly. Them refusing to accept me as their Defence teacher is not helping that issue.” He rolled his eyes. “At least most of the students in fourth year or above seem to be somewhat competent with the basics, thanks to Harry’s DA lessons last year. Unfortunately, that excludes the Slytherins.”
“Thank you, I’m sorry for my harshness,” he mumbled. Narcissa only smiled at him and summoned Kreacher, ordering him to get various sweets for her son and several bars of chocolate for Remus. The elf returned within mere minutes, bowing deeply to Narcissa as he placed the bag on the kitchen table. Without another word, Remus snatched the chocolate bars and left, nodding to Narcissa as a goodbye.
He wasn’t as bothered by it as he’d expected himself to be. Instead, he had written her a three page letter explaining as well as he could how the wandless healing forms worked, which had successfully distracted Hermione from her irritation—at least judging from the next letter, but who knew with Hermione.
“Thought so. Just one thing, though: You’re my best mate, but I won’t hang around with Malfoy for you.”
“He has lost his mind!” Severus cried, throwing his arms in the air. “Even if I were considering to do what you ask, how would I ever explain this to Harry?”
The feel of Harry’s hot mouth drew a groan from Draco’s throat, and for a moment he forgot any and all words to keep talking, his head hitting the wall with a soft thunk as his eyes fell closed again. Harry didn’t stop, swirling his tongue around the tip, slowly travelling down Draco’s shaft. As his lips sank further down, Draco suddenly felt a hint of teeth, causing him to hiss in surprise.
. His jaw was clenched, eyes blazing like fire and his lips drawn together into a tight line. He looked downright dangerous. Better than fear, Severus supposed.
Draco almost burst out laughing, only barely managing to hold back. The twins, however, had no such inhibitions and roared with laughter, which in turn destroyed Draco’s self-control within seconds and he dissolved in giggles. While he was gasping for breath, he registered that almost everyone was laughing now, even Granger couldn’t suppress a small chuckle, although she did not look entirely pleased. The most prominent exception was Weasley, who looked extremely put out, his face red with anger.
. A thing he’d dreamed about his entire life, resigned to the idea that he’d never get it. And now that he had a chance at it, he was terrified.
son. Sirius loved Harry because of who he was. Sure, their relationship might have started because Sirius was his godfather because James made him that, but it ultimately developed on its own.”
Ending the spell abruptly he turned away from Snape, trying to compose himself. His eyes met Draco’s and the unexpected concern in them threw him off balance even more. He had to get out of here.
“What a lovely way to make the understatement of the week. The man has put an utterly outdated textbook on their list, half the recipes in there are inaccurate according to today’s standards.”
Harry smiled and shook his head. “No, I do want to tell you. It’s not like I can keep it a secret forever, as soon as people realise how much I’ve changed everyone will hound me for an explanation. Now that those girls from before know I bet the news is already spreading.”
Harry blinked in surprise. He knew that Dumbledore had insisted that Narcissa swear an Unbreakable Vow before allowing her to enter Grimmauld Place, but he’d never asked about the specifics of it. How the hell could Narcissa have broken her vow while standing in his kitchen?
He was still trying to catch his breath when Harry’s hand disappeared and he felt a cleaning charm wash over him. The cover was pulled away from underneath him and Harry settled it on top of them. Finally opening his eyes he reached for Harry, pulling him into a tight embrace.
“If I could sit down, that would be—” Dumbledore never finished his sentence, collapsing to the ground. Severus barely managed to catch him, but when Harry moved towards them, Severus motioned him away.
Their wands buzzed and they jumped, focusing on the potion again. Draco checked Severus’ instructions twice, before stirring the potion once counter-clockwise.
Wordlessly, Harry showed her the scroll. Her eyes widened as she read, and Draco wondered what was going through her mind. Then she smiled more brightly than Draco had seen in recent years, giving the scroll back to Harry.
It was ten forty-nine by now, eleven minutes until the train left. Remus led Harry to a wagon and levitated his trunk and Hedwig’s cage inside for him. Not that it would’ve been necessary, but it was nice all the same. He enveloped Harry in a crushing hug, saying much the same as Narcissa had—stay safe, don’t do anything stupid, stay in touch.
His only consolation throughout the week had been Draco, who was possibly the only person who hated all the attention Harry was getting even more than Harry himself. And that was saying something.
“What are you on about?” Draco asked, as they arrived in the entrance hall, where his mother was waiting for them.
After five years — more, actually, if he really thought about it — of following him everywhere like bodyguards watching his back, he’d somehow expected some sort of resistance from them against him going out alone. Perhaps they were finally realising that they had nothing in common except a shared childhood due to their fathers’ friendship. Either way, Draco had been pleasantly surprised by the lack of argument upon his leaving.
“I have never kissed a guy before either. I’m sorry I went too far, I wasn’t quite thinking straight.”
“—and the smaller wounds practically stopped bleeding. Harry then tried another healing charm, the same that hadn’t had any effect before, and the cuts closed without any issue. So, we started healing those smaller ones first, because we were able to now, but the bigger ones on your chest were still bleeding quite badly. You woke up at that point, so Harry asked you what curse the Dark Lord used and whether there was a counter-curse.” Narcissa swallowed and cast a hesitant glance at Harry. “I told him then that I might have seen the curse before, and that it might be your own spell. After some prodding you managed to give him the incantation for the counter-curse and Harry healed you up. After that, Remus and I gave you a couple of potions, including Dreamless Sleep, and started to clean all the blood off. Then I brought you to bed and let you sleep, and here we are now.”
He knew that. He knew that this time the rejection wouldn’t be a snap decision, based on mere minutes of Draco’s most arrogant behaviour. This time the rejection would be truly personal. He wasn’t sure if he would survive it to be honest.
“Oh yes, Severus, it is my business,” Lupin interjected. “If you slept with Lily while she was with James— If you were with her around the time she got pregnant, you could actually be Harry’s father. And if you are, he has a right to know that. So quit the nonsense and just tell me what happened between you and Lily. Why would you let Harry believe that there was something going on if it isn’t true?”
“You shouldn’t stay in a class just because you like the teacher as a person, he’ll understand,” he said, taking the book out of Harry’s hands and putting it away on the coffee table. “Now this,” he continued, holding out the small leather box, “is only half of your gifts. It’s not even a proper present; you’ll get one of those tomorrow—or, well, later today—with all the other presents. It’s, er, a little personal—”
Severus shook his head and tried to wrap his head around the thought of Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter
“My father,” he replied simply, and Pansy’s face fell immediately. Millicent looked—to use Blaise’s words—as if she’d bitten into a lemon, Greg and Vince shared a pointed look, and even Theo peeked out from behind his book.
, before snogging him so passionately that Harry couldn’t have strung together a coherent sentence if he’d tried. The charm had worked on his first attempt right afterwards.
“Come on, Hermione is in the common room. We saw the DA announcement on the board, so we’re starting on Wednesday?” Ron was already out the door when he paused to see if Harry was even following. “You coming, mate?”
She gave an irritated huff and kept cutting the bean, trying to get it to release more juice. Harry ignored her and went over to stirring his potion; seven times counter-clockwise, one time clockwise, repeat. His potion turned a pale pink and he heard Hermione make an indignant noise next to him.
The hot water around him seemed to heat up even further, as unbidden memories of Sirius came back to him. He growled in frustration and, holding his breath, dipped his head under the surface. The sounds of the house were both muffled and amplified through the water. His thoughts were swirling in spirals, as he kept trying to keep them away from Sirius and how fucking delicious he smelled. He forced himself to think of Harry instead, which had the desired effect of distracting him, albeit at the cost of making him worry again. He wondered how the conversation between him and Severus had gone, although, considering that Draco had felt the need to rescue Harry out of the house, it probably hadn’t been all too pleasant.
The previous day had been spent packing and finishing up last preparations. At Harry’s request, Narcissa had given him a haircut; while Harry had liked it longer it didn’t do anything to cover his scar that way, and he wasn’t keen on having it on display outside of Grimmauld Place. Afterwards, Harry had skipped both his practice session with Remus and his Occlumency lesson with Severus, in favour of staying in bed cuddled up with Draco.
“But I didn’t, because I was prepared with a portkey to bring me back here, where I knew I would receive help.”
Even Remus mostly left him alone, and Harry was content to spend his time working, reading and continuously further exploring the house. In the process, he found several hidden rooms—their doors concealed behind bookshelves, portraits or fireplaces—including an even
“In that case I shall announce the club during tonight’s feast,” said Albus, his usual small smile returning to his lips. “Has Harry decided on a new name for it? Dumbledore’s Army is hardly appropriate.”
Staring out of his windows into the clear depths of the lake, he went through possible scenarios—until a delightfully simple solution came to him. He picked up his quill.
Harry’s heart was still pounding hard in his chest when they left the Defence classroom, pumping copious amounts of adrenaline through his system.
Harry sighed. “You know I would explain if I could, Hermione, but if you haven’t noticed we’re in the middle of a crowd.”
Remus laughed. He couldn’t fault the boy for being preoccupied upon finding out that his presumed father had accepted him as a surrogate son, despite knowing who his actual father was, whom he despised.
Draco nodded. “If you apparated now, the bracelet would lead you directly to me. But that’s not all.” He tapped his own bracelet with his finger this time, activating it. Harry inhaled sharply when the golden metal pulsed softly against his wrist. “Admittedly, it doesn’t allow for particularly elaborate communication, but simple signals are possible—for example in an emergency, which we both know isn’t entirely unlikely to occur in your case.”
Draco snapped his mouth shut, glaring daggers at his mother, but Narcissa looked entirely unbothered.
boyfriend, or of someone else getting this sort of affection from his mother—but he found that he didn’t. Even though it had only been a week since Harry and him had started seeing each other, Draco had never felt so sure about anything before. Harry was his, he was family now, and it made sense that Draco’s mother would also come to care for him. He felt a smile spread on his face, as he watched his mother soothe Harry, and he gently put a hand on Harry’s back, just so he could feel he was here.
his father, but instead his father was the man they’d hated most, meaning they would’ve hated Harry, too.
Remus,” Harry, whose face was redder than Weasley’s hair, interrupted hastily. “We’ll be careful, I promise, you don’t have to worry.”
A familiar chime announced that it was time for lunch and they headed downstairs. After their meal, Harry settled in the drawing room with his now-favourite book about healing:
Draco rolled his eyes so hard that only the whites were visible for a moment. “Fucking— Let me— Come back here!” He pushed against Harry’s grip, but with his arms pinned above his head he was at a disadvantage.
“It’s a medical journal that’s coupled with the syringe. If you draw blood with it and activate the diagnosis charm—there are instructions inside the cover—the journal will automatically give you a full diagnostic report of the person you took the blood from. The standard charm checks for regular health parameters, as well as acute ailments and curses. There are some other spells mentioned that can reveal medical history or residual magic, but you’ll have to figure that out yourself, you’re the healer, not me.” He smiled at Harry’s stunned expression. “I know you’re perfectly capable of a diagnostic charm by now, but it’s supposed to save some energy and it’s convenient to have everything recorded immediately, that way if you need it again—”
“Valid point.” Harry leaned in for another kiss. Draco melted into him, his agitation dissipating under Harry’s touch. Draco walked backwards, pulling Harry along, until his legs hit the edge of the bed and he let himself fall onto the dark blue covers, breaking the kiss. He toed off his shoes before he moved further to the centre of the bed.
His father had raised him to be calculating, to be secretive, to socialise with the proper people, to make sure they feared and respected him, that they deferred to him as they should. The first time he’d ever tried to stretch his wings and make a friend, convinced that nobody would ever turn away a
“Kreacher is useful for small errands, but he is old and not the most thorough when it comes to hygiene. I have not asked him to cook for us since the third day after arriving here.”
Harry felt a blush rise in his cheeks, but he met Dumbledore’s gaze steadily as he replied, “It wasn’t meant to be spectacular, I simply wanted to get detention. A cover is worthless if it is not believable.”
“Please do not feel obliged to interrupt your daily routine because of me. I am quite capable of looking after myself, in fact, should
This time the kiss really did stay gentle. Harry stepped away, trying to ignore the feeling of loss that tingled over his skin where Draco had last touched. Silver eyes were still fixed on him when Narcissa took Draco’s hand and gave Harry a last smile, and then they were gone with a crack, leaving Harry’s chest as empty as the hallway.
Thin fingers closed around his wrist and he jerked back, frantically trying to free himself of the unusually loose grip.
like a fucking incantation. He leaned forward, pressing a comparably chaste kiss to those unreasonably soft lips, and something clicked in his mind. Letting out a shaky breath as he drew back, he stared into those green eyes trying to gather his courage.
He got off his bed and leisurely made his way down to the kitchen. He wanted sweets. Lupin and Severus were sat at the table talking quietly, glancing up warily when Draco walked in. After plundering the pantry by grabbing the last piece of chocolate, he lazily went back upstairs.
I feel like I have to point out that the rating of this fic changed from Mature to Explicit. Not because of this chapter, obviously, but because of one much further down the line that I got done yesterday.
Draco stumbled after him, but the door had already fallen shut, shutting him out. “Wait,” he whispered, “don’t go.”
“Harry?” he called, lifting the mirror in front of himself. It didn’t show his reflection. Instead of his own, Harry’s face was looking back at him, smiling broadly. “Harry! Everything alright?”
Snape, however, reacted immediately by moving to stand in front of her, sneering at Harry. “Calm down, Potter!” he snarled angrily, waking up the portrait of Walburga Black, who promptly began to screech her usual vile tirades.
“He made a mistake last year, I’m sure he’s well aware of that. He wouldn’t keep anything important from you anymore after everything that happened.”
Draco nodded and followed her, Harry trailing a step behind. They were almost at the entrance of the white building when Harry suddenly stopped dead. Draco looked at him questioningly.
Harry arched up into him and he let out a moan. Wrenching his mouth away from Harry’s, Draco sucked in a deep breath and slid down, mouthing kisses along Harry’s torso as he went. He felt Harry shiver beneath his touch, which in turn sent molten heat down his own spine.
“No! What if they can’t accept it, if they don’t believe that I’m sorry, that I’ve changed—am changing? What if they make you choose?” Draco sat up, pulling his hands away from Harry’s, staring at him with a somewhat frantic expression. “What if it’s them or me?” he whispered, and the mask dropped completely, revealing just how afraid Draco really was.
“Alright, alright, let’s go shopping then if you’re so excited about it. I should’ve figured, really, given how perfectly styled you always prance around.”
Remus gave a sharp laugh. “Already tried that, she refused. She insisted that one of us had to do it, and I suppose she has a point that it is our responsibility.”
“It’s a journal,” she stated flatly. Harry nodded, still smiling. “How does a journal solve the issue of you and Draco communicating?”
Remus hesitated. He seemed sincere. Slowly, he nodded, finally uncrossing his arms. Severus visibly relaxed.
Remus nodded in acknowledgement and silence settled over the room again. Narcissa soon rose from the table and began to prepare lunch, calling Kreacher to help her. Severus barely noticed them, however, lost in his own thoughts. His mind kept swirling with hazy images of Harry’s face, the feeling of strong, pure magic pouring over him, driving out the burning pain in his body. He thought he could remember Harry’s voice, calling his name. He wished his memory was clearer.
“Of course I do!” Severus protested. “Spending all day in a cloud of potion fumes usually undoes the effort though.”
“Look, I don’t like using dark arts any more than you do, but I don’t have a choice, Hermione. I am, unfortunately, the Chosen One. As much as I wish I wasn’t, I am. And that means I’m responsible for ending this war — one way or another. Excuse me if I’d prefer to come out of it alive rather than morally superior. Besides, that talk about dark spells ‘twisting’ you really is rubbish.”
His mother laughed, shook her head and motioned to the seamstress to carry on. Draco stared at her in disbelief. His mother would
Harry didn’t answer. He had half a mind to just get up and leave again, but willed himself to stay seated. Better to get this over with.
Remus exhaled slowly and shrugged. “It could be worse, but it’s definitely not my favourite thing in the world. It’s too quiet here now.” He laughed. “Never would’ve thought that Grimmauld Place could feel so vast, I always perceived it as somewhat confining and cramped, but now that everyone is gone there’s suddenly way too much empty space.”
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, you are not of age yet, I am your mother and you will not argue with me!” Without raising her voice, Narcissa somehow managed to convey an immense amount of authority.
“I— I am afraid that if it comes down to me or them, you’ll choose them,” he admitted eventually, closing his eyes as if that would prevent anyone from hearing him.
One look at their audience had Remus almost burst out with laughter. They had absolutely liked it. In fact, they looked like they were about ready to declare Harry a hero without any prophecy to back it up. His cub was still grinning broadly as they made their way back towards the edge of the natural terrain, taking down the ward as they walked.
They went to bed happy and sated, and Harry was resolved to try to talk to Severus again the next day. But Severus was once again absent during all their meals, and Harry’s will to go through with his plan was waning quickly. Nevertheless, he forced himself to be calm as he went to the library shortly before eight o’clock, and when their lesson ended he spoke up.
“Dumbledore trusts him. He hasn’t given me any real reason to distrust his loyalty so far, apart from being a right prick as a teacher up until now. You don’t?”
“That is none of your concern,” Harry interrupted him harshly, and Severus quickly inclined his head in apology.
Ron’s eyes had gone wide at Harry’s outburst. Harry drew a deep breath to steady himself before he went on in a much calmer tone, “You’re right, though, I have changed. I wasn’t myself before, now I am — and gods it feels so much better, like a weight that was lifted off of me. But I didn’t change my morals or my values. All those things I listed before, they’re old news. You were even there for most of it. If you’re insinuating that I’ve suddenly grown a dark side because I started to spend time with my father, I can assure you it’s been there the entire time, and quite visible at that.”
“I wouldn’t worry too much about that, the boy has proven himself quite capable of sneaking around the castle.”
“We must go about this carefully,” she said slowly. “Harry’s well-being must remain our priority. Yes, his relatives deserve to suffer, but their suffering can not cause more distress for Harry, and despite their horrible deeds, I’m unsure how he would feel about his father and his guardian flat-out murdering them. No, we have to find another way to repay them for their cruelty. A legal way.”
He already had his wand pointed at Severus’ chest, and only a second later the dull ache of the stunner faded.
Draco smiled and summoned his quill. He hesitated for a moment, unsure how to answer. Harry hadn’t bothered with the usual formalities of a letter, so maybe Draco shouldn’t either. Maybe he should try to treat it like an ordinary conversation, just…written. The idea suddenly felt rather odd.
, Harry?” Weasley found his voice again, and before Harry could answer, he’d also found his wand, pointing it straight at Draco.
Draco did his best to feign boredom, even as his stomach did an uncomfortable flip. “Does he now? And why would that be of interest to me?”
He bid Minerva good night and hastily made his way towards the dungeons. Time to get some peace and quiet before term would start in earnest the next day.
With nothing else to do—and trying to avoid blatantly staring at Draco—Harry started to leaf through the book he’d taken in Ron’s stead. The pages were littered with notes, all written in small, narrow handwriting that somehow looked oddly familiar.
Harry stepped back to let him into the room. “A bit of a headache, but I’m alright, I guess. Just very confused.”
Everything felt different, somehow. His physique hadn’t changed as drastically as his face, he was still lean and rather skinny, but his shoulders seemed a little broader.
Draco sat down on the edge of the black leather couch, looking far from relaxed. He was fidgeting. Draco never fidgeted.
“Harry!” George flung his arm around Harry’s shoulders, apparently having escaped from his mother. “We’ve been looking everywhere for you, follow me!” And with that he pulled him away. Harry stumbled after George who turned their slow struggle through the shop into somewhat of a tour, pointing out their different product ranges. All of a sudden, the mass of people thinned as George pulled him into a much more muted room at the back of the shop where Fred seemed to be waiting for them.
Draco apologised quickly, but not without a hint of exasperation in his tone. Harry meanwhile turned his attention back to his letter, the second piece of parchment containing the booklist for their next term. Harry wondered for a minute whether he should just get the books for Arithmancy and Runes and try to self-study. It couldn’t
“Voldemort may have lost young Mr Malfoy, but he will no doubt try to find another way to kill me. We can not allow that to happen.”
Severus nodded. “At least they have each other, indeed,” he said quietly, and for some reason Remus felt his pulse quicken slightly at that.
He glanced down at the page and tried to decipher what the instructions said—which was rather difficult, since whoever the previous owner had been had crossed out the entire line.
“Actually, I think I understand perfectly,” Narcissa countered. “Did you really think I wouldn’t see it when my own son falls in love?”
They withdrew without another word, sliding the compartment door closed again. Harry and his friends sat in silence for a few moments, then Ginny began to laugh anew.
! The exhilaration that had spread through his body was suddenly doused with panic, and he moved to pull back, but before Draco could create any distance between them, Potter placed a hand to the nape of Draco’s neck and pulled him back in, while Potter’s other arm wrapped itself around his waist, pressing Draco flush against him.
Harry didn’t respond. He hadn’t ever thought about asking Pomfrey about it, but it sounded so logical now. They sat silently for a long moment, before Draco spoke up.
“Yeah, so, my mother put some charms on me that made me look like my dad. I mean like James. They’re gone now, so—” He trailed off, unsure what else there was to say.
He’d been terrified like never before. Terrified and deeply disturbed. Whatever his father must have seen in the Dark Lord once was long gone. The man—if you could even call him a man—was more than obviously insane. The realisation had shattered the last bit of respect Draco had held for his father.
When Remus learned the truth two years ago, he had struggled not only to truly comprehend that Sirius was innocent, but also that he was
Narcissa smiled, saying, “I’m certain they won’t simply abandon you, judging from all I’ve heard about them. They clearly care for you, they wouldn’t just
Harry laughed as the door slid closed behind them again. They made their way to Harry’s room quietly and Draco was glad that they didn’t run into anyone.
Remus’ eyes widened. He had figured that it’d be something Harry would want eventually, but he hadn’t expected it to happen so suddenly, especially not so soon after Severus’ rather harsh rejection. He felt his anger abate, but it didn’t disappear fully. Severus still owed him an explanation.
The words were breathless and Harry smirked up at the Slytherin, his lips still around Draco’s nipple. “Harry, please, I need to touch you,
“In fact, I was hoping you would assist me with recruiting our newest staff-member, Harry,” Albus continued.
“They’re fine, they’re all safe and sound back at Hogwarts. They worry about you. Dumbledore had to swear to them that you’re safe, otherwise they’d have abandoned Hogwarts immediately to look for you. Hermione and Ginny were especially fierce in their demand to know where you are.”
, he told himself sternly, forcing down the flurry of emotions rising in him and willing himself to act naturally.
The next day was much the same as the ones before, with Harry training with Remus and Draco in the morning, then spending his time learning runes and arithmancy in the afternoon with Draco helping him whenever he got stuck. It rarely happened with runes, but he found arithmancy to be rather tricky. Fortunately, it was Draco’s strength. Nevertheless, after a rather complicated explanation of how spell qualities could be arithmantically combined in stacks, Harry’s brain felt like someone had put it through a meat grinder.
he most afraid of? There were a number of things that could go wrong, ranging from practically bound to happen to very unlikely, and from almost amusing to utterly devastating. Unfortunately, severity and likelihood did not align at all in this case. In fact, the mildest reaction—surprise followed by acceptance—was among the least likely.
A shudder went through him as he remembered that night. The night he had found Sirius again. The night Peter had escaped. All because Remus had forgotten his damned potion. Or maybe it wouldn’t have changed a thing if he had taken it, there was no way to tell for sure.
Hermione nodded in agreement. “That sounds reasonable, though you did manage to teach third years how to produce a Patronus last year — perhaps more people than you know will be able to move to harder spells.”
“At the end of last year I told you about the prophecy. Now, I believe you are ready to receive some deeper information about the man you are destined to destroy.”
“I think I had an unfair advantage,” Harry said quickly, looking abashed. “The spell, it felt similar to some healing forms I’ve tried. So, I tried to shape my magic in the same way and, well, it worked.” He shrugged. “Lots of people could probably do it if they knew how.”
The day flew by quickly, with Harry returning to his duelling practice and apparition training. Draco didn’t join them this time, spending his afternoon in the now refurbished library instead, researching Merlin knew what. All Harry had gotten as a response when he’d asked was that it had to do with potions and Harry should go focus on being the Chosen One. He’d recognised the mocking as a means to get him to stop asking questions, so he’d left Draco to it. Chances were that he’d learn soon enough what it was all about; Draco just wanted things to be prepared before sharing them sometimes.
He groaned into his pillow again, wishing whatever crack in the universe had messed everything up so deeply would just swallow him whole. He could never face Draco again. Their routine had been weird, but unexpectedly positive if you ignored the aching bruises the stinging hexes left, and Harry had ruined it because he just couldn’t control his fucking impulses. He’d been shocked himself, although his own surprise probably had nothing on Draco’s, if the expression on Draco’s face had been any indication.
“Ron’s point was silly though, really. He said that I look nothing like myself anymore—no shit, Sherlock. He insisted that it wasn’t the face, but the clothes, that you’re trying to influence me and turn me into something I’m not. I thought it was kinda funny because half the family actually complimented me on my outfit when they arrived, so you can’t be all that bad of an influence.”
Expecting to be in the hospital wing, he turned to the other side and his hands found a nightstand. It felt wrong. Made of wood. The bedside tables in the hospital wing were metal—Harry should know after spending so much time there.
“That’s also what everyone said about Severus being my father. How can we be sure? What if we are related in some twisted way? What if he’s like, I don’t know, Dad’s grandfather or something? Dad told me that he never met his grandparents, his mother was not on good terms with them. It’s not impossible.”
True enough, Harry kept glancing at the crowd as if trying to gauge their reaction. Well, if he allowed himself to be distracted …
Several people, especially younger students, were craning their necks to get a better view of Harry, and Remus furrowed his brows. Maybe some sort of stage would’ve been helpful—
“You collapsed in the entrance hall, blood-soaked. Narcissa got to you first and cast some stasis charms on your wounds—I have no idea how many there were, but too many to count. We brought you into the dining hall and tried some healing spells, but none of them worked. Neither did your healing potions. So we figured that—”
Remus gave him a small smile and gestured towards the armchairs. Giving Remus another eye-roll, Harry resigned and settled down in one of the dark recliners, facing Remus expectantly.
“As a matter of fact we’ve already solved the issue of communication,” Harry shot back, a hint of pride in his voice.
Harry relaxed a little and a small smile tugged on his lips. Draco pulled him closer, pressing a kiss to the top of his head. For several long minutes he just held him, providing as much comfort as he could. Gradually, Harry sank into him until his face was buried firmly in the crook of Draco’s neck and his entire front was plastered to Draco’s side.
the thing in only four hours, and this was only the third attempt. But what harm could it possibly do?
the same, and you know that. The fact that the mere knowledge that Harry might be your son has changed your attitude towards him so drastically proves that. But I do love Harry like my own, I’ve known him since he was a baby and I regret nothing more than not being there for him as he grew up. I won’t abandon him.”
, and yet it was only half of the room. Granted, the room was big, but the dimensions of it still felt off, as if the left side couldn’t possibly be the same size as the right; and yet it was.
Draco looked aghast and opened his mouth multiple times as if to interrupt, but Harry never gave him a chance. Now that he had started, he had to finish.
“So, will you talk to Harry?” he asked cheekily, and the change in subject had the desired result of temporarily derailing his one-track mind. Severus groaned and rested his head against the wall.
Overall, time passed peacefully, pleasantly and productively. After finalising the two notebooks for Draco and himself, Harry had crafted a similar thing to communicate with Severus—this time in form of a simple small scroll on which messages erased themselves after they’d been answered. He had offered to make two more for Remus and Narcissa, but Remus had only smiled and reminded him of Sirius’ mirror, while Narcissa insisted on regular letters from him when he went back to school instead. For the first time in his life, Harry almost wished summer wouldn’t end so soon, his usual desperation to return to Hogwarts replaced with the longing to stay here with his family. With Draco.
After a few seconds, Narcissa ended the spell with a silent flick of her wand, while Draco murmured a Finite to make his core disappear again.
“I’ll teach them. Focus on the rest, they’ll catch up,” he said, turning Harry back towards the majority of the group.
Taking a deep breath, he went on with his story, growing more tense as it progressed from riding the Thestrals to the Ministry to finding the Hall of Prophecy, where they found the globe with Harry’s name on it and encountered Death Eaters.
“Today. Lupin contacted me to tell me that he woke up this morning. Since Dumbledore insisted that his Occlumency lessons are to resume as soon as possible, I visited Grimmauld Place shortly after lunch, bringing—”
“You’re quite right, Severus, we must understand the situation before we can allow it to become public knowledge. I’m afraid Harry can not return to the safety of his mother’s blood protection this summer. He’d undoubtedly be watched, even as he remains protected, and the change would be immediately reported back to Voldemort. No, he must remain hidden.”
“Portable glamour charms, we’ve been developing a range of accessoires that carry charms to disguise the wearer’s appearance. Could come in handy to avoid You-Know-Who’s dogs, don’t you think? Of course, they’re also brilliant for pranks,” George said with a mischievous smile.
. He’d finished his prefect duties with Pansy and returned to their compartment twenty minutes ago. Greg and Vince hadn’t said a single thing beyond a grunt that was supposed to mean Hello, Theo was hiding behind a book, Pansy and Millicent had their noses stuck together discussing gossip, and Blaise had his impassive mask of arrogance on, brooding in silence. That left Draco with nothing to do and nobody to talk to.
“So,” Harry said, still sounding somewhat hesitant but far less than before, “you’d be alright if we took this slow?”
Severus gave a curt nod, then stood. “I have an errand to run, but I will make sure to be back before then.”
Draco’s entire world zeroed in on Harry in his mouth. There was a constant stream of whimpers, moans, curses and Draco’s name falling from Harry’s lips now. Draco could tell that he was getting close. He just needed a little push, something like—
“I missed fifteen birthdays, there’s a lot to catch up on,” he replied smoothly, smiling back at Remus.
They hadn’t gone any further than that first night, not really, and while Draco was more than happy with Harry’s hands frequently wandering under his shirt, he hadn’t tried touching Harry again for fear of a similar reaction as that time. Still, he couldn’t deny that he
Of course Harry would be optimistic. Severus suppressed a sigh, trying to find the right words to explain to Harry that certain things were truly irreversible and that he was sure that this curse was one of them.
“Severus, yes, come and take a look, please,” Albus said, gesturing towards the bed they were gathered around.
“I can learn!” Pansy protested, and was about to launch into a rant when a small second-year Ravenclaw interrupted them.
“This is my fault,” he said softly, sounding far more fragile than Harry had ever heard him. Harry frowned again, confused.
After breakfast they had still one and a half hours left until the Hogwarts Express left at eleven o’clock. Everything was ready. Well, almost.
Letting go of Harry, he turned to the journals and picked up the one Harry hadn’t written into yet. It was an elegant thing with thick pages, bound in smooth black leather. His fingers brushed over something cold at the back of it and he curiously turned it over. A silver plaque was embedded in the leather, displaying three letters:
It was a simple room, only equipped with a bed, a wardrobe and a desk in the corner. He set his suitcase down as he looked around. It would do. If it meant that he got a chance at figuring things out with— with his son, then anything would do.
carry popcorn around with us when we’re around you. You really should’ve given us a heads-up,” George said, grinning from ear to ear.
Still, there was more to talk about, especially now that Harry’s birthday was drawing nearer. Originally, they—meaning Harry and Ron—had planned for Harry to go to the Burrow before his sixteenth birthday and spend the rest of his summer there. Now, with the situation being as it was, that was no longer an option. Not only would the Weasleys probably be rather unappreciative of Severus showing up once a day for his Occlumency lessons, but he also couldn’t really leave Draco, Narcissa, Remus and Severus behind to live here, in his house, without him. Besides, he didn’t
Narcissa let out a sob in Harry’s arms and he tightened his grip. Severus buried his face in his hands.
“We should probably get out of here, shouldn’t we?” he said softly, leaning in close enough to nudge Draco’s nose with his own. The gesture felt so incredibly soft and intimate that Draco forgot to breathe for a moment.
Alright, so this one was a bit difficult to write to be honest, mostly because Severus himself is predominantly an observer in this situation which makes his POV difficult. But still, his reaction to Molly’s declaration is important, because it’s so utterly
As if he’d heard his thoughts, Draco looked up and gave Harry the slightest hint of a smirk. Absolutely not then.
It was way too soon that they heard the chiming charm his mother always sent when breakfast was ready, and they reluctantly parted.
Severus stared at him incredulously. He felt something inside him crumble as he allowed himself to truly consider for the first time that Harry Potter might be his son. Suddenly, everything felt too much, and it threatened to overwhelm him.
Sirona seemed to be settling in nicely and after another conversation with her, Harry had to admit that she really did not seem to need a terrarium, but was happy just slithering around the house freely and sleeping in her basket or in front of the hearth. Hedwig fortunately seemed entirely unbothered by the tiny snake and hadn’t attempted to attack her. Harry hoped it stayed that way and took care to give his owl plenty of attention to keep her content.
Harry sighed heavily. They’d have to talk about it eventually, but did he really want to ruin such a perfect morning? Really, that was the only reason why they
“Dark arts,” he assumed. Severus gave him another nod. “How do you treat such wounds then?” Harry almost berated himself for asking, but he couldn’t deny that he wanted to know.
“Oh for Merlin’s sake,” Narcissa muttered suddenly and gave up on the buttons, flicking her wand irritably and vanishing Severus’ clothes down to his pants.
“By killing me, you would secure your position and gain his full trust, while simultaneously ensuring that my death is voluntary, it is a truly elegant solution. Once whoever the task of killing me is assigned to fails, Voldemort is guaranteed to turn to you either way.”
“Yeah, I guess,” answered Harry with a shrug. “I know I could’ve done better—could do better now—and that’s frustrating, but it’s alright.”
“Horace? Horace Slughorn? But he’s a potions master, not a defence specialist,” Severus said, perplexed.
From the way Draco was eyeing him, Severus knew there was no way he could talk his way out of this; the boy could be relentless.
Remus nodded, feeling his own irritation with Albus resurface. Ever since they’d found out about Harry’s past, Remus’ own trust in the man had suffered dramatically. And yet, he couldn’t believe that Albus was an evil man. If he allowed himself to believe that, it wouldn’t just be his trust in Albus that’d crumble into nothingness, but also his trust in the Order—in the entire light side of this war. And if he couldn’t trust his own side, what hope was there to be able to stand against You-Know-Who? Remus wasn’t sure what to think, what to believe.
He shook his head indignantly, downed his glass of firewhisky and refilled it promptly. “Ridiculous,” he muttered under his breath.
The familiar feeling of wolfish protectiveness rose in Remus, and he had to remind himself that it was nothing more than a possibility and there was no reason to snarl at anyone unless they actually did something wrong.
“Harry started to draw runes then, and— Well, honestly I’m not sure what he did, but when he spoke the incantation there was a wave of magic rippling all over you—”
A wave of relief crashed into him and he lifted his head to grin at the others. Their expressions were probably the most comical thing possible given the circumstances. All three of them were gaping at him, frozen. Harry was tempted to ask why, but a sudden groan from Severus brought his attention back to the man on the table and spurred Narcissa and Remus back into action. Draco returned to Harry’s side, looking at him anxiously, as Harry continued to work down Severus’ right arm before moving on to the sides of his torso. The spell was working now for these comparably small cuts, but the bigger wounds were still bleeding. At a look from Harry, Draco, who was the only one among them who didn’t know any healing spells at all, resumed reinforcing the stasis charms on those to give them time to deal with the rest first.
It is a charm to enter someone else’s mind. Once you have mastered the spell itself, we will move on to performing Legilimency without a wand or incantation.” Something must have shown on Harry’s face, for Dumbledore smiled and continued, “Do not worry, it is not nearly as difficult as it may sound.”
Remus sighed heavily as he finished reading Kingsley’s report. Another disappearance, more inexplicable accidents all over the country. You-Know-Who was finally on the move, and he didn’t seem to be pulling punches. The weather had changed dramatically, replacing the summer heat with a constant fog hanging over large parts of England. Remus knew what it meant. The Dementors were breeding. When they’d been under Ministry control, their numbers had been controlled, now that they had changed their allegiance to follow You-Know-Who Remus feared there’d soon be hordes of them. They were difficult to kill. Hell, they were difficult to just
The bathroom he found was bigger than his bedroom at the Dursley’s and seemed to consist almost entirely of black marble. Harry gaped in wonder. Whoever brought him here—probably Dumbledore—must’ve put him into the master bedroom where Buckbeak used to be. Distractedly, he wondered where Buckbeak was now, and how they’d gotten the smell out of the room.
Severus looked up at him, at his son, and once more felt unsettled by how grown up Harry looked. This wasn’t a boy, not anymore. It made Severus’ heart clench when he thought about what must’ve happened for Harry to grow up so fast.
per se, they are merely memories from which certain conclusions seem reasonable to be drawn. It is pure speculation; however well-founded it may be, it will stay pure speculation.”
He should’ve been glad, really. Nobody to talk to meant nobody to ask him what he had done all summer, a question which he could not give an honest answer to. And he was glad that he didn’t have to lie to his friends. It just also happened to mean that he was very, very bored.
“I— If I can do anything for you, all you have to do is ask. I— I’m not sure what you need. Narcissa insisted you needed time to calm down, but looking at you now I don’t see anger. I suppose that should be a good thing, but I’m worried about you, cub. I want to help you, but I don’t know what to do. You don’t have to deal with this all by yourself. You don’t have to deal with anything by yourself ever again.” Remus let out a breath and fiddled with his shirt awkwardly. “I suppose I’ll leave you alone for now. But if you need me, please, come to me.”
He drew his wand so quickly Harry barely saw the movement, then grasped Narcissa’s arm tightly and began to murmur an incantation. Golden threads binding their forearms together shimmered into existence and Severus began to trace them, still continuing the murmured chant. One by one, the threads dissolved as Severus’ wand trailed along them.
“True, but it’s frustrating all the same. You know how I feel about the moods and whims of teenagers.”
Draco didn’t like to be ignored—nothing new, really. Draco showered in the evening, not in the morning. Draco could rival Remus in chocolate consumption. Draco played with the pages of the book when he was reading. Draco hid behind his pure-blood mask when he got emotional, although he did it less and less with Harry. Draco cared about people, a lot, despite his efforts to come across as cold-hearted. Draco actually didn’t mind people touching his hair—at least not when Harry did it. Draco stayed close to him when he woke from a nightmare, silently holding him until he calmed down. Draco did a thousand tiny things that made Harry smile.
—probably, hopefully, apologise if his brain was any good—Harry brought Draco’s hand to his lips and kissed it gently.
“No,” answered Severus, warm relief spreading through him. “Do you—” He hesitated for a moment, before forcing himself to finish the question, “Do you want it to happen again?”
“Okay,” he mumbled, burying his face in Harry’s shoulder. He didn’t resist as Harry manoeuvred them over to the couch, settling them into their usual position to cuddle and read.
Draco’s gaze wandered further in search of Harry. It took him a couple seconds to find him, because for some reason Harry wasn’t standing opposite Weasley who he was paired with, but next to him, gesticulating into the space in front of them. Draco had to suppress a smile as he recognised what he called Harry’s “teaching face.”
Draco’s head snapped up and Severus suppressed a groan. He’d have to tell Lupin again to send owls, rather than a Patronus. While they had ways to prevent any messages from being delivered in the presence of the Dark Lord or his other marked followers, these spells didn’t hinder sensitive messages from being overheard by others that weren’t marked.
to him—but that didn’t mean it hit him any less hard when he moved closer to the cauldron and took a proper nose-full of it.
“Fine, fine.” He took a deep breath, trying to steady himself, and then went on to tell Narcissa everything Severus had said. Not that it had been a lot in the first place.
“Yes, but— What if I fuck it up?” Harry whinged, his confidence wavering again. “I taught mostly friends and friends of friends before, what if they were just being nice even though I was awful?”
It was already dark outside when Harry finally resigned himself to leave the hidden library. He’d spent the past several hours digging through a box full of Sirius‘ things that Kreacher had brought him at his request. He’d wanted for something familiar and Sirius had been the first person that came to mind.
Frustrated, Harry pushed the book away from himself and got ready for bed. He was starving, having forgone dinner in order to avoid Draco. He didn’t want to call for Kreacher again, not after the elf had practically forced Severus’ company on him by extending an unspoken invitation with that tea, but leaving his room and risking to run into Draco was out of the question. Renewed embarrassment and a poorly suppressed twinge of rejection rose in him and he quickly tried to think of something else. He’d just go downstairs early. Really
If looks could kill, Harry would’ve died on the spot. He met Hermione’s glare steadily, until she eventually sighed and her expression softened. She knew when she was fighting a losing battle.
Harry eyed him sceptically. Fred laughed and gestured for them to follow him as he led them towards an inconspicuous door behind the register. They found themselves in a stairway and Harry realised that it must lead to the flat Ron had mentioned the twins now lived in. Fred unlocked the door at the top of the stairs with a flick of his wand and motioned them inside.
Remus frowned, his eyes full of pity. “I’m assuming she was trying to protect you. Lily loved you more than her life. If she believed you’d be more at risk if people knew that James wasn’t your father, she’d have done anything to prevent anyone from finding out.”
He felt tears prick his eyes and quickly tried to blink them away. Draco let go of his hand to pull him into a hug instead and he went willingly, burying his face in Draco’s neck.
Their eyes met. Draco’s pupils were blown wide, swallowing the silver iris, his expression carnal. It merely stoked Harry’s need for him further. After only a short moment of glorious tension, Harry surged up to kiss him, Draco meeting him halfway.
“It’s exactly what I was afraid of,” he spat bitterly. “He saw me with the Weasleys and concluded that I already have a family and therefore he doesn’t have to stick around.”
It was considerably harder now to listen to what the twins were telling him, his eyes continuously flitting back to Harry, who had an intense-looking discussion with the other two parts of the Golden Trio. Blowing out a breath, Draco forced his focus back to product testing at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. Thankfully, his mother and Mr Weasley had joined Draco’s conversation with the twins as well, so Draco’s increased distractibility had gone unnoticed. At least he hoped so.
Remus gave him another quick, hard kiss, then turned and left the drawing room without looking back. Severus smiled and followed. He was very much looking forward to later.
and so confusing. The only thing he knew was that he couldn’t go back to Potter ignoring him completely, not when everything in Draco was just yearning to get that tension between them back so they could break it again.
Ron bristled and his face turned an interesting shade of red. “Mate, are you sure it’s a good idea to trust
“What kind of things?” Remus asked. It probably wasn’t any of his business, but his curiosity got the better of him. He could think of quite a few things Harry might be holding against Severus and he was interested to see which ones Severus thought to be worth addressing.
“I can see that, but it’s unlike you to let yourself be cursed by some flashy jewellery, so I‘m assuming there was something special about it. Should you even be touching that?“
He released the pattern into Severus’ chest, feeling the wave of power leave through his palms as it washed over Severus’ skin. The bleeding slowed immediately. Without wasting a second, Harry picked up his wand again and repeated the healing charms he’d tried earlier. The cut he was casting on closed.
Draco’s resolve was beyond impressive in the face of Harry’s charm on full blast, so much so that Remus found himself reevaluating his opinion of the Slytherin. He’d perceived him as a rather spoiled, entitled child, with a perfect pure-blood mask and little inclination to show any concern for others or raw emotions. Seeing him now, worry etched deeply on his usually impassive face, he seemed like an entirely different person.
The voice calling his name sounded distressed, worried. He knew it from somewhere, but it usually didn’t sound like that. Usually—
“Yes, Harry. Lily’s enchantments ran deep, removing them took a lot out of you. I imagine that’s also why you still have a headache. That, and because you haven’t had any food or water for two days.” Remus drew his wand and flicked it at the door, summoning a plate of food and a can of tea, which he floated onto the little table between the armchairs. “Here, eat, you’ll feel better. Physically at least.”
Draco wanted him so badly. But it would never be possible, so it was better to avoid thinking of it at all, even as he secretly—so secretly he even convinced himself that there was nothing—worried his way through third year during which Potter was apparently hunted by a mass murderer, immediately followed by the goddamn Triwizard Tournament which Potter
A gentle hand settled on his shoulder and he glanced up to see Narcissa looking at him with an expression of grim determination. Her lips quirked into a half-smile as she told him, “I know I haven’t been in your life for very long, Harry, but my son holds you very dear, and I’ve grown to do the same. Anyone who tries to harm either of you will have to go through me.”
“Hi Harry,” said Hermione after they’d settled down, “how have you been?” Something in her voice set Harry on edge.
Another pause stretched between them. When Harry’s itch to fill the silence had almost approached his limit, Dumbledore stood from his desk.
“Of course not, who would be?” Minerva shook her head, anger etching into her features. “Sometimes I wonder what’s going on in that scheming head of his.”
“Well, not Sirius then,” he conceded. “Who else was close to Lily? Close enough to have an affair with her go unnoticed?”
“Remus told you I was at Grimmauld Place.” It wasn’t a question. Minerva only smiled and nodded. Severus narrowed his eyes at her. “You
The two boys disappeared into the house, leaving Severus and Remus behind alone in the garden. Alone for the first time since Severus had gone to Remus’ room to apologise. Severus’ nerves fluttered and he cast a glance over at the other man. Remus gave him a wry smile.
“Actually, his Potions work has improved to near perfection as well by now.” Minerva’s eyebrows rose almost to her hairline and Severus laughed. “I’ve been tutoring him and Draco in the sixth year curriculum. Horace Slughorn won’t teach them a thing if he’s still using the same methods as when I was a student.”
By the time Wednesday evening came around, said lesson plan was so detailed that Harry almost threw it overboard completely. Hermione had written a full welcoming speech for him, reiterating countless times how important first impressions were. The rest of the session was fractured in so many parts and steps that there was barely a minute without a separate point on their list. It was ridiculous.
With Remus momentarily lost in thought, the conversation at the table turned towards the shopping trip in Diagon Alley—Harry was stubbornly ignoring Severus again—and soon enough, the boys excused themselves, disappearing upstairs in Harry’s room. Remus watched them go, idly rolling his glass back and forth on the table.
His hands were tangled in Harry’s hair and he was gasping for air while Harry was kissing and biting his way down his neck.
Harry wasn’t really listening to him, his thoughts wandering to the prophecy instead. Severus had told him that it could’ve applied to Neville as well as to him. For the first time since their conversation all those weeks ago in the drawing room, Harry truly considered what his life could be like, if Voldemort had chosen Neville instead of him.
Draco had long since accepted that Granger was a brilliant witch, and now that his jealousy was no longer clouding his judgement, he found that he quite enjoyed talking to her, to someone like-minded when it came to academics. Not that Harry wasn’t interested in academics—he certainly was these days—but his way of doing things was…different. Granger, however, had exactly the same approach to magic as Draco, and so they quickly got carried away, discussing various arithmantic theories they hadn’t even covered in class yet.
Even though he was startled, Harry felt a lump form in his throat at the ferocity with which Remus declared him to be his. Nobody had ever done that before.
There was another pause before Weasley answered, “Alright, mate. You really mean it? With him? It’s not just…I don’t know, frustration from being cooped up in here?”
white?” Draco interrupted. “Shouldn’t the closest possible bond be completely white? What could be closer than the relation between parents and children?”
“Sounds like she still has that childish energy we already grew out of,” said Pansy with a longing look in her eyes.
“I suppose you’re right, we got a little distracted,” Harry said, his tone half teasing, half bashful.
As already announced, I'll take some time now to build my head start again, so don't fret if the next update doesn't come as quickly - nothing is abandoned, my draft is at over 200K by now and I shall be back.
AREN’T THEY ALL JUST PRECIOUS? LIKE, ALL OF THEM? (Maybe except Ron at this point, but he’ll grow up soon enough, this isn’t a Ron bashing fic.)
Also, naturally, the prophecy is taken verbatim from the books and is obviously not mine in any way.
“You— Are you saying we have to keep our entire relationship a secret?!” Draco cried incredulously. “We’ll barely be able to see each other!”
If it hadn’t been for his enhanced senses, Remus wouldn’t have heard. Definitely more than superficial civility. Remus watched as Draco warred with himself until he eventually conceded, looking resigned.
Opening the tap for his bath, he eyed the various oils and bubble bath options lined on the shelf. They were leftovers from Sirius. A memory of the two of them in this bathtub flashed through his mind, and he blushed, before quickly smothering the thought. It wouldn’t do to get himself all riled up with no way to properly get rid of that energy again. It was always worse around the full moon. Like the animal in him was pushing its urges onto him. Although admittedly, it had led to rather mind-blowing sex in the past.
“It’s really simple actually,” she said nonchalantly. “James Potter isn’t Harry’s actual father, and he looks different because his mother had put a bunch of charms on him to make him look like James Potter and those are now gone. The end.”
“He is, yes. Dumbledore thinks that after Ogden arrested Marvolo and Morfin, Merope grew into her magic and subdued Tom Riddle Senior with a love potion. They ran away together and got married. A few months later Tom Riddle Senior returned without her. According to Dumbledore he must’ve left her while she was pregnant.”
Poor Harry really never gets a break, does he? And Draco just can’t help worrying, the poor little bean. Thank Merlin Narcissa is a fkn QUEEN and knows exactly how her son ticks.
“No, you’re quite right, I did want this plan to stay secret, but I can see that this is no longer an option. Still, the benefits remain the same. Once I am gone, we don’t know what Voldemort is going to do. We need someone he trusts, someone he holds in exceptionally high esteem, who could potentially stop him from doing irreparable damage to our war effort. We need someone who can protect Hogwarts, and given that you have resided there for sixteen years already you are likely to be chosen as headmaster once Voldemort takes control.”
Draco hadn’t meant for it to get heated, but within seconds, Harry had rolled onto his back and wrapped his arms around Draco, keeping him close as they continued to snog. Nimble fingers found their way down the buttons of Draco’s shirt. Draco didn’t hesitate to pull it off his shoulders, revelling in the feeling of Harry’s hands on his skin.
Severus whirled around to glare at the old man. What exactly was he implying? But Albus just stood there, eyes twinkling and his face otherwise unreadable.
Remus spread his hands to say, “there you go,” and sat back with a smile. She rolled her eyes but gave him a smile in return. Then her expression turned thoughtful again.
“As you may recall, Dumbledore wants you to learn Occlumency. I suspect you are now aware how important this skill is for you to learn, unless you wish to repeat events such as those at the Department of Mysteries.”
It felt far more dangerous, in a way that triggered Harry’s Slytherin side, rather than his Gryffindor one. It felt dangerous in a way that made him want to hide instead of charge. But Narcissa was right, there was no way around it. If he wanted to build a serious relationship with Severus, even if only behind closed doors, he had to get over himself and talk to him.
“Yes, yes, very well done you two. Now, everyone read the introductory chapter to antidotes until next lesson. Class dismissed!”
When a knock sounded on his bedroom door barely half an hour later, he knew it must be Remus. He ignored it. There was no point in continuing to talk to the man. The only reason Remus had ever been friendly to him was the fact that he was Harry’s father. As soon as Remus figured out that Harry did not want him, Remus wouldn’t want him anymore either. Best to just cut it off now.
He eyed her for a moment, getting an odd sense of deja-vu, before taking her outstretched hand and shaking it once. Her skin felt warmer than he’d expected.
“Don’t be, I know you didn’t mean it. We planned it, for Merlin’s sake! You can’t feel bad every time we have to do this,” said Draco resolutely. “Your acting is getting better.”
Harry had to take his word for it. Even though his understanding of potions had improved immensely since he’d begun doing his own studies for the subject in the Black library and Severus wasn’t being utterly unpleasant about it anymore, he didn’t want to pretend that he was on Draco’s level just yet. The Slytherin had been top of their class most of the time, only occasionally beaten by Hermione.
an exaggeration to convince me to come here?” Her voice was laced with disbelief and disgust. Draco shook his head.
“You could simply happen to come to my office during Harry’s detention sometimes,” Severus offered. “We could all have dinner together.”
“Harry, it seems that these charms did not only alter your exterior, but also concealed your magical signature. How much do you know about magical signatures?”
For the next hour or so, they discussed various approaches to how they could gather enough evidence for the authorities to be forced to act, preferably without having to ask Harry for his memories as they didn’t want to force him to relive it all when giving them. Slowly, Severus’ anger abated and was replaced by concern for Harry, as well as guilt for his earlier outburst that had apparently triggered his son so badly.
“Open the door to the library,” he grit out, as he tried to keep Dumbledore, who seemed to be at least semi-conscious, upright.
“Keep both your wands timed, just to be sure. Double check the direction every time before you stir. And do
A minute ticked by with no reply from Harry, then two. Draco was about to put the journal away when he remembered the conversation in the common room.
Harry wished he could be angry at them for it, but it did make sense. The less they saw of each other, the smaller the risk that something went wrong and they forgot themselves, at least until they’d gotten used to the charade.
I'm still in exam phase so by posting this chapter I'm breaking my own rule of staying 12 chapters ahead, since I haven't yet finished chapter 20 - but I just wanted this "first part" (aka. the time before they all know for sure) to be wrapped up before going down the rabbit hole of brain damage and behavioural disorders (I study Neuropsychology).
“It’s a pleasure,” Narcissa said graciously, and promptly began to interrogate Molly about Harry’s preferences in the past. If nothing else, those two could at least bond over their shared concern for Harry’s nutritional well-being. It was an unlikely alliance, but Severus wasn’t wholly surprised by it now that he thought about it. Both Molly and Narcissa were mothers at their core, and their first priority would always be their children.
A full goblet of the freshly brewed potion in his hands, Harry hurried up the stairs and knocked on Remus’ door.
“If you must know, I spent the summer in Italy with my mother’s family. Quite a lively bunch these Italians, if you know what I mean,” he said with a wink.
It still sounded wrong, but Harry managed to focus his eyes with some effort, and his vision zeroed in on familiar silver eyes.
Romilda frowned properly this time, and Harry lost the last bit of his self-control and dissolved into laughter, Neville and Luna joining in, while Ginny just grinned at the dumbfounded group of girls. Unfortunately, his outburst had Romilda turn her gaze on him, and after a second her eyes widened. There were two audible gasps as realisation hit the other two girls, but Romilda had already replaced her surprise with a dazzling smile aimed at Harry.
“If only I knew,” sighed Minerva. “Probably puberty, they’ve been teasing the poor girl all week. I wouldn’t be surprised if those two started dating soon.”
After he was gone, Draco turned to Harry. “What do you want to do until this place gets flooded by red-heads? It’s your birthday, we should do something fun.”
“Have you talked to him yet?” Remus asked. “About your history with each other? About the prophecy?”
coming for a birthday celebration, it would be impolite to unpack half the presents before everyone is here. I had the house-elves prepare the drawing room already. Give your gift to me and I shall put it with the rest.”
“No,” he answered thoughtfully, “I don’t think he hates you. He’s confused about it all, he went through a lot in the past—well, his entire life I suppose. You know all the things that happened each year at Hogwarts, and then the Tournament and Voldemort, seeing Cedric Diggory die, the slander the Ministry put him through this past year. It’s a lot for a boy his age. And while I don’t know much about his time before Hogwarts, judging from how he speaks about his relatives—you know, calling them ’the Dursleys’ and such—he wasn’t particularly happy there either. He was very attached to Sirius, he was the first sort-of father Harry ever had. He’s grieving that more than anything else at the moment. He asked me if Sirius would hate him, if he knew.”
Remus was incredibly tired. He’d barely managed to get out of bed, then struggled to stay awake while waiting for Severus and through lunch. It was high time for a nap. Or a bath. Yes, a bath would do him worlds of good, he decided.
I originally didn’t have this chapter in and thought I’d wrap that conversation up as a sort of flashback, but then decided that it’s a bit of a stretch to let so much time pass until they talk.
“Hey, Dad,” he grinned, as he took a step forward to give his father a quick hug. It was still odd, sometimes, even after almost a month of getting used to each other. Maybe it was the mental discrepancy between hugging his father and the fact that Severus was half an inch shorter than him.
Severus was vaguely aware that he’d sunk to his knees again when the pain subsided for a little while. Through a hazy veil, he heard the Dark Lord dismiss the largest part of his followers, before turning back to him. This wouldn’t end well, he could feel it already.
colourful. It was larger than Snape’s and rather more erratic in the way it shifted, branching out wildly at a much faster pace.
“I apologise, I didn’t know it wasn’t supposed to be touched. I’ll tell Kreacher to get Draco his own sweets, and I’ll replace yours, of course,” Narcissa replied smoothly, taking a sip of her coffee.
It did not take long before he felt the tell-tale tense heat of an impending orgasm build in his abdomen, and, judging from how Draco’s hips stuttered, he was equally close. Harry wasn’t really thinking anymore, he moved on instinct, his formerly trapped hand—he wasn’t exactly sure when Draco had let it go—fisting into blond hair as they continued to kiss, the other hand keeping up an increasing pace, imitating the movements he knew he liked himself.
“You’re not hurt?” asked Harry, ignoring Severus’ bewildered look as he walked around him once, checking him over.
Trying to make his inspection as objective as possible he flipped through the pages with closed eyes and halted in a random spot. Dreamless Sleep. A feeling of satisfaction went through Harry as he thought back to how they’d brewed enough Dreamless Sleep to supply the hospital wing for a year back at Grimmauld Place. He definitely remembered how that one worked.
He flipped both of them open, picked up a quill and scrawled a short sentence into one of them, before tapping the words with his wand. The ink promptly changed colour, and, far more importantly, an exact copy of Harry’s barely legible handwriting appeared in the other notebook instantaneously. Draco sucked in a sharp breath.
As every year, he had applied for the Defence Against the Dark Arts post, but he had never heard back from Albus. He didn’t need to; he knew the answer would be no. The reasons behind Albus’ stubborn refusal were beyond Severus, but he knew better than to prod. Unlike Harry, he had no leverage to get the old meddler to tell him things.
Lupin shook his head. “I was one of her closest friends, she spent all her time with us. Lily didn’t even have the time for an ongoing affair, nor would she have wanted to. It actually makes perfect sense if you really think about it. You were her one exception, Severus, you always were. You were the one she made excuses for, the one she defended even though you hurt her so much—even after you stopped talking. How did I not see it? Of course she’d have gone to see you before the wedding, that’s such a Lily thing to do. Grant yourself one last time, before your new life begins. She did it with everything. When she became a prefect, the first night of the new school year she convinced me to sneak out in the middle of the night—one last time. When her and James went into hiding, the day before we did the Fidelius charm she made us all go shopping and have a lavish dinner together—one last time.”
“It’s fine, Draco, I’m fine. It’s all healed, they’re just scars now. They don’t even bother me, it’s alright.”
“Harry,” she said gently, putting a hand on his shoulder, “do you really think that Remus would abandon you? That Draco would? Or I or Severus?”
“You don’t have to defend yourself, Severus. I know you wanted to have this conversation with him from day one, and he was the one keeping you at a distance. But I think we’ve arrived at the point where you can’t allow Harry to avoid it anymore.”
“Severus,” Narcissa said gently, reaching out to him across the dining table, but Severus pulled his hands away and glared at her.
Remus fired a chain of curses at him, followed by another rock and then a second series of offensive spells. Harry caught the first attack only barely and didn’t manage to fully evade the rock, hissing sharply as it hit him in the shoulder. The second wave of spells broke his hastily thrown up shield, but
is sitting here as if that was the most normal thing in the world?” the Weasel demanded. “They’re a family of Death Eaters, everyone knows that, hell, we were almost killed by Malfoy’s father just a month ago!”
He flipped them over in one smooth motion, his mouth still laving down Draco’s throat towards his chest. Long, delicate fingers tangled in his hair, tugging just hard enough to make him hiss slightly. Still trailing kisses down Draco’s pale torso, he glanced up at his boyfriend’s face and the sight nearly took his breath away again. How could anyone be
This used to be shorter, but then I added the little Severus snippet at the beginning because I don’t want to completely abandon those POVs.
“Yeah, I mean, they’re nice. Comfortable, too,” Harry said shyly, a blush rising in his cheeks. Merlin, Draco wanted to kiss him senseless.
Draco could barely think straight, let alone talk, but Harry had found his rhythm it seemed—a rhythm that was sending Draco towards his climax at an alarming speed. He could already feel the tension coil in his abdomen, the sweet heat building—
your fault that Sirius died. I know it isn’t, Dumbledore knows it isn’t, everyone knows it isn’t. It is not your fault. Can you believe me when I tell you that?”
Severus apparated to Spinner’s End and flooed directly back to Hogwarts from there. He needed a drink, desperately. He needed to think.
“Mum hates her, too,” Ginny stated as if that settled the matter. “She’d much rather Bill would marry Tonks. She’s an Auror.”
Harry’s face didn’t betray the surge of indignation that went through him. He loved his friends, but taking his things just like that?
Narcissa disappeared into the kitchen, while the rest of them settled into the dining room. The atmosphere was beyond tense, and it was odd to see Albus sit next to Draco, while Harry was at the head of the table. Fortunately, Narcissa had apparently chosen a dish that was prepared quickly, and only ten minutes later dinner was served. They ate mostly in silence, with Albus politely commenting on Narcissa’s cooking, as well as the dining room renovations.
Reluctantly Draco pulled back, easing his hold on Harry’s hair, and whispered, “People might hear us.”
ever since he’d learnt about him and Draco, but for a good while he had been able to tell himself that they were obviously taking it slow and that he had plenty of time. For some inexplicable reason though, things had changed after Harry’s birthday. Drastically.
Remus watched as the door closed behind him, lost in thought. His cub really had a lot going on, that much was clear. But perhaps not all of it was negative, and perhaps in the end the good could outweigh the bad. He would certainly do his best to make it so.
And Remus did. He recounted how Dumbledore had summoned the Order in the middle of the night, how they had waited for Snape, and how Snape had said he looked like Sirius. At the mention of his godfather, Harry stiffened.
Walking around a rack of dress robes, Harry saw Draco stand patiently on a stool, talking to Narcissa as the seamstress put a row of pins along the hem of his robes. Grey eyes found Harry’s in the mirror and lit up with joy even as Draco froze.
Hermione fell silent, looking thoughtful. Harry felt increasingly uncomfortable under her scrutiny and almost breathed a sigh of relief when a knock on the door saved him.
“Alright,” he said, pressing a kiss on Draco’s hand that he’d been playing with. “So we’ll keep it secret, for now, and when the time is right we’ll tell them. The same goes for my friends.”
“I don’t know, she just collapsed!” Severus had lost his usual composure, looking shocked and lost. Harry grabbed Narcissa’s hand and tried to catch her eye.
“Kibsy, Pipsy, Minny, this is Harry Potter,” she introduced, “he’s the Master of this house. I want you to obey his orders as you would mine.”
Granger and the Weasel had their heads stuck together as they talked in hushed voices, occasionally glancing over at Harry with obvious concern. Gryffindors, absolutely no subtlety.
, and two boys had asked him for a date. Within a week! He hated it. When he’d complained to Hermione about it, she’d merely rolled her eyes and pointed out that he shouldn’t be surprised if people wanted a piece of the Chosen One.
She held the books out to Harry, who took them eagerly out of her arms, and immediately flipped open
Harry hesitated, chewing his lip. The truth was that she was probably right. He probably should tell Severus how he felt, perhaps it could be so easy. But he couldn’t be sure, and he didn’t want to find out the hard way whether he’d be able to deal with a rejection from his father.
Snape looked like he was in pain, scrunching up his face in annoyance while shaking his head. At a flick of Snape’s wand, the curtains flew closed, muffling Walburga’s screams. “I suppose we can skip the introductions then,” he drawled. “Narcissa is a guest of the Order, there’s no reason to point your wand at her.”
the Lord Potter. Just relax, Draco and I will pick suitable attire for you—unless of course you have specific wishes?”
“No but,” Lupin interrupted him. “We’ll figure it out somehow. I gave a promise to Harry that I wouldn’t let go of him again. I meant that. This boy means the world to me, and even if you’re his biological father, you won’t be caring for him alone. You’ll just have to deal with me around.”
Draco bit back a snappy response about where Dumbledore could shove his rules and forced himself to answer calmly, “Alright, then we’ll ask Mother to inquire about it at Gringotts. Do you remember what exactly the scroll there said?”
Harry frowned. He absolutely didn’t feel like sitting at a dinner table in uncomfortable silence with three Slytherins, nor did he fancy spending an hour alone with Snape potentially invading his head.
“Remus of course. Harry was planning to approach you after the feast if I recall correctly. Remus already agreed to it.”
When Narcissa finally cleared the table with a flick of her wand, Draco and Harry got up in unison, with the obvious intention of disappearing somewhere in the house together—probably Harry’s room. And now Severus was going to ruin all their hormonal teenage fun.
Harry wanted to sink into the ground and disappear. He was pacing his room agitatedly, trying to get a hold of the jumbled mess of thoughts and emotions swirling around in his brain. He’d kissed Draco Malfoy.
“I knew you were a Death Eater. I figured you’d have done quite a few reprehensible things. Of course I’d rather you hadn’t told him, I’m definitely not happy about it, but even if you hadn’t, if the prophecy is true it wouldn’t have changed a thing, right? Chances are he would have come after me—or after Neville, I suppose—eventually, for whatever reason. It takes more than that for me to
Harry glared at Snape then, expecting the man to say something, confirming that he’d never slept with Lily, disproving this entire stupid theory. Instead, Snape just sat there, scowling harder than ever, his jaw clenched. Narcissa looked genuinely sorry, but didn’t say a word.
“I just want to make sure you’re really alright, dear,” Molly went on. “This can’t have been easy for you, with everything that’s happened and then with the
him that he wanted to start calling Severus “Dad”, had told him that Severus had readily agreed to it. It still sounded
All those thoughts shot through Remus before the door had even fully opened. Severus had seemingly just come home from his meeting with Albus, looking deep in thought, until—
“You’re afraid that Severus is only trying to build a relationship with you out of a sense of duty,” she continued in his stead. “A sense of duty that might disappear once he witnesses that you already found a surrogate family, and that said surrogate family isn’t about to abandon you. You’re afraid we will all clear the field for them if they don’t shun you, that you can’t have both either way.”
“Then he released me and, after telling me that I should never keep secrets from him again and smashing my head into the floor, left. I managed to activate my portkey, which brought me back here—although I don’t even remember arriving.”
“I must say, though, I am surprised that you allowed Mrs Malfoy bringing three house-elves here. I thought you were unhappy about Kreacher being here already.” The disapproval was clear in Hermione’s voice. That much about trusting his judgement.
“I didn’t aim it at you!” Harry defended himself. “It worked out just the way I wanted, it knocked you off your feet so I could disarm you. Don’t look at me like that!”
Before Harry could answer, Weasley went on yelling, “Of course they did something to you! Harry, that’s
Alarmed, Harry jumped around the corner he’d been hiding behind and took in the scene before him. Narcissa lay on the floor, gasping for air and obviously in tremendous pain, with Severus kneeling beside her, checking her over frantically. His heart clenched. Not her too. He couldn’t lose any more people.
Time seemed to be non-existent, as they kept exploring each other, hands wandering slowly, carefully never straying too low. It was as if their minds were synced, both of them moving in the same flow.
Blaise chuckled and shook his head, but he obliged nonetheless. “The prettiest would be Gia. She’s— What exactly is she anyway? She’s my mother’s sister’s husband’s sister’s daughter. I call her Cousin Gia all the same. And trust me when I tell you, that girl has
The thought kept echoing through his head. After what felt like hours, he pulled away to wipe his face. Cautiously, he glanced over at Severus and found him looking back at him, giving him an uncharacteristically shy smile. The weight that had settled on his chest since the day after his birthday finally lifted, and Harry felt a wide grin spread on his face.
Remus poked his head into the room and informed them that the Weasleys were about to leave, so Ron and Hermione should gather their things. Relieved he jumped off the couch, pulling Draco up with him. He ignored Hermione’s pointed looks as best as he could as they headed downstairs and he began to make his round of goodbyes. When it was Hermione’s turn, she merely said that they would talk about this next time, but let it go otherwise. He knew her well enough to understand that as an additional birthday gift.
Severus’ eyes searched out Harry in the crowd and as expected he saw his son frowning. Harry wouldn’t approve of any sort of age-restriction, not when he had faced the Dark Lord in his own first year.
Minerva looked shocked. “I can’t believe you’re so calm about this. This could change everything! The prophecy— It might not even be about Harry in the first place! It is rather specific regarding parentage. Does this not concern you at all, Albus?”
“No! Stay away from him, don’t touch that!” he shouted, snatching Dumbledore’s hand out of Harry’s reach.
it unsettle him so much? He wasn’t sure. Perhaps it was simply that he was so used to hating everything about the boy that the sudden lack of unpleasant behaviour had startled him. He frowned again. That couldn’t be all there was to it.
After a few minutes of browsing the shelves and knocking into at least a dozen people in the process, a familiar voice called out to him again.
“I don’t think so, Harry. Dumbledore said that there was a hook in the pattern, a sort of trigger that would’ve unravelled it all at some point. Lily probably intended the charms to dissolve when you turned seventeen.”
“Draco,” Harry laughed, “we can’t just go to Diagon Alley, we’re both literally hiding from Voldemort, remember?”
“I do not wish to speak ill of the man you’ve loved and mourned as your father for fifteen years, I know that James Potter grew up and changed, otherwise Lily wouldn’t have married him. But to me, back then, he was the worst man in the world. The man who had tormented me for years, the man who got to marry the woman I loved. I hated everything about him.”
Draco blinked at him, dumbfounded. He’d been planning to convince the other Slytherins to participate in the DA under the guise of harassing Harry; he hadn’t expected anyone to express genuine interest in joining.
“Git,” said Harry, shoving him playfully. “Seriously, though, what do you mean? They’re all simple spells, why
No, perhaps it was better not to tell Severus until their relationship—Draco’s stomach filled with butterflies at that word—was a bit more established. At least then Draco could argue that Severus wasn’t witnessing a mere bout of teenage hormones going rampant.
Pansy squealed with delight and grabbed his hand to pull him over to where Blaise sat with Theo and Millicent. Vince and Greg had made themselves comfortable on the floor, playing a variation of Exploding Snap.
“Mr Potter, I see here that you have inherited several estates, some of them rather recently, but haven’t yet formally claimed either title. Would you like to rectify that, if you’re already here?”
With a nod she picked up her bag from the floor and disappeared up the stairs. He heard a door open and close, then there was silence. Harry stood alone in the entrance hall, trying to sort his thoughts. He’d known that Snape would come with guests, but he had not expected to come face to face with Narcissa Malfoy. And he had most definitely not expected her to be
“That is very kind of you to say,” said Luna, beaming at him briefly, then turned back to her magazine.
“His Mark burned about an hour ago, he had to leave,” he replied, watching concern settle over Remus’ features. “Draco and I finished the potion, but it was almost done anyway and we were really careful. Severus left very detailed instructions and Draco is a genius at potions, he couldn’t have messed it up.”
“Precisely. We shall accompany him on official business,” said Dumbledore, gesturing for Harry to stand and step closer to the Pensieve he’d placed on the desk. He pulled out a small bottle filled with a silvery substance. He handed it to Harry, who removed the stopper and poured it into the Pensieve.
“Back already? Weren’t you going to find Dean?” asked Neville, already scooting up to make space for her.
Harry kissed him, pushing him back into the pillows. Liquid heat shot down Draco’s spine and his attention honed in on the taste of Harry’s lips and tongue. After a few seconds he forced himself to pull back, taking Harry’s face into his hands.
When Harry awoke in his new room at Grimmauld Place for the second time, the sun was already high in the sky. He blinked dazedly against the light, groping for his glasses. When he’d finally found them and slid them on, he frowned.
Harry fidgeted with the cord of his hood, his eyes fixed on their legs. It took him a few seconds until he finally took a resigned breath and began to speak.
Severus felt an immense wave of gratitude for the man. It would’ve been easy for Lupin to simply shut Severus out, to take their antagonistic past as a reason to stay well away from him and let him fend for himself. Instead, there he stood, extending an olive branch.
“Yes, I suppose so. Speaking of things to learn,” she continued, her face lighting up now as she reached into her bag that sat on the floor beside her armchair, “I want to see those healing books you found. I brought you my third year books for Arithmancy and Ancient Runes, though I’m not sure how much good they’ll do you without an instructor.”
The first transformation was easy; expansion, plain and simple. Enough space for Harry’s things, even though Severus knew his son couldn’t actually bring them here, space for a large four-poster bed, a bookshelf and a seating area. It was much like Harry’s room back at Grimmauld Place, only the walls were slightly curved and the windows came with a view of the underwater scape of the Black Lake, rather than a London street.
Numbly, Harry reached out to take a sandwich. He passively registered that his stomach was rumbling and forced himself to take a bite. It did help, he supposed, but his chest still felt hollow. He was struggling to comprehend the full weight of what Remus had told him.
“It’s time,” she said. Harry scowled at her and she smiled, “I don’t like this any more than you do, Harry, I hated sending Draco off every single year—now there’s two of you I have to say goodbye to.”
“I don’t care about popularity,” Harry countered and wrapped his arm around her shoulders, squeezing her in a half-hug. “You’re way better friends than people like them. You stood with me when it counted, believed me, supported me. They didn’t.”
The office disappeared around him and he felt himself surrounded by a stranger’s presence. No, not a stranger. Albus Dumbledore. He let his magic prod outwards experimentally and immediately found resistance.
Harry nodded. “There’s also a privacy spell on it, so you won’t be able to read what we’ve written so far.”
he was tired. Looking up at the table, he saw Narcissa and Remus cleaning the blood off Severus, who seemed to be unconscious again. Or maybe asleep. Hard to tell when Harry’s head was ringing so loudly.
Draco frowned and squeezed Harry’s hand. “Maybe he’s just in a bad mood? Not that that’s a valid reason to treat you like that,” he added hastily, “but it might not actually be because of you.”
Harry’s eyes glittered with curiosity as he followed Severus through the living area. Severus halted in front of the door on the left that led to Harry’s new bedroom and motioned for Harry to go on and open it. He heard his son suck in a sharp breath when he saw the room beyond and Draco’s jaw dropped.
Severus gave him a flat stare. “Frankly, it was less of a change than anticipated. I have you to thank for that, being the spoiled little brat that you are, you’ve thoroughly prepared me for fatherhood. Besides, Harry isn’t a toddler, it’s not like he needs a caretaker.” His lips twitched when Draco rolled his eyes. “It does feel a little strange to be called Dad, I suppose.”
“What? No, of course not. I just—” Severus cringed a little. “Can’t Narcissa talk to him? She’s the one with parental experience.”
More than once he’d shied away from the glorious friction Draco’s body could’ve provided against his hardness, simply because he knew that it would ultimately lead to stripping his shirt. But the worry of Draco eventually being fed up with his hesitancy was growing with every day.
Remus eyed him suspiciously. Severus’ face didn’t give away a lot, but he could see that he was wary and tense.
“Keep it!” Harry said quickly, grabbing the used copy himself. “I really don’t need it. I’m just going to order a new one for myself.”
“How does that make any sense? You weren’t even friends when my mother died, and it’s not like you knew I was—” Harry didn’t finish his sentence. Ah, maybe Severus hadn’t thought this through as thoroughly as he had imagined.
Pansy furrowed her brows at him. She clearly wasn’t buying his act of bored disinterest. Gods, had Draco really talked about Harry
“Indeed,” Severus confirmed. “I’ve transformed it just a few hours ago. There’s a bathroom as well, but I fear we don’t have time to look at that now. The feast is about to start in only a few minutes and you shouldn’t be seen together too much. Draco, why don’t you go to the Great Hall already? We’ll follow.”
Harry felt odd to think such a thing about himself, but he couldn’t help it. He looked like he’d grown up overnight; like an adult. Harry decided that he didn’t mind the change at all, he rather liked it, actually. The only question was: Why had it happened?
Narcissa finally abandoned her spot at the stove and took a seat on Harry’s left next to Draco, while Remus and Snape sat down on the right side of the table. There was a beat of silence, then Remus cleared his throat.
“Draco and Narcissa picked it all out, I barely had any say in it,” he replied, smoothing down the front of his jumper. “I do want some Muggle clothes eventually though. Wizards attire is all good and fine, but a comfortable t-shirt and a nice pair of jeans, or
His knock was answered promptly, if in a rather suspicious tone. He opened the door to Severus’ room and found the man sitting at his desk, a stack of what looked like essays in front of him.
Harry took a moment to let Ron’s words sink in. He knew he had changed. He’d felt it from the moment he’d first woken up at Grimmauld Place, confused and disoriented. But instead of not feeling like himself anymore, the opposite was the case.
For one, Draco had apologised for his involvement with Umbridge—especially the part where he had gotten Harry banned from Quidditch—and explained how his father had demanded that he support her, since she was a means to an end to get rid of Dumbledore from inside Hogwarts. He had apologised for quite many things, all of them so far directly involving Harry. In turn, Harry had apologised for his part in their previous mutual animosity. But they hadn’t gotten to the root of it yet. They hadn’t discussed Ron or Hermione, or the refused handshake back when they were eleven. Harry hadn’t told him anything about his past with the Dursleys yet, and Draco had only disclosed little bits and pieces of his own childhood so far. They certainly hadn’t discussed anything regarding Severus or Remus or Lucius Malfoy and the fact that Harry had landed Draco’s father in Azkaban. Although, judging from how Draco spoke about his father’s demands regarding Umbridge and his dislike of Voldemort, Harry hoped that Draco wasn’t too upset about Harry’s involvement in his father’s arrest. They hadn’t talked about the war, or Voldemort, or Harry’s new nickname in the press. Harry hadn’t told him about the prophecy yet.
Now I'm afraid you won't be fully spared of that dose of angst, it has merely been rescheduled for later, after I give my bois and Narcissa a little breather.
Harry let go of his arm and grinned up at him. “Anything I should know about you and Tonks? She seemed rather interested in your company—and
Harry smiled. That sounded like them alright. His worries appeased for now, he settled deeper into the armchair. This was going to be a long conversation.
“Of course,” Harry replied evenly. “I told you last time already that Draco is a part of my life now, he won’t just disappear again.”
that they were together, rather than announcing it at the same time as telling them about Severus. That gave Draco a little time, and he planned to make use of it by resolving as many issues between himself and Harry’s surrogate family as possible, before they realised that he was dating the Chosen One. He’d apologise to Granger first, mostly because she was the one who deserved it the most, but also because he had been on the receiving end of her anger before and was not keen on repeating the experience. Afterwards, he’d have to jump over his shadow and approach the Weasel.
“Put your wand away, Ron, please. I know this is a lot to take in, but let me explain. Just— Sit down and hear me out, alright?”
“What?” Remus asked, furrowing his brows. “What about Dumbledore? He has some dire consequences coming his way, too, for leaving you there.”
If Harry was bothered by the fact that Severus put Draco in charge rather than him, he didn’t show it. Instead, he simply drew his wand and set it to buzz at the exact same time as Severus’. For a moment, the simple yet elegantly effective variation of the charm made Severus pause in amazement. That wasn’t a spell taught at Hogwarts. That wasn’t even a spell Severus knew himself. He shook his head once, forcing his focus back to the situation at hand. He opened his mouth to say something, but Harry cut him off.
As if the thought had been a command, his notebook chimed. Harry grinned as he read Draco’s message. Dumbledore’s missive hadn’t mentioned how long their lesson was supposed to take, but Harry hoped it wouldn’t be too long — he was fairly sure he wouldn’t be able to focus once the clock hit nine, knowing that Draco would be waiting for him in the Room of Requirement.
