Pansy hugged him, rubbing a hand on his back, rocking him slowly in her arms, humming with the music. “They won’t, honey. And even if they do, we’ll deal with it. I promise you can face it, okay?”
uncomfortable and then, then, the rain! It
He had spent all of his life at the mercy of others' decisions, and now that he was finally starting to taste freedom he found himself owned by someone else. Again.
Malfoy huffed, motioning for Harry to give him the dishes. Harry did and watched as Malfoy scooped up perfect ratatouille and positioned it in a neat order onto the plates.
Why he remained silent every time Harry would kiss him on the cheek to wish him a goodnight, making Draco’s mind go in every kind of direction.
seen it already.”
Malfoy’s eyes shimmered in the room, now almost completely dark in the night. He drew his wand and cast a low
Harry lowered his voice, trying to control the rage rising in him. “I said. Shut. Up. I want to go back, Draco. I’ll-hell, I’ll find a way, I just need your help!”
Draco raised an eyebrow at him. Honestly, that suggestion didn’t deserve a reply.
“You love him, there’s nothing complicated about it.”
On Friday, Potter put to shame everything that could be called a ‘sense of fashion,’ appearing in a pink shirt with flamingos printed on it and light green shorts. That time Potter insisted he was completely sure something was wrong with Lady Luck. Perhaps it was her digestive system? Or her leg? Her eyes or — Draco sighed, trying to explain for the umpteenth time that nothing was wrong with Lady Luck.
Draco didn’t waste any time, his hands flying to unfasten Harry’s trousers. He slid off the couch, landing on his knees, dragging Harry’s trousers and pants together down with him and taking them off of Harry’s legs. “My knees are gonna hurt tomorrow, fuck, but this is so worth it. You’re so beautiful.” Draco grabbed Harry’s dick, giving a long tug, enjoying the groans escaping Harry. With his other hand, he took his wand and muttered a lubricating spell, slicking his fingers and brushing one on Harry’s entrance. As soon as he did so, Harry quivered and moaned, his hand finding Draco’s arm and clutching it.
As soon as he became aware of his surroundings, he heard voices just outside what he realised wasn’t his bedroom, but was, in fact, his living room.
You smirk, pull almost all the way out, then slam in again with more force than necessary. He’s mewling, now, dirty, hot pleas and moans escaping his lips. It’s enticing, and you do it all over again to keep hearing those lewd sounds.
“Christ, fuck—“ Harry canted his arse up, face smashed against the wall. “More, give me more, Draco!”
Just then, he felt Draco stilling inside him, muttering “Fuck, I love you,” as he came, too.
Neville arrived a short time after, sporting one of his bright grins and a green shirt with soil stains.
“I’m not, and even if I’d want to, I couldn’t. Veritaserum, remember?”
In a second, Boo-boo was once again next to them, his lips finally stretched in a big grin. "So you're travelling through time! They finally fixed it!"
You nod frantically. “Yours, oh! Yours, I’m yours.”
“You’re obsessing over Potter again.”
Malfoy nodded — mounting their brooms, they cast Disillusionment charms and made their way back, the tiredness of those hours starting to weigh on Harry's shoulder.
“No, I don’t know. And this is a female turtle, Potter.” Draco finally released the shell and looked directly into Potter’s perplexed face. “And she’s gravid.”
you had a treehouse at the Manor."
Harry and Draco started telling their story, ignoring Geremia’s grumbling, trying to be as precise as they could be. They left out how they discovered they loved each other, but told them all about their continuous hopping from one timeline to another; how they thought there was a pattern but never found it; about Boo-boo; and how they realised their trip had been predestined.
“When you lick things before eating them. Mind you, it’s disgusting and unhygienic, and I don’t dare imagine what happens in your stomach but—” Potter rolled his eyes, huffing. “— but, er, I kinda like it.”
It's not like Harry had a problem with alcohol, if anything, he had a problem with people and often used alcohol as socialising fuel; and that usually meant he was fucking with strangers whose names got forgotten the moment after orgasm.
That obviously led to total chaos, with people crying in every corner of the Unspeakables’ rooms, with increasingly dangerous pranks from the more ambitious. Until eventually their Head of Department, Unspeakable Croaker, had to put a stop to the pranks when a unicorn was found flying around the Love Room offices, sending papers all over the place and knocking everything out of place in its haste to find the way out.
Ginevra looked furious. Her nostrils were so wide Draco thought he saw smoke coming out of them at one point. Harry saved the situation once again. “A year,” he whispered. His voice started to sound broken too.
“Wake up, Harry!” Ginny’s voice pierced through Harry’s ears, making him open one eye to look at her. He felt pain in every muscle of his body.
He knocked on the door, waiting only a few seconds before it opened itself into a large lounge. Didn’t Malfoy have a secretary? Why was no one receiving him? Huffing at Malfoy’s eccentricity, Harry entered the lounge, looking around. It was minimalist, green and cream like the exterior of the building. It was a stark contrast from Malfoy Manor's Byzantine style, but it was regal nonetheless and screamed Malfoy from every wall.
“You pervert, you—” Malfoy pushed his arse into Harry’s face and cried out. “I’m
“I may have found a solution but I also may not have permission to talk about it."
All he did was moan. “These pancakes are glorious. What are you, the Pancake King?”
Draco held up his chin and led their way to the dance floor, wrapping his arms around Potter’s waist, pulling him closer, fed up with trying to control something that was clearly out of his hands. Potter was only mildly surprised, almost instantly bringing his arms around Draco’s neck, laying his hands at the nape of it.
“How often do you need me to give you orders?”
Harry snorted, feeling like a stupid teenager who laughs at stupid sexual innuendo, but also couldn’t help it. Malfoy’s cheeks tinged deliciously red, his eyes bulging out of his head.
you to strip down,” Harry said, feeling bold— more so when Malfoy’s face reddened up and his lips parted in a shocked ‘o’. He toed his shoes off and Harry added, “I’m kidding, of course. It’s just weird to keep your shoes on, since we’re going to be confined in here for who knows how long.”
Potter backed up, smacking his back against the wall. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, Draco!”
Huffing, Harry looked at it closely —yep, it was a cock, complete with veins and little blobs of come at the tip— and made to move to give it to Gary. “For you,” Harry said, laughing.
Harry shivered — lately everyone had been so scared to hurt him that no one had come closer to him than two feet away and unexpectedly feeling someone else's body heat and breathing ghost over his ear made him whimper. Even more so, when that someone was an incredibly good-smelling, attractive blond ex-rival turned righteous all of a sudden.
Draco Disapparated in front of the door of The Three Broomsticks. It was usually where Harry and Draco would meet and he spotted Harry on the sidewalk next to the pub as soon as the last cell of his body returned to its place.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow and stepped into the kitchen, sitting at the table. “C’mon sweetheart, just tell me.”
“What? WHAT! Am I really that horrible? I
But then again, it would be hard to make bad toast with jam.
It worked. Ron sighed and slumped on a chair, grabbing a piece of toast. “Not yet,” he said, spraying bread crumbs all over the table. “But I wanted to tell you myself that we’ve found a lead. I think we’re close to finding those bastards.”
“What do you think you’re doing, Potter!” Malfoy screeched indignantly.
"This is serious business, Boo-boo, kids aren't allowed."
“What if the two of you meet,” he asked, voice rasping, “and you don’t like them? Or they don’t like you? Or…” Potter leaned in even more closely, personal space be damned. They were in public, for Merlin’s sake.
He returned to look at Malfoy, waiting for the next instruction. Letting go of his cock, Malfoy moved closer to Harry, pushing him onto the bed, pinning his hands above his head, straddling his lap.
Harry winked, the cocky bastard, squeezing Draco’s hand. Draco smiled when a thought occurred to him.
Just when he had decided to grasp Potter’s face and snog the fuck out of him, Potter retreated, face flushed, eyes heavy-lidded.
His chest tightened as he felt an irresistible urge to drop on his knees and swallow Malfoy’s cock in one go. He felt mad with arousal, feverish, squirmy. He wanted to
“Well…I guess we could still go?” Harry said, his smile widening despite his efforts. “D’you reckon the balloon could make it to Paris?”
sign at all of lies. But he couldn’t find anything other than openness in his face.
“So you started licking cocks and eating come instead.”
Harry didn’t know what he expected to hear after this confession, but it surely wasn’t a sudden burst of laughter from every single person in the circle.
His good mood cracked almost immediately, though.
He inhaled deeply, overwhelmed. After years of reclusion, his senses were on edge. Another composition started playing, Vivaldi’s “Primavera” — his mother’s favourite one. His mother, now lying helpless in a cell at Azkaban. Draco tightened his grip on Pansy’s hand, his breathing already faltering. “I don’t know, Pansy. I don’t know. What if people, what if they see that, what if they discover that my... that my life is different now...”
Malfoy snuggles closer to Harry, pushing his cold feet in the middle of Harry’s, making him yelp as always because who the fuck has such cold feet and is still alive?!
Or Draco would often lay on his stomach on the bed, his fingers working inside his puckered hole, and Harry would watch behind him, stroking his own cock until he released his hot come all over Draco’s arse. Usually Draco came untouched by Harry, streaming his hot come on the sheets, moaning the most beautiful sounds Harry could ever imagine.
But no. This Malfoy is only Harry’s to see.
Draco pulled a face, mocking him. “Well, it is to show affection in public. And — ” He disentangled from Harry’s embrace. “I missed you too.”
Harry wanted to shout.
Ginevra and Tori stuck their tongues out at them and Tori opened her mouth as if starting to speak when James interrupted them all. “Can we please change the topic? And put that thing away, Hermione, for Merlin’s sake! Why am I even here today…”
Astoria was still reading it for the tenth time. “I’m not giving them any interview!”
When he opened his eyes again, Harry was shivering, cold air seeping through him. He couldn’t have slept for more than a couple of hours but the warming charms he and Malfoy had cast had probably weakened during their sleep.
After the first three weeks like this, Draco looked like a ghost in his own house. Every little noise would make him jump, make his heart pound madly in his chest, ringing loudly in his ears. That’s how Pansy found him the first time: crouched on the floor, silently crying.
How could someone possibly like licking salt like that? But Potter looked entirely unfazed. Once he finished, he picked up the slice of lime and... Draco’s insides jolted, his face suddenly on fire. He could feel droplets of perspiration at his nape. Had someone just turned up the thermostat?
"Right, I thought so, I just wanted to check."
Harry looked at Malfoy, taking deep breaths, focussing on his lips and the reassuring words that were coming out of them. Soon enough, he found himself both calmer and aroused.
Getting up from the bed, he went to the window of the room, curtains still pulled. He clumsily opened them, shielding his face from the bright light of the sun.
No. Draco Malfoy couldn’t just ignore him.
is the only love I have, Pansy. Food. Well, bloody perfectly prepared food.”
“We already said this is the last round! C’mon buddy, truth or dare?” Seamus again. Was someone bewitching the game?!
Draco felt his cheeks aflame, his eyes going wide as saucers. He didn’t have the time to form a coherent reply before the waitress arrived, bringing the bottle of wine, pouring it into their glasses. Draco sighed, welcoming the momentary distraction. He took a sip, trying —unsuccessfully, judging by the light fits of laughter of both Pansy and Sarah— to bite back a moan.
Leaning so that his arms bracketed Harry’s head, Malfoy lowered and took Harry’s mouth in a slow, sweet kiss. His tongue dragged lazily on Harry’s bottom lip and Harry heard himself mewling, honest to Merlin,
All other rooms in the Manor felt dirty, wrong, full of Dark Magic, of a ruined life,
If it was as usual as it appeared, there was a good possibility that he and Malfoy wouldn't have to put up with each other for long.
“What!” Harry bellowed, making the orange juice he had just sipped go down the wrong pipe and causing him to break out into a stream of coughing.
“I mean that I drew some basic characters to adorn the walls, but the paint will change based on Teddy’s wanting and thoughts and on the stories I’ll tell him.” He smirked at Harry, looking smug. It sounded rather impressive, indeed.
But he shrugged and grabbed his Invisibility Cloak — he probably calculated the hours wrong.
Harry stopped, frozen, right when they were passing through the window doors of the kitchen, a house-elf cooking dinner.
Pansy muttered “Oh, Merlin” again as Draco’s head began to swim. Ah,
“Spill the tea,
“I… grew up with this.” He pointed to their initials, his hand trembling. “I always thought it was some kind of magic… like, some kind of bond? I don’t know. I was so little, I had no idea of what was possible and what not. I thought that ‘H’… oh Merlin, I thought it was some kind of fairy magic, that someone had etched here the initial of… of…”
Why he remained silent every time Harry would grasp his hand and drag him out of Hogwarts as soon as the first rays of sunshine appeared, to go to the Black Lake and swim together.
“But they target muggles, don’t they?” Harry looked up at Malfoy whose eyebrows were drawn together. His words passed quickly in Harry’s mind:
you, D-Draco. Gods, yes, more,
Harry started laughing quietly. “Yeah, they are like ferrets, but magical, because they can talk. How did it become that, though? I mean, I don’t think the ferret episode is a happy one for you, right?”
goes to Mr Priddy!’, Draco inhaled deeply.
Three months in, and every time Harry looked at Draco he felt his heartbeat quicken. While at work — selling flowers to all kind of souls — he thought about Draco, was he fine? what was he doing now? Every time Draco spoke, Harry’s gaze was fixed on his lips, every moment they spent together Harry tried hard to make him laugh to see his dimples, to hear his joy. Sometimes he’d try to speak some Parseltongue too, which made Malfoy more flushed than amused, much to Harry’s pleasure.
,” Harry had whispered into his ear, tilting his head, trapping Malfoy’s earlobe into his mouth.
With a deep sigh, Harry moves his gaze to the Slytherin’s table, immediately locating Draco. As if sensing Harry’s stare, Draco raises his head and his eyes bore into Harry’s.
Harry still didn’t know what to do with his life, but at least now, looking at Malfoy laughing, he knew right away whom to share it with.
He needs to come again, but he’s exhausted. Malfoy takes Harry’s head in his hands and raises it to look into his eyes.
Potter raised an eyebrow, looking unimpressed. “When I do what?”
“Pansy!” He whispered a moment later. “First of all, shush, do you want all the restaurant and so the entire wizarding world to know? Second, I’d like to remind you that it’s
Harry felt embarrassment take over his body; he wasn’t the good one with stories, Draco always invented them and used the right words. He was clumsy and banal, but… an idea crossed his mind. He didn’t know how that would go, but it was worth a try.
“I need you too,” you say. “Did I ever thank you?”
As if Harry didn’t know, as if Harry hadn’t kept updated on everything Malfoy had been up to in the last five years, and didn’t know he was the best man for this situation.
He put a hand on Harry’s, soothing him. “Do you have a vague idea of how hard it was to change my Patronus? I read billions of books on the topic to see how the fuck to do it and in the end, it wasn’t even worth it! My Patronus became… that fucking beast… Jarvey, you called it?”
“I want you to take both of us.”
They chewed in silence for a few minutes before Malfoy’s head turned heavily towards Harry, his eyelids half closed.
“Yes,” Malfoy ground out, narrowing his eyes. “Although, actually, I hadn’t finished the potion, so I’m not sure about the effects. Maybe it will wear off quicker, or maybe slower, or maybe… maybe we should go to St. Mungo’s,” he concluded, straightening his shoulders.
Trying to ignore the embarrassment for how much he was liking it, Draco searched Harry’s gaze, holding it. Harry was panting, and he looked as aroused as Draco. He leaned toward Draco’s face, licking his bottom lip, breathing on it with a weak voice, “I love seeing you like this… you really like big fat cocks in your arse, eh? Who would have known…”
.” Ginny was now looking at him, her arms crossed in front of her chest.
“I just… don’t know. Pansy is hard to get? How do I impress her, how do I make her notice me? She’s a
Harry tried to answer him kindly but after a couple of hours together, finally asked Boo-boo to leave him alone. He needed time to himself. He wandered through the city, that Muggle London he now knew like his own pockets. It was a cloudy day, the smell of rain heavy in the air.
, it was the first time someone did that to me.” Harry gasped at Malfoy’s fingers now slipping in so easily, so known, familiar.
“You’re a git,” Harry murmured, astonished. Was it really that? Jealousy? “And now? Me and my Auror adventures?”
At Harry’s words, Malfoy’s lips twitched into a half smile before he shivered. Ron cleared his throat, shaking his head slightly.
Draco reached her hand on the table and lightly stroked it. “Um, honey, that’s not it. I mean, I guess you could say it, on some level. We are retiring, indeed, but not from Hogwarts. On the contrary, Hogwarts could be a totally new home for us now, it’s the place where everything started and it makes sense that, now, after all these years, Harry and I — ”
That caught Astoria’s attention as she raised her head and shared a worried look with them. “Should I call them to check if they are all still alive?”
He kissed and bit and licked, nudging Harry behind the ear, the lobes, trailing kisses on his cheekbones, his jawline, biting on his collarbone. Harry groaned, pushing up toward Draco, feeling their cocks bumping, and trembling at the new feeling. He dreamt of this for so long, he couldn’t believe this was true.
“Mr Malfoy! How nice to see you!” An old lady in a razzle-dazzle rose tube dress was waving her arms madly in the frames trying to get Draco’s attention. He recognised her as Mrs Darsley, a fourth-degree cousin from his father’s side. He had studied the entirety of his genealogical tree as a kid —pure-blood traditions— but had forgotten most of it, due to the numerous generations contained in it.
Draco turned to Harry and smirked, like he’d read his mind, the git. “See, that’s how you should talk to me.”
cast an illegal ancient bond on me and so now I'm no longer in charge of my life again… this idiot isn't findable anywhere and, what does that mean anyway? And why are you still calling her Granger? And why did nobody think of waiting for me to wake up to… to…”
"It was okay, we saw our past-selves in St. Mungo's, no one saw us and we thought of some ways to disguise for our longer trip. But there's something off." He squared his shoulders, looking directly into Hermione's eyes.
Potter snorted, amused. “This is a Muggle song! I know it, Hermione is fixated with the movie… wait… ah, what’s it called…”
A violent rainfall started plunging a second later and they rushed to swim out of the water, collecting their clothes and finding shelter under a big palm tree, laughing like teenagers who’d pulled off a prank.
Finally alone, Draco fixed everything: the fireworks shrunk and in the pocket of his suit; the tickets tight in his hands; the flowers all positioned in the living room, red roses and sunflowers — Harry’s favourites. They’d be the first thing Harry saw once he crossed the threshold of their house, together with Draco in Harry’s favourite soft green jumper and their suitcases in front of him, a banner floating above them, ‘Joyeux Anniversaire, mon amour.’
With a quick swish, Boo-boo shot through the door and exited the room, faking gagging sounds.
bring us back."
“No,” is Harry’s disconsolate reply. He really can’t pinpoint any precise detail about that night.
, while Malfoy was just—
By the time he reached his home, snow had started falling again, covering the ground in a thick layer of sparkling white. The sun had just dipped below the horizon, casting dark orange streaks to colour the snow, making it look like a field of poppies. Draco shook his head, flicking the door open.
Harry gulped, then nodded.
Now, twenty-seven years later, Draco was pathetic, he knew it. But he still couldn't avoid thinking about Potter, about what they’d had.
Pansy, a strained smile on her face, trying to downplay the curious faces of the people around them as she cleared her throat. “Draco, calm down, we’re in public.”
“Fuck it, Potter! Give me the time to explain!”
“Beautifully gay.”
Harry wrinkles his eyebrows and turns to him, watching him retreating. Why the hell was he apologising?
“Oh, you do. Have a dance with me. As a thank you, of course.” Potter’s eyes gleamed in a dangerous way and Draco felt himself getting hard, his gaze dropping to Potter’s lips one second before catching his eyes again.
Potter smirked, his teeth showing. It shouldn’t look so appealing but for Draco, it sparked his arousal.
They moved on to different topics, but the thought of Malfoy remained stuck in Harry’s mind. He really wasn’t that obsessed with him, right?
He lined the tip of Draco’s cock against his hole, slowly pushing down onto it, taking it all as his mouth dropped open, his eyes fluttering shut briefly.
Shit.
, they had said.
"I know you’re feeling… ambiguous towards Malfoy, but be sure to listen to him, Harry. He knows what he’s doing. I'll meet you there. Try to sleep! Goodnight!"
"Who said anything about the Manor?" Malfoy smirked and closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, his chest expanding and stretching his black uniform, drawing Harry's eyes.
Harry stopped laughing and looked at him again. The lights of the fireworks crossed his face, dancing on it, playing with his breathtaking smile, reverberating on his eyes, his piercing.
"Boo-boo, if you're basing your maturity on how much time you’ve spent with us, then you're doomed."
Draco nodded, his stomach churning inside and making him feel nauseous already. A sixty-year-old man shouldn’t put himself in situations like this, and yet, here they are. Harry was right; it was about time they were honest with their wives.
"I'm just surprised, that's all."
Harry followed him just seconds later, pumping hard and fast with his hand on his cock, smearing their stomachs with come.
?” Honestly, Harry was starting to lose his patience and the fact that he was hungover and famished didn’t help any.
He just stood there, staring down at Harry, arms crossed on his chest. Whatever he thought he was doing wasn’t working because—
Slumping back on the pillows, Harry exhaled slowly, feeling a pang of anxiety in his stomach.
A furious wank, a call to Pansy and an impromptu lunch at Sweet Prophecies later, Draco was bouncing nervously in his seat.
“N-no, I mean, I, erm, not grey, they, erm, white blond, it’s—”
And regular as clockwork, Potter would show up every day, Lady Luck in tow, in various degrees of dress.
Draco sneaked a hand under their table to stroke Harry’s thigh. “Can you believe that we had a house together and we didn’t even know we loved each other? We are idiots.”
He continued, “I’ve loved you so much, Tori. So much. You are the mother of my child, the woman with whom I shared this house and my life for the last thirty-five years. But… the passion. The… fire. It was never there for us, was it? At first, I thought I was… broken. I thought I wasn’t able to feel those things because of the Dark Mark but then, slowly, with Harry — I felt
“Oh, lord,” Harry murmured, scrubbing a hand through his hair. “I do like beer, but I can enjoy a good whiskey when needed. And I’m positive I do not have a canteen!”
“My therapist taught me that too.”
Draco mouthed an “exactly” as she shook her head and led them to the Thought Chamber to actually get some work done.
"I… don't think so, Boo-boo. Our mission is solved. We know where Jacob is and… but I'm sure you'll find other friends!"
Now Potter’s mouth opened in a comically wide ‘o’ of surprise and Draco couldn’t hold back a grin. Draco felt his lips curving into a smile against his will — Potter’s always been like this, easily amazed by the simplest of things.
"We haven't met in twenty-six years and we live in the same city, our kids go to the same school. Instead, we meet where, in Bacalar?"
“Potter! Of course you’d be the blind idiot who didn’t see the bloody sign on the door!”
They entered and chose a little table at the end of the shop, Malfoy casting sideways glares at Boo-boo.
This time Malfoy did smirk. “Rarely.” He licked his lips. “—
Everyone’s looking with sympathetic faces at Draco, but he doesn’t buy it. Yes, it’s true Harry had fled out of Draco’s room this morning without saying a single word, but Draco had assumed he was embarrassed or at the very least just a giant tosser.
Harry snorted, arse clamping tight around Draco’s cock, causing Draco to moan.
Draco smiled, wide and sweet. “Let’s do this.”
"Harry, language! There are kids with us!"
Harry nodded. The corner of his lips quirked up and he brushed Draco’s hands with his own. “I know it’s all horrible and I shouldn’t feel like this. But… I am happy. We can be together for real now.” He closed the gap, looking furtively around for passers-by and captured Draco’s lips in a brief kiss.
They laughed together, embarrassment palpable in the air between them. After a moment of silence, Potter sighed, fidgeting with the dish in his hands. “You changed the doors at the entrance.” He jerked his thumb towards them. “They’re beautiful. Is that cherry wood?”
Harry stared at them, his heart racing, making his contaminated blood rush to his head. He could feel heat all over his cheeks and ears before even speaking. “I— erm, y-yes.” Damn. Damn, damn, damn.
In hindsight, Harry knew he should have told him about it; they always negotiated everything together, they had rules and safe words, and this felt like breaking their equilibrium. But thankfully Draco appreciated his initiative, confessing to Harry that the idea of giving him total control over his body turned him on so much he asked for more. He easily accepted Harry’s fantasy, asking only to avoid penetration.
You should be running out of this situation, this mess. Potter clearly has got something going on: he’s drunk, alone in a Muggle pub. You should get out. But you can’t. You never can, with him.
Potter stopped briefly, raising his head and giving a firm nod. Draco took the opportunity to inhale deeply, his hands cupping Potter’s arse cheeks. Dear lord, they were so round and squishy and perfect.
“I don’t know how long the spell will last but if I understood correctly, it’s meant to kill the slave if they try to run away. It’s kind of like orders keep them… alive.” Malfoy paused, taking a deep breath. Harry could only imagine how the magnitude of the spell was weighing on him. Before he could tell anything to Malfoy, anyway, he spoke again. “I honestly have no idea how often I need you to give me orders, though, and I learned how to cook the muggle way after the war.”
“Take care of her and if you ever have the slightest of doubts, contact me. In any case, I’ll come to check on her in three days.” Draco hesitated just a fraction of a second before handing Potter his card.
^^^^^
“How dare they call him ‘former Death Eater’! After all this time! It’s outrageous!” Astoria was yelling, she still hadn’t seen Harry and Draco arrive.
He considered going to Potter at Grimmauld Place, but he had no idea what to say. ‘Hi, I’ve been an idiot, please let me fuck you?’ didn’t sound like a good punch line. Or maybe he’d get a
Potter licked his lips, collecting the cherry sauce with his tongue, and swallowed calmly, his Adam’s apple bobbing deliciously. Draco’s breathing faltered and he felt his fear increasing. What if… Oh no, what if these events weren’t Potter’s fault, but —
Draco’s breaths quickened in anticipation of a kiss that felt inevitable. He closed his eyes, leaned in…
He stepped in and closed the door behind himself. The lights were off and Draco decided to leave them like that for the time being. Maybe it would be easier to talk if they couldn’t see each other. He approached the bed and sat on it, right next to Astoria. She didn’t make a move, nor acknowledge his presence.
Bending over, you take the fabric in your teeth and slowly roll it down Potter’s thighs. He moans, pushes his dick in your face.
“Fuck you,” is the first thing you tell him. “Just, fuck you,” you repeat, sobbing. He blinks, arches his back to take you deeper.
You’re writhing on that sofa, pitiful pleas escaping you, but you don’t care. “Please, please, please, please,” you chant, desperate. “Make me come, please.”
Potter chokes on a laugh, groans, “Yes,” and, “More,
“Seriously, Granger? You want to use us as testers of something you have no idea it can or will work?!”
“Let me finish!”
“What the hell are you doing?”
Potter looked over at Draco, shaking his head, his eyes glinting with… fondness?
, hanging just over his head and his friends scattered throughout the house, beers in hands and smiles on their faces.
“I saw the way you were looking at that dildo…” Harry unfastened Draco’s trousers, tracing with his fingers the shape of Draco’s cock over his pants.
“I mean… no sleeping together. I don’t want any complications,” Potter had declared.
“Already so sensitive,” Malfoy whispered, hands still now. “You’re so beautiful, sweetheart.”
“This house is terribly unkempt, so much dust, spiders. I wouldn’t be surprised to find boggarts in here—” Malfoy’s voice reached Harry as his steps down the stairs echoed through the house.
“Well, anyway, I… I have things about Voldemort that I can’t reveal. What if— if someone takes advantage of the situation. I can’t, no.”
Harry blinked three times and then finally dropped his gaze to his own coffee. "No. Why should I? I hate him."
He was being sarcastic, Draco knew it, but his brain was addled by the feeling of Potter’s hand on his back, by the heat of his body so close, by the smile, not sad anymore, on his face. Draco opened his mouth to reply, trying to come up with something ironic, when a singing high-pitched voice reached them.
They were lame excuses, Draco knew it, but it didn’t restrain him from heading to the bathroom and searching for Potter.
His face lit up with a big grin, the one that made his dimples appear again and Harry giggled affectionately — Malfoy was always acting like a cold, uptight man, but Harry could see he had a soft spot for Boo-boo.
He tried to sound sure when he spoke. "I wanna be ready for when we'll be back home."
and it's really useful, especially if you often hang out with Muggles or in Muggle areas."
When he opened them again, Potter was petting Lady Luck’s shell, regarding Draco with a worried expression. “Are you alright?”
Draco chuckled, an all too familiar warmth pooling in his stomach, a warmth that spoke of Potter and love. “So, Lady Luck spoke tortugatongue to you and told you she wanted to see me. How nice. Tell her… I missed her too.”
Harry's jaw slacked open as Malfoy burst out laughing, actual tears wetting his long blond eyelashes.
Harry’s senses felt overwhelmed by Malfoy’s touches, his light gasps, his firm voice, his permeating scent. He growled, desperately trying to move his hands, to touch Malfoy, to have something, anything more than this, his cock throbbing achingly in his pants.
Harry’s best friend, and his career, and basically his whole life?
A moan escaped Draco’s lips; it sounded desperate — he had been aroused too long. “I, aaah, I don’t know what you’re talking about…”
"You still fly?"
“Ghost?”
“Not, that’s not…”
Zabini’s eyes widen and he looks alarmed. “Look, Potter, I didn’t say anything to anyone. And why would have I, since I’m not the one you fucked,
“You’re asking me if I wanna come! Oh for Salazar’s sake, of course, I’ll come with you to an event with plenty of stellar food and renowned chefs.” He paused for a bit, thinking. “Wow, do you think Greta Catchlove will attend, too? I love her cheese casserole.”
Harry smiled and jumped sat on the bed. He couldn’t wait to go meet
Harry stills, chewing on his bottom lip. Should he go after Draco? And tell him what? ‘
Malfoy shrugged—bloody hell,
“What is it, Draco?”
The room suddenly sunk into golden shadows. It was getting closer to sunset, and the orange-y colours made Malfoy’s skin glow.
"Ugh, I'm out of here!"
Touched Draco while he was dreaming, helped him… helped him come. And maybe he could have done something with him asleep.
Draco snorted, opening his mouth to say something scathing, but Harry quickly went on.
“That I am part of his life, that I contributed to form what he is today. And then he said… he said I was being courageous tonight. I am not a bloody Gryffindor, Pansy.”
“I’m home!” he said, and it was all it took for Harry to immediately feel relieved. Harry felt his shoulders relax a fraction while a suspicious warmth spread on his cheeks at hearing Malfoy calling Harry’s flat ‘home’.
Harry started undressing, slowly pulling his Auror robes off like he knew Malfoy liked it. “Watermelon,” he replied. “
Two years ago, in that hospital bed, Malfoy had opened immediately to Harry’s kiss, clinging to him as if his life depended on it, silent tears rolling over his cheeks.
After an awkward moment of silence, Malfoy clicked his tongue. “Can I talk now?”
He and Malfoy exchanged a look, and Harry could see on his face the same embarrassment he could feel in his gut. They slowly nodded, never taking their eyes off each other.
When he opened them again, Harry had kneeled in front of him, his eyes filled with tears, a big smile plastered on his face.
He brushes his nose behind your ear. It tickles you, making a giggle escape you. “For what?”
Draco stood up, the chair dragging on the floor with a disturbing noise.
He looked at Boo-boo, a fake smile in place. "Please?"
He needed to work, he loved his job, he loved dinners at Ron and Hermione, seeing Teddy, Andromeda—
Harry wondered when he started feeling butterflies in his stomach watching Malfoy do the simplest things, like buttoning up his shirt.
“But I have to,” she replied, calmly. She put a finger under Draco’s chin and raised his head, making them lock eyes. She smiled, soft and sweet. “It’s been more than a year, Draco. Potter already knows everything about you.
Draco furiously shook his head and hesitated, “N-no, I really don’t think we should show you. No no. Umm… Tori? What, why?” Draco couldn’t resist the amused smile that was pulling at his lips.
“I don’t believe you,” Harry said out of desperation. “If that’s true, then show me your real powers.”
The first rays of sunshine were coming through the windows and they couldn’t avoid the confrontation any longer.
Hermione and Geremia's hands quickly darted up, in an 'obviously' gesture, reminding Harry of Snape.
“So…” Harry clears his throat. Fidgets with the hem of his shirt. A rumpled, extremely rumpled shirt. Unfortunately, Hermione notices.
Potter snorted, shaking his head. “Draco, are you alright? You’re stating the obvious.”
“Draco,” Harry started, not knowing how to talk about it without fighting again. “I need you to stop bringing all this negativity to us. There’s a pattern in our travels, I know it and—”
You grit your teeth, push your cock inside him. Fuck, it hurts. If it hurts for you, it must be hell for him. You look into his eyes, but they’re closed. He’s biting on his lips, his hands crossed on your nape, nails digging into your skin.
“I take it you’re feeling well,” Blaise said, a warm tone in his words.
Harry’s temples almost exploded right there from his increasing blood pressure.
The words from Harry’s Healers rang in Harry’s ears.
Before Malfoy’s words could sink in, Harry’s eyes fell to the clock on the opposite wall of Malfoy’s lab. “Oh fuck, look at the time! Harvey will kill me!” Harry rushed to Malfoy’s desk, taking out the prescription for the potions they needed that week. “Look, I need—”
By that point, Draco’s brain was mush, his ability to think reduced to nada. He must have mumbled something because Potter stopped, turning his head to Draco with a perplexed, then surprised, expression.
“Hey, Rookie.” Ron clapped a hand on Harry’s shoulder and winked.
It was all so sickeningly sweet, Draco wasn’t even sure he’d be able to tell anybody what happened without getting diabetes. Draco clicked his tongue and stepped back, trying to get a good look at Harry’s face. Harry wore a mischievous look, one that Draco was sure was plastered on his own face as well.
The Greengrasses go back home, then, and you remain alone with your mother. She looks at you; it doesn’t reach her eyes.
“It’s sweet, isn’t it?” Draco murmured onto his lips, Harry could almost taste him.
A handshake. Sure. Was Pansy serious? But Draco had no time to fully think about it. In a blink, crowds of people started entering into the Manor, and Draco’s mind blanked out, with only the thought of keeping it all together, grin, shake hands and politely indicate the way to the room where the Auction would take place.
"Is this the first time you’ve used this Time Machine?"
Harry joined them walking further into the forest, until Malfoy stopped and cast several cushioning and warming charms at a tree. He sat, leaning his head back on the trunk and exposing his long throat, lit up by the orange light of dawn.
“Don’t ever feel ashamed of it with me. I gave you full consent, you know I like it. I just… I’m afraid I’ll always wake up, you know?”
She moved towards a package on the table and picked it up. “Before we start eating, we’d like to give you a gift that Tori and I bought for you. If it’s a thing for weddings, it should be for divorces too, right?” She held it out to them and raised an eyebrow, defiantly. Tori was right next to her, laughing up her sleeve.
“Whatever, just do it,” Harry said, colder than intended.
“You are beautiful with your hair like that,” Harry blurted out and then cursed himself for always saying the wrong thing in the wrong moment.
“Breathe? You know you like it.” Harry could hear the smirk in Malfoy’s tone, but a second after, he was stepping back, the lack of his body heat already painful.
After a minute Potter sat up too, straightening his clothes. He sighed, yawning widely.
Harry’s breath faltered and goosebumps ran down his spine while Malfoy turned his head, nodding to Harry, still delicately singing…
Harry felt his face and ears warming up at Dean’s suggestive tone, especially at his emphasis on the words ‘under’ and ‘care’. Everyone was snickering and giggling and Harry rolled his eyes, trying to be subtle.
Malfoy raised a brow but didn’t comment on it. “Right, so… Should I go back to my potion…?” He straightened and brushed his hands on his scrubs.
Draco opened his eyes, his vision blurred as if he’d just woke up after weeks of deep sleep. He sat back on his heels, his body a trembling mess. As his vision cleared, he could see Blaise’s silhouette, right next to Pansy, looking worriedly at him.
, Malfoy—”
‘Tough’ didn’t even start to describe how it had been for Draco, but he couldn’t say it out loud. He found that he couldn’t say anything out loud if he wanted to avoid crying in front of Potter. Again. He clenched his jaw and closed his eyes in an effort to calm himself down, a hand absent-mindedly brushing the pendant…
Harry sucked Draco’s cock in earnest and Draco woke up with a start only at the very end, choking out a confused, “Wha’? I… oh fuck, I’m coming.”
And then he’d left, returning to his own home.
She scribbled something on the piece of paper while Draco’s lips widened in an involuntary grin and he clapped his hands.
He sipped the tea losing himself in the waves rippling on the white crystalline sand, the milky reflection of the moon on the deep blue of the ocean and memories of emerald eyes boring into his soul.
“It’s not our fault, though. We may have been a bit clueless, and we may have tried to make something dead work, but they cheated on us. I am so angry, so fucking angry. Why aren’t you, Tori?”
Glancing one last time at the iron gates at the far end of the garden, Draco sighed and walked to the room where the guests were milling about, glasses of champagne in hand, brilliantly entertained by Blaise, Pansy and the waiters.
Potter immediately reached him, fishing Lady Luck out of his breast-pocket again and laying her on the table. "What can I say, I can't resist you." He threw a smirk at Draco and stuck out his tongue.
Draco’s voice was strained, nearly hysterical, and he wondered for a second if being surrounded by so many Gryffindors all the time was starting to affect him. Then he remembered that time when he was twelve years old, and his father asked him if he had finally beaten Potter at Quidditch. Draco had choked on air, grasped the edge of the table and blurted, “Yes! No! I don’t know, don’t kill me!”
He turned his head toward Malfoy to glare at him but almost immediately snorted at his impressed face.
Harry’s hands dropped lower, caressing Draco’s sides. His look was almost predatory now, a look Draco knew was the one that allowed Harry to be
"Thanks. You too," Draco said as he watched Potter go, turning one last time to show a shy smile for Draco before closing the door behind him.
“‘Mione… I have no idea. I-I feel like shit…” his vision blurred with dizziness again and his skin felt like fire was chewing at it, making even contact with his clothes almost unbearable.
asleep?”
“It was Goyle. He didn’t do it with ill intentions, okay? A-and, well, you’re a moron, because you immediately jumped to the conclusion you slept with Blaise, so I’m wondering if that’s because you actually like him. Or, I don’t know, I just… Yesterday night at the prom, you see, I thought, you said—”
Hermione's practicality did nothing to soothe Harry's nausea. With a sideways glance, he saw Malfoy finally breathing evenly again and some pink returning to his cheeks.
That night Harry cried for the first time since the War. They were angry tears, tears full of rage, heavy, burning on his skin.
“Actually, we’re done, right Greg?” This time Draco’s glare is all for Goyle. Goyle nods, lowers his eyes to the floor. He sets off for the castle, murmuring “I’m sorry” when he passes Harry.
Malfoy’s head snapped to him, eyes wide. “You’re kidding, right? Do you want to end up like Weasley begging Fleur to go with him at the Yule Ball? And yes, I was there when it happened. It was pathetic.”
Draco’s head snaps to him and the tendons relax. His cheeks, though, look even redder. Every trace of hatred he’d displayed earlier in the Great Hall is gone.
Astoria abruptly sat up on the bed; Draco heard her gritting out, “
— with a package in his hands. You’re sitting on the sofa, not paying too much attention to the book on your lap.
"What the fuck did he do to me!? Fuck, fuck!" He stood up, kicking the chair backwards, starting to walk in circles in Malfoy's office.
Now that he had started, Harry couldn’t stop talking. “I’m not sure I like being an Auror, I’m tired of the expectations people have for me. Everyone seems to be moving on, marrying, having children, succeeding in their careers, and I’m just… wandering. Lost.”
They came out to all of their friends the next day, inviting them over for lunch, telling their stories with beer, coca-cola, popcorn and Draco insisting they should all watch
“Oh, lord,” Harry grits out. “No! I don’t know why… we… well, it’s none of your business anyway!” And that’s just the truth, right? Because Draco’s not Harry’s boyfriend and Harry has no obligations towards him. Except Draco looks hurt now, and Harry’s heart clenches painfully.
“Merlin, Potter, relax,” he said with a languorous voice, his feet still massaging Harry’s groin. “No, it doesn’t. I knew you were oblivious, but not to this point! We’ve been working together for the past two years. I always,
Realisation hit him like a Bludger in the head. Draco gritted his teeth, hating that Hermione had fooled him once again.
almost felt like an insult. Worrying his bottom lip, Draco decided he needed to know
Harry smirked, grabbing a pillow and shoving it under Draco’s back. “We’ll see,” he breathed before ducking down and with the flat of his tongue licking a long stripe from Draco’s balls to his arsehole.
“Harry…”
Not like, tenderly. Just.
“Right, I don’t want that,” Draco continued. “This is sex, so let’s work to make it perfect, shall we?”
"Mmmh, apparently, me." Malfoy seemed to be lost in thought when he added, "and what's a porn movie?"
“Fine,” Malfoy said, moving towards the counter where a melted cauldron was quietly bubbling. “Poor Harry Potter, I’m sure no one would resist, knowing you’re intoxicated by Veritaserum.” He waved his wand towards the door, locking it, and then towards the mess on the table to Vanish it. “If in an hour the effects aren’t gone, we’re going to the hospital, though.”
Draco felt his heart thud against his ribcage. “The fried nuggets of salmon and balls of Cheddar? Salazar, fuck me.”
Draco sighed, lifting his eyes to look at her. Pansy was his oldest friend— she never, not once, judged him, not even when they were fourteen, the Yule Ball had just finished and Pansy had dragged Draco to his room, kissed him, and then looked at him with watery eyes as he apologised, crushed, telling her he didn’t like girls until they ended up on the floor and he cried like a baby in her arms. If Draco could talk to someone about this, it was Pansy.
She sighed, the curve of her lips dragging down in a sad frown. “That it must have been a nightmare for you all these years. You told us you cheated on us during this last year. What about the previous ones? Why, why in hell did you let yourself go through all this pain? I am wondering, Draco, when did I give you the idea you couldn’t confide in me and tell me your feelings. I would have understood. I would have, Draco!”
“Ah! Seamus will be happy! He and Dean won the bet,” Harry says suddenly, snorting at the thought.
Turns out twenty years are quite a lot, but thankfully, the memories from the time they’d found Jacob and Louis were still intact. A few instructions and the Aurors were able to find them and bring them to St. Mungo’s where Harry and Draco were impatiently waiting for them, the adrenaline of the moment amplifying everything.
Potter smirked and asked, “Why don’t you let me show you exactly what I can do with my tongue?”
The next few memories Harry had were confusing and cloudy as if wrapped up in cotton wool.
“I can’t believe you’re still such a prat! Who cares? This isn’t a disaster, I’m having fun! And… the tension’s just gotten to its best, don’t you think? If you don’t fuck me right now I’m afraid I’m gonna have to do it myself.”
“Sorry,” Harry had murmured, not feeling sorry at all. “It’s just so fucking hot.” It really had been, probably too much. The idea of being able to command Malfoy to get it hard, to come, hell probably even to pee. Harry’s head had spun.
“You called me ‘Harry’.” Harry’s voice was equally low, his mouth so, so close, Draco was having difficulties thinking but he needed to know, right now.
And so, Harry’s mood was determined when Harvey sent him into Malfoy’s lab to retrieve the potions they’d need for their most recent case.
You can feel your cheeks burning up. He’s usually the one wearing make-up, and it’s the hottest thing you’ve ever seen, but you? You’re too milky, your features don’t go well with it. But he’s looking at you intently.
“I like you naked more,” Potter growls. His eyes are almost black now, he’s kissing you everywhere. You shiver, moan, beg him. “Fill me, fuck, fuck, yes, do it,” you keep saying as he lubes the dildo and starts pushing it into your hole.
“He was part-Veela,” Ron declared over lunch.
Slowly, Harry starts talking again. “Draco? What does he… I, um. Someone Confunded me this morning,” he adds because he needs to rely on the little things he’s sure about.
He shook his head and closed his eyes, too, trying to think about positive things. They'd be back home soon, and he'd have his bond removed, and a free life again. Finally free of falling in love with anyone… if only he was able to love. He'd been single for so long, he was starting to fear he couldn't love at all.
matured!"
Harry entered Harvey’s office, yawning profusely, to find his partner asleep at his desk. Harry snapped the door shut, waking Harvey up, shooting him a forced grin.
“I think you’re attractive,” Harry said before he could convince himself out of it. “More than. You’re bloody gorgeous.”
"Potter, I don't know if you're understanding the gravity of the situation. This bond can be broken only in the presence of both of you and you may want to break it. Potions can only do so much to reduce your pain, but they can't make it disappear and… if you ever fell in love with someone, you could never marry them or bond with them or even have sex, touch, hug,
“Malfoy? What…?”
At that moment, Harry was sure he hated Malfoy more than he thought was ever possible. How dare he
“I’ve spent the entire match staring at your arse.” Someone should definitely put a stopper on your mouth sometimes. But Potter seems to like it.
"Ahem, I think you should start calling him Mr Potter or Harry if he's your patient now." Hermione's voice was playful, and she directed a wink at Malfoy while saying so, eliciting a blush on his face.
Malfoy was looking at him with an amused grin and Harry shook his head. “Go get the firewhiskey,” he said, rolling his eyes.
He took out his phone, in time to see Neville’s reply on their WhatsApp group.
As soon as they stepped foot inside, all his willpower crumbled once more. Draco grabbed Harry’s arm again, making him stumble backwards. “I can’t. Let’s run away. You and me; we’ll build our lives together somewhere else, somewhere far away. Please, say yes.”
Even though, Draco had to admit to himself, it would be simply too stupid  — even for Potter — to plot something that ridiculed oneself this much. Tuning in to Mr Serkin’s words again, ‘for 10 thousand Galleons,
“Sure, sure.” Ron slipped away from Harry’s grip, running to the other side of the living room, mouth close to his mobile. “So guess who—” he started speaking, laughing his arse off in the process. “—guess who just admitted, yes admitted!, that Draco Malfoy is… how was it, Hermione? Ah yes,
“Yes, love, scream for me baby, make me feel how much you like it.” In a long smooth thrust, Malfoy’s cock was buried deep inside Harry’s arse. It was like going back home, different, unknown and yet sweet, familiar.
Everyone else in the room was looking at him with expectant eyes, ill-suppressed giggles and smirks, and Harry knew he couldn’t endure another round of honesty.
Harry looked at her with his eyebrows raised, a snort escaping him. "First, how many times have you been here?! Second, hi Hermione, how are you? Third, of course I can believe it, you know how Ron is."
Needless to say, the morning after they were both walking funny. Harry had never had so much sex in one single night.
and moved onto a different project.
Ginny shook her head, a look of pity on her face. “You’re supposed to be the Gryffindor number one, Harry. The bravest. You faced Voldemort and you won. And you shit your pants for what? Because you couldn't tell me and the other Weasleys you’re gay? It was a squalid move to continue our marriage, Potter.”
“What?” Malfoy’s voice had softened, descending like silky honey on Harry’s skin.
, Potter’s not wearing any underwear.
“Err, I mean, unless you like it?” Oh, fuck, and where was this coming from? Were they really doing that?! Harry took a big gulp of firewhiskey and looked at Malfoy with wide eyes.
Now that he was this close to the real possibility, though, Draco didn’t know what to think. Why did Pansy tell him to read it with Harry? Were they someone Harry knew as well? Ultimately, did Draco really want to know the chef’s name? It might have been Draco’s obsession for a year, but it seemed less important now.
, to a gigantic dragon appearing from nowhere and swallowing Potter alive, right there in front of everyone, in Draco’s house. Well, technically, it wasn’t Draco’s house anymore, right? Shaking his head, Draco realised he was mere inches from Potter and his knees almost gave in.
Who knew what, or where, he meant. At this rate, Potter’s book would never be ready.
Malfoy raised his gaze biting on his bottom lip. He was about to say something when his eyebrows shot upwards and he gasped.
Then one morning an idea implanted in Harry’s mind — he told himself he was doing it for Draco, to help him start the day
"Woah!"
Sometimes Harry would look over at Draco and know instinctively what he’d do.
After that moment, they started talking more and grew more friendly. In hindsight, Harry should have recognised some Veela-like signs, even before
“Undress,” he instructed, his voice gentler now. “The safeword, sweetheart?”
Harry felt Malfoy’s hand brush his back, slowly, hesitant.
Harry smirked, hooking his index fingers in the waistband of Malfoy’s pants and slowly dragging them down his legs, salivating as soon as Malfoy’s cock sprang free and hit Harry’s cheek.
He laughs— it’s intoxicating. “That’s about the idea,” he drawls. Then, “Fuck me like a whore,” he whispers. “Ruin me, fucking ruin me, Malfoy.”
“Shut up! Shut. Up! We have three children. Three, Harry. Do you care to tell me how is this even possible if you are… what, gay? And, oh yes, do you think I believe even for a second your story that you’ve been cheating on us for only a year? You absolute wanker!”
“Potter, if I’d known what you can do with your tongue, believe me, we would have done something better than fight each other for seven years.” His voice had been all rasps and growls; Draco struggled to recognise it himself.
Potter turned around, glancing at Draco through half-lidded eyes, the green almost gone, replaced by the deep black of his pupils. “So eager, Malfoy, and now stalling?”
Malfoy, however, was unrelenting. He kept scratching his nails over Harry’s ribs and now Harry’s legs were struggling too, his toes curling so hard he’d felt the first cramps radiating from his feet.
“I don’t know what you’re trying to imply, Dean. He’s just helping me breaking this stupid bond.” He knew they wouldn’t let it go the moment Luna wiggled her eyebrows and scooted closer to Harry, careful not to touch him.
He’s staring at it, transfixed. “Look at you,” he says, biting on his bottom lip, grasping his cock in a tight fist. “Begging like a filthy slut.”
, but he learned that waiting had its rewards with Malfoy.
Draco grabbed two flutes with champagne and offered one to Pansy, with an eyebrow raised. She took it, frowning at it, sipped slowly. When she spoke, her voice was trembling.
like the most normal thing in the world.
Malfoy waited patiently for Harry’s cough to settle down. As soon as he could breathe again, Harry gaped at him, taking in the faint blush covering Malfoy’s cheeks. Damn, but it was a cute sight.
The silence that followed his words was louder than a Hippogriff shrieking.
“Lick the rim of your glass,” Harry said without thinking. Malfoy raised one eyebrow, muttered, “you’re weird,” and proceeded to comply with Harry's order.
At that point, they shared their fatherhood, in every way; their children used to call the other “papa”, Ginevra and Astoria finally formed a friendship of their own, helping each other out during the week when Draco and Harry were at Hogwarts — and then Harry and Ginevra had had their third child.
Draco didn’t answer, he just kept staring at his glass, mind full of one word. Harry.
“I hate you,” you add in his ear for good measure. Before you can drop your head to his neck or his chest again, he captures your lips with his.
Draco had gripped the blankets for dear life. At this rate, he had no idea how long he would last, but he had to make this perfect.
He needed to stay calm but he could feel panic starting to rise again and it usually didn't lead to anything good.
"A snake?"
Harry swallowed sharply, his Adam’s apple bobbing in a way that sparked fires in Draco’s veins. He shook his head to clear his mind; this wasn’t the right moment to get turned-on.
Harry shook his head, his cheeks on fire, but Luna went on.
Draco went to sit next to them, skimming a hand through his hair. “I’ve known for a while now. But no, I wasn’t doing it only for Harry and me. Listen, I know we’ve fucked-up greatly, but… well, I hope we can find a solution together.”
Harry’s scent wrapped around him — he smelled of sweet cherries and lilies. It was dizzying, it was addicting. Harry kissed his nose, his cheek, his jaw. He breathed on his neck, “Wait for what?”
Draco knew his feelings were stronger than a normal friendship would usually entail, but he never thought anything about that. They were married, they were ex-nemeses, there was too much history between them.
Harry’s eyes widened and for a second, his cock started to wilt. Surely, he didn’t mean to double penetrate him, right?
He quickly stood up, taking Lady Luck with him. "Make sure to take something for your headache! I’d better go now. Have a good night!"
That’s why he was so nervous when he arrived at Dromeda’s. Draco still hadn’t arrived, so Andromeda left the instructions about where to find food, how to change diapers, the right temperature for baby food and such, to Harry and then went out with Narcissa. They were trying to rebuild their relationship.
“I don’t have a canteen—”
The gardens were worthy of the Palace of Versailles. They had visited it the first year they arrived in France and now Harry couldn't help but think that Draco had lived like a prince.
"Erm, how do we get in, now?" Harry asked, studying the door. "Jacob would sense every spell we'd use to get around the door and enter…"
It wasn’t long before Harry and Malfoy found the pair in a dusty room on the second floor, Jacob explaining what happened to his friend — a certain Louis, who helped him with the plan. Harry wasn't sure as to why.
He finally untied Harry’s hands, positioning them in front of Harry, so that Harry was now leaning his weight on his own arms. That’s when one of Malfoy's hands came to Harry’s throat, grasping it as he knew it would have sent Harry over the edge in mere minutes.
“Draco, I could never hate you. Please, just go to sleep in the living room. I can’t take anything more.”
"Okay. We'll try a longer trip now, okay? Mr Malfoy, do tell us if you notice signs of malfunctioning or anything else you deem worthy of notice. You'll stay away for three hours, in the three-days-ago timeline."
Draco cleared his throat and straightened up, trying to assume a serious stare. He could still feel the tickle in his stomach, his chest, cheeks… “Erm, I’m afraid so.”
“Something’s wrong!” Draco hissed loudly, the people from the adjoining tables to his turning in surprise. Draco didn’t care. He was still in shock from his morning.
Harry smirked — or he hoped it was a smirk, considering his state of intoxication — and hissed something in Parseltongue.
thing to order Malfoy. Fuck, he wondered what that told about him. Most decent human being, Ron had said. Somehow, Harry doubted that.
“Christ,” Harry said, taking a deep breath himself. “Yeah, definitely.”
Draco, however, hadn’t forgotten about Mrs Darsley. She had a turbulent history of rebellion, one that his father was never happy telling; she was the shame of the family. Born in 1867, the Victorian rules soon started to be too strict for her, who loved pretty girls and slinky dresses. Draco shook his head — in hindsight, she had probably been the only sane one in his father’s bloodline.
Who would have guessed that this would be what breaks Draco Malfoy.
“Boo-boo,” he called again and the kid finally met his eyes.
“Wait a moment, you horrid beast. You have a problem, you lick everything! Since I’ve known you, even at Hogwarts, before eating— and strangely enough, you did it with weird random things like books or quills too. It’s your thing. How the fuck can you be a chef?”
Harry entered the house with the warm trepidation that he learned to associate with Draco by now and as soon as he stepped foot in, Teddy ran in his arms, screaming with joy. “Harry! Dray surprise!!” pointing towards his room.
Draco shook his head, repeated to himself he was
Their eyes met and held. A warm feeling settled into Harry’s chest; they had reached a point where they could understand each other without words.
Draco decided to completely ignore the treacherous voice in his mind that suggested he’d missed this, he’d missed
The Malfoy in front of him got closer unbuckling his belt, taking Harry’s chin between his thumb and index finger, pulling him in a heated kiss. Harry’s brain shut down, he was sure Malfoy was right behind him, still fucking into him, brushing his prostate over and over again, then who was now kissing him, making him tremble?
She gasped, sounding offended. “First of all, don’t call me that!” Draco cracked one eye open, to see Pansy narrowing her eyes at him. He smiled, stuck out his tongue and closed his eye again.
From that moment, the discussion moved onto more carefree and lighter topics, and by the time they fell asleep Harry felt better, his last thought something about soulmates and a curly-locked Draco kissing him.
“Go on, love. I’m listening.”
Harry opened his eyes to see Malfoy’s normally composed face slightly undone, his eyes crinkled at the sides, lips tight as if he were trying to resist talking or laughing himself.
.” Harry glared at Hermione and she shrugged, bringing a finger to her lips and miming as if she was zipping them up. “As I was saying, I’m worried I may have— I don’t know. Used my Allure to pull him in. Herm, you should see the way he looks at me sometimes, and—” Harry groaned, burying his face in his hands. “He keeps saying it’s the last time we’re going to see each other, because honestly, it’s me and him. We don’t make
He stopped, bringing a hand to cover his mouth, his eyes widening. “Oh, fucking Merlin’s blue balls,” he whispered, staring at Harry.
^^^^^
Malfoy hadn’t missed one spot. His voice hadn’t faltered
Astoria turned her eyes to him, narrowing them. That wasn’t the right moment to joke, evidently.
“Their crowns…”
"Oi, don't look at me like that! I'm kidding, he's all yours."
“Stop it! I really mean it, he looks like a fucking ghost in it!”
Harry woke up with a start, seeing Draco’s wide and scared eyes fixed on his. The damned Time Machine was hauling them once again, if the annoying stomach ache he felt was anything to go by. He shut his eyes, feeling Draco huff, “Oh no,” when they disappeared.
Harry left Malfoy and Boo-boo arguing about pretty much everything Boo-boo had learned in his years of time-travelling to look around himself. He couldn’t recognise the place they were, so they very much weren’t back home.
Draco blinked several times in confusion, scratching the cuticles of his nails absent-mindedly. “Me? A school… woah.” He took a big breath and started again. “That’s… actually a brilliant idea. But… how can Hogwarts be a shock? I mean, if you’re a wizard certainly you know you’ll attend it?”
As they were drinking coffee and hot tea in their hotel room — “Did you remember…” “Two teaspoons of cold milk and one of sugar? Of course, Draco. I knew how you took your tea when we pretended to hate each other at school, I know it now that I love you.” — the unpleasant feeling of guts wrenching hit them and they braced themselves for another Hop in time.
“That was— completely another level...” Malfoy breathed out when his hole stopped clenching and his breathing evened out. He turned to Harry with a smirk. “...Master,” he added, a glint in his eyes.
Harry had hidden his face behind his hands when the cashier had looked completely unabashed at Draco, their eyes emotionless. “Let me guess, you want a
It had always been like this, for the last thirty-five years. Draco and Harry had found themselves co-workers at Hogwarts, teaching respectively Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts. They were both newly married, and it had been hard at first to get along.
Slowly, Malfoy slid backwards until he bent down, his face mere inches from Harry’s cock and Harry saw the exact moment his eyes glinted mischievously. The feather perked up swiftly, and a devilish smile appeared on Malfoy’s face.
Draco stopped, feeling his chest tighten, his voice faltering away. He closed his eyes, trying to hold back tears.
Lately some thoughts, some memories, wouldn't leave Draco's mind and when he drank a bit too much they became more and more intrusive.
Harry looked at him puzzled, but did it anyway. He didn’t feel like contradicting Draco too much in this moment. He pointed his wand and etched their letters in the wall:
ruined life. Voldemort’s shouted commands and the cries of the tortured and killed victims still echoed in every corner of the house.
Draco turned the page and found himself in front of the poll responses. He started reading them, rolling his eyes at the notes the readers had sent Pansy. They were all so useless.
He turned towards his clone.
Draco grinned, taking a sip of the wine. What did Pansy call it? “Ronald would agree with me.”
This time the tone didn’t let any space to the imagination; it was a command, one that Harry was more than happy to comply. He stepped out of his pyjama bottoms, climbed onto the bed and settled himself between Malfoy’s legs.
They hurried to pay their order and ran to an empty alley, their breathing still ragged when the unpleasant wrench brought them back to their real timeline.
Harry laughed — there was at least something good in this mess. Something vibrated in his pocket and, before he could get his hopes up that it was his wand signalling they were going back, he palmed his mobile through the fabric of his trousers.
“This lunch has just become more interesting…” Scorpius elbowed Albus in the ribs and they giggled together. “Yeah, I mean, it’s our dads we’re talking about but… let’s see the thing, now?”
Twenty years. Twenty years with Draco Malfoy, nineteen of which they spent in love, touching, craving each other, whispering endearments, learning each other’s bodies and souls by heart. Was it their limit? Nineteen years was the expiration date on their relationship? Harry closed his eyes as several other tears joined the first one and the rain started pouring furiously, drenching him.
The glasses of wine were served first. Hermione sipped hers before sighing. “Well? What do you mean ‘squirmy’?”
It was adorable.
Hermione shakes her head. “No, Harry, but we can assume it was one of the Slytherins. Maybe the guy you went with did it himself.”
“Nggh,” the pleasure was overwhelming; Draco broke the kiss, gasping for air. The tickle was starting to become a roaring fire inside of him. Harry looked up at him through his lashes, his pupils blown out with lust, his lips still tantalisingly close to Draco’s. “Again, kiss me again, please.”
Draco Apparated right into the middle of the living room. Astoria wasn’t there and he didn’t hear a single noise in the house, nor see any light. A sudden nostalgia hit his chest so hard that he had to lean against the wall, closing his eyes, taking deep breaths.
He huffed and opened his mouth to say something but Harry didn’t hear him: he felt the unpleasant wrench in his gut and his chest tightened as Malfoy looked at him in panic.
You come, as foreseen, and a second later you hear the sounds of his wet hand furiously tugging on his cock. You want to see that; you turn your head, look over your shoulder and watch as his perfect, thick cock peeks out of his fist, spasming, painting everything with long shots of cum.
Malfoy glared at Harry as he delicately slipped the snakeskin from the envelope. He sighed. “Look, this is stupid, let’s just—”
“Sure, I called him Leonardo, like the ninja turtle, you know?”
Harry looked at him with a perplexed face, waiting for him to add something but he simply stared into a point slightly over Harry’s shoulder and then flicked his eyes to Hermione.
Right when Draco thought his face would have melted under the heat of his blush, Granger said, “He needed to use the loo. Ah, excuse me, I’d better find Ron again before he shoves the entire decanter down his throat. Last time he did, it didn’t end very well for our Persian carpet.” With that she stalked off, her turquoise dress billowing behind her.
will be the one walking funny tomorrow.”
Fuck, he missed home.
“That I could order you to come like I did before… like…
The medi-witch approached Harry's bed and gently smiled at him, performing some basic diagnostic spells as she started speaking.
“Of course we can. I know you won’t believe it, but my father built it. I loved it, Harry. I always used to play here with my friends.” He started climbing the stairs and Harry followed him, images of a little curly-haired Draco playing in a treehouse with his friends soothing his heart.
After that day, they established some sort of routine. It became all so sweetly domestic, Harry almost didn’t realise that
"He's not
“I see. We should have seen it coming.” Pansy sighed, rolling her eyes and winking at Draco. “Is it his body? Because honey, honestly, I don’t blame you. He certainly filled out well.”
Their time together flew by and soon it was evening. Andromeda tried to insist that Malfoy stay over for dinner, but he refused, saying he had to go back to his mother. Malfoy’s
Still, Draco couldn’t help but wonder. Did Potter spend his time with someone else this week? Was he offended? Angry? Did he not want to see Draco anymore?
“We only fuck, Potter. I don’t need your psychoanalysis when we see each other.”
Harry stood, sending the stool to crash to the floor. “No, now we’re doing this. What you said, that’s not… At school, you surely acted like someone who hated me, and now you barely look at me when we meet.”
“Damn, I didn’t mean to…” Harry tried as Malfoy held out a hand.
Harry looked at him, taking a deep breath and kneeling next to him. He whispered a healing spell, the only one he knew to ease nausea, and Malfoy finally breathed, wiping the tears from the corner of his eyes.
Malfoy’s face remained perplexed as he said, “Tell me a lie.”
“Potter, for crying out loud! Let me finish, at least.” Malfoy bit on his bottom lip, seemingly searching for the right words. “Do you like being an auror?”
Not alone? Did it mean that…. Did Potter have anything to do with it? What kind of information, what kind of project?
Once out of the building, as memories of the exact location of the building were abandoning Harry, Malfoy turned on his heels to glare at Hermione.
“We couldn’t… look I’ll explain later but this needs to happen right now or Malfoy, he’ll—”
Everything seemed to stop. The ticking of the big wooden clock hanging from the ceiling, the whispering of the diners, the frenetic waiters, everything. Draco’s own breathing stopped, stuck painfully between his ribs. He saw Pansy’s lips move but couldn’t hear anything coming out of them.
Barely ten minutes later they were at Ron and Hermione’s house.
“I missed you too.” Harry blurted out, realising only in the exact moment the words left his mouth that this was the reason he still hadn’t pushed Malfoy off, still had wanted to give him an opportunity.
“How do you want it to happen, then?” Harry asked, leaning in so that his lips brushed against Malfoy’s with every word.
“Don’t go, I want you, honey, I want you again.” He wiggled his hips to make Draco feel exactly how much he wanted him again, his cock still hard at the thought of having Draco all for himself.
Draco looked down, holding Potter’s hungry gaze. He knew what it meant when Potter arched an eyebrow while biting his bottom lip.
But, as it was now becoming natural, a few days later the upsetting feeling of being wrenched away hauled Harry and Draco from their French idyll to transport them back to London, again. It seemed to be their full circle: every time they’d been transported to some new place, they would then be transported back to Muggle London, only to be transported far away after a while and then back to Muggle London again.
Draco swallowed, willing his voice to come out even. “Bye, Potter.”
“Unhygienic.” He dragged him down again.
“Sometimes I think we are too old for this stuff, but you are so hot...” Harry’s voice was rough, his hard cock already straining against Draco’s thigh.
In the beginning, Draco had tried to find a pattern to the time-travel, but soon gave up when he resigned to the idea of travelling through time forever. Harry still tried to make hypotheses and find links, but it was getting too frustrating, after all those years.
“Wait,” Harry interrupted and watched as Malfoy immediately closed his lips, bracing himself as… as if he was
You will do it, you just. Panic, when it’s him.
, Draco was forty-five years old — he couldn't repeat it to himself enough. He could still picture Tori, drinking her favourite diet coke on the sofa of their old house, looking affectionately at him.
“Florence, forgive me, I’m in a hurry…” Draco raked a hand through his hair, stopping for a moment in front of her portrait.
and he apparently didn’t say “Granger-Weasleys”.
, ugh.
Draco’s eyes were still fixated on Potter, on that piercing at his eyebrow, that stubble, those little curls falling on his forehead… He answered absent-mindedly. “Mh? Have you seen Potter has a piercing? And a new pair of glasses?”
“Yes? And who am I to you now, Draco?” Harry’s voice was deep and low, and it vibrated through his hand resting on Draco’s body, making him quiver. The tickle intensified, blurring his thoughts…
. “Yes, I’m here. Dare.”
…” Malfoy trailed off and Harry glanced at him again.
Harry would recognise his voice amongst thousands.
It was 5:45 in the evening when the arrival of people diminished significantly, ‘til vanishing to none. And still, no signs of Potter. Or Weasley and Granger, for that matter.
“Get to the point, Potter.”
As dessert was being served at the buffet, Blaise leaned in, lightly whispering in Draco’s ear. “So, Draco, how are you?”
At the same moment, Astoria broke down crying and Ginevra threw her dish of spaghetti at Harry, screaming, “Did you think that bringing us into a restaurant would prevent us from making a scene?!”
“Yes,” he whispered, his fingers fidgeting with the hem of his shirt.
when they went partying! Bless her, he should simply find it.
“Fuck, Malfoy, you taste so bloody good,” Potter said, lips brushing Draco’s now-sensitive head, sending jolts of pleasure throughout Draco’s body. Draco opened his eyes, directing his gaze downward, only to find Potter looking up at him, his hand palming his still-clothed cock, desperation darkening his eyes like a storm reflecting on the ocean.
Malfoy looks up at Harry and he’s smiling— it’s open and unbridled, it makes Harry’s head spin. Then his lips shift, the smile turns into a smirk and he clamps hard around Harry’s knot until Harry cries out and starts coming again, feeling it start from the tip of his toes.
He leaned in to kiss Harry again, slower this time, wriggling his hips, his hole pulsing around Harry’s cock. Draco buried his hands in Harry’s hair, tugging lightly, bringing his mouth to Harry’s ear, sucking on it, “I’ll ride the fuck out of you, love, my love. I’ll ride you until you lose your mind, my love, you are mine.”
“Get up,” Malfoy drawled, waving his wand. The smoke began to dissipate.
Harry answered digging his fingers into Draco’s shoulders, sliding them down his back, coming back up again. He traced the shape of Draco’s lips with his tongue and Draco wasn’t able to stop the moan that tumbled out deep from his throat. Soon they were both panting in each other’s mouths, as if their lives depended on it, on their mouths sealed together and for a moment, Draco believed it, believed his life depended on him kissing Harry forever.
Draco nodded. “Fuck yes, I can’t wait a second more.”
Outside the bathroom stool someone shouted, “Harry? Draco? Where the hell are they, everyone’s waiting outside!”
“I’ll start,” Harry interrupted cheerfully. He propped one elbow on the counter and leaned his chin on it. “When I was eleven, I was almost Sorted into Slytherin.”
Draco checked the hour: it was 8 pm, almost time for dinner. His
It was true. Now that he was relaxed, Draco could feel his legs wiggling uncontrollably under the table, his feet tapping out some sort of a weird rhythm, and his vision starting to blur more often than not.
Draco whined, unable to control himself. “That’s
The snakeskin plummeted into the cauldron with a loud blob, sending a couple of drops on Malfoy’s scrubs. Malfoy cursed, the blush on his cheeks quickly extending towards his ears and neck. With a flick of his wand, he evaporated the drops and looked up at Harry. “That’s— unexpected.”
“Care to explain now?” Harry looked at Ron who nodded and opened his mouth to start speaking.
“Or, you know what, we could keep it as a memory.”
was sleeping — gave him nausea, so he sighed and slumped on the couch, deciding it would be perfectly okay to sleep there for a night.
He had known Malfoy could be witty and sarcastic, but he had no idea it was one of the traits he found most attractive about him.
He caressed his pulsing vein, pressing slightly. Harry choked on a gasp, feeling his cheeks aflame, the need of orgasming more and more strong.
A raspberry stuck in Harry’s throat making him cough and, frankly, gain time to think of an answer that didn’t sound like —
Draco’s heart was running wild in his chest, drawing mad zig-zags around his ribcage, Draco raised his gaze to look at Harry, whose eyebrows were so knitted they looked like one long line, mouth tight.
,” Harry gasped as he convulsed violently with the force of his orgasm. As he shot hot and sticky in his pants, he felt Malfoy stilling against him, his ragged breathing resounding into Harry’s ears.
“Erm, Draco it doesn—”
He shook his head and
Malfoy leaned to his ear and went on, “And then that’s when I realised. What better gift to give you… than me.”
"Of course, Potter! Let's go!" He mounted the broom, looking as graceful as he did in school, a challenge in his eyes.
It was a bitter laugh, and Draco knew that. But at least she had stopped crying. Scorpius’ lips seemed to try to stretch into a smile against his will. “Oh, damn. Did you already know? When we hosted that?”
“I actually like you,” Malfoy concluded, easily. He turned toward Harry, half a smirk on his face. “I’ve known for a while. I’m sorry. That wasn’t mature of me, but I was… scared.”
Harry cleared his throat. “Well, I mean… it’s a bit, um, weird, but all in all — ”
how he had imagined. His eyes stung and he scratched his left forearm, a habit he never lost when nervous. “Tori, I don’t know what to say. You’re right, you make sense now, but… I was… scared.” He stopped, waiting for Astoria to say something, but she just remained silent, waiting for him to go on, with a piercing gaze.
“That’s why his death is all over the place. People are speculating,” Hermione murmured between one bite and another.
He stared in horror as a bunch of lilies and jasmines blossomed out of nowhere and arranged themselves in the mess of Potter’s bun, their fragrance rapidly invading Draco’s senses. It was the gayest thing Draco had ever seen. And still, he couldn’t avoid thinking the git was bloody attractive.
“You always want to eat. Oh no.” Draco groaned, hiding his face in his hands. “Ron will forever rub this one in my face.”
They settled in the room and after a few minutes in silence, Malfoy cleared his throat, tentatively saying, "Something is definitely off. It's already afternoon, bordering on evening if you ask me. I'm not going crazy, right? You can see the day coming to an end too, right?"
Harry smiled, leaning into Draco’s touch until the sparks going down his spine became too strong to bear. He stepped back and glanced at Boo-boo. He was smiling but his eyes looked almost as if they were watering with tears.
Harry murmured the preparative spell and Draco’s cock thickened even more at the feeling of Harry’s magic pushing inside of him, tickling his nerves. With a second spell, the dildo was lubricated, and the tip brushed Draco’s entrance.
Draco’s eyes rolled back into his skull as soon as Harry’s mouth was back on his cock.
The morning after, they went to their usual pub to have breakfast together, Harry ordered Draco’s hot tea with two teaspoons of cold milk and one of sugar, and a cappuccino for himself. Boo-boo entered with them, curiously eyeing the other customers.
Harry flicked two fingers at her. “I don’t say things like, ‘I've got cobwebs.’ Dear lord, I’m serious. What can I do?”
— a Mexican alcoholic drink Draco was completely addicted to — mulling over the offer. He sighed, knowing it was all useless. He chatted some more minutes with the man, Hermes, walking by the shore, admiring the sunset, ending up refusing to go back home with him, wandering off with a rushed, "Sorry, I have to go to work early tomorrow.”
"Not yet," he murmured, lubing his own cock, tightening his muscles at the blissful feeling of something finally tugging at it. He lined up with Harry's rim, lightly pushing the tip of his cock to it.
Astoria turned her head towards Ginny, nodding silently. Ginny went on, “Good, because… this is a secret I have never had the strength to reveal to anyone, but. I guess it’s the right time to… well, Harry and I, oh fuck. We were a disaster. We always had fights and arguments, and after Lily’s birth... we never, you know. We never had…”
“Bite it,” Harry said, voice so rough it sent shivers down Draco’s body. Draco bit down and a sour taste filled his senses, quickly followed by the sweet flavour he had tasted a few seconds earlier. It tasted just like a toffee apple.
“I could tell you wanted me by every move you made. Every breath, every gaze.”
as self-defence and eventually imprisoned Geremia on the charges of wrongful death. A small funeral was organised for Theodore by Harry and Draco, and Hermione had been transferred out of the
If Harry thought he’d already seen Hermione truly amused in his lifetime, he was proven wrong at that moment. She broke into a peal of laughter and snorted repeatedly. Her eyes went glassy as she cried, “Me? And—” another snort, “him? Ha! He wishes. Oh lord. Oh. Lord!”
It passed long enough that Harry was starting to panic. He worried Malfoy was choking somewhere in the house, dark and away from Harry without orders. When he came back to the living room, arms stuffed with three bottles of firewhiskey and two glasses, Harry sighed with relief.
Not an hour later, you’re bent over a desk in a forgotten classroom. Potter’s on his knees, licking your arsehole.
He shook his head to clear his mind and tried again. “So—” He had to stop since his voice came out high-pitched as if he’d just swallowed a whistle. Panicking, he looked through the crowd again: everyone was too focussed on Potter’s arrival to mind him any attention — only Pansy’s face was buried into an ill-suppressed giggle.
“Oh, don’t worry, I know you’re not a good man,” Malfoy replied. “And I believe you’re still too clothed.”
They had spent an awful amount of time reading and discussing all they knew about the
It had never been easy. He looked into Malfoy’s eyes, searching for a sign,
“I don’t actually remember who I slept with.”
"And, how did it go?"
Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath. When he opened them again, he was standing in the middle of a desolate and burned valley. He was also naked and screeching. Wrapped in his wings was Draco Malfoy, who was bleeding from his nose and lips and breathing hard, his face positively
“You think you can fool me?” Potter’s voice was half-amused, half-nervous, which had Draco opening his eyes to look at him. Potter’s head was resting against the wall, his gaze drawn somewhere towards the bed. He clicked his tongue again and continued. “You flirt with other guys to get me angry and possessive and out of control.”
“You can’t breathe a word until I say so. And when you’re going to speak, you’re gonna use Parseltongue, unless you need to use the safe word,” he concluded, looking satisfied, his eyes bright. “Am I understood?”
He fucks you with the dildo, makes it vibrate as it brushes your prostate, then stops it again. He keeps bringing you just to the very edge, then stopping, and you’re going mad.
They Apparated in front of the door of the restaurant and Draco felt nervous all of a sudden. He grasped Harry’s elbow to stop him from entering. “Wait, wait, Harry. I don’t think I can do this. It’s horrible, we – ”
Draco snorted, the sound turning into a whine. He roved his hands up from where they were resting on Harry’s chest, buried them in Harry’s hair, and pressed their foreheads together, sighing through his nose in frustration. “Do you at least like what I’d planned? Please lie to me even if you don’t. I don’t think I can take a defeat against the Weasel right now.”
“You know he’s right. You are being courageous. And if our mighty saviour says so, you have to believe him. Draco… you should talk with him. It must mean something that he’s the only one that triggered some sort of magic out of you in all these years.”
But the Potter-like figure blinked and took a couple of steps towards him, worryingly realistic.
Malfoy's scrutiny was too funny and he didn't mind explaining to him about beer, polyamorous relationships and jeans while watching Malfoy's face scrunch up in horror. "This is all so Muggle…" Malfoy whispered, having the good grace to blush and add, "Yeah, sorry, I'm sorry, okay?"
Harry’s tears broke free like a flooding river that strikes everything in its path. He sobbed as Draco’s hands finally touched every part of his body, ripping Harry’s clothes off of him, carrying him to the hospital bed, sparing a moment to roam his eyes all over Harry’s naked body.
"That's why they called me in. You know what I do for a living, right?"
Potter’s lips quirked up, a strand of hair fell from his bun to gently brush his ear. “Yeah, damn, that was such an interesting piece. Did you know that no one has ever been able to master it? It was never clear where the fault lay; if it was the core or the wood or a combination of factors that made it so loyal to its builder that no one else could make it work. It is quite a problem, you know? Sometimes when you create a wand the result is something so personal that it just never stops being loyal to you and… oh Merlin, I am being boring. Sorry…” Potter’s eyes were still sparkling with passion.
With his heart in his throat, Harry whispered, "You've got dimples. I never noticed them. Cute."
Potter took a couple of steps towards Draco, Lady Luck safe in his hands. “I know she’s fine! But guess what,” he snorted as if he couldn’t believe he was actually going to finish that sentence. “— she told me she wanted to see you.”
Draco’s smile widened. He had never been so sure of anything in his life.
“Harry!” His voice was a bit louder than intended, his emotions clearly getting the best of him.
Pansy and Blaise snorted at the same moment, not able to restrain their amusement.
It seemed like a lifetime ago. The truth was that Malfoy had found Harry’s laughter irresistible, apparently. It was a win-win, really.
Harry rolled his eyes, reminding him his name was
You finally release your breath. You want everything but to hurt Potter. You can’t tell them, though, so you just nod.
, Draco would declare his endless love for Harry, his speech ready in his pocket. Kneeling, giving him the ring, the sunset would surely enhance Harry’s breathtaking smile, and the answer he hoped to hear from him. ‘Yes.’ Maybe a tear or two.
“Isn’t it what we’re here for?” Harry asked. Tossed down the remaining of his glass. “Fine, it is my turn to say something. I… whatever, yes, I have a
When you arrive at the Manor, a girl you’ve barely seen at school is there with her family.
Harry looked at Draco and smiled — he knew Draco was getting ready to do his yoga exercises. He stretched his beach towel perfectly, placing one rock at each corner to anchor it down. Took out his yoga wooden brick and placed himself on it, closing his eyes, taking deep breaths, his hands joined at heart-height.
, it obviously wasn’t true that he could speak to them. He’d just been brilliant enough to pick their habits up and find a pattern to their abnormally fast endangerment in the last couple of years.
Rolf's cousin, and they'd flirted. Ron and Hermione lost sight of Harry after he'd disappeared with Jacob, and never saw him again at the party.
"Potter?!"
You’re a coward, you’ve always been one.
"Wow, Harry, that's wicked! Cool!"
Draco glanced outside — the sun was slowly falling behind the sea as the ocean colour started morphing into a deep blue with orange strikes. “C’mon, let’s get her outside,” he said, smiling to Harry and his pouting face. He looked adorable and Draco found himself thinking he was the luckiest man on Earth to get to see Harry like this again every day, for him, with him.
“Jesus Christ.” Harry dropped his head against the wall again, biting his lips so hard they bled. “Again. Say it again.”
Not that he himself hadn’t considered such a possibility, but he’d meant to give the Manor new life with this Auction, to make it rise again from its ashes, not to burn it down forever.
Draco’s heart plummeted into his stomach and just as Potter lowered his wand and opened his mouth, they were interrupted by a sound coming from the mirrors next to them.
He mutters under his breath a quick, “Whatever,” and finds himself in an empty corridor. Checking that no one is in sight, Harry fishes out the Marauder’s Map from his school bag and immediately spots Draco’s label on it.
“And his black uniform that makes him look so pale, hmm!”
“Fine. It’s almost as if you’re an auror. Oh, wait…” Malfoy smirked, entwining his hands behind his back.
Across the Thames there was an entire wizarding neighbourhood that was completely new to Harry. He walked through the streets with wide eyes — it looked pretty much like a greener and healthier version of Diagon Alley, with parks everywhere, magical creatures walking the streets like it was nothing, restaurants for everyone's tastes at every corner.
Malfoy had exhaled slowly, narrowing his eyes at Harry. He gritted out through clenched teeth, “Then I’m afraid you’ll call me Draco and I’ll call you Harry.”
“Impressive,” Malfoy purred, hand lazily tugging on his own cock, already half hard again.
"Okay, so maybe we could work more on making the travel easier. Draco, if you need to throw up, just conjure a bowl first, please."
Harry’s eyes widened before his entire face flushed redder than Weasley’s hair. He cleared his throat. “Draco! That...you! I was being serious! I discovered my passion for cooking and decided to open my own restaurant. Man, your mind, I swear. Anyway… I never expected to become so famous from it.
Boo-boo’s mouth opened in a circle, oohing at the discovery. He seemed perplexed for a few moments and then began, “Did it mean we were destined to witness Harry’s parents’ death too?”
Astoria suddenly started laughing, to Draco and Scorpius’ surprise. “I can’t believe this! We also hosted the campaign in favour of gay marriage. We participated actively in giving you this opportunity! Aren’t you lucky, Draco? It’s like I gave you my blessing.”
Malfoy nodded, offering him a soft smile again. Harry had no idea what to think — this version of Malfoy was making him nervous and he couldn’t guess how to deal with it. When Teddy came back to his marbles, they all played together and Harry was surprised to realise he was having a great time with Malfoy, who was surprisingly good with Teddy; gentle and patient.
Malfoy's sneer died on his lips, quickly replaced by a quite unsettling smile.
“I was hoping you’d come with me. As my date.”
"I don't think I can sleep now. What will we do? Once back home, I mean."
Harry shook his head and took a sip of his strong coffee when his sight blurred and his head spun, making him grasp the edge of the table — a sudden dizziness was spreading through his body. He squinted at Malfoy, who whispered, "Fuck, Harry, your potion…"
"What! Three
All is well.
Glancing up at the sky he saw the first light of dawn — they’ve already been back in time for eight hours.
He didn't know what he had said, but the
Potter’s tone was coloured by a deep growl, the one he had whenever Draco flirted with someone else. His hot breath fanned against the shell of Draco’s ear, sending shivers down Draco’s spine, and he had to close his eyes against the sheer
Your mouth goes dry, your knees almost buckle— he’s said your name. You hadn’t realised you couldn't believe he wanted to fuck you; you thought he was so drunk he hadn’t recognised you.
“So,” Pansy whispered into his ear, the music still going on, “your magic?”
“Hey, stranger!” Draco’s head snapped up, taking in where he was. Droplets of perspiration were gathering at his neck and forehead and he really, really needed to get out of here.
Geremia clapped his hands. "Great! You're not supposed to know what it is, it’s our secret project; wouldn’t it just be
What the hell was happening? Why was everyone seemingly pushing him to go to Potter? They couldn’t know about his deal with Pansy, right? And besides, he couldn’t just show up in the bathroom and start talking to Potter like that. But maybe… what if Potter got lost? It could happen, the Manor was big, and Potter was a clumsy idiot. Better go check everything was fine, he was gone for a good time now, wasn’t he?
“Ah,” he said, voice croaking. “Right. Good for you, Hermione.”
Draco, quickly melting in Harry’s arms, could only muster a, “Hmm?”
“So, yeah, thanks for the gift… we’ll, um, we’ll just take it to… throw it away.”
"You're confusing me. I wake up after three days unconscious in St. Mungo’s, you tell me someone, that idiot,
"...well, now I have to go, see you later!"
Draco closed his eyes again and nuzzled against Harry’s neck, rubbing his forehead there. “Mmh, it was so good. It was weird at the beginning, but then everything was dark and I could only
at him. “We, Harry? We?!
Ron took a bite of the cake, raising an eyebrow, disbelief overtaking his face. “This is actually pretty good,” he mumbled. He looked at Draco then, something too similar to amusement in his eyes.
With a small pop, Potter released Draco’s balls, licking his way up Draco’s cock once more, this time lapping more insistently, not leaving one single inch of it dry. When he reached the tip, he stopped, then licked it with the flat of his tongue, covering it all. He curled the tip of his tongue to press it over Draco’s slit, licking away every drop of pre-come, capturing each pearly bead and swallowing it down as if it were the finest nectar in the world.
He tucked the blankets around them and enjoyed the view of Draco’s face morphing into small frowns and smiles, waiting for the potion to wear off.
He bucked his hips up, searching for an invisible friction, not having enough, not able to come yet. He sighed loudly, trying to gather his composure to be able to properly respond, and glowered at Malfoy.
They entered and ordered a butterbeer for Harry — “Such a wuss, after all this time.” “Shut up, Draco, we’re not all old classy pure-blood cretins here.” — and a Firewhisky for Draco. They were sharing tells of their previous night and the events of the morning when two Patronuses appeared at their table.
“I’m fifty years old and I want to hug the man I love. I’m so sick of this.”
Harry narrowed his eyes at Malfoy, who looked up at him with a smirk. What the hell was happening, were they… flirting?
“What moment?!”
“It’s just intimidating,” Harry had said, half-naked on his bed, shivering lightly.
To be fair, most of the times had been Harry’s fault. That day Malfoy entered his room with a cold little smile, performing some diagnostic charms on him and explaining to him in more detail exactly what the potion was and how taking the potion daily would help him.
Immediately behind him, Granger and Weasley. Draco blinked through his surprise, searching for Pansy in the crowd and finding her. She smirked, mouthing something Draco didn’t catch. It was probably a reassurance, like ‘stay calm’.
Draco crossed his arms, annoyed he had to ask. “Tell me what?” He drawled, hoping to sound spiteful and unimpressed.
It was always like this with Malfoy. Harry felt every little movement, every brush, lick, kiss, multiplied in every cell of his body, making him dizzy and crazy with want.
Presentations finished, Geremia pointed to a small black box placed on the desk he was working at, addressing Harry and Malfoy.
Harry straightened up and opened his eyes, seeing for the first time where his feet had brought him. He was standing in front of the door of
“There was just
As the words slithered over Draco’s sensitive skin, Potter was already unbuttoning his shirt, his tongue dragging slowly over Draco’s ear, nibbling at the lobe and then down, right under his jaw where Potter knew he could draw Draco’s scandalous mewls, rendering Draco slack in his arms.
“And you needed it right now, on your way back from your trip?”
Trust Pansy to insert at least one dirty word. Without even realising it, Draco held his breath. This clue was really too close to his own thoughts after he heard Harry cooked all those dishes from Sweet Prophecies. But it couldn’t be, could it?
Harry was staring in horror at this strange version of Draco Malfoy. He knew he had changed since the War, he’d seen him earlier that week at the restoration of Hogwarts and he’d received his letter of apology, but surely this was a step too far.
Malfoy fidgeted with the teaspoon, his eyes trained on it.
you,” Draco mused, his heart racing in his chest.
. Draco drew in a shaky breath, trying to calm down.
that flooded him. Fuck, one week without sex —actually, one week without sex
Harry chanted in Parseltongue. He hoped it would lessen his guilt when his whole body convulsed, his muscles tensing as he pushed his hips up. Malfoy’s hands immediately gripped his hips and pushed them down into the mattress, and he straightened, looking into Harry’s eyes.
Harry pulled Malfoy’s face close to his, sealing their lips together, sucking his bottom lip between his teeth. He trembled with the power of want that crossed him, feeling he couldn’t resist him anymore.
“Come here, sweetheart.” Malfoy’s pupils were dilated and his gaze unfocused, wandering madly all over Harry’s body as he reached the bed.
Harry’s head snapped up. “Excuse me?”
Harry glared at his best friends, the traitors, when Malfoy continued. "Don't look at them like that. I needed the most precise information I could get to draw the right conclusions. It was an important detail, indeed. You were tied up and naked: Jacob would have needed to make physical contact with you for this bond to succeed. Before you panic, though, Potter, no: he didn't perform any sexual act with you, I checked. As I was saying, this is very ancient magic. It asks to not 'consummate' before bonding. As for
"As much as I'd
“You’re so clueless, for fuck’s sake! We are…
"Draco, what the fuck! That sounds like the title of a porn movie! It's called ‘room service’, for Godric's sake, and well yeah, it's pretty common for Muggles."
Harry shook his head to clear it of the memories of the previous night and looked up at Malfoy’s red cheeks now, his pinched lips. “Alright.” Harry snorted, took a sip of the juice. “Maybe we should have a safe word.”
Harry’s eyes widened while the laughter of their friends only increased. He risked a glance in Ginny’s direction finding her lightly shaking her head, her eyes again amazed. She caught his eyes and chuckled, a little smirk playing on her lips.
Malfoy started moving inside of him, teasing him with slow thrusts, taking out his cock until the tip rested against Harry’s hole and then waiting for it to spasm and for Harry to cry ‘fuck me, love’ before pushing in again.
Harry was pacing in the kitchen, waiting for the teapot to be ready, thousands of thoughts about the possible positions of the last Death Eaters running through his mind when Malfoy’s voice reached him.
Draco swallowed drily, wondering when exactly Potter grew so confident and snarky. It wasn’t exactly how they had left when they were nineteen.
Draco’s at the Black Lake and near him, there’s only another label: Gregory Goyle.
“I wouldn’t have guessed you’d be here.”
“N—” Harry tried, for his sake. The Veritaserum gave a jolt in his veins, his mouth twisting against his will. “Yes.” It was whispered, but everyone heard him.
But this was different. Harry somehow felt wrong for watching Draco during his sleep, like some kind of creepy stalker, but the thought never abandoned him. The thought that he could have maybe…
"S-so, they're still there and… and… are you doing
"Ow, is this how you flirt with people? I'm not surprised you're still single."
Draco loved how sensitive Harry was.
Pansy was brushing her hand in Draco’s hair, gently tucking it behind his ears again, smoothing it. Draco impulsively brought a hand to clutch the pendant, hidden beneath his shirt, hanging at heart height.
Their hands flew all over their bodies, exploring, touching, finally having each other, their lips releasing litanies of love, brushing on each other over and over again.
Harry laughed at the blue-haired Draco in front of him, still very much him, but at least disguised enough to not be recognised.
One hour, and an anxiety crisis later — "honestly, Draco, didn't you think Boo-boo could be impressed by the ritual?" "Just shut up, Harry, you didn't think of that either!" — Jacob exited the room limping, clutching at his stomach and casting worried glances around the corridor.
“For Merlin’s sake…” you murmur. “Potter, you saucy slut.” You slap his arse, and he chuckles.
trusted non-conventional solutions. He was about to start fully panicking when the only other door in the room opened and Malfoy's pale face appeared, his scowl in place.
“That was appalling. And…” Draco’s voice was so rough he had to clear his throat to continue. “And you have an obsession.”
Like he belonged there.
He knew perfectly well how Harry did it.
Harry’s heart was exploding at hearing Draco calling him ‘love’ endlessly and he felt a lump forming in his throat — he didn’t know what to say, what to do, he stared as Draco undressed himself and climbed onto the bed, straddling him, returning to kiss every single centimetre of Harry’s body.
“Hey big fella, it’s always like this with dares. You didn’t say anything when Bulstrode dared Nott to kiss you…” Seamus raised an eyebrow to him, daring him to try and contradict him.
“What? What is it?” Hermione asked, looking at the three of them with a confused face.
“Potter. It was phenomenal. Tell me you want to do this again,” Draco sighed, his breathing still laboured, eyes closed.
Malfoy laughed loudly, his voice thundering out of his mouth and going straight to Harry's heart. His cheeks showed those delicious dimples again and Harry found himself smiling like a fool, thinking that if all he needed to make those dimples appear was talking a bit of Parseltongue, he'd keep doing it forever.
“I’m sorry, love, but I want to see you come undone with this.” Harry’s eyes darkened with lust while hovering over Draco’s body, stopping on his cock.
Harry could do that.
Malfoy looked down at Harry's stretched arm with the broom held out for him, biting on his bottom lip. As much as it was an enticing image, they were in a hurry.
Harry hummed walking towards the door, stretching a hand behind him for Draco to hold. Draco made a show of huffing and taking it — “What a sap, Potty” — only to feel his face muscles aching for how much he was smiling a second later.
“Actually, it wasn’t me. But I wish I had thought of something so funny myself.”
reveal.”
“Stop it, idiot! Gimme a muffin, too.”
, directions. He had to blink several times to remind himself how breathing worked.
But before he could think otherwise, he opened the door and went inside, regretting his decision immediately. He hadn’t thought of how intimate the bathroom was and how his intentions could look
The first time they did this Draco had thought it was a game, that Potter only wanted to tease. How very wrong he was. Soon enough, he discovered Potter liked licking every inch of Draco with the devotion of a cat lapping every drop of cream from a bowl. Potter acted like he could never get enough, and Draco was more than happy to be the object of such admiration.
Malfoy told him that it hadn't been easy analysing his bond, because it was an ancient spell, meant to bond two people forever, both physically and mentally.
Harry’s cock released the first spatter of come as the two Malfoys were still finishing to speak, his senses wrecked by Malfoy’s thrusts and the scent of the other Malfoy’s hair so close to his face. He kept leaking come on Malfoy’s hand for what felt like an eternity and when he finished he barely registered Malfoy sliding out of him and laying him down on the bed on his back.
His hair was tied up in a sloppy little bun, his curls escaping it, falling down on his forehead, his ears. Some strands of it fell from the bun and cascaded on his neck, caressing it.
When they’d finished —with Harry’s spunk splattered on the floor, Malfoy still balls-deep inside Harry— Malfoy gripped Harry’s hair, pulling
Harry stopped, taking a deep breath. Malfoy was looking at him with a perplexed face, but a little smile was pulling at his mouth.
“Willingly. I want to see you begging me on your knees, worshipping my cock, pliant and aware, aware that you want me and need me because I’m the only one who can give you what you need.”
“Yeah. Bye.
Malfoy cocked his head, looking at Harry with an expectant expression. Harry licked his lip. “Pour us two glasses of firewhiskey.” Honestly, Harry hadn’t foreseen, couldn’t have possibly imagined how easily he’d get into this commanding dynamic.
Malfoy giggled, his eyelids sliding completely closed.
The second time, Harry was less prepared than the first one, if that was even possible.
“What if… what if we carve our initials in here? It would be fun!”
Draco could feel Potter’s smirk against his ear. “Is it? I see.” He yanked his hand off Draco’s back, then pushed his chair backwards. He stood, smiling politely. Frankly, it was a bit frightening.
"Harry, it was sad, but… are you crying?"
Harry walked over to Draco’s desk, reached into the open drawer, and took out all the clues.
Harry turned to face him, his voice heavy with sarcasm. "Oh, we shouldn't trust Boo-boo, he's weird!"
, to move, to grasp Malfoy and rut against him till he came in his pants, to kiss him, to worship him and tell him how beautiful he was. Harry tightened his hands into fists, jaw clenched against all the praises that wanted to escape him.
Harry was twenty-five the first time he discovered he was in love with his Sir. It happened by accident.
Draco had looked into Potter's green eyes, those eyes he dreamt of since he was too young to be said. He had shaken his head, looking far away at some indefinite point of the Black Lake.
“What the fuck…” he murmured as he displayed them on top of the desk. “These are… Draco! Are these clues you’ve collected on the possible identity of the chef of Sweet Prophecies?”
“Harry, I—”
“I need to go back home. I have a horrible headache. I’ll see you soon.”
, had Potter always been this clumsy? It almost looked cute. Damn, fuck,
"Calm down, Harry. I think I can recreate it with the right ingredients, okay? Breathe."
flirting this appealing. With his heart in his throat, he stared right back at Potter.
“Christ,” Harry said again for what felt like the thousandth time since the day before when they’d found themselves in this mess. “Alright, yes, yeah, that seems smart.”
Shortly after, Boo-boo returned to their table trying to understand what Harry and Malfoy were talking about — “We could work with Muggles to reduce our chances of being recognised.” “If you think I’ll ever let myself get anywhere close to a Muggle job, you’re going crazy, Potter” — and rolling his eyes.
Draco sighed and waved a hand towards Lady Luck. "
“I’m assessing the situation. It’s a mess. It’s a fucking mess.” Harry scratched behind his neck as Malfoy kept looking at him with a ‘so what’ face.
Harry held his gaze, smirked. Malfoy could never resist him when he tantalised him, his Dom side singing at the possibility of showing exactly who was in control.
Mr Serkin began, “The auction starts at 20 thousand Galleons.” Soon enough, people were raising their wands, offering more and more. Somehow, Draco had been able to restrain himself from staring at Potter, but by this time his patience was shrinking to none at all. He’d just let his eyes wander over the entire crowd and casually flicked them over Potter too…
After the first dizzying seconds, Harry tried to concentrate on the dark room for any sign of the presence of another person. He couldn't hear even the faintest of noises nor recall anything about the previous night.
, Ron.”
"Oh, I'm sorry darling, it comes so natural for me to hug you. I was on the mobile with Ron, he forgot he can't go pick up the kids from school today, can you believe him?"
Malfoy raised his hands in a sign of surrender, his eyebrows wrinkled together, as Harry whispered into his ear, “Shit, this doesn’t sound good.”
“Did you hear what I said?”
Harry snorted, shaking lightly his head. Malfoy’s fingers still on his lips. “Merlin, why Malfoy.” He laughed, lost in the memory. “Fifth year. How can I forget… you conjured a bed,” Harry turned to point somewhere in the middle of the room, “right there.”
He bit on his lips, looking as he was pondering what to say next. “I never stopped loving you. Never, you have to believe me.”
Draco smirked, taking off his shirt completely, sending it onto his couch in a neat rectangle. “Sex without stupid chit-chat or sentimentality? Sounds like a deal to me.”
Pansy raised an eyebrow, her mouth twisting into a too self-satisfied smirk. “I thought Potter had that covered already.”
Amongst the people who won the war.
Harry followed her with his eyes until her form disappeared behind the door and then flicked them up to Malfoy again, catching him exchanging a look with Ron and Hermione.
After all, it had been— Harry counted to himself as he slowly molded the ceramic into an hourglass shape— an entire year, for crying out loud. An entire year of Harry and Malfoy shagging and not being able to talk about it like proper adults.
He kissed Malfoy again, his mind already spiralling with thousands of thoughts — it would be hard to build something together again, it has always been so complicated between them.
"It's just so we have an excuse to go up to the rooms."
Draco turned to smile at him, his skin slightly reddened from the sun. This period he had let his beard grow, but since he couldn’t
After a second, Harry followed him, taking shrunken pans and trays out of his pockets, his cheeks flaming and absolutely adorable.
.” He stopped to intertwine his legs with Harry’s. “I felt you, gosh yes, everywhere around me. Everything was blurry but it was definitely your scent and… your cock stretching me. I... Merlin, I felt my orgasm flood out of me, I had no control. You just ripped it out of me. It was hot.”
“I know,” was Malfoy’s easy reply as he turned slightly to Harry with a half smile.
For Christmas, you want all but to spend the holidays with your mother. Your father’s dead, kissed by the Dementors, and she’s trailing towards insanity day by day.
“Absolutely not. I am afraid kissing you has this effect…”
bond,” he said, bringing Draco’s pinkie to his lips, “but I’m certain I want you in my life.”
“Okay, what is happening guys?” Hermione asked, snapping her fingers in front of their eyes.
Fucking Salazar, Merlin and all the wizards of the world, was Potter with someone in there?
“Boo-boo, what’s happ—”
"Well, that wouldn't be that bad—" he said with a trembling voice.
“The moon,” Harry replied. “You, me, the stars.”
A distant buzz. “Draco...”
“Ron! I am not asking about that! I am asking what we can do now!” Ginny managed to buy a copy of the Prophet newspaper on their way back to town and was holding it right in front of Ron’s face.
and go out to dinner. Whatever was happening with Potter was already messing with him too much.
He finally kissed Harry, licking along his bottom lip, eliciting a deep moan from him, thrusting his tongue inside his mouth. They started an agonizingly slow grind against each other, every brush of Malfoy’s cock on Harry’s sending sparks of lust across his skin.
“You never change,” Draco says fondly, a smile spreading on his face. “You didn’t listen to a word I said, did you?”
He stands up, taking a deep breath to steady himself. But just when he starts moving towards the Slytherin table, Draco springs up and marches towards the doors, Goyle in tow.
“What! How can you lay down like that, Tori, after all of this! How could we be so blind? I mean, they bought a house together! A house!”
Astoria sniffled and Scorpius went to sit next to her, hugging her. He rubbed his hands on her back, trying to calm her down. “That’s the least, Dad. What are you planning to do now? Mum said you want to
“I’m an Auror. I killed Voldemort. I can resist you.” Harry wasn’t absolutely sure about that, but he didn’t want to show it to Malfoy. Malfoy was lying.
His magic was reacting to his feelings, and the bottle for their stupid Truth or Dare game had just exploded.
Draco’s cheeks turn even redder if that’s possible. “Idiot,” he murmurs. Then adds, “He really didn’t mean any harm. He saw you exiting my room and thought I had, err, kidnapped you or something. He’s not the most brilliant.”
Harry braced himself against the wall and pushed back, sighing in relief. After a second, Malfoy’s hand landed on his other cheek, smacking deliciously, making Harry shiver.
Draco held out his arm towards Harry. “Side-Along?”
Why on Earth was Malfoy still in Harry’s house? With a sigh, Harry struggled to listen.
Harry gulped a big breath, trying to steady himself. A couple of giggles escaped him again as he redirected his gaze to Malfoy’s eyes which were fixed on Harry’s cock, hard and wet against his own stomach.
But when Draco decided to stand up and demand they lower the temperature —honestly, it was torture how hot it had gotten— he felt glued to the spot as Potter did the very thing Draco imagined: he brought the slice of lime to his lips, his tongue dragging across the flesh, excruciatingly slow, small shivers running down his back, visible goosebumps rising on his arms.
“You’re such an exhibitionist!”
When he came out of the bathroom and padded to the living room again, it was to find Scorpius already sat on one of the ottomans next to the couch, looking confused at Astoria, probably trying to process what she was saying. Her voice was trembling, she looked already on the verge of crying again.
Until now.
“Not happening, mate,” Jerome said. “I’m not telling you who the chef is. Besides, I don’t know either.”
Seven months in, and Boo-boo told them he’d stay in the atrium of the hotel — he didn’t want to be a burden and it wasn’t like he could be in any kind of danger. Harry smiled at him, at his innocence. That night, Draco finally saw his first Muggle porn movie. He had spent half the time criticising the poor acting skills versus the realism of porn memories you looked at in Pensieves, and half the time with his hand in his pants.
Harry didn't reply. If he had to be penetrated by two Malfoys, he wanted to see the show.
The whole situation was starting to be almost ridiculous and still, Draco's headache was already gone and he could feel a hot happiness sweeping through him.
“Totally, totally fine! I just wanted to make conversation!”
Potter grinned and took a deep breath. “I clearly do. Sane or not, you’re my addiction.”
Malfoy crossed Harry's gaze and smirked. "It is, indeed," he said, leaning on the table, his chin resting on his hands. Harry could practically see a tail popping out of Malfoy's bum and wagging with smugness.
“Err, I’m sorry. What were you… I mean, was it poisonous?”
“Pansy only does the polls for you, you know that, right? If we’re all so interested in these polls it’s because you’re our favourite lost cause.”
— and Lady Luck smiling at him for the first time in years.
“What were we talking about?” Draco rasped once he wiped his lips with his napkin. He stared at it, studying its purple stain.
With a hand on the doorknob of the bathroom, Draco felt his boldness abandoning him. What would he tell Potter when seeing him? ‘Oh, hi, what a coincidence’?
A second later you’ve stripped him from his trousers, taken his legs and draped them around your waist. “I’ll fuck you so hard you’ll beg me to stop,” you say as he clenches his thighs behind your back. You take out your cock: it’s indecent, lord, Harry Potter pressed against a wall, half-naked, legs entwined behind your back.
“What!? We have to tell them the truth, Gin!” He got up from the bed, following her. “Wait, come back!”
“Shut up! No questions, remember?” Malfoy’s cheeks refused to return to their normal pallor, and as much as a delicious sight he made, Harry decided to drop it.
“Shush.” Tori wiped the tears from Draco’s eyes and puffed his cheeks. “It has been difficult, but now I see the both of you together and I can’t avoid thinking you’re perfect for each other. Now regain your control, you have a wedding to attend!”
“Harry...”
“So maybe we should continue this… conversation in the bathroom.”
Harry side-eyed Draco walking past him, breathed in the crisp autumn air, smiled to the cold sun. It was a good day.
Draco looked into his eyes and they smiled, their cheeks flushed. He pushed back and rolled next to Harry — the night was finally quiet, their panting slowly evening out.
Blaise stopped, putting a hand on Draco’s chest. “Okay, Draco, what is it?” They’d arrived at the stairs in front of the cherry wood doors once again. Draco glanced up, toward the big cuckoo clock adorning the wall above the doors. It was made of the same quality of wood, a little wooden canary enchanted to fly endlessly back and forth with the pendulum until with a soft song it would announce the hour.
“What… what do you mean?” Harry felt exhausted, but his cock seemed to think differently. It was still fully hard, and was throbbing at the image in front of his eyes.
Stupid freckled Gryffindork, how dare he! Ready to kill, Draco replied, “I’m his boyfriend! For six years this year! I—”
“Anytime, Potter,” Malfoy drawled.
“Like what you see?” he asks. His voice is low, amused, the smirk still playing on his red, ruined lips. It goes straight to your cock, which twitches. How fucking drunk must Potter be if he’s flirting with you, now?
“I know,” he whispered, so low he wasn’t sure Potter had heard him. They’d stayed like that for a few minutes, bodies glued from shoulder to hip on the sofa, warm and comfortable.
Draco seemed to be thinking the exact same thing.
Hermione’s worried voice came from behind him, “Harry, you need to cal—”
He would never accomplish anything in this state. With a quick
With a deep sigh, Astoria sat up on the couch and looked intently at Draco. “So, it’s true. It really happened.”
“It’s my birthday party,” Harry said for what felt like the hundredth time, helplessly staring at Malfoy’s sleeping form. Malfoy who was in his bed.
Harry stayed there, Draco’s cock shoved down his throat, swallowing every single drop of Draco’s spunk. When he drained Draco dry, Harry released his cock with a wet pop, licking his lips. “Much better. Fuck, you taste so good.”
Harry and Malfoy shared a perplexed gaze — this was starting to sound weird indeed. A waitress approached their table and Harry ordered a cappuccino and looked over to Malfoy, who finally shrugged off his hood and looked like a lost puppy.
“It was a Slytherin.”
Pottery, specifically. Was it ironic? Did Ron and everyone else make jokes about it? Yes and yes. Was Harry happy about his choice? Also, yes.
"This can't be right," Harry slowly said, his mind racing through all the possibilities.
Harry gasped loudly, almost crying in pleasure — he wanted Malfoy to know just how perfect he felt, how perfect they were together.
“I—” Malfoy exhaled roughly, shook his head. “I’m so close already. T-the bond,
Draco inhaled deeply, reaching a hand to Harry's hair, stopping barely in time. Harry stepped back, tears still hot on his cheeks.
“So generous,” he said, voice rough. It made Harry’s half-hard prick stiffen some more. “‘Shut up’ seems to be your favourite order to give me.”
“Malfoy, is my birthday gift your cock? Because I’ve already had it, you know…"
He didn’t talk about it to Draco. It wasn’t like they were prudish — on the contrary, Draco had confessed to Harry he liked to be dominated almost immediately, to Harry’s delight. He loved being in charge, getting to decide exactly how and what to do, Draco pliant under his touch, pliant when Harry knotted thick ropes against his chest, pliant stuffed with a plug in his arse all day long.
Harry giggled, scooped up his glass and gulped down his firewhiskey. “Wait,” he said. He wasn’t sure but throughout the show he must have drunk some more glasses with Malfoy because they were giggling uncontrollably. “Come here,” Harry sloshed, taking off his glasses and tossing them…
to be a girl and a boy.”
Harry’s mind was a mess and his body was starting to succumb to his thoughts. A growl formed from his very guts and escaped past his lips as Malfoy’s face took on a pleased expression.
Weasley nods. “Hurt him and I’ll kill you.”
!” He grinned his breath-taking grin and fidgeted with his shirt, revealing a sleepy Lady Luck in his breast-pocket.
“Okay… What about a story about two kids. They never got along when they were younger, on the contrary. You could define them as enemies, but they had a lot in common. Born in different families with different circumstances, they quickly learned that they had a clearly defined path in front of their selves and that they couldn’t escape it.”
