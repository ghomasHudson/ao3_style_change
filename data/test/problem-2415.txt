“Go take a shower, then come downstairs and eat something,” Sirius says. “If you’re still feeling restless, you can help me and Remus attack the doxies that are hiding in one of the spare bedrooms. We cleaned them out of the living room months ago, but it looks like there’s more of the blighters hiding. They’re good target practice.”
“Sorry, dear,” he says. “Asim Jaspel? Is he – well, I assume there’s only one,” he finishes, speaking more to himself than them.
Harry raises an eyebrow and Neville makes a face even as he automatically adjusts his stance and falls into a sword pattern that looks practiced. “Gran thought lessons would make me less clumsy. I don’t know much.”
“I’m getting on the train,” he announces. Nothing happens, and he says, again, louder, “I’m getting on the train!”
Okay, he gets he’s central to the war and everything, but he doesn’t appreciate a group full of strangers talking about his personal affairs like they all have a say in it. “I was planning to go to Beauxbatons, actually, and join the gliding team. There’s the small issue of me not speaking French, but one problem at a time.”
Which is how Quinn becomes the youngest Potions Master to be officially recognized by the guild at the ripe old age of seventeen. The best part, ze claims, is that master is a gender neutral term.
“That’s no use, she just sat around being beautiful while he asked her out,” he says.
Of course, nothing good can last, because that very night Sirius Black breaks into the Gryffindor common room.
He slumps, holding onto the sides of the crib so tightly the whole thing creaks. His shoulder shake, and Harry comes to the uncomfortable realization that he’s seeing his horrible potions professor cry.
“That’s astral projection, isn’t it?” Luna asks, brow furrowed. “Could it be just another astral projection spell? Pushing the soul of the body and then calling it back is all that astral projection is.”
“-and we’re never allowed to go into other house’s common rooms, nor are they allowed in ours,” Cormac says, speaking to a group of wide eyed first years and bored everyone else.

She says dryly, “My prophecies don’t tend to concern the romantic lives of teenage boys, even in a relationship as star crossed as yours.” She looks up at him and reaches into her pocket to take out a glowing glass orb, just like the ones that had lined the shelves in the Department of Mysteries, and holds it out to him.
He narrows his eyes at her. “That was vaguely accusatory. If you’re going to say something, I’d rather you just come out and say it. Do I need my attorney present for this conversation?” His attorney is, of course, his father.
It only takes Harry a half second to figure out what Draco’s asking. “You want me to astral project? To find Snape?”
She tries to speak but can’t, not real words, just sounds. It’s part of the curse. Even with her lips sewn shut she should be able to at least make a little sense, but the curse won’t let her. According to Pansy, she shouldn’t be able to get herself to write it down either, it should all come out as gibberish.
She bows and disappears.
Now it’s time for the reception. Everyone starts making their way out of the tent, talking excitedly about it, and he overhears more than one person commenting on her dress.

She slowly reaches forward, lightly pressing a finger against the top of his scar and slowly following its path down his face. It’s barely raised and pale against the rest of his skin. “Does it hurt?”
Ron is still pulling them forward with single-minded determination, doing his best to get them as far from the chaos as possible. “Draco is a pureblood and the son of a Death Eater. They won’t hurt him, but they will hurt us. How do you think Draco will feel if we get hurt because we didn’t listen to him? Do you think he’ll be happy? Do you think he’ll thank us?”
He awards Fleur a perfect score for unflinching loyalty, determination, and dedication to her loved ones.
It’s the middle of the night, and Draco and Winky are hard at work creating more buttons when his mirror goes off. He wouldn’t normally answer it in the common room, but they’re the only ones there, so he flicks it open. “Hey, is everything okay?”
“Don’t lie to me!” she screeches, “What have I told you about lying?”
Sirius frowns, “I have no idea what’s happening.”
He walks in to a wand pointed at his face. He only raises an eyebrow. “Darling, how could you?”
Cedric rolls his eyes and crosses his arms over his chest. There’s a smattering of laughter, and Susan elbows him in the side. He looks to his fiancé for help, but Cho’s laughing at him too.
Well.
“You’re supposed to be at Hogwarts,” she scolds, hurrying towards him. She casts a scourgify on herself before she grabs him in a tight hug, so there’s that at least. “Is something wrong?”
This is probably the exact opposite of what Draco wants him to do, the opposite of what they were trying to achieve, but he doesn’t bloody care. He whips out his wand, pointing it at Moody. “Put him down,” he says, and he doesn’t recognize his voice. It sounds cold. It sounds like Draco’s does when he’s pissed off.
“Everything okay?” he pulls back to ask, and Draco doesn’t even pause, biting his way down Harry’s neck. He’s absolutely going to have to cast a glamour or borrow a scarf, and it’s way too warm for the latter to not seem suspicious anymore.
Fred finished Pansy’s hair and bounces to his feet. “Well, luckily for you we can help you keep your promise. How’s your occlumency?”
“That would be lovely, thank you,” Fleur says politely.
Draco smiles and tilts his head back to look into his eyes. “I’m going to miss you too. But things are different now. We’re not a secret anymore, even a poorly kept one. My parents know we’re soulmates, and Remus has liked me since I was an extra bratty thirteen year old. We’ll be able to see each other this summer, properly, in person and everything.”
“Did Draco tell you?” Hermione asks, “I figured he might know, what with his father being on the Board and all.”
Draco is walking down the hall when someone grabs his elbows and yanks him into a broom closet. He expects it to be Susan, since she has a history of it, or maybe his soulmate wanting to make out.
Narcissa applies a drying charm on him with a stab of her wand, then wrinkles her nose at the grime he’s covered with and adds a scourgify charm for good measure. It makes him feel a little better, but he’s still planning to take a shower as soon as he gets home.
That gets his attention. “You want me to write something?”
Winky is beside herself. Draco tells him over the mirror that she’d known Barty Crouch Jr had escaped Azkaban, and that he was the one that had stolen Harry’s wand. But she swears that she hadn’t known he was here, that she thought that he was at home with his father, and Draco believes her. Now that everyone knows, it’s no longer a secret, so Winky’s no longer bound to silence. She tells Dumbledore and Kingsley everything she knows, at length, with Draco just standing there the entire time, since he’d refused to let them question his elf without being there.
Fuck it.
“Well,” Harry starts, but Draco slaps his hand against his chest and he shuts up.
“We’ve been dating for six months!” he protests.
The house elves blink, then glance at each other, a silent conversation happening between them in moments. Winky hesitates, but says, “It is not being about spells. It’s an ability, not a thing you learn.”
He feels like a kid as soon as he says that and regrets it instantly, but Asim just laughs. “Yes, I promise.”
“Telling you guys apart his hard enough without you making it even more confusing,” he complains, messing up Fred’s hair in return. “Is there a reason you’re pretending to be George, or do you just like watching the world burn?”
“Bye!” he hears Harry shout, and he steps out from behind the shelf, casting “Fulger!” right at Bellatrix’s back, who’s the one that had taken their portkeys. He hears everyone else casting their own offensive spells, and then they’re running, darting through the shelves as the Death Eaters give chase.
“It’s cool, I get it, I’m just a speaker, very boring and commonplace, why would they care about me,” he says with a big, exaggerated pout.
Draco wants to go on a lecture about that’s not how charms work, but is very aware that if he dives into yet another rant about his favorite subject that Blaise will leave him to maneuver washing his hair on his own. “I’ll just rewrap it before we go to class.”
“I don’t know why you’d even ask me that question,” he huffs.
The announcer instructs everyone to settle in and get to their seats, and Viktor smiles and waves goodbye to all of them, except Ron who receives clap on the back.
The woman shrinks back and shakes her head.
Draco reaches inside his robe. He still has his wand.
, and he really wishes he was better at featherlight charms. With something this big, his weak charm would have just shattered. So instead he holds it steady with wingardium leviosa, and it
Everyone’s looking at him now, and he hates it.
“Prophecies,” Blaise says before it can turn into an argument. “Like Neville said. Maybe it’s a weapon?”
They walk to Dumbledore’s office, and it takes longer than it should, the three of them pained and exhausted. “Do you know the password?” Harry asks when they’re standing in front of the golden griffin.
Everyone here is a fourth year and up, because everyone below that just gets to take the class. But the rest of them – they’re starting older, at a disadvantage, because they don’t have the extra years at Hogwarts to actually get good at this under the Flamels’ teachings. So they have to pass some sort of test, or fight each other to the death, or something. He’s not sure. The announcement wasn’t very specific.
Except he passes by Honeydukes, and sees Viktor in the window. He pauses, considers that it’s none of his business, then walks in anyway.
“I know you were in the chamber,” Umbridge hisses, “half the students in this school creep around at night, unsupervised, but we can never find them, it’s like they just disappear. I’ve heard the rumors, Mr. Potter, I know what you’re doing. I know about your little army.”
“Wake me if anyone gets close,” he orders, pulling his cloak more tightly over his shoulders and wishing he were doing this somewhere more comfortable, like his bed. “I can’t let anyone see me like this.”
These are all former prisoners of Azkaban. It doesn’t take him long to pick his Aunt Bellatrix and Uncle Rodolphus out from the emaciated strangers. He doesn’t remember them, of course, but he’s seen pictures, and Bellatrix was once just as lovely as his own mother. Now, of course, she’s far from lovely.
He borrows Harry’s invisibility cloak for it. He’s already come too close to ruining everything for his parents to risk doing it again. Once they’re inside, he hangs back, watching but just sitting silently underneath the cloak.
“Uh huh,” she says dryly. “Hurry up now, I’m interested to see how this will blow up in your faces.”
Kreacher snarls. Sirius half rises from his chair, but Harry puts a hand on his arm and shakes his head. He’s not exactly sure what’s going on, but he trusts Winky not to do anything truly horrible.
This next part is trickier. Pulling dead flesh back together is a skill he’d learned from Asim, as it was necessary for many patients who’d had parts of their bodies cursed to die off. They’d tried to preserve them and keep them attached, if they could, because it made healing easier when they figured out the underlying cause. If they figured out the underlying cause. It’s not healing, exactly, but it’s something. It’s something he knows how to do that will hopefully make this a little bit less awful, so he’s going to do it.
Draco shrugs, “It’s – fine, I don’t mind. I’m all caught up on my homework, so you know. It’s fine.”
“You’re right, giving her power over Hogwarts is the lesser of two evils. I’m sorry,” Hermione says earnestly.
“I do feel a bit sorry for Percy,” Ron says. “He’s not amused. He sent me a howler this morning, but Tonks was laughing in the background, so I’m pretty sure he won’t kill me.”
“He’s a Parseltongue, he’s famous, he’s Harry Potter,” Asim lists off. “If they’re going to do it for anyone, it might be him. A spell dancer can do in months what will takes us years, if we’re lucky.”
Oh, well that’s convenient. “Can you go get the other Weasleys?” he asks Dobby.
Harry’s expecting Draco to yell at him. Instead he gets a peculiar look on his face and starts pacing. “Do you think,” he starts, bites his lip, and goes back to pacing.
He remembers the night of Triwizard Tournament, and he thinks past the fear, past the uncertainty and worry. He remembers holding Harry in his arms, seeing Fleur protecting all of them, finding Cho and Cedric alive. He remembers his clawing desperation as he used healing spells he’d never tried before on his father, snatching him back from the edge of death. He remembers his mother’s hysteria folding into calm, her silent acceptance and support at his back as he performed spells she hadn’t thought he knew the words for. He remembers his father opening his eyes and telling him that he did it for him, that what he valued even more than his own safety was Draco’s good opinion.
After hours spent gliding, he’s starving. And sore. He hasn’t been sore after flying since he was a first year, but gliding works out a whole new set of muscles that he doesn’t normally use. There has to be some exercises he can do to get his body more accustomed to gliding while he’s off his broom, right? Not that he has much time for that this year, but assuming he doesn’t die in this tournament, it will at least give him something to do while he’s stuck with the Dursleys. He’s the only member of the quidditch team that doesn’t fly over the summer, and they don’t seem to notice the difference, but he does.
Fred and George step forward. They look grim. “We spied on the Slytherin team’s practice,” Fred says, “There’s good news and there’s bad news.”
The second thing he sees is Bellatrix Lestrange standing there with a half dozen Death Eaters.
“That was Mabel,” Ron says, “she appreciated the gesture, although she was still crying when Lavender threw her at me an hour later.”
that Flora is the captain. Which, when Harry remembers the role she played in that fight between the twins and Keenan last year, does make some sort of sense.
Draco shakes his head. “Fudge overruled them without getting specific. At least now we see why.” There are way too many eyes on him right now, everyone half turned towards him even if they’re talking to someone else, which is – weird. “She’s not going to make this year easier for anyone, and she’s certainly not going to
There’s an arch of something that looks like lightning being directed by a skinny merman with eyes that glow silver. Every corpse it touches spasms and then falls still, although Harry knows better than to think that it’ll last for long.
“So I’ll be careful,” he says, shrugging. “You can control the volume by constricting their petals, and they only bloom in spring anyway. Most of the time they’ll just sound nice, and if they don’t then that’s what muffling charms are for.”
“There is not being time for this,” Winky says impatiently. “You must be getting back before someone notices you is missing. Dobby will be taking you.”
They all pause and follow her gaze. Up ahead of them Katie Bell is arguing with Leanne Connors, which is unusual. Katie will cheerfully get into a fight with almost anybody, but Leanne doesn’t like confrontation, and Katie doesn’t like doing things that Leanne doesn’t like.
Draco huffs and climbs on, muttering a quick apology when he has to grab onto Firenze’s waist to steady himself. Damsa isn’t looking at them, still staring at Cobalt.
Except, for all his incompetence, Voldemort
George adds, “There’ll be more arrests tomorrow. Including those aurors that Harry allegedly stunned, since they were on Umbridge’s payroll.”
an army of snakes? He doesn’t know how much good it would do him. An army of wyverns, maybe.
“I don’t want you to teach me something,” Draco says, “I want you to help me invent something.”
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake,” Ginny gets up and plops herself down on Neville’s lap. Draco didn’t know it was physically possible for a human being to turn that shade of red. It can’t be healthy. “There, happy now?”
Draco blinks, not understanding. “
. You’re good, I’m good, we could probably get Filius to join us which would certainly speed things along. But we’re not experts at material manipulation or magical forging.”
“Never too late for learning!” he says cheerfully, dragging Hermione out of the classroom. “Good luck, guys!”
“Well, I suppose I could give you hand polishing your buttons, anyway,” she says, taking a seat on the other end of the couch from Blaise, putting her book on the table and then holding out her hand for a polishing cloth.
“I’ve had it cast on me a
“I said he’d be alive, I didn’t say what condition he’d be in,” Voldemort says. “If you want him back in any sort of salvageable shape, I’d hurry.”
“I love you too,” he responds, and then Harry’s kissing him again, which lasts until he gets hit in the back of the head with a piece of toast.
“Gotta make a living,” Pansy says, and Harry snorts. “Well, I have a crazy great aunt that’s a big contributor, but getting her to agree is going to be a pain.”
He’s putting his money on the first option.
“Study. Group.” He scowls at the Weasley children. “Don’t spread rumors.”
Neville twists in his seat to glare at him. Lavender says, “What was–”
“If you were wondering,” Pansy says, in his ear and suddenly right next him. He’s not ashamed of the way his whole body jumps at the unexpected sound, twisting to look down at her. “You and You-Know-Who are just as disgusting.”
“I want you to the come to the party tonight, and not hide away just because you tried to murder everyone,” he says. “It doesn’t matter. They took your sister, so they got what they deserved. Besides, I stopped you from doing anything interesting, so all you did was show why you were chosen for this tournament in the first place. Big deal.”
“Maybe we’ll give it a couple meetings first?” he tries. “Either way, I have to get up there to let people through, otherwise there’s just going to be a bunch of kids hanging out in the girl’s bathroom, which I can’t imagine will go over well.”
doing here? Shouldn’t you be helping rehabilitate our new guests?”
Seriously? Is this the only plan they’re capable of? Luring him someplace so he can do their dirty work for them? He doesn’t know how they got anything done during the first war.
Cedric grips the doorknob, and the rest of them move out of the way. Just in case. He opens the door, and -
“That’s it,” she confirms.
Harry sighs through his nose, but decides to let it go. “Why are you and Hermione breaking up? I mean, she really likes you, you know?”
Harry figures it out once they’re three hours in the past. “Brilliant,” he breaths. “The second life Dumbledore was talking about – Buckbeak?”
“That’s a good question,” Nanaia snarls and for a moment Harry’s terrified that her anger is directed at him but then he turns and sees Dumbledore standing in the doorway.
“I tried to make it look a little like the Korean characters for danger,” Cedric says, pulling Harry away. “Whoever did that to Viktor is still here, and they can see it. I’m just hoping they don’t know Korean, and that Eun-hae figures it out. We need to get out of here before one of the professors gets here.”
“Lily!” Harry turns to see Snape frantically searching through the wreckage, pulling wood and glass aside, his hands turning bloody. “Lily, are you here? Say something!” He grabs onto a piece of glass, and curses, a deep gash forming down the center of his palm. “Where’s Potter? Where’s your kid?” He swallows, rubbing one of his bloody hands over his face. “Maybe everything’s fine and they all got away and the reason your point me spell isn’t working is because they’re under a powerful protection charm, and you’re acting like an idiot for no reason.”
Well, no.
“Uh,” he says, taken aback. There’s something rancid squirming at the bottom of his stomach, but he doesn’t want to be rude, not when so far she’s only been nice to him. “Just two.”
Fred puts his hands on his hips. “Anyway, as you were saying, Mr. Ollivander?”
They’re just nightmares. They don’t mean anything.
The twins are not thrilled about being left behind on this adventure, but even they can acknowledge that if anyone can successfully cause enough chaos at Hogwarts that no one will think to look too closely on who is or isn’t there, it’s them. Neville is equally unenthused, but considering the plant aspect of their little plan, he has to stay behind in order for it to work. They agree to spread instructions to the rest of the RA, which only leaves a couple more problems.
The doors close behind him and he looks up at her. “Thank you.”
True to his word, he swims away, although he doesn’t join the ranks of merpeople standing guard in front of the hostages. Instead he settles himself on the top of the city gates, watching the proceedings with a keen eye. Harry doesn’t have time to think on it anymore, since Cedric is swimming up to them. It doesn’t look like he got bitten, but he’s covered in scratches, including a particularly deep one on his leg that makes Harry wince when he sees it.
“You too,” Draco says, leaning in for a quick kiss. “Ready?”
Draco considers being humble for a moment, but where’s the fun in that? “Yes, it is.”
She sighs. “I don’t know who Katie is.”
“Um, I don’t know about the layers,” she says, “it-”
“Let him in,” Draco tells Tilly, then turns to his parents. “If you have any snide werewolf comments to make, now is the time to make them. Sirius will throw a fit if you try to say anything against him.”
Harry blinks, looking at his arm. Then everything catches up with him, and he yelps, “I have a boyfriend!”
Several boys and girls are giving him jealous looks, and it takes everything he has not to preen at having their eyes on him. The irony of him always complaining about Harry being attention seeking is not lost on him.
if you're worried about social media imploding but still want to keep up with me and my writing, you can sign up for
He’s lightheaded and his skin is clammy, but he’s not running. He shakes off Molly’s grip and thinks of Sirius’s smile, of Remus’s comforting hand on his back, of this entire summer of kindness. “Expecto patronum!”
“Wait, stop. You did what?” Harry demands. “Why was locking Umbridge in the forbidden room with the devil’s snare part of the plan? That was not part of the plan when I left. There’s not enough healing potions in the world to fix what she’s going to do to you.”
The professors had added in the ability to signal for help with red sparks as a safety measure. No one had expected any of the champions to use it.
that Harry can’t help but feel a twinge of sympathy. He takes out his wand and casts, “Expecto patronum!”
“Maybe you should do that? Bring Nagini with you,” he says.
Gryffindor won.
“Or both,” Ron says.
Although. It hadn’t made much difference, in the end.
All the Weasleys, Hermione, Fleur, and Neville are waiting for him when he steps back through the fireplace into his living room. He doesn’t get a chance to say anything before he’s mobbed and people are hugging him and ruffling his hair, and he sees his godfathers hanging back and grinning at him.
Draco thinks they’re getting a little side tracked. “So!” he says brightly, “The first task is dragons. Any advice for Harry on how not to die?”
“Hey guys,” he says, “anyone seen the Weasleys? Besides Bill.” What he’s really asking is if Ron’s seen Hermione yet, because he definitely wants to be here for that.
“What happened?” Millie cries, eyes tracking the places where Draco’s sure bruises have started to surface.
Even in death, Mothers can’t be compelled to appear against their will. But if Slughorn has gone to all this effort to try and tell them something, then why wouldn’t he answer them?
He’s already cured his fingers in the beginning of a snap when a familiar gruff voice shouts, “Wha’s this all this about, eh?”
Life threatening seems like kind of an exaggeration, what with Draco having been right there and all, but he’s smart enough to keep that to himself. “
His father is laid out on the couch, covered in deep lacerations, the floor a puddle of blood around him. Draco would think he was dead if it weren’t for the weak rise and fall of his chest. Narcissa grabs his arms, tugging at him, pleading, “Honey, honey please, I’ll sit with him until he’s gone, he won’t die alone, but you shouldn’t, you – you don’t need to see him like this.”
Then again, that opens the question of soulmates back up again, because the whole wizarding world knows that Harry has a soulmark, and he assumes both Luna and Millie know that Draco has one, since before second year neither of them had gone to any great lengths to hide it. They hadn’t flaunted it, which was good, since probably someone would have noticed if they’d gone from showing it off to keeping it covered all the time.
“During class,” he says, “Harry, come on, she wasn’t subtle.”
Sure enough, the head of Draco’s criminal cousin is floating in the fireplace. Harry throws himself on the ground in front of it, and he is so, so glad he called Winky to clean everything. “Sirius! You look better.”
Draco wants to feel offended, but honestly he’s just a little bit relieved Harry isn’t a complete idiot. Just because they’re soulmates doesn’t mean either of them have
“Hey,” he really didn’t want to make them sad, “it’s okay.” He wishes he’d grown up differently, he wishes he’d grown up with parents who loved him, with someone who loved him, grown up not being the darkest person in whatever room he happened to be in. But he can’t change that, there’s no time turner powerful enough for that. “You can tell me what I’ve missed. Did my dad speak another language? He did, right? It’s a wizard thing, and he was a wizard.”
She’s flying into the clouds, so he’s basically climbing straight up. But he grabs the spike in front of him, and hauls himself up, feeling with his feet until he can use her back spikes like a very awkward ladder.
“I’m going to let you go now. If you attack me or mine, we will have
“Yeah, and? They were broken, now they’re not, problem solved.” If Hagrid wasn’t so resilient, he wouldn’t have used it, but a half giant can withstand a lot more blunt force magic than a normal human, and the soft fiddly spells are harder to cast. “Don’t ever do that though.”
“You’re very different from your father,” Asim says, and Draco’s eyes narrow. He knows a lot people would consider that a compliment, but he likes his dad, actually, so. “But in some ways you’re very similar. Your father made a choice once and I helped him deal with the consequences.”
“What kind of convoluted,” she starts then cuts herself off. “It wasn’t because they were connected. It was so you could find him.”
“I thought you said you didn’t take alchemy?” Harry asks.
This isn’t
, and it seems silly to go downstairs and then have to come back up to shower. Plus he has an insane urge to scrub his skin off, so the sooner he takes care of that, the better.
“They kind of already are, Mum,” Charlie says, cringing even as he says it. “Look, Voldemort is going to keep coming after Harry, and he’s one of ours.” Harry’s whole face flushes a bright red. “What’s Ron supposed to do if Harry’s attacked? Run away? Should Ginny lie over and play dead? Perhaps the twins can apparate away and leave Harry to be tortured or killed or both? Is that what you want?”
George instantly relaxes. He ruffles his hair, whispers “Thanks,” and is gone down the hall towards his own common room.
“Come with me,” Fleur says, hooking her arm through Harry’s. “There are more friends for you to see again. Your auror friend is here too.”
Nagini has slithered over to Draco and curled around his feet. She says, “
Ron kicks him and Draco rolls his eyes. Harry at least has the decency to look sheepish.
“Mum, please,” Percy says, rubbing at his forehead. “Harry tells them everything anyway. They led a defense against a swarm of dementors. Just let them sit at the table. George and Fred are seventeen anyway.”
“It’s an awful big coincidence if she doesn’t,” Hermione says from his other side. “But if anyone had said anything, we’d know about it, since we charmed the sign up sheet. Trust me.”
She’s the most beautiful woman he’s ever seen.
He sighs and snaps the book shut. He turns to his friends and sighs at their flat stares. “What? What did you expect me to do?”
“I know,” he’s smiling, seemingly in spite of himself. “Ronald is a good man. But I will be in Bulgaria, and he will be here. With her.” He shrugs. “I like to think I’m a good man too. If she is single when I meet her next, then perhaps we can try again. But I will not be the reason she and Ronald do not find happiness with each other.”
Percy edges closer to them, but stays out of the way even as he wrings his hands together. Harry wants to take his hand or something, but he looks like he might shatter if he tries to touch him.
“She’s what?” Harry frowns.
“I’ve been of that opinion for some time now,” Sirius says, “but what did he do?”
Lavender’s eyes light up and she opens her mouth.
Filius glances at the wards and says wryly, “Maybe with two hours and some scratch paper.”
He didn’t make it out of that graveyard just to be killed here. “Glacius,” he casts, turning the ground beneath Moody’s feet to ice. He slips, and Harry throws out a stunning spell while he gets back to his feet. It hits, but once again Moody manages to shake it off. He hates being this weak, this useless.
“Make … charms?” he tries. “I don’t know. What does one do with a charms mastery besides teach and make things? I like making things. Healer then,” he says, because Poppy is sitting right there, and he’s finally gotten to the point where he’s only exploding the hearts about half the time.
,” he says, slipping into Japanese because if Luna’s skills with her mother’s language get rusty, his mum will somehow make this his fault. If Xeno would speak to her in literally anything but English or Latin, they wouldn’t have this problem. “
Harry nudges him in the side. “Did you want to go find a broom closet to make out in?”
“No,” he says. “Pansy, absolutely not. Your family is just as tied up in Voldemort’s mess as mine is.”
Hermione is looking at her toast so intently that Draco sure hopes it contains something like the secrets to the universe, or possibly some sort of study guide, but he’s pretty sure she’s trying to hide that she’s blushing. “It’s alright, you and Harry get lunch, I’m pretty sure Pansy had plans to kidnap me anyway.”
Winky appears at Remus’s elbows, holding a teacup on saucer. She holds it up to him, “For Mister Werewolf.”
He pauses, stepping back enough to examine Draco’s hip, clearly seeing the marigolds against his skin, and his flushes as his eyes darken. His mouth opens, but no sound comes out.
“Too young,” mutters Theodore. “Quirrell? He did kill him. Technically.”
“No, I know. Sorry. It’s just,” he frowns, “I really expected him to be gone longer. I thought I was being overly cautious. That was a short trip.”
Also, he’d like for none of them to die, if possible, that would be nice too.
Draco shrugs, pretending to be unconcerned, and turns to Lupin, “Do we have an understanding?”
He’s had his wand out this whole time. It’s not especially distinctive, long and bendy, stained a brown so dark it looks black and a diamond cut along the tops and bottom of the handle, hardly noticeable. Not anything flashy, not like Ginny’s red wand with runes curved up the sides, but distinctive enough if one knew what to look for.
“Why are you friends with Snape?” he asks. “You are friends, aren’t you? It seemed like it.”
Draco intends to go home, he really does.
, and not to scourgify himself and then walk back to the dungeon. It’s nearly dark when he finishes and makes his way back to the castle, but he doesn’t bother to light a lumos charm. He’s walked this path so many times he could do it blind, so he can certainly manage it under moonlight.
He hears yelling outside the hospital wing doors. It’s possible there’s been yelling this whole time, and was just too focused on not killing his transfiguration professor to pay it any attention. Katie casts a nervous glance towards the door, then looks back to McGonagall. “She wouldn’t want anyone to see her like this.”
Harry is so confused. “Yes? Lots of people? We came in through the floo.”
“If you did get the sword,” he starts off with, even though it’s impossible, of course it’s impossible, because no way can he convince of the board of governors to hand over a founder’s sword, “then would you be willing to do it?”
, Harry’s bit of the map says next, and he has to bite his lip to keep from laughing.
She matches his glare and makes a cross with her forearms in front of her chest. He hates this, but he trusts Millie. If she’s telling him not to do anything, she must have a reason. They should really learn sign language.
Kreacher appears in the kitchen. “Young Lord Malfoy is-”
“Draco Malfoy,” he says, and his voice sounds silky, like Snape when he’s not yelling. “I’ve heard of you. Interesting boy.”
“You were a kept man before, you just refused to use the money,” Sirius accuses. Harry raises an eyebrow. “Remus has had access to my personal accounts since I was seventeen, and I added him to the Black family accounts when my mother died. There’s literally no reason for him to have worked while I was in Azkaban.”
He tugs it off and reads:
She glances up, sees that they’re all staring at her, and flushes. “I’m not - I don’t particularly want to go charging into the ministry to get killed, but I just want us to be sure we’re thinking this choice through. Do we save everyone, because that’s who we are, because that’s what we’ve always done? Or do we pick and choose, and is our personal dislike our only metric for denial?”
Bloody hell, sometimes the things out of zir mouth are like knives.
He likes Hagrid’s hut. It feels like the Weasley’s, almost, someplace safe and warm where he always feels welcome. “Dragons?” he prompts.
What the hell, Sirius had barely glanced at him before placing him. He stares down at his hands, confused, because it’s been close to an hour since he last had a sip of Polyjuice potion, so it’s probably about time that he drink more, but he still looks like Colin, right? He still has Colin’s hands, so he presumably has his face, he’s even wearing the kid’s clothes, what could have tipped Sirius off, he’d only asked a question, and one that it wouldn’t be weird for Colin to ask, right? He’d been in the same house as Percy for two years.
“I don’t know how you’re going to manage a small wedding, since between you and Tonks you’ll have a significant amount of the ministry who will either be offended or panic at not being invited,” Ron muses. “Excellent job with the polls, by the way.”
Ron hadn’t even told Hermione she looked nice.
“Bellatrix is the one who put him under the imperius curse this last time and she’s the one who killed him,” Harry says.
“Say, theoretically, you wanted to enhance the property of one thing with another but the thing you were using to enhance the property would taint the other material it was being combined with. Could you combine to get the enhancing effect and then transfigure it to be the same material without losing the enhancing effect? Would that work?”
what everyone needs. They’re laughing and screeching, and for a moment Harry’s worried Theophania is going to come out to tell them all to be quiet, but she stays coiled and out of sight in her statue. The meeting ends up running long, and by the end of it they’re all covered in colors. Cho and Cedric had been determined to get each other as colorful as possible, and the entirety of Ravenclaw had turned on Quinn, who had so many colors layered on top of zir that it’s nearly impossible to tell any of them apart. Draco is painted head to toe in green while Blaise, miraculously, doesn’t have single spot on him.
He doesn’t move.
this chapter ended up being pretty draco heavy, but don't worry! now we're getting into the real mystery/plot of this year and harry will have a lot chances to shine now that he'll be in more stupid and dangerous situations, which is where he does his best work
attention. But would you consider it?”
“Because Anastasia is very, very clever, Voldemort is an idiot, and Slughorn has had a rough time of it,” he answers. Pansy reaches for her wand, so he quickly summons the necromancy book and flips to the reverse killing curse that they couldn’t figure out and holds it out to them, even though he knows they can’t read it. “I’m an idiot. We all understood the spell just fine we just didn’t have the context to understand what it was for. I just didn’t know what I was looking at because I didn’t think it was possible. Once you enter Mother’s Shadow, there’s no coming back alive. If you return to our realm from there, you become a ghost. That’s it. No exceptions.” He taps the page. “Except this one. Anastasia figured out a way to get to Mother’s Shadow and then to leave it and
“I’m not going to hurt you,” he says. “Show me your hands.”
Draco softens, although not by much. “You’re being overdramatic. My parents are here. They won’t let him kill me.
Ron gives a bark of laughter, and Hermione lets out a scandalized, “
“Like. Half?” he guesses.
“We leave her,” Blaise says.
“You don’t want to own games? Or books?” Hermione asks, “Really?”
“Yes, Master Draco,” she says. “Is you okay?”
Sirius and Remus look at each other for a long moment. As far as Harry can tell, they don’t move or make a sound, but then Sirius says, “All right, you can work in the attic. But only if you want to, and you can stop at any time. Of course Neville can come over. Remus will have to go get him if we want him to survive coming through the wards.”
His eyes narrow. “What could you possibly be working on that’s related to this? Aren’t you working on the obsidian design issue? And don’t you have several papers to write and submit for publication?”
He stumbles downstairs, Ron and Ginny following after him. He doesn’t know where the twins are this early, but he assumes they’re out because if they were here, they’d be coming down too. It’s Hermione’s excited scream, so there’s no rush, but they all know if they don’t get down there fast enough she’ll come up after them.
“So have you thought about our proposition?” Quinn asks, skipping right pasts the pleasantries.
Clean. Fix. Remus and Sirius will clean and fix the attic. “I want to help!” he says, then, “
“You’re not my girlfriend,” he says, but he sounds more weary than irritated.
“I am!” She grabs his hand, “We are, on our carriage. I want you to come! And your friends, Blaise and Pansy.” Some of her enthusiasm leaves her, and she wilts. “Viktor is celebrating on his boat. I am sad there is not a place we can all celebrate together. We have all succeeded today!”
Blaise is just watching the living wood tornado with a completely blank face, while Pansy is casting something he can’t see, and Cedric stands in front of them both, wand held out in front of him.
There’s a moment of discomfort, like his body isn’t sure what’s happening, and then he can breathe again. Dozens of inferi are headed straight for him, which he hopes at least means some of them have abandoned the shore so Catalina has less of them to hold back. He hastily raises his wand in front of him. “Protego!”
“Is it the same one?” he asks. Even looking at it more closely, he can’t really tell. Harry looks down at him and nods. Draco figures if he tries to speak, it will just come out as Parseltongue, not English. “Is it going to help?”
Draco reaches for his wand, but she’s faster. The last thing he sees is a bright red light.
He banishes the open book back to his room. He knows that Dumbledore can’t read it, but he doesn’t want him looking at it, doesn’t want to take the chance that he’ll be able to sense something off or strange about it.
He took a sip, the sweetness of the mallow-sweet and honey cut by the earthy taste of the camomile and the lavender.
Harry looked up, his one open eye blurry without his glasses. The blob definitely had ice blonde hair and considering the voice was male, it would have to be Draco. Draco approached him and set a smaller, blonde blob down next to Harry on the bed. He felt a tug at the hospital gown and Minty hoisted herself closer to Harry's face, her small cheek pressed against his neck and her warm breath tickling his beard.
"Magical warfare is horrific, but we all have the ability to cast those spells. If your family was in danger, you probably wouldn't hesitate," Sergeant Parrish continued, "Muggle warfare is different. The Killing Curse leaves no physical violence behind."
Harry's mouth drops open, "Gin, what the hell? You said you were fine with me and Draco!"
Narcissa moved to sit on his bed, leaning in to kiss him gently and whisper, "If you ever do that to me again, Draco, I will fucking hex you into next week." Draco squeaked his shock at his mother uttering a curse word. He clasped his hand in hers, and nodded frantically. "Draco, my love, I am so proud of you, you saved Hermione today." Narcissa shot a fond look to the sleeping brunette as she spoke loud enough for the rest of the room to hear. Draco looked to his mother and then to Kingsley, "Nott?" Kingsley frowned slightly and sighed, looking to Ron and George who were studiously looking at their shoes. "Well, after you took the hit, the rest of your friends arrived for your lunch date. Amazingly," Kingsley sounded a little sarcastic here, "they
"Oh, well. Maybe take one of those really long baths you never get anymore?" Harry couldn't help but lower his voice and whisper, "Enjoy one of those books you pretend you don't buy."
"Aye, done deal," Seamus chuckled and leaned into Dean's shoulder, "It's your family history though, do you want to let that go?"
The woman gives Harry a look that reminds him of Aunt Petunia, "You will leave Draco alone. You've done enough to him for a life time."
"Perfect, now open it and-" Dawlish begins but as Harry yanks on the door of the cabinet eagerly, the force of his movement topples the cabinet over onto him.
"Harry..."
Hermione was in tears, she laughed, "So, you're not cheating on me and you didn't get into a fight with Draco? You've been so weird!" Ron quirked a sheepish smile, "You're so smart, love. I thought you'd look me in the eye and work out that Draco and I had gone to buy a ring just from looking at me." Hermione threw her arms around Ron and kissed him hard. "Ronald Weasley, I love you. Of course it's a yes!" Hermione heard a cheer go up behind her, everyone had quietly gathered just outside the back door and had watched the proposal. Everyone was cheering and smiling at her and Ron. Except for Harry, who was looking at Draco like Ron had looked at her.
"Fuck, ow!" Harry scrabbles for his wand and casts an Episkey, "You've got a - great arm?"
Victoire flushes and Teddy comes to rescue her.
"Can I try?" Harry asked.
Healer Gurjeet stood casting spells and adjusting potion dosages for ten minutes before placing a hand on Harry's wrist, "Harry, I know it feels like there is no way forward, but you're strong enough to recover from this. There's not much more I can do here. I'll see you later, Marcie." The medi-witch waved and continued to monitor the vitals.
"Harry!" He turned to Pansy and asked her to repeat the question. "What's your dream date? A - a night in Paris. B - a picnic date in the country. C - an intimate night at home. D - dinner and dancing." Harry thought about it, wondering how Draco would want to be treated on a date. "Er, I think a night in Paris?" Everyone turned to look at him, Harry blushed, "What?" Luna smiled and continued lining Ron's curtains with glittering daisies, "We were just surprised, Harry, we thought you'd want the casual picnic. Perhaps your choice in date is more reflective of the person you'd want to take with you then." Harry blushed furiously, he hoped no one noticed, they were mostly watching Luna decorate.
Harry shuddered and ran to the Floo, vomiting on the floor of his living room when he arrived.
"How long until the new little one?" Hermione sits with Draco on the settee, both of their mugs of tea resting on pregnant bellies.
"Mother mixed up her creme brûlée this year by using some of the maple syrup that Charlie brought back when he rescued that Colddrake. I thought it tasted like treacle tart but a bit more adult." Draco was eating a profiterole and Harry's mouth went dry watching Draco licking cream off his fingers. Ron kicked him under the table.
"You're not an Auror anymore, as you well know. Get out of here," Susan snaps.
Hermione watched the barely concealed hurt on Draco's face at Harry's rejection. Ginny met her gaze and rolled her eyes dramatically. Nearly everyone in the family had worked out how those two felt about each other just by watching them watch each other. Ron and his brothers had a - heavily disapproved of - betting pool about when they'd realise and get together. Bill had bet on Christmas Day, to everyone's laughter and mocking. Charlie had Valentine's Day - which was met with as much scoffing as Bill's choice. Fleur had disparaged her husband and his family's sense of romance heavily in French for betting on the love of two innocent boys. Fleur had taken to Draco, Cissa and Andy immediately, the four of them gabbing away in French quite often. Hermione knew Fleur had tried to convince Draco to take a chance on telling Harry. Draco remained convinced that Harry was angry at him for being gay. Ron flew past with a cauldron and knocked over a table lamp. Hermione scowled, she was very annoyed indeed.
"I'm glad we sorted our shit out," Harry snorts.
"You were - you fucked two of my fellow graduates in the toilets at the after party," Draco's voice was cold.
Harry had no words of comfort, so he let go of Draco's hand and wrapped his arms around him instead. Draco leaned into Harry's chest, sobbing quietly as the tears spilt over. Harry felt stinging at his own eyes and let the tears fall. Tears for the pain that he and Draco had been through, tears for the loved ones they lost, tears for the loss of their childhoods.
"Yes," Harry agreed.
." Hermione elbowed Ron for his rude statement and turned to smile at Narcissa who was quietly glowing at the sight of Harry pulling back from his kiss to lean his forehead against Draco's. Hermione agreed with Ron, though less vulgarly. She felt tears prickle her eyes at her happiness that Draco was okay. Bill laughed warmly and congratulated the boys, before turning to Ron and George. "Anyone have the 31st March in the pot?" Arthur Weasley looked amused and commented, "Actually, Bill, I think you'll find it's nearly half twelve in the morning."
"A lot." Draco's hand was in his and a wry look on his face, "I get it. I've been seeing a Mind Healer for the last six months. Especially after the bomb... I only stayed at school because Professor McGonagall asked me to not let the bastard win."
"Kreacher," Harry called out, Kreacher popping back in front of them immediately. "Yes, Master Harry?" Kreacher waited for his direction. "Er, I'm so sorry to bother you again, but we're going to head back to Grimmauld now, I wonder if you could go get some things for Draco, Narcissa and Andromeda?" Kreacher looked delighted to so wholly serve the Noble House of Black, "Of course, Master Harry," and quickly received requests from the three others on what they would require. Kreacher bowed and promised he would meet them at Grimmauld Place with their belongings.
Hermione thought the street was rather quiet for a Friday, she frowned, surely this was unusual? Her instinct was proven accurate just a few moments later when an "
"What? I've never had anything like that!" Harry objects, "Please, tell me, does Draco Malfoy still work here as a trainee Healer?"
Harry sighs and leaves them to head home to Ginny.
Arthur's hand tightened on his wife's knee. "There is just
Draco sighs and pulls a box out of his pocket and flicks it across the table to Harry. He opens it and sees the ring he'd bought for Draco just after Christmas 1999. The gold band had been engraved with Celtic lover's knots, Harry had seen it by chance when out in Muggle London and thought it perfect for Draco.
"You're a liar," Draco gripped his wrists and pulled him upright, "But we'll look past that. You're freezing, go have a shower and change."
Susan's expression darkens, "You need to leave, Potter."
₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪
Andromeda shakes her hand, her sister stepping up beside her to examine it, "Luckily, I am not so much of a lady as my sister."
Harry steps out onto the floor and sees Susan standing near her desk. "Susan, what the hell happened to me?"
"Thank you, Draco. Er, can I?" Draco nodded and ducked his head, while Harry worked out which tap was the hair potion. He was more nervous as he started to run his fingers through Draco's hair. It was longer than he'd let it grow at school, Harry marvelled at the silky strands slipping through his fingers. The hair turned from a dull silver to bright white when Draco ducked his head again in the water to rinse it. Harry stared at Draco's chest and froze. Draco must have noticed the hesitation because he grabbed another soft cloth and some cleansing potion and started to scrub his arms.
Nott snarled at her, "Oh, shut the fuck up, you revolting waste of magical talent!
Harry rolls them over, Auror reflexes catching Draco by surprise. Harry buries his lips into Draco's neck and grinds against him.
Hermione and Ron were torn between supporting Draco's relationship and supporting Harry's dislike of it. The rest of the Weasleys all fell on the spectrum between being ambivalent about Celia to not minding her, hence her invitation to the annual Christmas Eve party. Harry was coping with this intrusion with the comfort that she was not invited to spend Christmas Day with the families and an enormous glass of Firewhiskey. Narcissa caught Harry's eye across the room and jerked her head towards the kitchen. Harry extricated himself from Ron's drunken embrace and dodged a stumbling Bill (being scolded by Fleur).
And all would be well.
"HARRY!" Hermione whipped her wand on him after she had taken care of the last attacker, "What were you thinking?!" She rushed to Draco's side, casting spell after spell over his chest, before Levitating Draco carefully to transport him. Harry could feel panic rushing in his mind, when he stared at Draco's limp body he could barely see his chest move. "I - I reacted. He was casting at me..." Hermione looked at him with an expression that ran his blood cold, "He was blindfolded, injured and afraid. What the hell is your excuse?" Hermione drifted Draco carefully into the hall, followed by Neville, who shot Harry a loaded look before rushing after her. "Mate," Ron looked at him like Harry had disappointed him. He supposed he had. "Mate, might be best if you head to McGonagall. Give her the heads up on this lot," gesturing to the knocked out students on the floor. Ron ran after his girlfriend, leaving Harry to an overwhelming sense that he had just decimated his family in one moment.
"Well, I happen to know a wizard who will have plenty of spare rooms in three months time," Draco was still staring at their feet.
George nodded and stood up, pointedly looking at Pansy. Luna stood and pulled Pansy along by hand, kissing Harry's cheek as she went, "It's okay, Harry, I don't think you'll hurt Draco again." Harry flushed at her blunt words and nodded to George as the trio slipped out of the Hospital Wing. Draco regarded Harry blankly, he knew Harry was going to apologise. He wasn't sure if he could bring himself to continue to be upset with Harry. "Draco-" Harry immediately choked up and threw himself onto Draco's shoulder. Draco moved his arm up automatically to cradle Harry, who was now sobbing into his neck. "Shhh, c'mon Potter, I'm fine, I'm fine." Harry hiccuped a little and scrubbed his face with his sleeve, "I am so sorry. I just- I just reacted and Hermione yelled at me and said you were trying to cast a Shield and I am such an idiot."
"What makes you so sure that I love you too?" Draco was flushing now.
Harry had realised when Draco opened his bedroom drawers that there were clothes in there. Kreacher had known Harry had been running for his life for the last year and had made sure if Harry came home there'd be clean, warm clothing. Harry felt incredibly vulnerable at the small gesture. He was finally safe. He felt his fear, sadness, hunger and fatigue overwhelm him. He barely heard Draco over his sobs, he felt strong hands wrench him up by his underarms and arms wrap around him. He was promptly placed down on something solid and cool, Harry found that Draco had sat him on the bathtub and was gently removing his shoes and socks.
Harry woke with a start in a comfortable bed, and turned to look out the sloping window, the sun filtering through miserable clouds. Harry didn't remember coming up to bed, which meant that Draco must have carried him. Harry flushed at the thought and decided to get dressed and not think about it too much. After a quick shower, Harry raced downstairs to find everyone. Hearing voices in his kitchen, he headed into the room with a restless energy, only to be stopped short by the sight in front of him.
"I'm Sergeant John Lee Parrish. You can call me Sergeant, John or Mr. Parrish. Whatever is most comfortable. You know why you're here," the tall American wizard was dressed casually, but his military background showed with his crisply pressed clothing and neat hairstyle.
I don't understand what the Healer is saying anymore. Why do I need counselling? I went through a war and no one tried to make me have that. Well, Hermione did. She dragged me to a Muggle and told her that I'd been through a Muggle war and had some stress thing. The Muggle said I didn't have the stress disorder but that I was depressed. Of course I'm depressed, everyone I've ever seen as a parent was murdered - mostly in front of me.
Christmas was difficult for Harry. Molly kept telling them how happy she was that they were home and spoilt them with food - including a new array of vegetarian dishes for Harry. All Harry could see were the absences; Fred, Tonks, Remus, Sirius, Mad-eye, Dumbledore, Dobby.
"Don't forget - Healer today," Hermione said before disappearing.
"Yes, although make sure you don't say anything, she allegedly doesn't know," Draco winked.
"Seeing things..." Harry replied.
"It won't be the same, maybe not ever, maybe not for a long time," Ron replied.
"Teddy would love another sister," Harry coos at baby Alma.
Ron clapped him on the shoulder, "Excellent, mate, we can have our Sunday scrimmages here!" Bill had joined them and laughed at Ron's delighted squeal.
- literally 'five years of pain'. Causes the cursee to lose all their memories and act out of character for five years. They questioned the smugglers, one of the witches remembered the gem. She said it was an old curse, designed to hurt enemies of Dark Magic practitioners. The gem belonged to my dearest Aunt Bella as it turns out. Mother remembers Rodolphus gave her a box of gems which was heavily warded on their wedding day, she suspects that's how Bellatrix had it."
For a moment Harry thinks he’s going to veto the ruling on principle, but then his shoulders slump and he mutters, “The motion is passed.”
If the Slytherins are determined to follow his lead, then he has to do it first.
“They’ve got eyes on your dad,” he blurts out, before he can think better of it. Lucius may be a murderous Death Eater, but he didn’t kill Harry when he had the chance, and Draco loves him. That’s more than enough reason to protect him, as far as Harry’s concerned.
“Mothers!” he snaps. “Can we focus please? I’m assuming I only have a limited amount of time here.”
“Uh,” he says, “why? Because if you need to do anything in the book, that’s probably a bad idea? I mean, maybe it’ll be fine, but maybe it won’t be, and if you want to do necromancy then you should probably just let me do it instead. I won’t ask any questions if you don’t want me to.”
They’re all filing out when Percy walks over and says, “If I do paperwork during the party, that’s fine, right?”
“Sorry,” he squeaks, “never mind, I was just thinking out loud.”
Draco turns back around, rolling his eyes. “I’m tired, Harry, not dead.”
“Harry?” Remus mutters as he tears his eyes away from the parchment. He looks up, blinks, then shouts, “Harry!”
Harry comes to the same conclusion he does at the exact same time. Draco knows this because they lean into each other at the same moment, not quite back to back but close enough. “We’re not alone.”
when it’s hard. I don’t know if you’re marked, but if you are, I want you to know that having a soulmate, even meeting that soulmate, isn’t a guarantee of love and happiness. I think, at best, a soulmate is a possibility. It’s a possible happy ending, and if you want to take a chance on that, to work for that, then you should. But I’ve already found my happy ending, and it’s with Eun-hae. I love her. I choose her every day, and every day I work really hard so that she keeps choosing me back. That’s what love is. Not some marks on our skin, but hard work.”
They are so, so lucky that they’re marks in a place that’s easy to hide. Otherwise they have wouldn’t have been able to get away with any of this.
Well, that’s fair enough. He’d thought he was in for the night, so he’s already changed into his pajamas. Harry wasn’t wearing pajamas when he called, so Draco’s assuming that he shouldn’t either. He leaves the badges to Winky and goes back to his dorm room.
Harry’s about to ask what information he’s supposed to have gotten with that when he realizes that the answer is yes, context filtering into his mind to make sense of those sensations, and oh, that’s – if Slughorn ha explained what the spell would do, maybe Harry wouldn’t have cast it.
He drops it, because if Harry figures something out he’ll tell the rest of them, and he’s still preoccupied with his ow Snape related mystery, which has unfortunately taken a back seat to replicating the Griffin sword and trying to help Harry unravel the secrets the necromancy book.
Hermione pushes herself between them, but only so she can elbow them both in the side at the same time. “Could you shut up for five minutes?”
“Harry!” his dorm mates cry, crowding around him.
Harry stares, feeling hot and horribly itchy all over. “This is extremely manipulative.”
Cedric and Cho arrive, and Harry’s eyes widen. They’re not wearing dress robes.
Cassius is wary, which is not a good sign. “Fine. Not good enough to fix your hands.”
Merlin. He hopes he and Harry didn’t used to be this bad. “I’ll send a patronus if I end up leaving for my break, but I should head out before I’m late.” He kisses Harry on the cheek, flips off everyone else when they start making fun of him, and heads to the floo.
The RA lets out a collective groan, except for Cho, who’s laughing.
“Some people were fooled,” mutters a second year, and within thirty seconds the whole table is getting into a loud political debate, if it can be called that, since half of it is just trash talking Umbridge and Fudge.
That changes when Fred and George corner him after class and give him the best thing he’s ever received – the Marauder’s Map.
was wondering that,” Ron insists. Hermione’s contemplative look is the most disturbing thing Harry’s ever seen, and he’s including the time he accidentally reanimated a couple dozen corpses in various states of decomposition.
Snape might have a point. The ability to use wandless magic with anything more complicated than first year spells would really come in handy about now.
He’s freezing, but it’s amazing. They break through the clouds, and she slows down, adjusts herself so she’s flying in lazy circles. Harry can’t see anything beneath the clouds, but it doesn’t matter. She’s warm, and the air is cold, and he never wants to land. Payne glides next to them. “
He’s tired, but not too tired to summon the map from Hermione’s room. It materializes in his hands, and they have safeguards in place, no one but the six of them can summon it. No sooner has he completed the spell than Fudge snatches it from his hands. “It’s blank!”
Draco’s so thankful he doesn’t have siblings to tattle on him. He’s glad other people do, though.
“Whenever I looked at the equations, they were a different language that I couldn’t read,” Hermione explains. “So I just copied them down as I saw them and then translated them. Since the book’s translations are accurate, just unreadable by the person trying to read it, I just needed to see which of the possible three paths were replicated in other languages. After the fourth translation, it was obvious.”
“I don’t see any ladies around here,” he says, offering Susan his arm.
The is far better than being tied to a gravestone with Voldemort and his followers, all alone.
“He’s trying to destroy them!” Harry hurries. “I think. Although I don’t know how successful he’s going to be without some basilisk venom handy.”
Blaise doesn’t answer him, just turning away and looking out his window, shoulders high and tense. Pansy says, “It’s probably better if you go alone. The Bulstrodes like the Malfoys.”
There are still people running and screaming below them, and his friends are using every ounce of their strength to help them. How can he do any differently? Of course he does, of course he has enough happiness. He has to.
“They don’t do that, love,” Draco says.
Yeah, okay. Azkaban has like, five dementors left. He’ll escape and run away to France. Or Romania. He can ride dragons and as long as he has a wyvern handy, he can even translate for Charlie and the other trainers.
He comes to the uncomfortable realization that the mud beneath his feet is probably a result of blood soaked soil. “I think I’m going to be sick,” he says, and he won’t, but his stomach is definitely rolling in an uncomfortable manner. They’ve deal with a lot, seen a lot, but this is still – well, a lot. “Should we be here?”
“All the patients' room are soundproofed,” he says, wrinkling his nose at the bags under Asim’s eyes and his rumpled clothes, “Did you sleep here last night? Wasn’t Pilar supposed to take the overnight shift?”
“I don’t care that you’re a werewolf!” he says, furious, “We were down there with Pettigrew and dementors, and you were the least monstrous of them all, even when you transformed. It’s – terrifying, and awful. But I don’t suppose you can help being a werewolf any more than Millie can help having a muggle mother, or Hermione being a mudblood, or Hagrid a half-breed. So – so I’ve decided it doesn’t matter.”
Poppy’s eyes are wider than he’s ever seen them, and he does get a thrill out of surprising her for once, but he’s mostly focused on McGonagall. Her face is cycling through several different emotions, most of them different shades of surprised, but the one she settles on is warm, and it makes something relax inside of him that he hadn’t even realized was tense. Harry loves her. It would gut him if she disapproved of them, if she thought less of Harry because he was his soulmate. It takes her several seconds to clear her throat, and then she says, “Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.”
Harry turns his head to look at him and the anger doesn’t shift but he holds out his arm, which is all the invitation that Draco needs. He still feels exhaustion pulling at him, but he rolls to his feet and slides under the blanket next to his boyfriend. These hospital wing beds were obviously not meant to be shared and there’s definitely not nearly enough room for them to lie side by side. Draco tolerates lying halfway off the edge for a moment before he rolls on top of Harry instead, resting his legs between Harry’s and digging his sharp chin into his chest.
There are hours before breakfast, so he has enough time to shower and look like a proper human being, thank Merlin. He steps inside the common room to see Millie dressed for the day and yet another muggle book in her hands. “Do you ever sleep?” falls out of his mouth before he can think better of it. She’s up at in the middle the night and hours before the start of the day. There has to be some sort of explanation.
“Are you going to translate that?” Draco asks.
His smile doesn’t waver. “Positive.”
Wait a second.
It’s not until he turns around that he sees a letter on his bed atop his copy of the Daily Prophet. Percy’s face is on the cover, and he’s itching to read the article, but he opens his letter first. That familiar artful cursive can only mean that it’s from his mother.
“Viktor’s here, somewhere,” Harry says, scanning the crowd. “Don’t you want to see him?”
“We have them sign a magical contract,” Hermione says suddenly, although considering how confidently she’s speaking it doesn’t sound like this idea has only occurred to her just now. “It’ll be binding. They physically won’t be able to talk about the lessons to anyone who’s not involved with them. Not without magical consequences.”
Ailauni shrugs. “It’s not too often that such a thing enters our waters. When we sensed it, it seemed foolish not to act, since the prince has decided to involve himself.”
Then there’s a scream, and he recognizes it, it’s Winky’s. He runs forward, pushing Snape out of his way and bursting through. It’s one of the strangest sights he’s ever seen. What looks to be all the castle’s elves are clustered around, yelling, and in the middle is Dumbledore standing there looking serene as ever, McGonagall holding back
Harry shakes his head. “No. They were friends. They were
Blaise snorts and Ron rolls his eyes. “When we got here, Pansy was already like this. Hermione just joined her.”
“Where is my sister?” she cries, her accent coming out much thicker than Fleur’s. “They said she would come get me!”
Her fingertips are bruised and even scabbed over in places. “Seriously?” he snaps, stabbing his wand at them. “Episkey!”
“No, and if we were, we wouldn’t tell anyone. Just like my grandmother kept it a secret her whole life, like her father did, and like her great grandmother did. We have a history of it in our family, although no one currently has the ability.”
The fact that they want to keep this from Umbridge goes without saying.
Catalina, Sharon, and Slughorn all speak over each other, trying to reassure him, and his whole face is burning, he should have just taken the compliment and moved on.
“Can’t you put a little effort into not being seen sneaking into our common room?” Millie complains. “Also, you and Cassius are disgusting.”
She looks like she’s getting ready for an argument, but Ron just shrugs and says, “Okay.”
Harry doesn’t know what they’re talking about until Fred takes out his wand and casts a muffling charm around the room.
“Tom had enough time to run away, so you did too,” she says stubbornly. “You could have even left me after that, taken your shield and gotten to safety. But you didn’t. You risked your life to stay by my side and protect me.
His lower lip juts out. “Need it.”
Harry grins and then he grabs him around the waist and kisses him, and it’s unfair how good Harry is at this now. Draco melts against him, fisting his hands in the front of Harry’s robes. Maybe he was a little hasty in putting his hair up. Harry pulls back and then kisses his nose, grinning. “You’re the best soulmate ever.”
He glances behind her. Tonks waves at him, and he waves back. “No,” Sophia says. “But that doesn’t mean-”
He got the highest defense score this year. Not just at Hogwarts, but in all of Europe, since all the European magical schools take Owls and Newts.
Draco doesn’t look that much better than Tonks, and Harry wants to make him rest, wants to get Winky to help force feed him something to get the exhausted look off his face, wants to kiss him and hide underneath the blankets with him, away from the rest of the world.
He shakes his head, suddenly much more concerned with leaving than with getting any answers. Anastasia pokes him in the forehead and unbidden he sees a memory that doesn’t belong to him, an old man looming over him with a long beard and unkept hair and eyes like he’s just been electrocuted. “True power exits in neither life nor death,” he rasps, “but in the place in between.”
“I can’t break into the ministry on my own,” he argues, mind whirring. Is he going to do this? Is he really doing to do this, something so insane, for someone who doesn’t even like him?
His father steps in, similarly attired, and takes a seat next to him, watching him carefully. Draco tries to summon a smile, but he doesn’t think he does a very good job. “Are you really sure that you don’t want to go somewhere else? Anywhere else?”
Harry can’t help but agree. If this is the trade off between Voldemort not being as likely to try and kill him as usual, then he’s pretty sure it’s not worth it.
Ron nods towards Draco. “How good is your material manipulation?”
She continues staring at him.
“No, it’s fine, Severus has been summoned to a Death Eater meeting in a couple of days anyway,” Remus says. “Harry, this is so dangerous, he could be killed, or worse. Why is he doing this? Does he need a rescue? We’ll go get him.”
“We love you,” Remus says, reaching for him, but pausing when he remembers that he can’t touch him. “Please don’t astral project again.”
mad about this!”
The current status of the Death Eater is mostly unknown, because, apart from those rounded up at the ministry, the rest are in hiding.
His boyfriend sighs, glancing ahead them to where Viktor and Hermione have gotten swallowed by the crowd. “I just – they’re so close to being – you know. I just – what if it gets messed up?”
Her smile curls into a smirk and she turns from him.
“That was a fourth year summoning spell,” Hermione says, sounding a mix between impressed and jealous. “It wasn’t very sportsmanlike of him to use it.” She scowls and shakes her head so her bushy brown hair falls over her shoulders, nearly blending into her dark brown skin.
Fred tackles him in a hug. Ginny and Ron summon flowers to fall over him, and Harry remembers the conversation he had with George months ago when he caught him sneaking back into the common room, and he goes, “Oh! You’ve been seeing Cassius!”
be grounded until we died of old age,” Astoria says smartly.
When Minerva summons him to her office, Harry shuts the door behind him with a wave of his hand and picks up the biscuit tin. There are too many papers on her desk for him to manage to sit on it, so he settles for sitting sideways in the chair in front of her desk and balancing the biscuit tin on his stomach. “What’s up?”
“Sorry,” he says, but his grin is far too big for Draco to believe he means it.
“If you like,” Lupin says, surprised, “But it’s quite useful. I’m surprised you don’t want to keep it for yourself.”
Narcissa’s eyes widen, then her expressions smoothes out. It’s quick, a micro expression, but it makes something squirm uncomfortably in the bottom of his stomach.
Tonks smiles, so at least she doesn’t seem offended. “I’ll make you a deal. I’ll show you what I look like without my abilities if I can touch your scar.”
She sighs before patting Hagrid on the head. She winks at Harry before fading away, to wherever she goes when she’s not haunting the bathroom.
. How embarrassing for them. Draco can’t relate at all.
“He’s right,” Ron says, placing a hand against Harry’s back. “Come on. Let’s get going.”
next to each other. Had something happened last night when he hadn’t been looking? Probably.
Her mouth twists. “Because you’ll still choose them, won’t you? Living amongst the humans and protecting them even though you’re not one of them. All because they admire your ability to tame beasts. You mistake their praise for love.”
“I can keep a secret,” he says, and he looks less frightened and more contemplative. “So, you – you’re all friends? Really?”
“How does that even happen?” he asks, bewildered.
“You’re going to go save Severus, and I want to help,” Quinn insists.
He’s no sooner figured that out when everything shifts again. He’s in a hallway, and it’s even one he recognizes. “Why didn’t you join me?” his mother asks, and she’s so little, she has to be a first year. “We said we were going to be together!”
Firenze nods. Draco think he might be sad, but it’s hard to tell. He always keeps his face so carefully blank.
Harry waits several seconds before asking, “Was she trying to be cool for appearances’ sake, or is she just like that?”
“Well, maybe they should,” Millie says, speaking up for the first time. “Anyone who looks down at a dress made by elven hands better take a good hard look at the food they eat or their clean house. You need help, and Winky can do it. House elves once maintained whole forests, they’re capable of more than just mopping the floors.”
can smell the blood and decay in the air, and he’s only human. Hagrid, being half giant, probably smelled it a half mile back.
“Er, right,” he says, scanning the crowd for his boyfriend. Hopefully Draco will think to come grab him, but also possibly he thinks that Harry’s already inside and won’t bother.
On one hand, it’s a relief that they don’t blame him, that they’re not mad at him. On the other, it somehow makes him feel even worse for not being able to save Hagrid’s beast.
after,” he points out. “If I collapse with magical exhaustion, Poppy will kill me.”
He, Cedric, and Viktor get on their brooms. Fleur places her broom on the ground. “Up!” she commands, hand palm down, but as her broom rises she twists her hand up so her broom rises high above them.
“I got a summer job,” Harry volunteers.
Theophania snorts. “
“Expelliarmus!” he shouts, pointing his wand at Lupin’s back. The professor’s wand goes flying over Draco’s head into the hall, and he shuts the door after it. “What do you think you’re doing?”
to fail herbology, so he doesn’t argue.
“Okay,” Ron says, “what is it that you want Harry to do?”
. Draco’s going to murder him.
“That’s a long walk,” Cho says. “It’ll take us a long time when we’re not riding on the basilisk’s back.”
It’s beautiful.
It gets even better when Snape and his werewolf-centered curriculum leave the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, and Lupin returns. He even promises to teach Harry how to protect himself from Dementors after Christmas break, and the prospect of not being completely pathetic against his worst fears is enough to almost put him a cheerful mood.
People begin shifting awkwardly in their seats. The woman in pink demands, “What are you talking about?”
When they make it downstairs, it’s to find a hot breakfast already waiting for them. Either Kreacher is serious about this, or Winky makes a very good invisible helper. Either way, the food is delicious.
“Right,” he nods, leaning back in his chair. “Maybe there are people here who are inexperienced, who think war is something you can spectate rather than something you’re forced to be a part of. But I’m not one of them. I’m here because Voldemort seems hell bent on killing me, and I’d rather he didn’t do that, if that’s okay with you?”
“The magic is so delicate and old that no one wants to risk using diagnostic spells on it,” Ron guesses, and sighs when Pansy nods.
Harry shifts enough to glare at him.
. “You are never to do that again, do you understand? It’s an order. You may end a fight. You may not start one. I don’t care what they say about me – my reputation is my concern. Not yours.”
Pansy pulls a face. “No. Not a wedding dress. You can’t just transfigure something and expect it to be the same quality as something made organically. Magic can only do so much.” She the launches into a lecture about the limitations of transfiguration spells, which is way too in depth for a bunch of second years, but does provide Draco with the perfect opportunity to sneak away to the quidditch pitch.
!” Molly hisses. “Much too young to be involved in any of this!”
“You did wonderfully,” Lucius praises. “I’m fine. We called a private healer the next day, when it wouldn’t raise too much suspicion.” He runs a hand through Draco’s hair. “I didn’t notice before, but it’s gotten longer.”
That’s really cool, actually.
Oh thank Merlin, a real question. “General defense, really. It’s mostly just how not to get killed. But I’ve also just been teaching all the practical stuff that Umbridge leaves out of her lessons, so we’ve got the Owls pretty covered I think. And if the seventh years have any questions, we cover that.”
“Don’t worry, they only provide the backup vocals,” Draco says.
“How do you know – yes,” Kingsley answers. “But Sophia wouldn’t do that. Harry, I know you have a bit of a strained relationship with the Malfoy family, but she’s not like that.”
“Er,” he flushes. “Hello. Sorry about all this.”
Draco pauses. He’s known Pansy his whole life, and she doesn’t share the spotlight. Not this kind of spotlight, not on something this important, and not with a house elf. Draco’s pretty sure his mum and Zaira could have hand stitched the dress together for her and she wouldn’t have even mentioned them, which means Pansy has a much bigger agenda that just offering credit where credit is due.
“I have no idea what I’m doing,” Harry says. “Like, literally none.”
. He was acting differently, and his face was completely blank. It was him, but it wasn’t
Draco almost looks impressed, and it doesn’t matter that Harry only half-believes what he’s saying. He knows he’s angry enough now to not care about the backlash he’ll get later, and that’s all that matters.
He pretends to be surprised and irritated when Quinn tells him about the defense group that Harry is leading, and the irritation at least isn’t entirely feigned. Thanks to how he spent his summer, he knows that there are some kids whose families are so entwined in Voldemort’s mess that he’s legitimately worried about teaching them to fight, because they just might end up on the other side.

Harry shares a quick glance with Ron and Ginny. From the look on their faces, this isn’t new. The sounds of their upset mother must have attracted Fred and George’s attention, because they’ve wandered over to stand behind their father.
He slips into their classroom, and locks the door behind him. Harry’s whole face lights up when he sees him, and he’d be lying if he said that didn’t make him feel just a little warmer. He’s still wearing that gorgeous glittering green robe and dark blue suit. “Draco! Cedric told me–”
“Mon amour,” she says, fluttering her eyelashes, “there is no cheating in war. Only survival.”
“What do you need help with?” He turns to see Millie coming out from the door that leads to the girls’ dorms. She still has some eyeliner smudged on her face and her hair is in an approximation of a ponytail. She’s in leggings and an oversized bright yellow crochet sweater that Pansy made for her by hand for her last birthday. There is, of course, a muggle book in her hands, although these days she doesn’t bother to charm the cover to hide that. “I’m surprised you guys are up this early.”
“Yes, he is,” he says, “because we’re going to tell him to.”
. Quinn has gone completely off book in potions, introducing several clever concepts that Draco feels like an idiot for not thinking of himself. His only solace is that Hermione is equally frustrated with herself, so at least he’s not alone.
Once quidditch season is over, final exams smack them all in the face. Draco and Hermione become snappish and exhausted, although Draco refuses to show he’s trying as hard as he is, which limits him. Hermione doesn’t have an aloof and effortless reputation to maintain, so she constantly has her head buried in a book or is surrounded by notes.
Blaise makes a face. “No thanks, my family lost a lot of money in the last one. We’ll make a replica with a similar magical signature, it’s fine, how hard can it be?” No one answers him and he rolls his eyes. “Draco, can you handle forging the sword?”
“Are you sure?” he asks, because he’s absolutely all for this, but they’ve never done this before.
They all groan, but no one disagrees, and a whole new round of research begins.
There’s a nudge against the back of his chair, and then Ron’s leaning forward so he can whisper to both him and Hermione. “Normally Cedric’s mum would be giving him away, but since she can’t, Tonks is a good substitute. Any female relative would have been traditional, but it’s a good look to the older families that his soulmate is giving him away.”
“Wow, you’re so handsome.”
“Hold on,” Ron says suspiciously, “is this what Percy’s been working on?”
“We cannot take premade clothes for our own,” Winky clarifies. “We must be making our own, without the aid of magic. Most elves is not good at sewing. I is making clothes for them.”
“Why are you showing us this?” Millie asks. “Why now, when you’ve been hiding it all year, when the school year is almost over? What’s happening?”
for an undefined period of time.
McGonagall stares at them for a long, uncomfortable moment. Most people would fold under that, but Ron and Hermione have gotten angrier stares for worse things. Nothing’s even on fire.
He ducks his head and gets back to the mopping. “Anytime.”
“Same,” Harry says, then pats Remus on the back. “I’ll make you nice soothing cup of chai, how does that sound?”
Harry rubs the back of his neck. “Sorry, I know. I just wasn’t ready to deal with him.”
“Unless that wasn’t the point. Unless it was more for form than function,” he points out.
Blaise walks through, his head buried in a book. “Hi Harry.”
No one in the classroom is working anymore. They’d have to be blind not to see Nicolas flirting with Dumbledore at mealtimes, but none of them are going to say anything about it. It’s hilarious, and Nicolas is over six hundred years old and Dumbledore is over a hundred, which means they’re well over the age when they can make their own choices. There is, however, a rather large betting pool about what the exact nature of their relationship is. But this seems like a rather unsportsmanlike way to get the answer.
He slowly puts the book in Dobby’s arms and he winks at them before disappearing with another crack.
“That bloody snake,” Ron snarls, “Malfoy is involved, I knew it! He probably took her down there himself. Probably had a big laugh about it, pretending he was innocent to everyone, and then dragging my little sister down there to be murdered. I’m going to wring his skinny neck, the disgusting, arrogant
“Yup,” Draco says, undoing Harry’s pants and sliding them down as he drops to his knees. All of Harry’s thoughts screech to a halt, and he’s pretty sure his brain dribbles out of his ears.
“What rumors? We’re in it,” George says.
“Why do you think I want him to do anything at all?” he asks.
He drags himself to the showers in the locker room rather than going back to the dorms because he can feels pools of sweat going tacky on his skin and he wants a proper shower now
He’d meant to study more back at Hogwarts, but it had ended up taking a backseat to not dying in the Triwzard Tournament. So now he spends a couple hours a day studying with Remus or Sirius, and Tamil only mealtimes. Which is for the best, really, because he’s falling behind compared to his friends, which just makes him feel embarrassed and prickly, since it’s supposed to be
upset that Lupin wears shabby robes. He tries to get Draco to tell him what’s really going on, but he just changes the subject.
Wait.
“What party?” he asks, confused. They all freeze.
Lost. A Mother, lost in the afterlife. So lost that three experienced and powerful Mothers hadn’t been able to find him, one of their own kind.
She then walks out before any of them can respond, and then they hurry to follow her out onto the dance floor.
“No,” he says crossly, then sighs. “Yeah, okay.”
Draco snorts, gives a nod to Flitwick, and leaves the classroom without another word. Pansy and Blaise sigh before following him.
“Enough chit chat!” he barks, “Imperio!” Pansy goes completely still and her eyes go glassy. They’re not laughing anymore. “Jump up and down.”
He floos over to Harry’s, and the sitting area is a sea of Weasley red that greets him with varying levels of enthusiasm, most of them still in the process of getting ready, tying bowties and putting on earrings. Sirius is almost comically easy to spot with his dark hair. “Draco,” he greats warmly, clapping him on the back, “never thought I’d see a Malfoy in Gryffindor colors. Are you sure you don’t want to ride in the carriages with us?”
Well, that’s disappointing, but. “I’ve already been published once in Charms Review and I’ve got two more articles set to be out before I graduate,” he admits. “I’ll probably end up using the concepts here in something else – I got most of the idea for this from learning how to contain a patronus charm – but I already have clear path to a charms career if that’s what I want, and you know better than me how my accounts are doing. That isn’t what this is about. I have so many choices in my life and I want others to have choices too. I
Harry had sent Draco away before reporting the attacks, certain that everyone would think he was the heir. Draco had tried pointing out that he didn’t care, but Harry had made him leave anyway.
He’s itching to see Harry, and to hear the details of what, exactly, happened after he passed out like a moron.
“I thought Italy’s apparation age was seventeen too,” Harry pipes up. “I definitely remember that coming up when we met up for my trial last summer.”
Far from the merpeople city, the same couple dozen merpeople with spears are fighting alongside the giant squid, trying to keep Fleur at bay. The merman who had spoken to him is there too, but hanging back from the fighting, watching it with a critical eye. He looks uninterested, but his hands are clenched into fists. A mermaid jabs forward, nearly gutting Fleur, and the merman calls out, “Cause her no harm! Only try and disarm!”
Sirius blinks.
Wood glares, but no one else seems bothered. “Why are we meeting in here to begin with?” Alicia asks. “Shouldn’t we be practicing, not gossiping?”
“Maybe you’re not the only who doesn’t want to be alone,” Draco says, still with the strain he’s trying to hide around his eyes, and Harry can’t help the smile tugging at his lips.
Good.
“What is it?” Ron asks.
Which Harry doesn’t feel like is actually an issue, and he’s not sure why they’re arguing about it.
, of course. But it’s good to learn. And it’s at least less boring than occlumency lessons.”
with me?”
Abigail slithers from his shoulders onto the table, curling in front of him so she can look at him while she speaks. “
Draco’s out of his seat immediately, and he makes a bee line for the Beauxbaton students. Within moments, he has a small crowd clustered around him, and is he … it’s too far away to hear properly, but Harry’s almost certain …
“Because you’re doing that by hand instead of by wand,” he says, “I know this place employs house elves.”
The common room door shuts behind them, but not in time to prevent them from hearing Cormac say, “Whatever you see those two idiots doing? Don’t.”
Harry has been in a lot of surreal situations in his life, but he thinks that this might be the top of the list.
churning in his stomach that he can’t help, and unfortunately through his exposure to Gryffindors there’s only one way he knows to make it go away.
“He didn’t,” Sirius says, “His cousin was a year older, so he moved into his dorm in the middle of third year because he was sick of all of us, and he was Head Boy our last year, so he had his own room. We never pranked
, mate. We have to get up before sunrise tomorrow!”
Draco is
Sirius’s mouth drops open. Remus breathes, “Oh shit.”
Fleur and Saida have pulled Clarence into an argument of about a professor back at their school, and are in now the middle of conversation in rapid fire French that Draco can follow, but Quinn looks like ze’s about to fall asleep.
“George! George, over here!” Everyone turns. Cassius, the unofficial Slytherin quidditch captain, is running towards them.
“Carry me back when I’m done if I can’t go myself,” Harry says, and he can’t feel sweat underwater, but his whole body feels too hot, like he’s boiling from the inside.
” he screams, and realizes when only Tom reacts that he hadn’t said it in English.
“Did you know that Millie is a half-blood?”
“Nah,” Harry says, then goes back to kissing him.
“For the whole building, actually,” he says, slowly turning red. “I just negotiated a price. It’s not like it’s in great shape, and Amelia’s giving me substantial raise, plus a bonus that would cover the down payment. We can afford it.”
“I’d rather you didn’t,” he says before he can think better of it, and his whole face turns red. “I mean–”
“Just brilliant,” Draco groans, and Harry doesn’t try and stop the smile that steals across his face since Ginny can’t see it. “Say your goodbyes so I can get rid of them.”
“Angelina!” Katie scolds, even though she’s angry too. “Don’t admit to murder in front of so many witnesses.”
Dobby kicks his feet against the ground, and Draco thinks of how many times his father ordered Dobby to put his hands in the oven. He could never do that to Winky. But at the same time, Dobby was a disloyal elf. He didn’t listen, he kept secrets, he went behind their backs. Lucius couldn’t use magic against him, and freeing him for disloyalty would be as good as killing him, and they couldn’t just let him continue to betray them unpunished. But hurting him was wrong. But he doesn’t know what they should do instead, what anyone should do instead. House elves need magic to survive, and wizards and witches are the only reliable source of that magic left. They can’t just hand over pieces of themselves and drain themselves dry for creatures that don’t even like them, that could hurt them and leave the wizards no way to defend themselves.
Snape finally starts acting like an actual teacher and puts a stop to it, and sends Goyle to the hospital wing. But he doesn’t send Hermione. Her teeth are growing past her chin now, and if someone doesn’t do something they won’t stop. Draco knows the counter hex, but he can’t use it, obviously. The worst part is he knows Snape knows it too, but if he hadn’t bothered to cast it on Goyle he’s definitely not going to cast it on Granger.
“They have a death wish,” Blaise says, “it’s the only explanation.” No one disagrees.
That’s how Draco end up in the forbidden forest in the middle of the night, petting a wild wyvern named Payne.
Everyone is silent.
“YOU’RE A PARSELMOUTH!” he shouts, despairing not for the first time that his soulmate is this much of moron. “SPEAK TO THE BLOODY SNAKE!”
He’s going to go to the great hall and sigh very loudly until Millie asks him what’s wrong or Daphne threatens to suffocate him with his own mashed potatoes, whatever happens first.
“Okay,” he says warily.
Ron scrunches up his nose, starting in on his toast. “Not really. I mean – it’s a really prestigious position. Malfoy has been on the board since before his son was born. There’s some sort of stipend that members get, but most of them donate it back to the school. The Malfoys are old money, so his dad does a lot of stuff, like half their money is still tied up in businesses back in France. I think if you listed off his all his titles it’d be as long as Dumbledore’s.”
“Neville’s better at it than I am,” Blaise says easily, handing him the sword.
Harry is so surprised that he stops moving for a moment, and then has to force his tired limbs to move even faster to catch up. “You’re my
Pansy and Blaise are furious that everything happened without them, and make Draco recount every detail, sometimes more than once because of how ridiculous it all sounds.
No one reacts, but Voldemort turns his head to look right at him. “Ah, Potter. Come for a little visit?”
Indignation wells up inside him. “Oh, so this is
He drops the letter and is running to the defense classroom before he can think better of it, bursting inside and shouting, “What are you doing?”
“Don’t ask questions you don’t want to know the answers to,” he says. If it were just Filius he’d just admit the obvious, which is that he’s experimenting with the properties of silver using a forge he’s smuggled onto school grounds, but that’s because Filius isn’t a snitch. He can’t trust the rest of them. Up until recently, Snape was a professional snitch, after all. “So are you going to answer my question or not?”
Harry looks at Lupin, betrayed, and the man has seemingly moved on from Draco threatening to murder him. He shrugs, “Flitwick says he’s the best charms student he’s seen in years. Maybe he can help.”
“And if it’s alive?” Neville asks wearily. “I don’t want to get eaten.”
, but the idea had been for the shrieking shack to be used not just by them this year and the next, but by students after them too. Once Harry leaves, access to the chamber is going to once more be controlled by Theophania. She leaves the larger pipes accessible to them now for RA meetings, but she can close those off just as easily when she decides she no longer wants students sneaking in to the chamber.
“You’re really going to approve that heavy of a schedule?” Poppy asks dubiously. “When Cassius wanted to do extra physical training with the quidditch team, you made me help design it and sign off on it. When he wanted to do more himself, you made him get health checks every month on the threat of taking away his future captaincy.”
“That is very strange,” Hermione says, frowning. “I didn’t think anything could get past your wards.”
He looks up at them, blinking. “What? Oh. I, uh,” he flushes and rubs the back of his head, glancing at Harry and then looking away. “I’m the new quidditch captain.”

Poppy shakes her head, not taking the bait. “No. You have to care. You have to care about everyone, even people you dislike, and you have to care so much that if feels like it’s killing you, you have to care and that care has to hurt, until the only thing that hurts worse than caring is not caring. To be good at this, you have to let it hurt you.”
Considering everything going on, Draco almost skips his lunch meeting, but if Asim is taking the time to actually use his lunch break to meet Draco, then he can’t do that.
If anyone was looking at them, but couldn’t hear them, they would think Draco was taunting them.
Draco wonders if this would all make sense if he wasn’t so tired, but he’s pretty sure it wouldn’t, actually.
He pauses, then says, “Everyone’s gone but Chief and I. You don’t need to worry.”
He’s so, so thankful Blaise left already, because tears spill down his cheeks before he can stop them. He wants to run home, wants to throw himself at both his parents, but he
“I’m not dead,” he winces as Blaise carefully eases his arm through the sleeve, then sets it back in the sling. “But Pomfrey said it would take a couple weeks to heal completely.”
Nanaia takes out both of their recorders, handing him his and then tapping her chin with her own. “I imagine the wards are programmed to reset either when the dead both awaken and go back to sleep, since that would mean either they’ve been joined by whoever was killed by the poison, or they killed whoever touched the water. So we have to wake them up and then put them to sleep to get out of here.”
“Isn’t it obvious, dear nephew of mine?” she sneers. “Only a necromancer can get that book. Plenty have tried and failed. If Potter succeeds, I’m going to need it.”
There’s a moment of complete silence.
Prongs be bigger? Patronuses are supposed to be the size of the animals they imitate, but he doesn’t see why they have to be. They’re made of magic and happiness, and that doesn’t have a size limit.
“Right,” Harry says, because ze seems to be waiting for some sort of response.
Draco’s dad is going to kill him.
So he can’t summon help. He has to work with what and who he has. But the only people here are Death Eaters and the dead.
“Auror it is,” he says, and feels an edge of satisfaction when Umbridge presses her lips together. “Maybe even the Minister of Magic, clearly anyone can do the job.”
“You will not,” Ron says haughtily, “What kind friends would we be if you made you set up your own birthday celebration? That’s barbaric.”
The book doesn’t move for a moment then the pages slowly turn, as if Harry’s confused it. But his face brightens when he looks over the page and then he places his wand flat on his palm to cast, “Invenies ossa!”
Harry was helping Hermione clear up the living area when there was a crack of Apparition in the yard and Harry raced outside to find Draco standing in the yard with a bloody lip and a furious expression.
Harry woke up panting, the sweat drenching him already chilling his skin. He huddles into his blankets, pulling the grey sweater from under his pillow and pressing it to his face. The smell of Draco was long gone, but the feel of his expensive cashmere anchored Harry to the present instead of his haunting dream. Harry shuddered with sobs, the bed shaking around him with the force of his grief.
He was vaguely aware of Hermione shouting and red light flying around him. Draco thought dying was very dramatic, as he felt his stomach drop and his vision blur. Draco opened his eyes an infinite amount of time later to a cool white room, extremely dim and with various whisperings. Draco breathed in, gasping a little at the pain in his chest. It seemed very unfair that he had to take the injury with him to the afterlife, but supposed he had no reason to expect he wouldn't take the pain on. The whispering got louder, and he realised his mother was whispering to someone, "I think this tea is about the worst thing I've ever had, do they just pour the Bubotuber pus in directly or do you think they mix it with Goblin piss?" Draco huffed a laugh, confused. Why was his mother whispering in the afterlife? Fear gripped his heart, had Nott killed her too?
Harry slips out of the bed, horrified.
Harry looked over at Hermione, she was casting diagnostic charms over the Marauder's Map. Hermione was trying to replicate the spell work for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. She and Kingsley had had an idea for Aurors to use something similar on building blueprints when they were conducting raids. If she could make it work, it would reduce casualties in the Auror Department considerably. Hermione dropped her wand, exclaiming, "Harry!" He moved to look over her shoulder, Draco Malfoy was in a small classroom, surrounded by younger students from Slytherin. Harry frowned, puzzled, Draco had barely interacted with anyone younger from his house since they had come back. Ron leapt out of his armchair and grabbed the map, gesturing to Neville while Hermione picked up her wand and followed them out of the Common Room. Harry hurried along beside Hermione, he felt nervous about what they might find.
"I think I don't need the full year," Harry tugged Draco closer, "But I do need somewhere to live, because I've given Grimmauld to Andromeda."
"At least he came back?" Hermione's words drew Harry and Molly to both give her a look of disdain before returning to the warmth of the house.
"Well, he wrote a lovely apology and asked that I consider letting him join us as otherwise Andromeda was likely to feel guilty and he didn't want her to only have him for company," Molly fussed over her cake batter, "Such a polite young man, terribly sad about his mother."
"Draco, Narcissa, Andromeda and Teddy are going to be staying at Grimmauld Place with me. I'd like you to come over whenever you like. You're my family, too." Hermione started again at Harry's
" Hermione tried to dodge the curse, not having much room with the wall right beside her. She heard Nott laugh and realised she'd not been hit. "Looks like Draco caught the hero bug, lucky Mudblood!" Hermione dropped to her knees, Draco had been slashed across his torso when he'd jumped in front of her. "No, shit, Draco, why?!" Hermione vaguely remembered a first aid course from summer of Third Year. She pushed against his bleeding chest and tried to hold the wound together. Nott was laughing maniacally and raised his wand again.
I am talking about is myself and my boyfriend, Ron.
Harry said a quiet goodbye to Kingsley, before reaching for Narcissa, taking her hand and squeezing it tightly. "I'm sorry about your husband-" She cut across him immediately, "Mr. Potter, I am sad for what has occurred, I am not grieving a man who did not love me enough to protect me from a maniac or keep our son from harms way." Harry looked to Draco for his response to her uncaring statement, but he looked unbothered and distant. Harry's heart ached, here were two people who needed a family's love as much as he did. He knew they had no one. Harry had never had a kinship with a Malfoy before, but felt it acutely as he stared at the elegant hand resting in his.
"Muggle warfare is pure violence," Dean nodded in agreement, "Except for the chemical attacks."
"His mum?" Harry looked up from the book he'd been staring at, unseeing, for an hour.
"But - I love you? I would never l-leave you," Harry stammered, "Was it too much? Me not knowing you?"
"What the actual fuck, Potter!" Pansy is livid.
"I... It's just him for me." Harry didn't know what else to say.
Harry grinned back at her, "I know, Draco forced me to take a sleeping draught last night because I would not shut up about it and just sleep."
"Charge to 200 joules," Healer Gurjeet prompted.
"So, you're stuck with me now," Harry said quietly as he took a seat next to Malfoy.
"Hermione, can you take him? Pansy and I will clean up here," Luna's voice is calm, considering.
The group of girls who had returned was even smaller, only Hermione, Pansy, Padma and Parvati had returned. He knew that others who had survived had either applied to sit their N.E.W.Ts without the full Seventh Year or changed schools. Lavender had barely survived Greyback's attack, she was living in Hogsmeade and doing her studies independently. The Patil sisters spent every weekend with Lavender, Justin and Blaise walked them to the village every Friday afternoon.
Harry thought the fare served by the St. Mungo's cafeteria was pitiful (even compared to the Ministry of Magic), so he ducked out to a Muggle coffee shop down the road. He returned with several cups of tea and coffee and an array of pastries. Draco didn't accept any food, but he did drink a large cup of black coffee. The three of them watched the door for another agonising few hours before an exhausted and very apologetic witch came out and took them to a private room to confirm that Astoria would not be able to be saved.
"Draco and Narcissa Malfoy should not be taken into custody, they were merely family members of a Death Eater, one who, I will remind you, had no wand for the better part of the last year. Lucius and Narcissa didn't take part in the battle, and Draco was a scared student, trying to keep himself alive." Harry was staring at Hermione with a look of wonder on his face, but his astonishment was soon turned to Ron, "'Mione is right. Mrs. Malfoy didn't do anything, she just married the wrong kind of bloke, and Malfoy was just a dumb kid doing what his dad said to." Hermione felt pride welling in her chest at the mature statement Ron had made - even with his dig at Draco.
"You were stunning, Vikki," Draco assures her.
"Finally, you're here. Right, all of us under the influence have had a Sobering Potion and we are ready to accept orders!" Ron was swinging around a large water bottle and saluting Harry when he stood up to brush the ash off his jeans.
Ron wrapped an arm around her shoulders, subtly weighting her wand arm to lower. "Harry, mate, he needs to rest. And it would be best if he could rest without fighting around him, yeah?" Harry looked desperately to Andy and Hermione's mum for support. Narcissa was the one who spoke up, turning to face Harry with Teddy. "Harry, I know it was an accident, but I admit, I'm very upset with you." Harry hung his head, Hermione felt the smallest part of her anger ebb. She knew that Harry regarded the Malfoys and Andy has his family now too. It would hurt him to disappoint them. "Cissa, I'm so- I- I can't tell you how sorry I am, I never meant for him-" Tears were quietly dripping off Harry's chin, he couldn't speak further. Narcissa moved to kiss Harry on his temple. "Harry, you're still a part of our family. It hurts more because of that. Why don't you take Teddy and introduce him to some of your friends, I'm sure they'd be delighted to see him. Bring him back in an hour or so." Harry accepted his godson and nodded, sniffling. She watched Harry leave with a small frown on her face.
"Don't go around killing yourself out of some kind of cowardice, I don't think Molly could handle it," Draco snaps.
Later, Harry found him again, sitting as far from the fire as possible.
"I will kill you, leave now or I'll do it, our friendship has nothing left for you to salvage," Ginny spits, her eyes narrowed with hate.
"Tomorrow, after everyone has given out the presents you will give Draco this, somewhere private." Narcissa handed Harry a small, elaborately carved wooden box.
Molly and Arthur stood tall in front of Draco, he straightened and regarded them with a fear on his face that Hermione could understand. Molly had killed Bellatrix Lestrange and was worthy of Draco's fearful respect. Arthur held out a hand and told him stiffly that they accept his apology. George stepped up and took Teddy from Molly's arms, whispering to the baby about teaching him pranks and tricks. Hermione felt grief run cold through her, George had lost half his heart to the War and was barely acknowledging Malfoy.
"I promise Ted, as soon as Harry is better, we'll take you to Disneyland," Draco held up his pinky to the child.
"Harry, please leave," George steps up behind Ginny, wrapping his sister in his arms.

"Ow, fuck. Oh, er, bit the spoon." Harry flushed under Draco's amused scrutiny and made himself busy polishing off his dessert.
Harry thrust out his hand, "Hi, I'm Harry Potter. It's nice to meet you."
"Did you really like the dress?" Victoire whispers to her mother and Draco.
"Just go, please," Draco commanded, "I have two caesarians booked this afternoon. I don't have time for this."
"These are colour coded, green to begin, moving onto orange and then black," Luna instructed. "We're going to start with the green ones."
Harry stared at the picture of who he assumed was Teddy sitting happily in Hermione's lap on the coffee table. A little boy clutching a stuffed dragon looks up at Hermione in wonder and his hair changes to match her mass of tight curls.
"We're not ready, for forgiveness," Hermione told him. Harry nodded in response, hanging his head. "We will be doing anything Luna asks of us to help your recovery though."
Luna stood up and wandered over to Ron's bed, empty as Hermione and Ron had gone to look at flats in London for the day. She started conjuring garlands of flowers from Ron's canopy, humming to herself. Pansy shuffled until she was sitting against the headboard beside Harry. "Alright, next question. What do you prefer, A - blondes. B - brunettes. C - shaved head. D - gingers." Harry froze. If he answered D, Draco might think he missed Ginny or was lusting after one of the Weasleys. If he chose one of the other options, Draco might think he had his eye on some other guy and try to find out who it was. Harry hummed, buying time. "I s'pose blondes." Harry saw Draco's head turn minutely towards Pansy, before focusing back on his book. He could see Draco's ear and cheek were pink. Harry frowned, what was that reaction for?
"So, really, what now?" Harry turns to Draco at his quiet words.
Harry keened at the thought of Draco inside of him, Ginny had taught him that he had a rather sensitive prostate and he couldn't imagine wanting to top and miss the opportunity for that stimulation. Draco pressed a few more kisses into the base of Harry's throat before clearing his own.
"She's the most perfect of perfect," Harry confirms.
"My, you do get around. What is it this time - herpes, syphilis?" An angry looking matron greets him as he arrives in the Emergency Room.
"Babe, where you been?" 'Tony' spoke from the kitchen steps, "Swear to Salazar, if you been with that whore Jamie again!"
Six Curse-Breakers, led by Bill Weasley, cast large detection spells over the remaining soil, but gave Harry a thumbs up after a few minutes.
"Because of the bomb," Seamus still looked pale, he and Dean were inseperable since the incident. They were sitting together, hands clasped tightly.
Molly swooped him into a crushing hug, "I'll be by with dinner later, something healthy but comforting."
"You looked remarkably well suited to the dress. Ginevra... She made it okay for me to be sad, to be angry, to rage at the misfortune and unfairness of it all." Draco looked rather fond for a moment before his smile dropped, "We all lost a remarkably bright light in her. The world is a little poorer for her not being in it."
Harry mumbled a greeting.
Harry felt a lump in his throat, "Yeah, I miss him too."
"Clear the area, shock!"
Harry rolled off his couch and landed on the floor with a 'whump'. "I'm 'wake, 'Mione. What's going on?"
Harry shot a Breath Freshening Charm at himself and slumped into the chair, "I-I'm a monster. Luna I - I raped Ginny!"
Narcissa gave him a stern look for interrupting so rudely before continuing, "I told him that you would never look at another woman after Ginevra. He believes your interest in men is theoretical because you never date."
"Er, what?" Harry looked around and found Molly being tended to by a concerned Hermione and an amused Draco.
Harry has no idea what to do further, so he does the only thing he can think of and Apparates away to St. Mungo's.
Harry nodded, he'd always suspected Theo had a crush on him. He avoided hanging out with him and Draco because of it. Draco had told him he was crazy and that Theo was just a bit shy.
"It's a Muggle protocol, it's called defibrillation," Healer Gurjeet pointed to the interesting looking metal contraption beside her, "We, er, shock Harry into waking up."
Hermione saw the flinch in Draco's face as the matriarch reached out, before he stiffened and offered her the baby to hold. She took the bundle before staring back at him and asked, "Lucius?" "Dead." "Your mother?" "With Aunt Andromeda." "You?" "I'm not Marked, so we're free to go, but..." Draco had trailed off, Hermione watched Harry take his hand and squeeze -
Harry sat up and checked his watch, the battered one the Weasley family had given him for his seventeenth. He still had twenty minutes to go before he had to Floo to his Healer's office. Harry dragged himself off the floor and stomped upstairs to get dressed, forgoing a shower for some cleaning charms and a gallon of coffee.
A small Asian witch answered with a, "Who the fuck are you?"
"Honestly, you'd think they were women," Hermione scoffs and pats Ron on the shoulder.
"Well, I wasn't. Until the howler..." Harry leaned in to mould his lips to Draco's.
"How?" Harry's dry lip chose that moment to crack, sending a stream of crimson down his chin.
, but the rest of the family just murmured goodbyes and see you laters. The Weasleys all moved towards the Entry Hall, ready for departure. Ginny caught Harry's eye and jerked her head to the right. Harry took the hint and handed Draco back his cousin, "Go back to your mum and Andromeda, I'll be there in a moment." Draco wandered away, a curious look on his face that Hermione wasn't sure she interpreted correctly.
"I don't know, my son taking you back for the second time and then you fucking one of his friends in your bed so he would discover you deliberately was pretty atrocious," Narcissa replied, "He rightfully was furious with you and you then put him in the hospital."
"I'm sorry I blamed you," Harry muttered, "It's just..."
"Er - I'm looking for Hermione and Ron? They live here," Harry demanded.
Draco gave Harry a complicated look, "Yes, well. That was after the second time I caught you with another man in our bed and told you to go to hell."
"You did what you could, you couldn't protect him any more than you tried to," Andromeda squeezed Draco's hand, before pressing her other hand to Harry's covered leg, "He will come back to us. Teddy, we should go."
"What do I do? How do I go from here?" Harry was shell shocked.
"Burn it down?" Ron winced, "I'm sorry, bad joke."
George jumped up abruptly, dropping Pansy to the floor, "Sweet Morgana's nipples, Fred, we bloody got 'em! We got the date!" Pansy grumbled as she stood up and congratulated him on his win before shoving him back into the chair and wrapping herself in his arms again. Ron groaned and then laughed, "Happy birthday George, and I suppose next year we'll be wishing Harry and Draco a happy anniversary too." George's eyes sparkled as he grinned back, "I don't mind sharing the day, and I don't think Fred would have either."
"I can't stand having flesh in my mouth," Harry winced, "I still eat eggs and cheese okay, but I can't handle anything else."
mental health," Luna wrote down some notes on her parchment.
"I doubt it, you love Molly's biscuits, you won't give up your fix because I'm a little messy," Harry laughed.
Hermione's head snapped up at Harry's shouted declaration, she knew it meant he was quickly losing control of his temper - and therefore his magic. She could feel it in the air, thicker than the dust still rising from the ruined castle. Harry had slipped away from them during the armistice, but she had suspected that he'd go to see Dumbledore's portrait for guidance. Hermione and Ron had entered the office too late to catch up with Harry, seeing the glowing Pensieve, Hermione had drawn her own conclusions and pushed her head into the liquid.
Draco smiled at the thought of Jean, he had gone with Hermione to Australia. Harry and Ron had decided leaving George alone a month after Fred's funeral was too much for them. He and Hermione had come back firm friends, successfully restoring her parents memories with her Charms expertise and his Potion skills. They had also enjoyed the break in Australia, a chance to get to know each other and heal the wounds of the past. Draco had learned so much about Muggles in the time he'd been there and he missed the casual setting of Jean and Roger's beach house. He had also kissed a very cute Australian boy with messy brown hair and bright blue eyes and realised he was gay. No one in the family had said anything negative about it when he got back and told them. Charlie was gay and in a relationship with a very handsome Argentinian man from the dragon reserve, Matias.
Draco watched as Harry stared down at his grimy clothes, miserably pulling his filthy sweater away from his chest. Draco realised that Harry mustn't have been able to travel with much, before wandering into the room without his trunk. Draco started opening the drawers to find clean clothing in warm colours. "I think Kreacher must have bought you some new things Harry-" Draco whipped around to see Harry crumple into tears on his knees, heaving huge sobs. "Harry!" Draco kneeled before the boy, deciding in that moment that Harry looked tired, miserable and extremely in need of some comfort. "C'mon Potter, I've got you," pulling the smaller boy up by his arms and half dragging him into the bathroom.
"Potter loves me, I loathe him," Malfoy sneered.
and he was a parched man in the desert.
Harry smiled at him and turned to Luna, planting a messy kiss on her cheek. Luna brightened immediately, "Oh, thank you Draco. I'm glad you're not upset at me." Draco shared an ambivalent look with Harry, Luna was a mysterious force to be reckoned with.
"Draco swore me to secrecy when I noticed how he looked at you. You were still grieving and it was only just past the first anniversary of Ginevra's death. He held out hope that you would come to care for him too but when the Prophet started talking about your relationship with your assistant at the foundation-"
"You faced Dementors again at fifteen and then were put on trial for saving yourself from them," Draco looked at Harry with sadness, "Then all of you had to face my father and his shitty friends at the Ministry."
Harry sighed and rested his head on Draco's shoulder, wrapping his arms around Draco's left arm. He ran a finger over one of the scars closest to Draco's wrist. "Have I said that I am sorry yet today?" Draco rolled onto his side, pulling Harry closer with his right arm. Harry felt a cool hand slip under his jumper.
Hermione's arm though - I don't think I'll be able to get the image of that dangling from the breakfast table out of my head ever again. Definitely going to have to talk to Parvati or Padma about vegetarianism. They're Indian too, so it's probably something I should have known about anyway. Fuck, I feel dizzy. I just have to get to our room, I can shower and lay down. God, I feel weak...
Hermione sat back down next to Draco, taking his hand in hers. "Hermione, I appreciate your protectiveness of my son, but I think you're punishing Harry a little too much," Narcissa placed a hand on her shoulder. Hermione sighed, looking at Draco's bruised cheek. "Draco was so awful when we were younger. But we spent three weeks struggling to get my parents memories back together, just us. He's the reason Mum is sitting with me right now. I just... He was scared and he couldn't see. Draco would never turn his wand on Harry knowingly. I'm so angry at Harry for not recognising that Draco was just trying to cast a
Draco's throat felt swollen as he fought back tears, he moved his hand to squeeze Ron's shoulder, "He'll be up there with you. There's no one he'd allow to take that place."
"We shouldn't have been used to it by then either," Ron's hoarse words joined in, "We shouldn't have had to go after Quirrell at eleven. We shouldn't have had to deal with a basilisk at twelve."
Draco nodded, "Healer said you would hear most of what was being said, even if your brain didn't know how to place it in context."
James' bellow of pain startled Minty who burst into loud tears. The books began to shake in their shelves as Minty's upset took the form of wild magic.
"Not likely," Bill snorts, "She's been hounding Fleur and Hermione for grandchildren this week."
"But I don't want to, I don't want to live without him," Harry's voice was quiet.
"Camomile, lavender, mallow-sweet and honey," Winky recited.
"Dementors at thirteen," Neville added.
"We agreed on four, you want more? Plus we adopted Teddy last month, officially," Draco shakes his head but he's smiling.
"When was the last time you slept more than a few hours?" Luna asked.
"Oh, er. We wanted to let you have the house to yourself tonight. Um, because you won't see, y'know, her tomorrow." Harry felt his breath shorten at the idea of Draco alone with Celia.
₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪
"You're not," Harry smiled, "Bill is the same."
"It's musty in here, let's get these curtains open," Molly flung her wand at the curtains, allowing daylight to shine in on Harry's slumped form.
"Ready," Marcie replied.
"I only lost my memories - how could I become so - so evil?" Harry stammers.
Harry thought back to the Fiendfyre, the screams of Crabbe as it burnt him to death, "Yeah, I reckon I can understand that."
"But... I'd only just gotten out of the hospital..." Harry bit his lip and waited for the response.
"You cannot blame yourself, you couldn't know," Narcissa seemed more sincere.
wand and promptly pulled it out of his sleeve and handed it to him. He inclined his head towards Harry in a bow as he accepted it, his eyes were tightly shut and his mouth a thin, trembling grimace.
"Parvati and I have special meals that the elves make," Padma nodded at Harry, "You can ask them to make you the same and see if it helps? There's seven students here who are also vegetarian for religious reasons."
"Andy, I-" Harry is interrupted by Andromeda's right hook to his nose.
"Even more perfect than me, your first-born son?" James is giving them an arch look.
Draco turned to Harry, with an innocent expression on his face. "Now... I believe you said something about getting married?"
tell you." Harry was close enough now he could feel Draco's breath on his cheek.
Andromeda cleared her throat and reminded everyone that it was indeed, very late, and perhaps they should head home and let Draco rest. Hermione followed Ron out the door, glancing back at Draco and Harry as she left, already in their own bubble again, and smiled.
Astoria Malfoy died at 8:47PM on the 9th of January, 2019. Harry vividly remembered the day a haunted looking Narcissa Malfoy appeared in his Floo at the Ministry, begging Harry to take Scorpius home with him to Albus and keep him busy. Albus had mentioned that Scorpius hadn't come over for Boxing Day because he was so anxious to spend time with his mother, halfway through a very difficult second pregnancy. Harry had barely affirmed they would take him when the boy tumbled into his arms through the Floo.
Draco turned to Harry who quickly shot out his stag Patronus and sent it soaring past the large circle of witches and wizards who surrounded the Manor, signalling the beginning.
Harry boggles, George looks older than the last time he saw him and his hair is three inches longer. "George - what?"
"Teddy, love, be careful," Andromeda was mindful of the white bandage swathing Harry's side.
Ouch, I'm on the ground. My shoulder fucking hurts. Where's my wand? Where's Ron? I can't see Hermione anymore - she was next to Malfoy! Who is screaming? Fuck, there's so much blood, whose blood is it? Someone's grabbed me - fuck - oh, it's just Ron. He's yelling something but I can't hear him over the screaming. I can't stop shaking, I've got to pull it together and find Hermione. Fuck, there's a little kid with a leg missing. I've got you, I've got you. It'll be okay, I'll get you to help.
Harry grips his wand and follows Susan Bones into the building, the senior Aurors have already cleared the dangerous ring of criminals from the building. They're here to learn crime scene processing and how to handle evidence.
Harry followed Ginny to where she had indicated, he stared at Hermione and Ron over her head for support. Hermione heard Ginny's voice crack as she started talking, she had barely spoken since the fighting ended, "Harry, I... You have to understand, I thought we were going to die. I spent all this time thinking I'd never see you again, while trying to keep these students safe with Nev and..." She trailed off and looked at Neville, he stood tall while talking to Professor McGonagall, his grandmother's hand on his shoulder.
Ron's face is feral, "You tried to fuck her on our wedding day."
"I'm sorry," Draco's voice was soft, "to all of you. I'm sorry for my part in the war, I'm sorry I listened to my father's hateful nonsense from when I was little and I'm sorry that someone was so angry at me for all of that they sent a bomb here in spite of the risk it posed to kids who did nothing wrong."
"We're going to go see Hagrid, you coming?" Ron still had his arms around Hermione's waist.
All was well.
Draco looked around, noticing Harry was clearly absent. His heart sank, was Harry injured or had he just not wanted to be here? The door opened, slamming into the wall and startling Hermione and Pansy awake. Potter stood in the doorway, looking like Voldemort himself had been chasing him and stared at Draco. Before Draco could greet his friend, Harry threw himself into Draco's arms. Draco relaxed and then tensed again as Harry pulled back. Harry looked at Draco like he had never seen anything more incredible, then crushed their mouths together.
"I can't sit with fires in smaller rooms. At least in the Great Hall, it is away from me," Draco murmured, "I don't like fire."
Harry's eyes filled with tears, "I was the one who was dying? But I remember everything - Hermione and Ron sleeping here, Healer Gurjeet?"
"You were pushed by the curse to act differently than how you normally would," Draco confirmed, "Not that it makes it any easier for anyone to accept. Ginevra in particular has said that she does not care."
"Do you think - we could write to people and ask if they'd be willing to give me their memories," Harry felt awkward, "and I can watch them. I need to see the extent."
Draco had dropped his head onto his hands as soon as the words, 'I am so sorry for your loss' exited the healer's mouth. She went on to explain that they could keep Astoria's body functioning long enough to make the pregnancy viable. Draco hadn't acknowledged the news that his daughter could survive, provided his wife's body was kept animated for another five to ten weeks. Narcissa murmured that they would discuss it and provide an answer to the healer in one hour.
"Would you, would you both stay with me? Just while you're finding somewhere new to live since you've donated the Manor, um, if you'd like..." Narcissa relaxed her mask into a small, genuine smile before speaking, "Mr. Potter, you aren't obligated to do more for us-" Narcissa was interrupted by a loud cry, drawing Harry's eyes over to where her sister was trying to comfort a squalling baby while talking to the Medi-Wizards removing Tonks and Lupin from the Hall. Harry frowned at the sight of a struggling Andromeda trying to stand tall while holding his screaming godson. Harry didn't think to let go of Narcissa's hand as he rushed over to Andromeda.
"I'm fine, I'm fine," Harry gasped for air and struggled to sit up.
Harry was left alone in the dark with his cup of tea and his bewilderment at the weird behaviour of house elves.
Harry turns again and Disapparates to the Ministry, landing in the foyer. He strides off to the elevator bank, pressing the button for the Magical Law Enforcement floor.
Harry looked over at Draco at these words and felt a pang of kinship. They'd been put on opposite sides by the very people who should have shielded them from all the horror.
"I think you need to take a break, Harry," Hermione looks truly concerned now.
Ron looked forlorn as he sat with Harry at the kitchen bench, "Mate, it feels like you're already gone. I don't want you to die. I miss Fred."
Post owls, god I'm glad McGonagall ensured I don't get any that aren't routed through the Ministry. I'm sick of love potions on my fucking letters, sick of Aurors saying it's not technically a crime. Who the hell is sending Malfoy a parcel? His mum is still in a coma and Andromeda is so busy  - surely she's not just sending him a present when she can't even write to me. Lucius is dead, so I can't - what the fuck was that?!
Harry squeezed his eyes shut and asked a question he knew he'd regret, "Which friend?"
Ron skipped over to Hermione, who was talking to Kingsley nearby and interrupted their conversation to regale her of the new plans.
"Oh, he took a leave of absence from the shop. He's been helping Kingsley manage your workload. Kingsley is a godsend, came out of retirement just to fill your shoes. Ron has been spending time with the Aurors, trying to work out who I should promote if you don't want to come back..." Hermione gave Harry a teary look, "You know I would hate to lose you but... I just thought..."
The next day found Harry sitting next to Draco on a low bench, watching the Weasleys play a messy Quidditch game. It was snowing too hard for a Snitch, so they'd both opted out of playing.
"'E will likely tear it from you, mon couer," Fleur responds with a wink.
"It was illegal for Harry to have to compete with the Triwizard champions," Parvati sniffled, "It was unfair that you faced Voldemort at fourteen."
"Hermione, you're not doing great," George's voice was serious.
"Harry?" Hermione called out to him, wiping the tears from her eyes.
"Yes, but no memories of the time between," Harry tried to give her a friendly smile.
Narcissa had already pulled up her sleeve, and was having various diagnostics cast on it by the Auror who had stepped forward. "She's clean," was his curt assessment. Draco had hung back, fiddling with his left sleeve, Hermione felt suspicious at the action, surely then, he was Marked? Draco seemed to have steeled himself and held out his left arm for another Auror to inspect. "Ah! Got a Glamour on it, powerful one, but knew we'd catch you...er..." The Auror had gone green after seeing what he had uncovered on Draco's arm. Hermione herself felt sickened and clutched her
. "I'm sorry for other things too. I wish I'd been brave enough to talk to you in Sixth Year instead of just trying to kill you. Wish I'd taken you with us after that night at the Manor. Wish I'd taken your hand in First Year."
"Luna, I - need to know it all. I want to know - what I've done," Harry's voice was pained.
Harry felt the tears prickle his eyes as he heard the echo of Draco's voice. He'd never again hear the blonde's lazy drawl, the irritated sniff when someone brought baked goods to work when he was on a health kick, the low timbre of his voice going over their plan of attack.
Harry heard another swell of noise and glanced at a group standing combatively off to the side. The light caught on silver hair, his world immediately snapping into clarity, emotions roaring into his awareness again. There were a group of Aurors and Kingsley talking to the Malfoys. He saw Malfoy - Draco - surrender the wand he held and then help his mother to stand beside him. Harry felt a shock go through his body as the realisation hit him like a Bludger - they were here to take the Malfoys away to Azkaban.
Harry always liked the little stone bridge that crossed the creek behind the Burrow on the walk up to the main village, so he steered them in that direction. The morning sun was weakly shining over the snow encrusted scenery and gave them a scant amount of warmth. Harry shuddered as Draco's warming charm washed over him.
Can't believe Hermione made friends with him. I mean, he apologised, but she studies with him every day now. As if he never called her a know it all or a Mudblood? I really cannot believe Ron plays chess with him and shares jokes with him. How does he laugh with Ron? I have to make myself. I'm so tired. I thought I'd feel better by now.
"Mate, it feels like you're already gone. I don't want you to die. I miss Fred. I've never seen you like this, it's like you're a shadow of yourself. I need you around, mate," Ron's voice was rough.
Harry's mouth fell open in shock, "Depressed? I-" Then Harry remembered how he'd been for the first three months after the war had ended. "Oh, yeah. I'm depressed."
"You shouldn't have been forced to let Death Eaters into the school at sixteen," Harry twisted his wand in his fingers, "Or been forced to try and kill Dumbledore. I should have asked if you were okay instead of nearly cutting you in half."
"I'm going to go collect Teddy," Andromeda pressed a hand to Draco's shoulder, "Molly is probably tired of him by now."
"Potter," Draco stopped him with a hand on his wrist, "Um..." Draco made a funny movement with his left hand that Harry thought was supposed to be a welcoming gesture to Draco's own bed.
Hermione and Ron were already seated on a two-seater couch facing the fire.
"I'm alive, Harry. Where are you?"
" Hermione whipped her head around at the quartet of voices, Harry, Ron, Pansy and George sending blasts of red light at Nott. "Help me! Draco!" Hermione was handed Pansy's wand and immediately Apparated Draco to St. Mungo's. She felt the floor of St. Mungo's slam into her knees, hardly registering the pain she started screaming for Healers. A kind looking wizard pulled her hands from Draco's chest, electric blue waves rippling over the open wound while two Healers lifted Draco from her arms. Hermione watched them disappear down the hallway and allowed herself to finally fall to pieces.
"Celia's taking a Portkey to Bologna tonight. It will just be me at home." Draco arched a brow and Harry remembered too late that Draco had already told him this.
Draco was a maelstrom of emotions, his grief and anger at seeing his father laid out dead before him warring with the relief that they were
"Our thoughts exactly," Draco smiled shyly at Neville, he took the longest to come around to Draco's acceptance into their group of friends.
"And you love it." Albus finished with a smirk that reminded Harry firmly of Draco in school.
Harry flopped back down, staring at the ceiling. It was mocking him, Harry was sure. The honey coloured wood was Draco's suggestion, before Draco ceased to be able to suggest anything at all ever again. Harry regretted not appreciating Draco more - before discarding the thought. He'd appreciated Draco immensely, he'd just never quite found the guts to
Molly's Christmas morning spread was as glorious as ever, supplemented by Narcissa and Andromeda's delicate pastries and Ron's luxurious cinnamon rolls.
Hermione squeaks and drops him before he sits up.
Harry ran a shaking hand over Draco's jaw, "I thought you had died before I could tell you that I'm in love with you."
Draco and Harry had dressed in comfortable silence, both wearing soft pyjama bottoms and comfortable sweaters they had found in Harry's room. The pants were a little short on Draco's longer legs, but it was warm at Grimmauld Place. Harry looked dead on his feet, so Draco took his hand and led him back downstairs. Draco thought the kitchen must be in the basement, as they hadn't passed it before. His eyes widened appreciatively in the kitchen doorway, a long polished wooden table shone, while the room exuded warmth, from the candelabra that lit the room to the large fireplace.
him to pack a week ago. Ginny was lounging on the couch, half in Neville's lap, feet resting on George's leg. Ginny had taken as much of Fred's space as she could in George's life. Ron and Draco tried to fill the rest with their ideas and inventiveness. Hermione felt a pang of grief. It had only been four months since the Battle of Hogwarts - as The Daily Prophet had styled it.
"Lucius gave that to me to indicate his seriousness in courting me. Draco has always admired it. He will know the depth of your feelings and intentions." Narcissa's words were shaky at the end and Harry found his own eyes prickling with tears.
"I hate eating my meat rare," Lavender's tone made Harry feel guilty, "I feel like a freak."
"Yes, Harry would love to take you to Florida," Draco nodded seriously.
"Harry." He slumped into the purple chair, sighing loudly, "No. I got rid of the booze in my house after hearing about the Ginny thing. I'm just not sleeping very well."
how Harry felt. They'd shared a bed for a month before the Australia trip! Harry had only shared a bed with 'Mione and Ron before - and that was not romantic in the least.
"You're - you're alive," Harry was gripping Draco's hands as hard as he could - not that that was saying much.
Harry looked up at the afternoon sky and spotted a Hogwarts owl with a large bundle of letters heading their way and nudged Draco. Hermione took the letters from the owl, Ron feeding it a piece of sausage roll while Hermione handed everyone their results. He watched her hands shake violently as she opened hers, before freezing and staring at the letter in shock. "All O's, bloody hell 'Mione," Ron laughed at Hermione's gobsmacked face and kissed her on the cheek, "I passed everything, O in bloody Defence too!" Harry snuck a look at Draco's, "Draco got all O's too. I passed, got an O in Charms and Defence!" Pansy, Ginny and Neville chorused affirmation of good grades, Luna smiled serenely and destroyed her letter in a cloud of rainbow glitter without opening it, to Pansy's great amusement and Molly's abject horror.
"He's okay, Andy, I wasn't... I wasn't hurt..." Harry winced and glanced at Narcissa.
"You were a bit squished, twins are never easy. Sirius about broke my hip on the way out," Draco laughed and gently hip-checked his son.
₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪
"Third," Draco corrects.
Harry followed his eldest child towards the Floo and was stopped by Draco with a hand on his wrist. "Harry, what is going on?" Draco's eyes (always Harry's favourite feature) were wary.
Narcissa squeezed her shoulder and moved away, "I know, dearest, but Harry is our family too. It can't be easy for him seeing Draco like this and knowing that he contributed to it." Narcissa brushed a lock of hair off Draco's face, leaning in to press a kiss where his bruising was darkest. Not for the first time, Narcissa's quiet dignity and easy forgiveness gave Hermione pause. She suspected if Draco had been raised by Narcissa alone, he would have been a very different boy at eleven. Hermione felt a small squeeze against her hand, surprising her. She looked at Draco's face, tears springing at once when she saw grey eyes meeting hers from behind heavily bruised lids.
Except Molly. She's still holding my hand and crying over Hermione. She doesn't deserve to cry anymore. I'd give anything to make Molly's family whole again. Hey, Andromeda has arrived. Oof, Teddy is getting heavier. I love you, Teddy. I'm going to be the godfather we both deserved to have. I'm going to do everything I know Sirius wished he could have. I will keep you safe, I will love you, I will make sure your life is nothing like mine.
Everyone showed off their scars - physical and emotional - for the next hour.
Draco sent a gentle Episkey to the lip and perched on the edge of the bed, "The stinger went through me but the barb caught you in the hip. None of the poison went into me but you received enough to put you in a coma. You managed to kill the fucking thing, though. Didn't know you had Avada in you, but here we are."
Harry shrugged off his coat and sent it soaring over to the rack with a careless gesture before sweeping Minty into his arms and cuddling her. "They went to get some more things for dinner." Harry felt bad at the lie but didn't want to upset the four year old.
Hermione joined in the conversation with her own suggestions and she and Draco spent fifteen minutes chatting with Pansy and George. "We're supposed to meet Harry and Ron at the Hogs Head in about ten minutes, would you like to join us?" George and Pansy agreed and popped back into the building to grab their things, telling Hermione to head on without them. Draco chattered about parchment thickness for the duration of their walk to the pub, Hermione providing her own input on ink saturation.
"I woke up five days ago thinking it was the morning after I was cursed," Harry replied, "Nothing between the curse and then."
"What do you think this one will be?" Ron leans in to press his hand against Hermione's stomach and passes her another sandwich.
Draco had remained very still while Harry was speaking but upon Harry's use of his name he looked up to Harry with a furious expression and Disapparated.
Harry laughed at Draco's surprised expression and kissed him before tugging him over to the food table.
with you Ron?" She looked up to see Bill offering Hermione the end of a Christmas cracker. She glanced over at Luna, Teddy was asleep in her arms and Bill seemed to have noticed too. Hermione cast a
"I suspect you will, Harry," Draco left through the kitchen Floo.
Harry burst into tears again, "Oh Godric, Draco - I'm so sorry!"
Draco pulled away and pressed his head against Harry's, "The first time I sink into you is
Hermione's snort jolted Ron awake, "That's you, Draco. Godric, I miss him."
Harry froze, "What?"
Harry swallowed, "As is her right."
"You kept it," Harry croaked.
"Wait - I love you." Harry had both hands on Draco's chest and looked up at Draco's patrician features in fear. He needed to hear Draco say it back.
"Why is that - that
"Thanks," Draco sighed, "I'm sorry about yours. I did regret making fun of you about their deaths, especially now I understand how it feels."
Harry felt Draco's hand tighten around his wrist and felt a push in his mind, startled, Harry turned and looked Draco full in the eye before words came whispering into his head.
"Oh, cock." Harry groaned in realisation that this was her first sign of accidental magic and Draco wasn't here to see it. "He's going to blame me for this, y'know."
Luna regarded him coolly, her hair pulled into a wispy bun at the top of her head. Her office was plainer than Harry would have imagined, a single Mimbulus on her desk.
"I hated myself. It was selfish, to fall for you so soon after Ginevra passed... But I did. I do. I love you." Draco leaned down to capture Harry in another kiss.
Draco's anger was evident on his face but he picked up the file and continued to read dispassionately, "Patient shows extreme changes to personality, according to interviews with his family and friends. Aggression towards his partner, Trainee Healer Malfoy. Resentment towards expectations of him to be the same person he was, arrogance displayed when informed of his status in society. Patient quit job when he became aware of his financial status."
"So, you're aware of what you did to my sister," Ron hisses.
Harry was surprised by the gentleness of Draco's Legilimency, but then became irritated at the thought of Draco or Narcissa being ripped from him. Harry had saved every single person in the Wizarding World from a life worse than death. Didn't he deserve to keep something for himself?
"What is the treatment?" Draco asked.
Nott continued his tirade, "I wasn't Marked, I ran away from the bloody fight and helped get the First Years away safely. I still had to change schools! Do you know how fucking awful Durmstrang is? Bloody miserable chunk of rock, honestly." Draco just stared at Nott, Hermione thought he looked paler than usual. "Meanwhile, you and your Death Eater-whore mother somehow wind up under the protection of The Boy Who Just Wouldn't Fucking Die." Hermione inhaled sharply at the insult to Narcissa and spoke up. "Theodore, right? Our friends are meeting us here soon. Maybe we should just go inside and get a drink and chat?"
Harry Potter looked blankly around the Great Hall, barely seeing the people and movements swarming him, mutely hearing the encompassing roar of grief and celebration. He felt numb, all his warring emotions in the moments after Voldemort - no, Harry would call him Tom now - fell to his own curse had blended into a senseless, all encompassing nothing. Briefly, Harry considered that he might have lost his ability to feel when Tom tore his own Horcrux out of Harry's soul.
Looking up at a sudden commotion at the doors, Draco observed a group of Aurors coming towards him and his mother, led by Kingsley Shacklebolt. Draco tensed, but knew this had been coming. He nodded calmly their way, accepting his fate, hoping they'd be lenient on his mother. Narcissa was not Marked and had only been concerned with keeping her family safe and whole. Kingsley drew up in front of him, "Mr. Malfoy, Mrs. Malfoy, we'll need you to come with us. Please surrender your wands." Draco stood and immediately handed his mother's wand to the nearest Auror. He turned to help his mother to her feet, she leaned into him heavily but closed her face into a regal mask. "We come willingly," were the first words he had spoken in an hour.
"I can take him for a couple of days, Andy," Harry offered.
Harry relaxed and deepened the kiss further, before pulling back to rest his forehead on Draco's and let out a shuddering breath. The noise in the room then became too much to ignore.
- A Happy Life. It shows the Veela the life they would have had, if their Mate had wanted them back. It is used as part of the bonding ceremony for the Veela and the Mate, if they're requited. It shows the pair their life together, the highlights, so they know things will work out," Hermione's tears are slipping out, "In this case, used with the drugs we gave him... It let him slip away happy. It was kind."
Draco shook his head, "No. You shouldn't sleep there, it can't be good for your back or the baby."
"You did what you could, you couldn't protect him any more than you tried to," Andromeda brushed her hand over his knee.
Harry looked at Narcissa, she was just as startled as he was, Harry then looked to Ron, who winked and headed out into the upstairs sitting room after the pair. Molly leaned into Harry, "Not to worry about young Malfoy, George isn't angry at anyone. I think he's just looking for someone to provide the expertise that F-Fred took with him." Harry took her hand and was determined to be supportive throughout the next few weeks. "Molly, we're going to get through it, and we'll be happy again one day. Fred would be narked if he thought we were miserable about him forever." Molly pressed trembly kiss to Harry's temple and patted his hand with her other.
"About three years ago you became aware of your former relationship with Ginevra Weasley. You proceeded to get her completely intoxicated on Firewhiskey and fucked her on the lounge in the flat she and I owned. I would say it takes two to tango but I don't believe her blood-alcohol level allowed her to consent properly. I returned home to find you both drunk and entangled, still naked. Unfortunately, her and my relationship was unable to recover," Luna turned away from Harry at this point.
"You are our blood, you are our eldest, you could not have chosen a more worthy life partner," Draco wraps his arm around Harry's shoulder and hoists his own glass.
He kept one protective arm wrapped around his mother's shoulders while she silently wept. Draco knew her grief was not over Lucius, but what his choices had done to their lives. Draco knew his mother was crying for allowing Lucius and her bigoted parents to divide her from her once favourite sister.  His cousin, barely known except in name was lying on the stone floor across the room, with the aunt Draco had never met clutching a bundle he knew to be her newborn grandson.
Harry stared at the sparrow outside, "I don't know if I can. I think I died when he did. He was the first wizard I met, aside from Hagrid. It's always been him and me."
Ron twitched nervously to Hermione's left, startling when Fleur offered him a plate of pumpkin pie. Hermione was concerned. Ron had been distant for the last two weeks, he could barely look her in the eye or have a full conversation with her. Draco eyed him sternly from across the room where he sat braiding Ginny's hair and talking to her and Harry about the Quidditch trial Ginny was going to have with the Holyhead Harpies. Hermione didn't think Ron would ever cheat on her, but he was acting so oddly that she knew he was keeping something from her. Something to do with Draco. She was worried, maybe Draco and Ron had a fight? They had gone to Hogsmeade with Harry and Luna two weeks ago while she updated Kingsley on her Map project. Harry and Luna hadn't mentioned anything untoward, Luna had said, "Ronald is just experiencing the effects of Nargles from the mistletoe decorations. Perhaps his head will clear after Christmas?"
Draco stepped away from the bed and watched the healer and medi-witch work.
"She killed your father," Harry's hand was clammy in Draco's.
"If the most evil wizard in recent history couldn't do Potter in, I doubt some oversized cat with a pointy tail can manage it," Draco's drawl masked his concern.
Harry woke up abruptly, it was past midnight he realised with a jolt. A shining lynx stood before him, Kingsley's voice addressing him, "Harry, he's awake now." Harry scrambled to his feet and got ready to run, before realising he had no idea which room Draco was in. He rushed down the hall, catching sight of the lime green robes of a Healer. "Oi! Excuse me, please!" The Healer turned back to Harry and he found himself staring at Penelope Clearwater. "Oh, Harry, are you looking for your family?" He nodded mutely. Penelope smiled and checked her parchment, "Room 4, down the way you came and right at the cactus." Harry raced back the way he came and flung the correct door open.
"Harry! Harry please wake up!" Hermione was sobbing, "Harry, c'mon you've been sleeping for days. Ever since you were stung you've been slipping away and you can't - you can't!"
"It's hard not to be angry at you, the you we've had for five years," Hermione said, "I know for you it's been like three days since you were cursed."
Andromeda stands too, "You will not see my grandson."
"I'm asking Hermione to marry me, you promise you'll be my best man?" Ron asked.
"Did she tell you what you did to 'Mione?" Ron snarls.
"Sorry," Draco looked down at the still musty sheets, "I'm not great with laundry spells."
Draco's sitting with his arms crossed in the chair he used to occupy in Harry's house. "I see you're still alive."
- while Draco rallied and spoke again, "As head of House Malfoy, I would like to formally apologise to you all for the offences committed against your family by my father, mother and myself. It was unconscionable to behave so abhorrently to you, who are family in blood and magic, and I offer unconditional allegiance to the House Weasley and its Heirs from this day until my last." He had bowed his head at the last sentence.
"Ronald! We agreed to tell together," Hermione's teeth bite her grinning lip, "It's a Hugo."
"It was subtle, at first. It was understandable when you couldn't be affectionate, you didn't know us. You didn't want to sleep in the same room with Draco at all. Over time though..." Hermione looked to Ron.

. Draco had never seen his mother do something as plebeian as perch on the arm of someone else's chair, much less in front of a crowd of people. Everyone had noticed that Draco was awake and were whispering congratulations and well wishes, trying not to wake the two girls sleeping in the corner. Kingsley waved his wand, sending a feline Patronus off like a wisp of wind.
"It's not his fault," Hermione glared at Harry, "As if he asked for this! And my arm and Marcie's leg were able to be grown back because thankfully we had only physical injuries and not curse damage!"
"I'm sorry about your parents," Harry whispered, "I should have said so earlier."
"Potter, Draco tells me you're back," Pansy gave Harry a look she hadn't fixed him with since school.
Harry reached out his hand and ran it down one of the long slashes across Draco's chest. "Draco-" Harry choked on the words of his apology. Draco had been so caring with him today and Harry had nearly killed him. Draco grabbed his hand and pressed it flat over his heart. Harry calmed at the steady rise and fall of Draco's breathing. Draco's Legilimency push into his mind again, a soothing whisper, it was nothing like Snape or Riddle blundering through his mind.
"That would be Tony, who according to Molly is your latest - boyfriend," Draco's anger broke through the mask briefly.
"She tripped and her robe ripped and she's wearing lacy knickers." Charlie's voice was rasping.
Draco immediately felt warmed after his first mouthful of soup. "As wonderful as I remember as a girl, Kreacher," Narcissa commented kindly. Draco thought if anyone praised Kreacher further, he might explode with happiness. Andromeda placed her spoon down and looked at the two boys opposite her. "Draco, your mother and I have mended our rift, I hope you will feel comfortable calling me Aunt or Andy, as your mother does. You too, Harry. We might have come together under awful circumstances, but we are sort of family and we can support each other." Narcissa placed a hand on Andromeda's arm and smiled warmly at her sister.
"Where has he gone though?" Ron is demanding to know.
Harry poured the first memory in the Pensieve, dunking his head in and falling into a consultation room.
Six months ago, Draco had announced he was joining the new dating service 'Wix Wish' and Harry had panicked once more. Ron spent weeks slowly pushing Harry towards telling Draco how he felt. He'd set up a lovely dinner of Draco's favourite meal (fettuccine Alfredo) and was wearing a new shirt. Draco had breezed into the kitchen, accepted the glass of white wine and gleefully told Harry that he'd met someone
"I would talk to Ron and Hermione, Draco has informed the family of your current situation. They will accept you this afternoon at five o'clock. Here is their new address," Luna handed him a slip of paper with 'The Lioness' Library' written on it.
"Oh, Draco's coming?" Hermione perked up, "He mentioned it in a letter, but he was unsure."
"Lied, cheated, drank yourself to death, beat me, took advantage of Ginny, hurt Hermione and Ron beyond repair, manipulated me," Draco listed tonelessly.
The first floor must have changed. "It used to be the coldest sitting room," Narcissa commented. Now, there was a lovely master bedroom with ensuite taking up the floor, Narcissa's traveling trunk at the foot of the bed. "Well, this must be my room, let's continue, shall we?" On the landing of the second floor, Draco immediately realised this would be for Andromeda, as there was another lovely master suite with an attached nursery, filled with blankets and soft toys. Andromeda took Teddy into the nursery to change him, Narcissa followed her sister and gestured for the boys to continue upstairs.
Eventually Harry and Draco were left alone, standing in the weak late-winter sunshine.
"Is it done?" Hermione rasps.
"When is the funeral?" Harry asked.
so the loud boom of the cracker wouldn't upset the baby. Hermione pulled hard and came away with the cracker, winning a pair of glittering reindeer horns on a headband that had luminescent flowers and, oddly, small Kneazles decorating the band. She also won a small sewing kit with Self-Threading Needles and Many Coloured Thread that matched whatever garment you were sewing. Hermione smiled, it would be useful to have in her and Ron's new apartment. They had been going over a list of locations where they would want to live after graduation. Hermione's smile faded, she wondered if whatever was bothering Ron was going to impact their relationship so badly they wouldn't be living together.
Hermione slumped back against his shoulder, "Do you think you'll ever rejoin us in the land of the living?"
The thought startled Harry into action, striding across the Great Hall towards the group. His wand held aloft like an accusing finger, Harry wordlessly dropped the restraints away from the tall boy before him. The Aurors burst into furious action and faced Harry, whipping their wands up before realising who they were opposing. Harry pushed into the group, placing his back to Draco and Narcissa, staring down the Aurors with a cold look on his face. "What are you doing?" He faced Kingsley as he asked this question, hoping their previous friendship would stop the challenge in his voice from angering the man too much.
"I felt sick the first few months and I hated being itchy during the full moon," Lavender turned to Parvati, "But Pav made me realise that I'm still me, I'm not my injuries or my eating habits."
Draco Malfoy hurt quite a bit. Not physically, he was pretty sure Madam Pomfrey had filled him to his eyeballs in pain potions. No, Draco was heartbroken. He had been sure he was going to die alone on that classroom floor, beaten and tormented by Slytherins who resented him. Then he had heard fighting, he was sure it was Hermione and Neville, Ron's familiar shout coming a few moments later. Draco had felt hope, they had cared enough to come after him. Crawling his way over to where he was pretty sure his wand had been thrown, he felt the familiar hilt fit into his hand and tried to spell away the blindfold. It wasn't successful, so he set about casting a Shield Charm, to keep him from more injury until his friends could restore his vision. Moments later he heard Harry's shout of "
Fuck, Hermione is watching me eat again. I hate eating meat, why don't they have more vegetables at breakfast? Parvati is vegetarian, I should ask her about it. Ugh, I don't know how she can sit next to Lavender while she eats basically half a raw cow. I guess she loves her though, so love is apparently ignoring the fact that your partner has completely opposite eating habits to you. I wonder if she makes Lavender clean her teeth before they kiss. Oh, yuck, no I don't want to imagine that.
"Draco, love, it's not the end of the world," Harry hands his husband a cup of hot chocolate.
"Harry, I love you," Draco leans in to press a soft kiss on Harry's lips.
The next floor up had a sizeable library and what Harry startlingly identified as a cinema room, as well as another washroom. Draco gaped at the screen on one wall, wondering what the purpose of the room was. It was filled with low, comfortable looking lounges and more pillows than he'd ever seen.  The fourth floor held Sirius and Regulus' rooms. Harry sadly explained who the two men had been, Draco didn't think Kreacher would expect Harry to want to sleep in either of the rooms.
Luna crossed her fingers and placed them on her desk, "That could be extremely traumatic. For yourself, I mean."
"Draco... Is there any way I can convince you to give me a second chance?" Harry pleads.
Harry was just about at the Floo when he caught sight of something violet coloured on the coat rack - it was a travelling cloak at looked remarkably like Draco's. Black damask silk on one side and the violet lining with patterns of oriental origin. He blinked rapidly, remembering the day Draco had come to work with it for the first time.
"It's not surprising that with everything you've heard about yourself recently," Luna seemed more kind, "you've become depressed."
"Morning, Mr. Potter! Oh, hello Mr. Malfoy, beat me here. No changes?" Healer Gurjeet nodded at the medi-witch taking readings from Harry's vitals, who shook her head sadly.
"Wait!" Harry nervously crossed the kitchen.
"Harry."
Draco is the one to hand him the memory, his hand shaking slightly.
Everyone turns to look at him, half shocked he's spoken but all nodding in agreement. Except Harry, who is furious.
"My brother," Ron spoke up, "Greyback got him in sixth year. Not a full wolf, but like you, has some traits."
" before his world went black.
Neville stood up and whooped, "Yeah! That's my girl!" Ginny had faked out the Keeper and scored her fifth goal. Draco turned to Harry, "Thank God I wasn't the Keeper for Slytherin against that girl, would have destroyed my ego after a week honestly." Harry smirked at him, "Yeah, you just had to lose the Snitch to me every time we played." Draco rolled his eyes and gripped Harry's wrist again,
"I can't believe it's our first field assignment," Susan whispered excitedly.
She leaned forward and Harry's chest exploded into pain. The last thing he saw was a blurry vision of Draco's silvery locks surrounding bloodshot grey eyes.
"Of what?" Harry watched Ginny spiral around George to throw the Quaffle into the makeshift goal.
Ron hooted from beside Hermione, Ginny had scored again. Draco cheered and exchanged a smile with Neville over Harry and Luna's heads. Ginny was incredible. Her long copper hair was wrapped into two intricate buns on the top of her head. Draco had braided it so that it would not distract her as she flew. She pulled her broom tightly in an arc, dodging a Bludger and chasing after the Quaffle again. Draco watched Ginny score her fourth goal within half an hour and smugly told Hermione that if the Harpies looked at anyone else, they were the daftest team in the league. Harry chuckled at his remark and gave Draco a smile that made his heart stir. Draco shifted in his seat, it hadn't just caused his heart to stir.
, Hermione felt their confusion echoed in her mind. George whispered something to Harry as he handed back the baby, before drawing back into his mother's arms.
"Here, dear, have some food," Molly plonked a container filled with her banana and chocolate chip muffins down in front of him.
s more. She couldn't cast a very big Shield though, so she had concentrated it over Draco, surmising that only he would draw Nott's fire. "Look at you, strutting around the bloody town like you own it with the Golden Mudblood." Draco bristled beside her, Hermione knew Draco hated the word now, it reminded him too much of hateful past insults.
"Starting a huge garden," Neville strolled over, "Draco is training to be a Potions Master and I want to work in Herbology. So we're going into business together."
"Better? Even after thirty years it's like you forget that you're a wizard sometimes." Draco's smile tugged at Harry's heart and he stopped them. "Harry?"
"Sometimes I wish I hadn't survived," Harry ventured, "Because then I wouldn't have had to deal with the pain."
He groaned, "Molly, what-?"
"For me too," Justin joined in, "The idea of learning to harm someone - even to help myself - I just don't think I can do it."
Draco was watching incredulously as he watched Harry Potter drag his mother across the Great Hall towards her estranged sister. He had jumped when he had first seen her, only to relax once he saw the baby in her arms - no way that Bellatrix would ever hold a child willingly. His mind was still reeling with all that had occurred in the last few minutes, so he joined the odd trio a few minutes later. Harry had let go of Mother's hand in order to take the bundle from his aunt - Andromeda, he recalled.
"Potter and Malfoy, understanding enemies," Draco laughed gently.
"Want me to motivate you into getting up?" Draco's teeth nipped at Harry's ear and his erection was pressed against Harry's arse.
Harry chuckled at Hermione's wide eyed expression and muttered, only loud enough for her and Draco to hear, "Yeah, weird at first when he does it, isn't it." Hermione looked at Harry with new curiosity. Harry made it sound like Draco spoke to him frequently without words.
Harry placed his empty bottle on the counter and grabbed another drink for himself. Ron was still halfway through his first drink.
Scorpius Malfoy was an uncommonly kind and incredibly intelligent boy. Scorpius took one look at Harry, his face furrowed (so like his father's) and said, 'They're dead, aren't they?' Harry tried to tell him that his grandmother or father would talk to him but Albus gave Harry a glare that Molly would have been proud of and he broke down with the news. Draco collected Scorpius the next morning, leaving with his son and a permanent invitation from Ginny to come over 'whenever you need us'.
The smoking howler the owl was carrying activated as Harry tried to stop the owl from knocking over the gravy boat. The shrill voice of Celia took Harry a moment to identify before he registered the actual words it was speaking
George had been silent for most of the planning, but stood bolt upright and stared down at Draco with a wild look on his face. Harry started for his wand, ready to put up a shield charm, before catching Draco's eye. Draco shook his head minutely and turned to face George. "You! You're, you! You were good at Potions!" Draco looked confused at George's outburst and nodded, "Er, yes. I earned an Outstanding on my Potions O.W.L. I hope to earn the same on my N.E.W.T. if we get a chance to sit them." George nodded maniacally, "Yes, and you swore allegiance to the Weasleys, did you mean it?" Draco stood and gracefully bowed, "Of course, how can I be of service?" George grabbed him by his arm and yanked him out of the kitchen, "Malfoy, you better be comfortable with hellebore!"
Maybe cooking dinner would be better?
He had a sneaking suspicion this wouldn’t be the last of the letters. With a grunt he left his memories on the floor and trudged to bed. Perhaps tomorrow would treat him with more kindness.
Draco stared at the letter before he frantically tore it to pieces. The last thing he needed was some sappy school peer to try to get back in touch with him. He didn’t care why the mystery person missed him. He wanted all memories of past Draco destroyed. Burned in the grasp of time until he was all but ashes.
Left without a response she wailed out, “Call a medic!”
The poor boy hadn’t even noticed Harry was in the same aisle. It was only when Draco got on his tippy toes to reach a bag of flour on the top shelf, that he felt a hand brush his. He quickly pulled back his hand as if he had been burned and turned to complain at the other man, “Watch where your bloody hands go-“ his words snapped off as his eyes fell on curly locks of brown hair and a lighting scar.
Narcissa gave her son a soft sigh. “He tries his best you know. He just wanted the best for us.”
And Harry was slowly reestablishing himself in his life... He looked down at his bleeding palms and sighed.
Don’t block out the memories Draco. It only fuels hatred.
He made it back to the Slytherin’s quarters and walked to the bathroom. Upon inspecting himself in the mirror, he determined the slap wouldn’t leave a mark. Now all he had to focus on was soothing the pain. He turned on the faucet and let the water turn to a cool but not freezing temperature before soaking a rag in it. He pressed the wet rag against his face and sighed.
Harry’s eyes darted to his shoes, suddenly finding them interesting, “M’sorry, Ron. I should’ve been there.”
Harry gulped at the thought. He’d been a fool to think everything would go back to normal. Back to the good old Hogwarts. The Hogwarts that raised him up to be the young man he was today. Of course, the war had torn him away from the comfort he had once felt in these walls. Students roamed the halls like they were the living dead. Spirits had been broken and Harry couldn’t blame them. His spirit hadn’t exactly got away unscathed.
He rapped on the door before slowly opening it. Hermione and Ginny were already sitting at Ron’s bedside.
“Harry, if you don’t eat your food will get cold.” Hermione waved her hand in front of Harry’s eyes, causing them to flick back his plate.
Draco looked to his mother in disbelief, “I am not lonely-“
He decided he’d go to bed early today. The sun was still high in the sky but he curled under his sheets anyway. He’d just have to learn to cook some other day. He had plenty of time.
After dressing he picked up a handful of get-well cards he had made for Ron. His favorite of which was titled “Get well, Wanker.” It gave him a good chuckle writing it, something he needed in a time like this. He placed them carefully in his quidditch bag and navigated his flat until he reached the fireplace.
Also I wrote this chapter on my phone, and autocorrects a bitch. I’ll try my best to proofread but without a beta reader it’s a bit difficult <3
Ron furrowed his brows, “Why are you all acting like I’m dead. I’m right here! Paralyzed yeah, but not dead!” He crossed his arms angrily. His arms and head seemed to be the only thing he could move.
She left with no further comment. Leaving cold lonely Draco to sit alone in his cold lonely home. How was he of all people going to find a flat mate? No one in their right mind would stay with him.
As if almost understanding what Ron was about to say Harry looked up and shook his head.
The wax cracked apart easily as Draco opened the letter. He pulled out the paper and was surprised to find it had been sprayed with cologne. A cologne he recognized all too quick. It smelt like Harry. The thought made him shiver in disgust as he looked down at the beautifully written words. No doubt done in black ink and written by a feathered quill.
Within the next few hours, Harry would learn of his friend's paralysis from the waist down. Unable to be healed by magic he would not be able to be the team's keeper.
Saturday left his heart aflame.
“I don’t want a flat mate mother, I want to be alone.” Draco assured her. They were vile lies. He was so cold and alone here. Just going through the schedule everyday, never doing anything different. Never saying good morning to someone or waving them goodnight before they split off to their rooms.
“Mr. Potter if there was anything you could’ve changed, what would’ve been?”
Draco did NOT miss being young.
“The hospital. I’m long overdue to visit Ron.” It was true. He hadn’t seen his friend since he was admitted 2 weeks ago. Not being able to bear to see Ron in and out of a magically induced coma, he stayed home. Now that he was out of coma and doing well, he decided to bring him the cards he had made.
He mindlessly ringed people up at the register, bagging potions and ingredients. He rung up person after person flawlessly. Then he fumbled with one coin. Only one. He dropped it.
