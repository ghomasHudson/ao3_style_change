good at this, Harry can feel his prick touch the back of Malfoy’s throat before he’s pulling out just to rub the head across that full lower lip, glistening with spit and come.
“It’s part of the Orion family. Orion’s just above it, right there. Past Lepus and Monoceros.”
crying that day, remember?” It’s goading on purpose, and he returns a hand to Malfoy’s wrists.
Draco had been fourteen the first time Potter had intruded on a wank. At first, it was just lean musculature in Quidditch leathers. Then the sinewy frame got a face, and that face looked like Potter.
anything, just listening to his lovely boyfriend tell him about the stars. It’s
She almost hadn't gone. First reading the letter had left Hermione absolutely incandescent with indignation and anger, but then she'd remembered she was an adult with a husband and a child and a career and Pansy Parkinson deserved to have zero ability to affect her emotional state these days when she was as happy as she'd ever been and fiercely proud of her life.
Draco shakes his head. Thinking about his childhood makes him desperately sad, lately. “Boring and hot. I have a better one.”
"Yeah, exactly," says Harry, crossing his arms and leaning back against a sink. "I want to do something with it and I'll have more ... you know, influence, if I'm working at the Ministry." He grins crookedly. "Besides, I'm afraid I'll get all tense and have some kind of allergic reaction if I can't save someone once in a while."
Harry resettles himself after Draco tries to buck him off, oddly aroused by the show of resistance. “I couldn’t kill someone,” he says truthfully, and he speaks it against Malfoy’s throat like an eroticism rather than the morbidity it really is. He’s achingly hard and grinds his cock down against Malfoy’s, biting back a moan against his skin.
"My Patronus-sake, actually. He was an Animagus," he explains. "Turned into a stag."
“Mm. Hideously expensive, but I’m happy with the results,” Draco says. He ponders the night sky above him lovingly.
After he gets the head past the initial muscle (groaning at the way Malfoy squeezes around him), he takes his time sinking the rest of the way inside, savouring every inch as he buries it in all that tight, wet heat. One hand on Malfoy's waist, the other flat across his navel where he can feel the ring digging into his palm, he forces the whole length of it inside before finally pausing to ask, in a much less authoritative voice, "You good?"
"Likewise."
“Ginevra doesn’t fancy a throttling?”
“And what,” Draco says, maintaining a pretence of utter bewilderment at the sudden hardness in his cock, “is that supposed to mean?”
He loves this, Harry decides: the agreeable sense of control, the way Malfoy just absolutely liquefies once he’s given in. He knows he’s not going to last long so he makes every stroke count, slow and hard, tightly squeezing Malfoy’s gloriously long neck and sweating with the effort of both. “Harder?” he asks.
A week or two. Not a month.
“After you,” he says instead, gesturing towards the kitchen. He likes the eye roll Ginny gives him before she stands up.
They're fond memories, though they don't do much to alleviate the chill of reality. Five Christmases trapped as a prisoner in her own home and the spirit tends to fade a bit.
Harry trails his lips up to Malfoy’s mouth and kisses him. When he pulls away he finds Malfoy’s hands, presses them above his head, and then finds his mouth again. His hips stutter and his pace quickens and eventually he’s not kissing him anymore but panting into his mouth as he fucks him. “Are you close?” he mumbles.
Harry laughs, mostly at how stupid the situation is. He'd thought they would at least have gotten drunk before this started happening. He'd also thought he'd end up being the one initiating it, but Charlie's looking at him like he used to when they were shagging all the time, and it's nice, regardless of what happens later, not to have to exert energy to have something he wants. He wonders whether that's exactly why Charlie's doing it, and he doesn't care if he is.
"The lift!" Pansy echoes, startled into further laughter. Merlin, she could murder him for putting his job at risk that way but the whole thing is so deliciously lurid. "You complete slut, Draco Malfoy. Fucking Potter in a stalled lift. Tell me, did it take more or less than half an hour?"
?” He smirks a little when he says it and squeezes Draco’s wrists again.
Harry stumbles back more than he would have had he not been inebriated. "You're not listening to
"It's a
Ron grins, more than a little turned on when feral Hermione makes an appearance.
Draco keens, winds his arms blindly around Harry’s neck. It doesn’t escape Harry that this is where they started, almost exactly — Draco pressed flush and writhing, the blades of his angular shoulders jabbing at Harry’s chest with every deliberate grind of his hips.
“—l’me make you feel,
“Go on,” Harry says, palming enthusiastically at Draco’s cock. Already sensitive, it swells keenly at his touch. Harry keeps his expression impassive. He’s not
Ron himself is sitting at the kitchen table with Hermione and Rose, and little Teddy Lupin. Teddy's on Hermione's knee, and Rose is in his arms.
There’s a cobra lily trying to curl itself around his ear. Draco flicks it away. “Everything’s splendid. Tell me what you think of the book, will you?”
"The what?" says Neville. His eyes are completely bloodshot.
“What did you think I was? Made of stone?”
"What the hell," he says, "I wasn't finished with that pudding, Harry. And quit doing our dishes, how many times do we have to tell you?"
“How offensive. And in this cathedral of acceptance,” says Malfoy. He hasn’t moved back. There’s smudges around his eyes. Smoky black smudges behind his lashes, on the corners of his lids. They’re a little drippy, like he put on eyeliner two nights ago, passed out on the floor of a club, and hasn’t stopped to reapply since.
“You’re an arrogant twat,” he says, and he crowds into Malfoy’s space, looming over him where he’s pressed against the counter. “Maybe it’s got nothing to do with you. Did you consider that one, Malfoy?”
Draco pulls his sleeve further into his palm. He nods.
Any irritation on Hermione’s part is eclipsed by the surprise she feels at hearing Pansy say about Draco exactly what she would have said about Harry. Which is ... interesting.
“You’re off already?” Granger’s pile of blankets is squirming.
"Meaning what?" Harry prompts cautiously.
“That’s very thoughtful of you.”
just come to spy on you for Hermione," Harry says, hopping up onto the kitchen table while Ron goes about putting together a bottle for Rose. "I have to ... confess to something, I think."
Ron’s voice comes from inside an Extended cupboard, sounding meters away even though Harry can still see the cuff of his jeans. “Yeah.”
about it. Like, how you’re feeling?”
It was good, because it had an end in sight. And it was Charlie, a Weasley, Ron's brother he'd never
“Let me
"Yes, but I'll still miss you. Visit?"
When Ron found out, he said something like, "I don't give a fuck. Ginny might, though. Kind of weird."
“I’m not the one wearing them,” Harry points out.
He looks at the doors to the Great Hall and decides without much thinking not to go back. Instead he heads back upstairs, and he sits alone on the windowsill in the eighth-year Gryffindor boys’ dorm, and he smokes a full joint so he can get rid of the encroaching hangover and sleep.
Charlie’s refusal isn’t really surprising. Disappointing a little, but not surprising. Harry nods, tucks himself back in, Vanishes the mess, and decides to get in one last kiss before the whole moment is over and everything else ends with it. This is the last time they’ll do this — he can feel that in his gut.
Arm draped across Draco’s body, head half-buried in a pillow with his mouth next to Draco’s ear, still deeply sated from a proper fuck, Harry can’t imagine a more complete contentedness.
"Of course. Well, I'll see myself out, then."
He snorts. When he’s offended, it usually comes out as derision. “Unfortunately livers don’t go for a jot of what they used to, or I would have brought caviar.”
Draco's not exactly unaware of how much his offer sounds like an innuendo, but he figures context is important. To Potter, it shouldn't matter. And then Potter comes closer, and looks at him like that.
“You’re being theatrical again,” Blaise says. He picks up what looks to be a rather expensive silk top that’s been flung over one of the couches (if it’s Pansy’s, Blaise is about to get the flaying of a lifetime) and lazily towels at the spunk on his stomach. “You only do it when you’re tetchy, Draco. Pansy, shall we put him down for a nap?”
“Mm. You’re going to talk,” Harry says. “And I’m going to suck you. And finger you until you
He's found himself next to Hermione, and she's always great for a chat, always wanting to know about his work and the studies he's written on dragon welfare, which he's always surprised to hear she's actually read, so dinner is a lovely affair. By the time Molly serves the pudding, he's got his niece in his arms, Teddy's turned his hair red, and Harry's looking properly happy and a little bit drunk, with his feet up on Ron's lap.
Draco tucks his clipboard under his arm. "Is it a personal matter? If that's the case, you'll have to wait until I'm off the clock. Mungo's is awfully stingy when it comes to wasting paid time. You can take a seat in the waiting room, if you like. My shift finishes in six hours."
“A veritable feast, Harry,” says Neville. Ron shakes his head, as if it will clear it, and shoves Hermione’s feet off his lap so he can inspect Neville’s wares.
"Oh, the
“Then I’m sure we’ll end up fighting again soon,” Harry says. It’s an annoying thing to say, but it’s very Draco. And right now, he’s stupidly endeared by anything that’s

to happen now.
The tapenade is unfortunately very good, something Ron seems to have realised based on how much of it he’s eaten. He keeps shooting glares at Malfoy, as if he resents enjoying it, and Harry joins him in tossing casual insults Malfoy’s way while he and Hermione descend deep into their academic discussion. Which is actually sort of interesting, only Harry would rather die than admit that.
Harry smiles, pleasantly surprised. “Someone’s nice in the morning,” he says, and he drops his hand to Draco’s neck to thumb — excessively gently — at the bruising. It’s not
—is attractive, Malfoy is here, and Malfoy is actually quite funny. In a way that would probably make Hermione anxious.
At that Harry lets go, but he’s mad at himself for it afterwards. He says, “You’re one to preach about suppressed emotion,” and takes the liberty of lifting Malfoy’s shirt off over his head. He runs a thumb across a long, thin scar on his chest. “Although you
Pansy had told him. He’d have reamed into Draco about it if Pansy hadn’t made him swear on his cock he wouldn’t say anything.
"Oh, good," Harry says, "that image is only slightly less damaging to me than the ones conjured up by the noises I heard coming from Ron's room over the summer." Those had been bad.
He’s marmoreal, he is, and — “
Malfoy hums again. “Off the top of my head, you could drop trou for the paps. That’d pay your bills for a year or two.”
"Cormac," says Draco. He was rather proud of himself, for that one. "McLaggen."
His name and that little
Hermione watches suspiciously as the receptionist goes into Pansy’s office and then comes back out, and suddenly she can’t help wondering if there’s not actually anyone in there. Not that she’ll know for sure, assuming there’s a Floo.
“How immature,” Malfoy says, and tosses an arm back around Harry’s neck.
Malfoy snorted. “Yes. Would you like to borrow it?”
— so fucking good.” Harry leans over, skin sliding over sweaty skin, and pulls Draco up against his chest.
“He’s looking through the coif. Your hair is basically translucent.”
still care, just in a different way now. “I can’t help it I’m a natural flier,” he jokes, pinching Draco’s hip. “And I did do some pretty wicked stuff to earn those House points, you have to admit. Maybe if you’d been less focused on fucking with me and more focused on finding the Chamber
Mother looks a little pained as she says it, but Draco appreciates the effort. “Yes. She’s head of the ward, you see. I often seek her consultation on my patients.”
want out of this yet.”
Ron isn’t sure he likes it either. George still makes everyone laugh, but everything he says sounds so sardonic and detached. It’s weird.
over it. Jesus christ.
Draco arches his back against the tree behind him. “Forgive me for trying to humble you, Potter. Supposed you get enough praise these days.”
The next few days were harder. Avoiding Harry resulted in some terribly uncomfortable hiding places. Whatever, Potter had made him look like an idiot, and he'd crouch in a million broom cupboards if it meant he never had to face the clod again.
He’s not exactly an expert or anything on reading Malfoy’s facial expressions (he remembers from Hogwarts that it was usually some variation on disdain anyway), but he fancies he sees something, some small intimation of hurt or offense or ... something. It doesn’t matter, he doesn’t care if he’s hurt Malfoy’s (highly ironically) delicate feelings. But it’s sort of interesting, in a fuck-Malfoy-and-his-delicate-feelings kind of way.
He waits until he hears Malfoy leaving out the front door before emerging, drying his hands on a towel.
“You’re,” says Draco.
. Tell me, was it difficult for you when they decided to make things official? No more orgiastic Gryffindor fun once they went monogamous, I suppose.”
"What?" says Seamus (he's frowning, even though he's heard this many times before).
“Shut up,” he snaps at him; it’s too sharp and too loud and probably lets Malfoy know he’s already managed to get under his skin. “Merlin’s fucking — just shut the fuck up for once, Malfoy. Jesus.”
Because, here’s the thing; Harry likes that his boyfriend is smart.
Nodding to the map shoved into Potter’s front pocket, Draco says, “I’m sure you will.”
There’s the faint sound of stirring from Ron’s bed but it quickly turns back into snoring and Harry wastes even more time indulging in his impromptu company, watching Draco watch him and wishing he could see inside his head. “What are you thinking about?” Harry asks.
"Fuck,” he mutters. “Fuck, fuck.” He digs his fingers unconsciously into Malfoy's skin. He
Harry looks over his shoulder as Malfoy edges past Ron out of the kitchen, eyes dipping briefly,
Like that.
Since it's rather clear that Potter's not fucking off anytime soon, Draco creases the corner of his page and sets the book on his lap. "To be fair," he says, "I wouldn't trust you much either."
"Oh, I forced
Mid-rant, when the words
"I can't stand you," Blaise says to her sharply, to which Pansy rolls her eyes.
At that Harry rolls his eyes, but at Hermione, not Malfoy. Because yeah. He knows what he means.
I’d be happy to give you one if you’re that opposed to Potter of course."
Well!
“He’s your father, Draco,” she says. Her voice sounds high, strange. “We both want you here. He loves you and he’s missed you. That’s why he’s bothering you, darling. Humour him, won’t you?”
," he says, pushing Malfoy gently back up against the door again. "I said I'll take care of it."
“I do have her eyes,” he says, and tries not to gag thinking about it. “So it’s possible.”
Harry steps out of the Floo into Ron and Hermione’s house and brushes the ash off of the files he’s holding. He doesn’t actually know for sure Hermione’s home but he’d decided to try here just in case, since she can be rather testy while she’s fretting about at work and he doesn’t like to bother her. However, he’s not standing there two seconds before he hears crying from the other room and, resigning himself to Ron rather than Hermione, goes to the kitchen to find neither of his best mates but Draco Malfoy.
he'd decided on him. Because he would do exactly this, act grossed out and make fun of it and remind Harry how stupid the whole thing is, and how much it doesn't matter. Still doesn't explain why it feels unresolved.
is kind of a sledgehammer of a fucking statement.
Harry laughs, but there’s only a small measure of humour in it. He hasn’t spoken to anyone but Ron and Hermione about it, and they know more than enough to believe him. Malfoy doesn’t.
"Alright," Harry says. "Probably not hungry then. I'll be right back."
Harry thinks it's entirely likely Lucius lost a bit of his sanity in Azkaban but doesn't say so. He just nods, then asks, "What about your mum?"
“Shit,” Harry mutters to himself, and then he pushes off the wall and goes after him. Malfoy’s halfway across the entrance hall when Harry catches up and grabs his arm.
Blaise doesn’t like it when Pansy looks troubled. If Draco’s upset, it’s kind of whatever, he’s always been outrageously sensitive. But Pansy’s like him. Unflappable, and if she’s concerned, he probably should be, too. “Not sure,” Blaise says. He knocks back the rest of his drink. “He’s a flighty little thing, isn’t he?”
The library in Pansy's Provincial Château was well stocked with Muggle Literature. A surprise, since her parents are no more progressive than Draco's own, but also not really (hypocrisy has always been the vice of high society. Among other things). They weren't far from the Mediterranean Sea, and so much of the summer was spent at its shore, Draco reading aloud to Pansy until she got restless and kicked the book from his hands. Then she'd produce some whiskey taken from the cellars, and they'd get drunk enough to skinny dip and bored and lonely enough to snog. Draco would pull away, and Pansy would lament that if only they weren't both gay, they'd have a perfect fuck buddy setup.
The manor is bitterly lacking, as it's been the last five or six years. There are no house-elves to decorate. Narcissa, always in sour spirits around Christmas, refuses to contribute much more than a tree. And without his wand, there is nothing that he, Lucius, can do about it.
He's known Hermione long enough — and been through enough shit with her — to know when she's humouring him. And that's fine: she can believe he hates Malfoy if she wants. He'd keep arguing it but he doesn't actually know what he
Draco is as angular and sculpted as he looks, only softer. Soft under Harry’s lips, even at the jut of his jawline, and soft under the pads of Harry’s thumbs as they stroke the shallow dip of his spine.
At first Harry has no idea what he's babbling about, then the dilation of Malfoy's pupils and the returned rosy flush of his cheeks clues him in. He very much can't help smirking. "Take care of
As if it's news she's a pervert, like she hadn't been demanding thoroughly detailed accounts of his and Blaise's escapades with unabashed relish for
momentarily surprised to see Malfoy in his bed, soundly asleep and looking remarkably soft and vulnerable. Feeling slightly weird about it, Harry delays the inevitable for a minute and takes some time just to look at him like this, the duvet halfway down his torso and his white-blond hair splayed messily over one of Harry’s pillows. He’s very pretty. Too pretty to be as mean as he can be, or to have gone through what he has.
Draco says, “Help.”
and Harry couldn’t be thinking less about Ginny right now if he tried.
Draco tries his hardest not to, but it’s inevitable. He always goes a bit pouty when Pansy gets sharp with him. “It’s. Do you remember when I took the Mark?” he says, as if any of them could ever forget.
Draco watches his mother stand, the lines in her finely boned face that seem so much deeper than when he left her. “Of course I will, Mum.”
Inside the office, Pansy returns to the extravagant chair behind her desk and observes Draco with an arched brow.
Hermione rolls her eyes, but as she watches Harry tuck Rose’s little plush elephant back into her chest, she’s hit with a wave of sudden guilt. Sometimes it feels like literal months since they all left school, since she and Ron got married by the little inlet on her parents property in Australia, with George as his best man, and Harry as her maid of honour. Sometimes, it feels like it's just her and him, yelling at each other across the common room, and she forgets that though they're still young, they're also kind of not.
Hermione says, “C’mere,” beckoning Harry to stand so she can take Rose in her arms. “Sorry for yelling in front of you, darling. You too, Harry.”
"No," he says, and grabs Malfoy's robes from the floor as well. "Seriously, Malfoy, get these on, I don't need a fucking photo in the
Draco can see Potter looking at him, tilting his head like some deranged Crup in his periphery. He tsks through a breath of smoke. “The Wizarding world needs their messiah, you need the comfort of a neat little life.”
Harry mutters under his breath and kicks a nearby table leg. Which hurts.
"Draco, please," Harry laughs, cheeks going warm as he steps closer. "I was — you don't have to do that, I was joking. It's not quid-pro-quo. I wanted to do it for you."
at him.
So he waits outside for him on the back steps, in the dark and the cold while Molly gets dinner ready. And when there’s the crack of Apparition after he's been waiting an hour, and he sees Charlie appear out of thin air, Harry smiles at him wryly.
“You’re wearing a
"No, Ron," Harry says drily, "I'm not fucking Percy. Thanks." He despises the fact that Ron has just unknowingly referenced something he and Malfoy talked about in the lift. In fact he despises this whole situation, plus the dig about fucking a bunch of Weasleys. It's been two, which is literally less than thirty percent of them. "I don't know if it's necessarily
“I don’t know. Anytime I’ve seen Lucius properly angry he’s been different. He never yells, you know. It’s fucking terrifying. But when I said that to him, he was completely incensed. I kept thinking, like, maybe he yelled because he wasn’t
"Not that serious?" Harry echoes blankly. "You think I do this stuff with anyone I'm not serious about?"
“Thanks,” says Harry. He swallows thickly.  “You know, I spent a lot of time plotting out my first big decision. I think I’m going to end up winging it, though.”
Dad's out with Bill trying to find a trifle bowl at the last minute. Percy's reading over by the hearth, and he gives Charlie an awkward little hug and says he hopes he's well. George looks vaguely disappointed when he sees that Charlie's hair isn't wound about his neck, and Ginny hugs him properly and says, "Ron says Harry's a bit out of sorts. Be careful."
“And what about Ron and Hermione?” says Harry, lifting a brow. “Can you handle them?”
A small lump rises in Harry's throat and he feels a huge swell of affection for Draco, part of him wanting to laugh and the other to cry. "Your dad's a prick," says Harry. He moves some hair off Draco's forehead and thumbs over his cheekbone. "But he's still your dad, so I think you're allowed to miss him anyway. You used the word 'temporary' when you first told me — d'you think they'll get over it?"
? I didn't even give Ron those details, that was between
“Of course,” says Harry, grinning. “Your Muggle friends showed you, I guess?”
Thus began his confrontation of the tower, and this itself began with nightly visits, each time a step further into the curved parapet. The first few times he'd stood at the balustrade, Draco had seen shadows of silvery robes collapsed at the tower's foot, and had bile rise in his throat. That was about two weeks ago.
It's still Malfoy giving him shit, but it's not like it used to be. There's no venom — or less of it, at least — and Harry's able to appreciate his dry sarcasm.
“Sleeping,” says Harry. “I’m going down to breakfast.”
Lucius sneers, watching his son look anywhere but at him. Draco looks so much like himself, and his father Abraxas before him: the eyes, the jaw, the nose. But he’d inherited Narcissa’s emotional weaknesses, her penchant for disobedience when the situation doesn’t please her. It’s pitiful, embarrassing. Tragic, to be sure. Only one heir they’d made, and he’s a disgrace.
“— and hire a specialist to replicate them.”
going to fuck Malfoy in this broken lift, but he absolutely wants to see how far Malfoy is willing to go with it.
He says it revitalises him, and Harry doesn’t doubt that, and it’s better than his former habit of going out onto the balcony for a smoke after a shag, but he is rather sceptical about the part where he has to feed it to Draco like he’s the crown fucking prince of Wizarding Britain.
“S’alright,” Charlie says, kissing up Harry’s cheekbone and onto the shell of his ear before he rolls off him. “I’m good.” He’s hard as a fucking rock, he’ll definitely need a minute before he can get on a broom, but ultimately he wanted to make Harry feel good, and he’s done that. Plus, they really must be late for dinner by now.
“Alright?”
the hug, but won’t do it himself unless he’s been drinking or Charlie invites him to do it.
Harry snorts. “And how exactly d’you know I’m doing
Throwing his head back in a little groan, Draco says, "Fine. I'll tell you whatever you want to know, and then I would like another fucking."
sure this isn't a problem, Draco? It won't be any later than six, I promise."
fragile right now. I can assure you."
Draco knows he's in for a treat when Lucius sweeps into the study, robes billowing behind him like he's still a man of consequence and renown, striding through the Ministry atrium on his way to bribe another public official, and not some decrepit old bastard magically shackled to his own house for next seventeen years.
"You know, being up here, I miss taking Astronomy a bit," he says. The sky is cloudless tonight and choked with stars. "Wish I'd paid more attention. I couldn't name one constellation."
“Potter?” says Malfoy. “Potter Potter Potter. I just insulted you, didn’t you hear?”
“Proposing,” Ron chuckles, head down. “Merlin. Why the fuck would you think that?”
Draco almost pities Potter’s complete lack of self-awareness. He would, if he weren’t preoccupied with his very deliberate scornful ambivalence. “Please,” he says.
“Let’s go back then.”
He feels like the worst kind of stalker when he takes out the map to look for him Saturday night and finds him up on the Astronomy Tower again, then sneaks out of his dorm with half a plan and a nervous kind of anticipation making his stomach do somersaults. That he can deal with, though — at least the agony of indecision is finally gone.
Harry laughs, because
“Quite,” Draco says through another cough. For the last day or two, he’s been able to occupy his thoughts with the grim dilapidation of his childhood home and the man who occupies, enough so that Potter has been relegated to a mere resident of his subconscious. That is to say, he doesn’t want to talk about him. “Yes, she is.”
And Harry does move, torturously so, reveling in the clinging grip around his cock and the sight of his own spit smeared on its length. But no sooner than he pulls out and thrusts gratefully back in — once,
His stomach clenches horribly (anger, and other confusing things) when he finds him standing with a clipboard outside a room. Harry goes up to him, heart pumping, and he stays silent until Malfoy finishes what he's writing and looks up.
“Okay,” Harry says quietly, unnecessarily — he doesn’t think a negation would have made Draco leave at this point. He hesitates a few moments, looking at him, before finally — quite nervously, which is stupid — pulling out and curling up behind him in the small bed and draping an arm across his waist.
Heat rushes to Hermione's cheeks. "Oh, spare me, Harry. I thought we'd talked through this denial of the way you behaved in sixth year, and yes, I know, you were right about that in the end, but that doesn't mean it wasn't worrying watching you neglect literally everything else in your life to run around after Draco. You lose your head around him. Don't waste both of our time by denying it."
“Of course not,” says Pansy, “look at him, does he look like he shagged Potter an hour ago?”
Harry nods again, feeling a little sick. The idea that she would pick her slimy disgusting husband over her child is repulsive to him. "Well," Harry says, "I have a ... proposition. Bit of a crazy one, in light of your parents' attitudes."
and started asking questions, Harry’s already made a decision.
Messing up several times first, Harry finally gets the wand back in his pocket and, belly clenching hard again, he rubs his cock up against Malfoy’s arse, repeatedly lettig the head catch at the rim. He’s got no idea if he’s stretched out enough, if there’s enough lube, if it’s fucking stupid not to be using protection, but he doesn’t really fucking care at the moment. He wants to
Ron knows a lot about complicated histories. Of course, he never hated Hermione in the way Harry hated Malfoy, not ever, but a lot of the time he spent complaining about her or bitching at her was definitely all mixed up in really wanting to touch her hair. "So would you like, er." Ron doesn't think he can look at Harry when he says this. He doesn't think Harry would want him to. "Want Malfoy to be your boyfriend, or something?"
, to his arse before he disappears. Then he lifts them to meet Ron’s gaze and realises he’s seen.
Draco takes his tea, which is perfectly, hedonistically sugary, just as he’s always liked it. “I’ve a residency on the Spell Damage ward for the next six months. With Hermione Granger.”

“Point him out to me,” Malfoy says.
, you'd find out that this story
Draco flushes, because it really, truely hadn’t occurred to him, and it definitely should have. Too late now. He shakes his head. “No time for that. Too busy— what’s the colloquialism? Gagging for it?”
Draco puts the joint in his mouth but only pretends to inhale, then hands it back to Harry. “There’s only one you should know,” he says.
“Yes,” says Draco. He adjusts his sleeve. “I did.”
“My,” says Draco. “Mr—fuck,
Draco huffs and squirms around until Blaise gets the hint and slides off his lap. He knows his arse is an exceptional specimen, but he does get awfully sick of Pansy and Blaise fighting over it.

“It’s not like you’re any less hard for it,” says Draco. After a moment, he adds, “The lady doth protest too much.”
Klaus is a very different pet than Hedwig had been, and not just because he’s a cat. He’s friendly, is the thing. Warm and affectionate and follows Harry around the flat when he’s bored, purring and rubbing his ankles. Hedwig had been ... well, more like himself, really. Quite sarcastic, in her own avian way. He misses her still, but he likes to think she’d be glad he’s happier these days and not living with the Dursleys.
Harry bites his lip. “Might’ve.”
. I would be so, so pleased if the two of you were able to get along, you know that, but I worry that you're entering into this thing when there's still far too much hatred between you. Harry, it's unhealthy."
“First of all, Pansy,” Draco says, getting up from his chair so he can rant his way through this thing properly. “As there’s
.” And he really is trying to, but the foliage bordering the path is fast intertwining itself.
Draco nods fervently, eyes shut tight. “Yes. Yes, Harry.”
According to the Prophet, being a “wanton socialite” is just the next point on a long list of evils he’s committed (attempted headmaster-cide, being Marked, et cetera). Malfoy is “too effeminate”. Malfoy engages in “hideous debauchery”. Malfoy will do “anything/one to bring favour back to the family name”.
The sensation of Harry's hands tangled in his hair, directing him just slightly, makes Draco's cock perk up once more in his come-soaked trousers. Saliva gathering at the corners of his mouth, he takes Harry's length once, twice more before pulling off with a wet pop. "You can, if you want," Draco says, voice a little hoarse.
At that Harry laughs. "At the point it stops being coincidence, I suppose."
“I'm sure you can’t.”
“Mm,” Draco says. “It’s delicate spell work, so naturally it didn’t work when the poor sod tried to perform it on himself. But a few of my colleagues back at Saint Eloi think it could be a possibility. They’d need to develop a more complex variation on a Stasis and a Doubling before they could even begin tests, obviously.”
Draco looks at Harry for a second, then tilts his head in a slight nod. He crawls back across the bed, lets Potter push him against the mattress and put one of his big hands on his jaw.
“Don’t be vile,” says Draco. Now that he’s come, his head feels clearer. Not entirely, since Harry’s cock is still visibly a little hard in his jeans, but enough to think straight.
“Clearly you do give a shit,” Harry says loudly. He’s losing his grip on his temper, he can feel it happening. “Or you wouldn’t have made up whatever bullshit you told Hermione. You liked it, what I did in that lift, and you’re pissed off I saw you like that. Well get the fuck over it, Malfoy.” He takes a step forwards, hardly aware of another Healer walking towards them. “You would’ve let me do a lot more if we hadn’t stopped.”
Harry kissed Charlie first, when he'd been home for almost a year. It was New Years Eve, and Harry was drunk. Charlie was drunk too, but Harry was eighteen and Charlie was twenty-four, so he decided to be responsible.
"Extremely," he says. "Very very. Harry,
Ron tips his head back over the edge of the couch and groans. "I dunno. Christ, I've talked about Malfoy more in the last couple of weeks than I can fucking stand. Can't do it anymore."
Draco makes a sound of protest in the back of his throat, then says, "You only did it for the acclaim."
Draco hums. “Yes, Lucius.”
Harry grabs them from the floor next to the bed and drops them on the bed in front of Draco. After pulling his own on and a shirt, he says, “Am I still manufacturing coincidences then? Or are we going to start setting dates?”
Something about the way Malfoy’s looking at him makes Harry’s chest feel tight. But it’s the obviously-rhetorical question that really gets to him, because he realises suddenly that his suspicions weren't quite right. Malfoy didn't just want to shag him.
Other times (today is one of those times) he capitulates to the urge, knowing it's pointless to punish himself when he can't help it. And those times (today, now) he takes himself in hand and presses his face against his arm and pretends it's Malfoy's arse he's sliding into instead of his fist, and he remembers the way Malfoy sounded when he said 'please', and he fucks his hand the way he would've fucked Malfoy if he hadn't been such a cowardly prat in that lift, and he comes with a groan and imagines he's buried inside Malfoy, trapped against the wall, and for a blissful few moments he doesn't care about anything.
right now.
Fuck, thinks Harry. Fucking Cunting Shit. All capitalised. Because Fuck.
Harry takes it back, frowning. Ash falls off the end and lands near his foot. "Sorry?"
Harry blinks at her, then looks to his left and sees Ron doing the same. Their chess pieces begin shouting at them, but neither notice.
The Elves aren’t up at this hour (unlike the majority of eighth years in the common room, who are most definitely awake and high and hungry, and practically kicked Ron and Harry through the portrait hole to nick some food for them from the kitchens. Ron said, “Haven’t we done enough for you?” and then Seamus closed the door in his face), so they set about helping themselves.
Harry’s mouth twitches with a grin. “For what, exactly?”
"I prefer not to partake in such deviant behaviour," Draco says primly.
When the door closes behind him, Harry looks up at Hermione ambivalently from his chair, feeling a lot like he's fourteen and facing McGonagall.
“What, your wand, you mean?” Harry guesses. “Use mine before you leave. I told you, I’ll get it straightened out.”
"I get there was no one else," Ron mutters. Merlin, he hates when Hermione gets all ... vulnerable. He
Draco says, “Of course it is.”
. They're in a fucking lift. He uses his tongue to press globs of spit inside, fucking him with it steadily, until his cheeks and fingers are wet and he's so hard he genuinely believes his brain is in danger for how little blood it's receiving.
The thing is, Harry didn’t think he paid Malfoy’s outfits an awful lot of attention. More to that; any at all, but all of a sudden they flood his consciousness like photos from a catalogue. Malfoy perched at the bar in a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up, Mark displayed. Malfoy making Pansy Parkinson laugh so hard she drops the glass she’s cleaning in tight black jeans and low slung checkered trousers (it's happened more than once). Malfoy looking pointedly away from Harry as he enters with Ron and Hermione, in a tailored Muggle suit; pants and boxy jacket with no shirt underneath.
Rage fills Draco at such a blinding speed that he makes a sound right from the back of his throat, and his teeth click, and his bones clatter with it, and he hates Potter more now than he ever did when he was beaten to the Snitch, or cut open on the bathroom floor.
“Why would we?”
Harry settles beside Draco, who’s propped up on one elbow. He looks very nice in the fire-light (in every light) with blunt shadows the colour of melting and warmth moving over his sharp features. He’s wearing Muggle clothes, as he always does when he attends uni; grey woolen trousers and a loose white shirt unbuttoned to his deep clavicles and rolled up at the sleeves. The other students must think him awfully posh. Harry’s seen them on occasion, when he walks with Draco to the campus, in trainers and joggers etc. But then again, Draco is awfully posh.
It’s a neat little spell Hermione had taught him last year and he’d never really gotten to use — from where Harry's standing the animated branches look like snakes as they twist themselves into impenetrable knots, which is terrible actually, but they’re at least successful at blocking Malfoy’s path.
Too gone to speak with Potter’s coarse grip on his cock, Draco responds by pressing his one free hand into Harry’s lower back.
Poor Draco had always been the more emotional of the three of them.
Harry's guts clench with fury. All of this,
Granger's presence had made Draco literally jump under the cloak, and now, on the other side of the portrait hole, he tears it off and throws it at Potter.
Harry groans. He rolls his cock — hard again now — into the soft swell of Draco’s scantily clad arse. “Home,” he breathes. “We’re going home. I’m taking you home.”
“Why, thank you.” Draco had rather expected Potter to approach him. He’d been staring at the back of Draco’s head all lesson, which is unfortunate considering the state of his hair. He’d overslept, after yesterday.
Pansy pats Blaise’s head. “Then tell us the rest of this story and follow it with the Potter story. Look at poor Blaise, he’s perishing.”
“I asked you to pour me a glass of wine, Potter, not ferment the grapes,” he says, getting up and draping himself against the kitchen doorway. Legs crossed, hip out so a little midriff shows at the hem of his shirt. Draco knows what he’s doing, even if he doesn’t know why.
Charlie laughs and beckons Harry closer so he can put his arm around him. “I did think about staying for a year or two longer, because of you. I’m not sure I told you that. But I don’t think it would’ve been smart to keep occupying ourselves with something that wasn’t going anywhere.”
"Alright," says Hermione. "But he's still my friend. I'm not making any promises about him never being around here again, or whatever."
doing it, fuck absolutely everything and how much he hates Malfoy or how he's the most annoying git in the universe, because his lips have been taunting Harry all night and he's tipsy and hard and Ron and Hermione have a fucking kid and he, Harry, hasn't even slept with anyone in a quarter of a year and he kind of deserves this, whatever it is, a lapse into poor judgment he'll certainly pay for eventually ...
Harry sucks him back down with a chuckle, working another finger in beside the one already stroking at Draco’s prostate.
Which won’t do. “Gonna flip you over pet. Want to see you come again,” Harry says, pulling out, flipping warm-pliant-beautiful Draco over and thrusting back into his supine form.
Well that was suspiciously easy. He says "Okay" and looks around them, trying to gather himself enough to figure something out. Truthfully he's got no idea what he's doing, where this is going, or what he's going to do when they get there, but he at least wants a private place to give figuring it out a shot.
is different. There's zero chance of complication. It's impossible. I can't stand him."
evil, he knows that! I don’t hate him, I haven’t hated him since we were sixteen.”
"I wouldn't have put it like that, exactly," he says when he's stopped coughing. "But yeah." He pushes off the wall and tosses the joint at their feet, putting it out with his shoe. Then he looks at Malfoy, eyebrow raised, and says, "I do think you fancy me."
“Utter piss. Get the Malbec next to the fridge. And hurry.”
Ta, Blaise and Pansy. He’d only gotten his navel pierced as an ode to their friendship (Pans’ a black ring, Blaise’s gold) on one particularly drunken tromp through the night-time city.
Draco, who's been pulling his jumper over his head and struggling to find the hole, freezes with a mouthful of (very expensive, thanks) wool. "What?"
“You’ve always known how to flatter yourself, Malfoy,” Harry says, grinning still. He can see how white Malfoy’s knuckles have gone, can tell he’s gotten to him a little. And he’s impressed, really, that there hadn’t been more venom in the retort, but that doesn't mean there isn't still something childishly Malfoy about it. And yeah, maybe it irks him the tiniest bit, because damn. He didn't
"I know," Harry says tiredly, "I know, I know, I'm sorry, I didn't realise I'd be this late. Will you let me get my boots off, can I do that?"
It didn't go very far in making him feel better, but it was still nice to hear outside his own head.
sky now, loads of charms and enchantments protecting it and its occupants from the elements. There had been a decision made not to finish repairing it as some sort of tribute to the Battle of Hogwarts.
Charlie wasn't his first — he'd lost it to Ginny, about a week after the end of the war. And after they'd broken up only a few months in (a drawn-out affair, but they'd survived it), he'd slept with a few random people until Charlie came home and captivated Harry completely.
and, most unhelpfully,
Malfoy has dragged him into the hot, pulsing center (ew) of the dance floor. There are a lot of bare limbs, and it smells overpoweringly like alcohol and salt, sweat, man. And then there’s Malfoy, with his hands on Harry’s on his waist, and his back against Harry’s chest, and his arse, well. Harry’s already said.
In line with his recent endeavours, Draco’s been pretty transparent with Potter. Perhaps it’s a fallacy, since this whole conversation has most likely taken place in some bizarre, three-am wormhole that exists entirely separate from the reality where the two of them simply avoid each other, and smile tightly if forced to interact. However, Draco’s newfound moral strength has its limits. He’s not an idiot (unlike Fletchley, whom he’s frankly offended Potter would even ask about).
“What was it you told me about the research grant?” she says. “They decided the concept had some merit, didn’t they?”
Draco makes a bereft little noise when Potter pulls out of him, and shakes his head at the request to redress. The lift is moving, he can feel that even through the thick fog of needing that’s chattering in his bones, and he doesn’t care.
“It’s something,” she insists. “You’re worse now than when you finally managed to block a throw in Quidditch.”
wanted?” Harry repeats, shocked into a bark of laughter. Draco looks pouty, like a child. “You know you sound like Ron did fourth year. You can’t possibly think any of the attention I’ve gotten was worth it.”
It's been a weird week in which Harry doesn't think he's gone more than a few hours at a time without ruminating over the fight with Malfoy and everything leading up to it. A small part of him is still righteously indignant — he
Harry thinks it’s rather stupid. (“A waste of time, Hermione. You have to agree.”
“He does love his empty threats,” Pansy says to Draco as Blaise pulls ahead of them towards the entrance. “I could give him Hippogriff piss to sell, run him out of business, and he’d still demand I fuck him. He’s worse than you sometimes, Draco.”
"Coming," Draco manages, and then loses himself in bursts all over the two of them.
, right?” says Harry, teasing him and yet perfectly serious. “Right after it makes its rounds through the Hogwarts gossip mill.”
Harry takes a sip of his drink. “Was that sarcasm?”
that spikes when he sees Healer Spungen coming their way over Potter’s shoulder. This is what he hates, he hates it, and Pansy told him not to worry, that there’s nothing undignified or shameful about desire, that it was okay. But Draco’s always known that wanting leaves you vulnerable. If people know what you want, that you want them, their approval, then they can use it against you. Manipulate and control you. Draco doesn’t want to be controlled anymore.
your best mate’s sibling?”
The Weasel, who is eyeing the most recent addition to Granger’s (admittedly impressive) spread, says, “What is tepenade, even?”
After a few weeks, Charlie decided that he didn't particularly want to live at home again. He was in his mid-twenties. He also didn't particularly want to be too far away, since every few nights he'd wake up wanting to talk to his Mum. So he rented a flat in Ottery St Catchpole, something with one bedroom and a little kitchen and a Floo connection to the Burrow, above a millinery on the main street. It had a skylight above the bed, which was good, because Charlie really missed the sky.
“Is that what you think?” he says finally. Lucius gets up from his seat and moves before Draco. He bends, hovering over him, and grabs his chin to force his attention. “My father did what was required of him and so have I.” He grips harder, shakes him slightly. “Your disrespect won’t be tolerated in this house, Draco. Even now. Is that understood?”
Harry mouths softly at his collar bone, melting into the warm, sated taste. “My what?”
,” but then Pansy kicks him in the shin so he huffs and collapses into the chair opposite hers.
“Yeah, no.”
,” and brings his palms to the wall with a heavy thud.
gotten out of him. Suddenly he wants to make him say more things, make more noises. So as difficult as it is, he puts both hands on Malfoy's hips and stills them.
The four boys had sat on the floor, the bottle looming menacingly between them. Harry noticed and looked to Theodore with a sly smirk.
"I'm bi. I can't remember whether or not I told you that yet. But I am," Blaise refused to meet Draco's eyes.
"He can be difficult to buy for but go for something thoughtful and consider it and he'll love it."
Once they were settled, Blaise could not hold his tongue any longer.
you go into Zonko's? My competitor?! Would it have killed you to apparate to Diagon Alley? Blaise Zabini! If you're there I know you had a hand in this. My sweet, little Dracikins would never willingly betray me like this. He knows it would absolutely break my heart. The two of you are heartbreakers! Enemies! Traitors! Oh, Draco, I can't find your notes on that dungbomb spell. I was wondering if it would work as a physical product rather than just a counterspell. Love, George. Kisses!"
He hadn't noticed Blaise approaching him until a hand was waving in Draco's face. He blinked slowly pulling his thoughts out of the Harry spiral and onto Blaise.
"Surprise me."
"I thought that was just the manor," Draco interrupted.
It wasn't until a few days after the incident that Draco saw Harry again. He seemed to be holding himself carefully, afraid one wrong move would get him into trouble or ruin the progress he had made. Draco recognised it from the way he held himself when he was younger, though he doubted anyone else could even spot a difference. Theodore had informed him that the almost daily letters from Ron had stopped, and Harry's letter's had become little more than a page instead of the two or three they usually were. It was clear that Ron and Harry were tiptoeing around each other, not knowing the best way to approach the subject. Harry was curled up in the chair nearest to the fire. He was reading a book and carefully trying to take a sip from a mug using only the one hand.
All that had been going through his mind in the last few days of the war was Potter. He could've kissed him when he showed up at the manor. Harry Potter was alive. So he lied. Put his life in danger for the sake of keeping the spark of hope alive. He'd apologised in the Room of Requirement for the same reason, after Potter had returned the favour. It conveyed very regret Draco held, he was hoping it would begin to build the bridge to friendship.
"Quidditch practice has been rescheduled to fit in with the new captain's timetable. Besides, Hermione is perfectly capable of tutoring you," Ginny scoffed.
"Harry, you were supposed to be back two hours ago," she snapped once she finally detached herself from his mouth.
"I know this won't help but freaking out while drunk isn't good. I speak from experience when I say being drunk amplifies everything and twists it," he laughed bitterly. "You need to sit with this sober, B. Eventually, you'll need to talk to Theodore though."
A quick visit to Hogsmeade allows even more group bonding for the Inter-House eighth years. Followed by hateful glares and lost appetites.
"You don't have to be so kind to me you know."
It hadn't been a lot verbally but Draco could see Harry's fist clenching by his side. Ginny seemed proud of herself, clearly feeling her mission had been accomplished and exited with her head held high. It didn't take long until everyone had dispersed and it was just Draco and Harry left. Harry hadn't moved.
The rest of dinner passed fairly quickly. Draco could feel Ginny's glare from down the table. It seemed as though she was trying to burn a hole through his face. He tried to avoid glaring back as when he did she took her chance to aggressively make out with Harry. Being watch constantly made his appetite drop completely and he ended up only eating a small chicken roll instead of the roast dinner that had been prepared. Luna was a wonderful distraction but it wasn't enough to change Draco's appetite and he left dinner nearly as hungry as he'd been when it had started.
"Don't worry if you can't eat all of it," George smiled warmly. "Alex mentioned you'd only been eating light things."
As he packed a bag Draco realised he was in dire need of new muggle clothing, or at the very least less formal wizard clothing. Even his pyjamas seemed far too formal for Christmas with George. He rummaged around the back of his wardrobe and found a bag marked 'Sirius'. He wasn't aware there was a bag of his cousin's clothes, though he vaguely remembered Andromeda dropping off some clothes for Draco when he was young. His father had protested greatly and banished both Andromeda and the bag out of the house. His mother must have snuck it back in.
"Wow, full offence, you look shit. When's the last time you showered?" George sighed, pushing through the mound of letters that had built up.
Draco sat in silence after Harry had left. He was the third person Draco had come out to, only Pansy and Blaise knew. Though he suspect Hermione might have figured it out herself. He felt almost lighter after telling Harry. It was another step towards being just Draco instead of Draco
He waited for a while, biding his time until the very last name. Hermione hand delivered the small slip of paper personally, it was obvious by the mischief in her eyes that she knew exactly who it was before handing it over.
"I've been informed that this is your favourite," George smiled, taking his seat opposite Draco. "I see Harry's things fit. Good, I didn't think you'd fit into mine and it was too late to get anything from one of your friends."
"Wonderful to see you're in a better mood," Draco laughed picking up a few chocolate frogs.
He could've taken them up on their offers. He knew he could still turn up outside their bedroom window at 3 am on Christmas Eve and they would welcome him in. Harry had been wrong. Draco cared for others deeply. He cared for his friends and his mother.
"I'm not surprised. Bed time for you I think."
Firstly, hello to everyone still reading this.
"You'll always have a place here, but you'll never know unless you go out and get your qualifications."
Draco had been attempting to curl as far into the corner of the booth as possible. Though he could still see the side of Harry's face before he turned to him fully, curiosity taking over. Hermione was still smiling warmly at him, Neville looked interest in whatever he was going to say. Blaise on the other hand still had his standard smirk. Draco decided there was no escaping the question. He was silent for a few moments. He'd only told George and Hermione exactly what he wanted to do. He hadn't even told his mother, despite visiting her portrait often.
Deans jaw dropped as Seamus laughed almost uncontrollably. It was obvious that he was the most drunk. He quickly stripped, holding his hand out for Dean's underwear. His boyfriend chuckled, shook his head and retreated to the dorm to grab a clean pair. When he returned Seamus carefully positioned them on his head before sprinting out into the halls. Everyone rushed to follow him. He was running madly, yelling and screaming. He wasn't worrying about anyone catching him. Once he returned he stumbled into Dean's arms, unable to hold himself up.
Neville had immediately raced off to find Luna once they reached the entrance to Hogwarts to show her the new books. The other four all headed straight back to the Inter House common room. Unfortunately, Ginny was leaning against one of the windows. Once she spotted Harry approaching she met him halfway and snogged him senseless. Blaise fake gagged and received a middle finger from Ginny for his efforts.
"If you're taking his side right now maybe it's best for you to have some time to reconsider."
"I just meant the self you were when you were around Pans, T and I. I've missed him."
"Which is?"
"Hmm?"
"What? I thought it might be nice for you to listen to some Muggle literature. Plus, Hermione's mentioned she's trying to get you to read this for months."
Draco wiped his eyes, too afraid of his voice breaking if he tried to answer verbally. He listened as the footsteps retreated before coughing wetly. He dressed in the clothes George had picked out - jeans and a t-shirt - which were far less formal than Draco's standard wizard robes. Draco didn't even think he'd owned any muggle clothing, his father would have been furious. He wasn't there for Draco to impress, no-one was. He roughly towel-dried his hair. Looking into the mirror Draco saw his natural curls that his father had tried to hide for years. The Black curls. He looked like his mother. For the first time in his life, Draco willingly left out his straightening spell, instead choosing to run his fingers through to detangle it. He was keeping this part of him, the part of his appearance that his mother had given him.
I am terrible, this has been sitting in my notebook for a couple of months, finished. I thought I'd published it, apparently not.
"Would you look at that? The boy has brains after all."
Draco on the other hand was terrified. He'd considered Harry a friend but Harry had also been avoiding him since the night in front of the fire. Draco's plan was to hand the gift over and run away before Harry could open it. He was terrified that Harry wouldn't like it. He was also afraid at the implications the gift would hold if Harry liked it and started to look for a deeper meaning behind it. One that he would inevitably find. Harry could be oblivious but he wasn't stupid.
"You know what? I don't think I do," Harry pulled away from Ginny. "We're done."
"But," Draco smirked. "I didn't take you as a reader."
Ginny was sat at the eighth year's table, doting on Harry. Blaise and Theodore both fake gagged at the sight, laughing together before Blaise buckled and rushed over to where Pansy was sat with Susan. Hermione gently pulled Theodore towards Neville and sat him down, trying to distract him from the way Blaise was acting. It seemed as though no-one wanted to be an audience to Harry and Ginny. Harry met his eyes, a pained expression on his face. Draco was looking for an escape when he spotted Luna. He tried to send an apologetic smile to Harry, but Draco had a feeling Harry knew he was not sorry at all.
"Truth or dare?"
The war had taken its toll on everybody. It affected everyone differently. Two out of three of the Golden Trio return for their eighth year. One very blonde, very familiar ex-Death Eater also returns. They all have their own troubles and difficulties fitting in, finding where they belong in this new Hogwarts. And of course all Eighth years share one dormitory, not many of them came back after all, not many were alive to come back. As they're all confined in such close quarters new secrets come to light and students find things out about each other that they never knew, or even considered, before.
The aurors had come for Lucious, but they came for Draco too. They tried to drag him away from his mother. He started kicking and screaming, dragging his feet against the ground. They'd stopped, allowed him to go and he ran straight back to his mother's corpse. He couldn't just leave it, she'd never get the send of she deserved if he did.
"Petrificus totalus!"
"What about you Draco?" Neville turned to him.
"Big words."
"Hit me with a dare," Seamus slurred.
"I have the money, Dray. What's so wrong about wanting to treat my friends?"
"I didn't realise it meant that much to you."
Harry couldn't hold it in that time, neither could Hermione. Their laughter was the backing to Draco's dramatic exit. It made Draco feel good, he felt lighter after that outburst. Blaise had caught up to him, carrying two plates full of food. The two headed to their common room in silence, though Blaise laughed a few times.
"I can't tell you how to feel, Harry. I know that this is very conflicting for you. Hermione is going to be absolutely unbearable until Winter exams are over. Ron's her brother so I don't know how much of a help he'll be to you. But...I'm here. You can talk to me if you need to."

Yes. Fuck, yes, this is better. He can see Draco’s eyes, glazed and rolling, and the wonderfully slack sculpt of his lips, and the deep, high flush of his cheekbones.

"That's what Pans told me," Blaise says, and slings an arm around her. Draco takes a moment to loathe them both entirely before he speaks again.

”Well. You can take the speccy git out of Gryffindor, et cetera,” he says. Weasley must’ve been scolded good and proper, because he says nothing but “ha ha,” and lets Draco pass back into the dining room. Granger is there, holding a bundle of soft blue blankets with moving stars on them.
“Bullshit!” Harry says, at the same time as Hermione does one of her most indignant huffs.
"I think you're wrong that he's fragile," says Hermione, "but I can agree to disagree about it. However, I do think you're right that it's not very helpful for them to see one another, and that it would be beneficial if we both did our part to make sure they don't cross paths." She sighs and takes a very small sip of the cognac. It burns on the way down, not unpleasantly. "I realise how ... juvenile it sounds, keeping them apart like children. But they're rather juvenile around each other, and I don't like the way their relationship affects either of them. Maybe it's what they need. I absolutely will not agree to stop seeing Draco myself, though."
Potter’s Warming Charm is beginning to dull around the edges, fingers of cold creeping back in. Draco wraps his bare arms around himself and shrugs. “I don’t know,” he says, rather stupidly. “I suppose I want to talk to you. I want us to talk and fuck and read together. I want to be able to reach across and touch you whenever I want, like it’s nothing.”
George bursts into laughter and kicks him lightly in the ribs. "Yeah, you're not kidding." His smile softens a little and he lets out a sigh. "Woulda gone for Freddie first if he was around. He was always the looker. Of course, I was the brains."

“I read. You should try it,” Draco says. Then looks far too pleased with himself and adds, “once you learn how.”

“Spent seven years of my young life learning from the best. Ta, Harry Potter,” he says, and clinks his wine glass against Potter’s beer with more force than strictly necessary, and watches as some of the frothy amber liquid sloshes over the lip and in rivulets down his hand.

Draco gets up from his chair when Lucius slaps him, and leaves not because he was told to but because he doesn't want his father to see his eyes smarting.
Draco knows what she means, but he says, "The only feelings I have for Blaise are vexation and arousal. Often at the same time. Very occasionally platonic affection."
Hermione opens the door and shuts it behind her when she's inside, reluctantly impressed by the figure Pansy strikes in front of the fireplace. She is chic in a way Hermione doesn't think she could ever quite achieve, even if she had the desire to.

Pansy raps her nails against her snifter, picturing Draco's piqued, glassy-eyed face as he left The Rooftop two evenings ago. His Floo's been blocked since.

Harry had managed to avoid Draco for the most part, up until then.
“And what’s that supposed to mean?”
“Sure, me either,” Harry says, rolling his eyes. He sits up a little on his elbow and looks down at Draco, bathed in shimmery, water-filtered moonlight. “Come on. You haven’t even talked to your friends about it, have you.”
“Right,” says Harry. Apparently Malfoy is incredibly frustrating even when it’s not a battle of wills between them. It's like he wants it to be awkward, and if so, he's doing a fantastic job. Harry had explicitly offered to stay with him the whole time, but he's suddenly all too willing to dip out early now that Rose is asleep as long as it means an end to this torture. “Well it’s almost five ... is there anything else you need help with? I might actually go see Ron if you think you can handle the last hour here.”
was up, but not what. Anyway, I told you you’d have to deal with her eventually.”
It's a little after ten PM when he Apparates to St Mungo's. He knows Hermione's home and he's relatively sure Malfoy's working.
“Adequate,” Draco says. “Where’s my book?”
"It doesn't have to not go anywhere," Harry says bluntly, looking over at him. "And I was never just occupying myself. I had feelings for you."
"You came with Draco and the others?" Hermione says to Pansy, which,
Harry swallows, looking up at him. “Yeah,” he says. “I do. Love you. I want you to come live with me.”
They kiss; hot and inelegant exchanges of breath, Harry bites and Draco nips, delicate skin rolled between teeth and tongues slipping to lap at collar bones and low, throaty groans running over breathless whines.
“Did you—did you
Ron thunks his head against the kitchen cupboard. “Bloody hell, Harry.”
you that, per se," Parvati says in what could almost be called a drawl, which makes Harry frown, "I was only referring to the title in the abstract."
“No you didn’t,” Harry says quietly, but with perfect confidence. No part of him believes it would have worked. “I did it once.”
Harry lifts an eyebrow. “Then what did you mean?”
Harry can see the faint flush on Draco’s cheeks (it’s always a light shade of pink with him, never beet red like Ron) and knows exactly what he’s thinking. And that makes Harry’s cheeks warm too. Truthfully he’d had just hanging out in mind, but. There’s also that.
"Okay." Draco sits back. "What am I thinking right now?"
"I'm a person, Malfoy," he says. "You talk to me like a normal fucking person."
Harry tickles the pear and thinks while he waits for it to turn into a knob. “Is it scandalous?”
At that Blaise pulls back, frowning at him.
Everyone was very drunk, and Ron and Hermione were right. Malfoy was a lot of fun. He came over to Harry and said, “You’re here.”
“harder, deeper, more, Harry
For a two-word sentence it riddles Harry with a lot of emotion. He stares at Malfoy for a long few seconds, taking him in from his familiar white-blond hair to the sharp nose and the no-longer sneering mouth, and it feels distinctly like it’s the first time he’s actually looking at him.
“We’ll probably fight. A lot.”
“Fuck off,” Harry mutters.
"Hello," she says to the receptionist, "Hermione Granger, Pansy should be expecting me."
'It’s time to settle down, Draco. You’ll need to produce an heir before you’re thirty, Draco.'
“How merry,” Draco says. He sips his tea, and wonders what Potter was going to say about his ex. He knows of her, of course. The papers in France didn’t print stories about the British Saviour very often, but they took a fleeting interest in his most recent relationship because the girlfriend had been a Beauxbatons graduate. He doesn’t know anything more. He’ll ask Blaise to have a sniff around, perhaps. He won’t ask as many questions as Pansy would.
He pulls back like he’s been stung by the wand, which he’s not so sure he hasn’t. He looks from it to Draco, surprised, disgusted, resentful. After a moment of silence, he slaps Draco across the cheek. Not hard. Enough to sting, the way the jinxes used to when he acted up.
“What?”
As winter folds itself over the castle, the forest and its heavy, sheltered canopy become an increasingly enticing alternative to the tower, directly in the wind’s teeth. (The forest, unlike the water by Dumbledore’s grave, and the tower where he fell, is quite untainted, for Draco. There was the time he saw hybrid-Quirrell sucking the blood from a unicorn, but it’s rather paled in comparison to everything that’s happened since.)
“I want to see this, Hermione,” he complains.
what happened. I had no intention of shagging Potter, I assure you. It's just that it got quite stuffy in the lift. What with it being stalled. Potter took off his robes and I happened to, you know, observe that he was. Excited by my presence. Once again."
Perhaps, when Potter had said fancy, he meant: I think you want to shag me. And that was true. But there was other stuff, as well.
?" Harry says defensively. His head is spinning, to be fucking frank: what world, he wonders, is Malfoy living in where he finds the bollocks to go behind his back to his own best friend? "What the hell did he tell you?"
"Potter," Draco says. He should've known a whole week couldn't pass without his peace being intruded upon by twerpy golden boys and their twerpy fucking ways.
Draco clears his throat again. “I made my choices. Dumbledore couldn’t have helped.”
Slipping his satchel over his shoulder, Draco says, “No.”
“Two sugars.”
“Do you think we’ve got enough?” Ron asks when he emerges.
“Rosie? Do you want a hold? She’s very placid right now.”
“Harry,” says Ron gravely, pulling Harry back to stare at him in earnest. “Don’t push my foncey in a lake.”
“No I don’t,” Harry says. Draco’s ankle is very close to his foot. He bridges the distance cautiously.
It's a strange thing to say and it makes Harry frown.
Harry isn’t sure how he feels about this. Surely, if he really didn’t want to speak to Malfoy, he would’ve gapped the fuck out by now. He’s had ample time.
He won’t have Potter lusting for Percy The Eunuch Weasley over him, even in jest.
Well that rankles. The least Wealsey could do is get his facts straight — it’s the
He doesn’t really believe Malfoy’s an idiot, so his conclusion is that he’s doing this just to be a prat.
Draco looks vaguely amused at Harry's pique, then pushes himself up from the ground. “Rather peckish” he says. And then, while turning for the door on shaky legs, “Do you have any digestives? Chocolate covered ones?”
When Potter rounds the corner, Draco feels a little twinge of satisfaction that always comes with being right. Like, he’d somehow suspected Harry might appear. And he has. Draco’s definitely not glad to see him.
Charlie smirks back at him, cause he know it'll make Ron dirty. "I think you'll find that everything's still in perfect working order."
Pansy lifts a smug grin to Draco as he rises from his chair the same way he’s always done when he’s building steam. She decides not to point out the sheer number of times he’s done exactly this to her whilst ranting about the Pleb Who Lived.
"What's so bad about it?" he asks, a tad defensively. "It's not like I'm trying to date him or anything, I just wanna finish what we started. He was so ..." God.
There’s something almost painfully raw about it when Draco starts coming, and the vague ‘wait’ that he chokes out makes it seem almost like he’d been taken by surprise. It’s the hottest fucking thing he’s ever seen and it’s with Draco still pulsing and clenching and twitching around him that Harry closes his eyes and hits his own climax. His hand spasmodically grips and loosens on Draco’s neck the whole time, his hips pumping faster and harder and then slower as he reaches some shivering conclusion. “Fuck,” he croaks. When he takes his hand off Malfoy’s neck, he finds the joints in his fingers are sore. “You okay?”
was that?”
. Idiot.”
about Voldemort surviving, even as a memory.
Shit.
“Fuck off,” Draco says, and with much less bite than he meant it. He’s sure he looks a sight, and his flies are still undone, and he’s probably going to have to take the lift down to the nice, cool file room and sit in there for at least an hour until he’ll be fit to treat any patients. “I get off at twelve. AM. By which time I shall’ve reached triple digits on the list of the reasons why this is the most idiotic thing I’ve ever done. Excuse me.”
Harry lifts an eyebrow. "About?"
“Bully for you. Simply speaks to my earlier point.”
"Pansy. Who else?" Draco remembers her fumbling enthusiasm, the two of them drunk and pawing at each other. He'd lasted hardly five minutes, and she'd laughed and finished herself off in his bed. Afterwards, she'd said, 'I think I'm a lesbian', and Draco said yeah, me too. "And it was third year. Just."
"Yeah, of course," Parvati laughs. She flips her long hair over her shoulder in a graceful motion and rolls her eyes. "They're itching to fire you, Harry. How inconvenient it must be for the Ministry to employ the Chosen One."
Draco’s hand is moving before he realises it — he couldn’t stop it if he wanted to, which is good, because he doesn’t — towards Potter’s cheekbone, and if he’s lucky his wrist holster will gash open that tragic fucking scar on the follow through.
“I think the two of you should know,” says Hermione, returning from upstairs where she’d put Rose down, “that I invited Draco over for dinner and he'll be here any minute.”
. That was the fucking point of putting our robes back on, you complete twat."
As usual, mention of Nat makes Harry’s gut twist painfully. And it’s not just her, not just their completely failed relationship: it’s uncomfortable, hearing Hermione talk about him like this, like he’s fragile or something. Even worse because she and Ron are so ... stupidly
“Nothing,” Harry says, and then sternly to his cock; don’t get hard again, you fuck.
to do this nicely. He had.
“Fair enough,” Harry allows grudgingly. “At least he’s not here anymore, I s’pose.” He goes over to Draco again and pulls him in by the waist, going for his neck rather than his mouth. The bruises, he thinks, are probably yellowing now underneath the Glamour and with that jealousy burning in his gut he’s glad to know they’re there. “Would it be too much to hope he was terrible at it?”
Harry goes even redder and rolls his eyes. "I wouldn't call it recreational quite yet seeing as I've only done it once," he says sardonically. "And I'm not really used to ... I dunno, talking about it? I didn't really spend a lot of time thinking about sex the past few years. How old were you your first time?"
“Neville,” Harry says loudly even as he slumps a little in his chair. “What’d you bring?”
“I meant, why are you talking to me?”
Harry snorts. “Right,” he says, “and you’re sure it’s not just her you found intolerable?”
"Good, what did I tell you?" Pansy says happily. "Come, Draco, I'll Apparate us there." She stands and holds a hand out to him.
"Is that a euphemism?" says Draco.
The clipped tone makes Harry tense. A hand goes to the back of his neck and he watches Charlie's face, trying to examine his expressions in the weak light of the town's glow.
“Mm,” Harry says. When Draco gets nippy after a fuck, it means he’s sentient enough to be pampered.
.” Draco’s got his stern voice on. Harry likes it, because he likes watching Draco’s cranky resolve slowly crumble under his touch.
Dominique comes in with their tea, preens under Pansy’s praise, and then wishes her a good night  while deliberately ignoring Draco.
“Jesus fucking christ,” Harry moans into Draco’s forehead, gripping his hips tighter still.
’. That’s Malfoy.
Harry's always liked being in control of things; he's a good leader, he's
“It’s rude,” Draco says, nipping Potter’s lip the way he’d liked so much last time, “to assume you’ll be doing the fucking.”
“How do you know about the tent?” Harry says suddenly, with incredulous realisation.
Draco, but he consciously hasn’t dug too deep.
This is best: Hermione is usually less perceptive when she’s had a couple hits and seeing as he hasn’t told her (or Ron, or anyone) about what happened between himself and Malfoy the other night, that’s a blessing. Because he doesn’t feel like talking about it. Wallowing is much preferable currently.
The longer he's thought about it, the angrier he's become. Telling Parkinson was shitty enough on its own, but to have given Hermione,
Mother has always been stubborn in her blindness to Lucius' flaws. Some would see it as admirable, probably, but it makes Draco sad. He hates to see her being so weak, when he knows she doesn't have to be. "How kind of you," he says cooly.
“So good,” Harry says, collecting the remnants of Draco’s spunk from his lips with his tongue. “So good for me pet.”
That is to say, Draco was thinking about Potter when he’d walked into the lift.
.” He wiggles his arse around impatiently.

There's an indecently immature part of Pansy that revels in Granger's annoyance. Wants to keep pushing until she storms out of the office in a huff. But. Alas. She meant to do this for Draco, not herself. "Listen, Hermione," she says. "The thing about Draco is that he can be very reticent, when he pleases. He
useless, though." She hesitates, still stroking his hair, debating asking the question she wants to ask. "Do you have feelings for him?"
"You'd be completely horrified to know how obvious you are," Harry tells him as he pulls a pair of pants on to sleep in. "You've missed me lately. I can tell."
, and at this point all Harry can smell is Malfoy's cologne because it's successfully filled the entirety of the small space.
, Ron. I would never put Rose in harm’s way, ever. Do you really think I would risk her wellbeing just to prove a point?"
Clearly, Potter is no exception.
, I'm
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, Potter,” Draco says, and sucks in a mouthful of smoke, and flicks the empty paper end thing off the tower without looking down.
Draco feels his ribs tighten, at that. He says, "When did you become such a conversationalist?"
Harry briefly flirts with idea of toying with him but quickly decides not to. There’s nothing he wants more right now than to watch Draco come all over himself and Harry’s hand, so he spits in his palm and redoubles his efforts, sucking hard on the skin of Draco’s throat that’s so easily-bruisable. “Are you gonna come for me?” he says just beneath his ear.
There are certain places in the castle Harry likes to avoid. At first it had been the Great Hall, but he’d overcome that one pretty quickly seeing as he needed to eat. The corridor near the Room of Requirement is one. The Forbidden Forest another. And Dumbledore’s tomb.
“Have you considered a career in literary analysis?” Draco says. “You know, if the whole Auror thing goes tits.”
“Never mind.”
Draco’s snippy tone only makes Hermione smile and she pats his cheek affectionately, just to see him pout. It’s endearingly different than that sneer he wore around Hogwarts.
"Not all of it," Draco smirks. "There's some on your jeans."
lover. Et cetera awaits.”
“Would be hypocritical of her,” Draco explains.
Harry has another thought when they’re closing the door behind them. “Your hair’s a box dye,” he says. “You’re really a blonde.”
Well, shit. Harry blinks at him, feeling that not much could have shocked him more than what Malfoy’s just said. His heart has gone all achey and he’s overcome suddenly with a desire to go over there and hug him because he looks cold and the Warming Charm is starting to fade. And, simultaneously, he feels scared. Nervous. For a lot of reasons, but mainly that he’s only ever been one person’s boyfriend before and he’d known that person well since he was eleven. Malfoy is utterly uncharted territory.
Moving his hand slowly over Draco’s cock, he huffs out a laugh against his neck and says, “Sure you did. And what the fuck does the book have to do with anything?”
The second time they spoke was in Potions, when Harry said, “How do you get your Shrivelfig so finely chopped?” and Malfoy said, “Use a sharper knife.”
Harry scoffs, then laughs.
"What," says Draco, eyes narrowed and ready to be vexed.
"So are you, Potter."
“Not unless someone fixes my eyes,” says Harry. “Giving you one last try.”
“You’re hard?”
"Doubtful. We'll see, don't close your eyes."
ginger. Studies dragons in Romania. You can tell him all about your namesake, he'll love it."
“I’m otherwise occupied,” says Draco.
Curious. Hm. Draco draws back the sleeve of his cashmere jumper, dropping his eyes to Potter’s hand on the log while he holds out his wrist.
Draco's always thought, from their few previous interactions, that Blewitt was criminally friendly. To still be so after they've both been on for almost twenty-four hours is literally just offensive. "Did you need me, Healer Blewitt?"
“Don’t be fucking contrary,” Draco murmurs, as Potter thwarts his third attempt to deepen the kiss.
it is, having to share Charlie with the whole family. “Definitely. Erm — I’ll be. Yeah. Out here.” He takes a joint from behind his ear. “Don’t take too long.”
"Potter's over there," Pansy says when they walk into the pub, and sounds so happy about it that Draco wants to hex her. And Granger. Actually, he thinks he'd rather prefer strangling her with that bushel she calls a ponytail. It'd be more cathartic.
Ron looks up from his chess set. He’s playing against himself, which Harry doesn’t really understand, but whatever. He says, “Funnily enough, I don’t.”
“Yeah,” Harry laughs weakly. “Right.” He has to pause a moment, completely overwhelmed by how fucking unbelievable it feels and afraid if he goes too fast he’ll come before he has a chance to enjoy it. Once he’s regained himself he sinks the rest of the way inside, grinding into him when he’s flush against his arse. The grip is fucking unbelievable.
He’s literally walked, stone cold, to his own death, he reminds himself. If he can do that and not this, there's something wrong with him.
"Will you relax, darling?" Pansy says, and delivers a neat little Stinging Hex to Draco's knuckles so he curses and releases her. "I just want a quick chat. It's been an awfully long time since I've caught up with any of the old crowd."
home!”
"That's okay," Hermione says. "Sorry for calling you Ronald."
—so Harry splays one hand over the graceful dip of his spine, arcing and vaulting as he fucks himself back onto Harry’s cock, and gives it to him with graceless abandon.
Draco’s not really paying attention, too busy wrinkling his nose in disgust as Harry has the utter gall to pour red wine into his crystal flute.
"He is," says Pansy. "Prehistoric, Draco."
Draco feels good. Feels silky. Like silk.
“I do,” Harry insists.
Harry can only roll his eyes, but he does unhand him. “What the fuck is this, Shakespeare? Look, all I meant was that … I mean, you said not to involve you in my ‘gay crisis,’ right? So does that mean it’s a one-time thing or does that mean fuck off until I know if I like you back?”
“Voltaire,” Harry said, reading from the book cover.
Ron finally takes a pause at that and Harry’s relieved to see it. He can tell Hermione’s becoming genuinely upset and he really dislikes having to step in and talk Ron down.
“I can’t believe she didn’t notice you staring at his arse,” Ron says when she’s out of earshot. Harry flings the towel at him.
With reality sinking in about what’s just happened, Harry tucks himself away and does up his jeans, face warm. There’s come on Malfoy’s lip. He tilts his head back against the wall and looks at the ceiling and tries to process.
Draco makes a petulant noise, but obliges. “The sky for the stars, Harry. Obviously.”
"What've I done?"
"See you, Malfoy," he says.
“Gladly,” Harry says. “As soon as you start talking.” Draco buries his head further into his outstretched arm and whimpers.
Dominique nods, shuts the door with a soft click. It’s childish, perhaps, making Granger wait. But Pansy’s always been a touch the antagonist. She simply can’t resist.
“This open Pinot alright?”
thing, you know. And you can’t stereotype people like that. Maybe he’s a Slytherin!”
Harry scoffs. His stomach is in, like, fifty knots but he’s trying
Draco is holding himself open, squirming and whining, so Harry can fuck him open with his tongue. Through his knickers. Over a desk.
complicated, because he's made it very clear he wants to move on from this and never see Malfoy again if possible, which is fairly straightforward. Only as he'd told Charlie, he literally cannot stop thinking about him. And it's driving him a bit fucking mad.
“Mmph,” says Draco. “Turn around.”
Blaise huffs out a sigh against Draco's ribs and sits up, still straddling him. If he had even a sickle for every time Draco wouldn't let the subject of Potter drop.
"We haven't 'entered into a sexual relationship,' Hermione," he says loudly. Christ, is she
"No way," he says firmly, pulling his fingers out. It would be so easy. God, it would be
Cheeks warm, Harry repeats, “I talked to Kingsley. McGonagall let me use the Floo in her office.”
Harry laughs, oddly relieved. He still doesn’t think he’s going to do anything about it — he’d meant it when he told Charlie he wasn’t going to chase anyone anymore, including Malfoy. But it’s nice to have someone’s blessing.
Um. “‘Course mate,” Harry says.
Draco snorts. "You're cute," he says.
“Why not? You were bloody voluntary with several details you had to have known would scar me for life the other day.”
“You’re right,” Draco says, arching into Harry’s fist. “You’re also a hypocrite.”
They find Blaise already at the designated Apparition point outside the club and together turn on the spot, disappearing and reappearing about a block down from the restaurant Blaise had suggested.
force you to do anything, you made that decision all on your own. Nor did I ever say I’d
Harrys leans in and kisses him, a hand on his jaw. He’s starting to taste familiar. “I, erm — I had a lot of leverage,” he says. “I’m gonna do the Auror training program after all.”
Draco stops beside it, the dance floor stretched out before them and the L-shaped bar curved around beside. In the dusky, deserted corner, air smelling like night and summer blowing in through the arch, Harry feels a little less like he’s drowning in sound and smell and feel, and a little more like he could form a coherent sentence if he tried hard enough.
Draco exhales through his teeth. “How long is a piece of string,” he says. Pale clouds shift and Harry looks exhausted in the moon’s full light. He turns his eyes back to the castle’s silhouette, the skeleton of the ruined Hall.
Harry takes Draco’s cock in hand — a quick stroke, “come, pet,” and Draco makes a tragic little sound and releases over his stomach, and his ribs, and his very expensive rug. Which now smells like wine-and-sex too and Harry thinks it’s a definite improvement.
Well. That gets the freckly berk to stop laughing alright.
Harry wonders when he became such a deviant. Then he laces his fingers over Draco’s, and tongues determinately at his rim.
When he walks out onto the Astronomy Tower and sees Malfoy standing near one of the balustrades, Harry swears under his breath. It's half two in the morning and he'd been absolutely
She gives Harry a stern look and says to Terry, “Would you mind popping out for a second? I need a quick chat with Harry.”
“Do it. Harry, do it.”
When he feels Charlie hard against his hip, Harry thinks
taste it, it’s phenomenal. Blaise was kind enough to let me do the trial run here.”
Harry thinks Draco’s intelligence is sexy as hell.
Draco says nothing but gives a short, dry laugh, and continues studiously avoiding Harry’s eye.
“I’m surprised he can see you over my coif,” Malfoy says.
“Spit it out,” says Ron.
“I could listen to you waxing philosophical all night long, you know.”
Draco already knows that. Draco doesn't
. Harry decides not to use that word out loud. "Plus, I sort of ..." He shrugs as best he can while holding Rose. Grimaces. "I ran out on him a bit. He was pretty upset. I feel kind of shit about it."
“Fuck you. Fuck you, you’re so,” Close. Harry’s lips are red, cheeks flushed with alcohol. He’s so close, so earnest, so determined to push and pry. And he’s so
Harry indulges him only slightly, teasing him with small, lingering pecks and a hand on Draco's cheek, never letting it develop further. He wants to hear Draco panting again.
), he does his most put upon sigh and brandishes his wand.
Malfoy opens his eyes and grins up at Harry. “What a lovely metaphor. I’m going to steal that. And for all your complaining, Potter, your cock is awfully hard.”
“Mother is fine,” Draco says. Sad is what he’d told Pansy. Lonely. “She’s taken to gardening.”
Harry pulls his hand away and lifts an eyebrow at him. "I'm not doing this here."
Ron refrains from saying '
"Shall I take you home, darling?" Pansy says. Practically
Harry squeezes harder and uses it as leverage to fuck him harder too, and he feels so vital, so
“You brought
“I know Draco very well,” says Pansy. It’s a sharp turn away from any kind of subtly. “Of course, he’s gifted at what he does. He’s always been the smartest of us all.”
Harry doesn’t have time to agree (scathingly) before Hermione’s opening the door and Malfoy’s walking inside holding something, probably food, but Harry’s too busy glaring at his immediately-infuriating, unnaturally symmetrical, pointy git face.
He stands and goes to him and puts his arms around Charlie, fingers pressed into his back, nose pressed to his shoulder. Quite a lot of tension leaves him.
It's a less than welcome development, certainly, but Pansy forces herself not to become fraught with worry. They've been home a month — surely with time this reinfatuation with Potter will taper off. Especially if he continues being a douche.
The thing is; Harry knows some blokes wear knickers. He’s seen them before. Silk that rides up over the waistbands of jeans when they lean against the bar. Lace, frills, bows that you can see through sheer fabric. And Harry has always thought,
“Want you,” Harry says into the hem of Draco’s mouth.
Very funny. Very very funny. “Ha ha,” Draco says. “Leave my tea alone, Potter. I’ve been kind enough not to comment on the appalling state of your hair.”
Waving her hand idly, Pansy says, “You’re too kind. Certainly I haven’t given my time to anything as noble as Healing.”
Nodding, Harry turns and reaches to unclasp his belt too-eagerly and tug at his zip, painfully hard beneath his jeans. Completely unable to wrap his head around what’s about to happen.
, but that actually makes it even more annoying. Bratty Malfoy kind of turns him on. In this context, at least. Shutting him up sounds twice as good, though, which is where Harry gets the idea to snake a hand up to his neck and curl his fingers around it gently. No pressure — just the potential for it. “You know,” Harry says, as if he’s presenting an idea, “if you couldn’t breathe, you also couldn’t talk. Which would be nice.”
“Hermione and I helped him escape. We went back in time. I saw myself almost die. It was actually quite fucked. In a fun way, I suppose.”
?” Ron demands as Malfoy and Hermione — Harry feels sick, actually sick — hug.
"No," Harry says automatically. He stands up, realising suddenly that being too close is probably not a good idea. "I just ... I dunno. I was just saying."
Harry tugs at Draco’s flies, pulling his red, leaking cock from through the placket.
there. “You're not so bad yourself. I kind of like these too.”
“But I rather think there’s a more important question to be answered, don’t you?”
"It's complicated," he says. "I know you don't like them."
Ron looks at her all kind of adoringly, and Charlie decides it's a scene he probably shouldn't interrupt and that he'll say hi to them both later.
"No," Draco says, rather petulantly.
Harry's so pretty. Charlie's thought so ever since he saw him at Bill's wedding (before he Polyjuiced into another Weasley sprog, of course), looking very serious and much older than he really was.
Lucius was never so cruel (to others, certainly, but not to Draco) before the end of the war. When he was a child, his father would take him to the lake on the edge of the Manor's property and enchant little balls of soft, wavering light to flicker out of the water. Draco never saw Lucius twirling his wand behind his back — he thought there were magical, shimmery fish living in the lake until he was eleven.
“I think you should tell me about the stars,” Harry says.
"He's right," Pansy agrees. "Although I wish you wouldn't be such a prick about it, Blaise, Draco's sensitive and quite sloshed at the moment, be gentle."
“Yes! Harry —”
“No,” Draco says. Potter’s ankles leave behind little oval ripples as he walks. “Have you?”
“How very dare you, Potter!” Malfoy protests. He leans closer in his scolding.
Around them, the song has changed to a non-descript, thrumming loop of drums and synths, and the drips at Harry’s hairline tingle with the cool breeze from the arch.
Draco hums, and rocks harder against Harry, clutching at Harry’s one hand with two of his own.
“No,” Ron snorts. “But that was warmer.”
It's a poor job, but fuck, it'll have to do. He climbs to his feet again and presses two fingers back inside, pleased with the lack of friction. It's saliva and it'll dry out fast, but he wasn't really planning on drawing this out anyway.
Harry blinks at him. Frowns. Wonders if he's too drunk for this conversation. "What do you mean?"
"Pretty good, actually," Harry says. "My ex wasn't—" he cuts off, remembering that this is Malfoy, and busies himself with adjusting Rose again to cover his misstep. "It was just Hermione and the Weasleys and my godson Teddy, so it was nice. Rose's first Christmas and all."
When Harry hands him a glass, Draco makes a disapproving hmph. “These are
Draco hadn't thought to tell Harry he had private rooms, because he finds them invaded by his friends so often that they're hardly more secluded than the Gryffindor's arrangement. Also, he'd been quite unconvinced of Potter's ability to outfox Pansy.
“If that’s a metaphor,” he says, “it’s a shit one.”
When the Dark Lord arrived, Draco didn't leave his rooms unless summoned. Sometimes Lucius was there too, but he would only look through Draco, never meeting his eye, and when he grabbed him by the shoulder to lead him from the room once they were dismissed his hand was bony and cold, and they wouldn't speak.
Oh. That kind of fuck-wittery.
"Can't. Pansy demanded answers last time. She won't be distracted again," says Draco.
Pansy can't help it — she rolls her eyes. Fuck, if Granger isn't stubborn. She's starting to see what her and Draco might have in common.
Draco needs Potter’s cock back inside of him more than he needs his job, surely, more than he needs to be spared the public humiliation of being found in such a compromising position.
He's not on Auror mode, so Harry's a millisecond slow realising Malfoy's lifting his arm. But his reflexes have always been infallible — he catches his wrist before the slap lands, surprised and angry and somehow devastated.
The angle and having to reach half-inside Malfoy’s trousers is killing his wrist so Harry stops for a moment and pulls them further down his hips, and this time he licks his palm before returning it to Malfoy’s cock. He slows the movements down, stroking from base to tip, and goes back to mouthing at his jaw. “Why don’t you just stop talking,” Harry mumbles. “I thought you wanted to come.”
. Wow. Charlie kind of wants to frown at Harry, and kind of wants to high five him. "Harry," he says. "Mate, of course not."
on me,
, managed to actually be worse than anticipated thanks to some clown in Kent putting Muggles under the Imperius Curse. His head was so far out of the game that said clown got Harry with a Stunner when he and Terry Boot (his partner) ambushed him. It hadn't mattered — Terry took him down smoothly and Harry got nothing worse than a bruise on his leg and his ego.
“Good. So full, aren’t you love? No room in that pretty little head of yours for anything but my cock, is there?”
“You’d be in a mood too if you were having a Malfoy crisis,” he says drily. “But I’m ... you know. Fine. Trying to make some decisions. Figure some things out.” He looks over at her, says, “I’ve earned a few mistakes, haven't I?”
Hermione nods. “Okay. Yes, good.” She supposes Harry has a point. She does have a tendency to revert back to that fretful mindset whenever she hears he’s done something reckless. It’s a hard thing to shake.
more often than his own name, and likes to use the expensive(!!) hide rugs in his living room to break in her new heels. He’s friends with Blaise, who always slinks away from the bar before he’s paid his tab, and brings hookups back to Draco's apartment when he’s not there (and sometimes when he is, too, but Draco’s tried very hard to erase those occasions from his memory).
That makes Draco annoyed. He’s not exactly sure why. He bites down on the moan of Potter nudging at his cock — gripping Harry’s arms, he shifts himself on top and says, “And no one ever believed me when I said you were a prick.”
Harry rolls his eyes. "Course it did. You know, I could have fucking murdered you that year and probably not felt very bad about it," he informs Draco, fascinated by the way his body remembers all that rage, a ghost of the way it had felt. "You still have the badge? I would love to choke you while you're wearing it."
What it’s actually giving him is an extremely uncomfortable erection that will make it impossible to continue sitting on the floor much longer.
“You’re very funny,” she says. “Floo me if you need anything, alright? You’re a lifesaver.”
Draco doesn’t believe it, but it makes his cock so hard he goes blind with it. “Me,” he demands. “Me first.”
“Less than ten minutes, and you’ve already wrangled mention of your tedious heroics. I shouldn’t expect any less, I suppose.”
Malfoy cocks his head. Harry almost chokes on his own spit. “What the fuck,” Malfoy says, “is a cab?”
Draco sniffs. He’d found the book on the coffee table, Granger’s no doubt, and it’s the same issue of Muggle Methods for Treating Magical Maladies he’s been meaning to order for weeks. He says, “I know how to work a television set.”
"They're open," Harry smirks.
"It isn't?"
"Whatever, just shut up about Malfoy, alright? The both of you. I'm so bloody sick of the whole thing."
It's nearly two when she leaves, tucking him in and extinguishing the lights, and she sets the wards on his flat before stepping into the Floo.
Harry frowns at him. “D’you have a different suggestion?”
"Ah." Harry clears his throat and lifts his gaze back to Malfoy. "Well in that case, fuck you, then. If anyone's the lost Crup, it's you."
“Potter,” Draco says, pushing the bottle of wine away from his face and deciding (most graciously) to ignore the hideous inaccuracies Potter’s just slandered him with. “You’re hard.”

“This isn’t like that, Hermione,” he says a little gruffly, not meeting her eyes. “You’re making it into something it’s not. I know you’re just worried about me, I get it, and I’m grateful, but I’m not delicate. And I’m not getting involved with Malfoy.” He lifts his gaze to her again. “Okay?”
"Dreadfully sorry if being reminded how blessed I am to be with you doesn't do much for me," Draco says.

“Don’t be fucking glib,” Draco snaps. Of course Pansy would’ve told Blaise. He shouldn’t have expected any less, and he hardly has the sentience to be miffed at her for it. “I'm not
Charlie knows pushing it will only make Harry feel worse, so he doesn't. Instead, he says, "Before you said it was really hard to not go and see him."
“Do be a lamb and fetch me a refill,” Draco says, in the kind of drawl that would put even his father to shame, holding his wine glass out with lazy fingers. “While you’re up.”
Hermione pays the tab at the bar, and Ron leans heavily on Harry’s shoulder. Until he decides to pull Harry into his chest and bury his chin in his hair.
"Let me," Draco says, and that's when Potter bites at the soft seam of his shoulder, and he feels any semblance of control he still had over the situation he's orchestrated slip like silk through his white-knuckled fingers. "More. Touch me. Please."
He sees Malfoy notice him as he approaches and lifts a hand in greeting, which he then stuffs into his pocket.
Draco says, “Naturally.”
“Want me to finish you off?” he says, voice scratchy.
“Most of what
With Harry rolling his skin between his teeth, Draco laughs in enlivened realisation. He says, "You're entirely transparent."
“No need. You’re criminally inadequate at discretion.”
“Fine, don’t tell me,” says Harry. “You know you’re going to have to open up to me eventually.”
"If you need medical assistance, I'm afraid you'll have to check in with the Welcome Witch on the ground floor. Mind, she gets a little snippy this late in the eve."
Harry’s usually one for smoking over drinking, but tonight he’s had three or four firewhiskeys and it’s got him proper sloshed. Which is good, because the setting of the party has prompted more than one reminder from another drunk person about
Draco looks only at Harry’s hands as he settles them over the thick guardrail, worn bronze under its dark coating. His wrists are spare and bony like Draco’s own, but the palms are more square; fingers just as long, but knobbly, and nails bit down to the quick. They look like a boy's hands, with knuckles that have been popped and rough thumb pads. Draco’s never liked his hands. They’re very feminine. Long, thin fingers and so pale they look almost blue next to Harry’s.
“Mm,” says Draco. “Want you, too.”
Ron decides to indulge him, just for a bit. “Tragically I do. Both looked much too happy when they came in, didn’t they?”
Harry looks down, and regrets it. He can see pale skin pulled taut over hip bones, and thinks how unfair that is. Because, really, if Malfoy’s going to be a prat, he could at least have the common decency to be an
"Fuck," Draco sighs. He leans down and mouths at Harry's jaw, a muddled line of kisses to his mouth. "So sensitive."
"Indeed you should. I expect McGonagall will give it back to you tomorrow morning."
Draco makes a sound like a strangled Kneazle, and tries to wrench his hand from Potter’s grip. He can’t.
“Yeah,” he sighs. “Tragically I do. I still think the out of sight, out of mind thing is the best way to go, though. Could always slip him a love potion, distract him while we think of a way to kill Malfoy off without anyone noticing.”
Draco says, "Ng," and does as he's told.
“Oh, fuck,” Harry groans, his other hand joining the first on Malfoy’s head. He
“No, f— mm, Harry.”
“—part of life. Really, Harry, after all we’ve been through, you shouldn’t be so dramatic about a bit of—”
if you don't finish, can it? "Also, I didn't kiss him or anything. It was so ..." he shakes his head, lets out a quiet, tired laugh, "like, afterwards, it felt like it hadn't even happened. I mean ..."
Palming the wand with the same earnest tug he felt the night before, Draco considers this. He’s become used to self-reliance — an adjustment that was unsurprisingly rough after a childhood of whims easily catered to. He supposes the last time he was offered help it was by Severus, and the last time it was given to him, without favour, was by Harry.
Draco’s loathe to admit Potter’s actually quite funny. Even Pansy and Blaise would’ve laughed at that. He says, “Charlie? Is he the one with the lush forearms?”
Draco says, “Hm?” And then snickers softly against Harry’s skin.
“Of course.” Draco sits at the wrought iron chair opposite Narcissa. He saw her eyes dart to his cheek — Lucius has a quick, sharp wrist and it stings like a fucking bitch. He loves his mother, but he does wish that the streak of fierce protectiveness she harbours wouldn’t make such allowances for her ‘sadistic cunt of a husband’ (quote Blaise). “The flowers look beautiful, Mum.”
It’s hard for him, but Harry stays silent while Charlie talks. It’s not that he doesn’t trust Ron and Hermione and Ginny and everyone else, but there’s a calm rationality about Charlie, a willingness to listen rather than posit conclusions, that Harry really respects and puts a lot of stock in. And beyond that, it’s kind of nice that Charlie doesn’t know Malfoy.
He chugs half the beer and then presses it to his cheek, which is too warm.
when Harry gets that second finger inside, which goes straight to his cock. It almost feels worth it to give in and just fuck him already, but he gathers all of his (not inconsiderable, when he puts his mind to it) will power and forces himself to wait and keep pace. It's a
"You've got yourself a deal, Mrs Granger."
After a minute, he says, “You can leave if you want, I won’t sic the trees on you this time. Thanks for staying a bit. ”
. Not that it matters," he adds, glancing once at Malfoy's mouth (god, that's a bad idea) and then away, "because even if it
“Okay, Harry,” Hermione says, because while she does trust that Harry’s more careful now than he used to be, and definitely more mature, she’s not quite sure she believes him about not hating Draco after Sunday night’s display. He and Ron really were complete berks, at that dinner. Certainly it’s not the kind of proper, virulent loathing that drove him to do so many ridiculous things in school. Maybe something left over from that. “I don’t mean to scold, you know. I just get a bit hyper focused when I’m worried.”
"Because he thinks he shits gold," Blaise says before Pansy can give her two knuts. "Establishing his moral high ground, that's all, Draco. Maybe trying to get another fuck out of you, one where he can actually finish."
“You won’t
and then Granger kind of yelled at him, and now he’s here. With the child.
"True," Harry agrees. "I"m really not very well-adjusted." It's a joke, but it's also not a joke. And it's not one he'd have made in front of most other people, who would have taken it much too seriously. "I'll be alright, though. If it makes you feel any better, I doubt anything will happen on that front."
“Cognac?” Pansy offers, reaching for the crystal stopper in her favourite XO. Granger looks kind of uptight and vaguely annoyed, the way she always used to in school. “It’s imported, of course. Britain has its charms but the liquor,
Draco shifts on the rug. His bare arse is sensitive (and doesn’t Harry know it.) Harry crawls down to prop himself between Draco’s legs. “I’m gonna suck you,” Harry tells him, taking hold of Draco’s cock once again and lazily pumping the base.
“It wasn’t when he was fucking me,” says Draco, and he’s getting especially snippy in the way he always does when he’s tired. “By that stage, I was already sort of— actually no, for fucks sake, Pansy. I didn’t
keep company
Malfoy’s pissed, the same way he is. And he’s never seen Malfoy drunk, so he’s really got no idea what pushing things will do, but he doesn’t have enough sober logic at the moment to make good decisions.
"I promise not to drool if you promise not to come the second I touch your cock," Harry says in a (quite impressively, thanks) measured voice. "D'you think you can handle that, Malfoy, or should we take a break?"
He scoffs. As if Potter would give his precious little bleeding Gryffindor heart to anyone of Draco's sort. Potter thinks he's, what was it? Evil's pathetic little sideshow?
at me, Harry, please. Of course, you’re an adult, how you conduct your affairs is entirely your business. But when it comes to Draco, I think I have the right to be more than a little concerned. You’ve always been self-destructive around him. I didn’t say anything when Ron told me about the two of you because, call it wishful thinking, I’d hoped you may have at least tried to be more constructive before entering into a sexual relationship together. From what Draco said, that’s clearly not the case.”
that happened with Potter in that empty room at Mungo's, because he doesn't want to talk about it. Doesn't, doesn't.
Draco doesn't like to be surprised. (In fact, last year, when he walked into his flat to see the lights off and the awkward silhouettes of Slytherins trying their hardest to forget a decade or two of posture training and fold themselves into a crouch behind his low-slung coffee table, he’d simply set down his bags and walked back out again. It had taken much coercion from Pansy (“
"I … have to get back to work," he forces out.
tell me you’d rather stay friends? Do unrequited confessions get your dick hard, or something? Fuck off.”
“How long are you staying?” he asks when he pulls back, a little regretfully.
“Well that could be kind of fun,” Harry grins. “I could choke you afterwards.”
It’s the lip bite that makes Harry realise how hard he is, and when Malfoy steps even closer Harry’s drunk brain lets him act instead of think, pushing Malfoy back against the balustrade and panting into his mouth. He slides his hand under his shirt just enough to feel warm skin on his hip and breaks from his mouth as he does it to kiss down his jaw, stopping to suck lightly where it becomes his neck.
"Thought your jizz would be liquid gold, or something," says Draco. He stands up, runs his tongue over his bottom lip. "Suppose not."
"Darling," she says with a smile. The water stops flowing from her wand and she gestures to the pot of tea on the table. It's then that she notices the red print on his lovely cheek and her stomach goes cold, but she says nothing about it. She'd hoped they might ... but it doesn't matter. "Join me?”
Unbelievable. “Just because I have opinions on what’s right and wrong doesn’t mean I see in black and white,” Harry says bitterly, recovering finally from his misstep. “But fine, I’ll give it a try. I didn’t know you read Muggle literature.”
When Draco lapses into moaning, Harry pulls off him and laves eagerly at the head of his cock. “Tell me another one. A constellation.”
“‘Mione, d’reckon you could not talk about internal Splinchings while we’re eating?”
"Isn't it obvious?" Draco says, and when Potter continues to look at him blankly (sweaty, and bare armed under his Auror robes, but that's entirely
Ron snorts. “Yeah. Thanks.” A sigh, and he rubs the back of his neck. “So. What’re we gonna do?”
The articles— scratch that.
any Muggle friends, but he knows Potter will probably get all self righteous about it, even though the reason is purely that his only friends are Pansy and Blaise. “Something like that,” he says, and flicks a page.
Harry grins. Watches him take another cigarette out, and waits for Malfoy to look at him again. “It’s not a haircut,” he says.
It worked (sort of) until today, when Granger lured him in with Jaffa Cakes, and then asked him about Potter, as if they were fucking boyfriends, or something. He hadn't meant to snap at her like he had, but he supposes the whole thing still kind of rankles. The thought of Potter going around thinking Draco's all torn up over the abrupt way he'd halted proceedings makes him want to crawl out of his fucking skin.
“Pansy knows. She also knows not to ask,” says Draco.
"Mm," says Draco, tipping his head back. "He was a beast. Ask Granger."
He finds his mother in the conservatory, with a pot of tea at her elbow. Unlike Father, she still has her wand, and she’s using it now to water a flowering patch of lillies of the valley.
Potter grumbles something into his shoulder, and Draco smirks as he prepares to cast. Perhaps twenty-three is a little old to be feeling superior over something so juvenile, but he can tell Potter's bothered by the malfunction. And he is decidedly not. Eight years sleeping in an underwater dungeon does wonders for one's fear of enclosed spaces.
Kissing Draco is better the second time, he thinks. When he’s panting into it, and the swells of his lips are tender with pale bruises, and his pulse is thrumming under Harry’s hand on his neck (he’d asked for it there, so.)
being intimidating these days ... or whatever.
Draco sets down his almost full coffee. It’s bitter. “Get what out of your system, exactly?”
Hermione's face softens. "I know. I know that, Harry. And I know how much you and Ron hate it when I talk about sexual health and all that, but you have to know that though it might not be a romantic relationship, it's still a relationship of sorts when it's with someone with yours and Draco's kind of history. You've got to recognise that." She sits down in the chair opposite Harry's. He's looking a bit sulkily into his lap, and she studies his face imploringly. "You know, it was really hard watching you go through all that stuff with Natalie. For a bit, it was just like after the war. It's awful, seeing you like that. But you've done so well to help yourself since then. I just care about you. So much. I don't want to see you do something that will jeopardise that."
to do is drop the ridiculous French food (it looks exactly like the pile of cat vomit he'd found on his pillow yesterday) to spite the both of them, revel in the satisfaction of watching it splatter across the hardwood floor, and then punch Malfoy in his smug cunting face. It's the coat on his arm that does it, transporting him back to fifteen when he'd been prone to becoming apoplectic with rage over very small things, which, to be fair, hadn't felt small, and nor does this. But he's
around him, so you can fuck off with that. What does that even
Finally, he says, “Is there a bath?”
Harry blinks. He’d been expecting to hear one of a few Slytherin names. “The fuck?” he says, suddenly morbidly curious. “Tell me.”
"You're not evil incarnate, Malfoy," he says, and takes another step towards him. "You're, like, evil's little sideshow. If I want you, it's only because it would be an absolute pleasure to put you in your place for once."
Harry watches him go and thinks:
“Ron. We’ll stop at the Kebab shop.”
Draco cants his hips forward. Arches his back, chest warm and gasping against Harry’s, and his cock hard, damp, twitching, a beautiful curve daubed in thick fabric. Harry wants—fuck, Harry wants to see it bare, flushed and arching towards Draco’s flat abdominal plane. He wants, but he waits.
Pansy rises from her desk and goes to stand behind one of the leather bergères by her fireplace. It's where she relocates when she has appointments with clients or business partners who are more friends than associates, or when she thinks it might be politic to flirt a little to tip an agreement her way. She says, "Come in."
Draco wonders who the fuck the Dursleys are, then says, “It was lonely. You know, with no one here to follow me around like a lost Crup.”
Still, he feels bad. Malfoy sounds uncomfortably bereft when he says “fuck off”.
He’d stepped closer before, now he steps back. Lets his words creep into the space between them. “You want me.”
“It wasn’t a compliment.”
Harry lifts an eyebrow, smirking a bit. “Sort of tacky to leave, isn’t it?”
“Fuck off,” Draco mumbles. “How hideously twee. I just ... fuck, I might need to be drunk for this conversation.”
? Fucking ..." He huffs out a frustrated breath. Pushes a hand through his hair. "Look. I was gonna ... come see you. Or something. Now she's making this big fucking thing out of it."
Whenever Malfoy speaks, Harry can smell mint and smoke and liquor on his breath. “Oh. He left.”
Draco sighs, and tangles the hand that’s not curled around this wine glass in Harry’s. “What else would it be? We’re compatible, you know.”
“Fuck, Harry, don’t. I’m resolved not to shag you.”
Until Draco says, “Enough,” managing to sound firm and breathless all at once. “Enough teasing, Potter. Come.”
, it’s just that this new world is a difficult one to get used to. “You always said she was very intelligent. I’m glad to hear you two are friendly. Is she ...” She clears her throat quietly, and when she speaks her voice sounds a little unsteady, “Is she friends with Potter still?”
and make him go veritably liquid with want.
for a brain and knows not the first. Fucking. Thing. About shagging etiquette. Let me in.”
And that Harry does.
"Mum's always pissed. C'mon, we can race back."
— said it’s the first one they’ve ever had at St Mungo’s,” Granger says, in another gallant attempt to redirect the conversation into less slanderous territory.
Draco drops his voice into a crude imitation of Harry's accent. “I do think yuh fancy me. Idiot. Get your hand back on my cock.”
“I don’t think you’re pathetic,” Harry says emphatically, perhaps too much so thanks to the alcohol in his blood. He’s relieved, though, to know the Ministry isn’t confiscating wands to interrogate. It couldn’t do anything, but he still doesn’t like the idea of it in anyone’s hands but Malfoy’s, to whom it belongs. “What’s the problem then, why don’t you have it?”
And now his friends (or so they claim) are gone, and it’s just Harry leaning against a sticky table, and Draco Malfoy pushing his way through thronging bodies towards him.
— no. You and your depraved strap aren't getting within ten feet of my arse."
There’s some kind of faint, rolling beat surrounding them, more of a reverberated feeling through plaster and drywall from the flat next door than proper sound. Harry’s glad for it; he thinks, vaguely, nonsensically, that silence would feel rather deafening after the noise of the club.
“No,” he says. “Children don’t like me.”
“These are so much fun again now you got rid of that bint Natalie,” says Seamus, completely unnecessarily, in Harry’s opinion. But Parvati decides to agree loudly.
Draco says, "That's because I live my life at the peak, Potter." That horrible distressed fog of his sixth year, where the only thing he really, properly remembers is the filthy brand of Dark magic on the soft underside of his arm, an Easter holiday spent huddled in his bedroom because he Dark Lord could be sitting in his breakfast nook, the utter recalcitrant of a lift stopping between floors with only him and Potter trapped inside.
“Doesn’t count,” Draco insists. He grazes Harry’s lips with his teeth, trying to knock the stupid smile out of them.
“Nother drink?” Harry says, for something to say.
Draco wonders how Harry can be so cavalier about that. The smell of smoke still makes him sick. Once you've had several dozen near death experiences, they probably don't affect you so much, he supposes.
“This,” Harry says, pulling at the hem of Draco’s shirt, “‘s criminal.”
. He could happily sit here letting his knees bruise against the unforgiving floor of the lift if it meant keeping his face buried in Malfoy's arse. He works him open more quickly than he'd have liked to because — well,
Fuck. Harry looks so completely forlorn that Charlie is really very hesitant to give him anything other than reassurance, but the things he’s saying ... they don’t sound good, exactly. “Mate, I dunno what to tell you. I— is it more of a physical thing, or do you actually like the bloke?”
He blinks at the doors, at the flashing emergency button, and says, “No. Nope.”
Draco’s hands fall from Harry’s wrist to bunch in his shirt. He mumbles, after a beat of wracking, panting breaths, and Harry takes it as his cue to slide his fingers gently from Draco’s mouth.
"You tried it?" he asks unceremoniously, gesturing with his head to the blank stretch of wall.
Blaise waves his hand. “As long as we don’t go to Maison,” he says. “Their oysters are a fucking disgrace.”
"I don't have it," Draco says. "Not allowed."
Number one: Granger is nice. In an earnest, unflinching, I’m-going-to-be-pleasant-to-you-whether-you-like-it-or-not kind of way, and Draco is not friends with nice people. He’s friends with Pansy, who calls him ‘you
“I mean, it’s not like he was indoctrinating her into the Death Eaters or anything, Ron,” Harry says finally. They both look at him in such a way that he’s absolutely sure now they’d forgotten about him. “If it makes you feel any better, she was screaming until I got here and took her.”
“I suppose so,” Draco murmurs. Then, when Harry’s halfway up the stairs, he says, “Potter.”
is buried in. Same thing, though. Right now, it’s very much a part of her. “Good boy. Isn’t he a good boy, Blaise?”
Ron receives yet another blow to the head, which usually would have been in Harry’s opinion the height of comedy, but right now only feels like an attack on his team. He and Ron being one team, Hermione and Malfoy the other. It’s come to that, especially when Malfoy says
It's a complete nightmare of a situation, to put it bluntly. Ron hasn't

leading, being in charge, giving orders if he needs to ... it's never felt like this, though. Especially not under these particular (sexual) circumstances.
Draco murmurs, “No bother.”
"No, Malfoy," he says in a tone that implies he's speaking to a child. He doesn't
Draco smiles. Leans back against the counter. He’s not quite sure when he changed tracks from trying to entice Potter into an apoplectic fit to... whatever this is. But he keeps going, for the reason he always has done. Because he wants to.
It’s when Draco’s utterly incoherent nonsense dissolves into nothing that Harry pulls his mouth off with a pop. Draco bucks upwards, keening desperately, murmuring into the crook of his own elbow. Harry can’t even fucking

Draco says, "Because I'm actually a very altruistic and lovely person."
All Harry can really do for a few moments is blink. Then he feels blood rush to his face (which he would have hoped might take blood away from other parts of his body where it doesn’t belong at the moment, but of course he’s a highly fucked up individual so maybe it shouldn’t surprise him, really, that his cock is actually harder now that Malfoy’s called him out), and he decides that dying right at this exact moment would definitely be preferable to living.
Potter skips another stone. He’s annoyingly good at it. “I’m not sure why you’re telling me this. I’ve always known you were an attention whore.”
"Why d'you have to be so fucking prickly?" Harry snaps. He doesn't actually know why he's so angry. Well, no, he

"Fine," Harry says carefully. "What happened?"
“Big cock, though.”
"I don't feel good," he mumbled.
Draco opened his eyes, raising his eyebrows at the other.
Draco shoved George that time, with Alex muttering about not being too harsh. Draco chose to ignore the two and headed to the car himself, sitting in the back. No doubt George would want Alex up front with him. As worried as Draco was about Christmas becoming too sickeningly sweet he wasn't opposed to the three of them being slightly cramped in the flat.
"Alexander Joustin? The auror? He's been making your meals to make sure you ate."
"We barely spend any time together anymore!" was the first thing Draco made out.
"There's a but there."
"He says sorry. Ginny dragged him off just as he was coming here," Hermione began to look over Draco's work. "He grabbed me and told me to help if you needed it."
Theodore pouted but nodded. Blaise quickly threw back a shot before taking his own spin of the bottle. He took another shot of firewhiskey before it landed on Dean. Blaise contemplated for a few minutes, he was not close to Dean, nor had he paid much attention to him in previous years. It was obvious he was struggling.
"OK...um, why are you telling me this?" Draco whispered, unsure why.
Draco nodded, taking a seat on the large mass of pillows in front of the fire. It was warm and reminded him of the nights he and his mother would read together. He managed to say upright for a total of two minutes before collapsing and sinking into the pillows. He felt his eyes closing. It seemed that he needed to catch up on sleep after all the excessive studying.
He signed the final letter and attached them in two separate bundles. One for his owl to send to the burrow and one for Blaise's to send to George, Charlie and Bill. He spoke gently to them, offering treats as thanks and as an apology for the journey he was asking Blaise's owl to take. As they flew away all he could hope was that Ginny hadn't managed to turn the Weasley family against him.
"Do what you like," Draco waved his hand in dismissal.
"You don't care, Malfoy. Why would you? You've never even learnt to care. You're such a prat. You hated everyone. Looked down at anyone you thought was beneath you. You called Hermione a mudblood for Merlin's sake," Harry treated him the same as he'd treated Ginny moments before. "You can't possibly care about anyone. You just don't have it in you."
feel horrible about the break-up. I should, shouldn't I?"
"I can't bloody believe you did that. We were all wondering when she was going to say something about the tutoring sessions. There was a betting pool," Blaise momentarily looked sad. "I should've bet on you blowing up at her."
"I dare you to kiss the prettiest girl here," well at least she didn't out him.
He didn't get a verbal answer. Blaise nuzzled his head into the crook of Draco's neck as he got comfy. Helping Blaise with his sexuality crisis took Draco's mind away from coming out to Harry. He did feel better after coming out to the other and Draco knew Harry wouldn't tell a soul. That didn't make it any less scary for him in the long run. Draco knew he'd never have to stop coming out, but he hadn't even told George yet. It was a shock as that thought came to him. George had become such an important person in Draco's life and he didn't even know such an important thing about Draco. Draco didn't even know when he decided George was important enough to tell, he'd always thought the arrangement would be temporary and steeled himself for the inevitable hurt the end would cause. That night he mentally drafted a letter explaining that he would be visiting the shop the first chance he got because he had something rather important to say. It helped him lull into sleep, dreamless for once as Draco felt a warmth he hadn't in a long time.
"The fact of the matter is Harry is the only one who will tolerate my fussiness over the quality of my work. Thursdays are my only free afternoons. I tutor him as much as he tutors me," Draco knew it was too late to turn back now. "You wouldn't want your boyfriends marks to suffer because of your petty jealousy, would you?"
"I know it isn't really. There's no way he found out about anything if I haven't even discovered it myself."
The more comfortable he was getting with the eighth years the less he felt like he had to keep an air of politeness. He could feel himself slipping into old habits and attitudes he expressed around his very best friends. It came as a surprise to Draco that it happened naturally, well as natural as blurting out insults across a table could be. He was holding himself to other people's standards, doing whatever was necessary to allow the others to feel comfortable around him.
"Thought I'd get the first round," Blaise smiled, sliding in opposite Draco.
"You cannot talk. You told him the boy was dead," his father's anger turned to his mother.

Draco heard a glass smash and a door slam. He took some deep breaths in a futile attempt to quell his fear. Shakily, he stepped out of the alcove. Harry didn't notice him as he was knelt on the floor. It didn't take Draco long to realise that the other boy was trying to pick up all of the broken glass pieces. He wasn't even sure if Harry realised his hands were already bleeding. Though it was a small relief that it had been thrown to the floor rather than at Harry himself. Draco was quiet but he made sure his footsteps could be heard by Harry so that he didn't scare the fragile boy.
The two boys walked in a comfortable silence to the pub. Thinking about the trip, Draco realised it had mostly been spent in silence. Blaise had only spoken to him in Honeydukes and it was small talk at best. He hoped that it was because Blaise had taken his advice and was mulling over the Theodore problem sober. Although that might have already been decided if Blaise's attitude at breakfast was anything to go by.
He shook Dean gently until he woke.
"Draco?" Blaise whispered.
"Despite the war we've managed to have some first years. Trust me it was a process to find as many as we did and it's still not all of them. This means that there is not space for you in your old houses. The faculty and I came up with a solution. Or rather it came to us. The Room of Requirement has taken up permanent residence on the Third Floor. When inspected there was no damage from the events of the war. It has changed into a house of it's own, dormitories and the common room are already established. You will be living in this Inter House. Look after it. You will be attending most classes with returning seventh-years, though a few will be attending one to one classes alongside these. I assume you all want to continue with the subjects of study you had begun. If not please talk to me immediately. With all that said I shall leave you to find your accommodation. Good luck."
"Wait, I was supposed to dare him," Draco refused to admit it came out far whinier than he wanted. It was hopeless in any case as Harry had already begun making his way around the circle. Most people got a peck on their forehead or cheek, Hermione got a shorter peck on the lips. It was followed by light giggles, covering up blushes or scoffing at the stupidity of it. Draco tried to will away the feeling in his stomach, he was not sober enough to address that. Before he had reigned it in Harry was kneeling in front of him, smiling softly. Draco could admit that Harry's eyes shone when he smiled like that. He wasn't expecting the gentles kiss on the lips, one that lasted a breath of a second longer than Hermione's had. They both couldn't help but laugh, too tipsy to care about anything that was happening. Harry finally made it back to where he had started and spun the bottle carelessly. It had moved from the centre during it's spin but landed on Seamus.
