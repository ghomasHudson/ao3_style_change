“I can use both, originally I was only able to use my left hand but my uncle...He said that was bad so he forced me to use both, now I’m glad cause I can use my other...Sorry...Um...” Harry flushed realising that he was rambling as the two almost identical Malfoys looked at him. He was about to scratch the back of his neck but stopped as Lucius moved forward and patted him gently on the back. The man wasn’t as gentle as his wife an yet there was something warm about him. He had changed a handkerchief into a pair of gloves and shrunk Dudley’s old clothes until they fit him a little better.
“Yeah, he was a bit. We’re sorry for scaring him, we din’t mean too, it was an accident, we didn’t think...” The boy said his twin echoing the words and in another life the words would have fallen on a stony heart but Severus was not the same man he had been several weeks ago. Now he had a green eyed child who knew the worst of him and had forgiven him.
“Oh, my dear sweet Harry, those muggles will pay for how they have treated you, I will make sure of it” She told him softly and Draco let out a laugh saying;
“That’s a few weeks away, right?” Harry asked, he’d read all the reports in the newspaper and followed on the wireless, but he hadn’t been to a game in ages. He was always too tired after working in the field and wanted nothing more than a night in in front of the fire or when he wasn’t working a night out at a club.
“Can you believe it? Me! A lion!” Pansy gushed dropping down half on Harry’s lap and half on Draco’s “I almost had a heart attack! I thought for sure Slytherin but no, the hat said I had untapped courage! Me!”
“Well this is Septimius Malfoy” Harry hummed thoughtfully peering at the statue that was holding a scroll and had a large nose that seemed to be almost comical in relation to the rest of his face. He was wearing a toga but it didn’t seem to leave much to the imagination. Almost all the statues were in various stages of undress but this one had some seriously perky nipples that, like his nose, were too big. “So, we have to go back to the right opening and go through until we find the Gemini twins, they are pointing the way to the fountain”
“Moony, I have to go away, I will come back! I promise! Somehow, but can you give this to Draco when he comes again?” He asked staring into the amber eyes of the wolf hoping his friend would be well and could understand him like he believed he could. He didn’t get an answer but Moony pushed his large wet nose into his cheek before licking him and Harry realised that he was crying silent tears. “Goodbye…”
So…I hated that Cho Chang just seemed to have a stereotypical Asian name as though JK wasn’t sure if she were Chinese or Korean or What. I have many east Asian friends and their names are so beautiful. I couldn’t change it completely, so I changed it slightly. Chao-Xing means Morning Star in Chinese.
“Hello and welcome to your first Defence against the dark arts lesson. As the head mistress told you yesterday my name is Kazuko Ninomiya, but please call me Nino. I graduated three years ago from the Japanese academy of magic as a Gold Robe user and my passion has always been spell work, history, mysteries and the combination of all those.” Nino smiled in the friendly way she did when she had been teaching just Harry and Draco and Harry was glad to realise that her lessons were going to be as friendly and relaxed as they had been then. Behind the small Japanese teacher, a piece of chalk was floating against a blackboard copying down everything she was saying and Harry allowed his gaze to drift around the rest of the classroom. Like Nino herself, her teaching space was much the same as it had been in Malfoy manor, though now there were shelves with large arcane looking scrolls sealed with large lumps of aged wax. Decorating the walls were pictures and diagrams, some of various dark creatures, including a werewolf, and of people that seemed to be under the effects of dark magic with notes telling what to look out for. On her large wooden desk at the front of the class was a globe but it didn’t look like any globe Harry had seen before. “I hope to learn each and all of your names over the coming lessons but first things first....I would like you to sort yourselves into groups of four. I don’t care if you mix houses just so long as are four and you are all standing together, please.”
“Agreed, but if things keep going the way they have with Dumbledore then blood adoption would be best” Lucius let out a long sigh, uncharacteristic of the Lord, revealing more of what he was dealing with than he normally showed. Severus could easily guess what his friend was suffering, word may not have reached the press, but Dumbledore had a great many friends within the ministry and Lucius had few.
“Dobby is so sorry masters! Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!” He screamed smacking his head against the wall in a fit of panic. The elf was special touched he had to be none of the other elves acted the way that he did.
“They make a super breakfast every day” Harry laughed but he climbed out of bed and pulled on some of his new clothes before heading to his bathroom to brush his teeth.
“He sent an owl that he would be coming” Draco hummed fingering the golden buttons on the front of his frock coat seemingly trying to avoid catching his parents’ eyes. Lord and Lady Malfoy were still greeting their guests at the main hall. “Come on, we should go hide before I have to act like the proper heir and stand greeting everyone”
“Out on the north field one of the Pimpled Pugskins have a case of the yellow spot. He will be back soon, how are you, Harry?”
“Are still sleeping. Draco is dreaming about terrapins and cupcakes” Harry laughed sitting at his normal place and immediately feeding Hedwig some bacon.
“Severus…” Remus didn’t manage to get out another word, but he slipped on the ring and stared at it with such wonder that nobody was left in any doubt as to what his answer was.
“Forgive me” Sebastian said again blinking and flicking his tired eyes up to her looking for all the world like he was about to fall to sleep. “I am the son in law of Healer Hinchcliffe, Lady Malfoy, I am a mind healer, Tobias asked if I might talk to Harry...”
“Harry, it’s time” Lucius called from behind the altar where he was acting as spell caster along with Nino and Narcissa. The blood adoption was not as easy as taking a potion and hoping for the best, but they had managed to set it up quickly. “You are to stand between Severus and Remus, Harry”
“I...Yes...” Harry nodded using both hands to cling to Draco as the little elf touched them both while the auror Hestia placed a hand on the large ear. There was a ripple of elf magic and then they were in the reception room at Malfoy manor. It was the only place those not keyed into the wards could enter even with Elf magic and Draco wasn’t surprised when Harry wobbled and then fell over emptying out his stomach onto he floor.
“You are far to gracious my lady. I would be honoured to accept. Please come inside, I admit that I was surprised when the request came through. It is rare that the prisoners get visitors” Dobble walked back into the building and Narcissa and Kingsley followed. It was even colder in the building than it was outside and Narcissa could hear the sickening shouts and screams of the inmates. All around her she could feel the pulse of the Dementors, and she didn’t know how Dobble could stand to be here day in and day out. “But we have arranged for a room for you”
“No, I think it best if I do it now, Brat” Severus answered summoning the package to his hands and slowly lifting the lid. Harry wasn’t sure if he should look or not but when he peered inside, he was surprised by the odd mixture of items. The largest being a photo in a picture frame of two children. One a boy in all black and the other a girl, sitting side by side on a swing eating ice-cream. The picture didn’t move telling Harry that it was a muggle photograph and the writing on the frame declared ‘Best Friends for Ever’. “I made your mother the frame, I had no idea she had kept it...” Severus whispered in wonder as he stroked a finger over the picture before moving onto the other items. An acorn, pinecone, and dried leaves were under the picture along with a pencil with a rubber topper shaped like a rabbit. “Your mother she was fond of the topper in the corner shop next to the store. I bought it her for her birthday we passed it back and forth between ourselves when we had exams. When we fell out...I never saw it again, I assumed she had gotten rid of it...”
“I shouldn’t think so, we will have lunch in the garden” Narcissa stated looking out over the garden which was bathed in a warm rose glow of the summer sun. “Write your letter and then join me"
“Potter...Welcome to Madam Malkin’s robes for all occasions, sorry we were just about to close for lunch”
“You are mistaken, Pants, Harry is cousin only to mother. I swear it. Harry is the same age as us, all be it a month or so younger, it would be a great difficulty for my mother to have had him” Draco laughed very softly while Pansy’s eyes widened and her mouth fell open in a gasp.
“I know you! You are nearly headless Nick! My brothers told me about you!” Ronald said and Draco could see the ghosts pale face become a few shades paler as he gave a disappointed huff.
“He looks too thin?” Narcissa said with a hum and a nod waving to Master Pierre who was standing just out of sight behind the curtain. Narcissa then started speaking in rapid French motioning to Harry and the man nodded waving is wand and making some adjustments to the robes. There weren’t many but was suddenly not as tight around his body making him look a little fitter without making the robes too big. Draco gave his friend a smile getting up from the soft seat to walk over to Harry who looked smaller than normal.
Draco ran to his bedroom and threw open his door with a burst of accidental magic. Although he was truly horrified by what he had learned from Harry he couldn’t deny that he was excited about seeing him for the first time and he wanted to make a good impression. His walk in wardrobe was filled with clothes mostly robes and suits but he had a few casual clothes and he quickly decided on a simple pair of black dress trousers, a t-shirt, and a bottle green shirt. He ran a comb through his hair and then put on some dragon hide shoes. Once done he went back down finding his mother waiting for him dressed in a long light blue dress with flowing sleeves, the outfit made her look ethereal more so with her hair down in light waves around her shoulder.
“Okay, but make sure you do, Sev and Remus care a lot about you…But for now, shall we go help Seamus get on a broom and play some three on three Quidditch? You know, I never had anyone to play with until you came and now…We can have a sort of, almost, real game…”
Harry swallowed nervously as the hat slipped over his head, he felt Draco’s hand on his shoulder, but it did little to comfort him as the hat started speaking.
“Of course, Harry will be staying here. This is his home. Along with Lupin. Now sit and turn your books to page 57” Lucius said swiftly sweeping into the room in the same silent way Severus did, without the same dramatic flare of bellowing robes, and Harry grinned again, the happy bubble of family and love washing over him and he silently counted the days in his mind till the weekend. Only three left.
“Jinx only makes the best” He commented looking at Harry hoping he was enjoying it. He had calmed down after Jinx had talked to him but he had also fallen silent and was just staring at a biscuit. Mentioning Jinx however seemed to revive him as he asked;
“You will learn in time, I will hire another tutor to teach you about the wizarding world, but there will be time for that. For now let us just focus on other things” Lucius hummed finishing the chocolate humming “You will enjoy yourself with Narcissa and Draco. I wish that I could come with you tomorrow but I should imagine that I will be having meetings all day, I will like to be there when you see the healer though”
“Welcome, welcome!” The man said coming to stand directly in front of Harry so he could peer into his eyes. “Welcome Mr Potter, I wondered when I would be seeing you…It seems like only yesterday your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. And you Remus, a tricky little customer you were, but we got there in the end…How is it? Still working out for you?”
“You guys are really great friends” Chao-Xing said from her side of the table a huge grin on her face and Harry gave a nod.
“Harry dear, you are looking pale” She said letting go of the long fingers and coming to kneel in front of him her hands moving over his leg as he whispered;
“Yes, but I have always believed I was lucky Harry, the curse could have prevented me from even getting my Dragon and now I have you also” Narcissa’s voice spoke gently from outside the changing room door and Harry felt Draco jump and he let out a gasp. “Sorry, I came to see what was taking so long. May I come in?”
“This is all to just to get Harry ready to correct the damage done to him, even magic has limits, Lord Malfoy, and the body is a complex thing but if you follow the course of potions you will be in good shape for Hogwarts in a year” He said his tone having a touch of a promise about it and Harry gave a very small smile before a knock on the door wiped it away. The clearing of a throat followed as the door opened.
“And you know full well I will do so” Narcissa’s tinkling bell like laughter filled the hall as she almost floated into the room. She was wearing a soft aqua blue with diamonds around the hem. Her hair as always was fixed with pins of moving butterflies and her smile was easy. Seamus gulped as he saw her, but Bridget stiffened.
“Hey Harry! Hope you’re well, it’s been arranged with your dads that you will be continuing your music lessons on Saturdays in your dad’s office. So, I have a little extra homework for you, I want you to try writing some music. Doesn’t have to be a masterpiece, just something you can play me when I see you on Saturday and I want you to practice the sheet I already wrote for you. Have a great first week of school kid and remember, Keep rocking! C.S”
“We take it together.” He said turning and handing Minerva one of the glasses. He lifted the glass and then drank it down. Minerva followed suit and they waited in silence for the few minutes it took for the potion to work. Once he felt his mind slide into pleasantly blank, he sat on his sofa. “We each ask one question, an answer for an answer, do you agree?”
“Thank you, hem hem, I will also need to see a copy of Lord and Lady Potter’s wills, we must find out how Dumbledore came to be Mr Black-Potter’s guardian”
Listening to his two friends having a full, and rather loud, pillow war Harry brushed his teeth and then climbed into the shower. He scrubbed his body and hair and thought about the day ahead wondering how his life would change in a few short days when they were at Hogwarts. He had friends in Gryffindor, he knew the twins would look out for him, but he really couldn’t imagine being separated from Draco. Even the thought of it made him sick to his stomach. Finishing in the bathroom he pulled on the clothes that had appeared by the door. He had picked them out the night before and left them on the chair by his bed. He had forgotten them in his rush to leave Draco and Pansy and he gave a grateful smile.
“Why would I be jealous? If I followed the rules of the courting I would be the one doing the courting not the other way around. Are you jealous, Weasel? Want some rich pureblood lord to sweep you off your feet?” Draco sneered his voice icy but somehow Harry could tell his heart wasn’t in it. The boy had lost a lot of his fight over the last year or two and Harry had found that his potions tended to explode less this year.
The brownie was something my grandpa used to tell me so I put it in and used his name xD I promise it will get explained more in the story but basically if you lose something like your car keys or purse and you have a brownie living with you it is meant to bring it back for you so you can never lose anything. They will also tell stories. My grandpa told me one about a brownie who would ride dogs and battle rats riding cats. XD Um…I hope it was okay >.< The zoo is next.
“Fred! George! Get yourselves over here this minute!” She howled her voice ringing around the station harshly drawing the attention of the crowd. The twins shot them slightly embarrassed looked and slunk over to their mother, the young girl peeking out and staring directly at Harry.
“Sorry, father, but he is so thin!” Draco almost huffed his pale cheeks growing pink while Harry smiled swallowing down the bacon. He was happy his friend cared about him but he had to admit that his stomach was starting to feel painfully full.
I'm back! I can't promise daily updates at the moment but I will try to get them out in a quick fashion
“Good evening, Mr Black-Potter” An overly thin man with a slightly humped back and white hair that was brushed neatly back from his face said as they walked into a pleasant cream coloured sitting room. The man had a humped back from age rather than a deformity and his eyes were a washed out blue with the whites yellowed ever so slightly with age. Unlike the woman at his side or Lucius he didn’t wear robes but instead was wearing a light blue shirt with grey trousers and a woollen vest. The sleeves of the shirt were rolled up to the elbows revealing overly hairy and overly tanned arms. “My name is Tobias Hinchcliffe, I am a healer from Saint Mungos, it is a pleasure to meet you”
“Draco, your father punched Mr Weasley the last time they saw each other in the Ministry, he is hardly one to let bygones be bygones” Pansy whispered watching the twins who were excitedly looking around pointing at things around the stadium. Harry was also looking around his mouth slack.
“You will know him before you marry, we are allowing you to do that by hosting three balls, Dragon” Narcissa, the most beautiful woman in the land sighed looking to her husband who was absently reading through a letter he had received. Lucius looked up as he felt her stare and looked to his only child with a raised blonde eyebrow.
“It was interesting Lord...Mr...Lucius, sir, Pansy was really nice and the Parkinsons” Harry answered quickly moving out of the way as the floo flared and Narcissa stepped through as though she had just walked in from another room.
“Pleased to meet you” Harry replied surprised when a hand came to rest on his cheek in the same way aunt Petunia would Dudley when she was being ‘Motherly’. The large eyes of the creature filled with warmth and she patted him slowly.
“I was only joking Harry, you know that. But I know what people say about me” He shrugged, and Harry remembered how upset he had been when he had been talking about people avoiding him because of his family.
For the match himself he couldn’t really remember much of it. It was all happening so fast that it was hard to keep track even with the glasses. It was clear, from his limited knowledge of the sport, that the hummingbirds completely outmatched the Irish team. Every point they tried to get the keeper Emiko was there to stop them. He did learn that it was a brutal game with a risk of real injury and Harry found that although he enjoyed watching it he had been in enough pain in his life that he didn’t want to play it. The game ended about three hours later when Chai Charoen caught the snitch and held it aloft doing a lap of the pitch on her broom with her teammates following behind. A rather loud Irish fan in the booth next to them was swearing and waving his fist while his mother, with bright red hair was smacking him on the head and threatening to wash his mouth out with soap.
“Oh, did you get your teacher? For guitar? In your last letter you said you were having an interview” George asked sitting on his desk and kicking out his feet slowly ignoring the looks that they were getting from the students still working. Harry felt uncomfortable under the stares, but he was able to stay focused on his friends and gave a nod.
“Maybe it’s a good thing he has his own room. The other Slytherin’s didn’t look too thrilled with him.” Harry pointed out remembering the looks on almost every Slytherins face after Ron’s outburst the night before and Severus gave a nod. Draco on the other hand snorted.
“A single butterbeer won’t trouble your potions but only one mind, brat” Severus gave him his regular fond smile, something that had become more affectionate in the last week and Harry returned it with a smile of his own before turning back to Lupin who had slack jawed expression on his face.
“But you want to be a Slytherin” Harry pointed out and Draco shrugged deeply his arm tightening around him as he said softly;
“Impossible, if you were a squib you wouldn’t be able to use potions and magical treatments. Honestly, you just have a lot more going on in your head! I know!” Draco gasped getting up and clapping his hands together. Harry sat up in confusion at the excited expression on his face. “I’m going to talk to father…Wait here a moment”
“...I feel as though I must confess to you, I was not on the same side as your parents during the war, Harry. In fact, one would say that I was very close to the man that killed your parents” Lucius told him slowly and Harry sucked in a breath. Dumbledore had said as much the day before hadn’t he? He had said that the Malfoy’s wouldn’t be able to keep him because of what he had done. “I have no excuse for what I did all I can say was that it was a mistake on my part. I was young, foolish, and stubborn. I believed in the ideals of the man known as the dark lord and I followed him blindly. At first I knew not his true intentions and by the time I learned what his true plans were I was in too deep. To deny the Dark Lord was to put my family in danger. My heart had just given me my Dragon, but I swear, for all that I was in the so-called-inner circle, I never took part in the murders of muggle or wizard, but there are those that believe me to be as bad as the Dark lord himself. Dobby would happily fuel those rumours if we were to cut him loose”
“...I don’t...” He admitted in a small voice and to his surprise the old woman bit out an angry snarl which sounded suspiscously like a swear and the mutter of a strange name he had read in his Hogwarts; a history, book.
“Thank-you” Harry said flashing her another weak smile before he heard a laugh from the female...auror....hat had come with them. She was wearing purple robes with an insignia on the breast rather like a muggle policeman and Harry wondered if that was what she was.
“What?! Seriously? You’re taking us to a Quidditch game?” Draco asked throwing the scarf around his neck with ill-concealed excitement. Everything had been so tense since Dumbledore three days ago that Draco had honestly felt too tired to study. His father had increased the wards around the manor, keying Harry and Remus into the wards as family, and whenever they did go out it was only briefly and with at least two house-elves and an auror. A quidditch game was just the thing he needed, and he knew that Harry needed it just as much.
“Anything for the dark lord, Kingsley, Bella is cold, give her your robe” Narcissa ordered and still hoping Kingsley shrugged himself out of his robe and brought it over to Bella draping it around her shoulders. The cackling intensified but Narcissa could tell that her sister believed her. She inched closer her hand reaching out to Bella’s knee. It was almost skeletal under the filthy torn dress she wore. “We will return the Dark Lord and get you out of here Bella. I promise, but we have tried everything we know and failed, the ways of the Dark Lord were beyond us. You were his closest, his most admired, do you have anything that might help us find a way to get him back?”
“Yes, I am certain of it” Severus nodded not even pretending to be offended by Narcissa’s question. It was an understandable one but he could see the pinched look in her face and the way she was worrying  at her lip. With the curse on her family she would never be able to blood adopt Harry it was far too risky as they didn’t know how the curse could affect him but he knew that she would long to adopt him in anyway possible an blood adoption was the highest  kind of adoption it was as good as birthing the boy. “We can not act on this yet, the potion is a delicate one to brew and the affects on Harry’s already fragile body would be too much but as you are Harry’s guardians I thought you ought to know”
“I know, and I thank you, one day I will take you up on that. But now, let us sleep, I must be up before the first light to return to Hogwarts”
“No, you did so well my beloved, you were so brave” Lucius whispered pressing a light kiss to her temple. His hands moved up and down her arms trying to get some warmth into her. At his words Narcissa sank into his chest tucking her head under his chin making her look like the young girl she had been when the pair had met and fallen in love. “We know so much more now”
“Flew? On a broom? Why not use an international portkey?” Draco asked as the professor sat in the chair opposite Severus. Harry expected Draco to sit next to her but as he had done every day since he had arrived, he sat in the chair beside him and took his hand squeezing his fingers in a silent ask of ‘are you okay?’. Harry squeezed them back gently and the blonde smiled at him as Nino shrugged;
The room inside was painting free however the walls were made almost completely of glass offering views of a beautiful garden with trees and grass behind. The room itself was filled with sweetly smelling flowers and there were butterflies and tiny colourful birds flying about. He had never seen anything so beautiful and he gave a gasp as a pretty purple coloured bird swooped down and landed on his and Draco’s joined hands. It was so light and almost ticklish as it fluttered its wings its head cocking ever so slight to one side before it chirped and flew off to join those that were playing in the trees.
“I think Nino is awesome” Draco said stiffly, and Harry tried his best not to smile too wide at the flush that was in the pale cheeks. Draco’s little crush on Nino seemed to have faded over the months he had been with him, but he supposed that it was still there bubbling away under the surface. Harry couldn’t say he blamed him. Nino was attractive, objectively, but he didn’t have a crush on her even if she was nice and smelt good.
“True enough but they are shrewd little beasts. Very well, as Ministry official I grant you power of guardianship, for a month. Healer Hinchcliffe I require copies of your findings here today”
“We shall need to go to the hall of records and see what the so called prophecy is and then I will have this  letter checked by Flitwick to have him confirm it has not been tampered with and then we hand it over with our evidence to the ministry” Lucius answered softly. The legal way was slower than what he was used to but at least he would have Harry safely away from Dumbledore. “This at least will confirm that neither Lord nor Lady Potter wanted Dumbledore near their son. Have no fear my heart Harry will be staying with us”
“Harry, are you okay?” Draco asked as they lay on their backs under the warm afternoon sun. Their lesson with Nino had finished thirty minutes ago and they weren’t due to see Severus for another fifty. Draco had managed to knock the Dummies over three times in the hour after that first while Harry hadn’t even been able to get the tingle of magic back. He was upset with himself, but happy that Draco had managed it. “What did Nino want to talk to you about?”
“Where is Nino meant to be meeting us?” Draco drawled coming over and holding Harry’s hand as they stepped out of the room and joined a throng of muggles heading to the gates of the tower.
“I’m sorry, Jinx, I didn’t mean to upset you. It is just an account I read of one of the rescued Elf’s. It sounds remarkably like Dobby. I will see if I can find it again. I’m not sure how much help it will be, but it might be a good starting point” Remus suggested, and Harry smiled at the man. He hadn’t known him long and he knew that he was a werewolf, but it was already clear to him that Remus was an extremely gentle man. He still couldn’t believe that Severus and Remus were…A couple or had been at least his dad had thought so. The Dursley’s had always told him that Homosexuality was wrong and disgusting, but they had said that about a lot of things, and they hadn’t been right once.
The single bed was a lot cosier than their bed at home, but they were used to snuggling so they figured out pretty easily how to wrap their arms around each other comfortably. Draco spelled the curtains closed, complete with a privacy spell, so they were lost in their own world. The excitement of the day had made Harry tired but his trepidation about his first day of real listens refused to allow him to drift to what should be a welcome sleep.
“Why don’t we hear from Harry? He’s here, he has a voice” The auror said in a soothingly warm kind of voice speaking for the first time since they entered the room. He moved forward bowing his head politely at Jinx before kneeling down so he was eye to eye with Harry. “My name is Kingsley Shacklebolt, I am an auror...Do you know what that is Harry?”
After talking things over with his fathers Harry felt a lot better and was a hell of a lot more comfortable around them. Pansy was spending a lot more time with them and had pretty much moved into Draco’s bedroom though all three children ended up spending so much time talking late into the night that the likely hood of all three of them ending up tangled in the sheets of the same bed was high. Seamus, who was mostly going against the will of his mother, and the twins came by every chance they got on weekends and Harry was happy and surprised to know that he had such a great bunch of friends. Halloween was quickly approaching, and Harry was surprised to find that traditional Halloween or Samhain was different from the way they celebrate it in the muggle world.
Another slow chapter but I was setting up the sword which is more like a dagger I guess…I really hope that this is okay >.<
“In mum’s will to Uncle Sev, she gave him everything he needed to make a blood adoption potion. He was excited about it but hasn’t mentioned it since” Harry told the werewolf as the letter became a letter again falling down onto the table in front of them. “He didn’t really explain what it was, but I looked in Uncle Luci’s books and found it”
“Can you believe Ronald?” Pansy asked with a smirk looking over at the table where the ginger haired boy was sitting all alone. “The terrible two almost broke a rib trying not to laugh while the eldest Percy was dying of embarrassment. I thought for sure smoke was going to come out his ears!”
“Take Dobby and put him somewhere quiet please, he is rather hysterical” Lucius sighed and Severus knew that his friend wished he could just give the elf clothes but he knew too much about the Malfoy family. “The last thing Harry needs is to be left with Dobby for any length of time. Do you have to report back to Dumbledore?”
“No, Draco is just doing his best peacock impression” Harry answered continuing to grin and although Draco thought he should be offended he was just happy he had made Harry laugh.
“And it is clear they are, even from what little I saw of you together I could see he adores you, and Remus, he has always looked at you as though you hung the moon.”
“I believe that we should separate. Severus, Remus, and Harry and myself, Narcissa, and Draco. Spend an hour or two and then meet up at the Chimera enclosure, I’m sure Ninomiya would enjoy some time with her friend” Lucius said softly and although Harry didn’t want to separate from Draco he did want to spend some time with Remus and Severus. He looked at Draco who smiled and nodded squeezing his hand.
“I neither like nor dislike him, however I do believe that you should be allowed to be given a more favourable account of your father through somebody that actually liked him. Now Draco, Harry, I know that you are set to start your lessons this week but I wonder if you would like to start today? I find myself with an hour or two to spare and it would keep you both out of trouble”
“I tried Harry, believe me I did, I went to Dumbledore, but he said you had to be there. I fought and argued with him until I was blue in the face. But it was no good. If I could have I would have taken you away from there the way the Malfoy’s did” Remus slid down into the seat one hand clutching his chocolate milk and the other clutching at his chest through his robes. It was a habit Harry had noticed while he was at the school, whenever he was stressed he clutched at his chest opposite his heart.
Harry winced as he woke to an arm slapping him in the face as Draco wiggled around at his side babbling in his sleep about Chipmunks stealing his chestnuts. Harry smiled at his blonde friend and then noticed Hedwig fluffing out her feathers in an irritated manner. The snowy owls head was bobbing up and down staring pointedly at the window.
“Harry dear, are you not hungry?” Narcissa asked softly breaking into his thoughts as she touched his shoulder and Harry blinked turning to look up at her. He gave a nod and she gentle ushered him forward to the table. Draco and Lucius were standing beside the chairs and Harry was surprised wen they pulled them out for them. “Please sit, Harry, you must be hungry and he Elves have prepared many things that you should enjoy”
“Um...It is really good to see you, Harry, I was worried when Dumbledore had said you had left your aunt and uncle, not because I think you should go back there, Lils was very vocal about how you were not to be left there...” Remus hummed giving him a sad smile and Harry felt his anger prickle as he almost growled out;
“What? Seriously? Awesome!” The twins gasped knowing what they were while Harry was still studying them with a confused expression. He held them to his eyes and played about with the dials shocked when the pitch suddenly seemed to be right in front of him and he could see the woman on the bench talking to the man next to her. If he had been able to read lips, he would have been able to read what they were saying. A woman to the right of the first was munching her way through a box of pastries. Her mouth was open and when Harry pressed another button, he watched her chew on the same cake five times. It was certainly not something he was expecting to see but he couldn’t deny that it was awesome.
“Please stop apologising, dear, it was a long time ago and although it hurts, I know I will see them all again one day” She assured him taking his hand in her own as he took his letter. She squeezed his fingers and gave him a smile that seemed to remove some of the lines of years from around her eyes making her look almost as she had done in her wedding. “Read your letter, dear, there’s a good boy, I’ll read mine as well, it seems the owl is waiting for a reply” She motioned to the bird that had flown to Plum’s perch and caused the cantankerous to shift over so it could sit gracefully on it taking some water from its tray and Harry watched in amusement before taking his letter back to the table and pulling it open slowly.
“Forgiven him? And what to they have to forgive him for?” Lucius growled speaking for the first time as he moved to stand at Harry’s side his hand coming to gently rest on his shoulder stopping Harry from clawing at his neck. Harry didn’t know if it was intentional or not but somehow it was calming. “Those muggles you put him with had him sleeping in a cupboard Dumbledore”
“I see, do you carry a picture?” Narcissa knew her voice was breaking as two more dementors floated close to her, the chill they brought with them caused her blood to freeze in her veins and her mind swirled with Dark images. Images of the time she had spent in the service of the Dark Lord. The things that she had seen, the things she knew her husband to have done. Lucius had tried to shield her from the true harshness of it, but the things that she had seen would never leave her.
“I’m fine Boris! You go have fun and prove that you really are Boris the Brave” She said and slowly Boris the Brave made his way down the castle stairs and out into his courtyard where his horse was waiting for him. The groomsmen laughed as they tried to get him on the horse...Harry dear? I think it’s time you were in bed once again” Narcissa chuckled closing the book as both Harry and Draco struggled to keep their eyes open.
Draco took Harry’s hand and then tugged him from the kitchen. It was warm outside and the scent of his mother’s flowers washed over him like the sweetest perfumes. There was a small out house against the kitchen wall and Draco stopped reaching in and grabbing three of the brooms that were inside.
“Hem-hem...I am Delores Umbridge, I have been sent to oversee the examination” Her voice was harsh, simpering and nasally and there was a sneer to it that made it chilling. Harry shifted backwards until he was pressed up against Lucius’s legs. The Malfoy lord placed his hands gently on his shoulders.
“I assume that there is a copy in Gringotts, unfortunately until the Ministry officially recognises Lucius and myself as Harry’s legal guardians, we are not in a position to be able to view such a thing and Harry is a minor”
“Ah, I see” Lucius chuckled stepping out to join him on the front porch. His hand came to rest on his shoulder as his grey eyes moved around the garden. “This is my favourite time of year. As a boy like yourself I would race down each morning to build men of snow. On occasion my mother would join me, and we would make snow angels and take a ride in a sleigh carriage. Narcissa will do so with Draco and you now”
“The brownies are more comical? I would say, and they like to tell stories…In fact a lot of stories of the Brownies tell of Shadow plays” Remus explained while Jinx looked nervous her bright smile fading as she obviously wondered if he didn’t like the gift. Harry wanted to tell her that it was okay but, in all honesty, he didn’t really know what to make of the little creature with pure white hair.
“Your father would call him Dumble-dick when he thought he could get away with it and Bummedonfloor”
“Physically, you are better at the theory.” Draco gave him a friendly smile and then the entire class turned their attention to Nino who had cleared her throat holding up a hand to ask for silence.
“That is a Peryton” Severus answered with a warm chuckle “They were all but extinct in both captivity and the wild until Newt Scamander started the breeding programme. They are thinking of reintroducing them to the wilds around Hogwarts in the coming years”
“You shall be okay, Harry dear, we will look after you”  She said lightly laying her arm around his shoulders and drawing him into her body. The action seemed to be so natural on her part that Harry allowed himself to be held noting that the woman’s skin was as perfumed as the flowers in her garden only it was a warmer scent having been on her skin.
“Clearly, it is not me you should be apologising to. But I will give you back 100 of the points you have lost, the other 500 remain for sneaking out of school. I will give you a further 50 points back if you produce an essay for me on the properties of Foxglove and Wizards breath for your next lesson. Now back to school and next time think before you act” He said pointing up the drive well aware that he hadn’t even issued them with a detention. He was going soft, he thought making sure they entered the gates, it had been mere weeks since Harry had come into his life and he was going soft. There was a real possibility that when Harry arrived at Hogwarts next year he might even smile at the class. So long as his eyes didn’t start twinkling. “History of Magic is almost finished, you should head to your next class”
I promise I will be updating Classmate as soon as I can. This story is just more or less finished and I wanted fluffy, smutty Draco/Harry…Yes Harry is bottom in my story because I feel that there isn’t many bottom Harry stories for Draco/Harry and there are already many wonderful stories with Top Harry I just want to mix things up.
“Yup, just thinking. We should head to the study” He answered happily and Draco nodded taking his hand and leading him out of the room leaving the three adults to chuckle fondly. As the door closed Harry was sure that he heard Narcissa say something about ‘inseparable’ and ‘cute’.
I apologise if there are more mistakes than normal >.< my laptop decided that it wasn’t going to work anymore >.< so this is all being written on my phone while I wait to see if it can be revived...So the editing isn’t the best >.<
“You shouldn’t spoil Snowdrop so much Harry, she will keep you there for hours if you allow her” Lucius chuckled coming up behind him and Harry flushed his hands stalling on the birds back about to rush out an apology but Lucius’ expression softened “I wasn’t meaning to berate you, Harry, I was only joking. Snowdrop was hand reared and she has always been selfish when it comes to attention and she can be a rather bossy character when she doesn’t get the attention she feels that she deserves” Lucius sat down beside him on the grass completely surprising Harry with the action. The man was wearing a smart dove grey pair of breeches and a silk shirt almost like Mr Darcy from Jane Austin. His long blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail that was fixed into place with a silver clasp. “Draco told me that you were despondent about not being able to do wandless magic”
“Come on Hedwig” He whistled to his owl who liked to join him for breakfast. Mostly he was sure she liked the bacon he would slip her, but she seemed to enjoy preening his hair. Since getting her, he had learned a lot about snowy owls and was genuinely surprised that she had the colourings of a male Owl over a female snowy owl. Female snowy owls were normally much darker in colour with their wings almost appearing black while Hedwig had almost completely white wings like a male. Narcissa had commented on it as well, saying that she had expected the owl to grow out of the colouring when she matured but decided, with a laugh, that the owl had grown that way because she had liked the look of the albino peacocks and the blonde of Draco and Lucius’ hair when Hedwig had instead stayed the snowy white. For his part Harry liked that his owl was unique, and he loved watching her fly around the garden. She was much smaller than Draco’s eagle owl, but she gave him as good as she got though the pair were fast friends now often choosing to sleep curled up against one another. The owl flew and landed on his shoulder nipping affectionately at his ear as they made their way out of the bedroom.
“Yes, this is Perseus Harrison Black. Harry this gentleman is Pansy’s father Thesidious Parkinson. He attended Hogwarts with Lucius”
“Okay Harry, you and Draco can go through first” Narcissa hummed handing over the pot of powder. Draco took a handful and tugged Harry into the flames before he even had time to say goodbye to Pansy. He did give her a wave before he was whisked away by the flames. He closed his eyes against the swirls of colours that he saw holding his breath until they landed with a bump back in Lucius’ study in Malfoy Manor.
“Swish and flick, no exaggerated movements, the wand is just the extension of yourself.” Flitwick told them excitedly after explaining that they would be making feathers fly. Harry and his friends had taken up almost an entire row and were all looking at each other nervously. Hermione on the other hand was almost falling out of her chair on the opposite side of the classroom looking like she wanted to be the first to get her feather into the air. “Practice the movements a few times! Swish and Flick…No, no, Mr Finnigan, not so heavy handed, gently does it! Yes! Very good Miss Parkinson, you may attempt to combine the movements with the incantation!”
“Sorry for coming by so unexpectedly” Draco murmured offering him a sheepish smile “Mother insisted after reading the letter from Mrs Figg”
“Yup…” Harry’s voice came out almost as squeaky as Flitwick’s as he stood between the two men that were about to become his fathers. Both Remus and Severus place a hand on each his shoulders squeezing him reassuringly and Harry beamed up at them flushing as both men smiled back.
“You are, now I will do the spell from last week, okay? We’ll see if it hurts if it does you can go without it for today” She told him getting to her feet and pointing the wand at him. She murmured the spell and once again Harry’s bones felt as though the they were being pulled and squeezed but there was no pain this time. “You okay Harry?”
“Tag!” He said before turning sharply and flying away from Draco who laughed and turned sharply to follow him across the pitch. Harry felt excitement bubbling away inside of him as he was chased by the laughing Draco. Never had he had a friend so willing to play with him before, at least not one that Dudley couldn’t bully away, and he made the most of it. The two played Tag for a good half an hour before Lucius fired some sparks from his wand before getting on his own broom and flying towards them with a ball, about the same size as a football, tucked under his arm.
I’m happy that some seem interested in my original novel, I am having it proof read so that it shouldn't t contain as many mistakes as this one does! But I will be happy to share with the details when I finally go through with it.
“He wrote to me after Harry did. He said the same things to me, and said that as an old friend of his fathers I should be able to convince him to go back where he belonged and that it was for the greater good” Remus muttered somehow managing to keep the growl out of his voice though he could feel the wolf beneath the surface. The wolf had taken a liking to Harry when he had been acting as Greenfield and it had hated the smell of bruises Harry always seemed to have clinging to his body.
“It’s okay, Harry, shall I call for Jinx?” Draco asked and almost at once Harry nodded his lips giving the smallest of smiles. “Jinx!”
“I don’t know your source Potter, but they were greatly misinformed. I was engaged to Miss Greengrass, but we decided quite early on that it wasn’t what either of us wanted. And you and the Weaslette…” Draco tried but he really couldn’t stop himself from wrinkling his nose at that. He had never understood the appeal of the freckled girl though he had known that a lot of boys in his Hogwarts days had thought her beautiful. For his part she had reminded him too much of Harry’s mother and that would have been a rather disturbing coupling.
“I believe it, I saw how he was at the battle of Hogwarts, the way he looked for you. Even an idiot like me could see that he cared for you, it was the reason I spoke for him at his trial” Harry hummed, and Draco felt his mouth snap close. He had always wondered why Harry had spoken for his father that time, it wasn’t as though Lucius had done anything to deserve mercy and yet he had gotten it from both Harry Potter and Luna Lovegood…Or Luna Scamander as she was now. In fact, her testimony had been far more important in getting his father a reduced sentence then Harry’s had. She had stated in her happy dreamy way that Lucius had tried to stop most of the ill treatment of her while she was in their dungeons. Draco could only hope that was true though he did remember Lucius berating his aunt for harming children. “I heard you tore down your mansion?”
“You are too much like your Mother sometimes Harry, and Remus” The potions master sighed as the great hall started filling up. There was a sound of a throat being cleared just behind Severus’ right shoulder and Harry looked up into the stern, yet kindly, face of an older woman who was wearing a tall hat held into place with pins and a bottle green robe. She didn’t give off a grandmotherly air but there was something familiar about her. He was sure he had never met her before but there was something, a tingling feeling, that was telling him he should know her. “Perhaps you would like a cough drop for your throat Minerva?”
“Oh, I though perhaps you would care to introduce your quests, Severus? After all you seem to be causing quite the stir?” The woman said not in the least put out by Severus’ tone. Her accent was thick with a Scottish twang, something that Harry had heard only in movies before and he nervously hopped from one foot to the other suddenly aware that they were the centre of attention. Almost all the school were staring in confusion. The only ones who weren’t were the students that he had met at various meetings within Malfoy Manor, they were giving them friendly waves while whispering to their friends clearly informing those that didn’t know that he was Snape’s son.
“Don’t worry, ‘Arry, I don’t understand ‘Ow it works either but Hogwarts is full of them and they always help you go where you need to be if you ask them nicely” Hestia said from were she was walking behind them her hands in the pockets of her robes. Knowing that an adult didn’t know how they worked made Harry feel better and he was glad when Draco pulled him to one last door and pushed it open.
“I think we should go” Harry whispered tugging at Remus’ arm his face bright red and his ears burning brightly as snaky laughter filled his ears. He didn’t understand fully what the snake was talking about, but it wasn’t hard to guess. Severus followed with a lifted black eyebrow and between laughing Remus explained about the snake.
“An odd duck, my son, he took more after my witch Mother than I did, took her name and went to Hogwarts, very proud of him” He said rubbing the thin white hair on his head. “Now, after all that excitement there is some formalities. Some tokens that need to be given out as the beneficiary of the estate it is up to you or your guardian. Your mother left a letter and a small box of personal items to a Mr Severus Snape. Your father left some money to a Mr Remus Lupin as well as a letter. To your guardian, whomever it may be, there is a letter...”
“I will always be on your side, Dray, but you also have Pans, Seamus, and the twins…” Harry smiled snuggling more into his friend resting his head against his chest so he could listen to the sound of his heart. It was a comforting steady sound, and he allowed the steadiness of it to regulate his own heartbeat and allow it to soothe away his anxiety. “But I still wish people could know the real you. You and Aunt Cissy and Uncle Luci…”
“Dobby shoulds be punishes! Dobby spoke bad about Masters but Dobby needs to save Harry potter!” Dobby wailed as he continued to hit his head against the frame until their was a twin pop and two elves Harry didn’t recognise appeared. Both of them seemed to have a bloody nose and they silently stunned Dobby and wrapped ropes around him.
“I hope I won’t disturb you as I practice.” Harry hummed but there was only an answering snore from the snake. Chuckling to himself he looked up at his bed and Draco who had rolled onto his side with his head propped on his hand. The blonde’s face was unreadable, and Harry swallowed a nervous lump. “Are you alright, Dray?”
“You’re an idiot Potter, are you a wizard or not? Since when does that matter...?” Draco scoffed as they sat together in a wine bar after having a rather pleasant lunch. Although he didn’t keep a tally Harry knew that he had been spending more time with the blonde since returning to the UK than he had Ron and Hermione. Which wasn’t all that strange given that his friends had just had their first child and he and Draco were both single with more free time. He knew that the press had noticed, and more and more reports were showing up, but Harry ignored them. He refused to feel bad about his friendship with Draco. Spending time with him had proven to be both fun and relaxing. Draco had a dry, biting personality much like Snape and his commentary of people they saw always had Harry having to fight to hold in an ugly snort of laughter. “You’re a wizard you have magic...Make it bigger on the inside than it is on the inside.”
“Remus!” He gasped with happiness looking at his friend. Remus Lupin was a wolf shifter, he lived most of his life out in the forbidden forest outcast from polite society for being a lone wolf. He was an Omega, stolen when he was only a babe and forced to mate with a savage beast named Fenrir Greyback. For almost twenty years Remus had suffered under his mate and his pack until one day he had slain the alpha as he slept, after Fenrir had tried to snatch another child Omega because Remus had failed time and time again to produce an heir. Remus hadn’t been punished for his crime, but he had not been accepted back into society either, people looked at him with suspicion and scorn treating him no better than a rabid dog, but Harry had grown to like him. Remus was kind and gentle even with the life he had lived, and he would spend hours in the forests with him when he was collecting firewood. He had taught him about plants, herbs, and the magic of words. Nobody else had bothered teaching him to read or write however Remus had carefully taught him, first by writing in the mud in the forest and then by sneaking him books to read.
“It’s part of the experience, Harry, trust me, you’ll enjoy it. You meet up with all your friends that you haven’t likely seen over summer break. I promise that you’ll enjoy it. You’re meeting Seamus and the twins, right?” Remus said kindly squeezing his shoulder and Harry nodded swallowing down a thick lump from the back of his throat as he watched a girl with long bushy hair being helped onto the first carriage by people that were clearly her parents. “Come on, let’s get your things into a carriage.” They were just about to pick up Harry’s trunk and Hedwig’s cage when a blur of red came into their line of sight. Two faces he recognised and two that he didn’t.
“Save your lecture, I have already decided to let the past remain where it is and while being with his son I have come to accept that there was blame on both sides but you do not know all...” Severus swallowed sliding the letter back to his friend as he felt the acidic burn in the back of his throat. Many thought the reason for his hate of Black and Potter was the prank Black had pulled and it was but not for the reason they thought much in the same way people were mistaken in his feelings for Lily. He had loved her, still did, but only as the sister he had longed to have. Before he could confess more to Lucius the door to the breakfast room opened and Harry came in smiling happily but sleepily as he saw him.
“Is that a good thing?” Draco asked curiously as the snake reached the edge of the enclosure and rose up revealing a yellow belly. The tongue flicked a few more times as a strange hissing came from Harry. The hissing didn’t appear to be random and he could only guess that this was the snake language. He had been too young to remember Voldemort in the war but his father had told him reluctantly that the man would often talk exclusively in parsel as it put the death eaters on edge. There was something curious about Harry speaking it though, it didn’t sound threatening but almost musical as though he was laughing as he spoke. “Harry?”
“Just stay with us and run when we tell you…” George winked pulling something out of his own pocket. It was thin and long with a cord on one end. Harry didn’t recognise it, but Draco hissed out a breath.
“I…I would like…Ice cream…Please…” Harry nodded seeing the concerned and confused expression that was coming over both their faces. “Just…Um…I called you…Dad…I’m sorry, if that’s weird…”
“Of course, I will check the lunar cycle” Narcissa informed him with a wave of the hand “And we will have to arrange it around school, the boys will both be in Hogwarts by then”
“I’ll come with. Might see if Pants and Irish are about.” Draco got up from the bed and stretched in a cat like manner with his arms lifted above his head before he dragged his fingers through his hair. They were just making their way out the door when Pointer muttered,
“I...Um...Sorry...” Harry apologised quickly dragging his hand through his messy hair making it even more of a mess than normal. Draco’s pale eyebrows drew together as he pursed his lips asking in a clipped tone;
“I want to get better at flying” Draco stated with a shrug finishing his chocolate drink before looking at the clock on the wall. It was almost midnight and they were expecting Kingsley a minute after to douse the log. Severus was no longer able to be the first guest as he as good as lived here with Remus and Harry now. Kingsley had been honoured to be asked and had agreed immediately as his family didn’t practice the custom.
“From you I take your words as the greatest compliment. You may have spoiled Draco, but he has grown into a loving friend and fierce protector” Severus said the words as a joke but there was real feeling behind them. The Malfoy’s to the outside world were cold, emotionless, like stone statues but if anyone could see them as Severus saw them, they would know it was a lie.
“Um. Goodbye” Harry whispered feeling confused as the serpent slithered off to find another rock to lay on and get some heat from. He turned to his parents flushing ever so slightly at the expressions on their faces. Remus looked curious, amber eyes alert and questioning, while Severus was tight his lips drawn together tightly. “Sorry”
“Better, I am so…” Harry started but the taller boy came over and held his shoulders his light grey blue eyes staring into his green ones as he cut him off.
The story of the Winter Witch, Summer King, Spring Bride, and Autumn Knight is the story of Paganism my group follows with the addition of the Child of Magic beginning the origin of Witches and Wizards. It is a beautiful story really, I only gave a quick rundown of the story here. All Pagan groups have their own legends, this is my groups 😊 Sorry for the long delay I haven’t forgotten this story but I got caught up in painting again and watching Supernatural from the start again but I promise that I will upload more quickly in future.
“That is what Bella said” Narcissa answered looking weaker than he had ever seen her. She was wearing a thick robe around her shoulders and a fire lit but she was still shuddering with the chill that came from being near Dementors. Remus had force fed her chocolate and had Jinx make some hot chocolate, but it had done little good. “I have repeated it word for word, Severus. Horcruxes. The Dark Lord has torn his soul apart more than once”
“A little too much force in your movements and wording, Mr Finnigan. Charms is a gentle magic; all spells are meant to be done with the gentlest of movements. Charms is the most instinctive of magics and solely the branch of magic that most needs a wand” As he spoke Flitwick was handling his own wand, a long willowy one with ornate decorations around the handle. Wordlessly he drew symbols in the air and caused bright sparks and showers of petals to fly all around. Making some bigger movements had them bursting with pops and smoke. “The slightest over think or exaggerated hand movement and poof! Just as Mr Finnigan has so delicately shown. Now, I think we should end our lesson here while Mr Finnigan still has some of his eyebrows. For your homework assignment I want you all to visualise a feather floating and practice your wand movements. Ah Miss Granger, Mr Lupin-Snape, for your excellent demonstration take ten points apiece. Well done.”
“Excuse me sir, but what’s curious?” Harry asked as Remus and Severus checked him over. Ollivander took the broken wand and put it down on the counter amongst the open boxes and papers.
“Shame not everyone is blown over by your mere presence, Potter” A voice grumbled from behind their backs and Harry didn’t even have to turn around to know that it was Ron. The boy had been outcast from Slytherin house during lesson, even getting points for them had done little to stop the scowls he was getting but Ron didn’t seem to care. The Slytherin emblem on his robes had been picked at until it was frayed, how that had happened in only a night Harry couldn’t understand, and his tie looked scorched. “Guess even your name can’t make people like you Malfoy.”
“It is a Black family name, it comes from Heracles” Narcissa hummed from the front turning to look back at them over her shoulder. “James’ mother was a Black so it makes sense that they would honour her with Heracles but being the modern people they were keeping it simple by just calling the boy Harry”
“Okay! I can do that!” Draco announced lifting his hands and straining as he focused on his masked dummy. Nothing happened though Harry was positive he felt a cooling in the air at his side. He watched Draco for a moment or two willing him to do it before he lifted his own hands and focused. He had never pushed anyone over before, but he had been pushed lots of times. It didn’t take a lot to knock somebody down, not really. Feeling a little foolish with his hands in the air he closed his eyes and tried to focus.
“Do you yield?” Severus asked pointing his wand at Lucius’ throat. His stance and expression were completely different to normal. Harry thought that he should have feared it, but as he could see a playful smile on the potion master’s lips, he was relaxed. Harry had inched forward his green eyes enraptured by the duel that had just taken place. He didn’t fully understand everything that he had just witness but he was positively tingling with excitement. Lucius dropped his wand and held up his hands laughing as he hummed
“Harry, his name is Harry and he is Heir to the family Black. His godfather is Sirius Black and as he is in no position to take care of him then I, as the last head of House Black am legally his guardian” Narcissa was calm, or at least she was pretending to be, and Harry was almost certain that the auror’s lips twitched just a little but it was so quick he might have imagined it. “As for what you are implying, my husband was cleared of all charges, he was under a compulsion spell and was not responsible for his actions, this was found by the highest court in the wizarding world or are you saying that your judgement is superior?”
“Of course” Remus nodded and with another jerk of his head Severus swept out of the bird room with his robes bellowing out behind him. “I would love to know how he does that”
“Harry, urgh…You’re up early” Draco yawned, his voice still muffled by the pillow and Harry flashed him a guilty smile. It might be strange for people to know that they shared a bed still, but they had tried to sleep separate and Harry had had a nightmare and screamed until his voice was raw. He never had the dreams when Draco was next to him and since then Draco had stayed by his side.
“Huh? Oh, yes, Harry, I’m fine. The potion your dad makes does wonders, but I am still a little tired.”
“You’re welcome” Harry smiled shyly as Draco pressed a kiss to his scar before taking his hand and almost dragging him the rest of the way to Nino’s home. The door was open as they reached it and together, they stepped inside. Sho was sitting on the sofa surrounded by a stack of papers. He looked up and smiled as he saw them.
Please, Please trust me when I say that Covid is not a joke. Yes, some people get it and it is just a cold but others get it and die. Please stay safe out there.
However he kept a tight rein on his emotions and kept that expression off his face for as long as it took for him to enter the Duelling room and find the entire Malfoy family and Harry punching duelling dummies in the shapes of the Dursley family. All were laughing and celebrating each other, and Severus took in the happy sight with a slightly gapped mouth and wide eyes. Lucius. His oldest friend still living, Lord of the Malfoy family, who never did anything that might cause him to break a sweat, currently had his shirt sleeves rolled up giving the fat face of Vernon Dursley a rather splendid right hook, while his wife, delicate and beautiful Narcissa Malfoy, a lady so well bred the Queen of England would probably curtsy when meeting her, was laughing as she sent a stern kick into the middle of Petunia whooping with genuine delight when the dummy was sent flying across the room.
“Nino said that it was because I was happy and safe here” Harry mumbled knowing that it was the truth. He had never been happier than he had been with the Malfoy’s and he hoped that they would never want him to leave.
“You look very cute” Draco said ruffling his hair with his fingers and Harry felt shy his stomach doing strange fluttering things. “Come on, prepare yourself, if you think Pants is bad wait till you meet her father he is beyond anything she is”
“Prince Draco Lucius the first, it has a nice ring to it, I think” Draco lifted his thin pointed nose to the air puffing out his chest as Harry dissolved into a fit of laughter that finally caused Pansy and his mother to turn away from the horned pythons they were studying to look at them. Pansy looked curious while his mother looked happy.
“James once said that he had a distant family member that was one” Remus hummed thoughtfully “But I have a strong feeling that his ability may be linked to the scar more than family connection, however I don’t understand how it is all connected”
“That sounds incredibly dangerous, I hope that you will not be planning on copying such a thing” Severus said firmly looking at both Harry and Draco and then finally the twins. He still found them to be unsufferable pests, but even he had to admit they had found a very small place into his heart and had latched on without intending to let go. After a loud promise of never trying such a dangerous thing all five children started talking at once telling them about the game and the meal afterwards. The chatter of excited children, of Harry looking so young and innocent, reminded him of why they were doing this and it renewed his determination to find the Horcruxes, whatever they may be, and destroy them before they could ruin the happiness of his son. Remus was chatting happily with the children now, his face alight in a way that Severus hadn’t seen since his days in Hogwarts and Severus watched him carefully, admiring how the years seemed to fall away and he was once again the boy with flopping tawny hair that would always cover one eye. His shirt always untucked, and his robe always creased as though he had fallen asleep in it.
“Harry, while I am speaking with your aunt why don’t you show Draco your room?” Lucius asked carefully and although he frowned Harry started walking to his cupboard.
“I need to speak with Lupin privately, but I would be happy to be your father, Harry” The words were gently said and Harry felt his eyes burn with happy tears before he jerked forward and wrapped his arms around his neck breathing in the spicy scent of potions. Severus was still against him for a moment before he relaxed and gave him an awkward hug his large hooked nose pressing awkwardly into his neck. The sound of Jinx blowing her nose into her pillowcase broke the moment and Harry gave a little laugh aware that his own eyes were suspiciously damp as he pulled away from Severus. He was genuinely surprised to see that Severus was looking a little flushed with emotion and although he was not tearing up his eyes were shinier than they normally were. “The potion is simple enough and thanks to your mother I have all I need. I could have it ready by this weekend. However, I do believe that Remus and I should speak before then”
“Yes, it was either this or the piano and I was rubbish at the piano” Draco gave another shrug, this one more convincing at it being no big deal. “Its no big deal”
Ron, dear-me, Ronnikins in the Snake house…was that a bit of a shock? I promise there is a reason I changed it…>.< I don’t hate Ron, but he was always so blinded…>.<
“Draco, over here” An unfamiliar voice said and Harry turned nervously to see two boys the same age as them standing to one side of the store. The one that had spoken was dark skinned with sculpted features that he hadn’t quite grown into yet but he would. Harry imagined that when he was older he would have the chiselled looks of one of the Greek statues he had seen photos of in school books. His eyes were a chocolate brown with a bored expression his arms folded over the expensive clothes he was wearing. While the other boy was thin and lanky for his age. His skin was ashen white and there were purple bags under each eye. His hair was jet black however and his eyes were so blue they were almost unreal.
“You’ll have to forgive, Ai-baka…He gets a little carried away when he’s with his animals plus he gets nervous and awkward when dealing with humans” Nino chuckled as Masaki marched away leaving them to follow behind at a softer more sedate pace. “Harry, I told Masaki about your problem with wandless magic and he offered to come by tomorrow and show you some tricks he used. You and he have different reasons for not being able to do it, but it will help you I think”
“The snake, she thinks you smell nice like warm rocks” Harry said softly and Draco noticed the way the snake had unfurled itself and was sliding over the rocks to the edge of the enclosure towards them. Draco tried his best not to take a step back. He had read the information and knew it wasn’t toxic but it was rather large and the way its muscles were moving under its skin was enough to cause his heart to jump in his chest.
“You should” Remus agreed but didn’t make to remove his head from his arm and Severus didn’t try to make him. He supposed that he could breakfast here and then head back to Hogwarts for his first lesson. The bed was extremely comfortable after all and Remus was warm pressed against him. As if knowing what was going through his head Remus chuckled again and pressed back against him and Severus knew for sure that he wouldn’t be leaving. At least not yet. His eyes once again resting on the peaceful face of the werewolf he let out a contented sigh. Soon he would have the weight of the world on his shoulders again, there were plans to be made, Horcruxes to be sought, but for now he wanted to enjoy a peaceful moment with his…Lover. “You’re thinking very loud, Sev’ you’re ruining what should be a perfect moment…What is going around in that big brain of yours?”
“Yes, Father, Yes, Uncle Lucius” Harry and Draco said together and the older blonde nodded smartly and then moved out of the bedroom leaving them alone as soon as Rocky and Jinx had popped away taking the remains of Harry and Lucius’ midnight snacks away. “It appears that you and father had a fun night”
“I highly doubt that Mr Potter, forgive me, I haven’t introduced myself properly, I am Lucius Malfoy, Draco’s father” Lucius held out a gloved hand and Harry hesitated only a fraction of a second before reaching out to take it whispering;
“I was thinking about lessons…And what the other students will be like. Will they all be like Albright? I hate it when people pick on you because of your name.”
“I’m sorry” Harry shifted in the bed turning until they were nose to nose. His body was still tense but Draco was sure that he was starting to relax. Draco let his hand move up and down his side slowly in what he hoped was a soothing way. Harry didn’t seem to mind and he continued slowly saying;
“Youse is to not being frighten, Little Master Harry! Jinxes gotten you!” Jinx squeaked at his side her little hand gripping his while the other patted him gently. It was strange that such a strange and oddly shaped creature could make him feel so safe but she did. Harry gave her a little smile squeezing her hand while Lucius and Narcissa stood in front of him. Although Draco had said they weren’t royal they seemed to be as regal as the queen in Buckingham palace though far more beautiful. They were like the Dursley’s believed themselves to be though the Dursely’s would never have been able to even dream about owning a house like this. It was huge, bigger than anything he had ever seen and beautifully decorated. “Youse is a good boy little Master! Jinxes and Malfoys looken after youse!”
“Also a little nervous.” Harry confessed as the witch began to measure from under his armpit down to his knees.
“Why not go to the ministry?” Draco asked the next question that had come to Harry’s lips and the sandy haired man let out a twisted bitter laugh.
“Moony, I know that I haven’t earnt the right for a father title yet so Moony is good” Remus answered happily and Harry nodded swallowing a lump down from the back of his throat aware that they were standing in the middle of a zoo. They might not be the most interesting things around them, but the seriousness of the situation was drawing more than a few curious gazes. “So, Ice Cream and then Kelpies?”
“Alright, I’ll head out, you cover me” Harry said pushing his head out of the igloo and looking around. Slowly he moved his way further out and then Draco followed quickly grabbing some of the snowballs they had pilled together. There were no signs of his parents, but he knew better than to be complacent. Harry looked around a few times and then ran forward and Draco had to admit that he was fast, even on the soft snow but he didn’t have time to admire him as he soon had to start pelting snowballs at his mother and father who had appeared from behind the hedges.
“You should watch yourself, Malfoy, slumming with blood traitors and half-bloods” The one addressed as Grub snarled pointing to the twins and Seamus.
They walked quickly over the marble floored hotel entrance and spoke to a beautiful woman who was stood behind the desk. She looked too beautiful to be real. Her hair was a silvery blonde, even lighter than Draco’s while her eyes were a very pale blue. She seemed to tinkle like a bell when she laughed she ushered them to a large fireplace.
“Please don’t apologise, your ideal place sounds so nice that Draco and I would love to visit. Do you remember where...” Narcissa asked when the door and bridge were finally almost open and she had to admit to being almost bewildered by the answer Harry gave.
“Not today, today I am taking my…Harry to the zoo at the tower of London and Lucius has gotten us a table to celebrate”
“Dear Draco, thank you so much your present! I loved it! I don’t have any of the books, in fact I didn’t have any books about the magical world. I didn’t know it was real, I always thought that magic was just in stories” Draco blinked at those words unable to understand how Harry Potter couldn’t know about magic. It didn’t seem believable that Harry would be brought up in the muggle world. “My family doesn’t like me even talking about magic, my neighbour Mrs Figg is a squib, but I didn’t know until she caught me reading the book you gave me. She let me borrow her owl to send this letter. Sorry for rambling...Um...If you want to write back, can you send your letters to Mrs Figg? Sorry, if you don’t want to write...”
“Please! Please don’t hurt me! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I won’t do it again! I will leave...” He whimpered shivering as he held himself tightly rocking back and forth. For a moment nobody in the room moved and then all at once everything happened. Severus yelped as he was magically thrown across the room while Lucius let out a shout;
“Surprising, huh? About Uncle Sev’ and Lupin. I never would have imagined that Severus would have had a boyfriend”
“Ten Knuts its Slytherin” Draco said but Harry shook his head. To those that didn’t know her Pansy was stereotypically a Slytherin, which was perfectly fine, but Harry had the feeling that she had more in her than that. “Her whole family have been in Slytherin.”
“So today we’re going to be studying history of world magic. Since I promised I would teach more Japanese history this year I brought you some books” She announced motioning to the books on the table in front of them. “The first thing I want to teach you is about Umeda Mai, who was the founder of Mahotokoro which is currently on the island of Minami Iwo Jima and then you can try a little wandless magic”
“Sometimes it is just the thing needed to settle some tension” Severus hummed “May I perhaps attempt at punching one?”
“Without consent! You uncouth, unmannered swine!” Draco spat moving Harry slowly behind him before moving closer to the angry older boy who was just growing ever more angry. Patrons and staff were edging towards them as boxes around them started to shake.
“Harry, I hear that you have become friends with the Weasley twins. The very best of families the Weasley’s” Dumbledore mused talking over Lucius as though he was an annoying bug he could swat away with the back of his hand. To Harry’s astonishment Lucius’ mouth snapped closed and he realised that something wasn’t right. His eyes moved to Narcissa and Severus and saw that they had the same glassy expressions “Honest, hardworking, a true light family. They have another son your age, Ronald I believe, maybe you would like to write to him? Perhaps, make friends with him before school starts. It will be good for you to have friends before you attend Hogwarts. I’m sure your parents would approve…”
Boy was a servant from the village beyond the Forbidden forest Draco had met him by chance one summers day when his horse had thrown a shoe and he had taken a tumble in the middle of the Forbidden Forest.
“What an awful child you are” Lucius snapped coldly his hand resting on Harry’s shoulder. Harry stiffened at the touch not used to people touching him without pain but Lucius was gentle.
“And you could understand it?” Draco gasped clutching at his whisky glass and staring in shock. Even now he could remember Voldemort talking to that hideous snake of his. He shuddered just for a moment before assuring himself that Harry was in no way like that man.
“You are lucky you weren’t seriously harmed. Come, I will lead you out of the forest it is not a safe place for you to be” Boy spoke seriously, and Draco nodded. His father, the bravest man he knew, had told him tales of the forest and the creature that lived deep in the darkest parts. A foul creature known as Voldemort who sapped the life force of anyone unfortunate enough to get too close. His mother had said there were nice things in the forest too. Fairy Folk who would guide good children out.
“Like Draco is?” Harry pointed out looking at his blonde friend who was smiling just a little. “It doesn’t make him love Uncle Luci any less”
“Yes, mother, I was thinking of sending him some more books, I have some of those old Quidditch books I thought he might enjoy”
Transfiguration was an enjoyable subject. McGonagall was firm but fair and for most of the lesson had them working on changing a toothpick to a needle. She would sweep through the classroom every so often correcting their hand positions and praising those that managed it even slightly. Neville, a Hufflepuff boy, really didn’t seem to be having much luck on his own and he was growing an interesting shade of red. Harry and Draco were working together and Harry grinned happily at his friend when he saw that Draco’s toothpick was now a metallic colour.
“Dobby found his way into Harry’s room this morning, will you put a ward over the room Dobby is in please to stop him from getting out? I will get a healer from Saint Mungo’s to see to him as soon as possible” Lucius asked gently sitting back down and Jinx was soon bobbing her head up and down.
“Little Master Harry, sirs! Youse is quite alrights! How is youse? Youse is feeling better after sleepings?” The elf asked brightly getting up and looking him over. Her gnarled hand rested on the small ten year olds cheek worrying at her lip while looking him in the eye. “Master Severus was very naughty! But Mistress Narcisssa and Master Lucius will looks after youse from now on! No more bad memories for Little Master Harry!”
“And I will do more. I have the money and my lawyers are having fun. Just accept it and let’s carry on. It is growing late and in the morning we will have much to do”
“You have your own bed as well, Dray, yet you sleep with Harry every night. What are you going to do when we are in Hogwarts? If you are in different houses?”
“Youse is to be stayings aways from Little Master Harry, Dumbles of Hoggywarts” The elf said sternly holding herself up to her full height her hands on her hips, or at least Harry thought they were on her hips it was difficult to tell for certain. He smiled at the protective elf as Draco squeezed his hand. Dumbledore took a step back looking completely mystified by her reaction before he smiled and said in a bright tone;
“Hadrian, we need to fetch your wand, and then Pansy has to choose an owl.” Remus reminded him and Harry nodded putting the ‘Advanced charms’ book back onto the shelf.
“No!” Draco, Remus, and Jinx said together loudly causing Harry to jump and then let out a little moist giggle his eyes shiny again. Draco moved forward and moved to wrap his arms around his friend before stopping and asking;
“Fuck off you fag! I ain’t no fucking pansy…” Blackmore threw himself at Diggory but the Hufflepuff was faster, and the boy stumbled over his own feet soon ending up in a heap on his nose without Diggory having to do anything. The students that were lingering in the hall watching laughed.
“Hey, Harry! Did you know that the most famous pirate in the world was a wizard? Blackbeard!” Draco said with more excitement than somebody should when talking about one of the worst pirates. Harry didn’t know much about him or pirates in general, but it seemed that Draco was a huge pirate buff. They were in Madam Aguillard’s boutique, an expensive costume shop that didn’t have anything on the rack but was all custom made, in a small village in the South of France. From the outside the shop appeared to be a small disused charity shop with broken nic-nacs in the windows but once inside it opened into a beautiful costume shop with plush chairs and sketches of past costumes on the walls. Women and men of all ages were bustling around with the harried customers seeking the best in store designers. Harry and Draco had been given Miss and Mr Aguillard, the boutique owners own children to fuss over them. Draco was easy in their opinion as he knew what he wanted Harry had just shrugged deciding to let them pick out a costume for him. “It was how he always managed to have the tips of his beard alight!”
“I didn’t even know you existed. I didn’t know anything about my parents until Draco wrote to me. The Dursley’s told me that my father was a drunk and a dead beat and he and mum died in a car crash...”
“What are you all doing out here?” The fat monk said with a happy sort of voice smiling at them fondly while Nick looked at them all and beamed.
“…No…” Harry shrugged, he hadn’t given it that much thought but when he did, he didn’t find it gross, not like the thought of Remus and Severus.
“Oh” Harry hummed as Gabriel Aguillard smoothed out some white fabric against his back while a quill sketched in a small notebook against his ear. The man had already rejected three of his own designs before speaking in hurried French to his sister. “I’m sorry…”
“Maybe because you’re enough of a romantic old fool that you would ride on the back of one and have it take you off”
“Not all, just those that deserve it. Students that pay attention have no need to fear. But he blew up three cauldrons. Three, you would think after the first he would have listened to instruction but no he went on to destroy a further two. I have no time for careless students, Rem” Severus growled as he licked his ice cream and Harry listened to them as he ate his own thinking how much like parents they already seemed to be.
“Yes, his parents were death eaters and proud. The kid is barely old enough to blow his own nose and the last I heard people were treating him as though he was V-Voldemort’s right hand man. Even with the years that have passed the war is fresh in people’s memories and we will have to live with that” Draco spluttered just a little at saying the name and gripped his forearm tightly as though the mark burned. Harry noticed and filed away the name Stonebroke before changing the subject to hopefully happier things as he asked.
“I believe so too” Kingsley said with a rolling hum taking the photo back and slipping it back into its slot in his coin purse. As they had been talking they had travelled up the long drive from the gates to the main building of Azkaban itself and the door swung open to reveal a portly man dressed in the dull black and grey uniform of the guards of Azkaban. Narcissa had seen him at a few ministry functions but she had never liked him. She had always believed that anyone who would choose to be a guard in Azkaban couldn’t be the nicest of people and Gordon Dobble the fourth proved that. He was slick like grease with a smirking smile that sent more waves of chills down her spine than the Dementors. However, he was human and Narcissa knew how to deal with them. She smiled her blind, forced polite smile inclining her head as he came forward his hand, shiny with sweat and black with dirt reaching out to hers.
“Urgh! Dray! They are my parents!” He whined and Draco let out a snort of dry laughter obviously delighting in the awkward flush that had snuck up into Harry’s face and the awkwardness that had been brought about by the thought of Severus and Remus going at it.
“My heart, I have summoned the arours, they will be here soon” Lucius said and Narcissa nodded and Draco blinked as her wand appeared in her hand and she was sending a hex towards the muggles. Large painful looking boils immediately appeared over their exposed skin and Draco knew that they would be extremely painful but given that their mouths were glued shut they couldn’t let out more than muffled grunts. “Narcissa”
“I get too sick, plus I like the feeling of being on a broom, and I wasn’t alone, my fiancé was with me. We made a holiday of it...At least when he wasn’t covering Quidditch games”
“It’s a mix…Of four kinds of wood. Holly, Yew, Oak, and Elder wood…” Harry explained remembering everything the wand maker had said about his wand. He was fond of it and couldn’t help but admire the spirals of different coloured woods that seemed to fit together seamlessly so they looked like one whole. “The core is phoenix feather…”
“I know, but it remains prudent that we should act with caution, my heart, I would not have somebody saying our Draco was trying to corrupt the young Potter”
“He made mistakes, but he lives with them and tries to be better. He sat with me a read the Tale of Boris the Brave last night and he was worried that he couldn’t do the voices” Harry snorted happily trying his best to get the werewolf to see how Lucius was. He had a feeling that Remus wanted to trust the Malfoy’s, but he was doubtful because of everything that had happened before. At his admission of Lucius Malfoy sitting reading bedtime stories Remus let out a bark of laughter.
“I know that it would change my Magical core, the part of my DNA that connects me to magic. In magic I would become your child…Or the child of the person who drank it with me”
“Suck on that and it will help, I promise” He told him before popping one into his own mouth and Harry gave a weak smile and took the offered sweet. “I have never enjoyed floo travel either, however it is quick” The fire flared and Remus and Draco stepped out neither looking ruffled at all. Draco hurried over to him his grey eyes concerned.
Ive had a bad few weeks, I told you my mum was moving in and life didn’t really want to go my way. My mum and I have always had a difficult relationship and yeah, losing my dad hasn’t helped and then there is everything else that comes with somebody dying. My mum hasn’t been able to handle any of it and I have had to step up and do it all and yeah, it sucks. But I am back and I will try and get back to posting regularly!
After scraping their books back into their bags, the class bustled out of the room chattering away to themselves. Harry overheard Hermione lecturing another Gryffindor girl about the correct pronunciation of the spell, but he tuned her out for the most part focusing instead on the conversation his friends were having.
“Mother and Father did most of the saving…” Draco grumbled dismissively, and Harry let out a soft laugh pressing himself further into Draco’s chest. Draco was probably right, he didn’t need the world to know what a wonderful boy he was, but Harry wished, and wished that people would see it. His eyes stayed closed and before he knew it, he was drifting into a strange dream where he was wearing the odd purple turban the muggle studies teacher had worn. It was telling him repeatedly that he should be in Slytherin house and that he had made a big mistake. The more he argued with the turban the heavier and tighter it became until he was clawing at his face and thrashing around on the three-legged stool, he was sitting in. “Harry, Harry…Sush…You’re okay, it’s just me…Wake up…You’re dreaming…” Draco called soothingly shaking him awake and Harry blinked slowly shaking away the residue of sleep from his eyes aware that a thin strand of pale light was now coming in through the curtains. It was too weak to be the sun, but it seemed impossibly bright to be the moon.
“I liked it” The snake hissed from around his throat and Harry was about to respond when he heard a shuffling of feet from the door to the bedroom. Looking up he saw two of his new roommates, Albright and Pointer, standing there. He had no idea how long they had been there, but he felt a wave of self-conscious panic wash over him as he tried to quickly put his guitar away.
“I...Okay...” Harry nodded seemingly only just realising that he hadn’t yet let go of Draco’s hand. He dropped it quickly as though he had been stung pale cheeks turning red as he stepped back into the house and motioned for them to follow.
“They only know basic things, almost like your accidental magic. Their families help them focus it  and keep it under control but for the most part…I guess you could say they are almost like muggles. They just have a little extra boost. Honestly, I can’t really explain it as well as I would like. My father is a natural magic user and he works a 9 to 5 job in a busy muggle company. The most he uses magic for is ironing his suits if he is in a hurry” Nino flashed them both a grin shrugging “I’m just glad my mum sent me to the school.   As neither of you have wands yet, and you are not allowed them until next year, I will be teaching you some basic wandless magic. I have spoken to your healer Harry and it won’t affect your recovery” Nino smiled getting them both to stand up and follow her out of the study and into a vast room that was sparsely decorated and painted in a plain white.
“Mr Dumbledore, please stay silent or I shall have the guards remove you, the Goblins of Gringotts are not simple fools that will standby as you act as though the sun only raises and sets because of your bidding” Tormuld snapped clicking his long gnarled fingers together and binding Dumbledore to the chair that he had transfigured. “We are aware of the events of the last war of wizards, and we   know more of the deeds than many would like to be known, but we also remember the war that came before and what happened then...” Narcissa felt her curiosity increase as the Goblin seemed to smirk at Dumbledore who had stopped his frantic pulling at the invisible ropes about him. She knew only some of what had happened during the wizarding war with Grindlewald, her parents had actually stood against him seeing the insanity in his actions, but whatever it was the Goblins had seemed juicy as Dumbledore had paled until he was almost the same shade as his beard. “But we do not care to remember the past mistakes of our clients. You have a right to call for an independent to test this spell. Who would you have me call?”
“I’m Martha Rose! Boys! You know nothing! She was my great-grandmother! She started the flapper movement!”
“I can’t believe he has a life outside Hogwarts! He must be a strict dad, right?” A third student asked through a mouthful of potatoes and Harry felt Draco tensing at his side and could see the way he was holding his knife like a weapon now.
“You and Remus, you are a couple?” He wanted to fight against it but he could feel the truth potion forcing him to answer, giving even more information than he had wanted to share.
“What a downright awful family” Draco said fuming for his friend. Narcissa raised an eyebrow but stayed silent and Draco continued his letter.
“It is up to you Harry, but if you do decide to listen to Severus then rest assured that we will be just beyond the door” Narcissa smiled as the boy turned to look at her “And Jinx of course will defend you”
“Sir!” Harry squeaked flushing brightly as his eyes flew open. His eyes went to Delores first and then Narcissa and Mrs Figg and the healer gave a small chuckle.
“Of course, Uncle Sev’ it’s really fun” Harry agreed his green eyes sparkling like new leaves of a tree in spring. He had thought they were just like Lily’s when he had first seen them but now, he could tell that they were all Harry.
“I didn’t know. Not until Dumbledore and Hagrid came to my Mas…Uncle and Aunts home two weeks ago and told me I had to leave” Harry answered honestly nervously tugging at the expensive fitted clothes he was wearing his green eyes moving nervously around the ballroom. It was only then that Draco remembered they weren’t alone, and that hundreds of people were listening in trying to understand what was happening between their prince and the young lord. “I’m sorry, I left a note with Moony…”
“Madam are you trying to insult me?” Tobias hissed his whole posture and tone changing as he stared at the toad shaped woman whose beady eyes widened with mock surprise as she slapped a hand over her mouth but still Tobias continued “Are you perhaps implying that I don’t know what I am doing? You may consider me to be old Madam but I can assure you that I am not yet senile”
URGH! I’m sorry for coming back with such a weak chapter but this was set up before I went on my unexpected hiatus and I didn’t want to change it but I am truly sorry that it might be boring! More good stuff is coming!
“Lord Potter. It is an honour to see you again. I haven’t seen you since you were a baby, you have grown as beautiful as your mother” Narcissa said and Harry gave a very small smile pink flaring in his cheeks as his eyes turned to the floor shyly. Draco smiled at the action wanting to reach out and touch him just to make sure he was indeed real. Music started and Draco reached out to Harry.
“Because all children find thinking about their parents having intimate relations strange and even disturbing regardless of gender” Severus sighed wincing just a little “I am horrified at the thought of my parents in such an intimate position”
“I will remember that to father, you have a vindictive streak, Pants” Draco laughed knowing that even in Azkaban away from her wand his aunt Bella was the stuff of Nightmares. She had starred in enough of his since he had learned what she had done to the Longbottoms when he was younger. “But I’m sure dear aunt Bella would have no love for us either”
“Well, Dad’s always said Dumbledore was a few books short of a full bookcase. But if you ever do become the dark lord, we can be your inner circle, right?”
“Me too. I had just got home from our last meeting and Dumbledore was waiting for me. He told me that I was the lord of Privet and that it was my duty to marry the prince. I tried to run away several times but then…The Weasley twins. They showed me the portrait of the Prince” Harry flushed brightly white teeth biting at his lower lip “You never told me you were the prince!”
“Ahem, sorry to interrupt Lord Malfoy, Lady Malfoy but I think you should contact Gloria Longbottom too, she is the minister in charge of Muggle born. Her department is small and nobody really takes it seriously but she does” Hestia said carefully getting to her feet. “Um...I can floo her if you like?”
“Yes, but we are not in Japan nor are we Japanese. It is a cultural difference between us. We are European, our ancestors have always used a wand to manifest their magic, I suppose one could say that we have grown lazy in harnessing our magic without the aid of a wand. You should never be upset for it, Harry” The older man said, and Harry almost felt better, but then he remembered that Draco had managed it easily. He wasn’t jealous of his friend, but it did make him think that it was just another thing that was wrong with him. Like he was a freak in the wizarding world the same as he was in the Muggle.
“Will you return later?” Remus asked somewhat shyly as he held him back from the floo sometime later. He was returning the twins to the school and had intended to do some marking but the look in the wolf’s face had him giving a nod his fingers brushing against the back of his hand.
“Congratulations, Dad…Pop…” The word was simple but given his reaction when they had first gotten together Severus felt touched. Harry had gotten over his initial hesitance of their relationship and wholeheartedly supported them smiling happy smiles when he saw them together, now he was positively beaming.
“Don’t apologise, Harry, if that is  what you want then I will be more than happy to have them sent for. In fact I think it’s a great idea but if you need some time to get used to the idea”
“Nothing. I am sure you would just ignore it anyway, Draco, I wish you joy” Lucius answered in a painfully false bright voice that was as icy as the north pole. Draco counted the seconds only getting to three before the older Malfoy spoke again. “But if you will ask my advice I would urge you to reconsider. Potter has nothing to gain by stringing you along for fun however you have much to lose. You have only just started to build your reputation as a wandmaker. When Potter eventually grows tired of his little game the fault will not be with him. You can’t possibly believe that Potter is truly interested. You will be a laughing stock! …”
“Harry! You could never mess anything up! Jinx!” Draco summoned the house elf who appeared instantly bowing low while wiping her hands on the hem of her pillow case.
“Sure thing, Professor! C’mon!” The twins shouted throwing their books back into their bags their blue eyes alight with excitement and Harry felt a pulse of excitement as he and Draco followed them out of the classroom.
“It has a few programmed spells for amusement but is otherwise just a toy” Remus chuckled but Harry didn’t care happily flicking it around as sparks, rainbows, and ghostly butterflies appeared and danced around the room. The door to the bedroom opened and Pansy came striding in dressed in black with a bottom that seemed to be made from thousands of beads that shimmered and bounced as she moved. Her hands and most of her arms were covered with long gloves and around her hair was a silver band that had an extremely ornate feather sticking out of it with crystals. A feather boa was wrapped around her arms. Her eyes were painted black and her lips were blood red. Harry thought she reminded him of somebody, but he couldn’t be sure.
“I still have it!” Harry announced patting the inside of his jumper where a bulge stuck out. “But…I think we are gonna have to split up. As a distraction…You go one way with the flag, and I go the other. They think I have it after all”
“Sorry, I wasn’t laughing at you…Rather more at what you said…I remember you at school and how you idolised your father, to hear you call him an idiot…”
Narcissa was with Lucius in the breakfast room when he entered, dressed as always in a beautiful gown lined with warm faux fur. She smiled pouring him a glass of pumpkin juice and piling his plate with food. His potions had been reduced, thankfully, but he was still on a fixed diet and the Malfoy’s or Remus made sure he followed it.
“Character building?” Lucius hissed softly sounding almost like the snake from France. His steel grey eyes were on fire and his fingers were closed  tightly to the snakes head around his cane. “Madam, as a lord of the Malfoy line I have never, even in anger, raised my wand to a woman but I can feel myself becoming dangerously close. ”
“Good morning, brat, how did you sleep?” Severus chuckled fondly as the small boy yawned before sliding into the chair beside him.
“Grub and Thomas” Draco huffed in a dismissive tone while Fred and George took on a protective stance. “Harry is my cousin, Severus’ son. Harry, these unfortunate people are Wallace Grub and Gregory Thomas. Their parents are old friends of father”
“Sshs, Master Draco!” Jinx said putting a long finger over her mouth and hissing out a sshing noise her large eyes glittering with amusement “Sometimes it is fines! Little Master Harry had a bad turns! I fetches you somes now!”
“I see, that elf is growing ever more tiresome. I will send for a healer from Saint Mungo’s or a specialist in elves” Lucius sighed pinching the bridge of his nose “I’m very sorry, Harry, pay him no mind. He has always been a little troubled, ever since he was young. I have always suspected spell damage but lately he has grown increasingly worse. Unfortunately to give him clothes and send him away would only make matters worse”
I am so sorry for how crappy this chapter was after such a delay. Honestly I have two weeks of freedom and I wanted so much to write good chapters and post delay and then on Saturday I found out that one of my favourite Actors from Japan, Haruma Miura, tragically took his own life at 30.
“How can I send a letter?” Harry asked immediately wanting to send a thank you to the boy who had sent him his first ever birthday present.
“Never apologise for wanting to learn, Harry, but we have news” Severus said putting his hand on the back of Remus’ chair. “We have asked the friend of Mistress Gaiman to come in for an interview next week”
“How do you think I answered? James and Lily were my friends, even when I perhaps didn’t deserve them” The werewolf growled a little, the animal close to the surface as his eyes flashed a yellow “I told him to stick his threats up his manipulative arse and left. I have no doubt that my status as a werewolf will be all over the wizarding world by this afternoon”
“Clean this up now and then get to your cupboard! No dinner for you tonight. Its okay Duddykins, I will get you a takeaway” She said simpering almost as loudly as her son and Harry quickly picked up the potatoes before happily slipping into his cupboard not caring about having no dinner has he still had some of the sweets Draco had given him. It was still light in his cupboard so he pulled out the copy of Beadle the Bard wondering if there would be another letter from his penpal in the morning. He hoped so.
“Draco is very handsome though, he is allowed to be a little like a peacock” Harry mumbled shyly colour highlighting his cheek bones and Draco grinned happily at the sight and the praise.
“Harry…” Draco said slowly, but Harry shrugged him off and hurried towards the entrance to the enclosure leaving Draco and Masaki standing looking bewildered while the Chimera watched with puzzlement. He managed to get out easily and threw himself into Severus’ arms the familiar spicy scent of herbs soothing him while the potion master stroked the top of his head.
Urgh! Harry and Draco always seem too old…But I justify it because Draco is trained to be Lord Malfoy one day and Harry has never really be a kid…I hope you liked this part…
“Take a breath, Harry” Lucius was calm and collected gently breathing in and out and making Harry copy him until his panic had passed. Harry gave him a small thankful smile his hand itching to scratch at the back of his neck, but he fought the urge.
Although they had waited till the last possible moment Diagon Alley was bustling with people and Harry grabbed Draco’s hand tightly to avoid being lost in the crush. The crowds parted easily as both Lucius and Severus were stalking in front of them all with their most terrifying expressions on their faces. While Remus and Narcissa brought up the rear keeping all three children in the middle of them.
“Dray, we’re gonna be roommates for seven years. I can’t stand them hating you for that long…I put up with the Dursley’s whispering and calling me behind my back for years, I won’t let it happen again, not to you…” Harry growled glaring at Albright who had gone a little pale and silent. Francis looked shocked and Jake was confused and half asleep in his bed. The air in the dorm crackled for a moment and then Albright cleared his throat.
So I absolutely love Seamus, even if he frustrated me in later books so I thought since they were in Ireland they should meet him. 😊 I hope that this is okay…I apologise to Irish readers for my slight attempt at an accent for Seamus >.<
“We are going to Japan?!” Draco almost shrieked with excitement jumping up from his chair and looking less reserved than Harry had ever seen him. Knowing how much Draco had been looking forward to going to Japan Harry couldn’t help but be happy for his friend.
“You have my word, I am no gossip” Pansy said causing Draco to almost choke on his laughter. He loved his oldest and dearest friend as a sister but he knew her faults well and it was amusing to think that she didn’t think of herself as a gossip.
“Stalking you? You were stalking me! Every time I turned around you were there…” Harry huffed indignantly, and Draco let out another laugh saying drily;
“Boy! There you are! You must forgive him Master Dumbledore, always a dreamer…You have been into the forest again”
“You’ve got leaves in your hair, looks like a regular old birds nest...” the woman chuckled turning on the doorstep and almost tripping over the cat that was standing there. “Freddy, what have I told you, gonna break my neck one of these days, come on in...”
“Good evening first years, I am Professor McGonagall, deputy headmistress of Hogwarts and head of Gryffindor, in just a few moments you will be led through these doors and be sorted into your houses” Draco flashed the teacher a smile as she turned to look at him and Harry and she returned it very briefly before continuing “The houses are Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. While you are here your houses will be your family, good grades and behaviour will earn you points while rule breaking will lose you points. Each house as a head, Ravenclaw is Professor Flitwick, Hufflepuff is Professor Sprout, Slytherin is Professor Snape. However, any and all of the teachers here at Hogwarts are available if you have any difficulties. Headmistress Sinistra is available day or night. Any questions?”
“Yes father, he wrote me to thank me for the birthday gifts I sent him and...He is rather more interesting than Pant...Pansy” Draco corrected himself at the last minute, his mother found his nick name for his oldest and perhaps dearest friend as funny his father however thought it rude to speak of a woman like that even one like Pansy.
Winter was coming to an end and they were entering spring with a bounce. The snow was melting from the garden and although he was sad to see it go Harry had to admit he was looking forward to warmer weather and he couldn’t deny that he shared Narcissa’s enjoyment at seeing the new flowers breaking their way lazily out. With the end of the holidays meant the return of lessons and his healing. He had enjoyed the break from his mind healing, and he had been dreading starting again but he had a lot to unpack. The knowledge that Dobby had gotten out of the hospital somehow was troubling and that feeling was growing the longer he was in the wind.
“My husband” Narcissa smiled a relaxed smile full of warmth and love that she only showed to her family. Draco knew that most people thought his parents marriage had been political in nature but Draco knew that it was a love match first it was fortunate that their parents had agreed to the match. “Read your letters Draco, you have been incredibly patient”
“We saw Cheshire cats in France. They were really creepy” Harry hummed as the Kelpie swam away and he remembered the purple vanishing cat with a huge grin. “Was Lewis Carroll a Wizard?”
“Bleedin Ell” Seamus whistled as he stepped into the main reception hall followed closely by his mother Bridget. Harry, Draco, Pansy and the twins were awaiting his arrival and Harry gave an extremely nervous smile as Bridget stared at him. It had been a week since the Hummingbirds had played the legion and that their lives had shifted around, and it had been four days since Seamus had written and asked if he could come and play. The Malfoy’s had agreed and had suggested the twins and Pansy join and make a day of it. Harry knew that the Malfoy’s and his parents were trying to make things as calm as possible, but he also knew about the people constantly coming in and out in the dead of night. How Sho and Remus spent almost all waking hours in the library pouring over the books and how Nino had shifted in to teaching them defensive spells and Severus had stepped up teaching him how to close his mind from outside attacks. “Yer sure this is yer ‘ome and not a bleeding museum?”
“The Dudley creature is awful, shame he is too young to go on trial” Draco huffed as Lupin came back to the table with a tray of drinks floating at his side. He handed them out and then moved back into his own seat nursing a chocolate milk. Harry sipped slowly at the Butterbeer not wanting to rush it while the table lapsed in to a stretched out uncomfortable silence. The bubble of the privacy spell stopped any sounds coming in from outside its radius and all they could hear was the sounds of their own breathing and the slow sipping of their drinks.
Narcissa Malfoy had always considered herself to be a strong capable witch. Little to nothing could scare her, but her sister Bellatrix Lestrange was the one thing that scared her like nothing else. However, she stood proud, her back straight, and her eyes set and determined as she gazed up at the looming, chilling building that was Azkaban. It had been months of planning, but finally she was here, and she was going to see what her sister knew.
“You are correct as always, Pansy, Harry’s true first name is Perseus but he was brought up in the muggle world and Harrison was better fit”
“Dumbledore said time and time again that the boy had to be with his family. Why?” Lucius asked and Severus could admit to feeling a little perplexed by that. He could only imagine that he wanted him broken so that he could reshape him into a solider. He was god at doing that. Severus felt the acidic taste of bitterness collecting at the back of his tongue as he asked;
“I will make sure you are not alone, if Kingsley can be trusted I will have him in the room with you” The words were tinged with worry for his wife and what may befall her and Severus couldn’t blame him. He could remember Bella and he doubted her time in Azkaban would have improved her insanity.
“First years! Getting ready for the sorting! Hadrian, Draco! How pleasant it is to see you again!” The ghost said in a booming voice that caused more students to look at them again. Draco kept his chin up smiling at the ghosts as he bowed politely.
“Wow!” Draco and Harry said together and Tormuld beamed showing all of his sharp teeth though it was a friendly smile. It vanished when a knock sounded on the door an Harry almost choked on his sweet as he sucked in a breath. Lucius gently thumped him on the back while the door opened and Dumbledore came sweeping into the room wearing bright orange robes with suns and runes on them. His long fluffy beard was tucked into his belt and he was beaming with his eyes twinkling brightly as he looked at Harry. He attempted to get close but Jinx pushed him away with an invisible burst of elf magic.
“Severus is a skilled legilimens, it means that he can go into peoples minds and search through their memories, they can read them or make the person relive them” Draco explained laying on his side and cuddling up behind him. Harry stiffened just a little but then relaxed letting out a big sigh. “Most of the time it can be done without the person even knowing that they are having them read but Severus wasn’t thinking and he wasn’t kind. Mother and father will handle him and make him regret it”
“You really should be more careful Irish, I mean, not that I’m particularly worried about you blowing yourself up, but I happen to be standing right beside you.”
“No, thank-you, Tormuld, you have been most efficient. Come I believe that we should perhaps have an ice cream at Fortescue’s” Lucius smiled at them all shrinking down the items that he had been given and slipping them into his pocket. “You as well Jinx”
“Okay, let’s do this!” Draco announced clapping his hands together. Harry pulled their flag out from inside his jumper and Draco stuffed it into his before watching as Harry pushed his gloves back into the spot to make it look like he was still carrying the flag.
Oh my god! I am so very sorry! I never meant to be away as long as I have been. I had the surgery, and it went well but I just started feeling sorry for myself all I wanted was my dad and that sparked a major depressive episode that I am only just managing to fight my way out of. I’ve been doing nothing but play on video games, I have no idea how many times I’ve gone through Mass Effect and Dragon age…I’m on Skyrim again now! But I wanted to find my way back and I am,
“No, Draco and his parents are here” Harry whispered in a small voice and Draco had the urge to gently take his hand again and give it a squeeze. Harry looked at it and then swallowed moving further into the room. Mrs Figg was an ancient old woman wearing carpet slippers and a floral house coat. Her hair was in curlers and yet her eyes were bright and quick as she looked them over.
“Bring Harry Potter here…” The hat huffed as Draco got up from the stool and stood beside it holding out his hand for his friend. Harry looked green in the face but slowly he came forward and sat down.
“They are my friends, Thomas” Pansy growled surprising both the twins and Seamus who looked at her with open mouths. Harry smiled, he had known the Parkinson heir liked their three friends, but she had gone out of her way until now to hide that fact from anyone, more so them. Grub and Thomas were just as surprised but recovered with a scoffing laugh
sorry for the shorter chapter, never dd i know that Japnese particles were so difficult to understand >.<
“Severus, you would...I am surprised, I never imagined that you would recommend that” Lucius said and Severus lay down his knife and fork before sighing looking at the wall in front of him.
“You would, my dragon, for all of five minutes and then you would throw up. You must remember that you have extremely bad ocean sickness”
“Perhaps…” McGonagall gave him a small smile and a shake of the head before making her way down the table until she was sat next to a plump witch in brown robes.
“I don’t have a crush on Madam Ninomiya! I just find her to be interesting!” Draco flushed brightly and Harry smiled eating as much of the wonderful dinner as he could until his stomach started hurting. Once all of the Malfoy’s had set their cutlery down the food vanished only to be replaced by desserts. Desserts that Dudley would have wept for.
“Not good, not good at all, okay young Harry, the spell will end now. If you feel comfortable will you drop your trousers for me?”
“That’s okay, I’m glad you could come. They are just about to start so you should go in and get settled” The reporter told him and all five of the children stepped into the booth. There were a few other reporters already inside but none of them were really paying attention to the five children that came in. Harry found himself pushed in between Draco and Pansy and he blinked in surprise as strange binoculars were pressed into his hands. They were brass and wood with a dozen or more little buttons on them. “They are Omnoculars they let you see all of the action” Sho explained “I get a pair at every game I attend but then always forget them in the hotel. I brought all the pairs I have for you today. You can keep them”
“Yes, Madame” Draco said with a bow taking his violin and Harry’s hand before pulling him out of the room. They made their way to Remus’ rooms where they would be studying history of British magic with the werewolf. Severus had recommended it as the teacher of History of magic was a dull ghost, but Severus considered the subject to be important if only because it would help them understand more about where their traditions and customs came from. Harry was enjoying it, there was something calming about the way his father taught and it was always nice to spend the two hours with him after his sessions. He suspected that that was why they were arranged that way.
“Correct” Pride was in his Dad’s face as he answered the question and Harry felt his cheeks warming and he was extremely glad when the potion master began his rounds of the classroom again. Fred and George finished their potion and left it to one side to cool allowing them plenty of time to clean up their desks and talk to Harry and Draco.
“Dumbledore as headmaster of Hogwarts you have no say in what happens with Harry and yet you took it upon yourself to place him with relatives that have abused him, you failed to check in with him and ignored the warnings of Mrs Arabella Figg” Narcissa said speaking over him while lifting her hand to silence him “She is prepared to swear under oath that she has told you repeatedly of the treatment Harry has suffered and you, who styled yourself his protector and guardian, said that no matter what Harry had to stay with the muggles”
“Indeed. He outright refused to go into the Slytherin dorms. The Headmistress placed a Floo call to his parents, little good that it did. Arthur, to be fair, did seem to agree that Mister Weasley should go where the hat put him though the poor man couldn’t get a word in edgewise over Molly.”
Harry woke to the feeling of somebody breathing against his neck and arms wrapped around him. It was obviously much later in the day as the sun was now creeping around the curtains. There was a rattle from across the room and Harry gasped pulling out of Draco’s arms as he saw a beautiful white owl flying around. It was almost completely white but there were a few black feathers here and there. Its eyes were yellow and they were watching him closely. Its beak opened and it let out a loud screech and flew towards him. She cicled his head for a moment and then landed on his should.
sorry for the delay. Had a busy couple of days. Hope that this chapter was okay... Next part will be the blood adoption
I guess what I’m trying to say is that you have been chosen by Harry’s magic to be his guardians. I’m not sure of the exact spell used Lily is the clever one (Not that I admitted that) but his magic has picked you and that means that it is good enough for me. I know that you will love him and teach him all the things that I won’t be able to but I also need you to make sure that Dumbledore can’t get him, can’t use him. He will do his best but you have to stop him. Please just let Harry be a kid, let him grow up loved.
“Yes, we have three hours with her” Draco answered as they all made their way up the tunnel and back into the warm splendour of the Malfoy main hall and Harry could tell that his friend was very excited. He had been talking about professor Ninomiya none stop for the last week and Harry was starting to think that Narcissa was right, Draco did have a crush.
“Nose, he cames to Masters after the first wars” Jinx shook her head hard so her ears waved around almost slapping at her bald head. The strong action almost caused her to fall forwards, but Harry caught her and held her up. She gave him a happy, adoring grin.
“At least ferrets are cute. Pugs are a crime against nature.” Draco gave a fake shudder and Harry let out a laugh shoving his friend just a little. It had taken him a while to grow accustomed to the teasing playfulness the friends shared and to realise that there was no heat in either of their words. It was playful teasing brought about by years of knowing each other and growing up almost as brother and sister. If anyone else insulted Pansy like that Draco would do anything in his power to defend her and Pansy would do the same. It was nice really though Harry didn’t think he could ever insult either of them even in jest.
“My happiness means nothing. Voldemort hasn’t been seen since the night he killed the Potters, and nor has Harry. All we have to go on is what Dumbledore says…” Draco rose from his seat and stormed out of the room and out of the palace. He saddled Nimbus and rode him hard to the forest.
“And you should watch yourself, you dirty death eater, Dumbledore will prove that you have Harry under some sort of spell…”
“Okay, next question, what is your favourite food? Mine’s butterscotch and whiskey sauce drizzled over creamy ice cream!” Alice’s eyes were practically sparkling as she spoke about the ice cream and Harry had the strangest desire to eat it himself.
“I know! And that made it worse, you tried to love me, but you can’t help being gay, Harry, so I was mad at you because I couldn’t be mad at you!” She said confusing him enough that he looked up with a slack jawed expression. Ginny laughed brightly looking so much more relaxed than he had ever seen her before. “You cheated on me, I wanted to be mad! But the more I thought about it the more I couldn’t be mad at you so I was mad at myself for not being mad at you…Okay it doesn’t make much sense now I say it out loud but it made sense for me at the time.”
“We are going for lunch! You will all join us to celebrate our victory?” CC asked and Harry looked at his tutor who gave a nod and a smile looking to the baffled looking Auror who had been roped into taking the photos.
“It was a certain shade of purple...I have a gift for you, a belated birthday gift if you will” Severus said taking a glass bottle from his pocket and handing it to the elf first. Jinx made sure that it was safe by wrapping it in her hand while Severus explained “These are all of my memories of your mother, Lucius has a pensive if you place this into it you will be able to visit them as though you were there. Sadly you cannot interact with them but you will be able to learn of your mother as I knew her”
“Oh, such as?” Draco hummed waving for another whiskey while studying Potter finding it amusing that his new confidence seemed to fade just a little making him look like his school hood rival once again. There was something oddly comforting in that. Harry looked a little sheepishly at his drink before draining the last of it in a swill as though he was downing a brandy for some Dutch courage. It was extremely amusing to watch and Draco found his inner Slytherin delighted that maybe he had something over Harry once and for all.
“You don’t mate, and you don’t want to...The first of the presents only get sent if you are the senders true love...”
Severus had entertained numerous ways in which he might ask Remus to marry him. Each one had been rejected almost immediately for being too steeped in romance. He was not now nor ever would be a romantic person. Yes, he loved Remus, and had done so since he was still in school, but he was not the stuff of romantic novels. Damsels in destress would not flock to his side and he was comfortable with that and Remus seemed to take it in stride. He was more than enough a sentimental for the both of them. However, even he knew that a proposal should be something that would be remembered fondly, no matter how sure he was of the answer, not only that, Remus deserved something special. He had brought the ring months ago, since Remus had seen it in a shop in muggle London when they had been purchasing clothes for Harry’s present. It was a simple band with no ostentatious stones, but inside he had had the words ‘Lupus meam ab mei’, etched inside. The same words he spoke to Remus each night. In the current English it was translated to, My wolf, my heart.
“This is the most perfect winter festival I’ve ever had” He announced looking at Harry whose face must be aching from all the smiling he had been doing. His friend hadn’t stopped smiling since the first snow and it had only gotten brighter the closer, they got to the main day. Pansy had been with them for most of it however she had gone home three days ago and although he loved her, he was happy he was getting to spend time with his family. “I am so very glad that you came here, Harry”
Sure enough the Cheshire cat was slowly fading into nothing as the reached it, the main body first and then the markings until only its face remained the creepy almost grin never leaving the face. Draco shuddered thinking about how many children had followed them deep into forests only to be left alone with only that grin burnt into their memories. It was fair creepier to think about than Harry being able to talk to snakes though it was something he would have to tell his father.
Diggory appears…I always thought he would have been mentioned more in cannon, he seemed popular and he was a quidditch player but hey-ho!
“Madam Ninomiya has agreed to teach you again this year Draco, I’m sure that she will be more than happy to have a second student. Severus has agreed to tutor you on the day where he has an hour spare but, I beg of you, don’t be a dullard and waste his time. You know how your Godfather gets” Lucius said and Draco nodded seriously before flashing Harry a grin.
“You’re welcome, we haven’t been properly introduced. I’m Nino and you are Fred and George?” Nino introduced herself politely to the twins both flushing a deep red which clashed horribly with their hair as they fell over themselves to point at each other.
“Is…Is it…Abnormal in the wizarding world?” Harry asked, suddenly feeling as though he had had cold water poured over his happiness. All too clearly he could hear his aunt and uncle talking about how disgusting ‘queers’ were and how it should still be illegal. Once when they had been out at a store and Vernon had seen too men holding hands he had caused such a scene that even Petunia had been embarrassed though she had agreed that the men were a bad influence on her precious little Dudley. Draco gave a shrug his delicate nose scrunching up.
“Yes” Harry answered not really understanding what was being said but feeling guilty for all the stress he was surely causing for the family. His hand went to his neck but Lucius caught it before he could start scratching and gave it a squeeze
“He showed me the passage from the bedroom to the kitchen, the names on the wall...We talked about silly things, about his childhood, about your grandparents...” Harry couldn’t explain what had happened in the night that had made him feel such a kinship to Lucius but if he had to pinpoint one thing it would be the fact that Lucius had told him about his nightmares. It had him feel so much better knowing that he wasn’t the only one. For some reason he didn’t want to tell Draco that though. Draco hero worshipped his father and there was a real chance he didn’t know about the nightmares. “He asked me to call him uncle”
“Actually, I am several minutes late. But I can see why you may have lost time, is there a reason that you are engaging in fisticuffs with effigies of Harry’s former tormentors? Not that I can blame you”
Whew, I hope that this was alright! Was it expected? Almost time for Hogwarts who should be Headmaster? A new character? Or one of the teachers already there?
“I would say that it was agreeable, Harry...But never throw another game, I want to beat you, but I want you at your best, I don’t want or need pity” Draco huffed and Harry rolled his eyes flicking the pointed nose of his former school rival growling.
“Very good, I knew she would like you” Narcissa chuckled clapping her hands together causing Harry to look from the bird to the woman standing with her back to the fire. She was wearing a two piece outfit of soft blue tweed with a lighter blue top that was finished at the neck with a beautiful butterfly brooch. “This is the owl we said you could have. The Malfoy’s have always favoured eagle owls but last year a snowy owl found her way into our owl house. We left her free to do as she pleased and she ended up laying several eggs but only one of the chicks survived against all odds. She is a fighter like you, perhaps you are the reason her mama came here, we were going to sell her but I think she will be  much happier with you”
Sevy, Dumbledore told me, about what you did, that you told Voldemort and that is why he is after us...”
“Are you okay?” The blonde asked carefully his pale grey eyes searching his face and Harry gave him a smile nodding.
“So?” Francis grumbled clearly not a morning person as he soon let out a loud yawn. “It’s probably a comfort thing, just leave it…”
“Cissy?” Bella hissed her eyes going to Kingsley who was standing in the corner as still as a statue. Narcissa let out the meanest laugh she could manage.
“How did you guess?” The twins asked together feeling somewhat proud that even though their costumes were handmade she had been able to tell. They were wearing togas with a crown of leaves around their heads. It was a simple costume compared to the others around them, but they had added touches like the tridents they both carried and the swan feathers at their hips.
“Tell me what Draco? Are we having fun? Mr Grub and Mr Thomas, you seem to have had a little accident, please allow me to clean you off and perhaps we should talk to your father. My wife was rather fond of that vase after all” Lucius appeared like a spectre his words icy, the smile on his face as dangerous as a snakes as he looked at the two boys who had paled even more dramatically at the appearance of the Malfoy lord.
“I didn’t think it mattered” Draco gave a shrug his pale cheeks colouring with just a touch of pink. “I was just me while I was in the forest with you and I liked that you liked me for me”
“I see, I wonder what Harry is like, Draco you wonder about it too don’t you? You’ve always wanted to meet him”
“And what will become of you? Your lodgings, employment?” Severus sounded strained, as though he were fighting his concern for the other man but doing a poor job of it. Harry didn’t truly understand what was going on between them. For a long time, it had felt as though Severus hated Remus, but something had changed when they had met in Hogsmeade. Remus gave a resigned, sad, smile that caused his amber eyes to dim while he ran his fingers through his hair. The action disturbed some of the brown revealing grey around the temples.
Please don’t kill me! This is not the end, just the end of this part! SchoolMate will start soon, and we know what that means! Hogwarts! Weasley’s Dumbledore and trouble!
“It is interesting, however more research will need to be done. Frog spleens can be highly dangerous themselves and make for temperamental potions if used incorrectly…” Severus nodded before spending a great deal of time telling his son and godson about his own research into curse damage. He had seen a lot of it during his time with the Dark Lord and he longed for a way to help the poor souls in St Mungo’s as repentance. Though currently his own research was focused on a cure for werewolfism…Or at the very least making it less painful. Wolfsbane was a start but Remus needed something else, something that could lessen the monster he became. He had asked the Head of Ilvermorny, Robert Singer for any insight that he might have. The man had been a rather proficient researcher in a branch of Auror’s known as Hunters, before taking on the role of headmaster but so far it had all come to a dead end. He was lucky Lucius and Narcissa were happy to help fund him, research was costly, and a school potions master earned very little, it did however allow him access to many ingredients he would otherwise have difficulty in securing.
