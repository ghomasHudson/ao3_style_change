In the evening Hermione comes to visit. I am sitting in the kitchen, staring into a cup of coffee. She approaches me cautiously when she sees my drawn face.
“And your friend’s name?”
I give her a tight smile and she frowns, “Did something happen to Draco?”
“But he is less than the shell of what he was before,” I groan, “What did they do to him?”
She studies him for a few more moments before lowering her voice to ask something else, “Do you ever think about the future?”
She nods, “I’m glad.”
“What the fuck, Potter!?” he curses, “What are you doing in my bed?!”
“It’s okay, Draco. I am not going to hurt you. Just let me see your arm, okay? There is nothing you should be ashamed of. Please Draco,” I plead, continuing to stroke his right hand.
“I didn’t need to be saved,” he spits, deep mistrust and fear in his eyes, “I have to go back. Voldemort will kill my parents if I have been gone for too long. Give me my wand back.”
So now I am sitting in the lecture hall, twirling a quill around my fingers. As interesting as I find healing, I have difficulties focusing today, grey eyes flitting through my mind again and again.
The next morning I am up early once again. I don’t think I have ever really slept in since we brought Draco here. Today though I am still preparing coffee when I hear a crash from upstairs. I startle immediately. Coffee forgotten I hurry up the stairs. I’m not really surprised when it lands me in front of Draco’s room in the end. Inside it’s mostly silent. Well, at least no screaming so hopefully no panic attack at the moment. On the other hand though when I open the door a bit I hear some soft sounds. My brow furrows, not sure what to make of this and open the door entirely.
“I haven’t seen him, but if I do, I could call you. Do you want have my number?” she is worried too, since she has come to care about Draco too.
“And where do you live? Still at the Malfoy Manor?” I prod gently.
My face falls as he still doesn’t show much of a reaction but after some seconds of silence his face twists. It is that crooked smile again. There is no happiness in his face, just empty. Again tears tug at the back of my eyes. I reach out my hand and stroke his cheek softly.
Anyway, this is the last chapter of part 1. I can't say when I will start the next part, but I will try to make it soon.
Disclaimer: Not mine.
“I would rather have that, than him sitting around apathetic,” I push the door to the living room open.
“Yeah, the Ministry insists on informing them why they are taking the houses back, even though it’s not protocol. So when they hear that the property is going back to a Malfoy…” she trails off.
Since I never owned a horse myself, only took riding lessons, I used to ride with a saddle too most of the time. Only twice during a very hot summer we were allowed to ride on the horse's bare back and in my opinion it was a lot of fun though more difficult.
, of all the unfortunate souls who could have crossed Harry’s path. He had not thought about Malfoy for ten blissful years, after the Wizengamot had shipped his parents off to Azkaban. Harry had tried to get out of serving at their trial, there was just something about deciding the fate of a schoolmate, even if it was Draco sodding Malfoy, but the Wizengamot had been quite adamant about his participation. As much as he had hated Malfoy, Harry still preferred to not reminisce the trial where he had to attest to the atrocities Lucius had committed under Voldemort’s command, the colour escaping Draco’s already pale face. There was not much he could have done to help Narcissa either, except for testifying that when she could have told Voldemort that Harry was still alive in the forest, she didn’t. She was found guilty of aiding the Death Eaters.
Sexy? Harry wasn’t trying to be sexy, he just wanted to know the truth. Was Malfoy expecting Harry to be waiting for him, rose petals on his bed…
When Harry returned downstairs, he found Malfoy sitting at the kitchen table, reading the morning’s
Harry nodded.
but there was no way of telling. Then, without giving another glance in Harry’s way, he turned and closed the door behind him.
Just as he turned to leave, Harry surged to grab his hand. “Wait, Draco,” he said quickly, and saw Malfoy’s eyes widen at the sound of his given name. He was really quite stunning, come to think of it. Harry was standing at a weird crouching position, so he straightened himself to look him in the eye. “It’s fine,” he said in a steady voice, “listen, let’s go somewhere.”
Harry was pulled out of his thoughts by the question. “No, I haven’t,” he replied, “never been outside the UK, actually.” It felt like a confession for some reason. He’d never been abroad. When he was little, he should’ve been so lucky as to accompany Petunia to the grocery store. The Dursley’s hardly travelled, and even so, they would have never, ever brought Harry with them.
; and finally, Penelope Jameson from the
“Not exactly?” Harry echoed.
, he thought.
“Would you care to arrange the paperwork for Mr Ridgenorth here to be sent to Azkaban to wait for trial?” Harry asked in his most cordial voice, while striding towards the door, and opening it for Patrick to go through.
“How is madam Ackerman these days?” Harry inquired as they were strolling down the corridor towards the elevators. Lunch hour at the Ministry was always quiet, and they didn't pass anyone in the hallway.
After a while, Harry returned back to the boat, and climbed on board with some difficulty. They were still in the shade, but the hot wind didn't make Harry shiver, on the contrary, it dried him up quickly. “Here,” he said, interrupting Draco’s reading, “I have your seashell, I want you to have this,” he placed the small, round stone on the man’s palm. Malfoy put his book away and inspected the souvenir Harry had just handed him, it had been brighter in the sunlight, but still had a glowing colour to it.
Normally, he would show up to work in smart, simple robes, because his usual workday consisted of meetings and tall piles of paperwork. Sometimes, however, when he wanted to seem more authoritative than he was, when he left the Ministry on official business, or when, like today, he was personally interviewing witnesses, he opted for the official Head Auror robes.
Midnight. McGallon was standing in the shadow of the entrance to Borgin and Burkes at Knockturn Alley. She was wearing the robes they had extracted off of Dubois in exchange for jail robes, and the large hood was covering her face. Harry was lurking in the shades of the side alley with Evergrey, whereas Blackburn and Rivers were in a passageway on the other side of the street. Buckthorn and Crooker were on the roof of the opposing building, and Twigs was laying low on the second floor of the abandoned Borgin and Burkes.
The Minister shook his head regrettingly, “My hands are tied, Harry, it was a decision by the Ministry board.” Kingsley slouched back on his chair, and looked at Harry like he was indicating that it was his turn to convince him to take action – it was more than Harry had expected of the conversation. Then he realized:
Where he expected the git to storm out, he heard him let out a light laugh, and his head all but jerked to look at him in shock. Malfoy was making such an annoying, Malfoy-ish face, that Harry was briefly connected to his eleven-year-old self who just wanted to punch him in the face. “So, you’ve been treated by me three times now, and you’re still wondering what I’m doing these days? Honestly, Potter, it will forever remain a mystery to me who ever allowed you to be an Auror, with your infallible skills of deduction.” Malfoy looked like every word he spoke rejuvenated him from some kind of a rut he had been in: his face was positively glowing being able to make a jab at Harry. “How’s the ankle, by the way?”
“Yes!” she announced gleefully, “I… I flew with my bwoom in the backyawd the whooooole day, mum says I fly so much I’m gonna forget how to walk, but it doesn’t bother me because then I can just fly evewywhere!” Rosie accompanied her enthusiastic narration with large hand movements that nearly swept Harry’s glasses off his face a couple times.
It was silent for a few seconds, only the sound of a clock on the wall ticking away, before Malfoy quietly uttered, “Me too.” It sounded like a confession. He wasn’t looking at Harry anymore, instead, it looked like he was avoiding his gaze, his eyes traveling around the room, scanning the fireplace, the desk, the closet, the bedding. Was he…
“Always,” Harry replied, heart suddenly beating faster. He hoped Draco couldn’t feel his pulse, holding his hand, while he raised his eyes to face the grey stare now looking straight at him, making him feel more seen than he had in a very long while. Eyes open, arms open, heart open, Harry was ready for whatever Malfoy was going to say next.
(See the end of the chapter for
,” subsequently placing the chocolates in his lap, “are to help your miserable love life.”
“Fine,” Lucius’ throaty voice was barely audible in the room.
Draco looked away and nodded. There was nothing that either of them could do, it was up to the judge now to seal Lucius’ fate. Harry didn’t know how Draco would react if the worst would come to the worst, and he didn’t dare to speculate. When Draco turned back to look at Harry, his silvery eyes had a determined fire behind them, and although his face had turned scarlet in the now dim corridor, he didn’t look ashamed. Before Harry could reason against it, he had kissed Draco on the lips, hastily, a bit too far on the side, their cheekbones clunking together awkwardly. Draco didn’t even have the chance to react, but when Harry pulled back, there was a sad smile on Draco’s features.
“You’ll be fine, you have like, seven months to prepare still,” Harry just shrugged and offered the thin comfort he had left. Seven months was plenty of time to get one’s shit together, and Harry wasn’t going to bring it out, but in seven months Hermione was going to be the one going to be dealing with much more acute problems than worrying about what kind of a parent she was going to be.
Harry had to take a break halfway through, he realized that the people sitting around them were still the same. No one had left or arrived, everyone was sipping on their drinks lazily, talking with each other. Harry realized that dining here wasn’t just about eating, it was about socializing, relaxing, and the food and wine only facilitated that. Harry gave a look in Malfoy’s direction, who was also eyeing the restaurant. “I get it now,” he said suddenly.
Harry had too many questions that he wanted answered quickly, but only after Malfoy would find his way out – what was he doing here anyway? Unfortunately, it seemed that the tosser had noticed Harry’s movements, “You know, there is a very fascinating quiz here according to which I have the perfect qualities to be the famous Harry Potter’s dream girl.”
“I always thought it was more that everyone in Slytherin hated me,” Harry shrugged, “but yeah, I did hate you,” he snorted, it all seemed so long ago, stalking Malfoy’s comings and goings, being convinced that he was devising evil plans at every turn. Now Malfoy gave him an incredulous look, but made a weird face like he was struggling to hold back a smirk – a tiny twitch in the corner of his mouth.
Despite having taken an accidental four-hour nap earlier in the day, Harry had slept like a baby in Malfoy’s bed, his other leg on top of the man, and a blonde head on his shoulder. He hadn’t had any dreams, and had only been woken up by the sun shining directly into his eyes. Harry couldn’t remember when he’d last slept until ten in the morning.
or something of the like?” Ron managed to pronounce dating like he was holding back from vomiting out a slug, his face doing a thing resembling when one sees someone else vomiting out a slug.
“No, it’s quite alright,” Harry said as calmly as he could, trying to appease Narcissa, “I’m going to go straight to the point,” he didn’t want to keep the woman in suspense, “it has come to pass that I have been removed from the investigation that you’re currently involved in.” Harry saw that the obvious question was already on Narcissa’s lips, so he chose to go ahead and continue, “The Minister believes that there is a conflict of interest between me and this family, your family, due to my and Draco’s history of being schoolmates, and obviously because of the trials right after, and I think it unwise to disagree.” Harry tried his best to justify the decision, even though he himself was still fairly pissed off that he had been dismissed. Be that as it may, he knew that there was nothing he could do to fight the outcome, and now he had to stand behind it. Narcissa merely nodded slowly to show she understood and apparently didn’t have anything against it.
Malfoy clasped his hands together on the table and adopted a very methodical tone. “Well, while it seems that the Ministry has already made a final decision, Harry managed to get an audience with its board for tomorrow, making a case for my father’s initial conviction to be reinstated.” Now they just had to manage that, Harry thought.
Harry stared back at him, unsure how to respond, “I don’t know… is it?” He hoped that Malfoy would give him an answer, that he would say something along the lines of
Now the bastard sighed tiredly and stood up. He grabbed his outer cloak and swung it on in one smooth motion. He didn’t look arrogant, just bored, and somehow Harry hated that even more. “Don’t think I will, lost the urge for it somehow, probably all the blood from your near-death experience.” Malfoy took a few steps towards the door, but stopped at the foot of Harry’s bed when he spoke.
The git was now standing in the middle of the hallway carpet, scanning the room up and down, a habit of his, apparently. “That was a different time, I may love my father, I just don’t respect him anymore,” he said so matter-of-factly that Harry was a bit taken aback by the content of the sentence, however, before he had time to ask further questions, Malfoy already added, “What a lovely place you have here.” Somehow his catty tone didn’t make it seem like a compliment at all. Malfoy took off his cloak and brutishly threw it on the chair next to a houseplant on a tall side table. He was wearing a black turtleneck and his usual black slacks underneath. It created a contrast with how messy Harry’s appearance was, he’d have to flee and change his clothes sooner rather than later.
“Lovely, just brilliant,” Harry felt like stomping his foot, he was the Head bloody Auror, and
“Right,” he stood up as well, but there was something he needed to know, no matter how little Malfoy actually cared about him, “one question though, when are you leaving England?” Harry tried to use his most nonchalant voice, but didn't know if it came out as such.
Hermione sighed and looked to be in search for words as they stepped into the empty elevator and requested the Atrium. “Busy, as am I, though today it’s been slow, we’re still waiting for a large batch of documents from MACUSA to be delivered so that we can get back to work.” MACUSA? Why was the lead defence attorney waiting for documents from the Magical Congress of the United States of America?
He thought of all the things the git had made him feel, the hatred and the pity all those years ago, the nervousness and anxiety his presence had caused in Harry lately. The sheer passion of that one night together, the chills that the man gave Harry with just one touch. Harry wanted
The second person to take the stand was the prison guard from Azkaban, who looked simultaneously very happy to be away from his workplace, and put off by having to talk about it. He vowed for Lucius’ good behaviour, docile nature, and thus his capabilities for collaboration with the good researchers at the Ministry.
“Well, I
to merely
“I know,” Harry said quietly, “me too.” He thought bitterly about how much harder the two had made their lives to be, when it could have been very easy. It could have been so very easy…
“Right,” Harry wasn’t sure how to continue, “anyway, er, I had to bring Cedric’s body back, so I Accio’d the cup and it transported me back to school.” The marching band music was still echoing in his ears, suddenly permeated by the horrified scream of Fleur realizing the horrific fate of Cedric.
Malfoy was the first to deter, sweeping the strands of hair back behind his ear. “Well, you looked pretty dead to me.” His tone was cold but Harry had a feeling that something else lurked under there as well.
“Merlin, Potter, you really need a financial consult or something”, he said, shaking his head vigorously.
“Thank you for recognizing my efforts, Hermione. You’re right, even if Harry here had any taste – which, of course, he doesn’t – I don’t think there’s anything that would get him to actually go through the effort of conjuring all this up.”
The pair joined the stream of people. Harry’s head was turning left and right in awe, which seemed to amuse Malfoy, though he didn’t say anything. They saw street performers, each more fantastic than the last: there were children dancing, a person making magnificent paintings of the setting sun and of the people, and Harry could swear that somewhere in the distance, he saw an entire sword disappear down a man’s throat. The warm wind was getting cooler, making it more comfortable for people to be outside, spending their summer weekend with their friends. Harry thought of how much he wanted to bring Ron and Hermione here, and little Rosie.
“It’s a tea room, one of few that are open this late,” Malfoy replied. Indeed, it was eleven o’clock at night, and only two other people were sitting on the other side of the room, sipping their tea and engaging in quiet conversation. “So have you decided what you’re going to be having?”
Immediately they were met with a bunch of
do. Speaking from experience, once the Ministry has made a decision, they will go through with it, no matter what.” Draco’s words cut Harry like a knife: he had been on both sides of the Ministry’s power, and couldn't argue with what the man was saying. The Ministry was an old-fashioned institution that was a bit too complacent about its sense of right and wrong, something that could be disastrous if given too much power.
“Right, I guess we’ll just have to see then,” he bit his lip sourly.
, he couldn’t care less about the git, he was only doing his job as a public servant.
Harry thought.
Harry stood his ground, even though inside, he was shaking in his boots. “You used to be a man of reason, now what are you?” he asked challengingly, “All I know is that the man I’m seeing in front of me right now is very desperate, and desperate people don’t make good leaders.” Harry thought of Voldemort leading his troops, desperate to get his hands on Harry; he thought of Snape’s short reign as the headmaster of Hogwarts, desperate trying to protect both Harry and Draco, and himself; oddly enough, he also thought of Vernon, leading their small pack of four to the lighthouse all those years ago, desperate to escape the seemingly endless stream of Hogwarts letters.
“Enjoying the view?” Harry had heard Malfoy’s sleepy voice coming from beneath the sheets, and his blonde head pop up to peer at him, hair dishevelled, eyes squinting in the bright room. He really was a sight for sore eyes, his tan limbs against the white sheets, golden hair messy on the pillow, grey eyes measuring Harry, his voice still low and hoarse.
“Well, in that case, thanks,” Harry forced out the polite reply even with how unnatural it sounded. He moved his gaze to his arms, which he was now trying to move. They felt stiff and were aching still when he lifted them slowly from his sides onto his stomach and back. He wiggled his toes and shuffled his feet underneath the sheets. “So… what happened to me exactly?” he asked carefully, feeling foolish that he had to interview Malfoy of all people about his condition.
“Settle down Rosie, it’s your bedtime soon,” Hermione reminded her, “if you go to bed now I’ll come and read you a story.” The little girl was already running upstairs, curls bouncing.
because the
Now the git spun around in his chair to face Harry. “It’s the reason I’m giving you,” he stated firmly, “now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to talk about anything else, maybe more of your childhood trauma?” he slouched back into the chair, taking a deep breath and looking away, “Tell me, Potter, what were your aunt and uncle like?” he asked, closing his eyes and facing the sun.
It was quiet for a few seconds, the moment breathed like a dragon that had just performed its first attack, stopping to assess the damage that’s been done. “Maybe someone
“you’re better at being loved
The entire conversation was so backwards it made Harry’s head spin. Trying his best to keep his composure, Harry got up from the chair, knees nearly buckling when he straightened himself. “I think it’s best I was on my way, you know how it is with work and whatnot,” Harry found himself blabbering and backing away towards the hallway.
Malfoy scoffed and rolled his eyes, “Yes, but that’s because I’m a real catch.”
“For Salazar’s sakes,” Malfoy huffed and rubbed his chin in thought, still looking at Harry.
Harry crossed his arms on his chest, all of this was completely unfair. He didn’t have anything to taunt Malfoy with – he had been perfectly adequate as a magical physician. “I don’t know, maybe you were there for… for…” Harry couldn't come up with one explanation why Malfoy would’ve been roaming about in Healer robes and ID unless he was actually… well, a Healer.
“Well, sorry to disappoint,” Harry shrugged simply. He was used to disappointing people, and though he never tried to please Malfoy per se, he definitely knew there was no scenario where Malfoy wouldn’t have something negative to say about Harry.
Draco Malfoy had just marched up to his house
“Maybe I’ve just been busy with work,” Harry hated the excuse and didn’t have the motivation to even try and sound convincing in his delivery.
“Brilliant, thank you Rivers,” Harry turned to face the window before recalling the real reason he came to work this early – to get beaten up, “in your note you said Draco Malfoy was on his way?”
That night when Harry was lying in bed, unable to sleep, he was staring at the ceiling. There were a million questions bouncing around in his brain, preventing him from falling asleep. He just wanted Malfoy to tell him, straight up, what was going on.
the law, Potter, and let me warn you, you’re treading on
Harry reached the small platform that folded the stairs in the other direction, and he almost had a heart attack when he saw a dark figure nearly bump into him. Harry gasped silently, he was too agitated to not be startled by anything unexpected. In the scarce light of the night, Harry saw Malfoy’s hair glow a bit in the dark. For a second, Harry was ashamed that he’d gotten caught trying to sneak into Malfoy’s bed, that is, until the man spoke.
obvious?
“No, I’m sorry,” Malfoy’s response took Harry by surprise, ”I don’t know why I’m like this, I always push everyone away.” He looked positively pained in the face, and Harry felt a very strong wave of pity wash over him. He had another urge to put his hand on top of Malfoy’s, that was lying there on the table, but didn’t think it would be the right time.
Harry felt like he was going daft. He never wanted to leave this bed, leave Malfoy’s side. That was the main problem for Harry – he thought that his apartment would feel much less lonely if Draco was there, waiting for him, when he got home in the evening. He would love to settle down with someone, and right now, he couldn’t think of doing that with anyone else. He was well and truly gone for Malfoy. He wanted the man in his bed, in his house, in his life. It was mad, they had only been like this for a few days, and Harry was already planning everything out, even before the end of their week together. Maybe he should just give it some time, maybe things would work themselves out.
He had reached the Atrium and seen Malfoy there, wearing black jeans with the same coat as before, hair gleaming brightly in the light and eyes darting nervously at the ministry workers making their way through the enormous space, even though they didn’t seem all that interested in him. He hadn’t seemed any calmer when Harry had appeared by his side, practically jumping upon hearing his name called. Once he’d noticed it was Harry, though, he soon regained his composure and settled at voicing a remark about Harry’s lateness.
Harry frowned, he couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Never in a million years would he have relied on
“Grandfather of Dargan Ridgenorth, no doubt,” Harry nodded. It was hard for him to forget that he was no longer on the case, “very interesting.”
“Fine, but don’t keep me waiting too long,” Harry frowned and moved away, pulling his hands from under Draco’s shirt.
get to have it all? Wanker probably already lived in a mansion with that redhead Weasley and their ten kids, all the while acting, or probably truly being, a humble servant of the law who “never asked for any of it”. Potter’s endless obliviousness annoyed Draco beyond compare.
“Lovely, I assume I’m free to go?” Malfoy asked, but did not wait for a response before getting up from his chair. He was already buttoning up his outer robe. Harry just waved his hand approvingly and the door opened slowly once more, but he couldn’t stop himself from standing up as well. Should he shake Malfoy's hand goodbye? The blond man had apparently already made the decision to not repeat the action, and was now striding over to the door.
“Piers!” Hadrian blinked. “Nuture versus nature, do you know the answers?”
“I had a dream that we had a son once. He had Severus’ hair, and my eyes, the color before I was devoted to the dark arts. I don’t remember his name, but it had felt so real. I could vividly see him playing with Nagini on the floor with a stuffed dragon that had a handkerchief. I almost thought it was real when I’d woken. I think…. If we ever did have a son. I think he’d look a bit like young Hadrian does.” Severus squeezed his bicep, ignoring the twinge that screamed in the back of his head.
And she despaired.
Severus do you know a good barrister?”
In all his years he’d always looked forward to the day he’d go to Hogwarts, and it was finally sinking in that he was
Hadrian’s laugh was a guttural hiss.
There was a time crunch, but there was also no reason to rush like a Gryffindor. He’d sleep on it, look at the lists in the morning to see if he’d miss anything and a make a decision. The back up plan as always was to throw himself out the window and crawl to freedom in the dead of night. Hadrian sighed softly and got up, yanking off the duvet and pulling it under the bed with him as he crawled into the safe space.
, but Hadrian walked in from the kitchen and any soft disappointment faded away. Hadrian’s long dark hair was held up in his signature high ponytail, bangs and fringe gently curling around those wide cheeks. A short apron tightened his waist to an impossible angle and hid a good portion of his sinfully tight light blue jeans and his maroon V-neck.
, when Alex couldn’t even get a bloody wave. Cooing with a disgustingly sweet and devoted tone that didn’t match the apathetic boy he’d seen Harry twisted into.
Draco was glad that Hadrian didn’t know what a heritage test meant for purebloods.
Plopping himself at the desk he labeled two papers with pros and cons.
“I always wanted a sibling, but my mother said I was blessing enough. I really think she just can’t have more children and didn’t want to think about it. Having a kinda twin must be cool. I never caught your name however?” Hadrian blinked. Oh right. He just assumed Laney introduced him.
The yellow and white boa snickered and slithered up her master’s chest. More firmly pushing herself into his jaw and affectionately scenting it. That was the second time his therapy had been brought to his mind. He doubted the headmaster would let him leave the school, however. He’d continue in the summer, and if it got worse he’d talk to Laney.
“He got away, what do we do?”
Feeling marginally better about the door (even if he knew it wasn’t actually secure) he took stock. His head was foggy, but there was no damage. Even his leg felt fine. That was good, next. Hadrian searched the room. Parchment, quills and ink in the desk. Useful. Various posters of Quidditch teams he’d never heard of or his brother’s useless books, which he’d never read. Not useful. A rug, warm at least, if James took away his sheets. Bed that was crimson and mussed up from his wake up call. Window, but he was high up in the Manor, he’d break his legs. Crawling was a last resort, but not one he was above using if he had to. His closet held clothes of differing sizes and varying amounts of use. Thrift stores? Hadrian grimaced as he amended the statement. Hand me downs from his brother.
Draco sighed, "It's not that, it's-" he waved at his book "-never mind, better for you if you didn't know."
"My mother's letter said that the ceremony would be during break. Do you think your parents would ambush you like that?" she asked. Draco thought of his Father. He wouldn't dare argue against him, especially in person. If Draco hadn't already known, if he was surprised with a betrothal ceremony, he would be obedient. Obedient as always.
"What can you do to help? Changing the times you meet. Making the times more random would be lovely, actually," Draco concluded.
Glass fell from the ceiling. Loud moans of the shelves leaning from the force of the spells. Screaming from all sides. White mist floated up to Draco's knees as he ran through the rain of white mist. Death Eaters struggled not to be hit by the falling glass while trying to obtain Potter.
His only friend as a child was Dobby.
They walked together to the Great Hall. Draco walked closer than he normally would to just an acquaintance. He let their arms brush as he showed casual interest in Astoria.
Daphne nodded, "Me too, but I hope there's cake, or custard, at least."
His parents broke into a fight. They yelled at each other in tones Draco had never heard from either of the lips. Narcissa pointed at Draco, forcing Lucius to face what he had brought into their home.
Draco's chest swelled whenever he saw the door, appearing before him in an enthusiastic greeting. He hurried to the door, his heart pounding in his chest as he opened the door.
"Merlin, you're a Weasley?" he realized. "My greatest sympathies." Draco turned to face Weasley. Alfie remained next to Draco. Potter was at his friend's side. Draco couldn't bring himself to meet his eyes, so he focused on Weasley.
Draco cast a silencing charm on the door before his panic sobs broke him. His knees buckled, they hit with a bruising force onto the tiled floor. His ribs collapsed into his lungs as he gasped for air. His vision blurred as his spine tightened with his grief.
Pansy burst through the silence with her shrill laughter. Pansy was clinging to the arm of a flattered Montague. Daphne instantly scowled at the addition. Draco tensed, there was a reason he had been ignoring both Daphne and Pansy for the last couple of weeks. Pansy new how to hit where it hurts.
"I'll go on ahead," Blaise sighed, an understanding nod in Draco's direction, no words were needed between them. He left without another glance.
Potter's eyes widened, his lips tightened. He was so scared to loose someone else. "You don't have to," Potter's voice quivered.
Sorry for the super late update, the last three weeks have been crazy with tons of stuff. One of those things was that I got engaged!!!!
“What’s wrong?” Potter still had his hands on him. Potter was leaning into him. He looked so concerned.
Potter, were was Potter?
"I gave that to her when we were betrothed," he explained, his tongue heavy in his mouth.
No one was in the common room when he stepped out into the hallway. Potter quickly pulled him under the invisibility cloak. "Hi," a brilliant smile greeted him.
Draco took a shaking breath, trying to calm himself so that he doesn't continue to give more information than he means to. "If you have suggestions about how I teach Potter Occlumency, I'm all ears. Just remember, they are just suggestions. Nothing more," he stated.
"If I'm here, you know how big it was," was her answer. "You forgot to put the charm up?"
"I still shouldn't take it out on you," Potter insisted.
Draco blinked. There was an itch. He shouldn't ask, he already knew the answer, but… "Professor?"
"You wouldn't get it," she whispered to him, her face close to his to avoid eavesdroppers. Her eyes knitted in concern, her voice low but shaky.
"You're muggle born, correct?" Draco tilted his head, a chillingly friendly expression on his face.
Draco watched them go, a strange detachment taking over him. He continued looking for his mother. Walking by students being enclosed in their parents embraces. Families were collecting their luggage before leaving. Loud chatter continued around him before thinning into intimate conversations that Draco was circling around.
"I'm about to stick you into the toilet," threatened Draco.
Draco entered the lavatory, which was empty, as expected. He kept his back towards the entrance, not sure if he could face Potter's scorn.
"Twenty points from Gryffindor for language, Fred," he punished.
"Why? What's wrong?" he investigated.
"You sure do know a way to a girl's heart," Pansy laughed.
"HOW?" his mother beaded her fist into his chest. "How could you?!" she shoved him into the wall. Her voice echoed with the pain that tore into her soul.
The silence between them made Draco stomach turn, "yes, well, I caught them on my Prefect rounds, so I thought you should know, as you're their Head of House. Now you know, so… I'm… going to go… if I may, Professor," he stuttered before shutting his mouth firmly.
Draco entered the Room of Hidden Things, the room had taken its usual form for him.
Potter shrugged, playing with his sweater sleeve again. Draco moved closer to Potter, wanting to be in his presence. Potter looked up at Draco, "Daphne Greenglass," Potter stated. Draco rose his eyebrows for Potter to go on. "You two… seem to be spending a lot of time together," Potter prompted.
"Isn't that disgusting?" Pansy mocked as she looked down the large table. Bulstrode sat across Blaise and Theo. "Practically a blood traitor that one," Pansy hissed about Theo.
"Nothing, I know nothing. That's the problem. I think she's… it's like when she first came to school after her dad died," she warned.
"Scars?" Pansy raised her eyebrows.
"He knows I pushed you down the stairs," Draco told only the half-truth. He suspected Severus was pissed about a number of things Draco had been doing.
"Any bright ideas?"
Draco turned to Theo, only to be hit over the head with a textbook. Draco stood, following Theo out of the Great Hall, laughing. Draco had to be careful to stay at least an arm's length away, as Theo kept trying to hit Draco with as much force as he could.
Lucius was constantly shoved aside by their lord. He wanted to prove that he was still powerful, if only to himself. He would grind Professor Lupin to dust just to prove his own power. If Draco said the wrong thing, that anger would be directed at him. He didn't have a death wish. He whispered to Professor Lupin, who would be easy to manipulate. "Please," Draco laced his voice with false vulnerability, "don't make it any worse."
"Stop…Merlin, you didn't do anything wrong, why would you think that?" Potter hushed, meeting Draco's eyes.
"Talk to the toilet, Professor," he said, glaring at Severus. Severus's jaw clenched, he pinched the bridge of his noise.
Daphne took a drag from her cigarette. She pinched her lips together in mock thought. "Well…" she started, "I smoke," was her insight.
"It's a pleasure to meet you. Harry has only said good things."
"You're not going to think my foot is very lady like up your ass," Daphne growled. The crowed room hushed.
What she would have done was useless to him.
The collective gasp of the students wasn't enough for Severus to correct Pansy's outburst, perhaps Severus was worried about her directing her embarrassment into anger. Perhaps Severus was too busy glaring at Draco to notice.
Six, seven if Draco counted himself-
"You're such an insufferable git, Draco," Potter pointed out, splaying over the couch in front of the fireplace. The room was warm enough that lighting a fire would be unnecessary, so a lamp on a side table near Potter's head was on.
"It'll be okay, I promise, I won't let anything happen to you."
Potter paid and left.
Pansy laid on the couch, taking up the entirety of the furniture with her legs, despite the other students sitting on the floor. No one bothered her,  and Draco didn't blame them Pansy had become a viper ready to strike anyone who set her off.  Pansy stared at the ceiling, her long black hair fanning out across the cushions. She had been there since before dinner, which she probably skipped because Draco hadn't been there to remind her to eat. She was thinning, her uniform already too big for her frame.
"Here," Blaise took out his wand. "Aguamenti," he enchanted, providing Draco with a steady stream of clear, cool water. The instant Draco dipped his hands into the stream, the water darkened slightly with blood. The water was cool enough that the bruises on his knuckles sighed in relief. When Draco was finished washing, he cupped the water, bring the cool liquid to his mouth to clench his thirst.
Potter took him to the Astronomy Tower. Professor Sinistra lived on one of the main levels, so Draco complained loudly about the stairs, having Potter bent over in laughter. Potter was always quick to a laugh after Occlumency lessons, he needed the pickup.
"Yeah I am," Potter was so casual about it.
He woke up three days after to the smell of his favorite breakfast.
"What? Really?" Potter leaned forward, his face full of worry. "What not? Are you injured?"
"Oh who, yourself?"
The break from his father's abuse gave Theo the room to grow. He had an easy smile about him, one that was only facing Blaise. The summer only allowed Blaise to become even more handsome, having filled out in his jaw and shoulders. Blaise met his gaze then, and gave a friendly wave.
"Again Potter!"
"I told her-" Lupin made his way through his wide smile "- I said, 'Let's come back inside so we can try this again', which she yelled-"
"And, correct me if I am wrong, but didn't it take you two and a half years to master Occlumency? Even with a mentor?" Draco pointed out.
"Watch it you idiot- oh, it's you," he heard a familiar voice snap. He turned his head, recognizing the long brown hair in a braid.
He finished his smoke too quickly. He thought of using his last one, but he wanted to save that for when things got truly fucked. He knew things would get worse still.
Montague opened his mouth, then closed it. His face was red, he was constantly shifting his feet. He had lost before the fight even started. Draco was slightly disappointed, this was almost too easy.
"Complete the potion. Seriously I'm curious."
Would Potter still care for him when he discovers that he was a coward? Someone to bow at the knee to kiss the boot that would kick him in the teeth?
The ground steadied beneath their feet, the grass reaching their ankles. Students milled around, waiting for class to begin. Draco watched as his peers laughed, for once not being the only one detached from the rest of his peers joyousness, as Theo and Blaise were silent next to him. Students gathered around the hut, a short distance away from the entrance, some sitting down, enjoying the weather.
Everything was more work, no reward, little recognition. Hall monitoring was boring, dull. Draco contemplated slamming his head against the wall to get a concussion to finally have a reasonable excuse to stop walking these bloody halls. They were starting to bleed together painfully. Was he in the north hallway or south? In the dungeons or just in an older part of the castle? Was he going to get lost, starve, and be stuck on hall monitor duty in his pathetic afterlife? Who knows.
Hadrian tightened his grip on his wand. Lily flinched again and tried to entice him closer with open arms.
“Okay. Draco wanted me to try something. If you know it, it’s called Legilimens. This is going to hurt unless you are aware and accepting of me going into your psyche. Would you like me to do so?” The brunet brushed his hair over his shoulder and relaxed against the table with a gentle smile.
“Draco’s got Suni and Marissa! Let’s go!”
“Lucius has to ask you some questions without us around. He’s here to help us though in case the Potters try to pull some nasty actions to get custody of you. But we’ll be close by alright? Laney, take care of your brother. Hadrian, keep your sister out of as much trouble as you can.”
Albus had been… concerned, with Harry’s attitude. He was still her sweet boy, but he seemed to resent James. Lashing out at him every time James even got close to him. Distancing himself from everyone. Even his brother. Then, when Harry had left Alex slowly began missing his brother, clammering for stories and wanting to see him again. Losing all his animosity. Just as Albus hoped Harry had.
“There’s memory loss. There isn’t a doubt about that, if it was due to any tampering either you or they covered any trace of it very well. Was your last blackout your school year?” A nod. “Then seeing as you’re out of school, I wouldn’t worry too much. If you have another blackout, let me know as soon as possible. As well as give me any people who might have been around you.”
“Hadrian was really looking forward to Defense, but the teacher is a little dull.  I love potions! I’m not great at them though, it’s basically the same as chemistry! I was horrible at it, but it was still my favorite. Snape’s tutoring Greg, Victor, and I, but I think I just don’t have
She was a true task master. In charge of his physical therapy and healing, she pulled no punches. Forcing him to do his exercises daily and dragging his ass into doing the most helpful and horrid things imaginable. Whether it was forcing him to walk up and down the manor stairs until he was shaking from the effort, or tossing him into the pool with his arms bound and a bubble head charm to get him to tread water with his bad leg. He probably wouldn’t have healed as completely if it weren’t for her firm but well intentioned love.
“You’re the other Potter twin! I thought you went missing? People said you were…” Hadrian gave a bitter smile.
The raven tightened his ponytail and gave himself one last glance in the mirror. He really did look sharp. A white button up paired with a liquid black vest that clung to him like a second skin, Draco had fitted him with a sleek tie that matched his eyes and slacks that hugged all the right places. He looked good. (And his ass looked fantastic).
“Never call my sssister that ever again. Unlesss you’d like me to wring your neck until you are a lifelessss puddle on the floor.” Alexander paled until he was paper white and Hadrian released him, letting the lion slide to the floor as he returned to his friend’s sides. His arm shooting out to grab Laney as she giggled and swooned dramatically.
Throwing one last torture curse at Hadrian, the raven bit back a scream with a gasp. Body convulsing on the ground until James disappeared around the corner and Hadrian coughed wetly. Dragging in harsh breaths. Hadrian reached for the pieces of his broken wand and pulled them close to his chest. Not daring to move his leg.
And if he wasn’t damn right, puzzle it was. Ministry B.S. not letting him drop the last name because of some stupid heirship and voting seats.
Severus ignored it.
“How can it be so bad here? You’re my brother! You’re supposed to love us! DAD! DAD!”
Not only did his brother attack him seeming unprovoked in the Great Hall (a public space). He got
“Are we counting when I thought we were courting or when you got your head out of your ass?”
Alex was sitting nearly six feet away from the other three and each time he tried to scoot closer Laney simply turned towards him spitting proverbial fire and glaring. Hadrian was laying on his back with the little one using his chest as a pillow and seemed more than happy to just lie there and let it happen. Severus had to bite his lip hard as Alex crept forward and Laney threw a pen at him while hissing viciously.
Rage.
“Great, we’ll actually be on time for a weekend breakfast. What did you want to do after?”
“Sirius?!”
“No.”
“Thought not.”
“Oh, I know you hate James Potter, Hadrian wrote me a letter nearly hysterically laughing about how much you hated the Potters. Said he saw it, James was a cruel git to my son growing up and Hadrian remembers
“Blaise?”
“Draco? Something to share with the class?” All the adults looked at him. He took a breath.
Mechanically, Lily dished out dinner into bowls.
. But he cleared his throat in an attempt to save face and not look like a love-sick fool.
Hadrian had a weird feeling about this.
Shoveling down the peanut butter sandwich the elf left him and silently thanking the creature, Harry tore through the book. Various forms of Potter Family Magic that he would never use it if killed him, but there was one thing in every Grimoire and it was what he needed to find. Hadrian’s grin was bloody and vicious when he finally found it near the back.
“Twitches has a completely different context, different age, was a muggle movie of magic and I’m a man if you hadn’t noticed?” The red head giggled into her brother’s shoulder.
“Good morning love,” Hadrian smiled. Draco grumbled but smiled back. Glancing around the room at all the adults before his mate handed him a cup of coffee with his left hand. Right still clutching his half eaten pastry.
First was easy, Alex always bothered him at dinner, the only meal all the houses could attend at the same time. Therefore, it was fully in his rights to have his familiar. The fact Suni was under his clothes and basically out of sight was only because she loved skin contact and warmth and certainly not because of the fact the second Alex tapped his shoulder and Suni poked up and glared at him to poking her he jumped nearly a foot in the air and shrieked. His little sycophant follower run cursing up a storm about how ‘slimey snakes needed to die’ ensured disruption of the peace and got them four dentitions a piece for disruption and bullying. The point loss was devastating, but the Gryffindors seemed annoyed but indifferent.
His leg had healed amazingly after his ordeal and the ministry. The best part was Lucius insistence to replace his wand with a custom wand. He mourned his holly and phoenix feather wand near daily, however the Malfoy Senior had gotten his hand on a search warrant for the Potter Manor and found the feather his core was made out of in Potter’s office, in a warded desk drawer. In France, his new wand was born, a birch wand with his phoenix feather core responded more beautifully than his premade holly wand ever had.
Cons- Underage Magic (might get the Ministry here quicker if they have to arrest me and everyone here. Not a bad idea).
And Hadrian knew no more than the dark surrounding him.
“Haden’s mine! Go ‘way!” The little girl burrowed her head into Hadrian’s collar and Alex was gifted with a poisonous glare from his biological twin. But just before a fight could break out and Dumbledore could intervene their mother straightened.
A knock interrupted him from his thoughts. Hadrian’s head snapped to the door. His hands immediately reaching up to worry at his tie. The door knocked again and his throat constricted, instinctively Hadrian dropped down and crawled under the band. One hand clutching at his wand, the other grabbing one of the bed posts.
No. NO.
“What’s your home then, if not Britain?” Hadrian gave a radiant smile.
“Nothing.”
his brother.
“What would be quicker? Waiting for a warrant as is or filing all the paperwork to destroy Potter legally and then gaining the warrant?”
“Once the order goes into effect, he won’t be able to get sixty feet of you and as for revenge, we can do interview with the paper and absolutely ruin his day that way.” All the papers were swiftly signed and immediately Mama was sweeping him into her arms and planting kisses and whatever skin she could reach. Mother watching fondly and squeezing his shoulder with a proud smirk. Lucius was packing away his brief case with an equally triumphant and proud look, “I say we celebrate with dinner before we go back home. What do you kids think?”
The dour man bit back a grimace, Sirius Black. Hadrian original godfather, who was enraged enough at the Potter’s actions to actually break a centuries old alliance and leave for France. Fucking over quite a few of Albus’ plans in the process. For all his faults he knew Sirius adored Hadrian and would do anything if he knew Hadrian was back. Longbottom had quietly mentioned to him while he was interrogating the Lords and Ladies that she’d overheard Sirius screaming that if Hadrian was a squib he’d forsake his magic and raise him muggle himself with Lupin.
Draco hummed, “Do you think Laney’s awake?”
“Firstly, how are the boys doing? Settling in alright?” Minerva, who’d been watching quietly started first.
Draco was sitting across from her, being the one to hold her baby sister. He was like her, quietly distraught as he tried his best to soothe the five year old. Dodging floundering limbs with impressive grace and pressing Annabee’s face to snuffle into his robes pathetically. Vince and Greg were on either side of her, caging her in and keeping her propped up when she felt like a marionette with no strings. Suni laid on her lap limply, sulking with her eyes closed in despair at the loss of her speaker. Laney didn’t know what she was thinking, and she couldn’t ask how to make her feel better.
Perhaps tutoring wouldn’t remiss with those three… A small explosion sounded and the two laughed softly, grinning like children with an inside joke, or a secret. Snape snarling and yelling at Gryffindors while subtly trying to shape up his house’s side of the classroom.
“She can be a loud terror when she wants professor, we know. No need to sugar coat it, there’s a reason Hadrian’s the voice of reason.” Snape needed to stop being blindsided by how much
“You can’t be so light when you tell people your parents are dead. They’re going to think your nuts.”
This was coming home. Staying home.
His Lord and the other adults froze, staring at his son’s hand. Draco paused, giving his mate a quick glance up and down. Hadrian usually morphed the love bites away, so there were no marks. The blonde frowned a little bit in confusion when his uncle and his lord leveled him with twin venomous glares. Draco blinked again, the shimmer of red catching his eye.
And he was left in the ashes. A grown man going to face another grown man, one who’d changed for the worst. One had thrown one of his children away and allowed him to suffer and be hurt in ways no child should. The other had begged for that child, unable to have his own, and now could only avenge the child and all the time that was lost from him.
“Zabini.”
“Diffindo.” The skin and muscle of his calf parted easily with the curse and James paid no mind as Hadrian screamed and writhed on the ground. James opened the trunk in the room and stuffed anything he could find that could serve to send a message or entertain the piece of shit, making double sure to swipe the phoenix feather from the floor. Slamming it shut once he’d finished.
“I thought I was going to say screw it and get expelled before I was even sorted when they prick started talking to us and trying to steal my brother. If he tries anything I’m severing off his limbs and beating him to death with his still bleeding arms.” Violent, the three pure bloods turned pale at the grotesque threat, but it seemed Potter- Dragma, the male Dragma, was unimpressed. Or rather unaffected.
Ultimately, pretty useless against most wizards as there was apparation, sleep potions, stunning, and shields. But it filled Hadrian with no small amount of love for her. Letting her care for him. Mother had never been the warmest person alive, but he’d known she cared. It had actually been her that he was closest to. She soothed the past trauma, didn’t force him into talks about feelings or physical comfort, instead she was an anchor. Stable. Forcing him to get up and work on a schedule, taking him to the shooting range with her, teaching him how to be a better person for the people he loved.
A sigh echoed through the halls, “Maybe you’ll feel better for dinner.” And her footsteps echoed down the hall.
they were so casually talking about. Sirius had had enough.
“Go to sleep love, we take it step by step in the morning.”
Photographs of all their friends and the five years (summers and one holiday technically) they’d spent together. Hadrian’s paintings hung on the wall, with little knick-knacks they’d collects strewn on shelves. The blanket Draco had given Hadrian for Christmas when they were thirteen laid on the living room couch.
With that, Severus drew his wand and felt the familiar tug of being pulled into someone else’s mind. A blink later and Severus was in a snowy forest, it wasn’t warm, but the cold was comforting. The dark-haired man looked through the trees and saw a large ice rink, a figure was gliding easily on the ice as he approached. He could feel content, calmness, level-headedness. Severus waited along the edge as the boy skidded to a stop in front of him, a wide grin on his lips.
“You may be my godson, but that is my little boy and I will poison you in your sleep if you hurt him. Are we understood.” Draco relaxed, smiling down at his fiancé.
“Barely a week apart actually! I’m born on July 23
“I was hoping you’d know!” Sara laughed again. “He’s such a sweet boy, Laney’s a little devil. He really blossomed you know? When I met him he was this skinny and quiet, so quiet little boy. Bones that jutted out of his skin like they were trying to run away, bruises all over his face, and a glare that honestly unsettled me. I knew though, I knew that hurt people hurt others, usually not on purpose. So I pulled him into my fold, gave him a home, and watched him stitch himself back together. I never regret it. I love him so much.”
Draco gave another barking laugh. “Your presence this year is going to be scandal enough. I’m almost disappointed I won’t get a front row seat to the show you’re going to make when they call your name. I want to see that stupid headmaster’s face when you’re sorted.”
“Worry not child, I won’t allow the Potters to interfere with your life. That’s why I’m here as your mothers’ legal counsel and I assure you in any legal battle I will win quite firmly. Draco would be rather cross with me if I didn’t. So, try not to worry. Be a child and have fun, study hard. I’ll finish up with your parents.” The red head girl grinned happily and bounced up and away, dragging the raven haired boy with her. Long ponytail flicking behind him like a cat tail.
-I won’t sit here with my thumbs up my ass doing nothing
Not once did anyone try to heal him or ask him to eat his plate.
Lily blinked but nodded, “Yes, we got him a snowy owl for his birthday this year. He named her Hedwig. Are snakes allowed?”
“Stop manipulating your brother Anna, we both know you have him wrapped around your finger.” Her cold eyes glanced toward the family sitting next to her kids and Hadrian felt the temperature in the room plummet at least fifty degrees. Immediately she and her wife were firmly planted between their kids and the other family. Sara was the first to speak, and even she’d lost her care free smile.
Lucius shoved back any unease, he was a child and a perfectly sane and polite child who was simply powerful and upset for understandable reasons. Magic could be uncontrollable and spurred on by strong emotions, especially when untampered by age and experience. Draco talked about the boy as a treasure, quite infatuated with him honestly. The raven was good. Smiling gently and as calmingly as possible, he took Hadrian’s balled fists into his own grasp.
His mind ticked at him again, his Occlumency shields scratching at each other.
“Then buck up and act like it. C’mon.”
“He’s claiming there’s no way we can support three children without an inheritance, but we’re fine! I can prove it! We live in a safe neighborhood on base, the kids had activities, they went to school. They never wanted for food or clothing or love… I don’t want them to take my baby.”
“Confringo!” His first tooth.
He bounced Annabee in his arms as he wondered what restaurant his mothers were going to choose to celebrate; he hoped it was going to be a sushi place. Honestly, there was nothing more he loved than a spicy tuna roll and Suni was always happy as a clam when he brought home some smoked salmon for her to munch on. His spoiled little girl. She was probably lazing around in the Malfoy’s sunroom, she was going to adore the self-heating basking spot he got her for Christmas (now Yule). If Marissa didn’t harass her too much to share in the warmth.
James frowned again, “Alex said he went up to greet Harry before the sorting ceremony and he got ignored all the way to when Harry was sorted into Slytherin rather than our family house. He was distraught that after five years the first thing his twin did was snub him.”
“This would all be fixed in Hadrian let me beat him up.”
Snapping back, Hadrian bit his tongue hard. Shit. Maybe he did need more therapy after all if this was what happened when he stopped going… The raven shook it off. He just needed to survive this meeting with the headmaster and take it one day at a time.
Tonight was the night.
“How about friends, do you have any friends in school, or from your old muggle school?” Laney frowned and hummed.
“He skipped dinner, he won’t be skipping breakfast.” Well, actually Tippy had served him dinner. He’d simply avoided dining with his kidnappers. “I’m going in.”
“Come out on the balcony with me.” Hadrian didn’t fight or question it as he let Draco pull him up from the vanity and lead him to their small master patio. Hadrian’s herbs swayed softly in the brisk night wind, still blooming in the beginning spring. The stars shone brilliantly above them, making Hadrian smile with tired eyes. He’d never get sick of this view.
“Mr. Potter.” Hadrian didn’t respond at first until the man behind him repeated it again and Draco tugged his sleeve. The five of them turned around and there was the dark man, Professor Snape, Head of Slytherin House. “It would do well to answer to your name, Mr. Potter.”
If you have any opinions about how you want this posting schedule to go, lmk and I hope you enjoy this little angst fest!
Albus was quick to try and do some damage control. “Now, we weren’t insinuating anything like that-“ Erin glared at him and Sara grinned.
“I wasn’t going to, I was going to make myself, what did you call it? Melt your dick off chicken, but I went for a safer option again. Tatertot hot dish is more of an American dish… but most people like it just fine.” Severus leaned forward a little bit.
Narcissa smiled, “We should do a heritage test at Gringotts today! We all could use a nice rest, we can explore Diagon Alley and make a fun day out of it. What do you think? Draco?”
I shake my head, “He’s just tired. It’s late for him and remaining clear always draws too much of his energy. He will be fine tomorrow.”
“Did Dragon scare you, Draco?” I smile softly. To my surprise it earns me a huff and I laugh in happiness, “I am taking that as a no even though it was the reason. Don’t worry,” I rub the back of his hand again, “Completely normal. After months without any social contact it’s not surprising that suddenly having another living being apart from me here might startle you,” he sags into the cushioning of his chair and turns his gaze away. I shake my head amusedly then tug on his arm, “Come on. That was enough excitement for today. How about we get you back to your own room?” he stares at me, “Without any pesky cats trying to get your attention, right?” I tease him but he only tilts his head.
“I am really sorry. I’m new,” the stranger explains, “I still have to learn to contain myself all the time to not scare any of the patients.”
“That’s good.”
I wonder, what you would do if you knew. Would you curse me or would you try to make friends again? I will never find out I guess. I replaced your memories with false ones, so you will never remember. Hah, there is one more thing. I am sure you would flip if you knew that one. Our night was not without consequences even after I erased your memory. You might not know it but in the magical world everyone can carry children no matter what gender.
“Kariana’s Dream,” he frowns now, “My horse. Father bought her for my tenth birthday. Well, actually he wanted to buy her brother, but I went with him to the stable and managed to convince him to buy Kari instead. That stallion wasn’t nice,” suddenly his eyes fly wide, “Uh, I wasn’t afraid of course. Just…” he searches for words, “I worked much better with Kari and…”
A short time later he is safely on her back, trying to get into the stirrups. Seeing him not really manage it, I do it for him, even if it earns me a dismayed glare from grey eyes. In response I simply grin up to him. His right hand grabs the rains loosely and Andrea starts walking again.
As I open the door, suddenly a smile comes to my face. The scene that presents itself to me is actually nicely peaceful. Draco is sitting on the floor, the sun shining through the big windows highlighting his hair and skin, giving it a more golden tone than he usually has. There is a calm expression on his face, a few stray strands of hair falling in over his cheeks. He is humming lowly to himself, his one moving hand alternatively stroking Dragon who is laying in his lap and pointing at the pictures of horses in the book in front of him. The cat is purring and occasionally licking the still unresponsive left hand positioned next to him.
“I am so sorry,” I repeat, “But I will do my best to make it up to you.”
She also makes no move to hold out a hand or something which seems to calm the blonde, despite the fact that he keeps looking at the horses from the corners of his eyes every second. I have long vanished his stuffed toy or it would have fallen into the dirt when he reached for the horse. He still only uses one hand after all.
He chokes on his breath and Dragon purrs in an attempt to comfort him, “He doesn’t really care who he tortures as long as he hears someone scream.”
Hope you enjoyed it nonetheless. Comments and kudos are always appreaciated and see you next time.
“Okay,” I nod, “I couldn’t pinpoint that even if I tried. It started out in sixth year when I saw how bad he looked. Over the time until the end of the war I discovered that he didn’t want to be a death eater at all. I understand being forced into your role and probably started to feel some kind of kinship to him. I spoke for him at the trials because the truth had to be brought out and when I saw the injustice done to him, I tried my best to find a way to get him out of prison. When I managed to and he was in no shape to take care of himself I took him in.”
"Of course I can, but I didn't see anything."
Draco sighed, this really wasn't what he needed right now. Pansy was a shell of a person, hollowed out by fear and hot anger. Draco had hoped that she had fixed herself, somehow, plastered over her cracks enough to function.
Ice filled Draco's lungs. His words caught in his chest. He should lie, make her feel safe, but she wasn't safe. "He's terrifying," Draco finally confirmed, "He's like death himself."
"Oh, so I see you haven't taken to the lessons then," Severus quipped.
The Weaslet was leaning heavily on Lovegood. Her ankle at an unnatural angle, her face pale. Ron was holding Lovegood's hand, looking dazed and mumbling as he looked around the large room.
"What, don't tell me you don't see it. You think about sucking face too, you shouldn't be so judgmental."
Maybe he was stepping into the man the Dark Lord was starting to sculp him into.
"Well, how much is that worth, really?" Draco's father snapped.
"Oh, shit." Draco sat up, his cheek wet. He looked around, looking for the apparent danger. Theo just smiled, "You're drooling." Draco wiped his face with the back of his hand. He stood up, he couldn't fall asleep. "Go ask Daphne for help so you can get some sleep," Theo ordered.
"After this, we're even, deal?" Pansy didn't want to be in debt to Draco. Owing a favor could be tricky if you don't set the terms yourself.
“If he doesn’t love you after everything you are doing for him now, he’s a stupid idiot,” she laughs and I join in after a moment.
“Food…?” he says carefully, sounding somewhere between complaining and unsure whether he is allowed to ask that.
“I don’t give a flying fuck!” I interrupt him, growling, “The ministry knows about my roommate, so I don’t care in the least what kind of business you have. I won’t answer one fucking question until they send someone with at least a sense of decency and compassion. Not to mention the little thing called patience. And if I see or hear from you ever again I am telling the minister to throw you out. Am I making myself clear?”
She chuckles, “Of course. A determined boy who loves him and would give everything to finally allow him to live the life he ever wanted and never could have before.”
The moment the spell hits him, his whole figure crumbles. Every muscle goes lax and he falls into the armchair. I can shoot forward just in time to keep him from falling straight off the chair too and land on the ground. I sigh in relief when I feel his shallow but steady breathing on my arm.
“You know as well as I do, that you can’t go out into crowds yet. And St. Mungos means a lot of people,” I explain.
I glare at him, “But he is also a boy who has been forced into his role as much as I have. I am pretty sure neither his father nor Voldemort ever asked whether he really wanted to be a death eater. I can understand him in that,” I shake my head, “Besides the fact that the court was simply not just. I can’t let it stand like that. If we start with isolating and being unfair to the death eaters now, we are not much better than them, who did the same thing to muggleborns.”
“Sure, can you remain clear?” I ask back.
He throws me another wary look before squatting down on the floor and digging out a brush and some kind of plastic oval with ridges and a hold. He stands back up and half turns towards the horse’s door, but never completely putting his back to me as if he expects me to hex him any moment. After a bit of fiddling he manages to unlock it and slip in with Shenan. As soon as her door creaks open, the mare retreats her head to welcome him inside. He strokes her head and murmurs lowly. She snorts and trustingly hangs her head while he steps up to her side. Using both hands he starts to run the brush over her fur for a few times, then drags the brush along the ridges of the plastic oval to get the accumulated dirt out. He repeats the process until he has covered one whole side of her and changes to the other by carefully ducking down under her neck. I lean against Shenan’s window and watch him until I can’t stop myself from asking.
“Okay,” the woman says to me, “I will lead Shenan and you help Draco up. Could you get him away from her back for a moment?”
His eyes are still unfocused, but they seem to drift to me as he very slowly tilts his head. Then he suddenly smiles. Not a real smile or his smirk from old times. But a crooked smile, a resigned one. The expression of a man who has nothing left to lose anymore. I can’t keep myself from pulling the frail and unresponsive body into my arms, just to reassure myself that he is indeed still alive and not just a ghost.
As far as I can see, the blonde doesn’t show the least bit of discomfort and the horses are keeping enough distance, so I’m not really worried.
“I’m sorry for pushing you this morning,” I mumble, “After hours of reading through medical terms that go over my head… Anyway, what all those books said is that especially at the beginning you should give the patient time to adjust,” my head falls onto the mattress next to him, “I promise when you wake up, I will be more careful. But for now, just sleep.”
I freeze, “What do you mean with his brain has shut down? He isn’t braindead.”
Another snort, his nose purposefully turning up further, “I am pretty sure you will notice when I will start babbling in child speech again.”
“You’re doing great,” I encourage him, only to earn myself another glare, “Can you walk?”
“Have you achieved something yet?”
Andrea eventually goes to collect him after he has adjusted the stirrups on his own as well. I can’t help but wonder how clear he is at the moment. Not completely, since his left arm seems still entirely unresponsive. I would guess most of what he is currently doing is muscle memory. He doesn’t have the coordination to get onto the horse on his own yet though, so I bring the steps with me when I join them in the middle of the hall.
He nods, making more notes on his board. Since he stays silent for a longer time I raise a brow, “Was that all?”
I repeat this process more times than I can count. I have to wash the cloth every few inches of skin. It’s unbelievable how dirty he is. That is far below any human living conditions. It wrings a pained and sarcastic snort out of me though when I compare him to how he acted back at Hogwarts. Always looking perfect, not a hair out of place (well, the first years at least). I was sure he spent longer in front of the bathroom mirror each day than our whole boys’ dorm together. Not one bit of that is left in him now. His skin is covered in layers of dirt. His hair hangs below his shoulder blades, stringy and tangled. The once so shining platinum blonde is a dirty grey now. I sigh as I push the greasy locks over his shoulder to start on his upper back. Once I have cleared away the dirt, I spot a whole network of scars, so many finer ones but also huge cuts. I shudder and supress another sob. He rips me out of my sad thoughts as he makes some kind of squealing sound as he splashes up more water with his right hand, effectively raining water over both of us. I sigh and run my hand over his head.
And the blonde manages the movement for the whole round, even gives an annoyed ‘Hey’ when she slows the palomino down after that.
At least only one day late this time.
He does his best to make his voice sound demanding, trying to recreate his old masks, but I can still hear the tremor in it, no matter how much he attempts to hide it. At his request I turn around in my chair. He is standing in the doorway, one arm poised in his side, pretending to be a mixture between bored and annoyed. But his left hand is clenching in the leg of his pants, clearly showing how uneasy he is. Fixing him with my eyes I think his request over. With taking him to the new stable I am trying to get him used to new environments with more people again. But we were only there this one time, three days ago. Not to mention he barely got in contact with any humans this time, only horses.
“A cat?” I can’t help but frown confused.
“That is going to take a long time. Do I really have to do this?”
Eventually though, after minutes of rubbing his arms and cuddling into his stuffed toy, he relaxes slowly again. His legs uncurl and fall back down, basically landing on my lap. His posture calms as well, a soft breath leaving him. I smile and take his hand to me, massaging it. His grey eyes connect with my gaze too. The panic is still caught in the deep orbs but it is starting to fade thankfully.
I can't believe it We finally have internet! A miracle has hapened!!
“You do?” I ask eagerly, showing that kind of interest in anything for the first time since the end of the war.
Nonetheless my whole body tingles with the itch to assure myself that Draco is still safe in his own room. So as soon as I am sure that I won’t fall if I let go of the sink, I hurry out of the bathroom.
“Spit it out,” I urge her on, “I might fall asleep otherwise.”
She nods, then tugs at my sleeve, “Come on, you need to sleep.”
“Of course I do. I - ,” he suddenly breaks off and presses a hand against his temple, “Argh, my head. What the hell is going on?”
“But I…” tears are running down her cheeks and my anger evaporates again.
I nod, a careful smile on my lips. She bustles away from me and somewhere further to the back. I wait patiently. A few moments later she comes back, something that looks like a white furball in her arms. She grins as she comes up to me. When she stops next to me, she holds the bundle of fur up to me. It turns out to be a young-looking cat with white fur, occasionally speckled with grey. Two bright blue eyes beam up at me and the small maw lets out a curious sound when the cat sees me. The shop keeper grins at me.
“Err, yes,” I clear my throat, “I am looking for a cat.”
“Yes, yes, that,” she waves it off, “He looks worse now. He is nothing but skin and bones now, deathly pale. Everything I could see of his skin is covered in bruises and cuts. And he looks like he hasn’t seen anything to clean himself since the day they put him in there.”
She nods, “Sure,” and holds out a hand to help me from the bed.
“Okay, first. You have known Draco Malfoy for quite some time, right? How did you meet him?”
“The second one.”
“Harry? Harry! What are you doing on the floor?” an agitated voice is the next thing I notice.
I shiver when we arrive in front of the huge building. That thing is ten times more ominous than the Malfoy Manor and that’s saying something. Still I pull my courage together and enter, Hermione always at my side. The guards at the entrance spring up.
He takes a deep breath, “While I agree with you that I am guilty of minor war crimes I must disagree on the first accounts. I have never killed any person, neither have I tortured as many as you try to pin on me. Not that I did it voluntarily to begin with. Also your accusation of… rape is completely wrong. I would never lower myself to that,” his eyes are strong as he gives his answer.
I groan pained, “I suspected it, but didn’t want to believe it,” a sob bubbles up again.
Dragon meows as he is probably gripped closer again, “Malfoy?” I ask as I enter the room, having learned not to call him by his first name when he has his clear moments.
“What’s this?”
“So where is she?” his eyes grow even wider, “You didn’t sell her, did you?”
Thank you for the comments and kudos. They are always appreciated.
But now I am standing in front of the massive black doors leading inside the huge white Manor. I swallow hard. As much as I would like to deny it I am nervous about entering the building. The mansion is still as ominous looking as ever. And the memories I connect with this house are not pleasant in the least at all. But this is nothing against living in Azkaban. So I take a deep breath and knock hard. A second later a loud crack announces the arrival of a house elf. One of the door wings swings open, revealing the small creature, clothed only in a dirty silver pillow case.
“No,” I stumble, “There is no one.”
“I can’t thank you enough for going through all this trouble. I know Draco was a git during school and you never liked him,” I smile at her.
The moment the loud voice said ‘ministry’, he started to scream. He throws his panicked weight in the opposite direction of me, nearly upsetting every balance either of us had. It’s the first time I have heard him make more than grunts, squeals or hums but that just makes it worse. His voice is higher pitched than I remember. His body is shaking once more and he is fighting my grip. In a different situation I would be happy about how much activity he is showing but right now all I want is for him to stop.
The first he grabs is Shenan’s bridle, pulling it onto his right shoulder. Then he turns to the saddles, completely forgoing the simpler girths Andrea used. When he reaches for the one labelled with the mare’s name, I reach out to stop him. But I retreat my hand again before touching him and instead speak up.
Of course he only stares at me in response. I can see the snout of the little dragon poking out under the blanket by his chest. He still has it pressed against his chest. I smile a little bit at that. Nonetheless I bend down and carefully straighten him up. With slow movements I animate him to help me lift him out of bed and onto his own feet. After wrapping a warm sleeping robe around him, I try to guide him to the door. Still I notice that he is even more reluctant than usual and his free right arm twitches back towards the bed unsurely. That’s when I notice that the dragon is still laying in the blankets. I give another sad smile and wandlessly summon the stuffed toy. As soon as it lands in my hand I press it back in his. His face twitches in what is his version of thanks, then he lets me lead him into the living room and his usual chair. There he presses animal back against his chest.
It’s a woman. She looks a bit younger than us, one or two years probably. She is beautiful too. Long brown hair in one braid that sways behind her back, ending above the waist. She has a soft, angular face with smooth, slightly tanned skin. Then I look at her eyes. They are glinting happily, green with blue. But green. Like Orion’s. Is she his mother? But why would he say that he doesn’t know her? Maybe you are ashamed because you were still underage when you got her pregnant, judging by Orion’s age. You were sixteen and she what? Fifteen, probably. I don’t want to know.
The door to his office was ajar, and Harry placed a polite knock on the doorframe before peering into the room. Evergrey was sitting behind his desk, studying a very large book, reading glasses propped on his long nose. Now he was glancing up from the volume and pushed his glasses on his forehead.
Harry could feel a bright red blush creep from his neck to his face. “Er, yes, I was… it didn’t work out in the end,” he tried to chuckle nonchalantly, but the voice got stuck to his throat, so he just ended up letting out an odd coughing sound. Talking about his love life with the git for a second time already made Harry start sweating again.
, Harry couldn’t help thinking,
“Oh shut it, he had a good frame,” Draco scoffed and sat up to lean on the headboard, “maybe Krum too, but not that much, he’s too skinny.” Excuse me? Harry happened to like skinny, thank you very much. However, he just settled to nod to himself, and then they were both quiet. The sun had climbed up, and was no longer shining directly into the room, the sea was glistening in the distance, Harry wanted to go to the beach. He couldn’t remember ever doing that, he wanted to feel the salty water on his feet and dig his toes in the sand. Just when he was about to suggest it, Malfoy suddenly continued, shaking Harry from his thoughts that had already gone astray, “There was another time, too, a much more unpleasant one, mind you.”
Draco studied Potter as his mind took him somewhere else. He was so determined to remind Draco he was something else besides the legacy of darkness he was given.
"Joke. A joke," he blabbed, "joking. Yes. Huh… Pansy is such a bitch," he crawled out from under the stairs. His neck sweating.
He was supposed to meet Potter tonight. He made sure to put on just enough of his cologne. No one asked where he was heading off to so close to bedtime. Everyone tends to mind their own business around him these days.
Potter pulled Draco closer to him, moving their clasped hands to rest on his chest as he absentmindedly moved his hand over Draco's forearm as he looked out the window.
Draco's jaw clenched, but he kept his face neutral at the inquiry. "What would you like to know?" he opened.
Draco entered the greenhouse, weaving around the other students who arrived before him. He takes his usual seat that was usually reserved for him by Zabini. Zabini, the perfect representation of tall, dark, and handsome, was the only other Slytherin in his Herbology class, which made their suffering mutual. Potter was also in this class, but, luckily, he paid Draco no mind, at least, not more than usual. A sly, snippy remark or five might pass Potter's lips, but Draco retorts back in his usual manner.
Scared of who?
"You want me to believe that you didn't put the training you've received over the summer to good use?" Draco's stomach twisted with how casually Severus could mention his time at the manor.
Crabbe had finally learned how their world works.
"It sucks a bit, yeah," Draco agreed before getting to the subject he was sure Crabbe was checking in on, "I checked in on your father."
"I don't know," Draco sighed.
Draco looked, really looked, at Potter for the first time in months. He hadn’t allowed himself to take in the site of his friend earlier when they had accidentally met a week ago at Borgin and Burkes. He couldn’t risk the danger that would be the consequence of a simple glance. Anything that could give Draco’s feelings for Potter away could have him dead.
"I'm your friend," Draco croaked, leaving the room. Potter didn't follow him.
"Pleasure."
"Ah," Theo played a long, "well, nothing passes your unwavering wit."
Pansy walked beside him, allowing him to be silent without question. The two exited the classroom and into the crowed hallway. Students milled around him. They all seemed so young. How many of them didn't know of the dangers that lurked in the shadows? How many of his peers were going to be forced to carry the weight of an early marriage? His marriage was just the beginning; the tip of the iceberg. There was a cliff, he was expected to jump, eyes close.
The cat walked away from Montague, who ran as if being chased. The feline walked by Draco on shaking legs. Draco busted into laughter. He left his spot behind the Armor, the cat seemed dizzy by his sudden appearance. Draco crouched down, letting the ginger cat sniff his hand before scratching behind the ears. The feline's face was deep into their skull, the cat was large, with a large, bottleneck tail and yellow eyes.
There was a bang. The door shook form the hinges.
Theo couldn't defend himself with his mouth full of toast.
The two fumed, one of them, Fred, George, Henry, he couldn't tell, turned and with a quick motion with his wand, the boxes packed themselves into two suitcases. The twins grabbed one each before making their way down the tower's steps. Their shoulders both pushing harshly against Draco, whose pride made him just take the hits instead of moving out of their way like a normal person.
"An investigation would be made much simpler if you told the truth," Severus added.
"I love how much your tight little family fucking gossips," Draco snaps.
"What the fuck are glitter pens?" Draco asked, mostly to himself.
"We all have our uses for our Lord," Draco droned, not feeling the words, but not needing to pretend so hard for show. He had spilt blood for their Lord, a thing no one else their age has done. He had earned his title of Death Eater before the mark was burned into his arm.
The girl's lips lifted into a smile, and she gave a small nod. Gathering himself, Draco rose and mentioned that she was welcome to follow, she rose and the two unlikely pair made their way to the Great Hall.
"Good morning, Professor. Is that a new perfume?" Draco asked with all of his charm, walking across the small office.
There were so many lights. Spells flew across the hall. Yells echoed in the chamber.
"Hope you get stuck!" Theo yelled behind him.
Draco pointed out, "If you were good at breaking rules, you wouldn't get caught so often."
"Yes, hello Professor," he entered the room, feeling uneasy. McGonagall always made him nervous, he wasn't sure why either.
"That's where you made your mistake," Daphne chided as the three walked through the crowded halls on their way to their next class.
"I'm not quite sure about that. They have to worry about their mother's side of the family after all," Draco corrected with a grin, trying to lighten the mood. He earned himself a solid punch on the arm for that.
"Nothing's going on, I just don't want to talk to you," Theo supplied. Even though his words were harsh, Theo's face told a different story.
They sat on Draco's large bed about a foot apart. Draco folded his hands in his lap, feeling out of touch within his own body.
"What's this?" Potter asked, opening the bag.
"I think they're majestic," Draco commented.
His father screams were louder than anything else in the room. Lucius hit the grown, cradling his broken knee that Draco had kicked out from underneath him.
Potter broke into a run when he heard Draco behind him. "Potter! You have got to be joking."
It probably wouldn't survive in the wild. Perhaps the creature would, as anything would look at that face and instantly have a heart attack. Draco almost did. He supposed the creature could be a cat, or a second cousin, Draco couldn't tell.
----------------
This time, his mother didn't hesitate to reach right into his mind for his most recent memory. She pulled the memory from his mind with frightening accuracy.
"And green brings out my eyes," Potter joked.
Potter burst into laughter, "What does that have to say for Slytherins?"
Pansy looked down at him, "I'll think about it," she swore. Draco grinned, pleasantly warm.
Potter was staring at him, the faces behind him bled into a blur, but Potter's look of shock and horror would remain seared into his memory. Draco bit the inside of his cheek, his face hot in shame. He swallowed, making himself face Potter, not allowing himself to look down. "Someone take him to Madam Pomphrey," his voice traveled easily through the crowd. Potter opened his mouth, but Draco just shook his head slightly before walking past him.
This could be Draco's rebellion, a way to forgive him for his sins, this righteous action. This small action, he could do, he could stand with Potter, if only for a brief moment.
Pansy placed her head in her hands, nodding. She was deathly still. Draco rubbed his chin. Mrs. Parkinson certainly worked fast. She must have caught gossip of Draco and Daphne's impending engagement and clawed at the opportuning to rise in society. She would have Pansy marry into a family, or be betrothed, for protection.
"What? Would you rather teach him? He hates you, and I'm not going to let whatever personal vendetta you have against his father risk his teaching or safety," Draco snapped. Severus gasped at his bluntness, at how quickly Draco was willing to fight dirty.
"Oh, um, did I break it?" Daphne blinked.
Potter opened his mouth. Closed it. Opened. Weasley was about to piss himself he was laughing so hard. Severus rolled his eyes to the ceiling. "Huh… that's nice," Potter's shaky voice answered her.
His muggle trainers were silent on the floor as he walked through the too long hallway. He was walking directly into a trap set by his father, he should be more careful. Here, standing in the middle of the hall, he was too open. Too vulnerable.
"Still, that's two more friends than you have," Draco teased. Daphne gasped in mocked shock. Draco grinned. More students were entering for breakfast as the morning continued. The three were approached by Crabbe and Goyle, who both joined them for breakfast. The Carrow twins also joined their group, but didn't participate in gossiping with Pansy and Daphne, instead they conversed with Crabbe and Goyle.
One moment Draco was in the hall of the ground floor of Hogwarts, then he was outside in late evening. Soft grass replaced the worn brick floor of Hogwarts. The air was fresh and crisp with the warm smell of grass. Vines covered the walls, tree branches extending from the higher areas of the walls. The ceiling clearly showing the night sky, full of bright stars.
"I…" he checked the watch on the wall, surprised. "I didn’t think you would be here this early."
“And why would I care if you think something is of any importance?” Draco calmly interrupted, stopping the pair. “Do excuse me, Potter, I have somewhere to be. Which, when you think about it, anywhere is better than here. Enjoyed our little chat,” Draco turned and walked confidently away has the rest of the students still in the halls weaved around him.
Potter's eyes opened, staring into Draco's.
"Well, me. Of course," Draco managed to say with a straight face. Potter and Draco locked eyes, before the pair started laughing. Potter gripped his stomach in his laughter, his laugh joyful and warm, cozy. Draco allowed his laughter to leave him, feeling lighter than he has all week. Potter was still laughing, Draco's chest felt as if there was a bird within his ribcage. "Perhaps I'm not the best example," he joked, causing Potter to chuckle in agreement.
Silence.
Potter didn't seemed to be comforted, "But why? Why would they turn against their own teammate?"
Draco's stomach twisted, his anger ranging in his chest nastily. His chin quivered, he tried to calm himself down. He hid his head into his knees, trying to stop his sobs.
He sees a small girl, bloody, begging, screaming, incoherent, reaching for her mother's feet, hanging by an invisible rope-
"Weren't you paying attention? Only those who've seen death can see Thestrals," Potter lectured.
“Ah, sorry about that. I would try to patch you up, but my healing magic is all sorts of whack,” Sirius turned back into his human form. Draco wondered if he always turned into a dog when he was surprised.
The wardrobe shrunk to six inches tall.
He had nowhere to go as white hot pain clawed at his back as fire met him in the air.
"What is it then?" his Lord asked with a voice that could easily belong to a kind person.
He opened his mouth to take another bite when one of his teeth fell out. The tooth dropped onto his lap without any fuss when he had gone for a bite.
The manor was smaller than the Malfoy's, white brick with large windows. A forest edged along the sides and back of the estate. The perfectly monitored lawn seemed to be struggling for control against the lush trees that crested the ends of the grass. Draco could see a happy family living here, raising their two, strong willed daughters here. They would have plenty of room to grow, to run and play in the large yard. He could perfectly picture Daphne leaning out of the window to have a cigarette.
Potter shook his head, "I don’t think Snape would like that."
Potter didn't move to look at him, but his hand didn't stop the gentle touch on Draco's dark mark. "I'm right here, I was just thinking."
She wasn't here anymore.
Crabbe took the one page letter. Draco waited for a look of disappointment to appear on Crabbe's face, but he just smiled to himself and folded the letter up with much care. He stood up, awkwardly standing at the edge of the table. "Um…thanks," Crabbe said, "I owe you one." He promised to Draco before leaving.
Draco's mind was ripped to shreds by the pain, but he focused on the pain. He let the pain consume his mind, his walls were only strengthen by the focus point.
"It's necessary," Draco stated, irritation lacing his voice.
"Eat," his Lord ordered. He continued his meal.
"I think you know the reasoning, Professor," Draco challenged.
S.P.T to A.P.W.B.D
With a loud, shrieking laugh his aunt shoved him away. He stepped back from the force, his back hitting the wall.
"Two. Snape is the new Dark Arts professor," Potter put up a second finger.
The manor was no longer his home. The warmth had been bleed out.
As he stood, he understood some of what Potter was going through.
"I'm sorry," the words slipped past his lips before he thought about them, about their meaning. He said them quietly, for only her ears despite the crowed room. She looked down,  taking a shaking breath, her warm hand moved to Draco's cheek.
He turned. He looked down at the small girl with dark skin and brown hair. "Alfie," he greeted. "I think it should start soon." She nodded. She was wearing a black dress, her hair was in a braid down her back. "How's Astoria? I've seen you two together before," Draco couldn't ask her himself. He wasn't cruel.
Draco. Potter had used his first name.
Two hands rested on his shoulders as he was pulled to his feet. Severus tightened his grip on Draco as Madam Pomphrey started to cast her magic on Pansy. Severus led Draco out of the empty classroom. Where had everyone gone? How long had he been sitting there, staring at a drowning girl?
Draco turned away from the mirror.
"Yet, your father still tries to find young girls with tight asses to fuck. How does it feel to be in second place to your dad's cock? Your father would rather pay a girl to keep her mouth full of his cum than buy you new robes for school." Draco stepped into Montague's space, Montague wouldn't look up at him, his head lowered in embarrassment. Draco could whisper into his ear, he was so close. "Try to humiliate me again, and I'll point out to everyone that you father is also looking for a new assistant, preferably male." Montague nodded, tears on his face.
"Is that how you're going to treat your amazing best friend?" Potter teased.
“No!” Potter gripped Draco's arm to roughly pull him closer. “Why haven’t you told Umbridge yet? You’ve known for weeks now!”
Maybe he was being a fucking drama queen. That's what Daphne would say. Draco thought that’s what she would say.
How long would this last?
Comments are seen and thanked!!
The meal changed in front of his eyes. Bowls filled with deep creamy stews that Dobby use to make appeared. Sandwiches that Dobby would make in secret for them to share after a long day of Draco playing outside filled a plate. Candies that his mother used to give him from the sweet jar in her personal study. The scones that his father would buy for him on his way home from work on Fridays stacked on a plate.
