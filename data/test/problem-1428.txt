“I’ll go back to classes tomorrow,” Harry says. “And I’ll write mum and dad today, I promise. But now, I want to be alone.”
Malfoy is in four of Harry’s classes. They share History of Magic, Potions and DADA, just like last year. And Malfoy is also in Divination, one of the two new classes that Harry follows this year. Harry sits in the back of the class, paying no attention to the teachers. His eyes are focused on Malfoy. He observes how Malfoy keeps his head down. During History of Magic Draco reads through most of the lesson. When other students doze off (or take massive notes as Hermione loves to do), Draco has his book open and scans over the pages. In Potions Draco makes the potion just as everyone else. And he is good at it. He always has been. Professor Snape likes Malfoy. His behaviour towards Malfoy is the complete opposite of his behaviour towards Harry. But Harry is used to hearing how he’s the same as his father and how his popularity will one day abandon him and he will be hopeless and lost.
“So, he is?” Hermione asks. “He is a.” She looks around them. There are too many people here to say it out loud. “You know what I mean,” she finishes.
“Maybe you can watch some with grandma Andromeda,” Harry says. “You’ll be going home with her after Christmas dinner.”
The next day Ron complained that Fitch had made him buff up the Quidditch Cup fourteen times. And then he had another slug attack all over a special Award for Services to the School. It took ages to take the slime off.
Ron started spitting out slugs by the way and Hermione and I took him to Hagrid’s hut. Draco started laughing when he saw what was happening to Ron and I just gave him a dirty look. Why was he acting like this?
We also visited Hagrid last week. He’s going to London this Friday for Buckbeak’s case against the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. Draco brought some papers for Hagrid, the research he’d done while helping me with my homework. He’s always done faster than me with our homework. I wish I could have helped him, but with all the extra Quidditch practice Marcus is making us do, and my extra homework for Miss Davis, I just don’t have the time. I don’t get why I still have to go to her. I never feel like I did like back then. Draco says it’s good for me to go to her, just like it helps me to write to both of you. And maybe he’s right, I just wish I had a little more time to just spend with Draco without doing homework or Quidditch practice.
Professor Lupin made some light that illuminated his tired, grey face. He told us to stay where we were and moved towards the door. Only the door slid open before Lupin could reach it. In the doorway stood a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling. Its face was completely hidden beneath its hood. It drew a long, slow, rattling breath and I got very cold. I noticed Draco was also shivering in my arms. The cold crept deep inside me, into my heart. And then my eyes rolled up into my head, while I was drowning in cold. I felt like I was dragged downward until the screaming started. It were terrible, terrified, pleading screams. I wanted to help whoever it was and tried to move, but I couldn’t. It was like I was trapped inside a thick white fog that moved inside of me as well.
“Both of you are doing nothing,” James says. Neville and Harry both sit up quickly and see James standing in the doorway. His hand trembles on the doorknob and his face is pale. “No matter how much you two want to take revenge, you are not allowed to go looking for Wormtail.”
“And leave me alone with Hermione and Ron?” Neville asks. “Think about your brother, please. Don’t make me suffer at school alone.” He stops and pulls on Harry’s arm to get him to look at him.
I don’t want you to worry, but the last couple of days have been hard. For a couple of hours, I thought of ending my life again. I didn’t and I’m fine now. It was all about this second task. As I told you in my last letter, Draco and I had figured out the clue of the egg with a little help of Myrtle. So Draco, Hermione and I spend hours and hours in the library to research. I even asked professor Snape for a permission slip to search the books of the restricted section. But it was all for nothing. We hadn’t found any spell or charm that would enable me to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale.
“You want to tell me about him?” Narcissa asks. Her hand rests on Draco’s side. It’s comforts Draco, and frightens him at the same time. Everything is just so messed up. And Draco has no idea how to fix it.
“We’ll tell Uncle Remus,” Harry says. He’s still got Neville’s arm in his hand. “We’ll hand him the map so they can keep an eye on Pettigrew while the proper people get here to arrest him,” Harry says.
“What kind of potions?” Draco asks. He locks eyes with healer Burke, and he sees the answer in her eyes. “Ones I shouldn’t be taking, addictive once.”
In the end, Draco wasn’t capable of killing another person. He froze when he had Dumbledore at wand point. And he hesitated when the Dark Lord ordered him to kill an insubordinate Death Eater. As punishment, he had to give his father’s potion to his mother. He was chained to the wall as he watched her wither away in pain. Her body slowly dissolving into nothing more than bones. It hadn’t been as exciting as when Draco had been a child. This was not some insignificant Muggle, this was his mother, a pure-blood witch.
Harry doesn’t respond. He’s busy reading the friendly words of his uncle. Harry hadn’t told him about Malfoy, but of course, Remus has told Sirius. And now Sirius is offering his help. Sirius says he has his doubts, the boy is a Malfoy of course. But he knows Harry and what he’s like when he’s set his mind to something. He gives tips for some helpful books to get from the library to help with the      communication problems. And if the library doesn’t have the books, Harry should let him know and he will send them along with Remus as Sirius owns them all.
Draco was proud of me for not bringing it up. We talked a little about it, how it would be like if one of your friends would betray you like that. What if Hermione or Blaise would do that to us? I would be so hurt. So I think I won’t bother Professor Lupin with it, it’s obvious he’s still hurting because of it.
It started off good, saying Hagrid bears no responsibility for the hippogriff attack on a student. But that was the only good thing about the letter. The Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures will have a hearing about it because of the complained of Mr Lucius Malfoy (explaining why Draco got so angry) and that the Hippogriff needs to be kept tethered and isolated till the date of the hearing.
Draco made it his mission to become just as skilled at potions as his father, hoping to one day join him in his efforts to finding the perfect potion to end a Muggles life. One that would inflict pain and suffering on the useless beings. If only he could get into the restricted section in the library. Draco was sure he would be able to learn tons about poisonous potions from those books.
“That is a good boy,” Pettigrew says. “You’re clever. Not like your dad at all. He would have charged by now.”
Professor Lupin took me apart for our next DADA lesson and told me that if I ever wanted to talk to him about you I was always welcome to come by for a cup of tea. I told him I would, but I haven’t gone to see him yet. I’m a little scared of what he will tell me. What if you are different than I imagined? What if you hated gay people? What if he would tell me you would never approve of Draco and me being a couple. I don’t want to hear that. I rather have my fantasy about who you are than finding out you were horrible people. Draco says it will be okay, that I was a kind soul and that at least one of my parents must have given it to me. Maybe he’s right, but I’m still scared. Even though I get more curious every day about how you were really like.
The best part of having my Gryffindor friends at my party was that nobody said anything about it. They were welcomed with open arms and that made me proud for being a Slytherin.
“I’m your teacher here, Harry,” Remus says. “You can’t just walk into my office without permission.”
But then professor Lupin started to tell his story, about how he became a werewolf and how Dumbledore had made sure that Lupin could go to school. And how the Whomping Willow and the Shrieking Shack were built so he could safely transform without hurting anyone. But he was happy because he had friends. Sirius, Peter and you, dad. He told us about how you all found out that he was a werewolf and that you learnt to become Animagus so you could help him when he transformed. That it made him less dangerous.
Mr Malfoy didn’t get the change to respond to Draco because a stooping man had appeared behind the counter and he focused his attention on him. I couldn’t look away from Draco, wondering why he acted so different from what I’m used to. I know he was worried about not coming first in our class, but surely his father would not buy him a new broom if he was still upset about that, would he?
“Too late,” Pettigrew says. He points Draco’s wand at his head and then starts to turn. He shrinks and Draco’s binding spell misses him. In seconds a small rat sits on the library floor. Harry lunges for the animal. But it’s small and fast. The rat runs away, out of sight.
The door opens and the Dark Lord steps into the room. His red eyes glitter as he looks at Draco and Narcissa. How much of their conversation has he heard?
Draco leans in. His hand hovers above the map. Harry thinks it’s cute how excited Draco gets. It’s similar to Ron and Hermione’s reactions when they first saw the map, but somehow better. Everything with Draco is always better. Neville points at the Ravenclaw common room, where Iris hangs out with some of her friends. Luna isn’t there, so that means that Ginny won’t be either.
Draco wants it to be done. He’d hope that once the Dark Lord would find out the truth, his life would be over quickly. Instead, Draco gets to experience a worse form of torture than the pain caused by the Cruciatus curse. He has to wait and see what happens. And fear that his mother will suffer for his choices. The torture of Narcissa fills his nightmares. It’s a nice mix between watching his mother spasms of pain on his bedroom floor and watching Harry fall into nothing. Draco hates the way he had to wipe the drool off his mothers face when the Dark Lord had enough fun and left them alone. He’d hold her shaking body until she could stand up again.
“Of course. It’s custom to send little reminders of important moments that link each other together when showing interest in a suitable partner,” Luna explains.
Later they examine the wands of Parkinson, Nott and Goyle. The last spells they fired are all dark and unforgivable. The pain they put Draco through was even worse than Harry had imagined. If only he had found them sooner. Not that they would have survived it. But at least Draco wouldn’t have had to suffer as he did. Tears fall now. Harry can’t stop them. He closes his eyes and tries to think of the good times. Of the day they bought fake Muggle IDs so they could get married. The moment they apparated back to their home after the I do’s. The perfect eggs Draco used to make for breakfast. The walks through the forest around their home. The days spend in the garden, growing herbs and vegetables. The nights spent in front of the fire, Draco reading a book out loud so Harry could listen to his voice. A voice he will never hear again.
The Dark Lord’s steps are calculated. He moves slowly towards the bed. Narcissa sits up straight and tries to block the Dark Lord’s view of Draco. Draco puts his hand on Narcissa’s back. “It’s fine, mum,” he says. He knew this moment had to come someday. Maybe it’s better that it comes this soon. At least now Draco doesn’t have to pretend anymore. The prospect of reuniting with his lover gives him the courage he never thought he had.
Harry stokes some hair out of Draco’s face. Draco looks at him and isn’t surprised to see a hint of worry in Harry’s eyes.
"I can't do it like this, Draco," Harry says. He places a kiss on Draco's shoulder. "Not when you shut yourself off and just let it happen to you. Fuck, it feels like I'm raping you."
Neville nods his head. He knows. Harry blinks away a tear. Neville is willing to die if it means saving Draco. The fool is just as selfless as his parents were. He will protect the ones he loves above all. And because Draco is the person Harry loves, he’s become a part of the small circle for who Neville will give his life.
Oh, and something is up with Draco. He seems very disturbed about what happened to Mrs Norris. And that’s just weird because Draco hates cats. He has kept to himself all day, hiding away in his bed, writing in this little notebook he has. He even told Nott to get the hell away from him. I wish I knew what was going on with him. I hate seeing him like this. He looks paler than usual and he didn’t even bother to style his hair today. I think something is bothering him. But I’ll probably never learn what it is since mister “I pretend you don’t exist Harry” won’t speak to me.
“Just as Ron and Hermione?” Neville jokes. “Sure, Harry. I might have a scar above my eye, I’m still not blind.”
Harry shrugs and sits down on one of the bar stools. Lily puts down the leftovers she was packing away and sits down next to Harry.
Hermione, Ron, Neville, Blaise, Draco and I all shared a compartment in the Hogwarts Express. We talked and laughed and eat so much candy. It was a lot of fun. Draco said he would ask his parents if we could have a birthday party for me at his house this summer and promised to owl all of us as soon as he had tricked them into saying yes. Blaise was off to Spain for the summer with his mother; Ron would stay home and enjoy the countryside with his brothers; Neville was going home to his gran and Hermione said she was going to help her parents in their dentist practice. She had to explain to the others what a dentist is. I was glad the conversation turned to muggle health care after that, so I didn’t have to tell them that I was going to spend my summer feeling miserable at my aunt and uncle’s place.
“Ah, here it is,” Pansy says. “Harry Potter was rushed to St. Mungo’s two weeks ago after a severe Quidditch accident involving him and young Draco Malfoy, son and heir of Lucius Malfoy. A battle for the Snitch turned into a deadly affair when Harry Potter lost his grip and fell off his broom from a great height. Two days ago he succumbed to his injuries and passed away.”
It’s a map of Hogwarts. It has all the details of the castle and its grounds. When you make it appear by saying ‘I solemnly swear that I am up to no good’ it tells you that the map is made by Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs. They’ve called it the Marauder’s Map. And it’s more than just a map. It shows you where everyone is walking too. There a tiny ink dots moving around it, each labelled with a name in minuscule writing.
“Yes, I do,” Iris says. “They called mum and dad. For a moment we all thought you were dead. I don’t want you to be dead.”
The notebook. Draco’s notebook. I looked at where Riddle was nodding towards and I could see the little diary Draco had been writing in all year. About his fears and heartbreak. He had told me. And now Riddle was telling me that he had charmed Draco into trusting him, that it had been boring to listen to the silly little troubles of a twelve-year-old boy. But he had written back, had been sympathetic and kind, making Draco pour his soul into the diary, so Riddle could grow stronger. So strong that he became more powerful than Draco, and started pouring his soul into him. Riddle had made Draco open up the chamber of Secrets, had him strangle the roosters and had him write threatening messages on the walls.
Riddle answered that question for me. He said it was an interesting question and quite a long story. He said that the real reason Draco was like this is because he opened his heart and spilt all his secrets to an invisible stranger.
“What is he on about?” Ron asks. “Why does he think you have to rescue Malfoy? Like he will be the one thing you will miss the most?”
“Harry, please,” Hermione begs. “Don’t go and do something foolish. Just promise me you won’t. I’ll look up spells and jinxes that can help us if we encounter him. But don’t go looking for him. Please?” Tears are building up in Hermione’s eyes and Harry nods his head. He’s got a weak spot for Hermione. He hates seeing her upset. He will promise this. Not that he will keep the promise. He just won’t mention it again when Hermione is nearby. Or around Neville. And that means he also can’t tell Ron. He’s too close to Hermione these days. Ron will tell her. Harry will do this alone. He will find Pettigrew and stop him, without anyone knowing. Even if it is the last thing he does.
Harry steps closer to him and kisses him. “You are a champion for having her,” he tells Draco. And he means it. No matter how difficult these last couple of months have been, they both know little Gwyneth will be worth it.
“Harry, he’s not happy about all the extra attention,” Remus says. “Professor Snape told me that his father, Mr Malfoy, has complained about it too,” Remus says.
“Thank you, Dad,” Harry says again. “I love it.” And he means it. He loves that his parents are willing to do this for him and his dream to one day play at that level. He hugs his dad who ruffles Harry’s hair.
This made me wonder, would Professor Snape still be one of his followers? So I asked him about it the next morning when Draco and I went to collect my egg. Professor Snape looked sad when he told us he wasn’t the smartest boy when he was younger, and that he’d made mistakes in his life he would never forgive himself for, but that I needed to worry, that he would do everything in his power to keep me safe. That didn’t stop him from still giving us detention. We had to clean cauldrons for hours on our Saturday off. Even after I told Professor Snape that we were out of bed because we needed to be to figure out the clue of the egg. Professor Snape shook his head and told us we could have worked it out during the day and that we still deserved punishment for being out of bed.
It turns out she saw the grim in my cup. Draco with completely white at the word, Nott laughed and Crabbe yelled it was about time I would die for real. I first didn’t understand, until the professor explained that the grim is the omen of death. It’s shaped like a large black dog. I’ve seen it before when I ran away from home and on a book in Flourish and Blotts. And now it showed up again. Hermione said she thought it didn’t look like the Grim at all, trying to calm me down. And Greg tried to help with saying it only looks like the grim when you squeeze your eyes almost entirely shut, that it looks more like a monkey. But all that didn’t really help, Draco was looking at me like he was going to lose me, for real this time.
“Draco, I don’t care that you are a homosexual. There have been others like you. It’s nothing to be ashamed of. But that doesn’t mean you can’t marry and produce an heir. I’m sure we can find you a wife who won’t mind that you have lovers on the side,” Narcissa says.
“I know, and I don’t care. It’s a new year, and I’ve got myself a job at Gringotts as a curse breaker.”
Professor McGonagall than raised her voice at Hermione, asking she would lead me to the Gryffindor common room. But Headmaster Dumbledore simply answered that I had known the location since Christmas break last year, when he had given the Weasleys permission to take me there, so I wouldn’t have to spend all my time alone in the Slytherin common room. I couldn’t believe my ears, the headmaster was telling a lie to help us out. Isn’t that amazing.
After all the other wizards and witches had left the bus we came to a stop on a small country road. Stan said we were at Malfoy Manor. When I got out I could see a large hedge stretching in both directions. In front of us was a gravel driveway, and the large hedge curved with it and continued alongside the driveway. I took my trunk and started my way up this driveway until I reached a large iron gate. The gate contorted into a face and asked me if I knew what time it was. I told it, that I was sorry for bothering him that late, but that I really needed to speak to Draco Malfoy. The gate informed me that the young master Draco had already gone to bed and that I would have to come back after sunrise. I tried to convince the gate that I had nowhere to go, but it wouldn’t let me pass. After a while, the face disappeared and I was stranded in front of the gate. I set down on my trunk and tried to think of a way to let Draco know that I was at his house. No good ideas came to mind and after a while, I felt stupid for even thinking I could just rock up at Malfoy Manor and that everything would be okay. Draco’s father hates me after all and me showing up, as a criminal, won’t help matters much for Draco.
Harry shakes his head. Something is wrong here. He’s seen this before, a long time ago, when he was still little. Uncle Sirius standing in front of Uncle Remus, slamming into him because he didn’t know how else to communicate his frustration. Back when Uncle Sirius was still struggling with the fact he would never hear again.
For my glasses, Miles knew a nice trick. He used Impervius on them so they would repel water. And then we were off again. It was still cold and wet, but at least I could see more. Lighting started to strike around us, and I was desperate to find the Snitch and be able to go back to the castle and crawl into a warm bed together with Draco. And then I saw it, the Grim. It was sitting at the topmost row of the stands. It freaked me out a little and I almost slipped off my broom. When I looked back up the dog was gone and I had to race towards the snitch, that was hovering in the space between me and Diggory.  I zoomed towards the snitch and then the entire stadium went silent. I was like I was suddenly deaf. And then a cold swept over me, inside me. When I looked down there were at least a hundred Dementors beneath me. And then I heard the screaming again. It was a woman, pleading: ‘Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry! Take me, kill me instead.’
Harry holds Draco’s hand at this moment. The sun is out and it’s a beautiful day. It’s their last Hogsmeade trip of the year. Harry and Draco are spending it with just the two of them. It’s their first official date. So they walk together towards the village. They won’t go into the main part of town. Uncle Remus has told Harry about this sweet little park close to his uncles’ home. It will be the perfect spot for a picnic.
Madam Pomfrey says that she will be in her office if they need her and then walks away. When she’s gone, James places another kiss on top of Harry’s head and then lets go of him.
Harry’s hand cups Draco’s face. His finger strokes over the skin like it’s made of porcelain. “Then there are other options we can look into. Dean said they might adopt in the future, and Hermione showed me some leaflets about surrogates.”
Teddy bites his lip and looks at his empty parchment “Do you think I can draw grandma’s house in ten minutes?” he asks.
Draco doesn’t respond. Harry wishes he would react, wishes he would do something other than lay in bed and do nothing. Hermione was right. She’s always right. Harry hates her for it right now. She said that if Harry would keep ignoring it that he would break himself. And he knows he’s close. Maybe he should listen to her and stay with them for a while, take the pressure off and hope that it will spur Draco into action.
Neville points his wand at the map and mutters: “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” Lines and figures start to appear on the parchment. Harry still doesn’t know how his dad, Sirius and Remus made the map. They won’t tell the secret. But he loves that James gave it to him when he first went to Hogwarts.
“And I care about getting the man that is responsible for my parents’ deaths back in jail,” Neville spits at her.
“Yes, and the first thing I did was make you believe you’ve been sleeping with me for the last two years, so I could have sex whenever I want to,” Dean jokes.
“No, finish it,” Hermione says. “Why would I shorten it? I need to have all the information in here.”
But that’s not the only thing we found out when we were at Hagrid. He’s hiding a dragon egg in his hut. That’s why all the curtains were closed and he had a steaming hot fire going. He had won it in a game of cards with a stranger. He has gotten a book out of the library about dragon breeding, so he knows what to do and what kind of dragon egg he has. It’s a Norwegian Ridgeback.  I’m worried about Hagrid and his egg. What would happen to him when anyone would find out that he is hiding an illegal dragon in his hut?
Just like Harry was a great Quidditch player. New tears make their way down Draco’s cheeks. He doesn’t want to open his eyes. He doesn’t want to remember that it are only memories he’s got left. Why did he want to win that match so badly? What good did it bring him to go after the snitch like that? The day had been perfect until then. The banter in Myrtle’s bathroom. The first kiss they shared. The promises they made, to fight this war together. The flirtations on the field before the storm had fallen on them. The race to get to the snitch first. It had all been great. Until it hadn’t.
And then the Dark Lord returned. More rooms of the Manor became off-limits. Draco sneaked around to watch how his aunt and uncle tortured Muggles and blood traitors. He watched through keyholes to see the Dark Lord praise his father for his inventions.
I think all of this cheered Hagrid up a little. The headmaster told Hagrid he expected him back at work on Monday and that he would join him for breakfast that day. And then he left. Hagrid then told us about his dad. Even showed us a picture. It turns out his dad died when he was in his second year. But the Headmaster had helped him, made sure he got the job of gamekeeper. He said his father had told him to never be ashamed. So from now on, he will try to keep that in mind and that he’d been an idiot for hiding out in his cabin all this time.
“I don’t want to get promoted. I want to get out,” Draco answers. He tries not to sound irritated. It’s not Harry’s fault that this mad man has the capability to ruin everything good in Draco’s life.
And then, after dinner was done, headmaster Dumbledore opened the TriWizard tournament. He explained the procedure and introduced Mr Crouch and Mr Bagman to us. They were the representatives from the Ministry that will be on the panel of judges. And then they brought in a casket which turned into a large, roughly hewn wooden cup when he tapped it three times with his wand. It was kind of unremarkable except for the fact that it was filled with dancing blue-white flames. Everyone who wants to be a Champion has to write down their name and school on a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet. They’ve got till the night of the Halloween feast to do so because then the goblet will somehow choice the Champions.
If it hadn’t been for Myrtle showing up and showing me the way, I think I would have stayed on that spot and died there as soon as the Gillyweed stopped working. She led me almost all the way into the Mer-people’s village but had to turn around just before because she and the Merpeople don’t like each other. I continued by myself until I found Draco. He was tied to a statue of a Merman, and I sped towards him. I took his lulling face in my hands and just wished for a sign he was still alive. I hugged him and told him I was sorry, only no sound came from my mouth, just bubbles. I cried into Draco’s shoulder. I had found him, but he was still gone, the whole inside me was still there.
When we came to Hagrid’s hut, he also looks suspicious of Draco being there but didn’t say anything. The egg was already full of deep cracks and a funny clicking noise was coming from it. We watched closely and with a scraping noise, the egg split open. A baby dragon looks ugly, like a crumpled, black umbrella. And it had huge wings compared to its skinny body. Its eyes are orange and it had stubs of horns and a long snout with wide nostrils. Hagrid thought it was beautiful, Draco said it looks disgusting and wanted to leave. He froze on his way to the door, saying someone had looked through the window. I jumped to my feet and threw the door open and saw Nott running away in the distance.
I hate what happened next. Voldemort spoke to the person next to Wormtail. He called him Lucius and I knew it was Draco’s father that was standing there. At the moment it was clear that Draco just lost his home. Voldemort wasn’t happy with Draco’s father. Said it was a disgrace how he couldn’t even control his son and teach him the ways of a true wizard. And Draco’s father said he was sorry, and that he won’t disappoint the Dark Lord again, that he would teach his son to obey. I have no idea how I’m going to tell this to Draco. I won’t let him go home this summer, I’m sure I will never see him again if I do. Draco will never betray me, and I’m afraid his father will kill him for that.
“What do you mean of course?” Ron asks. “Don’t you think you already have enough on your plate with all the subjects you’re taking this year?”
Harry and Draco laugh and then get up to follow Teddy down the stairs. Harry hands Draco his coffee, and they sit around the tree together. Teddy is excited about each present he opens, declaring them all ‘the best present ever’. It brings a smile back to Draco’s face. Until he remembers all this won’t last. Harry will leave him soon, taking Teddy with him and leaving Draco all alone with his pain.
‘What do you mean by that?’ Harry asks. He’s not sure he wants to know the answer. Harry has heard stories from Uncle Sirius. About others who think he is now a lesser wizard and person. Is that what Malfoy has grown up with? The idea that he’s not good enough the way he is?
Draco’s hands are soft. Harry knows this now. Because he holds them regularly. Other students stare. Neville jokes about it, says it’s nice that for once he isn’t the centre of attention. Harry doesn’t mind that much. The truth is, he doesn’t care what others think. Not now that Draco is his official boyfriend.
Draco blushes and it’s the cutest thing Harry has ever seen. “I didn’t want you to die,” Draco signs.
After some time we heard footsteps behind us, but nobody was there. Draco called out a hello, but there was no answer. And then someone shouted a spell that made Draco shiver next to me. A vast, green light erupted from between the trees and flew up into the sky. It formed a colossal skull with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue. In seconds the woods around us erupted with screams and Draco was squeezing so hard onto my hand it hurt. I whispered to him to ask what it was and he told me it was the Dark Mark, the sign of the Dark Lord. We stood there frozen searching the woods around us for the person who had conjured the mark until wizard appeared around us. We only just ducked in time before they all started shooting off stupefy’s. And then Tonks screamed at them to all stop, that it was Harry Potter they were aiming at.
Draco says that there isn’t anything we can do. That only time might heal a wound like that. I know he doesn’t believe that just as I don’t. Sirius has loved Remus for over twenty years. There is no way he will just get over it. But we’ll try to show him that he still got a family and friends that do love him. It’s all we can think of doing, so that’s the plan for now. I just hope he feels better by the time I have to go back to school. I hate leaving him alone in this house when he’s depressed like this.
The next day I went to sit with him and Zabini for breakfast and tried to talk to him again about him staying awake to make sure I’m fine. Zabini agreed with me that Malfoy did need some sleep and he helped me convince him to stop trying to stay awake all the time. From then on I kept eating breakfast with them at the Slytherin table. I still have lunch and dinner with Hermione and her fellow Gryffindor’s, but it’s also nice to spend more time at my own house table. I think Zabini, Malfoy and I are becoming friends. It’s making things a little more complicated because Ron and Neville can’t seem to forgive Malfoy for all the teasing he did before, but he has changed and hasn’t said a bad word about or to me in the last two months. I didn’t tell Ron and Neville about him staying awake to keep me safe and how he saved my notebook and cloak (that they don’t even know about) from Nott. Ron and Neville not knowing that might make it harder for them to see that Malfoy is trying to be my friend, but I’m not willing to tell them. Only Hermione knows that Malfoy sacrificed his sleep to keep me safe and protected my notebook while I was in the hospital wing, and she still thinks Malfoy must have read my letters to you, but he said he didn’t and I’ll believe him until there is prove otherwise.
“I’m sorry,” Draco says. He looks back at Andromeda. She looks so composed, sitting upright, her legs close together and slightly bending to the side. Draco remembers his mother sitting just like that. The drilled in manners are the only evidence that Andromeda was ever part of the royal house of Black. Draco used to be like that, well mannered and always aware of his posture. Harry had taught him to relax, to ease up when at home or around friends. And Draco doesn’t think he can keep up the front any longer in front of strangers. Not now that his heart is bleeding.
“Dances should be forbidden,” Harry says when the music slows down and Parkinson moves closer to Malfoy to lay her chin on his shoulder. If Harry had someone to dance with, he would do so, just so he could get close enough to trip that freaking bitch. All cuddled up with Malfoy, as she belongs there. And Malfoy doesn’t even seem to mind.
But it kinda is. If this goes wrong, Harry will lose a friend and have his heart broken in one minute. And there is a big change this will go wrong. Harry isn’t even sure if Malfoy even is gay, or bi like Harry. He never talks about his love life. Harry is quite sure Malfoy never goes on dates. He would have mentioned them if he had, wouldn’t he? Harry has told him about dates he’s been on.
“Oh, Harry, I don’t know. I think he needs help, as in professional help. I don’t think you, or any of us can help him now,” Hermione says.
On Monday, Harry hurries to the library as soon as his classes are done. Only today, he doesn’t move to the back of the library to join Malfoy to do his homework. Instead, he stops in front of Mrs Prince’s desk and takes out Sirius’ letter.
Harry shakes his head. He knows this. Sirius always takes care of Remus. He won’t leave him alone during the worst night of the month.
“My professor is the worst,” Teddy complains, drawing Harry’s attention to where he’s still slung over Harry’s shoulder.
“Okay,” Teddy concedes, releasing Harry with a put upon sigh. “I love Draco too, but I’ll love him like I love you.”
Mother comes to oversee the design of the nursery. A room that once belonged to Potter—the place where he kept his work and sports equipment. Walls Draco has avoided until now. His mother removes the dust cloths from the sparse furniture that remains in Potter’s wake.
Downstairs, once he’s in a pair of fresh joggers and a t-shirt, Harry finds Draco setting an afternoon snack down in front of where Teddy is swinging his thin legs against the counter. It’s all rather domestic and strange.
When they walk through the empty corridors—class already having started—Teddy grumbles. “I can walk myself.”
Potter crosses his arms and leans against the bannister of the stairs—a thoughtful expression on his face. “He says you’re the worst.” Then after a moment of consideration—while that revelation barrels into Draco—Potter continues. “Though, I must admit that you don’t seem that terrible. Considering I remember when you
Draco smiles, thinking of his own mother. Wishing she were still around for him to reprimand. Broken hearts are just as deadly as untreated colds—perhaps worse.
“That’s not at all healthy,” Draco replies. “Perhaps if you eat this without complaint I will make you a proper pizza.” He manages to say this without sounding condescending.
Silence envelops the room, swallowing them both in its heavy hold. Draco hates it. “I’ve missed you,” he confesses. “I shouldn’t, not when you’ve got a man as kind as Dudley.” Draco gives a self-deprecating laugh. “I hate him, you know? I hate how he gets you. All of you. Not just your marvellous cock.”
Professor Snape continued to say that if I hadn’t gone down the Chamber to safe Draco (Draco’s father gave me a swift, sharp look at this point), Draco would have certainly died and maybe even more students after him. Dobby kept doing his weird pointing and hitting himself routine and suddenly it made sense. Draco hadn’t stumbled onto the diary by accident this summer; his father had planned for him to find it. So I took those little slivers of bravery inside of me and asked Mr Malfoy if he knew how Draco had gotten hold of that diary. Draco’s head snapped up at that next to me and I still regret that I couldn’t see his face. I just didn’t want to lose eye-contact with his father.
Since then he talks to me during Potions, telling me what he’s doing and making sure I understand. It helps a lot and I feel like I’m getting better at it now. Zabini is also starting conversations with me now in the dorms when we brush our teeth and get ready for school in the morning. It’s kind of nice to have someone to talk to when I’m in the dungeon.
"Okay, I'll see you around three." Harry answers. He can’t think of how upset Molly will be and how it will ruin her table setting. He needs to focus on Draco before he loses him to another addiction. He puts down the phone and focuses on the pancakes he's about to make. Ron is right; things will get better. Draco just needs some time and love. And Harry is more than willing to give him all the love he has.
“He doesn’t want anyone to know,” Harry says. He looks around again, but there seems to be no other students in sight. This part of the library hardly ever gets used.
Luckily for us, that was the moment Professor Snape showed up at the bottom of the stairs, asking what was going on. Filch said it was Peeves, that he’d thrown the egg. But Professor Snape took one look at the egg, shook his head and told Filch he would make sure that the rightful owner would get his egg back. That it probably belongs to Harry, and that Harry could collect it from his office in the morning, together with Draco. And that they can expect a nasty detention for being out of bed in the middle of the night. Draco and I both stayed quiet. We would serve detention, everything was better than having Filch drag us to his office and going to the Headmaster. The headmaster would be obligated to inform our guardians, something Snape promised not to do again, unless absolutely necessary. He still feels bad about what happened after Christmas with Draco’s dad. He walked in on us when Draco was holding one of his father's letters with tears in his eyes. I think it made an impression on Professor Snape.
“Don’t think that will stop them,” Harry says. “Lavender is still trying to hit on me, even now, when she knows I’m gay.”
Harry rubs his fist over his chest. “I’m sorry,” he says. And then he pulls the parchment to him again. ‘I’ve done something behind your back that I should have talked to you about first,’ he writes.
“You looking at her,” the man said. His hand pointed to the bones on the floor and Draco understood. The potion had killed her, leaving nothing but her bones behind.
“You’re an idiot,” Zabini says a moment later. He stands in front of Harry, with Parkinson just behind him.
“Do you want us to take you with us to the party, or should I take you home?” Luna asks. Draco is glad she doesn’t ask why he’s here, broken down on the side of a street.
Oh, just shut up, kiss me, and let me write to my parents in peace. I still need to tell them about the anonymous gift.
Before we got a chance to lift off, something happened to Neville. I think he lifted up too soon and he started rising higher and higher above the ground. Neville was as white as a ghost and started to slip off his broom. He fell down and broke his wrist. If Neville continues like this, he’ll be a regular at the hospital wing before the first month of school is over. Madam Hooch took him to the hospital wing and threatened us that we would be expelled if we would fly on our brooms.
Harry has no idea how long they fly around. It goes slow and they stay low to the ground. Draco does venture a little higher after a while, but not far enough to experience that true feeling of freedom that Harry gets when he’s on a broom, high in the sky, with nothing but the wind around him.
We reached the third-floor corridor door and it was already ajar. So Snape was already there and he had left a harp next to the trap door. I took out my flute and started to play. Fluffy’s eyes dropped closed. It didn’t take long before he was fast asleep. Ron warned me not to stop playing, while we crept toward the trapdoor. We had to step over Fluffy’s legs to reach it and Ron went first. He opened the trapdoor and told us he couldn’t see anything and that there was no way of climbing down. We had to drop down. I gave the flute to Hermione and then I climbed over Fluffy’s legs. I lowered myself through the hole and then I let go. I fell very far down but I landed on something soft. It felt like some sort of plant. I screamed at the others that it was okay to come down. Ron and Hermione jumped and landed next to me.
“He’s more understanding than you give him credit for. And I hate lying to him. He thinks you’re hung up on Cedric,” Hermione says.
Remus gets that look on his face when he’s about to say something Harry won’t like. “Harry, I can’t guarantee that Draco is willing to put in the extra work,” he says.
“This is more important than my school subjects,” Hermione answers. “It’s not fair that Malfoy can only understand half of what we’re saying. So the sooner we all learn to include him, the better.”
“Just what, Potter? The press got nasty pictures of you? Did they stop you from doing your work, again? Spit it out. We both know you’ll feel better once you’ve complained about it all being so unfair.”
“Just because we figured out that he’s deaf, doesn’t mean we have to become his friend,” Neville says. Harry opens his mouth to respond but Neville is quicker. “Who am I kidding? You wouldn’t be Harry Potter if you would let this go.”
And then the world crumbles. Draco flinches and pushes Harry away from him. His eyes are wide and he claps a hand over his mouth. He shakes his head and takes steps away from Harry. His eyes tear      up and Harry wants to reach out. Only the distance between them grows by the second. Harry messed up. He needs to say something. He wants to take it all back. If only Draco would just stop his tread away from him. Harry reaches out as a tear escapes Draco’s eye.
Harry sits down next to her. “I’m sorry,” he says. And he is. He’s tried to get Draco to see sense. This crazy idea of his that Pansy got pregnant on purpose just to spite him is absurd.
“Fine, I’ll go make breakfast. Strawberry pancakes with syrup?” Harry gets up and moves towards the kitchen.
That evening we had a massive party in the dungeon. There were Butterbeers and so many snacks. We celebrated until I couldn’t stand on my legs anymore. Draco carried me to our dormitory and Blaise shouted at us to remember to use silencing charms. We both laughed and once in bed, Draco took his time undressing me. He kissed me everywhere and I came inside his mouth. I thought getting jerked off by him was amazing, well I can tell you, having him suck me off is even better.
The Slytherin side of the stadium exploded. Marcus sped towards me and seized me around the neck, sobbing unrestrainedly into my shoulder. And then I got hugged by Adrian, Miles, Draco and even Derrick and Bole. We were all shouting that we’d won the cup. We moved as one back to the ground and were greeted by our housemates. They lifted us onto their shoulders and walked us to the stands, where headmaster Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup. Marcus took the cup and kissed it before he handed it to me. I lifted it into the air while Draco wrapped his arms around my waist. We both couldn’t stop smiling. I handed the cup back to Marcus and Draco spun me around in his arms. His lips were on mine in seconds. We devoured each other until Professor Snape told us that we were ruining his good day.
Third-year starts and brings with it the Dementors, who seem to affect Harry more than any other student. And who is this Sirius Black that has escaped from Azkaban? Harry and Draco try to figure it out in the little free time they have next to all their extra classes, Quidditch training and Harry's therapy sessions.
Harry lets out a heavy sigh. “I could be the youngest professional Quidditch player of the century,” he says without meaning it. They both know that won’t happen if he drops out of school now. He’s too young to be on the radar of any of the scouts. They won’t start paying attention to him before he takes his OWLs.
Well, it is better than the things Harry has fantasied about all night. All the horrible things he wants to yell at Draco. Draco should be proud of him for not making a scene.
Hermione shakes her head. “Pettigrew won’t get in here. Hogwarts is well protected. And there are Dementors outside the gates. He will never get past them.”
“Yes, extra syrup, please,” Teddy yells after him without taking his eyes off his Duplo. Draco sits down on the sofa and picks up the book he’s been trying to read for weeks. He’s still stuck in the first chapter. No matter how much he tries, the story can’t catch his attention. His thoughts just keep circling in his head, bringing him down and making it unable to focus on anything.
Hermione is also going to be in Diagon Alley tomorrow and I’m really looking forward to seeing her again. I’ve missed her. And I hope we will run into Draco, so I can ask him what is going on.
“There is something else that I can tell you,” James says with a grin on his face. “Your mum and I decided you need some cheering up, so we don’t want you to wait until your birthday.”
I’m glad Blaise still talks to me, and when we have a class without the Gryffindors he sits next to him in class. He told me he asked Draco why he was acting like a stupid fool, only to get the same treatment as Ron and Hermione. Blaise said Draco screamed at him, saying he would never understand and that it was none of his business anyway. I told Blaise it is okay, that I still have my other friends, including him. And he promised me that he really liked hanging out with me. But he’s also hanging out a lot with this crazy Ravenclaw lady. He says she’s a lot of fun and that I should come to join them in the library one day. I promised him I will. So maybe life without Draco isn’t going to be so bad after all. I just need to start forgetting about him. I’m sure that one day I’ll find someone else to give my heart to. It can’t be that Draco will be the only person I will ever love, will it? Mom, did you ever love anyone else but dad? And what about you, dad?
Harry looks at them. His eyes lock with Hermione. They are moist as if she knows. And she probably does. She always knew what it was that Harry wasn’t saying. But it’s too late now.
“I just thought that I was the one helping him,” Harry says. “But the truth is, that I need him more than he ever needed me.”
Things have become worse again. I still have nightmares and Malfoy has been making fun of that fact whenever he can. I told Hermione about the nightmares and the mirror I found. I didn’t tell her about your cloak, dad. I don’t know why, but I want to keep that just between you and me for now. Hermione was horrified about the fact that I had been out of bed at night, saying Filch could have caught me. She doesn’t know what to do about the nightmares; her advice was to think about happy thoughts before I go to sleep. I don’t think she understands how hard that is when you have an entire dormitory that wants to beat you up if you’re not careful.
“No, it’s not,” Draco signs. His lips thin and his movements become aggressive. Their date is going to get ruined if they keep this up. Maybe it’s already ruined. Draco is upset and Harry is tense. And it all started out so great. Why did Harry have to overthink it all? He’s a fool. And an even bigger fool for what he’s about to say. Because it’s definitely too soon for love confessions. They haven’t even finished their first date.
“Yes, I was wondering, what is up with that?” Ginny asks. She lays her head on Harry’s shoulder. “Why are you suddenly friends with crazy Malfoy?”
Tears fall from Harry’s eyes. He can’t stop Draco. Minutes pass and Harry’s breathing becomes shallow. He’s cold and the pain in his head is intensifying. One of Draco’s hand twist in Harry’s hair and the other holds one of Harry’s hands on the floor. Harry looks at his arm. Pinned down by Draco. Harry’s skin looks pale and his fingernails are blue. His rapid heartbeat is slowing and Harry can’t remember how he’d got to the astronomy tower.
We’ve been having exams all week. Our first exam was Transfiguration, where we had to change a teapot into a tortoise. I think I did okay even though my tortoise still had a willow patterned shell. Next was Charms, where the cheering charm was on the test. I slightly overdid mine and Draco ended up in fits of hysterical laughter for over an hour before he could finish his exam. Because of that we were late for dinner and I was afraid Draco would be mad at me, but he said it was kind of nice, to forget his worries about the exams for a little.
Pettigrew takes a step towards Draco. He’s closer to him than Harry, and there is no way Harry will beat him there. He needs to warn Draco and try to stop Pettigrew. There is one spell Harry knows that might help. He’s not supposed to know it yet, but James had thought it to both Neville and Harry, for when they would be in danger and needed to protect themselves.
A soft voice came from the side, saying: ‘he won’t wake’. I jumped up and spun around. A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar. He was blurred around the edges and he looked at me with fascinated eyes. I asked him who he was and he told me he was Tom Riddle. I shook my head, that couldn’t be possible. Tom Riddle was the memory trapped inside Draco’s notebook; he could not be a person here in the school.
Sorry, it’s been a while since I wrote to you. Malfoy keeps staring at me while I’m in our dormitory, making it hard to take out my notebook and write to you. I don’t want them to know about this. I’m afraid they will read it or steal it and burn it, or something. But I have to tell you about the troll that was in the school around Halloween, so I’m hoping they will stay away for a little longer.
I also need to tell you about our last lesson of Care of Magical Creatures before the holiday. Hagrid has shown us these funny little creatures named Nifflers. They have a flurry black fur and their paws look like spades. They are a big fan of things that sparkle. So they loved Daphne’s nails that she had painted with purple sparkling nail polish. And one almost bit Pansy when it went for her watch. We all had fun about that.
Draco. He’s still here. Still alive. And still held firmly by Pettigrew. Pettigrew has his wand pointed towards Harry now. Harry looks at him. He’s going to die. He wishes Draco could see him now. That Harry could at least sign that Harry loves him.
When Harry was eleven and went to Hogwarts for the first time his uncle Sirius told him about the legend. Harry had thought it was silly. How could a boy repeat seventh year over and over again without anyone noticing? By the time he started third year it made more sense. Hogwarts was a weird place where strange things happened. And during the TriWizard tournament of fourth year, he learnt that students could die when not careful. And how quickly everyone around him forgot about poor Cedric who had used potions to try to win, only to be found dead in the maze after Viktor Krum had secured the victory. And now that he’s started seventh year he wonders who it could be, the student that has turned into a vampire and secretly feeds on seventh years without anyone noticing. He’s sure all his dorm mates have always been there. His best friend Ron, the combustible Seamus, creative Dean and the little awkward Nevile. He has memories off all of them through the years.
The day after the match we heard that Black and broken into Gryffindor tower. He had torn Ron’s bed hangings. Neville told us all about it, said Black had a knife and that it was all his fault. He had lost the piece of paper with the passwords for that week and that is how Black had gotten into Gryffindor tower. He’s banned from any more Hogsmeade visits this year. I felt really sorry for him when he got a howler from his grandmother.
No one escapes the nightmares. That’s what his headshrinker tells Harry every time he tries to unpack the baggage he was handed from infancy.
“So you let yourself into my bathroom—stare at me starkers—because you want to talk about my kid?” He’s trying to sound angry and not mortified, and Harry’s not sure if he’s succeeding.
There’s no wireless giving play-by-plays of any matches, and Harry hates the slow, boring jazzy sound that’s coming from the pianist. He removes his glasses, setting them against the bar before rubbing his fingers over his tired eyelids. When he picks up his glasses, intending to put them on and leave, a familiar voice sounds from a table nearby.
Dudley worked him hard this morning and again in the afternoon after they had a protein-heavy lunch. Harry’s veins are ropy beneath his skin—visible in his forearms and today one is visible on his right bicep. It’s startling, still, to know that his body is far beyond what it was when he was still a slim, underfed looking brat. Harry’s still slender, but he’s muscle thick and powerful. Not pasty and unfortunate looking like he was up until he turned nineteen and started training with Dudley.
Draco is rarely surprised these days, but he’s surprised when Potter walks over to his and Pansy’s table some ten minutes after Pansy tells Draco she’s sorry she can’t get Potter to fuck him. If Pansy had that sort of power she’d be in business for life and wouldn’t have to rely on the old, perverted fucks who fund her sugar-baby lifestyle. Though, to be fair, Pansy enjoys her lifestyle as a kept mistress for many men. Draco’s offered to hire her with some useless title for his estate and she’s turned him down.
Draco tenses, his heart thundering at the mention of another man in Potter’s life. One who is allowed to dictate some of Potter’s behaviours. “Oh,” is all he can think to say in response.
“It’s fair when we’re running late." Harry laughs. Easily lifting Teddy over his broad shoulder. The little bugger kicks his long legs against Harry’s solid chest and stomach, but it is harmless compared to the blows Harry takes at work. More like a kitten trying to provoke him when he’s used to wrestling tigers. “Stop fighting, you’re going to school.”
“What do you want?” Ms Linde, his headshrinker, asks when their session is spent in silence. Harry hasn’t said a word—his gaze lingering on the clock that ticks steadily on her office wall.
Hastily she cautions Harry when she sees him staring off into the distance—as if she can tell where his mind wanders. Where it lingers on the dips in Draco’s sharp hips. A place he loved to leave the brand of his teeth.
“Let me know, I might be working. But if I’m not, I’m interested in going.” Harry’s still waiting on the final schedule for the preliminaries. Once those are done he will have a month, perhaps, before the tournament begins. Then it’s anyone’s guess when he’ll have time to play at proper parent.
He must relay all of this to Ms Linde, for she watches him with pity. Her voice cracking when she tells Harry, “You’re still worthy, Mr Potter.”
Pansy is perched on her sofa in a black peignoir set made of flimsy lace and fine silk. A mimosa is sat at her immediate left, untouched, as she narrows her blue eyes at Draco while she sucks down a cigarette.
Harry snorts while Teddy watches Draco with a confused look. One that drags long enough to be uncomfortable, so Draco says, “Right then, dinner? Then your Potter and I need to have a bit of a chat.”
Draco’s feet are locked at the small of Potter’s strong back, helping to keep the wonderful angle. One that helps Draco feel the build of orgasm. He cants his own hips, wishing for the slightest bit of friction. Potter’s hard abs provide little help.
“Look, I’ll talk to him. He’ll tell me eventually and when he does we can sort it then.” Potter is oddly pragmatic about the whole situation—something, Draco had not expected when he brought Teddy home.
The door is opened by a large man with blond hair and beady blue eyes. “Yeah?” he asks and Draco swallows—afraid to speak for fear of one of those giant fists crushing him.
“Could’ve fooled me,” Draco whispers as he rocks his hips. “Kid still won’t look me in the eye most days.”
Potter’s eyes are a fiery caress against his skin. The way they map his every movement has Draco growing warm beneath the collar. What doesn’t help is the memory of Potter in the shower—water sluicing over the hard, golden muscles of his body. Everything about Potter’s body is immaculate. Larger than Draco remembers him being in youth and it makes Draco’s own body yearn for a touch.
“Still makes me the boss, Potter,” Dudley points with one of his thick fingers. A stern expression on his large face. “Now, get back in that ring. Time to run more drills.”
Dudley is saying more, but Draco blurts, “How long have you been partners?” He flushes at his own forwardness, but this man doesn’t seem to notice.
That’s how Draco finds him, and Harry grins—content—when Draco says, “Lucky for you, Potter, I’m excellent at finding hidden things.”
The wards allow him in, and he grins as he sneaks down the front corridor. Harry’s aiming to surprise Draco, his cock is already hard at the idea of Draco going to his knees in his usual eager way.
“Indeed,” Draco responds. “I just need to have a chat with Potter about how we can make sure you get to school on time. It’s for your success because every adult in this room wants you to reach full potential.”
The way Draco’s breath hitches when he’s close—it’s something none of them can fake well enough for Harry’s tastes. Makes his wanks unfulfilling when he tries to get into them, but Draco makes the sort of noises he wants to capture. The sort of sounds he wants to listen to forever while pulling on his cock beneath the hot spray of his shower.
“God, harder,” Draco demands in that voice that haunts Harry’s more pleasant dreams. “Don’t be gentle,” he pleads and it sounds like he’s craving punishment.
Mother hosts her annual charity gala for the orphans of war. Draco, as her only child, is expected to attend. So he stands, in the swelter of summer, willing the sun down to give him reprieve in the hot garden. Even the cooling charms don’t chase away hot flashes, and Draco feels like a cheap toy as he is paraded around to all of the guests.
Pansy ignores him, grabbing the bottle of champagne from their ice bucket to pour herself another generous glass. After a long drink of it, Pansy jumps back into the conversation. Zeroing in on the one thing Draco doesn’t want to discuss—Potter’s cock. “Tell me about it, then—this not small cock of Potter’s. Was it long and thick and sinfully pretty?”
“Can’t fuck a partner the way I like to fuck my one-offs, mate.” Harry leans back against the cool brick of the wall.
Predictably, Pansy’s mouth drops open in ghastly surprise. True shock. Not just her faux-horror that she plays up when they are surrounded by others. “When did you fuck Potter?” she demands with a low hiss—once her wits return to her.
Draco is perched beneath a tree, glistening from the warmth of summer. One beautiful hand over a swell that Harry would be blind to miss.
“Tell me what you want,” Potter commands as he moves closer. His strong hands gripping the back of Draco’s neck. Holding him with a firmness that makes Draco shudder with want.
No one ever told Draco that being left behind is a pain none can prepare for, final like death but where the other person still exists. A rejection, unlike any other, Draco is numb yet breaking in Potter's absence.
Malfoy was fractured like him, but still became a shining beacon of hope. A crutch—that’s how Hermione described the dependency.
“Yes, Mr Potter, it is I.” There’s more sarcasm when he talks to Harry. But it lacks the complete hostility of their youth. “Now, if you don’t mind, you are interrupting my class.”
Dinner ends without incident, then Potter directs Teddy to head upstairs for a bath. The child goes with a pout—no doubt upset that he’s not being included in their discussion.
Draco manages a grin at that and gives a hum of thanks. All the while he thinks about what he could’ve done to upset Teddy enough to not want to come to school. He can’t recall—beyond the mild tift he had with Weasel when he brought Teddy to parents evening. Which had been tame when one considers the fights they’d had during their own school years. “Perhaps I’ve frightened him in some way.” He frowns, upset because this is his first year teaching at Morgana’s and Draco’s feeling useless.
“It’s because he’s got a crush on you,” Potter confesses as he grips Draco’s hips. “Now, let's leave that conversation because I’ve got a bigger need for you than anyone else.” Something in Potter’s tone is possessive and Draco grins at his ridiculousness.
Teddy’s young problem is that he’s overly attached to Harry. An only child with a single parent—it’s not a stretch to say he’s spoilt rotten and is the centre of Harry’s world.
“Darling,” Pansy shrills at him. Calling Draco out of his rapid, anxious line of thoughts, into the present where Potter is sitting across from him in an outfit made for sinning. Dressy but casual. Potter is in all black—his button-up shirt open at the collar and his sleeves rolled up his strong forearms, exposing those delicious ropey veins lying beneath his golden skin. Veins Draco wants to map with the point of his tongue. “You’re drooling.” Pansy’s voice is a soft puff of a damp whisper, tickling his ear. He swallows with shame when he notices Potter watching him.
Dudley is at the gym Harry has made his home away from home. The one that is near enough Diagon if Harry needs St Mungo’s and is located in Muggle London for his Muggle cousin’s convenience. He seems amused that Harry’s late again. A taunting sort of smile rests on Dudley’s thin mouth when Harry comes in through the heavy metal door.
“Let’s ring her at the Floo. I’m sure it’s nothing bad,” he tells Audrey with a kind tone and smile.
Something he kicks himself for when one of his students pulls on the hem of his sleeve. “Mr Malfoy,” she says. Draco nearly startles out of his skin.
With a judgemental expression, Pansy informs Draco that he’s the only one who has ever found Potter to be perfect. “You’re absolutely mad, darling. A complete fool. Hopelessly in love with a buffoon.”
His eyes are desperate; searching for someone to fill the void Potter has left within him. A momentary escape from the reality of what this is.
“You’re lucky they called me instead of hauling you in for assault.” Ron squats beside him, peering into his face with concern. “What happened, Harry?”
They end their lunch close to the time Teddy is due to finish school for the day, and Ron waves to Harry before he leaves. “Don’t want to beat Malfoy before I’ve got good reason to,” he says with a tone that makes Harry laugh.
Which is probably some divine punishment for the way he used to treat Teddy’s natural father. Adding to his overdue karma is the memory of all the horrible things they used to chortle about at family dinners—the ones where they talked of the cousin born to Aunt Andromeda, the one who was
She snorts. “Either you’ve fucked him so you know his prick isn’t tiny, or you just don’t like me insulting your precious Potter. So which is it?”
It’s the mantra he silently repeats to himself as he comes in through the front of the house. It’s cheery red door a welcome sight, and even more welcome is the large black dog that comes galloping up to greet him. “Did you miss me, Septimus?”
Septimus bays in response, falling in step with Harry as he makes his way up to the top floor of the home. Bloody dog lies on the tile of the bathroom while Harry has a shower, and he’s too tired to try and force the dog out. So he leaves the door to the bathroom open and discards his clothes in a pile on the floor before he climbs beneath the hot spray coming from the showerhead.
“So, that means we can go to ice cream with him.” Teddy declares as if the matter is settled. Harry doesn’t argue. He’s wondering how he can convince Ron to go for ice cream in his place.
“Promises, promises.” Draco tries to play coy. The effect is ruined by his breathy tone and the high flush in his skin. He’s too eager to pretend to be glib.
He’s a man starved for intimacy. As such, Draco doesn’t turn down the offered invitations—the ones that come with long, meaningful stares and a promise to feel.
Potter shouldn’t look as appealing as he does in grey joggers and an absurd hoodie. His hair is a wild mess of disarray—even still Draco wants to bury his nose into the dark strands, inhale the rich masculine scent of Potter. Thinking of breathing him in reminds Draco of when he was on his knees, staring up at Potter as he took that beautiful cock all the way down his throat. The tip of his nose brushing the fragrant, coarse hair that surrounded the base of Potter’s cock.
“Potter,” Draco gasps. His hands moving to Harry’s unruly hair when Harry’s mouth swallows down Draco’s cock. “Fucking hell,” Draco keens, rocking his hips while Harry’s mouth creates filthy noises. Noises that every porn doesn’t quite manage to recreate—there’s something authentic in this messy filth.
“Really?” he teases with fingers on Draco’s bum, “I’ve got something you might need to help me find later.”
It’s what Draco feels now as he stands in the threshold of Potter’s room. Watching as Potter lies on a hospital bed, appearing so fragile.
Draco chuckles against the cool lip of his glass and takes a purposefully long sip. He’s going to make her fester while she waits for his answer.
“Oh, right, school,” the man says absently. “I wasn’t sure how to get him there, to be honest.” He steps aside to allow Draco into Potter’s flat. “Drink?” He offers.
Potter holds his wrists with a bruising grip—keeping Draco from touching his own cock as Potter sets a sure, fast rhythm. In and out, his long, thick cock glides into Draco with a delightful stretch. One that might ruin him for other cocks if Potter keeps proving he’s the best at everything.
Pale lips tremble and Harry wants to kiss away the fears on that beautiful mouth when Draco whispers, “I can’t love you if you won’t give me everything, it hurts too much, Harry.”
Grey eyes lift and their gazes lock, neither says anything but Harry knows this is the beginning. He’s already rooted in Draco, and the devil knows Draco is in him.
“My mummy is very late,” she replies with a timid tone. Causing Draco to scan the area—noticing that indeed she is the last student with him. A frown of concern dips down the corners of his mouth, and he leads Audrey inside.
Draco wears a bemused grin when he reminds her, “As if we don’t hold fast to the bloodlines we are loyal to.”
No amount of cleansing will remove Potter from this space, but Draco is willing to let his mother try.
Draco watches—face impassive—as Potter sets the brass key on Draco’s desk. A key that was more symbol than useful, one that served as a promise.
Harry feels sick to his stomach. Wretched and broken he stumbles back, away from the sight of them, and it hurts him to know Draco hadn’t even noticed his presence.
He begs nothing and is rewarded with a lungful of Potter’s fresh, masculine scent when his mother pulls the cloth from Potter’s favourite chair.
Draco’s pulse is fast beneath Harry’s fingers and he tries to be soothing when he says, “I think you know what my type is by now, Malfoy.”
It’s not a long walk from The Three Broomsticks to Morgana’s, but Harry takes his time with it. Wanting to keep from standing uselessly around while waiting for the final bell. Too many times already women have tried chatting him up, and a few blokes or they’ll try to profess their undying gratitude. Which can be overwhelming and anxiety-inducing. A lot of the time, those interactions cause him to be wracked with survivor's guilt. Something he experiences daily when he sees Teddy’s face—Lupin’s kind eyes and Tonk’s smile. They torment him in quiet moments—moments he hides from Teddy as best as he can, but they are still there. Suffocating and heavy.
More accurately, Hermione decided on the home. Harry was busy trying to balance the life of having a baby full time, vetting nannies, and competing for the title of champion at the first of many cage duelling competitions Harry would enter.
Potter promises he will with an amused chuckle and tells Draco to get home safely as he follows him to the front door.
“Hmmm.” Harry glances down. Teddy’s staring up at him expectantly, as if he’s said something other than Harry’s name, and he swallows. Wondering how he can ask Teddy to repeat himself without letting on he wasn’t listening.
“This won’t bring him back, Pansy.” Draco finally says when he can no longer distract himself within the few good memories. Ones that tended to lean more towards carnal than anything tangible.
Dudley’s the one who suggests Harry go out for the evening. “Look, mate,” he said earlier in the afternoon. “I don’t usually suggest this sort of workout, but you need to get out there and get fucked.”
He hadn’t wanted to face Draco so he’d pretended to be heavily in the hold of sleep. A coward’s way, but Harry hadn’t wanted to admit all of the hurt he’d felt as he’d watched another claim what he felt was his.
“Why not,” she asks Draco after lighting a cigarette. Her red nails long and sharp—Harry’s half afraid she’s going to scratch Draco’s eyes out with those nails when she narrows her eyes at Malfoy. “You were saying you like them tall, broad, and dangerous. I found you someone who fits that description.”
Ron’s warning about Draco whispers through Harry’s mind, “That’s a bad road, mate. Fucking an old enemy...you’ll never leave war.”
Draco is everywhere in the space between Harry’s thoughts. A leaden cloak of guilt that drags behind Harry wherever he goes. Whispering reminders of how good it once was.
Potter is waiting for him outside of his flat’s door. Leant against the bright teal paint of it as he grins at Draco.
“Who’s there?” the Fat Lady asks when Harry pushes the portrait open. “Students should not be out of bed at this time of the night,” she complains.
“The bottles,” Harry stammers. He waves his hand towards the bathroom. He needs to know where Draco got them from. He will hunt the person down and murder them.
Lucius sits down next to Draco and nods his approval. Draco’s deed has put him back into the Dark Lord’s good books. He will be forgiven for losing the diary. Draco still doesn’t understand. What was so special about an old diary that it would anger the Dark Lord in the way it did? Draco told Harry what had happened last summer. How Lucius had been tortured and wasn’t able to stop shivering for days after, all because of that one diary.
Harry runs his hand through his hair as he reads Malfoy’s words. Does he truly want to give up before he even starts? That is just stupid.
Draco can feel his mother's eyes on him. But he can’t look at her. He needs to face the Dark Lord. He needs to hear the impossible tasks that will be entrusted to him. A task that will kill him for sure. There is no way he will be able to finish off the strongest wizard alive.
Things are better now. I have to see a mind healer once a week. We talk about my classes mostly. Sometimes we talk about you, or how it is to live with the Dursleys. She never asks me why I did it, and I’m glad. I don’t really want to talk about it. Hermione is still petrified and I’ve been to visit her a couple of times. It’s hard to see her lying there, so still. It almost looks like she’s dead. But Miss Davis says it’s good to go and see her and talk to her like I would do if she wasn’t petrified, so I do.
“I’m a dad,” Ron says. And then Harry hugs the man. Draco gets up from his chair and picks up the present they brought along. He follows the excited talks of Harry and Ron to the room where Hermione and the new baby will be waiting for them. Draco just looks in from the doorway. He watches as Hermione smiles at Harry, a newborn baby on her chest, her arms protectively around it. Harry kisses Hermione on the cheek and then looks at the baby. He smiles and caresses her cheek with one of his fingers. It’s so gentle and beautiful. And it breaks Draco’s heart.
Draco holds on to this flutter of hope. And Draco will believe Harry’s words and somehow this nightmare will end. He will find his way to the correct side of this war again. He will make Harry proud and do all can to stop the dark forces surrounding him. Dumbledore will help him and save him from his faith.
He left just before I started this letter. He promised to come when the Ministry is going to do their test to prove that Draco and I have this special soul bond. I keep forgetting the name and Draco is asleep right now so I can’t ask him. I’ll tell you the next time I write to you.
“Hiding what from me, Pansy. You are freaking me out. What is it?” Draco starts to worry now. He thought she’d pissed off some guy again and would need a place to hide out for a while. But if she has already confided in Blaise and Ginny, it’s something else. Something worse.
Harry gets a hold of Malfoy’s arms and keeps them in front of his chest. He looks Malfoy in the eyes. “It’s okay,” he says.
We had dinner at the Leaky Cauldron. The five of us ate our way through five delicious courses. Draco’s mother was a bit hesitant to eat there, but Mrs Tonks promised her it was good food and that it was nice to not have to think about which fork to use. After dinner, we were all full and sleepy. Hermione her parents came to pick her up and the rest of used the floo to get back home. Draco is staying with at the moment. His father is off on some business trip and won’t notice that he’s not at home. His mother is also here at the Tonks. I think she really loves hanging out with her sister.
No, he shouldn’t think like that. Just because he lost too many loved ones, that doesn’t mean that he’s doomed, that everyone around him will die. He’s not alone. He’s got Draco, the blond git that has stolen Harry’s heart and makes every day better. He’s got Teddy, his godson, that loves him and is growing up so fast. He’s got Ron and Hermione, his best friends. And all the other Weasleys. He’s got friends that are still alive and well, Neville, Luna, Ginny and Blaise, Seamus and Dean, Greg, and even Pansy. Who would have ever thought he would call her his friend one day? Not that Pansy feels the same, it’s clear she hates Harry. The price to pay for stealing the man she loves apparently.
The first night I spend back in my own bed I woke up again from one of my nightmares. The once with Draco disappearing all the time. Draco read some of my letters to you and knew what was going on, so he climbed into my bed and hugged me until I stopped crying and had fallen back to sleep. Ever since then he just crawls into my bed in the evening and his presence, warm and safe against my back, with his arm around my stomach, it helps me sleep through the night.
The piano has to go too. There is no way Harry can keep it. Not after all the nights he found Draco sitting in front of it, his hands on the keys producing the most amazing sounds. Harry could sit at his desk all night, trying to get work done, but being mesmerised by Draco’s singing voice. A voice Harry will never hear again.
“Both, mostly the latter,” Neville says. He looks towards the lake. The grass around it is crowded with students. Most of them with books on their laps, busy studying for the upcoming exams.
“I messed it up. I let him goat me into another fight,” Harry says when they turn the corner so they can start the stroll back to the castle.
“But still, I don’t want her to think I’m not happy for them,” Draco says. He can’t help it. He feels guilty for not celebrating with them. No matter how much they understand, it’s wrong and impolite.
Neville and Iris ignore Harry. “But I bet it has something to do with a certain person that has been ignoring him,” Neville continues.
They reach the classroom. The door is still closed. There is only one other student this early. Malfoy sits on the floor next to the door, his hair falls into his face. He doesn’t look up from his book when Harry, Neville and Hermione stop on the other side of the hallway. Harry wonders what it would feel like to push that hair out of Malfoy’s face. Would Malfoy let him?
I did have to empty out my pockets, Snape said he couldn’t let me keep everything I bought at Hogsmeade since I was not even supposed to be there. So I emptied them out. Snape took my bag with Zonko’s tricks and the Marauder's Map. He was very interested in the map, asked me what the piece of parchment was. I told him it was a spare bit, but he knows me too well, I would never carry around spare bits of parchment. So he used his wand to try to get the Map to show itself. And then the map started to insult him, told him to keep out of other people’s business, and that he’s ugly and an idiot.
Harry shakes his head. “You know what it was like for Uncle Sirius when he came out. His family kicked him out. Draco comes from the same family. He won’t be okay with me being gay. And then to add that I’m head over heels for him. I can’t tell him.”
“Nobody,” Neville says. His cheeks turn red and Harry shakes his head. He signs ‘Ginny’ and Neville nods.
“My brother. The ‘Boy Who Lived’. Have you seen him?” Harry says with narrowed eyes. How can they not know who Neville is? The entire school knows Neville. He’s a celebrity. A dead celebrity if Harry doesn’t find him soon.
“I’m not a drag,” Ron says. “I’m confused. I thought that the two of them were going to date, get married and all that stuff so Harry could become my brother. With the way they are, always so in tune with each other. It’s scary.”
Draco laughs and pulls Harry in for another kiss. Their lips smash together, and Draco crawls on top of Harry’s lap, his legs around his hips. It doesn’t take long before their sweaters lay somewhere around them on the floor and Harry starts to open Draco’s trousers. Draco feels relieved when Harry works his way inside him, knowing he’s just as eager as Draco to get what they want.
Lupin came barging into the hospital wing than. He rushed to Sirius to check on him. And maybe there is still hope for them if Professor Lupin is so worried about Sirius. I truly hope so for Sirius. I know he would nothing more than to have Lupin back in the way they were before that faithful Halloween night.
Well, I think that’s all for now, I’ll write to you again soon. Draco just finished his shower and I have to go braid his hair so we can go get some breakfast.
Together with Hagrid’s package came also my Hogwarts letter for the coming year. It was the normal stuff, informing me that the school year will start on the 1st of September and a list with the books and supplies I will need. But it also included a permission form to visit Hogsmeade. That made me a little sad because there was no way Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia were going to sign it for me.
The next morning Aunt Marge came to visit. You know I’ve told you about her before. She’s Uncle Vernon’s sister, the one and only bulldog breeder. She was the one that beat me with her walking stick on Dudley’s fifth birthday to stop me from winning musical statues. And a few years later she gave me dog biscuits for Christmas. And the year before I went to Hogwarts I accidentally (and maybe a little bit on purpose) I stepped on the tail of her favourite dog. The beast had chased me into a tree and Aunt Marge didn’t call him off until long after midnight. And now that nightmare was visiting again, for a whole week. It was the worst birthday present I ever got from the Dursleys.
Long fingers trace over the evidence of what Potter has left within him. Draco watches—mesmerised—as the little blob moves in and out of focus. Already an energetic thing that captures his heart.
“He’s already got a partner?” she finally says as she snuffs her cigarette out in a crystal ashtray.
As night travels past dusk and moves into to dawn, Pansy finally snaps. “What’s with you tonight? That bloke you’ve been eyeing for weeks came over to grin at you with his stupid smile and you’re too spaced out to show any interest.”
Potter’s response is a low chuckle. One that’s just this side of dangerous, “Didn’t peg you for the sort who likes to fuck fat blokes.”
Peace was supposed to come when he won a war. Instead, Harry spent his early twenties trapped in silence while the papers lied and told people he was off doing humanitarian work for the world. No one wants a hero who is drugged into stillness because they cannot escape their own demons.
People can’t handle the things that break Harry, they don’t want him fragile and lacking. They want him as he was when he stood in that hall and vanquished their darkest tormentor. They want a god and what they have is a fractured human.
He startles and shouts, “Malfoy!” Slipping against the tile in his shower and has to catch himself against the wall to avoid falling. “How the devil did you get here?”
One Harry could get addicted to, he discovers when Draco arches towards the deep, branding bites Harry puts into his easily bruised skin. “More,” Draco husks, as Harry sucks a dark lovebite into the skin at the bend between Draco’s leg and groin.
“Mummy is never late,” she swallows. Her big blue eyes overbright with upset, and he takes her small hand into his. A gesture meant to reassure her that he won’t let anything bad happen to her, and Audrey looks up at him with a sweet, trusting smile.
“So long as they don’t come up missing or dead, Potter, I don’t want to know what you mean by that.” Dudley—bastard that he is at times—is almost as loyal as Ron. Something that always manages to surprise Harry, even though Dudley’s been his trainer for years.
Draco brings Potter back to his flat. He’s not sure he could follow through with fucking Potter in his home where all the reminders of Teddy are. School books, toys, and things scattered—Draco can’t risk wanting all of that life with Potter, when Potter is in him.
Sitting in the cold examination room at his private Healer’s office, Draco stares down at the grey and black scan she handed him moments before. It moves with the flicker of life. A heartbeat Draco swears he can hear within himself. One that shakes his core with the sorrow of what this child will be born into—a broken home. With parents who couldn’t manage to communicate. A wretched mother and a bitter father.
After, when he’s sweaty and exhausted, he goes home to the flat he’s got in Greenwich. The one he settled on when Teddy was just over a year old and Andromeda’s broken heart finally gave her over to death. Grimmauld Place was a tomb— one best left undisturbed. So he’d decided on a semi-detached home off Humber Road.
“I think you’re too hurt to do this,” he protests as Potter flicks his wrist to lock the door of his private room.
The way he caresses Draco is akin to sex, and Draco is hard in his trousers when Pansy’s voice shocks him from the moment he’s sharing with Potter. “So which would you prefer, Potter?” She asks with a musical lilt, “A wet, willing fanny or a hard, slick prick?”
Tonight is no different as he joins Pansy at the usual corner in the back. Men approach them and he waits until one sparks enough want in him that he accepts. Only, Draco’s finding it difficult to choose this evening. He’s even finding it difficult to focus on what Pansy is saying. His mind is too preoccupied with Potter and his adopted son, Teddy, to focus on the gossip about that horrid cow Millicent.
Draco snorts at her but doesn’t reply. He starts fiddling with his martini glass with long, slender fingers. Delicate hands, Harry notices as he watches them move.
“The fuck he is,” Harry shouts, throat raw still from disuse these past few days. “That beefy idiot is my cousin and my trainer.” Then, after calming himself, he adds, “Have you looked at the guy? Sure, I bet he’s attractive to some, but he’s not my type.”
Teddy doesn’t give him the chance. He sighs as if he’s a disappointed adult and Harry’s the brat who was doing something he shouldn’t have. “I asked if you are taking me to the winter carnival?”
Harry missed parents night due to an out of town tournament, and Ron had covered that instead. Afterwards, all Ron had done was laugh anytime Harry enquired about Teddy’s new teacher. He half wonders if it’s Luna because she’s a bit strange and Ron always has a laugh about her. Though, he’s certain he’d remember if Luna was teaching children—Hermione would riot and it’s hard to miss when Hermione is up in arms over things.
“Potter,” Draco whispers—lump in his throat—as he takes a seat on Potter’s bed. Bolder than he would be if Potter were awake. “God,” he says, reaching out to brush gentle fingers through Potter’s unruly fringe.
Fetching Teddy from school is strange and thrilling. Draco stands, watching to make sure the smaller children go off with their guardians, and Harry doesn’t notice the fine suit he wears. He’s too busy recalling the way Draco had gone to his knees—looking up with those clear grey eyes as his pink lips stretched around the girth of Harry’s hard cock.
“Sharp cheekbones.” Again his eyes stare through Draco and Draco doesn’t know if Potter’s eyes are large or if it’s the lenses of his glasses making them appear larger. Either way, he finds them mesmerizing.
“Only one I’ve ever known,” Draco replies with a snort. “And I think it traumatised me enough, thank you. So, stop bringing that up.”
Potter’s ridiculously green eyes pin Draco, drilling into him with an intensity that makes him shiver with want and delight. “I like blonds,” Potter says with a cocky grin. One that makes Draco’s prick twitch in excitement.
Teddy doesn’t come to school for a few days so Draco makes a house visit—even though he’s been steadily trying to ignore Potter’s existence.
Potter lights a cigarette, sitting naked with his legs thrown over the edge of Draco’s bed. “I didn’t know you smoked?” Draco says, sitting up as best as he can when his body’s gone to jelly from the force of Potter’s lusts. He grins when he notices the bracelets of bruises in his wrists.
“Nothing too terrible,” Mrs Monroe assures when Draco asks after Audrey’s grandmother. “She’d let a cold get a little too bad—I think I’ve yelled at her enough for her to understand that she’s not as young as she once was.”
“Mr Malfoy said I had the best spelling out of the entire class,” Teddy shouts excitedly. Too loud in Harry’s ear, but he doesn’t chastise the small boy. Teddy’s too happy about being excellent at something, and Harry is proud of him for his accomplishment. “I asked him to take me out for ice cream since I did so well,” Teddy says.
Despite himself, Draco snorts, before he says. “You forget, Potter, of the two of us I was adept at Potions.” He affects an air of casual indifference as he shrugs. “It’s the same concept.”
Draco frowns. “Are you unable to get him there?” He glances around, “I’m sure you could send him by Floo if coming yourself is too difficult.”
“Just eat it, mate,” Potter tells him, biting into his own pizza with big pretty teeth. Draco fights rather hard to keep from imagining them pressing into his skin. He stares longer than socially acceptable and Potter shoots him a taunting grin. “Didn’t peg you as the domestic type, Malfoy. I was convinced you’d blow up my kitchen in an attempt to cook.”
Dudley nods in satisfaction when Harry finishes his drills with the magicked mannequins—without destroying them beyond use. “Guess my suggestion worked, Potter.” Dudley chuckles when Harry jogs over to him to accept the bottle of water Dudley has for him. “Today you didn’t wreck my fucking gym.”
He doesn’t even try to keep Teddy home when Ron says there’s a dinner at The Burrow that evening. Harry waves them off glad of the excuse to race to Malfoy’s posh flat.
Through his disgust, Draco approaches Theo. With the intent of welcoming this man to a land that will never be his.
Teddy’s frown is so deep he creates wrinkles in his young forehead—reminding Harry strongly of Remus.
“I don’t want you to meet.” Teddy’s voice is shrill, and Harry sets Teddy down. To better see his small face.
Three years didn’t erase them, and he watches as three years walks out of his office door. Draco’s one salvation gone—the way Pansy always warned Potter would go.
Now, as the children come rushing out of the doors—with teachers calling out for them to be careful and not run—he spies Teddy. At that moment his heart is full. Teddy’s wide smile is one full of joy and one that knows no suffering. So, despite tragedy, he is well adjusted and that makes Harry feel so incredibly happy.
Ron snorts. “Doubtful. Snakes might shed their skin, but they never change their colours.” When Harry doesn’t readily respond Ron sighs. “I don’t know what you want me to say, mate. I hate Malfoy, and there’s not much that will change that. But,” he adds with a thoughtful look, “I am willing to be civil and open to locating the real source of Teddy’s anxiety about school.
Surprisingly, Draco wears a gentle expression as he welcomes Teddy into the class. And Teddy has an embarrassed flush to his cheeks, but he doesn’t seem upset to be near Malfoy. Harry doesn’t have long to think about it because the door closes on him and from beyond the door he can hear Draco directing the class.
“Because I’m a shit teacher, you can go to school. You can learn and have fun in a class with other kids.” Harry believes he sounds reasonable. Teddy hanging limply over his wide shoulder means that Teddy doesn’t believe he’s being reasonable or fair. “Teddy, you liked Reception, yeah?”
Huffing, Harry drops one of the thick cushions onto the wooden floor of his flat before he whips out his wand. It’s a simple enough flick of his wrist that brings Teddy’s school bag sailing down from the upper floor.
“You’ll be mad, like Uncle Ron was,” Teddy shouts, and his voice bounces through the corridor due to the emptiness around them.
Potter’s smile turns teasing—a playfulness in the expression that Draco’s learning to appreciate. “No one is more annoying than you, Malfoy,” but he punctuates his words by capturing Draco’s mouth with a kiss. Making Draco wonder if he’s meant his words as a compliment.
“Got done.” Potter shrugs, his grin growing wider, sharper and Draco is caught before he can try to escape.
Draco wakes when sunlight shines over his closed eyelids. His body aches—remnants of a night spent at the mercy of Potter’s lust.
Potter who is suspiciously absent when he rolls over in his large bed. Finding it cold to the touch, and something in him mourns the loss of Potter’s heat.
“Mate,” he says, crouching to Teddy’s level. “Do you want to go back home?” The old flat isn’t sold yet, there is still time.
Draco thinks of all that he wants with Potter. Early morning kisses, breakfast with Teddy, evenings reading about Quidditch. There’s so much he wants. So much he doesn’t deserve.
“Why, why can’t I be taught at home?” Teddy tries the fake sniffle Harry doesn’t buy for an instant.
Indignant, Teddy stomps his small trainer covered foot. “No magic! That’s unfair during treasure hunts.”
