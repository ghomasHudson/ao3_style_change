The push and pull of the Hogwarts Express on the tracks serves as the sole comfort for Harry, who leans against the rattling compartment window. He sighs, it’s his last year and according to Hermione he should be excited about it because,
, is playing with the waistband of Harry’s pyjama bottoms and Harry stops his grinding against Draco’s thigh and grabs his wrist, sliding the other man’s hand under the waistline of his pants. Draco’s sharp intake of breath is a reward in of itself, and Harry is so distracted with marking Draco’s neck that he doesn’t realise he’s just given Draco permission to touch him until Draco’s long fingers are wrapped around his cock, pumping his length and sending shivers of pleasure down Harry’s spine.
Draco places a hand over Harry’s mouth. “Shhh,” he hisses. “It’s not – you aren’t responsible for me in that way.” He moves his hand away.
They find their pants and then Draco moves into bed and grabs a loose-limbed Harry up and puts his head against all the pillows by Draco’s headboard and tucks them both under the duvet.
Draco tilts his head and Harry takes a breath. How can he ask a simple question when there are layers upon layers of complicated history between them, he wonders, settling on: “Were you okay?”
Harry leans his head on the window, turning his eyes towards Dean and asks, “Why are you hanging out with him?”
“Draco’s not going to do anything to fuck up his probation,” Theo says, calmly. Arms crossing over his pale blue jumper. He’s got his poker face down, Harry thinks, and is relieved for it. Draco wanted to have a bit of fun on New Year’s, that’s way different than whatever it is Ron’s implying.
Blaise reaches out for the spoon before turning towards Harry. “Let’s not be rude here. Potter, would you like some?”
“Love isn’t about deserving,” Theo says. “Love is something you give, something you open yourself up to receive.”
Draco leans down, snorts the concentrated Pixie Dust spread across the mirror on the bed. “I’m serious, hit me. I can’t feel a thing,” he says, voice chiming with breathy laughter. “Hit me.”
Look. You broke my nose that same year but I don't see you apologising about that. And you knew what you were doing, I however, did not.
Harry slowly slides himself into Draco’s inviting heat and the two men groan in unison. Harry breathes long and hard, focusing on calming himself down. “Jesus, you feel amazing, Draco.”
“Want to suck you,” Draco says, eyes darkened with lust. Harry swallows, his heart a hummingbird in his chest. Draco’s never wanted to do this before. Once, Harry had asked and when Draco recoiled away from him, Harry had assumed it simply wasn’t his cup of tea which was fine, just fine – even if at the time, it had felt too much like rejection. It wasn’t even about his lack of want, it was the way he looked sick with the thought, as if the idea of intimacy with Harry was a glass-shattered act that made Draco bleed with regret.
When Draco comes, his legs are wrapped around Harry’s hips. His head and eyes are rolled back from the pleasure that has him convulsing around Harry’s cock, seducing one of the most intense orgasms Harry’s ever had out of him. Harry feels overcome by it, something warm and soothing swelling in his chest as he settles atop Draco.
“Can I kiss you?” Harry asks, brushing a strand of blond hair behind Draco’s ear – he’s cut it again, under his chin. It suits him, Harry thinks.
Malfoy’s tone irks Harry, making him take a deep breath in order to steady himself. “Not if you let me bum one.”
God, I hope today is over soon. I’m expected to be at the ministry for some stupid memorial service and then I’m expected to be at some stupid fucking gala and event and it’s going to be a month of shaking hands and meeting nameless faces and the entire wizarding world looking forward to meeting their boy wonder, saviour of the bloody Wizarding world but I don’t want to be doing any of this.
Harry snorts. “I don’t fucking know, but it means you can sin as much as you want, y’know? ‘Cos Jesus has already died for your sins, so, like – what’s the point of him dying if you don’t sin a little?”
“Concentrated Pixie Dust,” Draco explains, hand still on Harry. He starts rubbing against Harry’s scar with soothing little strokes that help Harry settle down on the bed next to him with ease. “You don’t have to, it’s just – it’s the new year and this is a bit of a tradition for me and Pans, you see.”
They smoke in relative silence and Harry lets his mind wander back to his friends. His pulse quickens and suddenly everything is off-kilter and weird, this whole situation is fucking weird, him and Malfoy being able to share a relatively peaceful silence is weird. Where did their animosity go, did it just ooze out of them after suffering through a trauma-packed war?
Malfoy laugh is right by his ear, shoulder leaning into Harry as Parkinson goes on to say, “You were right, Draco, he
Harry hesitates, only making his way towards Malfoy after the other man lifts a blond eyebrow in challenge.
“Only when you deserve it,” Draco says, twirling his wrist, spinning the wine in his hand around in its glass.
Harry shrugs and takes the Firewhiskey from her, throws it back and chugs it down, taking deep gulps that burn the back of his throat in all the right ways. When he’s done, he wipes the moisture from his lips and hands the bottle back to her. Parkinson is smiling at him, all cat-like and predatory, and Harry hates that he knows it must mean he’s amused her.
Draco keeps coming over to Harry’s, and he stops trying to initiate sex he so obviously isn’t ready to have. Instead, he brings gifts in the form of snacks for them to try and food for them to cook together.
“There isn’t something wrong with me, I’m not broken,” Draco whispers, kiss-swollen lips turned into a harsh frown.
Draco lets out a breath and is open with his laughter. “Yes,” he says, leaning in closer to Harry. He takes in another deep breath, letting it out slowly. “Harry?”
“You’re not going to make a big deal of this, are you?” Draco drawls, white eyebrow quirked up, eyes wide with what Harry thinks is panic.
Silver would look good against your complexion, because you’re so pale. I remember the ring you always wore in school, it brought out how long your fingers are, made them look all delicate. If you wouldn’t get a piercing on your face then...where would you get it?
Harry’s mind spins before settling, falling down a ladder and into conclusion: Draco may never tell him more than this, and it’s not his right to know. Rodolphus Lestrange died in Azkaban a year after the war, which keeps Harry’s hands clean. He won’t ask if his parents knew, he won’t ask if anyone else knows. There are a lot of things Harry won’t do. Memories that hurt him to think about click into place, and there is an understanding that settles deep in his conscious mind.
There is a part of him that wonders if perhaps this monster’s teeth would be stained red, if blood would seep from its gums the way Draco’s chest once bled through him and onto the dirty lavatory floor. Sometimes, it feels like Harry’s bleeding out. Sometimes, when Harry dreams of Sectumsempra, it’s himself he sees on that floor, and himself who stands above him, wand pointed with sharpened determination.
“Yes, Mr. Potter. She’s being treated in St. Mungo’s as we speak,” McGonagall’s voice shakes, she sounds pained. “Mr. Malfoy has informed us that she’d gotten the narcotics from you. Ms. Parkinson’s statement concurs with Mr. Malfoy’s claims.”
Harry squeezes Draco’s foot harder, only loosening his grip when Draco jerks back and whispers “ow,” scooting closer to Harry then, leaning into his space.
Malfoy just shakes his head at her, biting back his smile as he takes a spliff from his pocket, putting it to his mouth, and lighting it. Harry watches him with hazy vision, the whiskey smoothing out his senses.
Draco comes inside him, he comes onto both their stomachs and Harry keeps chanting the other man’s name, kissing him deep, pulling him into a tight embrace.
“Mmm, that was nice,” Draco mumbles into his ear, sometime later. Harry’s still on top of him, inside him, around him, but Draco doesn’t seem to mind, plays with Harry’s hair and brushes the sweat loosened curls out of Harry’s face. “I needed that.”
Draco’s friends do fuck off eventually, whispering to each other and making bedroom eyes at one another that makes it rather obvious what they’re fucking off to go do. Now, it’s just Harry and Draco and the drugs.
“There’s a part of it that goes —” Draco takes a deep breath, as if he’s preparing to say something of great importance. “You can fuck anyone—but with whom can you sit in water?”
“I just don’t understand why you won’t come home,” Ron’s voice is tight, his posture too stiff. Harry wonders if Ginny told Ron what he’d said, but the thing is, Ginny and Ron haven’t spoken more than two words to each other since her birthday party in August. They'd gotten into a huge fight about something or the other, it’s hard for Harry to keep the facts straight and he feels bad making Hermione repeat herself.
Harry leaves to fetch Draco some water from the downstairs kitchen tap, before remembering that Hermione had gotten him a Brita filter weeks ago and had been nagging Harry to use it more often, citing
The third time Harry wonders what Draco tastes like, its eighth year and they haven’t spoken a word to each other since the start of the term four months ago. Now there’s Harry lounging on the sofa and Malfoy on the chair by the hearth. The only sound between them is the crackling ember of firewood. Harry stares and his eyes drift and Malfoy wets his lips but never meets Harry’s gaze.
“Please, baby. Please,” Harry says, and he knows he’s asking for so much right now. Knows that his request is complex, heavy, confusing. He tries to find the words to express all that he’s asking for, but they stay in the haze of his mind, swirling around and taunting him.
“I didn’t cry with him,” Draco says, lips turning down into a frown, eyes staring off to the side. “I thought – I thought it wouldn’t happen again, with you.”
“Need the room do you, Potter?” Draco juts out his bruised chin towards him. “Best leave you to it then.”
“You’re the one who lives with a Death Eater–” Ron begins, after Harry’s opened the door, pushing past him and only stopping short once he’s taken in the sight before him.
Hope, the treacherous thing, still clings to his lungs and fills his chest with the wish that this all end differently than it’s going to.
Harry scoffs, feeling his shoulders jump with mirth. Draco moves his head, finding his silk pillow, and resting against it, body turned towards Harry.
Harry kisses him, because he can taste now, because he’s wanted to know what Draco tastes like for so long and now, he knows, and he never wants to forget. Harry finds a rhythm that suits him, loves the feeling of Draco clawing at his back, loves the way Draco is thrusting up to meet him, loves the way Draco is biting up into his neck, kissing at Harry’s jaw.
“Except respect my boundaries?” Draco reaches for the cupboard, the one that has the salad dressing Pansy likes. “You hate him.”
Also, get this. Tom was an orphan (like me) and lived in the Muggle word before Hogwarts (also like me). Truth or Dare
“Aren’t you cold?” Draco asks, eyes watching Cher on screen as she’s held at gunpoint. The movie is a happy one, but Harry forgot about this part. She’s robbed and the scary bit is over almost as quickly as it started. “Without a shirt on.”
“Alright,” interrupts Seamus. “We’re jus’ trynna play a simple game. Let’s play the bloody game already, yeah?”
“The first step to healing is admitting that something is wrong,” Luna nods sympathetically before adding, “You’re not broken, Harry. You don’t need to be fixed.”
Harry’s breath hitches. No one has ever asked before. The only man that touched his scar didn’t ask; made him burn with the violation of his body.
a homophobe! Actually, I'm, well, I'm Bi. I haven't told anyone else yet, I've just started to accept this about myself. I think it's brave what you did in your last letter, coming out to me before knowing if I would react well. I want to tell my friends, but I'm still nervous about it. It's not that I don't think they'd accept me, I'm sure they would - but, I still can't say it aloud, which is probably why I'm telling you in a letter instead.
With Dumbledore, it sort of makes sense though. He did the right thing, or what he believed was the right thing, but the worst part was the people who became collateral damage. Sometimes, I wonder if that collateral damage is even justifiable? Should I try and justify what he did
Malfoy moves his hands now too, both moving underneath Harry’s jumper — one going to slither up his back and the other slowly inching up from his abdomen to his chest, running his hands through Harry’s chest hair before slowly brushing against Harry’s pert nipple, making them both gasp at the sensation. “Hot,” Draco swallows and licks his lips. “You’re so intense.”
Slowly, with more care than he was expecting, Draco begins to thrust into him. He’s oiled up his cock and it’s not an uncomfortable burning sensation, but it does burn, and it does leave Harry feeling stretched — only the heat inside him is quickly reaching a fever pitch, and his breath is coming out ragged as he focuses on his breathing with a tight grip on Draco’s biceps.
He lights candles in his bedroom, enchants them to float around the canopy of his bed, lays rose petals across his white sheets and feels foolish as he does so, just a bit, wondering if it’s too much. His heart is full, and he feels turned inside out. Love, what a curious thing. Tender, like a wound. Precious, like hope.
There is something wholly more intimate about Draco nuzzling into him, seeking his warmth, without pretence – Harry wonders if Draco can feel the spike in his heartbeat and then decides it’s alright, if he can.
“I didn’t even say I wasn’t going. I said I was thinking about it.” Harry grunts out, frustration and exhaustion present in his tone and stance, shoulders dipped forward with resent.
Parkinson’s lingerie set is all lace and Harry can’t help himself from looking at her body and admiring the view. Malfoy nudges him with the bottle, but his eyes are reserved for Parkinson, who’s got a sinister smirk splayed across her lips as she dresses.
that’s exactly what Harry wanted to hear, he sits up then and takes his hand off Draco’s cock. “Look at me,” he pleads when Harry breaks eye contact.
Putting the spliff in his mouth, Draco starts to inhale as his hands move to Harry’s hips. Harry takes the spliff out of his mouth, kissing Draco and inhaling the smoke he exhaled into Harry’s mouth.
Draco returns the favour by fingering Harry and sucking him off at the same time, completely overwhelming his senses, sending him into overdrive all the same. Harry comes with three fingers inside him and Draco’s grey-rimmed eyes staring up at him with lust and something else that Harry can’t quite put his finger on.
. I knew it would do something bad, I'm not stupid. I just - I didn't think. It was stupid. I shouldn't have been using a spell I didn't know, and I shouldn't have just brushed it to the side like that. For that, I am sorry.
When Harry looks back at Draco after having shared a kiss with Blaise his eyes are hot, and his smile is loose and warm. Harry wants Draco to be angry about it, doesn’t understand why completely but knows without a shadow of a doubt what he wants: for Draco’s friends to fuck off and leave him alone with Draco; for Draco to fuck him quick, hard, and rough with fury-filled intensity.
Being high on acid is like being high on weed, but so much better. Harry’s brain is tingling, things are not necessarily moving, but they are sort of, well, every time he blinks there’s these geometric shapes that appear in his mind’s eye which he finds to be pretty fucking cool — sometimes he can see them with his eyes open, and the world looks brighter because of it.
“Baby, please, tell me what’s wrong,” Harry asks, lifting himself up, body pressing into Draco. He’s still hard inside him and Draco’s own desire sits at aroused attention in the space between their bodies. “Who did this to you?” Harry places Draco’s head between his calloused hands. “I’ll kill them,” he says, and it’s not an empty threat. The first time he killed a man he was eleven. The second, seventeen. Harry presses the hands that burned a man to death and uses them to pull Draco to him, to kiss him. “I’ll kill whoever did this to you.”
With a hand in Draco’s white-blond hair, he fucks up into his wet, velvety mouth. All Draco has to do is massage his balls a bit, run one finger teasingly across his rim and he’s coming embarrassingly quick. Draco swallows him all down and doesn’t stop until Harry tugs his hair, pulling Draco off his sensitive cock, admiring the trail of sweat and spunk that’s attached itself to his pretty plump lips.
Harry wants so badly to hear him beg for it, for Draco to show some semblance of desperation – for him to show Harry that he was never alone in this.
“Was there anyone else?” Harry asks, looking at Draco’s hands, at how they sit so close to his lap, twiddling – noticing the way Draco picks at the cuticles on his thumb.
“Please,” Draco sobs, and Harry takes him deeper. “Need to feel you inside me, I want to come with you inside me.”
Theo stops chopping the pepper, the muscle in his jaw works. Draco moves towards him, leans his head against his friend. Their temples touch.
, especially with Ron and Hermione making googly eyes at one another and presently ignoring Harry — either intentionally or not, he’s unsure.
The mystery man, who Harry now realises is Theodore Nott, grabs Draco’s hand and drags him over to the floor where everyone’s sat around a large gauntlet.
And when Draco is begging so sweetly, calling Harry baby in his posh voice, broken with pleasure, who is Harry to deny him? He slides another finger into Draco’s tight heat, eyes on the other man’s hooded gaze. Harry bites his lips, drinking in the sight of debauchery before him – Draco with his hand on Harry’s own, with his back arched, with his hips thrusting to the pace Harry’s fingers have set.
“You know I’m Head Boy, right? This is some serious shit, not just the spliffs everyone’s been getting from Neville.”
Harry clenches the muscle in his stomach, lifting himself up, hands still on Draco’s thighs. He flips their positions with ease, smiling down at Draco whose chest shakes with laughter. Harry licks his lips, kisses down Draco’s neck, biting, sucking, leaving his mark, hands sliding up his thigh, moving it around his waist. Harry grinds down onto Draco, groaning when his thrusts are met with Draco’s equal enthusiasm.
Harry kisses him, slow, long, and hard, before thrusting up just a little bit. Draco bites down a moan, hips jerking just a bit. “You can move.”
I think it’s sweet that you have a crush on Richard, he sounds like a nice bloke. But, wouldn’t the Statute get in the way of anything meaningful? Maybe, if he knew about you the way I do, he’d be hurt at first - that you joined a group that wanted to cause his demise. But maybe, just maybe, he’d also see that your heart is in the right place. You’re obviously trying to be better than you once were, and you’re easy to talk to (er, write to) and you have such an interesting outlook on the world. Maybe, he’ll see that too and think - wow, he’s kind of incredible. Maybe.
Harry stops, gasps, opens his mouth to moan, makes eye contact with Draco and thrusts into his hand before moving his own fingers towards the waistband of Draco’s pants.
Draco bristles and frowns. “No,” he says. He turns away then, his face pinched, and Harry knows he’s lost him to the thunderstorm that never stops raining inside the world of his mind.
“Hit me.” Draco says. He’s laughing so hard, and Harry feels elated at the sound of it. It’s the best thing he’s ever heard. Ever.
, Harry thinks, Draco is the sweetest shade of red and looks so good he wants to devour him. Wants to taste and to touch and to
idea.” The two girls giggle into the space they share together, rising to their feet with interlocked hands and heading up towards the staircase as well.
“Perhaps,” says Draco, adjusting his trousers. Harry remains on the bed next to him naked. “If you will have me at my leisure.”
Also, Ginny says that you should reach out. Blaise told her about that fight you two had. Blaise is really private, like you said, so she didn’t tell me about what you two fought about - but I think he’s ready to move past it. At least, according to her, he sounds like he is. Reach out to your friend, Draco. You’re not a coward because you’re scared, but you might lose someone you care about (and who obviously still cares about you too) if you keep hesitating.
Hermione, brilliant witch that she is, seems to get the hint and instead switches the subject to coordinating nights to study together. “It’s very important that we revise as much as we can, we missed out on an entire year of studying and it’s been so long since Sixth Year,” she says this all with tight shoulders and a furrow in her brows that lets those around her know she’s very, very serious. Harry just nods along.
Harry complies, sliding his finger out of Draco, leaving only the tip in. Grabbing the bottle of lube, still open next to him and squeezing more of the cool liquid onto his fingers, circling Draco’s hole gently, pushing back in with leisure, watching as Draco’s head tilts back on his pillow, enjoying the view as he rolls his body with pleasure.
“Remember when we broke up? After eighth year?” Ron asks, lifting up her hand, loosely interlocking their fingers. “You said, I had to be my own person and that you needed to be your own person too.”
Harry’s head is thick with honey and lust and cotton, and he wants so badly to be inside Draco, needs to feel it right now.
Harry takes a shaky breath, “You said,” he starts and then takes another breath. He swallows and tries again, “You said, I just need to say it and I’d hear it back.”
Harry kisses him and pours his desperation and desire into it; hopes Draco can feel it because Harry feels like he’s being strangled half to death with it. Draco’s hands are on his hips and he’s pulling Harry into him and rutting up against his still clothed prick.
“Someone says they saw you sneaking off with Malfoy the other night,” Hermione says, arms crossed over her red jumper.
Draco throws his head back and laughs, hearty and real, shaking his head. “It’s alright.” He rises into a sitting position, release still sticky across his stomach and chest. “I bet you want a taste, though.”
Fuck, I want to, please fuck.” Harry’s blubbering but he feels like he might cry if something doesn’t happen between them. Fuck, Malfoy — Draco, his mind supplies, is tugging at Harry’s hair just the way he likes, not that he knew he liked that, but he does now. He likes it a lot, actually.
Dean’s sitting on the cobblestone sill, of all people, in Harry’s usual spot, Draco sat up next to him, cigarette between his two fingers. Harry blinks, clenches his fists, swallows down the bile in his throat. Dean is touching Draco, touching his face, touching the bruises Harry had left him with. Harry wants to break his fingers, push him away from Draco.
Hermione has rarely ever done just that, she is always in motion, but sometimes it feels just like running. Sometimes it feels like she keeps it moving, so that she doesn’t have to sit in everything that weighs down on her chest like a ten-ton boulder.
“I find it useless to hate people who are flawed.” Luna’s feet are bare on the cold forest floor, Harry wonders if she’s cast a warming charm on herself. “Besides, by the end of it, he was just trying to get by. Like the rest of us.”
By the time he’s changed into his joggers and jumper Malfoy’s already made room for Harry next to him. Harry tries to suppress the half smile that threatens to overtake his features. He thinks he’s doing a pretty bad job of it, but it doesn’t really matter that much considering Malfoy has the ghost of a smile on his own lips.
, Harry tells himself. Draco doesn’t want to be touched right now, that much is clear. Harry can respect that.
Harry has never liked cooking much, preferring instead to order takeout if only to avoid the annoyance of washing his own dishes. He knows he could just use magic to clean everything, but there is a tiny part of him that twitches with the need to use his hands, that is irked by the processes of making himself a meal.
Draco visits him regularly, far more regularly than Harry had anticipated, and each time he gives himself away Harry gathers the fractured bits and pieces like they’re gold, hoping one day to have enough to start forming a picture.
4. Draco's just had a client confess to him that they have feelings for him - which is something that really does happen in the real sex work world. He's trying his best to handle it gently and this is his way of achieving that.
Harry stares, eyes never quite adjusting to sight without his glasses, the edges around him blurry. Draco, however, stands in stark clarity within his vision. In the yellow glow, under the soft glow of candles floating all around them, Draco’s head shines with a halo of light behind his head.
Harry wants to kiss him, wants to slide their tongues together, wants to feel the hot puff of his breath against his face, but Draco’s looked away – and Harry’s heart skips too many beats that by the time he’s regained his composure Harry’s been dragged to the bar for another round of shots and Draco’s saying his goodbyes.
Speaking of death, I know what you mean. I’m not sure if your mum ever told you but I really did die that day in the forest. She lied to Voldemort about it, it’s all a lot to get into right now. What matters is, I also had my own little dance with Death. There was a moment where I had a choice, to leave and go Beyond or stay and continue to “fight the good fight.” I almost didn’t come back.
Harry grinds his own hard prick into him, and starts kissing down Draco’s neck, sucking, and biting, before moving to his chest and licking up one of his scars. Draco lets out the most delicious little mewl, and Harry feels bolder as he takes a marred nipple into his mouth, sucking on it gently, palming Draco’s rock-hard cock.
Harry turns his body towards Draco fully now, one arm spreading across the backrest while the other moves to squeeze the foot Draco has laid against his thigh. “Yes?” He says, because to Harry it feels rather obvious, especially now – the dinners, the cooking together, the movies afterwards.
“Do you see, mother?” Malfoy whimpers, lower lip trembling. “Look what he’s done.” Malfoy’s voice cracks. "How he treats me."
Draco’s quiet for so long Harry worries he’s gone to sleep. “You’re pretending,” he says eventually. “We promised not to pretend.”
Luna hums, reaching a hand towards the mother Thestral, softly petting its head. “Yes, I suppose but –” Luna turns her wide eyes towards him, looking right through him. “– of the two of us, only one of us has seen him cry before.”
“Yeah,” Harry says, but he does not jump to another topic. Neither does Draco, instead, they lay in silence. The soft sound of the phone static noise is the only comfort between them.
About Hermione, yes she is still living with me. Send her a letter to the return address you see on this one, I asked and she’s willing to accept a letter from you. Are you going to apologise? Word of advice, she’s a woman of action and not one who accepts empty words or shallow promises. You’re going to have to really prove to her you’re trying to change.
Draco leans down, snorts the concentrated Pixie Dust spread across the mirror on the bed. “I’m serious, hit me. I can’t feel a thing,” he says, voice chiming with breathy laughter. “Hit me.”
By the way, your tattoo looks amazing. The linework and shading are both incredible. I also got a tattoo recently, in honour of Sirius and Remus. Check out the polaroid I included. The moon is for Remus, and the Grim-looking dog is for Sirius, I also included his constellation.
Harry pushes Malfoy off him, moving past the others in the room who are muttering about the appropriate course of action and other shit that he really doesn’t think is all that important right now. Harry runs up the steps, heads back to his room.
Harry likes men, fine he can admit it to himself now. He likes men and wants to touch and taste and feel. He wants, desperately, and he can – anyone would be willing. From Michael Corner to Justin Finch-Fletchy, Harry just has to return their heated stares with an arched eyebrow and a soft smirk, and he can touch and taste and feel all he wants to. But – and this is the part that makes him so angry with himself – he wants to touch and taste and feel Malfoy against him. Malfoy, whose gaze is never heated, whose eyes are always ice cold and chilling, is the one he’s curious about. Malfoy is the one he wants to taste, call it a desire for hate sex but he wants it, and he hates that he wants it, and he hates that he wants things he can never have.
“What do you do when you’re not here?” Harry asks from across the kitchen one night, having wondered after Draco and his life outside of Harry’s home on more than one occasion.
After a while, after Parkinson’s left for her little rendezvous in London, Malfoy asks, “Won’t your girlfriend mind? That you’ve been looking at other girls who are practically naked, I mean.”
Draco clenches around him, letting out a wail of pleasure as he comes on his and Harry’s stomach. Harry’s ears ring as Draco convulses, clenching exquisitely tight around Harry’s cock. Harry buries himself deep inside Draco, thrusting rapidly as he begins to come.
Harry doesn’t know when he makes it over to Draco, has no clue when he grabs onto the other man’s hips, all he knows is that he’s there and he’s touching
I don’t think Ginny’s that interested in him, I’ll give her the heads up though, thanks for your input.
Harry sits in Draco’s spot, glad suddenly that he’s claimed it instead of having to see Dean sit here. He hands back the spliff to Dean, who has to relight it.
“Honestly, I don’t even think it’s about worthiness, I think it’s about – the circumstances. I think we’re allowed to move on, if we want to.”
Harry takes a long drag from his cigarette. “Don’t pretend to know me,” he says, leaning his head back and exhaling the smoke in his lungs.
Draco smiles slow and predatory, like he’s won something. “Yes, alright. Whatever you want, darling.”
Later, through the residual tingle of their love making, after Harry’s gone and wet a flannel to clean Draco up, they lay in bed together, Harry with his arms around Draco, Draco with his face pressed into Harry’s chest.
And then, with those words ringing in his ear, Draco thrusting into him at just the right angle, Harry’s mouth against Draco’s scarred skin, Harry comes with a loud moan. He’s coming and coming, hard, and his brain is swimming, filled with the thickness of honey and syrup, and he’s seeing white in his vision — Harry’s never come this hard in his life and wants so badly to see Draco come now; his legs tightening around Draco’s waist as he rides out the high from his orgasm. Draco comes a few moments later, with a deep groan and his hand in Harry’s hair and mouth at Harry’s jaw.
Draco had been nervous until the very last minute, but then it came time for him to go undercover and play nice and he had been brilliant. His face an unbreachable mask of apathy as his monotone voice earned the trust of those he would soon betray.
Harry touches up at his split lip, worries that Theo’s going to do something and give himself and everyone else away.
“Of fucking course,” Harry growls. “You’d be like this –” He slowly pulls out, thrusting back in deeply. “– so, fucking –” Another thrust, torturously slow and deep. “–
About my whole skin thing, so you noticed it shining in the sun, did you? I’m definitely reading into that. Kidding. Don’t worry, Draco, I also had my moments. I mean, I have eyes too. It’s weird, but sometimes the people you dislike can also catch your attention. I blame puberty, haha. Your hair was always gleaming in the sun, I couldn’t help but notice that. Speaking of eyes, I always noticed yours.
“Not if this is how sex with me makes you,” Harry tells him, feeling his body shiver. He wonders when he got cold, when the chill started to settle in his bones.
Draco touches Harry’s scar, softly, with a gentle slide of his fingers, outlining the lightning bolt from where it cuts into his eyebrow and up towards his hairline.
Hermione said you and her have gotten on great through your letters. Sometimes I think you two are talking more than you and me. Don’t forget about me, haha. She mentioned you’re working at a Muggle cafe, how’d that happen?
Hermione’s been appointed Head Girl alongside Ron who’s been appointed the position of Head Boy. The title had originally been meant for Harry, but he had refused the weight of its responsibility — he was no hero, he was just a boy. He hadn’t done anything to
“With whom can you sit in water?” Draco mumbled, phone screen illuminating his tired face. “With whom can you sit in silence?”
They eat dinner and discuss the movies currently playing at the cinema, debating which ones they both agree sound interesting enough to watch. Draco’s eyes shine with what Harry guesses is excitement. After dinner they sprawl out on the couch, Draco taking up all the space as he drapes himself across the plush leather, exiling Harry to the other corner. They turn on the telly and watch the new gameshow, Big Brother, that’s just begun airing on Channel 4.
Ok first of all, it's 2008 but they got 2021 social media bc...if you were around on twitter back in the day - those were the damn dark ages and we ain't goin back!
Draco’s lip twitches, he lets out a sweet breath, cheeks turning the sweetest shade of red. He looks away but doesn’t try to hide his face. “You,” he begins, finger trailing up Harry’s forearm, outlining patterns on his bicep. “You’re quite handsome.”
Harry felt wide awake and wondered how long it had been but found he didn’t really care that much to know. Lifting himself up, he grabbed at the pillow by Malfoy’s feet and then laid back down after fluffing the pillow and burying his head into the smooth, silky thing. It smelled of lavender and myrrh, like Malfoy.
Harry’s head is swimming with drink, lust, and endless desire when he expects to meet the hot skin of Malfoy’s chest. Instead, he feels the cool air of the night. Malfoy’s long fingers dig harshly into his shoulders, pushing him up.
“Did it make you feel good? To fuck someone who hates you. To know that I hated you so much but still couldn’t resist.”
Harry hits him, Draco falls onto the bed with the force of it. Draco’s laugh sharpens, he’s gasping with it. “Hit me,” Harry says, giggling at Draco’s high-induced mirth.
“You are.” Ron puts down the flannel, wraps his arms around Hermione. “Who gets to decide who’s worthy of forgiveness anyway?”
Harry sits up, moving Malfoy’s sprawled legs off the windowsill and sits next to the other man. “Jesus Christ. He died for our sins,” explains Harry. “You’ve never heard of him?”
Harry leans in slowly, let’s Draco meet him in the middle, bringing their lips together in a soft greeting. In a warm hello. Harry cups Draco’s jaw, tilts his head, deepening the kiss with a lick at the other man’s bottom lip.
That’s another thing I do when I get antsy, I go get a tattoo or piercing and everything feels OK again, even if it’s just for a while.
, he says over and again. Harry’s body shakes with the overwhelming draw of it, with the burning heat that boils under his skin, turning him raw, burning his doubt away. Malfoy wants him and Harry finds a pleasure that twists his gut in the fact that Malfoy, someone who had hated him so vehemently, wants him just as desperately.
Harry lets out a huff of air that quickly turns into a gasp at the feel of Draco’s hand palming him through his trousers. They kiss and it’s wet and messy and everything Harry needs right now. Draco keeps palming Harry’s crotch, seeming to relish in the noises Harry keeps making.
Then, Harry slips his hand into Draco’s pants, sliding down slowly, brushing against trimmed thick hair and reaching for Draco’s leaking cock. It’s heavy in his hand and Harry has to bite his lip, closing his eyes, because for a second, it’s all too much — Draco Malfoy’s prick is in his hand, another man, fuck, Harry’s touching another man and that other man is Draco fucking Malfoy. He has to breathe because he doesn’t want to come, he wants to wait. He wants to see what Draco looks like when Harry touches him.
“I have,” Harry begins, trying to breathe through the way his bedroom spins.  “I have a sober-up potion.”
“I have one,” says Harry, eyes on Draco’s downturned lips — fists on his hips, grey eyes distant. “One of those boxes that play pictures with sound.”
, I fucking know why. I’m not, it’s – please don’t touch me,” he says when Harry reaches out a hand. Harry’s fingertips curl in on themselves as he pulls away.
“Not really,” Harry says, eyes on Draco, watching the hues of blue highlight the silhouette of his sharp face. “I think I run hot.”
Harry wants to sleep but doesn’t know if he can because he’s most definitely coming down from his high, and it’s weird settling into sobriety, but Draco tells him to close his eyes even if he isn’t planning on sleeping and just relax.
Harry watches the back of Draco’s head as he leans into Blaise, they whisper back and forth for a few seconds, Blaise’s face only grows more sombre. Harry watches Draco leave. Draco does not look back at him.
Draco sits up, bringing his kiss-swollen lips to the scar at Harry’s sternum, trailing his lips lower, in a devotion Harry hadn’t expected.
Draco lets out a sharp breath, one that Harry knows is followed by the ghost of a smile, a quirk of Draco’s he’s becoming quite familiar with.
“I’m studying for my potions mastery,” Draco tells him, light-grey eyes on the marker of a young boy turned man’s destiny. He moves his hand into Harry’s tight curls. “Is this okay?”
“Maybe, yeah,” Harry says, eyes on Draco’s sweat-shined chest, licking his lips as he trails his eyes lower.
“Draco…” Harry looks up towards heaven, another deep breath entering his lungs, as he finds purchase of his Gryffindor courage.
“That’s not true, Neville still talks to you,” Luna points out, pulling up the sleeves of her pink jumper. “Besides, I don’t really care that you’re sleeping with Draco Malfoy.”
they came to the consensus that a bit of romance is allowed, it is their one-year anniversary after all. But, beyond that, Draco needed Harry to act with an assuredness that would allow him to follow suit. Draco needs Harry to be brave, unafraid of hurting him, to not make it known whether he felt nervous.
“What kind of movies do you like?” Harry asks, rising and gesturing for Draco to follow him into his sitting room. It’s odd, he thinks, that he’s taken Draco in different parts of his house but never shown him around.
Draco wears a three-piece suit, his hair has been cut since the last time Harry saw him, and he stands rigid, sharp features turned into a scowl at the threshold of Harry’s broken home.
Harry looks as breathtakingly handsome as ever, his gold jewelry shimmers in the light. He has his hands tucked into the pockets of his denims as he watches Draco approach.
Draco stills suddenly, and his hands slide to his side, body trembling. Harry feels a wetness drip onto his skin, his mind registering distantly that Draco is crying – causing something in Harry’s chest to ache at the sound of Draco pulling in a short breath.
Harry can’t help but feel a little smug. The monster in his chest, the one he’s made a bit of peace with, the one he had told Draco about once (which had earned a hearty laugh from the blond) purrs happily in his chest. Mostly though, he feels the same relief Draco must be feeling – or, perhaps, it’s a different kind of relief. Perhaps this relief comes from the clarity of them both being on the same page.
Draco’s pushing down his pants and Harry summons the little phial of oil they normally use, wordlessly and wandlessly. He smirks down at Draco who stares him down with one of the most heated gazes he’s ever seen; he knows how much it turns Draco on when Harry does wandless magic.
Draco lays his head against Harry’s, handing him the spliff and moving his hand to the top of Harry’s thigh, rubbing soft circles with his thumb. “You’re too obvious.”
for us not to let her bring him around?” Hermione tilts her head, considering. “Is it fair of me to make her choose? To say, you’re being a bad friend to me if you bring him around?”
When Harry comes, it’s long and hard, with a tight grip on his white sex-drenched sheets, with Draco’s firm yet comforting hold on his hips.
“Fuck, I need –” Harry has no idea how to ask for what he needs but knows that he needs it now more than anything. “You.”
, filling with the type of heat that makes you sweat in the back of your knees and suffocates the room. People are taking off their robes, Draco’s tied back his hair, his cheeks glisten with sweat that highlights his sharp cheekbones.
Harry fingers him slowly and Draco thrusts down onto his finger, keening with an enthusiasm Harry had never seen before. “More,” Draco orders. “Fuck, please.”
Your letters were always the highlight of my week, my night, my whenever the fuck. It was nice. Your outlook on the world made me feel less lonely. Do you know what that’s like? To have the whole world watching you, saying they love you - but knowing not a single person truly means it. Yeah, I have Ron and Hermione, but do you know we’ve never told each other that we love one another? They’re both very much the type of people who are all about show and not tell. But, imagine living your whole life as an orphan who was kept in a fucking cupboard for the first 11 years of their life and then every year since I turned 11 up until right before I turned 18 I was being chased by the egomaniac who orphaned me.
“Come here,” Draco rasps, pulling Harry close to him and running his hands through his curls, scratching at his scalp the way Harry likes. He snakes an arm possessively around Draco, leg draped in between his thighs. “I love you,” Draco whispers. “Remember that.”
Harry watches as Draco takes a wet flannel and cleans him up. His heart is so full, and he reaches up towards Draco, pulling him down for a sloppy kiss that makes Draco laugh and pull away.
Nott gasps, Harry smirks, but then Draco is leaning down and into Nott and the dark-haired boy is howling with pleasure. “It’s funny because that’s what you
Parkinson and Zabini join the fray easily enough but Goyle and someone else who he can’t remember is standing beside Draco, observing everything from a distance. The mystery man has dark, curly hair and brown eyes that look around the room with an unsettling amount of boredom.
follow me around for the rest of my life but...maybe, I can learn how to move through them instead of becoming overwhelmed by them.
The front door unlocks, the familiar echo of Pansy’s rattling keychain the only sound between them. Draco turns, Pansy stands with a pack of Heineken in hand, smiling sheepishly at Draco. Her maroon lipstick makes her look more mischievous than she truly is.
“I knew it!” Seamus yelps with a hand to the floor in front of him. “I knew you were a ponce, Malfoy.”
“I heard you’ve been smoking spliffs with Draco bloody Malfoy of all people,” Ron says, arms crossed over his Weasley knit jumper. They’re sat in the common room by the fire; they’re supposed to be studying but Hermione’s the only one who’s actually making any kind of effort to revise tonight.
Ron leads Hermione out, slamming the door behind him. Harry moves to sit on his bed but then decides to sit on Draco’s instead, kicking off his trainers and laying down into the comforting scent of lavender and myrrh.
“Stay,” Harry says, rising, taking tentative steps towards Draco. He doesn’t want to see Draco walk away, doesn’t want Draco to leave him, and doesn't want either of them to be alone after this. “I meant what I said when I made love to you, I want to take care of you, please let me take care of you, Draco,” he whispers, breathing against the nape of Draco’s neck. He’s close, so close, and he desperately wants to reach out, but he won’t, because Draco asked him not to.
I do know where I'm taking this story, but updates are going to slow down just a bit bc, well, I gotta make everything lmao!
“I want you,” Draco tells him, feet digging into the small of Harry’s back, thighs shaking in Harry’s firm grip. “I hate you. I want you. I hate that I want you -
Harry lets Draco set the pace and is rewarded with the red that blooms across Draco’s pearly white skin, gifted with Draco’s hooded gaze, with his slick tongue, with the velvet heat of his mouth.
“Finally snapped and gave him what he had coming, did ya Harry?” Some nameless Ravenclaw, Terry Boot maybe but he doesn’t care enough to try and get it right, says, lip upturned into a cruelly satisfied smirk.
The alcohol has Harry feeling loose enough to unashamedly admit: “If I was drunker and, in a club, I’d most definitely try and pick you up.” The thing with Slytherins, Harry’s realising, is they’re a bit cruel but they also don’t take a lot seriously if Parkinson’s hearty laughter is anything to go by.
Alright, enclosed is a mixtape with some of my favourite songs! No judging! Some of these are a bit sappy, but what can I say? I have my moments. I’m really excited to hear what you think, though. I think you’re really going to like ABBA. They’re a guilty pleasure of mine, actually.
“I know,” Draco says, standing just outside their small little kitchen. There’s barely enough space in there for one person, and normally Draco wouldn’t mind the tightness of it. Normally, he adores being close to his friends, finds their touch on his skin to be a healing reminder of their love for him.
The minute he’s inside he starts throwing anything he can get his hands on, yelling incoherently. He wants to cry, but the tears won't come. Ron runs in, grabbing at him, holding him, shushing him.
This is so fucking stupid. Sorry. Whatever. This is stupid I don’t even know if I’m going to send this.
Malfoy lets out a throaty chuckle, rolling his eyes. “No, I’ve been smoking since I was thirteen, I don’t see why they’d take issue with it now.”
“Yes, I’m fucking sure, fuck me already,” Draco bites, skin flushed the most brilliant pink under the moon’s faint glow.
Harry doesn’t need more motivation than that. They sneak out of their dorm fairly easily, not caring if anyone sees them, and make their way to the kitchens with soft giggles and loud whispers.
Parkinson is pulling out a cigarette and using a lighter that she has to flick a few times to inhale the nicotine smoke. “We should have just done this in my room.”
Harry watches as Neville moves closer to Nott, who leans into him in return. Draco grabs at Pansy’s hand and they disappear together.
“You always looked like a kneazle caught in wand crossfire, but that bloke he – he was just weird, weird and mean about it, I guess.”
I’m happy to hear about you and Blaise! I’m really glad you two were able to make up, friendship is so important - especially now, after everything we’ve been through.
“You’re getting crumbs all over your shirt,” drawls Draco, picking up his now empty cup. “Who is it?”
“Sure,” Draco says with a shrug, gathering his cleared plate, moving to grab at Harry’s, and rising, setting them down with a gentle scrape against the kitchen sink.
Draco fucks him slowly, high on weed and still a little off kilter from his acid trip yesterday. It’s perfect, Draco feels amazing inside of Harry and looks ethereal above him. Harry likes the feeling of being encased in Draco’s arms and they fuck soft and sweet and slow.
Harry hits him. Draco falls onto the bed with the force of it. Draco’s laugh sharpens, he’s gasping with it. “Hit me,” Harry says, giggling at Draco’s high-induced mirth.
“I don’t think he could ever love me. What if you’re right? What if he feels some sort of sick satisfaction that I feel –” Draco takes a shaky breath. “What if he’s laughing at me behind my back?”
“Is it –” Harry wants to ask if it’s something he’s done and feels frantic with his need to know. “– do you know why –”
Draco still has his mouth right under his ear. He kisses Harry in the spot where his jaw meets his neck, a light, wet, open-mouthed thing. “Prove it,” he purrs. “I know you want to.”
Draco comes in later, when the moon is high in the sky. Harry groans, sitting up, fixing his slanted glasses.
“When she said to me, ‘I forgive you, but I don’t accept your apology.’ I realised then what I was doing.”
Draco sits up slowly, touching his face, staring at his hand in confusion, eyes searching for something only he can see, turning away from the warmth of their love making. Harry grasps at his thin wrist, ignores the tension in Malfoy’s back at the touch, and with a lump in his throat works up the courage to ask, “Do you – Did I hurt you?”
They had wandered around a little bit at first, exploring different parts of the now mostly empty castle (barring a few members of the staff, those of whom they had swiftly avoided, doing their best to keep down their fits of laughter) and then going out into the snow-covered grounds wearing only their pyjamas and snow boots. By the time they had deigned to return to the castle, after a rather intense snowball fight, they were both flushed red from the cold, but it didn’t really matter that much because the cold wasn’t that biting against Harry’s skin. Better said, because he was high on acid, he didn’t really feel it all that much.
“Maybe because he’s trying to get something in you,” Draco says, voice chiming in through bouts of his own laughter.
“I hurt him worse and all because I –” Draco cuts himself off. His heartbeat feels loud against his throat, and he feels sick suddenly. Sick with the truth, sick with want, sick from a desire he has hated himself for. A desire he has lied to himself about. A desire he dares not hope for, not now. Especially not now.
Malfoy rolls off the bed, and Harry’s hands reach out into the lingering heat of his body on the sheets. Harry watches as Malfoy strips down to his briefs, back towards Harry, as he crawls onto his own bed and curls under the sheets. Harry stares at the peak of blond hidden under the black duvet and hates how the contrast is highlighted by the moonlight.
“Nah, she’s not my girlfriend.” Harry inhales another deep drag of the spliff in his hand as Malfoy chugs from the bottle. “I can look at whoever I want naked.” His words come out a bit slurred, not that he cares all that much.
“Being chased by an egomaniac for the last seven years really does a number on a person, Gin. That’s what the fuck is wrong with me,” Harry grits hit teeth as he speaks to her, fists clenched tight at his sides; he feels himself trembling and wills himself to stop.
Draco throws his head back, biting at his kiss-swollen lower lip. “What are you waiting for, an invitation?” He wiggles his hips. “
Pansy’s deep red lip curls into a sinister smirk. “Right, right, of course not. Anyway, care for a shot?”
You’ve given me a lot to think about. I don’t know if anything I’ve just said makes sense, actually, so I’m sorry if it doesn’t. But still, I liked hearing about how you view of things.
“I wish you were coming. I mean even Malfoy’s coming, and you two are,” Neville had paused at his mention of Draco. “Well, and he’s going to be judging me the hardest considering they used to sleep together.”
“Fuck me,” Harry gasps out, but Draco’s already inside of him when he asks so instead, he wraps his legs around Draco’s hips and burrows his head up into Draco’s shoulder.
Harry pulls up, putting another finger in, his mouth falling slightly open at the sight before him, leaning down to kiss Draco, sliding his tongue in and out and grinding down onto Draco’s thigh. The other man pulls away with a whimper as Harry brushes just below the little nub inside Draco. “Fuck,” Harry growls. “Oh fuck.” He’s going to fuck Draco and he might just cry because his body is shaking with the immensely powerful desire to do so.
Draco let’s go of Harry’s hand, sits on the bed, kicks off his shoes and starts to strip off his clothes.
“Yes, yes, Potter I’m well aware. I don’t mean anything by it,” Draco explains. “I do, however, mean to say that I truly doubt she’d keep this little secret under wraps, not for me of all people.”
Draco’s hands are splayed across Harry’s chest, and the way he’s leaning on top of him and grinding against him and smirking down at him is everything he’s wanted and so much more. Harry feels the familiar tingle of his impending climax creeping up on him, curling his toes, teasing against his spine.
I think it’s sweet that you needed your hand held, your first tattoo is always a bit nerve wracking and seeing how the one you got put on your skin before this one wasn’t a pleasant experience (I’m assuming), it makes sense for you to be a bit anxious about it.
“It’s from a poem I like.” Draco moved his head further from the light of the phone, burrowing into his duvet. “By Ilya Kaminsky.”
“What about me? What about what I fucking need? Why don’t I get a say in anything? I’m not some bloody
Christmas comes and goes, and they don’t worry about giving one another a gift because what better gift than your worship of another person’s body. Harry gets on his knees for Draco, sucks him off messily and he’s nervous about it — worried Draco won’t like it, but it proves to be a fruitless concern because Draco is loud and vocal about what he likes and he encourages Harry which makes Harry feel so good about himself, hearing Draco say things like
“You don’t have to like every single person your friends are close to. You don’t have to be their friend either.”
Draco snorts, grinning down at Harry, muttering something to himself. “So needy,” he says then, voice airy and light, but he’s slowly pushing his finger inside making Harry gasp from the sensation. Draco, well a part of Draco, is inside him and it’s almost too much but most definitely not enough.
surprised by Dumbledore’s letter in your defense. Who knew he had a nasty git like you in mind? After everything.
“One more after graduation,” he says. “I cried with him.” Draco laughs, a short and bitter thing. “It was awful.”
“No, there are other drugs besides weed. Party drugs, you see.” Malfoy holds his hands out, shaking his fingers as he talks.
They strip quickly, desperate for more skin but too entranced by the other to stop what they’re doing for too long.
Draco puts another finger inside him, stretching him open and Harry feels like his body loosen with the pleasure of it and tighten with the arousal of it and it’s paradoxical but it’s good, so good.
It stings. It stings to hear words of hate escape Malfoy’s lips. And yet, there is a part of Harry that hates himself too, that wishes to destroy himself from the inside out, that wonders if Draco can aid him in the sweet crumble of destruction.
Blaise takes the crown-jewelled little spoon from the mirror and puts a little powder on it, snorting it with skilled ease. “Because it’s the new year,” he says, sniffing harshly, loudly, and handing the spoon off to Pansy.
Nott and Draco turn towards one another, lock their arms around each other as they throw back their shots. They’re laughing, probably high on something, and it’s making them fall into each other with loose-limbed ecstasy.
Malfoy tilts back his head and laughs, exposing his long milky-white neck. “Ask him, he’ll tell you. He’s got the best shit in school, charges me double for it mind you, but when you’re as rich as I am who gives a flying fuck?”
Harry moves his left hand to his cock, erect with attention, squeezing gently at the base, having to resist the urge to drag his hand up, to tease his head. The sight of Draco like this, vulnerable, allowing himself to be opened by Harry leaves him feeling lightheaded, like there’s honey oozing around his brain – melting away everything but his raw need.
“Oh, fuck yes.” Draco gently pushes her off him, grabbing at Nott’s arm and pulling him up. Draco leads Nott towards Neville, pulling him down next to him. He leans close, pressing his cheek into Neville’s and says, “Take care of him for me, won’t you?” Draco kisses the corner of his mouth and pushes Nott towards him with a grin and a laugh.
Draco reaches out to him, and Harry follows without thinking, his heart is beating too loudly in his ears, and he keeps flickering his eyes back and forth between the powder and Draco’s blood-shot eyes.
Harry steps back, leans against the hearth. France? Draco’s leaving him and moving to fucking France? Harry looks over at the blond and their eyes meet. Harry feels like his heart’s been ripped out of his chest, stomped on, and left to stay bleeding.
Draco’s hips are stuttering as he bounces on top of him, head thrown back in ecstasy as the head of Harry’s cock teases against his prostate. Draco’s trying to hide his face, white-blond hair serving as the perfect curtain for him to hide behind, but Harry is having none of that.
Draco brushes back some hair that’s fallen in front of Nott’s eyes and Harry wants to knock Nott out cold, but then the blond says, “That’s a bit pathetic, Theo,” and Harry feels a sick sense of satisfaction.
Harry makes his way over to Draco, helps the blond get fully on the bed and under the duvet. He puts an arm and a leg over Draco, pulling him close. “He’s wrong, you know.”
He pours the water, refills the filter, sets it back in his fridge, softly sets the water on the counter, places his hands against the kitchen sink, and turns his head down. His heart is beating so fast he feels sick with the way it makes him tremble. His mind, useful as ever, keeps spinning and crumbling with horrifying images of what exactly could have made Draco react so strongly tonight, what excruciating torture he must have undergone. He knows that he’s been given something delicate, a small sliver of trust, and that if he fucks this up, he won’t be given this again.
From your return address - it looks like you're in Muggle London now? I would assume so seeing how this was delivered by the postman and not an owl. Why go there of all places?
“I wish I could have been the one to kill the man who did this to you,” Draco says, candlelight reflecting in his dark eyes, opening him up in a way Harry has never seen before.
Must be hard lying to him too, what's this about him thinking you've left a sheltered life? I mean, I guess you kind of did have one - but tell me, what's the excuse you're giving him? Does he think you were kept in a cupboard or something?
. Draco, like this, open, vulnerable, the intimacy of it almost too much for Harry to handle. Although Harry’s sure that there is no such thing as too much. Too much of what? Love? It flows easily through and out of him now, as he lifts himself up, gradually sliding his fingers out of Draco’s wet heat.
“Happy,” Harry echoes. “Right.” He realises then that he doesn’t have happy movies, he has dramas and thrillers, but he doesn’t hold onto happy things.
“Okay,” Harry says aloud, into the silence of his kitchen. He moves to wash the dishes, nodding his head now and again as his thoughts become linear with what he can do. It’s scary, he thinks, to love someone and know that there is a version of them you cannot touch. To love someone and know they have a wound that may never heal.
Then their shirts come off and there’s scars marring Draco’s white skin. Harry takes his hand and appreciates the contrast of pearly white and reddish brown, how they seem to mirror each other and yet exist so differently. Harry has scars too, on his face, on his sternum, on his chest, on his arms.
Harry’s heart squeezes in his chest, and Harry, so overwhelmed by Draco pumping in and out of him, reaches out before he can think better of it. Harry starts to kiss the scars on Draco’s arm, soft, gentle kisses that have Draco’s head dropping down.
Hermione is being too obvious about her eavesdropping, Harry is staring at her when he says, “Would you rather we fight?” He thinks he sounds rather calm when he asks, but to be fair he’s been told he sounds cold when he makes his voice go flat like that.
“Don’t need to,” Draco sighs, sweetly, smiling wide, hands coming to squeeze onto Harry’s shoulders. “You’re going to make me come like this.”
“He would do this until I was about five,” Draco says, finally looking at Harry. “The mind is a funny thing,” he says, with his index finger pointed like a gun at his temple. “It’ll hide what you don’t want to see.” He shudders. “The body though, the body never forgets.” Draco’s voice cracks as he says, “The body keeps score,” tears finally spilling over sharp cheekbones.
“Come on, Draco. Down you go,” Theo says, helping Draco sit on his bed and take off his shoes. Harry curls his lip in distaste at the easy affection Draco offers Theo, leaning into the dark-haired boy with an arm around him and pulling him to his chest, running his hands through his hair.
Harry turns his head in time to see Draco, eyes glazed, take his finger, and swipe it across his come stained chest, bringing it to his lips. Harry’s mouth falls agape as Draco turns to him and says, “You ever wondered what you taste like?”
Also, the Muggles are not in the telly! They are recorded on a camera that captures pictures and sound that plays on the telly, so think of it like the moving pictures of our world - but with sound!
Theo lays the cutting board on the counter, sets up the vegetables around him, and begins chopping at the onions in the methodical way he always has. “I’d do anything for you.”
Harry tries to push them away, but they only hold onto him harder, tighter, refusing to let him go no matter how hard he thrashes against them. They lead him to his bed, the one he hasn’t slept in since he started sleeping with Draco — no, Malfoy.
Everyday Harry wakes up in what feels like a bubble of warmth, joy, and something softer, sweeter than Harry’s ever had the pleasure of enjoying freely.
“Do you always feel it when I look at you?” Harry’s voice is a rasp; he’d meant to whisper his question, but Draco is warm next to him and he’s high as fuck and it’s making his head go a bit dizzy.
Harry stands up, throwing down his cards, muttering mostly to himself about how he needs a fucking smoke. His heart is thumping in his ear so loudly, has him stomping up the steps so fiercely that he doesn’t realise Hermione and Ron have followed him up.
As for the CDs, those are yours to keep. I actually was thinking of sending you a mixtape? Do you know what that is? It would come on a cassette, so you'd need to get a cassette player - but it would be a bunch of songs from various artists, so you could discover a bunch of new ones! Let me know if you're interested.
Harry gets into a more comfortable position, sprawling out his legs and pushing his hips forward  before turning his head just a bit more towards Malfoy. “Yeah?”
Harry feels tears swell in his own eyes and he swallows the saltiness of their sting down his throat, breathing deeply and evenly before saying, “Whenever you’re ready, I’ll be here to listen, even if it makes you sick.”
“Ah, yes, does my phrasing sound too intimate?” Luna’s airy voice is non-judgemental, simply curious. “Would you prefer I say you’re fucking?”
Harry shrugs, nodding. His heart is in his throat suddenly, as he stares down at the powder before him. Draco’s still gently running his thumb along his scar, though, and it’s distracting in all the best ways.
“Want a bump?” Draco asks, separating a line for Harry. He hits the acid-pop sugar and lets the drip trickle down his throat, soothing him into high-induced happiness.
“They’re already dead.” Draco swallows harshly. “Please don’t fuck me,” he begs, hands coming to wrap around Harry’s wrists, pulling Harry’s hands away, pulling Harry’s body towards him. Pulling
“I thought if I was forgiven by the people I hurt, then that meant that I was a better person. That I had done the work to be different than I once was, but really – what I had done was, create an impossibility. I have to want to change, and I have to do it for me. Not for the approval of others, not because it’s the right thing to do. For me, I had to do it for myself.”
“Yes, you are,” Harry pleads, throat thick. He feels the familiar shame of the monster in his chest rattling against the carefully placed chains of restraint, echoing in his heartbeat the rhythm of
“Yes,” says Draco, voice deep and rough. Harry bites at his lower lip, moving his hands. One finds purchase against Draco’s chest and the other moves towards Draco’s hip. They’re so close now, Harry’s mere centimetres away from Draco’s sweet looking lips.
Harry has every right not to forgive Malfoy, but what he does not have a right to do is determine how other people forgive him or move forward in their relationship with him - if, and only IF, they have also been hurt by them too.
“Ron!” Hermione sounds aghast, eyes wide and frantic. She looks sort of like she did when they had all been fighting the night Ron left them behind in that shabby old tent. “You don’t mean that, I know you don’t.”
On a rainy afternoon, when they’re exiting the cinema and standing under the canopy waiting for the downpour to let up, Draco says, “Rainy days make me miss Pansy.”
“Right.” Malfoy says, and there is so much finality in that one syllable that Harry can only close his mouth and stare. The other man moves to right himself, pulling on his pants and jumper. He walks towards the small blue tiled bathroom, closing the door gently behind him.
“I don’t know why we even bothered,” Ron grumbles, leaning against the wall behind McGonagall with his arms and legs crossed in front of him.
“What can I say?” Harry moves to the threshold where Draco still stands, holding out his calloused hands. “You bring it out in me.”
The lines get blurry because Harry knows who Draco is and Draco doesn't know it's Harry (yet) - but, we'll cross that bridge when we get there!
forever scarred into it, and gently touches Draco’s cheek – it’s a tentative touch, and intentionally so.
Up front he sees a familiar head of curls, wild, thick, coarse. Draco has always wanted to run his hands through those curls, wondering what it would feel like to pull on them. Green eyes are the next thing he’s taking in, intense as always. Evergreen hues of wonder that bore into Draco’s darkened soul.
1. Sociopath is an outdated term, and the proper diagnosis is ASPD (Anti-Social Personality Disorder).
About the advice you passed onto Gin, she wanted me to thank you. She didn’t tell me what they talked about, but she says Blaise really opened up to her - and she was shocked to learn the truth about his mother and her past. She did say that the rumours were utter crap, and that anyone who believed them was jealous of Mrs. Zabini’s grace and decorum. I’ve never been one to believe rumours, had too many spread about me to believe what the gossip mill says about others, so I don’t believe what they say about Blaise’s mother either. I think she really likes him. I’m not going to lie, I’m rooting for them!
“Yes, he’s let us know that you and himself along with Ms. Parkinson have been taking Pixie Dust, amongst other narcotics.”
I want to say one thing that I think is important to clarify, which is that Draco is a sex worker and Harry's identity is going to be hidden. Draco's not bothered by this because, well, it's not all that unsurprising for someone to want to remain anonymous with him in the online sphere.
“Red,” Harry’s voice is lower than he means for it to be. In his defense, it’s been a while since he’s seen a girl anywhere near naked.
The cans hiss with the air that’s released, and Harry feels a similar happenstance occurring within him. Like a balloon releasing air, he feels deflated, but not defeated. He thinks this is tiredness but is unsure if it’s the proper description for where he sits emotionally.
After a few weeks, Malfoy switches from cigarettes to weed. Harry smells it before he even opens his door, greets Malfoy with a quirk in his brow and a tilt of his head.
“Get these bloody trousers off me,” Draco drawls, moving to bite down on Harry’s shoulder, to lick up his neck, to suck his own mark in Harry’s bronze skin.
Draco nips at Harry’s shoulder, lightly at first, before digging his canines into Harry’s flesh, biting harshly. Harry moans, wondering if Draco wishes to see him bleed. Harry had made Draco bleed once, when they were boys, but now they are two men, having recently shed the last year of their teenagehood like molten skin.
Draco announces his presence with the clearing of his throat and Harry turns to see him eyeing the rose petals on the white of Harry’s sheets, face glowing under the warmth of candlelight, blond head shining gold.
Harry snorts. “Not bloody likely.” He turns back to his bacon, stuffs it into his mouth and that seems to be the end of it for now. Harry really isn’t interested in explaining himself.
So, here's the thing about being a sex worker and sharing personal tidbits of your life. You always have to be careful about what you share - and you have to consider how much of your authentic self you can bring to the table. How much is too much, versus just enough?
Ew! I cannot believe your Aunt and Voldemort had a love affair. That makes so much sense, though. She was weirdly obsessed with Voldemort.
Malfoy is tense, tight – as rigid as Harry suspected him to be, and Harry realises that Malfoy likes to be coaxed into his pleasure. Malfoy responds to softness where Harry had expected Malfoy to goad him toward roughness.
“I trust you,” Draco says, blinking up towards the ceiling, voice tremouring slightly. “I know you’ll stop if I ask you to.”
The last time he had done that in front of his friends, Ron and Hermione specifically, he’d been met with stares dripping with worry. Not his fault that he’d died in a war, came back to kill a man, and developed a drinking problem for a month or two after the dust had settled. He’d been called as a witness for numerous Death Eater trials, harassed by the press, and been rejected by the girl he’d thought he’d get to come home to when he let himself hope that he might survive the bloody war — was it foolish to want those closest to him to cut him some fucking slack?
And Harry does, he shows him, feeling his flesh turned over and raw as he cooks for Draco, setting him down to eat, helping Draco as he moves to clean the kitchen, putting on a happy movie for them to watch. Harry had begun renting happy films ever since the very first time, when he had none but an afterthought of Ginny’s to offer.
Draco kisses him, roughly, before softening under Harry’s tentative exploration. Harry shakes with the delicacy of Draco’s trembling body under his touch, and he wonders how he can hold onto this. He wonders if this is how he ruins himself and hates that his self-destruction is saccharine in its uncoiling.
I know you gave me the number for your landline (did Richard help you set that up?) but I think I’d still prefer sending you letters. That alright with you?
They’re laying down on Malfoy’s bed, facing each other, with their heads at the foot of the bed instead of on the pillows by the headboard.
Harry leans against the frosted window, remembering Neville’s words and wondering when Draco will come home. Harry hates that he knows he misses him, hates that he’s hoping Draco misses him too.
“He’s the one who’s fucked in the head, not me.” Harry feels the sting of salt-filled tears threatening to bleed down his cheeks. He won't cry, not over this, not over him. “Just look at his stupid –” Harry makes his way over to Malfoy, who tries to pull away from him. “– his stupid fucking arm!” Harry pulls back Draco’s sleeve, revealing the lines of cuts scattered across his Dark Mark.
“Like where?” Draco asks, turning back to the task of rummaging through the lower cabinet for what Harry assumes is his saucepan, or maybe the pasta strainer. They’d decided on chicken Alfredo for tonight, simple, and easy after Draco’s long day of lessons.
“Is that why you’re asking me of all people for fashion advice?” Harry had asked, head tilted towards his friend's reflection in the mirror.
About Richard, see that’s what I mean when I say that I’m pants at giving advice about romantic interests. I don’t know how to approach the people I like either, so I just end up avoiding them. Ginny says that’s part of my appeal, ironically - that I become more “aloof” is how she put it, haha.
Alright, look, I’m sorry okay? The war’s gotten to my head. I’m having a rough time of it. I know it’s over but sometimes I feel like it isn’t. Hermione says I can’t get mad at you for being a complete arsewipe if then I run around and act like a complete prick to everyone I know (even you).
“Oh fuck, fuck,” Draco moans when Harry moves against his sweet spot, back arched, legs tightening around Harry’s waist. “There,
She knows we’ve been exchanging letters, because she’s usually the one who picks up the mail (since she’s the first to wake up in the morning) and she’s been weird about it. She was hurt at first, but I think she understands that us exchanging letters is our way of making peace with our complicated history.
“Don’t be foolish, my boy. You’ve also been noted by your teachers as being late to all of your classes, sometimes skipping them altogether. You’re failing most of your classes, Harry, if there’s something going on, please, just,
Draco doesn’t wait for Harry to signal that he’s ready for a third finger, instead slowly starting to slip it in, staring down at Harry with a flushed face and chest, waiting for Harry to nod so that he can continue. It’s nice, Harry thinks, having someone inside him like this. He feels almost full, in a way. He likes the way Draco’s looking at him, like he’s the only person that matters in the world. Harry briefly wonders what he looks like but quickly stops worrying about it once he sees the way Draco bites his lip.
“Where’ve you been?” Harry holds out his hand, Draco takes it and interlocks their fingers, bringing Harry’s bruised knuckles to his lips.
“But –” Harry cuts off with a groan, because Draco’s just brushed against that spot inside him, that spot that’ll drive him mad with pleasure. Draco notices it too and is focusing in on that spot, thrusting long and hard into Harry. Now Harry can’t stop, he has Draco’s arm to his face and he’s kissing with intent now. His heart is fluttering, he’s overwhelmed, and he can’t help the hurt he feels at the sight of Draco’s harm towards himself. “I want to, please just let me do what I
Harry puts Draco’s cock in his mouth without much thought, relishes in the way Draco moans and tilts his head back, feels smug at the way Draco says
I had a lot of fun the other day! I didn’t expect the Valentine’s Day event to be as big as it was, and I won’t lie all the poems about either: heartbreak, longing, or passion were a bit too on the nose. For our conversation, I mean, the subject matter specifically. I should have expected it though, haha. It was weird hearing about my mum from Snape’s perspective, but also kind of nice. From the way you told these stories, it seems like they were really close friends at one point. Maybe he loved her for most of his life, but then he lost her. Gah, it’s so very confusing.
“Takes one to know one,” Draco says, trying to turn his face into a sneer, but unable to keep the serious look on his face long enough. After another fit of laughter, Draco turns to Nott and asks, “Am I really the last person you slept with?”
Harry does eventually doze off, with the last thing he’s aware of being the steady rise and fall of Draco’s chest and the feeling of Draco softly scratching at Harry’s scalp.
“Yes.” Hermione laughs, it’s a soft and quiet thing. “I was so convinced that all I needed to do was make a timetable and follow a 12-step plan toward healing.”
Harry’s breath hitches, he feels his heart in his throat, but it’s not a heavy thing. While it does overwhelm him, it doesn’t scare him. “Okay.”
Harry has his arms wrapped around Draco’s neck, has been moving his arms up and down his back, clawing at it whenever Draco teased against the sensitive spots on his neck and chest and inside him.
I’ve missed you. I’m sorry I haven’t written, really I am. Here’s something you should know about me, I’m a bit of a mess. I’ve been a bit of a mess this past year, I think I’ve been a bit of a mess for half my life. But today, I feel like being reckless and stupid and I want to crawl out of my fucking skin.
The first time Draco spends the night, it’s a planned thing, not that Harry had realised it at first. Draco comes through the Floo, brushing soot off his light-green jumper, chucking off his oxfords and padding around in his snitch-embroidered socks.
Draco brings his hand between them, lazily wanking Harry’s cock, using the precome leaking out of him to help. “It’s never like this with anyone else.”
When Malfoy came to find him the way he always did, something in Harry’s chest had rattled, and the decaying bits of the monster in his chest had chanted:
But the thing about this desire, is that it had been growing for years. It was tentative at first, something twisted that made Harry feel ashamed but then it had morphed into something else altogether when Harry had seen the ways in which Draco had softened. With Draco’s growth came Harry’s mounting want, with Draco’s newfound delicate nature came Harry’s overflowing curiosity.
Neville seems unfazed by the barb, and Harry can’t help but wonder if maybe there’s some truth to Draco’s statement — the other man at least thinks of it as truth, since he said as much under the effects of Veritaserum.
And of course, he was nervous, it was a new layer of intimacy they had yet to explore, making love while in love. Harry didn’t let his mind fantasize too much about how he wanted things to go, instead deciding to follow his instincts.
P.S. I like your tattoo idea, a lot actually. I’m curious to see how it comes out. Send a picture of that too, if you like?
Harry is practically leaned completely against Draco when it’s finally his turn to hit the acid-pop sugar, which Harry learns is the street name for the drug from an enthused looking Blaise. Harry shifts, mourning the loss of contact, but is soothed by Draco’s return to his side — Draco’s leaning more into him now, and the heat of his body makes Harry’s fingers twitch with the desire to touch.
Draco finds Harry in the living room, a happy movie already in the VHS player, telly turned on to the play-menu.
down his spine. He doesn’t want to give it a name, just wants to sit down on the windowsill and get high.
Draco finds him at 12 Grimmauld Place at the beginning of July, the sun’s heat is thick, and the sweat it produces on the back of Harry’s neck is the only reminder he has that he’s still alive, barely, but alive, nonetheless.
“Stop, stop,” Draco says beneath him, hands shaking into the heart of Harry’s chest, where the monster of his need lays and purrs. “You’re drunk,” he observes. “I can’t do this with you if you’re drunk.”
Harry’s head follows Draco’s words but his gut twists with confusion. “When have I ever been drunk?”
“Where are you even getting this stuff from anyway?” Harry asks one night, sitting in his usual position, legs stretched out in front of him as he melts into the rough cobblestone behind him.
The fourth time Harry wonders what Draco tastes like, it’s the end of the first year of Auror training and he’s been brought into a mixed lesson with the Potions Lab department. Draco’s not even in that department, he’s just an assistant to the guest speaker, and somehow, by chance, that guest speaker is going to be teaching the morning class – the afternoon class has a different guest speaker. Harry tries to pay attention for a total of ten minutes but then Draco’s walking around and the potions lab is so
Nott puts an arm around Draco and laughs into the blond man’s neck, burying his face in it. “Oh, you’re so dirty,” he says, pointing at Neville. “Draco, did you know, he’s been trying to get it out of me for weeks now.” Nott’s cackling, and the sound of it grates at Harry.
Harry rises to his knees, grabbing at the bottle of lube at the foot of the bed, squeezing a generous amount onto the palm of his hand, wrapping his hand around himself, slicking himself up, using the excuse to wank himself a bit, memorising the sight of Draco as he lays like a prince waiting to be attended, head tilted, teeth on his knuckle, gently biting down.
Harry’s heart pounds against his chest, his hands tremble, but he keeps his gaze steady on Draco whose eyes still stay turned towards the ceiling, perhaps looking beyond it, wishing to see the blue of the morning sky.
The next morning, with the sun seeping into the window and serving as a cool greeting, Draco offers Harry a spliff and they smoke in bed — Harry eyeing Draco’s neck, which is covered in the bruises and bites Harry left him. Something swells in Harry’s chest, it’s warm and possessive and likes the sight of Draco’s chest littered in Harry’s marks.
loud, someone had brought speakers from home and did some rather complex magic to get them to work in the magically charged halls of Hogwarts. It’s rather impressive magic, Harry thinks, but he can’t be bothered to care about the mechanics of such a thing.
The second time Draco and Harry come together, it’s the night before graduation and they make it all the way to the very end before Malfoy cries.
Also, yeah. I love my nose piercing a lot. Gold does look good against my skin. Hermione inspired me to get more gold jewelry. Her and I are almost the same skin tone, she’s a bit darker, and we’ve been embracing it a lot lately. I don’t know how well versed you are about Muggles and their own form of prejudice - I actually talked to Blaise about it (he came with Ginny to visit last weekend), and he told me it’s less common in the Wizarding world to see someone treat you differently based on the colour of your skin. Growing up, that wasn’t the case. Both me and Hermione had people treat us differently because of our race and ethnic identities. So, she says we should dress ourselves in gold jewelry because it’s what our ancestors did - that we should show off our melanin and feel proud of it too.
