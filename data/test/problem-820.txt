It took a few gentle rubs, and Harry slid a finger in between them, unable to see what he was doing. He slowly moved it up and down, feeling more oil seep onto his fingers, and then, Draco was coming. He shook violently, pounding against Harry’s prostate, and Harry followed seconds later with Draco’s fingers squeezing around the head of his cock.
“Don’t be a bitch!” Ginny rolls her eyes with a smile. “I am about to change your life with the date I’ve got cooking up for you.”
“No,” Potter said on an exhale, his voice strangely distorted by the billows of smoke, thick and white against the cold December air. “But I’m willing to share,” he added and took another drag.
Teddy moans as Harry’s slicked finger bottoms out inside him and Draco can feel his hips shaking. From a mix of exertion and that impossible, spectacular tightness, the slick heat completely enveloping him, forcing him to gasp for air.
“Good boy,” Harry says and Teddy whimpers softly. “I know what you want. You beg so sweetly, you’ll get whatever you want.”
“I want you, Draco,” Harry murmurs and god, does he want Draco. He wants him in all the ways Draco will allow, he wants him so much he’s throbbing with it and he kisses Draco again, and again, just because he can, because he tastes like sex incarnate and Harry’s
Compartmentalising things into numerical systems has always helped Draco get around and organise his thoughts into some semblance of order. It should have been a rather last-resort coping technique but one tends to abandon one’s standards when one ends up with an insane sack of flesh and bones as a housemate in their teenage years.
for you.”
Harry laughs despite himself, a relieved, painless sound leaving his lungs like a breath of fresh air and he keeps kissing Draco, and carefully touching him all over as if making sure he’s not going to break.
The distraction fails, and Harry starts to get hard. He pulls Draco closer.
He gracelessly flops on top of Harry, completely unbothered by all the come now sticking to their sweat-drenched chests, and Harry doesn’t mind the solid, hot weight—he wraps his arms around Draco, unable to move even an inch more, his legs turned into jelly.
“Holy shit,” Harry breathes, not liking where the story is going.
“Say it again.”
Potter is—for lack of a better word—a sexy fucking bastard. No part of him is lanky by any standard anymore (and Draco has both seen and assessed all his
He doesn’t finish his sentence as there’s a hand gently cupping his cheek, and then Draco kisses him. He kisses him in a way Harry doesn’t know how to handle, not with Draco, not in the clusterfuck of complicated emotions they’ve been circling ever since it all started. The usual hunger dripping off Draco’s lips is gone, replaced by an unbearable sweetness, like sun-warmed honey, soft like magnolia petals after a drizzle. Without thinking about it, Harry’s body leans into Draco’s and he kisses back, all of the air punched out of his lungs, he brushes his lips against that impossible light and Draco makes a small, needy sound at the back of his throat, and Harry feels he might die.
“It’s not like we’re going to have Firewhisky and bet on Hippogriff fights, right Freddie?” Harry coos, kissing the top of the little boy’s nose. He lets out a tiny laugh and much more drool than a baby should be able to produce. “Bloody hell, and I thought it was going to be a peaceful evening.”
Draco slowly stares him down. “I just might.”
“What else?” Harry asked, his hands finding purchase at the dip of Draco’s back, fingers counting the knobs of his spine, tongue working at overheated skin.
“Potter,” Draco says gravely. “I have a gun—”
The gaping hole in his heart throbbed at the beloved name and Harry whimpered softly as dull, crippling pain washed over his whole body, centring itself at the back of his head.
look, it was Potter, pure and distilled, down to his very essence—stupidly adventurous, bright, and
Malfoy is looking at him with wild eyes, his whole body shaking with rage, his wet fringe obscuring half of his face. He makes a move as if to run, and then retreats, flouncing about in growing horror, and Harry desperately tries to calm his nerves and come up with a plan in the small time frame they have. He pulls out his wand, holding it tightly, and Malfoy pauses.
Next to him, Malfoy lets out a sultry laugh as he watches Harry with curious, glimmering eyes. “Auror Potter, such dirty thoughts,” he clicks his tongue. “Good grief, what would the Minister say?” He shakes his head at Harry’s death glare. “I didn’t
“Surrender your wand,” Harry says in a low voice, trying to keep any enjoyment from his tone. It might be amusing to see Malfoy squirm but he really hopes he won’t be stupid enough to try and fight him.
He expects Draco to maybe make a joke about Harry’s cock-potential going to waste or something of the sort, but Draco kisses him, deep and filthy, bumping their hands together, his fingers ghosting over Harry’s. Harry finally gets the hint—he casts the usual set of sex spells and Summons some lube that’s now dripping all over their tangled fingers and spreads his legs shamelessly, taking advantage of the lube and stroking his cock with a quiet hiss. Draco watches him, licking his lips, and grabs Harry’s wrist to make him stop.
“Nothing,” Harry grits out, watching Malfoy carefully for any signs. There should be something, an indicator that Harry’s instincts are not mistaken, but Malfoy looks perfectly at ease with a raised eyebrow, elegantly spread in his chair.
Draco stares at him like he’s just sprouted a second head.
“That this”—he thrusts his hips sharply, making Harry cry out.—“is reckless— another thrust, their cocks sliding together hotly—“ill-advised—ah!” He presses his forehead against Harry’s, biting his lower lip. “Completely unprofessional,” Draco whispers and leans over to the nightstand where Harry’s wand is lying.
He hastily undoes Potter’s flies and presses his tongue into the hollow of his throat, sucks on the spot with a low moan when he finds a damp patch over Potter’s underwear. Unceremoniously, Draco shoves his hand down Potter’s pants and, gods, he’s so thick Draco can only think of that cock fucking the breath out of him. Somewhere in the hazy-rushed rutting of their bodies, Draco hopes that’s on the table.
“Isn’t it what friends do?”
Their boss is currently focused solely on Potter, thank fuck, and Draco tries to do a thing he rarely ever does anymore, which is appear as small and invisible as physically possible in a small space. He thinks back to his job interview and wonders how on earth he got it in the first place.
, where Draco’s breathing was relaxed as he melted into their embrace and Harry was able to keep him safe. He focused on the smooth tones coming from the gramophone, on the way Draco smelled and the way Draco’s nose dug into his neck. Harry took deep, steadying breaths and, inexplicably, didn’t think about all the things they could have done if they had more time. He thought about fifteen minutes ago, two days ago, a month ago. Draco kissing him. Draco making love to him. Draco smiling at him as he scooted over on the sofa. He thought about all the time they had together and another wave of helpless panic hit him as he couldn’t remember the last thing Draco cooked for dinner or the colour of the mugs they had their last tea in.
“And it’s nice for Draco, because he has trouble trusting how people feel about him.”
Harry’s asleep before he has a chance to think about how annoying that is.
Draco made a strange sort of noise in the back of his throat that Harry suspected had less to do with the invitation, and more to do with his continued disbelief that any of Harry’s friends could genuinely be asking.
Harry returns to Grimmauld through Luna’s Floo and gives the flowers to a reluctantly-impressed Kreacher, and then goes straight back to George’s store. Sure enough, Ginny is sitting behind the counter, snacking on Sugar Hexes and kicking her heels against a cabinet. The queue of frazzled shoppers waiting at the till suggests she’s not exactly lifting her weight in helping out.
“Yes,” he says simply.
“He’s not the person you think he is,” Luna says earnestly, looking around the table at all of them, but her glance lands on Harry. “I know you think he tricked me or manipulated me into marrying him in some way, but it’s not true. I love him very much.”
He should send a Patronus to Hermione. If she’s not at the office, she can meet them—
,” Parkinson hisses, and he glances down at the notes clutched in his clammy hand.
“Come back to mine,” Potter whispers in his ear, as the others argue too loudly about who is going into the Floo at the Leaky first to get home.
to cook family dinner at Andromeda’s. I’m always petrified that I’ll drop Hugo, but I want to learn how to hold him so I don’t. I’ve never had a back garden to barbecue in, and I want one. And a kitchen of my own to cook in. And a place to call home.”
“It’s a work day, Potter.” Malfoy barely glances at Harry before returning his attention to whatever complicated set of runes he’s sketching out on a large piece of parchment pinned to his wall.
So that’s what Harry concentrates on, when the subject comes up. His overwhelming confidence in Malfoy’s technical expertise and what a credit he is to the Ministry. And not the other things. Like the way the short, fitted robes the Curse Breakers wear reveal just enough to be distracting and not nearly enough to give Harry things to dwell on later. The fact that at some point in the last decade Malfoy stopped gluing his hair to his head with Sleekeazy’s and now has a soft blond fringe that often falls in his eyes. That he’s never been anything but scrupulously professional and polite to Harry, but has also never said anything to him not strictly related to work.
“And you are?” the wizard asks.
,” his grandfather whistles. “Well, be a good lad and get me up on a wall. Somewhere near a window would be nice. Haven’t seen the sun in a while.”
“I think you need to give me a bit of background, Harry.” Neville says, sinking into a chair with a sigh. “Why would I be surprised to see you, Draco? You’re usually around—at the pub for lunch on Sundays or having coffee with Harry in that little cafe near work.”
“So, uh…You can sit in the Owner’s Box, but Pansy Parkinson is in there, and Merlin knows who else.”
This prompts a startled laugh out of Kingsley. “I’m very glad to hear it, Harry.”
Harry can feel his face get hot. “Well, it’s a bit bloody confusing when there’s two of them, isn’t it?” he mutters.
“And your mother?”
Ron’s mouth opens and closes like a fish. Harry suspects his own might have just fallen open and stayed that way. It’s an obvious solution, but he can’t believe Malfoy has offered it up so readily and he also can’t work out why he’s having such a physical reaction to the idea.
Kreacher seems to have lost interest and is waddling out of the kitchen. “Hanging it up is not being any use,” he grouches cryptically as he disappears.
The elf appears to consider that so hard Harry feels like he should be able to see steam coming out of his ears. Eventually, a small nod.
Harry shakes his head to clear it.
Draco arches an eyebrow at him, and Harry starts to feel defensive. He knows Appleby is a small, underappreciated club, but he also knows these programmes have a real impact in the local magical community and he’s genuinely proud of them.
He thinks about what Hermione said.
“Chang?”
Harry never sleeps well, exactly. So there’s always a disorienting moment just as he’s waking, when his pulse starts to race and his body tries to decide if he’s in danger. Even ten years after the war he can still jerk upright convinced he’s in the Forest of Dean trying to pull together some final strands of hope. It always takes a moment to recognise the thick blackout curtains of his own bedroom at Grimmauld Place, or to rub the crick out of his neck and find he’s fallen asleep at his desk. Or, like now, to breath in a deep lungful of antiseptic potion, feel the stiff institutional sheets, and realise he’s in St Mungo’s. Again.
The enormous doors are back on their hinges, and Luna is the one to cry out this time in joy at seeing the stained glass pieces soaring upwards like a delicate rainfall in reverse, each fragment settling carefully into its rightful place. As they step across the threshold, the four house banners unfurl to hang above them.
“What on earth do you need Muggles for?” Bulstrode asks.
use your name.”
“But?”
“It worked!” Hannah sighs, looking around the room in relief. “They didn’t fly away this time, they sort of faded out.”
“I went to my room immediately after that fiasco at dinner. I tossed and turned for a long time. I was having trouble sleeping, and wanted a glass of water. There was no glass in my room, so I went looking for one. I overheard an argument in Lucius Malfoy’s study, though at the time I didn’t know that’s what the room was. I couldn’t tell who was arguing, or what was being said, just raised male voices behind a closed door. I found a glass and went back upstairs.”
Harry swallows and pushes his food around a little with his fork.
“This is bloody delicious, mate,” he says, shoving lasagne into his mouth. Harry laughs. The meal is simple compared to last night. He thinks about the reversed Baked Alaska, cold on the outside and hot in the middle. About sitting in Draco’s study afterwards over whiskey discussing the techniques the chef had used. The animated way he’d gestured as he talked about
“I don’t know, a couple of hours maybe. You know what he’s like when he gets talking.”
doing
“It’s just a game,” he tries valiantly, but Draco groans.
Harry feels his face heat. “Where is this bloody restaurant?”
The lamps on the walls cast a greenish light across the grimy white tile and the wet floor. Harry catches sight of his own reflection in the cracked mirror above the basin. Some part of his brain is screaming at him that he doesn’t look like that any more. Short and scrawny, school robes slipping off one shoulder. But he can’t focus because lying on the floor in front of him, Draco is bleeding out.
Banny looks terrified. He tucks his hand under one of his legs, swinging both of them back and forth nervously.
“I don’t think we’ll need them after all,” Harry says, getting to his feet.
Ron’s face in the fire takes on a frown. “What?”
He forces his eyes open, blinking into the light of the room.
“Thanks—this has the number I need on it. I’ll call them now.” He steps away, holding his mobile up to his ear.
The fight is leaking out of Harry but he still feels so
And isn’t that just the thought. Malfoy using Harry entirely for his own ends. It isn’t as if Harry hasn’t often done the same. He’s never thought about Malfoy other than as a convenient outlet for his frustrations. A way to work off some steam. Someone he doesn’t have to keep up appearances around. Someone who doesn’t give a toss whether he’s an Auror or not. Someone who wants, even more than Harry does himself, to get away from the past.
“What are you grinning about?”
“When I knew we’d have to complete the ritual here, I spent a lot of time researching the Room of Requirement. It’s the most sentient space within Hogwarts, and likely the most .... protected.”
any more,” Neville hastily adds. “The symbol is used to mark Level Four ingredients. Those boxes contain dried leaves of Swiss hemlock. About ten times as deadly as the common kind.”
“Mr Potter! How long are you in town for, then? Are you and your Death Eater boyfriend here planning to adopt more kids? What do you say to law-abiding wizards who think this is an appalling way to mark the ten years that have passed since the war?”
on her bedside cabinet. He’d almost finished.
But Harry catches himself — that’s an easy, familiar way to look at this, but is it right? Harry remembers Malfoy the night before: his expression, the fury.
This is how they start to make something new for themselves.
Draco smiles fondly at the boy as he dashes out of the room, his hair a violet riot around his head. When Teddy was a baby and Draco had been carefully trying to restore his relationship with the little family he had left, he’d offered to babysit for Andromeda—to give her a break, to let her spend some time with his mother, and so on. It had been a disaster, at first. Draco’s view that raising children must be easy if house-elves could do it had proven to be about as accurate as “cooking must be easy if house-elves can do it” and “dry-clean only can’t possibly mean that.” But Draco was nothing if not stubborn. In the years after the war, whenever he discovered that something he’d been brought up believing was false, he would absolutely immerse himself in learning all about it. And that included babies.
, was all he could think. Why didn’t any of them want to take some time? Why this insistence on ticking off life’s accomplishments as quickly as they could? School, career, marriage. Wasn’t the whole
“Luna and Leila are dating,” Harry says. “Did you know that? Am I the only one in the dark?”
“Er, thanks,” says Harry, still watching Draco disappear into the tunnel.
Draco nods, understanding the point Harry’s wrestling with. “They could have fixed it in the conventional sense. Replaced the roof and so on. But you were right as well. The house can’t be whole until the
“My father, everybody,” Malfoy says, downing his own drink. Harry notices his hand is trembling. “I’d apologise, but really. What’s the point? Please make up for his behaviour by drinking as much of his wine as you can.”
Potter doesn’t seem to have noticed his surprise.
He texts Elsa to say that he’s home, and they arrange to meet the following day. She’s made do at the school this intake with two student teachers, and Harry’s keen to hear how it’s all gone. He buys an egg and cheese at the deli on the corner and goes back up to his apartment. It feels so small, after Grimmauld Place. Maybe it’s time to look for somewhere with a little more space.
Harry had thought he’d be stressed out, but as the starting whistle blows he finds he’s just excited and happy. The packed stadium is roaring their support of both teams, and seeing the away fans proudly swinging their pale blue and silver Appleby flags and banners in among the sea of Puddlemere navy and gold is more than he could have imagined.
“He was right, you know. I am empty. An empty vessel.”
Harry nods sagely, not wanting to admit that it was actually Rose who had worked it out. “I’ve hung a wreath on the front door. The cards on the mantlepiece were a bit of an accident, but that still seemed to work.”
“Send my love to the kids,” he mumbles.
Teddy scowls as he dismounts, his hair the colour of a thundercloud. Draco doesn’t take it personally. He knows who Teddy’s really mad at, and he certainly doesn’t blame him.
“Never mind. You’re right, I should owl Bill. He’ll be back from Cairo on Friday and—”
Of course, that was just the first time.
but certainly didn’t want any
Harrison Kiely was quoted as saying. “
“He’s really very good company. I did enjoy talking to him. So many changes he’s having to oversee in such a short amount of time. It’s a remarkable challenge.”
Holber’s face lights up at the mention of her name. “Miss Lovegood is very special,” he says, and gestures toward a door away from the kitchens. Harry follows and finds himself in a small but warmly decorated sitting room. He wonders if this is for the elves themselves, or if this is just yet another extension of the Manor’s endless reach. Rooms in every direction, hardly ever used.
(See the end of the chapter for
Neville and Ginny both shake their heads.
“The curse damage was extensive, and reacted poorly with that case of potions that exploded when you fired at the suspect. They need a specialist. But fortunately someone is starting here in the morning who has the right experience. A transfer from the wizarding wing of
“But you’re still planning to take her in?” Harry asks.
“The fact that it’s already light outside and you have fourteen people coming for lunch?”
“That sounds lovely, Harry,” Arthur says, patting him on the hand and immediately launching into a long discussion about Muggle smartphones that Harry’s confident is only about ten percent accurate.
,” Draco splutters, remembering the look he'd exchanged with Potter last night as he tries to roll his eyes with disdain, although he can feel his face heating up with embarrassment. “Anyway. He came to dinner. I apologised. You won’t see him again.”
During the week, the separate practices become less and less useful. Wood seems to be under a perpetual thundercloud, and Harry starts to worry that he might quit. It’s not like Parkinson’s tied
“Yes, a lot of time,” Holber assures him. “Ever since…” he trails off, and then glances around quickly, and Harry’s not sure if he’s looking to see if he might be overheard, or trying to find something he might be able to punish himself with for saying too much.
careers Hermione’s gently suggested over the years. He just wants the sound of a Quaffle whistling through the air and the glint of a Snitch bobbing just out of reach.
“Dobby?!”
When they get there Hogsmeade is covered in snow and looks like a fairy-tale. It reminds Harry of some of his very good memories of coming when he was at school. The staff at Nymphadora House are delighted to see them both, but the children who live there are far more awed by the arrival of the star chaser for the Harpies than anything Harry’s ever achieved. Harry and Ginny stack their gifts under the tree, play several dozen games of Exploding Snap, and leave with bags of homemade Christmas decorations.
“Time,” Luna shrugs. “It’s not good to stay in that sort of stasis for so long, and without knowing exactly what she’s been exposed to, poor Draco is working against the clock.”
wait for my instructions.”
In theory, seven professional Quidditch players ought to be able to absolutely destroy three unsigned, unsanctioned rogues, but Draco’s friends leave the Arrows in their wake on the very first play.
“Oh thank fucking Merlin there’s food,” he hears a voice behind him. “You left me nothing but stew and that awful dandelion tea Luna likes.”
“That’s
Although he supposes there’s only one Malfoy left now. It’s not like Lucius is ever seeing the outside of a cell. And Narcissa… Harry pours himself another finger of whiskey. He’d vaguely intimated to Andromeda that he’d join her and Teddy for dinner this evening, but he doesn’t feel like company any more.
For one terrifying moment, Harry thinks the founders might be here to stop them, but then it’s as if the castle’s rebellion starts to quiet a little. The floor feels more solid underfoot, and he no longer feels like he needs to shout to be heard. Which is just as well, because they’re moving into the final, most complex part of the ritual. The part they’ve only just finished altering.
Ron shakes his head. “Lucius is a buffoon, but he’s not dangerous or he’d still be in prison. I saw him when he was released. He’s a sad old man, really. He’s got no power or influence with anyone anymore. Just likes the sound of his own voice.”
“How did you—”
them fixed properly. I just needed the vault sorted so I can go home.”
“Mister Malfoy leaves the party and doesn’t so much as come back to collect your ironing." Kreacher sniffs in the direction of the washing basket, and Harry can only wonder what of Malfoy’s he’s been harbouring all this time.
“Neither of you have been Obliviated,” she confirms. “There is a trace of something I’m not familiar with though. She holds out her own hand and casts, murmuring to herself. And then she gestures to Ron and Hermione. “May I?” and repeats her wand movements.
On Tuesday he gives his alarm Snitch a solid backhand that dents it slightly and causes it to fall to the floor. He knows from bitter experience that the damage won’t last, but he decides to roll over and get what sleep he can before it revives itself.
Narcissa’s shoulders sag a little with relief, but it only makes her seem even more tired and frail.
He orders himself a gin and tonic, settling in at a table with Hannah to catch up. She’s been the matron at Hogwarts for a couple of years now, and always makes him laugh with her tales about the idiotic situations her students get themselves into. She manages to get Draco nostalgic for a simpler time, when the worst thing that could happen to any of them was to be turned into a ferret, or to vomit up slugs.
“The truth is, the last time we all gathered here, six interlopers cast a spell on all of us.”
Padma frowns. “If they’d broken the curse, someone would have told us. It’s our case.”
He twists his napkin in his lap. His hands feel clammy with sweat.
“Yes. Well. We’ll get the wards at your home re-checked and strengthened, obviously.” Dawlish scribbles some notes on a bit of parchment in his tiny, cramped script. Harry can’t make out what they say.
“I bought a wreath today,” he finds himself saying, still staring puzzled at the calendar. Rose is already down off her steps and gone before he’s finished the sentence. She’s back a few minutes later, carrying the wreath and insisting he follow her to the front door.
Harry’s about to follow to see if he’s okay, but Sato catches his arm gently. “Give him a moment, Auror Potter. He needs to … catch his breath.”
“You’re a private investigator, Mr Potter?” Mrs Malfoy manages to make it sound both like a dubious profession and also as if Harry himself might not be sure if that’s his job.
. When I repaired the rings I used… elements of my own magic. My memories of you. The way I felt for you. I even used my old wand, the one you mastered. I’m not sure what’s happened but I’m guessing all of those things have worked their way into the house magic here at the cottage, and it’s left you thinking… you have feelings for me… when you don’t.”
Harry tries to picture the mystery man and fails, even though the description sounds vaguely familiar. He grimaces. “That’s... Something to go on.”
The final straw, however, were the events from a year ago, back when the whole DMLE was on high alert, working full force on dismantling a huge smuggling operation consisting of a complex network of suppliers in both magical and Muggle London’s underbelly. Harry was running on fumes, fueled by stress, instant ramen and four hours of sleep a day. When he finally had a moment alone to breathe between all the raids and visits to St Mungo’s, Harry had to resort to the only relaxation method he knew that was quick, effective, and feasible in the privacy of his own bloody office. The price to pay for the short-lived endorphin high he so desperately needed could have been painfully, embarrassingly high—he was sitting behind his desk with both hands in his pants when he heard a knock on the door.
He scoffs. “Come on, Auror Potter, that’s an easy one. You’re
Something fiery clenched inside Harry’s stomach, a desperate, consuming want setting his nerves on fire. “Do you want to stop?” he asked, so quietly there was a chance Draco had missed it. What he definitely didn’t miss, though, was Harry’s own erection, slowly hardening under Draco’s hot, questioning gaze.
about him, something Harry hasn’t noticed earlier. He looks too grown-up for twenty-seven, too
Draco turns so he’s facing Harry, propping himself up on his hands behind his back, as if he knows exactly what he is doing in those joggers—knowing Draco, he probably does. “And why is that?”

He palmed at Draco’s throat, feeling his Adam's apple bob up and down and reached around for Draco’s cock with his other hand.
for the prince to, ah,
“Hello.”
“But let’s go back to Maggie for a moment, though,” Ron says.
When they broke apart, Draco’s eyes flashed red right before he closed them and Harry knew he wasn’t supposed to see it.
“Malfoy,” Harry cuts him off. “Those are the conditions and they’re not up for discussion. We’re doing you a huge favour here so you can either take it or leave it,” Harry says in a final tone.
Harry’s heart does skip a beat, actually, but the reason for that is foggy at best. The room feels hot and stuffy because of the fire and Harry runs a shaky hand through his hair. He thinks about Draco’s words and about how those things should feel like but also about Draco himself, about how well Draco understands him, and how far they’ve come to just be this: two close friends on the sofa, having tea, talking the night away by the fire and just enjoying each other’s company.
, each thrust punching the breath out of them. Harry held Draco by one hip, his other hand wrapped around him, across his shoulders, nose buried in the warm dip of Draco’s neck.
“When I’m not there, you only order from Scandale Royale, and that’s only on Fridays which means the kid’s either having scallops or starving. And the odds of scallops are one to seven.” He doesn’t comment on the breastfeeding as the image is already quite disturbing in itself and Harry shudders to think there might exist some Spells to facilitate that particular process when one finds themself lacking in the lactation department.
“What do you mean?”
“Isn’t it?” Robards asks. “People live in fear, under a government that’s unable to protect them. The Ministry is running around in circles like chickens with their heads cut off and in the meantime, their loved ones keep disappearing. And then, the only person they know would never let this happen disappears for eight weeks—just long enough to plant another seed of mistrust towards those who deem themselves the
They leave the restaurant and Harry’s heart almost jumps out of his chest, he’s nauseous with the prickling ice that fills his stomach as the truth he felt in his heart for a while, finally dawns on him—Harry, in all his confusion and utter stupidity, has completely, tragically, abysmally fucked everything up.
Harry coughs. “Excuse me?”
“Dance with me,” Harry whispered, sliding his hand into Draco’s.
“It’s not Draco! Okay?” Harry raises his hands, stopping that particular train of thought, face already burning. Harry wonders when or how his assistant started giving him dating pep talks and thinking it’s for Draco, of all people—
(See the end of the chapter for
“Really?” Harry asks weakly.

“Potter,” he sighs. “Look, there’s a bar down the road—I saw it when I was at the store. You will Glamour us nice and tight, I’ll try to behave, and if all else fails, you have that lovely cloak of yours, yes?”
“We can’t, Draco,” Harry says tiredly, speaking, even though his arm feels like it's about to fall off. “Can you Apparate us? At least a hundred miles, for now,” he asks, letting himself lean on the firm muscle of Draco’s shoulder. He doesn’t want to let him know that his warmth is welcome for some reason, he doesn’t want to huddle closer or face him, but Harry does it anyway and notices there’s a trickle of blood on Draco’s forehead. He fights the urge to wipe it off with his thumb.
“He was suspicious, okay? I was—” Draco huffs, running his hand through his hair. “I saw him watching us, and I just. Well. Old habits die hard, yes?”
Draco cuts him off. “I know you’re not,” he says firmly. “Honestly, of all people…”
“A year, huh?” Harry murmured, inhaling the sweet honey-patchouli scent Draco always seemed to emanate. The telly was turned down to a low, buzzing background noise and Harry could hear Draco’s calm breathing and the soft, pleased purr he let out at his gentle ministrations. He slipped his hand under Draco’s tee and palmed at the place where his heart beat steadily against his ribcage.
,” Draco murmurs privately, his words brushing softly right against Harry’s temple at the awkward angle. He tries not to shudder at the pleasant warmth and absently notices that Draco’s breath smells really nice, and not at all like hyacinths, not even close. It’s somehow chocolate-y and Harry darts an unhappy look at his beer and then at Draco’s wine, regretting his beverage choices. Maybe Draco would let him have a taste.
“Erm,” Harry tilts his head. “There’s this spell, you know? It’s called
,” he gasped, thighs already shaking as Draco massaged his hole with the pad of his index finger, and buried his nose in the soft flesh between Harry’s thigh and his cock. Gods, he smelled amazing there, his scent was the strongest in that intimate place, heady and delicious. Draco dived back in, laving his hole with hard, stabbing licks, until he breached the muscle and slid his tongue inside.
The sight of an unmistakable bulge tenting Draco’s trousers, however, prominent and straining at the dark fabric, made Harry’s own cock twitch.
Harry broods alone in their hotel room, with an old radio and the sound of the shower running as his only companions, and thinks how, once again, his innate desire to follow his gut rather than any rules of gods or men is awoken from its deep slumber by Draco Malfoy and his uncanny ability to drive Harry insane. He worries that before these eight weeks are out, something big will happen—and this time, it won’t be mobsters or hitmen pushing them together to the same side. This time, they may go willingly, and that scares the shit out of him.
“I— I’m not sure, it just works for me,” Harry admits, feeling uneasy. He’s never done it to someone else, only himself, and hopes he won’t make it any worse.
says you are.
“Did you two…” She trails off, looking at her hands in her lap.
Ginny turns ashen. “She says that? About my dad? No, wait,” she raises a hand, shuddering. “I don’t want to know. Harry,” she turns her attention back to him, clearly distraught with the mental image of her parents getting in on. Serves her right. “So I’m assuming his age would be a problem?”
They keep it up nonetheless.
Before Harry can get the conversation back on track, there’s a loud knock on his door and without waiting for his ‘I’m busy’, Ginny Weasley barges in with a content smile, Luna treading lightly behind her. Ginny plops down in one of the armchairs to the side, never taking her eyes off Harry, while Luna bends down over Draco to wrap her arms around his neck and kiss the top of his head, their blond hair mingling together into a shiny, moonlight mess. Draco smiles a genuine, soft smile up at her and Harry is transfixed for a second but then, Ginny pointedly clears her throat, smiling mischievously.
“You remembered,” Draco whispers against his mouth, not giving Harry any time to respond, diving back in and coaxing a moan out of him. He hoists Harry up onto the counter to bring them closer together and Harry groans as he wraps his legs around him. “Of course, I remembered,” he breathes, baring his neck for Draco to mark.
Potter is an eleven.
—it’s a kind of charming obliviousness and series of moments where it takes him a second to catch Draco’s convoluted meanings (and Draco doesn’t really blame the man, seeing as he’s a wizard not only with his wand, but also his cock
Harry sighs with resignation. “And there it is.”
He doesn’t move, just sits propped up against the headboard and stares, taking Harry in, his eyes roaming over every inch of inked skin, tracing every line and shape with a careful glance. His mouth is slightly open and his breaths are coming out shallow.
Harry was quiet for a while, murmuring ominous incantations and taking notes in his file every two spells or so. He was using a Muggle pen and Draco was briefly distracted thinking about how stupid some wizarding quirks and traditions were. “You’re doing something good here,” Harry finally said, looking up and down Draco’s body splayed in the chair. It made his skin tingle, eliciting an obstinate itch to either spread his legs a little wider or cover himself from head to toe. Anything, really, to make something happen.
There was a rustle of paper as Potter skimmed his files. “I didn’t see it on the list,” he said.
“What else…” She taps her finger on her chin. “Jawline? As in… a pronounced one?” She gestures helplessly. “I’m shit at this. Luna?”
After a while, he gently disentangles himself from Draco, sits on his haunches, and starts unbuttoning his own shirt.
“Are you insane?”
How he stays so fit is beyond Harry—Draco always looks impeccable in his bespoke tailoring, fitted shirts and matching waistcoats, no matter the ungodly amounts of sweets he’s capable of shovelling into his mouth. Harry’s best guess is some weird pure-blood genetic thing, manifesting due to Draco’s ancestors having to sit on their arses all day, having tea and tiny, fancy cakes and still having to look good for all the arranged marriages they had cooking up behind the scenes. All of it was history and yet still managed to leave Draco with an enviable metabolism and immaculate hair while regular humans had to resort to exercise and coming to terms with never experiencing what an actual haircut feels like.
“I suppose I had it coming,” he says calmly, not daring to look up.
“We’re back from Magical Games and Sports,” Luna supplies, grinning in delight and taking Ginny’s hand. “Ginny finally got them to lift the ban on male cheerleaders!”
“Come here, mate!” Harry exclaims and jumps on top of Ron, laughing at his friend’s shrieks and cries for help.
,” Ron says. “Can you imagine though? Shagging someone while on duty? Couldn’t focus, I reckon.”
They get a room—it’s nothing special but still looks nicer compared to the first hotel. Two beds, a clean ensuite bathroom, and the hotel even offers breakfasts which Draco immediately insists they pay extra for. Harry’s too tired to argue about public money with him right now so he also throws in a ridiculously overpriced bottle of whiskey, reasoning they might both need it. They stumble inside their room and Draco deposits him on the bed that’s furthest from the entrance, despite Harry’s weak protests, barking that it’s closer to the bathroom and adding that he’s not waking up to the sun in his eyes after the night he’s had.
Recognising his friends before they even enter the office is a fun game Harry plays to pass the time between meetings and the occasional mission in the field, and those have been scarce since his promotion—perhaps Harry missed them a little but not as much as he
“What happened here?” Ron breathes out, wand already out.
Harry wonders if the Family has anything to do with the Wizengamot’s relentlessness, wonders how many judges could be corrupt enough to vote this through. Two months is such an inconvenient amount of time for the DMLE, there must be more leaks in their department than Harry’s ready to accept. Two months is not nearly enough time to catch all the perpetrators. It’s going to be a nightmare of a task and Robards informs Harry that there will be no task force this time.
, Harry—” He moves to the other nipple and sucks it in between his teeth and Harry’s spine arches as if trying to push it further into Draco’s mouth, to get more of whatever he’s giving.
He can tell Draco wants to say something, maybe that he likes what he’s seeing, maybe wants to learn it, too. It makes Harry’s palms sweat. He wonders what Draco would say if he ever knew about the Concealing Charms. About his tattoos.
. His hole tingled with an almost electric sensation, and perhaps some mysterious Veela magic was at play here—all the things happening inside his foolish, stuttery heart, though, those were all Harry.
“What all rich people do in places like this—he was looking for drugs,” Draco says, like it’s something obvious. “I knew that look instantly.”
The only sounds in the room are their mingled gasps and whimpers, and the filthy slap of flesh against flesh as Harry drives his hips forward in savage, unyielding thrusts. He holds Draco by the shoulders and fucks into him, watching, transfixed, as his cock disappears inside him, watches the lube and precome gathering around Draco’s hole, dripping down his balls and thighs. He’s a fucking force of nature, arching into Harry’s touch with his head thrown back, moaning with every ruthless push, his back damp with sweat, hands still clenched around the polished wood.
Draco’s shivering, his legs barely keeping him in position, and Harry adds his tongue alongside the two fingers, adding to the stretch and laving his abused hole with wet, gentle swipes of tongue.
?” Harry asks, unable to help himself—he knows it’s not protocol, he knows there are more important questions he should be asking but nothing about Draco Malfoy and his twisted ways was ever ordinary.
“What would you call it?” Ginny asks.
“Shit,
Harry inclines his head. “There isn’t one. Once it closes with someone inside, it can’t be opened with any spells, only with the key. This one, to be exact,” he says, showing Draco a simple metal key he’s just fished out of his pouch, a little tarnished with age but still fully functional. He wiggles it in the air and puts it back into his jacket pocket.
Harry feels his cheeks burn as Draco plants a light kiss on his shoulder. “Pancakes,” he says and clears his throat. “Cinnamon. Because—”
in it, you’re—”
“Draco,” Harry says quietly. Draco raises a brow, listening. “Why are there no women here?”
Warm fingers wrapped around his elbow and Draco was led to the large sofa that stood against the window. Harry sat them down and started casting without a word, the complicated incantations falling off his tongue in a gentle susurration, and the tense crease in his brow slowly dissipated when the diagnostics didn’t indicate any harm. It was awfully distracting, to have him so close, with his scent, and voice, and that jacket with the onyx clasps, and all Draco could do was clench his teeth in that familiar, aristocratic way so no-one would notice. What was worse, Potter was entirely non-smug about it—just calm and focused, casting with razor-sharp efficiency and he looked so bloody
After some good-spirited bantering, they order their lunch and their day together seems like all the ones before it. Only this day is the first where Draco gets to hold Harry’s hand, where he’s allowed to kiss him and go home to spend the night with him. And when nobody's listening, Draco will tell Harry he loves him and Harry will always say it back.
Harry’s eyebrows go up. “Is there a problem?”
They kiss again, Potter’s tongue thick and hot in his mouth, his beard rubbing at Draco’s skin, mottling it pink and making it tender, and Draco wonders if he’ll feel it tomorrow, and if it would feel as good between his legs.
“Tosser,” Harry laughs and hits him with the closest pillow. Draco grabs it and they play-fight over it until it flies to the coffee table, almost knocking over a glass bowl placed in the middle. They freeze and watch it swivel dangerously until it settles down with a warning thud and they both chuckle, quietly settling back, with Harry’s knees against Draco’s thighs, facing each other.
“It’s an
It’s not that Harry was a creep (he dearly hoped he was not). And it wasn’t wings in general, he supposed. But seeing Draco, pale and perfect, and his wide, terrified eyes at the two additional limbs springing out his back had awakened something in Harry himself. Draco had basically sprinted to Harry’s Floo, hastily thanked him for the drinks, and bolted before Harry had a chance to take a proper look or the wings to fully emerge.
“I still can’t believe it’s Malfoy, of all people,” Ron says, shaking his head. Harry hums in response around his half-eaten sandwich.
“It’s,” Harry huffed with some sort of relieved amusement, putting his wand down. “It’s perfume. Magical, but still—just perfume.”
Draco smiles softly and then it turns mischievous. “You never got to tell me how that date went.”
Malfoy lets out a shaky gasp as Harry mutters the incantation, and looks down at his hand, almost touching but still keeping the distance, and his mouth opens around a question he doesn’t ask. Harry’s not sure how he would know the answer anyway.
Draco doesn’t say anything but he turns around and points to a shelf in the far corner of the room, where a neat row of labelled vials was placed, presumably by Draco himself. Harry recognizes the labels—it’s the kind the DMLE uses to file evidence.
, Potter.”
!” he hisses through clenched teeth, startling a laugh out of Harry.
Harry tries to sit more comfortably and hisses at the pressure on his injured arm. He pats around for his wand, thinking it’s time he gets to fixing himself up after the short breather he’s taken.
They’re mulling about the laboratory on a boring Wednesday afternoon, with Draco feeling restless and generally distracted, and Potter doing… Potter things. He walks around with a pout Draco wants to bite down on, frowns and squints at the equipment, and sucks on his quill entirely too vigorously over his paperwork, in the maladroit way Potter sometimes just
“And now, I’m choosing you,” Draco says and kisses him, turning them around and pressing Harry against the wall.
his purpose, he had become lost in it. Harry had almost missed it, had almost let himself fall into a life of doing what everyone else thought he should, rather than what he believed in. With the sweat of the sex they’ve just had still drying on his temples, Harry realises that Draco was right about more things than he cares to admit. And that realisation is capable of shifting his whole life.
, just where Harry wants him to, mindful not to hurt him. Draco’s eyes are wide, gleaming with surprise, and Harry’s skin crawls with want at the rapid rise and fall of his chest, at his quiet, confused arousal. Harry takes one step, and the next twists into Apparition, landing him right on top of Draco whose surprised gasp is immediately stifled with a bruising kiss.
“Please,” Teddy whispers, his eyes nearly closed.
“What does your Amortentia smell like?” He blurts out, turning his head just in time to watch concern give way to complete mortification on Draco’s face.
“Fuck,
Eventually, not much is said at all, not after Draco invites himself into Harry’s shower and then proceeds to take him apart piece by piece, moving them onto the bed afterwards. They end up thoroughly christening the room, with Draco in his lap, chest-to-chest, his long legs wrapped around Harry’s waist, as they slowly rock back and forth with Harry’s cock buried deep inside Draco. They collapse to sleep hours later, sweaty and worn out, with angry red scratch marks still hot across their backs. The bloody ceiling mirror remains unmentioned.
Harry laughed, the sincerity of it rumbling deep in his chest. “Hey, woah. Lay off poor Sandra.”
“I’m saying it’s irresponsible to think it will go exactly how we expect it to every time.”
of them can participate. “Just—”
“Am I—” Draco swallows thickly and exhales. “Am I the first person to ever see them? To ever see you like this?”
. He gives it a few more thrusts, a few more deliberate prods at Draco’s prostate, grinning against his neck as Draco shakes and curses him to hell and back.
Harry bites his lip. He wasn’t expecting that, but all the things Draco is telling him are filling him with a strange sort of joy as Harry slowly starts to understand what Draco is trying to say. “Yeah, I get it, Draco.”
. I taught my house-elves how to make tea like they do, even bought an antique samovar, and never went back to the ways of my English forefathers,” he says, his lips curving into a mean smile. “I hope Lucius is having a blast, rolling in his grave.”
Harry was, indeed, staring because, well, there was a pair of
“You don’t fucking say,” Malfoy croaks.
His friend shrugs. “I don’t think Seamus and I know anyone suitable since… y’know, most of the clients at the Wheezes shop are kids,” he grimaces. “I just wish you gave your flower to someone worthy, mate.”
It’s a casual thing, and they never stay over.
There’s a pause that stretches for too long before Harry snaps. “Well?”
“Although I s’pose I can understand why people do it?”
He bends down for a kiss, slow and tender, feeling Draco shiver under him. “Hi.”
Harry takes Freddie, who’s already looking a little droopy, his eyes closing more and more, and the three of them step inside the bedroom. Harry carefully puts the baby in the crib and strokes his tiny, adorable little face until he settles. It doesn’t take long before he’s fast asleep and they leave him there, setting an Alarm Charm in case he wakes up. They talk quietly and Draco once again proves to be that soft, calming presence that makes everything a little bit more bearable—although he would probably scoff at the fact that being able to keep his voice down is an achievement in Harry’s eyes.
He opened his eyes.
The nonsense that is going on with his heart, however, is a completely different story.
, when it comes to… wings,” he gritted, though his anger didn’t really feel like it was aimed at Harry, rather at the whole world and the conundrum he had found himself in. “And I— I’m having trouble doing it myself. Veela usually have… companions, for that. And— I can’t reach so far behind my back, it’s physically impossible to do it properly, and it’s getting itchy, and they look terrible, and all of this is driving me
Harry pauses. “Be… yourself, I guess?”
Harry suddenly feels hot, and there might be some sweat trickling down the back of his neck and under his collar. There has to be a paragraph for this, manipulating an officer of the law, or, or— misleading one, or spreading misinformation. Harry fidgets uncomfortably in his seat, unsure if he should vehemently deny everything, risking looking stupid if they already suspect what Harry really thinks, or just be casual about it and say it like it’s something obvious. But what would that mean for Harry? It’s one thing to
.” Draco snickers knowingly as he moves to lean on the backrest, balancing his glass between slender fingers.
They were neither strangers nor friends these days, and it shouldn’t have felt so easy because Draco was a difficult fucking person, with all his quirks and being so hard to read. Their departments were on the same floor and they sort of absently fell into a strange acquaintanceship where they never questioned it and neither said they should stop. Harry watched him carefully—always had, when he thought about it—and Draco watched him right back but that scrutiny made Harry feel like he was a museum exhibit or a very expensive vase gathering dust someplace resembling Malfoy Manor. He supposed he could understand it on some level, the way Draco shook his head and muttered about reputation whenever an intern turned into a spluttering mess when they passed the front desk on their way back from lunch, or when the Prophet managed to snap a picture of Harry with a faceless fling he would forget about as soon as he snuck out the door the next morning. He wanted Draco’s reservation to be a
“I want you,” Harry whispers, his heart hammering in his chest with the implication of what he’s about to ask.
“You really worked with them,” Harry breathes, eyes skimming over the parchments. “And—you sat on all this—for how long?” Harry can’t stop staring at the lists of names, at all the evidence it would take the DMLE
“Mm,” Harry nodded against his scalp and tightened his hold around Draco’s waist for one more second. He was almost painfully hard, having slowly rutted against Draco’s thigh for the past ten minutes, felt his cock heavy and sticky in his pants. “Want you.”
“There's life in the old dog yet, as Ginny’s mum likes to say,” Luna says sagely.
“You’re so tight, oh my god, you feel so good,” Draco chokes out and kisses him messily and Harry can feel him shaking and trying so hard to stay put, to make absolutely sure he’s not going to hurt him and something hot and consuming clenches inside his chest. He tucks a stray lock of white hair behind Draco’s ear and cups his cheek, brushing it with his thumb. “I love you. Now, move.”
“They didn’t want Draco. It was never about Draco, it was—”
They say their goodbyes, and Harry thanks her for the lunch and for inviting him over, and Amy says he can owl her if he’d ever want to do this again. Harry feels extremely bad as he flashes her a weak smile and makes up some work-related excuse to justify his rush in getting out of there, thinking he’s
Draco was already staring at him with trepidation when Harry came into the kitchen, after politely slamming the door in the Vault Man’s face. The apparent drop in Harry’s mood turned the air a little heavy and questions were bound to be asked, questions Harry would rather not answer, knowing Draco all too well.
Potter bit his lip, peering at Draco from under his shaggy, black hair. “I thought we could… hang out,” he said and huffed out a laugh that had no right to be so attractive. “And I’d get the chance to ogle
“Nice efficiency there, Auror Potter,” he drawls, his voice still a little hoarse. “One feels reassured, with their life protected by Wizarding London’s finest.”
, Potter,” he says quietly and Harry catches him absently running his hand over his ribs and lightly pressing his fingertips to the now faded marks. His face softens just a fraction and Harry quickly turns around.
, the love chair.”
“And I,” Draco hesitated but saw something (again, hypothetical) in Harry’s face. “I would wrap my legs around you.” And he did just that, in one swift move, pulling Harry closer with just his calves and Harry felt those long legs could wrap around him tenfold, squeeze all reservation out of him if Draco allowed it. “And. And—”
“I might have a place for cheeky brats who invite themselves,” Harry says, kissing him lightly.
was not informed about the shag closet than that it exists.
“Draco,” Harry says, more firmly this time, and Draco finally stops talking. Harry decides it’s maybe time to actually
use a cup of tea but then again, I wouldn’t even drink the water here,” he says with a grimace. In the next second, Harry almost jumps as Malfoy produces a wand, seemingly out of nowhere. In a blink of an eye, it’s just
“I think it’s very manly to be in touch with your emotions,” Luna pipes in with a sweet smile. The girls are sitting on the floor, Luna’s back to Ginny’s chest, with her girlfriend’s arms locked around her waist.
He’s going faster and faster as Draco’s breathing speeds up and his delightful, keening mewls ring in Harry’s ears like the filthiest litany. The hot water dribbles down Harry’s back and the sides of his neck, every scorching lash making him gasp and drive his hips forward to meet the steady pump of his fist. Draco must be getting closer, and so is Harry, and he immediately knows they will come at the same time, and squeezes his cock harder, all slippery with precome and the remnants of water. He wishes he could lay down comfortably, maybe add a slickened finger to the mix to feel his orgasm build hot and low, twist his insides and curl his toes in complete bliss, but this will have to do, and with Draco’s incoherent groans it’s still everything he could wish for. Harry hisses as the head of his cock catches on the calluses on his fingers on every downstroke; his vision blurs and it’s either the water or the sloppy, wet sounds he can hear as if Draco were right next to him, and then he hears something else. A broken whisper, dripping with urgent pleasure:
Potter tongues the seam of his lips, slides inside his mouth, and Draco moans softly, hearing a soft rustle. Potter opens one of the drawers with a wave of his hand and a bunch of silky, shimmering fabric flies into his outstretched hand.
“Yeah?” he asks in a small voice.
Draco watches him, eyes travelling across Harry’s face, careful and delicate, almost scared, like he’s expecting Harry to disappear. “I— “
Draco looks at him like he’s deranged, spluttering as he shakes his head. “Wha— This is what you— We have a lot of houses!” he scoffs, and Harry laughs, smacking his arse.
Harry felt his soul leave his body; he scrambled to tuck himself back in, not having to worry about any technicalities, with his erection having wilted in a fraction of a second. He had never zipped up his trousers so fast in his life and doing
“Granger, I always wondered how you’d have conducted yourself in Slytherin,” Draco says, squinting at her. Hermione wiggles her eyebrows at him and turns back to the group.
in a suit,” he complains, “and I’ll have
Draco is beside him in seconds, wrapping a strong arm around his waist, and he’s so warm Harry only then notices how cold he feels. “Shit,” he breathes, checking Harry’s arm. “Potter, are you going to faint?”
Draco’s gorgeous but it’s something entirely different to say it out loud. Somehow Harry thinks saying it would make it real, would make it known to the universe that Harry Potter thinks Draco Malfoy is beautiful and Draco would find out and Harry would have to leave the country. Draco doesn’t think that about Harry, he’s sure, and dropping a bomb with the words ‘
Draco does a double-take, turning to face Harry. “She has never asked
Draco nearly choked on his drink. He didn’t look at Harry when he quietly asked: “Did you—”
“There— Uh, Mr Malfoy, there, there was a knock on the door and it’s Mr Potter to see you—” He chokes out and Harry could swear he’s about to cry.
He snorts softly, feeling his smile doesn’t reach his eyes. “Hey, I had a pack of vending machine crisps yesterday.”
!” Harry cries out as Draco wraps his lips around his nipple, teases it with quick, hard flicks of his tongue and Harry’s insides contract with the pleasure of it, the sensation going straight to his cock, now fully hard again.
“No!” Harry says, a little defensive. “He’s just… exhausting.”
“Harry, language!” Hermione calls right before the door closes behind them. Harry can still hear Ron’s muffled voice for a few seconds, something along the lines of
So the flowers are here to stay. Indefinitely.
They’re very close. Draco can count Harry’s freckles and he makes a mental note to do it with his lips at one point, seeing that Harry has them in other places, too. Before Draco can weigh out the pros and cons of the situation, before he decides what the fuck they ought to do right now, Harry just smiles and leans in.
Harry’s having a dreadful day.
“Take this.” Kingsley reaches into his pocket and produces a small, empty vial. “It’s a Portkey. I can’t lift the anti-Apparition wards on the whole perimeter, it’ll just make it easier for them to get inside. Grab what you can and go,” he says quickly, pushing the vial into Harry’s hand.
“Ahh—h-harder,” Draco said on an exhale, arching his long neck but never moving forward, almost as if trying to keep his distance before the inevitable fall.
They move together in a devastating rhythm, bodies slick with their mingled sweat. Harry never expected that sex with someone could feel like this—it’s like crashing with an entire galaxy with Draco in its centre. He’s the single brightest star, his every move and gasp blinding and brilliant, his every kiss like liquid electricity, pouring over Harry’s skin as they take each other apart into atoms. And Harry just lets him, with a terrifying certainty that once his nerves are reduced to a puff of stardust, Draco will gather every single bright shard and put him back together with his eyes closed, mending the edges with the tips of his fingers.
And Malfoy has… changed. Harry does his best to conceal the curiosity that prompts him to stare at the changes ten years have made to his once arch-nemesis; it sounds ridiculous but Harry has always remembered his time in Hogwarts quite fondly, with all the shenanigans it included. As he regards his old school rival, memories and images flash through his mind in quick succession—midnight duels, Quidditch games, sneers and insults, and then, they twist and coil, become darker—there’s a pale, famished teenager with bags under his eyes, blood in a school bathroom. The stench of smoke as the Room of Requirement burns. Finally, two slim hands clasped together, tightening their hold as the judge says ‘dismissed’. The Draco Malfoy that sits before him looks nothing like his old self, only retaining his line’s noble bone structure—not classically handsome but still captivating, like a too-expensive watch that you’d be desperate to try on, but know you couldn’t afford to buy. He’s wearing posh Muggle clothes, probably the most expensive suit Harry has ever seen, and his hair isn’t slicked back the way he used to wear it—it’s tousled in a manner people pay good money for, and still a brilliant moonlight colour that makes his eyes stand out even more.
was good, but Harry was good at being told that he was and maybe he was getting a little desperate to actually act on it instead of settling on a flimsy ideal of what he could be. Draco wasn’t just playing hard to get, he was the hardest fucking person Harry had ever met while simultaneously thinking he didn’t deserve good things. Being next to Draco sometimes felt like being too close to the sun, like arguing with the wind, and Harry felt like a madman, trying to explain to the moon how its magnetism was keeping his tides alive.
Ron grimaces. “You two are always so… touchy,” he says from the bean bag chair he’s sprawled in.
“I see,” she purses her lips, looking like she has something more to say and is doing Harry an indescribable kindness by remaining silent. “Apparently, my eyes sometimes
Malfoy springs into awareness in seconds. “What?” he asks, and there’s a subtle note of panic there, his voice just a fraction too high to be natural. “They found me already? What are you doing?” He stares, a little helpless, as Harry comes up to him and grabs his shoulder to drag him out the door.
“So, this show, the broody one is clearly infatuated with the oblivious one—”
“What about you, Malfoy? I expected you’d know some eligible gays,” Seamus asks, looking at Draco with curiosity.
“Hey,” Harry says quietly. “You got the deal. You can take them down, I’m just here to make sure you get to.”
Everything feels like a fucked-up, surreal dream, so Harry splashes some cold water on his face.
Harry wakes up after a few hours of fitful sleep and more questions than answers. All day, the awful, sick feeling in his stomach makes him feel like he’s done something wrong and unable to forget about it, like there’s something he forgot and should have done ages ago. He blames it on his nerves, on the date he has later tonight, on a number of things that don’t really matter and it manages to stifle his conscience, albeit poorly, like slapping some Spell-o-Tape on a leaking dam.
Without any hesitation, Harry spreads Draco’s cheeks and swipes his tongue over his hole again, and again, feeling his thighs shiver so hard, Harry needs to shift a little to keep Draco pinned to the bed. Draco lets out a stream of broken pleas and curses, muffled by the pillow under his face, and Harry goes deeper, slipping the tip of his tongue inside him, twisting it with a hungry growl. He eats him ruthlessly, at a steady, devastating pace, saliva dripping down his chin, and Draco just lies there and takes it, mewling helplessly with his fingers twisted into the sheets.
going to the Aurors’ office, you’re going to a secure location until I know exactly what’s going on,” Harry says, already seeing Draco’s pale eyebrows ride up his forehead.
“She is!” Luna nods enthusiastically. “I’m so proud of her.”

Something clenches in his throat—saying so himself felt correct five minutes ago, so why does he feel like a traitor?
“Oh my god,” Draco stated, immediately turning his head away. Harry snorted quietly and plopped down on the empty barstool next to his.
“It’s—” Draco trailed off, swallowed. “It’s oil. Wings have…” he gestured vaguely. “Oil glands. To keep them smooth and clean, and— Yes.”
Draco is sitting in the revolving chair opposite Harry’s desk in his tiny vice-Head Auror office. He’s currently banging his fist on his sternum, choking on a biscuit he helped himself to right after he entered, not bothering to hide his unbelievable sweet tooth in front of Harry. Harry hesitates whether he should pour Draco a glass of water or watch the wanker choke to death, as right before this little incident, Draco almost tripped over backwards in the chair laughing after hearing about Harry’s disaster of a blind date.
Draco’s voice was hoarse when he spoke next. “Yeah?”
“I knew it!”
“Imagine—” The strange feeling doesn’t go away so Harry just powers through it, resolving to analyse it later (never). “Imagine the most… beautiful smell, one that brings Patronus-worthy memories?” It feels silly to describe it as such but he shoots a quick glance at Draco and Draco isn’t laughing—he’s staring at Harry with inexplicable somberness and for a split second, his face looks like his mind has gone somewhere else, before he refocuses on Harry.
Harry shifts back and hauls Draco upright to claim his mouth once again. With a racing heart, he slides Draco’s jacket off his shoulders as he sucks a bruise into his neck, laving the spot with hard, hot swipes of his tongue. The leather holster with the gun follows the jacket to the floor, its clatter echoing in the silent room. Draco is holding on to him for dear life, letting out soft, barely audible whimpers as he lets Harry devour his mouth again, and again, and again.
“He could have done anything he wanted with me and no-one would ever know,” Malfoy says and looks through the window again. “And—as much as it pains me to admit it—” He rolls his eyes. “He’s been nothing but kind. And—cherry on top—he is now tasked with keeping me alive until the trials,” Malfoys adds with a smirk.
the table… it’s about what
“It’s going to be okay,” he whispers against his lips.
“Jesus, Draco,” Zabini breathes, voicing Harry’s exact thoughts. “Are you… okay?”
. In other words, I recruited fresh meat which, I’ll have you know, is a downright barbaric way to describe my art.”
,” Draco sighs, earning a snigger from Dean and Seamus, “and molest Potter about his private life, or lack thereof, through socially inappropriate questions.”
“Potter—”
, too.
Lately, thinking about Draco when he was absent only made things worse.
Kingsley straightens as soon as he sees Harry and Ron approach.
—” Draco rocks his hips in time with the steady rhythm, letting out a harsh exhale when Harry adds another finger.
Seamus stares at her unblinkingly, an impressive feat with how droopy his eyelids were getting, until he just takes a gulp of beer, discouraged by a sharp, warning glance from Draco, of all people. Harry feels something warm expand in his chest because Draco is turning into a mother Dragon and that’s something Harry is absolutely going to tease him about later.
, one that’s meant to be intimidating, but even his faded Dark Mark looks like a funny skull peeking from under the rolled-up sleeve as it contrasts with his flushed cheeks and tousled hair.
“I might reconsider if we have that shower.”
“Don’t even start this—”
Harry opens and closes his mouth. “Point.”
Deflated, he asks: “Is he cross with me?”
—aaaa-ah-
“I’m a freak, aren’t I? A— A creature,” Draco said helplessly, side-eyeing the wing in his peripheral vision.
“What?!” Ron squeaks from his spot on the carpet.
“I don’t… write people off,” he mumbles, clinging onto the first thing he can think of.
“How the fuck did you find me?” he hears Malfoy whisper, voice shaky with nerves.
, do get your mind out of the gutter,” Draco says exasperatedly, reading Harry’s expression in a matter of seconds. “Not all gay men have slept with each other, you know,” he adds grumpily.
“The lad you set me up with, Archibald,” Harry starts. “Why him?”
He takes a few deep breaths to pull himself together but feels like there’s nothing left to pull—all the emotions Harry’s been trying to keep inside are spilling out, thinned with alcohol and skewed judgement. Harry’s feeling braver than he has in months, alight with the kind of resolve that has accompanied him through death itself, and in his momentary beer-addled stupor, he realises he’s going to say or do something incredibly stupid, and maybe just as bold.
There’s a warm hand on his shoulder, squeezing lightly. “I’ll stop you right there.” Draco looks at him seriously, his grey eyes a thunderstorm. “There’s
He can’t be. He has
The little curve turns into a proper smile. “Chocolate chip is basic. I like cinnamon.”
“I— Yeah, it’s fine,” he chokes out. “You didn’t know.”
The only shred of hope Harry could muster was that it could still miss them somehow. That they were out of range, a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things, not important enough to be bothered with. The siren kept wailing, people kept running back and forth, some crying, some tense and determined to save their loved ones, packing their families and what possessions they managed to grab into their cars and driving away.
As if on cue, Harry’s phone vibrates sharply against the table. He swipes it in a blink and walks into the bathroom, locking the door behind him. He can hear some indignant yelps and a cascade of offended babble but as soon as the door closes, Harry unlocks the screen.
Draco leaves the bathroom and Harry, probably for the hundredth time, fidgets nervously, mentally preparing himself to ask for the bloody wand. He’s seen Draco use it in almost every possible situation, from making tea, and correcting Harry’s spellwork, to opening the windows, and heating his takeout. And it’s not that Harry
They come down, panting heavily, and Harry bumps his nose against Draco’s and kisses him softly. It feels a bit surreal, how the machines are still working, and the lights flicker like they did minutes ago, and the world didn’t end like Harry maybe expected it to.
Ron clears his throat. “So. Apparently, people use it to shag in. Can you believe it?” he asks incredulously, as if he was more offended at the fact
“Lust Potion.” Draco swallowed thickly. “So. Is it working? Do you feel a sudden and urgent need to have your way with me on this couch?” He asked, unable to stop himself, and even managing a slight smile.
It doesn’t stop Harry from being curious.
“But—”
is doing fantastic, what’s more, he’s running away with the love of his life, who’s probably young, tan, ripped, and has good hair. Harry pictures them in the Bahamas, Archie rubbing sunscreen on smooth, lickable biceps, the lotion on his veiny, arthritic hands glistening in the Caribbean sun. Tanned himbos are bringing them coconut drinks and in the meantime, Harry masturbates his youth away using his own tears as lubricant.
He hiked up Harry’s leg over his shoulder and Harry cried out as the angle changed, digging his fingers into the soaked sheets. Now that he had access, Draco’s hands massaged along Harry’s legs, rubbing soothing circles into the overheated skin, a stark contrast against the unrelenting thrusts of his hips. He turned his head, kissing and licking over Harry’s foot and ankle, brushing his lips at the side of the arch, and went lower, nosing at the coarse hairs on Harry’s calf. Harry had never considered his legs or feet to be erogenous zones but holy fuck, it felt so good, so sensual, the smallest touch set his body further aflame.
“You’re staring,” Draco said in a low voice and placed a reverent kiss on his sternum.
“I saw you watching.
Draco’s brows knit into a deep frown. “Why… would it be?”
Malfoy barks out an arrogant laugh. “Finally, a competent Auror!” he says, smirk still plastered to his face. “Ten years have passed and you’re still as sharp as the
It’s not that he’s ashamed. It’s not that he doesn’t trust his friends. It’s just… Personal. After his last session, it took him a few days to bring himself to take a full look in the mirror, to be ready—for what, Harry wasn’t sure. It was a chapter closing, a new one opening, it was purification, conservation; it was tying the memories of his past to the ideals he wanted to carry into his future.
Malfoy stares at him in shock. “Potter, you can’t—”
Harry looks down at his hands, carefully folded in his lap. “Yeah.” He feels a hot flush crawl up his neck and face, setting him aquiver. He waits.
“Potter, give me my wand!” Malfoy shouts, and Harry notices his hand is trembling, the slightest twitch of his fingers, something that could easily be blamed on the cold. The truth, however, is lurking in his eyes—wide and shining with barely restrained panic as if they didn’t leave that thunderstorm behind at all.
“And we want you to get laid, mate,” Seamus adds.
Ron pipes up at that, clearly eager to tell Harry the story. Harry smiles weakly, welcoming the distraction. “So get this, Zabini came to me, saying he had heard something and that he promised he’d come to me if he heard any aliases. He picked up on some conversation, they said: ‘
“No,” Harry whispers and pulls him up by the shoulders. Scrambling for purchase, Draco props his hands up on the headboard and throws his head back, giving Harry access to his neck—he hungrily grazes his teeth over the soft skin, inhaling that impossible smell with his eyes closed, holding Draco’s shoulders in one folded arm and now driving three fingers into him with the other. He’s almost satisfied with the prep, mindful of his above-average size, and feels his cock swell at the thought of burying it in that tight heat, of fucking Draco, of being
“Jean from Muggle Affairs, funny Thomas, Wizengamot James,” Ron starts listing, craning his neck to look straight at Harry while he does.
Struggling a little at first, Harry managed to send a text message with an address and a question, signing his name at the end. Being a paranoid law enforcement officer, magical or not, he made sure he deleted the message after sending it. Maggie must have seen the heartfelt gratitude on his face when he handed the phone back because she shot him a bright smile, they exchanged a few pleasantries, and the babysitter from the Shrieking Shack was gone.
Draco looks at her, a mix of polite surprise and amusement evident in his face, even with the Glamour on. “Do you always approach strangers like this?” he asks with a raised brow. “Shouldn’t you be supervised?” As if to support his point, he looks around, probably scanning the crowd for a parent or some sort of guardian.
“Correct,” Draco says with an air of authority. He did indeed have the expertise; eight long years spent ogling his fellow students in the Quidditch lockers (when he wasn’t busy doing a madman’s bidding) had made Draco quite an expert on the matter, and his new co-worker is a truly superb specimen. The Unspeakables switching from their usual haughty, vicar-ish robes to those tight black jackets was a true godsend, too (he religiously adjusts his own every morning, just a little on the snug side—alas, it has gone tragically unnoticed as of yet).
Malfoy notices his staring and has the audacity to
“I wanted you to come in there and touch me,” Draco whispers, his hands roaming over Harry’s stomach. “I wanted you
“They could have killed you,” Harry hisses.
Suddenly, Harry feels a little bad. “Draco.”
It’s the best fuck they’ve had so far and they haven’t got to the actual fucking yet—in his lust-addled state, Harry decides that if all foreplay looked like this, no-one would ever care about coming. Then again, he’s the one bastard lucky enough to be doing it with Draco Malfoy. Draco, who’s currently doing something so brilliant with his tongue, Harry’s whole cock feels like it’s on fire as he watches that perfect, lithe body arch beautifully for Harry to admire.
There’s just one more thing to be done.
they’ve made feels like the most real, sincere thing he’s done in months, maybe years, and he greets his old, rule-defying self like a beloved relative that’s been gone just way too long. Draco had questioned the way Harry navigates the world, and Harry hadn't had a good answer. Now, it's not the ‘sex and power’ shite, but Harry finds himself dusting off old memories of himself after the war, and discovering they weren’t worth it in the first place. He had been searching for purpose after the war, but that search had
but something that feels so good, they just can’t resist the temptation. Potter’s fingers pump in and out of his mouth and Draco has to stifle a needy whimper each time Potter’s hips stutter ever so slightly. The bloody maniac isn’t
Dean points his bottle at Harry. “Look at him, so eager to change the topic.”
In the end, nothing had happened in the laboratory. Well, nothing the Department could have logically fired them for (Draco, at least, Potter could probably piss on the Minister’s desk and they’d give him another Order of Merlin for exceptional bravery).
“We’re going to need to do laundry,” Harry says, not looking up from the magazine he’s aimlessly leafing through.
to babysit?! And we’re related by blood!” If there’s a little bit of hurt in his voice, Harry chooses not to address it for now, focusing on Draco’s childish ‘
“Harry. I meant I know you’ve never… got along. I know. But I trust your judgement,” Kingsley replies and for a brief second, Harry knows he’s talking to a friend, not the Minister of Magic. “Does he deserve that deal if all this checks out?” he asks and something churns in Harry’s stomach at the thought of Malfoy going free after aiding the actual mob. And yet…
Harry stops in his tracks, heart racing, as he frowns at his boss. He looks… almost sick. There are beads of sweat gathering at his temples, his Auror uniform is crumpled and askew, and the heavy, dark bags under his eyes make him look like he hasn’t slept in a week. Harry notices the slightest limp in his right leg as Robards takes a few torpid steps towards him, and he has never limped before. Several red lights start rapidly at the back of Harry’s mind, all of them bringing an unsettling feeling of
Harry reached for the lube and ripped the packet open with his teeth, then poured some over his fingers, and he didn’t want to wait for it to warm up, just slid his middle finger down between Draco’s cheeks and kissed away the sharp hiss it drew. “Tell me if it’s too much.”
fairy godmother comes to her in a dream and teaches her a recipe for a potion that will cure her beloved,” Draco rolls his eyes at Harry’s stifled laugh. “It’s not a good book, Potter, I told you.”
Harry rolled them over, finally letting Draco’s soft cock slip out of him and let out a soft whimper when it was immediately replaced by gentle, probing fingers massaging his stretched out hole.
They kiss, again, and again, and Harry wonders what has got into Draco, already feeling his own arousal take the reins. Draco’s on top of him, his moonlight fringe grazing Harry’s forehead and he’s looking at Harry like he’s the only person in the world, with surprised wonder in the slight shiver of his hand as he slides a thumb over his lower lip.
Harry tries not to think about the fact Draco has just called him sweet. Instead, he bumps their shoulders together. “You’ll like it, I promise.”
The use of his first name draws Draco’s attention and he turns to look at Harry. “He’s the one who bound me,” he snarls and with one, well-aimed kick sends Dmitri to his knees. “And now, the spell will finally be undone, won’t it, Mityushka? He hates when I call him Mityushka,” he adds with a dark chuckle.
wasn’t directly responsible for that, do you see?” Draco says, a strange wonder lacing his voice. He shrugs. “Not all of it, at least. So I came back for me, too, Harry. After the trial, I was finally my own person and it made me realise that there’s a chance for me, still. So I also left to have some space to think. About if I should... take that chance.”
Harry bites the insides of his cheeks, treating Draco with a deadpan glare.
“Fine!” Harry throws his arms up. “Fine, just— I make the rules. You will stay close, you will—”
“It’s odd, seeing you enjoy something
Their kisses grow in intensity and Harry finally finds some leverage—he grips Draco’s arse and grinds against him, once, twice, feeling that hot, hard length against his inner thigh. He knows the odds of them both coming in their pants like a couple of teenagers are growing with every minute, every time Draco rocks his hips and licks into his mouth. Harry wouldn’t mind it at this point, if only he didn’t know how much better it could feel with just a few… adjustments. Draco slides a cool, soft hand under his shirt and just leaves it there, ghosting over his ribs. Harry, in all his inexperience, deliberates if he should be the one to make that move, if maybe Draco feels like he shouldn’t push him, if the slight stutter to his movements has anything to do with restraint.
Malfoy just laughs. “I decided that it was time to… terminate my employment, so to speak.”
“Control your temper,” Robards finishes gruffly.
“What are you talking about? You chose a Draco look alike?” Harry wishes his idiot mouth would stop talking, wishes he never let himself be sucked into this conversation.
“How about we double the prize if Harry gets laid on the first date?” Dean asks.
“Oh, yeah, it’s pretty potent isn’t it?” She smiles sheepishly and points at the row of those disconcertingly familiar flowers. “Hyacinths. They smell beautiful, don’t they?”
The laboured breathing, the pink tips of his ears. And a slight tremble to his muscles, a little tremor in his wings that tried to reach out and curl back, nerve endings screaming to be grounded, to be held. Harry recognised that particular movement.
Draco goes strangely quiet and that can’t mean anything good. “Oh. I… I know him.”
Draco’s
“Come on Ronald, give me some love,” he says.
Until that one moment.
“Right. We should Obliviate them.”
Hermione yelps when Ron grabs her by the waist and tugs her down into his lap. She laughs as he holds her in a vice-like grip and buries his face in her jumper. “We’re almost done with all the—Ron!” She tries to wiggle out, helpless against her husband-to-be and his alcohol-induced burst of emotion. “With all the flowers,” Hermione says flatly, folding her lips into a thin line as if half of the world’s vegetation existed just to spite her. “I’m starting to hate all of them, honestly,” she adds with a sigh.
He hears some light footsteps and Neville’s friend (Amy, he reminds himself) emerges from between the greenery with a happy spring to her step. Immediately, it strikes Harry how kind and down-to-earth she seems; she’s wearing a pair of wellingtons but that’s about it in the gardening getup department. The rest is just a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. If anything, Amy looks more like a student than a Magical Botanist. Her blond hair is tied in a ponytail that bounces cheerfully as she approaches, and there are freckles all over her face that’s currently split in a wide grin.
Maybe Voldemort would be better, Harry thinks derangedly and wants to laugh. At least he knows how
A teenage blush was the last thing Harry needed right now but Draco didn’t budge. He leaned down for a kiss, eliciting a low groan out of Harry with the change of angle. “I wasn’t sure you—” Harry kissed him again, every lick like liquid courage propelling him through. “You’re so hard to read sometimes,” he finished lamely, too incoherent to focus on semantics.
Harry’s heart speeds up. “Did you want me to?”
“I want you,” Harry whispered into his ear, seeming undecided whether to lick or bite, overwhelmed with the possibilities.
, an acknowledgement just for them. Draco doesn’t look up but there’s a small smile tugging at the corner of his lips before he hides it in his wine glass.
“Harry, love,” Hermione says urgently, a shaky note lacing her voice. “They’re here, Harry, you need to let go now, let them help.” She gently tugs him away by the elbow until Harry finally relents, but not before tucking a bloodied, blond strand behind Draco’s ear.
frequents there are… yes. The walls have ears. That one wanted anonymity, for whatever reason.”
it, finds it so incredibly arousing to be manhandled like this, he groans into Draco’s mouth, fruitlessly trying to pick up the pace. The knowledge that Draco can overpower him, hold him down using just his thighs and arms, makes him dizzy with desire. He doesn’t need to be as careful as he would with a girl, not with the way Draco bites at the corner of his jaw and pins him to the couch.
“Why is Harry so late anyway?” Dean asks, fiddling with the menu. “It’s been, like, what? Half an hour?”
someone before!” He hisses, a little impatient. Ron narrows his eyes at him and Harry groans. “Mate, we were in a bloody dorm together, I told you those things!” He gestures wildly to Ginny who’s currently in the middle of a heated debate with the girls on the other side of the room. “I dated your sister!”
Draco lowered himself onto the bed as soon as possible, not bothering to hide his rush. Their collective moan at the skin-to-skin contact was muffled by hungry mouths and a thick canopy of feather and muscle poised over Draco’s back in a severe arch. Oil was slowly trickling down his flanks, in the valleys between his ribs, leaving a glossy curve over his iliac crest.
Draco watches him for maybe a second more and then he’s moving, positioning himself on top of Harry and looking him straight in the eyes. “You're going to kill me,” he whispers and gasps softly as the tip of his cock catches on Harry’s abused hole. He casts that lubricating spell again—Harry finds it incredibly hot that he can somehow do it wandless—and covers his cock in the pleasant-smelling gel, hissing as he touches himself. There’s a primal hunger in the way he looks at Harry as he lines himself up and buries his cock inside him in one smooth push.
“Ohh,” Harry gasps, “that’s right, don’t stop,” he says, grabbing Draco by the hair and kissing him hard.
“Malfoy,” Harry growls, his patience running thin. “Shirt. Off.”
Draco looks at him with pity. “I could have ten and I still wouldn’t be half the animal you are.” Ron laughs and flips him two fingers.
It dawns on Harry then—why Draco is reluctant to let him go, why he’s so clingy all of a sudden, what that serious glance actually means, and Harry’s heart stutters. He promises himself to make sure Draco will never have to doubt his feelings and the idea is so ridiculous in itself, Harry chuckles. “Which one?”
A stray
"Actually, I did," Draco says haughtily. Sod it, he’s either going to be right and get to see their faces or he’s going to be wrong and forced to leave the country and cut all ties with the people he knows, so the risk could be considered non-existent at this point. Draco very much hopes it’s the former rather than the latter.
He leaves Draco’s flat and it feels like he’s walking on clouds.
small… I wonder— If there’s not at least a little Slytherin in you after all,” he says.
“I think it was magic,” the kid says in a small voice, as if she’s been told it’s impossible far too many times, taking the leap and telling one more person about it, hoping they’ll hear her out.
With that, the Healer leaves with a swish of her robes and then, there’s just the two of them.
Draco can’t wait for all their next days.
“You’re spiralling,” Draco says calmly, the tiny crease between his eyebrows betraying his calm facade. “What are you thinking?”
He leaves his jacket in his office and treads down the hall to the Forensics Lab, clutching the bag with the brioches—an offering to appease the Dragon that dwells within. He knocks on the door twice, having learned his lesson to never just waltz into their workspace, let alone Draco’s private office. Harry wagers Draco keeps his subordinates (
Like so many times before, Harry wonders how this could happen. He tries to analyse the past seven weeks, to connect the dots of their way to each other as if it were a messy treasure hunt with its grand prize now peaceful and safe in Harry’s arms. As he traces his favourite mole on Draco’s hip, Harry realises he doesn’t need to look for a reason anymore—it’s been in front of him all this time, and it wasn’t so much a hunt—it’s been a toilsome labour of stripping down the walls of a fortress to get to the treasury deep within. A sinking feeling of being completely and utterly doomed tightens its fist around Harry’s stomach and Harry tightens his arms around Draco. The reason is so obvious, he almost chokes with the weight of it.
“If you don’t eat it with actual cutlery, on an actual plate, it’s a snack.”
, for lack of a better word, the results are entirely left to… well, chance. Ironic, isn’t it?”
“Not very dignified for a man of class like you,” Harry says seriously, running his hand through Draco’s soft hair, now finally free of dried blood, feeling the scab of his wound scratchy under the pads of his fingers. He kisses the spot, just because he can, with some amount of naive hope he could kiss it better.
Draco doesn’t meet his eyes, looking at vials with a bitter expression. “I know. As the vice-head Auror, you could legally come up to that shelf, pick up a flask and take a whiff. Any time you wanted.” He turns back to Harry, biting his lip. “And I, as the head of Forensics, cannot stop you without risking professional and legal repercussions.”
They’re walking through the atrium, just back from lunch where Harry told Ron all about his conversation with Malfoy. It was decidedly less official than with their bosses so Harry took some liberties with telling his friend how exactly he feels about the whole affair—he told Ron about Malfoy’s behaviour and was satisfied that someone got properly annoyed on his behalf, and about all the things Malfoy must be up to in Harry’s opinion.
“Don’t make me regret it,” she shakes her head.
He Levitates the bottles onto the bedspread with a soft clink and sees Malfoy side-eyeing them with trepidation. Drawing his wand, Harry sits down next to him and tilts his head with an unamused sigh. Malfoy finally lets his shirt slide off his shoulders and onto the floor and his moves are more fluid now, calmer. He doesn’t say another word, just sits and watches, taking long, measured breaths and smelling like almond milk.
Smiling, Draco pulls Teddy closer and lies him back against his chest. He reaches out and grabs him under his knees, opening his legs, as Teddy’s cock bobs wetly against his stomach. His hole is already wet and open, as pink as his lips, and Harry has the rare desire to just slam into him full force, to fuck the last breath out of him, so he grabs his own cock to ground himself and rubs the tip under Teddy’s balls, and slides lower.
, as if just seeing Harry like that is an unbelievable turn-on for him. Draco rubs against him, hissing at the pressure, and keeps fucking his fingers into Harry, keeps whispering strained encouragements.
’, or whatever, yeah? But Robards doesn’t have an owl, does he?”
Harry starts talking. He tells Draco about the lunch and about Amy, and he doesn’t skip the lab bit, knowing Draco would like to hear about it. The story gets a little stilted when he gets to the hyacinths part.
It’s not romance, it’s nurture. They take care of each other, they call him the sweetest names, and they make sure he knows
Draco just laughs—privately, quietly, his voice low and mellifluous and Harry wants to swallow the sound.
Harry runs a hand through his hair and stubbornly decides to keep his voice down no matter what. “Thanks again for letting me use your phone,” he says.
There’s a challenge in his voice that Draco immediately picks up on, like a cat arching its back in warning, seconds before attacking with a vicious hiss. “I wonder,” he says in a low voice. “What is your goal here? What does the great Harry Potter, protector of the little ones, the saviour of all that is holy, get out of this?” he asks and takes another step so they’re face-to-face, speaking in a soft, breathy voice. “Well, Potter? What is it in the end? Sex or power?”
“I’m amazed at your observation skills,” Harry deadpans. He lets Draco inside and closes the door. “Care to join the Aurors? We could use men like you,” Harry says, following Draco into the living room.
—for a fraction of a second, he peeks at the open magazine where a picture of none other than Harry Potter takes up the whole two-page spread. The Saviour still manages to look slightly uncomfortable in the moving photograph, smiling weakly as the interview title slapped across the page suggests yet another charity the man apparently can’t help but support.

“Look!” Luna points across the street to where a crowd is gathering on Islington Green. “We’re in time for the lights!”
Draco shakes his head. “It’s confusing for Teddy,” he says, when what he means is,
“But Malfoy—”
She frowns at him.
Robert hums in agreement, although he can’t shake the dull, deadened feeling of the space they’re in. Dry and old, like no one has been here in a long time. Like they shouldn’t be here at all.
Harry nods and leads the way, waving his wand to send the memorial sign back to wherever it came from and opening the gate. They force their way through the overgrown garden to the front door, which is still in one piece.
“Visibility in the lake is really bad, you can’t see much in front of your face. We should do something to keep together.”
It leaves them with very little to work with. If the killer simply deposited the weapon on a chair and walked out, there’s no smoking gun to be found, no bloodied knife buried in the garden. Nothing to link the suspect to the scene.
“They were worried that Salazar or one of his descendants might do something to endanger what they were building in the future. And their defence to that is woven all through the protective magic.”
Harry murmurs that they’re all fine, which might be a total lie, as he tries to think how he can direct the conversation to the puzzle they’re trying to solve.
“Yeah, I mean I could have,” he says, still not paying any attention to Draco or the way he’s frozen rigid in his chair, hands clenched tight in his lap. “But I mean, I guess I thought you still needed me to be here, at the cottage and whatever. And now you don’t. So I can go.”
“The thing about Quodpot is that you have to be much faster. Quidditch is more strategic, sure, but in Quodpot you need raw speed and agility. Or the Quod is literally going to blow up in your face. Here, let me show you.”
they’re not going to get along.
“You’re not fucked off?” Ron demands, presumably forgetting to moderate his own language around the children, and casting another wad of pages at the fire. “I’m mad as hell and it’s not even about me.”
He goes to Quality Quidditch and picks up the training broom he’d ordered for Teddy, and he ducks into Gringotts, bypassing the queues and sitting with the goblin in charge of trusts and estates to sign off the end of year paperwork for his donations to the War Orphanage. The whole time his knee bounces and his fingers flex and it’s all he can do not to just go to the DMLE and find out what is going on.
Luna emerges from the greenery with a Canonbury Academy scarf.
, which means spiral, and
“Well,” Luna leans back a little, as if pondering the question genuinely and taking no offence. “After the war, Draco wrote to me, to say sorry for everything that happened.”
..."“
“Yes. I want to cast some diagnostic spells on the house’s magic, and it would make things much simpler if you were there.”
He’s in so much trouble.
He finishes the first of the incantations and waits for the others to do the same. One by one, they fall silent until only Hermione is still casting. Harry looks to his left, where Draco is standing, eyes closed, his wand held loosely at his side. He looks calm, relaxed. It helps Harry to breathe a little easier.
“I’m really far too skilled a wizard for that,” Draco scoffs, pressing a kiss to his forehead. “Besides, I wouldn’t risk losing any part of you, now that I know what you’re good for.” His hand slides around under the covers as if to prove a point. Harry thinks it won’t be too long before he’s ready for round two.
It’s just one story. Harry will leave. Skeeter will find something else to catch her fancy. And in a few weeks, people will stop pointing at him in the street again. Probably. He takes a deep breath. He’s just tired. He’s spent too long with the rings this week and his core is overextended. He needs to finish this wretched job and then take a holiday. Somewhere warm, where he can sleep on a sun lounger all day.
She storms out of his office in a cloud of perfume and righteous anger, leaving Harry reeling.
Granger’s shoulders slump. “He was very affected by Cedric’s death.”
