Heater on, Draco takes a moment to assess the situation. What does he do now? Wait for this dude to wake up? And then what happens? The radio clock glares 2:00am and Draco is really tired. He taps the gently snoring man on the shoulder, gaining no reaction.
"Okay, I'll walk you out." His blonde acquaintance replies. Harry opens his mouth to protest but finds it hard to form any words. He tries to shake his head instead, but it feels too heavy, so he moves to stand. He finds himself swaying, and alarm bells are now beginning to sound off in his mind. This isn't right.
"Draco..." he starts, reaching out for me. I allow him to. His hand lands softly on my knee and he gives me a gentle squeeze.
“Uh no, but I am Harry Potter, the Auror that rescued him.” Harry answers, scratching the back of his neck in anticipation.
He takes a quick breath and continues, “He always used a Muffliato whenever he cast the incantation, and he was very careful about that. Not once did I hear the words he used. But…there was always this sort of pounding sound. It was awful, like the beating of huge, amplified drums or something. And there was something else…besides what I told you about the blood needing someone else’s blood, I remember that he once told me he needed the blood to be ‘afraid.’ Which makes sense because he always…” Draco takes a longer, shuddering breath at that point.
"You're being reckless Potter, bound to get yourself killed! And if they find out I was anywhere near the vicinity of your death, you bet your ass they'll somehow find a way to pin it on me. So yes, Potter, I'm involved now whether you like it or not."
“The news is that there is no news.” Harry supplies, scrubbing at his hair nervously. And if looks could kill… “I mean, I’ve exhausted almost all possible avenues. I can’t find squat on Dresden. It’s like the man never existed. Ron is coming up short on the blood ritual…and I was wondering, maybe we could take a look at the Manor’s library-“
“The newly appointed Head Auror might have had something to do with it.” He jokes, and laughter fills the air once again.
Two hours later, Harry finds himself stumbling groggily to the bathroom to relieve himself. The headache seems to have subsided just a bit, enough so that his thoughts are allowed to turn for the worst. Dark thoughts threatening to intrude upon his blurry consciousness and ruin his overall tranquil mood. Harry can’t bear it, so he finds his way back to the kitchen and pulls the whiskey glass out of the sink. He pours himself two fingers and adds a few ice cubes from the freezer. Then he sits at his small table yet again and pulls out the letter. He sighs as he reads the words over and over, taking comfort in the easy feeling that settles into his soul, the way that the dark thoughts just slip away and the world around him appears slightly fuzzy at the edges. Once the uneasy feeling has fully subsided, about two whiskey drinks later, Harry finally starts his day.
“Hey, what makes you so sure I didn’t cook it?” Harry says with indignation. The two men stare each other down for a few moments before bursting out laughing. Hermione and Ginny snort from their respective seats in the living room.
“You knew all this time, Mione? And you didn’t say anything to me?” Ron bellows from behind them, the first words he has spoken since he arrived.
“It’s awful Harry! The blood ritual is an ancient ritual that uses the blood of purebloods and the blood of the ‘tainted innocent,’ which is why Muggle children are used, because they are considered tainted yet innocent. The ritual detoxifies the blood over time but it takes two years to complete. The information on the ritual is so scarce that they had to find bits of information that were scattered all over the world. Draco would have carried the ritual on eventually at risk of dying if he fought against it, but by the time it was complete, he would most likely have died anyway, as it’s a lot for the body to take.”  She chatters on, taking bites of curry in between and swallowing gulps of pumpkin juice. Harry finds it hard to focus on her words. He glances back at Ron, who at least has his mouth fully closed now, jaw set, eyes staring angrily at the wall. Harry blanches and faces Hermione again, who continues to speak in the animated way she always does when she finds a subject fascinating. When it gets to be too much, Harry feels compelled to interrupt her.
“You and the Weaslette probably have a little one by now? Or at least one on the way?” Draco says politely. It seems disingenuous, pained almost.
have some of that information is way above their pay grade. Harry hasn’t spoken much with Draco since their awkward lunch together. He wonders if perhaps something in the Malfoy library could be of any help. He figures he at least owes the other man an update, even if it’s to say he hasn’t found a whole lot. He struggles with the reality behind these thoughts: he just misses the other man terribly. And so, if Draco wants to keep things strictly business, Harry will have to do just that. The other man made it clear that the ball is essentially in Harry’s court, as much as Harry doesn’t want to face that fact. He just can’t seem to stop thinking about him. Decision made, Harry heads over to Draco’s flat.
“I’m fine, just need to use the loo.” He stands so quickly he nearly trips over the side of his chair as he makes his way back to the guest bathroom. He feels weird and anxious and his head is swimming. He locates his discarded pants from the previous night and exhales in relief. He grabs his wallet, some bits of paper and receipts, and his letter. He digs deeper into the pocket to find…nothing. Harry is devastated at the realization that he is going completely cold turkey today. There is no way to cheat the system. Plan C has been completely foiled. He takes a moment to allow the desperation and despair to wash over him. Tears prickle at the sides of his eyes and he takes some gulping breaths, squeezing his letter before opening it to look at the familiar neat scrawl of the person he used to trust more than anyone else in the world. Even that doesn’t do the trick, and as the few bites of sandwich he swallowed earlier come back out in a spewy, chunky mess onto the sink, Harry, for the first time, thinks maybe he has a slight problem.
This is not good. I recognize the insignia on this hut wall all too well. My legs are completely asleep and I struggle for a few seconds to breathe. Sheer panic. That is the only way to describe what I am feeling in this moment.
At some point Weasley and Granger visit. It's horribly uncomfortable for all of us. They stare at my hand over Potter's for way too long. Granger clears her throat and gives Weasley a pointed look. He responds by giving her a pained expression and then looking at me gravely. His apology is stilted, rehearsed, but in the end I nod my acceptance to him, citing that he couldn't possibly have known. His shoulders seem to sag in relief at that. Granger thanks me with tears in her eyes, sputters out her own apology, even attempts an awkward hug, all of which I allow her to do. I tell her it's okay, and then I thank them both for looking out for Potter. And while I don't agree with all the methods the light-bringers used during battle, they were the only group that really seemed to get anything done.
“Good,” Harry starts, “I’ve um… I’ve got some follow up questions for you, from our conversation last night.”
"Sure, that'd be great, Malfoy, thanks." Potter flinches, rubs his temples where sweat is now starting a steady drip. He appears to be doing his best to hide this from Draco, but Draco can see it clearly. As a wizard, the withdrawal process will be more intense for Potter but he will be able to overcome it in a shorter period of time. Unfortunately, Draco knows this intimately, as flashes of memories swirl around in his head. He does his best to push them back down, rubbing his left wrist nervously. Wouldn't do to lose his shit right now, not when he's trying to prove he's the real deal.
“Bloody fuckin’ hell, Potter, you look exhausted,” Malfoy tells him from the sink, giving him a look that says he knows what happened in that bathroom. “Why don’t you try napping for a bit?” Harry thinks that sounds like an amazing idea. He nods and mumbles his agreement before grabbing his duffel bag and turning around to head into the guest room. Just to be sure, he finds his pants again on the guest bathroom floor where he discarded them earlier and searches the pockets thoroughly. He then searches through the rest of his clothes, coming up empty handed once again. He feels suddenly more tired than he has ever felt before in his life. He takes a few deep breaths to calm his frazzled nerves, then strips off his boxers and climbs into the surprisingly comfortable bed.
Another diagnostic spell reveals that a very specific timer spell has been placed on the documents. So when Dresden banished them it was only temporary. Meaning who ever this K.S. person is, they are bound to come and try to collect the documents any minute. If Harry stakes out the place he could easily catch them. He figures that this is very time sensitive, so it is highly possible this person may even be planning on coming to retrieve the documents today. He spends some more time digging through the documents and familiarizing himself with the blood ritual, something called “Sanguinum Purgo,” when a small photograph slides out onto the ground at his feet. Brimming with curiosity, Harry bends over to pick the photograph up. It is clearly an old photograph, slightly faded on the edges, but the magic is still ever present. Dresden looks much younger, happier, and healthier even, as he stands next to a young teenaged boy who looks oddly familiar. In the picture, both smile and turn toward the camera, with Dresden draping an arm around the young boy’s shoulders. They are standing inside of someone’s kitchen, although Harry doesn’t recognize it at all. He stares for a few minutes at the repeating sequence of events in the photograph, his heartbeat speeding as a dreadful realization slowly bubbles to the surface of his addled mind. Everything suddenly clicks into horrifying clarity as he finally recognizes the young boy to be none other than Kingsley Shacklebolt.
Harry laughs, the sound of it swallowed up by the music, but his partner sees it and returns a bright smile. Harry’s eyes sweep over him. He is attractive; young, slim build, green eyes, blonde hair, and he is dressed in tight skinny jeans with an open, button-up cotton shirt. His tanned abdominal muscles glint with sweat as he shakes his hips. Harry thinks he’s in love. They continue like this, grinding and dancing together for some time, in which Harry is just happy to be alive. It all comes to a grinding, sudden halt when Harry glimpses a flash of light brown hair in the crowd, with a facial structure that looks much too familiar. Harry feels the panic rise like bile in his throat, and he pushes at his dance partner, bends over to take deep, gulping breaths.
“Like I said… I don’t remember the attack. I just remember waking up on the floor of the living room in that cabin. Potter he didn’t move me from there, not even once during the entire time he had me. And I was there for what, a year?” Harry nods, his heart is breaking into a million pieces and he is sure this isn’t even the worst of it. He needs to stay strong though, or risk both of them falling apart. Draco needs him to be strong in this moment and he can’t let him down.
On the twenty-ninth night, their comfortable, sexy little bubble finally pops. Harry finishes his work on a case early, and Apparates into the apartment without a second thought. Draco is not in the kitchen, which is where Harry usually finds him. It’s become a bit of an unspoken routine, in which Draco has taken a liking to cooking dinners for them on weeknights. There are various food prep items out on the counter, so Harry knows Draco still plans to cook, it is probably just too early for him to actually get started. He removes his shoes and coat before making his way into their bedroom so he can grab a shower in the master bath. He never anticipates the scene that he actually walks in on.
"Why should I trust you?" Harry says, but he regrets that, because he knows deep down inside that if it hadn't been for Malfoy last night, something terrible would have happened to him, something he may not have been able to come back from.
"Malfoy," he spits my name with vitriol. I am unable to say anything as he grabs me by my collar, lifting me up off the ground. His breath is putrid and there is a terrifying look on his face as he crushes me into the wall. "You fucking bastard!" He yells, pulling me forward before slamming me against the wall once again. Part of me realizes that this probably isn't 100% personal. Weasley must have lost someone important. He is blaming me because I happen to be the death eater that has been caught. The rational part of my brain understands this, but the other part, the part that is reckless, much darker and filled with deep rooted pride, wants to egg him on, to push his buttons and see how far we can take this.
“Draco,” he says quietly. They are sitting at the table enjoying tea and scones together, and Draco looks up from his book in question.  Harry steels himself, vowing to be straightforward with the other man, telling himself that this is the second chance he will not squander, and says, “I want to sleep with you.” Draco nearly chokes on the scone he has just taken a bite from, and he takes a moment to chew thoughtfully before swallowing quietly and raising his eyes to Harry’s.
Draco pads into his kitchen and grabs a can of cat food from the pantry. He hears the tinkling sound of the bell attached to his cat as the cat meows his way into the kitchen. "Hey, Mochi, sorry I forgot to feed you earlier." Draco says guiltily, stroking the cat's soft fur. The black and white feline purrs in appreciation and meows softly before tucking in to his newly offered meal. Cat now happy, Draco sneaks into the bedroom where Potter's jeans are hanging from a chair. The man is snoring quite loudly, with some soft groaning and whining interspersed between snores. Draco grimaces, remembering what had happened earlier in the evening.
Once everyone’s bellies are full the brim from delicious roast and sweet, sticky pudding, it’s time for the Christmas Eve tradition of exchanging gifts. Harry’s heart pounds and his head fills with nervousness as he removes the small, neatly wrapped gift he had hidden in his pocket. He and Draco had purchased joint gifts for everyone else, and Harry watches as Draco swishes his wand, and everyone’s gifts come floating out from where they were sitting underneath the Christmas tree to land in front of them. They spend the next half hour exchanging and opening gifts, smiling and thanking each other for the different assortments of trinkets and treats from each other, and hand knitted sweaters from a certain Weasley matriarch. Harry can’t help but chuckle as he notices the look on Narcissa’s face as she inspects her own hand knitted sweater, silver like her eyes, with shiny little golden lights spread across the stitching.
"No, I..." Malfoy hesitates, takes a breath, seems to try again, "no Potter, what happened to you last night was not your fault. But when I said you were being reckless, I meant the drug and alcohol abuse... Do you know what muggle drugs will do to a wizard's magical core?"
“It’s okay-“ Harry starts to say, overwhelmed with emotion, but Draco continues speaking at the same time.
“Nothing really…not much has changed.” Harry answers him honestly. He follows Draco’s line of sight, to the silver wedding band on his left ring finger. It makes Harry feel self-conscious, guilty almost. He fiddles with the ring nervously and Draco looks away.
"Yes, Malfoy, just like that...fuck...so good." His words spur me on; his tongue is hot velvet again my skin. I reach between us to grab his prick, hard and weeping as it lays stiffly against his stomach. He grunts at the contact, head falling back onto the ground. My mouth follows him, kissing down his neck to his collarbone, and then down to his nipples as I pump his cock harshly. His nails rake down my shoulders as he moans shamelessly.
“Follow me,” Draco deadpans, and turns on his heel toward his bedroom. Inside, they find a completely unconscious Kingsley Shacklebolt, under several stunning charms, sitting stiffly and unconsciously in the third missing chair from the dining room. The room itself appears neat and tidy, obviously escaping their earlier duel unfazed. Although Harry had expected this, something about actually seeing him there makes it all too real. He feels dazed, swaying slightly for just a moment before righting himself. He’s been through worse, he reminds himself, so much worse.
“I want you inside of me, Harry.” Draco whispers into his ear. Harry pulls back to look into his eyes. All he sees is certainty and trust and so much
to make Draco change his mind. Because he can’t lose him now. Not after everything they have been through.
“Oh, that’s perfect, then.” Ginny answers, before turning toward Albus, who is hanging tinsel around Draco’s shoulders. “Albus! Make sure you put your teddy in your room, honey, you don’t want to lose it!”
"Yes I do, Draco. Don't try to tell me how I feel." It still feels weird to hear him call me by my first name, although I can't quite pin point when exactly he started using it. At any rate, I haven't been able to bring myself to call him Harry. At least not out loud.
A few days before Draco wakes up, Ron and Hermione come barreling through, arms full with bags of delicious smelling curry takeout. Despite his best efforts, Harry is unable to let go of Draco’s hand in time for them not to notice. The tense silence is palpable.
“Draco, you know that what happened wasn’t your fault, right?” Harry asks finally, and the words echo hollowly in his memories, back to a time where his own wife used to fruitlessly ask him the same question. Draco nods minutely and looks away.
Draco stops to look at him, waits for some kind of response. Harry’s mind is racing. That’s a lot of information and there is at least one inconsistency. There aren’t any missing children that he can think of, yet according to Draco, there should be quite a few. So Harry voices that opinion, which, seems to be a bit of a mistake.
"I saw what happened. I know you want to join our side." Potter finishes taking off his cloak and stands tall in front of me. His eyes are piercing and his hair tangles wildly around his ears. He is all toned muscles and tanned skin. He looks beautiful. I swallow at the intruding thought before blinking away from him.
a child.” He whispers. And then his body begins to tremble, his breaths becoming shallower and quicker until he is panting in a frenzy. “I…I can’t breathe!” Draco shouts in a panic, thrashing about on his bed, a wide and terrified look in his eyes. Harry is shocked, angered, and completely desolate. He wishes he had a time turner so he could go back and kill Dresden over and over. He would do it the same way Dresden did it to those kids, torturous and fear inducing.  Not just for them but for Draco, too, so Draco could have the satisfaction of watching him die over and over.
"Well after I visited you in your cell I realized that if I did die, you would most likely spend your life in Azkaban. So I sought out the Prophet, promising exclusive details in exchange for them keeping it a complete secret and delaying the publishing until after the battle. I knew that with that article you would have to be pardoned no matter what."  He says it so nonchalantly, as if we were only discussing the weather.
“I um…erm….he’s fine. Healer says he could wake at any minute now. Procedure was a huge success.” She smiles at that, and Harry smiles confusedly back. Over at the entrance, Ron continues to stand and stare.
Harry hesitates, swallows, and then begins hurling spells toward him, all easily deflected. He curses under his breath. He has no idea where Ron is. He remembers how powerless he was to help Draco when he had been hit by Dresden’s cutting curse, wonders if it will be the same this time around, wonders why he didn’t train better for this part. At this time it seems that Augustus is only concerned with vanishing his documents, and not so much at attacking Harry.  Harry is fuming at how easily the wizard blocks his spells. He notices now that all of the documents are gone. Harry is livid, that could have been amazing evidence for his case!
"We can go to the grocery store today, pick up some things for lunch and dinner, maybe grab you some clothes, since you'll be staying the night." Draco surprises even himself at the words that come out of his mouth. He has just suggested a public outing with his childhood nemesis. He rationalizes it, tells himself he wants to observe Potter at a setting where he has access to alcohol, even in his home where he may have access to drugs. The truth is, time may have softened him. As much as he is loath to admit that to himself. Is he being kind for kindness sake?
"Isn't that right, darling?" Ginny's hand is on his arm. Everyone at the table is looking at him expectantly. It isn't hard to fake a smile as he responds.
"If it comes down to it, you'll kill me or let me die to protect our secret." I explain to him slowly, as though he is an idiot, because I can't help my self-destructive behavior. Chalk it up to pride or something, but I have always been this way.
“Mmmm! So good, Draco!” Molly praises, and Draco seems to relax the last bits of tension in his shoulders. Everyone joins in to praise him, earning a genuine smile from Draco as his eyes meet Harry’s. Harry nods at him before leaning in to kiss him softly on the lips. Once everyone has a full plate and has begun eating, Harry tucks into his own meal, moaning appreciatively at the taste. Draco’s hand is on his knee, warm and comforting as he gives him a gentle squeeze. He lets the merry chatter going on around him lull him into a blissful state of calm as he enjoys the meal.
I try my hardest to hold out, to make this moment last. It has been a shitty month of being forced to watch as other Death Eaters do unspeakable things to innocent muggles and muggleborns alike. The moments where I get to see Potter, to feel like I am making a difference, like everything will be worth it in the end, are much too fleeting. And now, I haven't been able to think of anything but our kiss. There is a hope within me, ever present, that it isn't just the war that makes him reciprocate my desires. That maybe, just maybe, when this is all over, we can be together out in the open. I know it is probably too much to ask, given everything I have done, will continue to do before the war is over.
“Harry,” Arthur says curiously, “Why have you got a picture of Augustus Dresden sticking out of your robes pocket?”
Harry knows wholeheartedly that it doesn’t matter. He can never stop loving Draco Malfoy. And now that the man is alive, well it complicates things all over again. Harry remembers how hard it was to live the lie he was a part of, and honestly they hadn’t been doing it for very long before the attack. Yet, every fiber of his being is alive with electricity. He wants to jump up for joy, he wants to sing out loud, he wants to laugh as loud as his lungs can handle. Instead, he looks at Ron with the kindest eyes he can muster.
"My...my family?" I ask when she doesn't continue speaking. She pauses to look at me. There must be something in my eyes that spurs her on to answer me, although I can tell she is uncomfortable.
Potter's messy pockets turn out to be quite the gold mine of information. In his wallet, Draco finds an ID, with the name Henry Porter (Draco has to snort at this), and an address that Draco recognizes as being in a rather shady part of town. He finds his glasses (still the same broken ones he's always had), some cash, loose change, a grocery reward members card, and a bank card. All pretty standard stuff. Deeper in the pocket is a crumpled letter, which Draco begins to read, but then feels rather guilty about once he is half-way through. So Potter has gone off grid, interesting, but why? There are some crumpled receipts from the grocery store. Potter seems to eat healthy but he buys a lot of alcohol. A small piece of paper with the name Jim and a phone number scribbled on it (Draco raises his eyebrow at this). A few tiny empty baggies, and one tell tale baggie with a single pill that Draco is very familiar with. He immediately takes the pill out of the baggie and tosses it into the garbage disposal, then stuffs Potter's items, including the empty baggies, back into the soggy pockets.
“Yes, I do,” Harry says fondly, forcing himself to look away from his delectable cock and make contact with darkened silver eyes, “That’s why they are folded neatly on your bed.” And Draco laughs slightly, before a devious look crosses his features.
"Draco," she starts, "I wanted to let you know that you have officially been pardoned. Your information was correct and very useful to our cause." Her small, well-manicured hand reaches out to me. I clasp it with my own and allow her to pull me up haphazardly. This is good news. I should be relieved. So why do I feel so gutted?
“Potter, I don’t know for sure, but it’s possible, isn’t it? We can’t risk it. Plus, whoever it was had access to a lot of information on Dark Magic.”
"I won't let anything happen to you. Your parents chose their side, remember? You don't deserve the death that my friends wish to inflict on you." His voice is quiet, growing into a whisper at the last part as Aurors swarm around me. "I am going to talk to them, they'll listen, I promise."
, somehow. He brews himself a strong cup of coffee, and then grabs the quickest shower of his entire life. Right before he heads off to work, he glances at the bedroom he and Ginny are supposed to be sharing. The lights are on inside. For a single moment, he considers trying to go inside and talk to her. But he knows it will only escalate into another fight at this point, and he is honestly too tired for this right now. He turns away and steps out into the light of day.
“Potter….I can’t let you buy alcohol, even if it’s for cooking purposes. How about chicken with mushroom sauce? I do love mushrooms.” He says it awkwardly, but his voice doesn’t lack any conviction. Harry is mortified, hoping desperately that no one has overheard. So plan B has been foiled. Plan C is to hope desperately that he’s got a pill or two leftover from last night’s festivities in his pants pocket at Malfoy’s place. The odds so far have not been in his favor. He catches himself rubbing his temples, teeth clenched as Malfoy stares at him with concern.
On Sunday, Harry and Ginny have dinner with the Weasleys, as is also their weekly routine. Ron and Hermione sit next to them at the table. Molly fusses over Harry, joking with Ginny that she doesn't feed him enough. Harry supposes that maybe his appetite hasn't been the same as it was, but it's nothing to really be all that concerned about. Hermione gives Harry a sympathetic look, and he wonders what that is all about. Ron shovels food in his mouth at top speed. They are joined by Ginny's other siblings and their children. Hermione touches her own swollen belly as she watches the kids play. He sees the look of sullen jealousy on his wife's face. Just another typical Sunday.
“You’re reading too much into this Draco, I’m just hungry.” He tries to reassure but Draco doesn’t seem anymore convinced at his words. “This is not a conflict of interest. I’ll exhaust every lead I need to,” his voice is lowering but he knows it’s the truth even as the words come out on their own accord, “whatever the cost. Because you and I both deserve to know the truth about why Dresden did what he did, and who he was working with.” Draco seems to mull this information over in his head before nodding hesitantly.
“Okay, okay, Ginny, I’ve come into some new information about Dresden. He’s…Annie’s great grandfather. He was paying for her treatments anonymously before I…you know.” Ginny looks surprised for a moment, then shakes her head slightly.
"Absolutely, sweetheart." And then, after barely a minute, "I've just made a breakthrough in the case, can I be excused?" Cheers erupt at the table, but Harry doesn't miss the sour look on Ginny's face.
“I do but…don’t you remember the last time we were here?” Draco’s voice is husky, and it sends strange sensations vibrating throughout Harry’s entire body. He does remember, quite suddenly and quite vividly, the last time they visited this particular establishment…
"I swear, Potter, if this doesn't work....if my parents die because of me... if we lose our one opportunity..." It's too painful to finish that sentence.
"Avada Kedavra!" He watches the life drain from Augustus's shocked face. His veins are thrumming with energy as he slowly comes down from his high. Yes, this feels just as good as he has dreamt for so long. This is perfect, this very moment right here-
Draco takes in a deep breath and peers directly into Harry’s eyes. Harry is afraid of what he sees there, the raw vulnerability of a man who once wore a shielding mask so well. It is honestly terrifying. He worries for a moment that maybe Draco really is broken, and maybe he will never be okay again. There are so many conflicted emotions whirling in his mind, but the most worrying is the intense guilt he feels.
“Ugh, Harry, you know I don’t take sugar in my tea.” She says cryptically. Oh, that’s right, Harry thinks, it’s
“Potter…” Draco interrupts his reverie, “Harry…it’s not you. I just…haven’t been touched by anyone alive in a really long time. Your hands are…warm. It’s too weird, right now.” He blanches, his cheeks reddening with embarrassment. Harry’s jaw hangs open and Draco looks away from him. What in the actual
When they arrive, Draco is unable to hold himself up. He bites down on his lip and grunts against his pain, limbs shaking with strain. He looks to Harry with fear and desperation. Harry feels as though the world is unravelling before his eyes. A Healer and mediwitch meet them at the entrance with a chair and begin to wheel Draco inside. Harry struggles with the conflict of staying with Draco or going back to the flat to deal with Shacklebolt. He doesn’t want Shacklebolt to have any opportunity to get away, but at the same time, he knows he needs to be here for Draco.
“Let’s try it, then, and if you don’t like it, we can always just go back to not using the cushioning charm tomorrow.” He encourages, smiling sweetly. He is secretly thrilled at the prospect of the cushioning charm, and he hopes desperately that it will work out for the better.
His hand forced, Harry looks each of them in the eye and states, rather simply, “Ron, Hermione….I’m gay.” There. Like a band aid, Harry figures, now it’s out there and they can get on with either accepting or disowning him. He only hopes they can make up their minds quickly. Ron stands and stares, mouth gaping and shutting like a fish out of water. Hermione, on the other hand, nods resolutely, depositing the contents of the fresh takeout onto the small table at the far corner of the room. She then turns to Ron and takes the bags from his hands as well so that she can place them on the table.
“That’s all, Mary, thank you.” Harry begins to gather the bags and toss them back into the shopping cart as Malfoy pays the cashier, an odd look on his face as he nods at her. He clearly wants to say something but doesn’t, much to Harry’s relief. There’s something so grotesquely domestic about the experience that Harry has momentarily forgotten how much excruciating pain he is in as he ponders the thought. If anyone had told him seven years ago that he would one day be grocery shopping in muggle America with Draco Malfoy of all people, he would have sent them straight to St. Mungo’s. He waves goodbye to Mary as they make their way out of the grocery store, and Harry feels so much relief as his lungs fill with the fresh air of the outside and the threat of being found out is fading slowly behind him.
And Harry was just sitting there judging him the entire time, secretly suspicious of his every move. Harry can only hope that Draco never realized what he was thinking.
Mochi climbs up onto Potter’s lap, earning a surprised and rather delighted expression from the dark haired man. He scratches the feline behind his ears, earning a loud purr as the cat rubs his face into his hands. Draco introduces him as Mochi, and earns himself an almost amazed look from Potter. They chat for a few seconds about the cat, Draco explains how he rescued him as a kitten when he was abandoned in a box on the side of the highway. Apparently muggles do this sort of thing really often, which was a hard thing for Draco when he first learned of it. The momentary distraction ends all too quickly when the cat decides he’s had enough and scampers out into the hallway.
"Draco," his tone is deadly serious, "listen carefully to me, because this is the last time I say this to you..." I force myself to look into his angry emerald orbs, and will myself to stop shaking. "You are a
floor of St. Mungo’s is cheery and friendly when Harry approaches her. She seems to recognize him right away, and inquires about Ginny immediately. Harry returns her smile and tells her Ginny is doing well, even though he doesn’t know that for sure, and remembers what a shitty husband he is. She introduces herself as Mary, and asks how she can help him today. Mary has long, strikingly dark curly hair that is pulled back into a messy, low ponytail. Her nails are bright pink and cut short, and she smells of strawberries. Her eyes are light brown, with slight wrinkles at the ends of them made apparent when she smiles. She is thin and short, wearing dark, tall heels that clink harshly on the ground as she walks. Even with the heels her lack of height is quite noticeable. She appears to be in her early 40’s.
She smiles, almost apologetically. Her eyes flicker to his forehead, where his scar lies hidden underneath his fringe.
“I’ll look into it. Listen, this is good enough right now, we can continue later this afternoon, yeah? Get some rest for now.” He reaches out for Draco’s hands again. Draco pulls away as if burned. Harry stares at his own hands, resting dejectedly on the empty stretch of bed next to Draco.  He can’t help but think about the first time they ever held hands…
“Oh, Harry, that’s great news!” She says genuinely, “He’s been through so much….” She glances back over at Draco, who sleeps peacefully, blissfully unaware of the horrible awkward tension in the room. She turns her attention back to Harry and motions for him to sit down with her at the table to eat. Her belly is round and low now, and she is a bit breathless as she sits heavily down onto the chair. She begins to remove the containers of takeout as she updates Harry on her research.
"Okay?" I mirror stupidly. I was expecting a bit more fight than that. But maybe Potter is tired of waiting, too.
But he knows there may be a long road ahead of them to ever get to that again. Harry doesn’t have time to dwell on this though, because the next thing he knows Draco is speaking.
“Get some rest,” she tells him, “there are some pillows and a blanket on the couch for you.” With those words, she proceeds to walk down the hallway before slamming their bedroom door. Harry has really bollixed things up this time. He feels so awful but he is so exhausted, he figures letting Ginny have some distance would probably be for the best. Better not to approach her when she has made her expectations clear.
"She came to our aide in the final battle. She blamed V-V- the dark lord for your death....she wanted revenge. But it's enough for her to possibly be pardoned as well."
liar. Harry can’t bear the thought of losing his entire family. But somehow, even with how horrible the conversation went with his wife, and running into yet another dead end with the case, Harry feels lighter, somehow. He no longer has to be the keeper of his dark, shameful secret. The truth has set them free. They were living in a miserable marriage, and Harry owed this to Ginny, even if he could have done it a better way.
Draco turns around underneath him and gets onto his hands and knees. Harry is awestruck by the sight, and he clumsily tips the bottle onto his fingers. He works gently to stretch the other man’s opening, relishing at the way he thrusts against his fingers and encourages Harry to go harder and faster. His cock twitches against his stomach with arousal, and it’s all he can do to stay focused, to make sure he doesn’t jump the gun and end up hurting Draco with his enthusiasm. His free hand alternately rubs circles into Draco’s back and squeezes his hip eagerly. When Draco cranes his neck to stare daggers at Harry, telling him to
His notes were always succinct, neat, with the right amount of detail, and always grammatically correct. He was always the one to complete it for them when they were partners, under the guise that Harry was too slow, or not detailed enough, or whatever other excuse. But Harry knew the truth, he just wanted to spare Harry the trouble. He was selfless in small ways like that, ways he would never care to admit to Harry out loud. Unbidden, Harry suddenly remembers the day he and Draco were forced to work together.
“Augustus he – pulled out his wand, aimed it at the boy – and he-he slit his throat right in front of me. He collected his blood in a bucket, added the cup with my blood in it, mixed it together with some kind of incantation, and started drinking it. He laughed at me the entire time because I screamed… I couldn’t help it. I was terrified and disgusted.”
"Okay, then you'll be fine without a drink for the next 24 hours, right? I'll tell you what, if you can go for that amount of time without a drink or a pill, which you'll be hard pressed to find here anyway, you're free to go."
He finds himself standing at his door step a few minutes later, but hesitates just before his fist makes contact with the door. Should he really be bothering Draco right now? With no news? What will the blonde think of him just showing up like this, without word beforehand? Just as Harry decides he should tuck tail and leave, the front door opens, and there stands a slightly unkempt Draco Malfoy. And Harry can’t help himself, his breath hitches, and his heart hurts with the pain of not having been able to see him this past week. He takes in the sight of him, hair hanging in wet tangles, and a bathrobe wrapped tightly around him, smooth skin on his chest peeking through. The fresh smell of sandalwood that brings back so many memories. Harry reels from the emotion of it all. There will never be a time where he wouldn’t find him to be absolutely beautiful. There will never be a time where he could stop loving him.
“Probably visiting Annie, I reckon.” Arthur says distantly, already back to his poking and prodding.
“Wight here, Wose!” Albus yells, and the two toddlers hug like they haven’t seen each other in years, even though it was just last week that they had their last play date. Hermione and Ron dust the soot from their coats and greet everyone with a hug.
I see the shadows of someone's footsteps approaching. My body freezes, ice cold as none other than Ronald Weasley saunters into the room, a prideful look on his face. The other boy is tall and lanky, freckles dusted across his pale face in a haphazard manner. It looks as if someone tripped over with a bucket of paint and little droplets landed on his face carelessly. His red hair is pulled back into a tight bun. In another life, I might have thought he was attractive.
Harry decides to head back to his office to check in and do some research to kill the time. When they had arrived back at the hospital, after another miserable 30 minutes of eating in tense silence, Draco had been discharged on the grounds of allowing a mind healer to see him at his flat for sessions twice weekly. They decided that if Draco thinks of anything he can call on Harry, but for now he is just going to focus on getting settled at home.
“Bullshit, Harry! A good husband believes his wife when she tells him she has nothing to do with something. A good husband turns the case over to someone else when it becomes a conflict of interest!” Tears of rage are falling from her eyes steadily.
He cries out, releasing Draco’s cock from his mouth to pant against the other man’s thigh. Draco begins to thrust his fingers faster and faster, adding a third and making Harry feel like he is going to explode. He pulls away from Draco’s ministrations finally, flipping himself over, mouth colliding with Draco’s as he impales himself in one steady motion onto Draco’s leaky, rigid member. Now Draco cries out, the sound muffled against Harry’s mouth as Harry begins to thrust himself up and down on Draco’s cock in a traitorous rhythm. Draco’s cock stretches and fills Harry, with a burning pleasure so good that it brings tears to his eyes and a sting to his throat. Harry swallows the emotion of it all, kissing Draco with all his might as his cock slides against the other man’s stomach. Draco reaches in between them to stroke him, matching Harry’s thrusts. Their mouths disconnect as Harry takes in gulping breaths, but Draco is relentless, sucking at Harry’s throat, his free hand on Harry’s hip, helping him keep pace.
Harry stares at the letter in his hands. His vision blurs through his tears as he sniffs unceremoniously. The letter arrived about two weeks ago, and Harry has not received another since, nor has he responded. It’s a bit crumpled at the edges, and Harry does his best to smooth it out tenderly. His hands are shaky. He sits at a small table for one in an efficiency somewhere in Muggle America. He really hasn’t gone too far off the grid, has he? He’s just made sure to lose his wand (it’s safe and sound in Grimmauld Place) and change his appearance a bit. He has dyed his hair with muggle hair dye, to a slightly less dark brown color, and he wears contacts instead of glasses. And that’s all it takes to go missing from the Wizarding world, apparently.
The cottage itself has been heavily warded to the point that it takes Harry a few minutes to actually breach them and make his way inside. It still retains some of its comforting qualities, a small fireplace in the living room, along with a large china cabinet filled with different assortments of crockery, and a quaint little kitchen. But further investigation reveals the darker side of what was going on in that home. The chains that held Draco to the wall in the living room are still in the same exact spot, and some rather sinister supplies lay strewn about in the storage closet: some rope, buckets, and knives are the most visible. Harry finds the large metal tub that Draco described when talking about the little girl who was skinned alive, and it is rusted to the point that the rust reminds Harry of blood, and he dry heaves a bit. He supposes he can question some of the patrons of the muggle village nearby, as perhaps one of them has seen something that could be useful.
There is a moment of tense silence as each of us marvels at the idea that I could ever thank anyone for anything. Let alone Potter's little sidekicks.
“Hold on - slow down, ritual? Children? You need to start from the beginning... And Draco, just go at the pace you are comfortable with. I’m not in a hurry.” At this point, Harry has pulled a chair up close to Draco, placing his hand gently over his wringing ones. Draco is caught in some kind of despair and Harry’s heart aches. He doesn’t know how to fix it. Part of him wants to scoop him up and never let go, but the other part doesn’t want to cross some unknown boundary. This is uncharted territory. Draco stares down at their joined hands with wide eyes, almost panicked. He decides that since Draco doesn’t pull his hands away from him, this is a good start.
“It’s Kingsley.” Harry finishes Draco’s sentence, watching as the blonde’s beautifully chiseled jaw drops in shock. Harry holds his hands up in surrender. “He came by to talk with you about reinstating you as an Auror, but instead tried to kidnap you. Does that about sum it up?” Draco shuts his jaw with an audible click.
“Harry,” She begins, her eyes watering slightly as she is overcome with emotion. Harry just stares awkwardly, waiting for her to finish. She reaches into her purse and pulls out a photograph. She hands it to him, tears falling fully from her eyes. Harry takes it and looks at it in confusion. It’s a sonogram. A tiny, indiscernible fetus does flips and wiggles around before stopping and starting again in the same trajectory. The connection is instant, and Harry feels the prickling of tears in his own eyes as he looks back at Ginny and then down at the sonogram again.
“The hospital was another dead end, although I did find out Dresden was funding Annie’s payments anonymously. He never came by to visit though. But with that bit of information the only thing left to do was to confront Ginny. So I had Veritaserum…for both of us.” Draco takes in a breath of surprise at hearing those words, but Harry plunges on, dizzy from their proximity to each other. “So naturally, she had some questions and I…told her the truth…” Harry stops for a moment, heart beating so quickly he feels like he might swoon. He reaches over and gently touches at the fabric of Draco’s pajama top, just a ghost of a touch, but it’s enough to light each of his nerve endings on fire.
Once he has finished, he fears, very briefly, that these memories will one day fade into nothingness. The thought is so devastating he chokes back a sob. Ginny quietly climbs off of him before laying in the bed, legs propped up with the hopes in aiding his little swimmers to her waiting egg. Harry wonders if she feels anything anymore, if she enjoys their sex or if it's the idea of a baby that keeps her going. He doesn’t even know if she has been having orgasms lately.
“I…I can’t stop cutting the scar,” he gasps through his tears, “no matter how hard I try, I can’t stop collecting the blood. There is something inside of me that just won’t allow me to stop. I don’t do anything with it, I swear, and I hate myself for even doing it in the first place.” Harry moves to him of his own accord. He casts a quick healing spell over the bleeding cut and a cleaning spell over the spilt blood on the dresser and carpet, and then wraps his arms around Draco. He has a million questions, and the Auror in him finds it hard to believe that there isn’t something more nefarious going on. But this is Draco, he reminds himself, the man he loves, and the man who is riddled with nightmares and feels he doesn’t even deserve to sleep on a bed anymore. But what if that guilt is more deserving than the other man lets on? Harry forces that thought away and chooses instead to be there for Draco. Draco has said before that his coping mechanisms are unhealthy. Perhaps this is just another one of those.
“What made you believe he would go with you?” Harry asks. His heart pounds thunderously in his chest, and for a moment he doesn’t want to know what Kingsley will say. There is a part of Harry, deep within him, that worries Draco had something more to do with it all than he ever let on.
“I’ll gather up your discharge paperwork, happy to see you’re awake and thriving.” She says, turning from both men and making her way out of the room. Draco releases a breath as Harry wraps him into a warm embrace. He breathes him in, somehow marveling at the fact that the man can still smell like a hint of sandalwood underneath the sterile smell of cleaning charms.
"Please tell us the nature of your relationship with Harry Potter." She starts. I open my mouth, fully intending to tell them I am a double agent who has been reporting to him for well over a year. But instead, what comes out is-
In an instant, both men Apparate to St. Mungo's. There is no time to deal with the mess they have left at the cottage.
"Umm....sir?" He tries again, feels like an idiot for using the word "sir," and then decides to shake him rather violently. If this guy has been drugged, it's going to take a bit of work to bring him back to consciousness. The lightning bolt scar revealed under heavy fringe is like a jolt of electricity to his nerve endings, and he jerks back, hitting his head against the window of the driver's seat.
He recognizes me almost instantly. I curse the wind for dislodging my hair from where it was neatly tucked in place underneath my hood. His wand begins to lower and he shakes his head.
He brings Draco a mug of tea; two sugars and a splash of milk, just the way he likes it. Draco sips gratefully, moaning softly at the taste. Harry watches his Adam’s apple bob as he gulps the liquid down. He can’t help but notice how sexy Draco is in this moment. Draco catches him staring and smirks at him.
“But I did Potter, and regardless of whether it would have killed me or not, I was never going to harm another child.”
I am flabbergasted. So many emotions are exploding within me at once. I open my mouth to speak, shut it, and open it again only to leave my jaw hanging there in complete shock. It is all suddenly becoming clear to me. Potter risked everything for me. Even after finding out the truth about what I've done, he felt I was worthy of saving. Even though it meant compromising his own safety and the possibility of finally defeating Voldemort, he wanted to make sure I would be okay no matter what.
"Okay," I say, "I want to join your side." I raise the sleeve on my left arm and show him my dark mark. I let out a sound that is not quite a sob but something close to it. He doesn't look surprised or bothered or even slightly upset.
He would get notes in return, Potter, I saw a few times when he thought I was asleep, but I could never quite make out the words. So those documents weren’t banished, they were sent to his partner, I bet.” Harry starts to wonder about some of the things Draco is telling him. Perhaps he is confused, as the Mediwitch mentioned when he first woke up. To think that someone from the Ministry, specifically, was helping Augustus…that seemed to Harry to be a touch of paranoia. And then the whole thing about the kids.
The third time that we meet up to exchange information, Potter is friendlier than usual. Since my information has checked out each time thus far, he seems to be in higher spirits. He touches my elbow briefly and leans toward me as I speak to him. We have an arrangement to meet once monthly in a secret outdoor location of his specifications. I am ashamed but his simple touch lights my nerve endings on fire. Potter is stunning. He is committed and so determined. He radiates strength and righteousness and he believes in me. It's all I could ever hope for. I'm sure that's all it is. He represents hope and freedom and a world without Voldemort in it. It's nothing more than that.
Harry finds himself staring at the sonogram she has left with him in the wake of her absence. He knows he needs to look up and face the man who shuffles in his seat not too far away, but it’s difficult. He wants to bask in this small moment of pure happiness before navigating the complex dynamics that have suddenly been thrust unto his new and tenuous relationship with Draco. He hears the heavy thud of cane that indicates Draco is walking over to him. He swallows before staring into tumultuous silver eyes with his own pleading hopefulness.
My heart twists with the emotion that those three words elicit. I think I love him too. In fact, I'm sure of it. But there is so much he doesn't know about me, about the things I have done, the things I have allowed to happen.
"Good thing then, because you're rubbish at keeping promises," I hope my joke is enough to break the tension and it is. He laughs before crushing me back into his arms for a breathless kiss.
To those who have waited patiently for me to continue this story, I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. This story felt like it needed a seventh chapter, so there will be one more after this one. I hope you all enjoy and thank you again for your comments and kudos!
Harry sucks in a deep breath. He can literally feel the tension leaving his shoulders. He doesn't feel sorry for what he has done. In fact, he is more satisfied than he has ever been in his life. Even killing Voldemort pales in comparison to this feeling right now. For a brief moment he considers telling Ron about the missing documents. But he isn't sure if that's important, and besides, he just wants this all to be over. No loose ends.
“Exactly,” he states, “Please, don’t use me as an excuse to mistreat a Malfoy.” His words are pure vitriol, and the mediwitch has the sense to avert her eyes. She stumbles out an apology with tears in her eyes, and shuffles away again. Harry sighs. He hadn’t
“Harry, why the fuck is Kingsley Shacklebolt tied to a chair in Draco’s bedroom?” Hermione smiles wryly at Harry, who does his best to return it in kind. She places her hand on Ron’s shoulder and hands him the documents, picture first. His eyes widen in recognition.
“It smells amazing in here!” Ginny says, moving in for a hug. Harry returns the hug, breathing in her strawberry scented hair. Albus sometimes smells like her shampoo, he muses.
"Don't apologize," I tell him, pushing him back down on the bed and grabbing his hand again, "you just caught me by surprise..." He smiles crookedly at me. "How are you feeling?" I ask.
"Here’s what is going to happen. He will put up a fight, and you'll have no choice. It's what we will say either way. I'm with you mate, 100%. I want to see that fucker pay for what he did." Ron finally removes his hand from Harry's shoulder and Harry releases the breath he hadn't realized he was holding. He is secretly thrilled by Ron's words. Harry has never wanted anything more than this. Well, maybe one or two things, but both were too painful to think about.
“The case that is more important to you than your own marriage?” She asks him, and Harry feels compelled to answer, before he even has the chance to contemplate what has just been asked-
“Why didn’t you tell me, Harry?” Ginny is crying so hard that she has to blow her nose on the napkin that Harry had laid out for her earlier.
"What happens now?" I ask him. He gives me a sad smile, eyes veering from my own to a point somewhere behind me.
"Thank you, Malfoy." Potter says, as he sits up and stretches. The blanket has fallen below his pectorals, revealing tan, muscular skin that causes Draco's mouth to dry. He hadn't noticed last night because he was in such a panic. But of course Potter would look this good even with a drug problem and hungover from the night before. Messy dark locks of hair are jutting out from his head in a true Potter fashion. Draco wonders how he didn't just know it was him from the very first moment he saw him. He'd recognized him, true, but had assumed he was a Potter look alike.
So Harry does not hesitate as he slides his hands underneath Draco’s shirt to touch the warm, smooth skin of his back. The muscles there tighten underneath his fingertips, a soft moan escaping from Draco’s lips at the contact. Harry can feel that Draco is still too thin, and a surge of fierce protectiveness comes over him. It has been too long, and Draco came too close to dying…Harry can’t bear to think of it. He’d thought he’d lost the blonde forever, and he vows in this moment to never let him slip away again. Draco’s fingers are hot, and the pressure they exhibit becomes more insistent as their kiss only deepens, becoming less gentle and more desperate with each passing minute. He slides his hands down Harry’s neck and into the collar of his robe, pushing the offending garment off of Harry’s shoulders. Harry moves his hands away from Draco to allow the sleeves to fall from his arms, and then grabs at Draco’s pajama top roughly to pull him back in for another smoldering kiss.
"No, I haven't been assigned to do that. But I will most likely be part of the attack on Hogwarts. Just remember, Potter, do what you have to when the time comes."
When he enters the room, Draco looks at him as though nothing else in the universe exists. His lips quirk up into the tiniest smile before drawing back into a thin, tight line. Harry feels his pulse quicken and he is overwhelmed with emotion. He chokes back a sob and draws in a shaky breath. Draco is the most beautiful thing he has ever seen. He is pale, skin stretched so thin he appears hollow, and he is visibly tired. His shoulders sag heavily into the mattress, and the dark circles under his eyes give the appearance of a skeleton. He is fragile and thin, yet his eyes are determined, fierce even. They are the same vibrant grey that Harry remembers, so bright they look silver in the harsh light of the room. Draco is strong. Harry knows he will be able to move past what has happened and live a normal life again. He just knows it. He can’t accept any other reality.
Ron continues with questions but at this point Harry has zoned everything out and retreated deep within the recess of his mind. He is riddled with crippling guilt at the thought that he believed Draco could ever have been so evil as to willingly take part in anything like what this crazed lunatic was sitting here confessing to. He is so tired of feeling guilty, but he has felt it so long that he allows the feeling to give in to a more bone deep sort of tiredness and depression. He can’t help but think about the fact that Draco was carrying these horrible thoughts, these desires, these urges to cut himself and to kill and to sleep on the ground and continue this horrible thing he had been a part of,
“I think I’ll cast a cushioning charm on the ground tonight.” He says uncertainly, looking to Harry for some type of approval.
Malfoy draws nearer, and Harry can smell him. He smells clean, and earthy, with a hint of spice that Harry can't quite place but knows it's uniquely Malfoy's scent because he remembers it from Hogwarts. And he looks...well Harry doesn't want to admit how he looks. Angelic would have been the term he used last night when he was drugged out of his mind. He's wearing makeup again, but it's not as prominent, just a touch of black at the eyes, bringing out the stark contrast of ice grey, and some gloss at the lips. His hair is no longer gelled and glittery, but hangs rather loosely around his chin, framing his face with fine white-blonde strands. And he's got some muscle, but mostly he is tall and lean and has limbs for days. He's dressed in a pair of black tight pants and a black t-shirt with the words "Deja Entendu" written on it. There's a gold stud in his left ear at the helix. He's aged well, and whatever he's done for himself in the muggle world, it seems to suit him. Unlike what Harry's got going on these days, he's sure he looks like a wet puppy in comparison. And he can't imagine what he must smell like, booze and sick, most likely.
“Oh right, I’m sure that’s true.” Harry says awkwardly, trying to decide whether he should go to St. Mungo’s and find her, or head back home and wait. He begins to pace absentmindedly. He hasn’t been to the hospital to visit yet and he would hate to go and seek his wife out there while she is royally pissed at him. It just doesn’t feel right to intrude like that and force her away from her friend so that they can argue some more.
to be so mean to her. But he knows it has been rough for Mrs. Malfoy this past year. He looks over to see a look of intense approval aimed at him from the fair haired witch. She nods at him, and he blushes, and then the moment passes and she steps past him to get to Draco.
“Chicken with mushroom sauce sounds great,” Harry tries again, “and for lunch, how about turkey club sandwiches?” He busies himself with gathering more ingredients for their meals, avoiding eye contact with the slightly taller blonde beside him. He can feel the man shuffling on his feet before he answers.
“Just give him some time, Harry, he’ll come around.” Hermione whispers in to his ear as they make their best efforts at hugging. Harry feels a startling sensation against his abdomen, of Hermione’s belly twitching and pushing against him. “The baby’s kicking, Harry!” She says happily, grabbing his hand and placing it on the spot. Harry is simultaneously horrified and fascinated. He feels a slight twinge of sadness, at the thought that he may never get to experience this with a partner, but he pushes it down and smiles brightly at Hermione.
“Hullo, Harry.” Ginny says as she steps inside the flat, eyes roaming around the tiny living room and then coming back to meet Harry’s. There is a sparkle in her light brown eyes, one that Harry hasn’t seen before. Divorce has suited her, it seems. Draco drops his toast from where he sits at the dining room table, causing Ginny’s eyes to flicker back to him momentarily.
He purposely forces himself to put all his energy and thought into assembling the best turkey club sandwiches he has ever made. He fries up the bacon, slices the tomato, lettuce, slathers the toast in mayonnaise with just a dab of mustard. He takes a moment to admire his creations, and they really are spectacularly assembled. Malfoy moans in agreement as he takes a bite, nodding his head emphatically. Harry doesn’t like the way that sound makes him feel. He doesn’t like the light in Malfoy’s eyes, the way his hair falls into his face, giving Harry the urge to run his fingers through it. He can barely stomach a few bites of his own sandwich, and his anxiety begins to spike as the other man eyes him with concern.
“No, payments were being sent to our billing department directly but…” Mary says quietly, “a few days ago the payments just suddenly stopped, and we have no way of contacting the donor. And Annie’s parents are both deceased. She has no way of continuing the payments for her treatments, considering how expensive they are. And with how advanced her condition has become…” The words hang in the air between them.
“Well, Potter, first…have you turned in any written notes on this case yet?” Draco responds, eyebrows raised in question.
"It's not your job to keep them in check." I reply, "go easy on yourself, Potter. You're doing the best you can." His shoulders seem to sag in relief at that. I change the subject by telling him some things about my childhood, of some of the more mild things I have been forced to do as of late. He looks at me without judgment, and it is all I can ask for.
Harry has the decency to try and look affronted. "You have no idea what you're talking about." He says it calmly, with every ounce of intimidation left within him, and it seems to work. Malfoy takes a breath, his eyebrows crease. Maybe, Harry thinks, it's working. But then Malfoy relaxes, raises an eyebrow.
“Draco is in the hospital.” Harry says dully, “they have to do an emergency procedure. He didn’t look alright… he-he was in a lot of pain.” He has trouble finishing the sentence, as if the words are sticking to his mouth.
“Good, because there’s something I need to tell you, that you can’t tell anyone else, not even Weasley.” Draco’s eyes are dark and smoldering. Harry holds his breath, nods his head. “I think Dresden was working with a partner.” Draco says quietly, eyes boring holes into Harry’s soul. “And I think…I think it was someone from the Ministry. Potter, you can’t trust anyone.” He finishes, at Harry’s lack of response.
Draco’s shirt is becoming something of a nuisance, Harry realizes, as he fumbles for the third time on a particular button that just refuses to come undone. In fact, all of Draco’s clothes are nothing but a barrier, and without thinking, Harry grabs his wand and banishes the clothes right from Draco’s body. Draco lurches a bit against the cold air suddenly, looking scandalized. Harry drinks in the sight of him, long limbs, slim muscles, with the thinnest, white-blonde hair leading down from his abdomen to a heavy, erect cock, long like the rest of his limbs, pink and full, with a drop of pre-cum at the tip that smears against his stomach. Harry’s mouth waters the sight, and he has half a mind to drop to his knees right then and there, but Draco’s voice interrupts his suggestive thoughts.
Mochi wanders into the kitchen, meowing softly and jumping on the counter, getting in the way as Draco tries to get the damn toaster oven to at least turn on. "Yes, yes, I get it, you want attention," Draco mumbles, pushing the cat off the counter only to have him jump back up and meow harder. Sighing in defeat, Draco strokes the kitty's soft fur until he is purring like a freight engine. "I wouldn't suppose you know how to use the toaster oven?" He asks. The cat meows softly in return and, satisfied with his morning attentions, jumps off the counter and abandons Draco in the kitchen, leaving him to figure it out on his own. He does eventually get the thing on and throws 4 slices of bread into it, before turning back to finish brewing the coffee.
"I'll make sure that we do go to Hogwarts, and when he comes for me, I'll be ready." He stares grimly toward the distance. I wish so much that it didn’t have to be this way. I want to tell him that I love him and that he’d better be careful.
"Emotionally." She interjects loudly. "I'm not talking about the case, Harry. Although that is something else altogether we need to discuss."
"Yeah well, being a hero isn't all it's cracked up to be. It sets the bar really fucking high, you know?" He responds instead, winking at his best friend playfully. Ron chuckles lightly and shakes his head.
“Afternoon, Mr. Porter!” The young cashier smiles at him, tossing her light brown hair behind her shoulder.
“Right,” Draco says, “I’m sorry Potter…I’m just…” He trails off. Harry only continues to look at him patiently, nodding reassuringly, rubbing his hands softly. Draco finally lets out a small chuckle. “I didn’t think it would be this hard.”
“How are you feeling?” Harry changes the subject, hoping to lighten the mood back up. He is confused as to what he might be doing wrong, but desperately wants to make amends.
“Ginny…” Harry says eloquently. Her lips straighten into a thin line. Harry thinks it’s going swimmingly so far. He gives himself a miniature pep talk, things like you can do this, and, you’re a grown man, she’s a small woman, but it’s not helping much. He takes a deep breath, then a sip of his own tea, and yet another deep breath. When he looks into Ginny’s eyes, the anger has been replaced by something much worse: sadness.
“See you later.” He says carefully. Draco shrugs before looking away. It’s so frustrating to Harry that he doesn’t understand what he could possibly be doing wrong. He sighs quietly, choosing to say nothing further for fear of fucking things up even more, and turns toward the door. He doesn’t hear another sound as he steps out and shuts it behind himself.
“Okay,” Draco repeats, “what are your questions, Potter?” Harry really wishes Draco would stop using his last name. He grabs his notepad and self-inking quill out of his robe pocket and takes a seat across from Draco. He doesn’t make any attempt at grabbing his hand or anything, as he understands there are boundaries for this sort of thing; for asking Draco to bear his soul and recount the horrors he has experienced.
In this moment Ron finally comes rushing over. "Good job mate, that was so fast! I've found nothing though, this case is going to prove a bit difficult for us--
“That’s fine, really, go home…and Ron? Thank you, for everything.” Harry pours every ounce of gratitude into his words. His head is still in the clouds and he doesn’t think anything can bring him back down.
I awake in terrible pain. My arms are bound behind me, stretched much too tight underneath the weight of my torso. My neck is craned and my head feels like bricks have been piled high on top of it. I'm cold and wet. I blink against the pain as my vision comes swimming back into focus. A survey of my surroundings reveals that I am in some sort of hut and clearly it has been raining or something because I am laying on my back in the mud.
"I will," he lies, "just give me time to chase this lead and when this is all over, I will see someone." She sighs with relief, retreating back to her side of the bed. Harry feels much better when the weight of her arms, her stare, and her presence have left him.
“What I’m saying Harry, is that I don’t want to do this alone. I don’t want to deal with shitty custody arguments and the likes. I believe we can co-parent like mature adults.” Harry’s eyes flash momentarily to Draco, and through his blurry, tear filled vision he sees the other man staring intently into his mug, eyes slightly wide.  “Draco can be involved to whatever extent you deem fit. It only makes sense given that whomever I choose as a partner will be involved as well.” Ginny carries on, noticing Harry’s glance at the blonde man who has undoubtedly heard all of this. “All that matters now is this life growing inside of me Harry. For his sake, we need to make this work.”
“Go on, then.” Draco tells him resolutely, “let me know what you discover.” It’s such a complete distinction from the happy Draco that he saw moments ago, that Harry wonders if perhaps Draco has some sort of mood disorder. He considers asking how the mind healer appointments have been going, but thinks better of it. Instead, he nods before stretching languidly and forcing himself to rise from the comfortable couch.
, just knowing you were going back to your wife every night.” Draco looks away again, takes a sip of his drink. The waiter comes back over to take their orders, and everything just feels forced now, the way both men smile politely and nod obligingly at the waiter for what feels like hours until he finally leaves them alone again.
Ah. So that makes sense. Of course there were no Wizarding children missing because Dresden didn’t go after them. He was taking Muggles. Which only serves to confuse Harry even more, if that’s even possible. Why did Dresden need a Wizard for one part of the ritual but then Muggle children for another?
He takes a step forward at that, and now the look of worry is unmistakable. I swallow thickly, my heartbeat quickening as he takes yet another step toward me.
, someone does come for me, my heart sinks. It’s an Auror, and not Potter. I notice it's the same female one that initially interrogated me. She looks a little sad, which frightens me, but smiles softly when she enters my cell.
"Yeah," Ron begins, "he doesn't seem to care about the specifics of how and why....he's just happy to have one of his best Aurors found alive. We're being heralded as heroes, Harry. It's bloody fantastic, isn't it?"
The cold wind whips savagely against my hair and neck. I'm dressed in my full Death Eater attire, complete with mask and hood. I've been assigned, last minute, to scout detail. The Death Eater who should have been here in my place was killed last night during a routine raid for supplies (victims). Voldemort decided it was a sign I was ready for more responsibility. The look on my mother's face was heartbreaking. She and father tried to volunteer to go in my place but I stopped them, telling Voldemort I was so grateful while reassuring my mother it would be okay. I couldn't risk them being hurt or possibly running into Potter. Voldemort's pleased expression was revolting.
The next week trickles by without much excitement. It feels slower than usual for Harry, who works almost obsessively on the lead he has, desperately trying to make a tricky incantation work properly. It is proving frustrating, but he is so close he can almost taste his revenge.
The world swims into focus, a swirl of color and sound before Harry’s eyes as he lands unevenly inside of Draco’s apartment. He startles at the sudden jab in his throat, a wand pressing roughly against his neck. Harry freezes instantly, blinking rapidly in an attempt to regain his vision. Draco stands before him, hair askew, cheeks pink, panting heavily. His face is twisted into an ugly sneer of anger, one Harry has seen before but not been on the other side of since long ago. This is the look he reserves for villains. Draco’s arm doesn’t shake as he holds the familiar wand at Harry’s throat.
. He is dressed in semi-formal robes that don't seem to really fit snug enough. He is gorgeous, yet so fragile it tears Harry's heart apart.
“Isn’t it though?” Ron glances over at the clock hanging on the wall, an antique that Draco had hung there long ago. “It’s half past three, and Harry, you’ve been working non-stop since yesterday. Maybe it’s time to go home and talk to your wife, yeah?”
“Thank you, Jim.” He says gratefully, already moving away from him to shuffle toward the crowd. Harry finishes the rest of his drink and discards the glass onto a random table top before making his way onto the dance floor. He begins to dance freely, feeling the heat and sweat of random bodies pressing against his as others are drawn to him. It doesn’t take much longer for Harry to feel an intense sense of joy begin to take hold of him, the pure happiness coupled with a burst of energy fills him with overwhelming euphoria. He presses closer to his dance partner, arms wrapping around his waist as they grind against each other. He can feel the music thrumming into his veins now, blood pumping in rhythm with the beat, and his eyes roll in his head from the pleasure of it.
"I won't be able to live with myself if I don't avenge him. I should have stopped it in the first place and I didn't." Harry says honestly. The guilt he feels is bone deep, drenched within every aspect of his being. There are things he can't say to his wife. Things that make the burning pain even brighter, more palpable.
It is much easier than I thought it would be at first, becoming a double agent, mainly because I am not in the inner circle and I don't hear a lot about big plans anyways. And it's easy to feel like I'm doing the right thing when all I witness are the evil acts taking place at the manor I used to call home.
"Okay," Potter says, and he sounds suddenly tiny and helpless and there is so much pain behind the words that it's almost frightening. Draco has to look away, the emotion in Potter's eyes is just so intense and vulnerable suddenly. He isn't even sure of his own motivations behind what he is doing. True, he is afraid that Potter's untimely death would somehow be connected to him if he were to continue. But is that really enough? Something about seeing him, face down on the cold stone floor in some back alley, it really effected Draco somehow. More than he cares to admit to himself.
"I'm going to talk to them Draco, I'll make sure none of the information gets out to Voldemort. Please, Draco, they'll have to believe us because everything else you have ever told me has been helpful. You won't be able to lie under Veritaserum." He is pleading, on his knees before me. I want to slap him and hurt him and scoop him up in my arms at the same time. But this, this is too painful, too much of a betrayal for me to back down.
Harry wakes himself up to his own screaming, nearly falling off of the couch in the process. He blinks owlishly as he takes a deep breath, fumbling around for his glasses. He has never experienced something like this before, the way one of his most precious memories morphed into his most hated one all in the same dream. Draco being alive must really have fucked with his head, not that he’s complaining. He half expects Ginny to be standing there next to him, as she often is whenever he wakes up in a fit. But she is nowhere to be seen. Serves him right, probably.
“Well yes…” She starts, “you were on official Auror business. I just didn’t think you should be disturbed.” She perks up, as if her answer would satisfy Harry. It served to simply do the opposite.
But it’s not that simple, is it? Harry risks losing everything the moment he decides to leave Ginny. He loses his best friends, the family of redheads that have adopted him into their hearts and home, and the wife that he still loves in his own way, even if that love stopped being romantic a long time ago. So Harry simply says nothing, and both men sit in tense silence for a little while.
“Will this be all..?” She asks, surprised, presumably because there aren’t two or three bottles of various alcohols in the shopping cart. Malfoy exhales softly next to him, opens his mouth as though he is going to ask a question, but Harry quickly cuts him off.
I am so happy I think my heart will burst. My smile is wide and bright as I stare at him indulgently. A mediwitch enters the room and murmurs something softly as she runs some diagnostic tests and checks Potter's vitals. She remarks how everything is looking good, begins to say some other things quietly. But he doesn't miss a beat. His eyes are on me and only me, waiting for my response.
"I've contacted the Aurors...they'll be here in a few minutes." The sting of betrayal is so strong that I am forced to take in a shocked breath of air.
We are all running in a daze, trying to get a grip so that we can disapparate but we need to get ahead by at least a few seconds so we can concentrate. I'm looking back at a teammate, the one in charge, as he orders us to spread out and find safety so that we can get the hell out of dodge, when I run into something solid. I bounce back from the collision, wand bared, but quickly realize it's Potter staring up at me.
"Well you shouldn't, then," my voice lowers a few octaves as I look away from his face. "I'm a monster."
“Just think things over,” Draco says finally, “and for now, we should keep things strictly business.” The bite to those words hurt Harry more than Draco could ever know.
"Why don't you go home and get some rest? This turned out better than we could ever have hoped... plus, now that you’ve got your revenge and the added bonus of rescuing a very much alive Malfoy… maybe the nightmares will finally stop." Of course Ron knows about the nightmares. Ginny probably told Hermione about them. Harry wonders what else his friend knows about his personal life. It’s not that he directly is trying to keep secrets from Ron, it’s more so the fact that it’s embarrassing for him to admit these things at times.
"It's none of your business, Malfoy. You've had your fun, now just let me go." Harry says, but the emotion behind it is gone. Part of him wants to just give up and let the world swallow him whole.
"Draco..." he says. He is frozen in place as his teammates surround us, drawing nearer. I see the female is Granger, coming in hot and fast, wand at the ready. I raise my wand again in an attempt to spur Potter into action but he does nothing, just looks at me resolutely. I have to think. For a second I consider attacking him, if only for appearances, but I don't get that chance as Granger's stunning spell hits me square in the chest.
“Have you been to the hospital?” Draco asks him, standing up swiftly and coming to sit next to him, a glint of determination in his eyes. Harry is momentarily distracted by the fresh scent of sandalwood assaulting his nostrils and the warmth emanating off of Draco in waves. He wants to press closer so that they’re touching, but holds back. As much as Draco seems to know Harry, Harry knows Draco just as well, and he knows that Draco has tunnel vision right now revolving around the case.
"Well then, do me a favor, Potter," I tell him. He pulls away enough to look me intensely in the eyes. He looks a little put off. I guess my requests so far have been very unpleasant.
When Harry wakes up again, he is alone on the couch. He feels clean and dry, and he is covered by a thick, warm blanket. He is wearing a pair of boxers that he recognizes as Draco’s. His glasses are lying on the coffee table next to him, along with a glass of water. He gulps the water down gratefully and looks around, trying hard not to feel completely bereft at Draco’s absence. Deciding that this is not the time for subtlety, Harry gets to his feet and pads softly around the flat, looking for the man in question.
“Alright, Potter, enough of the mushy stuff,” he says, pulling away abruptly and dramatically fluffing their pillows, “Besides, I have a cushioning charm to cast.”
“I’m glad you like it,” Harry answers, and then returns to his silent fidgeting for a few more minutes.
“Okay, then kindly do move out of the way. I want to see my son.” She tells him. There is a glint in her eyes that makes him think maybe she is joking, but the way the mediwitch is glancing at them nervously makes him think she isn’t.
"You want me to spend 24 hours here?!" It sounds almost too loud in the room, the echoes causing Harry's head to throb again.
Harry hasn't thought about Ginny. He hasn’t thought about anything since he discovered that Draco is alive. He sighs heavily. She will have to understand, won't she? She knows how important this is to Harry.
Severus is grabbing me, we run together for what feels like ages. He dumps me unceremoniously at the boys’ restrooms, the closest neutral area he could find. "No one saw you, you're safe," he tells me, "but I have to get out of here." And then he is gone with a whoosh of his robes. The grease from his hair hangs thickly in the air as I swallow the lump forming in my throat.
“Thank you for not judging me on this,” Draco tells him sincerely, “Or thinking any less of me.” Harry says nothing, overtaken by the emotion of it all, and Draco continues, “I know it’s not right to want to sleep the way he made me sleep for so long against my will, but I just don’t feel okay otherwise. Tilda says it has something to do with what’s called ‘survivor’s guilt,’ meaning some part of me feels I don’t deserve to sleep on a bed when all those kids can never sleep on a bed again. And as I’ve had some time to really process things, I’m beginning to learn that she is absolutely right.”
“Potter? You there?” Draco says, interrupting Harry’s thoughts like a bucket of cold water. Harry blushes, because he knows that Draco knows exactly what he was just thinking about, judging by the smirk on his face. But before he can reply, the host greets them. He recognizes them immediately, gushing to Draco about how it’s been so long and how they had missed him, his thick French accent making it a bit difficult to understand him. Draco remains the polite diplomat throughout it all, and Harry just tries to nod along and smile whenever it’s appropriate. The host leads them to their usual table, and Harry automatically cranes his neck to spot the little hallway that leads to their secret bathroom.
“Oh, that’s a money maker right there!” George chimes in. “I bet the idea came from all the celebratory drinking you and Harry have been doing since his big promotion?” Draco’s eyes are filled with nothing but pride as he smiles over to Harry again.
"Let’s get him to St. Mungo's right away," Ron starts. "Merlin almighty. How can this be? You saw him get ripped apart that day." Harry cringes at the memory. He shuts his eyes and squeezes Draco a little tighter.
“Bottom’s up,” she tells him, gulping the contents down quickly, “let’s do this.” She slams the vial down, smashing it onto the table angrily. Harry grabs the other vial and tips it back before casting a quick cleaning spell over the table. “Go ahead then, Harry, ask me.” She dares him, eyes like daggers as she stares him down. Harry has a sinking feeling that he’s made a mistake, somehow, but it’s too late for him to go back on it now.
“Yes,” Harry responds, doing the same with his own ring, “I’ll marry you too, if you care to know.” This draws a chuckle from the blonde, who grabs Harry’s hand in a vicelike grip and looks at him meaningfully.
“I’m glad it’s you.” She tells him sincerely. “I spent so much time mourning the loss of my son and now that he’s back….I just want him to be happy, and I think you can give that to him.” Harry’s eyes widen with understanding. He nods, takes her words into consideration, and before he can stop himself he says-
Harry knows that neither of them is in the right state of mind for this kind of thing. He knows this is not the way things should progress from here – they should take it slow, talk things out more, and more importantly, they both have their own respective things they need to work through and heal from. But then again, they have never been ones to do things the way they were supposed to. Things have always been anything but ordinary in Harry’s life when it comes to Draco Malfoy. They have always approached the nature of their relationship with fierce determination – whether it was their mutual hatred, their partnership as Aurors, or their passion as lovers.
to be gay, don’t you think you would be the best choice of partner for the Malfoy name?” The smirk full blooms into a smile and Harry can’t help but return it.
Everything happens much too fast. Harry finds himself standing inside of a small cottage in the middle of nowhere. A fireplace is burning, and soft yellows and oranges accent the walls. It smells of hot cocoa and it feels too hot and stuffy. It looks much too….homey to belong to a cold blooded killer. For a brief, terrifying moment, Harry wonders if perhaps there is a family -wife and children or even a family pet – also present within these walls. That would certainly make things… complicated.
Harry looks into her light brown eyes. His heart is soaring with a happiness and love he has never felt before in his entire life. He already loves his son so much that he can barely stand it. “I’d like that very much,” he chokes, and Ginny seems to take pity on him as she wraps her arms around him in a hug.
"Why don't you let me make something? I'm a pretty good cook." He finally says, minutes after staring down at the now cold charcoal briquettes on the plate.
"Harry, this is some kind of crazy dark magic..." Ron almost sounds as though he is in awe. Harry isn’t sure how he feels about that.
“Ah, you see, here is the interesting part,” Harry can hear the smile in Shacklebolt’s voice and it makes him want to strangle the man. “I got invested. The ritual was
"What does that mean, Draco? Why are you always so cryptic?" He shakes his head, and I can tell that he knows exactly what I mean.
Once seated, Harry closes his eyes, lets his head sink into his arms and works to slow his breathing. He just needs to calm down. It would be almost impossible for him to have really seen who he thought he just saw in the crowd. He must really be losing it. A gentle tap on his shoulder brings him out of his reverie. Harry looks up into bright green eyes, not too different from his own (when he isn’t wearing color changing contacts, that is). The blonde’s smile is disarming, and Harry feels an overpowering sense of affection for the man as he nods at him and accepts the glass that is being pressed into his hand.
"Your Weasel friend paid me a visit." I chuckle with no humor as he rushes to me. "What are you doing here in the light of day, Potter? You're going to get caught." He takes his wand out and with a swish my pain subsides.
“Did you hear me?” Draco’s voice cuts in. “Because your face is not conveying the emotion I thought it would.”
Harry doesn’t know how to respond. He hadn’t really planned this far out. He swallows the lump in his throat and has the decency to nod his head before clearing his throat. “Yeah,” he says finally, “Everything is fine, I just thought I’d check in and update you.”
“Why?” The words leave Harry’s lips before he has the chance to consider whether he really wants to know the answer.
The sound of someone clearing their throat alerts him to the fact that he is no longer alone. Standing in the dining room is a very clean, if still a bit unkempt, glasses wearing Harry Potter. He's also managed to borrow some clothes from Draco, a blue t-shirt and white-washed jeans. His hair is still atrocious, but lacks the greasy luster from earlier. Bright, rather large green orbs are peering at him from underneath the familiar spectacles. Draco is hard pressed to admit that something about seeing the other man dressed in his clothes is causing him to feel some type of way. But there's no time to analyze his feelings on the matter. He needs to finish scraping the toast and then apply the butter.
"Potter." His heart stops at the familiar voice uttering his given name. He hadn't even realized he wasn't alone. He whips his head to the side and sees the angel from last night, standing tall in the doorway, eyes blazing. Fragments of the events from last night swirl in his head, a confusing, muddled mess. He squeezes his eyes shut, tries not to panic.
He looks at me and sees me entirely. "It's okay Draco, I know." Tears form in the corners of my eyes even as my orgasm rips through me unexpectedly. He is not too far behind me, moaning in wanton pleasure before collapsing on top of me. He whispers a cleaning charm and tucks me back into my clothes as I lay boneless on the ground, tears falling silently. And then he is pulling me into him.
"I've cast an enervate twice now and it hasn't woken him. He is breathing but it's very shallow.” Harry is so worried and terrified that now that Draco is actually alive, he is just going to die on him again.
“Don’t,” Draco says, “you have nothing to be sorry for Potter. You didn’t do any of this to me. You saved me. You cared. You chose me, despite all the weird and suspicious shit I was doing.”
When they arrive at the restaurant, Draco raises an eyebrow and stares at Harry incredulously. “This place Potter, really?” He immediately takes his robes off, revealing grey trousers, and a long sleeved sweater matching the blue color the robes were. Harry’s mouth waters at the sight.
Harry stands and stretches languidly before padding into the kitchen to make himself some toast and eggs. His head is pounding. He fumbles around in the medicine cabinet and finds a rather large bottle of ibuprofen. It’s half empty, so he makes a mental note to buy more at the grocery store later. Hands still shaking, he takes three pills from the bottle and washes them down with some whiskey that sits on his counter from the previous night. He blanches as the warm liquid burns its way down his throat, then finishes off the rest and places the tumbler in the sink. He makes another mental note to do the dishes today, perhaps when his head is feeling a bit better.
They spend the next month in their own sexy bubble of sorts. Harry goes to work during the day while Draco works on healing at home. They have tons of sex together when Harry gets home, and spend any other free time enjoying meals together, going for walks, or reading in the drawing room. For the first few nights, at the end of the evening, Draco retreats to his room and Harry sleeps on the couch. By the fifth night, Harry has had enough.
Harry is seething. He slams his fist down on the table and fixes the older man with a piercing stare. “You speak when we ask you a question, understand?” He says acridly. Shacklebolt appears to ponder this thought, seemingly unfazed by Harry’s burst of anger, before nodding his head in acquiescence. Harry feels Ron’s hand on his shoulder as he presses him gently back down into his seat.
Thankfully, Draco decides that he does, indeed, like the cushioning charm, much to Harry’s relief. He also seems to like talking to Harry about more intimate subjects, and it’s a beautiful and wondrous thing. This only seems to aid in Draco’s healing process, and Harry notices a fundamental shift in Draco’s overall demeanor. He just seems happier all around, and by the twentieth night, he changes the wards to accommodate Harry, allowing him to Apparate in and out as he pleases.
Her words grow louder and angrier as she speaks. Harry tries to get a word in but she waves him off and continues, “Harry, I had to find out from Hermione that you killed a man today. The
"You must be very scared," she starts, and I am, in more ways than she could ever imagine. "But we want to help you. Your friend, Harry, has told us some things about you that make a great case for pardoning you. But we need you to cooperate with us, okay Draco?"
“Draco…thank you so much for trusting me enough to share with me. I’m here for you, if you want to talk more. I promise I will never judge you or your process. I love every part of you, and I only want to help in whatever way I can.” Harry says, pulling the other man into a hug. Draco nods against his chest.
Figuring the toaster oven knows what it's doing, he makes his way into his living room and searches his rather messy book case for his Counseling degree. It's been years since he needed to show it to anyone, so he isn't quite sure where he's left it. He really should keep it in a safe spot. He isn't even sure that Potter will believe a piece of paper in the first place. But Potter spent a lot of his childhood in the muggle world, has spent some time in it lately, so there's a chance. He locates it in pristine condition and then makes his way back to the kitchen, where the toaster oven is smoking and it smells of burnt toast.
The efficiency itself is quite modest in size. It’s one whole large room, with a bed, a table, a bathroom, and a small kitchenette inside of it. But that’s all Harry really needs. He’s got a decent sized wardrobe for the few clothes he has brought with him. It’s still an upgrade from when he was a child, having spent so much time in a cupboard. The rather minute size of the apartment is comforting at times, in all honesty. Not a whole lot of upkeep, and the rent is very manageable. All in all, he is happy with it, despite how unsafe others may deem the area.
Harry lands clumsily in their living room, Draco hanging heavily onto his side. He has done his best to keep the flat tidy enough to Draco’s standards, although he truthfully spent most of his time by Draco’s side at the hospital. Draco staggers to the couch and gingerly sits down on it. He closes his eyes, letting the cane drop to his side. Harry walks into the kitchen and finds the enchanted tea kettle and two mugs.
“It’s my turn, now.” She tells him, a furious glint in her eyes as she turns to look up at him. Her eyes are red and her tears are stained with mascara. Her fiery hair is pulled back into a tight, high pony tail, although some strands have begun to escape in no particular pattern, making her look almost comical. Harry dares not laugh, even though he wants to, neither out of nervousness nor at her appearance.
“Harry, no, this isn’t what it looks like!” Draco screams, scrambling for purchase, tipping the blood onto the carpet in the process. Harry watches the dark liquid as it spills downward onto the cream carpet, spreading in odd patterns as it soaks into the plush fibers. He can’t help but think of that day just a little over a year ago, when he watched his partner and lover bleed all over the ground as he died in his arms. He shakes that thought away, looking back up into frantic silvery eyes.
At work, Harry is surprised to learn from Ron and Hermione that Ginny hasn’t told any of the Weasleys why they’ve decided to get a divorce. She has only disclosed to them that it is amicable, which until that point Harry hadn’t been sure was the case. Ron checks on him periodically, telling him he is there for him if he wants to talk about it. Sometimes he encourages Harry to win Ginny back, which is only awkward and pulls at Harry’s heartstrings in an awful manner. Harry just tells him that isn’t going to happen, and promises he will talk to him when he is ready. Ron seems to take this in stride, and he is patient enough for the moment. Hermione, on the other hand, keeps giving him these calculating, knowing looks that make Harry feel really uncomfortable, so he mostly spends his time avoiding her. He has a sinking feeling that she has him completely figured out, and he is not ready to face that fact.
His anger builds until he can feel his own magic in the air around him. This has happened a few times before, one of those times helping him to defeat Voldemort. The magic feeds his rage and vice a versa until he is nearly unstoppable. His magic cackles in a thick, palpable sort of way around him, like the static of electricity in the air right before lightning strikes on unsuspecting victims. His body strums to life as it courses shockingly through his veins. Harry is not sure how to control this gift he has, but he is happy it is happening now. Fueled by his anger, Harry finally says the words he has been wanting to say without a second thought. He aims his wand with perfect precision, feels the words with every fiber of his being, and more importantly,
It's been a week since the final battle. It was down to Potter and Voldemort, and while obviously Potter did win, he sustained really serious injuries. Healers had to place him under a magically induced coma for three days in order to save him. But when they ended the coma, he stayed unconscious. It was up to him now, the healers said, although his vitals did look promising and he has been growing stronger with the passage of each day.
“Yeah I know,” Draco says, completely misreading Harry’s strange look, “I plan to get it cut as soon as I am released from here.” His attempt at humor. He tucks a stray strand of hair behind his ear. Harry cracks a smile, and Draco seems to relax.
“Harry,” he starts, “drop your wand.” Harry forces himself to loosen the hold on the wand squeezed tightly in his grip, trying not to wince at Draco’s authoritative tone of voice. Draco promptly removes the wand from him with his other hand. Harry knows that this is a losing battle. He could never bring himself to fight against Draco, even with the fresh sting of betrayal ringing in his veins. So Harry tries his best to calm down instead. He knows some wandless magic, but even then it’s too risky to try it right now when Draco’s guard is up. Draco is an excellent Auror for a reason.
“Alright then.” She sighs, “You have one hour!” She says to his retreating back as he rushes to get to Draco once again.
“I…have to be sure…” Harry starts. He feels around for the vials and pulls them out to place them on the table between them. Ginny’s eyes narrow viciously at them before turning her dark stare on him.
On Draco’s third week of being home, their wards sense an unauthorized visitor. The knock at the door is so unexpected, Harry jumps from it. He has memorized Draco’s therapy routine, and today is supposed to be his one day off. The other man’s eyes are wide as he looks at him.
“Come on Harry, I know you too well for this shit. You’re going to tell me eventually. Why not now? Now seems like as good a time as any.” But damnit, Harry forgot just how convincing the fair haired man could be. Still though, the prospect of telling him about Ginny is just so unpleasant. He takes in a deep breath and shoots a pleading look at the other man.
Harry snaps out of his flashback with tears in his eyes. He remembers the way their partnership soon proved to be unparalleled in the Auror world. Malfoy was dedicated, had worked so hard to erase his past wrongdoings. Despite the fact that he wasn’t well liked to begin with, he was so good at what he did that he soon commanded the respect of the other Aurors. Not to mention he was a fantastic partner; intuitive, reliable, and selfless. They were so good together, they were almost unstoppable. Draco's smile could disarm him in an instant. He remembers the skillful and strong way that he fought, his unwavering sense of justice…
."  He pulls me into a bone crushing hug, and I notice there are tears in his eyes. His hand tangles in my hair and for a moment we just breathe each other in.
“I just told you I had no idea, Harry. Veritaserum? Is my word not enough? Harry, am I a person of interest in your investigation?” Her words grow louder and more emotional as she speaks, her words coming out a mile per minute.
By the time I get to visit Potter in his room at St. Mungo's, The Prophet has already published a story about us. I've been held back from seeing him for a few days with all sorts of court proceedings and paperwork. Who knew being pardoned could be such a tedious endeavor?  The Prophet story depicts a torrid love affair in which I am somewhat heroic, if a bit misguided. It talks about my good deeds and how I ultimately had a hand in helping Potter defeat Voldemort. It talks about Potter's ability to see the good in everyone, his willingness to give me a chance against all odds. It even mentions my mother very briefly. I scoff at the article, but butterflies are raging inside my stomach at the thought of being outed for all the world to see. I wonder what Potter will think about all this if -no
“Hey,” he says softly, “you didn’t have to wait up for me.” He hopes his words will placate her in some way.
“Because I’m gay.” Harry has never said those words out loud before. It is at once liberating and terrifying. He waits, with bated breath, while Ginny digests that information. She looks tired and defeated as she stares off into the distance.
“Exactly. It stands to reason that if they’re related, it’s the same disorder, and Dresden might have had a lot more at stake than just curing himself.”
“I’ve got two vials, Ginny, one for me and one for you.” Harry’s voice is calm and level as he speaks to her, “I’m sure there are things you’d like to ask me too.” He pushes one of the vials across the table toward her. Ginny, who had stood abruptly just moments before, sits back down and stares hard at the vial. She reaches forward, bypasses the one Harry has pushed toward her, and grabs the one that is closer to Harry.
"Will you let him know we were here?" Granger asks. I nod, and they shuffle out of the room, whispering to each other in hushed tones. I'm a bit annoyed that his friends aren't more insistent about staying with him, but I remember Potter mentioning at some point that it felt as though they had drifted apart. I guess this must be what he meant.
"Yes, yes, Gryffindor's honor. I'm fine, Malfoy, you'll see." Draco finds himself staring into vibrantly blue eyes, and it feels weird to him, because Potter's eyes should be green. It's now or never. Potter could choose to run out and report him, and Draco would have it coming honestly, life has been too good to him these past 6 years or so. Karma was bound to catch up to him at some point. His fingers brush against warm, smooth skin as he unlocks the handcuffs with a soft click. He blushes, taking the items and tossing them into the drawer of the nightstand next to him. He backs away quickly, feeling strange.
“Thank you.” He says, sipping gratefully. He's met with a smile, a gentle touch to his shoulder. But it doesn't feel right again somehow, the idea that HE might be out there.....highly unlikely but the thought has been planted like a seed now. His head begins to hurt and he feels suddenly exhausted. Must be a bad high. Harry makes a mental note to talk to Jim about this. He gulps the rest of his drink down in one fluid motion.
“It didn’t start out as something I wanted,” Kingsley begins, “Dresden was an old family friend. I knew him when I was a child. He saved my life when I was still in diapers. I owed him. So when he approached me, even though he was long vanished from the Wizarding world, I had no choice, the oath magic ran deep within me.” Kingsley’s eyes seek connection with Harry’s but he doesn’t grant the man so much as a glance in his direction. Shacklebolt plunges onward, as if this is a story he had been wanting to tell, as if a weight is being lifted from his shoulders.
for someone. I can’t be a part of this adulterous relationship with you. I want to be free, and open, and I don’t want to
"You..." An animalistic cry escapes my mouth before I have the chance to stop it. "How could you?!" I am furious. My body begins to shake with rage as angry tears threaten to spill over.
He thinks for a moment that he’s fucked things up, somehow. “I thought you liked this place?” He asks, worrying his top lip with his bottom teeth. Draco watches the motion with a strange look on his face, one that is oddly familiar, and one that sends heat coiling up through Harry’s abdomen to his cheeks.
A soft knock interrupts his train of thought. Harry looks up from his research, sees Ron standing in his doorway. He is clean cut and tall, hair brushed back out of his eyes as he chats with Harry mundanely about things. Harry finds it hard to pay attention. All he can think about is this case and the bomb that Draco dropped on him earlier at lunch.  He wishes for a friend that is outside of their tight inner circle so he could vent to this mystery person every time he has love troubles, judgment free. They compare notes with each other to make sure they are on the same train of thought and Ron is amazed at how deep it all seems to go. Harry chooses not to tell Ron about the documents or Draco’s theory about Dresden having a ministry official as a partner. It hurts Harry to keep things from his best friend, but he also trusts Draco implicitly, so there really was no choice in the matter, at least not for Harry.
"I won't lose you." He whispers into my ear. He kisses the tears on my cheeks. I squeeze his hand in return as I drift off to sleep.
The next time we meet, Potter is on me before I even have the chance to say a word. I am late yet again, an excuse on the tip of my tongue. The look in his eyes is furious, just before he leans in. And then we are kissing and touching and undressing each other under the storm darkened sky.
The first thing he does is begins to make the report on the events of yesterday, according to the story that he and Ron came up with.  Ron works for improper use of magic, and was assigned to this case a year ago when it first happened. Their notes need to match, which thankfully, is easy enough given how much time and effort both men have poured into this. Harry feels grateful to his best friend once again. He couldn’t have done this without him.
He seems to take my silence the wrong way because he then says, "I know, it was risky and stupid... and I know I put the mission at risk, but I just-"
“Kingsley Shacklebolt.” The man says wearily, and then, his eyes connect with Harry’s and he asks, “Why am I the one sitting here? Draco Malfoy is the one who stunned me and tied me to a chair!”
“It felt like hours before he finally came barreling through the front door. And he- he had a child with him.” Draco looks away, blinking back tears. He begins to shake. Harry is unsure how to proceed. He doesn’t know what Draco needs. He used to know, but now he can’t be sure anymore. He doesn’t think he should try touching him again, not while he is remembering that. He doesn’t struggle for too long though, as after a moment, Draco steels himself and begins talking again.
"We will do what we can to protect you, Draco," the female Auror says, when it's all said and done, "we can put you in a holding cell in Azkaban and remain as tight lipped about your capture to the press as we can. We can't throw you in a permanent cell without a trial, though, so a holding cell is the best we can do. We will keep it under wraps so no one should be able to find you. We will allow Mr. Potter to say that he and his band of misfits killed you when they captured you." She smiles sadly at me before flicking her wand to remove my bonds. I am surprised by the kindness I have been treated with.
"Will I be pardoned?" I ask her, feeling disgusted at the amount of hope my voice is laced with. She flashes another sad and sweet smile.
Potter backs away just enough to disrobe me, and my hands mirror his actions on his own clothes. He pushes me roughly so that I land on my back on the wet earth beneath me. Wildflowers surround us, the scent sickly sweet in the damp air as I gasp for breath. He pulls a small bottle out from his robe pocket and opens it. I watch, mesmerized, as he tips clear liquid onto his fingers. Potter then proceeds to stretch himself wide open above me. He gasps with pleasure and I almost come undone. My hands are on whatever bit of skin I can reach. I am rock hard beneath him as he tips the lubricant over my cock, slathering from tip to base.
“The best part? All completely legal and blood free!” Draco jokes, and laughter erupts from around the table. Ron slaps his hand on Draco’s shoulder in a friendly gesture. Harry knows it has taken a lot of healing to get to this point, but Draco can genuinely joke about the past now, and he has graduated from all of his therapies. He still has just the slightest limp, but no longer needs a cane for support, and no other lasting effects. The limp isn’t really noticeable unless someone is paying close attention, however, it’s the bane of Draco’s existence most of the time. Still, that limp pushed Draco to become an amazing Potions Master, so although Harry would never say this to Draco in a million years, he is almost glad for it. Draco has never been happier than when he stands in front of a cauldron that bubbles with potion.
"I've been thinking about that...It can just be our secret. You can become a double agent. Give me information so I can kill Voldemort. And then I'll speak on your behalf when the war is over. But no one else can know right now, it's better that way. I’m not sure others would trust you. Plus, it would be the only way you won't outwardly betray your family. It will keep them safe." His words make sense, but it seems too good to be true.
“I’m actually here on official Auror business.” He tells her apologetically. “I can’t divulge too much information, but I was hoping I could ask you a few things about Annie.” Mary looks surprised but nods her head and begins to lead him toward her office, heels clinking even louder as she walks with purpose.  Once seated inside of her rather spacious office, Harry pulls out his photograph of Dresden.
Harry thrusts and thrusts until he feels Draco shudder beneath him, the other man moaning as he comes inside of Harry. Harry feels the scorching liquid spurting inside him and yells out as his own orgasm hits him full force. Draco milks him until he is spent, before pulling Harry down to meet his lips once again. They kiss with full force at first, slowly becoming more and more gentle as they come down from their high. Draco’s hands are everywhere, running along Harry’s sweat soaked back and then up into his hair as he presses feather light kisses against Harry’s mouth, face, and neck. Harry shivers against the tenderness as he works to slow his breathing. He collapses next to Draco on the bed, wrapping his arms around him and pulling him snug.
doesn’t have the clearance to start divulging Dresden’s name to the general public, he thinks he can go ahead and bend the rules just this once. It’s just Arthur, and honestly Harry thought that Ron or Ginny would have told him Dresden’s name by now anyway. What would be the harm? They are about to announce Dresden’s name to the public any second now, probably, and in that case it won’t even matter.
"That remains to be seen." I can read between the lines of that statement. If the information I have shared about this next attack checks out, then I'll be pardoned. They know I am the only double agent who has held true to their side; all others have betrayed them. This truly is their last shot at having the upper hand on the dark side. If I haven't betrayed them like all the others, I will be pardoned. Do I even deserve to be pardoned? Probably not, but I hang desperately to the idea that I could live a somewhat normal life after this war is finally over.
My wand is pointed right at Dumbledore. My heart pounds uncontrollably in my chest and my breathing betrays my fear. My hand shakes ever so slightly as I will myself to speak the words I know I'll never be able to say. I am just a boy. A boy who has seen too much and who has realized he is not cut out for the darkness his parents expect of him.
“In light of not sounding like a know-it-all, I’m not going to say that I knew this already Harry…but I had, erm, suspicions, for a while now.” She tells him. Harry thinks that she sounds even more like a know-it-all now that she mentions it. He narrows his eyes at her.
He looks at me expectantly. I don't want this moment to be ruined but the alarm bells are going off in my head. "Potter, I need you to promise me something." My gaze is open and vulnerable as we stare at each other underneath the moonlight.
"Are you real?" Draco asks, reaching a chained arm out toward Harry as if he were a lighthouse out at sea. Harry doesn't have a chance to answer before the blonde man promptly loses consciousness. Harry barely makes it in time to catch him. He is simultaneously ecstatic to be touching the other man and appalled at how little he weighs. He casts enervate several times, but it doesn’t seem to do much for him. Damn his shitty medic skills!
“This woman has spent the last year thinking her son died a horrible death,” he says darkly, “and yet you keep her from seeing him because he was talking to me? At what point did I tell you I was conducting any type of official Auror business?”
"Listen, I'm sorry, but I think I'd better go." He says, placing his hand over the attractive gentleman's where it rests on his shoulder and removing it from his person. The smile falters a bit, eyes glinting almost dangerously as he nods slowly.
Draco’s words from the previous night resound in Harry’s frazzled brain as he disapparates desperately back to their flat. He can only hope he isn’t too late.
“No I – AAAHHHH!” The scream sounds animalistic and startled, and even Draco looks surprised that he has made such a sound. He doubles over then, landing harshly on his knees and lurching forward unceremoniously. Harry jumps into action immediately. He will be damned if something happens to Draco on his watch ever again. He rushes to his side, helping him to stand.
“He liked to really scare the kids, and me. I spent most of the time terrified, until one day I tried to put on a brave face. So to punish me he…he made Polyjuice. He tortured this little girl, and the whole time she thought it was
Harry doesn't know how to answer that. True, it could seem odd from Malfoy's point of view. Malfoy's been missing from the Wizarding world for years now, and no one bothered to look for him. He didn't exactly recover very well after the war. Harry remembers reading about it in the papers. His father locked in Azkaban, mother off in France somewhere, and Malfoy himself, disappeared. At the time, Harry thought maybe he went to France with his mother. He didn't put much thought into it after that. The world just kept spinning.
On Wednesday afternoon, Harry refuses yet another potential Auror partner. He works so well on his own that Kingsley has sort of been letting him slide by, but now he warns him that it has been long enough that he should be moving on. He needs a partner, according to Kingsley, and he will have to settle on one soon enough before his patience wears thin. It’s not that Harry doesn’t want another partner, it’s just that he doesn’t want another partner. No one could ever replace Draco, and Harry knows this to be truer than anything else he has ever known. And none of this is fair, really, but he nods along and makes a promise to Shacklebolt that he knows he’ll never be able to keep.
“You should follow up there before anything else.” Draco says authoritatively. He nods his head enthusiastically, lost in the throes of Auror-hood. “Find out if any of the staff there has seen Dresden or heard from him in any way. I’d think if he was that invested he’d be keeping tabs somehow.” As annoyed as Harry is that Draco is trying to take over the case, he’s loathed to admit that this is brilliant. He’s been so obsessed with the prospect that he would have to question his wife that he didn’t realize he needed to follow up at St. Mungo’s first and foremost. He really misses being Draco’s partner again suddenly, and he actually aches from it. The pain hits like acid in the back of his throat but he swallows it down and turns to face Draco, his face only inches from his.
“About two years.” Harry answers shamefully, feeling tears pricking at the corners of his eyes. Ginny seems to contemplate that information for a bit, realization dawning on her freckled features.
“Do you love me?” She asks quietly, and Harry is relieved at the question before answering without any hesitation.
“Harry, we haven’t spoken in days and now suddenly you’ve cooked my favorite meal? I can’t remember the last time you cooked for me, so I’ll ask again, what’s going on?” She looks at him expectantly, her manicured fingers tapping on the table, a clear sign that she’s peeved.
"Harry..." Ginny's voice is soft as she repeats his name again, but there is a tired and weary edge to it. It's too dark for him to make out her face but he knows she isn't happy. She sits next to him in the bed with her knees drawn up, arms wrapped tightly about them. She rubs sleep from her eyes. She doesn't act concerned, only sighs with little patience.
“After you,” Malfoy cuts into his thoughts like a hot knife through butter. Harry blinks over at him before leading the way out of his apartment and the comforting feeling he has attached to it. They go to the same grocery store that Harry has been frequenting as of late, its location conveniently situated just along the way back to Malfoy’s flat. Harry prays that the staff will not mention anything about his usual purchases there. He’s fairly confident that they won’t, as they typically don’t say much either way.
“I don’t know him directly,” Arthur says, “not really, but a long while back, I’m talking maybe when Annie was a few weeks old, he tried to make contact so he could see her. Let’s just say it didn’t go over well.”
"Oh not only do I have the ability, Malfoy, but I'm a lot more perceptive than you think." His smile is saccharine and I suddenly feel my reserve slipping. "This war, it's made me realize a lot about myself and about what I want..."
Just a warning, this is me trying to write a slow burn, which I have never attempted before. Please heed the tags and warnings. Thanks for reading, and feel free to let me know what you think!
Draco clears his throat. “The truth?” He asks, his voice husky. He doesn’t look away from Harry as he speaks, doesn’t move at all.
“We spent a lot of time together while you were…erm…healing,” Harry starts, “did a lot of talking. She approves of me, did you know?”
About an hour later, both men are hunched over on opposite ends of the couch, grasping their bellies, caught in the throes of hysterical laughter. The takeout containers lay forgotten on the coffee table. Harry realizes, as the laughter dies down and a comfortable silence begins to settle around them, that now there really is no reason left for him to stay. He is struck by the ease of this afternoon, how seamlessly the men worked together to find solutions, how much fun they’ve had together, and even the simplicity of being able to be on the same page about what to eat. These are things that have never been quite so easy between him and Ginny. He feels Draco’s gaze, heavy and persistent, on the side of his face as he begins to clear his throat.
"You're late." He looks almost worried about me. I shake that thought away. He probably just doesn't want his time to be wasted. We've been at this for 8 months now, and this is the first time I haven't made it on time. He should really cut me some slack.
At that moment, Harry thinks, maybe this won't be so bad. He'll just stick it out and prove he doesn't have a problem. Because he doesn't, not really. He's just been going through a bit of a rough patch. But he can stop any time. He just needs a hot shower, some ibuprofen, and a proper breakfast. He'll be out of here in no time. He can thank Malfoy by doing this, show him everything's fine, and be on his way. What could go wrong?
At this, Ron muffles a snort. He takes the documents and lays them flat on the table so that Shacklebolt can see them. The man withers further into his seat, his eyes filling with tears, and lets out a defeated sigh.
“Oh, that won’t be necessary, thank you.” Draco tells her, taking the paperwork from her hands and looking it over. She smiles serenely and holds the door open as Harry and Draco make their way out. Once they hit the apparition point, Harry reaches an arm out for Draco to take. He eyes the arm as if it is attached to an alien for a few minutes before sighing and grabbing hold. Harry has a feeling the healing process is going to feel much longer than a year.
“Harry,” Draco says gently, “that was a dangerous thing to do.” Harry can feel the other man’s pulse quickening underneath his mild touch.
"It's 2:00am, mate..." Harry looks up to see Ron standing in front of him. He looks just as tired as Harry feels. He hands Harry a cup of coffee and takes the seat next to him. Harry takes a sip. It's cold, but it will do.
“You kept me going,” Draco plunges forward, eyes glossing over with unshed tears, “I held out hope that you were looking, that even after all that time had passed, you were still looking for me.” His voice gets lower as he speaks and Harry has to crane his neck and quicken his step so he can hear him. Draco’s hands are twisting in his blanket tightly. He looks much younger in those few, vulnerable moments.
“He did this once every few weeks. He took a little of my blood and drained a child of theirs. He stored it and drank it until he ran out and would need more. He would always do it in front of me and then just leave their bodies there, rotting, until the smell got to him or he killed the next one. And sometimes he would – place them right next to me, just for the shits and giggles. The first one, he sat him up next to me and told me if I even tried to push him away he would kill me.” Draco’s eyes are dark and hollow, fixated on nothing in particular as he recalls the brutal details.
“Alright mate, let’s bring the bastard in for questioning.” Ron says, his eyes alight with blazing fire.
floor right away!” She yells to the other Healer at her side, a tall gentlemen that Harry doesn’t recognize. She turns back to Harry, “Mr. Potter,” she starts apologetically, “we’re going to have to ask that you wait here for now.” She holds onto his shoulder, stopping him from moving forward as other Healers begin to wheel Draco out of sight. “Mr. Malfoy has to undergo an emergency procedure. We will let you know once you can come up and see him.”
"Potter, stop, I'm not going to hurt you." The angel says, and Harry can hear some shuffling steps as he presumably steps closer to him.
“Sorry,” he says, handing her the new cup, which she drinks from cautiously. Satisfied, she takes a bigger gulp and then tucks in to her meal. Harry doesn’t make a move to eat, just fidgets in his seat as he watches her, trying to find the right words to say.
!" He stops dead at the sight before him. Harry is stood shaking like a leaf, holding a very tiny and very unconscious Draco Malfoy in his arms. They stare intently at each other before the red head finally asks-
"Fuck," he says elegantly, watching the prone man lose consciousness. The blonde twink that had been undressing the unconscious man moments before stops his disgusting ministrations and surveys his surroundings. Draco deduces that he only has a few moments to act. He wraps his coat around himself tightly and charges at the other man, figuring the element of surprise will give him the upper hand.
“Gin – I didn’t want you to worry-“ he starts, but she stands up abruptly, slams the paper down on the table loudly.
Potter smells like sunshine and fresh cut grass. I want to drown in his scent and stay like this forever, wrapped up in his arms and his love, listening to his heartbeat until we fall asleep together. I don't deserve it but I want it so desperately that my heart shatters into a million pieces. This isn't fair but nothing in this war has been so far.
“Blood magic.” Harry repeats. He begins to piece some things together, but he is still very confused, “Draco,” He gives his hands a gentle squeeze, hopeful that it comes off as reassuring. Draco stares down at their hands blankly, blinking slowly before turning his attention back to Harry.
“Ha, of course you haven’t,” Draco replies, smiling from ear to ear, looking at Harry as if he knows him better than Harry knows himself. Harry melts underneath that gaze. And as much as he is loath to admit, it’s more than likely true.
, Malfoy?" Harry finds his voice, and although it's hoarse, he is pretty proud at how intimidating he still manages to sound. Malfoy doesn't flinch, however, but he does stop his movements, standing stiffly a few feet away from the bed.
His teeth sink into my collar bone and I can't help the moan that rips out of me. My wrists are pinned above my head by his hands, and his body is pressed flush against mine. He bucks into me, groaning as his tongue licks the bite wound he has just created. I am drunk with his scent and his warmth and his taught hardness against me. I live for these moments. This is what helps me get by on the days where it gets to be too much.
. He was fighting against his own instincts, suffering the pain and consequences of choosing not to act on his urges,
“Emergency procedure.” Harry repeats numbly. He is having trouble focusing, feels as though he is very far away from reality in this instant. “Will he be okay?” The Mediwitch shakes her head with sorrow.
“I wasn’t sure how you would react…” He starts, but Harry reaches out, lightly touching the cut on his cheek before pulling him into a hug.
She mimics him angrily, jarring his memory. He remembers saying the words, remembers that he wasn’t listening when he agreed to whatever it was.
Harry nips into his office quickly, making sure to avoid everyone else like the plague. He just needs to
“Mr. Potter,” she says, “I was just about to fill Mr. Malfoy in on what to expect now that he’s awake. Physical therapy twice per week, and occupational therapy once per week, to start. Magical core therapy will be more intensive in the beginning, and we recommend at least three times per week for the first three months.” Harry has heard this before. He looks nervously at Draco, who is nodding so much he reminds Harry of a muggle bobble head toy. Harry doesn’t miss the tight line of Draco’s lips, nor the tension in his eyebrows that gives away his distress.
“Was there anything else then? Or did you just stop by my place to tell me you’ve literally got nothing?” The words are harsh, but there isn’t any gusto behind them. It’s as if Draco couldn’t be bothered to put in the effort. Harry just looks and looks at him, fiddling nervously. “You’re hiding something.” Draco says matter-of-factly.
Later, after hours of intensive interviews and diagnostic tests determining that Potter is of sound mind and body, he is finally discharged from St. Mungo’s. Granger and Weasley did stop by at some point during all of it to invite Potter -no, Harry- to stay with them, but he politely turned them down. He had then asked that all other visitors be told to wait until he is discharged to speak with him. He wants to see his friends, he explains, but right now there are more important things he needs to do. Things, he whispers feverishly in my ear when we are alone again in the hospital room, such as getting me into his bed. I shiver in delight.
He's not disappointed, the toast is lovely. They sit together for a while, the only sounds being the crunching of toast and sipping of coffee. Draco is lost in thought, wondering how exactly to proceed from here. Does he just sort of awkwardly watch Potter for the rest of his 24 hours? He knows the Gryffindor won't last that long without experiencing some kind of withdrawal at least. And how to convince him he needs more help once it's all brought to light? Unless he's wrong, which is certainly within the realm of possibilities. He questions himself again, wonders why he is even doing this, becomes hopeful that maybe he is wrong. Maybe he caught Potter on a bad night, nothing more. But he knows the signs, is adept at recognizing them. He's done this for so long that he is fairly confident in his ability to notice things, even the smallest things others may not notice. For instance, the strained way that Potter is biting at his toast, the way he is looking around restlessly, the small droplets of sweat at his temples. The clammy git is already going through it and it's only morning. He must have it bad.
“Thanks, I sure hope so,” Draco starts, “the more I think about it, the more I’m wondering what the hell we were on when we decided to host Christmas this year.”
“Oh.” Draco blinks at him, “Come on in.” He steps aside to allow Harry entry and then shuts the door quietly behind them. The flat is neat and tidy, and while it’s always been modest in size, the décor is modern and bright. Harry remembers how surprised he was the first time he came over. The memories continue to flood as he steps carefully into the living room and takes a seat on the plush couch. Draco follows behind and tilts his head toward his bedroom, where the door is open and light pours from the inside.
"If you were expecting gourmet food, you'll be sorely let down." He says instead, attempting at humor, and slams the plate of darkened toast onto the table. Potter eyes the toast as if its got mold growing on it. He gulps down some more of the coffee. Seems to think a long time before he speaks again.
“Hi,” Draco rasps, coughs, clears his throat, and tries again, “Hey.” He says more clearly. The Mediwitch smiles in Harry’s direction.
“Potter,” Draco starts, “look around… Does this flat look like a place that could accommodate a child?” Harry doesn’t like the tone of voice Draco is using. It doesn’t sound promising. The fleeting happiness he had felt moments before is plummeting along with his heart as it sinks deep into his stomach. The acid builds in his throat at the thought of having to choose between his only son and his only true love. He looks around the flat as instructed, although in his heart he already knows the answer. The flat is tiny, even for the living standards of one single person. One small bedroom, a tiny living room, a half bathroom, a dining room that barely fits the table sitting in it, and a miniscule kitchen. There is no way they can fit a child in here, even if only half of the time, when they can barely fit the two of them.
"I'm sorry, Potter, I can't let you leave like this. I have a feeling you've run from something, it's the only explanation as to why you are here. And with no magic, we might just be an even match." Malfoy snorts at that, as if using his short comings for humor would somehow make Harry feel better. But that's not right, because since when did Malfoy care about how Harry feels? And since when did he have a sense of humor?
“Gin…I-We um…weren’t expecting you.” Harry says lamely. He scratches at the back of his head in nervousness. He really hasn’t seen or spoken to her directly since she kicked him out. Their only interactions have been through letters and paperwork finalizing their divorce, which was amicable, at least on paper. Harry has not forgotten that Ginny holds all the power here. With just a few simple words, she could turn her (and therefore Harry’s) entire family against him.
"I've been thinking lately, Malfoy," he starts. He is so close to me that I can feel his breath on my neck. He looks determined and there is a darkness about him that I hadn't noticed before. It scares me. I am not one to back down, however, so I square my shoulders and look down my nose at him. I still have an inch or two on him so at least there's that.
"Draco," he says it so quietly I have to strain to hear him. My name hangs from his lips for a few moments. I consider saying something to fill the tense silence but he speaks again before I have the chance. "I have to get you out of here....they won't listen to reason…they want blood." He says the last word with a sob.
"You know you can't do that. This is bigger than me, Potter. You know that. You know you are the only one who can end this war. You know you have to be the one left standing-"
“I know, I’m sorry about that,” she starts, looks back to Draco, “You look well, Draco, I’ve heard you’re healing quite nicely.” Draco nods dumbly and takes a sip of his tea. He quickly composes himself though and addresses her directly, an air of aristocracy that only he would be able to pull off in the face of such a tense situation.
“Take me home.” He says tiredly, and Harry nods against him. He would do anything for him. This is an easy request. He helps Draco get to his feet, and then hands him his cane. Draco scoffs at first, but quickly realizes he needs it, then leans heavily against it as he takes his first wobbly steps.
“Harry,” Draco interjects. A smile blooms across his face, and it is absolutely breathtaking. He runs his hands up along Harry’s robes collar softly, up until he is cupping Harry’s face in his hands, and says, “do shut up.” In an instant, rough, chapped lips are pressing fervently against his. Harry’s heart floods with the painful, needy
"What is there to discuss?" He scratches at his head, voice growing much too loud for their bedroom. "I have worked tirelessly and now for the first time in a year I may have a lead on his killer. I hardly think there is anything wrong with that Ginny, he deserves justice." He works hard to temper his voice and calm his nerves.
It is Harry who orgasms first, unable to hold out any longer. He bites his lip and rests his head against Draco’s shoulder as he empties himself into him, the pleasure coiling around his insides and causing him to see stars. His hand continues to pump Draco passionately, and Draco cries out with the intensity of his own orgasm, spurts of hot liquid shooting out onto his stomach and chest. Harry pumps him until he is spent, and they both collapse onto the couch in a messy heap of exhaustion. Draco squirms around underneath him until they are laying chest to chest. He wraps his arms around Harry lazily tracing his scar with his fingers and stroking down his face before working his hands back through his hair in a comforting fashion. Harry grips onto him tightly and sighs into his neck, feeling suddenly very tired. Sleep overtakes him almost instantly.
“He was studying this complicated spell Potter, it was all part of some kind of ancient ritual. He wouldn’t talk to me for days on end, but when he did it was out of boredom, and he would tell me little tidbits. Like the fact that my pure blood was helping to “heal” his, and that he had to start the spell with a complicated curse that tore me apart but kept me alive. He said it took months to get that right, which he had to practice on a lot of innocent people. And another time he told me he “owed” the spell, and that’s why the children had to die. Blood for blood, he would say. He was ill, I think, and the worst part is…over time, he seemed to be improving, like the spell was actually fucking working.”
“Sangiunum Purgo…” She says softly, and then, “Harry, where is Draco?” Harry doesn’t have time to answer, as Ron comes barreling into the living room, face red with some kind of emotion, although Harry can’t tell for sure what it is.
We are silent for the rest of the night, but neither one of us leaves. We simply sit with our backs to the wall for a long while, so close I can feel the warmth of his shoulder next to mine. I drift into a restless sleep.
His wand lights up, signaling that the incantation has worked and they have about 30 seconds before being transported to the killer's exact location. If Harry succeeded in casting correctly, the bastard shouldn't see them coming and none of his wards should stand a chance. Harry's insides are burning with anticipation. He feels the familiar tug behind his belly button and then...
Ron simply nods and sighs. Harry knows that Ron understands how thankful he really is. He was there for all of the late nights, the (to his embarrassment) shed tears, and the tireless work to hunt down Augustus. Harry watches his retreating back until he can no longer see the taller man. He gets up and sends Ginny an owl:
“Yes, I’ll marry you,” Draco breathes afterward, slipping his ring onto his left ring finger with awe. “In case you were wondering.”
“Henry,” the man says, “you’re like clockwork my man. Same as usual?” Harry nods, returning the smile. He pulls American muggle money from his own pocket. Lost amongst the crowd and shadow, an exchange is made. Harry takes the pill and swallows it down in one fluid motion, allowing the bitter taste to wash over his tongue and throat.
"Harry...I know he was your partner, and I know you want justice for him. But do you think he would have wanted to see you like this? Beating yourself up, obsessing over this case, having nightmares almost every night....Do you think he would have wanted you to be in this much pain for this long?"
"The fuck it doesn't, Potter. Do you even remember what happened last night?!" It all comes flooding back, the panic and the hatred and the cold, hard ground against his face. The flick of a cigarette, shocked grey eyes. Harry shuts his eyes against the torrent of emotions, gasps for breath.
“Hold on,” Hermione says, “you can’t just rush Shacklebolt in like this, they’ll bring you down before you can even get a word in edgewise.” She flicks her wand at the documents, watches as a duplicate set forms in front of her. “My set will be temporary, but it will be enough for me to get started on my research. Harry, bring these to the ministry, and Ron, you stay here until you get the go ahead.”
“Let’s even the score then, shall we?” And Draco makes fast work of Harry’s t-shirt and jeans, stripping him efficiently, making a show of doing it without the aid of a wand. Harry would laugh if he wasn’t so bloody turned on, plus his brain is just basically mush at this point. “You are so fucking gorgeous.” Draco breathes, and their mouths connect again, hands roaming each other’s bodies freely, wrapping around each other and pulling each other close.
"Draco," he gasps, "fuck, I'm gonna cum..." I feel the hot spurts of liquid as his cock twitches in my fist. A few more thrusts and I fall apart on top of him.
"I should be asking you the same question," when Malfoy speaks, his voice is melted velvet. Masculine, smooth, and somehow so soft. Gone is the arrogance that Harry remembers. "Why is it that the Wizarding World's Golden Boy suddenly shows up at the same establishment that I have frequented for years?"
“Potter,” he says dangerously, “I don’t want your charity sex.” But this doesn’t deter Harry, only makes him want the other man more. It’s a challenge, one Harry is more than willing to accept. He grabs Draco by the collar of his robes and pulls him up to a standing position. Their lips crash, and Harry feels like he is melting from the heat that emanates from both of them. He begins to remove Draco’s clothing quickly, wanting to feel his skin, to kiss him everywhere. Draco breaks the kiss breathlessly and pushes Harry away.
Their erections slide against each other hotly, the pleasure shooting down Harry’s spine in sharp currents. He places his hands firmly on Draco’s chest and then exerts just enough pressure so that Draco begins to move backward. Getting the hint, Draco continues to move, pulling Harry along with him until the backs of his legs bump up against the couch. Harry pushes him down onto it before straddling his lap wantonly and pressing his mouth against Draco’s neck. He licks his way down the blonde’s collarbone and then makes contact with his right nipple, relishing in the sharp intake of breath, and the way Draco tightens his hands around Harry’s hips. All the while, they are rocking against each other, creating a friction that is at once too much and yet not enough. Draco slides his hands downward over Harry’s buttocks and grabs him firmly, aiding him in rocking against him while his mouth nibbles at his exposed shoulder.
“Potter?” Draco has opened his door, squinting into the darkness before a spark appears at the tip of his wand. “What are you doing out here at this-“ He cuts himself off, taking notice of the suitcases floating along behind Harry. Harry looks up at him pitifully, shrugging slightly before letting his shoulders droop into the epitome of a pathetic blob. Draco nods sharply and steps aside to allow him entry. He is still wearing his quirky pajamas from earlier in the day, and Harry wonders if Draco has left his apartment at all today.
Once he has done a quick visual sweep of the place, he pulls out his wand and begins to cast basic diagnostic locator spells, knowing full well that they would probably bring up no results, but acting from muscle memory all the same. It is comforting to do something familiar like this, and it honestly makes him feel a sense of accomplishment, however small. That is why Harry’s eyebrows rise into his hairline in surprise when the spell locates two rather large stacks of documents that had clearly not been there before. He immediately begins to rifle through the documents, and finds neatly scrawled notes describing the blood ritual in great detail. Bits of papers have been taken out of books from all over the world in all types of languages, having been compiled through extensive research. Letters in a different handwriting have been collected in chronological order, held together in a thick stack, all of them signed “
“Mmm. Sleepy…” Harry tightens his grip on the other man and wraps his legs around him. Sleep overtakes him before he has the chance to think about anything else.
"You definitely shouldn't trust me, Potter, but things will go much more smoothly if you just cooperate. This is what I do, and I can show you proof of that. At least, so you can see that I know what I'm doing. Just let me help you, Potter."
“I’ve been thinking a lot about this Harry. A mother is what I have wanted to be more than anything in this life. And we both have wanted this for so long. And although I’m still so pissed at you, I know that I won’t always be. I’m more upset that you lied than about anything else. I don’t care that you’re gay. I didn’t tell anyone else about why we divorced because even in my anger, I knew it wasn’t my place.” She pauses for a second to blow her nose on a tissue she has pulled out of her purse.
But Harry feels nothing. The only thing that finally allows him to harden beneath her and reach his completion are thoughts of a man who died long ago. Harry remembers the weight of a hard body pressed against his. He thinks he can still smell him; the earthy, spicy scent of sandalwood and a hint of something entirely unique. The minty, sweet heat of his breath. He can feel tight, lean muscles on his fingertips. Taste chapped, full lips against his own.
“Potter,” Draco says, and Harry tries not to flinch at the use of his last name, “I knew you would come for me.” Harry thinks Draco meant to be rye with this statement, but it only sounds sincere in his ears. He waits a moment, walking slowly toward Draco, not wanting to startle him.
"And your friends?" I ask. He blanches at me. I don't even know if he considers them his friends anymore.
“Well actually I was looking for Ginny,” Harry tells him, “I nipped out of work early but I can’t seem to remember where she said she would be.”
I look back up at him. Huge mistake. Tears are streaming down his face and he shakes his head vigorously. I am aching. Aching for him and for my selfish need to live and to get to love him for just a little longer.
He, on the other hand, is perfectly calm. He tells me that he knows the truth. He tells me it's not too late. I can come to the side of the light. I will be protected. I lower my wand. I want to believe him more than anything. He looks so genuine. With my wand lowered he doesn't move a muscle. I figure if he were lying he would have grabbed his own wand and hexed me by now.
“Relax man, there’s no one out to get you… maybe you’re just a little paranoid?” His dance partner asks, placing a hand on his arm. Harry stares at the hand for far too long. Maybe that’s it, it’s happened before so it’s not completely out of the realm of possibilities. He just needs to get a grip. He can feel his heart beating so rapidly in his chest that he thinks it might burst out at any second.
Draco seems to think for a moment, eyes glazing over in that same perturbing way they had earlier in the day. He starts ticking things off on his fingers as he speaks, words going almost a mile a minute.  “I know for a fact that Dresden needed a pureblood Wizard of ancient lineage for the ritual. “Pure blood for pure blood” he would always say. And he needed me to think I had died in order to start the process, which is why he used the cutting curse. The cutting curse caused me to bleed a lot, which I think he took a deep sort of pleasure in, but I’m not entirely convinced the cutting curse itself had to be used for it, just the part where I had to believe I was dead. “
"Draco, please, I love you. You have to trust me on this-" he tries to draw nearer but I fumble away from him.
After the war, the wizarding world was left in chaos. Aurors worked tirelessly to wrangle Deatheaters and copycats alike. By the time Harry finally finished his training, he only caught the tail end of all of that. The fun cases, the ones that used to get his blood pumping and adrenaline going, seemed to have died along with his partner. An era of mind numbingly boring peace followed. Apart from the case he had secretly been working on for the past year, Auror work consisted of dealing mainly with petty crimes and corporate greed. As a result, work is agonizingly slow most days. This week was no exception, despite Harry feeling like a rubber band about to snap.
“I’ve already scoured every piece of literature I could get my hands on. I can’t find anything either.”
“He aimed his wand at me and I felt this pain in my arm, and that’s when I saw that I was bleeding. He collected my blood in a cup and then healed me. The child – he was a little boy, and I remember his face so clearly. He must have been 8 or 9 – he was so scared. He just kept looking at me with this fear in his eyes and then-“ Draco shuts his eyes, breathes in deep, places his hands over his face in despair.
“Ummm well, no pattern, really. They were all pretty young, I’d say under 13. There was no specific skin color or identifiers that he went for…but, come to think of it, they were all dressed pretty strangely.”
