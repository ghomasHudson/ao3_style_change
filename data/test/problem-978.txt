“Not the soup, you oaf. Why did you ask for my favorite color today?”
“It must…” Draco took a deep breath. “It must have played really beautiful music.”
Wind swept over the empty space, chilly. Draco stared, like in the aftermath of a dream. Cho baaed at him and nudged his hand. Stepped forth and smothered his face with her belly.
“It’s around the corner, then.”
So Draco did. It was a wondrous thing to watch Potter laugh, like watching a flower unfurl its petals—breath held—one by one. First the corners of his lips curl; then his eyes crinkle, his cheeks folding into themselves. His laughter bloomed from his chest: still wet, yet the clearest thing Draco heard all night. All day. His shoulders shook as he threw his head forward before slumping back. Draco, awed, threw one horrible joke after another just so he could watch it happen again and again. At some point the jokes turned into memories, into how they’d slipped from the steep rock and hit their buttocks, into that one time Draco crashed the vase in his Charms OWLs because Potter made a face. The last laugh still lingering at the corner of his mouth, Potter reached out and touched Draco’s jaw, amused.
“By more than a month.”
“Only a little.”
“Tell me about it.”
“—try to balance myself upside down on a flying broom? Huh? How else—”
“Okay.”
Gently, Draco cradles his head and presses it close. Harry buries his face into Draco’s shoulder, blinking furiously.
Draco waited until his nerves got the better of him, and then tentatively pushed at the door. It opened without a budge. He was mildly astounded to find that the wards still recognized him, accepted him and let him in. Something warm tingled and spread across his chest, something foolishly akin to hope.
The rain had started again by the time the cottage emerged into view. Sparse, heavy droplets smashed onto the tractor as Potter cursed, hastily parked the tractor, and fought the keys with a mouthful of
“What are you doing?” he still asked.
Elvis comes on. Draco shushes him with more drama than necessary and closes his eyes, starts swaying his hips. The two mugs of tea bob in his hands, threatening to spill.
Harry darts his gaze back to the book.
“I miss you,” Draco continued, “I miss you.” It was a chant, as though with every repetition it eased the pain however slightly. “I miss you. I miss you.”
Harry peeled an orange and handed a wedge to Draco.
Draco sleeps like a rock through it all.
Harry snorts. His chest lightens, and he feels like breathing again.
“Try again.”
“Your old sweaters make your skin all itchy. I heard—I heard this is better. Cashmere, I mean.”
“Why?”
“What are you doing?” Harry murmured. His mouth found Draco’s hair and kissed, messily, strands of hair catching at the corners of his lips.
—eyes down-cast and cheeks flushed, pulling at the seems of his shirt, as though abashed, as though worried that Harry would find him annoying. Harry sat him down one day and, wrapping his hands around Draco’s, said, very slowly,
The day went about its usual course. Potter didn’t speak much, but didn’t dodge him, either—didn’t step away when Draco quickened his steps and fit himself into the space next to him when they walked. There was something distant about his eyes, about his words. Something horrible whenever he smiled. Draco pushed down the muddled mess in his head and pretended nothing happened, tried to breathe through his tight chest.
There was something, too, about Potter’s smile. Of watching his cheeks fold, watching the lines at the corner of his eyes crinkle. His eyes were a depthless green, bright. Something that softened a spot in Draco’s chest, something he looked away to altogether.
They bring the kebab to the couch and wake Hermione up. Hermione laughs, too, when she learns that Harry knows the news, and slaps Ron’s arm for breaking the news without her—hugs Harry heartily. The kitten munches on its can of salmon and, afterwards, falls asleep again on the shelf.
“Yes.” Draco blew at the tiny motes of charcoal, lifted the parchment for Potter to see. “Look like her much?”
“But Potter.” Draco tilted his head, trying hard to seek the right words. “It’s…it’s been ten years. Don’t you want to go back and just…see? For yourself? London has changed. You have changed, and—no, no. Listen to me. Look around you. There’s no one, nothing. How can you just let it...slip away? When you get to come back after all you’ve sacrificed? You are barely thirty. You have friends who care about you. There are so many places you can go, so many people you can meet…and instead you just sit here and watch sheep?”
“Oh.” Luna takes a bite of her cookie in surprise. “I rather thought it would make him sad.”
Draco thought, and offered his palm for her to lick. Her ears were dipped in the colors of the sunset, like petals.
Draco still remembered how good Harry was.
“What are you looking at,” he muttered, teeth clattering. Cho still hadn’t lambed yet, her belly heavy underneath the coarse wool. She looked altogether unimpressed, baaing again before she bowed her head and continued to graze.
One was from his work. The other was from Astoria.
After breakfast, after the sausages and scrambled eggs and orange juice—Draco wearing Harry’s loose t-shirt as he cooked, Harry grinning and teasing—Harry said he wanted to show him something. They climbed onto the tractor. Harry explained that the sheep were in the fells now and would stay there for the rest of the summer until it was time to clip them. They required little care and would do well on their own.
“It’s just so tiring,” he whispers, voice hoarse from disuse. “I just wanted…to get away from all of it. Just for a little while.” He laughs. “No one ever leaves me alone.”
Touches Harry’s hard jaw with his fingers, cups his face.
Draco sat and stared into midair, the quilt tangled between his legs.
Draco blinked. His fingers paused in the middle of tearing the bread. When he resumed, his cheeks were flushed pink and he looked just a little pleased, dipping the piece into the soup. Scooping up onions with it, placing the bread into his mouth and chewed.
after another, each time shouting louder then the last, frightening Cho until at last he stormed out of the doors and cursed. The string of words dampened by the heavy doors left ajar, the silver of a
“There is something awfully brave and unbearably fierce about falling in love, don’t you think?” Astoria smiled, too, and squeezed his arm. “Be terrified. It’s okay. Just don’t forget to open your arms.”
Draco looks lost for a second. Then his eyes focus again. “Are you going to report me?”
The kitten meows, thin eyes blinking.
“No shite.” Draco laughs, rubs his eyes. Buries his face into the nook of his folded arms atop his knees. “God.”
Draco’s mouth fell open. No voice came out.
Draco eyed him warily as he peeled off the paper.
As though time fell and shattered. Draco pushed the brooch back into Harry’s arms, scrambling up—Harry’s eyes widened—and stumbled out of their warm little house, into the cold winter night.
“Ah, lovely darling my sweet!” he called, crouching in front of the short pen. Cissy galloped towards him—tripping over her own legs—stumbled, scrambled close. Draco laughed and scratched her ears. Cissy bleated, loud and impatient.
Silence.
He was conducting an experiment concerning bird courtship rituals for Granger.
The door opens, and Khatri steps out from behind it, her wand tucked in her robe pocket. She checks something off her thick notebook, looks up. Catches Harry’s eyes and smiles warmly.
Harry sobbed.
Draco snorted, then couldn’t control it anymore and laughed, proper and loud. Potter smiled, going back to his hand.
They were beautiful. Their faces black like coal, beige-colored wool long and thick and airy around them like a coat. White markings splashed across their faces and ears, shining like fresh snow—splashed across their short, thin, knobby legs like a mindless painting. Horns curved elegantly around their heads. Their amber eyes caught the warm lights as they baaed, wandering about.
He has never been to a sunflower field before, but that hardly matters in his sleep. They are always in full bloom. Large, brown plates framed by bright egg yolk petals, each long and straight, spread to their fullest. Embracing the sky. Embracing the sun. The air is warm, the dark earth firm underneath his bare feet. The sun kisses him golden and tickles his nose. He closes his eyes, just to hold onto the moment a little longer—
Back at the flat, Draco groggily finds the bedroom, drops himself onto Harry’s bed, and falls asleep.
Ron, of course, doesn’t know. He pours himself some more wine.
Everything looks so strange at the hour before dawn—neither night nor day, the sky lit grey at the corners, the thin veil of night lifting and blending into the first beams of dawn. Grey shadows cover the smooth marble surface of the kitchen isle, the wooden floor, the amber tree rings stretched long on the cabinets. The glass of water sitting between them, droplets slipping along a messy trail on the inside.
That night, he couldn’t sleep. Drank whiskey clean by the balcony. Sometime during the night he climbed out of bed, hazy with determination. He needed to find it. He rummaged through his wardrobe, dug pass the scarves and three-piece suits and dress robes, pass his socks and heavy coats—and still he couldn’t find what he sought. But he couldn’t stop. It was to be found, as a destiny was to be fulfilled. He flung open the suitcase he’d unpacked several weeks ago, threw his boxers all over the floor, until eventually he pulled open the very bottom of his five-drawer dresser beside his bed, and there they were: the three woolen sweaters, inky green and cream and wine red. He crawled back into bed and curled himself into a ball underneath the duvet. Clutched the sweaters tight in front of his chest. He was at rest now that he’d found them. Breathed in the faint smell of sheep, stilling lingering between the threads. Fell asleep.
“Come on, Malfoy.”
. The same silver stag, only this time in no hurry: strolled, at its own pace, towards Draco. Its antlers like thin, strong branches of trees, its legs long. Head turned from time to time, but never distracted; the direction at which it came for never diverted. It stopped in front of Draco, bowed its head.
“No,” he says, soft with incredulity. “No, that’s mine.”
He might never see Draco again.
Inside the black velvet lay a brooch. A sprig of orange blossoms, intricately molded: the pearly white petals, the golden stamen; the leaves, thinly beaten bronze. Pearls accented at the tip of the branch as flower buds.
He saw it before they arrived. Just a small patch at first, blocked by the angles of closer fells, but then widened as the tractor climbed uphill and slowed to a halt, as Harry turned off the engine. His breath stopped.
Draco’s mind supplied helpfully. What an opening.
The following silence was just as uncomfortable. The water boiled, and Potter added two teaspoons of instant coffee. They watched the powder swirl, rising and falling with the bubbles, with the flow of heat.
“No.” Potter’s voice cut through it all, stopping him dead in his tracks. “No, they won’t be coming.”
“She likes you,” Potter said.
The wall ended where the hill broke into a fell. He stood, one hand on the smooth, round stones, and tilted his head to look far. The North Sea was a faint smudge of blue beneath the white fells. He remembered, then, why he was here at all. Why he almost died in a blizzard and was now stuck in Potter’s cottage where there wasn’t even a decent breakfast, wasn’t even a single egg, wasn’t even marmalade. It rose like a gentle wave, surrounding him, welling to his chest, made it difficult to breathe.
“We’re like penguins,” is what comes out, a hoarse mumble. Draco pauses before chuckling.
The wireless is still singing, music muffled through the walls. The lyrics float across the corridors, one note fading into the next.
“Give me a kiss,” he says.
“I’m so sorry,” Draco kept saying, voice muffled and wet, “I’m so sorry. This is such a horrible thing to do. You didn’t even have a mother, and now I’m crying in front of you for—oh dear, that was even more horrible. I’m sorry.” He let out a wet laugh, cried some more. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”
“Why must I be responsible for everything,” he sighed exaggeratedly. “You have a baby’s capability to take care of yourself, Potter. I’m not—what? What are you looking at?”
But then Draco stepped into the cottage and, standing in the parlor, ceased breathing altogether. It was two days earlier than what they’d scheduled; someone canceled, said the agent, if they wanted to visit now they could, she was in town but the keys were in a locked box under an empty flower pot. It had just rained, the sky not quite clear yet, hints of grey threading through the pale blue sky. Draco took a careful walk around the empty cottage, touching his finger to the frame of a wooden cabinet, the shell of a window. Harry found the backdoor and pushed through. It opened to a small patch of garden, the earth hard and bumpy, withered vines tangling all over the decrepit fences. The sea was near, the bay a smooth arch down the hills. It reminded Harry of Shell Cottage.
He couldn’t unsee the letter. He tried to draw her—sitting here, in the middle of an endless sea of white, he tried to draw her. Found her face a blur in his memories, only a faint tinge of what it had been: a curve of a smile, the color of her hair. He couldn’t remember the tilt of her brows, the mesh of her lashes. Couldn’t remember the bridge of her nose, the cant of her jaw. Couldn’t remember the shape of her eyes, only that they were brown and melted into an array of a sunset—the glinting of golden light, a fraction of a memory. He panicked and tried again, yet no matter how many times he erased the previous sketch she didn’t look right. Not Astoria. Not Astoria.
Draco huffed and looked away. In front of them, the land opened and stretched out. The hills rolled and disappeared underneath the edge of the fell then reappeared further, like waves towards sea. A thin valley carved through—the bare, rocky path of a stream—disappeared once again. Sparse trees and skirts of forests dotted the silent world afar, as did thorn dykes, the occasional tiny silhouette of a gliding raven, the couple sheep that had wandered down.
when the kitten wakes, but it jumps—hisses—and scrambles off to the bookshelf as if its life depends on it. Curls itself into a ball where Harry cannot reach, stiff in the shadows.
form.”
On the bookshelf, the kitten quietly flicks its tail.
Below them, the city was still asleep. The street lamps still lit, faint in the dove grey of dawn. A car ran down the long street and disappeared with a turn into the buildings. The sun was rising, but they couldn’t see it from here save for the bland light inching up the sky, bright white among foggy blue.
The slanting lines of droplets weren’t visible in the dark night, only the sound of them falling against the windows, against the roof. A steady hum, barely noticeable yet soothing. Draco sat by the window with his knees drawn to his chest. The droplets collected each other until it became too heavy and raced down the glass, leaving wet trails behind.
But Draco downs the glass in one go, his cheeks flushing in an instant. He’s been nervous since last night. Kept climbing out of bed to check on his robes, insisting that he needed to iron them again, that he needed to polish his shoes again, and was Harry certain he didn’t need to bring another gift for Granger and Weasley? There was a pearl hairpin that nobody in his family had used since his great-grandmother Marjorie’s wedding, perhaps Granger would like—
No one had ever spoken so bluntly to him like that. Astoria never talked less just because she talked straight. It would forever be a mystery to Draco how she survived this world to her twenties without being hexed every five minutes. But survive she did, and told Draco the only reason he still hadn’t asked her out was, instead of the pureblood courting tradition facade he’d pulled, because he was scared of his own past. Draco had spluttered, blushing down his neck and defenseless.
“You did this?” Draco asked, slow. His mind still trying to catch up. “All by yourself?”
“I promise,” Harry said, grinning. He flopped onto the ground, folded his arms under his head. Draco sat down, too, wary—then slowly relaxing, watching the heather fields roll under the winds, a thousand shades of a single color, regal and vibrant and tender all at once.
“You’re not doing anything to me—”
Then the warmth that came with recognition—
Dinner was cooked with a strange familiarity, as though reliving an old dream. Harry leaned over the counter by the sink with his arms crossed, teasing. Draco complained about the emptiness of the fridge, that Harry didn’t know how to buy groceries, didn’t how to feed himself, and how did he even manage these two months without Draco if he couldn’t even buy the right vegetables? To which Harry replied that there were obviously enough in the fridge and cabinets combined, the fridge was over half full and there were onions in the cupboards. Draco murmured as he stirred the pot of lamb stew. Harry laughed, bright and clear, and kissed him from behind, leaning his weight onto him as he dragged Draco sideways so Draco nearly fell over. Draco nearly knocked over the pot—spluttered, incredulous, reached for his wand to hex Harry out of the kitchen, but before he could Harry kissed him again. There was something about every kiss they shared, as if they couldn’t refrain from closeness any longer. As if they couldn’t bear not to lay their hearts out so the other knew for certain. In the end, Draco knocked his head into the top cupboards, Harry crowding into him—his hands roaming over Draco’s back, his sides, up and down as if mapping out his body—before Draco smelt the burnt stew and startled, jumping to shut the stove.
“Thank you for coming,” he said quietly. “I…I am happy. I am.”
“Not that long,” Harry said, warmly. He walked over. “It smells sweet in here.”
“Yeah?”
He fetched a couple potatoes, a tomato, an onion. “Please don’t tell me they’ve been here since the age of Merlin.”
They drove to Bridgerton’s heather fields before dawn. The night lingered in blues and purples; the air was cool and sweet with mist and dew. Harry rested his elbow on the open truck window as he drove. The wind ruffled his hair. A small smile on his lips, he closed his eyes for a brief second.
Luna nods. Cracks the last seed open and reaches for a cookie. They are cranberry with chunks of almond and key lime glaze. Rather ordinary, Harry thinks, if not a little sour.
— so Potter threw him a sweater and a thick pair of pants last minute. They, like Potter’s scarf, smelt faintly of sheep and were much warmer than his own clothes. The sweater hugged him gentle and loose, and Draco couldn’t stop tugging at the tiny fuzz balls where the wool was rubbed rough.
“They stink, too. Did you know we helped him with it even after the lesson ended? Merlin. The whole open ground stunk of rotten fish.”
“Ah.” Potter raised a brow. Then, out of nowhere, “Christmas is coming.”
“You’re a Potter, too.”
He wasn’t really sure, then, whether he should date at all. His tattoo never bloomed, never even sprouted, when all his friends got their flowers through their teenage years: Pansy’s pansies, Blaise’s amaryllises, Theo’s cosmoses. The tiny seed in the center of his chest was knocked slightly sideways by a
“Does Ron sing at home, too?” Harry asks slyly.
“Ah.” Draco nodded grandly. “That explains everything.”
“To be in here, you mean?” Astoria asked, still looking at the violin with a faint smile. “No, not at all. It is more famous for the condition in which it has survived. The varnish is unworn since 1716, the painted edge-work on the scroll still intact. It’s probably because it has always been a collector’s piece. Initially purchased by Cozio di Salabue from one of Stradivari’s sons, sold it to Luigi Tarisio in the 1820s, who kept it in a case…” She turned, tilted her head at Draco. “It’s rather sad, don’t you think? A violin that was meant to sing, locked in a glass box for three hundred years?”
Draco made an incredulous noise. “Either way. You might like this life, Potter, but I would love to head back to my flat in London. So if you would so kindly point me in the direction of the Ministry…ah, tomorrow morning, perhaps, so I can—”
“My bloody letter is what it is.” Draco snatched it from Potter’s hands. “Now you’re just reading my letters like they’re yours?”
Draco reluctantly complied. Potter waited for him at the door, his face hidden in a crisscross of shadows.
want to leave?”
The bright green eyes were a haywire. Draco caressed his cheeks, searched his face. Harry’s breath was heavy, his shoulders tense. Why hadn’t he noticed?
in his baggy jeans, old shoes - albeit slightly nicer ones than normal - and white t-shirt. Draco hoped that he had changed from his meeting before coming here, but knowing Harry he’d probably simply removed a sport coat and left it somewhere. The thought caused his stomach to drop and he felt  his anger start to dislodge, freeing itself from deep within Draco’s psyche.
for me to disappear for a few years into an advanced degree then to walk into the company blind.” He took another sip of wine. “I wanted to go for four years and then get my advanced degree, but my father was insistent I get something at a faster pace and join the board immediately.” Draco looked up at Harry. “I didn’t know if I would get another shot at it at the time, so I opted to earn my bachelors in management and an MBA at the same time.”
“So that’s how it is?” the man intoned, leading them onto the dance floor, “anonymous hook-ups do it for you?”
Since their first kiss, Draco had encountered Harry twice more, each meeting ending with an additional sweet kiss that had sent Draco into the rest of his day with his head spinning and his lips tingling and, try as he might to hide it, a slight smile on his face.
Especially not when Harry Potter was presuming they were friends.
“No.” Harry laughed. “But you take soy milk in your coffee and you never put cream cheese on your bagels. I figured either you were either lactose intolerant or on some weird strict diet. Either way, it still eliminated regular mozzarella.”
Draco went from one form of trust issues to another, as his funds were safe but his confidence in others was completely in the red.

“Well then, why haven’t you made a move yet?”
And, Draco knew, he would miss Harry too. But he wasn’t going to be a sap and say it out loud.
“And how do you propose we do that in...” Draco looked down at the clock on his phone. “Twenty minutes?” Draco asked before taking a bite of his bagel, the sweet and salty mixing on his tongue sending pleasure signals to his brain and Draco sighed. It was certainly going to be an interesting twenty minutes.
do you think that
“Not important,” Draco said pulling down the man’s pants forcefully.
Draco gritted his teeth and took a sip of his drink to help contain his anger. “If you must know,” he said with practiced ease, “I was invited to this event by Pansy Parkinson. You remember her, don’t you, Flint? The one who kicked you in the balls after you cheated on me?”
The way Harry said it, all while looking at Draco expectantly like it was obvious he, Draco, would tell him, was, well, not endearing exactly, but still kind of cute. And sweet. But it shouldn’t be any of those things. Not from someone as casual and informal as Harry seemed to be. Not to someone like Draco.
“Why didn’t you study that then?”
“So,” Harry said, casually taking a seat and passing over Draco his coffee, “do you want to start or shall I?”
“Why?” Draco asked, “what’s yours?”
“Honestly, not that I’d really know what to look for, but I would say it was true love from the start. At least on his part anyway. She had just started to do ‘haul’ videos - you know those videos where people go shopping and show off what they bought?” Harry was nodding and Draco felt like a fool for having tried to explain it, “so he sent her some clothes to try from their latest line along with his personal information. I told him he was crazy. And apparently I know nothing about love because they are going on well over fourteen years strong now.”
anyone.
for him so he shut up and danced.
It was all very complicated for what should have never been any sort of relationship with the other man in the first place.
“Good to meet you.” Harry reached over and somehow balanced all three of the freshly poured pints in his hands. “I would say you can enjoy your beer with us over there, but somehow I feel that wouldn’t be a welcome invitation. So...” He glanced down quickly before looking back up. “I’ll see you around, Draco?”
“Because I thought you might react like this. Besides, I only just found out at the beginning of this week. If they like my newest book, they might buy it for more than my last. This could be a really big opportunity for me, Draco,” Harry pleaded with a soft, slightly-worried, smile.
Heart sinking for some reason he refused to name, Draco turned to the counter to get his coffee.
“Hey, Draco,” a familiar voice came from behind him, “this guy bothering you?”
“I’m so sorry,” Harry’s voice sounded sincere before morphing into a more jovial tone, “I really am, but you have to admit - we really need to stop meeting like this.”
Harry’s groans encouraged him and Draco felt a moan of his own coming on as he fully sheathed Harry inside himself.
‘What
“What do you mean, no one ever just likes you?” Harry asked, eyes wide.
“Then what?” Draco narrowed his eyes. “You can’t possibly-”

likes you.”
Those shoes stepped over in between Flint’s. Harry held him up by the collar of his shirt. “Leave him the fuck alone. If I ever see you with him again, you’re dead.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Without thinking Draco groaned and looked around frantically before lowering his voice in a warning tone, “Not in the coffee shoppe,” he grunted out, “we’re not in a club-”
for themselves or if he existed simply to bail them all out all the time.
Pansy was speaking, but Draco wasn’t listening. “I have to go,” he told her, ending the call through her protests and immediately searching the internet for the article. He copied the first search result and popped it into a message box.
“Hey,” he said, “I’m sorry. I’ll be there.”
“You do realize,” Harry said before he sat, “that if I sit down here that means we’ve progressed to friends.”
“Well, how will I know what to call you when I cum?” The man had a glint in his eye.
Draco wasn’t sure he should be the one Harry was confessing this to. His own family dynamic was anything but supportive.
“Well it’s kinda what I do,” he offered. “I'm a writer.”
“What do you want,
Blaise blinked in response but other than that didn’t let on his surprise. “Yeah, I am. And extra exposure of me for the brand is never really a bad thing.”
” he insisted but it came out almost as a whine.
“My name- it’s Harry. I figure you should know who you’re snapping at.”
No, Draco hadn’t known that, but then there had been a lot of things he hadn’t known about the man he let fuck him for almost a year.
“Right then, so why did you go into it?”
No one would be more surprised by the action of agreement than him. If Draco really thought about it there was no way in hell he could go back. He’d started his first round a semester late and that had been difficult enough. Now he was too old, and besides, unless something catastrophic happened, his father wouldn’t approve of him going back to his little ‘experiments’.
“But, if you want me there-” Harry pulled back, suddenly stopping the kisses, and green eyes looked at him intensely. “Draco, you do not have to handle this alone.”
desperate.
Though Blaise would probably never consider it unlucky.
The man tilted his head. “But what should I call you then?”
It was a quick kiss, and he pulled away after but left a hand in Draco’s hair, gently petting.
So he ignored it all. “Third question,” Draco warned.
They stared at each other for a beat, challenging. Draco found he didn’t really want to look away.
“Yeah,” Draco voiced, sipping his coffee. Only nothing
, exposing Draco’s prick to the cool air.
- if his father didn’t understand it, it wasn’t supported.
“Well,” Blaise drawled after he’d left, “That’s new.” He took a sip of his drink before turning to Draco. “Is there something I should know, '
"Obviously," Draco replied, "why wouldn't I be on time?" The response came out harsher than he had intended, which only made the moment that much more uncomfortable for him.
“Don’t worry,” a soft chuckle hit the air, “you’re the only one I’m dating right now. In fact, you’re the only person I’ve dated in ages.”
Draco shook his head. “Even if I want to, I can’t. Tomorrow is a work-day and I-”
“Yes, it was truly a mix up. But it doesn’t matter what I say. You probably won’t believe me no matter which way I tell you. But even though it was honestly a mistake, well, I’m a man inclined to believe in fate.”
Draco gritted his teeth. He hated being baited. He drew in a breath and saw the barista hold out his order. Reaching for it, he took a long sip before it had a chance to spill. It was hot as Hades but certainly worth it.
Draco’s brain worked overtime to process
“You’re smiling,” Harry said, green eyes bright.
“So, what are we?”
He hoped his outside was slightly more composed, but he doubted it.
“No.”
Calling on his self control, he ended up ordering a toasted everything bagel instead, which was probably only marginally healthier - certainly less sugar at least. The reality of it was that it was probably anything but as he planned to smother it with peanut butter anyway. Or jelly. Whatever they had that wasn’t cream cheese.
And then they were gone. Draco lifted his glass of white rum to his lips and took another sip. He wasn’t sure what had exactly sparked the “let’s go out and get wasted idea.” He blamed Blaise. The man always managed to get a VIP booth at the last minute any night of the week. But he couldn’t say that it had sounded like a bad idea at the time. The week had been rough and as icing on the fucking cake Draco hadn’t seen those green eyes again since he’d asked him out.
The phone line went dead. Turning to his secretary Draco narrowed his eyes. “This better be important,” he muttered to himself as she ushered him out of his office.
Draco privately thought Harry probably had way more a grasp on what they were doing, but he didn’t dare voice that out loud.
Draco nodded with a small smile, “Go on,” he gestured, “I’ll call a car.”
Harry’s lips crashed against his own, sending him spiraling and forcing him to put his coffee down on the table so he could kiss back. The kiss was passionate and felt oddly like a promise. It reminded Draco of the phrase “sealed with a kiss.”
“Watch where you’re going!” Draco snapped. ‘Just great,’ he thought looking down at the rapidly forming stain on his lavender shirt. Today was not turning out to be his day.
“Oh my god you do!” Harry laughed. “You totally do. How about this? We try skating today and if we feel like we want this to become a more permanent thing that we do, you can invest in some skates, okay?”
Green eyes looked at him with some measure of surprise. “That might be the most information you’ve ever told me in one go.”
Draco barely felt the cold air before Harry’s hand covered him, tentatively stroking upwards. Draco thought he might have heard him mutter, “Like velvet,” but he couldn’t be sure before his lips were claimed again. Harry simultaneously flipped them over and pushed them up further onto the bed.
Draco thought it was a bit of an unconventional way to confirm, but it wasn’t a question. As butterflies threatened to swarm his stomach, Draco remembered that Harry had used up all his questions for the day anyway.
“Just answer it.”
It was almost a frightening revelation that contact with this man could make him feel like he was seven-years-old again. That thought was made even more concerning due to the fact that the things he wanted to do with this man were decidedly more adult-themed.
And their upcoming date was really just some odd, promised, formality.
He ran the back of his hand down Draco’s cheek. His fingernails burned. A firestorm brewed under Draco’s skin.
“-there’s other kinds of writing, you know,” Harry was saying while looking down at the man.
“Did you just move here? I have never seen you before last Monday?” Harry looked almost
What in the world was going on with him lately?
Draco got a hold of his senses enough to sneer, “And you didn’t take a moment to read the name on the cup?”
“Are you laughing at my name?” Draco asked, trying to shove down the jittery feeling in his body. He was almost positive it wasn’t caused by the caffeine. At least not solely.
“I am not capable of this!” Harry growled, grabbing Draco’s wrist. He’d never seen the other man so mad. “I just wanted to bloody kiss my boyfriend goodbye. And I thought removing us from the coffee shoppe would somehow give us
Draco couldn’t recall mentioning anything about dessert.
Did he even like himself? And why did it feel so wonderful hearing the words in Harry’s voice?’
“Do you always sing to yourself?” Draco asked as they moved to wait for their drinks.
Drawing in a breath Draco looked at Harry. “Let it go, okay? It’s fine.”
“Draco?” his secretary’s voice carried through the speaker of his office, “there’s someone here to see you.”
Was Harry asking him on a double date before they had even been a first? Draco fought the urge to shake his head to clear the thought.
His voice sounded sexy and the dim light made Harry look almost golden. Draco felt like putty under those skilled hands. “Yeah,” he whispered, “I do.”
“Never?”
‘This cannot be happening,’ Draco thought as he turned back to the bar to see the barista holding out his coffee. Snatching it up with a muttered thanks, he turned back around only to bump into the man behind him.
Flint stepped forward and spit on Harry’s shoe. Draco noticed they were soft brown leather, the nicest pair he’d ever seen on the man.
Draco bit the inside of his cheek and schooled his expression back into a line. “No one, mum.”
it was.
“Yup,” Harry said. “That’s all I want to know.”
At that Harry laughed. “No, that’s WALK THE MOON. I can’t take credit even if I wanted to.”
It wasn’t just that he wasn’t used to his previous lovers caring like this, Draco decided, it was that he didn’t know what to do when someone
“I don’t do dairy,” Draco said cooly.
Draco wanted to lean forward and  kiss those lips again. Or pull Harry close and hug him or just hold him for a while. Draco wasn’t even sure he knew
For the first time since meeting the man, Draco felt genuine fear stab through his heart. “You mean, like a reporter?” He asked slowly, with what he hoped was intimidation, but his nerves were far too on alert for that to be successful.
Harry scuffed his shoe against the floor. Old Converse today, Draco noticed, the white rubber so scuffed that it was nearly black. Draco’s perfectly polished shoes shone in comparison.
, of all things, that had made Draco tingle all over, and a promise from Harry to plan a second. The man was just lucky he hadn’t disclosed to Draco just what they would be doing beforehand.
“Why?” Draco narrowed his eyes. “Are you going to buy me a drink?” The thought was almost as horrifying as it was elating.
“Look, I really am sorry I didn’t tell you about the tour. If I had known it would set us back this much, I would have never- well,” Harry gestured his hand in a dismissive wave, pausing to place their order before turning back to Draco. “Anyway, how have you been? What did I miss around here?”
Harry let out a laugh. It was bright and sharp. “I learned my alphabet when I was four.”
Draco felt like he might faint. Or die from happiness. It was a weird tug-of-war happening.
The smile Harry gave in response was the biggest one he’d yet to see on the man.
And it was comped for them most of the time anyway.
“That’s what you want to ask me?” Draco was taken aback by the question. He was expecting something far more dangerous. Perhaps something Harry could sell to the media or maybe even write an article about for himself. Or something he could use as blackmail. ‘What was Harry going to do with something so innocuous as Draco’s favorite color? Why did he even want to know?’
wanted to, he wanted it to be on
If he felt like going back to woman, he might have taken her up on her offer, but as much as he recognized he could do with a good shag, he wasn’t
“I will,” Harry promised softly, reaching down to grab Draco’s wrist and pull him up, then tugged him forward with some urgency. Draco quickly reached back for his half-consumed coffee before he allowed Harry to pull him out the door and around the corner of the shoppe.
“I started writing children’s books when I realized I wasn’t going to have any of my own.”
Draco had tried very hard not to resent them for it all. To escape the misery of Malfoy Manor, Draco had enrolled in University – a rebellious yet constructive way of spending his family’s money, which was rightfully his in the first place and while it was still there.
repulsive to you?”
Draco narrowed his eyes. Hadn’t he heard that recently? He vaguely remembered Harry mentioning it. Draco vaguely recalled that there had been a lot more feelings attached when it had been called out the first time around.
As it happened, Draco had thought of potentially going to a nearby bar, but he was second guessing that option now that he felt slightly buzzed, full, and warm. He looked down at their interconnected hands.
“Why Draco,” Harry said as his green eyes lit up, “are you negotiating with me?”
“Is that your question?”
you.”
He shook his head. Draco would never let himself be that desperate again.
Draco felt his headache build. “Well you haven’t ever met me.”
“Eh?”
he still good at this?’
He laughed.
Harry’s smile didn’t falter as he slid a piece of folded scrap paper across the tabletop. “Will you meet me here this weekend?”
“I know that,” Draco said gruffly, annoyed that he was being patronized.
“Roasted chicken with root vegetables. Dr. Dumbledore says that cooking and eating meals at home allows for more control over portions, sugar and processed foods that can result in higher energy levels and a longer life-span…”
Looking into Oliver’s blue eyes he knew - he was never going to feel good about cumming under those eyes.
“Do you have a trace placed on me or something?” Draco asked with a slight bite in his tone.
Draco didn’t have a good answer for her.
He caught it just in time.
room, with
'Before me.' Draco couldn't get his mind past those two words.
Draco wanted to wipe the kind grin from Harry’s face. Was he flirting? Draco couldn’t tell but he felt oddly warm - and he was almost certain it wasn’t from the coffee. He sighed. It was far too early in the morning to deal with this mess.
Draco thought about it. If the whole thing was unavoidable, would it help or hinder to have Harry there with him, by his side? The words he thought he might have heard played in his mind: I love you.
The question snapped Draco out of his thoughts, as he turned to see green eyes squinting at the menu from behind his glasses.
“I see you smiling.” His mother wagged her finger in his direction. He hated when she did this. She always pointed out when he had even a ghost of a smile on his face. It was awful and had the effect of making him want to hide any hint of a grin constantly. “Who’s making you smile like that?”
He tapped his foot impatiently.
Closing his eyes to shut out the world around him, he tried to picture he was on his bed at home and the cock in his mouth belonged to a man with bright green eyes.
Draco’s caffeine deprived brain needed an additional second to process all of Harry’s words, preferring to remain permanently stuck between ‘I told my friends about you’ and ‘I’ve been avoiding you’ as the words reverberated in his mind.
“Move,” Harry encouraged after a moment, “ah- ride my cock, Draco.”
And since when did he want Harry to stalk him anyway?
Harry lifted his shoulders in a shrug, hands remaining in his pockets. God-damn-it, it was almost cute.
“School. I met them on the first day and we just kinda clicked right away.” Harry shrugged. “Do you want another freebie question? That was kinda a short answer compared to your story.”
as to be completely and utterly distracting - he couldn't help but wonder if they were already involved.
“Why?” Draco demanded cooly, trying to remain as detached as possible and
“Shush,” Draco said, not unkindly. But Harry’s eyes snapped shut at that, almost like they had been waiting for
“You mean you want to rent skates?” Draco asked to cover up the fire building in the pit of his stomach. ‘That ice better be damn cold.’
“Hmm, cold demeanor with ice-blue eyes? Heart of, clearly not gold, but a nice silver, perhaps? Drinks hot coffee with a shot of soy to try to help melt it?”
shirt was slightly wrinkled, unbuttoned on the bottom, and untucked like a filthy
Had Draco been asked about it beforehand, he would have said that the only difference between his first official date with the man behind those green eyes and their morning coffee meetings would be the amount of sex involved.
Harry laughed at that. “Your ego knows no bounds, huh?”
Draco wanted to say the same. Wanted to say
It wasn’t until later that night that he realized that may have been Harry’s own way of asking him out on a date.
Draco’s mouth actually dropped open. He closed it quickly. “What?” He hissed, “and just who are you to make up stories about me?”
Draco wanted to shoot something. He just hoped he could make it to his office without anyone else bothering him.
“Well, Harry,” Draco sneered, “I am
His skin tingled.
‘Has it always been that messy?’ Draco thought. He couldn’t remember.
Blaise would be replacing that.
“Shite,” Harry said just as Draco muttered “Shirt." Their voices sounded equally urgent. It was, of course, Harry who laughed first, reaching down to tug his shirt up over his head.
Harry squeezed him tighter and Draco allowed himself to melt into the touch.
Harry shook his head again. “Maybe I should have said my parents.”
Draco had never been looked at like that in his life.
“You?” Flint stepped past Draco and he turned around to see Green Eyes standing there, looking more livid than he’d ever seen him. “No offence, but I could snap you in two. You’re almost in a more sorry state than this one.” He rudely gestured towards Draco.
Harry tilted his head at him, blinking those bright green eyes of his. It took all of Draco’s willpower to stand still with that expression looking at him. “Has anyone told you you’re a real pain in the arse?”
“Let’s get cleaned up, shall we?” he asked Harry, still slightly breathless.
“You wanna dance anyway?” the man asked, looking Draco up and down, holding out his hand to pull him up, “What’s your name?”
Draco didn’t know when he’d become a fan of poetry, but Harry’s words certainly seemed to be working their magic on him now.
Resigned, Draco gestured noncommittally for him to sit down.
And it was a
Harry smiled. “I will take that as a yes. Let me plan it. This weekend. You and me.”
“Do you always take dates on picnics?” Draco drawled, stretching out his legs.
It was only after Draco had his blond roast in front of him that he felt safe to ask his one question of the day.
“Draco!” Pansy greeted him with a hug. “Thanks for coming. I knew you would. We will have to get some footage of all of us together for my channel while you’re here-”
Harry’s green eyes sparkled when he looked into them, and he knew that together they would be able to weather any of the coming storms. After all, what was Green Eyes without Blond Roast in his life?
it was all worth it.
warm and his head spin and his knees buckle and it was over far, far too soon.
“Vodka cranberry for me.” Pansy smiled sweetly.
“Let me help,” Harry whispered, reaching up to run his hand through Draco’s hair while the other traced patterns on his stomach before both moved to his waistband to free Draco's cock.
Draco’s mouth watered as suddenly food sounded like an excellent distraction. “Alright, hand me a slice.”
The next time Draco saw Harry it was two days later and he was
“So,” Narcissa intoned, flashing her practiced motherly smile at him, “what’s new with you, dear? Anybody special in your life?”
“Oh?” Draco felt the fire burning inside him, burning behind his eyes, in his chest, down to his toes. “You can handle it? Well,
His mother sighed at that.
Draco sighed, not wanting to admit how good that idea sounded. Looking up he caught a glimpse of them in the mirror, Harry’s eyes closed, his lips still pressed to Draco’s neck. Looking at himself, Draco saw a vulnerable expression he almost didn’t recognize.
Draco nodded. The question felt suddenly both extremely stupid and very important. He wished beyond measure that he really did have a superpower to tell when someone was lying. He didn’t, but he could get close.
“I write,” Harry smiled a genuine grin that lit up his eyes.
“Do you swim a lot?”
and signing copies
“I trust you'll have no problem kissing me from now on.” Draco made it a statement deliberately.
with him lately?’
And it wasn’t even 8am yet.
‘Did he love Harry too?’
Harry pulled back. “Lead the way,” he said, holding out his hand to Draco to pull him up off the couch.
“I don’t know why,” Draco protested, “I never asked you too.”
“Should we go back to our question game? Or is that only for the coffee shoppe?” Draco asked, after the silence became too uncomfortable for his liking. A part of him felt like it should be contained to their coffee meet-ups - he was not going to label them ‘dates’ - but the parameters of their little game would give him some social structure to latch onto and not feel like he was suddenly skating on thinning ice.
“We’ve shared coffee together,” Harry offered in retort. “I now have your name, and we’re even working on a nickname now. We are coffee friends at least, Draco. Whether you want to admit it or not.”
(See the end of the chapter for
and Draco moved himself into position and sank down onto Harry’s cock.
“What? You didn’t want to swallow?” The man -
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy?” she asked, “President Riddle has called for you. Should I tell him you’ll be by to meet him?”
He almost believed it.
“Yeah.” Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “I’ve been with guys, but never in a committed relationship. Never really wanted one with any other bloke like that before. Before you.”
Harry stood up and walked around the table, reaching out to pull Draco to his feet. He put his hand on Draco’s lower back and his other came up to Draco’s cheek again before he leaned forward and tentatively pushed their lips together with much less force than the first kiss but no less passion.
“And you waited until the last possible minute to tell me?” Draco glared accusingly.
and wrong and soft and
Draco couldn’t remember the last time sex had felt this good. Every nerve in his body was on fire as Harry pounded in and out of him, hiking his legs up higher and higher, pressing them together, moving faster and faster, until Draco felt heat pool in his stomach and his balls tighten.
Before Draco could even respond, Harry had turned around to address the barista. Draco directed a glare at the back of Harry’s head. Harry’s black hair gave him an idea. “Actually I was thinking of going with a dark roast this morning, double shot of espresso," Draco deadpanned.
They just looked
Draco heaved a sigh. 'It was going to be a long date,' he thought to himself.
“Not everyone knows their editor beforehand,” Draco reminded, recalling that Harry’s editor was a girl named Luna who had been his friend from school, “it’s easier to get a book deal that way.”
And so he was completely taken aback when the date produced nothing of the sort at all.
the answer.”
ordering anything to eat more and more frustrating.
Draco held out his hand, “Pleasure, Weasley,” he said, sounding far too much like his father for any type of comfort. “Draco Malfoy.”
“It’s
Draco found himself wanting him to put it back.
Draco felt like he had died and gone to heaven and Harry hadn’t even touched his cock. He didn’t know sex could even be like this.
Draco was drunk.
“You first then,” Harry encouraged, opening the floodgates for Draco to ask anything he wanted.
But he wanted
He was so frantic that he didn’t even baulk at the idea of ‘lovemaking.’
“Well, I know you didn’t ask, but the tour was interesting. And pretty inspiring. We were raising money for orphanages and foster programs and-”
“Oh?” Draco turned around to look at the man more fully. He glanced up into those green eyes and his mind went blank before he scanned his eyes up and down, noticing Harry was wearing old trainers today. They looked like they were one short walk away from having holes in their soles. “How’s that? Do you work on administrative reports or something?” It wasn’t his best comeback but it was the only thing he could think of at the moment.
It was definitely planned by Harry because there was not a snowball’s chance in hell that Draco would plan a date of take-away pizza in the park.
else. Draco sighed and noticed his father listening in with mild interest. Damn his parents for pushing. Maybe if they hadn’t put all their eggs in a single baby basket they could have had a normal child.
Draco didn't know why the man even bothered to wear glasses if he still needed to squint. "Would I take you somewhere that has something bad on the menu?"
Swallowing down his rising anger, they were out in public after all, another thought occurred to him. “Are you sure you’re not stalking me?” Draco asked suddenly, narrowing his eyes.
Draco allowed himself a moment to think about it. It would probably get himself into a world of grief with his family to make something like this official, but if last night was any indication, Harry was well worth it.
“There you are, Draco,” Pansy’s voice floated out of the crowd as she came over and wrapped her hand around his back. “We were wondering where you disappeared to.”
But then he also couldn’t remember the last time sex had been
‘My how the mighty have fallen.’
The cheese was surprisingly melty and good for a vegan imitation and the tomatoes in the sauce tasted fresh. The dough was soft and the whole of the pizza had a homemade quality that oddly reminded Draco of Harry - hot and simple by design, but flavorful and complex once he took a bite.
“Happy and well-adjusted?” Harry supplied with a sigh, curling in slightly on himself. “Let’s just say I’ve done a lot of hard work to get here. Writing helps me. A lot. There have been stretches of time where, well, it really saved my life - mostly, because it really only,” green eyes glanced quickly around the coffee shoppe, as if checking to see if anyone besides Draco was listening in, “well, it kept me occupied with something
Harry pushed himself up on his elbows and looked down at Draco, blinking. "Yes, what?"
"Oy!" Draco complained. "None of that, now."
"And you accidentally followed us to the jurassic age."
"Tell me." Her bright, blue eyes looked at him with trust and love.
Hold that thought.
Flesh-eating slug - leopard slug (Thank you CuriosaMaxima for the translation!)
"Really?" Draco asked sceptically. "Then what are you worried about?"
the beginnings of the history of mankind - but the sensation still sucked.
They managed to find and summon another fish before their first one ran out, and they unearthed a handful of slim, vaguely carrot-like roots. Having consumed those without ill effect, they ventured into the berries and after a few lucky guesses finally used up the bezoar. At that point, they decided that their repertoire of edible foodstuff was large enough to see them through the remaining ten days and stopped trying new things.
Harry stared blankly at Hermione.
So, no prison: good. Seeing Malfoy in class, however, with the other boy rubbing it in his face how much Harry had missed while Malfoy had gotten at least half an education during his first attempt at seventh year… well. That, Harry could have done without.
He actually felt a little nostalgic as he looked around now, thinking he would never be able to return to this exact time and place. He'd never climb naked-assed into that tree, never munch on those berries wondering if they would nourish him or kill him, never again be faced with a charging triceratops bull, and never again see that bright light growing in the distant noonday sky…
"Alright," Harry said. "Thanks Neville."
hoax.
going on and decided not to disturb the two love birds in their tree and stick this one out on my own. I'd stayed alive this far, I could go another ten days. Easy. And, surprisingly, I did."
"You remember that herbology project we had to do in our last year? Where Harry and Malfoy somehow managed to hand in Helga Hufflepuff's restored formula against dementia and I got full marks for my theory on the evolution of the devil's snare?"
"Creationist," Harry supplied, distracted from his nausea despite himself.
"Apparently," Neville explained with his eyes closed, presenting the picture of weary acceptance, "Malfoy,
Harry rewarded Draco with a peck on the cheek and stroked his erection some more. Then he cautiously slid one finger across Draco's pucker. A sharply in-drawn breath and one of those enticing full-body shudders told him just how sensitive a spot that was. Carefully, he dipped the tip of one finger in the ample supply of lubricant there, then circled Draco's hole with it. Draco writhed and gasped in response.
Hannah cocked her head. "Not really. And, I take it, it didn't stop you either?"
A moment ago, things had been heated, he had felt nervous and aroused and unbelievably exposed. And now? Now he just felt protective.
Harry yelped and hastily crawled off Malfoy.
Harry frowned. "You know: Big, scaly reptiles that lived on our planet a few million years before humans did and died out because of an meteorite strike or something? Stegosauruses, T-rexes, and flying pterodactyls? Please don't say that all wizards are creationists and nobody ever told me!"
Heh. The first time they had sex
design, I was sucked into the age of dinosaurs right alongside Harry and Malfoy."
Swallowing his mouthful, he eagerly bit off more. They had no salt or herbs to season the fish with, and there was a bitter tang that Harry suspected resulted from their blundering attempts to remove the gall bladder, but it was still really nice to have something warm and rich in his mouth after a day spent exploring their potentially hostile environment.
Imperial dragonfly - praying mantis
"Umh, yes." Draco was one of those rare wizards who believed in the tale of the three brothers. Go figure. Well, at least that made this part a lot easier. Harry was not interested in a return to the fourth year status quo where Draco called him a nutter and
"Your father talks about nothing but muggle artefacts, doesn't he? So you must know what this is good for. Do muggles use it as a weapon? Or is it, as the name suggests, you know…"
"Not now," Draco snapped. "We just agreed, didn't we? Let's talk about that later." He was still looking toward the mountains rather than at Harry, but there was a telling flush high in his cheek.
Another long stretch of time passed without a word spoken between them.
Harry hooked a thumb over his shoulder, pointing back to the grazing non-firebreathing, earth-bound lizard.
Well. Okay then.
Golden snidget - duck
"Malfoy?" he asked hesitantly when the other man just kept sitting and staring at him.
His aching knees reminded Harry of the fact that they had yet to see any dinosaur kneel or crouch; were they physically incapable of bending their knees? And if so, how did the larger ones lay their eggs, what with their butts so far above ground?
Turning his face aside as though he could no longer stand to look at Harry, Draco quietly muttered: "But, you know, I do love you, too."
His internal voice sounded like fourth year Draco Malfoy.
Harry could give him that.
Harry cleared his throat. "So. These… dragons. Were they like our present-day dragons? Did all of them fly, and breathe fire?"
He looked around the Gryffindor common room, with its friendly, warm colours, its solid stone walls and its distinct lack of flaming celestial missiles. He smiled and shook off some of the frozen terror that had accompanied him all the way back up from the Chamber of Secrets and the remains of their failed runework. He was home. There was no reason to be nervous, things were fine.
"Dammit Harry," Draco cursed, "don't stop now!"
Neville sighed. "So, I realized that they had a

Malfoy gave him a wary look. "I wouldn't."
herbology we are talking about. I mean, can you imagine meeting Helga Hufflepuff?"
The corner of Harry's mouth ticked up. "You do, do you?"
"Umh… Draco?"
Sadly, Harry was not acting due to some careful deliberation resulting in a willingness to trust Malfoy when he bit into the fish - he was just hungry and determined never to have a repeat of his lean Dursley days if he could at all help it.
Nasty.
Harry's head flew around to face Malfoy. Woah. How were their faces only two hands apart? Nearly close enough to kiss, if one were so inclined.
"Count me in."
"What? You're already covered in it anyway."
Great.
Harry mutely pointed a finger at the western sky.
"Yeah, because a wizard would never believe anything without proof."
"Look, you don't have to say it back. Or say anything, really. Just, ignore I said anything, maybe? Please? It's probably just the sex talking, anyway, and - "
"- unless you give me copies of every. Single. One. Of those pictures!"
"You… really?"
hadn't he? Harry had accepted the information in the spirit it appeared to be given: Purely informative. A thing
"Huh?"
Hannah chuckled. "Yes, though they brought each other insults and ill-timed potions ingredients rather than pretty flowers."
Meeting her eyes and suppressing a shudder, Neville admitted: "None of us ever made it to the founders' time. I don't know how the chaos duo ended up getting her formula to work regardless, but I can promise you it wasn't from talking to whom we met in the past."
"But that's illegal!"
He really, really hoped this wasn't just going to be a one-time thing. But until he knew for sure? Better make the most of it. "So you want to keep going?" he asked, needing to make sure. "Not too sore?"
Malfoy's jaws worked, but nothing came out for a moment. He finally opted for a simple "Yes."
"Yes to the first, and no to the second. Please, go ahead." He sounded so put-together, as proud and composed as a marsupial lion at rest even as he was half-hanging from a tree, naked, hair tousled and his lower body covered in his own spunk. How? How did he do that?
Harry gathered his little bundle of trophies - a few scales one of the larger dinos had lost, a few nuts and leaves for potential later identification via textbook, a couple of bones and, to his ever-lasting shame, a piece of bark from the tree Draco and he had their first sexual encounter in.
"Much better," Draco commented and Harry agreed. He was quite convinced that never in the history of mankind had the feeling of drying come pulling at one's skin been lauded as a positive experience. Admittedly, they were some ways
"Two days later, an entire tribe of raptors tottered past me, sneezing and wobbling on their legs."
So yes, if Draco wanted to feel safe and cared for and to let go of responsibility for this one day, Harry understood. His heart pounded faster in his chest. He understood, and he was unexpectedly eager to provide.
He'd been struggling with a bit of a cold when he embarked on this adventure and of course, the icy river water did nothing to alleviate his symptoms.
"Er. No?"
Harry pushed his finger further in. Once all the way in, he turned it a little this way and that.
Had Harry known that he was going to prove his own worst fears absolutely founded within the hour, he would probably have wondered if holding onto his cloak, stone and wand was really worth it.
"The bark chafes," Harry admitted grumpily.
"Do you think we'll be safe enough down here?" Harry asked, looking around mistrustfully. It wasn't entirely unthinkable that those rodents rustling past earlier were dangerous. Maybe the tiny furry fuckers had poison in their armpits or something, who knew?
"I've never been so close to another person before." The words came out unbidden, like they just had to be spoken.
"Rude." A huff.
Together, they watched the flaming shape of the approaching meteorite rapidly grow in the western sky. It was kind of pretty.
Harry's eyes narrowed. Slowly, he stood up and joined Draco in looming over the still seated Neville. "And just what did you take pictures off while you were
"Please…"
"Did they refuse to take you?"
"Sod off, Potter."
"Yup," Harry agreed sunnily. "That's what you get for throwing in with an uncouth Gryffindor."
Harry once more took his holly wand in hand and raised both eyebrows at Draco. "Let's see if I get this right…" Visualizing the gesture Draco had made clearly before his inner eye, Harry pointed the wand at a nearby leaf. "Lubricus." The leaf drooped and glistened in the sunlight with its new sheen of bright, viscous fluid.
"You really, really should have. But, too late now to cry over spilled… er. Hehe."
"The-they… d-d-dinosaurs, they…
"OUFFF!"
And was it any wonder? They had just lived through a war. They had saved each other's lives. Both of them had lived through enough danger and trauma to break any man - as
"Uhun."
They squabbled. Of course they did. But it never went past the point where one or both walked off in different directions, fuming or sulking. They didn't come to blows. They never cursed each other. Both men were acutely aware that their chances of survival doubled if they remained together. Also, Harry thought, they really had come a long way since first year. Neither of them wanted to kill the other, they trusted each other not to poison the food while the other wasn't looking, and they didn't even play any pranks. And not for lack of opportunities, but just because it didn't feel right.
Lying next to each other in blissful relaxation while their breaths slowly evened out, Hannah eventually asked for the rest of Neville's tale.
Oh, and he'd been fucked six ways from Sunday.
"Malfoy." Harry's voice was dead serious. "Tell me, and don't you lie now: Was enumerating weird facts about huge and painful animal pricks your way of flirting?"
"This
It took Harry a while to figure out his own limbs and the unaccustomed position, all the while feeling about as graceful as an overweight megatherium, but in time he began to move with more force and confidence. Draco made it easy, too. He moved into Harry's thrusts, arching his butt up to meet him, and his gasps and moans let Harry know exactly when he was doing it right.
He decided not to mention his elementary school natural science teacher, Doctor Miller, who one day ran around the school excitedly waving the latest issue of his science mag, which claimed that archaeologists had found residue of a material akin to a Teflon coating in the backs of some fossilized dinosaur's throats. This was believed to indicate that certain species had, after all, been capable of breathing fire. Four weeks later, Harry heard him dispiritedly admitting to a colleague that he'd bought that particular mag in April... and the May issue disclosed that article as an April 1
A little worried now, Malfoy cocked his head. "What exactly did you see that traumatized you so?"
"Muggles are stupid."
"Longbottom," Draco hissed, his voice terrifyingly dangerous. Harry felt parts of himself perk up in conditioned response. He forced himself to keep the threatening glower on his own face. "I will end you." Draco's voice was smooth, soft, deadly. "I will flatten your manor, I will poison every single one of your plants. I will ruin your courtship with Abbott, I will lay waste to your school grades, I will make you a pariah amongst our generation for decades to come -"
Beside him, Draco Malfoy was staring up at the large reptile with equally wide, disbelieving eyes. "That's not any dragon I've ever seen."
Harry wrapped his arms firmly around the shivering blond. "I've got you," he promised. "Draco, I've got you."
"I can… I mean, if you like… and once you get over the shock… we could maybe…" He trailed off.
"I had my camera out, ready to snap a picture of their stunned faces when I suddenly stepped out of the underbrush. But when I caught sight of them, it turned out that I could have danced the naked hula in front of them and they would not have noticed."
Malfoy knew more about magical theory than Harry did, always had and likely always would. As the other boy geared up for a theory rant worthy of Hermione on a bad day, Harry leaned back against a friendly tree and relaxed. Malfoy would figure it out.
mate? What gives? Three: Helga Hufflepuff is my
Malfoy continued. "And I like a good-looking man. Even more so now that I know he is well-equipped, to boot." Malfoy wasn't looking at Harry's crotch as he said that; instead, his eyes were fondly caressing the wand holsters strapped to both of Harry's arms.
"A... dinosaur," Malfoy said, testing the word like he had heard it before but couldn't quite place it.
He smiled ruefully. "So, I landed in the past. But, having started out in a different location than Malfoy and Harry, it stood to reason I would not arrive right next to them. Well, I didn't. Instead, I landed inside a thicket of prehistoric devil's snare, and found out it was resistant to fire."
"You -?!"
Draco gave a downright evil smirk that took Harry way back. "See that you do."
"Please, by all means," he said and gestured between his spread legs.
Looking back on their interactions over the past few days, Harry had to admit it really wasn't all that fast. Harry himself had been stealthily cuddling with Draco while the other man slept; and Draco, now that he thought about it, had been stealing touches right and left ever since they arrived in this age.
This was getting a bit much, Harry thought; but then again, if Neville had taken the pictures he thought he might have, forcing him to destroy them really was his only hope of ever sleeping soundly again.
But wait. Did that mean…
never-go-wrong potions and ancient runes prodigy Draco Malfoy, did the Ancient Amestresian equivalent of forgetting to dot his i's and cross his t's."
Draco looked up at him with a surprising hint of uncertainty beneath the habitual façade of self-confident bravado.
"Stop prevaricating."
Neville looked at him with wide-eyed innocence that was… clearly fake.
Especially when he had pushed Harry up a steep bit with both hands on his arse.
Blushing, Draco looked away and closed his eyes. They weren't really in a position to get away from each other, though, and Harry wasn't inclined to let him. Lowering himself carefully onto Draco, he put his mouth to the blond's ear and whispered: "Love you too."
Harry felt his prick pumping into Draco. Hot, tight, warm release. Overwhelmed, he lowered himself to lie down on top of Draco. No longer needing his arms to hold himself up, he buried one hand in Draco's hair, ruffling the sweaty blond locks affectionately. His other hand came to stretch out in the grass along their sides. A moment later, it was captured by one of Draco's. Their fingers linked and Draco gave Harry's hand a squeeze.
They had been burdened with responsibilities far beyond their age, buried underneath an avalanche of unreasonable expectations. And neither of them had had reliable adults in their lives that could be trusted to want nothing but their safety and happiness.
"There," Draco suddenly said, his entire body clenching up. Harry grinned. Had he found Draco's prostate? He eagerly repeated the last motion. Draco gasped and tightened, near crushing Harry's hand.
Even buried balls-deep in Draco, Harry had enough brain capacity left to find that odd. "But you've had sex…?"
liked. But that wasn't exactly what Draco had meant, was it?
He regretted that a little when the drying spunk made a squelching noise between them. Draco chuckled.
"Your mother formally accepted me into the family five months ago, Draco."
Harry froze. There was no lie in Malfoy's eyes, but then with Slytherins, one never knew. "You mean… You were dreaming about exposing me to the whole school so everyone could laugh about me?"
"Draco," Harry said. "Have I told you today that I love you?"
~ The End ~
, man. According to the more extreme believers, science is evil, evolution is a hoax and dinosaurs never existed."
Harry hugged Draco to his chest and felt a rush of fondness overtake his libido and turn everything on its head. How had they gone from sex to this level of affection so fast?
He turned to Draco, who quickly looked away when he realized he’d been staring the whole time. He grabbed a book from the stack beside the chair, but his hand paused on the cover when a voice spoke.
in his bed.
Draco rolled his eyes and gestured to his book. “Obviously not.” He was being nasty, he knew it, but something about Potter’s presence made him forget to be good.
But no one really looked up when the two boys joined the group. Harry sat at an open spot near the left end of the room, while Draco took his empty chair at the head of the table on the right. Andromeda wished him good morning and Teddy tried to feed him a half-eaten strawberry. It was all very normal, and that dread melted to excitement when he caught Harry’s eye from across the room, thrilling in their shared secret.
“Hey Wolfie,” he said fondly. He heard his mother tsk but Andromeda only chuckled. “Did Grandma tell you? We have a vistor.”
Potter’s movements stopped, his hold loosened. “Look at me,” he whispered, and Draco realized his eyes had been squeezed shut.
his whole cohort of aurors were in his house, weren’t they? This wasn’t a quick blowjob in the dorms, miles away from the Malfoys and their reputation. Draco had just shagged Harry Potter in full earshot of his entire family and the nation’s most reputable cursebreakers.
“That’s rich, coming from a Gryffindor,” Draco snorted, watching the sun slowly crawl its way over his ceiling. “No, Slytherins aren’t evil little bastards who break all the rules and—” he turned to Harry, rant all queued up, but the expression on Harry’s face stopped him. He had put his glasses back on, and his eyes were focused beneath them. They were amused, and they were fond. “I’m sorry,” Draco blurted out.
And then he realized that the sparks were not a hex, but a charm, gently streaming from a watch that did not belong to him.
He certainly was taking his time, running his middle finger around Draco’s rim. He was staring intently between Draco’s legs, enough that it couldn’t be passed off as anything other than a distinct avoidance of eye contact. But when he finally pressed in and Draco let out a sound breathier and higher than anything he’d heard come out of his mouth before, Potter looked up sharply, lips parting in absentminded wonder as he watched the expressions flick over Draco’s face.
“For Merlin’s sake, Harry! I can only imagine that bed is bigger than your whole flat, so just get in and quit whining! It’s not that big of a deal, there’s more than enough room for the both of us!”
Harry shook his head. “Right. Right.” He felt all torn-up, completely unprepared for this situation as the firewhiskey still made his brain fuzzy.
A chuckle rumbled over his neck, followed by a kiss pressed into the junction between his ear and his jaw. “What else do you want, Draco?” Harry asked.
But then whatever response he was going to sputter out was cut off with a kiss, and his brain stopped altogether.
Whatever it was, he must have noticed Draco’s sudden tension, because he leaned down to press a kiss into Draco’s shoulder blade. “Stop thinking,” he murmured.
His mother’s face lit up, and she gestured to Draco. “My son, of course, Draco,” she said by way of introduction. Half a dozen faces turned toward him, but Draco wasn’t ready to face one of them yet. He smiled tightly at his mother. “I’m afraid I have some business to go over with my sister, but Draco will make himself available should you need anything. Please don’t hesitate to ask.”
Potter’s eyes widened. For a moment Draco wasn’t sure if the outburst was too much (it was hard to gauge
His constellation had already shifted in the night sky, on the edge of his vision through the window and soon to be vanished in the inky blue completely. And once it had, Draco turned back to his bed to find Potter fast asleep on the far side.
He lay there, letting his mind slowly wander back into his body. When an awareness of the world around him lazed back into focus, Draco realized his limbs were numb and everything inside him screamed
It was far larger than any bathroom he’d used in the Slytherin tower, yet still small enough that changing felt difficult, as he was used to throwing his clothes all over his bedroom. He folded his trousers neatly instead, and moved to the sink to wash up.
Wordlessly, the two of them worked in tandem to hang the robe, Potter handing it over and Draco exchanging it for a monogrammed set of silk pajamas. He winced as he offered them, but all of his comfortable old tshirts had mysteriously vanished once he moved back into the manor. If Potter thought less of him for it, he didn’t say, as he tucked his shoes at the bottom of the armoire.
“Nice try. You put up wards against strangers,” Draco replied.
But then, abruptly, as Harry heard the sound of the door swing open, Draco stopped talking. For a moment, it was dead silent, and fear iced its way through Harry’s veins.
Harry stilled, then rolled off Draco’s back, settling into the bed beside him. Draco kept his face resolutely smushed into the pillows, refusing to look at that sharp gaze he felt piercing him.
“Har—Potter,” Draco whined, rubbing his arse along Potter’s length.
Harry looked relieved, shaking his head. “You don’t even want to know the scrutiny you’ll get dating Harry Potter.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well then tell me, Malfoy—”
“We should –” Potter stopped himself. Abruptly, he walked back to the desk, putting the photo back in a jerky movement. Just as swiftly he turned back to face Draco, and Draco recognized that steely look that preceded all of Potter’s dumbest – and bravest, he had to admit – moves. “We should do a rematch sometime. Just the two of us and a snitch.”
And then Harry Potter was inside him. The feeling was at once familiar, with Draco mentally prepared enough from his self-exploration, and so utterly foreign. Harry seemed to recognize the expression, and Draco grew panicked, thinking Harry might veer them dangerously close to kindness again.
Draco looked. And looked.
He wasn't going to argue with the truth.
Even before the war, they had spent years focused on each other. Admittedly, as adversaries, but the fact remained that their lives had very much revolved around each other. Harry
"They know of dinosaurs," Harry corrected. "But those are believed to be extinct. Otherwise, dragons only appear in fairy tales and fantastic novels."
This time that's really it, folks. I hope you enjoyed reading. Either way, let me know! : )
And so it went, one mishap after another. In his delirious state brought on by the cold, Neville failed to be as silent and inconspicuous as he would have liked and kept running into predatory dinosaurs, poisonous plants and smaller wildlife left, right and centre. He did not properly remember all of it, but he assumed he had left a wide path of destruction in his wake.
...Okay. So maaaaaybe there was some precedent here for Malfoy expressing an interest.
Harry was relieved to find Malfoy still asleep, blissfully unaware of Harry's unrequited cuddling.
Neither Harry nor Malfoy had ever heard of anyone travelling this far back in time, so there was no precedent for what magic might do if the target location in time did not have a matching geographic location.
Malfoy slowly got to his feet. "I was, actually."
"Thanks, Draco," he said earnestly. "That was…"
Wow, that felt good.
Harry beamed. "Yes, sure. Alright." The blood in his prick pulsed, reminding him of exactly where he was and what he had been doing. Tentatively, he pulled out a little and slid back in.
Harry laughed harder. "That good, is it?"
"'s all before."
Harry snorted. That had taken a fast turn from being sexy. "You're full of it, Malfoy."
"Well," he continued, lightly petting the curve of her hips, "there isn't much more to tell…"
"Spread them further," Harry directed huskily and Draco, straining for release, immediately obeyed. He slid down as far as his pinned hands would allow and spread his legs wide, feet planted against the branch and knees sticking out on either side, to grant Harry the best possible access.
"Move in with me?"
"Heh. Sure."
By the time Harry had completely exposed Draco's chest and curiously nudged one finger against Draco's right nipple, Draco was whining in obvious need and his trousers sported a noticeable tent. The tip glistened wetly in the bright afternoon sunlight falling through the dappled leaves. Entranced, Harry stretched out his other hand and lightly touched his index finger against it.
The blond's head came up and there was the smirk Harry had been expecting all along. "Excellent," was all the Slytherin said before escaping Harry's surprise-slackened grip to bend back down.
Draco frowned. "The ritual is going to work."
Harry knelt down in front of Draco and softly cupped both his cheeks again before pulling Draco into another intense kiss. They were both panting when they broke apart and Harry assumed he must look as debauched as Draco did. Then again, maybe that was a good look on Harry. The sun reflected off his glasses and Draco stared at the sparkle, transfixed, like a hapless shrimp worshipping the alluring light of an anglerfish.
"I think my flu killed the dinosaurs."
"Nothing like that, you perv. No, I mean for our herbology project, since we didn't manage to meet Helga Hufflepuff after all."
"And you don't have to," Harry said. "And maybe that's not what you meant."
The next two hours were spent looking at Neville's pictures from the past and… dealing with any issues that arose from that particular little excursion.
giving you the reins, am I not? That does not speak of exaggerated caution." Under his breath, he added: "Nor of a particularly sound mind." Harry wasn't quite sure if he'd been meant to hear that. Either way, the comment surprised a quick, startled laugh out of him.
Harry nodded back. Then he lined his prick up and slowly pushed in. Draco lifted his legs and hooked his ankles behind Harry's back, pulling Harry in tightly.
It had been fourteen days. Fourteen pretty wild days, Harry thought, where he'd seen dinosaurs having bone-achingly heavy sex, gone fishing and exploring with Draco, been chased by some fast-running kind of carnivore and, since they were both colossal idiots, ridden on one of the more peacefully grazing herbivores. In hind-sight, not their smartest move, but the thing had barely even seemed to notice them.
Wait a second.
Their first week was spent exploring and trying to stay off the radar of the carnivorous dinosaurs or potentially also currently alive mammal predators. Neither boy remembered much from their lessons on prehistoric life-forms, so they weren't really sure if woolly mammoths and sabre-toothed tigers had been around at the same time as the dinosaurs or later. But they didn't meet either and eventually put the question out of their minds.
"But as for myself… I, uh. Do. Love you. ...I hope I'm not making this awkward."
Harry blushed and looked away. Prevarication would do him little good, here. He had already given too much away. "Yah, not so much," he agreed.
"So what is a 'Creationist'?" Malfoy asked.
"You have no idea," Draco sighed happily. His eyes closed for a moment. Unwilling to disturb him, Harry froze, one hand still on Draco's softening prick, the other inside his now less tightly clenched arse.
"Oh."
Draco tensed. "I didn't say -"
Chuckling, Harry finally moved both hands between Draco's legs. One of them lightly grasped the blond's erection. It felt good in his hand, a solid, smooth warmth. Harry allowed his left hand little movements up and down the shaft, the gesture stoking both Draco's pleasure and his own. His right hand, meanwhile, slid further down until it arrived behind Draco's ball sack.
