“Draco Malfoy, of course! Apparently he and Harry have been getting along quite fine as of late,” Seamus explained as if it were common knowledge, “Although I’m not sure what you said to him, mate. Blaise said he was almost livid with you the last time he talked to Malfoy.”
“Then don’t,” Harry snapped, “And if most of my decisions aren’t made for me, it’s because I have three fucking kids to take care of. That comes before anything.”
Harry looked down at his daughter as she turned in Angelina’s grasp to get a good look at her older brother. “I want to play, not spin!” she retorted, eyes narrowed. She was a little Ginny through and through, from her bright red hair to her refusal to put up with anything her brothers threw at her (literally or figuratively).
“Just one problem,” Harry brought up, “How do we ensure that we can overhear Ida talking about her next move? After all that has happened, it would look too suspicious if Ida left the Ministry for anything other than an Auror dictated investigation.”
“Think about it,” Draco said, turning to face the two of them, “What is a group of purebloods greatest weakness? The fact that they constantly underestimate muggle inventions and ideas. People like this believe that muggles are so far beneath them that anything they think up is useless and pales in comparison to what magic can do. What we need is a way to hear what Ida is saying when she is with her fellow Kareach members, and I think I know how to do just that.”
Harry smiled, but his smile began to falter as he studied Draco’s face. Up close, Draco looked even more exhausted than before.
Seamus must have sensed his uneasiness, “Sorry, Harry. This is just so much to take in.”
“Listen, Padma,” Harry said, “Draco, Aviary and I came up with a plan to find out what Ida and Aries’s next plan is.”
“Seamus!” Harry responded, “It’s not like that! Ginny and I decided to get a divorce a couple weeks ago. And, not that it matters, but she cheated on me.”
“Oh, you all,” she shook her head, refusing to let herself cry, “Gan, Hector will be fine. I know it.”
“And you’ll do that to Al if he doesn’t shut it?” she asked, “Cool!”
Padma shook her head, “Not exactly. But Ron, Ida, Aviary and I have been in charge of sending Aurors to patrol muggle communities where we believe strikes are most likely to happen. So far, we seemed to have stopped attacks for the time being. We haven’t seen any usual activity in awhile.”
“Yeah, Ginny,” Harry asked pointedly, “Why don’t we tell everyone why?”
Draco pursed his lips together, “Okay, then. Tell me why you are here tonight. Tell me why you are so hesitant to say something that’s clearly important, as you showed up at my house at four in the morning.”
Harry shrugged. The last time they had all gotten together, Padma and Pansy had gotten into a fight over whether or not the next Minister of Magic should be Caroline Platt, a high ranking official in the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes. The fight had ended in Padma tossing a scone at Pansy and storming out in the room. The way Pansy was gazing into Padma’s eyes, however, suggested that none of this had ever happened.
Draco took a step back, “I am here to do nothing of the sort,” he moved to swipe the curtains shut as Walburga began to protest.
“The interview went well,” Harry said, smiling at Molly, “I am fine, really.”
“All of our friends and family are fine!” Ron quickly reassured, “All the kids are safely at my mum and dad’s.”
Harry shrugged, “I can resist the urge to hex you more than once a day if you can.”
“So, the injury,” Blaise began as he gained his composure, “Reyes and I were on the same bloody team. I was a chaser and he was a beater. I quickly became fed up with him not protecting Ginny from the bludgers and I told him so. He was frustrated with me and decided to take out his frustration by nailing me directly in the arm with a bludger.”
“Are Padma and Savant alright?” Harry asked.
“Well, that’s pleasant,” Ginny scoffed, “I didn’t know it was that bad to talk to me.”
“The kiss you’ve been waiting for?” Draco asked, his hand now frozen on the doorknob.
“Great, Luna,” Harry smiled at his friend, a little put off by how many people were asking that very question today.
Ginny took a deep breath and seemed to settle herself. She then looked directly at Harry and said, “I’m not happy, Harry. And I have a feeling you aren’t, either.”
“Of course,” Seb answered, “Anything for a friend.”
“She will be fine, thankfully,” Harry said, trying desperately to sound reassuring, “But she is extremely knackered. She must have gone to a pub after the news about Remmins began too much and drank until herself away. I don’t even know how she managed to get to my house.”
Harry opened his mouth but Ginny held up her hand, “I need to talk. I don’t want Christmas Eve to become a battle of words and accusations. What I did, Harry, was wrong. Extremely wrong. I should have never cheated, regardless of the state of our relationship and feelings for each other. I do think you have a ton of explaining to do and that you are not clear of blame, but I do completely apologize for what I did. I want you to know that I’m terrified. But I know we can still figure this out together. Maybe this is all a bit much to say now, but I know we can figure out a way to live separately peacefully and without relationships with our kids falling apart. You mean so much to me, Harry, and you always will. As for you being queer… “ she paused.
“Then let’s move,” Aviary said urgently, gesturing towards the phone booth.
When Ron pulled back from Hermione, Harry moved further into the room so that Hermione could see him. She smiled widely when she spotted him. Harry began to make his way towards the bed to embrace her as Ron had, when Ron let out a wail. He stopped and turned to look at his friend and then fell to his knees with his face in his hands. Ron had never been much of a crier, due to years of fearing torment from his older brothers, so this loud and obvious show of emotion cast an immediate tension over the room.
“I am not!” Roxanne cried, turning to her brother, “You’re just jealous I’ve gotten all the Sorry cards so far in the game!”
“You didn’t,” Seamus spoke, his voice wavering, “We can still adopt, you know. We just always wanted to have a kid that shared one of our genes.”
At some point, Padma would be a good person to entrust with the information of Kareach. Once they had solid proof, of course. He knew her; she would never stop fighting until she avenged her cousin’s death. That might make her more open to exploring the possibility of Kareach.
Harry reached out and placed his hand on Draco’s shoulder before his brain could tell him this was a bad idea, “Draco, it wasn’t about that. Ron and Padma trust you.”
Harry’s heart dropped. He wasn’t ready for this, not now, not ever.
“Zabini’s great!” Seamus said enthusiastically, “He’s a fantastic department head! And he really is nothing like what he seemed at Hogwarts. He’s funny, hardworking and well, bloody brilliant.” Seamus paused, then looked around the room to make sure he had everyone’s attention. Dean rolled his eyes and said with exasperation,
Draco looked at him, “What the fuck did you do, Potter?” His voice was low, dark.
The door flung open to reveal Healer Patrick, a sharp looking witch wearing maroon Healer’s robes. Her dark hair was pulled back in a bun reminiscent of Minerva McGonagalls; not a single hair out of place. She had a pointed face that reminded him of Malfoy’s. At the sight of Harry, she pointed her wand backwards towards a large pile of papers and sent them flying towards Harry’s arms without looking. Harry thankfully had enough sense to place his arms out in front of him in order to catch them before they pelted him in his stomach.
Hermione snorted while Harry said, “That sounds about right.”
“Thank you, Ron,” Harry said, gripping onto Ron’s arm.
Draco laughed as he began to twirl Lily, “Padma was right. The heart of life is fucking good.”
Almost immediately, Harry came into contact with a masked figure after leaving his spot on the ground. The two battled; the figure didn’t seem like they were aiming to kill, just to stop Harry from going near Draco. He eventually ended him with a strong Petrificus Totalus and wove his way around chairs, still struggling to see despite all the light from wands. Then he saw Draco, illuminated by the wand light of his duel with another masked figure. As if in slow motion, Harry spotted another figure behind Draco, wand pointed directly at his back…
“Yes. They managed to leave the room before she could hurt them. By them leaving, however, it dramatically weakened the charms when they tried to reinstate them. She’s now trying to get out of the room, and by the sound of it, she’ll be out any minute. And once she does…” Ron trailed off.
I’d like to admit finding a good mate lately and you were kind to me all week while you were working with Patrick,” Seb looked at him expectantly.
“Yeah mate,” Seamus said as he said down next to Dean and put an arm around him, “Are you alright? What’s been going on?”
Harry and Ginny said their goodbyes to the room full of kids and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley (who was looking as if she was not soon going to forget Arthur’s fib) and hurried out the door towards where George, Angelina, Bill and Fleur were standing.
“It sounds as if a service for her is being held this Friday,” Darius said, “I hope you will all be there.”
“About?” Harry asked stiffly.
He sat up abruptly, leaving Draco to drop his book in shock.
“Healer Brayan?” Harry asked. He noticed Ron shifting awkwardly in the chair besides him. There was no doubt in Harry’s mind that Ron felt immense guilt for allowing Brayan to be falsely accused.
What’s going on?” Parvati stood in the doorway with Ida and Seamus, who were all looking alarmed.
As he checked in on Daisy and made small talk with her, he couldn’t help but remember how easy it was to talk to Seb. Easier than anyone he had talked to in a long time. His friends and family seemed to make everything more complicated for him, while Seb just listened and supported him kindly. Draco would never do that.
This forced the rest of the table to look towards the dance floor.
“I do like a bloke with a strong sense of muggle fashion,” Aviary approved.
That, Harry thought, and doing anything to help Draco solve his investigation.
“No sweetie, of course not,” Ginny lied, “Daddy fell, like we talked about.”
Harry nodded, “Yes. And we need you to believe that what is going on is more than just Ida, Aviary.”
Arthur’s eyes lit up immediately. He had his own phone now, as he had been so desperately fascinated by them, but he still got beyond excited when Harry used his.
“Yes, we do,” he agreed, “And now we know that Kareach is trying to conceal their group and that it’s effective. We need to prove the attacks involved more than one person.”
He looked into Harry’s eyes. Harry nodded, any anger at Malfoy alleviating as purpose began surging through his veins.
With that, he apparated into the living room of Draco Malfoy’s apartment.
Harry turned around to see Draco walking quickly towards him, any concern gone from his face as he reached to grab the mug from his hands.
Harry shook his head, “Something different, something new. Certainly you know what I am talking about?”
“Harry?” Ron asked, “How were you hit by a spell?”
“Of course I’m here to talk about that!” Harry nearly shouted. He steadied himself and looked at Draco. He opened his mouth to continue, but found he didn’t really know how to talk about it.
“Only because I care about Ginny and don’t want her to get hurt!” Seamus said. He hesitated, then scrunched up his brow in thought, “But I guess you’re kinda right? You and Draco together doesn’t surprise me all that much.”
“Yes. He wouldn’t leave until he knew you were alright,” James added, “Just do us a favor and wait until we are out of the room to snog him, alright?”
“Draco, I am so, so, sorry.”
Harry rolled his eyes, “No, I was planning on talking to you about how hard it was to realize I was straight.”
“Draco,” Harry said, reaching across the couch to envelope him in a hug. Draco was tense and clearly reluctant at first, but he soon gave in and let Harry hug him. Harry could feel him softly crying into Harry’s shoulder, and Harry let him. Harry caught a smell of Draco’s scent, a strong vanilla he now associated with the man, and he quickly pulled back, heart suddenly racing. Harry spiked his hair up with his fingers in a way that mirrored Draco and decided to look anywhere but the man in front of him. All he wanted to do now was apparate home and draw a bath and forget about liking Draco’s smell (it couldn’t mean anything, now could it?). But he couldn’t. He had something to say.
To his surprise, Aviary moved across the floor to where Harry was sitting with Ron’s hand still on his arm, and wrapped her arms around the both of them. She wasn’t crying, but she was gripping on to the both of them tightly as she breathed heavily into Harry’s shoulder.
Harry shook his head, “No. That was Dumbledore. When he died, all the people he had told became secret keepers.”
“Right, and get the Head of International Magical Cooperation involved,” Draco snorted, “That would go smoothly.”
“We do think that…” Ida paused and looked at Padma and Aviary to see if they would say anything against her telling Harry any more information. Neither said anything, so Ida plowed on, “We think that the attacks are a solo operation.”
“Draco,” Harry whispered to him, “Remmins was Aviary’s boyfriend.”
“This is actually what Oliver has been waiting for. The weather has been so nice lately he feels we haven’t had substantial storm practice,” she reached for Lily as the three-year-old clambered into her lap, “And unfortunately, he isn’t wrong. Do you remember that one quidditch game we had third year where it downpoured the entire time? Well, of course you do,” she said, looking slightly embarrassing, no doubt thinking of the dementors that brought the match to a screeching halt, “But anyway, we somehow had a match with weather worse than that last year. Oliver wants to make Puddlemere as weather friendly as possible to avoid another mishap.”
Draco let out a small snort, “I didn’t really need the rundown of their whole professional relationship, but I’m sold. We can tell Padma and Ron.”
Ron sobbed harder at this. Harry gripped his friend’s arm and tried to get Ron to look him in the eye.
Draco nodded. He looked reluctant yet determined, so Harry chose to trust that he would do as Harry had said. Harry reversed the shield and handed Draco’s wand back to him. A moment later, Hannah appeared with a young blonde woman in her arms. The woman was turning a bright orange and shaking uncontrollably. Draco immediately took her from Hannah, instructing Harry what to do as he lay her on the ground and began his round of spells. When the woman stopped shaking, Harry took this as his chance. He used a sonorus spell to magnify his voice, hoping he had properly learned to create one that reached all throughout the hospital.
Harry shook his head, “No. I stopped there because… Draco and I kissed and then he acted like it was a mistake and I wanted to tell him I had feelings for him. And then he rejected me again and now I feel bad that I was there at all and I also feel bad that my main priority isn’t the attacks or seeing my family but I still want him, which is the worst part.”
“An article!” Harry blurted. Draco and Blaise shot him an alarmed look, “I mean, an article’s great! Show Reyes as a clear prat and bad quidditch player.”
“Aviary…” Draco began.
He gave her a gentle pat on the shoulder. Through the years, from the war to his job as an Auror, he had comforted more than enough grieving significant others, parents, brothers, sisters, friends and any loved ones to last a lifetime. By now, he should be better at it. But as he felt Aviary begin to softly cry into his shoulder, he lost all control of himself. He cried with her, feeling her pain, her shock, her exhaustion with everything. It never does get easier.
Draco looked back at Harry, “He’s infected, Harry. He can’t reproduce.”
“Yes, thank you, Harry,” Ida said. She stood up to move closer to the fire, “Let her know as soon as she wakes up how sorry I am. I haven’t gotten a proper chance to comfort her, not with everything that’s been going on. I need her to know I’m thinking about her and sending her love. I know how much Gani meant to her.”
“What?” Harry asked.
“Although,” he finished, “I bloody hate Aries Reyes.”
“I knew it was you,” Draco barely mumbled. The statement made little sense in context of their lives now, but Harry in his gut knew Draco was talking about the day at Malfoy Manor when Draco had been “unable” to identify Harry.
“This can’t be a good sign, right?” Draco said, “Surely Padma would know something by now?”
Or so he thought.
“Yes. Sirius was the rightful owner and he left the house to me when he passed,” Harry said simply.
“Where the fuck were you?” Ginny whispered harshly, no doubt trying to avoid waking their kids, “You threw a tantrum and then seemingly disappeared from the face of the Earth! No calls, no explanations, no anything!” Ginny began to pace the room, her face twisted with rage, “I’m your wife! You can’t just decide your mad over... well, I don’t even know what! Some secret society the best Aurors don’t believe is real? What is going on with you!?”
Harry just stared at Malfoy’s head, as he had once again bent over his binder as if Harry had never shown up. So not only did Malfoy know who the Spice Girls were, he listened to them. Draco bloody Malfoy listened to the Spice Girls.
“It’s too late,” Seb said dramatically, “The moment has passed.”
“I’ll tell her and everybody else that you are awake and well and that you will not be leaving your hospital room, but anybody who wants to visit can later,” Ginny gave him a stern look and led Al, James and Lily out of the room. James gave Draco a thumbs up as he passed him in the doorway.
She stared at the wall, perfectly silent. Harry stood watching them in the tense silence. For the first time during one of their battle scene aftermaths, he felt out of place, like he was intruding. But he knew leaving the room wasn’t an option. He just wished there was any way, any possible way, to make this situation better.
Harry pushed open the door and began to say hello to Blaise, whose whole arm was in a cast, when he spotted Draco sitting at the side of Blaise’s bed. An angry feeling began to coarse through his body, one he couldn’t identify. Draco had looked as if he had been in the room for a long while; his coat, shoes and scarf were left in various places, and he had a stack of books next to himself. How good of friends were they? Why was this upsetting to Harry?
“It is, isn’t it?” Harry said, leaning over and kissing Draco.
“Oh, okay,” Savant looked away from the notes and yelled in the booming voice Harry had been expecting, “Dover! I know you aren’t asleep! Come to my office!”
Draco said nothing for a second, then began to straighten back up the room with his wand and move towards the door. An apology was on the tip of Harry’s tongue for the way he had been acting lately, but then a more urgent thought popped into his head.
“Hopefully the Prophet will let me trash Reyes,” Draco said tartly, “The last time I had an article about him they refused to publish it because he donates so much to the Games and Sports Department.”
“Harry…” she said, “I’m so happy you’ve told me. Regardless of whether or not you’re married to a woman, it’s important that you don’t hide this.”
“Potter…” Malfoy said hesitantly, noticing Harry’s fuming silence.
Harry turned to look at her shining eyes, “I’m happy you’ve become to figure out your full self,” Ginny spoke softly but strongly, “I’m honestly shocked. I can’t say I had any idea. But I do know that I support anything that will make you happy.”
“She can contact Kareach,” Draco finished.
“Good morning!” James said brightly, walking over to Harry and sitting on the edge of the bed near his feet.
“We are doing something, Potter! We have to figure it out ourselves, prove that we are right. As of involving the Aurors with our evidence, they will only continue to claim it's all circumstantial and not take it seriously. And they wouldn’t be wrong,” Malfoy picked at the corner of a menu as he continued, “We have no solid proof. But we know. Right?”
Rachel gave them one last look, then walked into the fire. Harry turned to Draco:
Harry stared at Draco. He couldn’t believe he would be so harsh. He had thought Draco understood him better than that.
Harry and Draco moved towards the lift. They waited in tense silence for the lift to reach the first floor.
“Sorry about that,” Malfoy said, placing a hand on his son’s shoulders, “You been bothering my son, Potter?”
“Hey, don’t doubt the power of a good drink at the Leaky Cauldron,” Seb said.
“What do you think he was doing?” Harry asked, slightly upset that Malfoy did not ask him to help when he was right outside of the place Harry worked.
Harry stared at Draco then, trying to read in his pale blue eyes if this was true, “Why?” he asked softly, not knowing what else to say.
Harry began to cry without meaning to, tears pouring down his face as he turned away from Draco’s intense stare. He couldn’t tell him what he had done, he just couldn’t.
“He had probably helped with the attacks, that’s why he was so friendly,” Ron countered, “We do have actual proof he had a hatred for muggle-borns.”
“And all this time I thought it was a joke!” Harry teased, getting off the bench in order to bend down and greet the ferret. To his delight, Murr nuzzled into his touch.
“No, come on in!” Harry smiled. He watched as the kids filed in and gave hugs to their grandma and said hello to Draco. As Lily climbed onto his bed and curled up in a ball beside him, Harry finally began to understand how great life could be.
“You and Neville need to get hitched,” Seamus joked.
“So?” Malfoy was giving Harry a rather concerned look, “Are you still drunk?”
“All he would want,” Harry said gently, “Is for you to be safe.”
Despite how upset Harry was, he couldn’t help feel a surge of pride for Draco. They had been on to Kareach in more ways that Ida was aware.
Confused, Harry moved to set down beside him, “Draco?”
Harry made his way across the canteen to Malfoy. He arrived at his side, fully expecting Malfoy to turn and acknowledge him. Harry hated to admit it, but Malfoy’s muggle style really fit him. He was wearing a long grey coat that was well suited to his smart black shoes and pants. Putting these observations out of his head, Harry cleared his throat in order to get Malfoy’s attention.
“I’m impressed,” Harry admitted.
“What did you realize?” Draco asked.
So, he had ended up at a place he knew he’d feel safe: Seb’s apartment. The two hadn’t seen much of each other lately, what with two attacks and Christmas, but Seb took him in with open arms when Harry sent an owl.
“Oh, Ida,” Harry said, “You know I will.”
“That’s not true!” Hermione exclaimed, “Barty Crouch Sr. knew more! He’s making me look bad as one of my predecessors!”
Ginny sent a look reminiscent of her mothers at George and snapped, “I’ll bloody kiss Harry when I please.”
“Yes. I even told Ron that, but he seemed to think assembling a makeshift Order of the Phoenix was not what we needed at the moment. He told me to stick to the plan and not put anymore people into danger,” Draco said sullenly.
Ron looked up and smiled, “Harry! I had thought you would’ve left by now!”
“You weren’t foolish!” Harry insisted, “You would have been foolish to ignore it.”
Harry’s heart gave a highly unwanted pang at this statement. Choosing to ignore his feelings, Harry addressed Draco, “I’m sorry I’ve been the most difficult prat to work with. I get mad and sad and I take it out on you. That’s not okay.”
Harry nodded silently; this did all make perfect sense. It was just terrifying to think that so many of his friends and family, many of which were muggleborn, could be going to work with someone who wanted to stunt their reproductive system with the goal of ending their ancestry.
“It’s never too soon,” George stated.
Need him? Harry’s mind supplied unhelpfully. Were the rumors Seamus heard true? Were Draco and Blaise a couple? They were both queer, it was a possibility.
“I’m not just any reporter,” Malfoy said, dipping his quill in more ink, “All I need is an answer to my question.”
“Ready, you two?” George said, arm around his wife, “Or should we wait another ten minutes while you go and snog behind the broom shed?”
“Where’s Draco?” he demanded abruptly, grabbing on to the front of Ron’s robes, “Is he alive?”
Harry didn’t answer. He looked left and right. A muggle woman was walking towards them from the right, a small corgi trotting in front of her on a leash. Harry gestured to Aviary and Draco to be quiet. Aviary and Draco seemed to understand, as they walked silently with Harry towards a park bench. The woman gave them an odd look as she passed, her face half lit up by the light of the streetlamps. Harry supposed they did look odd, as Harry was dressed in an old t-shirt and pajama bottoms while Aviary was still wearing her Auror robes. They waited patiently until the woman disappeared around a turn after the last house on the block before Harry began to whisper furiously to Aviary and Draco:
Harry nodded, “You’re right,” he whispered, “I should have told them right away. I just couldn’t imagine getting that kind of news before I had any kids of my own. It’s heartbreaking.”
“Harry, my boy,” he said. Although he tried to speak with his usual confidence, Harry could hear in his voice the stress and harsh revelations he had endured in the past forty eight hours.
Harry blushed slightly as Draco rolled his eyes. The truth was, Draco had proposed a little over a week ago. The two hadn’t told anyone yet as to not draw focus from Lavendar and Parvati’s day.
Freezing, Harry let loose a string of curses in his head as he turned to face Ginny. He knew full well he did not look like he had been at the hospital working for the past several hours. He was still in the t-shirt and worn out jeans he had been wearing before he left the house and he reeked of a smell that completely suggested he had been at a bar. He slowly turned to look at his wife, guilt building up like a brick lodged in his chest.
“That sounds great, Harry,” Ida said, and to his relief she didn’t seem disappointed to have her pub idea derailed.
“What do you mean? To fight! To help revive victims!” Draco said, his tone condescending, “Hardly any of the victims would have survived last time if it wasn’t for Harry and I.”
Harry nodded and looked down at his hands. Today couldn’t get any fucking stranger.
Harry raised his eyes as if to say I told you so.
“Trust me, this place is safe…” Harry began to explain, but he was cut off as Draco realized something.
The three of them look up from their hug and at Ginny, “What?” Harry asked.
When he rounded the corner to Savant’s office, he came face to face with his ex-partner Ida Reyes, a striking woman Harry had grown close to over the past couple years. Ida had glossy black hair that she always made into some type of complicated braid; today it was wrapped around her head in such a way that she looked as if she was wearing a crown. To top it off, she had woven in golden flecks that contrasted her hair impressively. She was wearing gold robes to match, a statement Harry instantly admired. Ida was bold and unapologetic, which had proven to be the perfect offset to his more reserved side. Despite how well they worked together, Ida had been the one who told him she thought he would make a great healer. Ida was a firm believer in following your heart and not doing what was expected of you. As the daughter of a pureblood family who held high expectations for their daughter’s life in England that she continuously defied, she reminded Harry of Sirius. That is probably what drew him to Ida in the first place, and the connection they quickly formed led Savant to make them partners.
“What will it take?” Draco whispered through his hands, “For people to realize I’m trustworthy?”
“It can’t be,” Ron said, his voice hollow, “Kareach existed without our knowing for what could have been centuries. Who’s to say what else is out there, just waiting to try and take over the Ministry? Just ask Hermione, she heard about stuff like this everyday, all around the world.”
“Well, you have no choice,” Draco said evenly, “I know it’s awful, but this is the plan.”
“If I can be in the same room as you firecall the Ministry, then you can,” Aviary told him.
“Ron…” Harry began, but a flash of green halted his words.
“Ginny, he had solid…” Aviary tried to put in.
“Wait…” Draco’s eyes lit up, “That’s it!”
“As was I, Potter,” Auror Savant patted Harry on the shoulder as he talked, “That was true bravery you showed today. It makes me wonder why you ever left us.”
“Can we even work together, civilly?” Malfoy asked, “I mean, we have an extensive history of mistrust.”
“What? I’ve gone my whole life feeling excluded when you two talked about relationship things. Harry’s in my territory now,” Hermione countered.
“Let’s talk about something else,” Harry suggested.
Draco’s face broke into a reluctant smile at this, “You are the biggest idiot I have ever met.”
The inside of Seb’s apartment was, well, exactly how one would picture it to be. The colors were bright and brought a cheerfulness that Harry needed. It was almost able to distract Harry from the gnawing anger and sadness inside him. He felt terrible about Blaise, and how upset it had made Ginny, but he also felt angry at her for kicking him out and taking him away from his kids. Harry knew she wouldn’t keep him away from them for long, and he knew it was much too soon to demand to see them, but he felt terrible thinking about what they must be thinking. They were already so upset about the divorce; how would they react when their dad didn’t come home tonight? Ginny had also left him with little options, as now his whole family and friends had heard about the fight he and Ginny had held in front of many witnesses at the hospital. The Prophet had covered it mere hours later. Even though it wouldn’t be out until tomorrow’s issue, everyone already knew that Harry and Ginny Potter- Weasley were getting a divorce. And that Harry was potentially gay. And that he was friends with Draco Malfoy.
Dean’s flailing was subsiding as Harry muttered spell after spell. He kept his hand steady and his mind focused. Despite his efforts, he could feel Dean suddenly getting worse. Dean’s whole body began to shake violently. Harry began to shout out for help, hoping for a more experienced Healer to swoop in and take over.
“I lied earlier when I told the Aurors I didn’t know who killed Gani,” Aviary’s voice cracked at the mention of Gani’s name, but she recovered quickly to a face of firm determination. A feeling of dread creeped through Harry as he waited to hear who Aviary would say.
Harry nodded and stopped talking as he saw Savant round the corner.
“Harry, we are so relieved it was only a stunning spell,” Aviary addressed him first. Although the two didn’t know each other well, Harry could tell she had been as worried as the rest of them by the clear relief in her face, “It’s a miracle, frankly. The attackers were aiming to kill.”
Harry moved towards the bed to tell Hermione goodbye, when Healer Patrick handed him Hermione’s chart.
Savant treating him like he was rejoining the Auror team made Harry realize something. He wasn’t doing this because he wanted to be an Auror. He was doing this because of Draco. Because Draco asked and he couldn’t resist any chance to make a difference, to help using his own insight at the hospital. But here he was, acting as if he was Ida’s partner again, when his own partner was home asleep, none the wiser to the plans they were making behind his back.
Her voice cracked as she fell onto the couch.
Draco snorted and began to move hesitantly towards him. He stopped about a foot away, and Harry couldn’t breathe. His whole body feels like it’s made of sand. Was Draco going to kiss him? But before he can internally panic about this thought, Draco wrapped him in a hug.
Aviary nodded, “I’ll go and find him.”
“You have no right to know anything right now,” Ginny snapped, “Not after your little outburst. Harry and I are no longer together romantically, it is our choice as to who we begin a relationship with.”
“I’ll explain,” Draco cut in before Harry could speak, “I’ve been working on an investigative paper for the prophet on the organization Kareach. I have believed for years that Kareach is a real threat to the wizarding world. I ended up talking Harry about it after the Prophet told me not to research the topic any longer, and we decided to work on it together.”
“Perhaps, Harry,” Ginny said, “Whatever happened, he was conscious enough to reverse Ida’s curse without us noticing. We were all so focused on you and Draco that we weren’t paying attention to Ida and Aries.”
“I think we have more of a grip on this parenting thing than that,” Draco said.
Albus and James did not attempt to run towards him. They sat in silence.
“Sorry I’m late!” Angelina's words rang out from the other room, tearing Harry’s eyes away from the confusing Twister game unfolding in his living room.
Harry sat up quickly, his heart racing. He couldn’t believe he was having these thoughts. Draco trusted Blaise. Ginny trusted Blaise. There was no reason he shouldn’t.
“You wish,” Seamus said slyly, his laughter bubbling as he dodged a stinging hex from his husband.
Harry rushed out into the front yard, relieved to see most of the kids had congregated to the back of the house. He quickly clicked the answer bottom.
“To Draco’s apartment,” Harry finished, looking away as the words left his mouth.
Aviary collapsed on the floor as the words left her. She buried her head in her hands as sobs rolled through her body.
Harry looked back towards the door where Draco was standing, “Draco confirmed it! And he studied Chann in Cambodia.” Harry stood up and moved away to allow Ron to hug his wife, both crying uncontrollable tears of joy. Harry watched them for the moment: the relieved Ron and Hermione and the confused but crying Rose until he turned back to the door. Draco was still standing there, one hand on the doorframe as he watched Ron and Hermione. When he saw Harry was looking at him, however, he looked quickly away and slipped out the door without another word.
“Yes,” Seamus whispered back, “Because you and Ginny are the strongest people I know.”
“Yes,” she mumbled, “Damn, it’s weird confiding in you with this.”
“How could she?!” Ron shouted, “She was my colleague! I’ve trusted her with so much! And she repays me by putting my wife in danger? I can’t…” he stopped and angrily kicked another chair.
Harry plastered a smile and said, “Everything looks fine, Mr. Reyes. I hope to see you at the quidditch match after party. I’m sure Ginny will appreciate you coming to congratulate her after the Cannon’s win. The press eats that stuff up.”
“You know, it’s funny,” Harry said after he and Malfoy finished laughing over the time Molly dragged Arthur to an album signing after finding him hiding in the broom shed, “I bet if you got Molly and your mother together, they could talk about Celestina for hours.”
Ginny was looking at him strangely but Harry didn’t care. There was just no way that bit of information was anything but a rumor. Harry knew Malfoy well enough to know he wasn’t gay. He was a happily married man in a heterosexual relationship. Shagging Blaise Zabini was off the table.
“Come in!” he called, sitting up in bed.
“Harry,” Ginny grabbed his chin and pointed it up towards her, “Long story short, Blaise has given me an outlet to talk and address things about myself that I didn’t know I needed. Just don’t be afraid of real help. We both are still learning how to do that.”
“Nott was never a death eater!” Ron argued.
“Weasley clan and company,” Healer Patrick commands the room with her voice, “I know you all want to give Hermione your love, but she is not fit to have this many visitors at this time. I thought Dean told you?”
“No, you are all delights,” Angelina assured, as Rose and Albus walked into the room.
“You can snog Mr. Malfoy, daddy, we don’t mind,” Lily said seriously.
“Don’t worry,” Hermione reassured, “The poison can’t affect a pregnancy that is already underway. There should be no complications from the poison if I stay careful for the next couple of months.”
“But you quit your job as an Auror,” Aviary remarked.
“No, not exactly. She was on the phone for a while with someone she said is a “bloody wanker”, which I can only assume is that coach of Angelina’s team,” James replied.
“From what I know of Aurors, they don’t take advice from non-Aurors well,” Malfoy said, “They don’t value evidence from outside their own sources.”
“It’s not a problem, Hermione,” Ida said. She was sitting on the other side of Luna and had been answering countless questions Luna had about her hair, “Janika Aquino is a godsend to the Philippines, so it’s my pleasure to help you talk to her.”
Harry looked at the scoreboard. Fifty to Seventy, with Puddlemere leading. Angelina was soaring through the air, a fist of triumph raised. She must have scored again.
Harry would have laughed if the situation they were in wasn’t so tragic. He grabbed Aviary’s hand and walked towards the first set of stairs outside of the entrance hall. Draco trailed as Harry led them to the very first room he had visited the first time he came to Grimmauld Place years ago. It was the room he and Ron slept in when he stayed here the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts.
“Who could have done this?” Harry asked.
“Of course it is,” Draco huffed, “I came up with it.”
“Hiya indeed,” Harry smiled at the bright eyed child, who was dressed for the occasion in a blue summer dress, “Where are your parents, sweet girl?”
“The baby’s fine!” he yelled joyously, “Chann doesn’t affect babies that already exist!”
“This morning, Healer Darius Brayan confessed to the Imperius attacks,” Ida cut straight to the point.
“What!?” Ron shouted, “How is that possible? You two have been together since you were at Hogwarts!”
Ida huffed, “Of course I do! I assumed you and Ginny were getting a divorce. Am I wrong?”
“Did you know your father was a pureblood?” Ron asked, “And I’m not trying to accuse you of anything. I’m just wondering.”
“You must have been a bloody terrific student,” Harry commented, “My guess is Madam Pomfrey takes nothing but the best.”
“You too, Harry,” Hermione hesitated, then asked, “Is it completely irresponsible for me to not be at work right now?”
“None of this matters,” Ida put in, “We have solid reasons to believe that Blaise could be responsible for these attacks. He’s a pureblood, raised in a household that took blood purity extremely seriously. Trust me, as a pureblood from one of the oldest wizarding families, I know which families to watch out for. Aside from the Blacks and the Malfoys, the Zabinis have historically been the most influential wizarding family. Blaise has been raised with bigoted ideals, and while that doesn’t prove he committed anything, these pieces of evidence do. We need to bring him in.”
“Hermione…” Ron hesitated, then seemed to make a decision, “No. You need your rest. You’ve been through enough today.”
“That he loved you?” Harry guessed sheepishly.
“Draco discovered what the poison is and what it does,” Harry told her, in what he hoped was a calming tone.
“Hello,” she smiled at the group after giving Harry a hug, “Beautiful day for a wedding, eh?”
“He has been working on investigating Kareach,” Harry explained, banking on Hermione knowing about the rumors.
“She’s going to plant to bug,” Harry said, “And Ida is in her office right now, so she should easily have her chance.”
But Harry was barely registering Ron. He pulled himself to his feet with some difficulty and then made his way as quickly as he could across the room to Draco’s side. Seamus moved aside to let Harry kneel beside Draco, who was shaking violently from the pain.
Harry watched him go, then walked back to the table feeling strangely unsettled.
“No, not at all,” Malfoy shook his head and waved a bartender over to order a glass of Superior Red wine. Harry desperately tried to work out what was going on in his head as he waited for Malfoy to continue.
“I just spent two hours pretending I knew nothing about what she did,” Aviary said, her voice hollow, “I think you can manage.”
Malfoy shrugged, “It’s the job, and he’s your boss,” he chided, “There’s no need to make it personal.”
“Emergency? Did I say that?” Malfoy responded.
The man looked alarmed but held his ground, “Room 316. She…”
Savant beamed, “Let’s get to it then!”
“Padma?” Ida’s voice floated in from the hall.
As Ginny settled in an armchair to talk, Harry made his way to the kitchen to help with lunch, yelling for James to do the same. All adults and kids took turns helping Molly with dinner. This week he, James, Roxanne, Bill, Fleur and Bill and Fleur’s son, Louis, were on the list. Fleur was talking to the group as Harry entered,
Harry made his way back to the sitting room, where all of the guests had congregated. He sat down next to Louis and Ida and began a conversation about his favorite spells . Thankfully, no one seemed to be interested in asking Harry, Ron or Padma about Harry’s outburst earlier, allowing Harry to slip into the conversation. Harry was just explaining why he liked Expelliarmus best with an unwavering passion when Seamus stood up and began tapping a spoon against his wine glass to get the room’s attention.
“I have something to say and I need to say it quickly,” Aviary said firmly.
“You know I’m not upset you slept with him!” Harry shouted.
Despite herself, Aviary giggled, “As long as we’re together, I don’t see what the problem is. I am never going to stop loving you, Seb Haffer.”
Angelina rolled her eyes. “I’ll tell Ron to bugger off. Ginny is the best coach the UK leagues have seen in a long time.”
Aviary shoved him, “Don’t flatter yourself, you prat.”
Guilt bubbled up in Harry’s throat, “Yes,” he lied, “I’ll take the kids to Grandma Molly’s.”
With those words, Harry realized Draco had no idea that what Aviary was most upset about wasn’t Ida, but the loss of Gani.
“Eww, dad!” Lily said, appearing behind them.
“It’s true,” Padma confirmed, “I already choose the tall, dark and handsome bloke in the corner,” she gestured towards the right of the bar. Harry gave a start. The man was Blaise Zabini!
Harry wasted no time. As the defenseless Auror squirmed with pain on the ground, he jumped on the back of the Kareach member, who thankfully wasn’t very large, and managed to push them to the ground. The Auror who had been tortured grabbed the wand that had rolled out of the Kareach member’s hand and used it to fire a spell at another Kareach member approaching from behind.
Harry’s head whips to the direction Al is pointing in. Sure enough, a few rows down, Scorpius is sitting there with not only his father, but Blaise and Pansy. The worst possible group Harry could talk to at the moment.
Harry smiled, “Something like that.”
He tried now to scream to no avail. His voice, like his body, was out of his control. His mind began racing with the possibilities of what could be happening to the Aurors fighting at the Ministry. If he was left like this, abandoned on an unidentified floor unable to move, he didn’t want to know the fate of anyone else who had been fighting.
“Ida, I’m not going to stop being Draco’s friend. You can believe what you want, but I know your wrong,” Harry said confidently.
“No,” Harry spoke as Molly shot him a warning look, “no worries, Molly, I have no more information than you or Bill. But,” he reassured, “Uncle Ron, Padma and Ida all said they are working hard to stop these terrible people. There is no reason to worry.”
Aviary raised her eyebrows, “So anyone who was in the Order can get in?”
Malfoy let out a sudden snort to this. Harry saw something light up in his eyes. Here was the Malfoy he had seen briefly at the bar, the one who spoke of ferrets and Harry’s bad naming skills.
Draco answered softly, “Just us.”
“A bloody good tradition that is!” Neville countered, “Not to mention the fact it was a rather good Bat-Bogey! I’m starting to think Harvin’s been taking lessons from Ginny.”
Harry fell back into her arms, crying so hard he could hardly catch his breath. Molly let him, not wavering until Harry finally pulled away, wiping water from his face.
“Harry!” Draco yelled, grabbing his arm and yanking Harry around to face him again, “You need to tell me!”
Harry searched frantically around the pub for Malfoy. To his dismay, the beanie clad man was nowhere in sight. Harry sighed and heaved himself onto an empty stool. He supposed he could call Malfoy, but he wanted to tell him everything that had just happened in person. He wanted to share his anger towards Ida, Padma and Aviary with someone. Having long forgotten his awkward interaction with Malfoy only hours before, he was now focused on finding the git and talking to him.
“He’s upset that he’s not dating Draco,” James said brazenly.
“No, this is not important,” she shot up from the floor, “I’ve told you what I needed to. Let the record show that I had to make a special plea to get you here today, because I thought you deserved to know the truth about everything, after how much you helped yesterday. But I see now that we are not on the same page about telling each other important information.”
“Unfortunately, I did,” Blaise said regretfully. He regained his confidence and laughed, “It was Seamus’s idea. Promote the match by showing a friendly competition between the Games and Sports employees, coaches, and players. Clearly the teams were mixed, because none of Games and Sports could win against any of those coaches or players.”
“There’s a difference between ex-Slytherins and ex-bigots,” Aviary said fiercely. Harry looked at her, surprised. This was the harshest he had ever heard her talk to anyone.
“No!” Molly shouted. Harry turned around to face her, “Don’t leave, Harry.”
“Seamus?” Harry asked weakly, “What are you doing here? Where’s Ginny?”
Ginny looked at him in alarm. Then, to his surprise, she threw her arms around him.
Malfoy looked back at Harry and then down at his elbow, in which Harry abruptly dropped. He seemed reluctant, but he slowly sat back in the chair beside Harry and signed.
By the way he asked, Harry knew Ron already guessed how. Harry felt his face heat up slightly as he ran his hand over the back of his neck.
“We heard the nurses talking, mum,” Al said, “We know that Ida tried to kill dad but then Draco tried to save him.”
Harry couldn’t believe he was saying this, but the words were rising before he could stop them, “Glad to know I’m only worth kissing when you’re in a moment of crisis. I’m not some fucking security blanket, Malfoy.”
“Oh really?” Harry asked.
“How is Zabini as the department head? He always seemed like an entitled prat to me, but Kingsley appears to be rather fond of him.”
“No. Harry do not tell me I imagined this all. I know Ida’s voice. When you are in multiple high pressure situations with someone, you know their voice all too well. And now all I hear is her voice, saying she was going to kill him!”
“Yes!” Rose said enthusiastically, “How did you know? You can’t even see the top of him from here.”
“Where?” Seamus asked.
Once their laughter died down, Harry could feel tension full the room once again. He forced himself to address Draco.
Draco raised his eyebrows and turned back to Aviary. He opened his mouth as if to speak, then stopped. Just like Harry, he seemed to be at a loss of what to say. When he did finally speak, it was with a deliberation that could only come from Draco.
Despite how rude this was, Harry couldn’t help but appreciate being identified for being something other than ‘The Chosen One’. He doubted anyone had ever referred to him as ‘Ginerva’s husband’. But that could also be because Ginny would not hesitate to murder anyone who called her Ginerva.
“No, you would not!” she argued, “Slytherin is not a life-long sentence of evil! I now know plenty of people who are Slytherin and are nothing but kind and gracious, while also possessing the cunning and power-seeking qualities that define the Slytherin house. Power can be held for good reasons, Ron.”
“Yes, I’m here bearing great news! Healer Patrick wants to work with you personally over the next week! She has seen your hard work and diligence as a healer aid and wants to keep you for himself to see if you would ever be a good fit in his department,” Brayan beamed at him, any disappointment clearly gone.
“Draco… it wasn’t personal,” Harry began, “You have to believe me! It has nothing to do with spite or anger at you! I did it for the investigation, that’s all.”
Draco released his arm as soon as they were inside and began to look around. Aviary held on tightly, her eyes closed as she breathed tightly.
With all that in mind, Harry was also trying to deal with the fact that Christmas was only days away. Not to mention the larger problem about what to say to Dean and Seamus. Dean had only recently left his bed in St. Mungos and was now recovering at home. This gave Harry faith that he and Seamus hadn’t… well… shagged. Harry knew the longer he waited to tell them the more of a chance this abstinence was going to end, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. If he knew Dean, he was in bed miserable, desperate to get back to his job. The last thing he needed after the traumatic events of the hospital attack was Harry telling him that he had lost all ability to reproduce and that he could spread this to his husband. Harry focused on meeting with Draco, Ron and Padma and ignored the guilt building up inside him. Thankfully, Draco hadn’t asked him about it. Draco hadn’t asked him much of anything, lately, that wasn’t directly related to the case. Harry knew Draco wasn’t over how rude he had acted by blatantly ignoring him for a week straight, but whenever he tried to bring it up, Draco waved him away and told him to focus on the investigation. With all of this on his mind as the weeks gave way to Christmas Eve, it was no wonder Harry felt anything but the Christmas spirit.
“Draco…” Harry started, half wondering how Draco carried all these books into the room. Only half of the lot was crushing his lap. He tried not to think of the implications that came with this strength.
“Draco, I said I was sorry. I was trying my hardest to find a solution to this. You have to understand it was never personal.”
“We all managed to get off early tonight,” Ron said, “Although we’ll be facing mountains of paperwork and meetings tomorrow,” then, as if something had just occurred to him, he gestured to his fellow Aurors and said to Dean and Seamus, “I hope it’s not a problem I invited some extra Aurors. We could all use a break, and Sunday’s at your flat is the perfect way to do just that.”
“I’m allowed some chair tosses, Harry,” Draco snapped, “It doesn’t mean I’m not focused.”
“Zabini wasn’t going to get the Head of Security job,” she showed Harry the paper. At the top, the name ‘Hugo Ranz’ was listed as the new head of security, “Ranz was. Then the next day, Ranz disappeared and Zabini was declared as Kingsley’s new choice. The Aurors focused on Ranz’s disappearance only. He was already working in Security and was a promising candidate, so we thought he was taken out by the Imperius Attacker. But, Harry,” she turned to him in excitement, “What if that’s not the takeaway? What if Ranz disappeared solely for Zabini to take his position? What if Zabini himself caused the disappearance? It would explain how Zabini was chosen out of everyone to head the department!”
“That, I apologize for,” Malfoy explained as he took a seat at the table and gestured for his son to do the same, “Scorpius’s mother couldn’t get out of work on time to pick him up. She should be here any minute, however. She works on the first floor.”
She took one look at Ginny and Harry’s expressions before she ran over to the bed and wrapped them in a hug.
Harry nodded. He knew better than to argue over a plan with Draco.
“Sir!” Harry exclaimed, “Eh… how are you?”
“That,” Malfoy declared, “Is a three drink Draco topic.”
“What?” Harry cleared his throat and tried to focus on Seb.
Draco laughed beside him, “I’m still amazed at how quickly those three makeup.”
“Yes I do!” she insisted. Her laughter died down as she turned to look directly at him, “I always had a feeling. I mean, come on, I’ve had an expert ‘gay-dar’ ever since I was a teenager.”
The name felt weird to say, as if it was tabooed like Voldemort’s name had once been. He had never said Draco’s name if he could avoid it. Harry hadn’t realized how much it bothered him; but if the two were friends now, shouldn’t they call each other by their proper names? Harry was determined to break the schoolboy taboo and address Draco by his actual name, not the surname Harry knew Draco did not value as much as he once did.
“I don’t know!” Draco huffed, “Wherever Ida and the rest of Kareach decide to strike next!”
“You seemed so happy around Astoria,” Harry said, taking a large gulp of his beer as he waited for Malfoy to say something.
“There’s not really anything to tell,” Draco admitted bitterly, “It was all a dead end. I waited outside some Russian pub for hours and absolutely nothing happened. And I had the inside bugged so I would’ve heard if someone apparated in.”
“Nothing is wrong,” Draco said evenly, “Not if I forget the fact you accused my best friend of a heinous crime.”
“Ginny,” he whispered, “Thank you for saying that. I’ve been meaning to say the same thing, but I didn’t know how.”
“Is Chann the poison?” Aviary asked. Harry could tell that despite how terrible she was feeling about everything, her Auror reflexes were taking over. She needed to know the truth.
“There’s a rumor that an organization named Kareach exists. From what I’ve learned, it’s a new form of Voldemort’s ideology in a cult-like setting run by a pair of leaders. I have multiple sources that confirm the organization will do anything to rid the wizard world of muggleborns and potentially muggles. However, next to no concrete proof exists that the organization exists and that it is a threat to our society. But I know, Potter. I know enough about the dark arts and ignorant ideology to recognize signs. To recognize the perfect secrecy, the oblivating of individuals I’ve talked to, the sudden and mysterious deaths of purebloods. And,” he leaned in closer now to whisper, “I think Kareach is behind the attacks in Diagon Alley and on muggle shops. It all makes perfect sense. What else could pull off such a wide scale and unsolvable attack on muggles and muggleborns? But nobody, not even the Aurors, take the rumors seriously. It was a miracle I even got permission to attempt to do an investigative report on them. My lack of results has only seemed to reassure the Ministry and Prophet that Kareach is a nonexistent threat. None of that matters, really. I’m not going to give up. I can’t give up.”
“Well, I’m certainly not going to steal someone else’s partner, now am I? And anyway, I reckon the best way into the field is being thrown in with an expert,” He beamed at Ida. “I am of course, referring to you.”
Harry watched for a second, relief finding him like an old friend. Dean would be fine with Healer Patrick, he was sure of it. He watched them for a second and then hurried to see who else he could help. He moved to help another trainee control a healer having a seizure when Draco appeared next to him. Harry refused to let himself focus on anything but the man having the seizure as Draco helped with his own spells. Draco had been studying the Imperius attacks for so long that he no doubt knew exactly how to help. The man began to stop flailing, just as a Healer came and leivitated him away. Harry now looked at Draco, who was frantically searching for another person to help, desperation in his eyes. Then all of a sudden Draco was gone. Everything was gone. The room had gone dark, so dark he couldn’t see his own hands in front of him. Then, as suddenly as the lights went out, flashes of green began to head towards them. Harry used the brief flashes of light to see Draco and push him to the ground. Harry’s whole body was stricken with terror as the green lights continued to flash over him.
He bent down beside Aviary, “It was Aries Reyes, wasn’t it? That no good bastard! That’s why you couldn’t tell anyone at the office! Because Ida and Aries are cousins!”
Harry realized this must be the reason Malfoy was here; why else would he be waiting near a conference room?
“Well, we don’t really have time to argue, now do we?” Harry, slightly more bitterly than he had planned, “Let’s go help clear Level One.”
“You were hope,” Draco reiterated simply, “And my life was the opposite of hope.”
“Gin,” Harry said, his voice shaking, “That is how I feel. I’m just… so scared of messing up our family.”
“Ginny…” Harry was desperate now. He was barely aware of the crowd that had gathered around the three of them. He needed Ginny to understand that none of this was personal.
She looked at Dean and Seamus hugging and crying and then Harry and Draco holding hands while Draco cried and turned back to go into the house.
Draco heaved a great sigh and looked up at Harry, “We need to tell the Aurors. But not all of them. Our best bet would be to tell only one or two of them, people we truly trust, so that we have the resources of the Auror department without risking the entire ministry knowing about the poison.”
“Neither of them are big touchers, though,” Aviary pointed out, “Actually, they kind of both hate most contact in general.”
“Wait!” Harry half-shouted anxiously. Ginny looked back at him with an air of impatience.
“Harry, you were right about there being more than one attacker. When the Aurors arrived on the scene, we could clearly see the vast amount of killing curses being fired.”
Ginny sighed, “I know you, Harry. I know that if you are dealing with something difficult and confusing, you go straight to Hermione. Never me. I should have taken that as a sign ages ago.”
“Oi, Potter!” a voice behind him caught Harry’s attention. He turned to see Healer Brayan, walking down the stands towards him, “I knew I would be seeing you here.”
Draco shook his head, “No, it’s always about that. I’m an ex-Death Eater. That’s something I can never erase from myself. I will never truly be a valued part of the wizarding community.”
“Sir, Harry and I have crucial news to the Imperius case,” without asking, she stepped past Savant and into the room so she could set down all of her papers on his desk after clearing off his own things with her wand.
No answer. Harry pulled out his wand and muttered “lumos” to get his bearings. There were four different doors at the end of the hallway. He made his way towards the first one. He tapped loudly. When there was no answer, he opened the door to reveal a bathroom. He continued to the next room, did the same thing, and discovered a spare bedroom. He made his way to the third door and opened it without knocking. He gasped when the light of his wand reflected off of something shiny. He found the light switch on the wall beside him and flipped it, illuminating the entire room. He was immediately bombarded with dozens and dozens of reflecting objects. Harry moved closer to inspect the mysterious objects, and found he was looking at rows and rows of vases, plates, cups, bowls and more. He forgot about all he had come here for, he forgot about his search for Draco. The pottery was beautiful, intricate, breathtaking. He moved down the first row, realizing that each piece had its own design, painted on with painstaking detail. Harry’s breath caught when he spotted one that looked all too familiar. It was him. On a plate. Sitting at Smith and Walton’s, a large black mug of tea in front of him. He was in mid-laugh, clearly enjoying something Draco had said. Harry marveled at how Draco had viewed these meetings at Smith and Walton’s. Or in the park, Harry thought as he noticed a bowl with him, Draco and Murr painted in the center. Draco has painted them both smiling down at Murr, who was jumping up onto Harry. Draco had seen their interactions as Harry had; as so much more than a partnership, but a friendship. Two people finding they had much more in common then they could have ever anticipated. Draco felt something for him. And Harry knew that by the two attempted kisses Harry had gotten from him, they were certainly feelings of more than just friendship.
“That’s incredible!” Harry said, “Surely you know my friend, Hermione? She’s the head of International Magical Cooperation at the Ministry.”
“Of course!” Lavender assured, reaching across the armchair to touch Luna’s arm, “Why wouldn’t we? All of you girls are our closest and oldest friends!”
Dean heaved a loud sigh, “I guess I can only hope our wedding night made the top ten of your best nights.”
“Where’s the nearest fireplace here?” Draco asked.
Harry grabbed the article, “Where did you get this?”
“They’ll be listening to whatever it is you have to say,” Ginny warned to group, “So I surely hope what happened was an age appropriate incident.”
Saying Draco looked stunned was an understatement. After a moment, Draco placed his arms awkwardly around Ron and looked at Harry in confusion. Ron pulled back and began thanking Draco.
Throwing more floo powder in, he announced his next location( “Ministry of Magic, Ron and Padma’s office”) before sticking his head back in the fire.
“Our poor girl!” Savant spoke, “She needs to get her rest. Thanks for letting us know her whereabouts, Potter.”
“You’re pregnant?!” Harry blurted.
“Sorry about this,” the man winced with pain as he said this, but still managed to have a wide grin across his face, “I usually make a better first impression.”
“Of course,” Draco said.
“Hermione?” Harry asked softly, almost hoping she didn’t hear him.
“Like to drag out the story, don’t you?” Malfoy mumbled, scratching down Harry’s words on a parchment.
“Ginny,” he broke the silence, “I don’t hate you for cheating. You’re right. I have been distant and just plain terrible for a while now.”
“As good as I can be, I suppose,” Padma looked at Harry, a determination behind her sadness, “I have a job to do, justice to bring upon my cousin. He would want me to keep working strong.”
“No, of course not,” Aviary sighed, “It’s just terrifying. I know I don’t know either of you very well, but I can’t stand the thought of losing anyone else. I mean, Gani was an Auror, and he died!”
Sure enough, Pansy and Padma were making their way towards the table.
“You were rude to me!” Lily insisted.
“Harry fucking Potter,” he said, shaking his head. He ran a hand through his long, jet (change) black hair and sighed, “It didn’t have to be this way, you know. Fucking half blood,” he turned around to face Draco, “And you! A pureblood! You could have survived nicely in this new order.”
“It’s true, you were,” Scorpius added in while Rose nodded in agreement.
“Harry,” Ida said, grabbing on to his arm, “Of course I don’t want to say any of this. I want to believe Malfoy is good. But I wasn’t raised under the influence of prejudice and hatred. My parents let me make my own views and ideals from the time I was a young girl. I don’t rebel against their beliefs, just their expectations of me. They wanted me out of the Auror field, they thought it was no reasonable job for a young girl trying to make her way in a new society. I believe that people have the strength to make their own decisions and fight for what they want to do. But I just don’t think I can believe that Malfoy’s views he once clearly and openly shared with his parents are now all gone. Most likely he wants to re-establish his place in England as an admirable part of society. And, I’m sorry Harry, but you would be his best way to do that. You are the single most important person to most of England.”
Ginny laughed shortly, “That is true. We’re going to make great ex-spouses.”
“Yes,” Aviary jumped in, clearly excited at a new bit of evidence, “We have been able to use our wands to pick up traces of what wand has been used to cast the Imperius curse!”
Relief flooded through him at these words, but Harry knew by Ron’s expression that there was still something he wasn’t telling him.
“Al,” Harry said, “I think it’s best if we stay in seats at the moment.”
Surprised at the sudden change in Malfoy’s behavior, Harry said nothing. He wondered if the new Malfoy he had briefly witnessed was only for his family’s benefit.
“Go Puddlemere!” Roxy shouted, appearing behind George with a Puddlemere flag in hand. Harry noticed that both her and Fred were dressed head to toe in blue and gold.
Malfoy looked back at him, a mix of emotions swelling across his face. He looked angry and sullen, but almost excited at having shared his frustration. Harry thought he was going to say something else, but a dark look suddenly consumed Malfoy’s face and he jumped out of his chair, “I need to find Pansy,” he slurred wearily, finally showing his true level of drunkenness.
From the front of the room, Brayan said, “Now Potter, I know you are having a big day with the article release. But I can’t grant you a free pass to talk in my morning briefing, no matter how much you’ve earned it!”
“One that has to do with Mr. Malfoy?” James asked.
Draco rolled his eyes but leaned in to kiss Harry anyway.
“I have to go, Ida,” Harry said, “But thank you for letting me tell you.”
Harry tried to not worry that Draco hadn’t been back to see him in hours. He was sure that he was getting some well deserved rest, that was all. There was no reason for Harry, absolutely none at all, for him to worry about Draco being gone for several hours without contacting him. Just because Harry wanted to spend every waking minute with Draco now that he knew Draco liked him back didn’t mean that’s what Draco wanted.
Harry stared at him in confused shock (something he felt he was doing too often lately) and said, “He?”
“Potter? Reyes?” he perplexed, “What’s going on? I haven’t seen you two together in months.”
Harry huffed, “Well, just so you know, I think you should show people! Or even sell them! You could do something where you don’t have to keep the profit and you could give it to a charity or something.”
“Making it the perfect poison to halt the lineage of muggleborns,” Hermione finished. Her voice sounded detached from herself, as through it was somewhere else entirely.
“He has tried to follow in his father’s footsteps since your defeat of Voldemort. Get this; years and years ago, just after the second wizarding war, he went to Cambodia to search for this rare poison he had heard about from his father.”
“Shut up, you prat,” Harry said.
“You didn’t ask it of me,” Harry said simply, “I asked it of you. And I understand the risk, I died once.”
Harry looked at his eldest in surprise, “Of course, James.”
“Right there!” he pointed, “Four attacks are practically forming a circle around him! Ida,” his continued, his voice urgent, “Did you see Blaise during the attacks? Did anyone? Was he helping, or seen fleeing?”
“It’s the poison, isn’t it?” Luna asked abruptly, “That is what’s upsetting you. Whatever is in the poison harmed Dean and the other victims in an irreversible and drastic way. One that left Dean unable to reproduce, I presume, by your reaction just now?”
“Pulled off the green and red look? I sure hope so,” Seb said, “This hospital has too many attractive healers for me to look bad while I’m half-dead with dragon pox.”
“He did look outside today, right?” Harry questioned, looking through the window at the large raindrops accompanying the grey sky.
“And please,” the patient continued, the ridiculous smile now back upon his face, “Do call me Seb. Mr. Haffer is my father, the git.”
Harry nodded, then said, “But Malfoy’s different. He’s just… well… he’s straight!”
Harry walked into his empty house and collapsed down on the living room couch. Healer Patrick had asked to work with him once again this week. This was, of course, an amazing thing that Harry was thrilled about. But it also meant Harry had spent the day trailing the fast-paced healer, barely stopping to breath before Patrick whisked him off to her next patient. Harry knew he would never work quite like her when he became a full-fledged healer. Yes, he would be quick and hopefully good at problem solving, but he would take more time with each of his patients. He couldn’t form bonds like Healer Patrick did: effortlessly and at a breakneck speed. But, Harry chided himself, there would be little opportunity for him to be a healer if the world was taken over by Kareach. With that gloomy image in mind, Harry rose and made his way over to his fireplace, nerves unexpectedly claiming his stomach.
Harry snorted. In all actuality, Harry wouldn’t expect anything else from a pet of Malfoy’s. He had already seen the way he treated everything in his life, with a care and precision Harry hadn’t thought possible, and he was best friends with Hermione Granger- Weasley. He had also met Malfoy’s gracious and dignified child, so it was no wonder he raised a ferret to be held up to the same standards.
“Is everyone okay? Where are the kids?” Harry asked urgently.
Draco hesitated, but then shook his head, “Everything’s fine,” he said shortly.
“Why?” Harry asked, shocked.
“I mean,” he continued, “I’ve been around death my entire career. It’s not like after the war the possibility of losing my loved ones just disappeared. It has just… been so long since I’ve truly had to come face to face with the possibility that I could lose more people I love. Or that they could lose me.”
