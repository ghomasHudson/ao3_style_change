Draco groaned playfully. “No, not yet. Not all of us can be as talented as you, Mr Potter.” he grinned.
Sirius had always adored Remus’s eyes. They were a dark, honey colour, exactly like the kind you would find dripping out of a beehive, fresh and natural. When they were filled with tears, the colour was intensified. He hated to say it, but it was probably the most heart-breakingly beautiful thing he had ever seen, even when the tears were sad.
“Do you know that the Sorting Hat gave me a choice this evening? He asked if I wanted to go in Slytherin or Gryffindor. I chose Slytherin. I chose you.”
“Ah, yes. That can sometimes happen. But the point is, the bones are no longer broken-” He carried on rambling, but Harry was grotesquely fascinated by his used-to-be arm, which now resembled jelly.
“Alright, how about you, me and Draco all lift this onto the train? Then it can be a joint effort. How about that?” The raven haired boy seemed to consider this for a moment, before allowing Draco and Sirius to help him. It took a few minutes, but eventually, after giving Draco a giant hug, whispering in his ear to write as often as he could, and giving Harry a pat on the back and wishing him luck, Remus could see his son sitting comfortably in a compartment opposite the scrawny boy and smiled. He felt warm arms wrap around his torso and breathed in the familiar smell of his husband. Waving his son off, both men felt a wave of emotion crash around them.
He bit his lip and sat back in his chair, face flushed with irritation. His bespectacled friend nudged his shoulder and quietly asked if he was okay. He nodded.
“No.” His voice was barely above a whisper. “Those bastards. You don’t want to work for them anyway, Moons.”
“That’s fine. One of us will just take the other one to go back.” The dark haired boy stilled for a moment, a cloud crossing over his features.
btw romione is still very much on the table, i'm just going to have some fun with hermione because i love her and i want to
In other news, I just danced around my room to Madonna's 'Into the Groove' so I think it's safe to say I'm in a pretty good mood.
Hogwarts was looming just over Sirius' shoulder and Draco stared at it, a place which had once seemed hopeful and good sort of grew faded with each year Draco entered. Through the buzz of excitable students, Draco could hear the sounds of someone yelling his name excitedly.
“Huh.” Draco huffed. “Boring. Let’s go.” But Harry felt strangely drawn to the book, and pocketed it anyway.
Harry faithfully recounted the lunchtimes’ events. Once he had finished, Professor McGonagall leaned back in her chair, stared at the ground and seemed to ponder the story. At some point, she came to a resolution and produced her wand, using it to conjure a tartan biscuit tin and a tea set.
“Yes, we were all very good friends. My name is Remus, this is my husband Sirius, and this is Draco, our son.” Draco held out his hand sheepishly and James’s ghost shook it with unnecessary force before withdrawing it abruptly. Remus recognized a look in his son’s eyes that appeared whenever he was enraptured by something, it almost made him smirk. “Would you like some help getting onto the platform?”
“Oh, right, well.” Sirius cleared his throat for dramatic effect. “I have been promoted to manager at the Hogsmeade branch of Zonko’s!”
“Harry?” Draco rushed up the stairs and into his room, expecting to find Harry staring down a particularly large spider, not a house elf. “Harry, what’s a house elf doing in here?”
It was like art. To him, art had always been beyond research or analytics, which, as someone who would spend most of his time in the library, was a big thing to say. Art was never meant to be ripped apart, or graded on, or analysed. It was meant to be enjoyed as a simple constant. In life, he was happy to content himself with being in the dark about some things. Perhaps one day it would be revealed that he was some child of a stupid prophecy, or a reincarnation of an ancient spirit, but he didn’t care.
“I hope so too.” They both watched as Harry and Ron, Hermione had corrected him, got their potion marked. It was a mess, a bright, oozing yellow rather than the pale gold it was supposed to be. Still, they were laughing so hard, they seemed not to notice. Draco felt a slight pang of jealousy but also remembered the times that he and Harry had laughed that hard. It would be nice, Draco concluded, to have friends in other houses. And, strategically, it seemed like a good idea. “I’m sorry Ron was so rude to you when you first met. His family believe a lot of the stories about you. Nothing against them, they’re lovely people, but the rumours have apparently been circulating for years.” Draco was unfazed. If Ron didn’t want to like him, that wasn’t his fault. But Hermione seemed to think that he had some redeeming qualities, so if they did end up trying again, he wouldn’t be wholly against that.
” he cast, causing the thing to fall limply to the ground. “Gotcha.” Draco scooped it up and grinned. “Moony! Pads! I got him!” he called.
Draco sighed in exasperation and rolled his eyes in a classically Draco way. “Well, what do you suggest we do, Harry?”
“Yes.” The creature wasn’t particularly friendly, Harry noted, but chose to ignore it in favour of Draco’s face, which was the picture of unexpected, unadulterated joy. “I will sing it now.”
“Don’t you think we’ll get into a lot of trouble if we’re caught?” whispered Harry as they were settling themselves in their hiding place, a wardrobe filled with teacher’s coats.
“I can’t tell if he’d be proud or irritated.” They shared a light chuckle. It was sad, Draco thought, that he never got to meet Harry’s father. He must have been a wonderful person, judging by the way Sirius and Remus talked about him, and by how Harry turned out.
Christmas Day was wonderful. The dinner was delicious, the snow was thick and fluffy, everyone seemed to forget all of their awful thoughts. Like the previous year, Draco and Harry exchanged their gifts in private.
Harry needed to show Draco, he needed someone to tell him that he wasn’t crazy. He hastily covered himself in the cloak and sped down the hall until he reached the Slytherin common room, where he held the cloak open and demanded that Draco come with him. After some protestations, Harry finally planted the other boy in front of the mirror and waited for his reaction. His face lit up.
What's your Patronus? I've taken the quiz at least five times and got a different answer every time, but I reckon it's snake or dragon or something - some kind of reptile that sheds its skin 🐍
“Hello, Harry,” he had said. “I’m Ron Weasley.” The Weasley boy kept stealing glances at Draco, as though he was ready for him to pounce at any moment. Harry had shaken hands with him, a shy smile toying at his lips, clearly uncomfortable with people knowing his name without him offering it.
Harry opened his mouth to ask a question but Draco beat him to it. “Where did you see the eyes, Myrtle?”
The first three weeks of Summer were dreadful for Harry. Vernon was on edge the whole time, terrified of Harry’s newfound powers and the big ‘M’ word which had caused quite a stir at breakfast once. And it was only because Harry had used it to try and get Dudley to have some decent manners and say the big ‘P’ word. Still, it would all be over soon for in only a few minutes, Sirius would be arriving to pick him up for three weeks of summer fun, and Harry couldn’t be more excited. He didn’t know how Sirius would arrive, dramatically probably. In his letters, he repeated the promise that he would place a curse on Vernon the second he arrived, one that would probably involve diarrhoea or excessive BO. Or at least that was what he said, his tone when he promised this to Harry at Kings Cross was deadly. If Hagrid could give Dudley a tail, God knows what Sirius could do.
He asked everyone to split off into pairs, so Harry and Draco moved away to a discreet corner of the room.
“Draco!” Harry half whispered, taking a seat next to his friend, who looked up from his book and smiled brightly.
A mutual shudder ran through the room like an icy blade. Draco laced his fingers through Harry’s under the table.
“Okay.” They could hear footsteps growing fainter, and waited until they were completely gone until they started to talk.
“And how are you going to explain why you let us be here, genius?” asked Draco, snarkily, as he raised his own wand in defiance, Lockhart seemed a little confused but did his best to remain strong. “I doubt any of the teachers would like the fact that you brought two minors into the Chamber of Secrets with you to fight a monster you ‘have known about this whole time’. As a matter of fact, I think my dads would sue you for all you’re worth, so drop the wand, psycho.” The Professor’s eyes widened and he lowered the wand just a little, but still had it ready to be raised. “Oh for Merlin’s sake, Harry, help me out.”
“It’s fine, Harry. I’ll just watch. And what are you going to be, Weasley?” Clambering up onto the horses back, the Weasel (as was the recent creative nickname for him in the Slytherin common room) huffed.
They rushed towards each other and hugged like their lives depended on it, squeezing the last of the air left in their lungs. It was good to know that Draco wasn’t alone, especially at a time like this. He bid his farewells and started the trek to his former headmaster’s office.
“What, why?” It was so frustrating, how everyone seemed to be afraid of Draco. He was an eleven-year-old boy. What could he possibly do?
“My aunty says that I shouldn’t let other people do things for me” Sirius glanced up at Remus, and down once more to Harry.
“Hello, Harry.” greeted Fred. Harry spun round, pulling his leather satchel tighter over his shoulder and raising his eyebrows quizzically.
Here, Harry gasped lightly. Snape hadn’t seemed to notice, however, as the insults were still being written by a seemingly invisible hand.
Riddle’s cool expression was now replaced with a hideous grimace. “Dumbledore’s been driven out of this castle by the mere
“HARRY! Oh my gosh, we’ve won! WE’VE WON!” Draco cackled and hugged his dads before catching eyes with Harry, who had just landed. The energy in the air was electric. The whole world seemed to still around them, as they stayed locked in each other’s gaze. As if his feet were moving of their own accord, Draco raced down the steps and met Harry on the field. Before he could say a single word, the other boy caught his lips in a searing kiss, a real one. Bigger than the chaste ones they had shared before, it was held for longer, it held more emotion. When they parted, Draco could barely breathe from the intensity of those emerald eyes fixed completely on him, and the rest of the world faded away until it was only them left, standing on an empty field, caught up in the other’s arms. A massive gust of air hit them, causing Harry’s hair to mess up even further, revealing that famous scar.
“I think we have to play. Alright, Harry, you go in the place of that bishop, Hermione you be a castle.”
Have a lovely evening/day/night/morning whatever time it is when you're reading, and i'll see you when I next decide to post a chapter, or perhaps in the comments section. :)
. Harry felt an unreasonable amount of rage towards that man. Not only because he seemed to treat Harry as though he were some celebrity, desperate for attention like he was, but also because Draco seemed infatuated by him. He was an idiot, anyone with brains could see that, even Draco, but after twenty minutes of listening to the other boy gush about the man’s smile, Harry realised that it wasn’t so much about his personality or ‘achievements’ (Achievements that he doubted the authenticity of.), more to do with his looks. Still, Draco was obsessed. He stayed up, late at night, rereading
“The Brothers Grimm.” he read. The book itself was exquisitely bound. It was dark blue leather with small, gold embellishments here and there. Vines with thorns on them, a spindle, an apple. It was truly magnificent. On the inside were dozens  of stories.
Both of them had chosen simple platinum bands for each other, but on the inside had engraved stars and moons to make them more personal.
“You’ll do this even if I don’t come with you, won’t you?” Grinning, Harry nodded. “Fine. Lets go.” The pair shucked off their robes when Draco pointed out that if anyone sees a flash of green they’ll immediately send them to the dungeons, and climbed the stairs to the girls toilets. On the way there, however, they saw a flurry of black robes billowing. Snape was headed towards the third floor.
What unnerved him was what unnerved him when he was younger, and what perhaps was unnerving him as he sat in the courtyard on a bench next to Harry, that Moody’s swivelling eye never left their them, and seemed to dart between them sporadically.
He thought of his dads, how they begged him not to do anything stupid, he thought of Ginny, who only wanted a friend to confide in, he thought of Harry, his wonderful, sweet, genuinely good Harry, who just didn’t know when to stop. Who only wanted to help people.
Are any of you online schooling or working from home? If so, I empathise, we'll get through this together with a lot fo fanfiction.
“...Not on Christmas. But, maybe sometime? Would that be okay?” Draco had never seen Harry look so scared, even when they were fighting the troll or running from Filch.
Hooch seemed to be paying little attention to them, but lazily said. “Don’t fight.” As if it that was going to help. “Welp, Potter. I think it’s best if I go and get another bludger from the store room. Weasley, try and get that thing back in it’s box.” She exited with billowing robes and left the teams standing dumbly in the centre of the field.
Harry shifted uncomfortably, and a dark cloud fell over his features. “You can’t stop me, I’ll do it anyway.”
The ass-mouth started to be filled with small crumbs of bread, and seemed wholly engrossed in the activity, because it didn’t notice when Draco took a deep breath and sent a small snow flurry over to it, cold enough to make it shiver and slow to a near stop. It could barely move when he finally whipped out his wand and stunned it.
He could feel someone coming up being him and turned sharply to glare them away but found that it was Harry, a concerned look painting his features.
“I felt it best that they did not grow up in close quarters. However, a small event of little importance, other than to the people that know about this, yourselves, Minerva, Severus and myself, may have changed things.”
Christmas fell upon the Hogwarts and Hogsmeade area like a thick blanket, coating every surface, touching every corner, and dusting each branch and twig.
While for the rest of Hogwarts, Hogsmeade trips were a joy, to Harry, on the anniversary of his parent’s deaths, and to Draco, a boy who was still haunted by the faces of his loved ones killed at his hand, it seemed like it was more of an inconvenience, but it did give them the opportunity to seek comfort in two men who knew what their pain was, and would do everything in their power to make them feel better.
“That must be what Fluffy’s hiding!” said Harry, and Draco nodded, lip between his teeth. “I wonder what it does.”
The pair had been inseparable since the first night, and Draco needed somebody to vent to after finding out that his father was a werewolf. Harry needed a little explaining as to what exactly that meant, but for the most part could understand that it was a grave thought indeed.
Harry didn’t quite know what to think. He always thought of Snape as a bit of a bully, really. With his constant picking on Neville, calling Harry a ‘celebrity’, grading Hermione’s potions poorly. His father stopped bullying, but Snape didn’t.
“Pads, you realise that nobody will want to hire me now?” Oh. Right. Both men sat in contemplative silence as the minutes dragged by. “What are we going to do?”
It ended up being that Harry would be sleeping on the floor in Draco’s room, even though they had a spare. Both boys decided that it would be endless amounts of fun to wake up together on Christmas morning, so it all worked out, despite protestations from Moony. So, on Christmas Eve, Harry and Draco hid themselves underneath the blanket of Draco’s bed with a flashlight.
In about ten minutes, Draco was given a small stash of bread from the house elves and strict instructions to wait quietly for the rat to come out and get it.
“We’re so sorry!” said Sirius despairing, still keeping his voice low. “We shouldn’t have snooped, we were just so worried about you!”
“A few weeks after we spoke. He was worried about you, said you were doing excessive research or something.” Draco looked down at his palms.
“Lupin! I want a word.” There came no reply. Snape muttered something about how he must be at home and called out the address of the Lupin-Black’s residence.
“Can we just try again in the morning, please?” The edges of Sirius’s eyes were raw and red, clearly he needed sleep before confronting Dumbledore.
“Well… when we were in our first year, Harry - young carefree and innocent-” Harry snorted. He doubted Fred and George had ever been innocent. “-Well, more innocent than we are now - we got into a spot of bother with Filch…”
“Moony and Pads were teenagers when they made this. I don’t think it was beyond them to make a mistake.”
When Draco got back, the boys spent every moment that they could in the other’s company, making up for lost time, even if that lost time was only two weeks, but they also dove headfirst into research again. They even enlisted the help of ghosts around the school, but they were little help. All they did was shudder and refuse to comment, even the Bloody Baron, who was known for discussing dark topics with students. They were all but ready to give up hope until Draco suggested that they try Moaning Myrtle, as a last resort.
They both looked up to the sky again, Harry’s mind flashing with the image of his father, comforting his friend. A young Remus and Sirius, holding hands and laughing at some joke one of them told. It made his heart ache just a little, but he welcomed it. He rarely got glimpses of what his father was like, it was nice to know that he was, at the very least, kind.
before Harry and Ron leaped in after her, leaving Draco on his own with a sleeping, three-headed dog, playing a harmonica. He held onto the melody for as long as he could before allowing himself to fall down the rabbit hole. He landed with a thump, on a strange, squishy substance. Hermione was on the side, avoiding the stuff completely, whereas Harry and Ron screamed as they were being strangled by the stuff completely. “Stay calm, don’t fight it.” Draco did as he was told but the other two boys seemed incapable of following a simple order. “It’s Devil’s Snare”
Get ready for some Lupin-Black family cuteness! They are so fun to write about, I just couldn't get enough haha.
He was beyond words. The wound looked really bad, the fang had splintered when the basilisk collapsed, even when Draco removed it, the damage was already done. Hot tears were streaming down his face, they were so close. He couldn’t contain the jerking sobs as he took in Harry’s emerald eyes for what he feared would be the final time. He wanted to tell him that he loved him, but couldn’t quite get out the words. All he could do was keep repeating the word ‘Harry’ like a prayer.
“Malfoy.” Draco finished, and Hagrid’s face paled. He turned his eyes back to Harry and asked, in a low voice, if he could have a word in private. Harry looked confusedly between his friends but followed Hagrid a little further away from Draco.
“GO ON HARRY!” The three of them screamed. He was still hurtling, coming closer and closer to the ground, but pulled up, millimetres from the floor.
“So, Rem, has this ever crossed your mind?” James started with an entrepreneurial double handed gesture that appeared to unfold the inner workings of his plan, which turned out to be something to do with a kind of spell that splattered paint on your chest so that he and Sirius could duel without either of them taking damage.
“Yes, he does.” she nodded gravely. “Draco has been made aware of all of his father’s crimes, I just think that he prefers not to mention that one.” Harry understood. He could still remember their conversation about their parents, the one that happened on the very first night at Hogwarts. He remembered Draco saying that everyone expected him to grow up just like his parents, did everyone expect Draco to be some murderer? Harry could see why Draco wouldn’t exactly broadcast that information, especially not to a boy he had only met that night.
“What are you not telling me?” Ron cringed and opened his mouth to speak before he was interrupted by the presence of the giant man.
“It seems to me that Draco is just being possessed by Ice, the spirit. That can easily be fixed by befriending them.”
“Stop! Dobby stop!” He tried to pry the creature away from it, but it only seemed to spur him on. That was until Remus and Sirius barged into the room.
“Did you run all the way here?” He managed to get out through his giggles. Harry’s breathing was finally under control and he managed to form a coherent sentence.
FINAL CHAPTER!! Thank you so much for reading the first book! I have really enjoyed writing this and I'm really excited about the future of it. Thank you for all the love, kudos, comments literally anything it all makes me so happy! I hope you enjoy this final chapter, I will probably be posting the first chapter of CoS soon, maybe even tomorrow if I feel like it, for now please just enjoy a little bit of Dumbledore bashing and some cute feels! Yay!!!
Madame Pomfrey bravely grasped at his arm and shoved him through the secret entrance, slamming the door behind him. Just like that, he was alone in the dark, dank room, with nothing but his own putrid mind poisoning his actions.
The only sound breaking through the thick silence was the occasional snap of Draco biting into his chocolate.
The giant picnic blanket was still set up, so Harry watched as Draco lowered himself to a horizontal position and followed suit. When he was finally on his back, he looked up to the sky and marvelled at it. You couldn’t see stars like it anywhere else in the country. Harry wondered if Hogwarts had some kind of charm that allowed for greater visibility of the night sky for aesthetic purposes or Astronomy classes. Whatever it was, Harry was stunned. It was like they were surrounded by stars, all glittering like individual diamonds. He drew his attention to the half moon that was hovering above them and immediately turned to Remus, who was lying right next to him, looking at the moon as well.
“Professor, don’t you think it would be best if we let Madame Pomfrey deal with this? She can heal bones instantly.”
Luna watched him. “He doesn’t have many Nargles, I doubt he needs it.” She opened the door further and welcomed them all in, introducing herself to Harry and Hermione, remarking on their Nargle count.
“SORRY?” He cried, sounding slightly hysterical. “Didn’t it cross your mind for a moment there that fire hurts when you touch it?”
Harry loved Draco’s room. It was so personal. The walls were covered in posters of obscure bands and movies, mostly Muggle, surprisingly, and photographs. Once, Harry woke up from a nightmare in Draco’s room and had spent three hours inspecting each picture.
“Myrtle can I ask you a question of a personal nature?” he began, suddenly in stone-cold professional detective mode.
“What on Earth were you thinking of?” She was livid, Harry could tell from that glint in her eye and the curl of her lip. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you in your dormitory?” Harry felt small, what could he do? He had dragged Draco into this. Draco who valued his education and house so very much. But then a small voice came from the shadows.
“I don’t see why not!” Harry smiled. “I honestly don’t know enough about it to give you good advice, if you know what I mean.”
“It was strange, it felt tingly.” he shrugged. “And today, it was so hot and I wanted a cold drink, so I got some ice from the kitchens, but the water was still room temperature so I took some ice out of the glass and held it in my hand and it didn’t feel like anything. It was really strange.”
“This boy is the son of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy.” A sharp intake of breath came from Remus, but Sirius just looked grave.
“Oh he looks ghastly.” Draco giggled. “Didn’t anyone ever tell him that you shouldn’t mix pink and red?” Pansy joined in now, cackling at the idiot, before he called for everyone’s attention. Harry quickly sat down next to Draco and gave the man about half of his attention.
“Let’s go fight a Basilisk, shall we?” Draco grinned in response and set up his pose, as Harry raced forward. It actually wasn’t that difficult to learn how to use the bow and arrow, it was probably bewitched with some kind of magic that prevented you from being bad at it, for it only took one failed aim to finally get the hang of it. After one failed shot, he actually managed to get one on the creature’s underbelly, buried deep. The arrows were clearly sharp.
Harry clung on for dear life but peeked open his eyes slightly to check his surroundings. When he did, he was shocked to find that it wasn’t that scary at all. They were flying over the black lake and Harry could see his reflection in the ripples. It was shocking to see himself so carefree and relaxed. It was as though all the stress from the last few weeks had been banished, being replaced instead by a feeling of freedom unlike any other. He grinned up at the sky and laughed heartily, spreading his arms out in order to feel the full effects of the wind.
and studying for his class. The class itself was useless, however. All the man did was retell stories of his adventures, and would frequently insist on Harry joining him on stage to play a vampire or a witch who he would inevitably end up killing, or curing. Harry felt as though he had learned nothing. And it was humiliating. Everyone in the class would stifle laughs behind their hands whenever the Professor gave him acting notes, and would chortle every time he halfheartedly attempted to follow them.
“Lucius was never able to cast a full Patronus. But, Narcissa did. I have heard from the Healers at St. Mungos that she casts it every now and again because it calms her. It is a dove.” Remus occasionally pondered upon Lucius Malfoy’s failure to cast a corporeal Patronus. He got married, he had a son, exactly what he wanted for the family. Surely those memories would be joyus enough to cast one. He had come to the conclusion, eventually, that they just weren’t. Perhaps those memories were tainted, perhaps by Voldemort’s lurking figure. It surely wasn’t the case of lack of magic, for Lucius was known to have had plenty. What an awful life, Remus would think, to never have been happy enough. Happiness, he had always imagined, could not be measured, but perhaps it could.
Snape’s face grew a dark shade of puce. “This is clearly dark magic, Lupin. When I tried to figure out what it was, it
Thankfully, Hermione thought on her feet and levitated the beast’s paw for a few seconds before depositing it just adjacent to the door. She reached down and yanked it open, exposing a pitch black nothingness.
“It’s like I’m paying back James, somehow. Do you know what I mean?” The man had said the night before. “Like, when I left Walburga and Orion, the Potters took me in and became my second family, so we can be that for Harry now. I know he can’t stay here at Easter or for the first half of Summer, but at least we get Christmas.”
“I love you.” Draco paused for a moment and looked at Harry in bemusement. They had said it to each other before, but it held more meaning to him now.
” Ink began to fan out across the page, and Harry basked in the new power he felt and scanned the page for Draco’s dot, finding him sitting in the Slytherin common room. Harry guessed that he was reading.
“Very. It feels very good to know that I don’t have to see them again.” The look on Harry’s face was heartbreaking. For Draco, the boy symbolised hope and beauty. It hurt him to know that there were people who were anything but kind to him.
“When I got sorted, did you notice how nobody cheered and clapped for me, like they did the other kids, except you?” Draco had noticed.
“But, wasn’t Voldemort a descendent from Slytherin? Doesn’t this mean that I have some link to Voldemort.” his voice was barely above a whisper, but Draco’s ears were always tuned in to the sound of Harry.
Harry turned back to look at him with a grin of pride. “Well, you heard him.” He started walking too, checking back a couple of times to ensure the bumbling fool was indeed trailing him. They found Draco in the girls toilets, as Harry had assumed he would be in, deep in an intense conversation with Myrtle, who was lounging carelessly on the windowsill.
Hello! I just wanted to take a quick moment to say thank you to everybody who has left comments, kudos or subscribed it makes me so happy! I have this story all planned out, up to the last book, and I hope I'll be able to write it all because I really like the ideas I'm having.
PoA is over!! Oh my lord this has taken it out of me. GoF is going to be epic, if everything goes according to plan. Thanks for sticking with it, I know I've been a little off it lately.
“What?” Hermione was watching them as though they were some puzzle pieces, that she only needed to slot together, whereas Draco was grinning and laughing at the state of them.
“Ooh! Draco’s got a Howler!” Cooed Pansy in a sing-song voice. “Go on, Draco, you know what’ll happen if you don’t open it.” He took a deep breath and unfastened the seal, preparing his ears for an onslaught of disappointed yells. In actuality, he was only half right because two voices seemed to be competing for dominance.
They stood up, with the pouch behind their backs, just as the two men were leaving. They shared a quick smirk before Harry caught up with them in the corridor.
The whole situation with Crabbe and Goyle was actually quite ridiculous. Draco and Harry had been having Care of Magical Creatures with the Gryffindors when Hagrid had produced an actual Hippogriff from which the students had to study. It was a typically stupid idea from the get go and it wasn’t surprising when it got out of hand.
“Come on, Draco! You’re amazing at research! We would get this done so much faster if you helped us.” Draco was flattered by the compliment but there was a small nagging in his brain that told him that the name ‘Nicolas Flamel’ was familiar.
Draco’s vision was blurred with tears and pure anger, he had never felt a hatred like this before, not even for Voldemort. Part of him was disgusted at this new feeling, and continued to flash images of Christmases by the heath with his family, of Harry after catching the Snitch in that final Quidditch game and kissing him like he would never get another opportunity, of Pads teaching him to ride a broom, but the other part of him was revelling in it, basking in the feeling, begging Draco to let go and to let it take over. Lucius was saying something to him but he genuinely didn’t care what the content of those words were, all he knew was that his father was the worst type of a person, a waste, a mistake. He wished with all his being that they weren’t related but it didn’t change the fact that looking at him was like looking into the future and it was soul-destroying.
“Large, rusty, probably.” said Hermione as she inspected the lock. Ron and Harry had already collected a broom of their own and were in the air, Draco followed them, keeping an eye out for the key. It was Harry who found it first and returned to the ground gracefully. That boy was a natural flier, and Seeker. Draco knew that Harry would be on the Quidditch team in second year, he didn’t mind. It stung a little at first but he wouldn’t have wanted to be a Seeker anyway.
“I’m guessing that you have been using the diary brainwash people?” Draco suggested, getting slightly sidetracked by the puzzle of it all. “Ginny found it so she wrote in it, and you showed her memories, is that right?”
“Don’t touch magical objects that you don’t know the origins of.” he groaned, tiredly. It had become a part of their routine, that Draco would halfheartedly try to stop him from doing something stupid, before he inevitably did it anyway.
“I don’t think so. I was told a story by my mother as a child. Apparently Fire and Ice were real people originally and loved each other very much, but they fell victim to their carnal, human desire for conflict and grew to hate each other. But she always told me that love was stronger than hate, so the way I see it, Draco, you should be kind to Ice who is living inside of you. They just want a home and someone to be kind to them.”
McGonagall sighed. “Take him to the Forbidden Forest, but don’t go too far in and try to avoid Hagrid’s Care of Magical Creatures class. Also, if any of the creatures who live in the forest approach you, explain the situation. They know all about it and are very good about it. Well, most of them, we’ll keep Hagrid on high alert.”
“I would bet everything I own that you did!” Sirius snapped. It had been a long day. Remus had just gotten back from a particularly bad transformation and work had been rough lately, the last thing they needed was an owl from their ex-headmaster telling them that their son and his friend had killed a full sized Basilisk that was living in a Chamber underneath the school.
“You shouldn’t be ‘anging out wit that boy ‘Arry. Do you ‘ear me?” Hagrid looked sickly and ill. There was something he wasn’t telling him.
Draco didn’t really want to play Quidditch, he just wasn’t in the mood. And if Draco wasn’t in the mood, it turned out that Harry wasn’t either. Instead, they found a place in the stands to sit and talk, so that they could occasionally show an interest in the game, but mostly so that they weren’t overheard.
Draco was wholly against this idea. It seemed ridiculous to him that they should just be throwing themselves down a mysterious hole simply for the reason that one of their teachers might want to steal something from it. Nevertheless, he was still going to do it because, realistically, he would probably follow Harry to the ends of the Earth if only to keep him from falling off. And so, Draco found himself on the third floor of Hogwarts, with his three musketeers, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley and Harry bloody Potter, listening to the soft sounds of a harp playing from behind a closed door that signalled to them that somebody had gotten there before them. Harry expressed his frustration in small hisses to Ron that sounded suspiciously like
“A werewolf is a highly dangerous creature. Upon contact with one you should take great caution. I will not be teaching you how to defend yourselves against one, that would only encourage you. But I will be teaching you about them.” he said. “Turn to page 394.”
The second conversation happened at the same time, and Sirius was nervous. The second Remus and Draco left, he turned to Harry who was flicking through the picture book he had gotten for Christmas.
They didn’t get any punishment. Sirius was angry that they had stolen his bike and the school was angry that they accidentally broke the Statute of Secrecy, but they technically couldn’t do anything. Technically, the Muggles saw the bike because the disillusionment charms faded, which could just have been down to faulty mechanics - not their fault. It was a lucky escape, Harry didn’t even want to imagine the kind of trouble they could be in. He idly wondered if it were possible for a house to be on negative points.
The staffroom itself seemed to have had nothing changed since the last time when he and Harry had infiltrated it, that was until the wardrobe in which they had hidden gave a sudden wobble, as though a creature was hiding in its depths. Surprisingly, Snape was reclined in one of the low armchairs but departed soon after they entered, sniping out a few rude comments about Neville, who Remus ended up choosing to help with the demonstration.
It took him a while to get used to the rabid Gryffindor-ness of it all, but after a bit he realised that Percy, Fred and George should have probably been in Slytherin, with their ambition and cunning, and that the Sorting Hat took over five minutes to sort Professor McGonagall because she was equally a Gryffindor and a Ravenclaw, and that Arthur Weasley had a lot of Hufflepuff traits, so overall it wasn’t that bad.
The next morning, Remus and Sirius were sitting in the kitchen and their son’s black owl came in from the window. Attached to its leg was a roll of parchment that Remus quickly undid and read aloud,
“He’s probably prepared for us to have that. He’ll only come out to people he doesn’t know…” Sirius’s eyes widened and he turned to Remus, who had the same expression.
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible.” said Dumbledore with an air of mystery that Harry couldn’t stand. “Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?” Harry shook his head. “Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised as a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
From then on, strange things started happening to Harry. On one October night, he and Draco were in the Slytherin common room, finishing their transfiguration homework, when Harry felt a strange chill.
“Let's talk to Hagrid! He knows about all of the animals in Hogwarts!” Harry wasn’t sure, the man had been so nice when he first met him, but since then they had barely spoken two words. Only that stunted conversation about Draco on the train station.
“You know what else will be crushed if we don’t get rid of the dragon? Hogwarts. Owl your brother.” So the Weasley Owled his brother. To which he replied with an affirmative, that they would be taking the dragon on Saturday. But, before that, the four had to trudge their way down to Hagrid’s hut to witness the hatching. It was actually quite fascinating. They way it clawed its way through the thick shell and then fixed it’s eye on Hagrid immediately. It almost made Draco feel bad for taking it, but not quite. After much convincing, Saturday finally rolled around and Harry and Draco had the task of delivering the dragon to Charlie Weasley’s friends. Ron had wanted to come but he had received an awful bite from Norbert (that was the name of the blasted thing) and had to stay in the hospital wing. Still, Draco was happy to help if it meant getting rid of the stupid baby dragon. For some unknown reason, Draco was filled with a gross hate for the thing. He tried not to dwell on it, telling himself that it was just because he didn’t like animals, but on the way back something happened. Even though he had no memory of it. According to Harry, he noticed a small scorch mark on his trousers and had ripped off the cloak in the middle of the hall, which was strange because he had absolutely no recollection of it. And they got caught. And now they had detention. With Hagrid. Great.
“I am keyed in on every meeting, no exceptions.” Remus demanded. “Even if you’re going to tell me that there’s another secret chamber,” he listed on his fingers. “a potentially dangerous creature, a professor who may or may not have a mass murderer sucking their soul or possessing them, that includes the use of Polyjuice or the Imperius curse, pretty much anything Voldemort.” Fudge and McGonagall shuddered. “I want to know about
“Ooooh, it was dreadful. It happened right in here. I died in this very cubicle. I remember it so well. I’d hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. The door was locked, and I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in. They said something funny. A different language, I think it must have been. Anyway, what really got me was that it was a
“You know, I have heard many stories about you, Draco Malfoy, but I don’t think that any of them are true.” Draco glowed. Harry was the only person who had ever wanted to get to know him, but he didn’t know any of the stories about him. This Hermione girl clearly did, but she took the time to become friends with him anyway.
“Yeah, and he said something about a man named Nicolas Flamel!” Ron nodded along as Harry gave Draco the play-by-play, still half afraid to speak to the boy unless spoken to.
“Look, sir, time is of the essence here, of which I am sure you are well aware, so we would appreciate it if you would just follow us down the hallway, please and thank you.” With that, the boy turned on his heel and strutted out of the classroom, leaving Harry, who was gazing at him adoringly, with Lockhart, who looked absolutely gobsmacked.
“I think Draco needs to let off some steam right now.” he said, glancing at his boyfriend, who was biting on his lower lip so hard it looked like he could draw blood. “Is there anywhere we can go?”
“Everybody! Gather round. We’re going to choose two of you to do a demonstration.” He looked around the group, pausing on each face, as though he were a child choosing Pick ‘n Mix. He stopped abruptly and gasped. “Ah, Harry Potter.” Harry groaned quietly. “Come up here, my boy, let’s see what you can do.” He sullenly trudged over to the platform and stood next to Lockhart, who was busy choosing the next victim. He pointed his bejewelled finger at Ron. “You.”
. But without these two men, he wouldn’t feel as though he would have anything to live for. “Alright, children, lets go. Are you alright to apparate, Draco?”
“Still. Not. Happening. Surely we can figure something out.” The two men were standing up from their seats, now towering over Dumbledore, who was still seated.
“I don’t know, why is he keeping a giant squid in a lake? The man does things for dumb reasons.” Harry had to give Draco that, but he knew, somewhere, that what he was seeing was his heart’s greatest desire. And he reckoned that Draco knew that too.
“Do you mind telling me what you’re thinking about?” Remus had asked during one of their chocolate breaks.
“I really don’t think you need me! I’ll just be off!” The man tried to jiggle the doorknob, but it seemed stuck, so Harry leapt up and dragged him by his hideous blue coattails until he was sitting, with his legs dangling, in the tube.
James grinned excitedly. “Remus John Lupin, do you take Sirius Orion Black to be your lawfully and magically wedded husband?”
“Don’t move, Potter.” Snape seemed to be enjoying the whole thing, but Harry wasn’t afraid. He had dealt with snakes before. The creature was nearing a student, Justin Finch-Fletchley, fangs exposed, so Harry calmly told it to back away. To his relief, it listened. He carried on whispering calming words to it, guiding it away from the boy. Once it was gone, Harry looked up, expecting to see an expression of gratitude on Justin’s face, but instead found horror. Nobody was speaking, everyone was shocked. Even Draco, whose stony mask had fallen to reveal a blushing mess.
Harry could see in his mind’s eye the image of Draco curled up in a ball on his bed, darting his gaze to the door every few seconds. It made his heart pang. “Can we invite them for a game today?” he suggested. “We need someone to fill the spot you’re going to leave empty!”
The only noises left now in the Chamber, was the heavy breathing of the two boys, the steady drip of excess ink falling to the ground, and a faint moan coming from the direction of Ginny, as she stirred.
“My biological parents. They are Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. Lucius, my father, is currently in Azkaban, wizard prison, because he had strong ties to Voldemort. And my mother was almost chucked in with him, but wasn’t, and then had a nervous breakdown. When I was four, I was given to Sirius and Remus. Everyone expects me to grow up just like them. And, in another universe maybe, without Pads and Moony taking care of me, I might have. Don’t let what other people think define you. If you want to be a good guy, work hard on making your own decisions. That’s all you can do.” Harry seemed to consider his words for a long time before reaching out and loosely holding Draco’s hand, and in a low voice he said.
At one point, they were wandering aimlessly through the corridors, trying to find something interesting to take a picture of, when Draco suggested that they visit Moaning Myrtle, a ghost who apparently resided in one of the girl’s toilets. Harry didn’t quite see the point but would happily follow Draco anywhere.
Percy wasn’t as fun, he spent most of his time doing extra credit work, but he still leaped at the chance to be the referee in their games, probably for the sense of total control it gave him.
Draco’s shoulders fell. “Your dad was a great wizard, just like you. But even he may have made a mistake here. And don’t forget that Peter Pettigrew helped them make it, maybe he did something to it. Either way, I very much doubt that he is here. Why would he be?”
It all grew to be too much and Draco buried his head in Remus' neck and allowed the hot tears to fall for just a moment.
“Probably because your nerves are deadened from being so stupid!” Harry sighed. He wasn’t going to win the argument.
“On the count of three?” Interrupted Draco, he didn’t wait for a reply before he started counting. “One.” They readied their positions. “Two.” Harry braced himself for whatever Draco would hurl at him. But, before Draco could finish the count, they were interrupted by Lockhart clapping for everyone’s attention.
Sirius sighed dramatically. “If I must!” he proclaimed, but Harry held onto his suitcase with a wary look. “It’s okay, mate, I won’t steal it.”
As they stood on the platform, saying their goodbyes, they were surrounded by whispers and points from students around them, who had surely been reading the Prophet over the Summer. Remus and Sirius did their best to shield it, but Draco knew, he could feel their stares creeping up his spine.
The hall had been fully decked out in pink hearts and roses, with heart-shaped confetti falling from the ceiling. Draco chortled with stupid glee.
Draco liked the middle of the night. He didn’t when he was younger. The constant fear of being left alone in the darkness was quite prevalent in his life at such a juvenile age. But time and experience had taught him that it wasn’t the dark you should be afraid of, it was the light. That seeing horror could be even worse than not.
Harry was sitting in the hallway on his suitcase, patiently waiting for his godfather and trying to drown out the excessive whining of Vernon and Petunia who were speculating about what this man would look like. Their gossip was put on hold, however, by the sound of an engine revving outside. Harry slammed the door open and gasped at the glorious sight of his Pads on the motorcycle, taking off his helmet.
Draco and Harry were considerably more excited when the next Hogsmeade trip rolled around, even more so when they knew they were going to be joined by Ron and Hermione.
“My friendly, card-carrying cupids!” Lockhart beamed. He continued to explain that the creatures would be wandering around the school, delivering Valentines through the means of song, and cards if you so chose. Harry glanced at Draco, whose excitement had dimmed slightly.
How Harry was managing to get through his exams was a mystery to everyone. He didn’t study like Hermione and Draco, he didn’t buckle down at the last minute, like Ron. But he was fixated on the mystery of the Philosopher’s Stone. One day, he was struck with an idea and dragged Ron, Hermione and Draco to Hagrid’s hut.
So the boys ducked under the invisibility cloak, once again, and tiptoed into the Hospital Wing, only to find the girl herself, rigid and still, holding a mirror in one hand and a balled up piece of paper in the other. With trembling hands, Draco reached out and pried it from her fingers, flattening it out against the bed.
He nearly cried, then. “Please don’t, Harry. You’re too important to me.” Draco couldn’t imagine his life without the stupid boy sat in front of him.
So Harry rushed Draco to the forest and they entered through the back. The second they were far enough in that the sun was weak through the trees, Draco pretty much exploded.
“TROLL… IN THE DUNGEON! TROLL IN THE DUNGEON!!” He stopped abruptly and paled. “Just thought you should know.” And then promptly fainted. The hall was sent into chaos, but Dumbledore put everyone in order, commanding prefects to take the houses to their dormitories, even the Slytherins.
Maeve giggled quietly at her blonde friends affronted expression, taking a small bite of her treacle tart. She ate her tomato soup silently, remembering how Draco said vegetables were able to help her grow strong and practically forcing her to eat them regularly. "I think it's sweet he cares so much." She teased with a small grin.
"You say I'll receive the letter tomorrow?" She asked, wanting to make sure. She continued when her relatives nodded, "Alright, make sure I get that letter as soon as it gets here. I'll be heading to bed, I suggest you two do the same. We have a big day tomorrow." She smirked, walking away. Her room was at the end of the hall, away from the loud, obnoxious snoring. Thank goodness for that.
"Malfoy, would you be alright sending a letter to your father on my behalf? I'd very much like to request your father as my step in, if he is willing. Because, regardless of just meeting you, there is none I'd trust more than you." She paused at that, looking him in the eyes. "You'd do well not to betray my graciously gifted trust. Do you think your father would accept?"
Another item she’d need when working with Cauldrons that were sure to get dirty while making potions. She placed that in as well. With that she walked up front to request a First year Potion-Making Kit and a Potion Kit Bag, she’d rather have both to get more on what the subject would entail then to wait and embarrass herself in a new environment.
Maeve watched them with a small smile. "You both wouldn't mind? This seems like a personal thing, we could meet somewhere else. I don't mind."
Vernon and Petunia watched in trepidation. They were glad Dudley was napping before dinner, but anxiety clawed at them, what was she going to do to Marge? They were told to sit down and enjoy the show, not having much choice, they did as told.
The Tom fellow guided her to a brick wall, which she looked dumbly at. Was this man joking? What is a plain wall going to do.
) was a potion which removed boils. If the potion was made successfully, there would be pink smoke rising from the cauldron.
Their eyes widened at the sight, a solid pure gold oval shaped locket rested against her palm. The green jeweled serpentine 'S' glinting beautifully in the sunlight, it matched perfectly with her stunning eyes.
He pursed his lips, obviously he was not fond of the way she spoke to him but she had no will in her to care as he was not worth her time. “May I have your name?”
Gripping his chin and forcing him to look up at her, green eyes glaring at his whimpering form. "Never think you can get rid of me, only I decide when to go. Remember, from this day on, I own you." She hissed viciously. "Do you understand now?" He nodded fearfully, tears pooling at the edge of his eyes. "Good, clean yourself up. Petunia will drive you to the emergency room, if they ask, you were fixing the roof and had an unfortunate accident."
As stated during your inheritance test, you are heiress to Slytherin and as this locket once belonged to Salazar Slytherin, it is in your right to own it. Be warned, it is very valuable as there is something connected to it that would aid you greatly on the path you choose. Take great care of it.
She looked over her shoulder. "My proxy is Lord Lucius Malfoy, I'm sure you've heard of him. Have a nice evening." and then she walked out.
"Yes." She replied rolling her eyes. She heard her aunt walking away before finally getting up to get ready for the day. She had a whole plan to set in motion.
"I'm Remus Lupin, your parents best friend. And yes, you should not have been placed with the Dursleys. Your mother had forbade it from happening, considering neither sister had ever gotten along."
"Is that so? Well, correct me if I'm wrong professor, but you were the one scolding two students who did nothing wrong because of the house they were sorted into. And you ignored the students who were causing a ruckus because why? Oh, because they weren't Slytherin. You're prejudiced, professor, but I'm sure you knew that already." Her response silenced the professors, they had no way to retort because anything they say could go against them.
"I apologize as I cannot say much more at the moment. Perhaps we can speak more at another time. Til then I bid you a good day." The voices vanished and only the words remained. "May you please lead me to the library now? I have much to do and I've already wasted ten minutes of my lunch break just speaking to a map."
The young girls eyes twinkled in fascination, there was a world out there with people just like her! She tilted her head in thought, no. That wouldn't do, there could only be one Maeve. Perhaps she could analyze everything before she made a move, she'll wait and see, then she'll figure out the most appropriate way to take over the magical world. After all everyone needs a leader.
"The books I received, I had them sent to my dorm for when we head to the library later. And mother wrote a letter stating father would get back to you later this evening as he was called in early for work and wasn't able to respond." Draco replied as he swallowed down his orange juice.
Tightened her sleeves around Loki, she didn't want him getting irritated. "Weasleys, these questions better be interesting or so help me I'll make you both regret asking me to meet you early in the bloody morning." She hissed angrily, glaring at them darkly. Though to the Gryffindors, she looked about as terrifying as a wet kitten. The cold didn't help her in looking scary.
She tapped her foot quietly against the pavement as she impatiently waited for the bus to arrive. Her watch said it was five minutes late, and she was growing irritated by the second. Finally, just as her patience was burning through the roof, it arrived.
"Sirius Black has been falsely charged with the deaths of Lily and James Potter along with twelve muggles. He'll be sent to St. Mungos to have his health administered, and the ministry will provide fifty thousand galleons for each year he spent in Azkaban. We will have a search sent for Peter Pettigrew. Case dismissed."
" Looks like Professor Snape is handing out the schedules now." Malfoy nudged her, Maeve saw the bloke starting with the older students first. Most likely going down the years, looks like they'll be the last ones.
She walked in, the first thing she noticed was that the goblins were nearly a head shorter then her, it obviously meant she had to start drinking more milk. Maeve walked up to the first goblin she saw, which happened to be sharpening a sword. The look on its eyes had her lifting an eye brow.
Petunia turned her head,refusing to look the demonic child in the eyes. She knew her kind weren't good. She didn't seem to realize that she and her family helped create the monster that sat in front of them.
He shook his head, with a wave of his hand. "Ah, sorry. I was just thinking about our first classes. We get our schedule today, right?"
After dinner, the prefects were called to the headmasters office along with their head of houses. The other students were dismissed to their common rooms. Maeve shared a confused look with her boys as they walked down to the dungeons.
Loki watched as his human smiled widely, amusement clear in her toxic green eyes. The reaction he could only assume a good outcome.
"Bravo, Miss Potter! Five points to Slytherin!" Flitwick exclaimed, beaming proudly for his star pupil. "Now, everyone! You'll all only do the hand movements, refrain from saying the charm until I call you on you please. I'd like to make sure you all can do it or if anyone needs any help."
Maeve smirked, her aunt couldn't cook. It's always been her job. One of the many things that drove her aunt crazy, was how she did everything perfect. It infuriated Petunia, it made the hits she gave her niece all the more pleasant.
Maeve got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Malfoy and Zabini behind her, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
Zabini took a while to think, Potter was an enigma. He vowed to figure her out. "Most likely, she played the innocent card perfectly. But at least we know to avoid the topic of her family."
"Enter." A voice sounding like gravel called from inside. Griphook pushed open the door, he made it look so easy but Maeve knew if she tried she would surely injure herself.
In little over thirty minutes, she had breakfast made. She only served one plate and that was for her, two nicely baked pancakes, a few fried pieces of bacon and a perfectly made omlet. Aunt Petunia hadn't come downstairs yet, meaning she was still waking, or trying to wake up Dudley. Her cousin could sleep through an earthquake and barely twitch.
"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting."
"Mhm, they're quite brilliant and I'm very proud to say they are on my side." She had a smug look on her pretty face. "They know a winning side and have chosen wisely."
"With all due respect, professor, but how are you to get after them when they were merely pulling out writing utensils? Surely, you'd much rather scold those four ladies over in the corner for being much too loud. Or shall we not write what we learn?" The four girls blushed in embarrassment but Maeve paid them no mind as she wasn't going to allow such obtrusive disrespect to go unchallenged. Magical folks had no discreet bone in their bodies with all the obvious dislike they show.
She pondered a way to answer that, can she give him her real name? Would it matter? considering they were already dead? "Maeve Potter." She decided to just reveal it, not like it could change anything in her timeline.
She pursed her lips as she took his outstretched hand and gave it a delicate shake. "You as well, Lord Malfoy." A pleasant smile on her beautiful face.
Just as Maeve was going to retort the doorbell rang. Indicating someone had arrived, that someone being Marge. Vivid green eyes glared at the cheering snake. She knew he won this round, but she'll succeed next time.
The walk back to the common room was uneventful, the hallways in the dungeons were unnecessarily cold. Why on earth would they keep the temperature freezing? Who in their right minds would want to freeze to death? A blithering idiot, that's who!
Maeve pulled out her notebook, in which she wrote her thoughts in. She grabbed her favorite dark ink pen and began to write.
MAEVE ALARICA POTTER WAS RAISED to believe she was nothing more than an unwanted burden. The night she was left on the doorsteps of her relative, she was immediately placed in the cupboard underneath the stairs which would be her room.
She let out an undignified squeak as she was pulled into a tight hug by both men. Affectionate touches were still a foreign concept for her so she stood awkwardly and patted their lower backs gently. She heaved a sigh of relief when she could breathe again.
There was a brief pause of just silence before James Potter, her late father, spoke. "Did you say Potter?"
They all nodded and with a hum of satisfaction, Maeve turned and led them to their next class. As they reached the class, the students immediately paused and allowed Maeve and her friends in first, the tabby cat sitting upon the desk watched curiously as that happened. She wondered what Potter had done to earn such apparent respect, Minerva quickly assumed that the young girl had used her fame and as such it painted a bad picture in her mind.
A sadistic smile crawled on her pale face, she hoped the large, foolish woman tried to hit her with that insufferable cane. Just like with the Dursleys, Maeve would love to set that wrench, Marge straight, show her who is truly in charge.
Blaise rolled his neck and gave a half shrug. "I don't mind working with him, he's already taking the class so it's obvious he'd know plenty and would be able to pass off some of his knowledge."
"Well alright." She merely said before leaving the odd child alone. She could still feel her gaze on her back, watching her walk away. It sent chills down her back.
"I knew you were an idiot, but to think you'd actually try to lay a hand on me when I've clearly stated I was and always will be stronger than you." She sneered in disgust, "Apparently it didn't go very far in that thick head of yours, so now you must understand that I've got to punish you. Because you trying to harm me will not be tolerated." She turned to her shaking aunt and ordered her to leave.
Flitwick smiled as he finally had everyone clean up their surroundings before dismissing them with the promise of more exciting lessons to come.
Quirrell cleared his throat. "If I m-may have your a-a-attention, p-please." He hated having to fake a stutter, but he needed the other professors to continue to assume he was weak. "I'll b-be do-doing roll call n-now."
When the professor dismissed them, she let out a sound of disbelief. The first years centered themselves around the quadruple of children, as though creating a protection shield. And the four didn't even look surprised or bothered by it. They seemed to acknowledge it and accept it.
"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts. Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned." McGonagall began. Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. The Hufflepuffs murmured among each other, very impressed and couldn't wait to get started.
She folded the paper up and placed it away before looking at her newly gifted owl. "I'll name you Samael, do you like the sound of that? My little prince of darkness." The owl hooted quietly while gently rubbing his small head against her temple. She giggled, scratching his head softly. "Oh, Draco have you sent your father what I've written already?"
Dudley got a trolley, while Vernon opened the trunk and got out her case. Placing her things neatly on the trolley, they all walked into the crowded train station. 9 3/4 wouldn't be able to be seen by these parasites, Maeve concluded, Petunia would have to know how, if my mother was a witch.
Vernon pulled up front and unlocked the doors. "We're here." He grunted. Maeve refocused, she nodded stepping out.
A few hands rose up but Maeve's remained down, she wanted to give her little serpents a chance to earn some points. Tracey Davis was chosen to answer but before she could say a word, the door was opened quite rudely. Maeve curled her lips in a sneer when Parkinson decided to grace the class with her pathetic presence, how dare this excuse for a witch disobey her words?
"Well, I'm finished eating, so I think I'll be heading in early again. The sooner class can start, the quicker it can finish." She declared as she stood and grabbed her things to head to class. Her three friends got up as well, not like anything interesting was going on in the Great Hall anyways.
The pale boy flushed, he still hadn't gotten used to the nickname and he doubted he would. "Of course, love." He turned to the Weasley's and raised a brow. "Do you think McGonagall plans on telling your mother?"
Draco will have to hear about the way Dumbledore tried to wave away her nonexistent problems, if they had been real then she would have reigned hell upon earth. Once the others knew, then surely it would get back to their parents who had more involvement in the ministry, the old gaffer had a storm heading it's way and it won't be the pleasant kind.
"The bloke that was glaring at me at last nights welcoming feast? You mean to tell me, I'm stuck with you two wankers and that bloody tosser? I'm going to need a cuppa in order to survive this year." Zabini rolled his eyes with a smirk at her dramatic antics.
We have news regarding your request. Just as you asked, we've let minister Fudge know that a trial for Sirius Black is to be held to determine whether or not an innocent man has been wrongly incarcerated. We made sure he understood that if no trial was scheduled that you, Ms. Potter was going to hold an interview with reporters and let everyone know how he let the savior of the wizarding world live among muggles with no idea how she was faring. How you'd reveal that your only living relative was imprisoned with no trial. He spoke with madam bones and has determined the scheduled date for court will be two days from now at twelve forty-five. We already mailed Dumbledore, letting him know you won't be able to attend classes as you'll be at a court trial. I must tell you that he tried to deny you the rights to leave. But as you are a Lady, he cannot physically stop you. I also would like to give you the Great horned owl as a thank you gesture for initiating this partnership. He is for you to name. Have a good evening and we hope to hear from you soon.
Hagrid led them to the huge double doors of Hogwarts. Lifting a large fist, he pounded on it there times. The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Maeve's first thought was that this was not someone to cross.
"Alright, enough Draco, there is no need to insult the twins as they clearly have more intelligence than their younger brother at least. Now, twins follow us, we're heading to the our little spot in the library." She gave them no time to complain as she led the way.
Sirius let go but continued holding his hand. It was so nice. The comforting breeze. All of it. That was until Draco caught a slight glimpse of platinum blonde ducking behind an old cottage.
Everyone carried on talking for a long time, there was a lot to process. But it finally ended when Harry and Draco’s stomachs started rumbling and the time for the feast had arrived. They said their goodbyes and made their way to the door, but it slammed open before they could reach it, revealing two stocky wizards, who greatly resembled Crabbe and Goyle, and a tiny elf.
Hmm," said a small voice in her ear.  "Difficult. Very difficult. Not a bad mind. Very intelligent. There's talent, and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting.... Cunning and manipulative, I see. There is only one place that can help you sharpen your talents and make you great...
Maeve glanced behind her at her confused friends, how was she to answer them? "Perhaps later? Dinner is about to start and I am awaiting a letter from an associate. Do you mind waiting for the answers to whatever questions you have?" She had heard that mail usually came during breakfast and dinner, she really didn't want to miss if the goblins replied to her inquiries.
"Miss Parkinson, thank you for finally joining. You will be attending detention for two days. Have a seat. Now, Miss Davis, if-"
She pursed her lips slightly. Today was the 31st of July, was the invitation still valid? She looked up and stared at the owl that peered back at her.
After all, a capable wizard would not have been incapacitated so easily by a mere child. Granted the child would be her, but one should never underestimate their enemy.
The room temperature fell dangerously low, and the fire dissipated. Maeve's green eyes glowed as her face hardened, she seemed capable of glaring someone frozen with her eerie eyes. "I see," Her voice caused others to flinch, it was ice cold. "You seem to be under the impression that blood means power, but I'm afraid you're mistaken."
Just before they reached the library, Maeve stopped them. "I'd like to believe that we are friends and as such I wish for you three to please refer to me as Maeve." She gave them a soft smile that had them short circuiting for a few seconds
Minerva knew this child was nothing like her parents, the obvious being she was not a Gryffindor. The second being, she had far darker intent lurking in her beautiful green orbs. Eyes so different from her mothers and so eerily similar to the killing curse. Something was off with that Potter girl, and Minerva was willing to find out what it was.
The three boys choked on their food at the casual way she mentioned it, as though commenting on the weather. "I'm sorry, your godfather will be receiving a trial? So late into him being locked up?" Blaise asked. She nodded, it was weird to her as to why he never received a proper trial but knowing Dumbledore, he probably had an ulterior motive.
The clothes did nothing to help her cool down underneath the burning sun, as they once belonged to her overweight cousin and thus were hanging loosely over her thin, small frame. Luckily her long, curly hair that usually fell below her shoulder blades, was pulled into a tight messy ponytail with a makeshift hair-tie. Her eyes narrowed as she pulled the last of the weeds.
Neville nodded. "The twins have a good idea and the highest grade I'd probably get would be in Herbology. I know my way around plants."
"I'm sorry, my dear girl. But I'm afraid you must continue living with them. The blood you share with your aunt protects you from the dark lord. It's in your best interest if you remain with them."
He grunted before answering. "There is an inheritance test, after the blood just ask Slivertooth for the second part." He replied, glancing at her for a moment. "It'll provide the information of all your family tree, distant relatives and who you are heiress to."
"How is it that a bloke in an enchanted parchment paper knows more of respect then the bloody twit you have for a brother?" She glanced at the Weasley twins who were strangely quiet during the whole conversation.
Maeve grew a sour expression, just thinking about what had occured in the headmasters office annoyed her greatly. The old fool was willing to allow a possible victim of abuse to stay in the abusive environment, even if she wasn't truly being abused. The fact that he would have even allowed it had Maeve wanting to wring his neck right then and there.
Maeve merely shrugged, she knew exactly who was who as she had already identified the difference in their appearances. "Alright, would you like me to turn around as well?" She had already closed her eyes and turned even without their answer.
Maeve got the feeling the angry, little creature despised helping humans. She didn't blame him, some of them were disgusting parasites. "Close your eyes and take deep breaths, this procedure will most likely hurt. Try to stay still." His voice was gruff and raspy.
Quickly he set the egg down and grasped his hand to his chest. When the pain faded, he looked and saw red lines swirling around his palm. Braxton had no clue what had just occurred, but deep inside he knew that whatever this egg was, now belonged to him.
"Well, it's lunch hour so I stopped by my dorm room to write a letter. Now, I am heading to my next period. I would like to be punctual, if you don't mind, professor." She flashed him her charming smile hoping to delude him of any suspicion.
"How long do you think it would take to get someone removed?" She asked quietly, Malfoy picked his head up from where it was leaning on his palm and looked at her. Pale blue eyes stared at passive green ones, he bit his lip and thought back to his fathers conversations.
Uncle Vernon hauled her case into the trunk and placed Loki's cage in between Dudley and herself. She cracked a smirk at her squirming cousin, her serpent merely lazily hissed at him.
She nodded, she was pretty sure it was with Gryffindors. "Yes, herbology and then DADA. Oh, I don't believe I've told you but in two days from now I will be missing classes as I will be attending a court trial for my godfather, Sirius Black."
Maeve stood in the back of the line, a little further away from the other students. As they reached their section , she noticed one of the few parents there was Petunia Dursley. She pushed her way to the front as she wanted to be in hearing distance.
"Professor Snape was said to be passing them out after breakfast." Zabini responded, a flicker of amusement in his dark eyes as he stared at his two companions.
Maeve smiled to herself, she's about to ruin their lives. -Yes, I'll make breakfast and then I'll serve you the new rules.- She pulled out the griddle and began cooking the bacon and baking the pancakes. Taking out the frying pan, she began making egg omlets. -I'll make breakfast fit for a queen.-  She hummed quietly to herself, cooking was an easy achievement.
“Have a wonderful day, sir.” She smiled and walked out. Yes, she quite liked the way others looked at her as if she were a goddess, someone worth worshipping. It was something she could get used to.
She stepped out the stall once she was fully dressed, the tie was a bother to put on so she left it hanging loosely around her neck. There were no rules stating she had to have it on properly, just as long as it was on. Maeve glanced at her reflection, she pulled off her hair tie to braid it out of her face. She left two strands of curls to frame her face.
Mave walked down the stairs, Loki by her side as per usual. The house was quiet, the Dursleys were out for the day. They were buying Dudley a handsome suit as Marge was coming over.
An uneasy silence fluttered through the nearly empty corridor, no teacher in sight and no witnesses. Maeve smiled sharply, slightly pointed canines glinting as her toxic eyes glowed maliciously. "Good, wouldn't want any unfortunate accidents on the first day, would we? It'd be a shame for a trip to the infirmary on such a lovely day."
The boys stayed quiet, they were going to allow Maeve to explain. She was better at speaking than them. "Pardon us, Madame. We have been arriving early to our classes since yesterday. We believe being punctual is always better than being late. Wouldn't you agree?" A pleasant smile curled at her lips.
"Mrs. Dursley, may I just say something. I find you sons behavior and academics to be absolutely deplorable," Petunia's smile dropped and her eyes narrowed but before she could say anything, Mrs. Colt continued speaking. "I feel as though you lack the ability to properly raise a child. As your son is completely despicable, I fear he may never grow to amount to anything. For his grades are horrible and his attitude may very well get him into serious trouble all because he lacks discipline. And for goodness sake put your child on a diet. The boy is too large for his age!" Mrs. Colt ended her rant with a smile and a polite, "have a good day."
"Interesting." He whispered, but decided not to answer and went about his planned lesson. He did keep his eyes on the young girl, she was proving to be a valuable asset. Maybe she could partner with him. Maybe.
Zabini had been the one to answer. "My mother had said they place this old tattered hat on your head and he shifts through your mind before deciding what house you'll belong in."
The fair haired boy swallowed down the lump in his throat, he had heard the subtly hidden threat in her voice. He wouldn't dare cross her but even thinking of it sent shivers down his spine, the thought of her inciting a confrontation and winning terrified him as much as it excited him. A light pink blush dusted his pale cheeks at his thoughts, he averted eye contact. "I'd be more than willing to send a letter to him for you, and I believe he'd accept wholeheartedly to help you. More so, if I throw in the fact that you are a good friend of mine."
Flitwick remained outside a little longer as he waited for more students to arrive, Maeve watched as more of her snakes entered. She nodded approvingly at them, it was good they all heeded her warning and arrived on time. She narrowed her eyes as she looked around the classroom, Parkinson wasn't present. The green eyed girl sighed, she'd been hoping that immediate obedience would have followed but it seemed like she had someone to punish. And this time, Pansy Parkinson would be made an example of what will happen if anyone else dares to disobey Maeve Potter.
It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.
The smile on her face grew a tad darker, she would make them see her ways. Loki hissed in agreement, she pet his head gently, he was always so kind to her. He deserved the world.
She made her way to the back and sat down with Draco beside her and Theo and Blaise at the table next to theirs. The others sat around them or just close by. Gryffindors will have their own space, and wouldn't want them to contaminate their air. Don't know what sort of diseases they have.
She turned around and her eyes widened as the ginger twins ran up to her, stopping before they could collide. "Yes?' She tilted her head sideways, giving the impression of a confused puppy. She blinked slowly as the twins froze momentarily.
Please enjoy this chapter even though it really wasn't my best. I'd say this was more of a filler than a full out chapter.
Full lips curled in a sweet smile as she pet her familiar, always such a good boy. He'd never betray her, one of the few she knew would stay by her side. And she'll keep it that way.
Maeve was so exhausted that when they finally made to the dungeons, she was ready to drop. They made it to the common room, she tuned out the two older teens as they explained the rules and giving advice. She tried hard to stay standing on her feet.
"We have astrology tonight, I think we should at least get some sleep before that class. So we'll only meet for maybe an hour, discuss plans and add some ideas. Does that sound good?" Maeve asked, looking at each of her friends.
"Of course, love. Why wouldn't we miss our dear Lady?" Blaise smirked, dark eyes glinted attractively from the low lighting provided by the still lit fireplace. A faint blush lightly dusted her cheekbones and the bridge of her nose. She rolled her eyes playfully and gestured for them to hurry along and follow her so they could head to History of Magic.
Draco and Blaise exchanged looks, Theo was staring entranced by the green eyes beauty. She was making a scene, causing people to think. But was that a good thing or bad thing? Especially at a time like this. It wouldn't matter of course, they'd still follow her.
Petunia shook her head nervously, fearful her niece would strike out. But she watched in bewilderment as the young girl merely smiled and stated that there was still time left. Petunia was left in a stump, Maeve  was acting strange. Was it because of the letter that was coming that would tell her about her world?
Only a few students were seated across the common room, speaking quietly among each other. A curious glance was occasionally thrown at her as she sat down by the fireplace, the warmth always soothes her. The boys were most likely in their dorm room, she'd wait for them where she sat as she didn't want to head to her dorm where those annoying chattering bimbos rested. She'd rather eat slugs than be around Parkinson, the obnoxious girl hadn't even apologized for insulting her.
Slowly, realization dawned upon them and they let themselves smirk. "We'd be in control, no one can stop us. Not Voldemort, not the ministry of magic, and especially not Dumbledore. We'll be unstoppable, we'd rule as we please." She giggled ecstatic. "They'll have no other option but to listen or suffer the consequences."
"Yes, it's quite true. Though, I hated every moment of it. Muggles act more like animals than people, especially the ones I lived with." She paused and allowed a small smirk upon her lips. "Well, only until I showed them their place. After all, I'm daughter of the noble and ancient house of Potter, we bow down to no one."
Nodding at her appearance, she walked back out to the kitchen. The Dursleys went about their normal routine, carefully treading around Maeve, who seemed in a chirpy mood. They didn't want to destroy the peace.
Loki tilted his head in confusion, but didn't say anything else as his Mistress began getting ready for bed. She changed into a large plain white shirt and small pink shorts. She then threw her thick curly mane into a messy bun and shuffled into bed, wrapping her soft, warm blanket around her. Loki nuzzled in beside her, enjoying the warmth his human gave off.
Maeve nodded, it would be best to get away from prying ears. Never could be sure who was on your side or not. "Let's head to the library, we could be there until dinner since we only have one class left and that won't be until late tonight." She turned and walked out the common room, her boys following close behind her.
Marge might have been a slow oaf but she knew when she was being taunted, and right now her brothers oddity of a niece was trying to rile her up. It was working. The abdominous woman scrunched up her face in disgust. She really didn't understand why Vernon and Petunia kept the girl, she would have gotten rid of the thing.
Murmurs began filling the room as they began to realize they might have imprisoned an innocent man. "Were you the secret keeper for the Potters?"
She recognized the name from the letter Minerva had sent her. She had claimed the man before would her enter Diagon Alley. So, putting on her most innocent and childish smile she greeted the man.
The class was quiet as they read, only the sound of pages turning or quills moving as some were also taking notes. Maeve was one of the few who didn't bother taking any as she had a perfect memory and could remember just about anything. They had lunch after this and all she really wanted to do was make a big enough scene to ensure she had everyone's attention and then just go to the library. Hogwarts library had to have been magnificent, so many books to read about all the magic that has been here for centuries, perhaps even longer.
Mrs. Colt was unnerved by the intensity of the young girls emerald eyes. Her face was void of any expression and even her tone of voice lacked any emotion. It was odd for a 6 year old.
Just when she felt she were to black out, the pain stopped. She was still gasping, trying to fill her lungs with much needed air. Once she was able to gain some of her awareness, she realized she felt much lighter.
Malfoy led them to the assigned court room where it was crowded with men and women who spoke quietly amongst each other. She glanced around the room with her sharp green eyes, one man in particular stood out. Tall and lanky with chocolate brown hair and scars scattered across his face, he seemed to be nervous, fidgeting in his seat.
"Good, now let's head to the Great Hall. I don't know about you two but I'm starving." Maeve stood up and dusted her skirt off. Loki hissed in agreement with her statement. She gently patted her sleeve where he was hidden.
"Well, come help me. The sooner I'm in there, the faster you all can leave." She said, all three hurriedly got out. Maeve grabbed Loki's cafe, as the snake would be complaining if someone else were to get grab him.
"Oi, sod off and pass me a biscuit will you?" Maeve cackled at Malfoy's pouty face, she leaned over and patted his cheek in a teasing way. He pulled away with a huff and crossed his arms.
He sat on his legs as he reached his hands out and gently grabbed it. He hissed as a sharp pain stung his right palm. Braxton watched in awe as the egg glowed brightly, he suddenly had to hold in a scream as his right hand felt as though lit on fire.
She began humming as she dried her hair and wrapped it in another towel, while letting her body dry from beneath the towel, she grabbed her toothbrush with a thin line of toothpaste and began brushing her teeth. Followed by washing her face with her soothing and hydrating face soap and cleanser. Patting down the remaining droplets of water, she then began clipping on her bra and pulling up her underwear. Rubbing in lotion before getting her skirt hiked up to her waist and button her shirt and tucking it in. Leaving the tie hanging loosely around her and brushing through her knotted hair and leaving it down.
Loki continued to watch from the sidelines, humor in his slit pale eyes. His human was most interesting. He slithered out from his hiding place and towards Maeve.
"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.
After reading the entire passage twice and making sure nothing was missed, Maeve closed the book and placed it at the corner of her desk.
Fred let out a chuckle. "He always asks that even after we had this map since our first year. Greatest pranksters to ever walk these halls."
Loki watched his human become lost while staring out the glass pane. Tongue flickering out every now and then catching a taste of her magic. He slid on the large smooth rock placed in his cage.
She nodded as Theo and Blaise leaned closer,  Draco's nimble fingers gently grabbed it,  examining it closely. "It's beautiful." Theo whispered. They all looked entranced.
§Tell me Loki, would going there be a missstake? I already have full control over here, what if sssomething goes? What would I do?§
"So love, what was it you needed to discuss?" Blaise asked, recalling the conversation they had had before class.
The voice sounded oddly familiar. "Messrs Prongs would like to know exactly it is you need and how you came upon such a clever map?" She raised a brow at that, modest much?
"If not, you're more than welcome to stay at my manor. Mother would be delighted to have another female in the house, and father would love to have another thing added to the list that proves Dumbledore's incompetence." Draco said, smiling warmly at the agitated girl, she returned a small one back.
"I shall return when we are ready for you," said Professor McGonagall. "Please wait quietly." She left the chamber.
As she was heading towards the seeming invisible pub, she saw a large man standing in the middle of the sidewalk. Strangers giving him side glances but not really looking, the made room to walk around him as well. He seemed to be looking for somebody.
She shouldered passed him and closed the door in his face. Malfoy watched as she huffed before sitting down, looking just as angry as he felt.She gently rubbed her hands along the scales of her rather beautiful snake. His face grew slightly pink as he recalled how she stood up to Weasley, and the fact that she didn't seem to care about how said Weasley claimed him to be a death eater,
Throwing the duvet off both of them, immediately goosebumps appeared on her skin as the cold air hit her. Sometimes, she hated the dungeon common rooms because of the lack of warmth. Nothing a warm shower couldn't help, so she supposes she can't complain all that much.
As they entered Ms. Pince gave the Weasley twins a suspicious glare, it was better than glaring at the Slytherins so they didn't care. They walked to the back area where a large table sat and the light flickered as though it were about to turn off.
The blonde boy jumped, startled at being singled out by the terrifying first year. "It's about one thirty." He replied, keeping his voice steady and polite, he wouldn't want to anger the girl after the scene with Flint yesterday morning.
She quite liked the idea to antidote for common poisons, it may very well come in handy one day. It didn't appear very expensive either, neither was the Anti-Paralysis Potion, she would like to purchase both. Maeve placed both items in the small basket she picked up at the front.
Maeve turned her head, curls bouncing on her shoulders she gazed out the window. Where was this letter? Had her aunt lied to her? No, she wouldn't endanger her life like that. Was someone bringing the letter?
She grabbed an apple as she stared out the kitchen window. Perhaps life would become much better wherever she was going, she would see to it that it is. Loki slithered into her lap, hissing for attention.
She ran out the room and wandered the hallways hoping to find her boys before she grew tired. Just as she turned the corner, she bumped into someone. "Oh, I'm so sorry, professor." She apologized as she saw Quirrell stumble slightly.
"I'll call in a healer to remove them and I'd like to request you get that horcrux removed. It'd be extremely dangerous to keep it." He waited for her to agree before continuing. "Griphook could inform you of Mr. Morningstar and show you to your vaults."
The twinkle in his eyes grew dim and his smile strained, she could see where his jaw clenched in hidden fury. "I see, suppose that's good. And your grades? I take it you've been doing well in your studies?"
Maeve began shuffling around her trunk to find a suitable outfit. She picked an emerald colored knee length dress with a pair of black flats. Grabbing a pair of undergarments, she headed to the restroom to shower. Doing her morning routine as quickly as possible and getting dressed so she could wait for the ministry person that was going to be picking her up.
"No, I hadn't realized that Sirius Black was this supposed traitor. When I read his name on my inheritance papers, I assumed nothing wrong. That was my first mistake, I should've asked why he was absent in my life." Maeve twirled a dark curl around her index finger and bit her lower lip in thought. "I believed for a long time that I had no living
She casted her eyes down and jutted out her bottom lip, the kick puppy look she perfected over the years becoming of use at this very moment. When she looked back up at them, she made sure her green eyes looked bigger and were wet with unshed tears. "Please, Fred and George, talk to your father. Don't let them send me back." She pleaded.
Albus Dumbledore, for as much as he was praised for being wise beyond his years, was but just a man. And man makes mistakes. The most fatal mistake he will ever make is believing that Maeve will grow up weak and scared so that she would look to him as her savior when he undoubtedly taker her from the cruel Dursleys and assuming she would be nothing more than a pawn he could use to defeat Voldemort and then take the credit. His mistakes would be his undoings.
"No need to be miffed, you wouldn't want to lose the plot, now would you?" Maeve playfully scolded as she nicked some grapes off his plate.
Mrs. Colt clapped her hands, gaining everyone's attention. "Alright students, we have to move on. So place the short stories away and you can continue that at home or simply wait till tomorrow as I have said you have all summer to work on it. But now we are going to work on math, nothing hard. Just addition and subtraction." She walked in front of the chalk board. "Go to your assigned cubbies and grab your math books please." She instructed.
The ominous feeling that surrounded the students and wrapped itself around their cores left them unsettled, especially since the smile that soon followed bear such deceiving innocence. They continued their walk to class at a much subdued pace, the atmosphere much to tense tho bring back the excitement. Malfoy, Zabini, and Nott all shared smiles at each other, they knew following Potter would benefit them greatly. And if she happened to be the next Dark Lady, well, at least she had greatness paved in concrete.
~Ssshould anyone step out of line, do what you do bessst. Punisssh them. You ssshall ssstick to yourssself like you planned, becaussse sssooner or later they will obey your command.~
Vernon still couldn't talk, but he did glare defiantly at his atrocious niece. He'd put her in her place as soon as she lets them go. Just she wait.
"I don't mind working with him either. It'll be good to bounce off what we know and be able to find out more together." Cedric agreed, before looking at Neville. "And since you also like Herbology, I can talk to professor Sprout and see if she can tutor you privately. She liked helping students so I doubt she'd disagree."
Maeve figured the bookstore could be last since she would likely spend a small fortune buying all the appropriate items to get her ready for her life in the Magical world. With that decision made, Maeve searched for clothing that would allow her to fit in properly. Twilfitt and Tatting’s was a shop much like Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions except she had seen women exit nicely dressed, from that Maeve deduced that Twilfitt and Tatting’s had a more standing with the wealthy and the dark haired girl wanted nothing but the best. With that in mind, she made her way towards the beautiful building.
Her birthday was next month she would finally be seven years old, she had to wait just a little longer. St. Grogory's primary school was not too far. She detested the school and all its staff. They were all incompetent fools.
Sorry for the wait but I wasn't feeling good mentally and the load of work for my classes have really been dragging me down. But I'm back and I'm not great but I'm feeling much better. Potions is finally coming up so keep a look out for that.
"Alright, you," she pointed to the brunette one. "I want you to jump up on one foot. And you," Pointing at the blonde. "If she falters, you are going to beat her till I tell you to stop. Begin!" Maeve watched in amusement as the brunette begin to grow exhausted, struggling to keep jumping.
It was no point in even trying to ask her aunt for a drink, the lowlife would likely refuse and then send her to her room, or well cupboard. She glanced around the garden, it looked well enough. But just in case, she subtly lifted her palm up and with a bit of her energy she gave life to the flowers.
"Malfoy?" The boy seemed to be lost in thought, so she simply say beside him. He'll notice her when he wakes from his daydream.
"Ah, little Dracy-poo, not just any parchment paper. An enchanted map had graced us it's magical help when we were but little ickle firsties such as yourself. Now we bestow it to our majesty, queen Maeve." George declared, proudly handing it over to the girl in question with a bow of his head. Draco scowled at his new horrid nickname.
The blue eyed boy stuck his hand out, with confidence. "Names Theodore Nott, I'd like to offer my loyalty to whatever you do," he smirked. "Milady." The name was only befitting for a woman fighting for her beliefs.
"Go around kid, can't you see adults are talking?" She said, her friend snickering. Maeve narrowed her eyes, lips pursing. "I see." She whispered coldly, the two girls girls tensed as a dark feeling over came their senses. "Follow me." She ordered, turning sharply knowing those two parasites were behind her, obeying like good dogs.
The boy glanced in her direction, a bored indifference expression on his face. His pale blue eyes widen slightly before he regained composure. "Yes?" He had a soothing voice, pleasing to the ear.
That night, after she returned home from shopping, she replayed the words of Griphook over and over in her head again. She looked up what it meant to have angel blood in you and couldn't believe it.
"If you remember, the witch Levina Monkstanley invented the Wand-Lighting Charm in the eighteenth century just as she created the Wand-Extinguishing Charm. Does anyone know what language Nox is and where it is derived from?"
The three boys stared at the furious dark haired girl, amazed and impressed. Malfoy regained his bearings first. "What are we to do about it? No one will listen to children."
Fred smiled cheekily as he and George blushed. "Really, now? Don't fall in love with us now, fair maiden."
Snape finally made it to their area. In his pale hands, he held three sheets of papers. "Zabini--Malfoy-- and Potter." She frowned as he practically sneered her name, laced in venom.
He stumbled over a fallen branch, landing on his knees. Braxton gasped in slight pain as his hands collided on something sharp. He slowly picked himself up, only stop as he gazed wide eyed at a beautiful red scaly egg shaped item.
Maeve raised an eyebrow, glancing down at herself. There was no light. She looked back at the snake, who peered at her in interest.
The next place Maeve decided to purchase from was Potage’s Cauldron Shop, it was small and quite dark with hardly any lighting.  Once again she grabbed a basket and began looking around. She grabbed a nice set of scales, a collapsible brass telescope, and two Cauldron’s. One Pewter and the other Brass, both size two.
The sun was barely beginning to rise, cool air nipping at her face. She felt Loki tighten around her arm. Glancing down at her watch, she noted that the bus should be arriving in a few minutes.
Malfoy gasped. So did the people around them. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: "Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance --"
She was planning on going to the library to catch up on some summer reading, Loki hadn't wanted to come. He preferred to stay in the warm, heated room rather than walk in the cool summer breeze. -My spoiled snake.-  She walked into the quiet kitchen, the Dursleys were sitting eating peacefully. Maeve smirked as she noticed Vernon had to restrain himself from flinching at the sight of her.
As she was lost in her thoughts, she didn't notice the owl flying towards her, heading straight for the open window. A loud screech shocked her out of her head, Maeve's green orbs widened as the small, tawny owl sat perched on one of the brown, sturdy chairs. It stared at her with wide golden eyes, sticking one of its clawed talons out, peering at her with an intelligent gaze.
Lunch went by quickly, and Mrs. Colt had everyone take out a book for silent reading. Maeve was one of the few who actually read, the other students just drew or colored. She began reading a book she burrowed from the public library, it was about the pearl harbor. It had some big words, but she always figured out what they meant.
The boy shrugged his shoulders with a teasing smirk. "Maybe it's because I pay attention to the little details? And you're not very observant."
Her attention snapped towards the doorway where Weasley appeared, panting and flushed a dark red. He scampered to the back after making eye contact with the dark haired girl, a smirk curled at her lips and green eyes lighting up at receiving such a wonderful response. The lanky boy was much like a skittish animal once he found out exactly who the predator was. Though it appeared that he still couldn't keep his mouth shut so she'd have to set him straight once and for all. She couldn't have a disobedient pet.
Maeve giggled before reaching over and patting his cheek in apology. "There, there we're just messing you Draco. And for what it's worth, I do appreciate you watching out for me." She smiled genuinely, earning her a small blush from her friends.
Maeve sat up in her room, she could hear her aunt Petunia running around like a headless chicken fixing up the house for her guest. She could only hope no one told Marge about her, that would ruin the fun. She was dressed in her favorite maroon long sleeved dress that fell just below her knees, black flats, ans her dark curls were let down, falling perfectly down her back.
The wizardring worlds first mistake was ignoring the fact that the defeat of Voldemort had also caused the deaths of the parents of the proclaimed savior, the girl who lived. And that would lead to their downfall.
She chose two books by Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. Her attraction for old love stories never showed from outside her world of books, she merely liked the way they were portrayed, reality showed love differently. It was disappointing how much men lacked chivalry and how women never act like proper lady's.
Maeve heaved the basket upon the counter and smiled politely. “I’d like for you to check these out and I’d like a First year Potion-Making Kit and a Potion Kit Bag, please.”
She stood up and removed her wand from her holster in a swift motion. Normally she wouldn't need to say the charm to get her magic to do what she wanted, after all intent and focus was a major key in magic even working but she felt the need to keep her wandless and non-verbal magic in secret. Draco had mentioned that such an act was rare and she would very much like to keep Dumbledore off her.
With a raised brow, the woman did as told. She then smiled in a way that showed she was humoring the young girl. “Where are your parents, child? Surely you’ll need someone to pay for your things.”
Silvertooth had told her about the Platinum gold card gringotts provided for an additional hundred galleons, it was unlimited and she would be receiving the money straight from the bank. She accepted it before she was led out by Griphook, he was taking her to a well guarded room where all the healing was done. He handed her a robe and walked out, leaving her to change. Quickly as possible, she removed her clothing before slipping on the silk like robe.
The pug faced girl stiffened before scurrying towards an empty seat in the back. Maeve's eyes were still on her before she faced the professor with an apologetic smile. "Forgive me, professor. I guarantee she'll be dealt with properly later. Please, continue."
§Yesss, he had to recognize hissss place and not to quessstion me any longer. The sssooner they underssstood that, the fassster we all could get along.§
'One more month and I will finally be officially setting up the new rules in the Dursley household. They will listen and obey me, or they'll be punished harshly. I've already learned how to purposely inflict pain on others, without it being traced back to me. Tommy Fells still wont come within five feet of me, I take it as a win. I even successfully learned to command others to do what I want with just my voice. Samantha Pearling has given me twenty pounds within the span of four days. Soon I'll be in control.'
She widened her eyes a little more, throwing in the kicked puppy look she mastered. "We'll, you see, I'm trying to get my things up but there much to heavy for me. I was hoping you'd be of help?" She blinked slowly, fluttering her eyelashes innocently.
The young girl looked down as her serpent approached, tongue flickering out his mouth. He stared at her expectantly and she nearly laughed at the frustrated hiss that escaped his mouth. She bent down to be face to face with her dear snake.
Theo glanced at the green eyed girl, blue eyes shining with anticipation. "Does that mean we're a step closer to taking control?"
Blaise, who was an unbothered king, took her words in stride. He congratulated her on freeing her godfather and then just sat at the table beside hers with a parchment and quill pulled out. The Italian boy didn't see the point in backtracking everything she said, Maeve was smart and wouldn't let her emotions control her rational thinking. Besides, even if they did do something controversial then he doubted the girl would allow them to be caught red-handed. So, Blaise simply chose to sit back and let the path run its course. It wouldn't bother him, anyways.
He hissed out, questioningly. She had paused mid-step towards her closet, seeming to freeze and stare into nothing.
"The ministry wouldn't like if children were taught such dark things, so us professors have been given strict instructions on just teaching you how to defend from the Dark that can harm you. And would you further explain what you mean about protection from light magic?"
The young Slytherin growled in annoyance. "No, it's not wonderful, and I would appreciate it if that old bastard could mind his own business. Do tell him that when you tell him I refused your hand in friendship. Have a good day...or don't, I really do not care."
They met the professor in front of the classroom door where she waited for them to arrive. Her thin lips pursed as a sour look overcame her face, Maeve raised a delicate brow. The stern lady stepped aside and motioned for them to enter. Maeve did as told and shouldered passed them.
The man's clear blue eyes stared at the dark haired girl, amusement flitting through. A small smirk curled at thin lips. He stuck his hand out. "Pleasure to meet you, Lady Potter."
Everyone murmured in agreement when Draco's stomach grumbled causing chuckles to ripple through them and for Draco to flush in embarrassment.
"Mrs. Colt, pleasure to see you." Petunia said with her thin lips pulled in a smile. Dudley made his way towards his mom as Mrs. Colt felt the need to tell Petunia Dursley just how she felt about her son.
Loki, who had been awfully quiet during the whole conversation, hissed in agreement to what the Italian boy said. Her three friends slightly jumped at the sight of the serpent, Maeve giggled and Loki looked on in amusement. She gently rubbed at his small delicate head, sighing as she practically felt the tension seep away at the mere touch of her snake. Power of a familiar, she supposes.
"I trust word of my speaking this way will not be spread about?" Though her tone spoke nonchalance, her eyes were harden as though to dare anyone to object. While most Ravenclaws were known for their thirst of knowledge, they also knew the line no to cross just to get answers and going against the short raven haired girl will be something that could cost their lives, they knew that much was true. Slytherins were known for their self-preservation, they knew power when they saw it and power meant safety. Opposing Potter would only mean forfeiting their lives.
Maeve woke to Loki nudging her with the tip of his tail, she smiled sleepily at him. She wanted to lay in, but knew that wasn't possible. At least Loki agreed last night to stay by her side.
Maeve raised a brow as she followed, she had assumed someone from the ministry would be taking her. Professor Snape didn't look back or try to speak to her, he just marched down the corridors as his black robe flared from behind him. They headed down the familiar hallway leading to the Great Hall, she wondered why as it would be easy to just leave.
Maeve rolled her eyes, as said long ago, Loki was a spoiled brat. But she wouldn't change him for the world. He was hers and she was his. How its always been and always will be.
She put on a dark grey oversized shirt and beige shorts that hung at her hips and fell just below her calves. She combed her fingers through her messy hair before pulling it into a ponytail, aunt Petunia only allowed her to use the hairbrush for school or church. Church was mandatory for her, as uncle Vernon claimed God needed to punish the devil child as though if she walked in He would strike her down.
Maeve nodded with a frown, her previous anger fading away and she slumped rather ungracefully on the closet chair. "I'll need to write to your father, Draco, have him informed of what had occurred. As my proxy he is required to know these things, I'll let him know that if I'm pulled aside again I'd like him to be present. I'll not speak alone."
"I want those blocks off and loyalty spells gone." She stated firmly at his curious glance. "And would you be able to tell me who this Morningstar person is?" The curiosity had begun to gnaw at her once she saw the unfamiliar name. "Also, would you be so kind as to direct me to my vaults? I'd like to see all that I have."
Maeve was the last to wake up, deciding she had deserved to get some much needed sleep. She had Petunia doing everything, cleaning, cooking and weeding the garden. It wasn't her job anymore.
"The names Hagrid." He introduced himself, she shot a beaming smile but didn't bother to say her name.
“Do you by any chance have a female employee? I’d rather not have a man touch me, if you don’t mind.” She grimaced at the thought of letting an unknown stranger anywhere near her body, the man could very well be a pedophile and she’d rather not risk it. “Also, would you be so kind as to tell me your name?”
Maeve smiled and rushed to the loo too began getting ready, once she was dressed she pulled her hair into a messy bun atop her head and emerald headband to push away her front loose baby hairs. Quickly sliding on her black flats and allowing Loki to slither up her arm, she made her way out of the dorm and into the common room where the students should be arriving. Green eyes scanned the area but no sight of her group of boys, a pout formed on her lush lips. They hadn't arrived yet, how exhausting. Must they always be late when she awaits them?
Quickly changing and combing through her dark curls before heading downstairs. The shouting got louder as she neared the kitchen, it was an argument between aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon about her. She growled quietly as she caught snippets of  what they were saying.
"He seems dodgy to me, does he not give you a bad vibe?" She asked pointing at the man sitting fidgety next to the empty seat Snape sat in, he had on a strange turban on for some reason.
§Yesss, I'd make an absolutely perfect ruler. Ssshould they abide my rulesss, mercy would follow them. Sssoon I'll have taken over both worldsss. No one will ssstop me. Not the magicalsss and certainly not thessse abominationsss.§
Maeve was truly grateful for the friends she had made in Hogwarts, they were wonderful and extremely loyal. Loki, who was wrapped tightly around her arm, gave a gentle hiss as he felt another presence approaching. The green eyed girl glanced down before looking around and seeing their head of house, Snape, walk towards them. The young girl turned to her friends and signaled with her eyes for them to watch what they say.
Quirrell lifted a brow at the display the snakes showed. His Lord's former house had never acted like that in his years, dark eyes glinted crimson for just a moment as they landed on a certain dark haired, green eyed girl. Maeve Potter, the girl who lived. She proved herself to be different, aside from being sorted into Slytherin, she was nothing like her parents. More dark and calculative, more cunning and ambitious. She acted nothing like the spoiled childish little girl Dumbledore had them believe.
Maeve looked away in disgust, she could practically hear the fake in her teachers voice. She opened her book to page 36 and began to quietly work.
Malfoy opened the door and allowed Maeve to walk through first, she immediately noticed Dumbledore sitting at the center of the long table. His blue eyes twinkled happily, the old man had secrets, she was sure of it. She was also aware of how the few students at the Slytherin table were observing her, though were trying not to be obvious about it.
Maeve grinned wickedly, finally everyone was present, she cleared her throat and with her hand she gestured for her parasite relative to sit. Vernon growled in anger, his face turning a disturbing shade of purple. He opened his mouth to shout, but Maeve raised her palm forward and closed it into a fist, effectively silencing her brute of an uncle.
"She was a short plump woman, correct? I believe I saw her that day, I merely ignored her. She was being far too loud for being surrounded by the non-magical people. Muggles, I believe you said."
Mrs. Colt would never force Dudley to actually do it. She was too much of a coward to tell Dudley to do anything. Because Dudley Dursley would scrunch up his fat, ugly face and pretend to wail.
Maeve nodded. "Fred, George do me a favor. I will be heading back to my dorm before our next period, do you mind letting Malfoy know I wont be having lunch with him today? That I'll be busy?" She fluttered her eyelashes and pouted her lips. "Great!" She shouted when they nodded dazedly, before turning and running down to the dungeons. She had a letter to write.
Maeve nodded, agreeing with the blonde. She wiped her lips and stood up, smiling at her darling snakes. "Have the first years finished eating?"
A few hours later, they were making their way towards the Great Hall for dinner. Maeve listened with a smile as her boys joked around. Just as they reached the doors, a shout called out to them. "Potter, wait a moment!"
Draco looked at her impressed, he knew about those because of his father and godfather. They had wanted him to be able to protect himself from those wishing to influence him, he didn't think she'd know about them. Only because she grew up in the muggle world, but she was intelligent so she must have studied and memorized everything.
Maeve listened as he spoke, his usual drawl not present as he talked politics. She filed that as important in her mind, it seems she'd have further use of him aside from school. "How could anyone like muggles? Their parasites infesting our air." Though she did realize after her visit to gringotts that muggles did have their use, such as providing fresh magic in some of their children.
"Potter," Snape's familiar drawl called out to her, the aforementioned girl refrained from rolling her eyes, but hummed in response, not bothering to look at him. "McGonnagal would like to speak to you. You remember she's your Transfiguration teacher, I'm sure?" Maeve mentally scoffed at the mention of the prejudiced old biddy.
The old man eyed them with blue twinkling eyes, eyes that seemed to hold secrets. "Ms.potter, are you sure you wish to attend this trial?" He asked with fabricated concernment.
P.S can people recommend me some books or shows? And tell me your favorite ships from the shows or books, because I like knowing.
So this was a little different than how I originally wrote it on my wattpad account, but I like it. I was gonna add Peverell since the Potters were descended from that bloodline, but I'll just add it later when I add it in my original one.
Entering the small pub, it instantly grew in size on the inside. The air of magic hit her and she closed her eyes in contentment. She reopened them when she felt someone approaching her.
Loki hissed thoughtfully, a forked tongue flickering out his mouth. So this was what his human had been worrying about. He calmed slightly at that.
Maeve looked at her short story, the title was 'The last dragon egg'. She slowly began reading the first paragraph.
Maeve shifted through her trunk, which she kept beside her and Loki who still slept, for her plain school robes. She stood up with a smile. "Excuse me, I'm going to change, you should as well. I'll be back in a moment." She stepped carefully around the things belonging to the lackeys, their names forgotten, and opened the compartment before stepping out.
With Defense Against the Dark Arts out of the way and professor Quirrell's suspicious behavior behind her, Maeve decided it was perfectly fine with some alone time. She loved her friends but she's been alone for so long that she needed a break from all the caring and love from people that weren't Loki. She wasn't used to all the positive attention without her needing to manipulate anyone.
Everyone could feel the moment it happened, even without knowing what exactly occurred. Hogwarts Headmaster and it's professors would have no idea of the storm brewing in the form of one Maeve Potter, the girl they left behind in the muggle world. The course of the future had been altered the moment Ms. Potter recognized the self-fulfilling prophecy and ignored it.
She walked in, without a single glance in her teachers direction, and sat at her desk in the far back corner next to the window. The clock read 7:55, 5 minutes till the bell rang. Letting the students in the cafeteria know class would soon begin.
Also, if you haven't caught on, I'm basing some of her personality of Klaus Mikaelson from TVD and the Originals because he's the love of my life~
"Welcome," he said. "Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!
A tall, bald man with a few missing teeth smiled jovially. He looked like a toothless walnut. "Welcome, I'm Tom. How can I help you?"
This locket was physical proof that she was powerful, that she could change the world and take control. The goblins said this would help and by Merlin would she use it to the fullest potential. The common room had several older years but none of her friends, she inwardly groaned at having to search for them.
"I see we've gotten to meet the lovely Lady Potter once more, how delightful." After attending the court trial she could clearly hear the difference of Sirius Black's voice in person. He'd sounded so dull and drained as he was being interrogated, such a vast difference from the happy and cheerful boy he once was. Guess prison did that to people.
"It's a wall between 9 and 10. Its magic keeps passage out of sight of the muggles," she said that word as though she couldn't believe that was what she and her kind were referred to. "You just walk through and you'll no at Hogwarts express."
She made her list and wrote a letter to the Dursleys, she wouldn't be needing a ride. She'll take the bus. Maeve walked to her closet and pulled out faded blue jeans and a black and red checkered flannel and her black converse.
Finally, did the two oldest let the students to their room to wash up and sleep. Maeve didn't bother to dress into her nightwear, she let Loki out his cage  before cuddling him into her side, ignoring his complaints of being trapped for to long. Once Loki stopped hissing both were out like a light switch.
§Well, I had to put two girlsss in there place, they were after all very rude.§ She replied with a quiet snicker.
"Oh, we'll accomplish that and so much more." She answered truthfully. "All we have to do is stay on top of our studies and focus on gathering recruits. We need the rest of the Slytherins on our side before they can turn to Voldemort. We already have the first years, they'll join us with a little push." She paused for a moment trying to remember something that was important. "Oh, by the way, don't look Dumbledore in the eyes no matter what. He's very talented in legilimency, able to access one's thoughts and feelings. We'll have to learn Occlumency, in order to protect our minds. It's also useful for clearing our heads from unwanted thoughts."
Maeve mentally smirks to herself when she sees Weasley get sorted into Gryffindor just as she thought. She and Malfoy stop talking as Zabini walked to be sorted, he sat there for a second before the hat called Slytherin. She, along with the rest of the house, clapped and invited him to sit across from Malfoy.
With her right index finger she traced P.O.M on his meaty forearm. She smiled sadistically as the large man squirmed in pain. Then, with her left hand she reached forward and gripped his right arm, calling upon her magic she snapped his arm. He let out an agonized scream.
Fred frowned and looked at his twin. "Before we boarded the train, mum was shouting out asking for the platform number around several muggles. We didn't know why seeing as she clearly knows where it's at but then she started looking around. She might've been looking for you all that time."
Loki replied as though it were the most obvious answer. Though perhaps to him it was. He watched as his human smiled, the look on her eyes would make a grown man shiver in fear.
Cedric finished drinking the last of his pumpkin juice and wiping the corner of his mouth. "I'm actually pretty good in Herbology as well, our Head of House is Professor Sprout, she enjoys helping us when needed. My best and favorite subject would be runes, though it is an elective."
Maeve woke to the still dark sky, she groaned shifting slightly. Loki hissed in annoyance as he was jostled, she smiled apologetically as she sat up. Groaning as her stuff muscles popped, she glanced at her clock.
As she had been looking away she missed the stunned look on Malfoy's face from the breathtaking smile she aimed at him. His heart beating erratically, why was his friend so attractive? It wasn't fair. He looked away ignoring the other two as they muffled their snickers. They didn't witness a heart stopping smile so they couldn't judge.
When Neville Longbottom, the boy who had been trembling at the doors, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Longbottom. When it finally shouted, "GRYFFINDOR," Longbottom ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to "MacDougal, Morag."
Maeve grabbed her bag and walked into the kitchen where she left the note behind. Wanting to make sure those insects saw it straight away. After all she didn't want them thinking they had a chance to leave.
As she looked for the library, she realized she was lost after a wrong turn. She sighed, resigning herself to just lying on the moving stairs to lead he somewhere. But soon discarded the thought as she heard rambunctious laughter from behind her. She quickly stood up and turned, brows furrowing as she saw two identical twins with flaming red hair. The Weasley twins from the welcoming feast.
Taking her time in rubbing in body lotion before starting to dress herself. She winced a couple of times before finally combing through the knots and tangles, carefully pulling her hair into a French braid. Leaving her tie as the last time, loosely tied around her neck.
"I would like to know how you've settled in Slytherin? Are the students giving you a hard time? We can always have you resorted. You know your parents were in Gryffindor, wonderful people they were." He had a nostalgic look in his eyes, as though remembering the good times in the past. She wasn't fooled by the act.
"Now would be preferable, and alone would be appreciated." The crooked nosed man responded as he noticed the looks the group of teens shared. He hid a grimace as he knew his godson was in the grasp of the dark haired witch, the daughter of his long time rival.
"You can go get Dudley now." She told her aunt and then pointed at Marge who had collapsed once the magic lifted. "And you can clean yourself up. Its time for dinner." As soon as she finished speaking the three adults were up and going.
Maeve had received a headache at their cut off speech, were all magical twins like this? Goodness, she'd kill if she found similar twins as these two. Well, at least she knew they were nothing like their brother, which earned them brownie points. "Would you two happen to know where the library is, since you both claimed your duty of offering assistance."
This time Maeve let the growl out, this idiotic boy had to go and bury himself even deeper into the hole he dug. Oh, how she'd enjoy punishing him in many different ways. But she couldn't, at least not yet. "I'll. Destroy. You." she punctuated the three words, and she meant them for she was a Potter and she recognized his name from the list of those planning on controlling her. "Now, you should leave before you make things worse."
She heard shouting downstairs, it seemed her pathetic family members couldn't be bothered to keep quiet. Sighing, she sat up stretching her arms above her head. Groaning as her muscles popped satisfyingly. She got up and headed to her closet in the guest room she had taken over, it was filled with clothes that she had her aunt Petunia purchased for her. She picked out a black, knee length, spaghetti strapped dress with a soft long sleeved shirt underneath and her favorite black leather doc martins.
She neatly folded the letter and handed it to Malfoy, who placed it in his bag with a promise of sending it during dinner. Professor Binns continued droning and didn't seem aware of half the class falling asleep or not paying attention. That wouldn't do for her little group of friends, she wouldn't allow them to fall behind on studies because of an inept teacher. So she nudged Malfoy and had him tell the other two that they would  be meeting in the library during their free period to be ahead on studying. They nodded in affirmation.
"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well."
"We must be heading out, as we do not want to be late." Lord Malfoy turned to Snape and wished farewell. "Come, Lady Potter, we'll head up to the headmasters office and floo from there." As he turned to walk away, she allowed a look of disdain to grace her face. Of course she couldn't avoid the old bastard for long, life couldn't be that easy.
"Well, since you asked, Georgie and I would like to offer our delightful souls to our dark queen and perhaps become a part of your loyal subjects." Fred smiled with his teeth, George nodding along with his words.
She nodded with a smile, thanking him for his help which he waved off. They finished dinner in silence, Blaise and Theo having gone to their dorms early to put their packages away. She planned on waiting to see what was sent to her when she got to her room or in the morning when she woke to accompany the Weasleys, for now she'd eat.
"Goodnight boys." Maeve hugged each of her friends before walking to her dorm, leaving three blushing messes behind her.
“Ms. Potter, yes?” Maeve nodded, the woman had a soothing voice. “I am Margaret Channings, you may call me Margaret. Please follow me so we can get your measurements done.” The eleven year old was led to the fitting area in the back corner, she was told to stand on the mahogany block where it would be easier for Margaret to measure her. “Anything in particular you’d like?”
"Stop." She ordered, she walked forward and gripped the panting blonde's arm, with her magic she broke it causing her to let out a shriek before also falling to the ground unable to withstand the pain. Maeve crouched down in order to be eye to eye with the two shaking parasites. "Lets get this clear, I'm someone you don't want to mess with. Now when I leave, you wont remember what happened here, you wont recall who did this to you. You've never met or seen me. But you will remember what I've said, and who is the better between us. Understood?" She asked with a faux smile of innocence, the two girls nodded their heads rapidly, fearing what would come if they disagreed.
"I'm willing to bet Dumbledore had something to do with it, she's probably a puppet whose strings belong to that old goat." Maeve said she cared not about admitting her dislike of the mother of the two boys present. They were her twins now either way, they had offered their loyalty.
She put on a pair of clean underwear along with her beige skirt that was two inches above her knees and her button up shirt which she tucked in. She grabbed her broken hairbrush and began combing through her thick mane of dark curls. Pulling on her ballerina shoes she received from her aunt, she opened the small cupboard door and head out to the kitchen.
"First, I'm Fred, this here is George. Second, you are going to close your eyes, if you could tell us who is who once we tell you to open them again we'll offer our help and undying loyalty." He had a look in his eyes, like he fully believed she would fail. Had no one really guessed correctly to warrant such confidence?
She smirked as she walked out, green eyes searching for the pub. Leaky cauldron, it should have magic surrounding it. With that thought in mind she closed her eyes and called out for the familiar sense of magic.
"Okay, I'll make a list of things I'll need and want. I do not want to carry around parchment. Its so out of date." She walked towards her desk and grabbed paper and a pen. Sitting down on her spinning chair, she twirled around, thinking. "I should get an owl. They're quite useful. They're like your own personal mailman. Its intriguing."
Maeve smile with barely revealed approval. "Excellent, Malfoy. I'm sure it'll prove to be very useful to you as it would to me."
Malfoy let her words sink in, specifically the part where his father would be impressed by the questions he asked with an air of maturity. He could do that, convince his father to speak of work and ask questions as casually as he could. Potter had to be right, he was heir to his family name as the only child of the Malfoy's. He had to know and understand certain things in order to be a great Lord. Surely father would be proud of his desire to learn his role. He nodded with an determine look set on his face.
Soon they stopped in front of a very large door, its height slightly intimidated her. Griphook knocked firmly and then stepped back and waited.
Maeve shared a look with Draco before opening their book, the page was written on the board in an elegant scrawl. She withheld an eyeroll, had anyone been blind then they'd never know what they had to do. Honestly, for a
"Forgive me, professor, but I must be going. My friends cannot be trusted to be on their own for too long, they lose their heads when I'm not around. Goodnight." She smiled and walked off, leaving the man with two souls behind.
"I don't know why Headmaster Dumbledore allowed the likes of you to enter Hogwarts. The son of a no good death eater!" Honestly this boy had no respect. Malfoy was obviously wealthy and from a respectful family, this ginger clearly couldn't see he had no room to talk.
"Mrs. Colt," she started with a soft soothing voice and a charming smile. "When Petunia Dursley arrives to pick up Dudley, I want you to tell her how you truly feel about her son. Let her know how idiotic and incompetent her child is, that he lacks the brains to go any further in life. You're going to tell her what a horrible mother she is and how she lacks in the normalcy she craves. Do you understand?" She pushed the persuasion into her voice to make sure Mrs. Colt does as she's told.
Something happened that made several students jump about a foot in the air, several people around them screamed.
Maeve's eyes trailed from McGonagall to the old man who sat peacefully drinking from his goblet, eyes twinkling and instantly the dark haired girl could feel his magic coiling in a vaguely threatening manner. She knew he was planning something, something that no doubt would include her. He was a scheming old man, someone to be wary of. "We'll have to keep an eye on him, he's up to something. We'd just have to intercept should the need arise." She instructed, keeping her voice quiet so as to not alert anyone else.
"I'll pick the most outrageous gift, don't worry." Maeve snickered as she finished her sandwich and started on her treacle tart. The class quieted as professor Binns floated in, he had a dull expression as he began to drone on in a flat, toneless voice.
Voldemort walked in front of the supposed child who would come to defeat him in the near future. He chuckled darkly, her, a mere infant, kill him! The very idea was unbelievable. He stared into her eyes, a knowing glint flashed within them and she practically stared into his soul. He raised his wand to her forehead and whispered, "Avada Kedavra." Something unexpected happened. A bright burst of light exploded from the baby and the curse bounced off of her and onto him. He screamed before he was no more. A piece of his soul flew to the only live person remaining.
