“Ron,” George Weasley’s voice said. Except his tone was even terser than usual, laced with an anxiety, a worry that had Harry’s gut immediately clenching in apprehension. “Ron, get over here now. We’re at the shop and—that’s it, love, deep breaths—look, we’re at the shop and I think the baby’s coming. Okay, no, I’m
That wasn’t hatred, or anger, or even pain—that was affection, pure and deep and all-consuming.
And, last but not least, to keep in mind that it was not his fault. Not even marginally.
“Just…don’t. Please. You don’t have to tell me, you don’t have to say anything.” He folded both his hands over Draco’s. “It doesn’t matter to me, okay? It
“You…bake?” Parvati said carefully, eyeing Draco. However, Harry was glad to see, it wasn’t hatred or anger or disgust in her eyes, but sheer surprise.
“Why thank you,” Draco replied dryly. “It’s one of my many talents.”
“No.”
“Mate,” Harry said carefully, “you know I didn’t mean to—”
.” Harry heaved a leaden sigh, but he didn’t sound annoyed, if anything, he sounded amused. “It’s just…back at the store, Pansy and I were talking.”
Draco gave a mock-pout. “But then all your hard work yesterday will have been for naught.”
Draco’s smile wasn’t bland anymore—it was absolutely humongous, especially as he said, “Anyway, I’m certain you have about a million other things to do, so I won’t keep you here any longer. All is forgiven. You know, feel free to stop by any time; Harry and I certainly aren’t going anywhere.” He checked his wrist and tutted, and Harry was still so mystified he only later remembered Draco was neither wearing a wristwatch, nor did he own one in the first place.
. Another breath.
‘You’re welcome.’
Fuck. Fuck, fuck,
He said it as though it was the most obvious thing in the world, all the while frowning at Draco with something similar to distrust, but less hostile and more…curious.
Draco couldn’t remember a time in the past nine years that he’d ever felt happier.
“Why, yes, Potter, shockingly, that would be of help.”
Draco barked a laugh at that, but the sound of it, oddly shrill and disconnected, felt wrong in his own ears. “Isn’t he? So, I suppose I misheard, then? You weren’t planning on going on a date with him later?”
“Err…” Harry shifted uncomfortably in his armchair, face already warming. Being set up by his friend was awkward and weird enough as it was. But being set up by his friend in the company of not only his ex-girlfriend, but also ex-rival/enemy-turned-friend (that’s what they were, right?)—that was just too much.
Narcissa’s gaze shifted to Draco, who offered a small smile in response.
“Nic,” he said, keeping his tone light but cautious. “What’re you doing here?”
! It’s not some game! Yaxley could have
Eventually, however, Draco felt a pair of eyes on him, and he looked up from where he’d been staring down into his teacup to find none other than Harry Potter studying him, expression oddly unreadable.
duelling inside your flat. It’s out of the question.”
“Sorry?”
It was still awkward as fuck.
Except, no, that wasn’t true. Harry hadn’t been lying before when he’d told Draco he was a great Auror, more than great, even; the Slytherin protected those he loved with a passion he rarely let the outer world see. Albeit slightly preoccupied himself, Harry had caught glimpses of Draco during the Battle of Hogwarts, had seen how he’d duelled against people he’d once called family for the sake of what was right and never once slipped up. And then again during the Death Eater Trials, as Lucius Malfoy’s fate was decided, and Narcissa leaned on Draco, her frail shoulders shaking, while he in turn sat ramrod straight, grey gaze unyielding, refusing to shrink away under the glares and whispered insults, strong even as his father was taken away to Azkaban in chains. Hell, even now—regardless of his lifelong hatred of Harry, Draco had still agreed to stay with him around the clock and make sure he remained safe.
Harry glanced at the man in question, and immediately felt his own expression soften. The steely glint in the Slytherin’s eyes, the determined angle of his jaw, the sharp edges of his face—but then also the way Draco curled up against him, the way their hands rested between them, interlocked, the way his silvery hair framed his face like a halo.
And all of a sudden, a crazy idea hit Draco, and he could feel a burst of hysterical laughter bubble up in his chest.
Either Harry had just blacked out à-la-Tom-Riddle’s-diary and missed some important turning point in their conversation that’d make sense of all this, he figured, or Draco had in the last thirty seconds gone completely mental.
It was perhaps seconds or minutes or years later that the Floo sounded in the living room, a long string of curses promptly following.
Hermione sunk into the chair beside his, and Ron went to stand by her side, a hand already subconsciously reaching out for hers, which she took without even glancing up. “Yaxley,” she said, but by the pensive gleam in her eyes and the tight press of her lips, Harry assumed she was thinking aloud. “
done, the sane part of him was noticeably more perturbed by the sullen looks she kept shooting him.
A shrill scream sounded across the shop and then a woman started cursing, a woman whose voice Draco immediately recognised as Philomena Craigs’. But he ignored her, instead scrambling up as quickly as he could, wand trained on the fireplace, chest heaving.
café somewhere in the South of Wales. (Honestly, Draco would
Silence.
Draco’s forehead furrowed, and he set down his cup of Darjeeling. “You know exactly why, Potter. Because you’re their Saviour. They adore you.” He’d meant for it to sound derogatory, but the words came out with no real harshness to them at all.
Draco shook his head incredulously and threw a cushion at Harry; (thankfully his Auror training had prepared him for situations like this, and he managed to dodge it just in time).
That’s when it hit him.
Ginny opened her mouth to say something, but before she could, a familiar voice said from behind Harry, “What’s going on here?”
“Wait a second,” Harry said, ignoring the eye roll it earned him. “You’re here. Why are you here? You’re supposed to be in St. Mungo’s, recovering from almost being murdered by Yaxley yesterday—”
Harry looked up, surprised to find Draco’s face smoothed into a sombre expression, grey eyes flickering across Harry’s face. The Slytherin sighed and set down the mixer, and in that moment it cracked something in Harry’s chest seeing how disheartened and exhausted and hopeless Draco looked.
But then Harry exclaimed, focusing his wide smile on the stranger, “Nic! Wow, what a coincidence seeing you here today. Also, I meant to tell you, I’m so sorry about what happened the other night. I promise you, when we go out, we don’t always end up in a hospital bed at St. Mungo’s.”
Draco’s anger was gone just as suddenly as it had appeared, and all he could manage was a strangled, “You
“George is really throwing himself into his work,” Ron continued. “But it’s better than how he was directly after the war, so I’m not complaining. Percy’s still Percy, obviously, and Charlie’s just started training this new dragon race. You see, they’re especially dangerous, because not only is their breath fiery, but their tails also have these venomous barbs.
“Zabini!” Draco hissed, eyes wide as he looked around. He didn’t care that they were in muggle Wales, he didn’t care everyone had already gone back to their own business after his little outburst—or, that is, his heart didn’t care, not when it could still thunder on as though it were about to burst out of his chest. “You can’t just
A crease of his own formed on Harry’s brow. “He came to apologize, Draco, why are you—”
And at that moment, the Floo sounded, and a red-haired, gangly figure burst into the flat, coughing violently.
There was a long moment of silence, in which Draco simply stared at Harry, grey eyes unreadable. Then, finally, Draco said, “Merlin, don’t tell me you honestly don’t know?”
He Flooed straight home.
“I need to see him. I need to see Harry
He rolled his eyes playfully but didn’t bother supressing the grin that curled across his face. “Yes, Mother, because it’s been
Draco’s gaze slid to the two other Aurors, both currently deep in conversation with Potter, who all the while wore that god-awful smile. The one that brightened up his entire face, making him look a lot less weary than he usually did. Draco had never met either of the Aurors, but judging by their serious expressions and notable burliness, they seemed a reasonable choice for Robards to send with Potter. Draco briefly wondered how one might ask two complete strangers what their blood status was without getting beaten to a pulp, but then Potter turned to him, that blasted smile illuminating his eyes.
Which meant this wonderful person Harry’d come to care for so, his arrogant, pretentious toff, his boyfriend…was simultaneously his soulmate.
The notion was disturbing as it was upsetting. A week ago, Harry would have been shaken by Draco Malfoy’s death, but only as much as he would have been by the death of any other Auror colleague. Now, however, after how very much he felt they’d opened up to one another the day before, even if it had only been a few days since their paths had been thrown back together, the idea of Draco dying left him in a much worse state than what could be categorized under the term ‘shaken’.
Draco didn’t let down his shield as he stepped forwards, and so Yaxley’s last few haphazardly aimed curses bounced off harmlessly.
“Definitely.”
“It was my fault, really.”
Draco’s smile grew as well. He nodded. “Harry.”
“Oh, indubitably.”
Well fuck.
. I raised you better than that.”
enough! I’m well aware of yours and Auror Malfoy’s past quarrels, but such accusations will not be levelled against a fellow Auror, not as long as you work for me, understand? Auror Malfoy has been nothing but an asset to the department. You’d do well to remember that.”
Over three years since the war, three years of redeeming himself and the Malfoy family name, three years of righting wrongs and solving problems for people just out of the goodness of his heart—and Draco still had to put up with this shit. It’d be downright laughable were it not so fucking insulting.
The other man shrugged. “Yeah, that.”
There was blood, Harry could feel the warm, sticky wetness of it, and he was pretty sure he was screaming. But he couldn’t tell for sure, couldn’t hear anything save for the too-fast drumming of his own heart, and the rushing of blood in his ears, and a soft, familiar voice that said from somewhere above him:
He expected Draco to respond with some snarky, sarcastic comment, as was the Slytherin way. Instead, however, his grimace dissolved into thin air, replaced by a tight-lipped
The Healer-in-training took one look at Draco, who sat on the hospital bed, both arms crossed tightly over his stomach, expression likely one of extreme discomfort—and promptly froze dead in his tracks, dark eyes wide.
! Besides, it wasn’t even my fault, really. I just happened to get side-tracked and forgot I had it in the oven. Happens to everyone.”
him, and now you’re fucking living together. That’s
Harry chuckled, a grin curling across his face despite his best efforts, already replacing the blush, and Draco was immediately glad he’d gone with that answer. Yet the multitude of unspoken truths still curled around his mind, unwilling to release their talons from his thoughts, always there, looming.
Draco had honestly begun to think he was off the hook.
Harry laughed, and then he’d wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck again and they were kissing. And Harry’s wrist still tingled slightly as the black ink of his soulmark settled into his skin forever, forming the one name it had always been meant to form.
When it was safely out of the way, Harry stepped back with a sigh, brushing his hands together as he surveyed his handiwork. “There. All done.”
“There,” Draco said, corking the vial and letting it disappear into his pocket. He offered the old shopkeeper one last fake simper. “As always, Philomena, this was simply delightful. I do hope we never meet again.” And without awaiting her no doubt scathing reply, Draco turned gracefully on his heel, and strode across the room, awarding the woman not another glance.
Draco jumped out of the way just in time, Yaxley’s next curse missing him by mere hairsbreadths, so close it singed the side of his coat.
It was risky, Draco knew that. A gamble that could very well cost him his life. Except, well, he was going to die anyway if he didn’t do something soon, and Draco’s entire personality was nothing if not risky. It was one of the reasons he and Harry fit so well.
The truth was, Harry liked how far they’d come, him and Draco. As a matter of fact, he liked it very much. He liked how funny and kind and selfless the new Draco was. He liked how he baked when he was stressed, and how he laughed when the inevitable came to pass and Harry did something stupid yet again, and how he cheated at Uno and defended his use of a nine on top of a six because
But above the sirens, Draco could hear his own heartbeat as it drummed against his ribcage, his blood rushing in his ears, droning out all else. He took one last step forwards, and then he stood just a foot away from the cloak-bundled man, so close he could reach out and yank back his hood if he so desired, finally see who it was that so adamantly wished to kill Draco’s soulmate.
The question now was, though, how angry would Nic’s ‘angry’ be, and was there any way Harry might help?
,” he breathed.
, who Draco had left in the care of Granger and Weasley for the hour he’d be here dealing with Yaxley. To grab his soulmate and take him somewhere none of this shite could reach them, where no one could find them or hurt them or want something from them, no deranged Death Eaters, no overprotective Aurors, no press, no one at all.
very much in-your-face, to a painful extent, even—but Draco was pretty sure that was just as much the
That relief didn’t last, though, when another wave of agony pulsed through him, and a coughing fit overtook him, making his shoulders shake violently. He coughed, so violently it felt as though he was coughing up a piece of his lung, and his throat burned from the inside out.
Because he
But he needn’t have worried, for Draco finally opened his mouth then and, albeit still looking slightly dazed, said quietly, “You’re okay.”
“Oh, please,” Yaxley said, bored, disinterested, as though the words didn’t so much as daunt him. “You said it yourself: I’m going to be incarcerated for life anyway. It hardly matters whether or not I help you do your job now. If anything, really, refusing to comply is my last hurrah of sorts.”
He marched across the room to where Harry was leaning against the wall, head in hands, and he wrapped his arms around him in a hug. Harry started, surprised, but Draco didn’t let go, and thankfully, Harry didn’t shove him away either. A second passed, and then Harry’s arms settled around Draco’s back as well.
Harry breathed a sigh of relief, his heart still beating incessantly against his ribcage. But that relief was short-lived, for it was then that the Patronus—a magpie, even though it was hard to tell through the haziness of it—started talking.
things to care about?
Harry looked so breathtakingly gorgeous that it took all Draco’s self-control to not immediately sprint across the room and snog him senseless, until the air in his lungs ran out. Which was actually, truly, genuinely something he could
Good god, what was he
“Spare us the dramatics, darling,” said Pansy, and Blaise added, grinning manically, “You
Draco wasn’t sure whether to be touched or offended by the question. He wasn’t even sure what to bloody reply. No, he was certainly not fine, thank you very much. Potter, the insufferable Gryffindor, had somehow gotten himself nearly killed
And when Draco walked out of Renaults and Co., leaving its dust-caked shadows behind, Potter was beside him.
He had no one to base parenthood off of, no idea where he’d even start.
It was still early afternoon, and Harry, in his intense and all-consuming boredom, had begun looking over a few old case files from when he’d only just started working the field. Malfoy had locked himself in Harry’s guest room directly after their late breakfast and hadn’t come out since, not even for lunch, for which Harry had ordered pizza. (If he was going to have to laze around home all day, might as well do it right.) He’d saved the Slytherin a few slices but, knowing Malfoy would likely just scowl at the ‘disgusting muggle sick’, Harry fully intended to eat them himself later that day.
boyfriend—pulled him down the hallway, grinning from ear to ear and running so fast it was a wonder he didn’t trip over his own feet.
Draco drew his wand and started slowly, quietly, combing his way through the flat. No upturned furniture, or any other previously-inexistent mess that might indicate a struggle. And had Harry been attacked, regardless of whether he looked like ‘death personified’ or not, Salazar knows there’d have been a struggle. Yet this realization only calmed Draco somewhat, and he kept his wand at the ready.
Jennings said from where he and his partner still stood near the door, “Do you remember anything that might help us identify him? Hair colour, perhaps? Was his voice noticeably deep or particularly gruff? Did he say anything odd?”
Draco, for his part, tried his best to reply. Several times, even. He remained silent for so long Harry’s face twisted back into a concerned frown, forehead creasing with worried little wrinkles.
She arched one delicate eyebrow. “Why, we haven’t had a proper conversation in weeks now. You’ve all but moved out of the Manor, you barely visit, your letters couldn’t be any less informative—I think I’m allowed to miss my only son, am I not?”
Across the table, Blaise was already smiling at him, and although it practically screamed ‘you’re not fooling anybody’ it wasn’t a smirk either, and Draco sighed, wondering for the umpteenth time whether this was just going to be his life now, a tortured half-existence where his soulmate was always
“Shit, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that, should I?” he said, and then he was biting his lower lip again, and if Draco’s mind hadn’t already stopped functioning that would’ve done it. “Forget it, I didn’t mean to pry, it doesn’t matter anyway, I—”
Harry began slowly, “Look, this may sound inconsiderate, and you really don’t have to answer the question if you don’t want to. It’s just…” He hesitated. He really didn’t want to upset Draco any further, but something about the Slytherin’s words… “What do you mean, she gets to experience that, too?”
!’, he still very nearly choked on the half-burnt piece of toast he’d just taken a bite out of.
Say what you will about Narcissa Malfoy, Draco thought with some disgust, but she was the undefeated
Too quiet.
Malfoy fell silent again, grey eyes trained resolutely downwards. With his platinum hair falling softly into his eyes, like strands of silvery silk, curled ever so slightly at the ends, he looked so utterly human and yet so utterly not, all Harry could do was stare.
He took one look at Draco, who looked utterly miserable, and he knew what he had to do. He needed to talk to the Slytherin, alone, talk and make sure he was okay, that something (inordinately) horrible hadn’t happened in the past few hours.
The way the Girl-Weasley’s face flushed, so dark it very nearly matched the red of her hair, made it impossibly hard not to grin. Ooh, Draco knew he should stop. Provoking his soulmate’s ex-girlfriend was only going to end in one great big mess, one he’d likely regret later.
person would do.
Healer Preedan frowned. “Well, we really ought to run a few more tests…”
“No, you did. I remember it like it was yesterday. Which, coincidentally, it was.”
. I have a right to know what’s going on here, and if Yaxley…”
Harry could feel his cheeks start to burn. “With Nic. You completely flipped when I told you we were going on a date. I don’t know, I just figured—”
This time, there could be none of that. This time, he had to put aside his pride, and do it right.
Harry shook his head, the chocolate laying forgotten in his lap. “I’m so sorry, Draco. Honestly. That’s just…wow. I can’t even begin to imagine what your mother must be going through.” He paused. “Is there anything that can be done? To help her?”
Harry shot him a betrayed glare, which only made Draco laugh harder.
Draco’s eyes studied him for what felt like an eternity, gaze flickering over his face, and the blond swallowed hard, making his Adam’s apple bob faintly, eyes all the while glistening in the dim lighting.
“Is she unwell? Your mother, I mean.”
He shook his head in an effort to rid himself of the myriad of unsettling thoughts that had somehow penetrated his mind. Honestly, what was wrong with him? Draco probably wouldn’t even want to get married. Not to mention the man had a soulmate, one he had at some point obviously had feelings for, even if he had lied when saying it was a ‘she’.
“I’m curious as to why you would say that.”
Eventually, Harry couldn’t take it anymore—the tense silence, the restless unease, the apprehension. When paired with his aching body and pounding headache, it was simply all too much.
If he hadn’t recently found out Draco was his literal soulmate, Harry’d probably be pissed right now.
He focused his attention back on Narcissa and nodded resolutely. “I will.” And Harry found he’d never meant anything so sincerely as he did that.
He could practically hear Harry clench his jaw, that’s how hard he did it. “Look, I don’t know what Yaxley said or did or…hinted at, but you need to calm down. You can tell me about it, not tell me about it, whatever. But stop acting like a dick.”
“Harry,” Robards said, and something in his voice yanked Harry from his deliberations, making him look up again. He was startled to find concern gleaming behind the Head Auror’s dark eyes. “I know you’ve been through your fair share of assassination attempts. But this is serious. There’s a high chance whoever did this may be a Death Eater, or at the very least a sympathizer. Someone who goes out of their way to procure Acturin for you, when a simple Avada Kedavra would suffice…I think it’s safe to say this won’t be their last attempt.” His words hung heavily in the air of the hospital room. “Therefore, I’ve decided, to ensure your protection, a fellow Auror will be assigned to your person. They will remain at your side around-the-clock.”
“It’s different,” Draco found himself snapping, suddenly all too aware of the fact that his soulmark was
And then the git had gone and
Draco inhaled deep in an effort to hold on to his rapidly dwindling composure. “I don’t need nor do I want your congratulations.”
“I have picked Auror Malfoy for the job.”
He tried to sit up, but immediately collapsed right back into the soft bedsheets again, having to squeeze his eyes and jaw shut just to keep from bursting into a pitiful display of tears then and there.
Never actually finding his soulmate. Or having found them, but never falling in love with them and thus never knowing it was actually them. Or, even worse, finding them, loving them, and then losing them, and living the rest of his life alone, miserable and broken. Harry had been close to breaking enough times in his life already, and he wasn’t sure how many times more he could mend the cracks before restoration became impossible.
Enjoy!
Draco swallowed an exasperated sigh. “Because getting doused in freezing cold rainwater is part of my pre-bedtime routine. No, Potter, as I already mentioned multiple times, there are
the bowl rather than actually within. “I think I messed it up. I just can’t figure this stupid muggle device out.” The pureblood gave the mixer an especially disparaging sneer. “Bloody muggles, always have to make everything so damn complicated.”
“Holy fuck,” he breathed, eyes wide. “That’s Thai.”
The redhead blinked, and Harry could tell there would be a lot of explaining and recapping in his imminent future—but now, now he had to get to Ministry first.
Sure enough, the spell wore off far too soon, and Harry was grinning wider than should be possible as the Slytherin bound after him, all the while cursing his name and simultaneously also the bubble of Protego-ed air Harry had drawn around himself. Harry had heard Draco curse so often now it shouldn’t come as a surprise anymore to hear the blond spout such foul words in his annoyingly charming, posh nobleman’s accent—but then again, Harry probably also shouldn’t be thinking in the first place how charming Draco Malfoy’s accent is, so. There’s that.
Harry almost smiled, amused—only when he took in the haggard faces all around him, that urge disappeared just as quickly as it had come. “As much as I appreciate you all being here, you really shouldn’t have stayed all night. Lav, I know you have a flight to catch this afternoon—”
It was…practically tasteful. So much so that all the haughty remarks he’d passed that first day in the flat became suddenly inapplicable. Granted, there was still far too much red and gold for Draco’s Slytherin heart, but other than that the room was spacious and clean and elegantly stylish. There were two large, floor-to-ceiling sized windows on one side of the room, framed by gauzy curtains that couldn’t have hid a murderous Death Eater if he was wearing an Invisibility Cloak, bordered on one side by a large bookshelf filled with everything from Quidditch supplies to picture frames to—Merlin’s beard—
He found his mood instantly brightened, however, by the adorable little smile that now spread its way across Draco’s face, soft and lopsided and clearly not voluntary. It was accompanied by the gentlest of blushes, the sort Harry’s skin hid well, while Draco’s, on the other hand, did not.
He started into a sprint down the alley, towards where the figure stood half-concealed in the shadows, and Draco raised his wand towards the man and threw a curse in his direction. He didn’t wait to see whether his curses hit their mark or not before firing another, and another, forcing the man back, back, back.
Now, enough chitchat. Enjoy chapter 19 (and please don’t hate me by the end of this)!
Harry was angry.
!—to shrug. “If you need reminding that you can use magic, then you deserve very nearly throwing out your back.”
“Angelina and George’s child,” said Ron, although it came out as more of a wheeze than anything. He looked deathly pale, and Harry might have offered him a seat on the bed if he thought himself capable of moving over.
“Draco and I are dating,” he admitted. “We weren’t when you and I had dinner on Monday, I swear. I would never…string you along or anything, I promise, but that’s why…well. That’s why we won’t be able to have that do over date after all. I’m sorry, but I’m serious about Draco and I could never do that to him, or you, for that matter. So. Yeah. That’s the truth. Sorry again.”
An hour was a bit much, wasn’t it?
There was only a wretched sort of misery. Misery, and sadness, and guilt, and Draco found himself stunned into silence.
with the fact that it looks like
"Blame this one. She dragged me along," answered Nic, playfully nudging Parvati beside him, who mumbled something under her breath, her blush all the while much, much deeper than Harry's. The bloke had an accent, Harry realized, one that sounded vaguely American. "We work together at Hogwarts. I'm in Ancient Runes, not Divination like Parvati. Honestly, I don't know how she stands it, working under that nutcase Trelawney."
“But…but…,” Harry stammered. Why wasn’t Draco flinging that bowl of batter at Harry’s head? He bloody well
And he was. He didn’t know why exactly it hit him at that moment with such clarity, but he really was tremendously happy just standing there in the slightly cramped kitchen of his slightly cramped flat, joking and laughing with the one person he was supposed to be angry at, the one person he
“I mean thank you,” Harry repeated, weaker, more a strangled choke than his previous shout. He couldn’t decide which was worse. “But I thought you hated Thai? Remember, you called it ‘nauseating muggle fodder’ that one time I tried to make you have some.”
“Look,” she continued, and here Draco had been wondering whether this day could get any more bizarre, and the answer, it seemed, was a very definite yes. “I don’t know what possibly possessed you to think saying such horrible things to Harry would be a good idea, but I’ve come to realise over these past few days that attempting to understand a Slytherin’s way of reasoning is nothing but a waste of energy. So, I’ll spare us both the time and cut straight to it, yes?”
Thankfully, at that moment, someone came rushing down the hallway, and when Draco looked up, it was Blaise’s concerned face that greeted him. The apprentice hadn’t even reached Draco yet, his white Healer’s robes fluttering after him as he ran, when he burst out, “Did you do it? Did you try to murder him?” Draco blinked once in shock, but Blaise was already continuing. “Look, I won’t blame you if you did; Potter’s a very irritating individual. But there’s the whole legal situation to consider, plus, attempted murder on the Saviour of the wizarding world won’t really help your public image.”
And then everyone was shuffling out of the room—some more willingly than others—and, just like that, Harry and Draco were alone.
Draco was not happy.
A long moment of relatively tense silence passed, in which no one, not Nic and least of all Draco, seemed eager to speak.
She knew. She knew she knew
Another snort from Ron. Harry had already twisted in his seat, mouth curved into a frown, ready to tell his best friend off, because clearly Draco was trying to make an effort here, and laughing at him was certainly not going to prompt any further words of regret.
in me or anything. It’s a personal issue, I get that. But…” He chewed on his lower lip, and blast Draco’s traitorous eyes, they immediately zeroed in on the motion.
Secondly, with his gaze still solely focused on Draco, that automatic step backwards turned into an automatic
“No, it did. I just didn’t do it.”
Almost.
, a voice at the back of Draco’s mind whispered, sounding a disturbing amount like Blaise, or maybe even Pansy. But, at that moment, Draco coldn’t care less whether he was acting suspicious or not. This was exactly what Draco had feared would happen; they’d get into a row and one way or another, Potter would discover what had grown to become Draco’s greatest secret.
aren’t enough. You have to be fully in love with your soulmate for a soulmark to turn into an actual name.”
don’t.”
anywhere. Plus, Harry felt distinctly uncomfortable in his own soaked sweater and trousers, and he figured he probably ought to go change too.
I don't even have anything else to say, just...
me what’s wrong—”
“Exactly,” Harry simply agreed, “so you can’t claim you already hate it. I’ll teach you the basics first. It’s easy, trust me. And afterwards I’ll go easy on you, at least at the beginning—but once you get the hang of it, prepare to be destroyed.”
“Sounds like a plan. I’ll be in touch.”
Then, surprisingly, Weasley turned to Draco and said, voice oddly gentle, “It isn’t your fault. And when Harry wakes up, he’ll be glad you’re here.”
And another spell, this time blue, shot out of his wand at Harry, and the latter ducked just in time to see the spell melt into the invisible walls Harry’d (single-handedly!) set up minutes before.
for this, Harry,” he gritted out. “So, please, for Salazar’s sake, come
Weasley obliged, but he only drew back a step, eyes all the while never straying from his best mate’s face for even a second, as though afraid he might vanish in a puff of smoke if he did—and before Harry could so much as inhale, one particularly frizzy-haired Hermione had already flung herself into his recently-vacated arms.
Conversation had resumed all around him, but it stopped when he said suddenly, “Sorry, but can I have a few minutes alone with Auror Malfoy? There are a few things we need to discuss in private, if that’s okay.”
So when none other than the Malfoy matriarch stepped through the Floo, face as smooth as ever, silvery hair falling in elegant curls to her tailbone, white skirts fluttering around her ankles as though carried by some phantom wind…well, Draco figured his reaction—namely almost falling off the couch where he’d until seconds ago sat curled up against his soulmate, the latter’s head resting on his shoulder—was perfectly understandable.
“Sir?” he asked and gave a third, sharper rap. “Sir, it’s Draco Malfoy. You wanted to speak with me?”
Draco’s mouth was already open, an insult at the ready. But then Potter reached out for his best friend, patting his shoulder comfortingly, like a mother appeasing her moody child. “Ron, it’s fine. He’s supposed to stay with me 24/7, remember? Just…talk quietly, I guess.”
Draco glanced at Harry, only to find him standing still as a statue, rooted to the spot, looking at Nic with an expression impossible to describe. It was panic, definitely, and a sliver of guilt, because this was
Harry opened his mouth. Closed it. “I know.”
“Well, congratulations, Lav,” Harry said, smiling over at her. “You’ve earned it.”
Besides, Harry hadn’t lied before; they hadn’t had a good start, but he was slowly but surely coming to see Draco Malfoy as a real friend, for all that may entail now and in the future. If Harry had any say in the matter—and he’d bloody well make sure he did—he wouldn’t allow that to be lost.
Draco had no clue what might have instigated this sudden about-face, but he wasn’t about to complain. “Right. Sure. You do that. I’ll just…” He motioned towards the door, then quickly clamped his hand over his soulmark again, as though some reporter from the Daily Prophet might be lurking under the bed, camera at the ready.
Harry blinked. Draco bloody Malfoy was standing there, in Harry’s hospital room, looking overdressed as ever and stiff as a board. He wore that same snooty scowl that'd driven Harry mad all throughout their years at Hogwarts, and yet simultaneously appeared as though he couldn't be more uncomfortable if he tried.
At the time Draco had been much too scared of his aunt Bellatrix and bloody
Harry blinked, so startled by the course of his own thoughts that he only realised he’d practically admitted defeat when the Slytherin’s lips quirked weakly at the sides—not even a tenth the size of his usual smirk, though, which sent yet another pang of confusion through Harry’s mind.
What was left was nothing but rage.
“So, Nic,” he said, firmly shutting down all thoughts of Draco sodding Malfoy. He was on a
Had something happened? Draco’s gaze shifted to the door. It was locked, with no signs of forced entry. But there were other ways to enter an apartment, especially if you had magic on your side.
But instead of giving voice to his thoughts, Draco simply snapped, “No. I’m going home.”
Draco’s glower was truly something for the history books. “You are a dead man, Potter. You hear me? A
The horror must have been evident on his face, for Harry’s voice sounded increasingly less confident and increasingly more panicked as he said, “One last chance, Yaxley. Let. Him. Go.”
And before anyone could say anything else, she turned on her heel and stalked right back down the hallway, never looking back once.
For the first time, Harry saw plain shock flash across Draco’s ivory features, accompanied by a pang of panic that made Harry’s gut twist.
, who you tormented in school just for fun, when I had enough shit on my plate as it was—not that you cared. I doubt you do now, either.”
Malfoy blinked, and instantly that detached, indecipherable mask was back as he fixed the letter with an unreadable stare. “Renaults and Co., you said?”
“Come on, it’ll be fun!” A large grin had split Harry’s face, which only made the Slytherin’s eyes narrow…which in turn only made Harry’s grin wider. “You must be as bored as I am; you’ve read that book
There was a short, heavy pause as Seamus just as there always was when they started talking about their time at Hogwarts. Because if there was one thing that overshadowed all else when they thought of their former school, it was the battle that'd been held there, the battle that'd claimed so many innocent lives.
The Slytherin took all the time in the world as he sauntered around the kitchen island to where Harry still stood watching him expectantly, his face all the while unreadable and hopefully not betraying how very much his chest constricted at the mere sight of his soulmate.
He should have known better than to think Draco had changed, that
Harry furrowed his brow, turning to face Draco fully. The blond still had his gaze trained on some unfixed point ahead, chocolate clutched in one hand and wand held loosely in the other, and he looked… Well. Draco looked sad.
Draco’s gaze drifted for the millionth time that night to the closed door across the hallway. Merlin, he really was so royally fucked.
Right?
Philomena scowled, and she spat, “What might your father say, if he knew you were seeking company with a pack of sanctimonious half-blood blood-traitors, boy? Do you think he’d be pleased? I imagine he’d be
Pansy scowled at him, her thick lashes darkening her eyes further. “Oh, sod off, Draco. I can speak just fine. Move, too, with a little bit of effort. And breathe…well, who needs to breathe when you can look like this instead.”
“I don’t know much more than you do.” His voice was…oddly gentle. A gigantic contrast to the venomous hiss it’d been minutes before. “It shouldn’t be possible. But he really is gone. Robards’s already had the whole place searched from top to bottom. Every office on every floor in every building. There’s no sign of him anywhere.” He inhaled deep. “No one knows how he did it. One moment Takeuchi was in there with him, questioning him, then they left the room for five minutes—and when they came back in, Yaxley was gone. You—”
The notion was both exhilarating and terrifying all at once.
He was interrupted by a snort. Only it wasn’t light-hearted like Draco’s had been, and instead much more bitter, more derisive. Just like that, Ginny pulled away again, stepping back as she folded her arms and glared up at Harry.
Draco drew in a long breath through his nose and exhaled again, obviously suppressing the urge to insult Harry further. Harry was surprised; he hadn’t thought Draco capable of such restraint.
Harry made an impatient sound. He loved Ron, he really did, but
Narcissa’s tone, however, was the definition of innocent. “Oh, I’m sorry, was that too
“What do you mean ‘threatened’?” he asked, silver eyes narrowed.
When hit with Sectumsempra in Sixth Year, Draco had reacted too slowly. Sometimes, when the nights were particularly bad and sleep proved especially impossible, he’d lay awake thinking about that day in the bathroom. The white flash speeding towards him; the indescribable agony ripping through his very core, worse than any pain he’d ever experienced before or since the incident, Voldemort’s occasional Crucio sessions included; and the sight of Harry Potter before Draco’s vision went black, standing there, wide-eyed and white as Draco’s shirt had been before it soaked crimson, his wand still raised in dazed horror.
“Don’t be disheartened—Gryffindors just generally tend to have smaller brains then the rest of the world. It’s not your fault. Although, I have to admit, your brain is at least bigger than Weasley’s. Honestly, how Granger put up with the two of you for so long is frankly a wonder to me.” Draco sniffed primly, before taking another large gulp of Butterbeer. The sweetness of it made his mouth quirk dangerously, but he repressed a smile. After all, he was scolding Potter—a smile had no place in that image. “Also, caramel is the most delicious thing invented since chocolate, and I will not have you tell me otherwise, Saviour of the wizarding world or no.”
Since that day, Draco had promised himself that would never happen again. He would not react too slowly when faced with another life-or-death situation, not ever, regardless of whether it was his safety or his mother’s or that of a friend that was on the line.
pissed!”
“Fucking hell!” Harry heard Ron exclaim on the other side of the light, and he immediately went for his wand, ready to dive under the table and pull his best friend with him.
“What?” he repeated, softer this time, gentler, and they now stood so close Harry could see every detail of those maddening eyes, the scattered flecks of pale, pale blue, the dark circles surrounding those silver orbs.
And although Draco knew all this, even he was taken aback by the wisdom of her words, as though she had decades upon decades of life experience to draw from instead of her actual twenty-one.
Draco could practically
“Harry,” said Weasley. “You’re not dead. Oh, thank
Harry snorted, and, without glancing back at Malfoy again, traversed the apartment to the kitchen. There, he opened the fridge, taking his time rifling through its contents, all the while humming under his breath the Weird Sisters song Ron had forced him to listen to the other day whilst the two Aurors filled out reports regarding their case.
shoulder.
. There was a large cactus sitting in a corner by the windows, little flowers blooming all over its prickly green skin. On the other side of the room was a naked brick wall, propped up to which was a large four-poster bed.
Draco didn’t know how long he stood there, clutching his mug of chamomile tea, which still steamed and fumed, tendrils coiling and twirling in the air with deceptive ease, as though the world hadn’t just went crashing and burning in this very kitchen.
. We are not—
Draco was silent for a few long seconds, and Harry’s heart raced and pounded and stumbled over its own beat, and he wondered dimly when he’d become so absolutely
Because him, Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater and all-round foul git, he would never have that. Fate had, like so often in his life already, decided he wasn’t worthy of a nice, sweet, straightforward path, and had instead reached right into his chest, ripped out his heart, dropped it into a box, locked said box, and thrown Harry bloody Potter of all people the key.
At this, Draco stopped dead in his tracks. “She…what?” Narcissa Malfoy had practically not set foot outside of Malfoy Manor since the day of Lucius’ trial, so for her to have actually made the journey to St. Mungo’s, where the hallways teemed with people and any single one of them could be a hateful sadist ready to throw all the Malfoys’ failures back at them with a few well-aimed insults—it was enormous.
While on the subject of soulmates; Harry still hadn’t entirely gotten over the fact that most of the people around the table had already found their soulmates, who were, for the most part, sitting right beside them. Hermione had Ron, Seamus had Dean, Neville had Luna. Lavender’s wrist displayed a
Harry was too stunned to reply. The icy drawl, the sneer, the glare—it reminded Harry far too much of Hogwarts-era-Draco, of Draco-the-blood-purist, of
The idea was so ludicrous Harry grabbed the collar of Draco’s ruined shirt and yanked him closer just to show that he could, that he wasn’t some fragile piece of china to be handled with the utmost caution. And Draco seemed to understand, for his hand travelled from where it had been cupping Harry’s jaw to the back of his neck, pulling him in as well.
Draco’s attention shifted back to Harry. Whatever warmth and happiness that might have existed before Nic’s arrival had disappeared without a trace, leaving in its wake nothing but dark, tired smudges under those usually so brilliant green eyes and lines of exhaustion a newly-minted twenty-year-old had no business exhibiting.
Draco stilled, and his eyes went impossibly wide. He didn’t speak, he didn’t move an inch, he didn’t even breathe.
People didn’t just
“Harry, please. I’ll make it quick, I promise. I just—” Her voice broke, and Harry could feel a sudden burst of worry wash over him. “I just need to talk to you.”
Plenty of people—who had far less business knowing Potter’s birthday than Draco did, mind you—knew tomorrow was the day the Saviour turned twenty. Every media outlet in wizarding Britain had been endlessly gushing about it for weeks now, how tomorrow the first letter of Harry Potter’s soulmate would appear on his wrist. If Draco cared at all about the git, which he
Silence.
“Yes, you do. You’re going to shut up now,” the blond repeated, “and you’re going to let me finish, alright? Trust me, you’ll want to hear this.”
He didn’t need to know Draco missed him even when they were in the same room.
The tip of a wand dug into Draco’s throat, and he scrambled for his own. But his attacker simply laughed and kicked Draco’s wand across the street, a cold, merciless laugh that sent shivers running down Draco’s spine. He froze, going completely still. Because—fuck, he
“Anyway, I’d just returned from a few errands when they arrived, and. Well.” The Slytherin gave a mirthless laugh. “I suppose you could say I didn’t take it particularly well at first. But Granger showed up less than five minutes later, and she…helped.” His eyes took in Harry, and his mouth quirked into the ghost of a smile. “Long story short, I went to look for you, and I found you. Not that you made it very easy, mind you.”
“Fine,” he hissed, forcing himself to straighten himself up again, shoulders back, chin high.
—but I’ll make sure Timmy The Intern owls you before Ginny Weasley, yeah? That way you get your dramatic moment at your beloved’s deathbed before his ex-beloved shows up and inevitably steals the spotlight.”
An inexplicable ache tightened around Draco’s heart, but he swallowed down the hurt that enveloped him whole when Harry, who’d been laughing and smiling and calling him
Blaise nodded severely. “My apologies. Let me rephrase that: What has our favourite Saviour been doing to pass his time in this prison of a hospital, save for snogging Draco? Please, I’m genuinely interested. Three whole days cooped up in here—I’d have never thought you capable of such a feat.”
you find me? I never told you where we were going. Hell,
, Potter, I mean
As always, thank you so much for reading, and thank you even more for your kudos and comments!
He braced himself for another curse, but when a few seconds passed and none came, his gaze slowly lifted to that of his attacker.
“Draco went to the Ministry,” he said slowly, and although it was more him thinking aloud than anything else, every person in the room seemed to hold their breath. “And Hermione and Ron came over. That’s…all I can remember.”
There was a beat of silence. Then, Pansy grinned.
Draco didn’t know much, but he did know one thing: Ronald Weasley was the biggest, most insufferable arsehole in the world.
But although he really, really wanted to, he didn’t. He just stood there, unable to move, unable to speak, unable to do
“Then all the better,” answered Blaise staunchly, his determination not wavering in the slightest under Draco’s incredulous glare. “No, I’m serious, Draco, this is getting ridiculous. You could not be more obviously in love with him, to the point that, were this not Harry Potter we’re talking about, I’d call it impossible he hasn’t noticed anything yet.”
But Harry didn’t let that dissuade him. “Look, I know I shouldn’t have left without telling someone where I’d gone. Thing is, Draco and I sort of had a row beforehand, so I wasn’t overly keen to talk to him. So. There’s that.” He winced apologetically. “I’ll do better next time?”
scenes of mass destruction and bloodshed? This just seemed counterproductive.
And before Draco could even process those words, the unmistakable tip of a wand bored itself into the back of his skull, and a deep, calm voice purred just above his ear, “Drop the wand, Malfoy.”
First and foremost, it wasn’t Weasley or Hermione that had been supposed to protect Harry—it had been
Draco had not planned on going to Diagon Alley that evening. As a matter of fact, his plans had consisted wholly of lying in his bed back at Malfoy Manor, curled up in his favorite silk pyjamas with the embarrassingly sappy novel his mother had gifted him for his birthday, shoveling chocolate pralines into his mouth and feeling generally sorry for himself, thank you very much.
For the first and likely the last time in his life, Draco was glad his stupid tacky Auror robes had a stupid tacky hood built-in, and he let go of Harry’s hand just long enough to lift it up. The Gryffindor, however, didn’t notice, simply stood there, staring up at his apartment building with a concentrated look that scrunched up his nose in the most sickeningly adorable way. Either he didn’t care he was getting soaked—if so, good riddance—or he simply hadn’t realised yet it was raining cats and dogs and every creature in between.
Harry didn’t wait for the Dancing Feet Spell to completely wear off, and so the moment he scrambled to his feet again, he was running across the living room, trying to get as much space between him and one fuming Draco Malfoy as humanly possible.
Harry frowned. “Err…”
Anger had so many different faucets, so many different faces. There were more ways to hurt someone than one could possibly count, more than a million ways to make a person pay. Draco knew that all too well, knew it and had experienced it himself.
“First of all, what the
Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again, suddenly feeling Nic’s grief as acutely as if it were his own. Losing loved ones in the war was something he knew plenty about. “I’m so sorry. That’s terrible.”
And Draco didn’t think that twisting feeling in his chest had ever been so bad before.
Draco didn’t bother replying, his mind racing as fast as his heart. He needed a plan, and quick. Yaxley’s footsteps were drawing closer by the second, and it didn’t look like anyone would be coming to help him subdue the Death Eater, not if the man had managed to surprise even Robards.
Hello and welcome back to another chapter of Harry The Oblivious Moron vs. Draco The Love-Sick Puppy! I hope you're all doing well and not too stressed and are looking forward to the holidays as much as I am.
. All those years—and then—and
more times than he could count! And yet, even then, he couldn’t remember any of them being quite so…
And therein laid the problem. The reason Draco still hadn’t knocked, the reason he felt so damn nervous.
Narcissa scowled at him, but there was no actual irritation in her eyes—quite the opposite. “That, and the fact that Pansy recently informed me my one and only son had finally secured himself the soulmate he’d been pining after for years now
Harry loved Draco. Perhaps this emotion was new, perhaps he always had—it didn’t matter. All that mattered now was that Harry knew it, and so would Draco.
He proceeded to stroll over to the fireplace, and he plopped down on his favourite armchair before digging into the rice. It didn’t matter it wasn’t fresh—it still tasted divine, and Harry sighed contentedly as he shoved yet another forkful of the heavenly food into his mouth.
At that, Draco paled, and his left hand immediately flew to his right wrist. “No one saw?”
But Draco was already continuing, that familiar crease having already formed in between his eyebrows, and Harry knew the Slytherin was properly vexed now before he’d uttered a single word. “That man is an arsehole of the worst sort; not only is he a bastard, he’s also so revoltingly fake it makes me sick. I did you a
-ness of it, because, let’s be honest, the Boy Who Lived Twice had never in his life learned the art of subtlety. It wasn’t his fault, Draco knew that, had realised it years ago, when childhood jealousy and bitter rivalry started morphing into something more, something stronger, yet in no way or form any less intense. But it was as much a fact of life as the Gryffindor’s short temper and messy hair and absolutely atrocious table manners—and Draco knew Harry would not be Harry without it.
pay attention?’
“Harry,” said the Slytherin, sounding surprised but at the same time also undeniably amused. “You’re here. Right here. In front of my door. Why, pray tell, are you here, right here, in front of my door?” Suddenly, he froze, and his smile slipped. “Wait, is something wrong? Did you hear any strange sounds? See something unusual?”
But now—now he looked very much nervous, with his drawn face and rumpled hair, as though he’d either gotten stuck in a windstorm or simply raked his fingers through it one too many times, even going so far as to fiddle with the sleeves of his robe. It was almost like something a
confide in me. You don’t have to, but you
This one's a doozy.
“I never said I—”
Blaise looked once at Harry, once at Pansy, expression all the while appalled, and then proceeded to let out the most colossal and weary sigh known to humankind. “Bloody
Robards’ eyes were stormy. “Trying to figure out who recently tried to kill one of my best Aurors, Harry. As I’m sure you already know, you were poisoned with Acturin. That particular poison is hard to come by, not to mention outrageously expensive, so whoever did this should by no means be underestimated—their intent was clearly murder, and a gruesome one at that.”
But then Harry deepened the kiss, and the Slytherin’s brain completely short-circuited.
And yet, damn it all to hell, it was working.
And secondly.
Draco’s head whipped around so fast he risked whiplash, and he started blinking furiously, willing the spots to go away, heart all the while raging against his ribcage with its wild beat, because was that, could it be—
The door swung open with an ominous creak, and Draco’s eyes immediately scoured every free surface, every nook and every cranny, from one side of the office to the other.
An image that,
And yet, he hesitated.
what you’re so concerned about? Merlin and Morgana, all this foreboding, and it turns out all you care about is doing your job. For a second there I thought you genuinely cared.”
“This is a horrible idea,” Draco said for about the fiftieth time. “One of these days you really are going to get yourself killed, because, frankly, I’m starting to tire of this whole bodyguard-business. Salazar, I’m beginning to feel like a bloody
“Draco. So good to see you again,” she said, smiling back at him, the one action brightening up her entire face, making her look years and years younger. As though the last four years had never happened, as though she were still the same Narcissa she’d been before the war. Draco didn’t have the words to express how very much he sometimes missed that Narcissa.
. It was a subject everyone tried best to avoid, even Ron. Especially Ron. Not that Harry and Ginny were on unfriendly terms, exactly. It was all just…very complicated indeed, and Harry decided there really was no reason to torture himself with such thoughts, not when tomorrow was his bloody birthday.
,” Hermione gushed, grinning widely as she took his head from across the table and squeezed it reassuringly. “Oh, there are just so many possibilities! At this table alone, two people have names starting with the letter D. Of, course, Dean is already taken, but Dominic…" She was quick to continue when she saw Harry's warning look. "You know, statistically speaking, there’s an eighty-two percent chance you already know your soulmate. Who else do we know that starts with the letter D?”
They sat there on the hospital bed, hands intertwined, gazes interlocked, and Harry couldn’t help but marvel at how utterly
Nic made an effort to smile, although he was still visibly uncomfortable as he gingerly settled into the armchair. “Water’s absolutely fine. Thanks.”
, by penalty of death. And so I asked her a few questions, because no one’s really explained any of this to me except maybe you, but there’re still so many unknowns, and I—”
A few moments passed, but then the door to the guest room opened and out shuffled a scowling, grumbling Malfoy. He immediately glared at Harry, ignoring the letter still gripped tightly in his hands. “I am not a
Harry was vaguely aware that the conversation had started back up again around him. Or perhaps ‘argument’ would be more fitting, but he wasn’t paying attention anymore. All his focus was pinned on the man with the platinum blond hair and silver eyes, who in turn stared back at Harry as though he were some sort of ghost—and not the friendly type either.
Right into the next.
Blaise shook his head, still grinning, but Draco didn’t miss how his left hand surreptitiously flew to his right wrist, tugging at the sleeve of his white healer robes. Instead of a name, his soulmark was still nothing but a simple
Ginny looked up, brown eyes wide and rimmed with red, and one moment they were standing a few feet apart, Ginny in front of the door, Harry in the doorway, and the next she’d flung herself into his arms, sobbing as she buried her face into his chest.
“Tell me what’s going on,” said Harry, but the words didn’t carry half the gentleness they usually would. No, he was still too angry at the prick for
“Stupefy!”
, one of the most amazing, fierce and all-round incredible people he’d ever met… How could he possibly be with anyone else, ever?
about, lest he get his hopes up.
Ginny pursed her lips. “Well, yes, but Harry—”
Draco couldn’t say why he hesitated, why something in him told him no, wait,
“It’s an expression, Granger. A figure of speech. I thought
“Oh, just let him,” said Healer Hodkinson, smiling at Harry. “The boy deserves a bit of rest, after everything he’s been through.”
Granger still wouldn’t stop looking at him, but Draco didn’t even mind anymore. His mind was already racing, just as fast, if not faster, than his heart, and so he barely heard her as she said, “You are surprisingly good for him, Draco Malfoy. I never thought I’d say that, but it’s the undeniable truth. Don’t make both of you miserable just because you’re too scared of the alternative.”
But it was the picture that drew Draco’s attention. It had likely been snapped right before Potter’s latest near-death-experience, he realized. Draco had only ever seen Potter as genuinely comfortable as he was in the picture when in the company of his friends, and while that usually would have irked Draco to no end, he found himself silently smiling down at picture-Potter’s humongous grin.
Well.
“Seriously, what happened to you?” Harry asked and took a step forward. “Are you ill? Hurt? Did someone attack you? I can Side-Along you to St. Mungo’s right away if you think you’re up for it—”
Draco would sooner cut off his own hand than leave Harry.
,” Harry said, and the fierce certainty both in his gaze and his tone made Draco’s heart sing. “I just don’t see how it’s anyone’s business at all who my apparent soulmate is—especially because
, no less.”
I mean honestly.
But then Harry shook his head, as though awakening from a trance, and confusion overtook his face again. He grinned awkwardly and shook his head. “Err, yeah. Sorry, I don’t know what came over me.” He offered Hayes a polite incline of the head. “See you around, Nic. And sorry again.”
Nic gave a half-hearted shrug. “Yeah, well, it’s been a few years. It’s just hard, is all. And it doesn’t get easier, no matter what people tell you.”
“What’s that about Draco’s love?” came a sudden voice, and Draco dropped his head in his hands with a groan as Blaise appeared through the crowd and slid into the booth next to Harry. Draco had very nearly done so himself when they first arrived in the café, however, in light of Pansy’s knowing smirk, his own nerves and Harry’s, well,
“The attack was the day before yesterday. I was discharged yesterday morning. You, Potter, slept a full twenty-four hours. Congratulations. Didn’t even think
“Come
Draco—he could do that. He
, otherwise, I swear to god, we’ll ban you from the shop for life.”
But watching Harry get practically strangled by the ginger’s fierce bear-hug, emerald eyes practically bulging out of their sockets as he mouthed at Draco over Weasley’s bony shoulder ‘Help me’—all Draco could do when faced with that image was laugh.
The Slytherin made a muffled little sound of surprise, eyes widening ever so slightly in alarm. But Harry just held up a hand, and Draco didn’t interrupt.
That might cause Harry to re-evaluate his previous statement on not being as undateable as a potato after all.
And just like that, Pansy started cackling—yes,
Yes, Blaise had been right, it wasn’t just them, it was them and the rest of the world, and there were so, so,
“However,” said Narcissa, expression hard, “something did happen that you should know about. Lucius was threatened.”
But, really, who could blame him? After Hermione, Draco Malfoy was the scariest person Harry knew, and that was a fact.
with it.”
Except Draco
What he felt first and foremost, primarily, above all else—that was hurt.
“Salazar, just get the bloody door already, you menace.”
Another pulse of silence.
Narcissa’s answering smile held not a smidgeon of smugness or complacency as she inclined her head, and instead was one of complete and utter warmth and love and
Besides, Harry had Hermione and Weasley watching over him, so Draco really shouldn’t be worrying so. He was being irrational, as always when it came to his soulmate. To be honest, getting this whole blasted mystery-wound-fiasco wrapped up before Harry got wind of it was probably the best option for all parties involved anyway.
.” As though that were a sufficient explanation.
(I'm sorry)
, that he was right there and would bloody well
The man glowered at Draco with such intense ferocity, Draco found his hand twitching towards his wand. The hairs on his arms stood on end. All other noises in the pub, the chatter, the laughter, the clinking of glasses and cutlery—all that which had previously clouded Draco’s senses faded into the background, and he could only think, if this Nic lunged for him now, how quickly he might reach his wand.
Then there was Ginny.
! But since you so clearly don’t have any intention of hearing me out, since you obviously care more about
But actually implementing and then
But then the Gryffindor’s mouth twitched up to the side. “Me, a bad influence?” The words were barely more than a whisper, and yet they felt ridiculously loud in the static silence of the corridor. That crooked smile widened even more. “Fine, if you insist.”
And Draco might not have known whether or not this was his last day assigned as Harry’s bodyguard. He might not have known what the future held in store for them, whether all this would last, whether, when this all ended, he’d be enough to protect the man he loved.
And yet.
They both stopped midsentence, grimacing as that god-awful silence engulfed the table yet again, even more uncomfortable than before, if such a thing was at all possible.
. Still not over the Saviour, are you? It’s been, what, three years since you broke up? Honestly, I’d say it’s high time you got over it, Weasley, lest you run the risk of becoming, shall we say, obsessed.”
“Come out, Draco,” cooed an eerily familiar voice, and Draco briefly closed his eyes, jaw set, cursing his constant and seemingly unending bad luck.
But Harry didn’t notice. “We actually came here from Knockturn Alley. Got a lead on the Acturin used to poison me the other day.” Any other time, Draco would have said something about the frankly concerning amount of cheerfulness with which Harry talked about his own attempted murder. “And you? Enjoying your vacation?”
—he’d ever thought up over the years came close to how absolutely bloody
The notion alone sent such a powerful bolt of dread through Harry’s body that he found himself stepping forwards just to show the blond that he could, that he
“But not only that, am I right?” There was a pause. “Tell me, does Mr. Potter know you bear his name on your wrist?”
—which, honestly, was an anomaly all in its own, something he had never,
Draco had to repress a cry of pain as the blade procured from nowhere dug deeper into his esophegus, making it increasingly hard to breathe without cutting open his own throat. Yaxley only held the blade tighter.
God, no human being should have such extraordinary eyes, it was downright unnatural—
Hermione immediately whacked him on the arm and started scolding her boyfriend, which in turn had Weasley scowling but ultimately muttering a half-hearted apology. But Draco wasn’t paying attention anymore, too deep in thought to care.
Harry chose his next words carefully, unwilling to destroy the small but definite step forwards he felt they’d just made. “I appreciate the concern, Malfoy. No, really,” he insisted when the blond scoffed. “Honest, I do. It’s just…I can’t sit in my flat until the culprit is caught. Who knows how long that’ll be? It could be weeks.
And before either of them could indulge in any more awkward conversation, the doors down the hallway were thrown open, and in rushed a pack of about a dozen panic-stricken, frantic-looking Gryffindors.
Harry’s friends had all bounced back relatively quickly, even the Weasleys, although Fred’s loss was something Harry knew as a fact none of them were ever going to get over, not now, three years later, nor in ten more years, nor in a hundred. It was the same with everyone he’d lost: not just Fred, but Sirius as well, Remus, Dumbledore, Dobby, Tonks—the list went on and on. Harry had sworn to himself on the day of the Battle, as the dust cleared and the world settled, as, for the first time in years, people no longer had to fear for their lives but could finally be safe, be free, be
Harry’s chest warmed every time he thought about the night Ron had finally popped the question. If there was any guarantee Harry’s soulmate would fit so perfectly with him as Hermione and Ron did, then he’d probably be excited rather than fearful of what tomorrow might bring.
. He was back to Malfoy. The word felt like a dagger to the heart; never before had his surname sounded so disgusting.
“It was such a pleasure,” the Slytherin said charmingly. “Have a good day.”
Harry’s brow furrowed. “Owls?”
“Yes, yes, Potter, I’m well-aware,” snapped the blond, and
Harry looked up, directly at Draco, and there was no accusation in his gaze, no anger or blame, yet Draco felt like recoiling. The sheer rawness in those emerald eyes was so intense it made him dizzy.
Harry had emergency plans in case someone decided to break into his flat, had since the day he first visited the apartment. There were more than a few alarms set to dissuade any would-be burglars from actually breaking in, plus more protection and Anti-Apparation wards than was likely considered appropriate. But Harry had long since stopped caring about trivialities like what was ‘considered appropriate’—he’d been hunted by Voldemort and his followers for most of his life, so, as Harry saw it, he had every right to be slightly paranoid, thank you very much.
Hermione’s eyebrows lifted a fraction. “Sandwiches? As in plural?”
The notion of being kicked off the case sent a surge of pure dread racing through Draco’s entire body, from his head to his stomach all the way to his toes. He couldn’t get kicked off, not now, not when Harry still
Harry exited the restaurant with the accustomed feeling of multiple dozen pairs of eyes on him, but he couldn’t bring himself to care, not when he could sense Draco walking just behind him, could practically feel the git’s breath on his neck.
At this, Harry’s lips finally settled on one singular expression—mainly, a scowl. Except he was still blushing furiously, so the whole effort was rather futile from the start, and Draco could only grin wider.
Not that that was even an option now.
And Harry didn’t protest any further.
But Draco didn’t care. He didn’t care if she hexed him, didn’t care about anything, and so he didn’t so much as glance her way. Rage churned within him, almost overpowering the panic and fear warring in his chest—almost, but not quite.
His hands went up to tangle in Harry’s hair, and in response the latter’s grip on his shirt collar tightened, pulling him closer. Not that Draco could have moved if he’d wanted to (which, it should be stressed, he did not); the wall pressing against his back and the Harry crowded against his front effectively held him in place.
Nic, it seemed, must have called upfront and reserved a table for them at the back of the restaurant, which was less packed than the rest of it. Plus, the view was amazing; one wall was completely made of glass, so that you could enjoy a perfect view of the city below as you ate, of the lights and buildings and cars and people, of the hustle and bustle that never ended, not even when the sun set and the moon and stars lit up the night sky instead.
And it was good that he did, for when he slowly made his way around the desk and peeked behind, it was the sight of Robards’ limp, motionless body that awaited him there.
“Helps him work off stress,” Harry added helpfully…and immediately cursed himself as six pairs of eyes shifted to him, six pairs of eyebrows raised high.
Draco blinked. There was silence for a moment, and Draco expected anger to come surging and bubbling within him, for him to explode with more words he didn’t actually mean and would later doubtlessly regret. But none came, nothing at all. There was only shock, and a tightness in his chest that made it hard to breathe.
During his years at Hogwarts, it had been a recurring joke amongst the Gryffindors that Harry practically lived in the Hospital Wing. And although Harry had always maintained he was not to blame for it, there was no denying the accuracy of that particular statement. After leaving the school, Harry had hoped that’d be the last of it. However, he thought as he found himself for the second time that week sitting in a bright, spotless hospital room in St. Mungo’s, trying to keep his eyes open after a long night of no sleep, some things simply never changed.
The heavy silence crept back in, and Draco still wouldn’t look at Harry, still looked so sad, so miserable, so hopeless, and Harry hated it, hated it with every fibre of his being. Just minutes before the joy on the Slytherin’s face had been near-radiant, his eyes aglow with happiness as they’d dodged each other’s hexes, laughing as though they really didn’t have a care in the world.
Harry had always been the type of person to act first, think never. He’d always been just a tad bit reckless, just a tad bit impatient, always done what he felt was right, consequences be damned. After all, you only had one life, so you’d better live it to the fullest or risk regretting it later.
“Hmm,” came Yaxley’s voice, even closer this time. Draco squeezed his eyes shut. Fuck fuck
The Slytherin’s eyes narrowed, and for a moment Harry feared another argument might break out, this time in the limited, confined space of his living room.
“So what happened to you?” he said jokingly. “You look like you took on a Hungarian Horntail and lost. Nasty buggers, those are. Can’t recommend.”

had caused that blush, that self-conscious little flicker, that small but impossibly radiant smile.
He knew he ought to feel something at the sight of Yaxley’s broken, limp body, be that triumph or hatred or anger or sadness, however unlikely that last one was. After all, all the man had ever brought Draco was death and misfortune. Had Yaxley’s plan succeeded, Draco would currently be without a soulmate.
“Bloody hell, he really doesn’t remember a thing,” Ron said, voice strangled.
“Draco,” he replied with a smile, hoping it was enough to mask how his heartrate had gone up despite himself, making his gut twist in apprehension.
“Oh, will you look at that,” Yaxley’s cheerful, oddly distant voice swam through Draco’s head. “Seems the Moonroot is taking effect quicker than I’d expected it to. I’d wager our young scion has perhaps ten more minutes or so before his condition reaches critical, thirty before it’s entirely too late.”
that Harry felt like bursting into laughter right then and there in the dingy alley, and he likely would have, were it not for the fact that he knew with utmost certainty that Draco would murder him if he did. Forget Yaxley, facing Draco’s Slytherin wrath was the most terrifying thing Harry’s confusion-addled brain could come up with.
Draco scowled, not because he was actually angry, but because this whole situation was making him much more nervous than any situation had the right to make him.
And now he was paying the price. A Death-Eater.
“It’s okay. Just…let me know if something important happens, yeah?”
“Anyway,” said Pansy then, and when Harry turned back to her, her grin had widened. “He certainly wasn’t exaggerating the state of your flat. Salazar’s balls, Potter, I could take off my jacket and
He still couldn’t quite wrap his mind around it all, if only because it still felt too surreal to be true. And how could it be, after all the years Draco had spent wishing for it to happen? After all the years of knowing Harry hated him, so it’d always have to stay just that—a fantasy?
Draco shook his head, as though that might rid him of the depressing thoughts that had begun to cloud in. “Anyway, what was that you said yesterday about letting bygones be bygones? Let’s not talk about all that anymore.” He gave a smirk and picked up the newspaper again. “Says here your smile ‘melts a witch’s heart faster than the breath of a Chinese Fireball’. So, a little more of that and a little less of those ridiculous puppy eyes, yeah?”
there’ve been so far on his life.”
“Hmm.”
But then, finally, the blond nodded stiffly and averted his eyes, a slight scowl still twisting across his face. “Fine.”
Through the flames, Draco could see Yaxley’s gaunt face, distorted with rage, those hollow black eyes glinting with such pure hatred it sent a shudder down Draco’s spine. His eyes narrowed and, with an especially ferocious growl, Yaxley threw himself forwards, towards the flames, hands reaching out for Draco.
“You’ve lost, Yaxley,” a voice came from across the alleyway. Draco’s mind only later recognized it as Harry’s—and that’s when he knew for sure he was in trouble. “Aurors will be here any moment now, and they’ll catch you and throw you back into Azkaban the instant they see you. So, if you want any hope of escaping, you’ll let him go now, and leave while you still can.”
He just hoped said change would be for the better.
Nic gave him a small grateful smile in return, although the painful tinge to it was unmistakable. “Nothing

When they were done, Weasley’s expression had, if possible, darkened further. Granger, on the other hand, simply looked tired, her lips a thin line of worry as she glanced from Potter to Draco, then back at Potter. Even her usually so bushy hair had lost a bit of its bounciness. And the Savior…he looked nervous. Yes, that was the only word Draco could think to describe Potter’s tight-lipped expression. Not that Draco could blame him.
There was a round of silence, and suddenly Harry very much missed the carefree atmosphere from before, even if that did entail Pansy and Blaise making fun of him; he’d take that over this grim feeling of
And, yes, okay, he knew that technically wasn’t how things worked, but, whatever the reason, the fact stood that Harry simply did not cry.
Harry didn’t hesitate. “Of course. Completely.”
Well, save for one thing.

him they had. They wouldn’t abuse his trust like that.
“Answer the question, ferret,” barked a man Draco recognized as Seamus Finnigan, yet another of Potter’s old Gryffindor posse. “What did you do to Harry?”
They were the first words Nic spoke to him, and the other man’s voice sounded incredibly different all of a sudden, so much so Harry stopped speaking immediately, stunned into silence. Nic’s voice was as hard and cold as his eyes, and it was such a stark change from his usual warmth that Harry was left gaping.
But before he could finish, Hermione shot him a warning look over her shoulder. He stopped midsentence and frowned but, in a rare moment of wisdom, immediately closed his mouth again with nothing but a small, petulant huff.
He brushed a strand of hair from Harry’s forehead and looked at him, and before he could make the active decision to do so, his thoughts had formed words, words that promptly tumbled out of his mouth in a small, strangled whisper.
His heart drummed against his aching ribcage as he tried to pull himself together and think. Something had happened—that much was obvious. But what? Why did every inch of Harry’s body feel bruised, what did Yaxley have to do with it, and—most importantly—why couldn’t he remember?
In every bloody sense of the word.
Hello there!
Draco swallowed hard, and when he spoke again, his voice was uncharacteristically frail. “She’s going to tell the world, isn’t she?”
Draco didn’t answer for a long, long moment. His eyes simply roamed across Harry’s face, taking in every detail with an intensity, a hunger, as though he were seeing him for the very last time and therefore wanted to commit every line, every curve, every patch of skin to memory.
Harry opened his mouth, but he could think of no suitable response to
Draco gave a bitter huff of a laugh. “Well, he wasn’t when the article was drafted. That whole shebang was added once the news broke. I suppose after a break-in at the Ministry, Head Auror Robards’ attempted murder,
Ron blinked and although his gaze still remained on Draco for a split-second longer, he then turned his attention back to Harry, and nodded. “Sure do. They caught him somewhere on the outskirts of London, in this hovel of an apartment. Apparently the owner died back in the war, and Yaxley knew this and decided he’d set up camp there. Too bad Robards’s had Aurors scoring every inch of the city for days now. He put up a fight, he did, but we outnumbered him twenty-to-one.” Ron looked proud, but Draco didn’t seem in the least impressed.
The instant he was gone, Draco’s sighed dramatically, rolling his eyes as he walked the few steps back to his armchair and fell into it with another especially forceful sigh.

“Philomena. I wish I could say it's a pleasure, but then I'd be lying. The name's Draco Malfoy—though I'm sure you realised that the moment we walked in the door.” The woman’s eyes narrowed and her lips pursed, confirming Draco's suspicions, but he didn’t allow his mask to crack. “I'm sure the both of us would rather this be handled as swiftly as at all possible, so I’m going to make this quick: There was an attempted murder the day before yesterday, one we recently discovered was carried out with the help of the poison commonly known as Acturin. I’m sure you know what I'm talking about, since it was here in this very store said poison was bought. Now, we’d like to know who this mystery buyer was, when they bought the Acturin, and how much of it was sold. It’s rather urgent, too, so if you didn’t put up that much of a fight, it’d be appreciated. And,” he added when the woman opened her mouth, expression indignant, “before you decide to grace us with another series of uninspired insults, Philomena: none of what I just said was a request. We are Aurors employed by the Ministry of Magic—not prey you can bully into submission."

Pansy’s smirk returned in full force, and she flicked a strand of raven hair over her shoulder, looking equal measures haughty and pleased. “Don’t sound so shocked, Potter. I’m full of surprises. And I think, if you’re going to share a flat with my best friend, you really ought to start calling me Pansy.”
He tried to bite back his pain, fixing his best mate with a small if tight smile. But either Ron knew him too well to be fooled (likely) or Harry was simply rubbish at hiding his emotions (even more likely), for the youngest Weasley son immediately flinched.
Harry laughed, but did as he was told, a grin still twisting loosely across his face as he reached the door and pulled it open.
current life—being chased by an escaped Death Eater, forced to stay in his flat for God knows how long, not to mention having to deal with this newest revelation of whatever the fuck it was that he found himself wrangling every time he glanced over at a certain silver-blond Slytherin—at least a tad more bearable.
Because, while Draco sincerely doubted Potter would wake up tomorrow to find the name
Some of the tension in the blond’s shoulders receded at that. He continued, “To be perfectly honest, I don’t remember exactly what I wrote. Mainly I was just angry and wanted answers as to how my father fit into the whole puzzle. Not that I expect him to have actually been of any help.” Draco looked at his mother. “Or am I wrong?”
So, no, Draco was not a brutal man—but at that moment, all he wanted to do was break through the magic barriers keeping Yaxley caged in and the rest of them sealed out, and wring the man’s neck with his bare hands.
leave Harry. He could not, and he would not.
And, just like that, Draco stiffened in his seat, any lingering amusement forgotten. A familiar cold calm settled over his features as he schooled them into perfect inscrutability. “I thought we agreed not to stick our noses in each other’s business, Potter. My soulmark does not concern you. Leave it be.”

Harry lifted his right hand above his face and peered up at his wrist, as if he might be able to see signs of...

soulmark they clam up?”
Ron frowned at that. “But nineteen’s a bloody awful age to be forever. In the States, you can’t even drink yet until you’re twenty-five.”
Draco blinked, surprised, sneer forgotten. “He did?”
“I know we’ve only really been on friendly terms for a week now,” he continued. “But, to be perfectly honest, it seems a lot longer to me. I’m…very thankful we are where we are right now. Not that Yaxley’s actively trying to murder you, of course. But…that we can be friends. I cherish that a lot.”
The poisoning on his birthday; Draco being assigned as his protection; the attack in Diagon after their visit to Renaults and Co; Yaxley’s capture and subsequent escape; him openly admitting his accomplice had orchestrated the Azkaban breakout almost five months ago; Yaxley breaking into Robards’ office and injuring the Head Auror; Draco going after him; Yaxley’s accomplice murdering him in cold blood, only to slice up Harry as well.
He pursed his lips, looking genuinely put out, but then loosened a long and particularly weary sigh. “Fine. I guess, in that case, I probably shouldn’t kill you just yet. Tell you what, I’ll give you two a little push, yeah? See how things progress from there.”
“If you don’t mind me asking, what about?”
“Blimey,” he gasped. “You were

“I am going to kill you. You do realize that, right.”
And it was those last few words that made Potter’s eyes finally clear, and when he locked eyes with Draco, they were back to their usual striking emerald, so green it was nearly inhuman. Draco’s pulse quickened, his chest constricting dangerously. But then a soft smile overtook Potter’s face, smoothing out the harsh lines of his previous anger.

And with that he stood, not for the first nor the last time infinitely grateful he’d been taught to hide his true emotions at such a young age. He didn’t glance even once back at the She-Devil, although he could certainly still feel the weight of her glare in between his shoulder blades. Instead, he grabbed his book and strode right across the room, where Harry immediately looked up when he noticed Draco’s arrival. In midst of the churning anger and wildfire-like panic still roaring through Draco’s person, he was pleased by the instantaneous attention.
‘That you drive me absolutely crazy’?
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry blinked, surprised. “Oh.”
The word elicited an involuntary flinch from Draco, but the youngest Weasley either didn’t notice or didn’t care, for she soldiered on without hesitation.
Before Draco could answer, though, Narcissa answered, “That’s why I came.” She hesitated, looking between Draco and Harry again. “It might be best if we all sit down for this.”
A muffled ‘uff’ escaped Harry, but Hermione didn’t seem to care.
“Mione, love, calm down,” Ron said then, resting a gentle hand on his fiancée’s shoulder, who, much to Harry’s surprise, actually went quiet with an indignant little huff—although Hermione’s glare did not soften, nor did her cross-armed posture become any less rigid. Harry opened his mouth to thank his friend for the interruption…and promptly closed it again when he noted the hard set of Ron’s own mouth. Ron shook his head, and the worry lines creasing his friend’s usually so cheerful face twisted something in the pit of Harry’s stomach.
Draco’s hearing fizzled out during the end of that last sentence, so he couldn’t be exactly sure whether that had been what Yaxley had said. The pain was becoming unbearable and had now engulfed his entire upper body, making it not only progressively impossible to think, but to breathe as well. His head was buzzing and ringing all at once, and he had to blink multiple times just to keep his vision from going as black as the night sky above.
Harry blinked. “Yes?”
No, he thought and his stomach dropped. Scratch that. Tomorrow would

“Out.” Philomena didn’t even blink. Actually, now that Draco thought about it, he wasn’t sure he’d ever seen the woman blink before, not once. Her dark eyes jumped from Jennings, to his partner, to Draco. They remained for a while on Draco, and he was sure she must have recognized him—Malfoy-blond was hardly a common hair colour. But then she turned to glare at Potter, as though Draco was never there. “I said out, the lot of you. I have customers coming in twenty minutes, and I will not have a pack of filthy half-blood Aurors sullying my shop.”
figured it out?! “I was just. Uhm. Harry. You said to notify you when something happened? Yaxley just told Takeuchi where to find the rest of his poisons. Robards’ sending a squad to check it out as we speak. I’d ask if you want to come, but…”
For one afternoon, Draco had allowed himself to relax. He’d listened to Blaise’s stories of all the outlandish maladies he’d encountered so far during his apprenticeship at St. Mungo’s, let Pansy rant about the French designer she was currently apprenticing under and how horrid his temper was, followed Theo’s explanations of the invention he was currently working to perfect, and inquired about whichever magical creature Greg was busy working with over in Scotland. It had been an afternoon of catching up with friends he’d not seen for quite some time now, seeing as, after the war, they’d all made sure to stay well out of the limelight.
Malfoy simply stared at him in utter incredulity.
And at that moment three things happened at once:
“Frankly, Mr. Potter, if you went through with it, I’d be very surprised indeed. We both know you’re too

But he was not, in fact, sick. Quite the contrary, Harry actually felt rather amazing, sort of giddy and exhilarated just standing there in the kitchen with Draco and a few paper bags of chunky takeout as company. So much so that he unthinkingly burst out, “Thank you!”
“Anyway,” Nic continued, either oblivious to Harry’s growing alarm or simply uncaring. “What I’m trying to say is, it sucks. It really does. Here I had this amazing set of ideas, all so thoroughly thought out and researched and planned—and then your Death Eater boyfriend comes along and absolutely trashes

Fucking
Draco had thrown back the covers and flung his legs over the edge of the bed before the rest of his body had opportunity to protest, and by the time vertigo caught up to him, he was already standing. However, it caught up fast, and Draco’s vision went completely dark, and he could feel his legs give out from under him.
And just like that Harry felt his heart sink, plummet down to his feet in a matter of seconds, taking all his previous thoughts and the air out of his lungs with it.
Healer Hodkinson still hovered awkwardly above Harry, wringing his hands as he watched the Gryffindor, looking like he couldn’t decide whether or not to speak. Harry found he was enjoying the latter just fine.
Potter flushed darker. “Yes, I know. I won’t be mad or anything if you don’t want to answer, it’s just… The way you were acting made it seem as though…as though…”
Draco’s eyes softened, and the affection therein—yes,

Harry knew he’d seen the article already; after all, Blaise was the one face Harry had seen day in and day out for the duration of his stay at St. Mungo’s, excluding Draco, Ron and Hermione. Plus, it was true that Harry had been, well…a bit hung up on the article. And that was putting it mildly.
“Yeah,” Lavender agreed slowly. “Much better than ‘Draco Malfoy, the arrogant pureblood bastard that hates all Gryffindors’, that’s for sure.”
Long story short, Draco was nervous. And just a tad scared. And, fine, maybe just a little, tiny, miniscule bit excited. Which was, of course, ridiculous. All of this soulmate-business was bound to end in one great big mess, and it would ultimately be Draco who’d have to clean up the pieces.
“Don’t you have somewhere to be, Potter?” he barked. “Someone else to pester? Like your precious

Ron had just launched into a tale of a case he and Harry had recently taken at the Ministry—some maniac who was running amok in wizarding London, hexing muggleborns and sometimes half-bloods left and right—when Harry’s right wrist started burning. He instantly dropped the chip he’d been lifting to his mouth to stare wide-eyed at his wrist, where warmth now surged through his veins, like flames flickering underneath his skin. It wasn’t painful, exactly, but it had appeared so unexpectedly Harry couldn’t help but hiss.

The rest of their breakfast was actually, genuinely…nice. They talked a bit more, mostly about their respective work at the DMLE, and Quidditch, of course. Draco could have started sobbing in relief when they’d managed to sit through the entire rest of the meal without a single mention of the war, the trials, Hogwarts, or, god forbid,
He meant it as a joke. An ill-timed, hospital-themed, horridly horrible joke that not even Draco’s inborn dry humour could excuse—but a joke nonetheless.
Draco stood with his back to the door and his mug at his lips and waited for Harry to speak, to yell at him and curse him and tell him he was a self-important arse who didn’t deserve his friendship.
Draco shot his friend a dirty glower, which of course only made her grin wider. He scowled, turning his narrowed gaze to Harry, who was already stuffing another madeleine into his mouth as though he hadn’t seen a morsel of food for days, even though Draco had personally watched the man eat a full plate of macarons, two croissants and a Pain Aux Raisins just minutes before.
. Goodness gracious, Draco, what a delicious surprise that was. Frankly, it’s a better punishment than I myself could have ever come up with. Tell me, how does it feel, loving someone so untouchable, so unattainable? Someone who will never love you back? It must hurt something excruciating, I’m sure.”
Harry blinked, expression shocked, as though he hadn’t even realised he’d been staring. Draco knew that feeling all too well. “Err,” said the Gryffindor, going a bit pink. “Sorry, I. Uhm. It’s nothing.”
Draco scowled. “Blaise! I did
Within an instant, two pairs of eyes focused on him, one blue, one grey, and Harry cursed his complete lack of grace. However, he forced a small smile, although its effectiveness was likely limited due to his pre-existing grimace.
That—and, okay, yes, probably Harry’s complete botchery of Draco’s posh accent—finally got the Slytherin to look up at Harry, if only to send a single withering glare his direction. But it was still worth it, and Harry couldn’t help but grin back.
He immediately wanted to kick himself, especially when Draco asked, “I beg your pardon?” He sounded affronted, too, and Harry briefly feared he’d just completely ruined their moment. Except there was still that little dazed smile playing across Draco’s vividly pink lips, and he chuckled slightly as he said, “What about
Draco turned to his bowl of chocolate batter, realizing promptly he still had no idea how to use Harry’s bizarre muggle appliances, then deciding to hell with it all, he’d just do it with magic. So much for his big gesture. Draco had only ventured into the kitchen in the first place because of—goddamn, when had his life turned into a such fucking soap opera—
"I'm Nic," answered a voice to his left, and Harry turned to find a tall brunet seated beside Parvati that either had only just appeared there seconds ago or had in fact been sitting there all along and Harry had simply been too high-strung to notice. The stranger had one hand raised in an awkward half-wave, smiling sheepishly at Harry. "Dominic Hayes, nice to meet you."
But Pansy ignored him, instead cheerily poking a finger into the chocolate batter (again, ignoring Draco’s protests), scooping out a big heap of batter and shoving it into her mouth with a satisfied smack of the lips. Her eyes widened with joy. “Forget what I said earlier, Draco, dear—I’m so,
Yaxley’s lips curved upwards. “Evidently not.”
And fear.
He could have asked Robards to send him an owl or, if the situation truly necessitated face-to-face communication, Floo him. But instead Draco had gone to the Ministry and left Harry alone.
Draco had not reacted fast enough, and it didn’t matter that he hadn’t anticipated the attack, for that particular fact hadn’t mattered in the slightest, not when he’d lain there sprawled across the bathroom floor in a pool of his own blood, able to form only a single coherent thought: He was going to die.
But then Harry paused, and since their hands were still intertwined and Draco wasn’t about to let go, he was forced to stop as well, frowning as Harry looked at Hayes with that same concentrated, thoughtful expression he’d worn earlier.
And when the conversation started up again, Draco let himself partake in it, let himself laugh and joke and grin with his friends, let himself enjoy just being with them, being with
“I’m sorry to hear that,” Potter said, and Draco was surprised to hear genuine compassion in his tone. “And you’re sure, one day, it won’t…?”
in the other, and Draco felt a surge of such intense anger he could nearly feel his magic pushing and shoving inside him to get loose, squirming and writhing under his skin.

It was all feasible emotions wrapped in one, all blazing fire and clear, brilliant moonlight, an inferno of unspoken words and uncharted paths and one something so intense, so scorching and glowing and blazing it made it impossible to think, impossible to
Harry shook his head, but nonetheless couldn’t quite suppress a grin. “You’re such a prat.”
I'm currently suffering from a very severe case of writer's block, but I have a week off now so I hope by next Sunday everything'll be back to normal again.
Fortunately, Potter laughed then, and Draco’s attention instinctively flitted back to the darkhaired Gryffindor. “Not that I wouldn’t love talking about potions for a few hours, but we do have a shopkeeper to go question.” His green eyes found Draco. “Besides, the sooner we get this done, the sooner we can go home.”
She stood, and when Harry remained seated, pulled him up as well. “Oh, no, you aren’t staying here a minute longer. Those chairs are bloody uncomfortable, and you clearly need some rest.” When Harry started to protest, Hermione held up a hand, which promptly put him back into silence. “No buts. You look miserable. I wasn’t kidding earlier; if you don’t go home now by your own accord, I’ll drag you there myself.” At his frown, her face softened a fracture. “Look, I promise we’ll drop by soon. Just…get some sleep, okay?”
