“The door, I cannot explain,” Potter says slowly, before letting out a long sigh, and then curses under his breath. “I need to go question the students who found her, along with the prefects who were patrolling the corridors – perhaps one of them saw something that could help us with this.”
A frown takes place between Harry’s brows. “Take a seat, Malfoy,” Harry says quietly, feeling nervous. If Ginny reacted the way she did, Harry’s not looking forward to see how Malfoy will, as he will be asked the same thing.
James doesn’t have time to react, before Albus has flipped up his wand, and aimed a wordless tripping jinx at his brother, glaring at him as James splutters and yells in surprise, and slips from his feet, tumbling down the stairs.
Albus rolls his eyes inwardly, wondering what exactly Riley has said, since he thinks it can’t be anyone else. He remembers that neither his father or his Head of House has confirmed that it actually
Potter looks at the table, his jaw tightening slightly. “Yes and no,” He finally says with a weary voice. “She knows what happened,” he says, looking at Draco, who had already figured out that bit, “But there were other…issues,” He says with a small grimace. “I suppose the…thing…at the pub was just the last straw – something we’d been, well,
Albus wants to say he definitely agrees, but he chooses to keep it to himself. The girl looks close to tears already. Instead he clears his throat. “Why did you think I’d – I’d be, um…into you?” He asks, and then leans against the teacher’s table, watching her with an arched brow.
“Hermione, calm down,” Harry says with a hard tone, giving Hermione a squeeze on her shoulder and glancing at Ron and Rose. His friend gives him a strained smile, and an inconspicuous nod. Harry focuses on Hermione again. “I know it doesn’t make any sense right now,” Harry says very quietly, “You know that I wouldn’t suspect any of our children, because
Albus gives Scorpius an incredulous look, having been hoping that he could snap his friend away from whatever it is that is bothering him.
, and they tell each other everything – at least, Albus had thought they did! And…and the fact that Scorpius would go for his
It's the same look Harry has received from Draco multiple times. He snorts quietly, moving to open the window. The eagle owl drops the letter to Harry’s head, turns swiftly around, flapping its wings to Harry’s face as it does, before flying out of the window.
“The last person, as we know of, to see Travers alive, was Rose Granger-Weasley, when she went to Travers’s compartment, approximately thirty minutes before the train reached Hogsmeade,” Harry says, and detects some frowns and dubious looks. He nods, already guessing what they are thinking. “According to the Crime Scene Investigator, as well as the post-mortem-scan, time of death occurred between five-thirty and six-thirty pm,” Harry says grimly. “…With the blow to the head occurring possibly during a thirty-minute time range before Travers’s death,” Harry adds, having memorised Malfoy’s summary from the first night.
Malfoy gasps against Harry's mouth as soon as their hips meet. Harry is breathless and frantic, shuddering as Malfoy's other hand tangles with his hair, while his other hand slides down to rest against Harry's arse. Harry feels feverish when Malfoy tips his chin down to press small, biting kisses onto Harry's jaw and throat.
He decides to start with the dungeons, and goes back to the Entrance Hall, then takes the door on the right side, and walks down the set of stone steps towards the dungeons. In his mind, Harry goes over the answers from the three students, examining the details and if they had any inconsistencies between their stories, or anything that might have stood out. Why did Miss Westen tell him about Riley’s jealousy? What was distracting Miss Travers? Another boy? Could Riley have done something out of jealousy?
How they had stumbled into the bathroom some time later, is still beyond Draco’s grasp. He doesn’t remember much of the night, but he remembers that. He remembers the intensity of that tragically bright green gaze and the concern in Potter’s eyes, that quickly turned into something else. It was need. It was urgency. It was hunger. He remembers Potter’s fingers pressing against his shoulder, his lips crashing against Draco’s, greedily taking what they wanted. He remembers Potter pushing Draco against the door, keeping him in place, his hand against Draco’s jaw the other one bruising his hip, and Potter’s leg between his.
Harry gives Albus an incredulous look. “Are you lying, Albus?” Harry asks, feeling shocked and confused.
Then, there’s a sharp knock on the kitchen window, and Harry nearly tumbles to the floor, as he jumps to stand up. He frowns and looks at the watch on his wrist; it is almost midnight, and Harry thinks it is rather late to owl someone. He walks into his kitchen, his throat tightening slightly as he sees the eagle owl standing outside of his window, a very familiar, condemning look on its eyes, as if knowing what Harry had been about to do in his sitting room.
There’s a long silence, during which Albus tries to steady his breath, tries to close his mind, and tries not to feel at all. Because if he does, he’s not sure if he can bear it – not there, in the middle of the grounds, in front of everyone. What he needs, is to be alone.
Two years ago. That sounds an awfully familiar amount of time, on Draco’s opinion. Is there a possibility that
Unsurprisingly, the parents had been shocked, and had not considered that as a possibility – that their name could have been the reason to what had happened to their daughter. Potter had also asked them if their daughter had had access to any sedative potions, as there had been a high dose found in her bloodstream. Mr and Mrs Travers had been adamant as they had told Potter that their daughter wouldn’t have had access to those potions in her home.
Albus doesn’t look at his mother, and barely listens as his parents start yelling over the other, before the Headmistress cries loudly, “For Merlin’s sake, Harry. Ginevra! Pull yourself together!”
As Harry looks back at Malfoy, he can see there’s something flickering in Malfoy’s gaze. Something close to…curiosity.
Malfoy merely gives him a brisk nod, and grunts a simple, “Potter,” before he leaves the room in a flutter of robes.
Quinn gives him a small nod. “I agree.” He then glances at the timepiece on the wall. “Nearly one. James is coming now, right?”
Draco lets out a weary sigh, closing his eyes to centre himself, but flinches when Potter’s stomping feet bring him back only seconds later.
Potter? A sixteen-year-old girl’s spell is weaker than the one cast by the Saviour of our world?” He asks, mockery dripping from his voice.
“A student has been found dead on the Hogwarts Express. Jenna Travers. We do not know much, but as we will be investigating a school with several hundreds of inhabitants, it should be kept in mind that it is possible for a murderer to hide amongst them. We will move with a Portkey –” Harry says, his voice trailing off as the mentioned travelling method – a long thick rope – appears next to him with a loud crack.
James stares at the floor with a strained look. “I’m not proud of what I said. But, what he did to Albus – “
And even without actually saying anything, Albus thinks that James knows what Albus wants to say. What he forbids himself to say.
Their father shakes his head to James. “Of course not. But all of you might have valuable information for the investigation. We need to know everything that has happened between all of you and Miss Travers. You can help us to figure this out, to find the reason for her death.”
“A what?!” Harry gasps, taken aback. “No. No, no, no…” He says, stumbling backwards a couple of steps. “Is it – who is it?!” He asks, almost hysterically. His mind is reeling;
Malfoy lets out a muffled sigh against the junction of Harry’s neck, thrusting against him – and Harry shudders as he can finally feel the hard line of Malfoy’s cock through his robes.
The Headmistress clears her throat. “I have summoned you here, as it has come to our attention that all of you,” she says, glancing each of the students in turn, “have had some contact with Miss Travers either during the train ride, or before that.”
Potter lets out a soft grunt, his eyes glued on the book. He then tears his eyes away from it, and looks at Draco. “I suppose we need to expand our investigation,” he says with a grim look.
“I was in the impression that you didn’t want to discuss the matter. That you swore it not to happen anymore.”
Harry quickly summons a quill and a parchment from his study, grinning wider than he has for a long time, before he leans over the parchment and starts to scribble his response.
Seconds later, all Aurors land with a collective thud, still gracefully on their feet, in front of the school gates. Headmistress McGonagall stands there waiting, along with Neville Longbottom.
Draco knows there’s something else, however. He knows his son – there’s something Scorpius has left unsaid. And that something, Draco thinks with a mild concern, will be revealed the next day.
He takes a deep breath, steeling himself. “Can we talk about last night?” He asks, very quietly, watching Malfoy’s reaction carefully.
“Both Mr Flint and Miss Hawthrone – the fifth-year Slytherin Prefects – spoke about a New Year’s party that occurred at your house,” He says, and Potter visibly stiffens.
“Auror Parkinson will be stationed in the common room for the night,” he adds, and sees several girls looking calmer and more collected.
His father lets out a wavering breath. There’s a deep frown between his brows as he studies Albus’s features, somewhat helpless.
Albus gives his friend a grim nod. “I know. I told my dad what happened, don’t worry. And I’ll tell them the truth now. I just wonder…who would’ve told them such a lie?” he says.
“Hey, mate,” Ron says, a bit stiffly, stopping in his tracks. Harry sees the worry and dread in his eyes.
His father sighs, but doesn’t say anything. Instead, he puts his hand over Albus’s shoulders, and pulls him closer to him.
Both Scott sisters and Westen are standing outside of the classroom with a man and a woman, who Albus thinks must be their parents. Scorpius’s father stands further down the hall, evidently waiting for his son.
Potter. Draco’s past came to haunt him – it all came back to slap him in the face. During the past year, he has managed to avoid those thoughts, to bury them somewhere deep in the corner of his mind. And now the sodding git has made everything difficult. All was well when Draco was able to avoid the Boy Who Lived. After Astoria died, it was always Scorpius and Albus organising their get togethers either at his home or at Potter’s. And Potter had stayed away from him after the pub, which Draco thinks was for the better. But now, Draco is expected to work with the bespectacled Saviour, and act as if nothing has happened between them. The bad, or the good.
“I have examined the compartment, and found two objects that could have caused the impact and the wound; the edge of the compartment bench and a schoolbook,” Draco explains, and sees Potter swallowing hard, evidently thinking about said book’s owner.
An hour later, they are finishing their breakfast in the private chamber, both the courtesy of Ms Bones – who Draco hasn’t really spoken to, not in school or after the war, but wonders how she ended up here, to run the pub. She seems friendly enough with Potter, and when Weasley arrives, with him as well.
Harry feels relieved, but at the same time, he’s burdened by the past days’ events. The case is solved. A young girl, as young as his own children are, has passed away, and Harry knows exactly how easily it could’ve been prevented. He thinks of the girl, wondering if she had known how the potions were going to affect her. If she had intended it to happen. If she had wanted end her life.
Harry groans, leaning forward, pressing the heels of his palms against his forehead, while resting his elbows at his knees, his fingers tangled into his hair. “You knew when you hired him, knew when you assigned him…”
Ten minutes later, Potter arrives again, alone this time, a small frown between his brows. Time, during which Draco has identified the preliminary cause of death; traumatic brain injury, along with the fact that every speck of blood in the compartment is from the girl. He thinks it is rather curious.
Harry gives the parents a moment to collect themselves before he continues, explaining that he didn’t find any traces of magic of anyone else except their daughter’s in the compartment.
Harry takes the lone armchair while Moonstone and Riley sit next to each other, facing Harry. Quinn hovers further in the room, observing quietly.
Potter rubs the bridge of his nose, his glasses moving slightly up. “Her parents are at McGonagall’s office. I’ll talk to them about the situation, but they will most likely want to see her before you send the body to the morgue,” Potter tells him wearily.
It is now past dinnertime, and everyone, who had come forth about seeing Travers during their train ride, has been questioned.
Potter lifts a hand up. “Hold on,” he says with a low voice and a deep frown. Everyone turns to look at him. “I questioned Miss Westen. And she didn’t mention anything about this argument. Neither did Riley.” Potter says, glancing at Quinn. The other Auror gives him a confirmative nod.
“Thank you, Headmistress,” Harry says before turning to his team of Aurors assigned to the school. “You know the drill.”
Moonstone pats him on the shoulder. “You can tell us, Nate. The other students will not find out what is spoken in this room,” he says gently.
“FUUUCK!” James screams, slumping down to the floor, panting, at the precise moment when their father, their mother, and the Headmistress arrive to the scene.
And why did Potter tell this to Draco? They are not friends, not at least on Draco’s half. Why would Potter open up about his personal life to Draco?
Harry’s insides jump slightly. “Do you want it to happen again?” He asks, somewhat surprised by his boldness, as well as his voice, which sounds lower than it had been.
“During the train ride, she argued at least with three people. And found out that she was the victim of a prank,” Harry says.
Mr Malfoy is about to say something to his son, when the door to the classroom opens. Albus’s father walks out with one of the Aurors. Auror Quinn – Albus thinks, remembering the man from one of his visits to the Auror office.
He stops in his tracks, forcing away the nausea and the ache in his chest, and looks at her. “You okay?”
Ginny lets out a scoff. “Then how would the girl have known?!” She hisses, her eyes blazing. “How would
“So, to make it short; nothing unusual was found on the school grounds, inside the school, at the station, or at the village. We are still not sure whether the girl was a murder victim, or if her death was caused by an accident – nor do we know if other people can be connected to the incident. There are some things that do not add up; she locked the door of the compartment she was found from with a spell, but there weren’t any unlocking charms placed on it afterwards. However, according to the students who found her, the door was unlocked. There also seem to be two possibilities how the wound in her head – and the severe head injury that is the cause of her death – could have been caused. Our crime scene investigator can confirm the cause later,” Harry explains after locking and securing the door with silencing charms.
Albus can hear James scoffing loudly. “No, you fucking won’t,” James growls. “You will not tell a soul, Malfoy, and you will pray that they don’t ask about it tomorrow. And if they do, you’ll – you’ll lie!”
James, however, seems to be off the hook; no one seems to be interested about questioning him further – at least, according to his mother – since he wasn’t actually seen with Travers after the party, even though, Albus thinks bitterly, James was the one who started this whole bloody mess.
Draco finds himself staring at Potter, who stands there, on the top of the stairs, looking windswept, his cheeks red from what Draco assumes is the cold air outside.
Not that he had been expecting anything else. What happened the previous night, had been a mistake – something Harry should not have let happen, regardless of how much he had wanted it to.
Malfoy turns his eyes at Harry, and there’s something flashing behind the silvery gaze, something, Harry thinks, that wants to insult him, that wants to tell Harry how moronic he is. Instead, Malfoy sighs, and looks down. “Something doesn’t add up. And…I needed some peace and quiet. To think.”
It is close to midnight, when they finally finish their sum up. Most of the Aurors stay in the school, and less than half go back to the village. Harry, however, makes his way back to the crime scene. He needs to see it once more, needs to be there, needs to look at it, in case anything comes up, anything he might’ve missed earlier.
Regarding the questioning the next day, Albus thinks Rose will be all right, that it’ll go smoothly. He doesn’t really worry for her, as much as he does for his best friend. Albus can’t stop thinking that something’s not right with Scorpius. Albus – well, Albus thinks Scorpius might know more about Travers’s death than he has let on.
Potter clears his throat. “And due to that, I decided that we should question James under Veritaserum as well.”
Draco takes a step back, giving Potter the most dubious look he can summon, “No. I don’t want you to – to
He stares at the parchment for a long moment, before letting out a huff of breath, feeling light, feeling a rush of excitement at the one word above Draco’s signature.
Draco watches Potter, seeing how wrecked he looks. He knows there’s a lot of pressure upon the Head Auror, as the Minister and the school governors are all watching his every move, expecting him to solve the case in a record time. In addition to that, both his sons are being questioned, and regarded more of less as suspects in this investigation. His irritation towards the messy-haired wizard diminishes somewhat, as he sees the flicker of overcome behind his eyes, as Quinn continues to go over Rose Granger-Weasley’s questioning.
Ginny scowls at Harry for a moment, and then lets out a weary sigh. “Fine. Do it then,” She says stiffly, looking aloof, and then turns towards the door, not saying anything more, and not turning back to look at Harry.
As he steps into the dark platform, surrounded by trees and the Hogwarts Express that stands eerily still, the handful of streetlamps reveal someone standing there. That someone is in the middle of the station, leaning against the stretch of a wall separating the couple of buildings from the platform.
Harry licks his lips, staring at the expressionless mask on Malfoy’s face, turned away from Harry. He then realises that Malfoy hasn’t said ‘no’. That he hasn’t said if he wants it to happen again. Which…Harry thinks he does. Or…he at least hopes so.
Hermione swallows hard, nodding a couple of times. “Yes…yes, I’m…I know,” she says weakly, before taking in a deep breath, and standing straighter, pulling up the ‘Head of the DMLE’ look on her face. “I hope you do find out what happened. The press is going wild, now that some of the parents have talked,” she says with a tired voice, pinching the bridge of her nose. “It will get worse when the parents start arriving here, trying to pull their kids out of the school,” She continues, before whispering, “And if they find out that
Harry gives a quick shake of his head. “The train driver and the trolley lady were both questioned. They had not seen or heard anything abnormal. The train wards were not breached by outsiders,” he says, and Smith, along with several others, seem slightly disappointed.
Which Harry had definitely not given to his son. But now, it seems, it is a good thing that James knows no boundaries and guilt – except only when someone has died, apparently – to go through his study; a room Harry has locked with charms that even a seventh-year should not be able to break, he adds in his mind.
Albus gives her a frown. She’s an example case of those fame-seeking witches, along with her sister, and Albus doesn’t really want to talk to her. But he’s curious to know if she was the one lying to the Aurors. Lying to his father.
Draco doesn’t really listen, and instead flicks his wand to gather his stuff, and then stands up knowing that if he doesn’t leave now, he might say something he could regret later.
Draco lets out an impatient noise. “As expected. Did you not listen as I said that magical signatures are quite personal?” He says with a crisp voice.
“No, I definitely don’t.” Albus says quickly, and gives her a horrified look. “Why would you think that?” He asks, hoping that the witch doesn’t start crying.
“What do you think?” Scorpius asks impatiently, and Albus can picture clearly Scorpius rolling his eyes in exasperation. “I trust you heard about the questioning they’re doing tomorrow?” Scorpius continues tightly. “And if they ask the right questions, you know what they’ll find out.”
Albus suppresses an eyeroll, suppresses the urge to throw something, or trash something. “Yes,” he says with a clipped tone. Trust Rose to see everything, even though they don’t sit at the same table.
Julian shrugs, glancing at Albus. “Yeah. Fine. I’ll get my books after breakfast,” he says and leaves without saying anything else.
And perhaps that is why he dislikes his son’s choices. They remind him of what he didn’t have. And they also remind him how James is truly his mother’s son.
Harry squints at Quinn, before putting his glasses back on. “I want to question the boyfriend under Veritaserum. Both Scott sisters, Miss Westen, and – Scorpius as well,” Harry says wearily, grimacing inwardly as he thinks how Malfoy will take the news.
His eyes track Potter’s movements, as the Auror rubs the bridge of his nose, his glasses going askew. He watches, transfixed, at the other man, taking note how he has changed; how his hair is longer, how his appearance is somehow more…untidier – but at the same time even more distracting than before. Draco is trying hard to force away the memories that surge to the forefront of his mind, trying to forget the blazing look in the emerald eyes.
Draco inclines his head slightly, knowing Potter is right, knowing that he himself wants to know the truth, but is nevertheless irritated by the bright, righteous expression on the bespectacled saviour’s face.
,” Potter whispers, and a wand movement for the last spell of the wand appears in the air between them, gleaming in silver.
“Let’s go over what we have learnt today, shall we?” Potter says, looking around the room. “Today we questioned Scorpius Malfoy, Pamela Scott, Hazel Scott, Albus Potter, Skylar Westen, Nate Riley, James Potter, and Rose Granger-Weasley. After many inconsistencies in the descriptions of events they gave us, I decided it was needed to question all of them under Veritaserum,” Potter explains, while both Keir and Quinn take notes. “Nate Riley and Pamela Scott were questioned again later today, under Veritaserum, and the rest will be questioned tomorrow.”
Not that Draco was objecting the slightest. In fact, he was enjoying it more than he had imagined he would with Potter. It had been both thrilling and so…
Hermione nods. “We both know there will not be anything crucial found by questioning Albus again,” she says, giving Harry a small smile. “The boy doesn’t have a dishonest bone in his body…”
And Scorpius – he really should’ve been in Ravenclaw. Albus has a strong suspicion that Scorpius had begged the Sorting Hat to put him into Slytherin, to make his father happy. To not cause a scandal to their family. Like Albus had.
“I felt bad, because I heard what had happened at the party, how – how cruel James had been,” she says, and Harry wants to purse his lips, since, yes James had been
Scorpius, who is crouched over the nightstand between their beds and is in the middle of rummaging through his books visibly flinches, his grey eyes quickly darting around the room behind him. Albus too glances at the others; Zachary’s is in the bathroom, Cory and Cecil are both already in their beds, curtains closed. Julian – who had told them everything about the interrogation, and confirmed that it was Travers who died, thirty minutes earlier – is sitting cross-legged on his bed, furthest to Albus’s and Scorpius’s, and writing to his parents.
, Rose!” Albus suddenly grits out, glaring at his cousin. “Stop thinking that you’re gonna be anything more than a friend to him!” He yells, realising how hysterical he sounds. Realising that he’s breathing heavily. He feels like he might be suffocating.
As soon as he’s in the confines of his own room, Draco takes in a long, steadying breath, and presses his hands against his eyes. What in the name of Salazar was he thinking? In which scenario snogging Potter like his life depended on it, and letting Potter wank him into the brink of an orgasm is a good idea? Suppressing a groan of frustration, Draco quickly disrobes himself, and slips into the lumpy bed, making sure his wand is ready to wake him up early in the morning, and willing his somewhat painful erection to go away. He needs to get a grip. His son’s questioning is the next morning. And Potter is still…
Draco thinks quickly how long it will take to collect and analyse all the evidence with the probable interruptions. “I should be,” he says after a short moment.
Albus feels his father shifting next to him, and as he looks, he can see the deep frown he gives to Quinn. Albus looks back at Quinn. “I told her that I didn’t care if she did. I thought that if I didn’t need to be bothered by her again, I’d gladly let her
Susan Bones – Harry’s old classmate – runs the pub now, and she greets him heartily, before telling him that he shouldn’t hesitate to ask if there was something he needed. She tells him that the pub is closed for everyone but the Aurors at this time of day, and that she will turn in soon, but her bartender; Douglas, will stay up for a bit longer, should they wish to eat or drink something. Harry gives her a grateful smile and tells her he quite appreciates her help.
Quinn clears his throat. “Tell me more about your relationship with Miss Travers. Did you stay mad at her, when you were separated? Bitter? Sad?”
For a moment, he tries to remember that night, at the pub. He tries to remember how it ended, tries to remember what had happened after the bathroom, after he had sucked Potter off, and after Potter had – but he can’t. All he can recall, is the feeling of emptiness the next morning, when he woke up from his bed at the Manor.
Albus gapes ahead, unable to believe what he’s hearing. James and Scorpius? Do they – do they actually have something to do with Travers’s death?
“What do you reckon she wants from us?” Albus asks quietly, as the two of them make their way up the stairs, towards the Headmistress’s office.
friend to snog you, so – here we are,” Albus says back venomously, scrubbing one of the pans furiously with soap and a cleaning brush.
Potter pulls the book closer, closes it and flicks his wand at it, checking it for any traces of magic. Draco already knows there are none.
Harry nods slowly, wondering what else Malfoy needed to think, besides the obvious murder inspection. “Scorpius?” He asks hesitantly, knowing that he’s right when he sees Malfoy’s lips twitch into a rueful smile.
Potter lets out a frustrated and desperate noise, and then stomps away again, grunting orders to the other Auror.
Moonstone’s worried expression very slowly turns into an amused one. “Malfoy, right?” He says, giving Harry an odd look just as Harry starts to walk towards the door.
Albus frowns at his friend, feeling that Scorpius is acting very strangely, and has been like that since the train. “What is going on with you?” Albus asks, shifting closer to his friend. “Are you…are you upset about what happened? To Travers.” He asks, even though he knows it cannot be that.
Harry follows James’s gaze, and sees Malfoy and Scorpius, standing against the wall near them, both looking tensely at the floor.
Ginny and James continue bickering, while Harry is deep in thought. Albus, his sixteen-year-old son, has…been with a girl. Girls, possibly. Harry feels a sizable lump in his throat. Is that – is it normal? It probably is, he reckons. He and Ginny weren’t that much older when they reached that same level of intimacy. Perhaps they would have got there sooner, if the war had not been raging around them? Still, it seems that his son is growing up so fast that he has barely been able to hold on. So many details of Albus’s life have come forth during the past day that Harry wonders how well he really knows his son?
Draco stares back at her with an equally expressionless look. He wonders if she knows. “Mrs Potter.” He replies with a miniscule nod, since he’s not bad-mannered. Just irritated by her presence.
Quinn nods in agreement and then gestures everyone to be alert when a figure approaches them in the darkness.
“Why?” Albus asks, feeling utterly bewildered. Yes, the girl definitely is what he described earlier, but why would she lie to bloody
Albus’s throat is suddenly dry, and he has trouble of swallowing. He has trouble of breathing properly. “Hmm?” He manages to ask, summoning a look of indifference to his features.
called me. Not you.” She says pointedly. “I know you probably came here with firebolts glued under your shoes, but you could have informed me,” She says, almost hisses, giving Potter a disenchanted look.
Harry suppresses a large yawn as he walks briskly towards the village. It is dark and cold and the snow glittering on the ground and the trees creates shadows in the moonlight. He has left the Map to Prone who will be in charge of the Aurors stationed in the school during the night.
!” Weasley – Ginevra – bursts through the door, and makes her way swiftly towards her husband, throwing herself straight into his arms. Draco then remembers disappointingly that her last name is
Harry chews the inside of his cheek, remembering the book and the edge of the bench, both streaked with blood. “She had a wand on her hand. Her last spell was a locking charm, which I detected from the door. But I could not detect an unlocking charm. Yet, somehow, the charm broke,” Harry says gravely.
Albus follows his friend’s example, and sees that nearly all of the students have sat down, but most of the teachers are missing. He wonders what time it is, and how long will it take until the feast starts. He’s starving. He glances at the doors that lead to the Entrance Hall, and sees something peculiar.
Potter puts both Berrycloth and Fungbury to night watch, to patrol the streets as there are several concerned parents staying in the village along with the regular population, making the air around them somewhat tense.
After the door closes, Moonstone leans back in his chair and lifts his brows at Harry. “You think the boyfriend did it.” He states, not asking, but saying what he thinks Harry thinks.
“What about her friends? Old boyfriends? What kind of relationship had she with Mr Riley?” Harry asks after a short silence.
Albus is shaken from his thoughts. “Yeah. Night.” He says, and chews the inside of his cheek, still staring at the canopy of his bed.
One of Draco’s eyebrows lifts up. “Oh? Do tell.” He drawls in a narked manner, as if he’s offended that there were any doubts regarding his or Harry’s professionalism in the first place.
A moment later, Harry watches from the back of the classroom, as Rose’s hands shake when she tips down the vial of Veritaserum, and watches, as Quinn begins to question her as he did with James and Scorpius earlier.
There’s a short silence as they start to walk along the corridor on the third floor. Albus watches Scorpius carefully. “So…should I tell them how strangely you’ve been acting since the train, or not?” He asks simply, as they turn a corner in the hallway.
The silence is interrupted by a sudden appearance of a silver crow, which, quite easily, manages to scare the shit out of both Draco and Potter.
Both Albus and Scorpius grumble something close to “G’night,” under their breaths, and drag themselves towards the boys’ dormitory. Harry waits until the door closes, before he gives Parkinson a nod and leaves the Slytherin common room.
Harry gives Malfoy a tight-lipped smile. He knows about that too, and remembers feeling that for once, being what he is, had been a good thing for someone. Had helped someone.
Potter levels him with a serious look. “Because I think there’s more to the story.” Potter says, not moving his eyes from Draco. “He didn’t really give Quinn a reason for Travers’s threats, and I have a feeling that he knows exactly why she threatened him.” Potter says, and Draco thinks the saviour’s gaze tells him enough: they want to know if Scorpius had done something to prevent Travers from fulfilling her threats.
They sit down side by side, and Albus shrugs, knowing that his father is waiting for an answer. “I’m fine. I’ll be fine,” he adds, after seeing the inquisitive look in his eyes. Trust his father to know all about the fucking embarrassing drama between Albus, James and Scorpius.
Draco’s eyes follow the movement, wondering briefly what exactly is going on in his mind right now. His focus swiftly moves to the door as there’s a knock before it opens.
Their father takes in a deep breath and closes his eyes for a moment. He breathes out, and then looks somewhat calmer as he sits down opposite to Albus and James. “I do not suspect either one of you, I want you to know that. I know you are not capable of such things, and would’ve come to me if you had seen anything or heard of anything related to Miss Travers’s death. I
Scorpius looks back at him, shrugging. “Yeah, I’m fine. Just some stuff with dad…” He mutters, turning his focus on his plate.
That they are working together to solve a possible murder. And that – that after the pub, Potter disappeared. He didn’t floo Draco. He didn’t owl him. He just went back to his wife. Back to his family.
“The train’s wards were not breached. Miss Travers’s compartment did not display anyone else’s magic, but her own, as didn’t her body in the post-mortem-scan that was performed a day after her death,” Harry says, feeling weary, feeling… disappointed after realising how easily Travers’s death could’ve been prevented. After all, the evidence to that small little detail still pulses nastily on the back of Harry’s head, obscured by a basic concealing charm.
Quinn schools his features and clears his throat. “We would like to know more about the party that took place in your home, on New Year’s Eve,” he tells James, and Harry is bloody relieved he had the time to speak to Ginny about that little bit of information, as he practically feels her bristling on James’s other side.
“There is something you should know.” Malfoy says, to little avail, as he opens it at the same time, and Harry sees it. The inscription inside the book.
Albus shakes his head. He can’t believe he just said that to his father, and also – why would his father even be shocked? Surely, he himself has encountered similar people, being the actual Saviour.
Harry frowns at her. “We need a Portkey – and we need to investigate Hogsmeade, as well as the station.”
Harry nods again. “Let’s get this over with,” he grunts, and steps inside, feeling nervous and concerned.
it’s about Albus’s brother. But before he can question his friend further, Julian, Cory, Cecil and Zachary sit down on the other side of the table, all red-faced and windswept, evidently due to a fun afternoon spent outside.
Draco’s eyes find Potter’s – Harry’s – and he inclines his head to the door. “Until tomorrow,” he murmurs and then takes his notes and makes his way out of the room.
After asking Scorpius to confirm his whole name and birthday, Quinn continues, “Tell me about the train ride. You arrived to King’s Cross with the Potters, yes?”
“Julian,” Scorpius says in the morning. “Could I have a word with Albus?” He asks with a tight voice.
Harry sees how there’s a flicker of shock on Malfoy’s otherwise expressionless look, as then the man glances at his son. Harry too feels…apprehensive.
Rose shakes her head. “No. She was quite a lot calmer than she had been in the corridor earlier,” she says resolutely.
Scorpius huffs with irritation, and Albus can hear movement in the room. “So – what? One mistake and your life is over?” he asks darkly.
“We did, didn’t we?” Albus asks pointedly. “I wonder what rubbish Riley has told them, if they’ve already talked to him…”
, she doesn’t really react the way Albus thought she would have. Nevertheless, Albus is relieved. Perhaps, this will not become a nightmare for him.
Harry lifts his brows in curiosity. “Oh? Where was she hoping to get assigned?” Harry knows that all main departments accept research assistants; a position, where one does have the possibility to move up in their careers, depending on the results of their assessment, and the chosen career path. Peele and Walter had both been research assistants for the DMLE at first, before applying to the Auror Academy.
Keir sits down next to Draco. “He’ll be here soon. Was with Moonstone and the Head Boy when we left, going through the last of his interviews,” the man grunts.
There’s a frustrated groan. “Untwist your knickers, Quinn, it’s only me!” Ron yells and a second later, he lights up his wand.
? Draco nearly stumbles on a small rock as his mind goes rocketing into different directions. When Potter doesn’t continue, Draco clears his throat before he speaks. “You’ve lost me, I’m afraid,” He says mutedly, trying not to sound too curious.
Harry gives the otter a grim nod. “Will do.” He says and then the Patronus disappears, and Harry turns his focus back to his Aurors.
Harry nods slowly. “We will continue tomorrow, by questioning Miss Hazel Scott, Miss Westen, James, Albus, Rose and Scorpius under Veritaserum,” he says, chewing the inside of his cheek. “Unfortunately, we cannot let any of the students go yet, since they are all witnesses – as well as possible suspects – in a murder investigation.”
Harry shrugs. “It was all right. But it’s good to be back here,” he says, and then grimaces at the stack of parchments scattered over his table. “Not to this, though. I was away for one week, and actually had problems locating my desk today from under all this.”
Riley frowns a bit. “I’m not sure,” he mutters. “Maybe forty-five minutes before we arrived to Hogsmeade? Could have been less…” His eyes widen then, and he gives both Harry and Moonstone a horrified look. “You don’t think I had something to do – no!” He says, standing up, looking furious.
“However, you have been seen with her in the recent past. Have been seen having an argument,” he says to James, “or,” He mutters, looking at Albus, something close to disappointment in his eyes, “having a relationship with the girl.”
As Ginny lets out a croak of incredulity, Harry, however, feels that everything is starting to make sense, even if the ‘sense’ makes him groan inwardly in exasperation and concern.
“What about the train?” Bones’s partner Smith – a red-haired, thirty-something year old man – asks, “Did the driver or the trolley lady see anything?”
Of course, he has thought of the possibility of a set up – and had spoken about it with Hermione the previous night, after giving her an update of the situation. It could be possible – that someone did this to harm Harry, Hermione, Ron and their families. Someone could’ve done it for multiple reasons; to hurt Harry or Hermione – who are both in respectable and high positions at the Ministry; to hurt their children, because they are the children of the ‘golden trio’. But by whom it would’ve been done? The people who had seen their children in contact with Travers, were from different houses, different years, different families – yes, some of them were Travers’s friends, but they too were questioned under Veritaserum. Had there been a setup, it would’ve come up. Harry’s sure of it.
The Patronus disappears, and Potter sighs, casting his own silvery stag, and sends a quick message back to Fungbury to thank him for the information, adding that he’s still at the scene with Draco, and that they will both return later.
Albus still feels the anxiousness and nausea curling in his stomach. He manages to catch his brother’s eye from the Gryffindor table, gives him an intent stare, a questioning look. James looks back steadily, before shaking his head slightly; indicating that no one of the Gryffindor house is missing from the Hall. Albus gives his brother a similar kind of gesture.
He empties his mind and walks inside the classroom behind Quinn and gives his son a reassuring smile, before taking a seat next to him. “You’re doing all right, son,” He murmurs, squeezing James’s shoulder. James’s jaw is tight, and he doesn’t look at Harry, but gives back a small, jerky nod.
The man in question chews the inside of his cheek before he speaks. “Never mind. I’ll – I’ll see you later, yeah?”
“About what happened at the party?” Quinn asks, his eyes moving over Albus’s face. “Between you and Scorpius?”
Harry wants to yell at the top of his lungs. He never wanted it; the fame, people fawning over him. He never wanted any of that for himself, and definitely not for his children. How did Albus describe it? Fifteen minutes of fame, was it? That witches – underage girls – want to… want to
There’s a long silence. Albus sits in the middle of his bed, his eyes trained at the schoolbag he’s filling with the books he will need later in his classes. He swallows hard as he sees Scorpius’s frame in his peripheral vision.
She steps into the lift when the doors open. “Please…try to get along,” She says with a small grimace, and before Harry can ask her what the bloody hell she is talking about, the lift’s doors close and she is on her way back to the Minister’s office.
And Draco would definitely find it amusing, but he knows that Scorpius had been staying at the Potters during that time, and apparently without a parent in the house. He narrows his eyes at Potter, deciding to bring it up later.
Harry gives a calming pat on his son’s shoulder, and then sees Scorpius hesitantly trailing after Albus. “Hey boys,” He greets and then sees Parkinson, talking with two older students in one corner, while sweeping the room with his gaze every once in a while. He nods at Harry when their eyes meet.
, just so they can tell their friends that they’ve been with the Chosen One look-a-like? Harry bristles. He feels shocked. He feels angered. He feels powerless. He is the one who is supposed to protect his children, and the fact that he is the reason for Albus’s troubles, is…overwhelming.
“What the hell is this?!” Ginny asks again, her eyes blazing with anger, before she turns to her son. “Albus, what
Pamela Scott’s version of the events had changed between the two interrogations. Why would she first claim that Scorpius was the one having an argument with Travers on the train, and then the next day say that Albus had been there with him? Is it possible that someone had told her to say such things? She hadn’t given Harry any explanation for her lies, and merely claimed that she had forgot the details. Harry doesn’t really buy that.
Zachary rolls his eyes at him from Cory’s other side. “I hope you are taking the piss, Potter,” He scoffs and then turns his focus back to McGonagall.
“What the bloody fuck, Al?!” James yells, and then they’re openly duelling, backing towards the hallway, sending hexes and jinxes in a rapid pace, whenever they’re not blocking what the other throws forward.
The walk towards the school is a silent one, with Draco walking alone behind the group of Aurors and Weasley. He wonders why Potter’s wife has not joined them.
“She didn’t,” Albus says quietly, looking at the snow surrounding their ankles. “I’m just glad it’s over.”
Albus doesn’t remember much from the walk back to his dorm after the questioning, after finding out about his brother and Scorpius. He’s definitely not mad because of some
” Harry grits out, giving Ginny a pointed look. Even though Ginny speaks about them both, it certainly feels she’s somehow blaming him for all of it.
“Talk to us, Albus…” Harry says very quietly, feeling helpless. “I know you must feel betrayed. If you just help us understand –”
Rose lets out a huff of breath, frowning at him. “He didn’t look good, Al. Perhaps I should go and –”
Harry smiles at the portrait. “It is good to be back, regardless of the not so joyful reason,” He says, and then mutters the password, “
Harry continues through the door and slams it closed with more force than necessary after hearing a silent snort behind him. He
There’s a sharp knock on the door before it opens. Quinn and Riley step inside. Harry stands up from his seat while Moonstone flicks his wand to clear his table from teacups.
Albus watches carefully, as Scorpius proceeds to fill his plate. “You all right?” Albus asks, taking note of his friend’s every move.
There are moments Draco wishes he could take back – moments he thinks he should apologise for. But then again, Potter never really apologised for trying to kill him during their sixth year. What Potter
The Headmistress eyes Albus, James, Scorpius and Rose. “And as each of you is either related to the Auror leading the case or to the crime scene investigator investigating it,” She says, nodding at Albus’s father, “Mr Potter has arranged an Auror to carry out the questioning. You will be accompanied by your parents and your Heads of House. Although, Mr Potter,” she adds, looking at James, “as you are of age, you may decide if you wish to include your parents. However, since we are at school grounds, Professor Fox will accompany you nevertheless.”
Harry chews the inside of his cheek in thought. They really need to tell their children about their separation. They planned to, during the holidays, if not for Ginny’s unanticipated business trip that conveniently took place right after Christmas and is still continuing. And Harry wasn’t going to do it alone, certainly not. But the fact remains that he and Ginny haven’t been living together for quite some time and haven’t been a couple for even longer.
Quinn nods slowly. “Did you go straight to your own compartment after leaving Miss Travers’s?” He asks.
He turns a page, checking his notes. “The blow to the head may have occurred during a thirty-minute time range before her death.”
“Has anyone else been hurt?” He asks from Hermione as they walk out of his office and towards the space with empty cubicles. Harry’s glad he hasn’t eaten anything, as his stomach twists with nausea.
Harry thinks over Riley’s answers, and something – like in Westen’s case – is bothering him, but he is not sure what it is. He has the feeling that Riley had left something unsaid. Riley was probably the last person to see Miss Travers alive, but if he spent the last forty-five minutes of the train ride in the company of his friends, it could be possible that there was someone else who saw the girl after he did. For now, he knows he cannot press further without upsetting both the student and Moonstone. He needs to go over the results from other Aurors who are questioning the Prefects, and if indeed they do not find anything, he will have to approach Riley’s parents to get the permission to question him under Veritaserum.
He takes a step closer, and then another, moving to stand in front of Malfoy – who stays admiringly still, his eyes tracking Harry’s movements. He’s an inch or two taller than Harry is, he only then notices, and is looking slightly downwards at he stares at Harry.
James then speaks about his train ride, after Quinn asks him to, and he tells Quinn that he didn’t see Travers on the ride back. He tells them he spent the most of the ride with his girlfriend and his friends, and only left them for thirty minutes when he briefly met Rose and Hugo, one to two hours before the train reached Hogsmeade.
As soon as Albus and Scorpius walk into the common room from their dormitory to meet the many anxious faces, they see Slughorn beckoning them to him. Albus shares a look with Scorpius, before they walk up to their Head of House. Slughorn tells them that the Headmistress wants to discuss with both of them before they’re allowed to head for breakfast, and says that he will accompany them shortly, after giving instructions to other students. Slughorn also tells them that the Aurors have cleared the school to be safe enough for students to have their meals in the Great Hall, attend classes and mandatory appointments, but that all other hours the students are expected to stay in their common rooms and dormitories, until the investigation is finished.
been at his son’s questioning, and he himself had thought that Scorpius had left some things unsaid.
It is later in the morning, but the breakfast is still being served, and Harry watches as Miss Scott and Miss Westen leave the Entrance Hall together, moving towards the Great Hall, both fidgeting slightly – a somewhat mild aftereffect of Veritaserum, before he turns to the irritated and concerned parents.
Albus clenches his jaw, looking away. Of fucking course. Of course, James will break up with his long-time girlfriend and go after Scorpius instead. Of course, he’ll endanger his whole Quidditch career – or at least, that is what he said it would do, for a – a – what? One, drunken night of necking? Albus shakes his head in frustration. Of course, he’d do so. Because this is Albus’s life, and when has Albus ever got what he wanted? When has James not got everything he wanted?
Malfoy arches a brow at him. “It appears that I am.” His voice is snarky, and Harry walks up to him, still frowning at the other man.
Quinn nods at Draco and Potter, before continuing, “Miss Granger-Weasley said that Travers’s book had been destroyed by her cousin’s joke products, and thus she had felt bad for the girl, having heard what had happened during the New Year’s party. She had lent her book to the other girl, knowing she didn’t really need it for school, and would have it back once Travers had ordered a new copy. Granger-Weasley went to pick up the book from her own trunk, and brought it to Travers’s compartment, approximately one hour before the train arrived Hogsmeade. Granger-Weasley had then seen James giving her brother Hugo Granger-Weasley joke products like the ones previously mentioned, and had confiscated them before returning to her own compartment.”
“What?” Potter breathes, a frown taking place between his brows, his eyes clearing. Then, as it did in Draco’s mind, it happens also in Potter’s. His eyes widen slightly as he realises what exactly is transpiring between them, and how it all ends if they allow it to happen. “Oh.”
“How many can I take?” Harry asks then, in his mind already going through a list of his Aurors who are working or on call.
Neville grins at Harry through his worried expression, while McGonagall gives him a wry look. “I do not have the time to remind you that we are in a first name basis, Harry, but may I say, that we are the ones who are glad to see you,” she says in her strict way, although Harry can detect relief in her tone.
Albus gives his father a disbelieving look. “You really don’t have a clue,” He mutters with annoyance.
Berrycloth clears his throat loudly and turns to look at Potter, who is still standing next to the side table. “Sir – may I suggest that you assign one of us to question both of your boys? It would be better to take care of it without delay, even more so, since there are inconsistencies in the students’ statements, so that we can move on with the investigation as smoothly and quickly as possible.”
“Potter.” Draco murmurs, looking ahead. The other Aurors seem to be minding their own business. “Isn’t – ” he clears his throat. “Is Mrs Potter not joining us?”
Harry stares at his back, watching the infuriating and impossibly handsome wizard, feeling bewildered, feeling light, and wonders, if they will make it through without strangling one another in the process.
“Yeah?” Harry mutters, his mind already going through the possible threats they might confront. He glances at Quinn, whose grim expression doesn’t falter as he speaks to his boss.
in France, and you bloody well know it! And how is me being abroad for work any different than you spending all your time in the Auror office?” Ginny yells, and then narrows her eyes at Harry.
Harry feels equally ashamed that he didn’t – that he and Ginny kept it from their children in the first place. They had the right to know. “I’m sorry. We should’ve told you,” He says letting out a long breath. “You deserved the truth. At least, at the point when we had made our decision.”
Granger pops in right as Quinn and Keir retreat to their rooms, and Potter starts to give Granger a summary of how the investigation is proceeding. Draco packs up his notes, ready to leave the meeting room, but is stopped by Potter.
Hermione gives him a nod. Then, she lets out a long sigh. “The Minister needs an update,” she says with a small grimace. “I have to go back to the Ministry.”
Malfoy looks unaffected by Ginny’s spiteful tone, and merely gives her a blank look before turning towards Harry. “Quinn said you wanted to speak to me, Potter,” he says simply.
James was not questioned about the party under Veritaserum, because Quinn hadn’t seen it important, knowing that Harry had been concerned about the alcohol and the underage kids. And because James had neither seen Scorpius nor Travers during the train ride, there was no way they could’ve put together the truth. Scorpius had asked Travers on the train not to say anything about
“Okay. That’s all for now.” Harry says after a short moment. “Auror Quinn will take you back to your common room.”
Apparently, Travers left soon after the uncomfortable incident, and James and his friends stayed up until the early morning hours. He doesn’t mention the alcohol, and to Harry’s embarrassment and relief, Quinn doesn’t ask about it.
Rose leaves with Ron and Flitwick, towards the Ravenclaw tower, while Hermione stays close to the door, her gaze at Harry.
Harry places his hand against Malfoy’s shoulder, watching his reaction, his throat tight. He watches Malfoy’s every movement very carefully, as he lets his hand slide upwards, his fingers moving, touching Malfoy’s neck, and the line of his jaw, brushing the corner of his lips with his thumb.
Potter looks away, a strained look on his face. “That paradise has ceased to exist over two years ago,” he says very quietly.
“It feels like I know you,” She says very quietly, taking a step towards him. “Like we have a connection.”
Rose nods, letting out a long breath. “I know I shouldn’t – I mean, we weren’t even friends with Jenna, but…I can’t stop thinking how horrible it is, what happened to her,” she says, her voice thick. “…Even though I reckon many people thinks she deserved it,” she says with a displeased tone, biting her lip.
“The school governors have been owling me every hour, as well as the Minister; apparently many of the students’ parents have taken residence in the village, demanding that the school ought to be closed, and the children sent to their homes,” McGonagall says, her tone weary.
have had some impact on Potter’s ‘problems in paradise’? And if so, can Draco expect to be murdered in his sleep now that he’s left the safety of his Manor’s wards?
Harry ceases to rub the bridge of his nose and lifts his head up to meet Peele’s inquiring gaze with his own weary one. “Yeah, long day…” Harry mutters and pushes his glasses back to place. “Thought I came to rest here, but evidently I was wrong,” he jokes feebly, and adds with a small smile, “kids went back to school today.”
James lifts his chin and looks at Quinn, “I’m not proud of what I did, but she was a b…I mean, many people disliked her,” James says simply.
James clears his throat, and Albus can feel his brother looking at him before he speaks. “There are… um… some people, who… make advances at Albus because, well, basically because he looks like you. Like
“Two hours ago, the train arrived to Hogsmeade,” Potter mutters at his watch, and then takes in the scene with a focused frown.
After hastily putting together a couple of sandwiches, Harry slumps down on the comfortable sofa in his sitting room, flicking his wrist to summon a quill and a stack of parchment, as well as Quinn’s and his notes.
His thoughts are interrupted by Quinn, who manages to silence Ginny with a serious expression before he asks James to continue explaining the events of the party.
“Anything new?” Harry asks, sitting heavily opposite to Malfoy, who organises his parchments with a flick of his wand.
“No, I don’t!” Their father yells. “So, tell me, and I might even understand you, Albus!” He says desperately.
“What?” Harry asks, knowing exactly what Moonstone is doing. What he’s always doing – always trying to read people, to figure them out.
Albus’s mind whirls, as he tries to understand what the hell is going on. He thinks hard about everything he just heard. James…did James do it? The mistake? Is – is James the reason Travers is dead? Dread flickers to the bottom of Albus’s stomach; what if Scorpius and James have something to do with Travers’s death? What if one of them…what if they killed her?
“Miss Scott told me that Miss Travers and Mr Malfoy continued their conversation further down the corridor, after noticing that other people were listening to their conversation, making it impossible to hear what they were speaking about. Miss Scott stayed in her compartment with her sister and her sister’s friend Miss Westen. Scott explained how they saw Mr Malfoy and Miss Travers, before Miss Travers’s boyfriend Mr Riley joined them. According to Scott, Mr Riley and Miss Travers soon left back to their compartment.”
“Al – he…knew. He had found it out. He told James and me all about it yesterday,” She says, and then adds with a bitter tone in her voice, “and, well, he told Travers. When they dated, Albus had told Travers that his parents are getting a divorce. Amongst other things,” Lily says, scrunching up her nose in distaste. “She really didn’t have any respect for him.” She says quietly, and gives Harry a sad half smile.
Quinn glances around the table before resuming back to his notes. “He had asked Travers to leave them alone, but the girl had warned Albus to stay out of it, threatening to expose Albus’s secrets to the other students,” Quinn says, his face slightly red.
was different. But he was proved wrong, in the most painful and embarrassing way. The thrill of snogging the boy who looks like the Saviour, is apparently, quite remarkable. Scorpius’s words, not Albus’s, he reckons.
The corners of Peele’s lips quirk up a bit. Harry thinks Peele was brilliant, truth to be told. Harry rarely watches his Aurors training drills due to his workload, but today, he made the exception.
He walks to the castle, and doesn’t look back, even though he wants – even though he wants to run back and demand both James and Scorpius to say it aloud, to tell him what the hell is going on, so that he can prepare himself for what will happen. Instead, he runs into his dad as soon as he steps into the Entrance Hall.
Potter clears his throat, looking quite embarrassed, as he stares hard at the plush, green rug. His mouth moves twice, but no words are coming out.
“Mr Riley,” Harry says kindly, taking note of the ghostly pale and frightened expression on the student’s face. “Take a seat,” he says and gestures at the seating area with three armchairs, two facing one.
Peele is Harry’s newest recruit in the Auror forces, a young lanky man, who has only just finished his training in the Academy. Harry reckons Peele is very promising, and reminds him of himself when he was younger. When everything was different.
Harry looks at Malfoy, sees the closed expression on his face, and wonders, how strained Malfoy’s and his son’s relationship actually is.
“Scorpius told us that Travers had been threatening him without reason and had claimed she was going to tell their classmates that Scorpius and Albus were romantically involved,” Quinn says, his cheeks tinging slightly with red, and Draco wants to roll his eyes at the prude Auror.
As soon as Berrycloth, Fungbury, Keir, Quinn and Draco sit down around the table, Potter starts to speak.
Draco twitches slightly at the name. The bloody Prince Charming – something Scorpius has taught him; a character in a Muggle children’s story, and where his son has even found such Muggle books, Draco doesn’t know – is going to question his son. Draco wants to ask Potter, why he assigned Quinn – is it because he is the best? Draco really fucking hopes so.
“He has a girlfriend,” Albus says, knowing that it is pointless to bring it up. Knowing that he’s a right knobhead to say it.
Harry also knows that he needs to sit down with his own sons, that he needs to figure out what is going on in their lives. If Harry has learned something from the past three days, it is taking a responsibility, and being a parent when it is needed. He and Ginny together will have to do something that is long due: be honest to their children. And in return, perhaps, they will do the same.
Moonstone is immaculately dressed, as always, his brown hair neatly done, but his owlish features now darkened with seriousness. Harry nods at the man. “Moonstone.”
Harry lets out a weary sigh and leans back in his chair, checking his dented old watch that had once belonged to Fabian Prewett. Seven-thirty. He wonders if the kids have already arrived to the Great Hall for the welcome feast. He makes a mental note to write to James the next day, to inquire if anyone has yet contacted him after the Quidditch trials he participated earlier that week.
Albus gapes at her, thinking about what the bloody hell the girl just said. “You don’t even know me! How could you – how can you think that you’re in –”
It takes about thirty seconds for Albus to realise what exactly has happened. Yes, he was suspecting that Scott was the one who had told the Aurors that it was only Scorpius who had been having a row with Travers. But now he understands why.
Berrycloth goes to the bar to order them some food, while Harry takes a steadying breath before entering the private chamber of the pub.
Right as he’s buttoning up his robes, getting ready to leave towards his empty home, someone barges into his office.
“Well, I wasn’t sure if you two could keep your hands away from each other, considering what happened the last time you met,” Hermione says to Draco in a saccharine tone, her smile wide.
Harry sighs, and sees the alarmed looks in Mr and Mrs Travers’s eyes. “But what she didn’t know – what she failed to realise, was when to stop.”
“Your oldest son organised a party during New Year’s Eve, and Miss Travers was seen there,” Smith says, looking very uncomfortable.
Ginny lets out a shocked breath, gaping at James. Harry is similarly stunned; he stares at his son, feeling horrified, and wonders who is this boy and what has he done to Harry’s good-mannered son James? Because until now Harry had been sure James doesn’t speak like that about others, or treat others like he apparently had.
“Hey, Al,” Rose says, catching up with Albus as he walks along the edge of the frozen lake after breakfast – after McGonagall had ushered everyone out and informed that their classes were dismissed for the day.
Potter then clears his throat and looks at the others. “There is something else,” Potter says, chewing the inside of his cheek as he flicks his wand at the book on the table.
Draco nearly dies, gasping for breath, as Potter starts to jerk him off in swift motions. Potter brings his mouth against Draco’s, kissing him urgently, sucking and licking his lips, biting them.
It is somewhat uncomfortable, at first. Draco hasn’t seen Weasley in what has to be years, let alone spoken to him. However, to Draco’s surprise, Weasley is actually…civil. He gives Draco a polite nod, greeting him, before moving to shake hands with the Aurors and Potter.
There’s still Albus, and after that, Harry can focus again. When Albus’s questioning is over, after the Veritaserum has removed any possible suspicion towards Harry’s younger son, they’re back in the beginning. This time, however, Harry will be glad to have been wasting two days, if he can prove that the suspicions towards his children can be removed.
Smith manages to look even more uncomfortable. “There was…a dispute, between James and Miss Travers,” Smith continues quietly.
Quinn looks at Harry, helplessness flickering in his eyes, asking with his gaze if they should continue, or if they should somehow try to figure out if Albus is lying.
Albus feels irritated as his day has gone by in different kinds of interrogations held by his father, mother and the Aurors, and running to his classes, while his friends have had their free periods and enjoyed what sounds like a victorious snowball fight against the fifth year Ravenclaws.
“Whatever happens between Ginny and me, we are both still going to be in your life, like we always have. And in Albus’s and James’s,” Harry murmurs, hugging Lily tighter against him. “Even though your mother and I will not be married nor live together, that doesn’t mean that we don’t care for each other.”
“Hi,” Harry says tentatively, stepping forward. “There’s, um, ink. On your – just – there,” He mutters, pointing at his left temple.
Albus narrows his eyes at Scorpius, crossing his arms over his chest. “Does it bloody matter how I found out?” He hisses, “What matters, is that you went behind my back, without asking me, if it was okay to go for my
Draco watches as Potter continues the inspection. “It could be possible. That her locking spell was simply…weak. However, I doubt it could leave the signature to the door, and
“Alright there, sir?” Peele asks as he walks by Harry’s office while pulling on his robes, finishing for the day. “Long day, eh?”
Quinn introduces himself – kind of unnecessary, as both Albus and his mother have met the guy before – and then explains how the investigation will go forward. He tells them that they do not have any suspects yet, and that they are only hoping to get as much information about the train ride and the victim – Albus almost shudders at that – as possible.
“In a backwards order; Locking spell, Vanishing spell, Levitating spell, Vanishing spell, Summoning spell, Duplicating spell, Colour Changing spell; all performed during that particular day,” Draco says, reading from the report.
Does Scorpius know something about Travers’s death? Surely, he would tell Albus if he did - they tell each other everything. Albus knows everything about his friend. He knows about Scorpius’s childhood, his relationship with his dad, and how Scorpius still misses his mother. He knows what annoys Scorpius the most, and how to calm him down. Scorpius has spent so much time with Albus and Albus’s family during the past few years, that it is like he’s one of Albus’s siblings. Except he is not his brother. Definitely not. Still, Scorpius doesn’t keep secrets from Albus. Hell, Albus even knows the girls his friend has fancied during the past years – not that Scorpius has had the courage to ask anyone out – and the fact that his friend hasn’t kissed anyone.
“Is it because what happened?” Draco asks, finally putting in words the thought that has been swirling in his mind since that morning. If what happened between him and Potter is in fact the reason Potter is divorcing his wife.
Quinn looks at Potter. “Even though Albus didn’t seem to be distressed at any point of the questioning, and explained the events rather openly, there is still the fact that Albus and the victim have history together, and he admitted that they were in bad terms some months prior to Travers’s death. Thus, he will be questioned under Veritaserum.”
Malfoy is there, with a handful of parchments scattered over the table. He lifts his head up, his gaze dropping at Harry, and Harry sees a deep frown between his pale brows.
