"He's broken through the house's protections," he said, probably unnecessarily. He was sure both Iana and Effie had felt the same as him.
"Then we definitely need help," said Iana. "There is no way I'm going to try that here."
"And I can have a look around to see if I can find anything that might relate to Rowena Ravenclaw," she replied.
"And perhaps your friends," said Dumbledore with a nod. "I will continue to do what I can, of course, but you should at least consider it. You have demonstrated a certain admirable latitude of thought in your time at Hogwarts, after all." He chuckled.
were in Hogwarts."
His father, James Potter chuckled and ruffled Harry's hair, much to Harry's dismay. Harry ducked out from under the offending hand. His hair was hard enough to manage as it was without his father's constant attempts to muss it up even more.
"Oh, hoh? So you're on our side now?" Harry asked, his voice rising an octave. "What have you done to help, then? How did that letter go? Haven't seen it in the Prophet yet. Was it too painful to write nice things about the Headmaster?"
He heard an inelegant snort behind him, and realised that Iana was still there. He turned, ready to defend against whatever verbal barbs were about to be levelled.
"What!" Harry yelped, realising what she meant. He peered at her more closely, but couldn't see any sign of whatever it was that had removed the Horcrux without killing her.
"With all their crazy prank inventions they must have found a few safe places to hide them away too," said Neville, nodding in agreement.
"Then she wished me farewell. She used my real name to do it."
James was just pulling the door open when Harry slid around the corner, his fluffy Christmas socks providing almost no traction on the polished wood flooring of the hall.
As he returned to his book, Harry started to wonder just how he was going to break the news to his friends. In a way talking to Iana about it might actually have been easier, at least she'd be coming into the discussion with some inkling of what Harry would have to deal with. He tried to envisage how his friends would deal with it, but came up pretty much completely blank.
Neville gave them a funny look. "That was weird. Are you two okay?"
"No," said Harry as he returned his gaze to the interminable ramblings of Odiosis Auctor.
Harry lost track of the number of hugs, handshakes and pats on the back he had to endure from the defenders and Aurors, but eventually he was able to make good his escape to a quieter room, away from the uproarious celebrations of the survivors.
"Wouldn't shaggability mean something more like how good they are at sex?" asked Ron. "Don't you mean… I dunno… uhh…" He trailed off.
"I just…" she seemed to run out of words like a climber grasping at air. "What about the Diadem?"
Despite living with her for more than fifteen years, he still had very little insight into how her brain actually worked. He'd once asked his friend Ron if he had any real understanding of how his own sister's mind worked and had been gratified to learn that he didn't either.
"Ow, tough luck there," said Dean as he grinned unsympathetically. "I'll knock one back for you!"
"We should retire to somewhere more comfortable," said Dumbledore. He still had that same air of immortal stability, but something about it was off. Harry couldn't put his finger on it.
It wasn't obvious if Helena actually heard him. She seemed lost in her memories as her spectral hands fiddled with the bloody stain in the centre of her chest. "I knew he was coming for me, and so I hid it within one of the trees, in an old wood nymph's nest. When he arrived, he imagined himself a dashing saviour. All false courtesy and charm, but I had never needed my mother's favoured trinket to see his true purpose. I told him I would not return with him, and that I would never marry him.
"And no, I haven't killed anyone. A few spiders, rats, that kind of thing." The look she gave him actually seemed a little sad, as if she was disappointed that he'd even think of asking.
about before I have to wheedle it out of Neville."
"They're escaping!" one of the Death Eaters cried. Harry couldn't recognise the voice, but it was obviously a woman.
But Harry was having none of it, he ducked under her arm, and shook off her attempt to grab him. He ignored her shouts as he ran to follow his father.
In reality, they only actually spent an hour or two each week looking through names. The rest of the time they spent researching spells that might be useful somehow against Voldemort.
"And I am a merciful saviour. I present to you a choice, one which I trust will be simple. Surrender Iana Malfoy to me, and I will allow you all to return home in safety. If you do not, I will not be responsible for any damage caused to Hogwarts, or injuries caused to the children in your charge."
"What?" Iana peered at it, clearly not recognising it.
"Hurry up, Potter."
She shook her head. "They won't have much choice. I think everyone knows that even if Voldemort let us leave, it wouldn't be long before we had Aurors knocking down our doors."
That didn't stop Rosier's face from displaying a self-satisfied grin.
"Maybe you didn't notice, with how much your family likes to slum it around muggles, but the Malfoy name carries quite a bit of weight," said Iana. "He's gathering allies. Calling in favours. Dumbledore and his stupid sycophants—" she paused a second, seemingly realising that Harry's family fell into that group "—no offense, I guess. Well, they'd just get in the way."
Her head snapped up and her eyes narrowed. "How did you know that? I thought you said Dumbledore didn't tell you anything?"
Realising just what it was she'd done, Harry grinned at her. "That was pretty good, actually." He frowned, there was still one problem. "But we still can't destroy it here. Unless you have some other idea?"
"Here, did you and her get into it?" asked Seamus, eyes wide.
It was a few minutes before either of them spoke but Effie's death-grip did slowly loosen.
And he'd get to take a look.
She rubbed her face tiredly, and her expression suggested she really wasn't sure about whatever it was she was going to tell him. Eventually, though, she sighed and started speaking.
"After You-Know-Who fell, Malfoy said that Rosier was a spy for him in the Death Eaters," Ron supplied. "I remember it cos Mum is still up in arms about it. She reckons he paid Malfoy off."
"Uh. Okay," he said, hoping he didn't look as clueless as he felt.
Horror had given way to an intense desire to simply flee, and yet something kept him rooted to the chair. "Sir, why are you telling me this? What can
"Well, kinda," said Harry. "They're how Voldemort came back to life. Or maybe how he didn't die. Honestly, I don't really understand how they
"You just like redheads," said Harry shaking his head.
"Maybe," said Harry with a shrug before returning to his book. He started counting to himself, and only reached four before he was subject to an annoyed huff from the other side of the table.
"But Harry knows!"
Understanding dawned on her face, before it was quickly eclipsed. "But they're
All thought stopped when she threw herself at him, and captured his lips with hers. Time came to a standstill once again, and he lost himself in the desperate passion of the kiss. Something salty lingered on her lips, but that was soon lost against the smell, the taste of her. She was magnificent.
"Damned if I know," said James, shifting his gaze to Dumbledore. "What's happened, Albus?"
Harry glanced across at Ron and Justin, but it was clear he was going to find no help there.
She lapsed into silence again, clearly thinking about what had happened that night. Suddenly, she chuckled. It wasn't a happy sound. "Not that he told me anything else either," she said bitterly. "Even my name is a lie, apparently."
"Well? Get to it!"
He was stopped by Dumbledore's forceful arrival. He pushed his way in, a small, bedraggled figure in tow, and slammed it shut behind him. Harry recognised the person accompanying Dumbledore instantly.
Neville nodded, and added, "All the rest of it is really just identifying you. That line, 'his hand, her heart' seems to be the really important bit, though."
Harry stood up, a little shakily, but he quickly found his balance returning. He reached down to help Iana up and if anything she was even more shaky on her feet than he. She didn't manage to stay upright more than a second before she stumbled into him as one of her legs refused to cooperate with the other.
Well, a bit more than three quarters of the people, anyway. A lot of the Slytherins, many of whom had taken a bit of a beating themselves when they'd unwisely tried to fight back against teachers and adults, looked significantly less happy about things. Harry had hardly been surprised. Many of them had family members among the masked Death Eaters.
When he reached the corridor which contained the entrance to the Headmaster's office he found Dumbledore already waiting for him. Fawkes, proud and resplendent in red and gold, sat on his shoulder.
The hesitance in her voice was something almost completely new to Harry, but he knew it was mostly his own doing. He had
"Take a look," said Harry, who'd had just that thought.
"That's fine," said Harry as he silenced any further questions from Effie with a look. "What about a bath? You're looking pretty grubby. Maybe it'll make you feel better?"
Voldemort obviously realised the same thing. He peered at the Headmaster with open suspicion. "What schemes do you have planned? You know that tricks will not work on me."
Realising that he'd managed to tread on precariously thin ice, Harry retreated back to his side of the desk and behind his book once more. Just as well, too, as Madam Pince chose that moment to poke her nose around the corner of the shelves to look at them both with naked suspicion.
"I know that," said Harry, running a hand through his hair as he spoke. "I do. But there's a difference between protecting me, and leaving me completely clueless when some fucking psycho comes to kill me."
She turned on Harry, hands set on her hips in a fashion that was less intimidating than she likely imagined. "What did you say to her?"
"I know," said Remus. He rubbed Harry's arm comfortingly, but it was undermined by the way his voice cracked. "You don't need to try to convince me, or anyone else, that you made the right choice. Do you think I wouldn't have killed him if I'd had half a chance?"
Usually that would have warranted at least some form of sarcastic reply, but this time, she didn't even look up. It was only at that point that Harry realised just how dishevelled Iana looked. Her face was blotchy with grime and the hair, which hung across much of her face like a curtain, was encrusted with dirt and blood. Her clothes too were torn up and filthy. One hand was clamped around something small and silvery, her grip tight enough that her knuckles were completely white. When she finally did look up, her eyes were black, with bloodshot whites and she seemed to look right through him.
"Seriously, Harry, what's gotten into you?" asked Neville when he caught Harry looking up at the Headmaster for what was probably the fifth time that evening.
"Yeah," said Seamus helpfully. "Ron was just saying how hungry he was. Didn't get enough down you at dinner, did you?"
Harry glared. "I guess I just don't see the point of wasting them on
Dean frowned, clearly taken aback. "That's months away, though. They're already saying they managed to catch up with some of them. They'll all be locked away again by the time we're out of this place, so why would we need protecting?" Something dawned on him. "Wait, does this have something to do with whatever it was old Dumbledore had to say to you on your birthday? You went weird after that too. You do know he's mad, right?"
"You really don't know what it's about?"
"You only got those because the Magpies all got dragonpox and had to forfeit," said Seamus.
He rushed out of the classroom, and ran the short distance to the Infirmary only to find it completely empty. He heard some kind of shout from outside the window and ran over to it to look out over the grounds.
If she was expecting some kind of acknowledgement from Snape, she was to be sorely disappointed. "Yet you are still here," he said, simply. "Curfew has already passed. Do not dilly dally."
Then, suddenly, Dumbledore's wand came up and a shockwave ripped through the room sending Harry, Iana and Lucius scrambling to the floor. The two Death Eaters were downed by it too, and the half-burned mask came off to reveal the surprised face of Professor Rosier.
An explosion of fetid air blasted him flat onto the ground, and stole the breath from his lungs. He might have blacked out for a second, or he may just have blinked, but when he opened his eyes, the fire was completely gone. Motes of fine black soot drifted slowly towards the ground, and in the centre of their cleared circle, the Diadem was barely more than a rapidly cooling puddle of glowing metal.
When Dumbledore reached the desk, he looked over and let out a hiss-like breath. Unable to curb his curiosity, Harry peered over too, and met the open, glassy eyes of a young woman whom he could easily recognise. He breathed in sharply, and might even have cried out had he not already been silenced. It was Nymphadora Tonks. Sirius' favourite cousin, and someone Harry had known for years. Usually she wore her hair in vibrant hues; blue, yellow, green or pink, but in death it had returned to an unremarkable mousy brown. For some reason, that really drove it home. She was really dead. She'd always seemed so… alive. Now her eyes, usually so full of life, were empty. Just like that, she was gone. Everything she'd been was nothing more than a memory.
Harry pulled out his dragon-hide gloves, a lifesaver which Sirius had suggested to him after his first detention with Snape, and started scrubbing as he did his best to ignore the periodic suspicious glare from the potions Professor.
"Elf!" Iana snapped, her tone one of command. Incredibly, Snooks stopped writhing on the ground, and stared up at her with wide, pain-filled eyes. "Stop wasting my time. You are to return to the kitchen to seek aid from the other Elves immediately. Understand?"
"No matter how old you get, you'll still be our son," said Lily, her voice sounding a little sad. "Is it so bad that we want to protect you from everything that's happening as long as we possibly can?"
"You gotta admit that your Da's a lucky bastard," said Seamus, backing up his friend. "I mean, I totally would."
Before Harry could say anything to stop her, she was gone. He'd just have to hope that she didn't manage to convince Neville that she somehow already knew. He trusted Neville, though. More than he'd trust someone like Seamus to keep the secret, at any rate.
"Sirius," Lily sighed, shaking her head. "You don't need to answer that."
"It is so similar," was the first thing she said.
"Seems like it might have a better chance of working than hiding at home," Harry snapped back.
"Harry, you should—"
Harry stared at the impossible room. Shelves stretched far into the distance, each more than a dozen feet tall, and straining under the load of the accumulated bric-á-brac of centuries. He whistled to himself. "This is…"
As children greeted their friends, and shuffled past each other, lugging trunks bigger than them through the narrow carriage doors, it was like the last month had only been a dream.
It was obvious she was trying to put it off, but Harry couldn't really work out
"We would have stopped her," said Lily, wiping new tears from her cheeks, "but she knew that."
Helena continued, unaware of the byplay. "So I stole it from her. I took it from her rooms while she slept, and fled the castle. I wonder which it was that most concerned her; my disappearance, or the Diadem's."
Was that really the only reason Dumbledore wanted to see him? Perhaps his skepticism showed on his face, as the Headmaster chuckled.
sense of style.
"I'd know."
He glared at all three of them, but when his mother could no longer restrain her laughter he couldn't help but join in.
"Well, what?"
The next day, Harry checked out a copy of Hogwarts: A History. Pince had eyed him with poorly concealed suspicion, but remained otherwise quiet. As he trailed through the stacks in search of his familiar table, he was sure he could feel her attention on him.
Almost immediately, the color returns to his face and he straightens. He stares into the goblet for a moment before inhaling deeply.
I look at him incredulously, but then I remember he can't see me and turn my gaze to the ground.
Once again, curiosity hits me. What does Malfoy do in his free time? What does he do for work? Potion Master is sounding more likely now if he has supplies at home.
Then, she blows on it, making the letters scatter into a flurry of petals.
"These are the ones dealing with curses." I pull out a book bound in dragonhide. It looks forbidding and, when I open it, it wails. I quickly cast a spell to silence it.
" I splutter, but Blaise is already laughing.
A soft knock interrupts the silence. Draco doesn't look up.
"So that brings me back to my point." Luna pokes me in the arm. "Harry's your soulmate. He loves you. I don't think that love like that can be torn apart. I was there for some of what happened to you. I know some of those things you won't talk about. They don't change how I feel about you at all."
Draco's hips jerk as I press my tongue into his slit, but I'm expecting it and move with him to avoid choking on his length. Pressing his hips back onto the bed, I set a rhythm of bobbing my head over what I can comfortably fit in my mouth. It's not much. I can barely get half of him in. I didn't learn how to deepthroat for nothing though.
He heard Draco mutter a spell. There was a brief sting of a cleaning spell directly on his arse. Before he could question it, Draco sat up.

Harry gives me a look that says he knows full well I'm trying to divert his attention. "My memories of Anthony. I gave them to Kingsley when I filed for DAISIES."
Hermione's mouth fell open as she sat down at a desk heavily. Harry raked his fingers through his hair.
Anthony stands, setting his broom aside, and steps towards me. At first, I think he's going to hit me, but he grabs my chin and forces me to look at him.
"I'm glad you enjoyed it." Ginny kisses Luna's temple.
What happened next was a blur. Later, Harry remembered being dragged off to the cellar. He remembered Ron screaming for Hermione. He remembered Hermione's shrieks of pain. Luna. Ollivander. Dobby. Griphook. Wormtail. The chandelier.
The barrier lets me through. The gate opens under my hand. When I look up at the manor, I see a few rooms are lit.
"He's never hit me," I object, frowning.
"Congratulations on getting married," I gasp, hugging her back.
(See the end of the chapter for
When I blink again, I feel like I'm coming out of a daze.
"A bit… but I'm more relieved that I found you and you're alive." I lean up to kiss him gently.
"I may have seen it in a movie that my old babysitter likes." Harry grinned slightly. "I'll show it to you sometime."
"First you, now George. Everyone I love is ending up with Slytherins." Ron sighs, looking highly put upon. "Next, Pansy Parkinson will confess her undying love for Hermione with the way this is going."
I feel like I've swallowed a dozen stones.
"Oh, he was, but the Dursleys didn't know that." Harry smirks.
"Is something wrong, sir?" Kreacher asks, shuffling over to me with a butterbeer.
Draco half sits up, watching me move down his body. I keep my eyes fixed on his until I reach my destination. Pulling his foreskin down, I lick the salty bead that has gathered on his slit and groan.
Kreacher stays silent for so long, I wonder if he heard me. Just as I'm about to repeat myself, he answers me.
"Ron's right! We need to find the other horcrux!" Hermione coughed.
"He's dead," Ron snapped.
forcing Draco into a friendship and not letting him get out of it.
Harry pulls the ring box out of his pocket and opens it between our faces. "Draco, will you accept this ring as a promise of how much I love you and my vow to stay by your side for the rest of our lives?"
"No way. Luna is much better at potions. She'll make it." Ginny rolls her eyes and runs off.
"You really can't. Your heart condition needs to be taken care of." Potter gives me a forced smile.
"Draco. I know Harry. He's oblivious to a lot of things, but I can tell he likes you." She folds her legs in the lotus position. "Time for meditation."
We land outside the manor. The manor's windows are dark. It looks abandoned.
He tilts his face up to mine and gives me a small grateful smile. Even such a small look of gratitude is enough to make my heart skip a beat. Harry looks absolutely lovely when he smiles.
The magic that freaks me out is magic that attacks a person's mind. There's a spell to make the victim hear voices in their head until they are driven insane. There's one that saps a person's will to live slowly until they commit suicide.
"You have no mother." Petunia's lips purse, looking like she just sucked on a lemon. She snatches the flower out of Harry's hand. "And where did you get this? Did you trail dirt into my house?"
"Well, not all of it is," Blaise says, a smirk tugging on his lips. "You are his patient. Tell me, is it sexy to be sleeping with your healer?"
"Yes."
"We're going to figure out how to break this curse. There's bound to be something in our library."
My heart is pounding in my chest. If Draco went there… he will be surrounded by memories that could kill him. It barely crosses my mind that the manor looked empty thirty minutes ago.
The sadness in Mr Goldstein is clear to see as he fights with his tears during the interview and this reporter is shocked by what she hears. “I don’t even know what happened,” he admits. “We were so happy and out of nowhere, he first ends our relationship, then a few days later breaks all contact. I was shocked when I found out about the reason.”
"Because I'm tired of waiting... if you are."
"Clearly, I am awake. Thanks for stating the obvious. Why are you here, Potter?"
"It's still our
I didn't want to know him either. I didn't give a damn if he had changed. I just wanted to forget him and be done with it.
It's a ridiculous question. Of course my mother is happy; she loves me. It's just that I need to say it aloud to really process it. I don't know if I can take away her hope. I feel Luna's nod. It's getting harder to keep my resolve to try to find another way.
Draco was pulling the covers over them when Harry thought of something else. He had been thinking about how making love to Draco had been even better than flying.
"Luna!" I feel my face heat as I squirm away.
"Harry's back."
Lucius Malfoy is standing on the other side, looking panicked.
I'm addicted to Harry's laugh. It makes my chest feel warm. "You're not my healer anymore right?"
"The Chosen One is escorting me home?" Malfoy tilts his head, looking up at me through pale lashes.
I pinch the bridge of my nose. Truth be told, I don't think my father will care that I'm gay. I am fairly certain he would have a heart attack if he knew I'm in love with Potter.
Draco is lying in his bed. His lips are turning white. I rush to his side.
"You're not any of those things. You're not weak. You're not a mess. You're hurting. Honestly, I think you are strong. You wake up every day and face those hurts. That's it's own kind of bravery."
There is another silence at those words. I know we all want to go and be by his side, but Hermione is right.
Harry shot Ron a reproachful look and glanced around. The only people in the corridor were the five of them and Goyle was still out cold.
If you liked this chapter, feel free to leave a comment! I love it when people say hi ♡♡♡
I go to him, running my fingers over his forehead. His skin is returning to its usual pallor. He's warming up.
There is no crack of bone when my fist collides with his cheek. There's no pain from the impact. Instead, an intense light fills the room. I have to shield my eyes against it.
I haven't had much contact with the Weasleys since the war. The only one who tried to approach me is Ginny. The others... well, I stay away from people who don't want me around. I've never had the chance to apologize for all of the cruelty of my youth. Then again... I don't think an apology would ever mean anything coming from me. So, instead, I focus on the gratitude.
"That is so over dramatic," Anthony mutters, rolling his eyes.
"I… am going to go let your parents and everyone know you're awake." Harry blinks at Pansy slowly, looking faintly nervous.
"You're still my healer. Isn't there some law about healers dating their patients?"
"Gods, you smell so good when you're working," I murmur, sucking gently on his earlobe. "Makes me wanna take my time and lick every inch of skin."
"I put protection and healing magic into them. They were meant to keep him safe from even the sight of the mark." Luna rubs her hand over Draco's forearm gently. "I'll have to remake…"
"You'll be there with me. We can heal them together," I try to explain.
"I'm not his healer anymore. Hermione took over for me when the head healer on my floor figured out I'm emotionally compromised," I say absently.
I steel myself against that impulse. It's important to Harry that I see this. I might hunt Goldstein down though. It depends on if I can sneak away from Harry without him noticing. Which I probably can't… but Pansy could and she's much more ruthless than I am.
I step out of my home. I need to break up with Anthony today. I'm done with him. I am done with the abuse and manipulation.
Or Blaise had just been teasing me - which is equally likely.
I'm just exiting a patient's room when someone slams into me. I grunt, grabbing the man to steady him. It's Arthur.
"I've been wanting..." he trails off. "I've liked you for years. I think since we met. Hasn't that been enough time?"
"Wait. I need to..." he inhaled, keeping his distance. "I need to turn it off."
"I know that, but I'm consenting to you right now. You're normal. There's no compulsion. Besides, your cock is already in my arse," Harry pointed out, waggling his eyebrows.
"How can you be sure that it will work?" Draco asks, looking scared.
Draco murmured a wandless spell before running his tongue over Harry's cock. Harry still felt like he was going to cum any second, but he couldn't. It was like something was blocking it.
"I think he burned them," said Harry. "A spell called Fiendfyre? He said to only do it in a location where there was no one around."
She gives Potter a curtsy. "I am relieved, sir. No one will harm Draco if you're protecting him."
"What the fuck? Why is a Death Eater after Draco? Why is his heart all fucked up? When the hell did Potter start kissing him?" Zabini demands, his arms tightening around Draco.
"It's still you, Draco. I consent to you. You won't hurt me… I trust you."
"Speak for yourself," Weasley mutters, slouching in his chair.
"Memories look really strange when they're not in someone's head," I mutter, leaning closer.
"Well… what do you think?" he asks quietly. "Did seeing me at my worst make you pity me or think less of me? Do you still love me?"
"We'll help her if she needs it," Hermione says, relieved. "Who else is transferring?"
"You should be used to that by now," I tease.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I am!"
"What do you need with a bunch of flowers?" Anthony demands. "We're leaving, Harry. This is our relationship and this man has nothing to do with that."
At least one person doubts that: Mr Anthony Goldstein, former boyfriend of Harry Potter. For about half a year, the two of them had been inseparable, the love between them palpable and deep - even marriage and starting a family was already a topic between the two lovebirds, as Mr Goldstein now reveals. “We were so happy and in love. Such close parts of each other’s lives.”
"Kreacher?"
Ginny is the one who opens the door to the chateau when I knock. She looks tired, but alert.
"Or you can watch me prepare myself if you still need to catch your breath."
My mother is looking at the vial in Harry's hand curiously, but she glances up at his words. "Take care of my son."
"Right. I forgot that most people faint when they see a viper." Potter's tone is dripping with sarcasm.
I feel heat rise to my cheeks. I need to get a grip on myself. Malfoys do not blush. This is the third time I've blushed today. Potter is making me stupidly flustered... especially now that I know he is bisexual.
She must have heard me anyways.  "Harry's theory is right. It is a curse that affects your mind and heart. There's no doubt now."
His eyes scan over the article, darting back and forth. When he finishes it, he sets the paper down on the desk.
"And you call Luna and me disgustingly sweet," I hear Ginny scoff as I close the door to the library behind me.
"What is a mov-?" Draco started, but was promptly cut off by Harry's lips.
"Yes. The only way for a male veela to actually manifest their veela traits, is if they get their... well, fated mate's blood in their system." Hermione glanced at Harry. "You said you tried muggle first aid to stop Malfoy's bleeding... and your hand was bleeding. Did you place that hand directly on Malfoy's wound?"
"Same here… that was the best sex I've ever had," I mumble, resting my head on his shoulder. A second later I jerk up, causing Draco to slip out of me. "Wait, how is your heart? I didn't check on you at all!"
Dumbledore took his seat, behind the large, ornate desk, and gestured towards the seat in front of him. Once Harry was seated, Dumbledore leaned forward, and fixed him with an intense look.
Iana looked like she wanted to argue, but when another explosion blasted chunks of her transfigured wall across the room, she realised how stupid that would be, and darted through the door. Harry slammed it shut and spelled it locked again.
"So much hostility," she said as she shook her head. "Be careful, Weasley. I might get the impression that you dislike me."
"Isn't Dumbledore still looking for them?" Dean asked, looking every bit as reluctant as Harry felt about trying to hunt something like that down.
"Now, it is getting very late indeed, and we have yet to discuss the matters which prompted me to ask for your time."
"You have been misled. By Dumbledore. By Lucius Malfoy. I am no monster who would kill children. I would not train them for war as Lucius Malfoy did. I will not leave them floundering in the dark like Dumbledore. I am the saviour of our kind."
On the other hand, Professor Stump had looked perversely pleased about things, while Snape had settled for verbally mauling anyone unwise enough to walk down the same corridor.
The scream that the elder Malfoy let out was something that Harry knew would live on in his nightmares. He'd heard of the effects of the Cruciatus Curse, but nothing he'd heard or read could have prepared him for the outpouring of agony that came from Lucius as his body, clearly held up and stationary by spells, twitched and shuddered.
With one final look down at where James and Sirius were throwing spells Harry didn't recognise through holes blown in the wall, he pelted after his mother and sister, Iana hot on his heels. As Lily ran the length of the corridor, she flicked her wand at each door in turn, slamming them all shut, and locking them. Soon, the only door left open was the one to the master bedroom. The moment they all made it through the doorway, it too slammed shut behind them, and the entire wall adopted a metallic sheen.
"That is certainly the story most of the world knows." Dumbledore steepled his hands and leaned forward. "There are a few understandable inaccuracies, some gross fabrication, and a little pure fantasy. The true story of what happened that night is wholly more strange, I think.
"Nice," said Dean. After a brief reluctant pause, he turned to Iana. "What about you, Malfoy?"
"Only after my father died, I think," she said wearily. "I think Snape told him."
He reached down to take Iana's empty hand. It was cold and clammy to the touch, but as soon as his hand slipped into hers, she grasped it with a strength he wouldn't have thought her capable of. He led her slowly up the stairs, turning back once to see Lily giving him an unreadable look just before she headed into the dining room.
He hadn't been okay, and he still wasn't good. But he was
"No, no!" Harry tried to reinforce his innocence by raising his hands. He realised he'd let his voice rise above a whisper and lowered it again. "I just thought that if anyone knew what was going on, it'd be you, right?"
At least Rosier had disappeared after his unmasking at the Ministry. That was one fewer person to worry about.
Then he grinned, and it was the very first smile he'd been able to conjure since that night on his birthday. He could feel the muscles of his face protest at the unfamiliar expression, but they eventually complied.
It wasn't only Iana that was avoiding him. It soon became clear that Dumbledore was too. Even Harry's own parents hadn't said much. His mum had clearly been beside herself with worry when she'd found out about what had happened, but every attempt Harry had made to get anything out of her, his dad or Sirius had come up empty. All Harry knew was that they were all monumentally pissed off at Peter for falling asleep while on watch.
"A Prophecy foretelling the coming of the Girl Who Lived," Voldemort continued, seemingly unable to feel the blazing heat of Harry's glare. "Even Fate, it seems, is nothing to the power of Lord Voldemort."
Dean and Neville exchanged a look. "Oh, no, no, no," said Dean, shaking his head emphatically. "You're not getting away with it that easy. What
"Potter!" she hissed, eyes wide in shock. "What are you—"
"You no doubt hoped for a quiet resurrection. Perhaps the mysterious death of Lucius and his daughter?" Dumbledore suggested. "Your agents could then operate almost unimpeded within these very Halls to make them ready for your return. None of this can happen now. You would do well to retreat."
As Harry had no idea, really, he settled for shrugging. "Dunno. Revise, I guess."
The silence that followed that question stretched out even longer than the previous ones. Eventually, she replied, "You can stay. What do you mean
Harry cracked open the huge volume and started to read through the sections specifically relating to the founders. At least Bathilda Bagshot had some idea of how to retain a reader's interest. There was still a lot to get through, though. It seemed as if she was intent on covering every event in their lives which had led up to their choice to create Hogwarts Castle, and being some of the most powerful and famous witches and wizards of the time, there was no shortage of them.
"Yeah. Somewhere in Hogwarts, probably," said Harry. "Problem is, it's a pretty big castle, in case you hadn't noticed."
"I didn't tell you everything," she said. Her voice was little more than a whisper. "I didn't lie, but I kept something from you. The Prophecy. I know what it said."
"Ah, so the Malfoy whelp takes more after her mother than her father, it seems," said Voldemort and if anything he sounded impressed. "Hand it over girl, and perhaps you may even live."
"Fuck that," he grumbled. He shifted a bit and grimaced. "Bastard can have another go if he wants."
"Mr. Potter!"
"Any further argument will result in additional detentions."
"What!"
"What is it?" he called back.
From his position prone on the ground, Peter cast a curse of his own at Lily, but that too never had the chance to reach its target. Dumbledore took a single step to his side, straight into the path of the curse, which blasted him backwards with enough force to knock Lily over.
"Don't remind me," Iana grumbled, though there was little fire to it. That had burned itself out a few weeks ago. "So it has something to do with dear old Father?"
As Harry settled into the conjured chair he realised two things. One, it was very comfortable indeed. Two, it was so squishy that he may as well have been laying down on the ground. He found he had to look up to meet the eyes of either of the older men. In the case of Snape that wasn't much of a hardship, though. He looked like he wanted Harry to spontaneously combust.
"I'm good," he'd claimed.
"It was." Iana shrugged as if that didn't really matter any more. "Didn't matter."
Lily clearly understood what he meant and turned to her daughter. "Effie, dear, could you maybe give us a few minutes?"
There was little doubt in Harry's mind that Iana would have simply laughed the advice off had it come from anyone other than the Headmaster.
"I do not doubt you can," said Dumbledore, nodding amiably. "But please, indulge an old man. It is only a short distance, after all."
At that moment Lily arrived, with Effie close on her heels. "Harry you—" She halted as she took in the scene in the hall before restarting. "You poor thing!" she said, clearly in the direction of Iana. "James, what's going on?"
"Oh yes she— Ow!"
"Seriously fucked up."
With that last word she keeled over and fell to the ground with a bone rattling thump. James darted over to her and cast a couple of spells over her.
Perhaps Iana had a death wish, but she didn't back down an inch. "We're returning to our dorms after having detention with Professor Snape," she said tightly. "You can ask him."
"How many of the things did he make?" said Iana, a look of fascinated horror on her face. "Does he have any soul left?" She trailed off, and looked thoughtful. "Though I guess it might explain why he looks like… that."
"Needs more than just me," said Effie with a sideways grin at Harry. "Got himself chucked out of the library."
Harry quashed the bubble of annoyance that welled up that his mother had had sixteen years to prepare herself for all this, while he'd had a few months at best. "The bit that's got us puzzled is the line about Iana's heart killing Voldemort," he said.
"Besides, I'm going to be spending the whole time revising too," Effie added. "Mum can be a right pain." She glanced at Harry. "Uncle Sirius said he was going to drop in with Peter though, so maybe it's not all bad."
His heart hitched in his chest a moment, when Iana glanced up and met his eyes, but she looked away again a second later. "My mother, maybe?" she said uncertainly. "She left me with some kind of power which meant Voldemort couldn't harm me."
The room was by no means quiet, but there was no conversation to be heard. Most of the people, be they in beds or anywhere else, had the same lifeless expressions on their faces. The shadow of Dumbledore's death was a dark one.
"Do you need any help with anything?" she asked through the still locked door. "If you haven't packed, I can throw the stuff in your trunk for you?"
"There is much we do not know," said Dumbledore. "Voldemort is a master of magics I have no desire to ever learn, and long claimed he had delved further into the mysteries of the deep magic than any before him. All I know is that he made an attempt some time ago to gain possession of an artefact that might have had the power to return him to true life. He failed in that plot, but it cost me one of my oldest friends to deny him his return."
It didn't last long into Harry's more detailed explanation. He was careful to keep some of the details out, he was certainly never going to let her know about the prophecy, or the real danger of the Horcruxes, but what he did tell her was enough to thoroughly ruin her evening.
"Lucius Malfoy is dead," said James eventually.
"What do you mean you don't
The Grey Lady held up an imperious hand, neatly forestalling any other questions as she glanced up and down the otherwise deserted corridor. Apparently, it was not nearly deserted enough, as she floated off to the side, straight through a door. After a moment of indecision, Harry and Iana followed her.
"Try living with one."
"Ooh," said Harry, realising she was right. He frowned. "Not much more to tell, really. Voldemort made Horcruxes. One was a cup which supposedly belonged to Helga Hufflepuff. Your dad destroyed that one. Another was a book of some kind. Your dad also destroyed that. Then there was a locket which Dumbledore said was once Slytherin's. Also destroyed. Finally, there was a ring which had been in Voldemort's family for generations and which Dumbledore destroyed."
Harry stopped her by grabbing her hand. "I'd rather you stayed," he said, ignoring the many watching eyes. "If you want to go, I can't stop you. Well, I could" — he caught the look of challenge in her eye — "maybe. Anyway, what I mean is we did this together. If everything we've been through doesn't make us as good as family, I don't know what does."
The journey home was a really strange one. Once again, Effie was coming home too, apparently unable to pass up an opportunity to make Harry's life more awkward, but most of the rest of his friends had elected to stay.
"Mum, what's going on?" Effie asked, her voice quavering. "What do we do?"
"I beg your pardon?" she asked once her mouth started working again.
She shrugged. "I guess so. I'm here. Father isn't leaving the Manor. Even the Dark Lord isn't powerful enough to think he can breach our enchantments."
"That's it?" Harry pressed. Did they really not know that it had been Voldemort?
"I don't doubt it. Maybe I even would have," she said with a shudder.
For some reason that was far funnier than it had any right to be. Harry caught his sister's eye and they both descended into uncontrollable chuckles.
"I shall leave any necessary discipline to you, Headmaster," he said. He then turned and beat a hasty retreat around a dark corridor as sleepy-eyed paintings followed his departure.
"Now he's dead," Lily interjected, "but all his supporters are still around. And now they've got no-one to hold them back from supporting Voldemort like they did the first time around. They're in a better position now, politically, than they were last time."
"Mum," he said quietly, drawing her attention. "You go. I'll take her up to the bath."
"Apart from raising me on a lie?" she asked with a mirthless smile. "Oh, I don't know. How about trying to sacrifice me so he could save his own pathetic skin?"
"So, you two have a good Christmas?" Neville asked, as Harry and Effie bustled into the cabin he'd managed to lay claim to.
That prompted a worried frown. "When?"
"You still could have stopped her," Harry spat. He waved his arm around to take in all the witches and wizards gathered in the Entrance Hall. "How many of you are there? You should have gone out and stopped her!"
Now, though, safely ensconced within the warm confines of the Hogwarts Express, surrounded by mostly oblivious children, Harry could almost pretend that he didn't have a sword hanging over his head, dangling by the most tenuous of strings.
It was three weeks after the start of the new term, and Harry had spent all of his free time in the library. If he was being honest with himself, he wasn't really sure what he was hoping to achieve. It wasn't like he was going to be able to make any kind of meaningful inroads on the advantage Voldemort held over him by just reading books. If the rumours were true, Voldemort had spent decades exploring the world, and learning obscure magics, or even uncovering forgotten spells.
"Well, obviously."
Harry and Effie caught each other's eyes. By common agreement, Iana and the Potters had decided to say nothing at all about her visit over the break. Not only would it have painted a target on the Potters' collective backs, but it was obvious that the only way Iana was going to be able to avoid Voldemort was if he didn't know where to find her.
Despite nods from Ron and Dean, Neville didn't look convinced. "But what does it mean by 'her heart', then?
After a quick glance to make sure they weren't being watched, an unlikely occurrence in any event, Harry followed her. As soon as the door clicked shut, she shot a couple of spells at it. Harry recognised them as locking and silencing charms. He turned back to her, and gave her a look which he hoped would prompt some kind of explanation.
"How many years have you known her?" Neville asked as he shook his head. Harry made way, and they both entered the cabin. Neville continued, "Sometimes I think you might need glasses more than Harry does."
"Of course," said Iana, sounding insulted. "I'll get started on it right away."
She levitated the Diadem into the centre of the space.
"Well, what if the Dark Lord found it?" Iana asked. Her tone of voice didn't speak to much confidence in her theory, but Harry could easily understand her frustration.
Six years of putting up with Snape's barbs had taught Harry that it was best to simply try and ignore them. He might not have been especially good at following his own advice, but this time he managed to hold his tongue. He definitely didn't point out that it was Snape who was in fact late.
Nothing happened.
"I think we should aim to depart by around 9pm," said Dumbledore. "That way, if all goes as planned, we will have more than enough time to depart and return before curfew. It should also give you ample time to enjoy the evening."
"How long have you known about this?" he asked them, his voice rising along with his temper.
"Malfoy!"
"What if it's right under our nose," she said with a shrug. "The Diadem of Ravenclaw."
James shook his head gravely. "It was much more than that. When Voldemort fell, Malfoy scooped up a lot of his supporters. You can understand why, right? His daughter had apparently defeated the greatest dark wizard in living memory, and she did it while she was an infant. He was influential before that all happened. Afterwards, he had the political clout, and popular support, to trump even Dumbledore."
will work on him!"
"What do you know about what your dad was doing to fight Voldemort?" he asked.
"Are you indeed?" Rosier asked, as his wand, which Harry hadn't seen him pull, tapped his leg rhythmically. "It seems to me that you were having a bit of a tête-à-tête. What
The fire Crabbe unleashed was out of control - and Draco was somewhere in there. Pure terror came through the bond.
"He didn't want to go. I can't force him to. His condition has been stable. If it had gotten worse, you know I would have brought him back."
"It was nothing."
I sigh heavily. This bickering won't help Malfoy. I leave Parkinson and Ginny to their squabbling in favor of going to Malfoy’s side. I have a potion to give the blond ferret. It should help keep his heart from getting any worse.
George and Arthur are looking around in confusion, trying to talk to Ron. He has a vacant look on his face.
My eyes find Pansy's gaze. She knows she's won. I stumble to my feet and grab my wand, casting a quick
"I will once you've napped." I shrug, climbing back into bed.
"What are you doing? It's already healed."
"Feel better?" I ask, trying to disguise the amusement in my voice.
"That's true. There's only one memory left. I'm not going to make you watch every argument we had."
"Are you okay?"
We turn to look at the door. For a moment, there's nothing there. I start feeling apprehensive. What if it's my attacker?
"Wait," my voice is panicked, "what do you mean? I have to get out of here!"
Who you’ve only met again a few months ago, correct?
"This magic feels old," I murmur, testing it with my wand.

Draco fell asleep an hour ago. He never moved from my lap. His face is buried in my neck. His arms are draped over my shoulders. I really like it. This feels right.
"Are you okay, love?"
"That really is saying something." Hermione laughed. "We'll talk to him soon about it."
"I already do all that, Potter. My diet was approved by another healer, as was my exercise routine."
My head starts reeling as I take in what Goldstein is saying. Harry was already in a relationship when we kissed? When he asked me to be his boyfriend?
I wait for my father to leave before turning my gaze to Harry.
"I just put Lyra and Maia down for their nap," I say quietly as I step into Draco's study.
"Just write your own article for the paper first. That takes away Skeeter's shock value... and you guys get to control the information that public first sees." Elliot leans against the door. "Of course, she will still write her own version of events and some people will listen to that, but you'll get the first word in."
I should stop. I should definitely move away. The feeling of Draco's tongue slipping into my mouth quells those thoughts immediately. I brush my tongue against his and the noise that escapes him is enough to drive out all thoughts except one.
My stomach roils as Harry heaves an exasperated sigh and says, "will you stop nagging me if I say yes?"
"Are you sure you want to?" Draco frowns. "Luna did it last time… and she seemed to hate it. I can do this myself."
Draco's lips part under mine, a soft sound escaping him. I lift my hand to his neck to monitor his pulse, but he grabs it. He pulls me, leaning back on the window seat and tugs me on top of him.
Harry tried to look around for his clothes, but he couldn't see without his glasses. "I don't know."
"You're Harry Potter though… you survived the killing curse and defeated the Dark Lord. Even muggles should have been grateful considering he was targeting them too." I watch as a slightly older Harry runs by us, being chased by the heavy boy from before. "Not only that, but aren't they your family?"
Malfoy looks weaker than I've ever seen him. He's so pale it scares me. Blood is trickling out of the corner of his mouth. It seems like he's barely hanging onto consciousness.
"Fuck," I mutter, getting a bad feeling.
Blaise fakes a look of betrayal. "I'll just go then."
"None of these memories are cursed." I brush the tears off his cheeks. "Let's move on."
"We're going to see an old friend of mine," I answer shortly.
"Draco," Malfoy said firmly.
Goldstein scrambles to his feet. Harry grabs him by the arm and drags him out of the room, shutting the door behind him.
I tilt my head curiously as he cuts himself off. A crimson blush spreads across his tan skin.
Even though he says it with a sneer, he sounds like a scared kid. Still, the other Death Eaters laugh and shout in agreement. Voldemort gives an appreciative smile.
I follow the instruction quickly. I want to get back to Draco soon and clear this all up. He must be confused. The parchment shimmers green.
He let go of Harry's hips to brace himself on the bed.
Draco's head falls to my shoulder again. "Don't just say things like that. It makes me want to kiss you again."
"Don't talk ab-" Harry cut himself off. "I don't think... isn't he dating Parkinson?"
It took three months appealing to the ministry for them to let Malfoy out. He was released into Luna's care and under house arrest for six months. I didn't see her much after that. I've only seen Malfoy from a distance.
"I haven't had turtle soup in awhile. Harry, have you tried it? It's so delicious." Anthony grins as he sits at the table.
"I demand a new healer. I would like someone competent."
"Dumbledore trusts Snape though. He must have a good reason for that." Hermione folded her arms.
I hold back a sigh of frustration. This is something that needs Draco's full consent. If he isn't completely willing to do this, it might cause more harm. I can understand why he's scared of me seeing his memories.
I push the curry away, feeling a bit nauseous. I never thought I would be talking about my sex life with her.
"For a moment, I forgot how messy sex is," I mutter, slipping off Draco's lap to sit next to him.
"Draco…"
"Do you mind cleaning the kitchen and cooking dinner?" I ask, kneeling so we are eye level. Kreacher nods his head. "Thank you. Please, ask Anthony what he wants to eat."
“I was so worried for him, it just didn’t seem like Harry to shut me out like this. Since he wouldn’t answer my messages, I saw no other way but to surprise him at his job. Imagine my surprise when I found him in Mr Malfoy’s room, the two of them all curled up together in bed - not even two weeks after he had ended things with me.”
"What happened? Did Goldstein do anything to you?" I demand.
"Have you changed your mind about the mind walking?" she asks after a long moment of silence, putting her wand away finally.
and a muggle knife to just cut it off. I passed out from blood loss before I got halfway through. The mark goes deeper than the skin. No matter how deep I cut, it was still there."
"You're exhausted. Draco, we don't have to keep going. We can rest and come back."
Hermione and Ron look startled when I come out of their fireplace. I don't blame them. I didn't give them any warning.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Get Hermione!" I snap at Lucius.
"Why the hell would I need a guard? I didn't do anything wrong!" I can't believe this. I clench my hands.
Apple pie and broom polish.
"That doesn't count for much, Potter." Parkinson sneers. "It's not like you were the brightest in our year."
Alecto and Amycus Carrow are walking towards them with a half dozen second and third years following. Draco's lips thin to a white line, but the seventh year girl beside him just looks politely puzzled.
Amycus leads the way to the dungeons. We have to follow. Draco looks like he would rather be walking off a cliff instead of trailing after them.
Potter draws my attention back to him by handing me a vial. "You need to drink this."
Narcissa knew about the bond. She knew Harry and Draco were mates. She probably knew they loved each other.
"Are you certain you aren't just offering yourself to me to get into my good graces?" The Dark Lord stops in front of me. "What if I give you the most arduous task?"
I let myself into Malfoy's room. He's sitting with his back to George, arms folded. George is grinning. He sees me and winks.
"Malfoy?"
"Oh," he breathes, "Harry is filing DAISIES against Anthony."
I should have known she would ask before we were even in the water. To be honest, I'm a bit eager to get this all off my chest where my mother can't hear me. She knows I'm gay, but she doesn't know anything about how attracted I am to Potter.
He's surrounded by materials for wand working, his long hair pulled back from his face. Glancing up from the birch wood he's working with, he flicks his own wand at the door to shut it and casts a
Anthony is the only one who has actually wanted to be with me since the war... at least, for an extended length of time. The press and publicity drive most of my love interests off... and it's been lonely without someone to come home to. I don't want to jeopardize that.
Her face softens. "What happened, sir?"
"Cissa-"
My blood turns to ice. My first instinct is to run to my boyfriend's room and make sure he isn't there. That he isn't hiding or something. It's entirely irrational, so I force myself to take a breath. Being impulsive will not help Draco.
"I thought I answered this last night," Harry mutters as the blush on his cheeks deepens.
"What is this about?" Kingsley asks me as I take a seat as well.
"Draco… please… I can't take much more of this," he begged, rocking onto his fingers desperately.
I look up at Draco. He's gone white as a sheet.
"It's barely functioning. Magic and potions are keeping you alive. Another attack could be fatal." He hesitates. "There's more."
I'm fairly certain I've never seen my father this speechless before. The way his eyes keep flicking between Harry and me is freaking me out.
If you liked this story,  feel free to leave a comment. I love it when people say hi. ♡♡♡
My heart skips a beat. This seems to be happening too quickly… but I do understand that only magic and potions are keeping me alive right now.
"Alright. Let us know if you see him," I say, raking my fingers through my hair.
Draco's eyes flash at the suggestion. The idea of me fingering myself clearly turns him on. I don't wait for him to confirm it. I turn around, kneeling and spreading my cheeks.
"No. I thought it was just a weird dream until I talked to Luna."
I elbow Blaise hard in the ribs and he breaks the kiss to clutch at his side.
"It's a skill that I learned specifically to get out of these tasks."
"You'll be able to go home tonight. I'm escorting you when my shift ends."
" Draco hisses, lips drawn into a thin white line.
"Are you okay, Draco?" Harry asks, looking concerned.
"I think so. I don't even remember this part… just what comes next. She was gone for weeks. Then, she came back in the middle of the night."
A startled laugh escapes my lips. He's probably not wrong. Pansy has been coming over daily with wedding plans.
"I am fairly certain you're going to be attacked with grooming spells and potions." I grin. "My father is very conscientious about appearances and your hair offends him."
"Draco, is there some reason you are proving yourself to be useless?"
It takes a long time for my father to speak. So long, I have to force myself to stay still. I glance at the door, wishing for Harry's warmth.
I take another pillow from behind me and hit him over the head with it.
"Uh..." I'm not sure if that's a compliment. "Compared to what?"
Do I really believe that Harry will love me less if he sees these memories? I force down the instant affirmative my mind supplies and really think about it.
Harry raised a skeptical eyebrow, but Draco was already moving down his body again.
I sit down next to him and kiss his shoulder. "You are beautiful."
"I literally just married Luna! Harry, doesn't Anthony seem..." she trails off.
"So... you know about the whole... uh... consummating the bond thing?"
It feels like ice is freezing my veins. Harry pulls me into his chest, but I can hardly feel him. My memory self looks just as horrified as I feel now.
"Ron, I wanted to. He's… well, he's important to me. You didn't see how he was earlier. He took care of me." Harry flushed.
"Draco… please," Harry panted when Draco's lips ghosted over his cock.
"Mm," Luna hums, getting into our first yoga position.
My throat feels scratchy and my face is hot. Tears are blurring my vision. I quickly wipe the tears away. I feel Ron's hand squeeze my leg.
"Elliot..." Harry says, grimacing.
He slowly blinks, his eyes meeting mine. "That... that was really different."
Thinking of last night reminds me of how brilliant Harry felt as he rode my cock. I have never felt so connected to another person before. I don't just mean in a sexual way. The way Harry trusted me after everything Anthony did to him… it's the first time I've truly felt like we
There are no signs of a struggle. Draco's wand is gone. So is the journal. It's looking more and more like Draco left of his own volition. I just don't know why he would leave.
Draco hissed, his fingers tugging on his hair. "Good... now, push your magic into me."
I take a deep breath.
The shuddering breath he released as he realised what he'd have to do sounded so loud that he was momentarily worried the Death Eaters might hear him. When it was clear they hadn't, he slipped his wand into his hand and took careful aim. It was harder than it might have been. The mere thought of what he was about to do had him trembling, and he couldn't keep the wand straight.
Despite the Headmaster's suggestion, Harry did not tell his friends anything. He most certainly did not tell Iana anything about the Prophecy. Dumbledore's likely reasoning was sound. If Voldemort did return, Iana probably had every reason to want to see him dead again; more so even than anyone else Harry knew. He still wasn't about to interact with her any more than was absolutely necessary though.
"What about you, Neville?" Effie asked, turning to look at him with a forced smile. "You doing anything fun?"
In a pool of light beneath one of the floating blue lamps which provided a sparse illumination for the hall, Harry found the source of the voices.
"I think she got hit in the head by something," said Harry, only then realising he hadn't thought to look in on her. "I think she'll be fine."
Voldemort laughed at him. It was a high, cruel sound that had very little in common with the laughter that Harry knew.
Explosions and noise filled the air around him as he fought to regain his feet, pulling Iana up by her arm. Blood was running down the side of her face, soaking deeply into her hair, and her eyes were unfocused. A moment later, Effie was thrust into his arms too, and Harry realised that his mother was already locked into a duel with the other occupant of the room.
"A week from now," said Dumbledore. "The Ministry will be holding a Gala to celebrate All Hallows' Eve, and I have managed to engineer it such that all of those who remain on duty will be more welcoming than they might otherwise be."
"What's wrong?" Harry asked as soon as he was sure the corridor was clear. It seemed everyone else was manning the defences or dealing with the rebellious Slytherins. "What did Snape say?"
Snape bristled, and despite everything, Harry couldn't help but appreciate watching one of the schools most hated professors being taken down a peg or three. Dumbledore returned his attention to Harry, and the air of poorly contained menace evaporated instantly.
It took Sirius a moment, but he let out a bark-like laugh. "Good one."
But it was too late, with a vicious kick to his shin, Iana jumped past him and back out into the open Hall. Before Harry was able to limp after her, she was gone in the direction of the Slytherin common room.
to make an effort to be hot."
"Mother," said Iana, meeting his eyes. "She was as beautiful as I'd ever imagined. Father got rid of most of the pictures we had of her, you see. All I had to remember her by was a copy of one of their wedding photos which Dobby had managed to salvage before Father threw it all out. She was in the dress she wore in the picture, and she said she was proud of me."
Before Iana Malfoy, no-one had survived Voldemort deciding to kill them. His parents didn't talk about that time much, but he'd have to be blind to fail to see how much it had clearly influenced them. Was that all going to start again? Was
If you've given this story a look in and decided you don't like it, but are continuing to read it? Why? You don't owe me anything, go find something more enjoyable to read! But still, thank you for giving it a go. That's all a writer can ever ask.
Her eyes narrowed dangerously. "If this is you—"
'He'd ask his parents'? Really? He and Iana might be allies in the fight for their lives against Voldemort, but that did
Ron shrugged. "Who's Granger going to tell?"
"And yet, you will," said Dumbledore, his intense blue eyes focused on Harry once more. "Why else have you been pushing your friends away, and spending every waking hour studying?"
"By the time we realised, the Dark Lord was already there. We tried to fight back, but he's—" she paused, considering her words "— it's like I was back to my first day holding a wand, and trying to fight an Auror or something. He didn't even need to try. He just found it funny, I think.
"What's going on here, then?" came a voice.
"I don't know," Iana admitted. "It seems like it would be a stupid thing to do. The Grey— Helena could tell anyone else where it had been hidden and it would be in danger."
"They are," she said with grim certainty. "There's much more to the Dark Lord's hatred of me than you know."
Harry had no idea how to respond to that. Lucius Malfoy had been a bigot of the first order, and was responsible for the law which had seen Remus chased out the previous summer. It was strange to see Iana so resentful, though.
As if she'd been heard, McGonagall's voice echoed through the corridors. "Every student is to return to their dormitories immediately," the voice said in familiar, clipped tones. "Any student found in the corridors will receive a month of detention."
"I hate you all," he said, utterly without fire. "You ruined the joke."
In fact, things were very nearly normal. Perhaps the greatest change from what Harry was used to was that Malfoy had taken a step back for whatever reason.
Seamus' eyes lingered on Effie for just long enough for Harry to understand his meaning. "Uh, couldn't they just bring it up for us?"
He was only five minutes into what looked like it could be a very late night indeed when there was a somewhat tentative knock at the door.
"What's
"Thanks guys."
"When I told him to depart, to return to my mother's coat-tails, he snapped, and he stabbed me in the heart."
Harry spun around to find Iana loitering in the doorway, looking torn. She clearly didn't want to be there, and yet when he met her eyes, there was a look of such loneliness and despair that it hit him almost like a physical thing.
"Here, Harry! You done for the night at last?" Seamus called as Harry entered the Gryffindor common room. The Easter holidays still weren't over, so it was maybe a little quieter than usual, which meant that Seamus, Ron, and Neville had managed to grab all of the most comfortable seats by the fireplace.
She deserved to know, Harry knew. At the same time though, she didn't deserve the burden. If Voldemort really did come back, then it wouldn't be long before everyone knew. Wouldn't it be better if she just carried on unawares?
That didn't make much sense to Harry, but he didn't say anything. If his mum and dad had wanted to run away, why would they think Harry
"Not really," said Harry. The words came out as something more like a croak.
"Ooh no," said Iana with absolute certainty. "I thought so too at first, but Snape" — she spat the name with enough ire that it might have come from Sirius himself — "made sure to clarify it for me."
Deciding he'd pushed his luck far enough, Harry relented. "Well, okay. Dumbledore reckons Voldemort wanted six Horcruxes. For seven soul fragments."
"Did you not listen to me, child?" Helena snapped. "I never spoke with the boy again after that, and since he left Hogwarts, I have seen him but once; when he applied to become an instructor. He even smiled at me then. Though by that point they had become cruel things, nothing like the smiles he had plied his followers with when he was a child."
Iana glowered. "He's not hiding! The Dark Lord has agents everywhere. I guess I can't expect someone like
"It is a heavy burden I must place upon your shoulders," said Dumbledore as he looked over his half moon spectacles with a sad expression. "Yet, it seems I have no choice in the matter. I have never been one to set much faith in Prophecy, preferring instead to have faith in people above all else, but even I cannot overlook it in this case. When the prophecy was first uttered, I had hoped to keep it secret, and had I been successful in doing so, perhaps you would not now be facing the task which is before you.
"Shit, shit, shit!" As he swore and paced, he tried to think of what to do next. Dumbledore had told him to stay away, but Dumbledore had also thought he had reinforcements coming. It was becoming increasingly clear that there would be no reinforcements. Harry was all there was.
threaten you."
"Mate, I swear, if you're about to rate your own sister…"
"Just a bit of Fiendfyre," said Harry with a shrug. "And I have no fucking clue. We didn't really work out what the bloody prophecies were meant to mean."
"Wonderful!" Dumbledore clapped his hands together cheerfully. "Then I think it is time you returned to your dorms. You need not worry about Professor Rosier. It seems he has returned to his rooms for the evening." Quite how he knew Rosier's precise whereabouts, Harry did not know. Perhaps it had something to do with one of the spindly silver instruments.
"Sorry. I got soot everywhere," I mutter, fixing my glasses.
"What about my father?" My voice cracks.
What did you think when you saw the article?
"Oh, I am. It just makes me want to go another round."
I realize I'm shaking with rage. I can't find my voice. No one has ever called any of my past lovers a faggot before and it's honestly pissing me off. Clenching my hands into fists, I vow this is the last time I let something like this happen.
to find another way!"
I frown at him apprehensively. "About what?"
Harry smiles down at me and leans in. He pecks my nose just as the door opens.
"Try it, I'm sure you'll like it. Turtles aren't that cute anyways."
Harry rolls his eyes, looking both fond and exasperated. "I'm entirely sure about that. Are you ready to see the rest of my memories?"
"Do you think we can break through it?"
"I didn't think," he starts to say.
"I can't help it. When you wear button up shirts and roll the sleeves to your elbows, you look sexy as hell." Draco vanishes the materials from his desk and sits on it with an inviting wink.
. I turn to Malfoy, still grinning with amusement.
He's looking at me warily now. I turn my attention to Arthur.
"Why haven't I heard of this before?" I narrow my eyes suspiciously.
"I love you," I rasp, setting a slow pace as I fuck myself on his cock.
The memory seems to speed backward as if the world is rewinding - like on a muggle videotape. It leaves me feeling a little sick.
"Anthony is the only person who wasn't scared off. Harry was lonely and he thought no one else would stick around. I bet Anthony made sure to drag his self esteem through the mud too. If he kept Harry beaten down, Harry wouldn't want to leave." I'm quoting Hermione, but she's usually right about these things.
"My heart is in my throat," I mumble, "I hope you can still find it."
"Luna walked in on Harry and I earlier," I start.
Bill follows me and sits on the bed. "I understand that you have your own version of what happened that night, but I don't blame you."
Thank magic my shift is over. Malfoy wasn't any trouble after his panic attack earlier, but there were a lot of other patients I had to attend to. Unfortunately, once most patients find out I'm their healer, they tend to call for me often. Some actually need me, but a few just want stare at me or shake my hand.
I waste no time following him. He will not do this without me!
"Death can't stop true love, Draco. All it can do is delay it for a little while." He kissed the top of Draco's head. "I'll always come back to you."
"Like you could use me," Ginny scoffs.
Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, thank you so much for your time and your honesty. It was a pleasure talking to you and this reporter, for one, wishes you all the best.
I'm about to tell him we have time - my mouth is already watering with thought of sucking him off - when a soft knock interrupts me.
If you liked this chapter, please consider leaving a comment. I love it when people say hi. ♡♡♡
I look at the vial curiously, distantly recognizing it, but Luna kisses my cheek and then Draco's. My glasses are pulled off my face. I try to wave to her, but sleep is already tugging at my mind again. Resting my head on Draco's shoulder, my eyes close as I listen to the uneven beating of my love's heart.
Rolling my eyes, fondness fills me. We picked up the habit of calling dibs from Luna and Ginny whose son is a year older than Lyra and Maia. I don't mind it. I'll gladly deal with the gross stuff of parenthood because if Draco is forced to, he'll throw up and I'll have to clean two messes.
My mother has loved Luna since my trial. When I came home from Azkaban, Luna helped nurse me to health. I was malnourished and my heart condition had gone untreated for too long. I was dead on my feet.
I wait until Harry's next shift starts. My father and Arthur are in my room. It's the middle of the night. Harry has already checked on me.
When I rush into Malfoy's room, he's sitting propped up in Blaise Zabini's arms.
Ordering the kids inside, Amycus waves his wand and the chains wrap around their little hands. The kids are being unusually quiet and complacent. I realize why a moment later when the Slytherin turns her head.
George, looking a bit dazed, raises an eyebrow. "Is that what was happening?"
"Okay…" I say slowly, watching Harry's cheeks darken. "Regardless, you don't have to fight for anything regarding me. Certainly not with my father."
is the one who mentions you, not Anthony.  Who knows to what degree she made up these quotes. This is Skeeter - remember what she made out of your gibberish without you even saying anything? Imagine what she can do with some vague comments from the guy.”
Draco combed his fingers through Harry's messy hair, letting his fingers trail down to the bite on his neck. Harry was overcome with an emotion he couldn't identify. It was almost like grief, but not. It hurt in the same way.
"Draco," I try saying, but he's dragging me into another kiss.
I wanted to kiss him more than anything in that moment. I wanted to see if his lips were as soft as his cheek. I wanted to pull him against me as I tasted his mouth.
The girl sniffles, wiping her eyes with the back of her hand. "Who are you?"
I fight the urge to back away. A hive is right behind me. I don't want to disturb them more. Potter furrows his eyebrows in concentration as his fingers brush my cheek. My heart stutters before kicking up its pace.
"It's just… did you have a strange dream before we kissed? In Puerto Rico?" I ask, mouth dry. I know the answer but now I need to hear him say it.
"Where's my father?"
"Yeah… we have the largest collection of books dealing with dark magic in Europe."
"Of course it's not. I've fancied you since fourth year."
If I'm honest with myself, I know that those things aren't really any better than the memories I'm so scared of. At least, they're not from Harry's perspective. He's already seen me being pathetic and cruel.
"Fuck, Harry… harder. Fuck me harder," Draco gasps, his hand flying over his cock.
"Barely. You signed up before you could buy liquor. You never killed anyone or committed a crime willingly. You had to be threatened by Voldemort first." Harry snorted. "You betrayed him twice for me. Besides, the war is over."
To his surprise, Malfoy didn't kiss him. He slid his hands down Harry's chest and around his waist. He pressed his face into Harry's neck instead. Harry shivered, feeling his hot breath against his skin.
"I turned off as many emotions as I could. I cut off the world around me. Luna called it a dissonance. My mind couldn't cope with the reality around me, so it fucked off and made its own." Draco takes a shuddering breath. "It was a cowardly thing, but I didn't know what else I could do."
"There's really not. I can't get into your dorm or in there when you are inside." He gestured to where the door had been.
I ignore Harry's worried expression and take a breath. I can do this. I just need to think about what other memories could be cursed. I know now that all of the cursed memories had to take place within a week. That's what my aunt had said, after all.
Granger narrows her eyes at him until he offers a hasty apology. This isn't doing much to boost my confidence.
"Why?" Harry asks, sounding urgent.
The first time he did it, I nearly melted. It was such a timid action, as if Draco expected me to reject the touch. Of course I didn't.
"Yours," Harry answered.
"You're right… Dumbledore manipulated me a lot. He did everything to keep me alive and safe until I was supposed to die." He pulls a face, grimacing at the old man.
Turning toward the sound, Harry saw his mate. The air around him was shimmering, making him look blurred.
"Oh no… Harry, you didn't…" Ron groaned.
We started yoga after. Luna read about meditation and yoga helping with... well, she calls it post traumatic stress disorder. She says she thinks I have that from the war and Dark Lord.
We reach the front doors to the hospital. I pull Anthony outside and disapparate.
The bond was gone.
I am glad I turned away from him. I start packing dried herbs. "The war. You took my wand... and it worked for you. Then, you told the Dark Lord about allegiances changing with wands. I was curious. Ollivander wanted an apprentice. It fit."
"Ronald Weasley," she says threateningly when neither of us answer. "I don't care about your schoolboy grudge. Draco shouldn't be dueling right now."
Hermione shakes her head. "No, don't worry about that. Elliot is a fair person. He wouldn't fire Harry over something like this."
Harry hesitated. He could tell the question was important to Draco. The fog clouding his mind retreated.
It takes me a moment to notice the sound of skin sliding over skin. Glancing behind me, I see Draco stroking his hard dick. His eyes are glued to my fingers. A rush of desire thrums through my body as I add a third finger.
We're still in the manor when the memory forms around us. It must be a dining hall, but I don't remember ever seeing this room. It's huge.
She looks over my shoulder and whispers, "who is that, sir?"
"If my fated mate and I got along. If we both wanted it. If it was for love," Harry whispered, leaning forward slightly.
"Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Ginny Weasley-Lovegood have all witnessed his abusive behavior. I'm also willing to give you my memories or take veritaserum."
"He should be here any minute. Also, you're going to have a difficult time with George. He was acting as guard while you were sleeping." Hermione grins. "He was laughing in the hall for a good ten minutes."
"I can't be sure," Draco finally answered. "What happened to his face?"
"We'll all be there with you through this," Luna adds. "You won't be alone. Our magic will serve as a beacon if you get lost in the dark."
"Is there something you needed?" Hermione asks, looking faintly amused.
"What do you mean? I'm fairly certain Malfoy is a human."
I glance at Potter. He has that look on his face again, like me beekeeping has shaken his world view. I roll my eyes. "Very observant."
"Gods, this is going to be awful," I mutter before ripping the letter open.
"I have a couple ideas." I grin. Exasperated is an improvement from hopeless in my book.
I've never kissed anyone before. I was always only interested in Potter. Pansy and Blaise tried to drunk kiss me once. At the same time. They bonked heads like idiots. I still like to tease them with that one.
"Thanks." I smile in relief. It's nice to have help.
"Where are we going?" Potter asks, following me.
"Harry, no!" Ron leapt to his feet and grabbed Harry's shoulders. "This is the bite thing talking! You can't get married to him at sixteen!"
That sounds like Pansy.
"Fuck," she hisses, stepping into the room. "Let me guess, they're all muggleborns who weren't aware of the danger?"
I keep my face carefully blank. "I am with
I spin on my heel and move to Malfoy's side. He's white as a sheet, lying in Luna's arms. His hand is still clutching at his chest.
Pansy had nearly fainted when she came over after Ginny and Luna painted them, but she got over the chaotic walls fast. It was amusing to watch Pansy demand a simplistic furniture design now that the walls were 'screaming' at her.
"People change, sir."
"Well, it's no worse than what they were saying when I was released from Azkaban," he says tensely. "Actually, no, it's a little worse. Before they weren't speculating how I tricked you into loving me… or accusing me of using Ginny's friendship."
Harry had to die.
"I'm authorizing DAISIES. I'll look at the memories as a formality, but Goldstein has clearly admitted to the crime. Do you want the memories back after I have viewed them?"
His heart hammered as he tried to escape Malfoy's hold feebly. Malfoy should have been weak. He should have been able to escape easily... but Malfoy was unmovable right then.
idea for a Valentine’s surprise,” he clarified with a sneer and heavy sarcasm in his voice. “Before all that, I was avoiding you so you wouldn’t catch my scent and think you have to be with me out of some weird hero complex or obligation. But then McGonagall had to go and ruin it all. I only came because I could smell your distress as you left class. Pan kind of kicked me into gear too."
Harry Potter just said he likes me. Well... at least a bit. Fuck. I think I might actually swoon.
Draco's emotions still came clearly through their bond, despite being far apart. The terror when Voldemort was angry, the rising panic when he searched the Hogwarts Express for Harry, the frustration when no one would tell him where Harry was… Harry sensed it
Hermione smacks Ron's arm and glares at him. "Ronald!"
I'm still pulling him along. He's very reluctant to follow me going by the way he's dragging his feet.
"I don't know! Maybe a thank you for saving his arse again?!" I run my fingers through my hair irritably before taking off my lime green healer robes.
In some ways, yes. Which is why Minister Shaklebolt allowed me to get DAISIES right away after I showed him some of my memories. I didn’t just get a restraining order against my ex because of my word or my name. I had proof.
Potter looks apprehensive, but I find it amusing. If he wasn't paying attention to Minty and I talking about bees, that's his problem.
Let’s just say… we have a lot of friends who make sure none of that will ever truly bother us.
I want to get to know Malfoy better. I want to see if there is a possibility of us being a thing. I want to know him, but I also want to be broken up with Anthony first. I don't want Anthony to get in the way of anything that might happen between Malfoy and me.
The instinct to recoil and hide myself in the bathroom is almost unbearable. I think he can tell, because he presses my face back into his neck.
Luna's arms tighten as she kisses my temple.
Harry didn't know any healing spells. All he knew was a bit of muggle first aid from all the times he had had to see the nurse when Dudley had beaten him up.
"Sh... hang on."
"This… Harry, how long did they abuse you for?" I ask, my heart sinking.
," I demand in Parseltongue, surprising myself. I haven't spoken in Parseltongue since the war. I didn't know I could still do it.
"Um…" I think back to when I woke up. "I think he had fallen asleep in the chair next to my bed. He certainly looked like he had been sleeping… wait. Luna, there's no way. It's not possible."
"Tired... my heart felt heavy during the spell." I lay my head on the arm of the chair, ignoring the water.
"You mean like Voldemort using my blood in the graveyard? He said something about my mother's protection was flowing in his veins after that."
It takes me a moment to understand what Harry means. When I do, my whole body tenses with anger.
"Hermione is persuasive. Also, apart from Ron and George, there was no convincing needed." Harry shrugs as his friend throws a pumpkin pasty at him.
I move to the pensieve and put my memories one by one into a vial until it's empty. When I turn back, Draco is clutching the goblet. He looks up at me, fidgets with the goblet, and then pours the golden potion into his mouth.
. Ginny, I need help finding him."
"That's good. Do you mind if I do a quick check up?"
Anthony looks a little vexed, but he smiles and pulls me into his house. As soon as the door closes behind me, Anthony presses his lips to mine.
I take a minute to calm myself. My face feels hot. When I am ready, I face Potter. I close the suitcase and hand it to him. He accepts it, his emerald eyes boring into my face.
"I'm going home. Send me a message if you feel like being reasonable," Harry finally manages. "Or don't."
"This is a new pose I found. I think the muggles call it bound side raven?"
"Wait, wait, wait," Ron said, holding up his hand. "How is Harry supposed to... do that... if he doesn't have special veela spit?"
She hums discontentedly, but vanishes the tray and dishes.
"No!" I feel the blood rush to my face. "We were just kissing… a lot. He might have been on top of me."
"That's what happens when you are constantly wanking to porn and fantasies of the Chosen One," Draco said dryly. "Don't forget, Blaise Zabini, the hussy of our school, is my best friend. He is very open about his… exploits."
She's always been brave, even in creepy places like this. We walk to the gate together and run into a barrier. The barrier is solid.
I walk to Malfoy's bed. He's sleeping in the fetal position. My wand is in his hand. I gently slip it out of his limp hold and start running through the diagnostic spells as Hermione catches me up on the night shift's patients in a low whisper.
I know what I need to do. I have to go back to where this all started.
"I'll be right back." I kiss the top of his head.
"Of course I am." He rolls his eyes, but I can tell he's pleased.
Hermione shoots me a withering look. "Yes, worse than Malfoy! At least Malfoy isn't abusing you or Kreacher. I don't think he would want to either! I would like it infinitely more if you were dating him!"
his mate to be, sure. But… he had never fully sensed it from said alpha. Maybe it was because they were all on suppressants… or maybe it was because ever since the summer, Draco took care to never be around Harry… ever since they had presented…
"Your heart is enlarged. I think it was the stress from seeing the snake, but it could have been an issue for awhile. You haven't been in for a check up for quite awhile. Not since the hospitalization last year." Potter pauses. His emerald eyes flick to my chest. "This potion should prevent it from getting worse."
"I'm a veela. I know, Harry. My grandmother was a veela... and you... are my mate." Draco's eyes lit up, shining silver. "Does that bother you?"
"Only if by soap you mean come."
"It's really good to see you awake. How are you feeling?" Hermione walks closer to where Pansy and I are sitting on the couch.
The last thing I see before losing consciousness is a bright light.
"Can you two give us some privacy? I would rather not have an audience for this," I say, palming the vial of my memories.
Narcissa's clear green eyes meet mine, searching. After a moment, she nods and pulls out her wand. Tapping the wood on my hand, she murmurs a spell. A glowing N appears above my knuckles.
Harry sensed someone kneel beside him. They turned him over. A hand touched his chest. A finger lifted his eyelid.
"That's only five flowers?"
"I want to." Draco's ears turn pink. "I mean, if you do, I want to do it."
"He's acting as an escort right now, Minty. I'm just here to collect work materials and check on you and the hives. Mother wants me to stay with her for a little while." I let Minty go.
Slowly, I press a finger inside, moaning softly. I take my time stretching myself, imagining Draco is the one doing it. His fingers are more elegant than mine, long and thin. I wonder what it would be like. Probably slow and gentle.
"Yes... her wand revealed that she conjured the snake." Granger shifts uncomfortably. "She has all the signs of having been under the Imperius curse."
"Draco," I sob, pleasure building in my body. "Fuck. I need to-"
"No, but the invisibility cloak is gone."
I find myself telling her everything. I tell her about Malfoy being nice to Molly, about when he made me take a nap, about him blushing when I told him I'm bisexual, and about Minty. Hermione listens quietly as I tell her everything.
I'm a bit surprised Draco found the song familiar. I can't really picture him listening to muggle music.
I turn my head so I don't have to watch this again. My arm is burning as if in remembered pain. I look down at it reflexively.
He was able to handle wearing the horcrux longer when he could feel his mate's steady presence.
All that's left is the mark, vivid and sharp lines contrasting against my pale skin and I feel as if I can’t breathe, fear gripping me tight.
Blaise kisses me. I'm not sure if it's a good kiss. I know Blaise has a lot of experience in this area, but it just feels wet and warm to me.
"Are you too sensitive?" I ask, stilling immediately.
"Well, we still need to try." Ginny squares her shoulders.
"I swear, if you did something negligent and he gets hurt, I will hex you straight to the Asphodel Meadows, Harry! I will curse you so hard, you won't even be able to-"
"He took care of you?" Ron turned faintly green. "I don't want to hear about that."
"But we're still kids!"
"I swear to all the gods... if this is a trap, I'm going to kill you," Ginny's voice comes through the dark.
I do. I'm rarely in public. I usually stay in France and work. My home is well protected. It would be difficult to find me. Actually, besides my mother, Pansy, Luna, Ginny, and Blaise, no one knows where I live. When I have to go anywhere, I travel by apparation or the floo network.
Harry opened his eyes just a bit as he felt Hagrid stop walking. They were in front of the castle. Hogwarts looked like it was about to collapse in on itself. Through his lashes, Harry could see blood on the cobblestone.
Malfoy met Harry's eyes. He hadn't looked at Snape yet. Harry could see Malfoy was thinking fast. Then, his jaw set.
"Yeah. Ever since I was a kid, I've wished to have a family. The Weasleys are like my adopted family now and I love them for that, but back then, I didn’t know them that way just yet. I wanted my parents. I still miss them and as much as I love the Weasleys, I have always wanted a family of my own." Harry sighs. "I guess that is the biggest reason why I allowed Anthony to abuse me. I was getting desperate."
Little Harry runs back into the house, looking excited about his flower. I have the sudden sense that something bad is going to happen, which is ridiculous. These are supposed to be Harry's bad memories, so of course something bad will happen.
"What did you do?"
I gasp for breath and stare around the spare bedroom in Pansy's flat, trying to get my bearings. I barely hear her. She seems to realize that I'm not listening. She takes the bottle back and presses it to my mouth instead.
"Draco was completely safe! He's a-"
"You are seriously bisexual?" he asks slowly.
"Did you catch him?" I ask, trying to keep my voice steady.
"Harry!" Ron's voice was urgent. "We don't have time for this right now!"
six kids. You tortured students to keep them from a worse fate. I can't even imagine what that felt like, but you still kept them alive."
I know that this is probably important. I'm overhearing something I should be paying attention to. I just can't bring myself to care right now. I feel exhausted.
The bottom drops out of my stomach. I don't want to do this. I know I have to, but it's terrifying.
He didn't want to stop himself either. He felt a strange urge to be closer to him. Like everything would be alright so long as Draco was touching him and kissing him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"After we were attacked, I had this strange dream. I was at that beach in Puerto Rico. The one with the glowing eggs. Harry was there. He asked me about our wands." I bite my lip, letting myself fall back into the memory of the vivid dream. "I told him about
"Anthony and I were in relationship up until a couple weeks ago. I left him because my family had an intervention with me. They showed me something that was blindingly obvious to them. Anthony has been abusing me." I take a breath.
"Not too often… but when he has nightmares or panic attacks, he tends to avoid eating in case he can't keep it down." Sighing, she links her arm through mine. "Ginny developed a way to get him to eat though. She keeps him engrossed in conversation and hands him bite sized foods like grapes or crackers. He eats whatever she puts in his hands subconsciously."
Kingsley flicks his wand and Anthony is cut off. His mouth opens and closes furiously, but he can't make a sound.
I'm not the only one who notices. Molly rushes to him and cups his face in her hands. "Harry! Did you sleep at all? Did you have another row?"
Hermione takes out her wand and starts murmuring spells. I recognize the diagnostic magic and bury my face into Harry's chest.
To my surprise, Anthony starts laughing. "Oh, love, I haven't abused you. You're just imagining things. I think you're so used to people fighting with you, that you need to see it in me."
"If I can make a suggestion?" A voice says, sounding faintly amused.
The woman takes my face in her hands. She tilts my face up. It's Molly Weasley of all people. Of course it is. Granger told me she would be coming. I feel my cheeks heat and I look down so I can avoid her knowing gaze.
"Honestly, Harry, even you can’t be
It takes a few moments, but eventually I have the room cleared. Even Narcissa left with Luna. I think they're getting tea to calm their nerves.
"What?"
We land in the kitchen of our home. I sigh and sink into a chair. I've never told Anthony where I live, just in case the Order ever needs it again. It's still charmed to be a secret, but we cast a new fidelius charm. Now, Hermione is the secret keeper.
Looking wildly between the girl and Amycus, Draco stumbles a few more steps back. Tripping, he tries scrambling away.
"Easier said than done," he mumbles. "The past doesn't want to let go of me. I can't just... forget it happened."
I swear, they really are too sweet. It's lovely to watch, but it also feels like I'm intruding on something private. I glance at Draco, but his eyes are fixed on the pensieve.
Pan, who had come out as trans and decided to name himself after the Greek god of the wild, was entirely unhelpful when Harry had asked him for advice. He had hit Harry with a pillow and told him to talk to Draco himself (not that Harry had mentioned to him that he was even talking about that
"Alright. Did you eat?" He sits down and takes the only plate left.
"I don't think that's possible. Snape is spying on me. The Dark Lord will know immediately if I betray him." Draco kissed Harry's forehead. "I'll try to stay alive... you have to try too. Do whatever it takes to live, Harry. I don't give a damn if we have to disappear. I don't care if The Dark Lord burns the whole world down. He wants you dead... but you have to survive."
"Well, I'm glad that you're making friends with Potter. That will help our reputation."
"No..."
It's really strange to see my father being so concerned and affectionate. I can't say I mind it.
It takes a moment for him to respond, but when he does, his voice is steady. "Strange… it's like a mixture of relief and fear and grief."
"My father… brought you coffee?" I blink.
"Is there anything else?" Draco asks, his voice trembling.
I want to ask him more about Goldstein, but I'm so relieved that he is here and unhurt, the words die in my throat. Instead, I dip my head and press my lips to his.
Harry's squeezing my hands so tightly, his knuckles have gone white. I rub the back of his hands with my thumbs until he relaxes.
?!" I jump to my feet, anger coursing through me.
"Rude." Harry threw a pair of socks at Ron.
"How are you feeling?" I ask gently.
"I think Harry, Hermione, and Luna should go," Ginny muses. "Hermione because she's his healer and Luna can give us updates. Of course, it's obvious why Harry should go."
"Does… does this happen often? I thought it was just his condition worsening that was causing his lack of appetite."
He silenced her 'told you so' with a dark look.
"I didn't sleep with him," I say, my voice sounding hollow.
Draco turns in my arms and presses his face into my shoulder. A sobbing breath leaves him.
Draco reaches for the paper, but I automatically hold it out of his reach. I do not want him to read this. My blood is boiling. How in the hell did Anthony work his way around DAISIES?
"Well... this mark was made by sharp teeth. Like fangs? And the teeth clearly broke skin... but this looks weeks old."
I blanch and flush the toilet, scooting back to lean against the wall. "I was an idiot. It's all my fault that people got hurt that day."
"Give her a little taste of the Cruciatus curse."
I sigh and consider this. It makes sense, but I'm reluctant to touch it. I reach out and prod it with my wand instead. The fog dissipates.
After a moment, Harry starts laughing. Ron glances at Harry, but then he starts chuckling too.
"No. At least not without Hermione. She might know a way."
"I… yeah. You're right." He clears his throat and changes the memory again.
"Will it help him?" Ginny says from the doorway.
"He might be sleeping," Ginny suggests quietly, taking my hand and squeezing it.
Luna folds herself into something like a human pretzel. She is much more flexible than I am. It takes me a few moments to get in that position even in the water. On land, yoga is more difficult. Here in the water, the natural buoyancy and weightlessness helps me get into the positions Luna taught me. It's why we practice in the sea.
It was enough to make Harry smile.
There's something off about my father. I can't place it. He is thinner than I remember. His eyes are sunken in. That's normal for someone who spent five years with dementors.
I blink and look over at him. He's sleeping. Thank all the gods. I would rather drink one of Longbottom's potions than let Potter see me now. My face is so hot, I'm sure I'm blushing like mad.
"So, tell me what he did to you," I say gently, bringing Harry's hands up to kiss his fingers.
Draco's hand in his hair tightened. "I swear if you are pulling my leg, I will-"
Breathing is getting harder. I don't know how I missed this. Harry had given me proof when I was in the hospital.
"He isn't in critical condition,” Hermione finally breathes out, relief in her voice. “In fact, I think he's just sleeping. His heart is doing as well as it was when I last checked."
"Yes!" Draco's hand is suddenly in my hair again.
Warmth fills my chest. Beaming, I kiss him again. It's hard to kiss him at first because I can't stop smiling, but the feeling of his lips is enough to focus my attention solely on snogging him.
Blood blossoms across the girl's torso. Shrieks fill the air until Amycus silences her with a spell. She's still struggling, but she can't escape the chains.
"Yes," I say.
Someone is shaking me. I open my eyes and realize I'm still screaming. I cover my mouth, sitting up abruptly. My face is wet. Someone starts dabbing my face with a cloth.
"I'm not cheating on you! Hermione is like my sister! And she is engaged to Ron!"
After thinking about it all week, I've decided that it's his choice. If Malfoy wants to deal with fame and he wants to be with me, then I'll be happy to be with him. I think. I thought I would be happy with Anthony too, but Malfoy isn't Anthony.
"Maria didn't die,” my Draco begins to speak with a soft voice. “I saw her after the battle, looking like a corpse, but still alive. I think she was tortured for information that she never gave up. Otherwise they would have killed her." His voice sounds hollow as he watches the girl being dragged away.
The mobility spell wears off as Amycus locks the door. Draco jumps to his feet and whips his head around in a panic, clearly looking for an escape. Then, a small moan escapes from the girl.
It was awful. He wanted to show them all he was still alive, but all he could do was stay limp. He closed his eyes again.
"Uh... you missed one." Potter steps closer to me and lifts his hand.
"Does Luna know?" Draco asks suddenly.
"Who is responsible for this, Draco?" I ask, barely managing to keep my voice calm.
"Pans?" Draco mumbles, bleary-eyed.
"I'll be right back." Potter runs his fingers through my hair before leaving my room.
There's a moment of stunned silence. I stare at Blaise. He winks at me and leans in so quickly, I don't have a chance to react.
I meet Harry's green eyes. He looks so tired. I squeeze his hand. He's so close, our knees are touching.
"Moreover,” she continued, “you are still watching him despite the fact that he has done nothing suspicious. I can see the frustration in your eyes whenever you try to bait him and he ignores you. You want him to stop acting a part, right? That’s obviously what your note means with ‘free your fated mate’. You need to help him stop acting like that. And if all that wasn’t enough argument for you yet,” she added, a hint of a triumphant smirk on her lips as she gave the final blow, “It's not like you can deny you're in love with him because you told us over the holidays while you were drunk."
"Yes. At least, I'm hoping he did. I don't think an intruder would have known about the cloak. I doubt they would have known which book had the curse in it either." I gesture to the dozens of books around the room. "And that's the only book missing."
on it. The skin stitches back together.
He hands me the book he brought with him. It looks… normal. There's nothing sinister about it. I take it. It's called
Draco's fingers pushed Harry's chin up. He brushed the hair out of Harry's eyes. Harry felt relief flood him. It wasn't appropriate, but Draco was touching him again. It soothed the ache in his mark.
"Harry," he breathed again.
"What will happen to you?" she says quietly.
"I'll help you too." Ginny grins. "I've been wanting some revenge."
"I will, sir. I will go look for Draco."
"Nah. Well, I guess so. At least until Dad comes in. I'm actually here because Hermione owled me yesterday. She said she wants me to take a look at you, if it's alright." Bill smiles and the scars on his face tighten a bit.
"Mr. Malfoy, your son needs rest. You barging in here is not going to heal him," a woman with a heavy Irish accent says firmly.
Ginny and I have always had different tastes. I like sweet curry, but she likes it spicy. She rarely makes it sweet unless she's apologizing or trying to bribe me.
A soft sound escaped Harry's throat. Malfoy jerked away from the kiss, meeting Harry's eyes.
Draco opens his mouth, but Nagini rears up behind Narcissa. Her mouth opens wide again, a clear warning for him not to say a word if he doesn’t want his mother to be hurt. Blanching, Draco shakes his head.
"Harry!" Arthur looks panicked. "Draco and Lucius are gone!"
I pause, taking that in and processing it. I can understand her logic behind all of those flowers. I can only imagine what Draco must have felt after the tattoo was finished. Then something occurs to me.
"Is something wrong?" Hermione asks alarmed.
"I can't show them to anyone, Harry. I can't. I can't relive them," he says hoarsely. "I can't let you see me like that."
"What is going on here?!"
"It's more than that. We all channeled our magic into this stone," Father says, clasping my shoulder. "It's filled with the magic of people who love you."
They were naked.
but it's coming from my arm, not a wand. There is a mist of black leaving my skin. I feel faint. The pain lessens gradually as more and more of the mark is sucked out of me. Or maybe I'm just becoming numb to the agony.
I nod and watch him go. Once the door closes behind him, I take a breath and look my father in the eyes.
"I know! But I think I know who it was!" Lucius looks pale. "I just don't understand how because he was a right idiot... he doesn't seem capable of pulling off a murder attempt."
"I thought mother... Vin... poison?" That should have been a shout. I should have been screaming. Everything hurts. My head hurts. It's hard to speak.
"Yes, I can. Move in with me until we find out who is trying to hurt you. My house is protected under the fidelius charm."
"I'll look through the books in the study to see if I can find anything about this curse," he says, giving Harry a curt nod as he passes him.
"We expected this. I have a right to know what they're saying about me."
(See the end of the chapter for
I have too much to think about right now. I need advice. Malfoy completely shattered the mental image I had of him tonight.
I'm starting to think I don't know Malfoy as well as I thought I did... or maybe Luna was right and Malfoy is a different person now. I don't really know... but this new side of him is tugging at my curiosity.
I prod Hermod awake. He hoots at me and stretches his wings sleepily. "I need you to bring this to Head Healer Sunborn. Can you do that?"
Draco is about to smirk - I can see his lips twitching - but I cut it off by nudging my cock against his mouth. He lets me in and I give him what he wants.
Anthony growls. Literally growls. I ignore him. Kingsley taps the parchment with his wand. It glows faintly as words appear on it.
"Draco! He was attacked! Cruciatus! Cardiac arrest!" she shrieks. "We need you! St. Mungos!"
Harry felt a hot rush of anger at those words. He wanted to scream at Ron that Draco wasn't slimy or a git. Then, he realized he had just used Draco's first name in his head. He liked the way it sounded.
Just want to say, Abscondium is a spell I invented. It locks a memory away rather just erasing it like Obliviate would do.

And if anything, Ginny and her wife Luna will tell you that it was
"There, there. That's better."
The color seems to have drained from Draco's face. His eyes are fixed on the
"We think one of Voldemort's followers conjured the snake. They would have a reason to want to hurt you."
"I'm sure there's ingredients for an antidote somewhere here. I can make it," I offer.
Last month, George and I developed a spell. We wanted to use it on Anthony, but never had the chance. The spell relocates the victim's cock and balls to their forehead. We call it the dickhead curse.
"You might not have said you love me yet and that's okay. I know you care about me a lot. That's why I'm trusting you. I'm trusting you to see me at my worst, my weakest, and still want to be with me. Then, I think you'll understand that even if I see the memories haunting you, my feelings for you won't change," I say gently, running my thumbs over his sharp cheekbones.
"The first thing is I'm not dating Anthony. I broke up with him weeks ago."
Hermione frowns, but leaves the fireplace. I have ten more minutes on my break left, but I'm feeling restless. I decide to check in on my patients early.
"What do you mean? He's constantly being a dick to me. When I caught him crying in the loo, he tried using the Cruciatus curse," Harry said irritably. "You have to hate someone to use that curse!"
"Probably." An expression of fond amusement crosses Draco's face.
"This was during the spring holiday of seventh year," my Draco murmurs.
"Not really. She also told me communication is more important right now than usual. Like letting you know if I need you to stop. Nothing fast or rough either, obviously." I rub a hand over my face.
"There won't be too many more twelve hour shifts. There are few transfers coming in." Elliot consults his clipboard. "In fact, we have a transfer starting tomorrow. Aoife McHale is coming from Brigantia Hospital. Ireland has a different way of doing things, so it is to be expected she'll need time adjusting."
I see him. I see Harry. He is leaving the stairwell. He looks exhausted, but I can't see any signs of a fight.
"Ginny," I start, but she cuts me off.
I force my body into one of the yoga positions Luna taught me. I breathe.
And is it true that Mr. Potter was your healer?
When Malfoy was finished, there was no sign that he had been hurt. His palm looked completely normal. Malfoy raised his hand to his lips and kissed the spot where the scar had been.
"I love you too." Harry's lips brush my forehead.
Grabbing his hips, I hold him still and watch as his greedy hole swallows me with every thrust. Every time I pull back, his body sucks me in.
Something looks off with him. Like he's upset about something. I want to ask him what it is, but I school my face into a neutral expression.
Ginny snatches the book out of Hermione's hands and disappears into the library.
"Weasley needs to work on his healing charms."
"But…" Draco glances down at our laps. "I suppose that's a good idea. I want to freshen up anyways."
"Your dad is still the same as always," Potter mutters, shaking his head.
him! I'm not about to let anything happen to my
"These aren't
Harry stared at Malfoy dumbfounded for a second. He couldn't quite believe his eyes. He tripped as he staggered toward Malfoy. A sharp pain cut through his hand as he tried to catch himself. The floor was littered with glass and porcelain from their fight.
"Please… save my boy."
Even if Malfoy doesn't want to be with me, I still would rather be alone than be with Anthony now. I guess I don't need romantic companionship. I have my friends and family. I have love. If Malfoy does want to be with me, that will just be a bonus.
As soon as Luna puts down the book, Ginny starts talking.
"It means, if DAISIES is authorized, Anthony won't be able to come near Harry. He won't even be able to speak about him. He won't be able to harm Harry again."
"A Death Eater. He cast the Cruciatus curse on you. I couldn't see who it was." Luna frowns faintly. "I cast a bat bogey hex on them, but he disapparated before I could do anything else."
Okay, I definitely like this Draco better than the one I went to school with.
"After what you did to Anthony, yeah. I mean, hell, I like you well enough now." Ron shrugs.
And no amount of hate mail or howlers or other threats will change that.
"Break it off with him and ask Malfoy out."
"We need a plan of action," Ginny says, breaking through my thoughts. "At least something for the immediate repercussions."
If you liked this chapter, feel free to leave a comment! I love it when people say hi ♡♡♡
I want to protest because the thought of Harry leaving right now is enough to make me want to cry. Which is ridiculous. I force myself to let go of him.
"It's called Let's Dance."
Harry into the bed. His movements were steady and unhurried. He really was making love to him and Harry was falling in love all over again.
"I wouldn't choose you as my mate for either of those reasons. Why would you think that?" Harry asked as Draco's free hand settled on Harry's hip, nervously fluttering as if he wasn't sure it was okay to touch.
"Was there any sign of a struggle?" Aoife asks in a thick Monaghan accent.
If you liked this chapter, feel free to leave a comment. I love it when people say hi. ♡♡♡
"Were you expecting it to?" I snort, helping him up as much as he will let me - which is just holding my hand while he scrambles to his feet.
I can still hear his screams echoing in my ears.
"If you dare say he's a pureblood, so help me-"
"Find… fuck. Who am I going to send this to?" he mutters to himself. "Find Ginny Weasley. Be sneaky. Don't get caught."
"I'm going to kill him." Ginny's eyes glint with hatred.
Harry gets off the bed and crosses the room. I've never seen him look so angry.
Harry cracked his eyes open in time to see Neville pull the sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat and cut off Nagini's head in one swift move.
He looks scared. I trail my fingers up his chest to rest my hand against the side of his throat. His pulse is beating more irregularly than it should be given the circumstances.
I force down my confusion at hearing that. I need to remain professional. Malfoy is my patient. Parkinson moves closer to me.
"Harry…" Draco is staring at the pensieve anxiously. "You don't have to show me this. I'll let you mind walk without it. I can't back down now that my mother knows a way to break the curse exists."
He's still staring at me. His hand is between our faces. He touches my cheek again. I can barely breathe. It must be my imagination because it looks like he is about to kiss me. His eyes keep darting from my eyes to my lips.
She casts the bubble head charm on us and stows her wand down her suit. I follow her into the warm water. Silvery fish scatter as we wade farther out.
"You mean blood? Because whenever you two have been close enough to smell each other, you were in a fist fight."
Harry described the blood, the way Malfoy glowed, and the kiss. He even told her about the biting. When he finished by telling her about the way Malfoy stopped glowing and the interaction with Snape after, Hermione pursed her lips, looking troubled.
Draco does the cutest thing I've ever seen him do. He pouts at me. Merlin... I have to stop myself from kissing the pout off his lips.
"Draco… the veela I saw at the Quidditch cup. They had wings. Will you get wings too?" he asked sleepily.
"Back up. What did you just say about Anthony?" Hermione scowls. "Was he here? Why didn't you wake me up?"
When I stumble into the kitchen, Kreacher is right there, sweeping.
"Wait!" Lucius holds out his arm, blocking my way out.
"There's the Malfoy I know," he mutters, slouching in the armchair. "Give me back my wand."
"I think they feel cool, but other than that, it's kinda like touching air. Cool air. You'll see soon enough."
Draco presses back against my face, his hips moving eagerly. I let him grind against my face as I fuck him with only my tongue.
Blaise wraps an arm around me. "Hullo, Lucius. I'm dating your son."
"Love you too, Pans."
"About what you said earlier. I know the whole story about the vanishing cabinets. I'm actually quite impressed you managed to get it to work. That was some serious magic for a kid."
I think he's trying to comfort me. I feel numb and vaguely sick.
"So, we have to find another way to cure you. Where do we start?" Ginny asks, sitting on the desk.
I open my mouth to respond but then snap it closed. Luna was right. There's absolutely no doubt about it now. That dream I had was shared with Harry.
He summons a potion and hands it to me. I drink it automatically.
I look at her, my mouth falling open. "We're talking about Malfoy. You saw the way Ron acted just now, yes?"
"When Potter brought me home, I checked on the bees. He followed me to them. I cast my charm on him," I start.
I stop just before casting the spell. The dark mark looks like it's being pulled from my skin… to manifest in front of me.
I want to argue, but if I do, I'll be proving that I am too attached to Draco. Instead, I take a deep breath.
"I've told you this before, honey, but it's hard to trust a guy who likes both men and women. There's twice the chance you'll cheat on me." He smiles sweetly up at me. He tells me this at least once a week.
Harry had sensed the pain and fear from Draco that night. Had felt the desperation. He couldn't quite blame Draco for any of it. Harry wasn't sure he could say he would do any differently in his shoes.
"Is something wrong?"
Bill tilts his head and looks thoughtful. "I'm not sure. It's attacking your heart, but the source seems to be in your mind."
"Harry, you need to get more rest outside of work. Astolpho will be covering half of your shift today. They will be here at four. I fully expect you to
Anthony answers the question before I can even open my mouth.
"I will," Harry says sincerely, his arm tightening around me.
"You said you would be off at seven! And you smell like Hermione's perfume!" Anthony glares. "I was right to come if you're going to cheat on me with her!"
Actually, that part is mildly confusing. I haven't received any mail from Anthony.
My father looks ragged, but he has refused to leave my side. He hasn't spoken much. He just put a hand on my shoulder, told me he was relieved I was alright, and then sat down.
"I can't go back," I object.
"Until the summer between third and fourth year. That summer, I told them about my deranged murderous godfather and how he liked to check on me. That scared them enough to leave me alone."
kids, Harry. I did everything that I was told from that point onwards."
I take a breath, reminding myself that this might not be the curse affecting me. It might not even be a curse. Harry and Bill could be wrong.
With some small, but mostly inaudible grumbling, Malfoy came over to where Harry was scrubbing at a cauldron which someone had coated in a thick purple goop. She managed to make it a whole twenty seconds before succumbing to the need to goad Harry in some way.
Iana deflated, the wind going out of her sails. "What?"
"I need to," said Harry. "Whatever happens, I couldn't live with it if you or Mum, or even Effie" — she bumped his shoulder, but there was the beginning of a smile on her face — "died because I was too scared. I'm meant to be a Gryffindor."
Harry wanted to ask what that was, but Iana was lost in her recollection.
They both stepped aside to let the Ravenclaw house ghost past as she floated by. Harry was careful to avoid looking her in her spectral eyes. She always looked so very sad.
"Like a sink, I guess. Covered in runes," said Harry.
Slowly, as Harry continued to whisper his best comforting words, the hitches in her breathing slowed. Finally, after what must have been a few minutes at least, she spoke.
"Well, she's hot, yeah," said Harry shaking his head, "but she's also a hateful bitch. She'd probably snip your head off like one of those black widow spiders just as soon as you'd blown your load."
"Uncle Orontius let him in," she said simply. It took Harry a moment to work out who she was talking about, until he remembered that Crabbe's father was called Orontius. "Along with some of his followers."
"Maybe I didn't—" She stopped speaking suddenly as she slapped her hand over her forehead and hissed in what sounded like pain.
"You know how annoying his friends can be," said Effie, shaking her head. "I think I'll stay here."
She turned back, eyes straight ahead, and her pace sped up. As soon as she stepped off the bridge and onto the rough gravel path that wound through Hogwarts' grounds, two figures in black popped up next to her, and pulled her off in the direction of an old dilapidated cottage that Sirius had once told Harry had belonged to the old groundskeeper before he'd been forced out by Lucius Malfoy and his cronies.
Iana's glare returned. It seemed he'd hit a nerve. "Owls aren't secure," she said firmly. "Especially not at Hogwarts."
"Alas! Were it so simple." Dumbledore shook his head, his long beard following behind in slow waves. "It is an understandable conclusion to reach. Her mother, Narcissa was a young woman of undoubtedly noble blood, and bearing the name of a flower, after all. But no, the last line, part of the Prophecy which Voldemort never learned, clearly does not identify Iana. '
"We're six games in and you've only got fifty points," Harry pointed out.
"How can you know that?"
"You have your secrets and I have mine," said Harry evenly.
"Dumbledore doesn't think Voldemort had the chance to create his sixth before he tried to kill you," Harry replied. "So that just leaves one. And he seems sure it's an item belonging to Rowena Ravenclaw."
"Do you think I simply sat on my hands for the last sixteen years?" she asked in response. "When Albus told us about the prophecy which he thought applied to Harry, I researched everything I could on the subject." She shook her head sadly. "I suppose I was really just trying to prove that it couldn't be Harry, but all I did was make myself certain that it was."
"Nah, that's just what they want you to think," said Ron.
"We found one," Harry explained once he was close enough to be able to speak quietly. "Iana destroyed it, but it didn't want to go easy."
Effie grinned and bumped him with her shoulder. "Real grown up there."
Iana stared at him in surprise, before her lips tightened once more, and the ghost of a frown passed over her expression. For a moment, he thought she was going to laugh in his face, but she didn't. Instead, she merely scoffed, before turning on her heel, and leaving the cabin. It took a moment for Crabbe and Goyle to come to terms with the sudden reaction, but a few seconds later they too were gone.
There was a long silent moment in which Stump's eyes widened slightly in surprise before the corners of that awful grin turned up just a little more.
The trunk most definitely wasn't packed. It wasn't much of a strategy, as far as these things went, but if he just stayed locked in his room, surely Voldemort could just ignore him.
If only Colin's camera had survived the first few weeks of his first year. Harry remembered how excited he'd been to finally meet
"So what happened?" Harry asked, unable to restrain his curiosity. She'd raised the subject, anyway.
"Shshsh," said Harry, glancing over in the direction of Madam Pince's desk.
"Your mother's?" Harry repeated.
"There you are!" said Dean, giving Harry a slap on the back as he did so. He looked over at Neville. "Looks like you were right, mate. Musta been Effie."
"Amazing," said Iana, her expression very similar to Harry's own wide-eyed wonder.
"So you showed her some of Dumbledore's memories," said Harry, realising some of what must have happened. "What was in them?"
"Snape!" Sirius' lame attempt to cover it with a cough convinced absolutely no-one.
Ron actually looked abashed. "Sorry," he said.
As Ron prepared his return salvo, Harry found himself watching Iana more closely. There was something in how she was standing, that just seemed… strange. She
"Huh?" she said, breaking away from the fleeting scenery beyond the window. She glanced at Harry for a moment, though he was unable to work out what the look was supposed to mean. "I guess I'll be revising too."
"He is
Crabbe and Goyle were, as ever, firmly attached to her coat heels but more than just them were keeping an eye on her. A substantial portion of Slytherin was watching her every move, even a few of the teachers. On more than one occasion, Harry had thought he'd finally been in luck, only to be thwarted by the sudden appearance of Professor Snape from out of nowhere.
Given that he didn't really understand how it was that he or Iana were still alive, Harry couldn't resist turning to look at her. She met his eyes, looking a little embarrassed.
"I think I'll have that bath now," she said shortly. Without saying anything else, she retreated into the bathroom, and slammed the door shut, neatly cutting Effie short.
"At this rate we won't be done until Halloween," said Malfoy as she snatched the cauldron from him before giving it the most cursory drying.
Effie shook her head rapidly. "I heard Professor Flitwick say that the protections are just about ready to collapse."
But it seemed fairly obvious that Dumbledore hadn't returned the favour.
"If others have been able to find the locations, they must have discovered some kind of connection," said Iana. Obviously she hadn't been listening to him. "My father, Dumbledore and you said some other Death Eater all found the locations of some of them?"
A look of vicious glee crossed Voldemort's face, and he batted away Harry's return hex as if it was little more than a first year's jinx. Another curse followed close on the heels of the first, and once again Harry only avoided death by throwing himself out of the way. His wand ended up tangled in his robes, and before he could free it, pain such as he had never known suffused every part of his body. Liquid fire suffused his veins.
"I think you were in shock," said Harry with a shrug. It sounded good at least.
That drew a groan. A proud Gryffindor he might be, like his father before him, but even he knew that there were no real upsides to being the person responsible for waking Effie. He was honestly amazed that she seemed to make it in time for all her classes at Hogwarts considering that it took nothing less than a natural disaster to rouse her when she was at home.
"That is…" Dean began before he trailed off into silence.
"Alright, as it's your birthday, we'll move away from your mum's shaggability," said Dean charitably.
"I can handle George. It's Anthony I am worried about." Hermione shoots me a sharp look, so I continue. "We rowed last night. I am fairly certain he's still cross with me because I insulted his grandma's turtle soup recipe... and I'm quite livid myself. He hit Kreacher with the knockback jinx when he tried to tell him I wouldn't like turtle soup."
Harry took a chance and kissed Draco's forehead. "It's gonna be alright."
"I took my potion a few hours ago."
There were hands on him, massaging his back as Draco's mouth travelled downward. Harry found himself relaxing despite being more aroused than he had ever been in his life.
Harry kissed Draco with a year's worth of longing. Draco hesitated, but only for a moment. The hall erupted into noise around them.
loose on the school while our son was there?"
Our friends sure think it was simply the tension between us and that we had feelings for each other even back then.
I wish Hermione was here. She would probably understand why Harry was talking about daisies of all things. She would probably know how to handle this whole situation.
I could go wake her up. She's sleeping in the break room before her next shift. It's right down the hall. I won't though. She works so hard and is juggling too many things right now. She needs her rest.
Draco took advantage of Harry's distraction to take the last few long strides to the bed. He laid Harry down on it and climbed over him.
"No. I can do that after your heart is healed." I run my fingers up his chest. "I want to ride you tonight, if you'll let me."
Minty's eyes grow wide. She looks scared. "I haven't seen him, miss. Isn't he at the hospital?"
"Not really. I don't socialize much. Luna and Pansy aren't interested in playing Quidditch and Ginny is too busy playing professionally to have time to practice with me."
"It looked like it was satisfying." I smile weakly. "He was in so much pain at the end though. His mark manifested out of his skin and he was screaming. It was strange. Your flower tattoos looked like they were fighting the mark."
"Unless you don't want to. I think the urge will become painful if we wait too long though." Draco raised an eyebrow. "I haven't done this either."
"To be honest, I don't give a damn if I am imagining it. You jinxed Kreacher. I don't love you. I don't want anything to do with you."
your brother."
I do. The curse, the poison, Crabbe… I tell her everything except that I'm dating her son. I think she can tell. There's a strange look in her eyes that says she knows exactly what I'm not saying.
"Malfoy!" Potter tries to dig his heels in, but he's too tired to fight me.
As soon as they were out of the room, the door closed behind them. Harry and Draco collapsed onto the floor, coughing. Next to them, Ron was helping Hermione off the broom, holding her close, while Goyle was slumped on the floor. His friends must have rescued him.
I feel his lips brush my temple. Harry just kissed me? I look up, still crying. I can see a blush rising against his tan skin.
Harry's hand tangled in Draco's hair as a strangled sound escaped his lips. Draco's mouth was so hot and wet. If Harry could have orgasmed, he would have as soon as Draco started sucking.
"Well, the last resort is series of complex spells. It's called
"Ha ha ha. Very funny." I glare at him.
"There will be plenty of time for that later."
"Potter..." he mumbles, grabbing my hand.
"What is going on, Potter?" Zabini demands.
The next year was one of the worst years of Harry's life. Draco's task was to kill Dumbledore. Even though he didn't go through with it, Dumbledore still died. Harry had encouraged Draco to complete his task… and there hadn't been time after to talk to his mate before he disappeared.
I cut Luna off with my hand over her mouth. "If you shut up right now, I'll ask her."
"What was the dream about?"
Draco looks at me like I'm mad, but then he sighs and flicks his wand. Memory after memory forms and dissolves in quick succession. All of them are of Draco using curses against other students while Amycus or Alecto watches. There are dozens of these memories. In every single one, the Draco in the memory looks void of emotion even as students beg him to stop.
Everything around me fades into white noise. My world narrows down to Draco, my boyfriend who is going to be just fine. We can heal his heart now.
"I hope it was a good punch," Luna says darkly as she sits cross-legged on the floor.
"I don't know," Draco murmured. "It could be anything… it looks a lot like dirt to me."
My lips twitch as Minty scolds me. She takes good care of me. I love her. "Sorry. I'll be more careful in the future."
"You were about to kiss me then?"
"What is that promise?" I ask, breaking it.
"Hush you." I kiss his cheek before leaving.
"Fuck!" Draco hissed, clutching Harry to him.
"He touched one of them that was on my face though." I follow her movements, making sure my breaths are deep and even. "He held my cheek."
They spent most of that year hunting horcruxes. Whenever it was too much, Harry reached through the bond to feel Draco's warmth. It kept Harry
A startled laugh spills out of my mouth. I don't know why I'm laughing, but now that I am, I can't stop. I hear Potter giggle. Actually giggle.
"Draco," Blaise murmurs, his dark eyes are on Draco's hand.
Draco makes a face at me, but pulls me into a quick kiss. "Don't take too long."
The world seems to fracture as my orgasm washes over me. I hear myself crying out for Draco, but it sounds far away. Aftershocks of heat roll through me as I slowly come back to myself.
"It wasn't the Dark Lord doing this! It was a spell that possessed the girl to do it for him! The spell wouldn't have been able to differentiate between our child and another!"
..." I read aloud from the section Arthur is pointing at. "Curse. Kills victim by destroying the mind and heart. Irreversible. Slow death. Causes the heart to enlarge and beat erratically until it stops beating all together."
Ginny wanted me to be in her wedding party, but with my job, it was impossible. I work as a healer in St. Mungos. I just finished my training last month. When I'm not working, Anthony takes up most of my time. I feel guilty about it. Ron and Hermione will be getting married soon too, and I don't think Anthony will be okay with me taking on best man duties for Ron either.
"Is she okay? Why isn't she here?" I twist the stem between my fingers, watching the flower turn.
"Hermione, we all know Snape is on Voldemort's side," Ron said in exasperation.
"He's just a house elf, Harry. You don't mean all that. You're special to me." He tries to kiss me, but I turn my head.
I blink, my head jerking up. "You're here about the curse? But what if there isn't a curse at all?"
"We're going to have to do something about that rats nest he calls his hair," my father murmurs in my ear.
kisses me. It's not slow or lazy anymore. Draco's lips are eager and demanding against mine.
The wounds were healing on their own. The skin was stitching back together.
"So you're marrying Luna now?" I hide a snigger behind my hand. "Does that include Ginny? I guess I should warn you, I don't like to share."
Harry chuckles and hugs me closer to his side. He's sitting in my bed with me. He's propped against the wall and one arm is wrapped around me.
I check myself in and head up to Powell's office, still gripping Harry's hand. Everything after that blurs together. I'm vaguely aware of nodding and Harry standing next to me the entire time. Someone guides me onto a bed. I think I've been led to a hospital room. I look down at myself and see I'm wearing a hospital gown.
"I shouldn't have kissed him. We decided we wouldn't do that while he was still my healer." I force myself to drink my water.
"Let's eat something." I kiss the corner of his lips.
"This isn't the time for all of that. Ask Ron about what happened with Anthony. But Draco and I are together and I care about him. A lot. And he's
besides cold nonchalance made Harry's heart pound.
"Hermione, I'm still dating Anthony even if we are fighting," I mutter.
I obey the command without thinking, downing the familiar concoction. It takes a few seconds, but soon my heart rate starts to slow to a more manageable and safer rhythm.
"I need a shower," I announce, getting to my feet.
Harry and I watch them leave. When we're alone, I pull him over to the desk with the food on it.
"I tried telling him that this was all in my head and the real Harry didn't know this was happening. Harry said something like 'someone once told me that just because it's happening in your head, it doesn't make it any less real.' I thought it was strange." I hesitate again. "He tried kissing me, but I backed away. So he asked me to dance. He made music somehow."
"Harry looked like he was enjoying it if you ask me." Ron snickers. "But yeah, you should have probably waited until you weren't in public."
"I'm going to break up with Anthony," I say monotonously.
"Didn't you date Ginny and Chang?"
"Luna found me. She gave me a blood replenishing potion and healed my arm. I don't remember this, but she says I told her that I was planning on cutting my arm off to be rid of it. That's when she tattooed my arm. She took six flowers that she said represented me and surrounded the mark." Draco swallows roughly and grabs my hand. "Poppies for love and consolation. Evening primrose for youth and new beginnings. Daisies for purity and innocence. Morning glories for the renewable nature of love. Four o'clocks for being wonderful."
"That snake is molesting my brother!" Ron shouts, his voice cracking.
Draco gently frees his arm from Blaise's grip. He points to a closed white flower. "That's a moon flower. It will bloom tonight. It's a symbol of blossoming in dark times."
"I am making sure my healer isn't an incompetent buffoon when he is treating me," I retort, bringing his wand back to my bed. "Stay there or I'll hex you."
Moving between his legs, I settle my hands on his hips. "Draco, these are my work clothes. I wear something like this most days."
Malfoy's eyes were still glowing. Harry tried to help him up, but Malfoy wasn't cooperating. He was staring up at Harry, looking as if he had never seen him before.
Of course Draco Malfoy would be a git while he was dying. Harry forced himself to not roll his eyes.
Fuming, Harry stormed out of the bathroom to find Hermione and Ron.
Something that certainly was talked about and brought up in the recent article was the former school rivalry between you and Mr. Malfoy. One which this reporter indeed witnessed herself in her younger years. Blood and broken bones were even mentioned.
"Okay, whatever." Harry rolled his eyes at the two of them. "What did your notes say?"
"He's not seeing Anthony," I say firmly. "Anthony is his psychotic ex boyfriend."
My father pulls me into a tight embrace. It surprises me, but it feels okay. Not exactly safe, but reassuring nonetheless. I relax a little.
Luna and Draco share a look. She takes Zabini's hand. "Let's go and get some tea, okay? I'll catch you up on everything that has been happening while you've been in Australia."
I lose my position, falling face first into the sand. I sit up, rubbing sand off. It floats away in the water. Luna is watching me with amusement in her eyes.
"Pans, I'll be right back. I just need to see her. I'll only be an hour."
"I think it's one of the cursed memories. Bill said there were dark brown tendrils from the curse, right?"
Thankfully, he waited until we were almost to our destination before talking. I knock on Kingsley's door. The door opens by itself.
alpha). Harry had protested, but Pan had told him that he was not a ‘fucking messenger for immature numpties’. Which was rich because Harry had helped
Draco pushes at me. "Go!"
Harry didn't care. He scrambled through the water on his hands and knees until he reached Malfoy.
"Why?"
There's not just spells to turn a person inside out and leave them alive... though there are plenty of spells that are grotesque like that... including that one. And there is a crude drawing of it too.
"Your mum. I was worried. Draco…" I wrap my arms around his shoulders.
The gold condenses around my chest. It feels like my heart is being weighed down with bricks. I watch the gold sink into my skin.
Draco kisses me, but it's a hesitant kiss. I pull back and meet his eyes.
"No. Get Granger to do them. You might end up turning my hair blue." I raise my hand as if to block his magic. I'm partly joking, but I am serious.
"Hey! That's my grandma's recipe!" Anthony is growing angry. For once, I don't care. All of my patience is gone. "It's just a stupid turtle!"
"There's no need to be so tense. I've done organ transfigurations many times and I specialize in hearts." Powell smiles kindly, the wrinkles on their face deepening.
"Worse than Malfoy?" I ask, trying to deflect her anger with a joke.
"Gin... I can't breathe." She lets me go and I frown faintly. "I did RSVP."
My memory self slips away from the door and around a corner. Snape is standing there with a grim expression. There is something like a flesh colored string coming from his ear. He pulls it out and taps it with his wand, vanishing it.
"My desk is a mess," he notes breathlessly, swiping a finger through his own come and pressing it to my lips.
"No, I think this humiliation is punishment enough," Voldemort's cold voice says. "Unless… Draco, you surely don't feel sympathy for a professor whose classes you never took?"
Potter is murmuring in my ear. He's telling me I'll be okay. I don't feel okay, but here in Potter's arms, I feel a little better. He's hugging me tightly. It's like he's keeping me from falling to pieces.
"Exactly. We need time to study this. With work though..." she sighs.
A voice is speaking to me urgently, but I pull away. There's so much pain. I open my eyes, pulling out my wand. I need this pain to stop. It is worse than when I received the dark mark. I should've cut off my arm years ago. Anything would be better than this.
"Draco!"
"My heart feels fine, relax," Draco says, smiling and rolling his eyes. "I'm more concerned about how cold your semen is getting on my skin."
If you liked this chapter, feel free to leave a comment! I love it when people say hi ♡♡♡
Draco muttered.
"You… don't have to stay here," I say, watching the book Harry selected trying to bite his fingers.
"You're sorry for making us naked?" Harry rolled his eyes playfully. "It seems like that was our goal anyways."
