"I'll cast the charm," Malfoy said. "You keep an eye out for weird statues."
Phineas spluttered, "I am saying no such thing! We must think though of Gryffindor. Brave and noble, maybe, but also arrogant and boastful, wasn't he? He would not have kept his love a secret."
Draco shoved his hand away, and again his face flushed, but this time it was in anger. "What the hell are you doing?"
"I think it's safe to do so," Susan said. She tapped both cuffs, and then they vanished. "Will you be heading out to the desert right away?"
"You'll have to excuse me for not looking on the bright side of things when faced with death myself. I'm not terribly used to it," Draco bit out. "And spending who knows how long in the desert with only the choice of starving to death or finding Slytherin's pretty little death trap puzzle isn't exactly the way I want to go. At least, I guess we don't need to worry about contacting Bill anymore. He won't have any more information than these people."
"Ok, so what else was it?"
Malfoy stopped and turned sharply on him. "What does that mean?"
Draco moved back closer to the table but did not sit as Susan nodded and said, "It's about what you've both shown through those actions. Bravery to face Voldemort. Cunning to find a way to help without sacrificing reputation. And just countless other things that I know about you both. Granted, Draco, I didn't talk to you much in school, but word got around. Regardless of how you've changed since school, I know there was a time when you thought like Slytherin himself. Don't snort at me, this is important. Thinking like Slytherin and Gryffindor may just be the things that keep you two alive and help you succeed where others didn't."
Potter frowned and opened his mouth to say something, but he stopped himself.
"Why is that?" came his reply.
Potter nodded and tapped the tip of his finger against the table to emphasize his next point. "The Chamber of Secrets was kind of like that. You had to know where to look for the entrance and then know that Parseltongue opened the door." His look of apparent excitement at their breakthrough was gone in an instant. "I can't speak Parseltongue anymore though. I lost that ability when the horcrux inside me was destroyed."
"She just wants to make sure we have everything. And she said she'll Apparate us to just outside the Sphinx, so that'll save us a bit of time and walking."
"I love all the little sounds you make," Potter breathed in his ear. "And think of how many more sounds you'll make when I'm fucking you."
Damn, how had Potter heard him? Oh. Right, the tattoo on his arm would probably be lit up and burning now that Draco seemed to be in peril.
Susan took a deep breath and sighed, her shoulders slumping. "I'll explain everything. Just hang on." She turned away, glanced up and down the street, and then took out her wand and muttered a spell. Her motorcycle shrank to the size of a toy model, and she bent to pick it up and pocketed it. She straightened up, stowed her wand out of sight, and held out her hands for each of them. "I'll Apparate you to headquarters. I know you can't right now, but I can take you."
Malfoy gave a sharp, short laugh almost like he had choked on it.
Then movement caught his eye, and he nudged Malfoy and nodded in the direction of the wall adjacent to them. Another archway had opened, but instead of presenting a way out for them, it was letting something in.
Draco stabbed at his iced cinnamon bun with a fork while a flurry of activity buzzed around him. The Paris airport cafe where he was seated was tiny and loud. Truly, he hadn't realized how many Muggles used air travel like this. He had never had a reason to pay attention to such things. But now, he could see vacationing families, honeymooning couples, and men and women in suits about to go through security with their various luggage. Near the counter of the cafe, a mother wrestled a screaming toddler back into a stroller while her other child of maybe twelve ordered what he wanted from the cashier.
Malfoy came to a sudden halt on the street corner, and Harry rammed into him. He caught the blond around the waist before he fell from the force of the collision.
Harry nodded and moved behind him to allow the chain more slack as they stopped on the curb of a busy intersection. Once the way was clear, they stepped out to cross the street with some other pedestrians. Halfway across though, the loud roar of a car engine met Harry's ears, and he looked around. People screamed and darted out of the car's way as it barreled down the street, headed right for them.
A black metal shackle fastened itself around Draco's left wrist. Looking at Potter, he saw the man wore an identical one on his left hand as well. A chain of maybe two feet in length connected the two cuffs.
"Right, well, there's no rush, I suppose," Harry said. He moved over to one wall and sat down with his back against the cool stone. "We've made good time. Just tell me when to close my eyes and cast Muffliato on me when you decide you're ready."
"How did you know we'd show up here?" Draco asked. "We could have gone to Gryffindor's tomb first."
Malfoy shrugged. "About time to be getting up anyway. Dawn just broke." He paused and glanced away. "Along with Slytherin's voice again. Same message as last night."
Potter shook his head. "You're avoiding my point."
Harry pressed his lips together in a firm line. "I think we've done enough for one day. We should just tackle any Gryffindor stuff tomorrow. Because I know what you're really trying to do. You're trying to get out of talking about our feelings for each other. You agreed we would talk once we got back to Cairo."
Harry sighed deeply, unsure of whether that made him more hopeful or more irritated with the current situation. He turned back to McGonagall. "I'm sorry to leave you like this. You know I don't want to leave."
"Because I was good friends with Colin Creevey," she said simply. "I went to his funeral, and his brother explained that you had shown up one night, given their parents money, and performed a memory charm on them so they would think the money came from the Ministry of Magic as condolences and a thank you for their son serving in the war. And you didn't see Dennis watching from the stairs. You had to hand deliver the money because you didn't know how to use the Muggle post, and I suppose you forgot about Dennis since he was so much younger than you. You could have written him a letter by owl. I figured out the hand you had in the rest for myself."
"Technically, you do," Harry muttered.
Unsure of how to approach the situation but knowing he needed to do something, Harry tugged on Malfoy's arm. The pain was throbbing in his arm, and he needed it to stop. It had something to do with the man beside him, he was sure of that. Was the red glow and pain around the serpent meant to indicate that Malfoy was in peril? Clearly, the mark had only alerted Harry, so this must have been what it meant.
"You know," Harry said, walking over to him and stopping several feet away. "You still have a choice. You don't actually have to do this."
Potter nodded. "And some Muggle money and clothes. We'll probably wind up near Giza or the Valley of the Kings, I bet. Both are really popular with Muggle tourists."
Draco felt like he was suffocating, his ribs being crushed under an invisible boulder. "I...I..." He swallowed, knowing he was trapped, and he took a step back. "Y-yes." He shook his head. "But no one was supposed to know!" He pointed at Susan accusingly. "How do
He gave a loud huff, nearly bent double to try the zipper again.
"Potter!" a voice cut through Voldemort's shrill call of "Kill the spare!"
So, he had burned the letter, with no intentions of ever meeting Malfoy in London.
"Didn't think ghosts could interact with physical objects," Malfoy said.
"Move!" Potter barked, stepping over Draco's legs as he pushed back against the statue's strength.
Susan half-stood to lean over Potter's arm and get a closer look at the lion and serpent, both of whom were still glaring warily at each other. The animals hadn't changed position since that night in Potter's office when he had agree to work with Draco.
"Like this?" Draco asked, and it actually came out squeaky because Potter chose that exact moment to press his chest flush against Draco's back and rest a hand on the blond's hip. Was Potter actually holding him? Or worse -
"What's that?" Potter asked.
Draco nodded against his neck, feeling he was about to burst. He only needed a few more passes of Potter's hand and he would be there falling over the edge into bliss.
Draco shivered and swallowed, preparing his response while the rest of his body immediately went cold. This was a trick. A terrible trick from the prophecy. Potter did not really have feelings for him. He just couldn't. And it was cruel. Because Draco both did and didn't want Potter's feelings to be real. If Potter's feelings were real, that meant they had a chance...a chance for love...and for heartbreak. There could not be love without risk of pain, and Draco didn't want any more pain for the rest of his life if he could help it.
Luckily, Potter wasn't anywhere close enough to see Draco's face. The blond was standing on the balcony, his hands braced against the railing as he looked out upon the Great Pyramids of Giza. Even miles away from Cairo, they were huge and intimidating, giant structures penetrating the night sky. The nightly light show was currently playing. This involved what Potter said were projections and lasers all based on light machines. That didn't mean too much to Draco, but he couldn't help but feel it was impressive even though it was Muggle technology. Images detailing Egypt's pharaohs were projected onto the side of the pyramids as a voice, seemingly magically modified like Ludo Bagman's had been at the World Cup stadium, told a dramatic tale of battles and Egyptian deities.
"That's-" Draco started. But his whole mouth and throat felt suddenly too dry to get out the words as Potter nuzzled his neck. Maybe his heart would just burst from his body and kill him so this confusing torture would end. At the same time, he found himself wanting to lean back into his companion.
Harry nodded and walked with him to the archway. Peering inside, there were more green fire braziers, and in the center of the room stood the banshee. She was unmistakable. Even though she was cast in green light, Harry knew the color of her skin would be the same sickly green in broad daylight. Her long black hair swept the floor, and dark penetrating eyes stared at them. She wasn't screaming. Yet.
"Next stop, Leaky Cauldron, London!" called Stan Shunpike from the front of the bus.
"And how do you expect to stop us from just going on our own?" Draco asked.
Potter was staring at him as he seemed to put the pieces together. "This could take a long time," he said.
Stupid Potter. And stupid bus for not using a Sticking Charm to adhere their seats to the floor. How hard was it to do that to make sure the passengers weren't thrown around like sacks of dragon dung?
"You'll remove the cuffs then?" Potter asked, his gaze searching the woman's face hopefully.
"Slytherin has some explaining to do about that last test," Malfoy said darkly from the other side of the room. He held a few small bones in his hand and was searching for more.
Draco stared at the now still serpent, hoping it would speak again or laugh and say it was joking. But, it didn't move. His heart jolted wildly when Potter asked a moment later, "Well, what did it say?"
I have increased the rating to M for suggestive content. Things will likely become explicit in later chapters.
Susan slammed her hand down on the table, causing both Draco and Potter to jump. "I am trying to protect you. I don't want to be cleaning up your bones weeks from now." Tears shone in her eyes as she glared at them. "One of you give me your marked arm."
"Come on, pay attention to me, you bird brain!" Potter growled.
Draco laid down first, drawing the bedclothes over himself. He stared at the ceiling for several minutes while listening to Potter trying to get comfortable. The chain kept tugging sharply even after Draco's arm had been dragged off the bed to hang over the side and give Potter more room. After a while, Potter huffed in annoyance.
Potter suddenly went rigid, his eyes wide. "Pyramids," he mumbled.
Once the serpent went still again, Malfoy turned to Harry. "'Silence the herald of Death. What is seen will perish by the jackal.'"
"No," Draco said and looked away from him. "We said what we said to get the pyramid to appear. That's all."
"It's going to be a mummy, isn't it?" Malfoy said when Harry stopped beside him and drew his wand as the blond had done.
But Draco knew there was no arguing it. The chain was simply too short for them both to sleep comfortably like they had intended. So, he moved to let Potter into the bed. Then he instantly snatched one of Potter's pillows and one of his own and stuck them between them.
"I'm attracted to you," Potter said softly, and this time it wasn't just his breath that Draco felt against his skin. As he had spoken, his lips had brushed his ear.
"True." Draco nodded and backtracked to where the door had been. He slid his bag from his shoulder and slipped his wand into one of the outer pockets. "It looks like only one of us can fight it at a time. And seeing as it's Slytherin's pyramid..." He almost hoped Potter would volunteer to do this for him. He had always relied on magic for, well, everything. Wielding a dagger was a completely foreign concept to him. He knew that Potter had at least used a sword once in his life.
McGonagall had promised that his office would be locked and remain untouched in his absence. Ron or whoever they found to substitute for him would be given space in a vacant office somewhere else in the castle. As such, he felt secure in leaving some personal items behind, such as the Marauder's Map, the bottled memories he had stored beside the pensieve, and other such items. He wouldn't need them in Egypt and wherever else they were going.
He was right. As soon as his hand closed around the hilt of the dagger, the statue's staff slammed down onto his shoulder. A tingling numbness shot through his shoulder down to his fingertips, nearly making him drop the dagger. But he held onto the weapon and backed up quickly.
Susan nodded. "But, I can help with what little I do know. And that is that it's in the desert somewhere."
"You can start with a small dose and see how long it knocks you out for," Potter suggested. "The book says one swallow is good for two hours, but it differs based on a person's height and weight. And it's a four hour flight, so I figure that if nothing else, you'll be out for the majority of the trip."
Harry couldn't help but smirk. "Yeah, if you'd like that. But if you're not into kinky stuff, we can-"
"Ok, so...yeah," Malfoy said. He motioned to Harry to step away while his hands went to the waistband of his pants.
"Yes, I'm afraid so. But, we still have some means of magical transport available to us. I took the Knight Bus to get here. It only travels in the UK though, and based on the prophecy talking about desert and jungle, I think we're going pretty far abroad. There's always brooms, but-"
Knowing the only way to find out and get his anxiety to lessen from sheer anticipation, Draco walked through the doorway, closely followed by Potter. They found themselves in a chamber lit with more green fire braziers along the walls. As soon as they were both inside, the archway behind them turned to solid black stone. From what Draco could see, there also wasn't any door leading out of the chamber.
He picked up his wand and quietly sent his stag Patronus bounding through the door of their room. With any luck, Susan would be awoken by the stag's message and come soon to uncuff them.
At the same time, he didn't see why asking that question was even needed right then. The snake had given the instructions, and it wouldn't change them. It was best to just do as told. The sooner the third task was completed, the sooner they could leave the pyramid.
Then why had he acted the way he had in the clothing store? He could have left Malfoy to deal with the zipper. Malfoy would have just stripped the jumper off after a few more minutes of failed attempts and then opted for different clothing. He had done just that anyway. But, for some highly illogical reason, Harry had found himself unlocking the door and entering the changing room, even knowing Malfoy could have been in a state of undress. Then he had helped him as if Malfoy were a child. And then...he had lingered too long, caught on those eyes of bluish grey.
Someone knocked on the door. "Are you having problems?" came Potter's voice.
Harry lowered his book. "Would it make it better if I let you Stupefy me?"
He watched as Potter poured a few drops of their blood onto the map. The blood behaved just as if had the last time they had used it, sliding across the parchment and then sinking into the map. Again, the whole country of Egypt was soaked crimson. No words were added next to Slytherin's name, no indication of city or landmark to go to.
As they ate dinner, Draco was the most quiet of the three, only speaking up at choice moments as Susan and Potter talked. Again, he was grateful for her presence since it meant Potter wouldn't be solely focused on him. But, as Potter recounted the story, he also had brief moments of panic until he realized quickly that Potter was changing or omitting a few parts of the story. The man told the events as if the pyramid had simply appeared to them at dawn one day with no mention of divulged secrets of mutual attraction. And graciously, he recounted the pyramid as only having two tests inside, completely skipping from the banshee and Anubis statue challenge to Slytherin's burial chamber.
His face flushed involuntarily as he thought over Potter's actions of holding his hand during the flight, leading him quietly off the plane once they had landed, and sitting him down at the first food place they saw in the airport. The man had made sure he had food and water before walking off, saying he'd be back in an hour with a potion for Draco to take for the next flight.
But, he supposed it didn't matter to Slytherin. An archway had opened at the other end of the chamber, beckoning them on to the third task.
"I know that," Malfoy snapped. "I just..." He swallowed thickly. "Do you have any potions that might help?"
Harry tuned out Malfoy's continued grumbling as he looked around the plane. He didn't see what the big deal was. It was close quarters, but he found them cozy rather than irritating. Maybe that was because he had grown up in such a confined space in that cupboard under the stairs. It had felt safe, like a haven from his aunt, uncle, and cousin. Being in the plane now felt like that again.
Draco shrugged a shoulder, not looking up at him as he gathered the last bit of rice on his plate with his fork. "Same one or different is fine with me. As long as we have two beds."
Harry's ears felt like they may shrivel up, and he couldn't blame them. Even with his hands clasped over his ears, the wailing was already giving him a piercing headache. Could banshees kill with their voice alone? He couldn't remember right then, but he was convinced the answer was yes. If a statue didn't come kill them, maybe the harsh vibrating of his brain against his skull would do it for him.
As soon as they had checked into a new room and walked upstairs to it, Draco tossed his bag onto one of the beds and slipped into the bathroom without a word.
"And look at what letting people in did to Slytherin," Malfoy said, gesturing vaguely at the desert behind Harry. "He's spent thousands of years unable to move on because he's been so wrapped up in his feelings for Gryffindor. And even if you argue that they're the exception to the rule, which I get because people don't normally hang around after death pining for each other, it's still dangerous to have attachments. His attachment to Gryffindor led him to hurt in later years that he never recovered from."
Draco's stomach clenched like a sponge being wrung. Sure, he wanted the cuffs removed too, but Potter didn't have to look
"Quit refusing!" Malfoy snapped, holding his injured arm to his chest. "If I die because you're too stubborn to do this, Gryffindor and Slytherin won't be the only ones warring for eternity from their tombs."
A frown touched Potter's features. "Not exactly. I thought I could make a Calming Draught before our flight, but it takes a few hours longer than we have to brew. I did make a Sleeping Draught though."
McGonagall narrowed her eyes, and he felt the gaze alone might cut him. "Why?" It was slow and deliberate. Suspicious.
They decided to stay put now that Slytherin had communicated with them. There seemed to be no point to keep walking when they had their instructions. Despite this, Draco kept brushing off Potter's efforts to talk about Slytherin's words. Instead, he took out all his notes on the founder to review them yet again. He knew they wouldn't help as they didn't hold any clues to what challenges awaited in the pyramid. But, Potter left him alone while he was reading the documents, so he read them. And then reread them. And again. He only stopped when the sun set outside the tent and cast a green light over the expanse of desert. Once again, Draco heard the Parselmouth's whispered command.
Draco swallowed and took a step back. "I got it," he said heatedly.
Potter led them to the bed he had used the previous night and grabbed the two pillows and the comforter there. Then he moved to the other side of the room and tossed the pillows and blanket on the floor next to Draco's bed.
Draco's mind was a mix of emotions both during his shower and long after Potter had gotten dressed back in the main room. They were now sitting together on the floor, both of them brewing potions in their travel cauldrons to prepare for the coming journey to Slytherin's tomb.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "Watching you touch yourself would sure be arousing to me."
Draco sucked in a breath and closed his eyes in bliss as Potter fondled him. Potter struck up a rhythm that quickly had Draco breathless. With each pass of his hand, he ran his thumb over Draco's slit, and Draco was sure Potter was actually going to pull his soul from his body whenever he did orgasm.
Draco looked from the dagger to the statue, thinking it was just too simple that the dagger would fit neatly into the hole in the statue's chest. He glanced back at Potter, though he was careful to keep the statue in his peripheral vision. "This thing is going to come to life when I touch this dagger, isn't it? Don't smirk. I don't like this. It seems too easy."
"Then why all the tests and having your group protect it?" Potter asked.
"Your blood can track me?" Harry asked as he whirled to face Malfoy.
He was being stupid. What he was feeling...it was just a reaction to Malfoy's behavior. He didn't have actual feelings for the man. It was just him searching for affection, although in the unlikeliest and dumbest of places, when he had had none since Ginny.
Draco watched him, contently captivated by those green eyes. He swallowed. "I do have feelings for you. More than I probably realize. But, this...we...Potter, whatever we feel, nothing can happen between us."
The banshee's screams hit Harry full-force again as he took his hands from his head and began to rummage in his bag frantically.
"The cuffs are invisible to Muggles, so you won't draw attention going around town. And don't bother trying to remove them yourselves. Only I can take them off."
A tall statue similar to the one of Thoth in the previous chamber downstairs stepped out of the alcove. This one had a jackal's head and carried a flail.
As he opened the vial of blood and made to tip it over the map, Potter said, "We could go on a plane."
Susan turned back to them and gave a weak smile. "I have a lot to tell you two."
They stopped at a few of the shops in Diagon Alley to get supplies they might need for the trip, including a few potion ingredients. It was hard to plan ahead when they had no clue what traps or puzzles might await them in the Egyptian desert. But, as Potter pointed out, basic first aid potions were a good idea.
Somewhere between confusion and stunned disbelief, Harry stepped back and dropped into his chair finally. He stared at the pensieve as the seer sunk back out of sight. He prodded the contents with his wand to repeat the prophecy. Only after he had listened to it twice more did he look across the desk to Malfoy.
"That's great, and - oh!" She slid a long thin package off her back and and handed it to Potter. "I forgot. We have a couple tents at headquarters that we don't use too often. You can take this one. Don't worry, there's plenty of room for both of you. It's magically expanded inside and is enchanted to keep out sand and scorpions and the like."
"I forgot you had that," Draco said, straightening once Potter had pulled the Invisibility Cloak off and stuffed it back in his bag. He couldn't help but feel they had cheated the task. He was grateful for Potter's quick thinking for sure, but it didn't feel like they had fulfilled the task like they had been expected to. Other pairs before them wouldn't have had an Invisibility Cloak handy. Granted, he was sure the Disillusionment Charm would have worked if either of them were skilled enough at it.
"Whatever your secret is," Potter said, and Draco could tell he was being the most genuine he had ever seen him, "I will not judge you. Or laugh at you. You can trust me that it will never leave this tent. Ever."
Malfoy slowly opened his eyes to peer at Harry, though his grip on the bar between them did not lessen. He then pulled his hands into his lap like he was about to curl up in the fetal position and twisted so he was gazing out the window.
With one minute left until noon, he saw Potter slip through the door at the front of the pub. The raven-haired man stopped to say something to Rosmerta, and she drew and handed him a butterbeer before he looked around, saw Draco, and headed toward the booth.
Draco shook his head. "I don't want to talk about this right now. We have an enchanted pyramid to survive and a pretty irate spirit to free and talk to or whatever. Let's just get this done so we can get out of this desert."
Harry hurried back up to the school and packed within the allotted time frame. He was by no means eager to begin this journey with Malfoy, but he imagined the man would become intolerable if Harry did not arrive by their agreed upon time.
"Do you want to cum for me, Draco?"
Draco rolled his eyes. "Look, I don't know what you're playing at, Potter, but this isn't funny. Stop smirking! You're mocking me. Just because we...we held hands..."
they could form a tentative friendship to fulfill the prophecy, but that was it.
Susan nodded as if she were expecting these questions. "The aggressive name and appearance makes the Muggles leave us alone. It helps us be more efficient to get through the streets and get information from Muggles who might have witnessed something magical. As for our origin date, we've been around since Helga Hufflepuff was alive. Granted, back then, we weren't called by our current name, of course, and we didn't help control the magical community. That was all way before the Statute of Secrecy. Originally, this group was made to guard Salazar Slytherin's tomb."
Draco gave a jerky nod, already trying to think of a way he could stall this discussion longer once back in the city. But, looking toward the pyramid, he was reminded just how monumental this task before them might be and that returning to Cairo could be farther off than he suspected. Who knew what Slytherin had stored inside to test them?
"Can we help you?" asked the man in a kinder voice than Harry expected. If there had been any doubt in his mind that this group of bikers were Hufflepuffs, there was none now.
It took a solid ten minutes of Malfoy pacing, mumbling, and running his hands through his hair for Harry to get the answer out of him. And when he did finally confess what the serpent had instructed him to do, his face was the reddest Harry had ever seen it. He was sure a Gryffindor banner would have paled in comparison.
for it to. I could have gone into hiding, changed how I looked and ran away, anything. I could have escaped it. But, I chose to face it. Dumbledore said lots of prophecies go unfulfilled. If you had never heard this prophecy in your mother's memory, it would have passed over us to the next pair. We don't
"What is all this?" Potter asked.
Draco scrubbed a hand over his face and laid down his fork. Even though he knew he should eat because of the draining effect of panic attacks, he didn't feel hungry. Instead, it seemed he had swallowed an acid pop with how his stomach was clenching. So what if Potter had figured out he was gay? That didn't mean that Potter knew Draco was having feelings for him specifically. And it certainly didn't mean Potter felt anything in return. Potter had gone out with Cho Chang and Ginny Weasley while in school. Potter was definitely straight. What had happened with the zipper, on the plane, making sure he got food and water...that was all Potter extending a hand in truce for them to get through this prophecy quest where they weren't at each others' throats all the time or make the mark react badly. That was all.
"I suspect she was hoping I'd never find it. But, I did. And once I heard the prophecy, the mark appeared on my arm." He pulled up the right sleeve of his robes to reveal a mark identical to Harry's.
Potter took a long drink and was smiling when he lowered the mug. "It's rather good. Who taught you to...to..."
"You're claustrophobic? And you didn't say anything?" Harry exclaimed, though his voice was still low.
Draco lowered his hand from his mouth and used all his control to help stop his voice from breaking. "I'm fine," he said, though he sounded anything but fine. "I'll be out in a bit. Just go back to what you were doing."
Susan immediately agreed and after a brief discussion about where they wanted to eat, she Apparated all three of them plus the bike to a side street in Cairo. They walked only a block to reach the restaurant Susan had suggested. At that point, Draco was just grateful for food regardless of what it was.
The blond sat down a few feet from the fire, amazed at how quickly the desert was becoming cold when he had thought the sun would singe his eyebrows just an hour previous. He was only vaguely aware of Potter taking out pans and some of their food to cook. Draco had made it clear during their shopping that if Potter wanted the food to be anywhere near edible, he had to cook it. Growing up with house elves doing all the cooking for him since birth had made it so he didn't even know how to boil a potato correctly. Potter had found this statement hilarious, much to Draco's great annoyance.
"Can't
? When we're a continent away and can't Apparate?"
They entered the small bathroom that was connected to their room. It had a sink, a shower, and a toilet, with the toilet being right beside the shower. Harry assumed this is where one of them would sit while the other showered one-handed.
"Well, compared to the other tasks, I'm counting this one as just a smidgen easier," Harry said, barely refraining from rolling his eyes. "There's no immediate threat of getting bludgeoned to death at least."
But Draco didn't have long to think about a strategy yet. The ibis was closer now.
When he made to move out of its reach, he found it suddenly blocking his path. One step to the other direction, and it was there again. For a hunk of stone, it seemed to move much faster than Draco thought was even magically possible somehow.
This silence continued all the way back to the hotel and was only broken once they had entered their room and set down their bags.
Harry took out a book from his bag and began to read. He didn't know how long Malfoy would need to prepare himself mentally for this task, and reading seemed like something easy to do that communicated that Harry wasn't impatient with the situation.
"That's all perfectly normal," Harry said, frowning in thought as he realized just how lonely Malfoy must secretly feel. It reminded him of when he had lived with the Dursleys before he had ever known about Hogwarts. "I lost a lot of wonderful friends that night too. But...you can't cut yourself off from ever feeling a real connection with anyone ever again. Ron and Hermione were how I got through some of the darkest periods of my life."
His initial impression was that the room was empty except for a single statue. This didn't ease his nerves at all. Where was this enemy going to come from? Was it hiding?
Harry sighed and went to retrieve his bag, crouching to pick up his book and stuff it into the bag as well. He returned to Malfoy, who was now standing at the bottom of the staircase and looking up it as if trying to discern what they were about to encounter merely from the shuffling sounds.
Hesitantly, Susan nodded. "More than you could ever imagine." She turned back to the man standing on the other side of her bike, which Draco now noticed had
"I know, but I thought given that I was gone an hour..." Potter pulled out the chair on the other side of the table and sat. He pulled the plate with the cinnamon bun on it toward him and picked up Draco's abandoned fork. He sliced off a bite and held it up in front of Draco as if expecting him to eat it from Potter like a child.
"I'm basing it off other things too, but fine. I'll think about it."
Draco thought his face might explode from the combination of his embarrassment and Potter's apparent glee at this situation. "Get. Out."
"Yes, and I also have had a few thousand years to think over the matter, wondering why Godric never came to me. I am still bitter. I want to reunite, but I also want an apology first," Slytherin said. "So, tell Godric, when you find him, that I will be waiting for him in the room where it happened." At these words, Slytherin's ghost began to dissolve back into smoke.
"And I still don't," Malfoy said stiffly. "Just because you...whatever happened in that pyramid is going to
"That's all I'm asking."
Well,
Draco gave an unsatisfied grunt and slid the vial of blood and his pocket knife across the table. "Let's find out where we're going."
"Oh my dear Merlin!" Susan nearly screeched as she jumped off her bike and tossed her helmet aside. She sprang at Potter and gave him a tight hug before, to Draco's surprise, doing the same to him. She pulled back, grinning broadly. "I've been watching the horizon off and on since you left. You guys did it! And in hardly any time at all, too."
"Get off, Potter!" Malfoy wheezed, and Harry quickly removed his elbow from the man's ribs.
"No, you're going to be fine," Harry said softly and slowly. Yet he was thinking quickly, wanting to diffuse Malfoy's stress and his own pain as soon as possible. And, despite his own pain, being a calm anchor while the other person was panicking was essential, he thought.
"Regardless of how you feel about the task," Harry said after forcibly pulling his thoughts away from imagining what Malfoy's moans and soft sighs of pleasure would sound like. "You're going to have to do it. There's not a way out of it."
Draco chewed over his mouthful and swallowed. "I wouldn't have guessed," he said, his voice practically singed with sarcasm. He was quiet for a moment as he watched Potter consult the potions book and then add a few dried lavender petals to the cauldron. "I think we should explore the city tomorrow. Look for anything magical. Maybe some wizarding shops are hidden down some alleys. We saw that market on the way in. We could start there and find some local wizards to ask for any information."
"It's different for you," Malfoy said, looking directly at him now. "People like you. You naturally draw people in. People don't leave you on purpose, Potter."
Malfoy was frowning, but he gave a small nod. "We have to get it over with one way or another."
Potter's eyes darkened in challenge. "Then quit being an idiot. You said nothing can happen between us. Why?"
The large silver double doors were easily twice Draco's height. Neither bore a handle or knob of any kind. Twin silver cobra heads with emeralds for eyes and long forked tongues protruding from their mouths were mounted on the doors just a bit higher than eye level. As Potter stopped beside him, both snakes opened their mouths wider and began to speak:
Draco pushed himself out from under the pair, careful not to hit his arm on the stone floor as he did so. He looked back at them. Potter was holding what he recognized instantly as the sword of Gryffindor, rubies glinting menacingly in the green firelight.
Harry had not replied to this letter either, but he also didn't burn it. By now, he was well aware that his doing so was what triggered the mark. He didn't understand it. It made no sense. But, he had a vague idea that if Malfoy had the same mark and the animals were fighting more due to Harry's avoidance of him, somehow they were connected. Somehow, Harry was the Gryffindor lion, and Malfoy was the Slytherin serpent. And he did not like the implications of what that might mean.
Silence. And then the unmistakable creak of the other bed as Potter got up. Good, maybe Potter would get breakfast started while he spent a few more moments in bed fuming over how unfair it was that the founder he admired was being a dick.
The door opened to reveal Draco Malfoy. He had not changed much in the two years since the Battle of Hogwarts, which was the last time Harry had seen him. True, his face looked a little thinner, more drawn. But Harry knew that was the effect of grief. He himself had grown thinner in the time after the battle, having lost a multitude of great friends that night. It was no surprise that Malfoy would look similarly thin after the passing of both his parents that night as well.
Susan raised an eyebrow. "Making this mark change so the animals show you two getting along is in your best interest. The more you work together and trust each other, the better your chances of surviving this prophecy become. But, clearly, you don't believe me. So..." She took out her wand, and before either of them could react, she had waved it, pointing to each of them in turn.
. He wasn't helping with Draco's resolution to squash and bury his feelings. On the contrary, he was beginning to wonder if Potter wasn't totally as oblivious as he had thought him to be in school. Men did not just hold another man's hand like that. At least, not in his experience. They didn't feel his grip tighten in fear at more turbulence and begin to stroke their thumb across the back of his hand to calm him. That was...something different. Had Draco been so transparent with the whole zipper fiasco that Potter had put the pieces together?
Harry swallowed and took a few steps back from Malfoy and the dais. He turned so his back was to the other man. "Tell me when you want me to start."
It was a knife that Malfoy had produced from another pocket. Harry stepped back in alarm, his fingers itching to reach for his wand. But, he watched in amazement as the man drew the blade across his palm. Bright drops of crimson blood pooled in his hand, and he tipped it to spill a few drops on the map, in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
"Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin could not have been lovers," McGonagall finally said after silently listening to the whole story. "It would have been documented!"
Malfoy straightened and looked murderous. "What do you mean it changes?"
"I would want to suck every last drop from you," Potter said, and now Draco could hear a husky breathiness to the man's tone. Was he becoming aroused too? Was Potter, right then and there, nursing an erection for him? "Then, I would bend you over, spread you wide..."
Harry stepped over to him where Dumbledore's portrait was hung at almost eye level since his portrait was the most recent. "What do you think about all of this?"
After making sure he had everything he thought he needed, he locked the door and left the castle. His stomach was churning with a strange mixture of dread and excitement as he walked back into Hogsmeade. He hadn't thought himself capable of the latter emotion in this situation considering how he had reacted to the news of the prophecy the previous night. But, he had spent much of his adolescence always working toward a goal of some type: protecting the Stone, stopping the Heir of Slytherin, conquering Dementors, completing the Triwizard Tournament tasks, leading the DA, hunting horcruxes, defeating Voldemort. There had always been something for him to do, another step laid out for him to take. And when the war had ended, yes, he had had the tasks of talking to reporters, supporting his friends in the recovery, and learning how to be a professor. But now, two short years later, everything felt like routine, and if he was being honest, a bit purposeless. Without Voldemort and Death Eaters to fight, everything seemed mundane. Not that he was complaining! But...this new prophecy...a clear path laid out. It would be a lie to say it didn't feel good to have a purpose again. And yes, he realized he could die during this journey too. But, surely, it was not possible for this path to be any more dangerous than the one that had led to horcruxes and a final battle with Voldemort, could it?
Susan shook her head. "I'll give them the rundown by myself. You guys have time to eat."
It raised the staff to strike, and, seeing the gash briefly unguarded, Draco made a jab at its heart. But several things happened at once. The dagger met the gash at the wrong angle and deflected off the gemstones. The staff came crashing down on Draco's wand arm, and Draco both heard and felt a sickening snap. He sank to his knees, cradling his broken arm, and the dagger fell from his hand, clattering to a halt between the statue's feet as the staff was raised again.
And then Draco understood the rest of the serpent's instructions.
Harry didn't really care that Malfoy took the window seat. What bothered him was that the man looked about as fidgety as when Moody had turned him into a ferret. He knew from overhearing conversations between his aunt and uncle that planes made plenty of people nervous. Some even fainted or vomited. He was praying that Malfoy would not turn out to be one of those people.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and sighed again before moving over to Harry's bed and sitting down at the opposite end so they were facing each other. "I just started thinking about how you wouldn't have ever done any of that stuff in the tomb if the test hadn't made you. Or...if I hadn't made you. It feels...I feel dirty and kind of sick thinking that I forced you to touch me like that."
He and Malfoy stopped to purchase some lamb kebabs from a woman's street cart, both famished from wandering the city's bustling market that morning. Neither of them had seen anything to indicate wizards nearby. Once, Harry had seen a brass teapot vanish from a merchant's table while the man had his back turned, but the boy was gone before Harry could determine if it had been magic or simple sleight of hand.
Derek nodded and left them to enter the pub.
"No, just listen," Potter said. "I argued with Dumbledore about how the prophecy meant I had to kill Voldemort. But, it didn't mean that. It
Any reply Draco might have given died in his throat as Potter chose then to run a single fingertip along the vein on the underside of his cock. It was just one stroke before Potter returned to the regular rhythm, but Draco felt like he was vibrating.
He reached the end of the current essay in front of him and marked it with an 'E' before setting it aside on the small stack of graded papers. The stack of ungraded ones from all his other classes was already threatening to spill onto the floor if he breathed wrong. But, there was nowhere else to put them. The rest of his desk space was taken up by books and letters and other random items he had found necessary to have on-hand. The drawers were no better, stuffed as they were with products from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, spare quills, photographs, and
"We'd be seen flying that far," Potter said. As if Draco hadn't already thought of that. "And we can't only travel at night."
happy about it. He turned his head as he yawned into his hand again. When he turned back to Susan, she was taking out her wand.
"That's the way I see it," Malfoy said. He crossed his arms over his chest. "So, they have to be brought back together. We're essentially matchmakers, trying to get them to make up."
"This is a nightmare," Draco groaned and dropped his face into his hands. "It's impossible."
"By gluing us together?"
Though he knew Potter would be out for several hours, possibly till dawn at least, Draco packed quickly. When he had gathered everything, he wrote a note and laid it on the nightstand beside Potter's bed. He leaned over and gingerly took the man's glasses off his face. He imagined sleeping with glasses on would probably be painful. He laid the glasses atop the note.
"Yeah. They're perfectly fine. People use them all the time."
mean that if I
Potter uncorked the tiny bottle and picked up the knife. Staring at his hand as he made a small but deep incision, he said, "That's why you didn't flinch when you cut yourself last night."
Slytherin drew himself up straighter. "Do not pretend to understand the reasoning of the actions of others. Pride makes people do things they later wish they hadn't. And impending death puts many things in perspective, makes old grudges seem childish. But, you will notice that Godric had his own chances to come after me to reconcile, and he never did. He is just as much at fault for our separation in death."
At first, Malfoy flushed and stared at him open-mouthed. And then he abruptly began to laugh, and Harry was glad to see some of the tension leave the man's face.
Malfoy looked over his shoulder and rolled his eyes. "Merlin's beard, Potter, look for yourself." He motioned up the street. The bikes had stopped outside a pub, and all the riders were clambering off their bikes.
And Malfoy would never know.
The plan forming in his mind was a bad one, if not incredibly stupid and rash. But, he needed time away, time to think without Potter around. Maybe, if he could put some distance between him and the man for a bit, he would be able to consider things with a clearer head and realize his feelings for Potter weren't really worth exploring further.
Harry rolled his eyes and pushed his backpack farther into the overhead compartment before holding out a hand for Malfoy's messenger bag. Despite both bags having Undetectable Extension Charms on them, they had gotten through security easily and much faster than some of the other passengers. Of course, this was due to Malfoy's quick thinking for a Confundus Charm on the guards. It didn't take a genius to know that a guard pulling out a broomstick and cauldron from a small bag would have been cause for alarm and almost certainly some memory charms.
Just then, a hand closed around his and tugged him along through the throng of people. It was Malfoy, and he had a vice grip on his hand as he tore through the crowd. Harry was sure several people were shoved out of their way with a more tame version of a Hurling Hex.
It didn't take them long to get out the map and vial of their mixed blood and pour a few drops onto the parchment. Their blood did not move as far south as Brazil, but instead colored in the lower portion of Mexico, stretching from where it touched the Pacific Ocean just above Guatemala, along that shared border, and ending at the tip of the Yucatan Peninsula where it jutted into the Gulf of Mexico. The whole colored in area was about the size of Draco's thumb.
"I think he'll find this a little more important than lunch," the man called Derek said, crossing his arms over his chest.
"Yes, I gathered that much," Harry said, his voice tight and waspish. He had just stated they would die himself. He didn't need it repeated. "Ok, let's say that we did this, go looking for their final resting places. I thought Gryffindor was buried in Godric's Hollow."
"And you." Draco was startled out of his thoughts by Susan addressing him suddenly. "I know what you did after the war. Donating all that money to help families recover from the war."
the silver cobra hissed.
Susan frowned, looking as if she might have spoken in confidence without thinking of reasons to back it up first. But, she didn't take long to answer his question. "Because it was our generation who defeated Voldemort." She looked at Potter. "You beat Voldemort, which many thought to be impossible. You figured out his secrets, followed clues left behind, and destroyed him and his horcruxes."
Draco sighed and pulled himself away from the railing. He closed the balcony door behind him, effectively dulling the voice outside. While entertaining and a bit educational, the voice was honestly a bit too loud for Draco to hear Potter very well otherwise.
He closed his eyes, steeling himself against these emotions. He couldn't, wouldn't have them distract him from the task at hand. Besides, it was pointless to linger on such feelings. Even if he was open to the possibility of letting someone into his life in that way, it wouldn't be Potter. Potter hated him.
The pair turned away from the tourist monuments of Giza to begin walking in the direction of a wide open expanse of desert. It wasn't but five minutes later when the air around them shimmered, and Draco felt it squeeze his chest as if he were Apparating. There was a flash of light and the pressure vanished.
This was true, and Harry looked back down at the small vial in his hands to avoid looking at him. "So, you heard it, and the mark appeared, but how did you know it involved me?"
Narcissa's memory swirled in the pensieve for a moment. Then, a slender ghostly figure made of white smoky memory rose out of the basin to stand on the watery surface. Harry did not recognize the woman, but the tone in which she spoke and the wideness of her eyes told him she was in a trance as he had seen Trelawney do once. The seer spoke in a rasp:
"What are you looking for?!" Malfoy yelled, and this time, Harry heard the fear there. The statue was getting closer, and the banshee's screams were enough to keep anyone paralyzed.
"I will...consider it."
Draco smacked his arm. "Get out!"
Potter nodded, and his grin faded. "That's...actually why I think I still dream about his death."
"I didn't leave anything necessary inside the tent. I say we just leave it right now." He drew his wand, and Potter followed suit. Then he stepped over the threshold of the pyramid.
The statue was an ornately carved figure with the body of a man and the head of an ibis. It held a long, regal-looking staff in one hand. Over where the figure's heart would have been was a gash that looked like it was encrusted with crystals of varying shades of green. In front of the statue, at chest height, floated a dagger. The blade was a finely sharpened and polished emerald.
"Wait," Draco said, and his eyes went wide as he watched Susan putting her wand away. "What?!"
Harry raised an eyebrow. "You have to make it to Paris, and I'm the best you've got. Take it or leave it." He removed his hand from Malfoy's, though his arm was still in the blond's grip, and sat back in his seat to survey the Muggles in the cabin again.
Luckily, they were only half way back to the Sphinx when a canary yellow motorbike came roaring out to meet them.
It didn't take them long to find their way back out of the pyramid and to their tent. As soon as the doors of the pyramid closed behind them, it vanished. The landscape around them shimmered, and the Sphinx and the edge of Cairo reappeared in the distance. Though they had walked what felt like hours through the desert initially, it seemed they were only a mile or so away from the Sphinx.
"Oh, don't be so dramatic," he hissed at it and shoved his sleeve back down. "It's only for a few days. I'm not giving up on the prophecy." He adjusted his bag on his shoulder and headed down the steps.
Draco reluctantly nodded his assent. He had never worn Muggle clothes in his life and had wished to keep it that way. "One hour, Potter."
Draco was shaking by now, and his hand was making such uneven movements that it was hard to get a good rhythm going. "Potter," he said, and he thought he had maybe snapped the word in his current state. "Come here. If you really want all that, come here and do this for me."
The statue was completely unfazed. It didn't turn or look in Potter's direction at all. It's hollow eyes never left Draco's face. Even when Potter jumped in front of it again to slash at its head, it didn't acknowledge him.
"I know," she answered tersely. "But I still need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher in your absence."
"Why?" Draco pressed his nose in against Potter's neck, forcing himself to take deep breaths. Even amidst all the anxiety and racing thoughts, he formed a solid good one, which was that Potter's scent was comforting.
"So, basically, we need to take a month's worth of food with us," Draco said, "and hope that that's enough time for us to figure out how to draw the pyramid out of hiding."
Harry walked over to him to peer at the document. It was a world map, and in the northern United Kingdom was a dried dot of blood labeled as Harry Potter. Harry leaned closer to inspect it but withdrew quickly as a flash of silver caught in the corner of his eye. "What are you-"
"Ironic, isn't it?" Potter said, smiling.
"Yes," Potter said. "We need to talk about these secrets Slytherin wants us to reveal."
Potter wrapped his arms around Draco's waist and rested his chin on his shoulder. "You want me to do it for you?" he purred in his ear. He stroked his fingertips over Draco's lower abdomen.
Draco felt entirely shoved aside, but what she was saying wasn't untrue. Potter had defeated the greatest dark wizard in the last century, maybe the last millennium. But what had Draco done? Helped Voldemort and his supporters. It had been against his will, but he had helped Voldemort's side.
"Because...because, well, for one, you're straight!" Draco said.
"Your mother's?" Harry asked, deciding to ignore the obvious problem of the prophecy right then.
As soon as he stepped out into the hall and shut the door of the room behind him, pain flared up near his elbow. He growled, pulling back his sleeve to see the prophecy's mark changing. The serpent had now turned its back to the lion.
Potter hesitated, and for a moment, Draco wasn't sure why. But then he noticed the man wasn't looking at the vial or the knife but rather at Draco's left wrist. As he had pushed the items across the table, his sleeve had slid up to reveal a collection of straight white lines crisscrossing over the veins of his inner wrist.
Susan came back a few minutes later, and Draco was glad to see the other bikers headed toward a set of steps leading underground. He didn't want to deal with more people and more overwhelming information just then.
The serpent opened its mouth and flicked its tongue.
"We already talked enough in the tomb."
Harry scowled and released his right wrist, which had no scars. He pulled the marked left one closer though and closed both hands around Malfoy's wrist. "Do not," he said, staring purposefully into Malfoy's eyes now, "ever,
Draco's face pinched at this statement, but after a moment, he sighed and nodded. "I suppose you're right. But, if you so much as open your eyes a millimeter while I'm changing-"
Up yet another obsidian staircase, another archway and snake head awaited.
Draco felt it too and looked down at his arm, which was suddenly warm. The mark was changing. As they both watched, the lion and serpent relaxed and bent their heads together so their foreheads touched.
"Alright, whatever." Potter turned onto his back. "You don't have to be scared of this. I'm not going to attack you or anything while you sleep."
Harry shook his head. "Ingredients for them, but not brewed. I can make you something when we get to Paris before the next flight, but...what?"
Draco sighed. "I guess we just keep walking until something happens then?"
"So, we have to think like Slytherin," Potter said dryly. "Last time I found a hidden place of his, it wasn't exactly welcoming or easy to find."
Draco scrubbed a hand over his face and turned away from them, moving instead to pick out clothes for the day. Potter hadn't even given him time to change out of his pajamas before letting Susan into the room.
Malfoy withdrew a vial from an inner pocket of his robes, and it took Harry a moment to realize what the man was showing him. It was a small vial with a wisp of silver coiled in the bottom.
"I don't know," Harry answered truthfully, staring right back at him. "Trying to help?"
"Close your eyes," Malfoy said. He wasn't blushing this time, but rather his expression was taut and closed.
They were both silent, hands over their ears, and watched as the Anubis figure looked slowly from side to side. He scanned the room and then approached the banshee. With one strike of the flail, the banshee exploded into a blast of wind. Then she was gone, and the statue slunk back to its alcove, which turned back to solid stone, leaving the chamber empty.
Harry thought back to when he, Ron, and Hermione had broken into Gringotts to find another horcrux hidden in the Lestrange vault. All of the treasure had duplicated when they touched it since they were not the rightful owners. Now, Harry could picture Malfoy standing in front of the vault, opening it, and being buried in a deluge of treasure. It was enough to make the corner of his mouth twitch in amusement.
"Even so," Draco said, "we still don't know where the pyramid is. You said Hufflepuff didn't even know, so that means you guys don't either."
He could almost sense Potter's scowl, but he still didn't look up.
Draco gave a slight nod and released Potter's shirt finally. He lowered his hands to his side and stepped back so there was a few inches between them. "Partially."
Draco was grateful that the illusion spell of the desert had caused them to only think they had traveled for countless miles. With the Sphinx only a mile away, that meant they could be back in the city within an hour. He wished more than ever that he could Apparate again now though, because traveling in awkward silence with Potter when he was weighing the possibility of starting a romantic relationship with the man was making him jittery.
"You're not trying on underwear," Potter pointed out. He raised an eyebrow. "Unless you're saying you go commando, in which case that's far too much information."
Finally, the sun touched the horizon, and they decided to set up the tent for the night. Potter put up the tent with a few waves of his wand and started a fire to cook dinner. As he did so, the surrounding temperature began to drop, and some of the dense heat that had built up in Draco's limbs started to ease.
The unanimous hissing voices sent a shiver down Draco's spine, which was only made more severe as both snakes bent their heads to stare cold emerald gazes into his soul.
But that didn't change the fact that having Potter fall on top of him, one of Potter's knees between his legs and their hips and chests pressing together, those green eyes staring into his with their mouths almost touching...all those feelings had come rushing back like a torrent burst from a dam. And he hated it. Those feelings would not win. They couldn't, not with their lives at stake with the prophecy and the fact that Potter would mock him endlessly if he ever found out Draco had had and maybe still did have feelings for him.
Malfoy made about stuffing his day clothes into his bag for what seemed longer than necessary. He was obviously stalling, and when Harry cleared his throat pointedly, he sighed, slumping his shoulders a bit as he turned to frown at Harry. "There's no chance you'll let the conversation about the third challenge drop?"
To his relief, Potter didn't respond. He only set the knife aside and then angled his hand over the bottle to let his blood run into it. Once it was nearly full, he withdrew his hand and wrapped it in a handkerchief.
"And if that doesn't work," Draco continued, "we'll just have to go around to the known tombs and see if we can find any clues that we can connect to Slytherin. See if there's anything that could have inspired him."
Eventually, Harry drifted off to sleep. The sun from their hours of walking had drained him of his energy, so what could have been a sleepless night of agonizing 'what if' wondering was mercifully taken from him.
"Traveling in a tube with wings," Malfoy was muttering as he looked out the window. Harry sat beside him, and the blond squirmed in the small seat as Harry's elbow knocked against his. "I don't like this. Like being trapped in Devil's Snare with how much room they give you."
Potter just frowned, and Draco bristled even more as he stared at him, the man's gaze raking his face. "Whatever," Potter said, obviously unconvinced by this excuse.
Harry grinned and gave a soft laugh. "Yeah, maybe he will. But, I can die with the memory of you wanking off in a tomb."
"Yeah," Harry said vaguely, his voice lacking the conviction of a decision. Was he ok? He thought so, but it had been a while since he had had nightmares like that, that vivid.
Draco should have felt relieved at this explanation, but instead he felt disappointed. Why on earth was he disappointed?! Had there been the smallest sliver of him holding out hope that Potter actually liked men and had done all those things out of some type of feelings for him? The idea was ludicrous, of course, but that didn't change what Draco was feeling.
