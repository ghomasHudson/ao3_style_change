“Well come sit down to breakfast and you’ll see!” He teased and the Slytherin looked very put out—only for it to be replaced in a split second by eagerness and curiosity oozing from his every pore.
If he wanted to be a better friend and mean it, it wasn’t going to be a conversation they had. If he wanted to apologize it would have to be through his actions showing that he was sorry, and from here on out just being
“I was more referencing your conversation in the alley this afternoon,” His mother cut back in pointedly, and Draco felt his ears get hot as something that should’ve been obvious hit him.
less aggressive and flashy than what the most Slytherin-like Gryffindor at Hogwarts had managed to come up with, and he hoped someday it’d work without anyone but
Harry grinned. "Hey. I chose you as a friend and rejected one Ron Weasley. That's already going well for you, right? Have a
A lot had happened, and his mind was buzzing. As the several very important things of equal criticality he’d learned of today were just too much for him right now, his mind settled on one of the quieter, less important things he’d noticed after his conversation about Ancient and Noble houses as he sat at his desk and tiredly brought out a piece of parchment and a quill.
things like that, much less at the rouge Gryffindor who sometimes sat at their table, so it was kind of frightening actually.
primed to try and outmaneuver or work against them like a fellow snake absolutely would try to do simply for the pride of it all, would be optimal. So… snake-like, but not actually a snake themselves.
It was a very normal Tuesday when Harry found himself walking towards the Great Hall from the library, and he immediately realized he was, for once, entirely alone. Which would be an advantageous time to corner him, and he knew this because a girl seemed to appear out of nowhere and start walking beside him, as if accompanying him towards where dinner was being served.
“Hey Susan,” He smiled blankly at her as she cornered him. “Heard you’ve been fielding questions about me—sorry about that.”
The fact Draco had become roommates and friends with one was very questionable, but he was confident enough in his parents’ training to cross that bridge when they got there.
“Neville, forgive me if this sounds a little self-absorbed… but this isn’t your fault, you know that right?” He tried to keep the concern out of his voice, laying it there matter-of-factly for his friend to hear and address as he liked.
“Because I can’t! Because I—I’m not—” he needed to pause a second to take a calming breath. “I’m not ready and I might never
“Then you’ll love this! No fuss, just pretties up the skin. Automatically glamours all types of acne and scars but it
He looked down and a severed hand rested in his, before his eyes crumbling to dust and the feeling of clammy skin turning to dry ash and coursing over his skin like liquid sand filled him with a horror and disgust so think he choked on it. It was an emotion to intense he felt his whole arm jerk as if rejecting it, and a gut-wrenching repulsion strangled him, surging up his throat like he was about to be sick.
He didn’t know for certain what the figure had wanted, but his instincts told him his death would’ve been high on its list of priorities, and Harry was not one to ignore his instincts as they hadn’t failed him yet. If that thing could kill a unicorn, a super-fast ultra-magical being of pure goodness, then a measly first year was probably easy pickings.
And privacy is what he needed, because there was no bloody way he was going to go straight back to the Dursleys and then have to act normal while he cooked and did his chores knowing this letter was sitting unopened in his cupboard. He
it was all he could do to keep his mouth shut and not immediately start asking questions about why they never actually acted different before. But it was clear they weren’t willing to talk about it today, as they’d already confessed more than just a little, so he kept his questions to himself.
Snape’s entire being was melting from sheer frustration and other emotions he couldn’t place, to the point where the fork in his hand hovering over his as-of-yet untouched breakfast was in quite a bit of danger.
Glamours would not work under the ward so she went physical with her disguise, shielding herself in a long white cloak and white robes beneath it already turning slightly grey from the grim of this place that seemed to pollute even the air around her. She had the hood pulled all the way up and a white scarf pulled up over her nose to shield most of her face—not very creative, but effective enough for this trip. It only had to last less than an hour, if that, and she picked up her pace quickly as she followed the directions she was given and memorizing every twist and turn of the hallways to ensure she knew her way back too.
"-is that a new necklace?" They both teased and complimented in the way only they had, and he grinned as he lifted his chin to show them.
First of all, he liked McGonagall quite a bit. She had taken his babbled questions and his attempts to distract her with a calm look and then spoke to him like an adult—shooting down his theories one by one with cold hard facts and even giving him resources to go look up that would support her statements. She was also not swayed by his overachieving or distraction techniques as he still had to write that extra essay but now had less class time to do it. Admitting defeat, he’d taken the assignment in addition to their actual homework and vowed to get vengeance by crafting something
Draco had one, and it was sleek white, studded artfully with accents of pure silver and the ground before it solid black-and-white marble instead of being earth for him to plant things, but he often lay there and wrote letters against the solid surface instead of speaking, as it was somehow easier to formulate his words that way—and carefully formulating his words for those conversations seemed extremely critical. He left hundreds of letters there over time, and every time he returned they were gone.
“Severus isn’t trying to kill you!” Draco insisted more emphatically this time, and Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry couldn’t really form a response to this terse conversation, so he just pulled one out of his bag and took another one as commanded. He
It was equal to, if not worse, then staring up at a troll and knowing he was going to get crushed. Than looking into Quirrell’s eyes after he’d screamed at him and knowing he was not going to be able to beat a full grown wizard no matter of clever he’d thought he was.
“Guys like you are hilarious—you need to pick on a couple first years to feel big huh?” He snarked, preparing for whatever curse was coming, needing to hold onto Draco tighter as the wrist in his hold attempted to break free for a brief second. “Give those back, jerk.”
all his energy and courage surviving a nightmare in the dark depths of this very school he loved so much and now had less than 24 hours to enjoy being here before he was going to be walking into a different sort of nightmare for the next couple months. So he did what he did so well and buried it, making a note to come back and dig it up when he was in a better place to think about such things. And maybe he would also include Draco in that mental exercise sometime but it was going to have to be his own battle first, and his friend would maybe help him deal with the aftermath when he finally got around to confronting this ugly, painful mess he was locking away for now.
As the pain abruptly stopped and he panted roughly into the stone beneath him, he realized he was probably
“Of course! Contrair Alley is full of those who utilize ‘Odd Solutions’—or really, muggle made or inspired solutions that are banned from Diagon Alley. Purebloods have the deeds to all of Diagon so if it ain’t traditional wizard-like they don’t let it be sold up there. So Diagon has the pure stuff, but if you need an Odd Solution or a bargain deal, Contrair’s where it’s at. You’re in luck you came here since there’s no regular magic solution for Potter eyes, but my Odd Solution is not only half the price of a normal fix but for a little inconvenience it’ll do the trick for your eyes.”
it wasn’t the first time he’d heard any of it, but the refresher was nice, and he wondered what the best way to keep up on it would be. Self-teaching himself math was probably
“Slytherin is where the ambitious and clever people go. Each house has characteristics so that when you’re sorted there you’re surrounded by like-minded people and such. Ravenclaw is a bunch of bookworms and Hufflepuff is a bunch of duffers. And don’t even get me started on
Regroup and figure out what to do, and he wasn’t even sure he could do such a thing in one afternoon but… he needed to start.

Put even a small block on anyone else our age and we wouldn’t be able to perform a levitating charm, but you don’t have an issue.” He explained plainly, and Harry got a sinking feeling in his stomach. Hm… maybe his cover wasn’t as flawless as he thought it was—or it was creating a problem he hadn’t realized would be a problem in the first place. “Combined with your very

“If you need help…?” Draco didn’t seem to mind he wasn’t going to say it, and Harry figured it was more than common enough for snakes to hide their plans even from each other. Obviously.
“Harry!” Susan all but shoved Lu out of the way even as he opened his mouth to say something, her auburn hair flailing around him as she made an awkward, aborted attempt to hug him before realizing that was probably a bad idea. “You’re awake! We were so worried!”
Harry, being conditioned to wake at absurd hours by force and then willingly getting up even earlier than that so he could have some ‘me time’ in the day when he wasn’t forced to either be at school or doing chores for the Dursleys
“Fine, but more importantly you know what’s on the third floor!?” Blaise gave up rather quickly, sensing a loosing battle and getting back on track.
The girl seemed to deflate all at once, the boy called Neville looking about ready to sit down and cy.

The same could not be said for everyone though, and a freckly monster child chose that moment to stalk up from behind where Harry was standing to brush past them on his way to lunch.
biased I think. She rarely ever gives out points though and is strict as anything, or so my father says. Mother says it’s because transfiguration can be dangerous when you’re learning it so she takes no nonsense, but Father thinks she’s just got a stick up her bum. Which, coming from my father means more than you think it would.”
“Ya al-righ’ there ‘Arry?” Hagrid’s booming voice snapped him out of his brooding and he realized they were in a crowd of people more their height, the upper years having filtered off somewhere. The giant man beamed down at him through his wild beard, a lantern held high above their heads.
“H-Hagrid… it’s illegal to own dragons.” Neville whimpered like he was really wishing he didn’t need to point that out, eyes positively bugging out of his head at the creature in front of him as it turned and warbled in a distinctly baby-like way for a lizard at the Gryffindor when it heard him speak.
"So you do know, but refused to tell me." Harry demanded, and Draco shot him a smirk before returning to his breakfast without answering. Damn Slytherins.
Draco smirked in a small enough way that only the upper years noticed as he continued his lunch, not interfering and knowing quite well his friend could handle this situation without his help. In fact he’d probably only just make it worse, so he kept his mouth shut and enjoyed his pasta—and the show.
He was very much neglecting his friends, not to mention his homework. He ate meals with everyone and went to class as usual, but most of the time he’d usually spend hanging out in the common room, studying with others, talking to people, bothering the first years, even running around with the football club,
and then even get a parting shot in last night as they were settling down, making some comment about how it was much comfier than some ‘slimy snake dungeon’. Harry gave exactly zero quaffles about what Ron Weasley said, but he was a bit annoyed to realize his venom was
The growls seemed to echo around the corridor loudly, and the cold of this island of hell made her shiver a bit violently. She needed to get out of here—time was not on her side and as her heart beat faster she knew those calming draughts she’d taken before coming ashore were wearing off a lot faster than she’d hoped they would.
or I will murder you slowly myself for ruining my plans.” Her face twisted in a glower, pulling her scarf down to be sure he saw the full glory of her glare. Unfortunately he was just as much of a Black and had a matching death stare of his own. “I can take care of this if you for once in your life
“So someone jinxed my broom. There were dozens of teachers in the stands, Dumbledore too, and all of Gryffindor would lose the game willingly then let me fall to my death. I trust the twins with my life especially, so while yes someone did something, I was not going to get hurt from it, Draco.”
In another life he wouldn’t care about his appearance, and it would snowball into caring less about his life as a whole: rash decisions that put his well-being at risk, resigning himself to those who treated him poorly, a dangerous over-eagerness to please anyone who gave him even a slight bit of positive attention...

The elf wailed balefully, and Harry was thankful for his muggle repelling stone. “Master Harry Potters is lying sirs!” He accused. “Wizards can’ts lie to house elves!”

was coming off was a bit rude and snobby. At the surge of anger he felt threatening to break the control he’d developed over his composure, he took a breath. He remembered Hagrid mentioning about how his mother had had a temper too, and he wanted to be like her but not at the expense of his hard work to control himself and the patience he’d painstakingly built over the past couple years. He wanted to be like her, but his composure had gotten him this far in life and it’d be stupid to throw it away now just because it wasn’t the Dursleys and their predictable vitriol he was facing.

He marked the tomb with a lovely pale blue gravestone in his mind’s eye and would come back to grieve over it another day.
He was so caught up in trying to understand the first year’s rapid-fire babbling, he almost didn’t notice someone coming up behind him until he was being tapped on the shoulder and a familiar cough interrupting him. And just him, because Colin didn’t seem to notice and did in fact not stop for breath.
“In the muggle world, yes. Not in the wizarding—in fact many letters are scanned by the Ministry for security. A measure put in place during a time of crisis in the last war, and it was never revoked.”
“Dear me, Mr. Finnegan!” Flitwick yelped, but was not as surprised as he once was. This was too common a result for that.

his imaginary graveyard—this was just his mental escape when he needed to focus on calming down or prioritizing his thoughts, and somewhere he knew he should’ve started to think about what was outside of this place, but he never had before.
She lifted the paper again to re-read the equation he’d altered, putting her hand beneath her chin as she worried at her bottom lip. Every academic bone in her body wanted to go deeper into this subject that posed a question that cast into doubt everything she’d worked for in her career, but she forced herself to refrain.
Harry could not move his eyes off Draco, scared that one second will be enough for him to disappear . He did not want to see Malfoy disappear. He didn't want to one day look beside him and realise that Malfoy wasn't there sneering at him . That he couldn't hear those sweet insults anymore.
"......My good brother, your words can't hold my bladder! Let me go before the rain shower takes place right here, right now!!!"
The threat did not even faze Harry as his eyes remained the same , hard , cold and resolut . He looked right in Draco's eyes as he grabbed his forearm and pulled him . Draco's back collided with a hard chest . Harry had his right hand holding Draco's left wrist trapping his waist and his left hand on Draco's mouth . This position had entirely trapped Draco .
, was the only thought in Draco's head as a bright light enveloped him. And the next second, he disappeared. The books Draco was reading slowly rose by themselves and took their given places in the shelves, even his robes disappeared.
As he came to the bed, Draco saw something that they had miraculously ignored this entire time. His eyes widened and he called, "Potter! Come here!"
But before he could do anything, a tiny flame travelled from Harry's wand to the tip to the lamp's wick. A small but steady flame burnt.
In front , a tall skinny man with half bald head stood and with him came none other than their primary target - Dolores Umbridge.
Draco tried with all his might to forcefully stop the poison from flowing but with it the blood flow will stop as well.
With a scheming smile , the man said , " Good morning, everyone . I am your new minister of magic Pius Thickeness . And as your new minister of magic , I promise you all to restore this temple of tolerance to its former glory . Therefore, beginning today , each employee will submit themselves…. for evaluation "
" I found him unconscious in the forest . He wasn't injured. Probably collapsed due to shock after encountering a beast. I wouldn't want to take him back like this. Heard from moaning myrtle that he cries near her due to matters with his family, it seems. " Harry explained.
" Probably because of the egg by her protectiveness over it . Also did you notice the purple hue on the trees making a trail to her ?",  Harry further questioned trying to ultimately estimate Malfoy's knowledge and worth .
But the aurors remained cold and unresponsive. What a time it was. The aurors trained to protect the people were the ones delivering them to their deaths. But what choice did they have ? If refused , they'll be killed instead.
He sounded angry and frightened, Draco noticed in the haze of pain. It was then that he saw her wand turn towards Harry and as if reading her mind, he knew what she was going to do.
Harry stood aside as Draco carefully instructed the house elves about how to care for the headmaster and what medicines to give him. As he finished, Draco made his way towards Harry.
A bruise was forming on his face. Even so, he did not protest and did not cry. There weren't many people able to make him react and she wasn't one of them. She was too lowly in his eyes for his words.
Son , as you know that these days are difficult for everyone , including us . The dark clouds are drawing near and the rain is about to fall . We cannot stop the rain but I hope that you at least have a safe shelter over your head . You don't have to worry about me , I will be fine . But please make sure that you are fine as well . You are my son. If you aren't there, I won't be as well.
As the sun lowered and the sky took a saffron hue, Draco set out towards the forbidden forest, hiding and sneaking , making sure no one saw him.
Harry's thoughts drifted towards all the possible thoughts why . Had Malfoy not slept enough ? Did he have insomnia like Harry ? Nightmares maybe ? And then thinking about the possibility of Draco not trying to sleep at all and doing something else , like plotting schemes and possible murders or maybe a pleasant night with a lover , had Harry's eyes visibly darkening . But a big part of him was bothered about Draco being with another person , with a lover having a moonlit tryst .
This time Harry cracked a tired smile and replied to the teasing," No sir . As of now I have no one as such. And I doubt that will happen till unpredictable time in the future"
Still groggy and in pain, Harry shakily answered, "Yes. He is searching for something. Searching so desperately as if his life depended on it. Something that a man named Gregorwitch had but was stolen from him"
The thunks and thumps from the stall on the other side caught his attention and rin remember that I was Harry beside him. So, like a good friend he was . He happily peered into the other stall .
Draco wanted to gain more trustful people on his side and Kreacher was a particularly knowledgeable person with regards that he was constantly with Regulus Black , a known Death Eater , and that he had a part in hiding a horcrux as well stealthily the same horcrux from where it was hidden. He could be miraculously useful in one way or another. It will not hurt Draco or the elf in question if Draco could earn his trust and loyalty with such an act as simple as this one. Anyway , he had no use of the locket now . Even if he knew that Kreacher was hiding something from him , he was sure by Kreacher's reaction that it wasn't something that could harm him.
The professor continued, "Well, since you liked it so much, how can I disappoint you by not letting you experience another of such a curse?" A face gleamed with malicious intentions.
" Thank you for helping us. I will be forever grateful to you for this, young fellow. " The soul said as he tended to Draco.
" Where is it now ? Did someone take it ?" Came Harry's voice as his wand still pointed towards Kreacher inched further forward.
Harry sat on the bed beside Draco and looked at his figure lying there as if a salted fish wringed dry of it's blood. They had walked for an entire evening before finally renting this room at the same inn they had dinner at. It was actually a light dinner meant to ease the stomach but not uncomfort the body.
But stopped short when he caught the sight of a newspaper laying on the dirty floor beneath . At once he jolted up to pick up the newspaper. Roughly dusting it , he said with wide eyes , " This is it ! Look ! It's her !"
Draco thought sitting in a cloud in the expanse of blue skies, happily floating. Looking down he saw that there was nothing here. So he again lay down to look at the sky above.
Harry didn't answer and stayed in the same place. Draco turned his gaze towards Theodore , indicating with his eyes . Getting the signal, he immediately nodded and went to Ron carefully lifting his legs to set his knees straight and cast a spell for quick healing. As soon as the wand tip met his knee , Ron sharply wailed as Blaise and Neville held his limbs tightly to stop the thrashing. His voice carrying clear agony. Hermione sat beside him , trying to soothe some pain as Pansy silently supported her.
Harry suppressed the laugh bubbling out of him as he struggled to keep a cold face. He was successful in doing so but Dumbledore still saw the humour in his eyes even though his face was unexpressive. Stopping, Dumbledore sighed with a fond look in his gaze as he looked at Harry ," My boy, you have grown so much. You were the height of my waist when you first came to Hogward's. It's been such a long time already. You are almost as tall as me now. And soon the chick will leave the nest and fly away high. So high that I won't be able to even look at you"
Her voice was doubtful and inquiring. Pansy sensed the disbelief and distrust in it and said scathingly, angry and sneering, " Potter told me as well as asked me to accompany you after I leave my house"
Harry was silently observing Draco as he squirmed and sweated beneath his eyes. It wasn't that he was intentionally doing this, but a chance to freely stare at Draco without disturbances and questions was rare . Harry wasn't just going to let it slip.
" Poor boy, let him rest here as long as needed " Hagrid said with a sympathetic hum as Professor Slughorn gave Draco a pitiful glance .
" What ? What are you talking about ?" , Blaise said as his face controted into childlike innocence.
As if struck by thunder, Blaise was stumped. He hurriedly started to wipe the tears and asked, " Merlin ! W-what did i do? Why are you crying, Longbottom?"
Looking around , Draco was surprised to see the thick canopy of trees and plants . He did not even notice walking into the forbidden forest . By the size of tree trunks they were deep into the forest , possibly right at the center of it . But this was not what caught his attention , it was the slight purple hue on the tree trunks and the leaves of plants that intrigued him . These species of plants are not supposed to develop any kind of hues . Curious , he tries to move forward but was immediately tugged back , entirely plastered against the one and only Harry Potter . Right now he felt like the bread dough made by , Jack , a house elf back at the Malfoy manor . When he made bread , he would tug , turn and sqaush the dough harshly every time as if it was his worst enemy there instead of a dough . He felt the same being manhandled by Potter . But he did not protest and stayed still as Harry cautiously tugged him forwards towards a clearing .
And then quickly made her way to the woods with legs tightly squeezed together. With her thighs stuck together tightly, she couldn't even take a step wider than 10cm. And truthfully, in her condition, taking a step wider than 5cm didn't seem safe in any way or form. Her face contorted an expression conveying  something akin to pain and desperation.
Harry revoked his first memory of Malfoy. He had been so different from others, as if his whole being was ablaze with a cold flame. He could see that freezing fire reflect in his eyes. But he grew to be such an evil monster that he deserved to be punished. He deserved to suffer worse than he had made others feel all those years. But he was always above Harry, always far from his grasp, always running away. So Harry did what he had to do, he planned and laid traps. He made himself powerful enough that no one would be able to stop him from doing what he wanted. So that no one could stop him from harming Draco.
Madam Pomfrey walked to him with a brand new uniform and with her eyes checking for any discomfort on his body and said, "You are already healed and can attend your classes, Mr. Malfoy. But remember to not tire yourself and take care of your health. In addition, take this once a day before sleep to regain the lost energy."
Now both of Harry's eyebrows were raised high, "I didn't know that purebloods were schooled in nagging as well "
Silently walking through the wide corridor , Harry had an inkling that something was coming . Which proved correct as the next moment Snape made his way across them . He hurriedly pulled Malfoy behind a statue as he vigilantly eyed Snape's moments .
For the time being, Draco sat down and surveyed his surroundings. How did he get here? He remembered clearly that he was pushed down the tower together with the headmaster. He had not even realised what had happened when he was suddenly flung forwards and was rapidly falling down. Just before they were about to hit the ground, they somehow aparated here. Did the headmaster do it ? Or was it someone else helping them ?
Back the black manor, Draco sat down as Harry left with Ron and the others. Theo sat beside him , looking at him with hesitation like he wanted to say something but wasn't brave enough.
Neville's fiery gaze aimed sharp arrows at the slytherin in front, "Zabini ! Aren't you already enough of a scum?! Do I look stupid enough for you to lie such a shameless lie?! "
In Harry's eyes, Draco looked like a blooming flower in the midst of cold morning fog. The tears on his cheeks were as if the nectared dew drops on pink petals.
Neville's eyes snapped to face him and with a strange but seething tone, said, "Well, I would hate it if your precious attention was spent on a toy like me rather than your several paramours."
Sitting beside Umbridge were Hermoine and Pansy , flanking both the sides. Hermione looked at him worriedly , fearing for the next outcome and somewhere for the woman's life.
Are you satisfied with the progress of the story and writing? Did you get the very subtle Luar/Eloise? I was planning to have them so but do you think it will be too much gay?
Draco looked on as Harry carefully climbed the rickety stairs before disappearing from his sight. His gaze slowly turned and inspected the messy abode. As he roamed around, Draco came across a dusty book kept on a tabletop. The book's cover clearly stated-
Draco sat beside Ron as his blue magic worked to completely heal the wound on Ron's shoulder. To his side sat Harry and Hermione while Pansy and Theo waited outside of the tent. He didn't hide his healing magic. He and Harry had clearly told them early on their abilities but refrained to explain in detail. While all of them were curious and earger to know, Harry had squashed all their inent with his stone cold and emotionless " No questions "
Hermione was first to speak, " Everything happened as planned . Now, a atmosphere of fear and terror is in the school as well as everyone positively believes that Draco and Headmaster are dead "
Blaise, who was utterly shocked at the display of such rare rage, looked at the stumbling boy. His brain was stuck but instincts weren't. He quickly pulled Neville back on the bed and tightly held him as he tried to struggle away.
" What does this have to do with removing the dark mark ?" ; Losing his temper , Draco hissed angrily . If not for his roommates sleeping just beyond the covers , he would have shouted it out .
Neville looked up at Blaise and said with a choking voice, "I am not a toy! I don't want to be your toy! I don't like how everyone looks at me! I don't like how they give me disgusted and pitying glances! It feels disgusting! I hate it!"
It was a stunning picture. Draco with his pale cheeks resting in Harry's palms, his pale fingers splayed over Harry's much darker, larger and rugged hands. So precious. So precious that Harry wanted to pick him up, lock him in an unbreakable glass box and carry him everywhere. Showing him off to everyone but letting no one even think of touching him.
Blaise didn't know what to say. He was the one who started this. His original intention was to portray Neville as someone under his protection. Like this, students and professors will both hesitate to harm him because behind him stood Blaise Zabini, a pureblood heir of a powerful slytherin family and the most probable of the younger generation to enter the ranks of death eaters and ascend to a high position now, that Draco Malfoy was supposedly dead.
Hearing Luar's voice in his head , Draco calmed down slightly as Harry said into his ear ," Don't move and take a look around . Don't be stupid enough to invite your own doom "
Seeing Draco's gaze stop , Luar asked ," Do you like this ? I have to say this will definitely look good on you . It's not too gaudy and can be used daily . Do you choose this one ?"
But her chest was so heavy and tight that nothing other than desperate and shallow breaths. The sound of painful and torturous wheezing rang in the desolated midst of trees and rocks.
And this sight of obvious sparks flying at once made the unprecedented ability of imagination in Hogwarts students awaken and take up the task. And knowing the grand ability of these students, the results are sure going to be top notch.
For a second, no one spoke. Two pairs of eyes blankly stared at each other. It looked oddly romantic and stupid at the same time.
Draco gave a tired sigh and walked towards them, silently flicked his wand to levitate Theo gently. He gave Pansy a firm look to follow as well. Leading them to the second tent, he carefully lowered Theo in a comfortable position. Pansy laid down beside the boy as well. Her arm softly stroking Theo's hair again.
Walking towards the great hall, Draco thought over and over about what he must do and what his future held . If he stayed with the dark lord , death is the cloud floating above him at every moment . He is like an animal trapped in a cage like a pet, having comfort but not having control over his own life and death . If he chose to side with the light , then sacrifice is the price paid. Both of these will take everything he has . So he has to take the only option left.
Draco rubbed his eyes furiously wishing to destroy all the traces of the weakness he exhibited moments ago.
Draco's eyes widened as he looked at him . Then thinking how his own father was , it wasn't wrong thinking that he had never received even a touch of fraternal love .
Looking up , he imagined his late , blond , stiff but awesome-when-she-scared-father grandmother and prayed ,
Seeing this , Harry finally opened his clogged throat and said in a rough voice ," Yes , let's go home , mom . I missed you guys "
Informing others, Everyone split into groups of three and started searching and calling out her name in the surrounding area.
" Okay . Okay " ,Ron said , before taking hesitant and unnoticeable shivering steps towards the sound of rain.
As he called , Dobby and Kreacher suddenly popped up. Dobby's crimson blood flowing down his chest as Kreacher supported him.
After saying this , Luar  took Draco to one of the glass shelves kept against the pillars . Inside the shelf were many small and medium men's jewellery and other accessories . All of them were elegant , refined and suited for aristocratic gentlemen like Luar and Draco . It was just then that Draco's gaze drifted over and stopped on a green-coloured , diamond and gold immured ribbon with a silver and emerald brooch on it  .
Draco's eyes glowed as he said , " The note said that the real horcrux has been stolen and will be destroyed as soon as possible. But have they really did it ?-"
Another thing Draco noticed was that  it did not distinguish between light and dark magic . It was all in there and it was all helpful . It seems people from ancient times did not differentiate between dark and light magic . It was all the same to them .
In the Gryffindor dormitory, Harry lay in his bed staring at nothing and unable to sleep. His insomnia was getting worse. He was just about to close his eyes when he caught the sight of the invisibility cloak laying on top of his desk. At once, he got up and started to think about good night walk places in the Hogward's and eventually decided on the room of requirements. Harry hid in his cloak as he made his way to the room of requirements. After entering, the room was still empty. Looks like he does not need anything. So, he just sat down and unexpectedly thought of the scowling kitty he saw this morning. Harry knows that it's weird calling Malfoy 'kitty', but it definitely suits him well.
Another chuckle escaped Harry . Truly, Slytherins are Masters at politics , at getting what they want . Masters at getting their end of the deal . These cunning , ambitious , poisonous folks. But people often forget that a snake only bites when it's scared itself , it only attacks when it has no other option left.
Draco's eyes narrowed, "Really? You aren't lying? Because I seemed to hear something that particularly makes me want to castrate Dumb Golden Boys."
As the night progressed, this heat only grew, not subsiding an inch. Harry gritted his teeth. He was at his limit now. Anymore and he'll do something really bad.
Draco slowly scanned her face , searching for something , before asking, " Did you recognise either of them ? "
Such thoughts ran amoke in his brain, feeling it up with wet pink lips and a withering warm body. Physically brushing these images aside, he diverted his attention to the worn out and totally spent boy unconscious in his embrace.
First of all, I am really sorry for being absent for so long. Hope you guys understand that life isn't alway sunshine and daisies.
So when Draco woke up , he found himself in a red and gold room with Potter sitting in the chair across, staring at his face.
- you will know for what pansy called all the six of them to  astronomy tower without Harry and Draco at midnight.
As Harry continued, Draco leaned forward to take the letter . Reading it, a frown marked his forehead .
, was the first though.  He felt his eyes slightly water at the frantic fear.  Being found out was equal to death to someone in his position.
Without wasting time, Harry ran to the origin of it to reach a cabinet. With a flick of his wand , the wooden door was slammed open and the being inside restrained tightly , unable to escape.
Harry's head tilted and he curiously asked, "Art of theatrics ? What are you talking about, Draco ?"
He thought, noticing gentle steps coming towards him. But his eyes didn't lift from the tombstone in front.
Neville had never looked away from the beautiful face and still firmly stared at Blaise, "You- you really did that? Why? I had always thought….."
Draco did not even realise what was happening when Ginny suddenly pulled out her wand and shouted ,"SECTUMSEMPRA!"
Draco quickly stuffed his purse into his pocket and ran towards the room Theo told him he had gone too. Kreacher and Dobby on his tail as well. Halfway up the stairs, he saw Theo coming down as well.
Breakfast was pleasant . As soon as they finished, Draco started getting ready and packing up while Harry went to the reception to check out of their room.
" Hah. Hah. Hah" Harry took deep breaths through his parched and bobbing throat. Trying to cool the heat spreading through his body and the mysterious intoxication muddling his brain.
Draco's voice exclaimed, " Pansy ! What have you done to her ?!"  ; But he didn't make a move to do anything, keeping completely still other than his eyes glaring at the twin boys.
Ron gave them a last smile , mouthing two words that he couldn't do himself before disappearing completely as his wand's magic sucked him in through its tip.
How is it ? Do you like it ? Honestly, this chapter isn't remotely related to the plot and does not helo with the progression of the storyline . Bu i still write it from to give you a better understanding of the characters , canon or side .
Meeting his eyes, Draco smiled softly, it was the first smile he had in two years. His voice was a mere whisper. As if a cools breeze flowing past Harry's ears, he said,"
Harry leisurely got up from the floor to get himself clean. Draco will be coming back soon , his clothes were still in this room and definitely won't spend the whole day in his sleeping robes. He could have waited for Draco to come back but why further aggrievate an already puffed up kitty ? Instead, Harry will lure the kitty out with treats and sweets.
Harry's magic surrounded the black wisp and the dark mark and pulled. Pulling at the vicious poison as smoke emerged from Draco's chest intertwined with a silver thread attached to his body.
But it felt nice to have someone worry about him and give him advice . It felt nice to be cared for . Thinking this , he fell asleep , thanking and resenting fate .
This idiot ! What did he want to do ?!? He looked less likely to get the dark mark out and more likely to die ! Would it have hurt him to just tell someone !?! But no ! He will cry . He will shout. He will fight and run away . But not open his mouth and shout - "HELP! "   What kind of stupidity was this ? Aren't Slytherins supposed to be smart and calculative ? Why is this one so utterly  dumb !?!?!
People will always think that an oasis in the middle of a desert is an illusion of the eyes and not reality. Only when they taste the sweet water will they believe that it's real. And in this condition, Draco was no different than a parched man lost in never-ending sand. To him Harry was like an oasis. When it came to him , reality, illusion and dreams became hard to distinguish.
Seating himself in one of the chairs , he waited for the main topic to reveal itself. Which came soon as Dumbledore continued," Harry, Do you remember what I asked of you? Have you gotten anything from professor Slughorn ?"
When Draco finally came down with the huge bag , Harry was standing near the door, waiting for Draco's arrival.
The smirk was the same yet the green in Harry's eyes grew darker, heavier, "Yet, the night entirely encompasses him. Without his dark night, can the moon shine with the bright day?"
Now that we are soon going to start the main arc and adventure , how are your reviews on the fic till now ?
And so was the fact. Draco did only ever cry in front of his Harry. The presence of Harry somehow made his mind and body subconsciously let out their weakness, their pettiness , their immaturity.
Draco was well aware of the impending near future. He didn't have much time to make further elaborate and foolproof plan. This was his only chance. He had to get the dark mark out.
" It seems that your people aren't too keen on this alliance . So, We will be leaving first. I am thankful for this suggestion but the deal between us will end here. Any exchange of information will be distant and mutual---"
Harry can do it easily. Just change a single word in the spell he was uttering and Draco will be his forever.
His voice was filled with worry. Death eaters were no wizards , they were demons . They won't see if it's a Slytherin or a Gryffindor , if it's a child or an adult. If they want to kill then they will kill.
On the other hand,  with the slight upturn of lips, the bright eyes and an impossibly smug face looked like when a husband who had won a fight against his wife and wore it on his face with-
Draco was ultimately worried about his IQ, fearing that any more of Potter's company can harm it drastically. He was already feeling some of the symptoms. Ahhhh….he really needs to get out of here.
Their expressions grew frantic , a mixture of anger, worry and relief. They ran forwards to encase the shocked Ron into their arms.
Stepping out of the compartment , Harry looked ahead and the scene ahead stunned him to no end . Ahead of him were the two figures which were the only ones he saw in the mirror of Irsed .
He looked up with questions in his eyes. Harry especially found this look adorable on him and truthfully answered, "You didn't eat anything tonight. So I saved something light for you"
If one thing that Draco is sure of is that the dark mark is not as simple as it seems. He saw with his own eyes how his once reasonable father gradually started to get sick in the mind.  How his craze got up to the point where he wouldn't even care if his family died for the cause of victory of Voldemort. He would happily accept that they died as martyrs. The same goes for other followers of Voldemort. They don't  care if their children lived or died . They all were already crazy , making their children more or less orphans. Only some of them still have their senses like his mother and Snape , but even they  are not completely unaffected. The longer the mark stays, the more they go crazy. Therefore, the filthy mark on his arm has to go. So that he can get my mother and the Slytherins in  Hogward's out of here because these are the last people he considers family. With these thoughts, the pair of silver eyes shone even brighter in the same silver rays with a decisiveness clear in them. Draco gently lay on his bed and pulled up the covers, silently waiting for everyone to drift into their dream worlds so that he could easily make his way to his destination.
When no one answered, Draco continued, "Warmth, Potter. Warmth of friends and family. Because the dead are cold, so they cherish warmth. That's why, in wizarding culture, the least you could do to honor the dead is lighting a lamp burning with their family's fire. So that they can feel warm again as well."
With a face scowling with disgust and anger, he stood up and loudly shouted so that each and every ear in the vicinity heard him, "Hey ! He isn't here,  losers!"
"Hmm~ Its fine", Harry said so leisurely that the old voice felt that let alone it's pride he had already lost, the remaining scarps pf pride was also gone. And now he felt like he was stripped bare and standing in plain view of this gigantic world. The feeling of cold air between its legs was particularly strong.
Hedwig relaxed and nestled on the foot of Harry's bed and Harry decided to let the bird rest before his next journey tomorrow morning .
Harry hesitantly followed her after giving Draco a silent look, telling him to stay put. This witch didn't seem normal. It was better if Draco remained as far from her as possible.
When Neville woke up, it was already night. The green colour of the sheets and the blankets brought an indescribable calm to him.
Entering the room of requirements, the first thing Harry saw was a frightened Malfoy with eyes as wide as an owls , looking at him with barely opened pink lips. He looked startlingly cute. He noticed as Draco relaxed when he saw it was Harry.
Pansy is recovering from a dangerous spell and is somewhat weak. She needs to eat healthy and fully. So Draco is personally going to make a portion for her and Theo ….and maybe a little for Harry, since he is Draco's patient as well. And he needs something to splash blood and relieve his anger anyway !
The huge doors opened to reveal Harry, dressed in expensive coats and shirts. He had come back from the cabinet meeting of ministers. Harry had gained an immortal power above the Wizarding world . He had risen to power and trapped the ministers in obeying his every word. Such a great scheme and siege he had laid. Like a crouching tiger he had been silently hiding to wait for his chance and to kill in one deadly strike. Now, he was the greatest power in the wizarding world. He had grown from the savior and the beacon of righteousness to the unspoken lord of the wizarding world, from a student at the Hogward's to the man owning the entire institution . When had he become like this? When had he become so different from the boy Draco had admired and looked up so much to ? When had he become so dark ?
Draco steadily planted one hand on Harry's chest and the other on eggie. His magic spread around encompassing the three in gentle blue-green light as it glided into their bodies.
" It's fine. Why don't you take a seat and relax yourself " Draco said while motioning to the couches behind them .
Instantly, a number of stabs were splayed across Draco's body as he flew back to collide with the headboard.
Draco's cheeks reddened. "After you fell asleep " he says. It isn't his fault that he had a body used to spells and quills and not running a marathon ! What do you expect from a pureblood like Draco whose blood had been nourished with aristocratic status and pampered with proud noblesse for centuries before his birth !
The shrill cries of Dementors , who had broken through the layer , was heard and dread set into their blood. The lift at the end of the hallway looked like a boon to them now.
So in this chapter I kinda focused on Draco and Harry as individuals and their seperate thoughts and personality since I always write about them as a duo and team.
He answered with a single word ," Horcruxes " and Draco's eyes blew impossibly wide as he jerked his head towards their Headmaster. That explained the terror in the elder's face.
Harry said this thinking that Draco is from a pureblood family and must be used to it . It is custom after all.
Harry caught the limp body with much difficulty. He himself was on the verge of fainting and almost visited the Netherworld.
" Hmmm…. You are right " Draco said. The agreement in his voice was conveyed through. A clear innocent look in his eyes as if the first snow of year. Unsullied, untainted.
Draco's tense shoulders finally sagged as he stood up and ran . Roughly colliding with the taller figure, he threw both of them falling back. Domineeringly sitting on the stomach of the infuriating liar, Draco's eyes shone hard and cold.
The foil covering the plates lifted to reveal a stack of pancakes topped with butter and maple syrup on top. Harry handed Draco one of the plates and took the other for himself.
No. it's not that it seems . Then... maybe if he sat on the seat ? With pants on or without pants ? Pants up or pants down ?
Such effects are rarely caused due to spells and curses and are mostly due to poisons and potions as well as diseases.
Alas, Even if Pansy was right. Hermione was Harry's friend and sister, not Draco's like Pansy was. This is the difference between both of them. If this relationship went wrong, the one to be trapped would be Draco, so Pansy opposed this relationship. While if this relationship didn't start, Harry will be the one who sinks into the darkness and insanity, so Hermione supported this.
After a few minutes , he drew back and lifted his head to say ," Thank you . Although it is quite weird for Malfoys to give and receive hugs ."
SNAP! - and Harry's brain short circuits. In  frantic hands, he pulled up the comforter , completely wrapping Draco in it and ran outside as if Snape was just behind chasing him. With a thud the door banged close.
Pansy sat at a distance , silently watching the enamoured look in Ron's eyes and the small smile on Hermione's face. And before she could stop herself , she stood up and walked towards the well structured back of the girl sitting in front of the piano.
Before Draco could say anymore , a peculiar sound like the clanking of utensils was heard from the kitchen beside the living room they were in .
Terse nods were seen through the room as Harry silently scanned and pried into them through their eyes, searching for the effect and importance of his words. Confirming that his words were inched deep in their bones, Harry looked at the still standing Draco and softly grazed the pale knuckles with his fingertips before gently pulling him down to sit beside him.
Beside them , Ron saw this scene as if a tapestry at Hogwards and quietly lowered his eyes. No one noticed but a watery shine glazed over them as his eyes lashes lowered , wishing to hide and conceal , wishing to forget .
With his eyes spectacularly pointing towards the other side of the room , Headmaster indicated Harry . It was so obvious that Harry gave Draco a silent look before following , as if saying
Draco was very thankful to Luar . He had only stumbled here by mistake . If it was any other , magic forbid what might have happened to him . He might not even be alive right now . Instead , he not only got a father but also gained a truckload of precious ancient treasures ! And most importantly got very valuable information on the dark mark .
Staring into Harry's eyes , Dumbledore finally backed down. Walking out , He gestured for the young men to seat themselves.
Behind him Harry's voice called, "Hey! Where are you going? I am still sick! Check me some more! What if something happened to me?! What are you going to do then ?!"
Draco was looking around when he heard the precise tapping of boots and at once he froze. His body tightening, getting ready to flee at the slightest hint of danger.
Draco did not stop and Harry did not leave. Both too lost, too in pain to even think about letting go of the only anchor present.
Looking around for sometime and finding none, Neville softly suggested, " Why don't we look around? "
" Ah. I had a brief meet with Master Luar that day in the cave. Actually, when I saved you, it was with the help of my master. If I were to be honest, Master Luar seemed to be uncomfortable around master. He seemed to be wary but still expectant. And soon after your condition stabilized, he left saying that he will be back and Master stealthily followed him. I felt that they must have a shared past but I am not completely sure"
Soon, Draco and Harry were standing in an abandoned mansion in the middle of nowhere. This mansion was originally a part of the Potter Cynn*. But was later forgotten due to its isolated location. Fortunately, this is the place they urgently needed in this situation.
Draco was startled at the voice but an unknown something did not let him panic. It was like someone had fed him a calming potion to stabilize all his emotions. Extreme fear and anger were impossible, a struggle even more so. As Draco relaxed and regained some of his rationality, he immediately started a round of rapid fire nearly enabling his captor, as he believed, from catching up.
The professor was obviously a death eater. For the past few days, he had found various ways to torture the students, making their life more of a hell that the actual one. While the Slytherin suffered less than Gryffindors, they still weren't in a good condition.
His brows scrunched as he thought . Who? Who? It was on the tip of his tongue when the image of bronze skin and evil mischievous eyes flashed in his head.
Phew !! this chapter was heavy one ! This chapter is plot point of view very important and has almost entirely the original storyline .
A tinge of pity struck in Draco's heart. Before he could stop, words were already flowing through his tongue, "It's already Christmas, huh ?"
Draco turned his head to Theo and his face grew softer along with his voice, "Theo, why don't you come sit with me? Let these two weasels do the work. You don't have to dirty your hands."
Pansy was completely unconscious and heaving desperately. Her mouth fell open to take shallow gasps and wheezes. Her face already had the unnatural tint of purple and blue due to the lack of oxygen in her blood. She was barely at the edge of either death or coma.
"How do you know I am a Malfoy ?! Did you read my memories !? " ,The speculations can be clearly heard in his voice.
Draco had a very sound understanding on his position . Right now , the thing he needed the most was knowledge . And he was snatching it from wherever possible . At this point , Draco had almost raided some of the most vast libraries in the world . The only ones remaining was the black library and the lost library of Pennsylvania , if that fairytale was real . Raiding Hogward's library , including restricted section was as easy as swallowing a dozen of his mother's vanilla pudding . Ahh !!! He could feel the saliva dripping from his mouth just by remembering the taste . Well , that luxury is for another time .
Draco wanked his hand back and gave Harry a seething glare as he walked past him as he followed Draco . Jumbled in their own emotions , none of them noticed that they were making their way right into the beast's stomach , right into the forbidden forest .
Hermione knew that Pansy lied. Harry might have told Pansy about her plan to Obliviate her parents but her friend will never ask her to accompany Hermoine. He knew full well that she wasn't that weak and spineless. Thus, it ultimately means that Pansy came here out of her own obligation.
As they say , the one who experiences heavenly tribulation is the one most fearful as well as most thankful to the Heavens .Malfoy is still wary after the ordeal with his father .
With silent endurance, Harry let Draco grab his hand and guide him to squeeze it over the egg . He watched with curiosity as the white absorbed the red complete, not even leaving a drop or a stain.
As soon as Draco realised that Luar had found the dark magic, he forcefully suppressed his own body and magic, suppressing the dark magic with it as well. This did not affect Luar as he was not dependent on Draco.
He never wished for more, only for an acknowledgement. An acknowledgement from him which he never got and never will get.
" No! The dark lord was clear that the boy is to do it " ; Bellatrix exclaimed ,halting Greywolf . At the same time , the dark figure of a youth silently watching the scene moved. His emerald eyes shone with anger and revenge, promising the gift of pain he was to deliver onto the minions of that damned lord.  He moved towards the pale young man, raising his wand and planning to strike, when the movement at the corner of his eyes stopped him.
Neville cluelessly watched as Blaise gave him a last look before leaving through the way he came in. The students around looked at Neville with a newfound pity as they thought,
A stuttering gasp echoed Hermione's fear as Ron hurriedly said from her side, " I-it was me. I-i unknowingly called his name"
He soon stepped in the lift which took him to level 2. As it stopped , Ron stepped inside , albeit wet and sloppy.
In the next tent, Draco scanned Harry's body with his magic again and again but couldn't find any reason as to why Harry was having these visions of Voldemort.
As they say , for doing something only a reason is enough but for avoiding something a thousand excuses are listed .
"Look , brat . This is a test , an exam . And an extremely difficult one at that . Many people have died inhere because they gave up in the middle of it . If you want to be a warrior , you have to go through it , have to stand in the face of death without flinching . No one knows what it actually is . It's different for everyone . And this is just the start . The future will be worse . So , I ask you for the last time . Do you still wish to do this ? "
Getting no reply , Draco continued , " Last summer when I was at the manor , I saw 7 house elves in total being tortured and killed right before me while I was unable to even object "
With hurried steps, Blaise took Neville to the medical wind, eager to know that Neville was alright.
Harry lost the last of his strength as the snake coiled around his body, choking and crushing him. His breath was slowly suffocating and his sight was turning black.
The moon was up and the whole gryffindor dormitory was asleep. Getting out of bed Neville stealthily walked towards the makeshift bed on the floor Ron was asleep on . Shaking his shoulders , he whispered, "Ron , Get up . We have to go. It's already midnight"
Harry's face held the troubled frown and deep calculating eyes, " An attempt on your life, you say ? How ?"
Draco gently shook their shoulders. Pansy got up fairly quickly but Theo , who was still in his headspace , sat up groggily.
Harry finally understood what Draco meant. He didn't want to carry out the assassination but he also didn't want to look weak so he went around in circles around the topic.
The baby's expression slowly shifted to comfortable and sleepy as she settled in Draco's familiar yet unfamiliar warmth.
Theo jerked toward Draco , " No no . It's not like that . It's just…. What should we do with the thief ? He's still tied to the chair. Do we let him go ? "
He aggrievedly frowned and again scanned Harry's body and magic, hoping to find anything, no matter how small. There must be something out of normal. How is it possible that 'it' left no clue?
For ministry officials , hesitantly stepped out of a door and onto the busy road and made the people passing by think .
Just then an oldman living in his head who had illegally hijacked his head space , finally spoke after consecutive days of complete silence .
"Tsk. Such a spoilt brat.  Fine ! I vow on the sky above, earth below, air around and magic within that what I said is as true as the blue of sky and the power of magic. If I said even a word false, may my soul tear in a thousand piece and disappear completely to punish my insolence !", The voice said echoing around.
A thud sound echoed as Harry appeared in front of a wide entrance . As he was getting up, a house elf popped beside him, professionally saying, " Master Harry , Welcome Back."
His body was bathed and rubbed with scented oils, his hair massaged with expensive products. He was dressed in another set of robes and kept on the bed again. Just like a doll , he was dressed and decorated for their master to use again.
Hermione's eyes still held the distrust but still softened considerably compared to  before, " Thank you, Parkinson "
Harry , in response to Draco's disbelief, shrugged nonchalantly. By his behaviour, it was evident that it didn't hold any importance in his eyes. Draco decided to just behave like he never knew. Afterall who would like to admit that someone else was stronger than themselves ?
The witch's eyes gleamed with an inscrutable approval, "Oh ! Truly a gentleman with sharp eyes as I had expected. A truly good item you have chosen."
Silently entering the cave , they already had their wands pointing ahead . Reaching deeper in the cave a bizarre sight made its way into their eyes .
" Yes sir. I understand. May I take my leave now ?" ; Harry asked in a neutral tone while standing up. It was evident that he did not wish to discuss this any further.
The solemnity on the faces grew. Gradually more voices rose. First Theo, Ron then Hermione and , surprisingly, Neville who was very firm in his decision.
Anyway, How was the chapter ? in this chapter, I solely focused on the tacit understanding between Harry and Draco and how they compliment each other. Also, from here the plot will start thickening. I also tried to depict more sides of Draco and Harry and their true emotions.
The lips , dry and parched , soon found a small pink fruit berry hidden under white fabric , the small mountain pressing against the cloth. The lips were so thirsty that they did not even remove the white cover cloth and bruisingly sucked right through it . As down below , a large hand roughly pressed down on the pole making the small tent . Feeling the twitching , the hand pressed harder and lips sucked more. The body under him could not take anymore . Pressed below , it couldn't even arc itself and , instead , trembled so gorgeously . Crystal tears slid down the red cheeks and a sticky wetness accumulated on Harry's hand . Just two rubs were all it took to milk this delish.
How did Potter do this ? Draco knew about this phenomenon . But using wandless magic like this was nothing more that a fairytale in this age . He was able to do it because of Luar's help . How did Potter know this ?
Draco's hands were roughly pulled by a pair of larger hands and promptly led to rest on a wide and warm chest.
Behind him stood Draco with his arms crossed and eyebrows raised with a stern look, "Didn't you tell everyone you were going to Godric's valley tomorrow morning?"
Entering the first tent to see Ron and Hermione sleeping on the hard ground, Draco quickly went to work. His magic very slowly grazed through Ron's body for several minutes before the soft blue glow dimmed.
Green eyes narrowed casting a dark shadow on his eyes , making the green more gloomy . The voice grew darker and more dangerous as well ,
After that, He didn't pay her attention  anymore as he busied himself and Pansy stopped as well knowing that he doesn't want to talk about it anymore.
So, I decided to make it a little spicy and comedy and as well as mixture  of original elements and characters. Now the story will not just be limited to Hogward's but would go all over the Europe for the search of horcruxes and on gain many advantages.
Inside a smelly room , precisely a garbage deposit room , stood the figures of Harry , Ron , Hermione and Pansy. Accidentally exposing Draco who is supposed to be dead is not an option while Theo …. is a complicated case.
People ran here and there, some falling down to be stepped on while others pushing and pulling to step on others as they made their way to safety. This scene struck a realisation in Ron and he understood that the world is never entirely black and white and no one is completely innocent.
The relationship between him , Theo , Pansy and Blaise is just like this , like siblings. They had known each other since childhood. Along the years , they didn't even know when their friendship evolved into more of a familial bond. Maybe it was because of the environment they grew up in where they only had each other to rely on or maybe it was the ostracism they faced in Hogward's as Slytherins. No matter what the cause but Draco was glad that destiny made them reach where they are today .
Harry lowered the elf on the ground and removed his restrain but still kept the wand tip pointing towards him.
No one answered. Their never nerves freezing from the cold anger directed towards them. With a scowl , Harry stood up.
It's not that Neville didn't believe Blaise this time around. Afterall, he had personally experienced the so-called illusion and was shocked by the effect. But this ability of Blaise isn't something that bothered him. Actually, he didn't even care about it. What he did care about was why Blaise did this?
The man , still thinking , failed to notice the changes in Draco's face in the span of seconds . Draco's face first flashed shock , then understanding , awe and finally pity .
As soon as the shallow whisper was heard, Draco hurried to sit beside and quickly supplied support to Harry's body.
With surprised eyes, Draco examined the pensive in Headmaster's hand as he slowly poured the smoky memory in the palette of insights . The substance seamlessly dissolved and disappeared in the clear liquid.
Desperate wails sounded from the unconscious beauty , begging for air . And the merciful lord , delighted by the honey like song , released the red lips .
" Seven " answered Harry as he attentively watched the shift of expression on Draco's face that the reply made.
" Did I do everything intentionally to get you free ? Yes. Yes , I did. Being nice or good to you wasn't something I could ever do if I wanted you to live. I could only be cruel , crueler or the cruelest. I chose to be cruel so that one of the few genuine faces I remembered from my childhood wasn't dead before my eyes. What I didn't expect was for Potter to get my task done so fast "
Draco gazed in the emerald eyes. Harry was so close. The temperature from his hand was so hot , as if boiling lava. And drowned and burned entirely.
That night, as everyone went to sleep with a passive lingering worry in their minds, Harry silently stepped out of his tent. His footsteps were tender, mindful of his sleeping companions.
His mother came forward and tenderly hugged him . Her frail arms could not even entirely wrap his shoulders as she whispered in a lovingly melody .
Ron truly looked pitiful , his eyes were lowered and lips set in a downward arc. He looked like he was about to cry any second. Ahh ! He was truly adorable ! Like an overgrown puppy !
But Pansy, being the respectable, mannered and noble lady with the biggest pride, obviously couldn't say this to his face. So , before Draco could start another instruction manual on how to p*ss when you are on the run from your murderers and are camping in the middle of the forest, shouted with desperation.
Draco tightened his hold on the pillar while resting his back on it . He looked as Luar turned into a swirling ball of light and rushed into the brooch on this new necktie as Draco was pushed back by the force and firmly planted against the pillar . When it ended , the silence prevailed again . The once kind-of-full room , now completely empty . Draco walked towards an array drawn on the ground , stood in the center and said the words he read on the shelf . With this , a bright light shone and the remaining occupant disappeared as well , leaving the room with only dirt .
" If we know that then why don't we just block them there . Or better , destroy the room ! " Suggested Hermione.
A slight smirk overtook his face and he hurriedly shortened down the stretch of his lips into a straight, small, pink line . With a quick unnoticed flick of his wand , he muttered a spell to shrink the pill into the size of a dust grain and sneakily levitated it into Harry's pumpkin juice before it came back to its original size .
Their conversation, no matter how simple and polite it looked, sent chills down the backs of the people around. Most of them thought they were initially talking about Neville being a lion in the snake pit but as more words were spoken , they got inevitably confused. But the Slytherins, who were used to such talks since infancy, and the Ravenclaws, with their sharp brains and vast knowledge, understood every well. They knew that in the whole conversation, Neville was referred with only a single word,
When all quietened down again , Harry slowly said to the boy resting on one of the couches ," Do you know why I did it ? "
With his ready wand pointing at the elder, Draco asked with suspicion, " Who else is here ? I have heard you talking. "
As Draco was getting ready for the upcoming day , an owl flew in and gently dropped a letter on his desk . Walking over, Draco realised that it was from his mother. Setting down his wand , he took the letter in his hands to read -
The egg which was eagerly happy and celebrating his nurturer's return by rolling around was abruptly pulled to fall down straight into his dear nurturer's arm. He was so happy. His nurturer felt so warm and good and his magic felt so yummy.
The sensation of a small wet paw resting on his forearm was too clear and distinguished. Draco didn't dare look down.
" Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she delivered the cursed necklace to me or like producing a bottle of mead as one laced with poison . Forgive me Draco but I cannot help but feel that these actions are so weak that you can't actually wish for it "  His demeanor was still calm as Dumbledore said it.
Determined , Draco spoke drawing the man's attention towards himself again ," respected ancestor , why don't you come with me ? Maybe the one you are waiting for is trapped somewhere and is unable to come ? You should leave this place and find him !"
Willing himself out of the enchantment, Draco answered Harry ," It's fine. When in chaos , a help to an ally is a help to oneself "
Draco felt dread creep up his brain. They were going to do something that could possibly kill them, possibly kill Harry and surely kill Dumbledore. If he really died then the fate of wizarding London is in ruins. The Dark Lord was already planning for Headmaster's death . Over that the situation of his hand was severe and he was already weak. Death can come faster than he can imagine . No ,this can't happen.
The headmaster was still unconscious but the breath was weak. His condition was getting worse by the uneven beat of his pulse. With this, he also noticed the blackened corner of his lips and unnaturally greying skin.
The curse which hit Pansy was a dark curse, designed to give a painful and abrupt death to the victim by suffocation. This curse was no less evil than the 'Avada kedabra' itself. Atleast, the book in her lap said so.
Silence fell on them like winter mist, enveloping and encompassing. As they walked, Draco spotted a brightly lit storefront. On this particular holiday, it was an odd sight for any business to be open.
Anyone seeing this scene will inevitably want to tattoo it into their memories so as to remember that the strong and powerful Lords that they will become in the future were once these young men, scared but brave, suffering but together, weak but becoming stronger with every breath.
Such dirty people ! Doing such immoral amd dirty deeds ! That too early in the morning ! And with four people together ! And by the looks and age , all of them might already be married and with kids !!
Entering the astronomy tower, Draco saw the sight of an old hunching man with their back facing him. Probably hearing his footsteps, the old figure turned around and revealed a bespectacled saintly face.
The old voice was so angry that he did not even give Harry a warning and directly threw him in the illusion of life and death. The room again fell silent as the figure that was there suddenly disappeared.
Harry only hummed quietly, not answering as both of them knew that a little neglect to eggie was inevitable in such times. Giving eggie one last caress, Draco again put him back into his ring.
So as they walked forward , the stinky eyes of people surrounding followed them all the way through . Feeling their eyes on him like creeping snakes , Ron bent sideways forgetting that he is shorter than Harry in this body and said , " Mate , why are they looking at us like that ?"
Harry was astonished at the sudden shout and froze completely. His stunned eyes looked up, clear and pure, without an inch of falsehood. It was clear that he really did not know.
Draco looked at Kreacher with screwed brows . He was curious as to what this elf wanted to ask , " Go ahead "
Fat drops of sweat dropped down his forehead. What to do? What to do ? Listen to Master Harry or Master Draco ? If obeyed Master Draco then Master Harry will surely know . But if obeyed Master Harry then Master Draco might not find out…..
When Draco woke up ,he found himself lying on the ground . The man , his ancestor , was sitting beside him , eyes closed  and hands on his chest . Draco slowly sat up and called ," Respected Ancestor ?"
He dusted his clothes while standing up, "I had thought that you atleast had a little bit of intelligence inside that donkey brain! But no! You don't even have that! Look where you got us now!"
Blaise eyes narrowed as he gave a chuckle as if the man made a joke, "How can a lion even enter the snake pit, Mr. Macnair ? It's just that a viper likes to break and poison its prey before eating it clean"
Meddling in his own filthy thoughts, he almost missed Draco's weak demand owing to his hoarse voice ," water "
Harry landed on the ground with a thump first and hastily held out his arms to catch Draco as he landed on top of Harry, his whole body protectively curled around the huge egg.
As he said this, the ones who will be out going on a journey are obvious. Draco, sensing the troubled emotions on their faces , said , " If you have any doubt , any fear , then leave now . Do not step ahead if you're not ready to sacrifice a limb or an eye "  His eyes were absolutely serious and solemn.
Harry looked at Draco and wordlessly wrapped his arms around him, strongly resisting the stunned protest he got. He kept his arms tightly wrapped around Draco .
" Too many complications . If they try a next time , then attack won't be this simple " , Draco said.
"As if the moon and the sun . Apart you are powerful forces but together you are phenomenal. Make good use of that fact , my boys "
Without even lifting his head, Harry said in a rough voice," Even I have limits. Don't try to cross them. You won't be safe, Malfoy, especially you. "
" Harry, Malfoy ! You both are finally here. Good, now we can finally start " ,Came the unmistakable voice of Hermione Granger.
The look on pansy was similar to someone who had faced too much pain and grief. It looked oddly pitiful on her tender and young face.
The sight that greeted Harry was of a pale figure laying in the wide bed in the middle of the room. The beauty was deep asleep, his chest rising and falling gently , making the image as if inviting the spectator to cuddle and sleep beside him .
Even if he hoped for it , he still wasn't sure if that was the case. He needed a last conformation before he could let go of this dread in his heart.
Draco woke up with a jerk to see it was early morning with the first rays of sun . He remembered his late grandmother telling him that dreams seen at the first rays of sun are not dream but visions . Draco felt immense dread at this .
Two men ...and two women…. stepping out of a room together ….with wobbly legs and crumpled clothes….
All of them looked as plain bands were inked on each of their wrists. It was the proof that the contract was successful and valid. The bands gleamed mellowly before disappearing as if they were never there.
" How could you ?! I am not lying ! You are the one who's lying ! You - "  When he registered his words the lips halted and horror on Neville's soft squishy face was clear. The numerous pranks and taunts reminded him that he was standing before his bully.
It was then that Luar , sensing the disturbance , woke up from his sleep and immediately knew something was wrong .
This price was very expensive considering that these were ordinary opals and let alone ordinary, even magical opals are one of the cheapest gemstones on the market. Draco's eyebrows flew up in the air, "10 galleons ? Isn't that too expensive considering these pieces of rock have nothing other than looking pretty ?"
My dear cupcakes, please leave comments and kudos. I would love to communicate and know your opinion as well assure my heart that the chapters are not terrible.
That day, after Harry and Draco had aparated back to the Potter mansion, they  sat down and had a deep discussion about what to do now. Ultimately coming to the conclusion that it was better for Harry to go back to the Dursleys and for Draco to stay at the Potter mansion. Before Harry had left , he had forcefully placed a strong barrier around the Potter mansion, dividing it from the entire world. It not only blocked the people from entering and leaving but also magic. It was like there were two worlds , one inside the barrier and another outside. No one knew what was on the other side.  In short, Harry had placed Draco in absolute isolation.
A piece of brick heavily flew over to Draco, who was helpless of his voice or magic and only able to use his body as a shield. Even then, some pieces still flew in the direction of a fragile shell-covered being as a dreadful sound echoed in his ear.
"Yes , it's a slave mark , is it not ? It can be removed but it has some conditions and  success is very rare . I cannot tell you much as it is not my area of expertise but I have books regarding it . I can give them to you ."
Looking sideways, Blaise spoke word by word, "Draco is risking his life for us in every way possible. Even right now, he is in constant danger of being killed by death eaters if anyone found what he did. The least I can do is swear my lifelong loyalty to him "
"Well, 10 galleons aren't too much. But still, I don't mind giving out a small gift to a handsome lad such as you.", The shopkeeper chuckled. "Anyway, they seem a little lonely without their family, don't they ?", She pointed at the twin opals in Draco's hand.
" Meet in the astronomy tower after midnight today " She said and everyone nodded in tacit understanding.
As the rhythmic beat in the hallway grew near , Harry's steps grew heavier. Enter the hall, he was met with the sight of a group of about 70-100 people robotically …. stapling magazines ? The way they moved was mechanical , stiff and regular , precisely in sync. They seemed like someone cursed them with a dark , forbidden curse. And maybe they did.
A month has easily gone by . In this time, Draco has been actively improving his skills and knowledge by practice and experimentation.
" I know what the situation demands of me , Potter . But what I do not know is your credibility . How do I trust you ?" ; Malfoy's voice was a mere whisper , filled with an empty void . The words brushing his ears like a frigid wind .
He remembered how Draco's single touch calmed his down some time ago. And he realised that Draco's place in his life is somewhere so high that he himself can't see it.
Gears turned in Harry's head. Time was short and they had to move fast. They needed a distraction , fast and big enough to distract every official present there. Harry's wand slipped past his sleeve to land in his hand . The people in the room quickly caught the sight of his wand .
" I have been good, sir. As good as the days let me "; Harry answered mildly . Him being with Dumbledore relaxed his guard by a bit . The fact that this man is akin to family to him is easily proven as such.
Looking at the egg and then at Harry, Draco silently reached out for Harry's hand, quickly lifting it up to his mouth for a hard bite .
Gradually, the white strands of light dimmed and disappeared. It was done. Everything related to her, her place in this world, her place in her parents' life was…. gone….
Draco did not know if it was still day or if the night had already fallen. A long time had passed when the silhouette of a man appeared far ahead . Draco was cautious yet anticipating. He desperately wanted the final confirmation that it was Potter who saved them.
Draco's head was running miles per second thinking about this when he realized that he had reached the dormitory. He swiftly made his way into his room to change his clothes and groom himself to perfection. Grabbing his books, he made his way to the Great Hall for breakfast, taking his seat at the Slytherin table beside Blaise. His head was still running in a thousand directions while he piled his plate and made the usual greetings.
Seeing the look of pure admiration directed towards him , Luar felt like he was swimming in honey.  Sweet , sweet honey ! Even sweeter that sweet - no , the sweetest Draco !!!! OHHH , His old heart couldn't bear this . He felt that with this look the possibility of a second death was not too less !!!
He was addicted to Draco as if he was a blooming red flower of poppy , bitter yet addicting , able to induce torture with a single glance as well as euphoria with a single taste.
" A natural talent cannot be identified just by looking at the face , Draco . It is something that will be known when you finally master it - if you master it . And by that time , even if you are , it's of no use . Talent can be cultivated but determination cannot . That's what you need Draco ."
Green eyes darkened further . Harry barely stopped himself for the sake of not scaring the prey away and picked himself up and about. Soon, Draco had his previous clothes on. No evidence should be left on the site of crime so that even the victim won't know that a crime happened , so that especially the victim didn't know that the crime happened.
Hearing thisz the thin hand holding the vial slowly drew inside. Draco, now satisfied, instructed, "Drink half of it and feed half of it to Dobby"
Disappointment was thick in Harry's eyes. Not just of today but of years. He silently looked to Draco and said ," Thank you , Malfoy . For healing me and my friend "
Time passed and the pain continued to mount . He could not feel his body . The pain numbed everything . Unable to hold on anymore , Draco swayed slightly .
"Wait here while I fetch something " ; Harry commanded as he made his way to the school leaving him to stand there . He was not worried about Malfoy running away . He was smart enough to understand what he should and shouldn't do. Soon retrieving the invisibility cloak , he made his way back.
It was moving towards the dark mark on his arm, Draco realised. The wisp entered the dark mark surrounding it entirely and Draco convulsed in pain. He felt as if his whole body was shredding to pieces. He could hear Luar telling him to keep steady, that it was almost done but Draco knew that there was no going back now. If they did not remove the dark mark, he would die. That was what the wisp was doing . Because they wanted to remove it , it chose to end Draco rather than let him go.
They ran , tumbling into the block one after the other. A spell flew towards the unsuspecting Hermione and Pansy who was beside her acted quickly and covered her with her entire body. " Ahhh ! " A pained shout rang out.
Harry's eyes swept across the room filled with a triad of gryffindors and a triad of slytherins. Meeting Draco's gaze , he slowly started , " All of us are well aware of the situation right now . And we reckon , after much discussion , that a mutually beneficial alliance is the best of the choice."
With a slight chuckle, Harry answered," Ah! So this is the reason for the sneaky behaviour . You don't need to worry . It isn't that Dumbledore is evil. It's just that he is naive. No matter how old and revered he looks, he is still very foolish"
Stopping in front of the tapestry , Harry opened the wide doors of the room of requirements . Leading Malfoy inside and closing the door again , they came inside to the sight of a very cosy room with a fireplace and a couch in front of it with tons of soft blankets .
Draco sneered, "I will decide what I should or shouldn't, Potter. You don't need to bother with it."
The sight of Harry's face had Draco utterly broken. It was as if a cool touch of ice was spreading through his veins , mixing with the tense muscles in his body. But then why did it feel like he had a piece of burning coal stuck in his chest ? It was burning , blazing , flaming right there at the center of his chest. It hurt …. It hurt but it felt good as well. It was so confusing, so utterly unlike Draco . It overwhelmed him like a dark cloud filled with grief , with dread , with despair that he had felt standing at the brink of murdering someone.
"Ah, that. Well, you touched one of my inscribes and teleported here through the array below it. But, unfortunately, the array is quite old and rusty, also the installment of a bigger array around the section caused it to become unstable and take a toll on your body. But do not worry, little one. I am already trying my best healing you. Though I am slower as I am a soul,  I can still heal you well."
The fleshy pointed ears of the old elf flapped as he tilted his head to the side and spat with such hatred and resentment that Harry thought killing the said man wasn't above the elf.
Draco hugged the child tighter to his chest. The small body was tiny and soft. It seemed so fragile that Draco felt that even a little force might break it. He felt as if even simple air would hurt her and only in his arms and close to his heart would she remain safe and well.
"What are you chatting there for?! You useless gryffindorks, come here and help me! And while you're at it, call Kreacher out to help as well."
The witch seemed satisfied with his answer as she slowly pointed her finger towards the side. Harry's gaze subconsciously followed to where she pointed.
Drawing the cloak to completely cover them , he looked down to see a very stiff Malfoy holding the egg in an awkward way so as to not touch Harry .
Harry and Dumbledore, both , curiously immersed their faces in the palette as Draco patiently waited.
In this air of infectious joy, the one walking beside him looked so lonely. His green eyes dulled by sorrow and longing.
Taking out the pensive and handing it to Headmaster , Harry sat back to meet the questioning gaze of a silver beauty.
His magic woved itself in Draco's body and magic as if a dark night woving itself around the moon and it's moonlight.
Like this, the conversation abruptly ended. Harry and Draco were very clear about the importance of each other . They were aware that they were in this together . So each of them were unconditionally and persistently honest and truthful, not hiding even a small useless detail from the other.
But before she could complete, a pair of hands so pale that they seemed to be made of wax , came forward . And Hermione feared. She feared that they would melt from the boiling heat of her heart.
According to the book,  Pansy should have died by now. But she didn't. Hermione was sure that the curse had hit Pansy and that she should be affected. But it seemed as if something blocked and held off the curse. Something that was inside Pansy.
'Papa' rolled off his tongue so smoothly that it did not even feel like it was his first time . Feeling pleased , the man continued ," My name is Luar Malfoy . I was primarily a healer , but to support my task , have the mastery of potions , legilimency and occlumency . I was alive from 890A.C till 938A.C and was the head healer of Wizarding Europe . "
He wanted to know the answer from Malfoy himself. But he knew that he will never let these words out of his mouth. They will always be buried deep into his heart . Like a secret message bottle floating in the vast ocean never to be found, never to be read, never to be answered.
" He said that he will never marry me! Can you believe it ! He said that. How could he !?! And do you know what he said when I asked him why ? He said that he didn't want anyone, that he already had what he needed ! " Now, her eyes were growing frantic and so was her smile.
-A subtle feeling of Harry flattering and indulging Draco now that he had already hinted his feelings to Draco a.k.a Harry trying to woo Draco.
Reaching the moving stairs , Draco felt his head ache and his focus blur . His body was swaying dangerously. His body heavily leaning on the barricades on the stairs .
" Hmm" replied Harry , sparing the hardworking elf an approving glance . He had initially told the elf to not call him master but he insisted that it was a very important custom. Overthat, this elf was a very diligent one , even learning to correct the grammatical mistake in his speech. Harry didn't want to make him upset and so after that Harry never corrected him when he called him master.
Even if she didn't speak, her eyes shone hidden curiosity and happiness as she slowly ate. She wasn't very comfortable moving her body so when Hermione helped her with the fish, she happily ate it. But what made her even more happy was that Hermione noticed such a small detail about her and that she personally helped her. She secretly felt ecstatic in her heart.
[T/N :- Tell honestly, guys - all of us have had this moment with that hot doctor or nurse, haven't we? Don't lie! Come on! Out with it! I want to know that it wasn't just me drooling like a pervert when the hot dentist put her fingers in my mouth !!! ]
“By creating conflicting emotions not your own.” Luna nodded in confirmation. “She doesn’t talk to anyone much, I noticed.”
to the hidden politics beneath he surface, and Draco was standing there with a calm, plain and genial smile that would’ve made Lucius
“It’s way less critical, I promise! Just some information!” He put his hands up in defense and she leaned off a bit, though still looked suspicious. “And really
stuffing his face of course, but then again Harry doubted much could pull him away from food, not even the guilty conscious he clearly didn’t have.
And hey, having six first years looking up at him where he hovered above them with stars in their eyes wasn’t so bad on the ego either.
Blaise and Theo want to witness it, and is it going to hurt.” He narrowed his eyes pointedly at them.
Deciding he didn’t want to deal with Ron first thing in the morning on the day he got to start magical classes, he accepted his time table when McGonagall handed it to him with a wide grin that caused her to shoot him a suspicious glare, before calling a quick “Be right back!” to his dormmates and taking off towards the Slytherin table before Ron could fully reach them and sit down.
into his face, kneeling on the edge of Draco’s bed in their dorm like a little kid who’d been told today was Christmas morning.
and looked like it was carved from the same set of ancient trees or skinned from the same black dragon.
“…excuse me while I go be sick for a second,” He got out, knowing he sounded distinctly queasy, and Blaise looked sympathetic for what might be the first time in his life. Draco and Theo just looked grim as hell. He blew out a weary breath, but nodded in agreement. “Well… I guess at least knowing the truth can’t be worse than being ignorant. Even if it’s probably going to suck.” It’d also get him to Axeclaw, in person, before winter break. Not the most ideal of circumstances to bring that about, but an opportunity he really couldn’t afford to waste either.
true so… “Ah, y-yeah? I mean, no one knew where you were. Hedwig’s here though s-so I knew you would come back eventually...” He tried to defend himself in discomfort.
“We have people of all skill levels you know; it might be fun. Our next practice is in two weeks, right Lu?” He asked with almost clinical politeness towards the Ravenclaw, who nodded once with a look on his face that said he was agreeing with Neville right now. “You should come.” Harry offered the olive branch to Ron, who looked a bit surprised Harry had actually done that.
He’d spend the next four years at Hogwarts trying to rebuild his reputation and it was a crap shoot on if he’d ever manage it. What he
His chest was moving in silent breathes, almost hyperventilating to a point as his anger took hold and probably overwhelmed him with emotion he hadn’t had to deal with in years. He moved, but didn’t seem to know what to do with his own body.
Minerva put the small packet of paper in front of her down, having just finished reading through it--three times.
Not that Harry hadn’t fully instigated that confrontation, but so far as anyone could prove he’d been nothing but friendly.
He gave one non-committal nod. "No. I don't like them much." He admitted. Where did he even start with this can of worms really? He gave it a second’s thought before deciding today was not the time to bring everything down with talk of the life he was leaving behind, and shook it off quickly. "They hate magic, to put it kindly. My aunt was my mother's sister and I think she was always jealous of my mom's magic. Jealousy became hatred somewhere along the line and then my parents died without there ever being closure, leaving me with muggles who hate magic and pretty much anything not totally 'normal'. Whatever
Then again, giving who this girl was, the fact she’d picked a day when the most loud-mouthed Weasley
off pretty quickly, and even with his rude tone Harry couldn’t fault him seeing as all the signs were saying he was
“Sure, I’ll be here.” He was very tempted to ask if it’d hurt but figured he wouldn’t get an honest answer anyway—and he’d be heavily judged for being a wimp. Well, too late now.
of free time this summer locked in a shed, as well as nearly completing all his saved-up textbooks cover-to-cover with associated journals of notes he’d taken on each one, so that really only left the textbooks for the coming year to read, and his new joke-Transfiguration book.
For the purposes of this story, Henry Potter had two sons--Fleamont and Charles. Fleamont is Harry's grandfather and Charles was his grand uncle who married Dorea Black. Just because canon lore is a bit hazy about it.
and if that didn’t set every warning flag Harry had up, he didn’t know what would. The only saving grace was that if it were legitimately controversial or dangerous, Theo would be nowhere to be found rather than following Draco’s lead in the thick of it so… maybe it wouldn’t be
The twins’ parents seemed nice enough. Mrs. Weasley had even sent him a Christmas present last year, so despite probably going to be far closer to Ron than he’d like, he also be getting closer to the twins which wasn’t bad at all. They might be willing to help…
Harry tried not to let it show on his face how it felt like the hope that had fluttered to life in his chest was being ground under her heel right now, but he wasn’t sure how successful he was given by how she politely gave him a moment by bending down to pick up her bag and arrange her books back around in preparation to leave.
"I met a couple of his brothers and they were very nice. Ron is… ugh, forget about him, but the whole family doesn't seem that bad to me." He mused delicately, hoping Draco would get the hint.
“Sirius.” She greeted, not lowering her scarf but placing one finger over where her lips were to remind him of listening ears. Whether he got that or not, she didn’t give him a chance to speak before continuing—she was on a time limit after all. "I'll refrain from asking how you've been and skip the niceties for now."
Honestly, he had no idea what to make of this and he really didn’t want to get caught in the middle for any reason. This was uncharted territory for everyone and the one thing Slytherins didn’t like is the
And because he was still kind of shaken by this whole horrible day, he didn’t feel the need to care about her.
He had another letter for Draco, continuing their in-school correspondence, and this one was rather weighty since they’d been talking finances a lot more. Clearly Draco was also learning more from his parents so he had a lot more to say on the subject since the start of the new year and most of it was far above Harry’s paygrade, so there was a lot of questions to be asked.
everyone, but he could talk to people and got to know them at least a little bit, and if they never sat next to each other again because they just weren’t going to be friends like that, then fine.
“It’s extremely unnatural, how fast you can learn this stuff. Not that it’s a bad thing, but you should know.” Fred pointed out.
One snake could be dealt with. A nest of snakes was infinitely more complicated and poisonous, and that was the way this house worked.
He glanced at Dumbledore but decided against it, looking towards his transfiguration professor instead. “So it… it was really him? I mean I knew it was him but… how did you know?”
Harry blinked in surprise, but despite not wanting to talk about the summer he knew that was unavoidable. Mood-ruiner as it was, he was thankful for the warning, so he didn’t have to deal with Susan in his face out of nowhere at breakfast. Neville wasn’t even phrasing it like a question he expected an answer to, it
“We’ll leave you to it; let us know how it goes.” Dean waved them off happily as Blaise practically dragged Harry back to snake territory in eagerness to see whatever it was Harry had up his sleeve go down. Harry waved back at his roommates, particularly a rather baffled looking Neville.
He’d mentally called Ron Weasley a glory hound in his head for months after all, so he could probably imagine what kind of
“Harry dear, take pity on the boy.” Blaise put his chin in his hand, looking far too amused as Draco buried his own face out of sight in defeat.
he could figure out a way to prevent actually being expelled if the Malfoys protecting him—again, Draco was spoiled so while he himself had nothing to offer to his parents in exchange for their help, if Draco asked for something he would definitely get it even if that meant going against the Ministry. They’d been a dark family until recently after all, it probably wouldn’t even be that hard for them.
Harry had a mental image of Draco trying to do just that and snorted to himself at that entertaining picture.
“Now then, just a quick diagnostic spell to see what’s the matter.” He said, lifting his wand and casting a light blue spell that laid over Harry’s skin and made his eyes feel warm.
He had had a very pleasant conversation with a boa constrictor which seemed to understand him somehow
“Some minor things I can clear up right now with a couple non-intrusive spells: you have two residual blocks on your magical core. It looks like something that
was not an uncommon name, especially after the dark lord’s defeat there was an explosion of children named Harry here and there, and the boy Draco had met at Diagon Alley could’ve been the right age for how small he was. To hear that the boy was actually going to be in Draco’s year was a bad omen though, given they’d always known that their son and the Potter child would be year mates.
at that, and someone who would let the boy be himself to make his own choices—choices that would hopefully involve keeping Draco happy in some aspect, that is. And on that note they couldn’t be a guardian that would be outright against Slytherins and
“Alice and Frank Longbottom were tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and are no longer capable guardians in any form according to the mediwitches of St. Mungos. I believe their son is in the care of Augusta Longbottom, who did offer to take you in as well however since she was not listed in the will specifically, your care was reverted to your closest living relatives. A fault of the enchantments, I believe.”
to be Draco’s friend, but he’d sworn to himself a long time ago that he wasn’t going to be cruel to himself just for the sake of others, and bending over backwards just for the chance someone else
Pushing through his daze and the crowd, he approached the train and watched the crowd of people around. You could clearly tell the muggle families from the wizard ones, it was kind of comical really, but the one thing they had in common was the slightly wet expressions on their faces as they looked down at their children who were going to be departing for parts unknown in a short time. Harry tried not to let it bother him
Seamus and Dean seemed like nice guys, though they hadn’t had much of a chance to talk last night since it was late by the time they got back from the feast and they were all practically in a food coma. They’d done the obligatory exploration of the spacious, frankly lavish-yet-cozy room, claiming their spots and getting settled in just enough to not be total messes come the morning, but had retired pretty quickly. Dean seemed muggleborn as his posters were of muggle football teams, but Seamus could’ve been anything as he was enthusiastic about everything he encountered, but not overly shocked either. Seamus seemed a little slow on the uptake sometimes since sarcasm clearly flew over his head, but he’d noticed Neville’s silence and been genuinely nice to him without getting in the shy boy’s face about why he wasn’t saying much. Dean had laughed at Harry’s sarcastic comments but didn’t engage either.
lucky that all the damage you sustained is very fixable. Your shoulder and arm were shattered and your rib cage was collapsed inwards; it punctured your lungs and several other organs, not to mention you had a case of whiplash from what the professors tell me is the troll dropping you. For your life I prioritized your organs and for your comfort I fixed up your shoulder and arm. The bones are still settling there and the ones in your hands are extremely delicate in nature so you’re not to use that arm for a gosh darn thing for the next week which is why I bound it up to remind you. Your ribs were a little trickier and are still out of alignment, but after you’ve rested some I’ll take a look at finishing them up later today and you’ll be here for the next three days until I’m sure you’re not going to put too much strain on them while they’re so tender. I am aware you’re on the house quidditch team—Minerva has explained it to me at length—so if you

“That would be good.” She allowed, taken off guard by that but not against it. “Remus has always been… hesitant, about reaching out. And knowing he was watched, and how that could put Harry in danger…” She shook her head rapidly to rid herself of the dark thoughts. “Well, my opinion on the blatant breaking of laws aside, it’s not a bad thing if she’s really willing to do it.”
Draco balked a bit. “Oh… well yeah, he said something to that effect. About how hanging out with… the wrong sort could get you in trouble.”
“The writing level is quite low and admittedly I’m not the greatest at Transfiguration spells, but the Arithmancy is so painfully simple
until you just told me that it would be helpful to know—I was told muggleborns weren’t at a disadvantage going into Hogwarts since even pureblood children don’t know much magic going into it.”
offered for him to go back and sit with Draco but Neville had just shook his head rapidly with a panicked look on his face. They’d lost the loud brunette girl somewhere although Harry was honestly not sure at what point that had happened.
"You're my first visitor in eleven years." He stated flatly, blank almost but also quite… strongly, for someone in his state.
“She told us what was going to happen and about the safety precautions we have to take. It’s my fault my earmuffs weren’t on tight enough.” Harry felt like Neville might as well be patting him on the head for the tone he was speaking in, and he didn’t much like it but recognized he was the
"I just want to fly, none of that." He waved it off quickly. "But it's good you're okay. The ball is okay and all that?"
Harry slowly drew back but kept his hands unmoving on Draco's waist . When he saw the glassy tears in Draco's eyes, an erratic jolt ran through his body. With the apology on the tip of his tongue, Harry also felt a sense of intense possessiveness.
Harry sighed with helplessness and Hermione said, word by word , very slowly and clearly , " Ron , you don't have a wife "
Unknown to him, on the other side of the world, a pair of emerald green eyes were weaving a painting of his pale skin and making plans to return to his side once again.
Her limbs started losing their strength. Two steps after, she was crawling on the ground trying to keep going when black spots started clouding her vision.
From behind Draco , a pair of menacing green eyes shone as if saying , " Answer carefully if you want your head on your shoulders"
Harry had seen people die and seen people kill. Fear wasn't something that came easily to him. Such a sight wasn't as dreadful to him as it was for Ron. Somewhere along the years Harry's heart had cooled down and frozen to pain and dread on himself and others.
Draco was just wondering if he was still in the castle or not. And if they were, why had he not heard of this soul with the number of books he had read ? Exactly how old was he for people and history to completely erase the traces of him or his life ?  It was just then that the man stood up and turned to Draco. He was an elderly man looking close to the age of his father and had a sophisticated face with a gentle expression just like his voice. Looking down at Draco, he spoke, " How are you ? Do you feel any pain, any discomfort ? Is there any headache ?"
Now she was wheezing but still unwilling to leave her sentence incomplete . Her hand clutched Draco as she pleaded them .
The sorrow on his face slowly turned into hatred, twisting the face with a vicious sneer, "This is where he killed them." He spat out each word with undisguised hostility.
He rapidly wrote long letters, including each and every warning he could remember in both the parchments while making Neville's a little longer. Afterall, while Blaise was an acquaintance and newly formed ally l, Neville was someone Harry instinctively protected and looked after. He was the small shy little brother of the entire Gryffindor tower and Harry inherently saw him as the same. Finishing them and keeping them aside, Harry got up with the intention to sleep as well.
Ron sat on the old chair in front of the grand dusty piano as Hermione sat beside him. She watched as he crudely played the tune of
At the end, his voice turned disdainful as if he tasted dung. His eyes on Neville were disgusted but filled with mirth at his misfortunate as well.
A deep breath full of aroma invaded her nose and a heady buzz sounded in her brain. The floral aroma smelled even more delectable by mixing in the scent of the forest surrounding them.
"Then - I  -  he -" Ron stuttered with a confused look , frantically pointing towards himself then at the direction Harry left.
His father said in a gentle but worried voice ," What happened , son ? Did something happen at school ?"
Malfoy forgot that Harry had enough strength to turn the tables against him , in political situations as well as public image . Harry's word was enough to destroy him . He did not need leverage over Malfoy . He forgot that no matter how brave or good or righteous Harry was , power is an inevitable lure , especially in the form of control over his arch-nemesis , over someone like Draco Malfoy ,
" We wouldn't even be able to reach here  if you knew how to take care of yourself and not to get so severely hurt !"
“Her aunt is Madam Amelia Bones—she’s the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement in the Ministry, so it’d be easy to check something like that. Something weird she said, or I thought it was weird because she thought it important to bring up in the first place, was that Dumbledore was trying to get through your wards but couldn’t get past the goblins.”
is as of yet undetermined. From Mr. Potter’s reaction, he had been treated very poorly by his muggle relatives. I have observed that the more gruesome the detail and the stronger one’s pride, the more silent they become. The boy got some of your pride in exchange for humbling you some this past year, so I can only imagine the gruesome details are not pleasant at all.” Narcissa resumed picking at her meal while she spoke, almost too casually for how Draco’s mind short circuited.
so he’d taken the bottom-most two in order to be out of the way and put all the potions and soaps and shampoos the nice hairdressers had given him, along with two baskets of both Dell’s baubles and another filled with all his other collected shiny things. He also had like five combs and brushes and while he felt more than a little vain he loved his hair and he was going to take care of it no matter what opinions he got from his dormmates.
“Look into the mirror,” He deflected, stepping aside and everything inside Harry told him it was a bad idea.
Making Severus his son's godfather was a tactical move worthy of Slytherin, nothing more—Severus had always been aware of this, and of what Draco meant to his father.
And he was right of course, and Harry would’ve asked why Blaise seemed to be taking his side rather than Draco’s… or why he was content to play
“Plotting, of course. Seems to be what I do these days. Plotting to bust Neville outta his shell, plotting to make McGonagall love me…”
, who was definitely one of the nicer guys of their whole year by like a lot. The Hufflepuff girls were nice, but definitely the gossipy, judgmental types like most preteen girls were, and he knew for a fact that despite liking him, they’d both probably had some unkind thoughts to their slightly outcasted group member.
So Harry kind of felt the obligation to at least remind her sometimes or, whether she was okay with it or not, she’d spend a lot of her life pretty alone.
He scolded, giving him a big, grey-eyed, imploring look that Harry had to turn fully around to ignore.
“Ha, hypocrite. I heard Loony Luna Lovegood can do no wrong by you, or anyone else so long as you’re around.”
It spoke again, and Quirrell seemed to relent… turning slowly back around to face him from where he’d drifted forward in his concern, and lifted his hands… to undo his turban.
real interaction he’d had in an undetermined amount of weeks, actually, and it’d been a really weird one.
In a twisted mimicry of what he’d done to Montague only just this afternoon, the arm extended towards him intent on harm turned to solid stone, the hand and the sleeve and the arm all the way up to the shoulder blade. It fell off the body it was attached to in short order, stone crumbling as it hit the ground with a loud crackle and a wet bloody stump spilling blood onto the floor from the violent loss of a limb. Too bad Quirrell was already suffocating, so fortunately there was no scream to accompany it despite Harry assuming it probably hurt quite a bit.
So far as Vernon and Petunia were concerned, he was locked in a hot shed with a bucket of soup cans,
Transfiguration seemed effortless to him for some reason, but literally everything else he only scored well because Draco had drilled good notetaking and studying habits into him courtesy of his many childhood tutors. Outside of Transfiguration, he had
Maybe he’d been louder than expecting before Draco seemed to freeze mid-playfight and looked over, legitimately horrified once more.
There was no way of knowing when exactly or how many years it would take, but with Harry Potter—the boy the dark lord will want dead above all other people—now at Hogwarts and learning to become a full wizard, that would only complicate things
Severus of course had a residence outside of Hogwarts, but the castle had his best brewing stations and most complete ingredient stores, not to mention the summer months were perfect time to get work done on his potion research, uninterrupted. Even Dumbledore left him alone on the most part, knowing he’d be in an even
They were a business family, and while they didn’t make money like the Malfoys did, certainly, not even money could create the kind of information and goods network a true, old-blooded merchant family had built after dozens of generations. Like many ancient and nobles houses, the value of their heirloom artifacts and personal libraries were legitimately priceless in shear wealth, rarity, and information compared to plain gold. After all, you couldn’t buy certain connections, or the knowledge that came with the trade that the Greengrass family was capable of.
better after taking his potions and brushing his teeth free of the taste, but it was a bad omen for this coming summer.
Harry got a suspicious feeling they weren't here to actually play and decided to get ahead of that line of thinking pretty quickly. He wasn't sure he would be able to
heard about how shouting wasn’t something Slytherins did in their common room, he held it in. No need to out himself as the annoying Gryffindor in the snake den within five minutes of getting here.
The room was circular and spacious enough that each little pie-slice had enough room for the four-poster bed, the trunk at the foot of it, a desk, and a decent albeit small wardrobe. Some areas had windows above the desks, other had solid walls; Neville had taken the bed beside his so their desks were side-by-side, and both of them had windows on either side of their beds. Seamus, an Irish boy he’d met briefly the night before, got one window and some wall, while Dean, another acquaintance, and Ron Weasley himself both had walls. Dean was fine with this arrangement as he apparently brought several posters that needed to be hung and he’d need the real estate, while Ron on the far side of the room had mentioned he liked to sleep and ‘
Even with all this going on in the background that he was sure Draco had no idea about, the idea his godson would try and use his rivalry with Gryffindor, and their head of house by proxy, to try and
and alarmingly weak with all food now officially gone, and eventually he had strips of one of Dudley’s old shirts wrapped almost entirely around his hands to stop the bleeding from dozens of cuts as he slipped in his grip on it and cut himself. That only slowed it down though as the cloth made it almost impossible to properly grip the slippery silver blade handle, even if he
if the other team managed to steal it so Neville was mostly just defense. He seemed fine with this and although they'd lost several points in the beginning since he seemed to flinch and close his eyes if the ball came anywhere near him, after close to two hours going at it he seemed to get the hang of it and realize the ball wasn't going to take his arm off if he reached out a hand to block it, especially since neither Lu nor Seamus had more than this morning's practice at actually kicking a football straight. He was not even close to doing the dives that Dean was clearly very good at in his attempts to stop Harry from scoring on him, but Harry had surprisingly good aim and quick reflexes to change course last-second if he noticed Dean leaning one way or the other. It was a pretty high-scoring game since none of them were pros, but it was a lot of fun.
And that made tears sting sharply in his eyes as he glared into the mirror before him in frustration.
Draco had been… quiet, when he saw Pomfrey hand him a rather large box of potions and began taking him through which ones to take and when. While she didn’t talk about what they were in front of another student, Draco loved potions and his godfather had been tutoring him for years before Hogwarts.
planned, and would just wait for him to share it when he was ready—or if he wanted to share, that is. He
“Yeah same. I know what I want, no idea how to get it.” He gave another put-upon sigh and shot him a vaguely annoyed look that made no sense to Harry at all. It wasn’t the first time he’d been given that look though so he let it go. “Guess we’ll have to work it out.”
It also explained why he was so twisted up in knots every time he had to write home to his parents—it sounded like a freaking mine-field to navigate, which had to be hard considering he very much did actually love them as his parents on top of needing to be on his toes with them.
He was relieved to be past talking about Mrs. Malfoy for the moment, but at the casual question his mind sprung to life at everything he’d been ignoring for the time being. He somehow knew Draco was talking about Montague-like plans:
Way belatedly he realized he had no idea what happened to his own wand… clearly it hadn’t helped him though… and yet…
Draco and he had found a rhythm of letter writing, Harry mentioned he only had time at night and very early in the morning, so he’d usually get back to the shed to see a Hedwig drinking from her water bowl in the corner with a letter around her leg. He’d read it and respond before continuing to read from his textbooks and take detailed notes— at Draco’s instruction since apparently the spoiled jerk had had private tutors since birth and was now more than willing to boss him around in good-studying practices. Sometime in the night Draco must get his letter and draft his own response since apparently the boy didn’t need to sleep and was fine sleeping in until any hour during the summer
“That’s fine.” He agreed easily. “I can’t tell exactly how long it’ll take to find what we’re looking for.”
. He was present, this was him, and it was time to take on this grand adventure as himself as he was meant to be, and it promised to be a good time in the making.
“I thought you were warning me because you already knew how much I didn’t like the Headmaster.” He admitted and her eyes widened almost comically.
He didn’t know how long it would take though, and it most certainly wasn’t the only horse he had in the race because there was still the undeniable fact that Sirius Black really could just be his parent’s betrayer and nothing more, or simply not fit or willing to take on a kid once freed from the hellhole that was Azkaban. He needed to know the fate of other people mentioned in his parents’ will to start, and he was kind of assuming they were all dead but
Both boys snickered at that… McGonagall was practically preening at the teacher’s table now which was a weird look on her and many people noticed. She’d told him to keep it quiet
He wandered in an out of shops for a good half hour, but nothing really caught his eye until he stumbled on one with a metal song playing overhead and a lot of people wearing eyeliner both shopping
The last class of the year was unfortunately their double-Potions session in the morning, but on the upside it meant they were officially
, his mind whispered at him, and he automatically flinched. All three teachers seemed extremely grave.
"Sure. Oi Neville!" Dean shouted, calling their last member over, and the blond started jogging up to them. Harry turned at met the eyes of two curious gazes over where their theoretical sidelines were and waved at them. They looked startled before glancing at each other and standing to come over hesitantly.
sure did despite the immediate indignant cry at that, “—I think having a normal toad as a pet is interesting! You have to work harder to befriend it since it's not magical."
He clambered up, almost collapsing again but adrenaline now kicking in and somehow he got upright. That’s right, he could…he could…
“Oh?” He tilted his head and felt Neville watching him like a hawk from behind him. “I wouldn’t mind if
for Slytherin reasons or they’d denounced him a traitor on top of everything else they called him these days.
“So, Potter…what was that about snakes being cute?" Blaise changed the subject back to his mini fight with pure glee in his voice from behind them. Harry didn’t notice Draco stiffen beside him when he rolled his eyes for Blaise’s benefit as he tossed a wry smile over his shoulder at the taller Slytherin, acknowledging what he was trying to do.
She was a freakishly intelligent bird. He even thought Bastian was a clever eagle-owl, but this arctic owl spun circles around him, the two of them getting into quite a tiff here and there in his bedroom until he kicked them both out to play elsewhere while he finished writing. He’d watched his poor pet get so flustered over Hedwig stealing things out from under him and nipping at this flight feathers until he was irritated enough to try and claw at her—only for her to disappear in a flutter of snowy white wings and Bastian to give chase, always in vain unfortunately.
He imagined that his tiny little light had been a bonfire once, that long ago he’d been a happy and warm person until the storm came and extinguished most of it. And locked up inside a statue, there was only so many ways a candle flame could flicker.
“Draco Malfoy, and I can’t say the same.” Draco deadpanned and Harry felt like facepalming. Hermione just looked shocked, but Draco didn’t break stride. “Mind your own business Granger—and Weasley, shut your trap before you regret it.”
it was convenient and no one he cared about was endangered for it, by Draco’s request only, but he wasn’t quite sure where his feelings would actually lay when it came down to it. He had a horrible feeling it was going to end up a choice between his godson and Lily’s son, and frankly he’d be happy to save that fucking nightmare for his future self to deal with.
