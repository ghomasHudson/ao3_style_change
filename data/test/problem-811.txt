"I think we should put a ration aside for them," Harry says, finally getting to his feet. The seagulls crowd the kitchen floor, screeching and rubbing themselves all over Potter.
Next update on 10th October, Saturday.
"I'd imagine yes," Fudge pointlessly flips a book close and then leans back in his seat. "Crime does seem to skyrocket particularly in September,"
"You're being a twat."
"Butcher gets fresh meat to chop," Evan snaps the book shut, even though it's nowhere near her line of sight, it's always better to be vigilant in her presence. "I'm spoiled meat, Valentina. He's having you gorging on spoils."
Harry takes the pen in shaking hands and sets the point on the paper, but doesn’t start writing. "Hey--"
yet. He cries out weakly. He blinks rapidly and notices that the darkness is lifting. He can
Draco pouts in mock sympathy. "Poor piss Potter with his sob story of a life." he ducks a stinging jinx coming from the shorter boy. "Hiding behind his name, and his poor rag-wearing friends… hiding behind Diggory." That struck a nerve, and Potter goes very still, his eyes wide with rage and his hand trembling in place. Draco rejoices, only momentarily at Potter's frozen figure before he pushes again.
"Don't come back until the bleeding stops!" She’d screamed at him, shoving him off the porch, and glaring at him with narrowed, hawk-like eyes while Harry shook under the lashing rain. Holding himself together by the middle, too scared to touch his head. Too cold under the rain.
“No, it’s not. Open your shirt,” Harry says, eyes determined as he takes another strip and soaks it in water.
He's not.
Thanks a world to our beta~
"Malfoy and I should be going now," he says it mostly for the other boy's sake, but Umbridge clicks her tongue once more. The sound makes Harry want to wriggle in discomfort.
Draco looks at the neatly cut carrots with nonchalance. "I like them enough."
The young man catches Draco's gaze, steadily holds it without an ounce of concern. He looks too young to be Rosier Senior, his father's former business partner. This must be the son.
Draco shakes his head, he can't even believe his thoughts right now.
Mrs. Malfoy was being killed, brutally murdered. Harry had seen it happen, every second of it, with his own eyes, which were so absurdly, so horrifically, so inexplicably and uncontrollably narrowed in
Draco woke up to Harry making them peanut butter sandwiches, using a torn piece of bread to plop the thing on another piece, as he spread it evenly and topped it off with another from the package.
"Don't be quick, be thorough."
"Are you alright?" Hermione asks and Harry hastily nods. Picking an apple on impulse. He takes a huge bite out of it despite nausea clearly sending the opposite message.
"I'm not alleging anything, Kingsley, just so we're on the same page. It's just… well, you know how Dumbledore has been in regard to the ministry lately. I just don't see why the Aurors under my command should be in contact with him. As you know, he's just the school's headmaster --"
Ron frowns, "Aren't we going to practise magic?"
Rosier seems nonplussed by the exchange, as he reaches for the floo powder and inches Potter closer to the fireplace. "Hand him over," he says to Umbridge and the woman squeaks indignantly. "What?!"
Twinky's lips quiver, but she nods, shrinking back a little. “I will- I will take my leave now, sirs.”
The first thing he notices upon arriving is the chilled air, immediately raising goosebumps on his skin.
Draco’s hands still on Harry’s arm, and he turns the word over in his mouth. That was a name only his mother had ever called him. Sometimes father, but usually Mother. He’d never been familiar enough with anyone else for them to use it, not even Severus or Blaise. He doesn’t know how he’d feel if Harry started calling him that, especially in that- that voice of his.
"I'm fine," Potter snaps, "Great."
"What is the point of this?" Harry asks, sounding as if he's genuinely curious. "You already did the apology dance this morning."
"Of course, sir."
Harry really should hurry.
"Alright. Thank you, Headmistress." Harry quietly picks his bag, and sneaks a glance down at Malfoy, still on the ground.
"Harry…"
With another order member gone from the school… Severus shakes his head, cutting the thought midway as it was forming. He has to focus now.
It's playing like a loop in his head, that image. And then Harry straight-up running out on him.
His legs ache, and his whole right arm has gone numb.
He doesn’t have much time.
Merlin, Draco could do with a calming draught right now. Or several.
“Mm hm,” Harry hums around his spoon, “I'll tell you all about it. Eat your ice cream though, it's starting to melt."
"She did that to him. It didn't take long. Just a day. A single day before Frank couldn't tell his toe from his nose.” Sirius’ voice cracks, and Remus takes a step towards him, “She had my godson for two days."
He really wishes Ron and Hermione were here now.
Rosier laughs. He thinks it's a joke. Harry has never been more serious in his life.
He's not a thief. This isn't stealing. It's just… They're muggles.
Myrtle, instead of replying, flies from his right to his left, leaning in closer to the basin. “What happened to you?”
When he wakes up, he is still warm. But not the burning, scorching heat from before. He makes a noise in his throat, before quickly stifling it, wide eyes darting around the grey corners of the cell, as if Bellatrix is about to pop out with a loud ‘Boo!’ before proceeding to reduce him to a writhing, screaming mess again.
No, Harry wants to growl. No I don’t, and fuck you.
"Harry," he carefully keeps his voice mellow and not askance. He wonders, idly if the other boy can hear him from wherever he currently is. Draco envies that Potter has the ability to be anywhere but in a cell, in Draco Malfoy's basement.
There's a roll of gauze in his hand, and Draco closes his fingers around the bundle and Harry's fingers.
"-DISGRACE OF THIS FAMILY! SHOULD HAVE DISOWNED YOU WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE YOU ROTTING PIECE OF FILTH! "
"I am panicking Ron!” She squeezes his hands tightly, “This is happening, we're going to be in so much trouble if anyone finds out but I've never felt like anything is more right than doing this, even though it's wrong--"
The idea makes him pause. God, what is he doing? He could be walking right into the Dark Lord’s arms. Severus was right, he is too attached to Potter.
Draco clears his throat, his throat is parched, his hands are clammy.
"Don't say sorry. I'm not,” he lets go of Draco’s hand and stands up. “Let's go buy stuff in the snack booth."
a good sign, but hearing Harry say that is just frustrating.
There's a pause, Potter struggles to breathe rightly, "I found out… sometime ago. I don't know the time,"
"Edward Rosier would have had your tongue pulled out of your ungrateful mouth for that," Evan says pleasantly, vaguely waving a hand at somewhere behind Harry. "He wasn't as tolerant as I am."
Draco blinks, “
When she speaks, it’s the same cold, even tone he grew up hearing from her. "How did you get here?”
And Snape was there.
“Hush, Potter.”
Harry sends a stinging hex towards Umbridge, and Draco doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. A stinging hex, what the fuck is wrong with Potter? His fingers strain to grab the freaking wand.
"So you'll help us?"
Grimacing at the taste, Harry gulps it down in two swallows, trying not to gag.
Severus' kit to begin with.
Eyes widening, he grabs his wand off the bedside table. He’s probably overreacting. But it’s better to be safe than sorry. Overreaction is better than under preparation.
Peeling the sweat-soaked blanket off of him, he swings his legs over the bed, sitting up as his legs touch the cold floor. At this rate, he's going to have permanent bite-shaped scars on his hand.
"It wasn't my fault, Rosier, come off your high horse," says Dolohov.  "I did what my lord asked of me, whether it didn't work out or not isn't my problem. I did my duties."
“I know,” Harry says, “It’s fine.”
Lucius hummed. ‘It’s not her, It’s the other one. Selene is too gentle with the child. Valentina seemed barely involved. The knight is laying low,’
He heaves his bag over his shoulder and walks out of the bathroom, and then almost groans, only smothering it by the thinnest thread of will. He doesn’t let his steps falter as he walks, keeping one eye discreetly at the shadow tailing him not so discreetly.
on the lid. Only the wrapper touched the garbage can, Draco."
He’s also not going to voice this very redundant fact out to Draco. He already knows.
Harry scoffs, “Screw you,” But he lifts a hand to pat down the mess. Unsuccessfully.
"They will patrol the area, to make sure we're in the safe zone," Remus says just as briskly as he walks, and Harry passes a fussy Hedwig over with another confused frown. Just what the hell is going on?
Severus nods at Albus and then stands to leave. He cannot tolerate socializing.
"I'm up. I'm up. I'm coming," Harry says wearily, hoping that his aunt would just
"Where she starts on a topic and just...Goes on. We've been sitting on this for a while, and she, well me too I guess, we were pretty worried, and kind of annoyed."
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry isn't shaking as much. It's as if there's only half of a presence in his body, and the tremors that run down his arms and legs seem half hearted, a natural, uninterrupted cycle. While Potter's eyes stay glazed, somehow glassy in a way.
“You haven’t eaten a single thing I’ve made,” Harry points out.
Harry turns and starts walking.
"She's not," Dolohov mutters, and Rosier's sneer expands across his entire face. He's sleeping with her, of course, Rosier cannot see how anyone could, but Dolohov seems the type. "She says that no one at the ministry even noticed the dementors missing,"
Harry turns to look at him, "Yes, sir?"
Fuck.
"Good. Nice job, Draco."
“Thank you for stating the obvious, Potter,” Draco rolls his eyes, trying not to blurt out one concerned question after another about Harry’s well being. He knows Harry won’t take it well. If he’d wanted to talk about it, Harry wouldn’t have escaped outside.
Potter.
"I'm sorry for what I did to you," he says quietly.
He doesn't answer Draco, doesn't turn to look at the sea either, he just blinks and trails back to the kitchen, silently venturing to fetch a spoon to hollow the potatoes.
"Hey um, while you're here…" she draws a thick stack of envelopes from her bag, "is there any way you could take our letters to Harry?" She sees his eyes widen, "We wrote new ones," she blurts out, "it's really brief, and we tried to write it in code--"
He holds Draco's sleeve, as they quickly make their way down the stairs, their heads ducked down. Draco smiles at him from the corner of his eyes, and Harry smiles back. It's ridiculous, the juvenile mirth with which Harry thinks about their first 'Date'.
Pushing down the panic that’s starting to bubble in his chest, he pushes himself off the bed. It’s still early morning. He calls out again, louder this time, still to no answer.
This could be the most peaceful equivalent of a death Draco Malfoy could get. He's running a high fever, so he's probably not even registering the pain, it would be just like falling asleep. Harry could just...leave it untreated. Let nature take its course. Or even aid it in the way.
His fingers trace Draco's scar, "Please, for me? Just the muffin. I'm... I'm trying to think of something."
” Severus casts a quick non-verbal shield around Draco as he sprints across the room towards Potter, who is now on the floor from the resulting explosion from Rosier’s spell.
His vision swims a little, and he glances up. He doesn't have time to curse himself, as he sees Umbridge sending a jinx at Potter, Draco quickly shouts 'Protego!", sending a shield propelling in front of the other boy, stopping him from collapsing.
Potter washes the breakfast dishes with no complaint, then in the absence of other things to do, the boy walks over to the red worn couch in the living room, drapes himself on said couch, with the back door opened a nudge to let the wind run through the windchimes as he just lies there and stares into the distance.
Harry stares at Sirius for several long moments and knows if he were anyone other than a figment of his own imagination, he’d have looked away by now. "You're right,” he says, his voice flat. “I'm not okay, Sirius.” He takes a deep breath, “He was right, I'm not crazy, I'm just lonely. That's why you're here, that's why Miss Simons was here, and Remus… I was so lonely for so long," he traces small circles on the back of Draco’s hand.
Harry winces, shoving his wand back in his jeans. His back aches, and there's a crick in his neck. His legs are prickling with the standard pins and needles sensation. He'd fallen asleep on the floor.
Severus abhors uncertainty.
Sirius grins, and spreads his arms, “So well, let’s begin!”
Draco snorts, and picks up the kettle from the stove with a rag. "Why not just throw us in a pit and let us fight it out then?" He says as Harry gently toes the birds out of the backdoor to the porch.
"No,” Draco says promptly, remembering the way Pansy had followed him around every day, reporting back to Bellatrix or the Dark Lord and who knows who else. “Mostly because most of them didn't matter enough to be missed."
Sirius deflates at that, back to his lazy sprawl on the couch which is giving Remus a backache just by watching. "Ginger and brunette Lily."
"You haven't wondered." she says and Harry sees the way her shoulders tense.
Draco doesn't know why he asks such a thing. The bag is right there in his line of sight, he's pulled the robe to wrap Draco's shoulder from the very said bag. He huffs and points at the thing with his chin.
"Um… bag. The bag,"
"Draco is staying out of this,” he says, not turning towards Sirius, “I'm not... I'm not gonna do anything, Sirius. I'm just counting. I need to tire myself out."
Harry holds onto the walls as he walks, and after a while he hears whispering. Unintelligible, hissing sounds that he can't decipher, can't even tell the direction of. It's as if he's standing in the middle of a crowd, but doesn't speak their language.
“What is a telly, and why on earth would you be painting windows?”
While they wait, Harry dabs the wound clean with dittany. He's right, it's a really open wound. Almost gaping. Draco has no idea how his whole arm is still attached to his body.
and the sense of delight he had felt as he saw the muggles torn apart was almost immeasurable.
She didn't. But Harry still cannot believe his ears. The tone of her voice is easy for him to distinguish. She's dismissing him. Just like that. Something is fundamentally wrong with that. With the way her eyes are looking at him but her mouth is forming words contradictory to the look in her eyes.
He is going to be sick.
"Do you know what happened to Harry?" Someone else asks, Hermione whips her head in their general direction, but then more voices join in.
Rosier chuckles, and the sound sends a sudden wave of shivers down Harry’s spine. “I would have,” Evan says. “But Lucius and our Lord have made it abundantly clear that you aren’t to be touched.”
"It used to have the biggest beehive farm in Sussex. I was eight, and I think my parents wanted to shut me up."
“I’m not sure," Harry hums, "the milk might curdle just by looking at me.”
"I don't want your lavish spendings, Malfoy. This is nice. Thank you for buying me ice cream with stolen money."
"What blunder?"
"Didn't know?! Didn't
he has the words carved in is a bruised purple colour, and horribly swollen. And there are faint, dark poisonous veins spreading upwards towards his wrist and disappearing upwards. It looks like blood poisoning. But the uneasiness rising in his gut tells him it’s not as simple as that.
Next Update: Friday, September 17th
"They're accusing you of interfering in the Ministry while his own crony is in her office drinking tea! And calling one of my students… delusional? How dare they?"
But, given his luck, the wound itself throbs steadily in rhythm with his heartbeat. Sending waves of pain and nausea coursing through his veins.
"You guess," she drawls and Harry bites the inside of his cheek. Maybe he should have reacted differently.
"He's Fudge's main target, much like Albus. I'm not surprised." Charity inputs.
"Hide behind a shield, that's right, Potter," Draco sneers, "That's all you're good for, hiding."
Precious time is lost underneath the tides.
Remus still sounds weary, but not frantic anymore, as he says, “I think we should all sit and calm down for a moment.”
"Her room is right across ours, and she's bunking with Ginny," Ron says as she closes the door behind her. "So don't be alarmed if she barges in tomorrow at the crack of dawn to study here. It's her new thing."
“I know.” Potter swallows, and Severus nods, smoothing out the wrinkles on his own robes.
"Has a cat got your tongues then?" She walks around them, circles them until she's behind Malfoy and facing Harry, her beady eyes traveling from his paled face to his bandaged hand. Draco's eyes are now on Harry's face as well, and he looks pensive, as if he's trying his hardest to remain stoic.
"That's funny," Ron mutters, "We heard the same thing about--"
For the first time in a very long while, Lucius felt good about doing the right thing.
Draco just shakes his head before raising his wand. They’d have to be quick after this. He’s already going to apparate. And after that, the ministry would be able to track them here.
"Ronald!"
He's gonna kill him. Then he's gonna go after Draco.
Harry can't hear Evan's reply but the woman throws her head back and laughs.
His mind goes blank for one terrifying moment. The man peers at him and Draco clears his throat again, "Do you have pickled garlic?"
"It's also fresh," he puts it inside the bag, then looks at Draco. He must have noticed the sharp sting in his eyes because he drops his trembling hand and walks up to him, touches Draco's face with his other, clean hand. "The garbage they put out is dry, just wrapping papers, and...and tissues and stuff okay? It looks clean. If we don't eat now…"
In a place that reeks of dark magic, a house where every little thing could pose a threat of imminent death.
She was easy, Draco had known her weak spot twenty minutes after first meeting her when they were seven. He knows exactly where to push, really push. Strike for the kill. “This is ungraceful,” he drawls. “I thought you should know.” he shrugs with a crafted nonchalance shrug. “Pathetic even, for any daughter that was raised by Valentina and Selene Parkinson. I suppose you would know all about that,”
Chapter warnings for; explicit language, aftermath of self-harm, alcohol abuse, implied/referenced torture.
Harry resumes feeding those beasts and Draco watches him the entire time because he has nothing better to do and watching Harry is an entire activity by itself.
Draco shouldn't be lying to Harry, but he will, because this is the right thing to do, and he knows exactly what Harry needs to hear right now. And also the pain is killing him.
It really isn’t, but Potter is bleeding enough that the air in the bathroom is tinged metallic. And that’s a smell Draco isn’t particularly fond of.
He supposes he should be proud of himself for pulling the apparition off so smoothly, considering the most he’d done before had been from one end of the Manor to another. But the worry encompassing his mind is too great, and right now he’s only grateful he didn’t fuck up even this.
Draco purses his lips and shakes his head. He doesn’t want to see the damage. But another look from Harry, and he can’t refuse him. How could he? With the determined expression on his pale, too thin face, and hands that are so gentle despite their tremors. He’s taken aback by this.
It's a hall of mirrors, and it's so narrow that the most he can do is just extend one hand.
"You will not lose the coin,” she speaks, her voice as stern as she can make it. This is important. Perhaps one of the most important things she will ever do, “Once you've signed the contract you are obligated not to disclose any unwanted information with a third party, and Umbridge."
But it doesn't feel like it now.
‘She’s been brought up too softly,’ his father had said once, to his mother when he thought Draco was asleep. It was long after the party was over, and Draco had dosed in the library, in front of the flickering fireplace as his parents conversed about the guests.
To what point? His mind argues. The Dark Lord killed his mother. Draco would rather die than serve that monster.
“You know I have a funny feeling that you and Ron would get along,” Draco opens his mouth. Closes it, then opens it again.
Poppy nervously frowns. "Minerva, shouting isn't good for your heart,"
"I'm saying that Albus Dumbledore, while having the best intentions at heart, is using a child's severe traumatic experience in order to further his cause in the Ministry, John. I'm not sure you've met the boy yourself… a very fine lad. Too impressionable. As is the habit of children."
“You’re rambling. It doesn’t matter. It’s just food, I’m sure Snape can bring us more, besides, you seem to know more about cooking than I do,” Draco shrugs. He hopes they won’t be stuck here long enough for their food to actually run out.
"Where were you?!" Umbridge cries, finally standing over a stunned Potter, and Draco sighs. Rosier's eyes are still on him, before he throws an irritated glance at Umbridge. "You've wasted three full days, still unable to get the Dark Lord's work done, and then couldn't even come to aid me?"
It’s still hard to believe the sheer number of people who arrived.
"Why?"
John inclines his head and Fudge nods.
The paragraph in front of him about the properties of acromantula blood in a water based draught must have been written by some imbecile who has mush for brains. Severus scowls at the chicken scratch, the ink blotches, and the far too small roll of parchment. This child is a third year, surely she knows better than this?
"Pardon me?"
Draco is going to be devastated, once he wakes up.
“Was that okay?” Harry asks. Draco can barely nod over the heady rush he’s feeling. The last time he’d felt this way, remotely close to how he’s feeling right now, had been when they’d been dancing together.
Mrs. Weasley sends Ron and Hermione trailing in front of Harry in a walk of shame, with Ron holding a plate for Harry if he 'happens to be hungry' later. They don't try talking to Harry, as if they know better than that, and Harry's glad. He might have let out the remaining dredges of his anger on them if they did.
"There's a motel over there," Harry says, and Draco looks at him. He has no idea how Harry saw that through his fogged-up glasses. But sure enough, he can see a stark red
Death Eater. Death Eater, she's a Death Eater. She's with them. His mind is scrambling. This was exactly what he had been afraid of that very first day he found Potter unconscious.
Evan holds her gaze, easily enough.
"You have displeased me, Evan," his lord says, clicking his tongue, his bare foot comes upon Evan's blood caked cheek and tilts his head to the ceiling, away from the dead mocking eyes of Lucius Malfoy.
"You never allowed me to defend myself in your classes." The surly expression is back.
Harry shrugs, then winces as the seagull on his shoulders flaps indignantly, “Are you hungry?”
"Why would you ever brew something like that?!" Harry sounds horrified, and that’d probably be a normal reaction to that, but Draco can’t help being a tad impressed.
Rosier is not alone.
"Yes, thank you,” Draco says sharply, watching as Harry scrawls the name Larry in such a sloppy script it’s little more than chicken scratch. “How much is the fare?"
"Hmm?"
Next update Saturday, 16th May.
Next update on 8th January, Friday.
"And you've been having detentions with that woman for over a month, two, and she made you use the Quill every time?" Harry nods. "Why didn't you go to Poppy? This needed to he reported."
"He's right, we kept asking them what was going on and they didn't tell us anything, and everyone was just freaking out, Sirius was beside himself… he couldn't contact Remus or get any news from anyone… it was a mess." Hermione finishes lamely, slumping on the bed.
There is a foolish voice in Draco's head that just likes hearing Potter talk, regardless of the words or their meanings, a very tiny minority that secretly revels in the sound of Harry's voice, the way the words are formed in his mouth, and more absurdly, the way Harry says his name. Draco chains that voice to the most obfuscating corner of his mind.
Scary thoughts. Dangerous thoughts.
Harry is definitely laughing as he points to the seagull on his right shoulder, “Benji.”
"Yes, Headmistress Umbridge?" it is an effort not to emphasize that particular word.
"FILTHY MUDBLOODS IN MY HOUSE! I WON'T HAVE IT! BEGONE YOU FILTHY ANIMALS, BE GONE!" Harry flinches at the sudden screeching. Which faintly reminds him of Uncle Vernon.
“I’m writing it down." He says slowly, "I brought your wand and the other belongs to Draco. There’s no way to contact me, the floo doesn’t work in the fireplace. The kitchen is stocked, any ingredients that you might need is provided for at least five or six months. I or someone from the order will most definitely drop in before then. Do you understand me?” Severus folds the paper in two and holds it out for Potter.
No matter, Draco seems stable enough for now.
"When may I have this one, master?" the snake had asked him as he’d stroked her head. He rubs his hands vigorously at his pants, to make himself forget the feel of her scales. In the vision, he’d merely tilted his head to the side, regarding the mangled remains of the whimpering man.
“We can't leave any traces behind. The vestigo potion, he must have used your cloak.” Draco murmurs, and Harry nods, still confused but sated for now. While the shoe burns, Draco starts scourgifying as much blood from the tomb as he can.
“There’s running water in the kitchen. Go and fill up a bowl, fast.”
The best Severus can do right now is keep another actual infection out, while also counteracting the effects of the curse which causes blood poisoning on top of everything else. He pulls out the advanced brew of dittany that he had perfected throughout the years and hands four full vials to Potter.
This time Draco really cannot reign in the frown creasing his face. Balms. And skin grafter potions? Even if Severus were stupidly optimistic there wasn't much any of those things could do to a werewolf wound. Werewolf injuries cannot be healed. It's a universal truth.
Draco is burning up.
"I'm not a squealing pig hiding behind people." Potter finally says, slowly, his eyes cold and his face slack. "You are. You and your racist ass hiding behind your father and his name, 'my father this' and 'my father that'…" he continues in a high pitched voice, a crude exaggerated version of Draco's own. Potter's nose wrinkles. "Well news flash, Malfoy," He spits. "He's
The satchel looks like one of Severus’ potion bags. It doesn’t appear to have been spelled or enchanted in any way, which is disappointing because Draco doesn't know how to do it himself.
Everything is. Harry needs to go. Go. Go!
"Because I don't want to play the game anymore,” Harry laces his fingers through Draco where they’re wound around his stomach. He’s warm, both of them are. Which is such a novelty now that he sighs in contentment, “Had everything gone right, you would be my father, had everything gone right, I would be at school with my friends, but if everything had gone right, he wouldn't be holding me like this."
When he touches the doorknob, he's consumed by an irrational rush of fear that it would be locked. It can't be, of course not. No one here would lock him in, besides, Ron is here with him.
"What do you have to say for yourself now, Mr. Malfoy?" she digs in her wand harder, making him wince.
“Really?” Her voice is a mix of suspicion, delight, and astonishment, and Harry feels slightly guilty.
been?"
Severus purses his lips, but doesn’t try to contradict Harry. Harry continues, “And it took you five days to return.”
from the vice-like grip of guilt on his heart whenever he thinks of Cedric and his lifeless eyes, the Dursleys, the utter, bone-deep, crippling loneliness he has been feeling all summer. Away. Away. Away.
The fourth revelation reaches Harry when he’s mere seconds away from passing out for real. And it’s the most haunting one so far. It’s quite simple too. Harry’s body, or anybody’s body for that matter, does not keep a memory of pain. Not even an aftereffect. Once they stop and leave, Harry is going to forget. It’s a horrifying truth, that one can forget this kind of pain. How anyone could ever forget. But he will, his body won’t, not in the physical sense of the word, he would be shaking as if he were having an earthquake for some time, maybe even the rest of his life, but the pain? It’ll be gone, nothing but a memory until they decide to come back again.
"Git."
"Come on," he says, squashing the fluttering in his chest. The store is thankfully empty, and only the ice cream clerk is behind the counter. It happened quite by luck, seeing as Draco’s plan, was literally walking into the first interesting store he found as they walked. Ice cream is good, it’s safe, and hopefully cheap.
Draco has no idea whether this is just a muggle implement or wizards use them as well. In his life from before he never even used to think about laundry.
"They'll win in a second." Harry reaches for his mug, clenches his hand, and then holds it out for Draco. "I'm just realistic."
Draco just walks.
"The nerve soothers you've been taking," Severus says, starting to wrap Draco's shoulder in fresh bandages, this time without the Dittany, "Bring me a vial. I want to see which one you're using."
"Mr. Potter," she nods as Harry stops before her desk, his hands carefully and steadily lax, dangling freely by his sides, even the right one that's still stinging.
"Just a misunderstanding, I'm sure," Fudge waves him off, ducking under his desk to seemingly reach one of the drawers and pull out a letter.
Draco quickly unshrinks a small bowl he had brought with him, and dumps the Murtlap essence in it, before gently lowering Potter’s hand into it. He is still disturbingly still, too.
Chapter warnings for; explicit language, implied/referenced torture, mild alcohol abuse, passing mention of miscarriage.
Sluggish tears run down his face but Harry doesn't even feel like crying.
"We do have a bathroom here," Ron says, quietly, and unlike his usual self. "But there's another one at the end of the corridor too, if you, you know…" he trails off and sets Harry's plate on the desk.
"We weren't hiding things from you on purpose Harry-" Sirius begins but before he can say anything else, the door opens behind him and there's a loud clatter and muttered curse, and suddenly chaos begins anew.
"Let's go rest there," Draco points across the street, at the flickering, red neon letters spelling out the laundry store's name. Twenty-four seven. That means they won't be bothered.
Draco blinks. Once. Twice. He holds Severus' gaze for approximately three seconds, and pretends he doesn’t understand.
He and Ron mess around with some exploding snap cards but then decide to retreat too. Harry feels exhausted and glad that Hedwig is already sleeping in her cage, he keeps in mind to let her out tomorrow.
Next update on Saturday, 12th September.
At some point, Draco’s closed his eyes too. If this is all a pain-induced hallucination, he still wants to make the most of it.
She fidgets, "I can't really lend a room without an identification--"
“Do you want more?” Draco asks. Harry opens his mouth, then winces, shaking his head.
"That would be enough, Minister," says a man in his thirties, with honey-colored hair and dark red robes, almost the shade of blood. Both men look rather small in the imposing office, Fudge looks comically tiny behind his desk, pretending to arrange papers as cameras flash for the interview.
Severus unwraps the bandages manually, and Draco opens his mouth, but Severus cuts him off, “I’d rather avoid magic as much as possible.”
"If you say so, Malfoy," he is now cradling his right arm against his chest. Draco peers at him, trying to make out if he is in any pain, but Potter’s face is relaxed.
She's not looking but Harry shakes his head nonetheless. He resists a slight shudder as he thinks about
Remus ignores him and continues speaking, "You know how to teach people hard stuff in a short amount of time. You taught James and…” He clears his throat, “Him, how to turn into an Animagus in six months."
Severus grips the note and stares up at the ceiling, wishing it could give him some more answers. All of that pain and trouble and misery and death, and they still have the exact same amount of Horcruxes to find as before.
"Yes, sir?" He sounds almost too polite. The previous hostility hasn't disappeared yet, then. Not that Draco expected it to. He just thought Harry might get distracted from it sooner or later. He is good at it.
"I keep forgetting that you weren't a part of my life before. It's such a weird feeling."
This work does NOT undermine or question the difficulty people go through when depressed,  having a difficult time, or feeling suicidal. We are trying our HARDEST to handle this delicate matter with the grace it deserves.
Next update on 24th September, Friday.
Harry kisses him on the cheek. "It will be fine. I'll be quiet. I promise it'll be easy. Go now."
He waves his hand at John as if he had just told him a funny joke, "Of course this is the work of a Death Eater, sir," the tone is ridiculously condescending. "I have had reports of the mark myself. But there's no reason to chalk this up as an organized attack."
It doesn't. It's not, and that's infuriating enough on itself. Draco has no abstract concept of a single thing that goes through Harry's mind, and like an insisting itch on the back of his neck, Draco has the strongest urge to delve and immerse himself in the mystery. He needs a key to Harry Potter.
"You are hopeless. Beyond hopeless at this, Potter." Draco grumbles as he vanishes the sullied liquid and shrinks the bowl down.
taking any responsibility.
The thing was, that Albus had called Minerva over for some sort of hunt, Remus wasn't really listening, and Minerva was awfully worried that two of her fifth year Gryffindors were going to abuse that absence.
He just needs to find the stream.
(See the end of the chapter for
His heart sinks when he wakes up to an empty bed. Logically, he knows that Harry could have woken up early and is making breakfast, but the possibility is so laughably tiny, that Draco doesn’t really consider it. The other side of the bed is cold, and the cottage doesn’t smell of Harry’s cooking. There’s no humming sound coming from downstairs.
Thanks a world to our beta! We hope you like this chapter everyone!
"I missed you," he says and then flops on his back, he is soon joined by Hermione plopping down next to him, her hair brushing against Harry's face, and then Ron too, a bit awkwardly, on his other side. They all watch the bed's canopy as Harry quickly gives them a short summary of his summer holidays and the dementor attack. He learns that his 'kidnapper' had been Kingsley Shacklebolt, an Order member and a ministry Auror.
He looks at the door, swallows harshly, and walks over to it barefoot. The chill of the floor is almost comforting.
Unease rises up in Harry's throat, and he's about to say something when Malfoy shakes his head and starts wiping away at the cuts. Still bleeding sluggishly.
"What are you doing?" He winces when he has to crouch. The fire had died down sometime while they slept. The barn is dark and the moonlight isn’t enough to see clearly. He can’t see what Harry’s doing.
"A tiger?" Draco asks absently, too busy relishing in the way Harry snuggles up to him. God forbid, anyone, particularly his classmates catching him
It's Tonks and Bill, he realises. The voices are more discernible now, and he can make out what they're saying.
*Due to our heavy schedules, and busy hours, the updates will be back to every alternate Saturday once more, terribly sorry for the wait. ;)
That was awful. So awful indeed that Harry wants to pour bleach into his eyes or down his ears just to get the images and the sounds out of his head.
Draco shrugs with his good shoulder. "It doesn't hurt too much anymore." Now that's one upside to binging on pain potions, Severus's in particular, highly effective and rarely addictive. Draco still has no idea how the man does it.
Interlude Warnings for; explicit language, torture (hinted at), Umbridge, which should come with her own warning.
The woman nods and slides a key over to them, a faded keychain reading the words
Sometimes, he also wonders whether the whole thing in the graveyard too had been nothing but a nightmare. Maybe Voldemort isn't back. Maybe everything is just an awfully long dream.
"I'm sorry." There's nothing else he can say.
Severus shakes his head. "No. Potter and I are going to talk. Upstairs."
Draco wants to get out of the barn and as far away from that rusty fucking nail as possible. He wants to shake Harry awake but if the nail couldn’t do it, how the fuck could he. His ears are ringing and he can not think anymore. He keeps dragging Harry until they’re back on the hay and sitting atop Draco’s cloak.
"You have the intelligence of a toad, Dolohov," Rosier sneers, his mouth dramatically curled down to show his displeasure with the other man as he rolls on the heels of his feet to face him.
Then Harry is leaning forward and Draco stops breathing. Harry is leaning forward, towards Draco’s face and he’s frozen for a moment. He can’t, this can’t be happening.
It takes Draco a moment to catch on. He never had that problem with other people before, never had any issues understanding them, or hell, even reading between the lines of their faces, their deepest, darkest secrets. But Harry Bloody Potter is a first in everything so far.
"You've been holding up for five days," he points out.
you're not crazy. You're getting boring, Harry.'
"Go on, professor," he replies.
he's not claustrophobic but even his adapting skills couldn't have prepared him for this sensation.
“A hungry one,” Draco smirks at him, a weak one, but a smirk nonetheless. “How do you feel about fruit and milk for breakfast? No stove, no burning,” Draco used to have that sometimes, when he was a kid. Not because food had been burnt or anything, but because he liked the way Twinky sometimes prepared the milk with honey. Their little secret.
Severus gives no warning as he starts tipping the contents of the vial onto his shoulder in a small trickle, and Draco's eyes water at the burning sting. He tries glaring at Severys for the lack of a heads up, but he's too busy clutching at his discarded shirt to keep from crying out.
"Get him out of my sight."
"You're great," Draco repeats, his voice dry and his eyebrows quirk.
"And can you fathom what's worse, Evan?" comes the gentle coo in sync with Nagini's flickering tongue near Evan's neck, right where Voldemort's foot rested only a minute ago. Evan weeps.
"Then what would you call this incident? It seems that the targets were ambushed in a muggle mall, there are claims of a dark mark hovering over the bodies for hours, and Obliviators were sent to the scene."
Draco opens his mouth. Then closes it. He can't conjure a mental image of that in any way. "Is the petrol charmed?"
Harry lifts a shaking hand to Draco’s shoulder and grasps it in a pathetically weak grip, “Draco, Draco, wake up, it’s a dream,” he murmurs quietly into his ears, trying not to be loud. It’s not hard, given he can’t really do much more than produce a hoarse squeak from his throat anyway.
likes, and then beckons him closer.
“I thought we agreed to keep you away from the milk?”
"Not charmed. It's not magic. It's just refined oil."
going to let interhouse rivalries ruin this. “Same as all of you--"
He tilts his head to the side, “Really, Potter? Your love life is pretty much irredeemable at this point, no matter how many times you try that ritual.”
"Stop it, you two! And to bed with you as well, we have a lot of cleaning to do tomorrow."
"I'm so sorry."
"Come now, Val. Admitting to boredom is no fatal weakness."
The first and most obvious one, is that Harry’s pain limit has reached a new, unexplored high that he’s not sure anyone has ever reached yet in the history of the human kind. It’s a raw, unfiltered kind of pain that Harry’s mind only perceives as pure static, blasting into his ears, and rupturing his eardrums at an alarming rate. He’s not sure whether there’s a level of pain above this one. He’s not sure whether he wants to know.
Sirius raises his eyebrow at him, "I have it on good authority that you're lying," his head rolls over the headrest to meet Remy's gaze, "Three times you've wanted me to specifically do you a favour."
It had all felt so raw. So real. He can still hear the screams echoing around in his head and the flashes of curses. The blinding green light of the
Draco mutely follows, scarcely catching Harry mildly scowling at the man's back in something akin to grudging distrust, before his face is blocked by a chalky wall and the pasted sea shells.
"It's true,” Draco says, shooting Harry a look to shut him up, “It barely lasts him an hour before he burns through a vial."
"Potter, your hand looks poisoned."
"But how?"
"The Malfoy Manor!"
A bit of the potion dribbles down his cheeks and Severus is just about to spell it directly into his stomach when Potter’s grip tightens on it and his head lifts up a fraction. Severus nods.
They abandon the alleyway and walk, it's cloudy above their heads, and the neon lights flicker all around them, the pavement is damp.
He knew he could. Harry’s a fucking twig compared to Draco, and Draco isn’t exactly bulky. It’d kill his legs, but it’d make him feel better. But the truth of the matter is, Harry would never accept it. He didn't last time- not knowingly anyway-, and he won't now.
There's shifting behind him, and the woman finally steps in his sight, masked, but still imposing. She crosses her arms.
"Do you have any available rooms?" Draco asks and is proud of the way his voice doesn’t wobble. He knows what they look like. Two dirty, homeless teenagers, more criminal than the victim, clad in soaked clothes. If the woman somehow finds something fishy with them, she probably won’t let them stay.
Kingsley hides a frown. They don't have time for small talk. "Overwhelmed by paperwork, Minister," he hopes that the man gets a hint quickly enough, Kingsley really doesn't have the time, nor the patience for a social visit.
to the floo. If Draco and I don't make it, you are under explicit orders to floo to the headquarters. But if we are together, then I'll take charge. If I say 'run'. You run. You don't linger or look back or more people die. Do you understand?"
They couldn't have drowned.
A sense of wrongness permeates from the air, the same one that the Manor’s ballroom seemed to have been seeped in for weeks after his mother was murdered there.
Severus’s voice is more urgent as he continues, “Potter, we need to get out of here. Stop being difficult. Can you stand?”
Potter promptly collapses back on the floor.
"He's skirting around the issue," Sinistra interjects, looking up from her mug.
Honestly, at this point, he’s just relieved that Harry hasn’t… gone away in a while. This morning was scary. While he could handle these episodes from him in the safety of Shell Cottage, they couldn’t afford to be distracted here.
But if it isn’t a joke, then it means Harry has been taken. He's been taken from right under his nose, and Draco hadn't known. Hadn't heard anything.
But this is painful to watch.
"She had this Quill, and she kept assigning me detentions for stupid things, then she made me write with the Quill on the parchment until the lesson had
"Good." Harry dumps the carrots into a pot and then runs it under the tap, dispassionately waiting for it to fill up.
like his hands are shaking, he is steady as he pulls out a bottle of Firewhiskey.
All in all, we are trying our very best to raise awareness about serious issues, as realistically as possible, and we promise that your concerns will be addressed to the best of our abilities, especially as the story progresses.
He spends the rest of the day lazily going through his chores. Not even completing half of them, but most of them had been pointless anyway. If he cleaned the damned floor once more, he'd rub the tiles right off.
He thinks about his time in Barns Green in West Sussex. One of the rare occasions when his parents had indulged in one of his fixations. They’d gone to a farm to see beehives and honey collections. It’d been run by a squib.
"As I was saying,” she juts out her chin and speaks more evenly, “We need to learn things that'll actually help us out with our O.W.Ls
Severus hums, “And Potter has been changing your bandages and taking care of the wound adequately?”
They don't talk for a long time.
He doesn’t wait for her response, turns around and strides away instead, his stomach churning a little unpleasantly at the thought of the words that rang too close to home, even for him.
He waits for the boy to elaborate and Harry pouts as he dumps the pot on the stove. "To the beach. Like, my relatives took their kid every summer. Dudley," He waves a hand, as if his dead cousin's name is of any value to Draco, "They made me go to a safe house in a deserted island once, I was honestly too tired to see much."
"Chicken pie?” Draco blinks, thoughts of kisses fleeing at the absurdity, “In what world is that a term of endearment?"
Next update on 22nd January, Friday.
"Well then, perhaps, you should be off a bit early today." She waves a hand. "Come over here so I can inspect your hand,"
"The dark lord is the one who did this," Severus repeats, "You were merely an onlooker. Potter, I can vouch with utter certainty, that you weren't responsible for any deaths."
"They were watching him already! A bloody Auror was tailing the boy!"
"Fraternizing with the enemy?" she continues, and Draco stiffens. Enemy? He knows that she hates Potter, but enemy is a strong word, certainly? Unless-
"That's odd." Filius voices everyone's thoughts.
Harry shakes his head, "Come on, don't say that."
"Maybe."
This is not a dream.
“I do,” Potter says, wringing his hands nervously, “Is he going to be okay?”
“No,” Harry’s voice is high and squeaky, not a good sign. He also sounds uncertain. Which Draco can use to his advantage. They can’t… afford to be picky right now. Not when they have no idea what’s going to happen next.
'Are you sure he loves you?'
"Sort of," Harry tells him, his voice is so patient, so gentle, "They put this liquid, called petrol, into the car, and it powers the engine, and makes the wheels move."
(See the end of the chapter for
That doesn't sound right, Kingsley thinks. "He didn't send an owl?"
with them.
"There's a man who can help us. Slughorn. We'll go to him."
"Hem. Hem," There's that irritating clearing of her throat and Harry pauses four words and two letters in, five vowels and nine consonants. He looks up.
Slughorn’s eyes rake over both of them, before he nods, "There's something of yours that you need to retrieve from me, old man."
“What--” Draco starts, only to stop and swallow when his mouth feels too dry.
Draco winces, then stops as it hurts, “I guess.”
“You’re not forgiven.” she huffs at him, firmly trying to pull her forearm out of his grasp.
"My guilt just magically disappeared," he says, and there’s a bit of ice cream smudged on his lips. If they weren’t in such a public place, Draco would’ve kissed and licked and sucked it off his lips. He clears his throat and crams his spoon in his mouth.
By the time the vial is empty, Draco is gasping and his fingers are cramped from clutching too tightly at his now wrinkled shirt.
Even though Valentina just helped them, she’s still a Death Eater, one of Voldemort’s best. And it could just be a trap. She told him not to use magic.
Only as he looks down at the dark blue grass crunching beneath his feet, does Harry realize that this place might be the most magical place he has ever been to, and the irony of it, the fact that the most magical place he has ever seen only exists in a distant place that is only in his head, is not lost on him.
"Be very careful about the words you're going to choose next, Potter." Draco has no qualms about hurting Potter, in fact, he has been craving to hurt
Time moves jarringly. Not in seconds, but in hazed moments.
"But you also saved my life,” Harry cuts him off firmly, “And got kidnapped for me, and then you saved me again… also I probably vomited all over you several times," he smiles sheepishly, the flush is back on his face.
Draco's tongue turns leaden in his mouth and he gasps for breath. This… is some sick joke. Because Harry can’t be gone. Except Harry wouldn’t be so cruel. Even if he doesn’t like Draco back, he'd never be so cruel.
Umbridge steps closer, her heels dully clicking as she gets closer. Harry cannot do anything but stare at Malfoy's face, his eyes just as wide and his bandaged hand clenched.
"We'll find Tattershall, it can't be that far. He can help us, and…" he runs his hand through Draco's hair, and he feels so fucking guilty for enjoying it, and being calmed by it. "And even if he doesn't, we'll think of something. I promise."
“Twinky knows sir, Harry Potter, must really keep his voice down,”
kidnapped Harry in the first place.
He's surprised by it but decides to embrace it like an old friend. It’s better than being a sitting duck and letting things happen to him.
It's dark too soon for his tastes and Harry's reseller energy tapers off quickly, so rapidly that he almost falls face-first into the sidewalk before Draco catches him.
His cheeks are flushed, and a small smile quirks his lips. His eyes are still worried, and the tears haven’t yet fully dried from either of their faces. His face is still close enough for Draco to be able to feel his warm breath on his face.
"What?" He hadn’t meant for his voice to come out like that, squeaky and high.
Moody, unsurprisingly, is the first one to speak, "Well, would you look at that?" he looks as if he wants to smack both Bill and Tonks upside the head. "The kid overheard you two yapping."
She didn't get to be who she is for no reason.
"It is so fucking fun. Haven't you ever had cheese puffs? Licking off the cheese dust is the whole point,"
"All the things we could get up to," Draco drawls.
"I will skin you," Draco replies blandly as he continues running his hands up and down Harry’s arms. In spite of the warmth, Harry’s so cold, and bony, and Draco’s hands aren’t much better. Still, Harry seems to like it. Harry is currently sitting between his legs, with his back against Draco’s chest. The contact sends a burst of warmth through his stomach, like taking a sip of hot chocolate on a cold, snowy December evening, except the feeling never ends.
Draco wrinkles his nose, "Ew, no. Believe it or not, I am perfectly content with my own name,
Draco stifles a shudder. He thanks Merlin every day that his godfather shows too many antisocial behaviors and straitlaced ruthlessness to bother and antagonize other people. Merlin knows how the suicide count would have risen if that weren't the case. Even Draco's father had less bite than Severus.
"No one is aware of the instructions. None of my vials have been missing either. Trust me, Potter, no one can make this poison the way I do. I recognize my work."
Stay safe and tell us what scene struck you the most.
"Harry, please just give us a chance to explain,"
When did he screw up so badly?
??" Rosier punctuates his word with a swift kick to Harry's abdomen. Harry's too winded to make a sound. "This isn't about him, Potter. This is just between you-" Another kick. "-and me."
it. Harry digs the heels of his hands into his eyes; they
‘She is only eight, Lucius,’ Draco could practically hear his mother rolling her eyes. ‘I think Valentina would wait a few years before handing her a dagger and letting her into the wild,’
He looks at the window, remembering how once he'd been small enough to fit through it, to get into the Weasley's enchanted car and fly away.
He barely has time to lift his wand, let alone put up a shield himself, when she says, her voice impossibly stable and vindictive, "Crucio,"
Draco feels pretty useless, but he doesn’t know the first thing about cooking, he never needed to. Malfoy Manor had their fair share of house elves to do that for him, he doesn't have the slightest concept of what to do with raw ingredients.
' See if you can throw up on Umbridge's plate. It's better than whatever garbage she's eating, ' Harry chokes on the apple and imaginary Sirius cackles, smacking the table as he laughs.
“You need shoes,” Draco says, and Harry stiffens. Draco looks around the crypt urgently, foolishly, as if waiting for a pair of shoes to pop up any second out of nowhere.
"What else am I supposed to do, Molly?!" Sirius yells back at Mrs. Weasley who has a steaming pot trailing behind her, her wand suspending it in the air, out of the way.
Then he notices that the warmth is really comfortable. He could just close his eyes and fall asleep there if he wanted. If it weren’t for the infernal pain still coursing through his veins, not as bad as before, but noticeable.
The forest is new. Refreshingly so. Harry had no idea that his mind could be expanded across such new realms before, create something so magical, and yet out of place. He needs to explore it more, once he has the time. If he gets to have the time that is.
With a frown, Harry realizes that all the letters Ron and Hermione had sent to him had been cryptic as hell. Vague and not actually giving him any information. It was as if they were ignoring his letters, in which he kept asking them about the Wizarding World situation. What was Voldemort doing? What was happening? Were they all alright? Were they hiding something?
Remus smiles and strides to stand before his best friend. "We weren't supposed to speak of that day ever again."
"But you and Pansy… and Blaise hung out a lot, even Crabbe and Goyle--"
His feet hit the ground. He checks over himself and is relieved to find all his extremities intact. Blowing out a loud exhale, he doesn’t waste any time in grabbing one of the leather satchels hanging off of the hook near the door.
He looks up at Harry. The boy he risked everything for. Not once, but twice now. There had been no hesitation, nothing holding him back but concern for Harry that made him do this. The reason for his splinched and bleeding shoulder. He doesn’t even know how bad it exactly is yet, and is sort of afraid to see it. He doesn't care how bad. All that matters is that Rosier is dead and Harry is here.
Draco has no idea what magic muggles use to make the cars run. The ones from the ministry are charmed, he's only seen one from afar. It only made sense if muggles use charmed cars too.
John never breaks eye contact with the man as he's speaking, and Fudge does the same, carefully uttering each word as if it's a carefully rehearsed speech he has been preparing for in front of a mirror all day.
Harry clenches his teeth, and then slowly loosens his jaw, counting backwards from twenty. "He's kind of like you, but different. He's real, Sirius. I swear to God, he is so real. I don't think--"
"I knew you wouldn't resist a dramatic end," the woman growled, kicking Harry's wand away from the man's hand. "Edward's bones incite you, don't they?"
Harry wonders how a memory that he doesn't even remember having can be one of his worst.
“It’s fine,” Draco mutters, still staring at the wand. His father had kept it. He’d thought that the Dark Lord, or perhaps Bellatrix, would have snapped it. But no, father had kept this, and he’d given it to him. Tears prick his eyes, both his father and mother were dead. And all that he had of them right now was this wand. Not really a relic but also a stark reminder of what had happened.
"I liked it there. It was small, quiet and warm. They turned the lights off, so it was dark too and it was… Just me. Me being with myself. I liked that."
Elen and I worked very hard on plotting this fic, every little detail is accounted for to drive the story forward and present enjoyable reading material. That being said, Harry and Draco's relationship might seem like it's on a slow burner for now, but all will be rectified very soon.
Draco smiles, "I'm glad we see eye to eye. What do I need to fill?"
"Is it only the Auror department?"
The weather keeps getting colder, and Harry decides it's time he got back to Privet Drive. He frowns as he walks. It's only July, normally by this time of the month even asphalt starts baking in the streets.
Draco narrows his eyes,
Draco sneers at himself. It's not about the alcohol. Of course, it's not fucking about that. Potter hates him. He rejected him, pulled away and ran from Draco. To get away from him.
He feels Harry stiffen beside him, but continues on, as confidently as possible, "No. Just us. One room, if possible."
“I’m not sure?” Potter’s voice is timid, as if expecting to be yelled at. Severus sighs. He keeps forgetting to be gentle with the boy. He avoids Potter's eyes and summons a muggle style paper and pen.
"You're just going to take the credit!"
Fudge opens his mouth and then closes it for a moment. "Well yes, yes. It's not that I'm implying anything, Auror Shacklebolt. But I also happen to have your floo location history on hand as well, and you seem to have used your floo to contact the headmaster on the following day after the incident."
That is hilariously the first thing that comes to Draco's mind. He's had the words, the dinner, the touch, but in his haste to actually get the ordeal over and done with, he forgot the most important factor.
Potter rolls his eyes at him. "Well, you're more than welcome to use any other bathrooms at your leisure," he says. "This one isn't in use anyway."
"So you better cry in secret," Potter continues, face contorted in disgust. Myrtle’s ghost appears behind him before flickering out again. "Because no one is going to spare you any sympathy."
He shivers in the cool breeze before his head whips around towards the backdoor. Harry isn’t on the porch, but the door is half ajar. Heart in his throat, he quickly pads over outside, frantically looking around.
"Never do business with a thief, Draco. Not even if not doing so endangers your pride."
"With Tonks. She shrunk it. The portkey is activating soon, Harry. Moody?"
Draco tightens his grip on Harry, "Because I'm… french? I mean I was born here, but the Malfoy family is inherently french."
"Shhh, don't cry. I won't be quick, and it won't be painless, but you'll have fun."
Malfoy.
"Yeah something like that," he hadn't come here for company, he needs the exact opposite of that, but he figures that he cannot escape that easily just yet. 'Just grab a glass of water and then bail after another apology,' he orders himself. That should be good enough for them.
It's a futile thought and he knows it. The nightmares don't care whether he is exhausted or not, after all, they just ram their ugly heads in uninvited and refuse to leave, as if just to spite him. They wait until he's asleep and won't let up until he's screaming himself awake. They torment Harry with their dark, looming presence, which doesn't abate even with consciousness. They're always there, lurking on the edge of his vision, always hovering over his shoulder.
"For what it's worth, I'm glad the muggles are gone,” Harry looks up at him at that, mildly surprised, and Ron grins toothily back at him, “Personally speaking.” he shrugs, “That fat pig of a cousin always irked me."
There’s a loud crack which makes him flinch. They can’t be here, they need to leave. Get as far away from this place as possible.
Rosier is with him. Right behind him, Harry can feel the man getting to his feet, but he doesn't move, Harry bows his head and clenches his eyes shut. He needs to wait for the right moment.
'Harry,' Sirius looks at him. 'Focus,'
Title drop! Also, word of caution, suicide warning for anyone who wants to listen to the title song and/or watch the music video. (Talk Me Down)
Belatedly, he realises he’s still got Harry’s wrist in his grasp. But he doesn’t let go just yet. It’s warm, his wrist, which should be impossible because Draco’s own hand is ice cold. He can feel the pulse thumping unsteadily beneath his fingers.
Draco pats his cheek again, “Potter,” his pats get slightly rougher as Draco starts panicking a little, “Potter, wake up.”

The noise is loud. And the door blasts open as Nott and Avery stand there, red faced and panting.

If it had been any other occasion, Harry might have even enjoyed the scenery, it was all very minimalistic, but at the same time, Harry got the impression that Market Deeping was a page out of a fairytale town directory.
“Potter?” he murmurs, poking the boy’s cheek. “Potter!”
"I do. I was there." The image plays over in his mind whenever he is idle. Whenever he can’t think of something to occupy himself with. But he’s not drinking himself halfway to death.
Harry's eyes snap up, staring back into his, clear and filled with expression.
A murmured charm later, Harry opens the note again and skims over the content;
Draco knows, he just knows that he is waiting for the other shoe to drop.
He turns around, pressing his back to the door, a small childish part of him hoping that it would give away under his scrawny body.
Harry throws him a slightly worried look before saying, “Moody came here the first day we arrived," he shrugs, "You were, um, unconscious.”
He might have felt guilty for hiding something this big from Harry, but given the circumstances and Harry’s ridiculous guilt complex, he can’t find it in himself. He still doesn’t know what the curse is. If it’s reversible. How it’s reversible. It
Draco stomps a little on the bloodied ground, until no blood is visible through the dark mud.
"You are treating this way more rationally than I thought you were going to."
Just…
Next update on 2nd July, Friday, although keep a look out for another interlude on 25th June!
"FILTHY BLOOD! SUCH A DISGRACE, UTTER BETRAYAL. OF MY OWN BLOOD NO LESS!"
Ron waits for the right time to approach Harry, about eight in the evening that night after they've already had dinner and Hermione has gone off to her dorm to nap, something about a stomach cramp, Ron keeps in mind to bring her something from his secret chocolate frog stash tomorrow morning, that would improve her mood a lot.
"I'll run your blood over his coffin in respect. After all, he is being awfully magnanimous for letting me have my fun here," he lets the curse up for a moment, then it's back again. Like a dripping tap, the intermittent pauses are annoying Harry to bits.
She flicks one eyebrow, her back remains rigid and straight, her shoulders--as fucking always-- are broad and confident. If such a thing could even be said about a pair of shoulders.
Harry really needs to get a rein over imaginary Sirius. Soon.
"Settle down," he says as he presses the back of his hand to Draco's glistening forehead. He's too warm for comfort. Severus has to take care of that after he has gotten the boys out of here. For now, a mild fever reducer would do.
“It’s fine.”
"Nope," Draco says, popping the ‘p’. It was uncouth, but he hasn’t had the time to be the proper pureblood wizard for a while now.
Draco is fine. Physically, way better than Harry. And mentally...well. All Draco has to show for his troubles is his mutilated shoulder.
He takes one of Harry’s hands, wraps it around his shoulder and presses the palm against the wound. Harry resists when Draco whimpers in pain.
"It's really not," Moody grumbles but quietens down otherwise.
"You know what it says already. It's Regulus. Drink," he says sharply. Albus shakes his head.
Merlin and Circe damn Greyback. Damn him to the nine depths of hell for doing this to Narcissa's son, to Severus'
"Obviously," Harry says dryly, and his lips thin a bit.
"Good morning," Harry mutters to his owl, lazily reaching a finger for Hedwig to nibble on. Hedwig hoots around his finger, her feathers slightly ruffled from the windy flight. She looks famished. Harry supposes he should send her out to hunt since Uncle Vernon isn't here to pop a vein over Hedwig anymore.
The scarier thought is that
He floos to the Salamander's clave and then immediately apparates to the cottage, unceremoniously, because he doesn't have the capacity to be patient with himself, with Potter or even his own Godson.
Harry flushes a little. They are mostly for Draco because he was being a git, but the blonde doesn’t even hate boiled carrots. Maybe he should serve them cold and soggy to him later.
Draco doesn't doubt it. But he knows that his only satisfaction at this moment is humiliating the vulgar, repulsive figure before him. "You wouldn't know either. You're not even worthy enough to bear his mark." he smirks. "You're his bitch,"
"How the bloody hell should I know?" Rosier ignores him.
“Draco? Draco, can you hear me?”
Fine. That is way higher than 'okay'. A few notches under Great.
“I know
Evan walks in and immediately bows, sinking to one knee gracefully.
Draco sniffs, these cars, and bikes. He hates them, and to have a whole truck, a
"I don't have anything else for you at the moment," he stands and turns to face a glaring Potter.
"Change out of those before you touch any food," she barks, and Harry nods, turning away before she clears her throat.
“Harry,” he calls out again, this time a little quieter.
There are two wands over there. Two. He’d thought he’d left his wand in Umbridge’s office, and he didn’t have a clue about Harry’s. Are those spare wands? They won’t work very well, but at least they won’t be defenceless. He gets up and walks over to the table with a slight sense of dread; better give them a try.
Harry gulps, clenches his hands and looks at Draco again, he cannot freak out, he wants to, really really wants to but he won't, because for the second time in his life,  he feels as if a force he can only describe as ‘Draco Malfoy’ had sneaked up on him on his rooftop once more. He's on the rooftop, not in the cell, the wind whips against his face and his hands aren't shaking. He's standing on the ledge, only an inch away, the crowd bustling beneath his feet before the force suddenly propels Harry off the rooftop again, and this time, instead of falling headfirst into an endless sea of crowds, Harry isn’t falling at all. Instead, he is in a place he has never been before.
Remus knows Sirius Black more than he knows anyone else. Not like the back of his hand, but rather the veins leading to his heart, like every coherent word in his mind, and every moon cycle day to day.
"Yes, well… this
Squishy, smelly muggles with gory entrails and no ferocity whatsoever in the face of a blast. Dead. Easy. Finished.
Before his clothes, he heads for the loose floorboards. Tonks throws Harry's beat-up wardrobe open without a word and flicks her wand, quickly folding the clothes into two piles on Harry's unmade bed.
"You do that a lot, you know," Draco says casually.
"Was that all?" Remus is asking as he runs downstairs, disrupting Harry's thoughts. Out of the three of them, Remus seems the most frantic; Harry momentarily wonders why. He nods at Remus and holds Hedwig close to his chest.
"Take a pain reliever. Another," Harry pulls the bag between them, lips pursed into an invisible line.
Mrs. Weasley smiles. "Great! I'll send you up a plate too, in case you felt like eating later. Ronnie does it all the time,"
Potter frowns a little at the unfamiliar wand before taking them with a nod, “Okay, yes. Yeah, I get it.”
So Draco just sighs and watches Harry beat the eggs, a pan heating on the stove, Draco's fingers are interlaced under his chin as he rests his elbows on the table. Very inelegant etiquette, but he doesn’t think Harry would really care.
Not technically a bit. It seemed as if his best friend has turned into a mobile whiskey bottle. Rude, drunk and abrasive.
He is in so much pain, that he is more than sure that his body isn't registering the majority out of sheer overwhelmed senses. He might die of shock right on the spot, except… his lord wouldn't allow that. Not just yet. If he wanted Evan dead, he would already be in the same predicament as Lucius Malfoy, or served as a meal to that hateful pet Snake.
Draco exchanges a glance between the water bottles and Harry's pale face, pale but dotted red from the cold.
He's been taking charge all day, just a calm constant as Draco panicked over the smallest things. Harry just stayed calm and collected. He found them food and water.
"I think I mentioned my lack of social skills,” Draco counters drily, “You insulting me in front of Crabbe and Goyle didn't help your case either."
As always, thanks a bunch to our wonderful, one-of-a-kind beta, Amar! He always makes our chapters so much better, and making us write our best. He’s one of our most invested readers and we love him! XD
"The bleeding," Draco suddenly mutters, he wants to smack himself. "Why didn't I catch that sooner?!"
“No, don’t get up,” he pushes the other boy back down, as gently as he can. “It’s going to hurt a lot, because we left them untreated, I’m so sorry, they look infected. We need help, like proper medical help, Draco.”
Harry blinks at Draco’s disgruntled state, "Like forty minutes?"
Severus sometimes thinks Morris had it easy. Following his loved one into death. Maybe not soon, but soon enough. To not live long enough to see all these failures pile up, to see the Dark Lord rise again.
Probably nothing. Hopefully nothing.
"The salve?" Draco asks, hating himself for it. He knows it won't really help, and he'd said as much. But the possibility of reducing the scarring even by a meager two percent was better than nothing.
The water feels blessed on his tongue and throat and his mind too. Harry makes him drink half of the bottle against his vehement protests.
He vaguely remembers murmuring to Harry to hold on tight, and then he’s twirling his wand and turning.
before making their way to a generally dry patch. The barn is drafty, but still marginally better than being out on a windy November night.
He has the sudden urge to laugh hysterically, because of course it happened. Of course the very thing he feared has happened. He's been discovered by a Death Eater and she is probably going to kill him now. No one will know. Just like no one knows about his mother.
A fucking moron could blood trace them using the trail.
"No. You're not coming," Aunt Petunia drops her rag with a curl of her lip. "You're staying here, boy,"
Harry slams the bathroom door in his face, and an ugly picture frame rattles on the wall.
He walks over to a bench. The pieces of cheap paint on metal are rusting and peeling off in some places, but he sits down anyway. He scratches some of the paint chips with his fingernails, idly glancing around the playground.
"Me and teaching?"
"I think so as well," Harry would pay an unimaginable sum of money to watch this woman get devoured by a group of ruthless hungry cats. Anything.
He retches again.
"Good night Harry," Ron says around a huge yawn breaking his face.
“I know,” Draco tries to muster up a scowl, but fails, brows pinching together in pain.
By seven thirty, Harry really cannot do this anymore.  His other hand has reached a delicate point that goes past pain, into a very disconcerting numbing sensation that's slowly creeping up his wrist, beyond the small pool of blood. The parchment is nearly coming to its end and finally,
"You couldn't say the same for us,” he continues, “We very much would've died without that money. And we are carrying our entire life in that one bag right now."
Pomona scowls, the expression out of place on the usually gentle-mannered woman, "I don't think he can be blamed for that. That woman is intolerable!"
"This isn't your fault. This is my fault. And I don't want to hear you say otherwise."
Snape was there, standing next to a chuckling- considerably taller- Harry, standing with his hands locked behind his back and his face completely stoic. A statue probably would have shown more emotion than that man.
"Hmm?"
He's Pavlov's dog, and the curse just keeps coming and going and
"I wanted this too,” Harry pats his hand thoughtfully, “I never knew I wanted it with you, never in a million years. But, yeah. Also, you're nowhere near a sewage rat. You're like a tiger, if we're in the realm of animal symbolism."
He doesn't speak, Draco doesn't prompt him to. He doesn't know what happened with Rosier, Harry seems too tired to even articulate properly. They need rest.
Wouldn’t that be a wonderful way to go?
He pulls Potter, as gently but as hurriedly as he can manage and leans him against the wall, then crouches down to retrieve a mumbling Draco.
Sirius gives him a sad smile, “'I worry about you, kiddo.'
"They're people," Harry doesn't sound frustrated, not even annoyed. Just tired. So tired that he might fall asleep on the spot and Draco does
Draco. Harry can only think about one person at that moment and it's maddeningly Draco. He wanted to kiss Harry, he cooked for Harry, slept with Harry, comforted Harry…
Draco's first impulse, right in tandem with his panicking, is to cast the spell again, to get to where Harry is as fast as possible.
He's asleep, but he tried to kill himself.
He’s thought about this. But running away didn’t work. So… "Then I'll die. But I can't die, not knowing how it felt like to be with him…” he can’t do this.
"What did you just say?" He asks without turning.
Harry squeezes his hand and they walk.
Potter’s finger closes around the quill, and only a beat later, they’re pulled by their navels, disappearing on the spot once again.
Harry never knew there would come a day where he'd prefer him like that.
"We don't have a second Tonks, Kingsley said-"
The woman in mask strides closer, and Rosier raises Harry's wand but she's too quick. Harry isn't exactly sure what's going on, because one moment they're just standing, and the next Rosier is kneeling next to Harry clutching his hand and howling in pain.
This only makes Harry more sick, and he gives up on breakfast, he pushes the bowl away and wriggles to make some room between his two friends, squashing him between themselves as they're quietly discussing the paper still.
Hermione clenches her fists, Harry is a human being. Not some-- not some-
"Yes well… It's regarding the day the Potter boy ran away from his home. About a month ago? That entire show he threw about Dementors attacking him," the man gestures wildly with his hands and chuckles, staring at Shacklebolt to do the same. Kingsley flashes a dim smile and Fudge stills, clearing his throat before tapping his desk.
around the room, anything to just shut the damn cats up, they might not be the sole reason for the pulsing in his temples, but they're not helping either. With a sigh, Harry wonders how long it will take for his cuts to close this time.
"When is your next detention?" he asks instead. Draco knows how to choose his battles.
Because it's safe, warmer, and it's pulsing and alive.
"I have a binder."
'Not necessarily. Bitch like her… I'd say it'd be a miracle if she's
"Take a soother," he repeats.
Next Update Saturday, 2nd May.
"Kingsley sent another message," he tells Tonks. "There's another group headed this way,"
The Dark Lord is sat on his throne, set in the middle of the Hall, the one that Malfoys previously used for gatherings, grand and decorated to hold feasts and the best of balls. Evan remembers attending Malfoy's bitch's pregnancy feast only fifteen years ago, as a teenaged boy. It was the talk of family circles for quite a while before the Malfoy brat was born. Now the Hall served a greater cause.
"Harry -"
"Oh, Potter. We are going to have
Sirius' eyes widen like his, 'Fuck, Fuck, Fuck!'
We in no way support her words or ideas, we're living in the twenty-first century. Not the 1500s.
There is a birthmark below the left side of his collarbone. Draco has always hated it. It’s a halfmoon shape, the colour of rust. He stares at it for a while as Harry works.
Harry grabs his hand again and it all stalls to a halt in Draco's head. The curse words vanish and the panic ebbs, he looks at Harry.
That's as much attention that he can give this right now. And some action would do his friend good.
"Please, Mr. Wallwind," he waves a hand and John settles in the gigantic armchair, feeling as if he's sitting in a dollhouse, playing pretend with Fudge.
Draco grits his teeth. The pain feels blinding, and he knows that is certainly
Theoretically.
"I'm fine," Harry grits out. The woman is looking curiously at them now.
"Knife, and something else, wooden," Harry stuffs his hand back into the bag and emerges with a small wooden box.
Draco moves towards them, pouring half a glass of water for Harry, “C’mon Harry. She won’t hurt you, I’ve known her all my life,” he mumbles.
"This food is for me," Harry says as he picks up one of the toasts. Still, he gives Hedwig more than half of his breakfast, which was only the toast, and then sets her to go hunt in their backyard, wolfing down his breakfast in two bites. Two not very large and not very satisfying bites.
‘You’re panicking, Harry,’ Sirius says from his corner and Harry growls, his trembling hand slipping on the walls as he sinks down to the ground. Even though he’s sitting down, his toes feel on the ledge of the rooftop once more, on the soft gravel.
Harry's eyes are stitched to his shoulder. "I'm so sorry," he says, "This is all my fault, if I hadn't run out--"
Harry regards Bill with narrowed eyes. "Maybe," he finally admits. "But I actually should be heading upstairs."
"She's fine," she replies steadily.
"I don't want you to talk," Harry orders. And then snorts, right. As if Sirius even listens to him anymore. Not a single shred of coherency in his mind belongs to him. Harry is a puppet to the whims of some unknown factor messing around in his brain. Sirius has been corrupted as well.
Dramatic.
He wonders what Regulus and Morris would think of them now. Reggie had been so young, younger than even Severus himself had been when he’d joined. He’d only been eighteen when he died. Morris had lived another eight years before succumbing. Living as a recluse, sickly young man. Living in shame.
"Potter, hang on," that's Moody, grappling for his cane as he pulls himself to his feet, "I'll walk you up,"
give.
"What if the people who lost the money really needed it?" he twists his fingers in his lap. He’s starting to feel really guilty about the ice cream now.
Lucius’ smile doesn’t falter, even as he takes in Draco’s appearance. He steps forward and Draco flinches, it makes Lucius pause. Severus notices Potter tensing up where he is leaning against the wall.
Just last week, he had talked to her, and she had been in all her high chinned, proud Malfoy glory then. Speaking in a voice which was so different from the hoarse screams which had been drawn out of her in the last moments of her life. Almost worse than she had been seeing Draco and Lucius. Lucius, with his dead-eyed stare as he too, did nothing. And Draco,
After they've finished signing the parchment and have received their enchanted Galleons, Hermione has them all exit the pub in groups of three and finally, only she and Ron remain.
Just as nonchalantly as before, even as his mind pressed down on him to mind the ticking seconds and Rosier’s hands on his son, Lucius walked to his fireplace, and the floo flared. He dropped the golden quill into the flame while whispering the location.
(See the end of the chapter for
"No, not even once," he says blandly.
account no less. He will eat right out of the garbage before making Harry cry.
Draco huffs through the pain as they watch the knife gathering black soot and glowing orange.
The chairs look hard and cold. Also, a bright red that Draco abhors on sight.
'You're hurting,’ Sirius says, his gaze intense, almost challenging, ‘Do you know why you are on a train? Do you even know where you are going? Do you know how he found you?'
This is not to say that we're disregarding your views, which we think are perfectly valid; if a relationship/friendship starts feeling like a burden, like 'work', it's better to sever them rather than wait until one or both parties get hurt.
"You hold onto the inkwell, and my arm too alright?" Remus says, shoving the ink well in his hand. He seems to be growing more and more agitated by the second. Harry struggles to handle Hedwig's cage with one arm and holds Remus with the other, confused and somber as Moody and Tonks round the house up.
"Auror Shacklebolt?" The man says, awkwardly fixing the collar of his robes.
"Who?” Sirius scoffs, “James? I bet your right hand that he would want me to do this. In fact, if he were here he would be the one choking me to death. And Harry…” Sirius’ mouth twists bitterly, “Harry deserves a parent figure who can actually be there."
Harry rolls his eyes and heads for the stairs, mulling his aunt's words in his head a few times. Having the weekend for himself could prove useful if she actually meant it when she said that they're not locking him in. He doubts Uncle Vernon was completely on board with the plan, but he must have given in eventually, probably because of the chores.
The voice is too close, so close that Harry feels the person's breath against the back of his neck. He jerks, no one had been around when the Dementors attacked, much less someone who can see Harry pathetically losing to a magical creature. A hand clamps around his arm in an almost bruising grip, it belongs to the same person, and it hauls him up, almost dragging on his knees. Harry quickly grasps the broken remnants of his glasses in his hand, stumbling.
The diagnosis doesn’t reveal much, except abnormal dehydration. Severus purses his lips, confirmation that this is exactly the potion he’d been requested to make, all those years ago. He doesn’t know whether to be relieved or worried. He tends to think about it sometimes, how many deaths and maimings and poisoning he is responsible for due to being the Dark Lord’s Potion master.
Tonight is going to be a long one.
Oh right. Because this is going to hurt like a son of a bitch, and he's going to scream.
"Dave," Harry says, grinning widely.
"Help them.” Remus says, “You can help them and by helping them, you'll be helping Harry."
"We're going to be in so much trouble-" he breathes those words, his lips are inches away from hers, "Breaking all sorts of rules."
It takes Malfoy only a second to right himself, and that familiar sneer is back on his face, “So, Potter,
Harry's eyes are just glazed.
"The same as before, until the lesson has
"Be careful," Harry says as one of the creatures croons under Potter's shaking hand, "Or I'll teach them how to peck the hell out of you."
"I could've cast a numbing spell, but I really don't want to risk interfering."
Draco is an awful son.
His eyes had flicked towards Lucius and then he’d hummed. "Perhaps later."
Cedric's eyes aren't lifeless, staring into nothingness the way only dead people do.
He can’t leave Harry alone. Not when this all is his fault. If he hadn’t so stupidly tried to kiss him, then Harry wouldn’t have run. If he hadn’t run, he wouldn’t have crossed the wards and gotten kidnapped. Harry could be suffering right now. Being tortured.
'Harry!' Sirius is so far away, it seems as if he's not running at all. They were only a few feet apart before Rosier came.
"Calling him by any other name is a foolish oversight."
“They’ll find us!” Draco counters back, his voice hoarse and soft, he’s putting too much weight on Harry. Harry’s injured, he can’t. He shouldn’t. “Underage magic, Harry. They’ll--” he chokes out, “We can’t let them find us.”
"My aunt Petunia once hit me with a wooden spoon because of pickled garlic," Harry casually mentions sometime later, it should have started raining by now but it's not and Draco is grateful.
His eyes scan Harry from head to toe, as he berates himself for falling asleep. He munches on the sandwich and decides that Harry looks healthy and surprisingly bright enough.
"Are you starting a cult?" Draco asks as they enter the house. Words that Draco never thought he'd say, not in a totally non-ironic manner to Harry Potter. But here he is, and so are the seagulls. Inside their safe house.
"What if…"
Draco keeps breathing and Harry shakily follows, Draco’s own breathing eases a little, “You need to actually hold it in your chest for a second,” Harry huffs in response. “Don’t just huff and puff, Potter,” Draco snaps and Harry glares at him, but obliges.
"Merlin," Draco slumps in his seat.
She watches as the door closes behind the last couple, and then slowly turns to Ron, a smile spreading over her face, "We did it. Oh my God, we're actually doing this."
She opens the door for him, her smile an ugly slash across her face, stretching wide and showing too many teeth. "In, Mr. Malfoy."
"I would call it a careless bout of foolishness, John. This is clearly the work of a sole fanatic." Fudge discreetly reaches for another scone, and John watches, only watches for a moment before he can trust himself to speak.
"Draco, I always tell you everything." There’s a small mischievous smile creeping across his face when he holds Draco’s gaze.
He hasn't used the damn thing for so long, that he didn't even think about pulling it on Rosier. He's such a moron, such a fucking moron.
"Yes, my sincere condolences to Mr. Potter for his loss, and also the nine families of the muggles that perished, alas they will never know the truth. We will bring justice to those responsible, and make a fine example of them, let it be known that our Ministry is as strong as ever. Thriving on Justice, and the truth."
“Making sure no one dies,”
"Needs a bit more, I'd say," Umbridge isn't even looking at his scars, but rather intensely, sadistically staring into Harry's eyes. "Not for today," She drawls and lets go of his hand, reaching for her wand to clean Harry's blood off her fingers.
Nothing happens.
Either in his career. Or his life. Severus, while unabashedly confident in his abilities, as a dueler, and a Slytherin, really has no qualms about the odds of failure stacked against him. Of course, all might end well if he goes according to the carefully crafted plan.
"There there, you filthy bitch," the grimy voice croons into his ear and Harry can practically smell the rancid breath brushing against his face.
And then the hand goes slack, the pressure lifts from his throat, potentially the only thing holding him upright at all, and gravity pulls him down. He falls several feet to the ground, disoriented, feeling as if some of his soul is still out of his body, not quite
Their inner office is an absolute mess today. He's short on one Auror team whom he dispatched to a case in Devon, and nearly half of the paperwork is still incomplete, on top of that, they're getting one letter after the other, reporting missing persons and suspicious deaths. And Kingsley only has so many people on call.
"Tattershall," Draco squints at the map, tries his best not to look intimidated by the small dots and the overabundance of names and places and signs. He doesn't know what half of them mean.
Harry groans, and with strenuous effort, croaks out, “Screw,” he pants for breath, “You.” He is vaguely aware of Draco stiffening, eyes going wide with shock.
"How is the trembling,” Severus asks, eyes flicking over Harry's hands, which Draco hasn't seen still even once since coming back from Malfoy Manor, “Has it lessened?"
He is getting seriously tired of the constant dizziness that's been plaguing him, not just after his detentions, but rather, all the time recently. He has gotten better at managing his stumbling, though, and is able to portray a bare minimum of stability as he makes his way out of the office and towards the stairs.
"What's wrong?"
"Do you rather I help you now, or not at all," Severus snaps.
Sirius' absence should feel significant in a moment like this, but with Draco's head on his shoulder, Harry doesn't feel the pang of anguish that was expected.
Albus knows it. But he is allowing this.
"Er, no sir." The man says, looking wildly out of place, Futternic almost runs right into him, sending him leaning on a stack of papers. "I'm from the magical mishaps department?" The man says, throwing a glance at the passing woman. "Minister Fudge wants to see you, sir."
"They're
"Yes, to you as well."
"I like how that sounds.” Harry then proceeds to grab Draco’s hands and then wrap them around himself, resting his own hands around Draco’s wrists, keeping them there. Draco doesn’t mind. Of course, he fucking doesn’t. This is amazing. “How did you know that?"
“How’s this place not discreet?” Draco interrupts sharply before Harry can open his mouth. This place wasn't compromised, not as far as he knew anyway.
Harry nodded and left the room, the sounds of his feet melting into the sounds of waves crashing as he went upstairs.
"Hmm," Draco nuzzles into Harry, and Harry has to keep from giggling.
Harry willingly goes along, drowning out the questions in his head. This man saved him just now, questions can wait for a little while. Just a little.
Almost as if readying himself for the impact, Harry closes his eyes, waits and then opens them again. No one pushes him. Even though he can feel Draco, this time the dizziness of disorientation or instability doesn’t grip him as he falls helplessly.
Potter is late.
Harry takes in Tonks' and Bill's appearances, they both look slightly haggard and almost as tired as Harry feels. He wonders how he looks.
He stays there, on the floor, with his cheek leaned onto the gravelly ground and the tips of his fingers brushing against Draco's wrist, as if just checking the other boy's pulse. In reality, Harry is analysing his temperature, but is too tired to get up and put the back of his hand on the boy's forehead every time. It's too much effort, and Harry is ashamed to admit that even harboring the idea of getting up from this position is actually tearing him up.
"Pain relievers. This is good," Harry carefully picks up the lilac-coloured vial and hands it to Draco.
“Why are you spying on me?”
"Exactly. And speaking further on the attack itself, I can assure every wizard reading this article, that this was an unplanned, one-time occurrence, it will not happen again, and our top Aurors are leading an investigation at this very second to arrest the culprit."
Currently, as of this moment, Harry has three different revelations regarding his predicament.
"But the matter of fact is that vermins aren't meant to be kept. They're meant to perish."
He vaguely feels the hand on his throat tighten, and just for a moment, hopes that the fingers would crush his windpipe, strangle him to death before it could get his soul sucked out of his mouth. He shudders to think of his body as a soulless husk with a scar on his forehead. Limp, and pale, and… shallow.
That's why he accepts the kids' suggestion in the first place. Well, he knew that if he didn't, they were gonna go through with it anyways. They were restless, he could see, restless but not really doing anything. He's heard Minerva mentioning Hermione missing or forgetting homework assignments, something so innately unlike her that the mere thought was unbelievable. Ron had checked out altogether, she said, and only bothered taking notes to get to the bare minimum.
Zabini sneers from the corner, "
"Of course," he says. "Accidents happen."
“You have a fever, I don’t know what to do, Draco!”
Severus can barely keep Albus upright, and his eyes still haven’t adjusted to the dim light of the cottage after the fiendfyre inferno of the cave. He shudders, remembering the sheer power Albus had wielded despite being poisoned.
(See the end of the chapter for
"His pride won't let him follow us right away."
'You did well, kiddo,' Harry doesn't feel deserving of that sort of validation, coming from himself no less, but he's too worn out to argue, so he just lays there and wishes for a break. A place shrouded in absolute darkness, with no sound or sight, or movement. Just him floating around with no worries.
"CONSTANT VIGILANCE!"
“Lucius,” Severus says, staring into his eyes.
His grasp couldn’t have hurt worse than the fucking punctures in Harry’s forearm, bleeding almost profusely. There’s too much blood to make out the damage properly. How many times did he ram the nail into his arm? How did he not
“Yeah?” Harry doesn’t look up from the stove.
They'll grow back. Painfully. Eventually. But they will, unlike his pride.
Draco snorts, "That's an insult. Also, what happened to your huge major crush on that Ravenclaw moron last year. What was her name… Chang?” he tries not to sneer, “I'm pretty sure second base with Chang is considered dating,"
When they were in the Shell cottage, either he washed them in the shower or charmed them clean.
bleeding quite a lot.
They don't belong here. In the midst of violence.
there, in a hall of mirrors, and back to the Dursleys, and he was bleeding.
Laying over the sofa, Draco tugs the shirt off, slowly so as to not hurt himself. Belatedly, he realises, he could have just spelled it off and scoffs, draping the shirt over the armrest.
He gurgles a fistful of water a few times, and mourns the lack of his toothbrush before trudging out of the bathroom into the corridor, and just stands there, aimlessly staring at his feet as subtle tremors run through his body. He grips his forearms in an almost bruising grip, trying to steady his hands just a little. He also knows it’s futile.
And then he steps outside the compartment, slides the door close behind him. And it's just Harry, silently letting the tears fall in Draco's arms.
He crashes onto his knees on landing, and hears Harry cry out, landing on his hands and knees beside him. Draco thinks he fucked up, Harry’s injured, he’s splinched and bleeding out and Draco fucked up because he can’t do a single thing right.
"I'm here too, you know," Harry grumbles, looking between them both.
Porter hesitates for just a moment before contradicting, "But I didn't just see it. I felt it! I'm still feeling it. I tried to tell Dumbledore as soon as I found out but the ministry was there and Professor McGonagall was there and she made me go back. Then the whole Sirius thing happened-"
"I still don't understand it," their voices are hushed, and Harry knows that they're not the only ones, barely anyone dares to raise their voice above a certain volume these past few days whilst speaking about certain topics. It's quite a dramatic change from the previously boisterous crowd of students.
"Umbridge," Harry says abruptly.
“You filthy blood traitor!” Rosier yells, a trickle of blood trailing down his mouth as he makes a slashing motion with his wand. Lucius levitates a chair in front of him, which breaks down in half.
with it, Potter,” Severus says dryly, “I'm a potion master, I have my own set of responsibilities. Brewing advanced poisons is one of them."
Draco doesn't understand that either. He has been brought up in wealth and aristocracy and blueblood societies since the moment he was born. Extravagance had very little meaning to him, or rather… The definition was a tad different from what others considered as 'too much'.
"You may enter," The Dark Lord calls out and Evan does not hesitate. He's exuberant, in a way. In the way, a child is proud of a meager accomplishment. Killing those muggles were in no way meager but in comparison to his Lord? Mentioning it was a crime.
"Great," he says absently, and they both quickly make their way to their room. Up ten creaky stairs, and to the left. It's the second room, and the door creaks when Draco turns the key. He has to feel around the wall a little for the switches, but they turn on after a few lazy blinks.
He nods at himself, taps his robe pocket to check whether he has the chocolate bars there and then means to call a house elf for some snacks but Ron and Hermione lean forward in their chairs.
"Nothing, I actually adore your name.” Harry smiles, looking up at him with his head tilted back. Draco wants to lean down and kiss his nose. “How about chicken pie?"
Harry sure hopes that the dawn isn't too far away now. He's sick of the dark. He shudders, draws his legs up to his chest, and wraps his arms around them, resting his head upon his knees, just like he used to do when he was little in his cupboard.
"Don't thank me, Potter. I don't owe you anything, and you don't owe me anything. I'm blackmailing you. At least try sounding like you're miserable."
Remus' grimace didn't diminish. 'He thought you were lonely… as I said, it was just a stupid mirror. He's been talked with, you don't need to worry about a thing.'
"We need to…" Harry muses, then his eyes narrow. Draco follows his gaze, to a small store with baskets set in front of it.
"But aren't they--" Draco purses his lips and then cringes, "What I was about to say sounds incredibly bad now."
Severus doesn’t want to think about Draco’s reaction to the cut that will scar his face, running down from below his right eye down to his jaw. It isn’t subtle.
"There he goes," Harry leans in for a quick kiss just as the train shrieks to a stop. Draco relaxes, well, if it made Harry happy.
"Speaking of Potter, shouldn't he be getting ready for the funeral?" Pomona asks, frowning.
When Potter doesn’t respond for a while, Severus looks back at him. The boy is quiet and staring at his hands. Tremors run through his whole body like a muggle electrical current, and Potter is abashedly helpless in controlling them.
"Actually,” she says, looking a little nervous, “we just wanted the combative spells--"
"None of that, young man! Now hurry up and get Harry to his room, the poor boy looks exhausted."
"Shut up woman!" Sirius hollers back at her and seizes the curtains, almost wrenching them off their hanging place as he draws them together. It's silent again. Harry glares at a salt shaker, which is upturned and spilling salt on the table, refusing to acknowledge Ron and Hermione's beseeching glances.
'Is this an adventure?'
He’s pretty certain the last person Harry wants to see right now is Draco, but he also knows how he can get in these situations. If he somehow went outside the wards--
Stay safe and tell us your favorite scene!
“I know.” Severus gently pushes the boys into the empty study. Wordlessly, Lucius hands a pair of glasses to Potter, who looks taken aback, and with a brief glance at Severus, reaches out with a shaking hand to take them, warily regarding Lucius.
His lord is displeased. Evan cannot blame him, he is displeased with himself, with the Malfoy family's ongoing betrayals. With the failure in his mission.
to compensate for his own mental suffering for a while now. This should be healthy for him, and less than fortunate for Potter. All he needs now is another jab, a valid excuse to strike and then use against Potter when Severus calls on him.
Twinky shakes her head vigorously and comes to stand near Draco’s head, meekly inspecting the boy’s sweat coated face as she wrestles with her pillowcase. “Twinky hears Mr. Harry Potter sir calling and Twinky goes to Master, for permission! And Master says that to help if Young Master is being in danger or Young Harry Potter is dying.”
"Shall we get to it then?" John keeps his face carefully blank, pasted with an afterthought of pleasantness, he has chosen every word with care as to not aid the man in any way.
"It's such an open wound," Harry's fingers trace the air above his shoulder, but doesn't lay a single touch, "I can't use my wand. It's bleeding. Okay…" he closes his eyes, and he looks as if he's holding himself together for the sheer purpose of not scaring Draco.
Harry wracks his brain for a question. He could have asked something about the Marauders Map, something about his father, or even mom, but Wormtail knew it all.
He twists the doorknob. There's the unmistakable click of the door unlocking, and he pulls it open. The air outside the room isn't any less cold, or damp, or gloomy. But it feels better nonetheless.
Harry tenses but his face stays passively calm. "Not sure if I do," he says, the cool glass offering some measure of comfort in his hands. Moody grunts.
“Just a little bit more,” Draco whispers to Potter as they’re heavily leaning against the wall. Severus watches from the corner of his eyes as Nott rounds the end of the corridor, leaving it vacant. There is no one else on the main levels but Lucius, them and Nott. Bella isn’t even in the manor, and that’s a blessing on itself.
Next update, Saturday, 20th June.
There's a shadow at the far end of the barn, where the squib farmer kept his chestnut horse tied up. Draco knows the shadow is Harry.
them both. Potter is such a moron.
Seeing him reduced to a terrified wreck, begging the invisible phantoms of his past life looming over him had been a jarring, eye-opening lesson. Severus banishes the memories behind strong occlumency shields, and gets into professional mode. He needs to help Albus right now, not dwell on his mortality.
"She has a binder," Ron and Hermione cut in at the same time.
There's commotion all around him, people bumping into other people as they all scramble to put some relief on their paper load, Futternic bustles around the cramped space, distributing coffee mugs and scones randomly to anyone who extends a hand out of their desk, Kingsley avoids her by a few inches as he races from stack to stack, waving his wand and organizing the cases.
Minerva scoffs in disbelief. "No need? People need to know the truth, Albus. We are in a war situation. We barely need people believing whatever
"I'm just making sure," he murmurs. He can’t remember where he left off. He rubs at his arms.
"Trust me, Remus," Ron says, "that means she's got everything figured out. We both do. We've been planning this for days, and we have a list of suggestive spells that we thought you could look over--"
Of course he didn't tell Harry that.
"Fuck you," Draco snaps, and surges forward. He takes Harry's startled face and closes the space between them, not for a kiss, but just for effect.
"I'm not in pain,” Harry explains, clenching and unclenching his fists, “I'm actually fine, it’s just the fuck… the trembling."
"First things, first. Combat and Defence Against The Dark Arts are two different things, well, they're two halves of an apple. You'll only learn about defence, crucial to survival...but it ain't gonna do you any favours if you need to lessen numbers. No, Hermione, I don't take questions, put your hand down."
Draco’s lips quirk when Harry starts ripping at the lower half of his shirt, already ragged in places from where he’d torn it last night. But then concern takes over, “You’ll be cold.” he says.
"Oh this is good," Evan's grip loosens on his throat. "I was gonna do it right here...but look at this!" He twirls Harry's wand with a manic chuckle. Sirius swears and Harry closes his eyes. He doesn't have enough air to breathe, and not nearly enough energy to keep kicking.
had he fathomed that this creature was a death eater. She couldn't be, she works in the ministry, they're not that incompetent, to let a death eater woman work as the Minister's secretary. She's affiliated with the dark lord. That must be it. No marks.
He's seen it happen once, when they were in the cell together, the abrupt way Harry's eyes cleared and his head snapped to meet his.
"Doesn't make me any less curious. What kind of a code name is Argent? He could have chosen something more badass."
"I fire-called Albus," Arthur Weasley is shouting now too. "Shacklebolt sent him a Patronus, the situation is under control,"
"Albus? Albus are you there?" Slughorn doesn’t sound anything like Severus remembers. Not the jovial man he’d been when teaching potions. He sounds tired and concerned. It instantly puts Severus on edge, even more so than before.
Draco grins.
Harry, who usually has a decent connection with most animals, promptly finds himself hating cats, just because Umbridge seems to be
you meant so well.
"Here is forty, please don't call anyone." They’re almost out of money now, and Harry’s face is worryingly blank beside him. His shoulders are stiff,  his hands behind his back.
"What is this?" A third voice rings out, a very wretched, familiar voice. Harry's blood runs cold. Neither he nor Malfoy turn. But they don't need to.
He is surprised to see Twinky still standing there, and looks at her, about to ask what’s she waiting for, when she asks, “How is you doing, Master Draco?”
But Potter isn't sleeping. He is… away.
Before he can even twitch his wand, Rosier whips his own wand, ripping Draco's wand out of his clenched hand and flying into the air. Draco hisses as Rosier smirks in triumph. Nonverbal magic. Fuck.
Harry just looks at him.
'You're running away from yourself,” Harry sees Sirius shrug from the corner of his eyes, ‘One little scare from that hooked nose git and all you can think about is being tied to a bed and left to rot. Stop it.'
The Ministry, and thosevulturistic reporters, are in an uproar, and Hogwarts is being more closely monitored than ever. Black's appearance has thrown everyone into disarray, the people had already been disgruntled by Potter and Albus' claims about the Dark Lord's return, and now another bombshell had been dropped on them.
"I made plenty," he says and gets up to act on his passive threat. He's more than sure that Severus Snape would regard it as such. In a way, Harry is getting exactly what he wanted.
"They just died?"
"Yeah! What's up with that--"
Then he remembers that this is war and the man haughtily coughing in front of him has done way worse and yet leads the fighting force against the dark side. The world is twisted that way. His eyes flitter, and he can feel the stifling pressure in the room.
He doesn’t know how Harry’s walking right now. He’s seen the boy’s legs shaking, the way they sometimes seem to buckle under their own weight, no warming. The way Harry cries out and scrambles for purchase. He’s massaged those legs himself, on a few occasions.
Draco watches Harry watch the sea sometimes too.
"She's just doing it because there's a meeting," Fred stage-whispers to his twin and he nods fervently.
Hopefully,  you guys enjoy it as well!  Happy reading!
“I know how to apparate,” Draco says firmly, he does. He can do this. He can… he can apparate an unknown distance with another injured passenger. He can. They don’t have time. They have to. The ministry can already be on its way here. He just used magic. Twice. This place is a beacon now.
was kidnapping a fifteen-year-old boy, and I don't see one hiding in your robes now," Rosier looks around. "The order found out. There's a mole in the ministry, either that or your snitch is compromised."

seem to be nursing that he can't believe himself for complying with Albus' orders.
He catches Dudley's gang snooping behind the fences a little further away from the park, smoking something, probably cheap rollups they sneaked out of their parent's bedrooms as they snigger and cuss between themselves.
Next update on: 13th August, Friday.
Harry is frowning in her direction, as if he can’t quite figure out what a house elf is doing in there. To be quite honest, Draco can’t either. Death Eaters aren’t known to show this kind of hospitality to their prisoners, especially since both their deaths are kind of guaranteed in two days.
And then Cedric
“Of course I did. I meant it on a strategic level. He’s really into chess and strategy too. You’re kind of similar.”
“I found Potter’s.” He says, holding the two wands in his hand. Severus stares for a moment, before inclining his head, he takes the offered wands and puts them away.
He scoops up another spoonful because his previous one melted off entirely, he raises the spoon and thinks about something to toast to, "Here's to…"
have died instead?
"Oh look at that," Harry mutters and lets go of his hand. Draco wants to mourn the loss, or better yet, reclaim Harry's hand, but the boy is looking at the glass panel behind the chairs.
And then he's gone. There's a large resounding crack that echoes through his bones and the man disappears into thin air. And Harry's left dumbfounded on the ground, still holding his broken glasses in his sweaty palm. It takes him ten seconds to peel his body off the newly mown grass and shakily head inside the house.
"He won't. Not if I don't run again." He lifts his eyes back up to Sirius.
*** the following will contain MAJOR spoilers as to what is about to happen in this story, proceed with caution***
“You just said that we have forty eight hours left, are you going to spend that time wallowing?” He doesn’t know when the roles reversed, from him wallowing to Harry, but they have.
"I told you," Draco cheeks, narrowing his eyes at Umbridge's flushed, enraged face. "You're nothing."
“It’ll be okay,” That’s what Harry tells him, surprisingly, as Draco’s desperate gaze comes back to him. They both know who Bella is really here to torment. Harry seems as if he wants to say more but by then Bella is already in the cell, a stone cold look on her face as she dispassionately points her wand at Harry and the screaming starts anew.
Sirius makes a face, and then says, "Keep going. Keep complimenting me a bit more."
“Apology accepted.” Severus does his best not to smirk.
He can’t, it’s just an ugly stain from merlin knew what. "No,"
"How long has he been feverish?"
"It wasn't as if we knew," Bill mumbles, being the first one who looks away from Harry's tense form.
Harry is getting tired of this game. "I don't know," he grits out. "Let me be, alright? I need to help him!"
"So are you."
Black is a blithering idiot without an ounce of common sense, self preservation, or regard for others. Severus doesn't know why he expected better, perhaps he thought his past recklessness would have taught Black better, but apparently not.
"You disobeyed me," comes the gentle hiss and the subtle press of the man's firm toes on his neck, just in the hollow of his Adam's apple. The agony is beyond measurable. Evan craves death the way a thirsty man wills to do the most heinous of acts for a drop of water.
He risked it all for Harry.
“I swear I’m not this bad at cooking,” Harry finally says with a nervous chuckle, dumping the ruined pan under the water.
Albus had relieved him of his duties as a spy; which just went to show how grave the entire ordeal was. Not that it needed any confirmation for Severus's sake. In fact, he might be one of the only people who would understand the delicacy, and sensitivity of this situation. This is running away from a broken dam, the surge of the flood.
Black. Drunk, fatigued, loony Black.
"Sirius," Harry says, the man's grip on his arms is hard enough to bruise, and Harry squirms, tearing himself away from Sirius and staring around the room, while nearly everyone else stares back at him. He feels like he’s on stage and has forgotten all his lines.
“Harry?” he calls out, frowning when there’s no answer.
"I didn't know our lord demoted you," he says, suddenly, in futile hopes of catching her off guard. Of course, she rarely is. He can't feel her flinching behind him. Always still, like a fucking statue.

He is panting slightly, and looking pale. His wand is trembling in his hand which is still pointed at Umbridge.
One of them though… One of them isn't empty.
"I'm sure we're both doing them splendidly," Kingsley replies cooly.
Going under his Invisibility Cloak again, he makes his way to the bathroom, letting muscle memory carry him as he loses himself in his thoughts.
“Master Lucius also told Twinky to be giving you some-” she looks even more scared than before as she quickly blurts out, “Food. But he says not to let anyone know.” she's not looking at them, at his face, or Harry's body.
Draco looks taken aback for a moment, before he nods and murmurs, "I'm sorry."
“What else is there to do between torture and cleaning up each other’s wounds?” Put that way, it makes everything sound even more terrible. This time, the scowl comes easy.
(See the end of the chapter for
His eyes go to the large clock hanging on the wall, ticking almost ominously, the pendulum below is swinging back and forth in a monotonous rhythm.
"I don't know," Harry teases, "I heard a smidgen of a compliment in your voice." He looks around them again, his eyes only subtly admiring, "This place is beautiful."
Draco's shoulders slump and he lets out an audible breath. He slips his wand back up his sleeve and slowly makes his way over to Harry.
A smirk curls across Rosier’s lips. “Bad seeds,” the man shrugs. “That should be it. The seeds of a traitor, the womb of a traitor… I mean there’s only so much you can hope for. CRUCIO!”
"I didn't even think about it like that. I'm--"
Severus takes in a deep breath, praying for patience, and retrieves the locket. It's light in his hands, and there’s no magical residue coming off of it, except for the faint traces of the poison it had been immersed in for so long.
Life had a funny way of putting things into perspective.
She blocks the hex very easily, smiling, shaking her head. "Potter, you're just making it worse for yourself."
“So you just picked up a brush and--”
This isn't his first restless night, far from it, in fact, he had been so desperate for a break, that he couldn't help but pray for a different dream every single morning as he forced the sleep out of his body and mind and tried to go through with his chores.
He's not scared of her. Not really, not more than anyone else in this fucking place. Evan has forgotten fear. Fear meant nothing in the presence of pain. And of pain, there was an abundance of at the moment.
Cursing, he flings open the cabinets. He doesn’t know how Harry is, what condition he’d be in. But if it had been one of the Death Eaters who’d kidnapped him, and Draco doesn’t know who else it could have been, he’s…
Harry squeezes his hand, and just then one of the weird muggle cars passes them by. Draco freezes for a second but Harry seems nonchalant.
"Remember cars? There's a truck--a type of car-- specified just for letters. Or a bike. I'm not really sure of this stuff. They find the addresses, then use the vehicle to get it there,"
"So this statement further confirms your last, regarding Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore's claims… claims that indicated You-Know-Who has returned and was responsible for the death of a seventeen-year-old student, namely one Cedric Diggory?"
Lucius Malfoy died in an instant, much quicker than Mrs. Malfoy's messy, heartbreaking death. Harry had killed the man himself, with a careless flick of his wand that first paralyzed the man, and then tore through his head, spattering blood and brain matter on the floor. Dead. All those lives, in the palm of his hands.
Severus’ head whips around towards Draco, "So you knew of this and didn't come to me… friend in need of dittany…” his eyes narrow, “seems like this mysterious friend in need is finally found."
With a wave of his wand, the Death Eater garb he is wearing vanishes, leaving him in his usual clothes. It doesn't help make him feel better.
He did. But there was nothing to be found here.
“It’s cold,” Draco says, and mulls Harry's words in his head. 'Okay' in Harry's language is much milder in meaning than its other counterparts.
Daydreaming is too simple of a name for it. The vibes that Draco is getting from Potter is wildly different. Tangible.
"I am bored. Watching you ramble. You know who rambles, Evan?"
"Not revenge," Rosier echoes, "This is what you deserve… you deserve this, every bit of it."
Murphy raises his bushy grey eyebrows. "Are you daft, Shacklebolt?" The man snaps. "We're on the brink of war, boy. The ministry should be declaring a national emergency,"
“Murtlap essence, Potter. Should be helping with the pain.”
Draco freezes for a second. He is vaguely aware of the muggle money system but he is more than sure that there's no such a thing as 'Quid'.
Potter’s trembling hands are clenching and unclenching, and he is actually glaring at Severus. If the situation weren’t as horrific as it is, Severus would have found it amusing. He doesn’t answer.
"Black and big, probably Shacklebolt." They stand in contemplative silence for a beat, Rosier rolls his wand beneath his fingers with a thoughtful frown.
"White tigers?"
"I might need to consult Poppy regarding your case, Mr. Potter," his godfather says, "She has your medical history."
“C’mon. I’ll give you some food too,” Harry says to him, before turning back to shell cottage.
“Ow!” Harry yelps at a particularly hard nip, before laughing, “Yeah, okay, definitely hungry.”
And yet, here they are. And his parents aren’t. He wonders if they’d be ashamed.
His eyes are so dry they burn. He blinks. And feels nothing as the empty pit in his chest seems to grow larger.
Potter winces. “I did, a lot. It was in my head though, but it still counts.”
Water dribbles down from the slanted roofs, shadows scram like rodents, from one corner to the other, the sky is the color of a storm and there's a definite chill in the air that cannot be entirely blamed on the weather, but rather the sheer atmosphere of the place.
"Is this line safe? We need to talk at once," the urgency in Slughorn’s voice is rattling.
Distant memories, and they're so addictive to Draco, that he's plagued by it. He remembers it, of course he does, it happened recently but it feels like such a long time ago.
Harry laughs, “It wouldn’t. I heard it in the telly last summer while I was painting the windows.”
Thanks a bunch to our Beta Amar for editing, whom we shamefully forgot to mention during the last update! He's doing a great job, any other typos are solely our own fault.
bloody.
"I bet he's holed up with Dumbledore--"
Harry waves him off with a shaking hand. "Nothing important. Just a goldfish matter,"
Bill shrugs and looks away, mumbling a good night to Harry as he and Moody step out. The glass in Harry's hands stays steady but the water sloshes as he deliberately slows his pace for the injured Auror to catch up, Moody throws him a look but doesn't complain.
It all sounds very murder-esque.
Harry was right. It doesn't taste stale. It doesn't even smell bad.
"Plenty," Draco mutters and his eyes droop.
No such luxuries from now on.
"I just suppose that Mr. Potter here needs a firmer reminder, seeing as our current… arrangement is redundant. We'll just have to try harder,"
“Severus, now!” Lucius’s voice cuts through the air as he ducks, his cane clattering to the floor as he whips his wand out. Severus quickly darts about, grabbing Draco by his arm and pushing him towards the fireplace while Lucius sends a curse after Rosier, making him dive away.
Mrs. Weasley's cooking is, as always, impeccable and Harry slightly regrets his lack of appetite. Sirius and Remus have decided to give him his space and are sitting together now, silently whispering amongst themselves as Ron and Hermione do the same on the other side of the table but keep throwing him a glance every once in a while as well.
Harry shoots him a glare, eyes red-rimmed and… desperate. "Then how can I have been there? And done those things? How could you be there and do nothing? Draco begged you. I was there. Right next to you, and he begged you to do something, and you just stared right back at him. You did nothing and I didn't either."
Chapter warnings for; blood, violence, torture, explicit language, implied child abuse, implied threats of rape/non-con.
“Twinky I need your help,” Harry furiously whispers as he quietly crawls his way to the timid house elf. “Draco, your master-"
He sighs in relief as Number four Privet Drive comes into his view, and the man looks almost as relieved. As soon as they're near the porch the man shoves Harry into the yard with a stern glare, his wand lighting at the end in his other hand.
"I know,” Ron rubs the back of his neck, “It's just, you know how Hermione has this thing,"
On his knees, he uses the wooden support beam to pull himself up.
And the snake obliged, beautifully terrorizing the man beneath his feet, reducing him to a senseless blob sputtering in horror. Harry’s hands had been perfectly steady in the dream.
"Kingsley Shacklebolt. Minister Fudge summoned me," the secretary looks up at him, her eyes raking him head to toe before she puts her fancy green quill down and straightens her skirt.
The ice cream store was pretty close to the train station, but funnily enough, the bus station isn't as close as they thought.
He stands and gestures around the enclosed cell, "We are not in just any random crypt."
"Don't even think about it, Mooney,” he points at him, his hand wavering, “Let me sulk."
“This wound won’t just heal with a spell or a healing salve, do you hear me?" He snaps.
"He wants to join the club,” Hermione says firmly, she is
"Why a low dose?" Harry asks the timid elf and she vehemently starts shaking her head.
Draco runs and runs and what he does find in the looming dark is something far worse.
He almost does it too, the spell words right on the tip of his tongue, but his wand lowers at the last second. He's breathing heavily.
He lets out an anguished wail. That
The better question, Draco realizes a beat later, is
“I’m sorry,” Draco repeats, kneeling down next to him, “Just take deep breaths,” he brings the boy’s wand in his sight, momentarily tearing Harry’s eyes away from the wand on the floor.
Harry washes them away, and dispassionately watches as blood lazily starts bubbling out of the inflamed wound. He really should have asked for a disinfectant, while he was at it.
Evan nods his head fervently, he cannot speak. He doesn't think he ever wants to speak again.
Finally, a door reveals itself, and with a sharp snap, three steps extend downwards to the sidewalk, trapped by two frail rails. Remus pushes him to the door, his wand pointed to the door itself. Hedwig indignantly hoots at the werewolf.
Sirius's words ring in his head a few times, with phrases such as 'resistance against you-know-who' and 'Dumbledore insisting on absolute secrecy' bolded in the mental speech. It makes some amount of sense but Harry is too mad and irrational to accept it as such. He's giving himself some leeway to be petulant, he knows how ridiculous he must look but he doesn't care. Harry's tired. He really is.
slashing him. He doesn't want to contemplate the outcomes. The full moons. And whether he has to go through an immeasurable amount of pain every single month. That is, if he gets to live after two days.
Next Update on: 30th of July, Friday
Hedwig seems to sense the tension in the air, because she quiets down too, settling on top of the mantle place.
“Sorry to inconvenience,” Draco isn’t sorry in the least.
"I don't know… two? I took one this morning before breakfast."
Evan sends a cutting hex his way, this time on his calf. Harry can feel the warm blood spreading and howls.
Harry’s eyes are fixated on the wand, hypnotized and mortified by what he’s seeing. Draco calls him, but he doesn’t respond, he’s looking at the wand in Draco’s hand and his breathing is tilted, blinking hard.
The Slytherin part of him demands him to stop and
Next update on 1st November, Sunday.
"Hm?"
"Not exactly," Severus mutters, running his wand along Harry's arm. "The ingredients are volatile in nature in nerve soothers, they can react with any foreign substance in the body that isn't a pain reliever."
Harry rolls his eyes. "Cedric's death, yes. You can say it, Ron,"
"How?"
"Get away from me!" He shouts, and Rosier howls in pain, Harry's wand clutched in his hand.
Draco finds himself nodding even though he doesn't fucking mean it. He just hates seeing Harry so upset
"Nothing." Snape's fingers subtly press down on the etched words and Harry yells, "Nothing doesn't hurt," Severus snaps back. "Who did this to your hand?"
"Oh Poppy, I could care less about that blasted thing." She whips her head to face Albus, her bun the image of a mangled mane around her face. "Fudge is discrediting you. And people are listening to him… can't you see what he's doing?"
Draco looks at him, he knows Harry's lying. Of course, he is. Because the truth is, Harry has no way of knowing what will happen if left alone. Something could happen, and Harry knows firsthand just how shitty their luck is. Kidnapping, torture, blood and all those niceties.
She makes a face, “That looks really painful.”
And then it's as if someone thrusts the whole area, or perhaps Harry, into a refrigerator; goosebumps rise along his arms and his breath mists in front of him. Everything is plunged into sudden darkness, the faint light of the stars above him flickers out, and he stills.
Severus turns to him. "What about it? Tell me."
Remus rubs his nose, "Exactly, Hermione. You two have done way worse, as an ex-teacher myself I'll admit that teaching a bunch of children isn't easy. Teaching them as children?" He sighs, "That's a whole other argument."
Draco runs after him, "Hey! Harry, where the hell are you…"
"I don't understand," he mutters and Moody snaps at him.
"Oh, grow a pair, Potter" Malfoy snaps and snatches the vial back, dumping it inside his school bag along with the rest of the vials. Harry watches him, feeling his stomach clench. He should probably bring it up now, when Malfoy seems the calmest.
to be right.
"Drink this, maybe another--"
Hermione's head peeks through the door, and Minerva nods her chin at her.
He has to steady himself against the wall as he starts walking, and his hand actually does leave a bloody trail of crimson droplets on the stone floors as he walks. Gritting his teeth, he clenches it into a fist, wrapping his scarf around it. At least with magic, he’d be able to get out the bloodstains. He takes care of his macabre trail as well.
He makes his way down the stairs, aimlessly. He doesn't know what he wants to do, but he sure as hell isn't going back to sleep. Somehow he feels this part of his nights has been easier to deal with at the Dursleys. There he knew he was locked up with nowhere to go… here, he'd rather die but stay in that room.
can take hours of this, he can take a few minutes.
"It's fine,” Harry shakes his head, leaning against Draco to show he’s not upset, “It's just, they forced me to cook. It was a chore. Not something I loved doing. I'm good at it because I had to be."
be, but Umbridge is sadistic and his head is pounding. He can cast without standing, no big deal. He would be pretty incompetent if he couldn't.
"They're organizing a resistance group," Remus continues. Not exactly a resistance group, per se. Hermione had stressed upon that fact a lot. But Sirius would probably be more interested in a  resistance than a secret study group.
Harry's eyebrow flicks, "Well, you had a nice way of showing your interest."
In the middle of that quarrel, Pomona makes a sympathetic noise in her throat. "I feel bad for Potter," she says with a shake of her head. "His name is getting dragged in the mud left and right… and with his relatives’ deaths? Poor lad."
Nothing feels right. Everything is stilted and falling, and crumbling and
Severus never let him play around with the fun stuff when he was younger, so this sounds just as fascinating to him as it might sound horrifying to Harry.
His knuckles have turned white from his grip on the wand. It's not dementors, at least, he knows that. There's no chill in the air to indicate that. Besides… Dementors don't have wands.
Rosier is used to this, he has spent the better part of his life in Knockturn Alley and whereas strolling in this place at this time of the night is an unimaginable feat for some, it doesn't affect him at all, in fact to anyone else, he looks rather happy to be there. The man's hands are in his pockets, his steps confident, echoing off the walls louder than one might dare to be here, he's wearing pitch-black robes, and the only thing giving his identity away- not that's he particularly concerned about that- is his blonde hair and the telltale green eyes.
Once again, he raises his hand to call for a house elf and some god damned snacks, but Hermione clears her throat.
"We need to leave," Moody grunts, hobbling to where Remus is holding Harry.
"Come closer, Evan," his Lord commands, and Evan does, ignoring the way Nagini is coiled around the marble throne, lethargically hissing at Evan as he strides to kneel before his Lord's feet. The snake's face is close enough for him to sense the rotting odor of death clinging to her like a cloak.
His bones are probably brittle from years of malnutrition though, so he doesn't know what Umbridge could do with them. He just shrugs. And then winces. The pain has started flaring up not only in his hand but up to his whole arm. It's dull and ignorable. But present. He can't explain it. For a moment he contemplates telling Malfoy, but then decides against it. They're ending their meetings today. He's ripping that imaginary band-aid off, not confiding in it.
“Oh no. No, no.” If Harry had been having trouble breathing before, he definitely can’t breathe now.
"He refused to go," Albus says, his voice soft. Refused to go? Severus derives that bit of information from the subject and saves it into his vault. Something to mull over later.
"Hey," he says, pressing his thumb down to alert his... boyfriend? No, too juvenile. His Harry.
They can't wear the clothes here. Not yet. It's a small place, it's rarely crowded. If someone sees them with the clothing and recognizes them then they'll be in big trouble.
Rosier smirks and turns away, flicking his wand back into his sleeve.
He's a warm bundle beside Draco, he doesn't know how he stays warm in this cold and with their small fire barely flickering, but he is. He's hugging Draco, somewhat like they used to back at the shell cottage.
"I was wondering if we could talk for a moment, Mr. Potter? Just a friendly chat."
Potter lets out a sound that may have been a huff or a gasp, and plants his hands solidly against the floor, before starting to push himself up. When Severus puts a hand between his shoulders to help him up, the boy flinches away so violently he almost falls over again. Severus has not done this in a long time. Rescuing tortured victims. He should have anticipated this, instead of rebuking himself though, he just purses his lips and simply helps Potter sit up.
Then he turns without another word and walks out.
"He doesn't even know we're bringing Malfoy-"
"He already wrote us, sir," LionClaw says with a timid frown. "They're asking for a merge as well. They're overwhelmed."
under his foot, caving into his face and drawing another mangled whimper out of his mouth.
Meanwhile, he was busy not losing his fucking mind.
And now, now that safety is paramount, now that Potter is needed alive more than ever, the old fool orders him to
He doesn't need packing, what he needs is already on him, his wand and his glasses are always with him anyway, he doesn't need that many clothes either, at this point, Harry would really rather go stark naked than appear in these rags in public.
“Alright, thank you, Twinky.”
You are not alone.
Harry is not a killer, he thinks some time later, as he's gazing down at his pink tinted hands. He's no murderer, and he is incredibly selfish. Draco Malfoy has to live. He saved Harry's life, Harry is the reason he's here now. Harry won't let Draco die, not like this, in a prison cell.
He shakes his head. Not now.

"You filth," she’d hissed down at him, cringing at the way blood dripped all over her steamed carpet. The one Harry had cleaned that very day.
