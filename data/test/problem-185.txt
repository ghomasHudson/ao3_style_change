I could easily have stopped it. I had my hand in my wand in moments and could easily have
Darling, I was insecure and nervous, shocked even from my uncontrolled movement. The more of a surprise it was for me when the little noise you made resulted in a rather urgent, “Draco, move.”
My Mind Healer urged me to keep an open mind, and I promise, I am attempting to. I’ve read – and reread – your words about shaking off your family’s prejudices and I’m listening to them. That’s why I’ve written here today. I don’t want everything that we had between us to be nothing but ash.
Draco, tell me the truth. Were you expecting Gryffindors to be different to what we are? Our reputation for impulsivity and living in the moment precedes us a little, but the truth is we are every bit as boring as any other wix. Neville was terribly keen to talk about the Venomous Tentacular that he’s been growing as a way to gain extra credit, and Lulu was equally enthusiastic in her discussion of how the zodiacal change from Aquarius to Pisces will positively affect the Dirigible plums growing in her garden at home. That's exactly how they always are. You were a little quiet – understandable, they’re a noisy lot when they’re all together! – but I never thought you seemed ill at ease, especially when you and Nev broke off and shared your own conversation.
In my panic, I shoved the parchment into my sleeve, not wanting it to be noticed by the Aurors. Narcissa stood, tall, straight-backed and full of dignity. She held out her wrists for them to be magicked back into their restraints.
I devoured every word whilst sitting here in the biggest, most overstuffed chair in front of the common room fire. Outside I can see the snow falling in thick flakes.
Then your movements slowed, darling. They became more exploratory, and you snaked your wet hands over the curves of my bum. You were gentle, but I could feel the lust you felt in your grip. Then, you took me by the hip, and pressed your body against me firmly.
Yours, Andromeda Black Tonks."
McGonagall’s look of disgust would have been priceless to observe.
You do know that I’m going to have to talk dirty to you now, don’t you?
You had the audacity to look guilty at that. As though the knowledge of inflicting some pain on my arm would have let you think twice about defeating a maniacal thread to the world.
Let’s rather talk about this morning. The kiss? Holy Merlin. We kissed this morning. When I stopped right in front of you, I was so glad that you didn’t mistake my hesitation for a shift of opinion. Instead, you just leaned in and put your beautiful lips on mine. I’m sure you must’ve sensed it: my heart was racing, and I was stunned with nervousness until I melted into your touch.
“I think… Did you know that we discussed engaging in courtship?” Theo asked and, darling, I had no clue.
Perhaps we could go during Easter, and visit the boarding house where she lives? I know it's forward of me to ask, but I’d love the opportunity to talk to Narcissa, and reassure her that my love for you is genuine. I'd like to tell her that I mean to look after you, and protect you to the best of my ability, until we’re both old and grey.
So yes. Whitby. I hardly remembered it all from my time on the run, Draco. All that was left in my brain from that time are a few stark images and a feeling of the terrible cold, and so returning with you was a revelation. The wild sea crashing against the shore, the cliff-face and the ruins on the horizon. It shouldn’t have felt homely, but somehow it did. The guesthouse was a lovely place, wasn’t it, and Glynis was so kind.
As for redemption, I have to hope that it is possible, for me as well as you. I’ll let you into a secret. I saw Voldemort at the end of the Battle, just before he was dispatched by our erstwhile Chosen One. The Dark Lord radiated such pathetic, pitiable malice that I actually thought him ridiculous. If our society can’t forgive and give people a second chance than how are we any better than he was? What would even have been the point of fighting him?
I’ve been so passive this whole time but when there’s one thing, I think it’s worth fighting for, it’s us. You have no idea what you got yourself into, Harry Potter. I’d do anything for you.
Anyway, back to the letter. She asked if I could meet her this afternoon, which I decided that I should do. I had a free period and – for once – was relatively ahead with my homework. I mean, I wouldn’t want her not to be able to ask for help if she needed it, and I’ve been hoping that we could have a conversation. I’d love for us to become mates again one of these days.
I’m sorry that I had to leave you. I know that you wanted to come with me, that you wept, but I think McGonagall was right. Travelling, especially to the Ministry, wasn’t an option. You’re too poorly. The Hospital Wing was the only part of Hogwarts where I can trust that you’ll be in safe hands.
Very hard to do, I must say, what with you sitting only meters away and a hundred visions of the night before running through my head. Ron, lax git that he is, sent me off to collect the toadstool stalks and batwings. Apparently, in my current state of hopelessness I was only good for the grunt work. I had to agree, and so made my way, basket in hand, to the annex.
If you don’t mind me saying, you sound like a bit of an egghead. Please, don’t throw our diary away in disgust. I promise you it isn’t an insult. I was always a bit jealous of the wixen here at school that got all the top marks and made even the most intricate magic look effortless.
“That’s the spirit,” I said, laughing at your cheek. “And this wool-brain is hungry, so let's go and get that hob fired up.”
I’ve always trusted her judgment and I was panicking. Please don’t judge me, but we tried to reverse the privacy charms in my diary, to try and discover whether it was some manner of cursed object. We even talked about incinerating it with a spell.
My assumption was that she’d been asked to attend this damned Ball by a third party and that she was clearing the air between us. Then, when the night of the Ball comes, it wouldn't be awkward between us.
Oh Harry, don’t remind me of Quidditch. The Slytherin team is beyond hope, aren’t they? Who could blame them with half of last year’s team spending their lives in exile now after the war? I’d love to see them win at least one match, but – honestly? – I don’t believe in miracles. I’m actually surprised how good Hufflepuff is playing this year. Looks like it will be a close call between the Badgers and the Lions.
They were the best lessons. The whole class used to dissolve into uproar, messing about, charming dirty sketches to the blackboard, making the desks levitate… Merlin, I’m howling with laughter. We were such little gits, and I bet your gang weren’t much better. What was the best trick that you ever pulled?
Then, Draco, you were diving onto the lawn, quick as your legs would carry you. Running, you narrowly avoided sculptures and sundials, gravel flying everywhere. Then – jumping out of the way of a furious looking house-elf – you saw the object of your quest.
“I’m just mirroring your stupid grin, you sap,” I said, and urged you on to get going, not wanting to waste too much time until Diagon would be full of wixen on their Easter shopping.
Draco, love. I didn’t know what to say. I felt every bit like I’d been hit with a
“You had to endure this. And I want to understand, Draco. Everything. You don’t have to cope with this on your own.”
Those scintillating festivities, though, have never been my favourite part of the Yule season. On the day of the Winter Solstice, which is the day the celebrations usually begin, we would ignite the Yule Log and reminisce about the year. My parents always wanted to hear something I’m thankful for and something that I wish to improve about myself in the next year. They usually said their part before me, presumably to encourage me. And it taught me beautiful things about my parents who are again, usually quite private. Even with me when it comes to certain matters. We have never talked a lot about thoughts and ideas. Perhaps that is why this tradition holds a special place in my heart.
I must confess that I had my own suspicions after reading Andromeda’s words. Much earlier, actually. Ever since we found out about each other and I had read back our diary, your mention of Teddy’s bad health around Yule was stuck in my mind. That’s why, today, I came to see you, fully prepared for the words “Teddy is a Werewolf.”
As you can hear, I’m feeling rather chipper this morning. I’m excited about our date later, love, and fascinated by what you have planned for us. I wouldn’t care if you’d made a picnic for the pair of us to eat in Hagrid’s vegetable garden. I love you and I don’t need big, excessive treats. All I want is your company. Even though we’ve had to put up with a lot of
My beautiful Harry.
You say that you didn’t know the reasons behind Narcissa being in France, but love, you did. You were able to explain very coherently why your mother was aboard and talk clearly about French laws. Okay, so maybe you didn’t know the exact details of her return date, but you can hardly be blamed for that! Remember: your probation restricts the number of letters that the pair of you are allowed to share and, had Narcissa not gone missing, this subject wouldn’t have ever surfaced or been thought about again.
Of course, it was in my peripheral the whole time. I probably looked at this artful documentation of the House of Black genealogy as a young lad once, but I can’t recall it in such detail. Standing in front of it fills me with quite some mixed feelings, Harry, and you sensed that when I looked at it this afternoon.
My second bit of exciting news is actually rather more like gossip, so this will have to remain under your hat for a little while. It is about Ron, and more specifically, his relationship with Hermione. Yesterday morning, love: do you remember that Hermione was in a tremendously bad temper? Well, here is the reason.
Well. I didn't mean to make him so anxious, so I interrupted his rambling immediately. "No, just listen. If - and I mean
“I haven’t been a good friend,” were his words after that. “I know you understand why I kept my distance. Fight – whatever against – I just didn’t have it in me anymore. Not after the summer in the Ministry.” Merlin, he told me that he didn't even have a chance to attend his father’s funeral. I understand that it’s not the Ministry’s business, but it was hard to hear that anyway. I can’t blame anyone for that except for Nott Senior perhaps. Did you ever meet him? You surely did. Such a bloody sycophant.
Frankly, I only know of some Equinox rituals. And even those are seen as rather a bit out there. There's indeed this fertilising ritual that, supposedly, bestows a male scion upon you. It includes drinking unicorn spunk under the rising sun of the Equinox and some intricate guidelines for intercourse under the setting sun of the day.
I told him how, really, I’d been “shit bloody terrified”, hanging onto my life with the ragged edges of my nails. How all I’d wanted – all I’d really wanted – was what everybody else had. The mum and dad. Passable grades and a few afternoons playing Quidditch. After my outburst, he was silent for a while, and I thought he was going to give me a bollocking, tell me that the Order of Merlin was our greatest honour. That I ought to be humbled by the tribute of it.
Before I let you say anything, I kissed you there, furious as I still was, with all I had. Your hands clasped onto my shoulders and our tongues entwined, desperate for each other as though we were tied by a binding curse. The kiss felt brilliant, my love. I hope it will become one of those moments with you that will never fade from my memory.
As I said, I’m going to practise. And you better practise Occlumency. Do you think you can cast Legilimens? Have you ever tried? Because the process of it is a lot about channelling and concentrating too. And I could show you my prowess in all its grandeur, presenting you nothing but nothingness after sharing what I want to share. How about that?
And in courtship we couldn’t meet tête-à-tête for quite some time, for we’d need a chaperone with us. Doesn’t it sound dreadful, love? I’m sure, whoever would end up being our chaperone, it’d be awfully embarrassing for them because another pair of eyes couldn’t stop me from tasting your eager prick sooner rather than later. I hope you didn’t expect that until you’d read that line, darling.
Harry. Don’t have much time, but I just thought about Easter. Don’t roll your eyes at me, my lovely darling. I will kiss your unimpressed half-smirk away, I promise.
I held your hand, your long lithe fingers cool, entwined with my own. “Stand still a sec,” I asked, and cast a Warming Charm over you. I can’t have you cold.
We’ve been speaking about our friends. You said that Ron didn’t care about your surname. Well, he cared about mine. Sorry, this was a stupid thing to say. We were bloody eleven and I made fun of him then. Fuck, you have no idea how much I regretted that day, how much I wanted to be your friend. But it’s idiotic – forget that I said anything. I didn’t see how much of a ponce I was back then.
I do know one thing for certain: one thing that I can swear to Merlin is the absolute truth. Your Mother loves you. You are the sun, the moon and the stars in the centre of her universe and, in all honesty, I don’t think that she’d ever leave you willingly.
As I said. You’re basically family now, not only for me but for her too. So better not fuck up any of those N.E.W.T. exams, Potter.
I took a deep breath and got into a stance (only because it felt like a Defence lesson, really), thought about your words before, about the feeling upon your Patronus’s appearance, and spoke the incantation. I did try! Even though you said I didn’t. But I just wasn’t very hopeful that it would work right away.
Kissing you on the Quidditch Pitch felt so vivid that it almost felt like a vision, or a memory of something that hadn’t happened yet. It was more than a mere fantasy.
It was interesting to hear that you knew Malfoy. I suppose, thinking back, that you must be fairly well acquainted with him. Those pure-blood cliques were small and tight.
Where did detention get you, Harry darling? I was sorting potions in the hospital wing, trying to weather Pomfrey’s glares and her harsh tone towards the few students frequenting the hospital beds. Was a very tiresome task. Thing is, I should have been studying this evening. Arithmancy homework will take up at least five or so hours of my week and there’s loads of revision to do… In contrast to many of our fellow Eight-Years, we haven’t partly studied Seventh Year in 97/98, now did we? Merlin and Morgana, I have hardly even properly studied in Sixth Year.
It won’t be long, Draco, until this is the rest of our lives.
When I had nothing but guilt and fear, it was you who gave me perspective, who made me realise that my life was neither worthless nor over. Without you I wouldn’t ever have appealed against my sentence. And without that, in turn, I would hardly be able to work and make my own money. I would have needed to either come with you or find another chaperone for the time, just imagine how extremely impractical that would be.
They always had prisoners. They always found some Muggleborns to make the time pass in the form of Crucios and Imperios.
I’m grinning from ear to ear. Just talking to you makes me happy. Speaking of families, I loved reading about your mother and father when they were younger. I could drink in such tales all day long.
Let me assure you, Harry, that everything pales at the prospect of being Pottered. Despite the possible synonyms that might occur to you, being Pottered with a capital P means to have someone you can trust entirely to jump to your aid, no matter what. To rely on the knowledge that someone will accept you without being resentful. It means to have a supportive friend who’s willing to do anything for you.
I won’t forget this moment. Not ever. You, Harry, are the reason I’m learning to love myself again. And not for just anything that I grew up to be, but for who I am at heart. All my flaws seem just that tad less unforgivable in the light of your eyes.
You broke the Colloportus of your dormitory door, and we stepped inside, touching everywhere that we could and feeling that peculiar combination of lust and magic that tingles under my skin whenever we are intimate. The sensation of your arms wrapping so tightly around my middle, and your plump lips on mine was like coming up for air, and I gasped into your embrace.
Merlin, recalling this feels so silly. But in the heat of the moment, it felt like the perfect thing to say. And I dare believe that you found it anything but silly because you came while I whispered to you, quick as a hex.
We glanced at each other, checking for our mutual agreement without words. “That won’t be necessary, sir,” I said (and you can stop laughing about my prim politeness now; you won’t stop me from addressing people properly, you brute!). “Both owls will belong to either of us.”
I’d know that you’re watching. I wouldn’t give it away, but I’d know that you were watching, and I’d raise my arms to wash my hair, I’d spread soap over my shoulder and my chest, and all you could do is follow with your eyes as the foam slowly runs down my body.
I already miss you. This is the furthest that you and I have ever been apart, and maybe it’s fanciful, but I feel lonely without you here.
I will have more time for you today. Promise.
Sorry. Am I being too much? Like I said yesterday in very different circumstances, I love you. I love you with everything I’ve got, and I’m not good at sitting about, twiddling with my wand and waiting for my cauldron to boil. This is me being a Gryffindor, Draco. Impetuous and quick to action. All I want is to protect the people that I care about, and I knew, I fucking knew that trouble was brewing when McGonagall came to collect you from Defence.
Good morning, darling boy.
Anyhow. Over supper, they had an argument and it got rather nasty. Her nephew apparently needed to blow off some steam and said something about Glynis’s darned altruism that’s supposedly directed at anyone but her own kin, or something along those lines. Mother took the hint and excused herself from the table. I would have followed, but I couldn’t. I wanted to listen to the fight properly and – believe it or not – we had Crêpes Suzette for afters! I’ve been craving that since you’ve mentioned it. There was no way I would have passed up this chance because of someone else’s family drama. The smell! By Circe, it was delicious. The tangerine zest, the Grand Marnier, the house-elf served it flambé for me, probably desperate to divert my attention from the family feud! It was hilarious.
When you started explaining about the Patronus Charm, you had your teacher face on, the one that I’ve seen when you were talking to one of your students several times. Of course I know the sections about Patronuses by heart – you know that I know the books – but hearing about it in your own words, so similar to the way you described the charm in our diary this morning, felt different.
Salazar, but the neighbours were something else, weren’t they?
Okay. Just now – after agreeing that a Thestral Patronus is indeed quite wicked – you mentioned ever so casually that you have ridden a bloody Thestral on one of your sportive school excursions. I have no words for you. If there’s something widely considered dangerous, rare, and mystical, one can be sure that Harry Potter has done or seen it. Which is more than a little alluring.
Good night, my Harry.
Hogwarts, and our pasts, felt a million miles away. All I could feel was the satisfaction of being beside my beloved and kissing you just because I wanted to and I could. Before I knew it, our dinner was naught but the crusts. We threw these to a passing bird, and stood, brushing the crumbs off each other. As we took a turn around the park, we talked about our plans for the remainder of Easter.
You asked if I’d tried to show my diary to a friend. I have to admit, my mysterious wix, that I did that very thing today. I was eager to see if the rumours that are flying around Hogwarts were really true. I can guarantee that they are.
I hope that you haven’t read the “I understand that love cannot wait” line without any sarcasm. A betrothal, first and foremost, is a contract in her eyes. Don’t forget that whenever we talk about engagement, it’s like love and plans to bond are two different things. That too, is something I have a different opinion about. But you surely know that, mon ange.
But Merlin, I don’t know what to say. We probably shouldn’t even put too much attention to it, but I’m… I’m not even cross, I’m just fucking exhausted of this shit.
So yes, absolutely. We’ll make a plan. Here’s my suggestion. Today, during Defence, I’ll make a terrific fuss over some pretend spell that I make-pretend that I’ve flung in Seamus’s direction – the Sponge-Knees Curse or
In mere weeks we’ll be back at Grimmauld Place, our minds filled with plans for our bonding ceremony, your potions business and, of course, the important work of pleasuring each other as creatively and as regularly as we possibly can.
You don’t have to look yet, not if you don’t feel ready, but I’ve got a photo of Edward that I’d love for you to have. I was going to give it to you in The Three Broomsticks, but you seemed so dazed and upset that I forgot I had it inside my satchel. I’ll leave inside the hardback copy of Fifty Ferocious Fungi, on our special shelf in the Restricted Section. It’ll be there waiting, whenever you’re ready.
So here goes.
Had to get my attention back to my class after that, unfortunately. I was I was so happy when I opened the diary again later and saw just how many more words were added. Remember the time when you apologised for writing on my page?
Reluctantly, the two of us dragged ourselves out of our bed and into the shower. I massaged shampoo and conditioner through your hair and rubbed soap suds across the planes and lines of your body.
Oh Harry. Theo looked so besotted but at the same time so wistful. I’m really glad that you wrote this letter, love, for it feels like we made it possible for them to reconnect. Even if only through us for now. But if Pansy is any bit as stubborn as she used to be, then I’m rather certain that she can’t wait to see Theo again, and to try and see whether the pair of them had any future.
Alright, I read your letter again, my precious darling. I love you. It makes my heart swell that Edward’s Grandmother noticed your smile and dedicated it to me. It makes me feel less of a nutter to be honest because I feel myself lose all my composure, my usually very schooled air of indifference slipping into a grin...
And I will share what I can remember about the things my parents confessed and wished for and were thankful for one day, darling. If everything goes as brilliant as we imagine our future to be, I will tell you about this during a Yuletide that we spend together, snuggling on a couch or in bed, drinking hot chocolate, and you won’t stop me from adding some rum to mine. It will be perfect, and I cannot wait for these days to come.
I wish I was with you, drinking fruit tea and stealing any sweets that you might have been gifted. Oh yes: do be a little careful of Luna bearing gifts. She’s been known to infuse hot drinks with Gurdyroot? Is it a reddish purple, my love? If so, at least the Gulping Plimpies aren’t going to be a serve as a problem-
With an arched eyebrow, he looked at me. I would like to say, Harry, that I thought him a bit ignorant, but he probably just doesn't know about the meaning of the occasion other than what they teach in Astronomy. "Sinistra has been going on about that all March. How is the cycle of the earth related to me talking to Seamus?"
Has it made you happy, Draco? Assuaged your brittle pride?
Sorry, took me a moment to reply. When your first words appeared on the page, I kind of laughed (okay, I giggled because I was so charmed), but while reading the next few paragraphs I needed a hand down my pyjama bottoms.
This said, I must add that it fills me with some odd pride to be a wizard. As you can imagine, I’m suspicious of these feelings, seeing how they have been more than problematic in the past, and I usually try to ignore them. What you said about becoming one with the other attendees through your shared magical heritage had me thinking though.
Anyway, I think we might have looked innocent enough in our robes. The loose fabric is practically designed to cover unintended boners.
I don’t think it matters if you’re a Muggle or a wizard: meeting your future Mother-in-Law is always tough. Narcissa and I just have a little more history than most people. Still, in life things are only as easy or as hard as you let them be, and I do think our experiences today bode well for the future.
I suppose waking up wrapped up in your arms must ride high on the list. Your face was adorably soft, and your hair was a mussy white-blond halo around your head.
My heart is still racing. Two hours have passed since I so very eloquently spoke all the above lines and, rereading them, I think that I made myself very clear.
Circe, but it means so much to me. For you to see Mother and home through my eyes.
Mark this moment in time, my dearest.
made it sound like I’m a femme fatale.)
You’re having a little nap, darling, and I can hardly look away. You’re looking so very peaceful and exhausted. You also forgot to take off your spectacles. Which I should fix before you hurt yourself, Potter.
Anyhow, I will see them again once I’m taken back to London. I wish I could travel straight to Hogsmeade. But I shouldn’t be thinking about my departure, not yet.
I made a very well-timed and dramatic pause then. I hope you appreciated that. (I’m sorry that I took you on an emotional broom ride there, but you know me, Harry.)
This said, I want to answer your question now, the one you begged me to answer. I would have been more reasonable and careful, had I known it was you. It holds true; I’d still say that.
I love you.
Draco, when I look back on how easily your mother got everything she desired, I feel my cheeks flame a little bit. Not because I don’t want or love you – I adore you – but just how easily I walked into your mother’s plans.
There are some things I’d perhaps like to talk about but. Well, BUT the catch of this whole anonymous diary thing is that we can say personal things, but we can’t say anything personal, right?
Which, sure enough, ignited a beautiful little fire for us. And somehow, the drawing room instantly felt less grim and deserted with something as simple as a fire.
Everybody else that we expected to have issues with us – Ron; Ginny, Hermione and even Theo – all of them have been accepting, and even kind. Pansy was your mate for years – Merlin, I thought you’d bond with her, once upon a time – so let’s not worry that she is going to hate or reject you. More likely she will be overjoyed to hear from you! You and she have a long history that none of her new Italian crowd will have, and I dare say that she’ll surprise you.
I’ll be my most agreeable self for your friends. No slips, of course no slurs – not even glares until we’re hopefully one day familiar enough to tease each other. I promise you, darling. I will show them that I’m a good choice. They must wish only the best for you, and I’ll be that. Everything you need. You said it: we’re meant to be.
The hair across my tummy is curly, soft and very dark. It feels scandalously arousing to let myself finally enjoy that part of my physique. I never have before. I’ve always been a little embarrassed by its gaudy masculinity. Now though? Perhaps I’m beginning to see the attraction of it. I'm beginning to see myself through your eyes.
Merlin, I had to read half the package to understand that it’s lube. I have never seen anything similar in any shop or catalogue – I have no idea how you got it, crafty git. I would have asked you, but I was too busy snogging you, tasting your minty mouth. You see, I’m starting to realise that I have a thing for pressing you up against walls, pushing my body against yours until I don’t get any closer.
P.S. Concerning potions. You won’t find that in the textbook but I have a very rough guide for you that’s way easier than those wordy explanations in the chapter:
As instructed, I’m using our dictation spell – not that my handwriting is all that frightful – and I’m going to record as much as I can about our morning in the small amount of time that I have.
Anyway, the Mind Healer and I talked for a little while longer. I ended up telling him about how our friendship had developed into something more intimate, and I told him about the sexual stuff that we’d shared. Fuck, but I even told him about the mutual masturbation. “And that’s all entirely natural,” was his only reply. “It's healthy. The diary is meant to be a safe space and that is precisely what you’ve been using it for. You’ve both been exploring your sexuality and your bodies in just as you might if the war hadn’t got in the way. There’s nothing for either of you to be ashamed of.”
And in these few years, I’ll be brewing lovely potions in our lovely home and selling them to wixen in dire need of some remedies concerning their beauty or their gardening.
Who wouldn’t want a partner for their child that adores them the way that I do you? Please don’t call what happened undignified. It was a perfect minute in time, and a beloved memory of mine. It was anything but undignified.
Yes Draco, I’m a long-winded, rambling git. I’m apologetic, but I happen to rather fancy you, and it’s rather hard not to go off on a tangent when I can see something is amusing you. You start smiling, and then it’s very hard for me to stop trying to keep it there, fixed on your face.
‘Blaise Zabini had a stark warning for our Saviour, recently seen on the arm of Draco Malfoy in these very pages. “Draco Malfoy will stop at nothing to get what he wants and promote his family above all others. He’ll deploy every trick in the spellbook to make you feel like you’re the only man he’s ever loved. It’s all falsehoods and lies."
Anyhow – it was then that I had a new breakfast idea. “Do we have some Muggle money?” I asked, already glimpsing into my wallet to check for some pounds. And then I almost forgot that I can’t use magic when not at home or at school, and I withdrew my wand. It’s good that you’re taking care of me, darling, because with your quick reflexes, you immediately seized my arm. I’m sure you would’ve cast a wandless Expelliarmus if you had thought it necessary.
And when you do, I will take your wager and whisper the dirtiest of things into the innocent shell of your ear. I shall tell you about all the naughty noises you make while my hands are exploring your skin. I bet I could make you come from just kissing your neck. You were so hard for me when we were in your bed. I wanted to touch the bulge that showed in your trousers so badly. And I will remind you of your words; how hungry you are for my cock. Do you realise that we will quarrel over who gets or gives the first blowjob?
I jolly hope you didn’t practice casting all night long. Need I remind you that we happen to have a date planned for Equinox? I am getting rather excited about the fact. Having told me that 1) I need to bring my broomstick and 2) Wear something warm, I’m going to assume that we’ll be flying somewhere, and I don’t want you slipping off the handle because you’re sleepy.
And yes, look at you. I’m proud again that I’m meddling in your likes. We’ll make you a suave and well-read gentleman in no time. Which might be a rather promising endeavour on your love-seeking quest. As a courtesy, I’ll ignore this little slur of yours; there is most certainly not the slightest connection between having a favourite poet and being sorted a Hufflepuffian.
I kissed you. “Nothing is going to drop,” I told you. “I love you so much.” I gestured with my arm, taking in the papers layering the table, “and you’re worried that something said today is going to change that? Nothing written here is going to change my feelings.” You trembled in my arms but you didn’t answer me. “You were a child, Draco, manipulated and terrified. I think your probation ought to reflect that.”
I’m quite categorically not ‘completely mad’, as you so delicately put it. I’ve had the full gamut of scans and tests in St Mungo’s over my wild magic and I passed them with flying colours. I’m as sane as the next wizard.
Narcissa, however, wasn’t finished.
Deciphering these lines is practically the ultimate test to understanding stilted pureblood small talk. Will you pass, my darling fiancé?
Still, I very much doubt that we’ll be spending much of tomorrow night choosing wallpaper or sitting down for dinner. Giving speeches and being the Ministry’s golden boy will be absolutely exhausting.
It’s exactly like we talked about yesterday in the Room of Requirement: we’ve had months to fall in love, and to change the storyline of our lives. There’s always going to be cretins that can’t accept us, but I truly believe in the basic goodness of wizardkind. I think, once they read about us in the pages of The Quibbler, they’ll fall in love with the pair of us just as soundly as I’ve fallen for you, and the best part of all?
Don’t call me Potter.
I’m going to guess that there isn’t a special person in your life either? You said that you don’t have anyone to talk to. Tell me to piss off if that isn’t any of my business.
Put those Arithmancy books into your satchel, Accio your robes and meet me on the Great Hall steps in ten minutes.
Want to hear my thoughts on us, my darling? On love? Better know your Latin then.
A true French omelette isn’t filled though. It’s just plain and very creamy. Topped with some chives at most. It’s just eggs and some salt as far as I’m aware, the same ingredients as scrambled eggs. It’s all about the technique – that’s what Pansy’s mum said when I stayed at hers once, and we had omelettes for breakfast. But I wouldn’t know, love. Not a first clue.
Harry James Potter(-Malfoy).
I might not be the best (or even average) at Divination, but for once I seem to have made an accurate prediction. Andromeda has written back, and her owl arrived during lessons this afternoon. The Elves were kind enough to leave the message on my bed – they do give me preferential treatment, don’t they? – and she seems pleased about the idea of us visiting at Easter. Merlin, but I’m thrilled.
I have genuinely no idea how Muggles get anywhere at all because it sounds utterly unreliable. If I understood that correctly: there are trains, but not like the Hogwarts Express which travels only between London and Hogsmeade for students (and sometimes teachers) for the hols, and start of term or like the Express from London to Lille to Paris which travels once a day. Instead, there are hundreds and thousands of trains that stop every hour, sometimes even every ten minutes or so, at the very same train station. How?
Then you asked, “Can I…,” your voice trailing off, but we both knew what you were talking about. I shifted to lie on my back, propped one leg up, in the hopes of allowing you good access to everywhere you wanted to touch. You rolled over and when I felt your erection against my thigh, I brought my hand down to close my fingers around it, not moving much, just squeezing firmly.
Oh, Draco love. It would have been easy for us to hide away, but I’m glad that we were braver. Thank Merlin, Circe, Salazar and every other deity for these diaries because I wouldn’t have gotten to know you otherwise, and my life has been entirely changed as a result. I love you, my gorgeous, sexy man, who manages a Patronus on his first proper try and struggles with train timetables. That’s alright, Draco Malfoy. You and I will muddle through forever, for the whole rest of our lives.
If I had to guess, I’d bet that your magic is prickly at first – maybe a little bit spiky – but after a few minutes I think it’d wrap around me and hold me snugly in its embrace. Sorry. I’m romanticising. How can I help turning into a silly Hufflepuff when you told me last night that you’d keep our diary close? That we’d sleep all night together, our bodies pressed close? I keep my diary in my bag too. It never leaves my person.
Quidditch or at least flying sounds like a welcome change. I used to fly a lot, but I think I haven’t been on a broom in about two years or something. Don’t even have one right now, so maybe I shouldn’t get too hyped up about the idea. Do you play or just fly?
“Everything feels so,” you started but lapsed into silence. After a while, you finished, “It’s difficult at the moment.”
I thought of adding some kind of apology. You see, in sixth year, I made myself quite scarce. Vince and Greg were really the only students I talked to. And that’s only because they stayed friends with me even though they had no clue what I was up to. I didn’t want to get Pansy or Theo involved, and Blaise got himself un-involved quite slickly. I kept on telling Pansy how I had neither the time nor the patience to indulge in all the merry Hogwarts rigmarole, given that I was meant to become one of The Dark Lord’s confidants. I shut her out, hoping that it might keep her safe and me sane enough to do my deeds.
A couple of letters ago we were chatting about Zacharias Smith, weren’t we, and you said that I’m not too keen on gossip? Well, usually I’m not, but just this once I’m going to partake.
Okay, here goes. Best reading voice!
Harry, can I try to tell you about that sometime? Not now, I’m sitting in the library, and I’d rather write about it while Warded away behind the curtains of my bed. But I think I’d like to get some thoughts and memories out. Up to now, it has always made me feel better. On the other hand, I feel bad for bringing up things of the past, especially to you.
Please know that I’m not entirely fluent in French (even though I always desperately wished I had grown up bilingual). But I’m a decent enough speaker. I definitely know my way around and I’d order you every ice cream there is. Oh, and pastries. You’d love mille-feuille. Perhaps you know it as a custard slice or a Napoleon around here. But this type of pastry is made so much more delicately in France. It feels like diving into a cloud with your fork. I wish I could bypass Gamp’s Law, just to conjure a slice for you.
Alright, I’ll stop this now. No need to appease and reassure me, Harry, because I know that you worry your seductive bottom lip while reading this. I know that you love me. And I know that we’re not just a newspaper narrative. Mm, you’re my favourite Chosen One, too, my Hufflepuffish sap.
And that’s where everything went wrong, didn’t it? That was when I must have cocked everything up. Just as you were beginning to take off your shirt you froze, a look of abject horror and awfulness blanching your face. All the warm erotic pleasure in your grey eyes seemed to vanish and you left me.
As if it is as simple as that! Perhaps it is for some people. I’ve made the decision not to ask to meet yet, though my quill hovered over the paper for what seemed like hours. Everything will change, won’t it, the moment that we meet? For better or worse, I’m not ready to lose what we have right now, not quite yet.
“That’s why you're going,” Glynis said. She sounded outraged when Mother didn’t react at first. “In dear Rovena’s name, don’t look at me like the heavens came down. Don’t you remember how close you used to be? Don’t you remember what you said about her and Edward Tonks?”
, but that’s not even the point – family… It means that those who call themselves your friends are treacherous. Mother wouldn’t trust anyone who isn’t family – especially not with her whole future at stake.”
Teddy is such a sweetheart though, and while his Metamorphmagus status can be a little disconcerting at first – his eyes tend to change to the same shade as whomever is holding him, and freckles appear and vanish at will – you soon get used to it. He does have the cheekiest nature as well, and though he is often ill, he doesn’t let it get him down.
Alright. So, there I was, sitting on the floor, leaning back against the settee, and sideways against the solid frame of my betrothed, teaming up with Ron to argue against Ginevra’s outrageous assertions that the Harpies Seeker was a no-talent amateur (and not failing to notice that you didn’t dare stand off against your ex, which was hilarious).
Just to make sure – I’m not talking about the practices using actual blood sacrifice and ritual impregnation and such. But I’m sure that you thought as much. I’m talking only about things that are usually enjoyable for every attendee. No blood, no rape, no chastisement, or any of the sort. These are the kind of traditions that should stay in the past for good. Oh Merlin, I could tell you horror stories about things I’ve read in long-forgotten tomes found in our family library.
You gave the bird the corner of your toast, and I read through the letter, feeling my cheerfulness ebb away with every word. I’d been sent thorough and comprehensive directives for the big day, three days hence, when I’m to be given my Order of Merlin.
Put it on your knee and let me talk to you for a while. Let me steal you and divert a little bit of your attention away from your professor. I know it’s only been a few hours since we were together, but I didn’t see you at breakfast. I expect you were going over the last bit of reading for this lesson? You’re so very studious. Don’t worry, Draco. I only want a few minutes of your time.
The Mind Healer gave me an encouraging smile. “I can see that you’ve been under a tremendous level of stress,” he replied, carefully placing the parchment and quill on McGonagall’s desk beside him. “And truly, if it’d been me in the same position, I don't doubt that I’d be experiencing symptoms very much different to your own.” Folding his arms, the Mind Healer looked thoughtful. “Can you remember, Harry, what we talked about the last time we were together? I recall that it made you much more emboldened, and you left looking cheerful.”
Your younger self sounds like a very randy, very crafty sod. I’m captivated by the idea of you wanking in silence, all your friends snoring in unison, while your hand surreptitiously moved under the sheets.
I want to believe that we’ll always be there for each other. That we can talk about anything and the other will absorb the awful recollections and take a part of the pain away from one’s heart. But without making it a burden. It turns into something beautiful once it passes to the other. Into a deep understanding of one another. A reminder that these memories are in the past but a piece of who we are. We are survivors, not victims.
Mother stays at a friend’s bed and breakfast here. She told me that she helped decorate several rooms when the house opened back in the eighties. She told me that I’ve actually been here with her when I was three or four years old. The place is Muggle when you come inside, but once you tap your wand against the bannisters by the stairs that would lead up into the attic, several levels stack up on the house, full of luxurious bedrooms for wizarding guests.
And just a few moments ago, I had two fingers inside of you and my fist around your throbbing prick. I squeezed you firmly, moving my hand faster. “Draco,” you said so urgently that my cock twitched. “Salazar, that’s so good.”
They’d be the life and soul of the party, and I’d stare down from my hidden spot at the top of the stairs, questioning why I was fated to always be concealed and what I’d done to be a source of such great shame. I’m sorry. I’m burdening you once more, aren’t I? My cousin – the same age as me, you’ll remember – well, he was grotesquely spoilt each Christmas morning. He’d count the number of gifts under the tree and throw a snit if he deemed the number insufficient.
As for Easter, I got the tiniest sense that you were feeling a bit nervous about it all.
So, you’re not Ernie? I can’t say that I mind too much about that little fact. Ern is a nice chap, but I wouldn’t want to tell him my deepest, darkest secrets like I’ve already told you. His mouth is as wide as the Black Lake when the mood takes him.
It isn’t too early to flirt again, is it? I confess, I’ve missed the randier conversations we've shared and yes, sexual revelation was absolutely the right description for our special night. (I can imagine your head swelling as I write the words!) I don’t regret a moment of it and I promise, it isn’t ever far from my imagination.
It’s also important for you to know something else before you meet me, face to face: I was one of several in our eighth year that gave evidence in the subsequent Wizengamot trials. Looking back at those immediate post-war weeks, I can see that wasn’t fully in my right mind. I was on a St Mungo’s potion regime that was far more potent than anything I’d been given before and my magic was just explosive.
First of all, can you, please, not mention ever so casually that you died? I mean I know about it and I’m not saying that you couldn’t talk to me about that. But just don’t fib about it while talking about orgasms for sweet Salazar’s sake. I’ve read this, half on my way to getting hard, frowned and reread that “I’d be dead once again” part. Holy Merlin.
Well, and this is when the picture was taken. Mother visited Glynis while she worked as an apprentice for a hotel in Middlesbrough. In Muggle attire. 1974. About two months before she and Father had their bonding ritual and took off to France. She looked so different in this picture than in the wedding photographs I know. Part of me wishes I could meet the person she had been back then.
Oh darling, you gave me the darkest of looks. “You don’t know Pansy, like I do,” you answered as we bustled out of the Hall.
Fantastic. A shower cubicle is free at last, which means I can finally primp and preen myself into a boyfriend worthy of your attention. I’ll even squeeze myself into those Muggle jeans that I know make my bum look good.
Let me lighten the mood. Move onto happier things.
Only one quick note on Potter today: I’m starting to get the idea that you only want to listen to the bad things about him. I told you how thankful I am to that bespectacled git and all you hear is that he ruined my family, for which I can’t even really blame him. Do you have some sort of feud with him? I’ll always pick your side, naturellement, but Potter might be one of few I won’t start a personal vendetta against.
Also, tell me in your reply or when we see each other tomorrow whether this brunch will be okay with you. Looks like we both might see our families and I am not even a tad nervous about it, my darling. Not in the slightest. Andromeda will love me – I am very charming – and Mother will welcome you with hugs and kisses. It will be jolly good fun.
Anyhow. Like I told you, she just asked me to make good for my missed appointment with my Mind Healer. I can’t say that she didn’t look pissed but was more understanding than anything else.
Okay, you actually answered my first question here. You were giving me some (not-so-)subtle hints before but I wasn’t quite sure whether I understood or whether you were just so ridiculously straight that the thought didn’t even cross your mind.
Mr Malfoy-Potter, owner of a shiny Outstanding DADA O.W.L.
When not much later you suggested going to bed, we both knew that we didn’t have sleep in mind. You eyed the remaining third of the champagne bottle appraisingly, but I snatched it from you. “I won’t let this go to waste. It’d taste awful tomorrow,” I declared, not bothering to take a glass with me when I was leading our way to the bedroom.
I want to tell you not to panic. But we both are positively panicking right now, isn’t that the truth, love?
After a few more speeches, the reporters had another minute with you and all the famous guests there and I wasn’t quite sure how you wanted this to go. I politely stood next to you, but you turned your head, probably searching for me, and pulled myself so close to you that no Ministry bloke would call me your pal again. Being as bloody Gryffindor as they come, you even kissed me in front of everyone. I haven’t seen the
We need to get together, Draco love, and plan precisely where we are going to stick our wand in next. I bet you the longest, wettest, most indulgent blow job that I can make Mr and Mr Finnigan-Thomas a reality before this year is complete.
- too delicate - and it was quite the palaver. My best-friend and her boyfriend almost missed the last coach leaving the school gates. I’ll admit, the sight of Thestrals harnessed to the school carriages still chills my blood. They’re so grim and gaunt. I’ve heard that people call the sight of them an omen of bad luck, but right now I don’t want to focus on that.
I wasn’t sure quite what to say. I’ve only been to one wizarding wedding in my life, so I don’t have the widest breadth of experience.
Fuck, Harry. I’m so sorry. You only have to think about this shit because of me. And you only had to listen to that Auror because of me. What he said about Edward’s mother, my cousin… I’m feeling so guilty for all of this. Not for Nymphadora – what the Auror said is a huge pile of dragon dung. But I feel so guilty that you have to listen to such crap because of me. This idiot had no right to speak to you like that. You’re anything but a joke. What an uncouth brute with this arrogant, flippant manner of his, speaking to Harry sodding Potter. I bet we could bloody charge him for that.
It’s been a whole week since my lavatory encounter too, a fact which fills me with hot, uncomfortable shame.
It was quite the shock, wasn’t it, when that owl delivered its missive this morning? There we were, you and I, sitting at the breakfast table with our fingers entwined when that gigantic Great Grey swooped down with a large roll of silver-edged parchment tied to her leg. Well, of course my heart sank at the sight. I know the sight of a Ministry owl, and I knew I wasn’t mistaken.
Please, please don’t think that I’m a sad case or anything along those lines, love. I’ve stayed at Hogwarts multiple times over the years, and it honestly isn’t as bad as my dire description above. I was invited to celebrate with my mate’s family, but if you’ll recall, the last time I darkened their door was the day that I broke up from their daughter and left with a black eye.
I wasn’t quite there yet, love, but I watched you in awe and caught your lips with mine to kiss you through your orgasm, our tongues moving against each other in hot, wet strokes.
I’m so moved by your thoughtfulness. I can’t say with words how much your suggestion that I could stay with you after Hogwarts means to me. And that you want to be there for me, come what may. I swear to Hecate that I’ll never admit that to anyone but you. I bloody cried when I read that. I couldn’t help myself when I thought about it, given that I didn’t ask you for any help and that you offer this all on your own accord. This is seriously one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me.
But I meant what I said. I wouldn’t want to hide. I love you and you me. As long as you promise me that incidents like this aren’t too much for you, I have no regrets, darling. This isn’t about being open, it’s just not. I promise.
I just leafed through our diary and spent a few minutes looking at the picture of Edward that you gave me shortly after New Year’s. He looks so tiny, and even though I haven’t seen many infants, I most certainly haven’t seen one with such impressive hair. That’s right Black heritage that’s at work there, love.
Sorry. I’m being one of those overprotective Hufflepuffs that you reckoned “my lot” are in your last letter. I don’t know. I'm poking my nose in. I’ve never heard you sound as despondent as that before though. I suppose it worried me a little.
I slid back into the water, and we held each other for a while, appreciating the luxury of not getting it on in a dusty corridor, sacking down against the wall after coming. And once we both recovered, I got you in front of me again to wash your hair, just like I promised once, massaging shampoo into your scalp, feeling up your arms and shoulders, stealing kisses.
Also: old, insulting paintings and house-elves are exactly my metier. I’ve seen so much pure-blood magic in my childhood home. And sometimes it does the funniest things. Maybe I’d even know your place if it’s a pure-blood inheritance. I’ve been to several of the Sacred Twenty-Eight homes.
Love you x
Love, I can practically see your grin just from reading your words. That’s exciting news! I’m so chuffed right now – I’d love to throw my arms around you right, but it’s not long until we meet anyway. I can’t wait to hear all about it. Just one thing – I’m sure, no matter whether you prefer an apprenticeship or the study programme – you can do anything. You’re much cleverer than you think you are.
Spending hours on end in bed together is such a bliss. I completely lose track of time, just talking to you about every subject under the sun, carding my fingers through your hair, waking your prick from its lazy slumber in between talks and orgasms.
I hope that waking you up before dawn to continue our marathon wasn’t too much after the long and exhausting day you had. But when I woke and it was still dark, you lay in front of me, my arms tightly wrapped around you. It was so warm and comfortable that I had almost drifted off to sleep again, but my hardening prick didn’t want me to. I ghosted my hands up your slender sides, your warm skin, and grinded my hips against you until you woke up, grabbing behind you to stroke me while my arm looped around you to return the favour.
“Pity they aren’t on the curriculum,” I observed, toning down the potency of your magic with another tap. “Hogwarts assumes that domestic magic – washing dishes, cooking, cleaning clothes – will either be completed by the elves, or that wix will learn it at the knee of their parents. Of course, I had neither. Molly Weasley taught me domestic magic when I stayed over with Ron in the holidays. Ron used to take the piss. He’d be out there, messing about on brooms with his brothers, and I’d be in the kitchen, baking and sorting ingredients with his mother. Okay,” I said, observing the smaller, more manageable flame, “next you need to put a bit of oil in the pan. Not too much, love,” I laughed, watching you tip up the bottle. “Circe. We don’t want the sausages to slide off the plate.”
When people ask, as I’m sure they will, I shall introduce you as what you are: my boyfriend.
So, before I ramble off topic again, let me begin at the start. As you know, I have a free period right now and you’re stuck down there in Muggle Studies, learning how to read train timetables (which isn’t all that hard, love.) Anyway, Hermione had already decided what we were to be revising – apparently you and I were giving each other foolish smiles across the classroom whilst this was being taught, and yes, I couldn’t actually remember learning it! – and I was duly dispatched to the Potions section to find the appropriate book.
“The diary was a place where I could be me,” Harry explained. “The other wizard… Well, I didn’t know it was Draco. He was just this kind, astute person who’d obviously been through a lot as well. The pair of us, we’d just write about every subject under the sun. Quidditch, travels – his, not mine – homework and our previous relationships. It was such a safe space to be honest, and I didn’t have to fulfil expectations, or be somebody special. For once in my life, I could just be me, and that was good enough. Luckily, my secret correspondent seemed happy to keep talking to me.”
Today was horrible, wasn’t it, and those Aurors were so utterly foul. Truth be told, I feel a bit devastated. It was like we’d gotten our happy ending. Our friends were accepting, and the rest of the world was coming around to us too.
I love you.
Don’t reply yet, let me have a minute. Recalling this afternoon was somewhat exhausting.
The thing Mother didn’t agree with, though, were our plans to bond at Andromeda’s home. She told us about a wizarding venue in Middlesbrough, a place where Glynis used to work, and how she already spoke to the owner about it.
Most of the time, you and I, we spend our days in a miasma of contentment. Our intimate relationship has led us both to the heights of pleasure, we talk constantly about every subject under the sun, and the rest of the time we are studying or larking about with our friends.
I grudgingly admit that I have always been a bit jealous whenever I saw your beautiful Hedwig swoop in at breakfast. Snowy owls are truly magnificent, and it warms my heart to hear that it was Hagrid who got you your first pet (as well as your first birthday cake). You don’t have to forget Hedwig, Harry. We will find a wonderful and very practical owl who isn’t Hedwig and not even a replacement for her. It will be our hopefully lovely pet and we will spoil them with Owl Snacks and a perfect perch somewhere in Grimmauld where they can rest after flying out deliveries and letters to Mother, Andromeda and Teddy, and the Weasleys.
“Malfoy was wanton and dissolute,” Zabini admits. “To this day, I wonder whether Malfoy cast a spell over me. At the time, I only thought he was trying to seduce me into marriage, possibly with the aim of stealing all my own Mother’s Galleons. Three days later I had a far fouler shock.”
Personally, apart from the not-so-small incident of my overactive penis, I think our first Gryffindor revision session was the most fantastic success. Having both of our beloveds beside us helped Ron and I to stay focused far longer that we would have usually – you mightn’t have realised but there was considerably less Quidditch talk between the pair of us than was normal – and we only lapsed into our favourite game of magicked paper planes that on that one occasion, which I was very happy to say I won! I have to say, love, that your face was a bit of a picture. Are Slytherins all very orderly and proper about their schoolwork and revision? I hope you don’t think me too much of a child.
Merlin, I wish you were here beside me. My finger would quest inside of you, and I’d get to experience how hot, soft and tight you are once more. You don’t have a single clue, my lovely boy, how handsome your puckered entrance is. It’s as neat and refined as the rest of you and the most attractive shade of pink.
How are you feeling now? Has the elixir that Pomfrey gave you kicked in yet?  Do try and send me a message when you get this. Fuck, this morning… You really bloody frightened me.
“You are allowed to feel how you feel.” That’s exactly what I thought he would utter, even the phrasing. “When your thoughts spin around dark themes that drag you down, that make you feel guilty – do you think that that’s how you should feel?”
“Well, you’re in luck, darling,” I replied, “for I, too, like to listen to myself.”
My darling.
It’s been one of those horrible, nettling days and I’ve been a grumpy arse for most of it. Let me apologise in advance.
It seems they shared a few kisses and a few cuddles, but I didn’t get the impression that they’d gone any further. Seamus didn’t offer, and I didn’t like to pry.
Okay, first – you probably thought as much, but I’ll tell you either way – earlier today I was nervous. Immensely. You have no idea how often my hand reached into my satchel, brushing our diary as I thought about writing to you about chickening out. I’m so glad I didn’t.
I suppose what I’m trying to say – in a very awkward, roundabout way – is that I do find you, the real Draco Malfoy, tremendously attractive. Remember the pair of us talking about poetry months ago? I reread that Richard Barnfield poem, just now, and I was surprised exactly how much the subject of the poem resembled you. Red lips against pale, flawless skin. That was such a stark, erotic image, wasn’t it, Draco? Even back then I had a type, and I didn’t even know it.
Secondly, you shan’t stand up for me like you did. I can fight my own fights. And fighting my own fights will mean to keep my head down and my mouth shut while this probation lasts. I have no idea whether your Saviour splendour scared them off or not, but in my opinion it’s rather likely that they will seek me out. Alone.
journalists, the media uproar was both instantaneous and vile.
Pansy will certainly get the paragraph on the war and how our actions don’t necessarily define us as a person. I think it hits home. If she’s anything like the Pansy I used to know, talking about anything as grand as forgiveness or apologies that you actually really don’t owe her at all, Harry, would only hurt her pride and rile her up. I’m sure she won’t fail to answer with that sharp tongue of hers anyways.
Perhaps you’re a little bigoted by those glossy magazines like Witch Weekly in which everyone looks like a hairless, fatless, soulless Quidditch star. And okay, maybe I’m not opposed to looking at people like that from time to time. But I don’t know. Every body is different and there are different kinds of beauty. Somehow, I’m reminded of something a very wise wizard told me once: The deepest vault in Gringotts doesn’t buy you a decent personality. The best looks can’t do that for you either, I suppose.
It’s not that I don’t want to do well – I do – and get good grades, but the consequences of not doing such a top-notch job don’t seem to matter when we’re together. It’s entirely your fault, Draco Malfoy, that I have developed the attention span of a Pixie.
P.S. These train rides sound very romantic in a very awful kind of way. Coffee from paper (?!) cups sounds so completely abstruse that I need to try it now. Also, I will treat myself to some coffee now, getting the necessary motivation for my revision before we meet.
First of all: Please, dear Merlin, give me Crêpes Suzette. Right now.
I crave your touch. Can we meet tonight? If you agree, let’s meet in the Room of Requirement before curfew. Let’s see whether we will sleep there or not, but I need you. I need to feel your firm chest against mine, your weight on top of me. I want you prick trapped between us while I’m fingering you, Harry. I want you to cling to me, rub against me, your moans in my ear. Well, fuck. I better save my boner for later.
As for me: I’m going to call you Draco, because I know that is what your friends call you. It’s a pleasant-sounding name. It feels soft, when I roll the two syllables of it around in my mouth. When I test the sound of it on my lips.
The Auror only scoffed at my protestations.
Twenty minutes. Please don’t leave.
Looking on from a distance, pure-blood life always seemed a very narrow, straight path with little room for deviation. There didn’t seem many opportunities for having a belly laugh. I’m going to take a leap and say that it might have been that way for you as well, sometimes?
After we’d completed the allotted pages, the two of us ventured downstairs. I made you change into some of my scruffier clothes, which you hardly offered any objections to, and then the two of us padded down the rickety old staircase towards the dusty potion lab in the basement. We had our wands out in front of us, both of them lit bright with a Lumos, our path pitch black despite the March sunshine outside.
It has been many months since I was last described as a fainant, and the rude dragon that deigned it was a good idea to say it felt the sting of my wand. If such a creature might be in your company right now, then tell him that he is every bit as rude as he ever was.
You already sound like a true Mind Healer sometimes, you know that? But while we’re on the matter of self-care… When I looked into the mirror just now, the full-size one in the hallway – I think I filled out a bit, don’t you reckon? You too, I meant to tell you before but forgot.
the circle with gentle Lumos lights. I wasn’t sure whether I ought to join in – I felt like a terrible greenhorn – but Edward’s gran nodded her encouragement, so I cast my wand to glow along everybody else's.
I suppose that I see a lot of myself in Teddy, and though I know we can’t ever be his mum and dad, I do think that you and I could make sure he never felt alone. Make him feel less like an orphan, as often as we could.
“Harry,” you whispered, your voice a rumble and I loved it, because to hear my name in your voice is such a gift. Then you pulled the cloak from my head and kissed me, there and then, tangling those elegant fingers of yours in my knotty hair. Your lips teased at the seam of my mouth. You tasted like perfection, and I felt this lush, full tension radiate between us. We were alone, in love, and finally had the time to give each other the full attention that we’d been craving.
Darling, I know you’re worried – I am too – but nighttime thoughts always seem bigger and more vivid than those in the daylight.
My heart dropped to my feet when the proud words left our Headteacher’s mouth. I didn’t know whether your probation will prohibit you from attending, and I simply don’t want to be there if you aren’t standing by me.
My Harry, I’m glad that we made another family visit today. And one that might have been long overdue, actually, seeing that you met both of my parents ages ago. Well, yes, without the prospect of them being your in-laws one day, but…
Where was I? Mother. Well, I should start earlier. I think I told you that Glynis’s family came to visit for a few nights. They don’t seem to get along very well. It’s this kind of visit when both sides feel compelled to visit since it’s family and all, but they don’t actually want to see each other, you know? It’s my mother’s friend's nephew, – oh, mother’s friend is Glynis, by the way – his wife, and their two children. We don’t know them, darling they’re pre-Hogwarts. Older girl is ten, I believe. Or turned eleven? I forgot.
Alright. Time to sleep. I’m sorry for this long mess of words, but I ache for you, Draco.
My darling. I can hear the sound of Atkinson and Waters, at last returned from the cells. It’s finally time for me to leave this blasted, horrible place and come back to school, and back to you. I can’t wait. I’m famished, exhausted and I crave both your presence and your touch. As soon as I return, I’ll hurry to the Hospital Wing.
The Ministry chap grudgingly congratulated me on my Order of Merlin, and then he stepped back into the Floo. As soon as he was gone, the Headteacher turned her attention onto me. She told me to enjoy the ceremony, and that despite what I might believe, I did deserve the honour being bestowed upon me.
Today wasn’t my friend’s fault, not really. My Mind Healer says that I’m too reliant on the same friends that I’ve had for years, that I have attachment issues which come from a very fucked up childhood (and no, I’m not talking about that), and that I struggle to trust other people. The Mind Healers aren't wrong about that. My friends and I have always been really close but that was to the exclusion of other people.
I want to lock the memories of those people in a box, and then cast a
Let’s take this precious book back to Hogwarts. Hagrid shall have a look at it. After all, he’s the one who trained a whole flock of Thestrals in spite of all the superstitions there are about these magnificently eerie creatures (and most presumably in spite of several laws). I suppose most wixen would have run for their lives instead of trying to get involved with a flock of wild Thestrals in their forest of a back garden. Admittedly, I’m not sure if Hagrid will learn from the book or rather be able to add to it.
“Truth it is. I’ll give you an easy one, Harry, because you’re my best friend, and I happen to make the rules. Okay. Here is your challenge, should you choose to accept it. Imagine that it was possible to go back in time, and to talk to the Harry Potter that had only just returned to Hogwarts for his eighth year. What would be the three things that you’d tell him? And I’ll know if you lie, so don’t fib. You’ll feel the sharp end of my wand if you do.”
I know my mate still says he is committed to a life in the Aurors but I'll make a little bet with you now: that commitment won't last forever. Ron loves Hermione too much to ever hold her back, and if it comes to it, he'll sacrifice his career to let her have hers. Perhaps it won't happen for a couple of years, but it will eventually.
And your mum: is she a very powerful witch? A Seer or a person who knows the Old Magic? What you said about her in your last letter really piqued my curiosity and I would genuinely love to know her opinion. My St Mungo’s Healer – a fellow called Braithwaite – is excellent (though terribly full of his own self-importance) and I know he has been searching through some ancient old tomes in search of a complete cure for my uncontainable magic. Braithwaite says it is a very ancient sorcery that has affected me and that it may be years before I’m fully able to self-regulate myself.
I also added that I thought it had brought me luck, and that my marks had risen since I began to use it, but I expect she might scoff at that. It’s far more likely that’s the extra revision I’m doing because I enjoy the feeling of sitting beside you and sharing our afternoons. Don’t worry, I didn’t write the last part (but it’s true and I’m entirely a sap.)
Circe, I’m ridiculous. See you later.
As for the sex thing? I’m waiting until I meet the right person. Okay, now I know that I sound gauche, but I can’t help it. That’s my choice. You’ve probably been with lots of girls and that’s really great – you’ll get no judgement from me – but I want to be swept off my feet. I want a bit of romance.
I love you too, you completely infatuated dope.
Also, Mother waited till the very last moment to tell you about this vault. Filling the conversation with thoughts about love and magic and apologies. I’m not entirely sure whether all of it is genuine. Stalling for so long certainly was on purpose.
I wanted to Obliviate you, darling, I wanted to Obliviate everyone that had read Skeeter’s words.  I know that I ought to have stayed and comforted you.
Unfortunately, my DADA tutoring meant that I couldn’t start my detention until much later, but the silver lining is that I reckon I was given a much cushier task to complete than yourself. I’m up here in Trelawney’s tower classroom and have been tasked with polishing several dozen of her crystal balls to a high sheen, as well as sorting about a thousand tarot cards back into class sets.
Rita Skeeter is a repulsive, contemptible person, and the simple fact of the matter is that you and I sell newspapers. There’ll always be columns about us, love, but one day I promise they won’t be so venomous.
My aunt hated that she was related to a witch, and her jealousy over the fact had curdled into something ugly and bitter. I was a constant reminder to Petunia of her sister, both in my temperament and my looks, and she loathed entirely as a result.
“Maybe not,” I coaxed, letting my hand rest on top of yours, “still calls for a gentle hand, Draco.” Picking up the egg, the two of us broke it into the pan with two gentle taps, and we watched white turn opaque as it hit the heat and began to sizzle. “Look at that,” I said, looking at our slightly odd shaped eggs, and slightly burnt sausages and your pleased smile, “how clever are you, my darling boy? Not just a clever wizard, but domestic too.”
We didn’t even change our position or anything, but there was this moment that having your prick inside me went from feeling okay-I-can-handle-this to oh-sweet-Circe-yes. I completely understand now why you’re always begging me please when I’m inside of you. And while your heavy, hot cock pushed inside of me, your firm body moved against mine, gracing my leaking cock every so often with your movements. A wild combination of “Please, Harry, please,” started to tumble from my lips automatically.
The next day I Firecalled my Mind Healer, and we had a bit of an impromptu session. Please, please don’t hate me for this, but I let him read both of our last entries.
Have you heard any tales of last night’s Ball? It doesn’t sound like the sort of occasion where your good robes wouldn’t have been kept pristine for very long! The whole occasion sounded positively bacchanalian, with Amortentia-infused smoke bombs (a Weasley Wheeze?) and punch that had been adulterated with love potions. Actually, it all sounds dreadful and I’m glad I wasn’t there.
I love you.
While I’m musing about the future – and waiting increasingly impatiently for the morning to arrive – I wanted to commend your brilliant idea about selling to the Wheezes. Yes, yes, absolutely yes, this is a good idea.
I’m going to suggest something to you, something that has been playing on my mind ever since. No doubt you’ll disagree. Feel free to hex my idea with that terribly razor-sharp tongue of yours.
Ron had the audacity to take my first Pawn, and he said, “Merlin’s balls, I can’t say a thing without having someone at my throat.”
This honestly looks doable, as long as I’ve got you in my corner, loving and supporting me. I need to write an essay to gain entrance, explaining why Mind Healing is important, so I’ve no idea how I’ll condense my experiences into a couple of thousand words. It’s changed my whole, entire life.
The spell had been cast and your residency was changed, my darling. Your home was here with me, and I couldn’t have been happier. The Aurors Disapparated without a goodbye, and we fell into each other’s arms, the pair of us tearful, trembling, and so overjoyed. It felt every bit like our happy ending had begun.
I know you’ve had a shit day, Draco, but I love you.
Maybe take the Black pocket watch you gave me with you. If Mother doubts your loyalty, just show it to her. Tell her that it’s a courtship gift you gave me. You have no bloody idea how meaningful a gift this was. It’s something she’ll appreciate.
“I’ll do better,” I answered. “From here on, I’ll be a model student. No more sexy thoughts, I swear to Merlin.”
And I want to see my name on the tapestry, as well as Mother’s. Are you on it as Sirius’s godson? If not, you certainly will be once we’re bonded.
I’ll admit, I feel annoyed that you were taken to the Ministry without giving you fair warning. You sounded in your letter like you were blasé about such coercive treatment, but it wasn’t acceptable.
My mind at ease from the talk with Lulu, I went to see my Mind Healer then. You might think me nuts, but I had a list with topics I wanted to address with him. You see, sometimes when I’ve been seeing him, my mind was just blank, or I’ve been in a too good mood to think about my worries.
You thrust inside me then, pushing home until I was taking every inch of you, and I was stretched full. Soon you were pounding into me, flexing your hips, making me groan. We fucked with a pure, wild abandon until you wrung an orgasm out of me, one that made pure magic cascade through my veins. We lay, afterwards, breathless and panting in each other’s arms, cum slippery on our skin.
before we plunged into a relationship that was all-consuming and exclusive.
I meant what I said: I do love you – love every part of you – and when we bond our magic will be entwined too. The two of us shall never be parted, for a world without you is no world at all.
"Being closer surely has its merits," I offered, "though it'd be quite insincere to make these memories in the light of a friendship
A small laugh vibrated through your body, and you shook your head at me, pulling my face closer, scattering kisses everywhere but on my lips, warm and soft, running your hand through my too-long hair. After a moment, I took off your glasses and leant above you, making our kiss as deep and slow as possible. Lying half on top of you, I felt your hard-on in your trousers and pressed against the bulge, rubbing myself against your hip. Circe, this delicious moment lasted forever. Just thinking of the sensation of your tongue against my lower lip, against the roof of my mouth, and circling my own tongue sends a frisson though my entire body.
Answer me this, Draco Malfoy: how does the world have the audacity to keep ticking along after the experience that you and I shared? I don’t know how to say what I feel, how to give it the justice it deserves… It’s as if everything is somehow different but the rest of the world hasn’t caught up.
My Mind Healer has told me that this is a very normal reaction to events of great trauma, and that the events of the war will stay with its participants for the rest of their lives. I suppose that is part of the reason that I’m writing to you. I wanted to tell you I’ve come to understand that the events of the battle aren’t indicative of who any of us are as people.
I had better sleep, as I do want to pass Slughorn’s latest quiz, but I have just remembered something that I failed to tell you in the midst of the purple prose of my last entry. You asked me if I wanted children, and yes, I absolutely do. More than one, actually. You and I both know how lonely it is to be an only child. I mean, I say I want a family, but I’ve not a clue on how to be an actual dad. Even caring for Teddy for an hour while Andi visits her friends fills me with trepidation.
Tell me a bit about Ron and Hermione. I’m writing these names down, which you have probably noted with a sappy smile, but in my head, they are Weasley and Granger. Considering the amount of snogging they are doing, they will probably merge to Weasley soon enough.
He is honestly such a cherub that a person can’t help falling in love with him – and no, I don’t think you’ll be immune to his charms either, love – and that’ll simply be that. I’m as fascinated as you are by that blue silky material. What can your mother have kept precious for all these years and saved from the claws of the Ministry? Something that Andi would recognise? We’ll present it to her when we arrive, and I feel sure that we’ll find out more about this mystery then.
Good to hear that I’m still a bit intimidating. Means I haven’t lost all of my persona just yet.
I don’t tell you often enough, but you’re a great listener. You’re never pushy and you don’t try to change people to your own beliefs (which are profound enough to wish everyone was just a tad more like you in my opinion) but rather help them individually. You’re going to be a great Mind Healer, I’m sure of it. I so dearly hope that the exams will be in your favour so you can choose how to approach this dream. You’ll have me by your side, no matter what you do. Always. If I could, I’d break into McGonagall’s office and change all the exam questions to the ones I’m sure that you could answer completely free from any error. But I know how little you’d appreciate that, love.
The last few Ravenclaw games were ever so annoying to watch – the only reason they’re losing is their bloody Seeker. Merlin’s eyes, but I can’t watch her fly. Remember Chang? She was a Seeker through and through. Didn’t you have a thing with her?
Before I go to bed, I want to talk to you about my meeting with the Mind Healer. I would have spoken to you about it in the Great Hall, but Neville and Ron were there, and, as much as I love my best-friends, I’m not willing to share the inner workings of my psyche with them. That pleasure, my dear, is all yours to bear.
You’re rolling your eyes at me, aren’t you? Laughing at my romanticism. I can’t help it. I love you, and now we have proved it without a shadow of a doubt to the world. Not only have our bodies found their pair in each other, but our souls have too. It won’t be long now until we are bonded, and then our magic will follow suit, tangling and entwining until it will be impossible to tell where one of us begins and the other one ends. We’ll be together then, in the most elemental way.
I’m sitting in the library with Luna who seems widely unbothered by the impending exams. Whenever I shift with my bony arse on the too hard chair, I can still feel you inside me, and the illusion sends a shudder up my spine that manifests itself in a blatant smirk on my face. One of that dreamy kind that makes you want to roll your eyes at people who wear it.
Draco love? Will you talk to me? Send me a few lines so that I know that you’re alright?
Merlin, I’m sorry for being so sappy today. Somehow, I felt a bit wistful yesterday. I used to be so full of hate, pride, and scorn, Harry. My friendships were nothing like yours, except for Pansy, perhaps. And to a huge part that’s my fault. I was so full of myself, Merlin. I practically treated everyone as subordinates, deeming them inferior with a cocked eyebrow and a scathing remark.
But I worried you, my dear Draco, which has never been my intention. I owe you an apology. But of course there was no way to contact you or anyone else, for that matter, only my case Auror. You will surely understand that I refrained from bothering a busy Auror with sending notice of a mother’s love and her whereabouts. Please do not fret. Staying at the Ministry for a few days was hardly an inconvenience in the light of the splendid outcome. As I am writing to you, I am back in Whitby.
Apparently, this law course is a basic requirement for life in political office, and that fact that they are fast-tracking her through it now means that they must think the world of her, and rightly so.
I had a shrunken telescope in my satchel, but just looking upward with the bare eye was perfectly fine, love.
First things first.
“Hardly. It’s not nearly as complicated when you're related to the house – not that I’d know much about wandless magic though.”
Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.
A very early night will be the order of the day, and a lay-in until we’re almost late for school. That’s all I’ve wanted for months, Draco. I don’t know how you managed to swing a night of furlough with Professor McGonagall, but I’m certainly glad you did. That crafty Gryffindor is such a tremendous old brick. What do you think, love: ought we to invite her to our wedding?
I still can’t quite fathom how understanding McGonagall was about my missed lessons. I didn’t want to get into detail with you earlier, for we had so little time this evening, but I shall now.
Bracing myself for the next part with some Firewhisky really quick. Feel free to tell me what you think. And do tell me whether it’d be awkward to continue. Cause now comes the blowjob.
Before we had to part, I also told you that I’d love to spend Easter with you at Grimmauld. At home. I tell you, Potter, we won’t leave the bed. Except, perhaps, for the visit you suggested. Thanks for giving me some time to think about it. When Easter approaches, I’d definitely feel very comfortable, would you ask Andromeda before you stumble over her grate with the nephew in tow that she’s seen only once or twice and who probably had nothing but a cool stare for her, his nose certainly every bit as high up in the air as his mother.
. I was simply an awkward, green teenager who surprised himself by falling in love.
Well, Draco, you could imagine that I didn’t know what to say. Just like with Theo and yourself, this wasn’t the sort of conversation that I was used to having with Seamus. The two of us have always stuck strictly to safe subjects like Quidditch, homework and which professors are easiest to get off topic. Emotions haven’t ever figured in our top ten subjects of talk.
I love you. Okay. If you’re still reading, then you haven’t slammed the book shut. You aren’t horrified. I’m going to take that positively but please, please don’t feel like you have to reciprocate by saying the same back.
But seriously, Harry. I am not just putting up with you. I love you. Although I do get what you mean. I have a hard time accepting that someone as good-hearted and kind would want me. And this one is hard to describe, but also someone as important? Historically significant? I don’t know. You are my best friend, my beloved fiancé, and my celebrity crush, okay? I can’t help it.
Merlin, all these words… It’s my travelogues, I swear! Concerning your question: there are some places with somewhat loose regulations on the Statute of Secrecy. Especially if those places make a lot of money from dumb-struck Muggle tourists. No matter how obvious it gets, they don’t see that there’s magic involved. Not the way we do anyway. Britain is dreadfully strict on it though, you’re right on the wand there.
and the rest of the world awaited with bated breath. You’ll remember that Ginny and I had broken up a good while before you and I began to correspond.
It isn’t that the cards have been Transfigured from the money though, it’s technology. A bit like Muggle magic, basically. That’s what all those little sounds were: the computers reading the cards. Don’t worry, love. I know it all seems a bit intimidating now, but things will get easier with time.
Circe, I’m so relieved now. That she showed up. She must be well enough if she’s in custody and not in St Mungo’s. I just can’t quite know what this is about. But shit, she’s in custody of bloody Aurors right now… This can’t be good.
And that was that, wasn’t it Draco? It was well past midnight, and most of the party was exhausted, their adrenaline running low and the prospect of tomorrow’s early start weighing heavily on their minds. The last thing I wanted was you to leave me, so the pair of us crawled beneath my Gryffindor sheets, knowing that we’d never be forced apart, not ever again.
Oh, Draco, everything was so erotic, and it was as if we’d become the same person. You licked and sucked and kissed, and I melted into you as your movements gained force and speed, tormenting a nipple with your tongue and telling me that I was your beautiful boy, that I was your darling. Soon I was crying out your name, and grinding my hips down into yours, digging my heels into the bed for leverage
“Harry won’t be speaking to you, or any other person if he doesn’t have an actual speech written.” She stabbed at the bottom of the page with a finger. “And, here, at the bottom? It says that you need to owl a copy of what you intend to say back to the Ministry by this evening.” Hermione frowned. “That isn’t a lot of time, Harry.”
Anyway, no more rumour-mongering about Draco Malfoy.
With a wave of her wand, Hermione
Leaning in, I kissed you while I caught my breath and acclimated to your uncompromising fullness.
I genuinely have no idea how Mother imagined this would go, but I think she was equally scandalised and charmed, and I loved the expressions on both of your faces. If you ask me, this little gesture would have won her over if she hadn’t already sort of accepted that we are undoubtedly in love.
“Sole heir of a product many wizards use every day” – I have no idea what you’re talking about, but I’m intrigued.
For a small moment, I thought there’d be angry words – it was obvious that Gins felt uncomfortable, I could read that on her face – but then she seemed to shake off her upset. “I read Luna’s article,” she said, and I watched as she shoved her hands deep into her pockets and sighed. “She writes beautifully, and…yeah. She made some decent points.” Ginny nodded slowly. I wasn’t sure she was going to speak again but then she did. “What she wrote about you deserving to be happy, Harry? She was right… And if this – if being with Draco – is what’ll do that, then good luck to you.” Gins quirked you a half-smile and shook her head. “The pair of you? Luna’s correct. You’re a matched set. Can’t believe that I never noticed before.”
So please know that this isn’t in the slightest bit about how you looked at me or how you reacted. Or that we were hard for each other because Salazar knows you were not the only one who almost spilled at that delicious touch.
Your pace was dizzying and demonic. Anything I tried, you anticipated, and you were never more than a metre behind me. It was so bloody exhilarating to weave over each other, elbowing and shoving each other like we did. There, my darling, was the on-pitch foreplay that your cousin has observed. Your flying was dazzlingly chaotic and terrifying, fearless and bold. The broom was a part of you, my love, and I felt privileged to witness how unashamedly joyful you found flying.
Merlin’s teeth. Who, exactly, am I trying to kid?
Anyhow, what I actually mean to say is that – in my world – there’s no reason not to enjoy intimacy over the words we share. No matter if we are doing any of the things we say we’d be doing with each other in person (yet). I might even go as far as to claim that it might be a good way to learn about each other and perhaps even ourselves.
See you in Potions. I’ll try not to daydream and burn the contents of my cauldron.
My lovely boy. You’re asleep now, so you’ll read this when you awake.
I love you. I think I have to sleep now. Find me tomorrow. However demanding our timetables might be, I don’t want there to be a single day where we don’t find time for at least one kiss.
“You’re so tight,” you told me, your voice rich with love, “so warm, tight and so smooth. Fuck, but you’re so soft. I wasn’t expecting you to be so soft.” You took your time, just like you’d promised me, and it took me a few minutes to adapt to this new experience of fullness. At first my body was a tiny bit tense, wasn’t it, contracting a little at the unfamiliar new sensation, but very soon I got used to your fingers. I opened for you, naturally as a flower in bloom.
Poor bloody Nott. Merlin, but the poor man sounds like he is suffering dreadfully. Like I said before, I didn’t know him at all well during school. The wizard was a bit of an enigma to me. We shared lessons of course, but he blended into the background during my younger years.
But anyway, back to that lovely chat with the neighbours. One of them looked me dead in the eye, saying, “So, you must be the man in this relationship then, eh?”
The rest of the school don’t bat half an eyelid when they see us dressed in each other’s clothes. Besides, it wasn’t as if we were the only ones. I noticed that Theo was wearing a burgundy scarf, and that Hermione was wearing earrings with emeralds in them. That wouldn’t have been a coincidence, I’m sure of it.
He pulled the other boy to his feet, and with no further ado, gave him the snog of his life. Goodness gracious, Draco. As you very well know I’m hardly what you’d describe as a prude, but I honestly thought Seamus was going to devour the lad. He looked like a man who’d been lost in the desert and who’d finally found an oasis.
Darling, your face was priceless when I picked you up. “Looks like Harry Potter isn’t used to being manhandled around, now, is he?” I said. See, I’m not the strongest bloke, but I don’t need a Featherlight Charm cast on you in order to carry you a few steps. You grinned, so torn between laughing and blushing – it was the most adorable thing.
As you see, there are a few more things to consider. But I have a feeling that time will tell. Many of those things I mentioned? I won’t have to know the answer for another few months. And the longer I play around with all the options in my head, the clearer I will see what I want. And, of course, hearing your opinion on everything. That will help too.
Right now, I’m still wearing your tee-shirt. When you left after breakfast, I meant to take a quick bath and get changed, but I decided that that can wait. I’m not quite ready to banish this wonderful little waft of your scent that washes over me every now and again. Whilst feeling a bit ridiculous for missing you when you’re (hopefully) gone for only three or four hours, I genuinely can’t help the longing I feel.
His lips ripe strawberries in nectar wet,
Apropos of the Mind Healer – he even advised us to experiment, right? So the way I see it, we had better listen to his wise words. I’m sorry that you have to go without a taste of it for now. Let’s take it out on some fine races and spur on these lame school brooms tonight, shall we? Let’s find who deserves your little title as Master of the Snitch, (you must understand that this calls for your last name) Potter.
As for the reunion of the Black sisters? I have no idea, Harry. Mother has always been quite thin-lipped when it ever came to such topics. I can’t be sure what she’d think about it or whether her views on family and who honourably deserves a place in it (in her opinion, anyway) has changed after the war. I’d guess that it won’t come as naturally to her as it seems to come to Andromeda. But that’s only me anticipating the worst. I have seen so little of Mother over this past year that I honestly have no clue of what’s on her mind.
You might have replied then, but there was a forceful knocking on the door, and the two of us jumped apart, rather more like naughty schoolboys than two fully grown wizards in their own home.
You wanted to hear one thing outside of our diary that made me think of you. Something that reminded me of how much I loved you.
I thought back. Circe, but it felt like a lot of time since I’d met with the wizard, even though it was only a few months in reality. It wasn’t long after I’d found out your name, darling, and you were still hiding behind the tall walls in your mind.
I think Dean would have stormed off right after Seamus if Hermione hadn’t appeased him. “Dean, don’t worry,” she said. “I think Harry got the spells confused – telling from the sound and the colour of the spell, it certainly was the Leg-Locker that he had intended, not an Entrail-Expelling hex. The hex can turn out that way if you’re sloppy with your hand movement. There’s absolutely nothing to worry about.” But I had no idea that witch could be such a perfectly calm liar!
Ah, Merlin. I do know what you mean. People might see him for his Saviour act forever. I don’t know him all that well, but I do think that he deserves better for what he’s accomplished. Students should bloody stop gasping and parting to make way for Him Almighty already. To me, he looks like someone who wants to be left the fuck alone even though I once though that he’d do it all for the Prophet headlines. I don’t know how well you know him but believe me one thing: he’s bloody genuine.
I miss you. This is so daft – we’ve seen each other naught but an hour ago. However, I despair at the thought that I will have to endure the day without you until supper.
You didn’t even give yourself a second to recover, but leant down immediately, flattening your tongue over my prick until I came. Bloody hell, just thinking of it… Though I’m not even hard right now as I recall last night. But I positively shuddered while thinking of our orgasms.
I’m supposed to be observing the Gryffindor Reserves but they’re capable of a few dozen sprints around the pitch without me shouting the odds at them. It's bloody cold out here, but I’ve got my scarf on, and I’ve wrapped myself in a warming spell.
“That’s alright,” I said, laughing, as I closed every inch of space between us. “I'll do the cooking, lovely. You have other, far more spectacular, talents.”
I’m going to hazard a guess that Galleons, gold and magical items often used to hold great currency with many witches and wizards in your parents’ old set. I’m quite sure that she mentioned her plans simply to see if I would, after all, take the bait. Love, I’m not sure that there’s anyone on this whole earth that your mother trusts entirely, except, perhaps, for you.
“It’s such a romantic story,” I said, finding your eyes with my own. It was almost – but not quite – as romantic as our own.
We kissed then, lips meeting once more, and the taste of you was magnificent. I could taste your Teeth Cleaning Charms, and ginger crèmes, and I sighed into you, feeling your whole-body shudder as you surrendered into your pleasure.
Ancient Runes is over in a bit (don’t worry, I was done with today’s translation early and already handed it in, so I’m just doing my time). Definitely dinner afterwards, I’m completely famished.
We’ll prove all those naysayers wrong. I’m no fool – I know they’ll never stop writing about us – but one day it’ll be because we’re new fathers, or because we’re taking Teddy to the Hogwarts Express for his first day at school. Journalists won’t be able to fill their pages with tittle-tattle about us because we’ll be the boring epitome of domestic happiness. We won’t care. We’ll revel in it.
You explained to a very eager witch that your kisses don’t bring luck upon anyone, to which I chimed in that I could confirm that first-hand, earning a startled gasp from the witch and a crafty smirk from you. But when you turned back to me, you groaned, “Gods, when will this be over,” and I wasn’t sure whether you meant for the day or in general. Because I can assure you that it will be like that for the rest of your life. Or at least for a good few years.
If you’d let me, I’d kiss, and kiss, and kiss you, until we were panting and all out of breath.
Even if we’re stuck together in the UK for the foreseeable future – and no, I won’t be travelling anywhere without you beside me. I love you! – we’re still going to have wonderful fun.
But Circe, I’m still genuinely glad that we practised. You seemed impressed that I managed to cast Legilimens and I must admit that I was a bit nervous for it to work properly. That’s hardly a spell you can practise with just anyone. But I did manage. And you, too, were so much better than you let on before. It felt so safe and intimate, Harry.
If so, I hope that our friendship has given you some joie de vie and a bit of a different perspective on your life. You shouldn’t feel guilty about being your family’s mouthpiece while you were at school either. I cringe terribly when I remember how insufferably pompous, I used to be on occasion. I was very much in awe of old Dumbledore when I was a schoolboy and used to spend a lot of time defending him to anyone that would listen. In retrospect, most of what he said made absolutely no bloody sense, did it?
Remember what I said? That together you and I can face any obstacle? An obstacle is all that stupid, awful
However, before I meet your betrothed, I do feel very strongly that I ought to take the opportunity to offer the pair of you a very gentle rebuke. Public displays of affection, such as those you exhibited on the front of
I'm sorry to hear that you have problems sleeping. Trying to get through a day without a few hours of decent kip is bloody awful. It feels exactly like you’ve been hit with a Confundus, doesn’t it? The world is happening all around you, but you’re not quite a part of it. You’re just a spectator, peering in at the rest of the world.
Salazar, this is quite a long paragraph about your hair.
I’m yawning. I’m going to go lay beneath my sheets and think about every part of you. I love you x
And the day that you were…
“Better not think about it,” I said. “It’s pointless. We can’t contact them anyways.”
I will draw my entry to an end soon. There’s just one more thing I’d like to recall before I come downstairs to find you in the kitchen to discover what it is that emits these spicy smells. My mouth is watering as I write.
When you think about it, money is a bit of an odd thing, isn’t it? When you don’t have any, you don’t hanker after big, majestic items. You crave the small things, like a nice warm pair of socks, or an extra Kit-Kat. Truthfully, I don’t care how rich or poor you might be. The deepest vault in Gringotts doesn’t buy you a decent personality. I don't know. I suppose that's growing up without having any. Had I have grown up as well-off as our mutual chum Malfoy, then I’m sure that I’d hold a very different opinion.
Gracious. With all that fabulous yearning I’m surprised that I found time to eat my marmalade on toast.
I got the impression that Nott’s tale had upset you rather a lot, especially when you said quietly that you ‘understood his anguish in a way that nobody else might.’
