“You’re an idiot,” Draco responded, but a flush of color ran across his cheeks as he looked away and Harry counted it as a win.
“Or dragon taming,” Ron agreed.  “Although it would be easier if the band in question wasn’t treating us like we’ve got the plague.”
Draco leaned forward and rested his forehead on the table.  Harry reached out, hesitating for a moment, his hand hovering, unsure of his welcome, and then allowed his fingers to settle softly on Draco’s back.  Draco turned his head on the table and looked at him.  Harry’s full hand settled and he began to rub slow circles through the soft material of Draco’s shirt.
“The four of you,” Rookwood nodded, “and that marvelous spell you have developed.  The one that has shot you to fame and fortune in a matter of months in one of the most competitive markets on the planet.  The spell that can do that for you, can reach into the Magical world and draw out enough support to take down the ministry and set us all up in our rightful places.”
“Huh.  Well good for Malfoy.  He always did know how to land on his feet.  I hope it works out for him.”  Harry leaned back with a satisfied smile.
“You already said that,” Draco reminded him from where he sat on the other side of the room.  The blond’s eyes were squeezed shut as he pinched the brow of his nose.
Ron would send the owl off with extra treats as an apology for the early hour before climbing into bed with Pansy for a few hours before the crazy life he had chosen would drag him back out again.  Despite this, or maybe because of it, Ron would more often than not fall asleep with a smile.
“Yeah, you really have no business out in the field until you get your head together,” Harry agreed.
This was the last step, the last relationship he had carelessly laid aside for a career that had tried to take everything.  Ron raised his hand and knocked, then dropped to one knee.  The huge bouquet blocked most of Pansy’s expression when she opened the door, but Ron caught a glimpse of surprised pleasure as he peeked around them with a hopeful expression.  “I’m sorry,” Ron said as Pansy struggled to get control over her face.  “I was wrong and I won’t do it again.”
Pansy pushed him up against a wall to get his attention.  It was an obvious effort pushing his much larger frame around even though he wasn’t resisting her.  “Look, what are you doing here.  Surely you’ve had enough time to manufacture whatever evidence Robards wants you to plant.  Why aren’t you off with your girlfriend.”
Ron raised his eyebrows at that and Draco shrugged.  “They’re Malfoy Manor elves.  I did ask for volunteers, but it turned into a fight about who would have to stay home with mum.  They all wanted to come.”
“What is it?” Harry asked, reaching out towards the Bourbon, which kindly floated right into his hand.  It was a square glass bottle, clear with a black label.  The writing appeared to be in Mandarian.
“You’re wrong, Robards.  They are good, not just good, they’re great.  I’m not going to get into an argument with you about how that came to be, that’s just the way it is.  They are not cheating, the level of attention the ‘Sly’ band is receiving is perfectly reasonable given the performance.”  Potters volume started to go up at the end.
“I understand you were instrumental in tracking down these two scoundrals.”  Shacklebolt waved in the direction of where Rookwood and Dolohov were bound and waiting to be transported back to Azkaban.
“You are out of your mind.  You were on the back of a Norwiegian Ridgeback… voluntarily… for fun!  That camera has driven you right out of your skull.”  His volume rose to be heard over the noise of the band currently center stage.  “I thought you had calmed down after defeating Voldemort.  You walked away from the Aurors, been spending most of your time at home working on your house.  ‘Harry has turned over a new leaf’, I told myself.   But noooo … not you.  You were just waiting, biding your time, lulling me into a false sense of security until BAM! …. A new obsession.  A new reason to run around riding on dragons and getting up in the middle of the night and … and …. going out of your mind.”
“No, thank you for reminding me, Potter.”  With that empty expression, Malfoy’s face had gone back to looking skull-like, and Harry didn’t understand how it possibly could have been so attractive that he would lash out.  “It slips my mind sometimes,” Malfoy went on, “but not with people like you here to remind me.  Thank you ever so much for putting me in my place.  Is that all?”
“Right,” Harry said.  “So, come there and slum it with me, and you can think about how much better you are than all the Muggles.  You can even tell me how much better you are than all the Muggles. Just don’t tell anyone else—especially the Muggles.”
“But what?!” Pansy wailed and collapsed back on the uncomfortable looking chair.  This time Greg only got to six before she was up again.
“You are out of your mind. You were on the back of a Norwiegian Ridgeback… voluntarily… for fun! That camera has driven you right out of your skull.” His volume rose to be heard over the noise of the band currently center stage. “I thought you had calmed down after defeating Voldemort. You walked away from the Aurors, been spending most of your time at home working on your house. ‘Harry has turned over a new leaf’, I told myself. But noooo … not you. You were just waiting, biding your time, lulling me into a false sense of security until BAM! …. A new obsession. A new reason to run around riding on dragons and getting up in the middle of the night and … and …. going out of your mind.”
It was like watching a pensive in reverse; instead of seeing past memories, he was seeing future ones.  Endless nights spent with these people, strangers who could not be bothered to look up and say hello.  He would get back together with Hermione in the quiet camaraderie of working side by side buried under endless scrolls.  One day they would find themselves married for years, retired and looking at each other only to realize they were strangers, having lost the ability to have fun together or even talk about anything except work.
Ron nodded.  “I’m waiting for Harry.  If he caught the guy, we might have more to work with.  It won’t make any difference as far as the treatment and she obviously needed a minute before dealing with St Mungo’s.”
“I swear it … and maybe …” He took a deep breath, less sure about how to say this next part but willing to stumble forward for a bit longer if it helped. “Maybe you’re not perfect for Hermione or maybe you just need time or … I don’t know.  But if you’re not, then there is someone else out there you are perfect for … someone who is perfect for you.  Whether that person is Hermione or maybe … maybe someone else … Look it doesn’t matter.  You just gotta … just hang in there, alright? Because you’re my best friend and you’re always going to be perfect at that.  Alright?”
Charlie shrugged and glanced back towards the others and was watching when Ron, finally relieved of his burden, limped purposefully towards the bus.  Pansy ran to meet him.  Charlie flushed red and looked away from the resulting enthusiastic physical display.
“Well,” Miriam sniffed, “if that’s true, I’m glad to hear it.”  She turned back to Harry without even missing a beat.  “If you are going to be here anyway I will expect you to personally ensure the safety of the band going forward.”  Harry found himself dizzy over the speed Miriam changed from threatening him to ordering him around.
Draco, like his father, was found guilty of aiding and abetting the Dark Lord by the highest magical court in Britain, as though that were something of which to be ashamed.  Unlike his father, his youth saved him from the confines of Azkaban, although Lucius’ connections saved him from serving more than two years.  Today is the young Malfoy’s sentencing.  I wait and watch in the cold rain while inside the fools in power push him right into my arms.
Everyone has things they just can't handle reading.  Don't feel bad if you need to skip a section for your mental health.  This is supposed to be fun.  If it's not fun, don't do it.
“I’m familiar with Dolohov,” Charlie mused.  “Big burly guy, they used to call him Mr. Farmer.  Loved violence just for the sake of watching someone bleed and was one of the strongest duelers ever to go through Hogwarts.”
No matter how he tried to lead into it, his old Head of House refused to get drawn into a conversation about Draco Malfoy.  “I’m going to let you learn about Professor Malfoy from the man himself.”  She hid a smile behind her tea cup.
Ron took the bait, complaining wildly about his brothers’ wild antics and their continually increasing popularity.  The smiles became real as the two friends laughed and enjoyed each other’s company the rest of the way to Hogwarts.
Pansy just shook her head and walked away.  Her family held too many ministry positions for her not to know what taking this job meant.  Draco’s heart went out to her.
The words were lost to Harry, but the anger and passion was not.  He snapped shot after shot of the amazing energy that was Pansy and then turned his camera to the crowd as he realized how many of them knew every word, mouthing, singing, screaming along with her as she drove them into an even greater frenzy of energy and passion.
Bright grey eyes met his and a quiver of energy raced over Harry’s skin.  Malfoy looked away and with the tightening of his shoulders and the straightening of his spine the easiness of his stance was gone.  Harry felt a twinge of loss, regretting that it was his presence that had pushed Malfoy back into a defensive posture.  He gathered his wits about him and moved forward.
“Better,” Harry said firmly.  “Thank you for setting this up.”  As a professional Quidditch player, it was not often Harry got the chance to return to his first home.  That he got to do so now was a treat he was not taking for granted.  When the news came that there was not one, but two students at Hogwarts this year possibly good enough to play at the professional level, Harry had jumped at the chance to be the one to check them out.
“By Merlin’s beard, they’ve got you under their spell as well, haven’t they.”  Robards sneered.  “They’re like a disease, anyone who comes in contact is infected.”
“Come in!  Come in!  Look what I have.  One of the guys at the office got it for me.  It’s a Muggle electric salad bowl.”  Arthur beamed with excitement as he held the item out for their inspection.
Quitting was the easy part.  Shacklebolt had not been happy.  His complete inability to understand why Ron was leaving made the conversation more uncomfortable than it needed to be, in his opinion.  That bridge was burned.  If Ron ever needed to get his job back as an Auror he would never again rise to such a lofty position while under the current Minister of Magic.  Ron walked out of the ministry, feeling nothing but free.  Quitting was the right decision.
Harry did not see George until he moved, jumping out in front of the Peeves.  Whatever he held carefully covered is revealed for an instant to Peeves’ wide eyes.  The ghost hit the floor with a loud crash, sliding forward for several feet before the momentum finally gave out.  He was petrified.
“Listen, a bunch of us have ordered supper.  Why don’t you come join us?  Bring your work with you.  No need to stop just to eat.”
Loud familiar cords ripped through the quiet of the club. The unmistakable opening to Phantom of the Opera caught everyone off guard, grabbing attention as the unexpected sounds resonated through every chest.
“No, I don’t think so. I think bottom up shots will be more dramatic. I’ve been checking out pictures of famous bands performing and a lot of the best ones are bottom up action shots. I think this is good right here, actually.”
“Those aren’t bad,” Ron said several minutes later as they went through Harry’s collection of Norberta.  “A couple are pretty good actually.”
“I’m sorry sir, I really haven’t seen anyone who looks like that,” the lady said without looking up from her desk.  “Now if you will excuse me, I really am very busy.”
“There is no spell,” Draco insisted, feeling like he was speaking into an empty space with no one listening.
“You mean without the original caster’s wand?”  Draco clarified and both Ron and Harry rolled their eyes.  Suddenly they weren’t missing Hermione so much after all.
“Oh, it’s Robards.  He’s as barmy as ever, sure that Malfoy is out there trying to take over the world with his band.”
Harry righted a chair next to Draco and plopped down into it.  “Any thoughts on what they might want?”  He tried to keep his question kind.  Draco looked stressed enough for both of them.  The blond just shook his head.
Charlie hummed his agreement.  “Seemed to think this whole thing was a waste of time, that is until he saw yo.  He’s got a real bone to pick with you.  What did you do, kill his pet or something.”
“Oh you’ll love this.  I guess everyone just assumed they wouldn’t be able to find any work worth doing and so no one thought to limit what kind of job they could take.  As long as they weren’t using magic and could prove they were working regularly there were no other stipulations.”
“Are you asking me to explain Robards?  Because I’ll tell you right now, man, I’m out, not happening, no way.”
“I just want to stay, see this through.  I don’t know, figure out a way to let the band know we’re not here to … you know.  That we’re on their side.”
Draco felt like Harry had hit him.  All the air left his lungs in a hard exhale as he tried to comprehend what Harry wanted.  ‘But you’re going to die, you barmy prat.’  The thought pounded in his brain, trying to get out past his empty lungs.  ‘Don’t make me watch you die,’ he pleaded into the awful nothingness of his own mind.
“Barely,” Harry cringed back as the dragon stepped closer.  Ron, great friend that he was, managed to keep Harry firmly between him and the Dragon.  It felt like a repeat of the trip to visit Hagrid’s spiders.
“That was not at all the meeting I was hoping for.  What happened?  Surely that all can’t be just because we showed up,” Harry asked, finally moving to sit next to him.
“It’s minor.  I figured it out while I was riding around on Noberta.  With the wind and her moving beneath me I was having a hard time keeping things steady.  It’s just a little bit of help in case I get jostled.”
“He had a sister, or two sisters maybe … anyway.  She’s a squib.  I remember because she came here once looking for father, needed help with something legal.  She had gone to work in the Muggle world.”
Pansy shrugged.  “Doesn’t sound like you were too clingy to me.  Sounds to me like she was committed to something else, namely her job.”
“That’s right, Augustus Rookwood.”  Ron said.  “You’d know him if you saw him, I think.  He’s got pockmarks and scars all over his face.  Loves mental games, twisting you up in your own mind ‘til you don’t know which way is up.  I think he got picked up after the battle.  Didn’t the Malfoy’s tip the Aurors off on where to find him?”
Draco’s eyes narrowed at her but before he could follow up, Greg burst in through the bus door singing full out.  “Oh what a beautiful morning!  Oh what a beautiful day!”  He was off key, one arm swept out in front of him as he danced across the room.  “I have a date!” he yelled as he got into the center of the room.
“No thanks.  I’m going to spend some time working with the camera.  Assuming Lockhart lets us stay, I’ll like to feel a bit more like I knew what I was doing.”
“You mean the Goblet of Fire tasks?  Naw, she wasn’t trying to eat you, just protecting her eggs.  ‘Sides, the way I remember it, you managed to keep ahead of her.”
McGonagall narrowed her eyes at both of them.  “You two are not getting this back.  Hagrid, come help Mr. Weasley here transport Peeves to the infirmary.”
“No, I’m not ready to give up just yet.  I’m not sure how we’re going to change things, or where to go from here, but … I don’t want to leave yet.”
“I don’t know,” Draco confessed and with his relief, his mouth open and everything he had been thinking since the attack came pouring out.  “I had been expecting someone to show up.  Right after the trial, or after the escape.  I was so sure that with Father’s position among Voldemort’s inner circle and my own unfortunate involvement that someone would try and recruit me.  I’ve kept an eye on Greg as well, since he is as likely to be approached as I am,” Draco paused, taking a deep breath before continuing.  “So, I was expecting that; either a blackmail attempt or a push to provide resources.  Something like that. but this doesn’t make any sense to me at all.  Why Pansy?  Her family wasn’t involved, at least not in any substantial way.  The only reason Pansy ended up on trial was because she had the balls to suggest turning you over to Voldemort to save everyone else.  Umm… sorry.  No offense,” Draco said with a slightly sheepish turn up of his lips.
“Just be careful,” Harry said, wandering back into the conversation.  “Could be this is more than just one disappearance.  There’s also the two Death Eaters that escaped from Azkaban a while back on the loose and they could be anywhere.”
“What?  You didn’t ...”  Ron cut himself off and then pulled closer.  “You didn’t do anything to the camera did you?”
Draco pulled her to him.  She resisted for a moment before giving in to bury her face in his neck.  He forced his own eyes away from the horror in front of them.  Surrounding them was close to fifty wizards or witches in black clocks, the oldest of which were barely out of their teens.   Draco was very familiar with what it was like to find yourself following a mad man with no idea how you came to be there.  Most of the youth watching wore an expression he knew he himself had worn as he watched Voldemort perform similar acts of abuse.  As much as he wanted to yell and demand they stand up to Rookwood and Dolohov, that together they were strong enough to take them down, Draco knew it was no use.
“Have you seen Malfoy?” Harry asked Ron.  The two of them were battling their way out of the stands with the rest of the student body.
It was at that moment the doors to the dining hall burst open.  Every head turned to see Peeves tumble in, careening out of control and moving way too fast with Fred Weasley right on his heels.  The two ghosts shot across the room with students screaming and scrambling to get out of the way.  Everyone at the head table, including Harry, Ron and Draco were on their feet, wands in hand.
Robards and I both watch him leave.  It was a brilliant line and an impressive exit.  Even Robards seems to know he has been bested as he storms back into the Ministry of Magic.
“These kids have been through enough already without getting dragged into whatever horrid trauma you seem to attract wherever you go.”  Miriam glared at Harry as though he were evil incarnate while Harry pushed back, hands raised in a show of surrender.
“You’re right, of course you are right.  But what do we do!?  He’s my boss Harry.  It’s not like I can just tell him he’s being a twat.”
She turned on Harry without letting Draco get so much as a word in edgewise.  “Harry Potter, if I find out that this is in any way your fault you will be out so fast it will make your head spin.”
Pansy hunkered down next to them.  “You’re a Weasley.  Of course you would be interested in things that explode.”
“What did Robards do now?” Harry asked, having heard too many rants about Ron's boss to be in any doubt who was involved.
It was hard to see someone else getting something that you wanted desperately.  Harry Potter knew that feeling better than most.  He would have to keep an eye on that kid.  A young man capable of staring heartbreak in the face and still maintaining his dignity might also have the strength to fix his seat on his broom after years of doing it wrong.  Yes, Harry would definitely need to keep an eye out.  Smiling, Harry resumed his trek towards the Slytherin team.
No, the time to approach Draco Malfoy is after he has been forced to work in the Muggle world, to do the manual labor he will be forced into without a wand or the resources of his family wealth.  A few months should be all it will take to break that lovely spirit.  Until then, I will simply live in anticipation of having such a passionate young man under my thumb.
Ron asked something, but the noise in the Grand Hall had increased and Harry was too far away to hear.  Harry drifted closer.  Malfoy’s posture remained casual and easy, comfortable in Ron’s presence.  Malfoy waved an elegant hand off in a direction and the red head nodded his thanks.
“Why don’t you go find Ms. Lockhart, the ‘Sly’ band tour manager.  Tell her we’re here and say we’re sorry for being late.”
“Hmm… I hate to cause trouble, especially with all that the poor man has gone through, what with his skin condition and the constant pain he must be in, but …. well it just seems to me that trying to head up the Aurors might be a bit much for him.  I’ll chat with Kingsley.  He’s been run off his feet as the new Minister of Magic but I think he’ll appreciate a heads up.”
Harry nodded.  “If that didn’t get them interested in the healing arts nothing will.  Wasn’t Peeves involved in that somehow?”
He gathered the tatters of his courage and composure around him.  Then taking a deep breath he turned to Rookwood and said simply, “No.  No I won’t join you.  Not now, not ever.”
It was enough to help Draco pull his own shattered composure back together, despite the black spots in his vision and the pounding pain at the back of his head.  “There is no spell,” he said flatly.
The tone and submissive stance worked.  Malfoy’s posture eased out of combat mode and his brow creased in confusion.  “Well, I guess we will see.”  He shifted a bit in discomfort.
“We’ve got the wards to keep him out, but he’s got something on the door to keep us in.”  Draco said, waving to the front door behind them.
“No, it’s alright.  Actually yes, I was hoping to have you loosened up a bit before I …”  Draco pushed away from the bar, running his hands through his hair.  “I need to apologize.  For a lot of things, actually.”
Pansy waved him off, not even bothering to respond but Draco sat up straighter in his seat.  “Wait, … isn’t … what was that Professor’s name, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher … the bad one.”
“I’ve never had the chance to be in charge before,” Ron called after her.  She did not even pause.  Ron looked back at Harry for help.  “I’ve always been chasing after you, or my brothers, trying to keep up.”
It was a conversation, Harry realized.  Malfoy and the crowd singing to each other and there were people around him who knew every word.
“Absolutely out of your mind, “ Ron grumbled again, but it was more of a shout now. As they fought their way towards the stage, it became an increasing struggle to be heard over the noise of the speakers right in front of them. “Hey, don’t you want to get higher up so you can see more of the stage?”
Greg’s lips pulled in the tiniest of smiles from the warmth that filled his chest at his friend’s defense.  It was odd though.  In school, Greg would never have assigned the term of friendship to himself and Draco.  Since Crabbe’s death, something had changed in Draco.  He had become more protective of him, checking on him to see if he was alright, including him in things, not just as muscle but as though he mattered.
“Your dating one of the groupies?” Draco collapsed back into his chair, his legs failing to hold him up.
“Getting up right before sunrise isn’t the middle of the night,” Harry shot back good naturedly,  “ and the light is better first thing in the morning.”
“I’ve had boyfriends like Hermione.  Draco was like that in school, always wanted me available when he needed someone hanging off his arm, otherwise I was just an obstacle in his quest to take down the great Harry Potter.”
It was a close game but despite scoring no other points, in the end the Gryffindors won due to a lucky catch by their Seeker.  However far he had come, Harry could not help smiling in nostalgia at the win.
“Yes,” Rookwood said.  “Very clever, that spell of yours.  I admit you have successfully hidden it, even from me.”
“That’s great,” Ron said, obviously confused.  Whatever point Malfoy was trying to make was going over his head and Harry’s too for that matter.
Ah, the sentence.  To have the details of Malfoy’s sentence delivered to me like a present is more than I could have hoped for.  It is delightfully insidious.  A year, working without magic among the Muggles.  I chuckle softly in delight.  A sentence designed to bring the spoiled Malfoy heir to his knees.  Young Malfoy has not been made to work a day in his life.  He has been taught to rely on magic and money to provide the best the world has to offer.  To be forced to find employment among Muggles strips from him the two things he has always relied upon.  It is a sentence designed with humiliation in mind.  From the anger in Malfoy’s face, he knows it.
Hermione laughed, “Oh Ron, Robards was one of our regulars.  Your old boss was down here with us practically every night.  Trust me, with this kind of job, you never get on top of the paperwork.”  She pushed the door open to the refectory and walked in.
“You’re trying to set me up with a guy,” Harry exclaimed.  He might not have gone into the Aurors but that did not mean he was slow at putting puzzle pieces together.
The brilliant retort he was working on was cut off when Miriam swug through the doors, a merry smile on her lips.  “You’re all here!” she said with more enthusiasm than the situation warranted.  “I have fantastic news.”
“Nothing,” Ron said with a shrug.  “Even less about Muggle photography, excepting that my dad probably has a Muggle camera around somewhere I can borrow.”
After the remains of the food fight were banished or consumed they would usually lay listening to Pansy work on her rapping while Greg provided the beat, Harry and Draco would go back to their fascination with each other's mouths and Blaise would abandon them all for his piano.  Sometimes Ron would think of that dark refectory and its occupants shushing each other if they made too much noise.  On those nights, when the band finally crashed as the first streams of daylight were peeking in the window, Ron would take a moment to pen an owl to Hermione.
Harry smiled.  “I have to admit, this taking pictures thing is addicting,” and with that he wandered off to take more shots of Norberta.
“Everyone is going to be excited for the reprieve from Peeves and his pranks,” Ron said.  It was no doubt the subject everyone in the room was now discussing.
“We won’t hold that against you,” Draco said as though that were the issue, but then followed up with “It will be fun,” and tossed him a wink.  “I can do the lead vocals and guitar,” Draco went on.
A jolt of pleasure shot through Harry when the beautiful man in front of him glanced down from his eyes to his mouth and back.  Harry leaned forward, working his way closer to those tempting lips.  It was getting difficult to remember what they were talking about but he was desperate to keep the conversation going, to draw this moment out as long as he could.  “Fred could be visiting Peeves.  Aren’t they friends?”
He found himself staring once again into bright green eyes.  That’s right.  He was trying to save Harry.  Harry who had believed him when there was every reason to be suspicious, who had stood by him and Pansy against Robards, who had treated this investigation into the attack of a Slytherin, a girl who had been willing to turn him over to certain death to save her own skin just a few years previous, as though it was just as important as an attack on one of his own close friends.  Draco could do this.  This time he could save Harry.
The buildings that house the Ministry of Magic are shrouded and dark, as though the intermittent sun refuses to shed its’ light on the new regime.  The magical government, once the proud beacon of order and law, has fallen into shadow.  Since the Dark Lord’s death, the ruling body has descended into the chaos of the ages of old, run by Mudbloods, blood Traitors and Muggle lovers.  Rain trickles down, half hearted and dreary, as though even it cannot fully commit to moving forward in these dark times.  The death of my Lord has cost us much, the setback to the cause is almost overwhelming.  Rebuilding now is a process so slow and achingly painful, it is almost not worth the effort.
“He’s right, you know,” Blaise put in.  “You and Pans both have had training, growing up in wealthy homes, that Greg here did not get.”
Draco joined in.  “You do know that not a single Death Eater was better than he was at dueling and none who loved it more.”
Pansy tucked a strand of hair behind her ear before looking up at Ron from beneath her lashes.  “Do you want to come check out the tour bus?  The bans on magic don’t apply there since no one goes in but us.  Draco spared no expense and the whole thing is magically expanded, one of the largest hidden living spaces outside of Grimmauld Place.  It’s pretty sweet.”
Charlie nodded and both he and Ron moved closer to lend their support.  “That was a tough battle, although as I recall, it was Professor Flitwick that finally took him down.”
Draco raised his empty hands without the slightest expectation that it would do any good.  Neither Dolohov or Rookwood had any intention of going that quietly.
“No, she’ll be good.  She’s rather friendly with people, unlike most of the other Norwegian Ridgebacks on the preserve.  Probably because of her time with Hagrid.  And there is a good chance she’ll even remember you.  Dragon memories are amazing.”
“Robards.”  Arthur Weasley’s voice was calm but firm as he and Shacklebolt walked up behind them.  “As an Auror you are supposed to be an impartial executor of the law.  That you already have your mind made up is worrying.”
The clack of heels are loud in the silence of the after hour building, startling Ron into looking up from his paperwork.  “Hermione!” Ron smiled, pleased to see a friendly face.
Everyone poured back into the center area as the lights dimmed. Harry found himself holding his breath. Bodies moved in the darkness. A hush fell over the whole club as they all waited.
Draco closed his eyes.  There was some comfort in knowing Rookwood was in for an unpleasant shock when he finally tried to rip the information from him the way he had tried with Pansy.  Still his mind raced desperately searching for a way out, another path other than what Rookwood had in store.  The blind panic and overwhelming helplessness seemed to take him back in time.  He was standing in a Hogwarts tower at night, wand in hand, facing down an helpless old man that he had never before seen as anything but a conniving enemy.  The struggle for a way out, a different path, both then and now blurred into one.  Dumbledore had fallen and Harry would soon follow him down and Draco, for all his pride in his own intelligence, could not save either one.
Harry reached after him but Draco couldn’t … he couldn’t.  Breaking away, Draco darted off the floor and into the night.  He heard Harry call after him and the small boy deep inside begged him to stop but he couldn’t … he COULDN’T!!
“Relax Potter.  If they wanted us dead they would have done that already.”  Draco said from his seat at the table.
Rookwood dove for Draco.  Unarmed, Draco lept backwards, away from the attack, only to run into something firm and warm and BIG.  Rookwood switched directions so fast he ended up on his butt, scuttling backwards like a crab right into Ron.  “Gotcha, you creep.” Ron said, ripping Rookwood’s wand from his hand.
Malfoy stood gracefully and ran his hands down his front, smoothing out non-existence wrinkles on his barely there clothing.  “Pansy has been eloquent as always.  I believe there is nothing left to say.”
Draco eased fully around the corner he had been hiding behind as Robards stormed away down the corridor.  He was not sure of his welcome, to be honest, as Harry (when had he started thinking of him as Harry?) turned to face him, looking angry and frustrated.
“I’m trying to imagine Draco Malfoy’s expression if anyone had the temerity to actually call him ‘snookums’ to his face.”  Harry bumped shoulders with Ron and Ron bumped back as they headed out.  Two best friends, side by side, ready to take on the world.
“I don’t suppose you want to take a break and come hang out with us as we chase Malfoy all over the UK,” Ron asked his brother as Harry clicked happily away.
Draco did not know how to begin to respond to that.  Everything had been so different from what he expected lately.  He kept being surprised in a good way, things kept working out better than he had hoped and it was freaking him out.  Good surprises were just was not the way life worked out for him.
The door hadn’t even fully closed before Miriam Lockhart was rounding on them.  “I had thought better of Robards, and I certainly thought better of the two of you.  Let me warn you Harry Potter, those pictures you took today had better be amazing, they had better knock my socks off, because as of right now I am looking for any excuse to kick both of you right off the tour.”
“Yes.”  Shacklebolt nodded and Harry nodded back, satisfied, but the Minister was not done.  “But that leaves me with an open position that I urgently need filled.”
After waiting so long to be anything to Harry but an enemy, to have finally gotten his friendship and the possibility of so much more, he found a deep well of rage battling to come out that these two men would try and take it all away from him now.
“Yeah.”  Harry said, but his heart was not in it.  Shaking himself firmly, Harry turned to face his friend.  “Any luck?”
It had been their anniversary.  Ron had been planning it for weeks: the perfect restaurant, flowers, wine, a nice evening out for the two of them.  Harry had helped him plan it.
Greg looked around the room at these people who were his closest friends.  He was nervous … but he was not alone.  He shrugged.  “Sure?” he said, knowing it came out more a question than a statement.
“Excuse me, sir, have you seen this man?”  Harry said, grabbing a random man who happened to be walking by.
“I’m sorry,” he said in a tone that implied exactly the opposite.  “I’m afraid you Weasley’s all look the same to me.  Which one are you again?”
“Are you sure,” Shacklebolt asked from outside the enchanted world of Harry’s delicious smell.  Draco was not worried.  He felt Harry’s response rumble up from the depths of his chest like a seismic event.
It was a conversation, Harry realized. Malfoy and the crowd singing to each other and there were people around him who knew every word.
What came out next was neither planned nor carefully coached, and yet Ron knew was surprisingly perfect, especially coming from him.  “I plan to follow you around and worship the ground you walk on.”
“Molly is a good woman, bless her, but she doesn’t have a timid or shy bone in her body.  One of the reasons I fell in love with her, to be honest.”  Arthur beamed, every inch the proud husband.
“The Slytherin Keeper?”  Harry asked.  He hated to answer but he wasn’t going to lie.  Someone should have taught this Gryffindor not to ask questions he did not want the answer to.  “Yes, I am.”
And while Pansy rapped, Malfoy danced. It was breathtaking and erotic. The blond gyrated wildly behind Pansy, his long, lithe body a physical representation of the music pouring off the stage. Harry could not take his eyes off of him. Sweat darkened his hairline and gleamed on his chest; the shiny green pants almost black with sweat leaving little to the imagination. Malfoy was hard, his aroused state obvious and thrilling on the bright stage as he danced for the crowd. Just like that, the ache in Harry’s chest inspired by the mourning and loss of the song transmuted into something else entirely.
The music was fantastic, snarky and upbeat and catchy. Malfoy crooned into the microphone, his rich voice rumbling down every spine as he sang.
Harry dragged his attention back to what he was doing.  “Down boy,” he told himself and then chuckled at how literally he meant that.  The relationship with Draco was going somewhere.  He could feel it.  Harry just had to be patient and wait until Draco was ready.  In the meantime, Harry needed to do what he had always done, protect those he cared about.
“Oops,” Blaise responded to Draco with a cheeky grin and the laughter picked up even louder than before.  “We’re not playing Phantom today are we?”
“Why don’t you go find Ms. Lockhart, the ‘Sly’ band tour manager. Tell her we’re here and say we’re sorry for being late.”
Charlie just shrugged.  “We’ll see.  If he really is a changed man then I’m all for it, just watch your back.”
“I have this thing about Norwegian Ridgebacks,” Harry said, not the least bit embarrassed about the fact he was cringing away from the Dragon.  “It probably comes from the time one tried to eat me.”
Hours later, as Draco watched the sun rise over the streets he had walked restlessly all night, he admitted one thing, if only to himself; maybe Harry Potter did have a crush on him.
Pansy shrugged.  “Why do you think I learned how to rap?  Mother hates it, but when she’s yelling about it, at least I have her attention.”
“For Merlin’s sake why?  You haven’t changed your mind, have you, about the band enchanting people to like them?”
Taking down Voldemort as a teenager did not necessarily mean he was the best security in the business, but he wasn’t going to argue the point.  As the conversation with Draco seemed to be well and truly over for the moment it did give him an excellent out.  “I’d best get to it then,” he said, getting up.  It wasn’t even remotely a lie.  Since Robards seemed to be of no value there were a few favors Harry needed to call in and a manhunt to organize.
“Absolutely out of your mind, “ Ron grumbled again, but it was more of a shout now.  As they fought their way towards the stage, it became an increasing struggle to be heard over the noise of the speakers right in front of them.  “Hey, don’t you want to get higher up so you can see more of the stage?”
The feelings were real and powerful and addicting. Harry was swept up in the song, mourning opportunities missed, things that got left behind and lost along the way. It did not matter that his losses were different from Malfoy’s. The true genius of the song was that it didn’t matter. ‘Come mourn with me,’ the song seemed to say, ‘and we will be stronger as we mourn together.’
The opening act closed up after another song and everyone took a moment to catch their breath.  The crowd dispersed a bit and people wandered off to get drinks as the crew started re-arranging the instruments and equipment on the stage.
“Oh Merlin, don’t even get me started …” Ron said raising his head but the smile he wore was real even if his eyes were still damp.
Just when Harry thought he knew what to expect, the song changed.  The soft lyrical tones that had overlaid the driving beat suddenly changed to something hard and fierce.  Pansy ripped the microphone away from Malfoy and started rapping at an intense pace.
A pointed smile in Weasley’s weather-beaten face said he could guess at least some of what Draco was feeling about his ‘little lady’ and was more than a bit amused.  Draco had been a Malfoy too long not to respond.
And while Pansy rapped, Malfoy danced.  It was breathtaking and erotic.  The blond gyrated wildly behind Pansy, his long, lithe body a physical representation of the music pouring off the stage.  Harry could not take his eyes off of him.  Sweat darkened his hairline and gleamed on his chest; the shiny green pants almost black with sweat leaving little to the imagination.  Malfoy was hard, his aroused state obvious and thrilling on the bright stage as he danced for the crowd.  Just like that, the ache in Harry’s chest inspired by the mourning and loss of the song transmuted into something else entirely.
“Here, let me see,” Harry took the camera from Ron.  “My uncle had one of these when I was growing up.  I don’t think it was as nice as this one though.  Look at these settings … portrait, landscape, indoors and outdoors.  Nice.  Do you have a charging station for the flash?”
Harry just shrugged.  “It helped that it was mutual.  It was an idea we tried that didn’t work.  Ginny’s support of the whole thing took a bit of the wind out of your mum’s sails.”
Pansy was humming as she walked.  It was a bright, clear day with a chill in the air that made one want to walk briskly.  There were others on the street, but not so much that it was crowded.  Pansy was rummaging through her purse as she walked, making sure she had muggle money handy, when the attack came.
“Think of something else,” Draco counseled himself.  Like the Patronous spell, these demons could only be driven off by other, happier thoughts.  It was not a spell that Draco had ever mastered and he despaired that fighting his demons would be just as impossible
“Probably not,” Draco said, taking the bottle and replacing it with a glass.  “I took a bit of a risk here.  Let me know if you like it.”
Harry had to admit to himself that he wasn’t listening when ducked down a deserted back street and finally got the bike in the air.
“He says they’ve made some headway, but no real leads yet.  I guess a bunch of the kids that disappeared have been hanging around the same group of malcontents.  You know, anti-government, anti-parents, anti-everything types.  Not all of them, but enough he thinks there is something to it.”
Did he also know they would be able to save him?  It might have been a possibility, but not one worth risking his life.  And yet, that is exactly what Harry had done.  Instead of encouraging Draco to give them whatever assurances they needed to get him down so that they could all be rescued, Harry had insisted Draco stand firm.
The music was fantastic, snarky and upbeat and catchy.  Malfoy croned into the microphone, his rich voice rumbling down every spine as he sang.
Buried beneath mounds of paperwork are two owls from Harry, one from his dad, another from Charlie and three from his mother.  He will get to them, he will, just a couple more reports to review first.
Ron knew something, he could tell.  Harry grinned and wiggled a bit forward in his seat.  Talking about Ron’s brothers was almost always fun and rarely serious.
The amusement slowly fade as the fire died down and his feelings shifted back to the strange unease that he often felt in regards to Malfoy.  It felt like somewhere along the way he had missed something.  Going back over their history together, Harry was still not sure what he could have done differently, but that did not stop him from feeling like somehow he had missed his chance at something.
“Oh, I won’t be doing this for very long,” Ron waved the offer away.  “I am just trying to get on top of the paperwork.  You know, just putting a few extra hours in at the beginning to help ease into this.”
Realizing that any additional protesting was fruitless, Harry just held out the SD card out of the camera.  Lockhart picked up the card with two fingers and held it between them like a threat.  “A - maz - ing,” she said again and shaking her head, walked out.
“It’s never been about us, Harry.  He’s got something against Malfoy and … we’ll he’s just unreasonable.”
“I have been fighting prejudice against Slytherin house since I took the position as Potions Master.  My personal contributions to the war have done nothing but made the existing bad feeling even more intense.  To find Harry Potter, who has more reason than most to have negative feelings, displaying none towards me or towards my students is a surprise.”
“Are you glad we did this?”  Ron asked, his familiar voice merging so seamlessly with the voices of the past that it took a moment for Harry to realize he had actually spoken.
“No, I don’t think so.  I think bottom up shots will be more dramatic.  I’ve been checking out pictures of famous bands performing and a lot of the best ones are bottom up action shots.  I think this is good right here, actually.”
He was wearing a golden shirt that flowed, undone down to the navel and tight enough in all the right places to leave little to the imagination.  Draco’s chest was smooth and nicely curved.  He didn’t have Harry’s washboard abs but there was nothing extra on the tuck of his flat tummy.  Forest green velvet pants, tied at the waist with a wide sash that shimmered like silk in the club lights and leather boots completed the look.  He seemed to transcend common concepts like gender.  It was like a godling, one of the heroes of Greek legend, brother to Apollo, friend of Hercules and Perseus, had stepped out of the legends of the ancient past to grace them with his presence.
Gawain Robards was head of the Aurors and Harry’s boss.  Draco had been owling him and signing Harry’s name to excuse Harry’s absence, which was something Harry hadn’t even considered until now.
They sent the owl off, and Draco followed Harry back to the bench with the Life Water on it.  Thinking how terrible it would be if the bottle broke, Harry thought of something else for Draco to do.  “These are instructions your older self left for me,” Harry said, handing Draco the ledger.
“Not everything is about payment and repayment. Sometimes someone does something just because they can.”
“I’ve been neglecting you.” Rune looked at Malfoy now with his big eyes, a little worry at the corner of them.
Then the door was opening, and Harry was turning around, and a man was stepping out of Draco’s bedroom.
Draco just stared at him for a moment.  “Why, of course you do,” he said, after a moment.  “You’ll find I’m a very talented wizard.
Harry shrugged.  “He’d probably handle it better than I could.  And anyway, he’d get to go to school with you.”
“Er,” Harry said, holding up his belt and trying not to trip over the robe thing as he slowly backed away from the glass.  “Where’s this?”
“But I believe that people can change.” Harry’s hands had come down out of his hair, and he felt like he was pleading with them, somehow, for something. “I believe he has changed. It’s the—it’s the best thing I believe. The most important thing. It’s why I—it’s why I teach at the Academy; it’s why I wanted to be an Auror; it’s why—it’s why dying to win the war was worth it, because I thought that we could change. I thought we could be different than we are.”
“You said . . .”  Flicking off the light in the cupboard, Draco turned to face him, and Harry was suddenly struck by how tired he looked.  The spaces under his eyes looked smudged, as if with shadows or bruises.  “You said I was the only one you could trust.”
“No,” Harry said, confused.  Pulling away, he tried to look into Draco’s eyes, but Draco’s head was down.  Harry tried stroking those short hairs—just a little, barely a touch.  Draco’s nape was still so delicate.  “They would never,” Harry said, because Draco seemed to need some kind of reassurance.  “They loved—they love you, Draco.  They love you so much; they’d never disown you.”
Heloise had a perch in the lab where she sometimes slept, but she wasn’t there, so Harry went upstairs to the kitchen to check the window.  Draco said that was usually the window he left open for her, just in case she wanted in when he wasn’t home.  Sometimes she tapped on Draco’s bedroom window, but Draco said he didn’t let her sleep with him.  He said she made a mess.
“I can see how that would be very frustrating.”  That low resonance in Malfoy’s voice made it surprisingly soothing, when he was not being snide.
Harry took another bite of toast, speaking with his mouth full.  “I’ve a sleeping bag.  Are you sure about the bacon?”  Though Harry reached out for it, he hesitated.
“You never know, Potter,” Malfoy said lightly. “The vial might explode. The memory might prove me a serial killer.”
“Why do you think I wanted to be an Auror?” Teddy demanded, and for the first time since he was seven years old, he sounded angry.
“What are you saying?” Harry asked.  “I thought I was meant to be thirty-one, and that’s how I ended up here.”
“I’ve a subject to bring up,” said Penelope to the instructors of the Auror Academy seated around the table. “Draco Malfoy.”
“It’s not all right!” Harry’s voice was louder than he had expected it to be. “They should have been punished! Lucius should have had to go to Azkaban!”
“Because I’m a kid? Oh, well.”  Draco frowned.  “I assume my political enemies would use it as a way to embarrass me.”
Turning over the bowl, Malfoy pressed the berry mixture through one of the magic sieves.  Clear liquid dripped out the other end, and Malfoy caught a few drops of it in a clean phial.  “Here,” Malfoy said, handing Harry the phial.  “There’s a shop in Knockturn Alley called Mortensen’s Menagerie.  They sell exotic animal parts and might be able to figure out where these came from.”
“If I pass,” Malfoy agreed. “If I don’t, I’ll be at those centres every day, doing what I can. And if I do pass,” he went on, “I’ll still be doing what I can, whenever I can. Just as long as I’m doing something to help.”
Harry moved closer.  Malfoy just looked so bewildered, and Harry didn’t know what to do.  If Malfoy had been Hermione, Harry would have hugged him.  But Malfoy wasn’t Hermione, and Harry didn’t hug other people unless they were Molly Weasley—he certainly didn’t hug Draco Malfoy.  That would be just ridiculous.  Harry said at last, voice cracking, “I was trying to say you could get around the tracking charms, but you never would, and that that proved you could be trusted.”
“You were right as well.  I should not have kept them.”  Turning from her, Draco brought the mugs to Harry, handing him one.
The vote of no confidence, however, failed, fifteen to fourteen—exactly the same margin by which Fudge had won, the Councillors voting along the same lines they had then.
Vinicius rolled his eyes. “Don’t tell me Draco Malfoy is a Metamorphmagus too. Is it a Black family gene?”
not married, am I?”  He hadn’t seen any evidence in the house that anyone else lived there, but it had never occurred to him that he might—
“That makes sense,” Andromeda said, politely sipping her tea.  “If Harry suspected the Ministry being involved, the best help would come from someone entirely outside of it.  Harry,” she went on, putting down her tea and standing up.  “You must be tired.  I’ll make up Teddy’s bed for you.”
“Have you thought about,” Hermione began, but then couldn’t seem to finish.  “I mean, when you say, ‘messed up’—”
“Potter,” Malfoy said, then turned away to look at the wall. “Potter,” he said, starting again. “If I was any good at excising dark sigils, do you think I’d still have the Dark Mark on my arm?”
Malfoy didn’t seem to care.  One of his hands slid up along Harry’s jaw, his temple, until Malfoy’s thumb was brushing Harry’s scar.  The other snaked inside of Harry’s robe, finding Harry’s waist, pulling him closer, pulling him up against Draco’s lean hard body.  Harry went; he’d go anywhere.  He’d do anything Malfoy wanted.
For the next few hours, Harry and Draco flew about trying to catch the Snitch.  Draco demonstrated various flying techniques every time the Snitch came near him.
“You have that, ‘I may leave society and become a hermit for a thousand years’ look on your face,” Ron said, grabbing Harry’s elbow, pulling him away.
Malfoy whined again, but Harry had already cast the blood extraction spell, pulling out Voldemort’s blood and the old, dead blood of a younger Malfoy. Then there was only the scar. “Oh,” Malfoy said, jerking as Harry began to heal it.
Draco was stumbling over his words, and yet for once he seemed to be speaking on the subject in a way that wasn’t oblique or completely bigoted, which was a first.  “I realized Oliver was attractive after I left Hogwarts.”
Diggory, weren’t you?  Weren’t you?  I bet that’s why you’re so sad he died; I bet that’s why you—my father—my dad,” Draco said, but he didn’t finish.  “Oh Merlin.”  Covering his mouth with a hand, Draco sobbed again, a horrible wracking sound.
“You just need to keep moving the tails under the knife to ensure they’re the right length, and make sure your fingers don’t get caught.”
“Wow,” said Teddy, in his smooth, flat way. “Not what I heard.” He had on a little smile, which was surprising. Teddy sometimes teased people, but Harry had only ever seen him do it with affection.
“I always thought that maybe if I could shag a bloke—just one; it didn’t matter whom—then maybe I could get it out of my system.”  Draco was speaking slowly, his words very measured.  “I wouldn’t want to do it any longer, and I could be what my parents wanted.  I think we both know it doesn’t work that way.”
Harry watched Malfoy help Nyala and the other younger ones in Combat Two; he watched the way Malfoy moved, with liquid grace, flicking off spells arrogantly and almost absently as he easily bested every sparring partner. Worst of all was watching Malfoy in Sorcery (Ritual, Soul, and Spiritual Magic), where Malfoy studied hard and paid strict attention and was a model student in almost every way, except for his marks, which—whenever Malfoy was asked to do any practical demonstration—were dismal.
Harry shook his head. “If there was a way to prolong your life just by taking the life energy of plants—or even other people—we would know by now. What Voldemort did was significantly more complicated.”
The mind-control was a potion, Harry concluded.  The other cases he’d connected to Ludville, Vance, Savage, and the illegal potions ring had to do with potions; they involved some fairly powerful brews.  Ever since former Death Eaters had been sentenced to magical restrictions, potions had arisen as an alternative to magic.
“Well,” Draco said, taking the cards in the pile and adding them to his stack.  “He never poisoned anybody or gave them any cursed jewellery.  He never tried to get good people fired or tried to control anyone’s mind.  He never let maniacs into our school.  I’d say Ron Weasley was first rate.”  He shuffled the cards.
“Sure?” said Travers. “We got Clearwater and Savage to come, and we’re all of Level One. It’s Orientation all over.”
Colour drained from Draco’s face.  His eyes were very bright, like shining silver in a porcelain mask.
Harry looked at Malfoy’s tense little shoulders, the way he’d stopped playing with the things on the table, but Harry could not for the life of him remember a single thing about Theodore Nott.
Harry spent a few days of the week before term started with Vinicius, who was an attentive lover and an excellent cook, but seemed rather too interested in Harry’s Auror exploits and heroic deeds as a seventeen-year-old for Harry’s comfort. As with most of his other partners, Harry was reluctant to spend the night, as he was more prone to nightmares whilst sleeping beside another person, and he didn’t exactly feel comfortable at the prospect of explaining them to yet another person who didn’t understand them.
“Maybe you should have been more careful.”  The comment sounded like Malfoy should be annoyed, but his voice was concerned.  Taking the powder, he asked, “What does it do?”
Malfoy stayed where he was. After a long moment, he washed his face, drying it with a fluffy towel by the sink. Then he put his head down.
“Sure,” the guy says, glancing at the shot.  “He was here yesterday,” and then continued off down the hall.
“Yes, but darling what are we going to do?!” Pansy brought the conversation back around to the subject that they had been beating their heads against for what felt like forever.  “We can’t use magic, we have no credentials in the Muggle world.  Any job that we qualify for would involve manual labor and my nails would never recover from such abuse!”
Harry and Ron exchanged a look.  A lot of the peculiarities they had been discussing on the train suddenly made sense.
Rookwood’s face lost its calm facade, it’s pretense of friendliness.  He was cold and hard as he sneered back, “Drop him.”
The bus shimmered into view as the Disillusionment spell faded.  It was tipped over on it’s side just around a blind curve but perfectly visible from the air.  Surrounding it were half a dozen wizards in black cloaks.  They all turned at the sound of the motorbike and one of them moved toward Harry as he dove at them.
Harry’s face remained calm and unafraid as he shook his head slow and clear.  No, he was saying.  Don’t do it.
Harry smiled.  The beautiful blond had lowered his voice to match Harry’s.  The two of them were practically whispering to each other.  The topic of conversation was nothing but an excuse.  Harry hesitated.  On the one hand, he did not want to push his luck and yet he felt an aching pull to see what he could get away with.  With a deep slow breath, he tilted his head until he was practically whispering in one pale, shapely ear.  He let his voice rumble through his chest.  “What do you think it means, the fact that they are not together?”
Ron scratched the back of his head and squinted at him before sighing and giving in.  “We're supposed to be doing things the Muggle way ... but, as long as no one finds out, I’m not sure what harm it will do.”
Their voices started to get closer and Harry backed slowly away from the corner.  He was desperate to hear but really did not want to get caught.
“Not much up that far north but rocks.  Trust you to send us off into the freezing north.” Neville laughed.  “What are you going to do?”
Rather than putting him off, the whole incident had made Harry more convinced than ever that he wanted a relationship with Draco Malfoy.
“No.  That’s a long shot at best.  I don’t want you to get in any deeper than you already are with your boss.”  Harry said, shaking his head.
“It all seemed rather buddy buddy to me,” Robards sneered.  “The little worm was standing right here next to Dolohov and Rookwood, safe as can be.   He’s in with them, just like his no good father, and there is nothing you can say to me to convince me otherwise.”
“Maybe we should just give this up as a bad job.  I mean, you were testing too, right?  There was no magic during the whole concert.  Seriously, this whole thing is a waste of time.”
“It’s not your fault the Wizengamot sentenced you to a year working with the Muggles any more than it is mine or Draco’s,” Pansy said kindly.
He thought of Ron and Hermione and remembered when the three of them had been a single unit facing down the world.  There were other moments when Harry had felt like an outsider, looking in on their relationship.
Draco could not help himself, he laughed.  It made so much sense he wasn’t sure why he hadn’t seen it before.  The concept that talent and passion and hard work had earned them a place in the hearts of their fans was as foreign to the Death Eaters as it was to Robards.  It was so much easier for them to believe such success came from a spell, as impossible as that spell was.
“Fine work like yours should be rewarded,” Shacklebolt pushed forward with his politician grin.  “How would you feel about a promotion?”
Harry was laying out flat on the marble of the grand entrance of the tour bus, his head cushioned in Draco’s lap.  While he appreciated the elegance of the floor, it wasn’t very comfortable, no matter how tempted he was by his pillow.  Ron and the band members were seated around him on the floor.  Harry groaned again as he tried to sit up and Ron and Draco reached out to help.  “That wasn’t Rookwood.”
Harry stared at Ron dumbfounded as the rest of the pieces slotted together.  “You want to set me up with Draco Malfoy!”
“Are you saying that you saw this man right here talking to the bus driver for ‘Sly’ yesterday.”  Harry clarified.
“If I had the slightest hope that would do any good, I would take you up on your offer but I see no value in it.  Why don’t you do this instead… if you have a couple of days, help out Charlie.  There was a sighting of Antonin Dolohov, the other escaped Death Eater, up that way a week or so ago, not far from where he is investigating some missing kids.  They were heading north the last I heard on a hot lead, not that there is much further north you can go from there.  I think they were heading to St. Kilda.  That was yesterday.  Who knows, you might find Rookwood as well.”
“What training did we receive that would possibly be of value in the Muggle world?” Pansy said, ignoring Draco.  That at least had not changed.  Pansy always had a knack for ignoring what she did not like.
Nothing.  No active spells.  No magical residue from potions.  The only thing affecting these people was the energy of being here.  Satisfied, Harry stuffed his wand back in his sleeve and gave himself over to just enjoying himself.  He smiled and laughed at the people around him who smiled happily back, as they all bounced and danced together.  It was marvelous.
“Great.”  Blaise’ dry voice came from the doorway.  The tall piano player was leaning against the frame, watching the show.  “Just what we need, Harry Potter even further in our business.”
Did Draco hear that warm deep voice?  Or perhaps he just knew it so well he did not need to hear it.  His body shook against the trauma of what was being asked of him.  It was so out of character, so far from what he had ever done before.  To lie and threaten and bluff through was his way was his birthright, his heritage as much as Malfoy Manor.
“Yeah.”  Harry went on eating the curry Draco had made for lunch.  Draco never let him choose lunch anymore either, but everything Draco made was always the best thing Harry had ever tasted. Harry was beginning to suspect Draco didn’t much like Harry’s choices of meals, which was just fine with Harry.  He’d never had so many nice foods before, or else he might’ve known to ask for things other than fish and chips.
“Dream Dram.”  Due to Malfoy’s behaviour earlier, Harry really would have liked to conceal the fact that he was impressed, but he was finding that difficult. “How can you tell?”
“A warehouse?  That doesn’t seem very exciting.”  Sounding disappointed, Draco crossed his arms.  “Is he a dark wizard?  A powerful one?”
“No,” Harry said slowly. “Malfoy, you were never my adversary. You were . . . an irritant. Someone who got in my way. You fight an adversary, Malfoy. I never even needed to fight you. You just—cried in the the girls’ toilet and ran away when you were frightened.”
“Leather.  Um.”  Harry swallowed, glancing over at Andromeda, who had sat down again to read the paper.  “Trousers?”
“Fancy meeting you here.” Vinicius flashed a dazzling smile, and he was still the best-looking bloke in the room besides Rune. And Ron.
“She’s good,” said Harry.  Malfoy just looked so comfortable and lazy, as though making normal conversation and visiting each other were something that they did all the time.  “How’s . . . your mum?”
Draco looked down at them, Harry’s thick dark cock against Draco’s. Draco’s eyes were huge, his hand moving in their direction almost as though unconsciously, as though helplessly drawn to them.
It had been watching him, but seeing that Harry was awake, the fox turned and trotted through the wall.
“Yes.”  Then Draco’s hand touched his shoulder, but it was in a nice way, and Draco was looking down at him with his silver eyes and pale throat and nice mouth.  “We all have skewed perspectives.  I should not have dismissed yours, especially as it—it means a great deal to me.”
Harry paused, about to point out he still had to get the cream, but then he realized Malfoy meant for him to use magic.  Malfoy also wanted him to be quiet, so Harry drew his wand and concentrated on the cream.  It shot across the room into his hand, and Harry set about applying it to his face.  Meanwhile Malfoy took a cauldron off the fire, decanted it into a phial, cast a cooling spell, and drank it down.
“You’re so hot,” Harry said immediately. “Sometimes all I have to do is think of you and my dick gets hard.”
Harry wanted to say in a nasty voice, but he didn’t say that either.  Draco hadn’t taken him anywhere bad last time, even if it hadn’t exactly been fun.  Maybe this time Draco would take him to the red-headed man’s house—but no.  Draco said they had to be a secret.  Like a failed science experiment.  Harry reached for another scone.
“You wanted to please me. Didn’t you?” Harry rubbed his soft cock against Draco’s hip. “Please me again, Draco. Let me undo it. Let me watch you come.”
Harry had often thought that Aunt Petunia and Uncle Dursley weren’t nice to him, but he’d thought it was because they weren’t nice people, and he wasn’t their son.  He’d thought that his mum and dad must have cared; he’d hoped they’d cared very much.  It had never occurred to him that anyone else
“This first one may move your hair a bit,” Draco said, pointing his wand.  “I see you did comb it, so I’ll try not to muss it.”
“And your dumb deer got lost, by the way,” Harry said, feeling awkward and perhaps a little sullen.  He still
Draco had told him, but Harry couldn’t bear to tell younger Draco the truth.  He couldn’t bear it; Harry’s heart would break in half, and he didn’t know what would happen to Draco’s.  Certainly, he wouldn’t be sitting here with Harry in front of the fire.  Draco wouldn’t want to be near Harry at all, and Harry didn’t know whether adult-Draco would want to after this either.
, Harry wanted to say, but it so obviously wasn’t true.  Draco had managed to work himself into quite a state since Harry had left, which Harry supposed he should have predicted, only he didn’t see how he could have.  Draco had always seemed worked up in school, but Harry had thought that it was just because Draco hated him, and not because Draco had too many strong emotions he had difficulty controlling.  “I’m not in danger from any Muggles,” Harry said, experimentally petting Draco’s hair.
“What—pardon?”  They were at the top of the stairs, now, and Malfoy turned to face him.  “We didn’t ever win it?”
“Of course, it’s the end of the world,” a woman screamed. “They could kill us all with the flick of a stick!”
“They’re trying to make Revealers look like dangerous radicals,” Teddy went on, as though just perusing the crowd for his friend at a concert. “Expelliarmus.”
Harry also hadn’t said, because he didn’t even want to think of that yet. Though maybe he could tell Kavika. He could probably tell Kavika. She would probably have something very reasonable to say.
“There’s a spot . . .”  Malfoy bit his lip, then touched behind his own ear, indicating a spot on his skin.  “Here.”
“Why do we always need to argue?” Povey asked. “Why can’t we just handle this like any other issue of discipline?”
Harry took a quick, sharp breath. Before now, he hadn’t really been able to put the pieces together, why Teddy wanted to be an Auror, when he had always seemed so much more interested in things like music or philosophy, when he’d never seemed to like action or a fast pace. As Harry watched, Teddy’s Harry-features melted away into his own, his sharp narrow face and hair the colour of Lupin’s, eyes like Tonks. “He loves you,” was the only answer Harry could think of.
“Andromeda says you’ve been visiting,” Harry said, mostly to change the subject, but partly also because he found it an object of curiosity.
Much more carefully, Andromeda took a polite bite of dumpling, then wiped her mouth with a corner of her napkin.  She was watching him, Harry knew, but he pretended to be focused on his food.  The fawn was standing not far away, watching him also.  “Would you like to talk?” Andromeda said at last.
Malfoy’s cheeks were still flushed from before, but Harry saw that the softer tone had had its effect.
Harry played a card, and Draco played another on top.  Harry played one on top of that, and it was a snap, so he kept going.  Draco was silent as Harry played the next three cards.  “Your turn, now,” Harry said, when the series was done.
Sitting back in her chair, Kavika said, “I’ve told you these sessions weren’t about me.” She still sounded sad. “What I think doesn’t matter.”
Harry knew that Draco could see his scar.  When Petunia had shaved his head, she’d left his fringe to cover it up because it was so horrible.  Harry had always found his scar rather cool.
Harry understood what Draco had been hesitant about.  He could get the permission of a ten-year-old Harry, but he didn’t have the permission of the thirty-one-year-old Harry.  Maybe Draco thought old-him would be mad, and once again Harry thought old-him sounded a bit like an arse.  “But we’re being illegal anyway, right?” Harry said.  “Because we’re breaking in.”
Savage and Vance were involved; Robards likely was too.  Best to leave the Aurors out of it—even Ron; Harry didn’t want to put Ron in the middle of everything.  Besides, Hermione had always been the one who figured everything out.  Harry didn’t expect her to solve the case, but he needed another pair of eyes.  Going to her one night when Harry knew Ron was at a stake-out, Harry began to explain the situation.
He could go to Ron and Hermione, obviously. They were getting precious little sleep these days, with Hermione in the Council, and Ron dealing with the pressure on the Force. He shouldn’t bother them—though he was allowed to bother them. They would want him to bother them. They had made that clear; they had given him the locket. Harry touched it. He didn’t want to bother them.
Draco looked good—scorchingly good, in a way that made Harry feel guilty for being here at all—but when Harry kept looking at him he saw the thinness of Draco’s thighs, the boniness of Draco’s shoulders.  When Draco turned back around to face Harry, Harry saw the way Draco’s collar bones jutted out and thought of how Draco had looked at Slug and Jiggers—a sick colour, his hair lacking shine, his whole face hollowed out.  Harry put the shopping on the table.  “You should eat something,” he said, even though he remembered the way Draco had lashed out that time he’d told Draco he should eat more.
Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair. “You know how they are.” When Kavika began spelling the coffee into the cups, he added, “And how I usually tell them they’re not there to ask questions about my personal life, and how I make it clear I won’t engage.”
“I’m sorry.” Turning around to look at his desk, Harry found a quill. Pulling a fresh sheet of parchment toward him, he began to jot down notes. “And you tried scarring potions? Burn treatment potions?”
“Draco,” Harry said again.  He tried to peel Draco off of him, but again Draco must have misinterpreted the movement, because he pressed his face harder against Harry’s chest.  Remembering how Draco had held him after he thought Harry had been in danger, Harry put his arms around Draco.  It hadn’t really occurred to him at the time that Draco had done that because he had been terrified, and touching Harry had made him feel better.  “Muggles aren’t going to drop bombs on you,” Harry said.
“Yes.”  Mister Malfoy’s lips quirked again.  “And if I kept you in a cupboard—tell me, Potter.  Where would you put your bed?”
“Draco was there,” Harry said.  “He took care of me.  I told him there wasn’t anyone else I could trust, since I knew you two were under some kind of influence, and Shacklebolt as well, which is why he didn’t go to you for help.”
They both spun into the warehouse, the coin dropping to the floor.  Malfoy stepped away, looking up at the glass cabinets.  “Where are we?”
Draco had been poking around papers the desk, but now he looked up, his mouth falling open a bit in surprise.  “Only . . .”  He began, then swallowed.  “That’s what we called each other in school.  I . . .”  Draco turned back to the desk.  “I was a bit of a prat, and I called everyone by surnames.  Even my friends.  It was—I thought it was cool.”
Almost as though in a trance, Malfoy slowly moved into the stance. The point was relaxation but not to forget everything you’d ever been taught, which was what Malfoy was apparently doing.
me,” Harry said, pushing up with all his might, but he couldn’t move; Malfoy’s weight was on top of him; Malfoy was crushing him. “Get
“Love being taken from both ends, don’t you?” Gripping his hair, Draco forced Harry down farther on his cock. “Love being fucked. I bet I could get a whole group of men in here, and you would love it, wouldn’t you? You’d love bouncing on their big thick cocks. Big, strong wizard like you, taking it from every man in the room.”
“Don’t look so disappointed,” Draco said, barely even looking up from his magic microscope.  “It was never going to be permanent.”
This was so very inappropriate that Harry felt strangely at ease, the way he hadn’t with all his other therapists besides Kavika. Telling them about the dream was easier as a result, even the part where dream-Malfoy pointed out Harry’s arousal, even the part where dream-Malfoy had been sort of humping him with his clothes on. Then came the part when dream-Malfoy turned into a past-Malfoy, the bully Malfoy that was not current Malfoy, but who was still alive in Harry’s mind.
“Er.”  Harry knew that wasn’t true, but he also knew you weren’t supposed to correct adults.  “If you say so.”
“Dark objects can be very powerful.  ‘Dark’ sounds like it’s a bad thing, but it’s not.  It’s just a different type of magic—you know, like night is different than day.”
“It takes its toll. Here you are, Harry.” Turning from the side table, Kavika brought two cups, handing one to Harry and keeping on for herself. Seating herself opposite Harry, she was silent for a moment, allowing them both to take a sip.
Ginny had told him once, when they’d been arguing about it.  She’d said that she thought he might be bisexual, and he had been so convinced he wasn’t.
Magbricks attached magically, so you could build impossible things with them, and sometimes Kavika gave them to him to occupy his hands. “Coffee works better,” Harry said, taking the blocks.
Malfoy had once again brought Astoria Greengrass to the Auror holiday party as his date. While the gossip of the holiday party had been dominated by Harry and Vinicius or Fairchild and Non-Magical Mark or the rumours that pure-bloods were actively sabotaging Shacklebolt’s coalition using Imperius—Gardenia Greengrass had attempted to remind everyone what the Auror institution was truly about. She had announced her younger daughter’s impending nuptials to the Malfoy scion almost as if in response to the other things, as if to say that despite blood corruption—or homosexual relations between wizards—pure-blood lines would prevail.
After Malfoy snapped at him to use magic—Harry could use magic after all, and Malfoy still couldn’t—they fell into an almost peaceful rhythm, chopping, mashing, sifting, and mixing.
“Yes,” Malfoy said.  “Good on you. You’ve defended your Death Eater scum, and now that you’ve warned me off; you’re free to—”
“Malfoy has a problem with his ex-boyfriend dancing with people?” said Ron, asking the relevant questions.
Eventually Draco came upstairs and asked Harry what he wanted for lunch.  He seemed to be startled when Harry asked for the chicken salad again.  It was good salad, even though Andromeda’s chicken and dumplings were better.  Harry would never tell anybody.  He’d defend Draco’s magic cooking to his grave.
Trying to catch his breath, Harry turned to look in the mirror. His own cheeks were red. He looked like someone who wanted someone. Was that what Malfoy had seen? And had it caused him to flee because he didn’t want it, or because he wanted it as well.
“Don’t.”  Malfoy pulled away, his steps puffing up dust.  Drawing his hawthorn wand from his sleeve, he pointed at the broken bottle on the ground.   “
Malfoy leaned in, his lips by Harry’s ear. “Have I taught you, then, to want things for yourself? Just little things. Like this.” He nipped the shell of Harry’s ear, and Harry shuddered.
“Um, Hermione,” said Ron.  “I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but Harry’s excellent with kids.  He lets Hugo climb all over him, and he actually listens to Rose, instead of saying, ‘uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.’”
But Malfoy came out to the front, still looking ghastly.  His skin was pulled so tight over his face his head looked like a skull, and Harry realized what had made his shoulders look so sharp—Malfoy was thin.  Rather desperately thin, and he’d always been wiry.  It wasn’t a good look on him.  Neither were the hollows under his eyes, which reminded Harry of sixth year.  His mouth was a sullen little line, but that wasn’t any different to how he used to look.
Standing in the hall was a man Harry had never seen before.  He was holding a sheaf of papers, pointing a wand at Draco.  “
, Draco had said.  Draco had neglected to mention he was one as well.  Harry thought of something then.  “If you don’t get me that number, I might have to do something funny.  Really funny.  To Dudley.”
If Harry hadn’t been losing his mind, he might have thought about how much Draco hated Harry after first year and decided how he would handle it.  Harry hadn’t forgot it, but he hadn’t let himself think about it.  Maybe a part of him had even hoped it wouldn’t happen, but it had to.  It had to, if he was going to get his Draco back.  “Yes,” Harry said.
“Well, but I’m already dating you.” Winking, Vinicius left them in search of Malfoy, who had ended his dance with Nyala.
Draco read for a while.  Harry had got so used to Draco’s light voice droning on that he felt himself nodding off, when finally Draco said, “Now you read it.  I’ll keep your place with my finger and help you when you don’t know the words.”
“Excellent. Good.” Sibanyoni took a sip of Coke. “Horizons. Stretched.” He made a frittering motion with his hand that was maybe a horizon stretching. “If Vinicius was an animal, what animal would he be?”
“Well,” Harry said, feeling a little uncomfortable about it.  “I guess so.  I mean.  Doesn’t everyone?”
flannel,” Mister Malfoy said, coming over to sit on the ground by Harry.  Harry tried to flinch away, but Mister Malfoy said, “Shh,” then took off Harry’s glasses.  “You’ve made yourself sick.  You ate too much.
“Rumours of our romance were wildly exaggerated, of course,” Malfoy went on carelessly. “She’s hardly my type. I prefer green eyes.”
Duggins nodded. “Many people are worried about the affiliations of loved ones just now, what side of Reveal they support.”
The Invisibility Cloak slipped off as Harry crashed to the floor at Malfoy’s feet, still curled into his hiding position.
someone tied to me. Not in that way. I want someone who is their own person, who doesn’t need me to—to save them, or exist for them, or be their everything. I want someone who exists for themself, and who loves me . . . just for being me.”
I stand quietly until my instincts to track Robards down and remove his intestines have retreated enough for me to think.
“Hi,” Harry breathed, excited and happy, feeling like if he didn’t grip the table hard he would float away.
Arthur walked out with them, his chest almost bursting with pride as he watched them go.  Just before they got to the edge of the clearing where they could Apparate he called out “You might check with Charlie about the camera.  He wasn’t using Muggle equipment, but a while back he was taking pictures of the Dragon preserve for the Daily Prophet.  He might be able to help.”
It is Robards.  Gawain Robards, head of the Aurors.  I push myself back into the darkness.  Despite the painful magical illness that saps Robards mind and strength, he is a formidable adversary, especially here.  Young Malfoy also recognizes the threat and turns, refusing to leave his back unprotected.  That Malfoy sees Robards as a threat pleases me.
“What Harry?  Is it about the photography?  If you want to keep the camera I’m sure Dad wouldn’t mind.  We don’t have to stick around for that.”
Draco had other friends, others stood beside him even now as he had once hoped Harry Potter would.  Saving them, and himself, was a task that fell to him alone.
In the dark shadows I wait.  A dark hood protects my skin both from the rain and recognition.  My pale face, pockmarked and scarred from years of hard living, is easily recognizable, especially here, in the capital seat of my enemies.  Here, where I should have ruled at my master’s side; instead I hide like a rat in the shadows, fearful for my own life.  The frustrated rage rises up inside of me as I fight back the knowledge of what might have been.  I have years of controlling my emotions but even my hard won control is badly tested against the anger that burns hot and bright like Fiendfyre in my soul.  That fire cannot be seen.  Patience is hard won but will be rewarded.  I remind myself why I am here.  Not for vengeance.  Not yet.
“Did she apologize?”  Harry asked, trying to find something that he could use to help put them back together.
“Wait, no!”  Harry objected loudly to being called the very thing he had worked his whole life to stand against.  “That’s not what is going on at all!”
Ron patted Harry’s shoulder as he passed.  They had all arrived in Cambridge the night before.  Harry and Draco had found a spot to Apparate to since the band absolutely refused to let them anywhere near the tour bus, and found a B & B nearby to use as their home base for the day.  The techs were already working on setting up for the performance and with nothing else really going on, Ron went to check out what they were doing.
After a moment of uncomfortable silence, Greg could not help pointing out what he thought was obvious.  “What about music?”
“You will learn what it is to work in the dirt and filth of the Muggle world, you’re not qualified for anything else.” Robards pronounces as though delivering a verdict from Merlin himself.
“I mean, wouldn’t you?” Ron asked, turning around to face him.  “That’s why I joined the Aurors, to make a difference.  Instead, I’m here hanging out with band groupies and my dragon taming brother is off hunting down missing kids.  Life’s just not fair.”
The words were lost to Harry, but the anger and passion was not. He snapped shot after shot of the amazing energy that was Pansy and then turned his camera to the crowd as he realized how many of them knew every word, mouthing, singing, screaming along with her as she drove them into an even greater frenzy of energy and passion.
“It’s so frustrating.”  Harry said, dragging his hands through his hair.  “What was he doing here?  This obviously isn’t a base of operations or someone would have seen something.  Even forget-me-not charms miss occasionally.
“Wait.  I thought it was a boy egg.  Norbert, right?” Ron said.  “Wooh, keep that thing away from me, he’s already bitten me once.”
“The last time you tried setting me up it was because your mother could not accept mine and Ginny’s break up.  She blackmailed …”
“MIRIAM!” He interrupted.  It was enough to startle her into silence.  “Pansy was the one who was attacked.”  Draco explained in a more reasonable tone.  “She is resting.  Harry and Ron scared the bludger off and then made sure she got the treatment she needed at St. Mungos.  She was very lucky they were there.”
The soft meeting of lips was like slipping into a warm bath.  Draco could feel the angry tension in his muscles ease.  The smooth slide of skin on skin was chaste and tentative and amazing.  He knew he was forever spoiled for anyone else.  The thought that he would only ever be able to kiss Harry Potter going forward did not bother him at all.
Harry stood there, breathing hard in anger and upset, his broad shoulders rising and falling, the muscles in his arms flexing as his hands clenched and unclenched.
The clack of wheels over the tracks wove memories thick in the air as the Hogwarts Express sped them over the long miles towards the old castle once again.
It was a while before Pansy was aware anyone else was there.  Draco kneeling next to her in the dirt and muck, a quiet witness to her pain.  She sniffed as she tentatively poked her head out of the haven of Ron’s arms.  Draco handed her a handkerchief.
Harry slipped from his chair and stood as well, the solid black bar still between them, a barrier but also a comfort.  “If you are talking about school then let it go.  I have.”
This story would race through the wizarding world like fiendfyre.  Harry would not have wished this on the ghost but had enough experience with Peeves over the years not to allow himself a bit of joy in Fred and George’s revenge.  Even more, he was glad he was here to see the moment for himself.
As though the sun itself recognizes the pure-blood heir, it breaks through the clouds and shines down on his white-blond hair like a beacon in the dark.  He is tall and proud, head up, shoulders back.  They have not broken him.
Still ... the dream of having a powerful friend like Harry Potter to help him, to support him, to rescue him; it was a vision that was as intense now as it had been at eleven years old.
“Oh,” Harry said and felt his smile grow wider as he settled back against the cushions.  “Yeah, this is good.  I’m remembering.  Riding into Hogwarts was my favorite part of the year.”
Sliding down the Hortail’s leg, Draco sat back and took his first full breath since Harry had fallen.  “Never better,” he called back and the smile on his face was too full of relief to be anything but happy.
Rookwood tisked drawing his attention back.  “Now Draco, do not be like that.  We’re all friends here.  Old brothers in the cause, even if you were too young to take the mark.  But do not be concerned.  We are here to fix all that and allow you to finally join us properly.”  The wizard waved his boney hand at the gathered assembly.
It was not a surprise and yet Draco could not help whipping his head around in horror.  One more moment they spent looking at each other across a distance that was about to become eternal.  Harry still did not look afraid.  Then he was gone.
“You rap?” Greg asked, in stunned disbelief.  Draco was staring at Pansy with a delighted smile on his face.
“You can’t tell the gender by the egg Ron,” Charlie teased and Ron pulled a face at him.  “We figured out Norbert was really Norberta not long after she got here.  Girls are much more violent and territorial you know.”
Harry was decidedly grumpy about this.  He was self aware enough to know that he liked to be the center of attention of those who mattered to him.  Draco Malfoy obviously now fit into that category.  This revelation solidified the conviction that he had made a mistake in telling Ron he did not want to date Draco.  Ron would not let him change his mind without a heavy dose of good natured harassment, but it would be worth it.  He needed his friend to help him figure out the best way to approach Malfoy, as he was not doing well on his own.
‘A few weeks back I visited the Hogsmeade branch of WWW to pick up a shipment of …” Ron paused, trying to remember but Harry just waved him on.  “Right, doesn’t matter.  Anyway, while I was there I noticed this statue of a cat.”
Draco lounged further back, more as an attempt to get further away from yet another madman in his face than any at posturing.  It struck him as a bit odd he was more comfortable with the dragon than the Head Auror.
“You’re a good friend.”  Pansy said with a smile and Ron beamed back at her.  “If you’re both good, maybe you’ll both get an invitation to check it out.”
The name meant nothing to Harry, but he could guess that it would mean something to someone who knew Bourbon.  “Do I want to know how much this is a bottle?”
My apologies for the extremely long delay since my last post.  I would complain about life and things blowing up and while all of that is true, what it really boils down to is that this chapter scared the life out of me.  It's long, complex, with lots of emotions I was trying to do justice to... yeah, I was scared.  But I figured out a way to get through it, and with some help from my lovely beta Erin_Riwen it is finished.
Draco Malfoy was magnificent, strong and defiant in the face of his enemies.  As much as it pleased me to see him take on Robards, this is not the frame of mind I need him to be in when I invite him to join the newly reformed Death Eaters.  He needs to be broken, struggling and weak.  All that life has thrown at him has not yet broken young Malfoy.  As much as I would like claim Draco Malfoy for the cause, the timing is not right.
“He tossed your unconscious body at the door and walked away.” Blaise said.  He was sitting with his head down resting on his knees, as though if he could not see anything maybe the problem would go away.  Harry knew the feeling.
Draco settled more firmly against Harry and watched Ron look after Pansy with a heartbroken expression.  Somehow Ron was missing what everyone was saying.  Draco wasn’t though.  Somewhere inside of him there was a small boy who was finally happy.
There was a tense silence before Malfoy added in a much quieter tone, “... maybe it shouldn’t have been.”
“That’s ridiculous, Robards, and you know it.  I’ve thrown off the imperius curse.  Nothing so faint that it can’t even be detected is going to have any impact on me at all. You’re wasting Ron’s time and Auror resources that could be put to better use, like tracking down whoever attacked Ms. Parkinson.”
“That too,” Pansy smiled at them.  “I’m the middle child in a big family.  We do what we must to get attention.  My parents hated the guitar ... and the rapping.”
“Blaise.” That was Malfoy’s voice, deep and resonating, washing over the crowd with almost as much power as the chords of the music. People laughed again at the obvious scolding tone in that one word. The lights came up just enough for everyone to see Malfoy, tall and majestic, the microphone in hand as he peered back over his shoulder towards the keyboard and his bandmate.
Nothing was as it should be; why should he expect his own life to be any different? Fudge was Minister for Magic. Teddy was possibly a terrorist. The Board of Regents for Auror Academy was corrupt, and in the end Harry worked for a corrupt institution, and Reveal was going to fail, and non-magicals were going to die; people he loved were going to get hurt, and why hadn’t he done something? Why wasn’t he doing more? Why didn’t he—
still interested in Rune? How did it make Malfoy feel, knowing that the bloke who had dumped him was dancing with the bloke Harry had dumped? But that shouldn’t matter—it shouldn’t matter that Vinicius was Harry’s ex. Everyone dated everyone’s ex; this world was incestuous; there were twelve people in it—where was Malfoy? Harry turned to find him.
Travers gave a shrug that seemed calculated to look self-deprecating, but only served to make him seem more arrogant. “Like you said. I got their attention.”
“And he’s your godson?  How did you get a godson?”  Draco seemed far more interested in this than in learning how to be polite to people.
Harry looked at the red and gold silk.  “It’s great,” he said, because it really was, even though Draco’s seemed less cartoonish and far more elegant.
Harry didn’t want to be immoral.  He knew that was bad, even though he still was a little unclear on what all was meant by it.  “Then what do I have to—”  Cutting himself off, Harry ogled.  “You?  Do I get to be you?”
Harry left Draco on the sofa, but Harry still couldn’t bear to go to sleep.  He didn’t know whether Draco had slept, whether falling unconscious counted.  Instead, Harry worked on the chair some more, trying to restore the charred bits.  Next, he worked on the table, then the books.  Draco had cast the fire spells across the middle of the row of bookshelves, but the flames hadn’t had a lot of time, so only the books on those shelves were singed.  They seemed mostly salvageable, but Harry had no clue how to go about restoring the burned parts.  Maybe Draco would know.
“Is it true you defeated the Dark Lord with a disarming spell?” one of the trainees asked, inevitably.
“And Rune would say we should talk about wizarding world medicine,” Malfoy was saying. “Do you think Lenore would agree? Because lots of non-magical people are going to think that all the sudden we can cure non-magical diseases . . . Potter?”
“Some pure-blood dads really do not want to blame their own children for their zany Revealer ideas,” Nyala said, plucking a glass of punch off a tray floating by them. “Not my pure-blood dad, though. Zabinis are equal opportunity.”
Draco looked back at Harry, then at the wand, then at Harry.  Draco bit his lip.  “I could tell,” he said finally, his voice soft.
Many voices spoke at once, and Harry covered the Whisper Wire so that another voice wouldn’t be added to Malfoy’s ears. “What are we waiting for?” he demanded.
Exiting the bathroom, they went on up to the top storey, opening the next door into a bedroom that appeared to be used regularly.  Realizing that this must be the room old-him used, Harry wandered around a bit.  A bed stood against the far wall with a small bedside table with a drawer in it.  A large chest of drawers stood against the wall perpendicular, next to a comfortable-looking chair.  The bed was messy, and clothes were strewn about, along with trainers, some dishes, and more papers.  Harry went to go check out the cupboard while Draco began to investigate the room.
react if—well, they didn’t.  Obviously.  As I’m sure you know.  Father told her—well, he got her to leave off that kind of thing, I’m sure.”
The door thumped thrice, someone knocking. It wasn’t fair to shut them out when all they wanted was to understand. It wasn’t fair to expect them to understand he needed to be alone. It wasn’t fair to be unkind.
“We like London.” Luna’s voice was always a little slow, a little soft. “We like how bright and busy it is. We wanted to be a part of it. We don’t like how dirty it is. How unkind. We also wanted not to be a part of it.”
Harry had forgiven Malfoy for letting Death Eaters into Hogwarts.  He’d forgiven everything, not because Malfoy’s behaviour had been in any way acceptable, but because Malfoy was a different person now.  He had grown up; they had both grown up.  The past would always be between them, but it didn’t have to rule their lives.
Harry glanced back at Draco, who was just standing there in back, his eyes gone very large.  When Harry met Draco’s eyes, however, Draco gave a slight shake of his head.  Harry knew Draco well enough now to read it.  Draco had been working for Mrs. Mulpepper for a few weeks, now, and didn’t think she could be involved.  Alby might have even said something like that just to take revenge on competition.
“What about Malfoy?” Teddy asked, lifting another canapé off the same tray Harry had taken his from as he walked to join Harry and Vinicius against the wall.
Apparently, Savage kept all kinds of things in there, because when Harry opened the drawer a Niffler jumped out, causing Harry to drop the bottle of indicator solution.  Harry Accio’ed the Niffler, Reparo’ed the bottle, cast an extraction spell on the puddle on Savage’s desk, and was about to decant the solution back into the bottle when he saw the cerulean stain.
Looking about the room, Harry didn’t see any evidence—mud tracks, or signs that a different student had been there before. A few cloaks hung on hooks, but that was not out of the ordinary; Harry had left his cloak overnight plenty of times when he had been at Academy. “I’ll find the person responsible,” Harry said. “Tell me if you see anything strange.”
While Malfoy bent over the microscope, Harry wandered around, looking at Malfoy’s things.  He had a Pensieve, brains in jars, cases of beetles, bottles of eyes, something that looked like Wheatabix, neatly dissected in a pan.
“Mum said she needed help degnoming,” Ron said, suddenly standing. His chair teetered back with a clatter, and without even looking, Hermione steadied it. Ron cast a worried glance at Harry.
In that moment, Harry’s Patronus found Malfoy, the image coming as flash of hazy silver in Harry’s mind—a little like Legilimens, though kinder and softer, like a piece of himself come back to him. When Harry concentrated, the vision became a little less blurry, and Harry could see that Malfoy was standing amidst a crowd outside the Pallas Arch.
“Oh.”  Harry flipped through the papers, reading the tops of them to try to determine whether they had anything useful.  Most of them seemed to be about spells people should not have done, for one reason or another—you weren’t supposed to do spells in front of Muggles, he gathered, and you weren’t supposed to do magic when you were young.  Harry wondered whether that was what the front of that book Draco had given him had been on about, when it mentioned a decree about underage magic.  None of the papers seemed to be about murders or fires or bombs, which were the sort of things police had to deal with.
“The Board doesn’t want me made an Auror,” Malfoy said, his voice that practiced, careless tone. “I might as well turn to a life of petty crime.”
rather desperately in the loo. Malfoy with Teddy, Malfoy after Nyala’s Boggart, Malfoy fighting Fenrir’s followers in Diagon Ally, hugging Teddy violently in the aftermath.
“Trainees don’t know what they’re doing yet.” Harry rubbed the back of his hand. “I mean, they don’t know what it’s like, what the job is like, and they have instructors, but instructors don’t always . . .” Looking down, Harry saw what he was doing, then thought about his words. Smiling at himself, a little unhappily, Harry looked up again. “Are you going to say this is about my time as a student at Hogwarts?”
“There was a man named Voldemort,” said Andromeda, setting down her cards and picking up her tea.  “An evil, arrogant individual who felt that Muggles and people who associated with them were inferior.  He amassed power and a group of followers and began killing Muggle people.”
when she loved you and was concerned about you and wanted reassurances that you were okay, but Harry wasn’t okay. He just wasn’t okay.
The result was much narrower mattresses and blankets, but Draco transfigured a fluffy towel so that they could both have pillows, and then he let Harry get into the top bunk.
Harry glanced up from lacing the boots.  “You think I won’t want to go home because you think I’m thirty-one?” he asked, wondering whether he wore boots like this when he was thirty-one.  He must be a cool grown-up, one with a cool job that paid rather well.
magazine, “I think we can all agree hate-speech is bad, but don’t you think two weeks’ suspension is sufficient for some graffiti?”
Hermione had said that the UK had voted to leave the European Union, which meant that the EU wouldn’t need to be as involved in Reveal, except that the whole departure situation seemed almost as complicated as the Deal.
“No.  Don’t . . .” Draco took a swift breath.  “Don’t apologize to me.”  Abruptly turning around, Draco strode over to him, pointing his wand as he went to drag the empty chair at the table so that it was beside Harry.  It made a horrible dragging noise on the tile floor, and then Draco was sitting beside him, closer than you were supposed to sit at a table.  “It’s your in-between birthday,” Draco said.  “Pretend it’s like a holiday.  You can do
The salve didn’t feel cold to Harry, but Draco’s wounds were hot, the skin around the red and inflamed.  Taking his fingers away, Harry cast a warming charm on the salve, then touched Draco again.  He mostly stayed still while Harry applied the salve, but Draco still jumped when Harry’s fingers touched his abdomen.  Glancing up to make sure he hadn’t hurt Draco, Harry met Draco’s eyes.  “It
The corner of Hermione’s mouth flicked up, like Harry had pressed a switch. “Therapy was terrible, wasn’t it.”
Malfoy’s eyes flashed at the dig, but he didn’t say anything else bratty.  Instead he said, “Do you remember that time you asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up?”
“Yeah, well.” Sighing, Harry walked around to the desk where his schedule book was. “I don’t usually fail students without at least helping them try to achieve success.”
Kavika had come out of retirement because Harry had wanted to die, and the scar on his forehead wouldn’t let him. There were four mind healers in the whole UK, and Kavika was the only one he trusted to tell that Horcruxes existed at all.
Harry took it, and they followed Andromeda through the sitting room and down a hall.  “Where is Draco going to sleep?” Harry asked as they walked through the wood-panelled corridor.  The house was nice but seemed sort of old.  “Are there bunk beds?”
“Right,” Harry agreed, “but even if the Deal does go through, there are a bunch of details to sort. They’ve spent so long arguing about the terms of the Deal that the actual logistics to make it happen haven’t really even been looked at yet.”
Malfoy’s eyes went large, and Harry looked around to see what had made him look so surprised.  There wasn’t anything there, though, and Harry guessed the Wood-Eye Lye must have a bad aftertaste.  “Why did you start growing a beard?” Malfoy said suddenly.
“So then, do you think they might know something?” Harry said.  “Maybe we could call them to ask them about the potion brewer.”  The bar at the bottom didn’t have an obvious way to slide it, but he tried doing it with his thumb.  The picture changed to a different picture with a bunch of little pictures on it.
Malfoy would, Harry thought suddenly, sipping his coffee. Harry wasn’t in the game of guessing people’s boggarts—you could never know what someone feared on the inside, no matter what was on the outside—but if Malfoy’s boggart was Voldemort, it would at least look accurate. Harry wondered how it would feel, to see Voldemort again, the real one. Sort of the real one. Downing more coffee for fuel, Harry rolled up his scrolls, and headed off to class.
The flat was decorated for the occasion, but Harry could tell this was mostly Nyala’s work. She loved that gauzy fabric—tulle, she told him later, laughing at him—and had strewn it up in elaborate ways Andromeda would never appreciate or understand, because Andromeda was very practical and didn’t understand the point of tulle. “Tulle always has a point,” Teddy told Andromeda seriously, after she had arrived and been suitably surprised. “If the point of tulle isn’t tulle, it can be a cheesecloth. Or mesh.”
“It would never bother me,” Ron said. “Who you wanted. After I was a prat about Gin. It bothered me that George would joke about it—as though people get to decide who they want.”
“Have it, Potter. Not everything is symbolic, you know. It doesn’t have to mean anything.” Malfoy pushed the cup against Harry’s hand, and not quite willingly, Harry took it. “I do so enjoy our chats,” Malfoy said, then headed out toward the corridor.
Harry wanted to put his head over the side to hear better, but instead he lay very still, hardly breathing so he would be sure to hear the secret.
“Right,” Harry agreed, “but I haven’t seen the magic you could do when you were eleven in twenty years.”
After another half-hour or so of flying around, they found themselves within arms’ length of the Snitch.  Harry’s arms were shorter, but he was faster.  He thought he could get it if he just—
Malfoy snapped his fingers in front of Harry’s face.  “I’m sorry,” Malfoy said, not sounding sorry at all.  “Am I boring you?”
If Harry had moved his hand a little bit, he would have been able to feel the small of Malfoy’s back, that sweet space that held the curve that swelled into Malfoy’s arse, the powerhouse of muscle for Malfoy’s long legs. Harry could press into that space of back, pulling Malfoy against him, his whole body, lithe and strong and bending to his will, but Malfoy could take control easily, if he wanted. Malfoy could do anything he wanted; his mind, once made up, produced a will of iron. Malfoy did what he decided to do, and oh God, it really was exactly like sparring.
Harry could feel that his eyes were large, probably large enough to almost fit his too-big glasses.  He couldn’t stop staring at the owl.  It had magnificent eyebrows.  And it had been inside the building!  And it was sitting on the man’s shoulder, making the man look even more regal than before.  Harry looked back into the doorway from which the owl had flown.  “That was—where did it come from?”
“Admit it, Harry.” Malfoy’s hair felt into his eyes, catching the light just so, his cheeks flushed, his eyes bright with mirth and warmth. “This was exactly what you needed.”
“I think fucking messes are beautiful,” Harry said, wrapping his arm around Draco again and resisting the urge to wipe his face.  Harry was pretty sure Draco’s saliva was in his beard, which was kind of gross, but he didn’t want Draco to see him wipe it away.  “Did the round for this year just start?”
A popping sound filled the air, Aurors beginning to fill the street. “He’s going to get away,” Teddy said.
Harry waved his wand again, and Alby began vomiting slugs.  Turning back to Draco, Harry made sure he was ready with the sample.  “Do you have what you need?”
“Well,” Harry said, twisting the crystals. “They’re different every time, so . . . I guess.” He twisted them back, then pulled them apart again. “There was one with Teddy. He’s graduated Academy, so it wasn’t even . . . but in the dream, he was still at Academy. And I just . . . forgot he was there. I mean, everyone forgot he was there. He was still going to classes, but no one would see him, or pay him any attention, and then I found out he’d been waiting in my office for me, but I didn’t know at first. And then I was just . . . too busy; I left him there.”
He went to the parlour, throwing himself into a chair in front of the fire. Took out his wand, starting playing the games Kavika had taught him, little spells to make light catch each other. This distracted him for a little while, but by the time the clock said, “Four-forty-two,” he was growing bored. Still too early to go to work. Too early to see Molly?
Harry sort of wished he could put Vance under Veritaserum as well, only he didn’t have proper cause to suspect a fellow Auror when the witness who had testified against him had already been proven to be a liar.  Just in case, however, Harry went to ask Savage for some of that indicator solution the next day.  When she wasn’t at her desk, he opened the drawer where he’d seen she’d kept it and reached for the bottle.
Harry looked in the cabinet, which had chicken, flour, sugar, bread, and an assortment of vegetables in it.  “That takes hours to cook,” he said, because even if he could transform the chicken, the rest wouldn’t work out.
Teddy shouldn’t be the one to reassure Harry; Harry was the adult. “It would be okay,” Harry said, “if you weren’t. If you ever aren’t,” he felt the need to add.
“But I shouldn’t feel guilty,” Harry said. “You said it yourself; he was a bully; he let Death Eaters into Hogwarts. He was a—he’s just a—he’s a
“Um,” Harry said, his voice faint, rather too mesmerized by the sight of Draco’s slowly hardening cock. “Ask for it?”
“Hogwarts happened.” Kavika’s voice was nothing like a stereotype, neither soft nor particularly kind. Rough with age or maybe cigarettes, there was a croaking deepness that felt real instead of clinical or sweet. “Have you talked to any of your friends about Draco joining the Academy?”
Malfoy extracted himself further, stepping neatly away. He angled his face toward the ground, showing Harry the fine line of his neck. “It’s too much,” he whispered.
Harry swiveled on the cock inside him, making a circle with his arse so the cock could stir his insides. “Fuck me,” he begged. “Fuck me, fuck me hard. I need it.”
.  Malfoy had ridiculed her so cruelly, but it had never occurred to Harry that Malfoy hadn’t done it because he was intrinsically a prick.  He’d done it because his parents had told him that was the way the world worked—but Harry had already known that.  Lucius and Narcissa had also told Draco that Muggleborns would ruin their whole culture, and for the first time, Harry understood why Draco had believed them.  Growing up with only Crabbe and Goyle for friends—even Parkinson—Draco must have felt like an alien, someone so completely different.
Harry’s hands twitched. “I’m not telling you this—I’m not expecting anything in return,” he ended up saying. “I’m not—I’m just—you said I wasn’t being fair.” Harry locked his hands together in front of him. “I thought you deserved to know.”
Harry took a calming breath, then another. Robards was always like this. Harry wasn’t sure why, after four years, he had thought it would be any different, especially after what he’d said when he’d held the press conference about Travers’s punishment. Harry had told them that the Force had refused to intervene. Furthermore, Robards knew that harassing a witness was certain to agitate Harry—even if that witness was Malfoy. “You know what the memory contains,” Harry said finally. “We’ve been doing nothing but message about it for the past two hours.”
“This scar,” Draco said, bringing Harry’s hand up.  Draco looked down at the raised bumps for a moment, then back up at Harry.  “She gave it to you?”
“I think I would like that, Harry,” Draco said softly.  At last, he looked up.  “I’d like that very much.”
Harry’s heart dropped back from his throat into his chest, then continued a free fall into his stomach. Slowly, he turned around. “Vinicius.”
That didn’t mean a former Death Eater was necessarily behind all of this.  Several different brewers were involved, according to the case files, but Harry still hadn’t been able to figure out what connected them, beyond the fact that the source for key ingredients was in the region of the Gulf of Mexico.  This suggested that the common element was a supplier, not a brewer.
Harry had been going for more bacon, but now he froze again.  “Fly?” he asked, his mouth full of scone.
Malfoy pulled out his wand in a fluid movement, turning with it to cast—Notice Me Nots, Harry realized. He felt so grateful that he didn’t know how to tell Malfoy that no matter how many shrouding spells you cast, most people still noticed a whole tree, especially a famous tree that everyone knew was there.
Harry’s heart was still squeezing—except now, for some reason, it was also lifting in his chest.  Oh God.  There was no reason he should feel
“Am I . . .”  Draco stared at the fire.  Seeming to muster up courage, he turned to Harry.  “Do you think I’m a swot?”
Malfoy’s eyes had been looking through him, a bit; now they snapped back, boring holes through Harry’s.
Draco looked surprised.  “Of course,” he said.  “Is there anything in particular you’d like to see?”
Harry frowned. “I didn’t mean I couldn’t do it without him. I was fine before he—” Harry didn’t quite know how to label what Malfoy had done, during last year’s orientation. “I was fine. The orientation was like . . . it was like it was before.”
“Sorry.” Ron actually did look guilty, although he had the sort of face that always made him look forgivable when he was an arse. “We found someone to do our homework for us.”
“Scourgify!” the person shouted frantically, holding the front of their shirt. Their viscera were spilling out. “Scourgify! Scourgify! It wasn’t me! It wasn’t me!”
“You were made for me,” Draco said breathlessly, kissing him. “You’re mine. You’re mine. You belong to me. You’re perfect for me, Harry; you were meant for me. You’re meant for me.” Each of these things was said between kisses—not Draco’s teasing kisses; these were kisses dropped all over Harry’s face. They seemed to unlike Draco, messy and unplanned, as though Draco couldn’t help himself, and Harry couldn’t stand it.
“I’m going to talk to venue crew one more time.  Someone tipped of Rookwood that we were here.  Someone’s got to know something.”
“Yeah, but not when the bus was going to arrive, or that the band members had a habit of sneaking out of  the bus.  My gut says it was too coincidental to be an accident.”
Twenty minutes later Harry felt the tingle of magic brush against his skin and he knew he was close.
The poor boy was in tears by the time Harry finished what he needed to say.  “But you were a Gryffindor,” he sniffed.  “They said you would…”  The young man trailed off.
“I’m going to be in the Outer Hebrides, the archipelago north of Scotland for a bit.  If you make it that far north, let me know.”
At least he thought it was a stranger.  When the music finally paused Draco turned to face his partner and saw the last face on earth he would have ever expected.
Pansy and Draco both chuckled.  “Come on, you two,” Draco said, breaking the stasis and heading off towards the lot where the bus was parked.  “I’ll let you judge for yourself whether Pansy needs more room than what she has on the tour bus.”
Harry’s eyes flickered away so fast he almost missed it, tracking high over Draco’s left shoulder.  Then Harry smiled, a soft gentle thing that hurt to look at.  “Trust me.”
I am here collecting.  Voldemorts followers have been scattered to the wind.  Many ended up in Azkaban, myself included, but I had been the means of escape from that place once before.  This time, I brought only one of my fellow inmates with me; a small force compared to my last jailbreak.  Others have joined.  Some willing, others less so.  I am here to continue collecting resources.  One jewel in particular shines like forbidden fruit.
“I’m sorry.”  Harry said softly.  It was not the first time Ron had assumed him dead.  Harry needed to be more careful to make sure it was the last.  “I think we’re getting too old for this hero crap.”
With Ron gone, Harry found himself wanting to get caught up in the excitement of the crowd. The beat was good, the adrenaline high and everyone seemed loud and happy. Harry almost felt bad sneaking out his wand and doing a quick diagnostic of the people around him.
Ron elected to skip the tour in favor of making sure Pansy got settled alright.  Draco and Harry knew when they weren’t wanted and left the two of them to it.
Draco found himself slammed back into the side of the bus, Dolohov’s deranged smile and foul breath filling his world.  “Augustus doesn’t like being compared to the head Auror,” Dolohov explained, bouncing Draco’s head off the metal at his back for emphasis.  “Makes him angry.”
“I’ve got it too.  Middle child syndrome.  And boy, you’re getting it from all sides.  Middle child at home, middle child between Harry and Hermione, it’s hard to figure out how to stand out when it feels like everyone else has a leg up.”
“They had that incident last year with the Quidditch end of season fireworks where we almost lost George.  Remember that?”
“McGonagall is going to kill them one of these days.”  Hogwarts tended to be right in the middle of the blast radius of whatever Fred and George were up to and the new Headmistress had more than one new grey hair to show for it.  “Well, George anyway.”  The two friends shared a grin.  “Is he still dating the new flying instructor?”  Harry asked and then winced at how he had unintentionally brought the conversation back around to dating.
They pushed forward until they were right at center stage, fairly close up in the mosh pit of pressed bodies bouncing to the music of the band opening for ‘Sly’.
“He can’t even get his story straight,” Harry ranted, and Draco didn’t bother pretending like he hadn’t heard.  “Am I enspelled or blind, was the attack staged or a lover’s quarrel.  He doesn’t seem to care about the truth at all, as long as he’s right and you’re wrong.”
“Harry likes!!!” Pansy nearly shouted ... Ron shushed her, putting his finger against her lips.  She continued in a rather loud whisper.  “Harry likes Draco?  You’re having me on.”
“Yes.  I believe that McGonagall has banned him from half the castle, not that it does much good.  Peeve’s pranks continue.  Fred and George have been rather quiet lately, a nice change, I can assure you.  But if they are starting up again … I should warn our Headmistress.”
“Waiting tables at some Muggle restaurant?  Terrific.”  Even Greg could not miss the sarcasm in Draco’s voice.
“Don’t give me that.” Robards shot back, his voice still echoing down the hall.  “They’re Slytherins.  Pampered little rich snobs.  They can’t possibly be good.”
He shot Harry a hopeful look and Draco felt his stomach drop.  He lifted his eyes to Harry’s face and found him looking back.  Draco was not sure what Harry saw on his face, but the hesitation that had been there melted away as Harry tenderly slipped a strand of white gold hair behind Draco’s ear.  “I’m sorry Kingsley, but I can’t.”
“There is usually someone down here in the ministry refectory every night.  You are always welcome to join us.”
How could anyone resist wanting something so beautiful? The thought broke Harry out of his trance and he pulled his eyes away from the stage. Once more he pulled out his wand and checked the crowd. No magic. No magical ingredients in the air. The spell the ‘Sly’ band was casting over the crowd was completely natural, a combination of charisma and talent.
That was it.  That was the last straw.  “I’m going to my room,” Draco announced.  “Please come get me when the world has once again returned to normal.”  He dropped the picture he was holding back onto the table and swept out.
Was that a dragon?  The thought stopped Draco in his tracks.  The sound of fighting had him spinning back around to the clearing.  Wizards were pouring out of the woods surrounding them, many with Auror’s robes, even more it seemed with the bright red hair that could only be grown by Weasley’s.  The scared teenagers were putting up very little resistance.
“The younger ones in a big family always struggle to find ways to stand out,” Ron said, looking now at Charlie.
“You're a fine one to talk of consequences, you with your fine house and your rich friends.  But you’ll feel them now, yes you will.  When you are slaving away in the Muggle world, you will know what it feels like, brought low, just like your kind deserve.”
Harry had never had the opportunity to root for Malfoy, always on the other side of a bitter confrontation, whether Quidditch or House Points or … well everything.  But, things were different here.  The Slytherin was Harry’s classmate and fellow wizard and Malfoy his and his success was something that would reflect on him too.  Harry was truly hoping Robards was wrong, that the Slytherins were not cheating the system, but had found a way to excel despite everything that had been stacked against them.
Harry watched Ron as he stared blankly at the carpet, worried and helpless and aching for his friend.
“Harry!” Draco screamed over the sound of Dolohov’s laughter.  He darted forward, to do what, he would never be sure.  Perhaps he thought to end things with Harry, to follow him off the cliff.  He would never know for sure.  Even as he charged forward something shot past him, over the cliff and after Harry.
Robards started sputtering and Arthur laid a friendly hand on his shoulder even as he continued to defend Draco.  “We all heard him tell them no.  That was very clear.  Whatever they were trying to get him to do, and I’m sure the inquiry will provide those answers, he was very clearly resisting.”
“We’ve got keyboard, guitars, vocals….” Blaise mused.  “We need a drummer and we might just pull this off.”
They were talking about him!  Harry almost crowed with delight and pulled his head back before they saw him.  He really should leave, but the thought doesn’t stop him from settling into a comfortable position as he listened.
In that moment, they were children.  This was one of the joys of a friendship that had developed over years.  Something would happen and they would be back in time, sharing memories without words and feeling content in each other's company.
“We thought you were dead,” Pansy added, curling up tighter against Ron’s side.  Ron pulled her in close.  The look on his face told Harry in no uncertain terms what that moment had cost his friend.
But Pansy was well past listening.  She stormed up to Harry and stuck her finger in his face.  “We might not be able to stop you from being here, but you can be sure we’re not going to help you.  Think you’re so smart, Robards little pets, digging around like grubs in the mud, I’m sure you’ll find something to ‘prove’ we’re cheating.  Well, if you are going to make up some prejudicial bullshit to drag us to Azkaban over, that’s on you … “ she took a deep breath “... that’s on you.”  Then she pushed past him and stormed out.
“Now Draco, surely you do not mean for us to believe you and your little group of Slytherin’s caught the attention of so many muggles on talent alone do you?”  Rookwood asked.
It took a while to settle again.  Ron finally picked up the thread of their conversation.  “I hear the friendship between the three of them has cooled off since then and I have to say I’m grateful.
Draco shook his head and wiped off the tears of mirth and panic from his face.  “Of course.  Of course you would think it is a spell.  You and Robards.”
Malfoy ignored the protest, looking to Zabini and Goyle as he nodded towards the door.  “Stay away from us Potter,” Draco said flatly and then the three men followed Pansy out.
Ron settled back against his own seat cushions, taking up so much more room than he had as a child.  His hair was the same, a bright red that Harry could pick out even amongst Ron’s siblings.  So much else had changed since the two of them had last sat on this train.
Harry nodded, “I thought at the time that was a crazy sentence.  I mean, what good would it do?  It’s not like they are going to go out there and start getting warm fuzzies for Muggles by making them slave away at whatever crap job they can find.  It was more like they were trying to humiliate them rather than inspire real change.”
This horror of a future awoke in Ron a burning desire to go home, to sit at the Burrow with his Mum yelling in the kitchen with people charging through and laughing, friends and family and all of them with a warm smile, a practical joke and a sincere joy to see him.  The feeling was overwhelming.
“Nope,” Ron said.  “Didn’t seem to think it was a big deal.  Said I was too needy, that maybe a break is just what we needed to ‘get our priorities straightened out’.”  His laugh was without humor.  “I don’t think she meant her.”
Not Malfoy Senior.  I left him rotting in prison.  The old man’s will was broken.  That he could refuse us, his fellow purebloods, still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.  No, it is the son I am interested in.
“It’s not like we were dumb enough to tell him what we were doing,” Fred puffed out his chest proudly.
“Every drop of Minotaur blood comes complete with a magical labyrinth.  Solve the labyrinth and you are free.  Mess up and your blood is added to that of the original Minotaur.”
Draco pushed all of it away as he danced, allowing himself to get lost in the music.  Here he was another anonymous face in the crowd, here he could vent his pain and fear and sorrow in the dance, here he had nothing to hide, he could just be.  His movements were wild and out of control, a perfect imitation of all that was going on inside of him.
Harry found himself responding and a desire greater than he had ever experienced before rode him. He wanted to catch Malfoy’s wild hair in his fingers and suck the sweat from his neck. It took all of his self control to stop himself from leaping up on that stage and dragging Malfoy’s body against his own. All Harry’s loss and pain seemed to shift as he watched that beautiful body move. He wanted with a strength and passion that shook him to the core. Of all the crazy, adrenaline filled, death defying things Harry had done in his life, nothing felt quite like standing in that packed club, caught up in the magic of wanting Draco Malfoy.
“Are you sure?  The ‘Sly’ tour schedule isn’t that hard to come by.  Ms. Lockhard has been posting it to every social media outlet on the planet.”
Sighing, Harry pulled himself from the couch to head up to bed.  The future and everyone in it would still be there in the morning and he needed his sleep if he was going to keep up with Ron.  Still, as he trudged up the stairs, Harry admitted to himself that he was looking forward to his encounter with Malfoy.
“He thinks they’re casting spells on their audience?” Harry asked.  “That’s crazy!  Mass effect enchantments don’t work like that.  Every first year in Hogwarts knows you can't enchant your way into being loved.  There isn’t a single one of us who doesn’t try to figure out how to cast a spell to become the most popular kid in school.  That came up in the first week in charms class and Flitwick lectured us on it for the whole class.  Think about it.  How do you cast a spell so that people you’ve never met want to come see you?  I mean I guess you could cast a spell on the audience when they are there but as soon as they get out of range everyone would be right back to normal.  Trust me, if there was a spell to permanently make everyone love you every politician in the history of politics would have used it.”
“Fine. It’s not good enough for you? I’ll choose another.” Turning away, Malfoy took the stance again. “There,” he said, after a few moments. “I’ve got one.”
“I hadn’t noticed.” Harry found his hand moving to his other hand, rubbing the scar on the back of his fist. “I was looking for Teddy. That’s not true. I was looking for Vinicius. And Malfoy. But I was looking for Teddy, before.”
New Year’s Eve at the Burrow passed like many other New Years’ Eves, the children and some of the adults setting off the firecrackers in the yard, the rest of the family talking politics on magically warmed couches and chairs as they watched the show. This year’s conversation, as it had the past four years, revolved around the Deal, but in the coming year there was also the election to consider. Though the vote itself would take place before Reveal was scheduled to occur, the new Minister of Magic would not officially begin until after, which meant that as things stood, Fudge was in complete control of the Deal.
Outside, Harry loosened his collar, letting in the night air. Opening his senses as well, he took in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Insects made their quiet rustling sounds, and non-mag car horns honked in the distance. The pub, which should have been a dull roar behind him, was almost dead silent.
The woman’s hand slid off her hip, her lips parting.  Then she seemed to notice Harry watching her and frowned.  “Well, what case is it?” she said, turning back to Draco.  “If it's the Ludville case, don’t worry about that.  Mysteries has it under control.  I’m sure it will all get cleared up—”
Sometimes Ron and Hermione went on like this.  In fact, usually Ron and Hermione went on like this, after Rose and Hugo were in bed and just the three of them were alone together.  Harry never minded, but he used to wonder why they asked him to visit when he had so little to contribute, and they always had each other.  It had taken him a while to realize that they didn’t need him to help them or save them or bring up interesting things for them to do; he didn’t need to say things or do things so that they could remember why they liked him.  Having Harry around made Ron and Hermione happy, for whatever reason.  He could see it in their faces when he was around them.
The laughter quickly died, and Harry turned to Fuentes. “We’re going to do an armbar next. Are you ready, Fuentes?”
The first time Harry saw Malfoy after the trials was two weeks after Harry became an Auror, and it happened because the Auror Department didn’t have a lab with people who did potions research.  Instead it had a little room called Records and Filing, where an old man called Kirkley Zidwidley would look up the origin of an old spell if you asked nicely (and loudly).
“No one’s ever been like you before,” Malfoy said. “I just wanted you to know. No one will be again.” Opening the door, he walked out of it, snapping his sleeves down with a spell as he went.
“Right, of course,” Draco said quickly.  But then he looked into the fire and didn’t say anything at all.
Whoop-whoops were pretty nasty, and if that were true, they would have an odd number for at least a few weeks. Harry did what he would have done for any of his other trainees. “All right, Malfoy,” he said, turning back to him. “You’re with me.”
“I didn’t mean,” Mister Malfoy began, but stopped when Harry hesitated again.  “Go on,” Mister Malfoy said.  “You can have more later if you want some.”
Azkaban.  He’ll escape, and I’ll—I’ll show you.  I’ll—I’ll help the Dark Lord, and then he’ll—he’ll help
“But we’re friends now,” Harry said hopefully, wishing Draco would look over at him.  He didn’t know why.  He just thought it would be nice, because Draco’s eyes were very nice, and Harry liked for Draco to be pleased.  He hoped Draco was pleased about being friends, but Draco was busy opening another drawer.
“Right.” Malfoy stood up, turning away. “Almost forgot about that.” He wandered away a step or two, and Harry let him, until Malfoy turned back suddenly. “Not even the bitter part? Can we at least say we were—acrimonious acquaintances?”
Still feeling wary, Harry felt pretty sure Draco was trying to placate him for some reason or other.  Still, the idea of getting to pick what to eat was definitely attractive.  “Can we have fish and chips?” Harry piped up, after thinking about it a moment.
“Yes,” Harry said, squirming on another thrust. “Yes, yes, I want to, I want to come on your cock. Yeah.” He moved his arse in a circle again, trying to get that cock to hit new places.
Harry entered the cloakroom to find Malfoy facing the empty pegs on the stone wall, where trainees hung their cloaks and books, above which were placards with the trainees’ names. Today, above the placards, scrawled in a thick, messy brown substance that had been wet once, but now was dry and flaking, read the words
“I don’t know why you said it.  I’m just trying to—I just—you said it, so I’m . . . .  I’ll fix it.  I can fix it, Harry.  You said you trusted me, that I was . . . .  I don’t need anyone’s help.”  The bags under Draco’s eyes made him look unhappy—rather desperately unhappy, and his mouth turned down.
An hour or so later, guests began to leave, streaming outside to Disapparate, as the flat didn’t have a hearth. A few of the parents with their Squib kindergarteners were first, and Harry cast a Notice-Me-Not on himself, staying by the kerb so he didn’t talk to anyone. Eventually, Harry went back inside. His cloak was in there, and he didn’t want to be last to leave, alone with Malfoy.
“Yeah. Right. Because I haven’t dealt with my trauma, or whatever?” Harry pushed himself out of the chair. “So what, if I just deal with it, it would go away?”
“Malfoy,” Harry said softly. “I’m not your enemy. I never was. I was trying to help you. I was always trying to help you. I still am.”
Harry’s thumb brushed over the ink. Last term, figuring out how to remove Malfoy’s Dark Mark had occupied his time. He needed something else like that.
Harry resisted the urge to throw something.  “Yes, her, or were there other suspects parading around here saying that Auror Vance is a part of an illegal potions ring and has been making money off it for years?”
Malfoy’s eyes doubled in size and he looked strangely hungry, shoulders tight and hunched but still looking up at Harry, as if waiting for any drop that Harry could give.
They came to him, but Harry didn’t want to put them on. He didn’t want to see. He wanted . . . Malfoy had given him something, for sleep paralysis. The potion was preventative; it had already happened. It had already happened. Harry wanted a cold shower. He wanted—
Frowning, Harry put his head over the side, almost wanting to put his glasses on so he could see Draco better.
“He didn’t really.” Hermione seemed amused she had got him to believe this, but Harry couldn’t help it. He was a bit discombobulated. “I cursed someone.”
“You don’t understand,” Draco said.  “You’re perfect.  Everything about you is perfect, and right, and just, and good, and I’m—”
“No.” Harry held the cup on his knee, which was one of the—many—things he liked about coffee; it gave him something to do with his hands. “Or maybe the coffee is, but Malfoy doesn’t—he doesn’t do those things. Anymore. He . . .” Harry looked down at his coffee.
Draco stared at him.  “Potter,” he said, then seemed like he had to start again.  “Potter, do you really think my fetish for green eyes began when a potion turned me into an eleven-year old?  It began when I was
Harry took off his glasses. Summoned his cloth. Cleaned the glasses. “He didn’t pass the first time,” Harry said, putting them back on and Banishing the cloth.
put me through. I pity you, Draco. I forgive you. What on Earth could ever make you think that that could be the same as love?”
. Besides, Malfoy was never really focused on Quidditch; he was always . . .” The realization hit Harry like a tonne of bricks.
Surely there were people as kind and brave and thoughtful and funny as Malfoy was, people who had never been a bigot or tried to hurt anyone, and yet—Malfoy moved so gracefully. His skin was so warm. He’d beat Harry in a duel—a sparring duel, but a duel, nevertheless. Teddy loved him.
want to be an Auror. Me. I don’t want to buy it; I don’t want it to be given to me; I want to earn it. Just one thing, for myself, that I did, that he doesn’t want, that—”
“You’ll provide your services whenever I want,” Harry said, snatching the paper out of Malfoy’s elegant hand.  “You’re still a former Death Eater, Malfoy, even if you happen to be tops at potions.”
“I know I don’t have an appointment,” Harry said, before Malfoy could snap at him.  “I’ve got a bit of an emergency.”
“Even had he not let Death Eaters into Hogwarts, he was your childhood bully,” Kavika said. “He was cruel to you. And your friends.”
“Don’t ride in taxis!” Draco said, still sounding frantic.  “Don’t use mobiles!  Don’t go to your house!  Harry, you went to a place where a
Malfoy headed toward the door, and Harry turned from him to attend the wards. He was just beginning the protection spells when Malfoy’s voice stopped him.
“Now!” Robards shouted, and Aurors began to Apparate, which wasn’t how this was meant to go. Robards was meant to tell Harry, so Harry could tell Malfoy, so Malfoy could place the final marble and keep them all in view as the other Aurors Apparated.
“And Auror Potter isn’t?” said the glasses girl. “I heard he cast Crucio. In fact, I heard he cast a curse on Draco Malfoy that—”
A few hours later, Draco woke up again.  “Still here,” he murmured, looking at Harry in the chair by the firelight.
“World’s gone to shit, hasn’t it.” It wasn’t really a question, and Malfoy still was steadfastly not looking at him. “Did you ever think we would come to this? The fact that we’re even discussing Fudge as Minister of Magic makes me—well. It makes me think I know how you must have felt fifth year, when you said the Dark Lord was back, and no one would fucking take it seriously.”
“Oh, yes, we’re very good friends now,” he said, shoving in that drawer too.  “But just for your future reference, I very much wanted to be your friend then, too, only you—I went about it badly.  I was—I was rather terrible.”
“It’s been twenty years.” Hermione’s voice was grim. “I’ll bet the wizarding world is due for another.”
“There is no unbiased viewing,” Malfoy called after him. “We’re all constructs of a subjective reality!”
Harry was aching, his cock hard enough to hurt, leaking at the tip, and he was with Draco—Draco with his teasing little smiles and his insanely good looks, Draco who was so fiercely protective and so hopelessly loving, who was so smart, so clever, who hadn’t been able to stop fucking boys even though he’d tried, who’d had a Muggle boyfriend named Rohit.
“They wouldn’t have to travel to the locations,” Harry said, wanting to make Malfoy feel better. “If there was a way to have special guests, important people they need to know—”
“Harry was worried Teddy would get crap for being here,” said Ron, saving the day as usual. He turned to Teddy. “Have you got crap?”
The Timothy Tree was where Harry usually went in times like this; few people ever returned to it after their attempt to climb it.
“No,” Draco said, still holding Harry’s hair. “You’re pleasuring the toy, Harry. Make sure you’re a good little slut for it; give it what it needs. Any prick I give you, I want you to show it what a good slut you are.”
“I’m going to Obliviate him,” Harry said.  “After we get the antidote, I can get Kingsley back on our side.”
Draco sounded so concerned, to the point where he was beginning to sound like one of those nice teachers who said bad things about him.
Looking impatient, Mister Malfoy evidently decided to switch tacks.  “Even if you did switch places, do you really want to leave thirty-year-old you in the past?”
Harry thought about the books.  He didn’t remember making them move at all.  He didn’t remember anything about it.  He remembered thinking that it was 2012, and he was thirty-one, and he didn’t know who the Prime Minister was, or anything that had happened since—
Harry eagerly acquiesced, and they set about making something Draco called “indicator solutions.”  They were potions you could use to test whether someone had eaten a particular ingredient, and Draco said he’d made them before for lots of things.  He said he’d even made one to help Harry with his Auror work, but then he didn’t say anything more about it.
Harry finished the water, then put it on the bench, beside his thigh. Malfoy didn’t take it, just sitting there in silence.
“Ronald can stay.” Shacklebolt’s eyes didn’t leave Harry, who had paused. “Go on,” Shacklebolt said.
Nodding, Kavika moved along. “And what are your holiday plans? You usually enjoy the hols, don’t you?”
“Well, Harry.”  Draco glanced down at him.  “I’m trying to ID the potion that fell on you—that’s the best way to devise a cure, in most instances.  Reverse engineering.  But—Lumos.”  A light shone at the end of Draco’s wand.  They’d reached a landing with several doors, and Draco chose the one to the right.  “I’m having trouble with the ID.  It’s got to be quite complex, to de-age both your body and mind so thoroughly, and it’s looking as though it’s not temporary.  It would really help if I could talk to the brewer—but of course, that’s impossible.”
Malfoy perked up. “You don’t? That’s great. We should compare notes. What type of pornography do you prefer? I’m partial to the—”
“Malfoy!”  Abel Alby stood in the door way, a fierce frown on his scrunched-up face.  “You’re meant to be reordering that shelf!”
“I forgot about your righteous indignation.”  Draco started walking toward the lunch basket.  “I am a Slytherin, after all.”
, Harry wanted to say. Malfoy had told him he wanted to be an Auror because his father didn’t want him to.
The Death Eaters were close on his heels, now; Harry could feel them. Every time he Apparated, there they were—they had to be tracking him. He Apparated to the Pallas Arch—if he could get inside the Academy, then they couldn’t follow him. Malfoy stood beneath the Arch, as though he had been waiting.
In the end, Teddy was the one to corner Fenrir. He was joined by Ron and Susan Bones, who helped disarm the werewolf and take him into custody. Meanwhile, Malfoy had managed to capture another member of Fenrir’s team, and Ron was furious. “If they had
Heloise came back during supper, and Draco walked away from the table because he wanted to pet her.  When he didn’t come back to the kitchen, Harry cleared Draco’s dishes and cleaned up.
Harry, still impressed and sort of overwhelmed by the hole blown wide open in his case due to this new intel, accidentally blurted, “You really are tops at potions.”
“I don’t know why everyone’s so gaga about him,” Nyala added. “I never liked him much. Sorry, Harry.”
. . . not very bright. I mean, how could they not know we exist? Even with Obliviate? And when I think of Uncle—” Abruptly Harry stood, needing to put his back to her.
Malfoy finally straightened from the scattered notes he’d been scribbling when Harry had cracked in.  “Hullo—” Malfoy paused, as if startled to see him.  “Potter.”
“When we were kids,” Harry said.  “Before you became a Death Eater and all that.  What did you want to be?  I mean, you definitely didn’t want to be a shop boy in an apothecary.”
“The human’s life magic would be trapped there. A tree doesn’t lose its mind. It may take on some characteristics of the human life magic it holds, but otherwise, it—”
This tree was different than other trees—somehow more tranquil, somehow more comforting, like a friend that had also suffered, who understood, and was silent. Sitting on the bench, Harry leaned his head back on the trunk, and thought of Malfoy. Did Malfoy feel that way about the Timothy Tree? Had he made it feel that way for Harry? But no, of course he hadn’t. Harry had felt this way about this tree since his first year at Academy, the year after he had defeated Voldemort, the year he had had to rebuild his life after losing too much and too long spent in war. Perhaps Harry had made the Timothy Tree feel this way. Perhaps he had made it feel this way for Malfoy, or for any of the people who came to sit under it now.
Teddy’s brow did its incremental furrow as he glanced down at the letter. “This isn’t from a Hogwarts friend.”
“How did you meet her if witches are a secret?” yelled a young woman who seemed very angry about this. She rather looked like she might want to be a witch herself, given the number of crystals she was wearing.
“I would love to,” Draco said, and he said it so sincerely that Harry believed him.  “But I have to work on this potion.  How about you read up until lunch-time, and then you can show me what you learned?  I can help you with anything you need then.”
Harry hadn’t really thought about that. The Greengrasses had been drunk, and even though Harry hadn’t been falling in love with Vinicius, pretending that he was had been far more pleasant than thinking about anything to do with Malfoy.
Harry hadn’t meant to.  He really, really hadn’t meant to, only Draco had seemed so upset; it had made Harry feel tense, like his insides were knotting up.  A part of him had already been thinking of going to the cupboard, even though Draco would never send him there.  Draco didn’t even know about the cupboard, but it was too late.
At last Draco pulled off, giving Harry’s little kisses along his cock, nestling his nose against the root of him and kissing Harry’s balls, licking at them as they gradually became too sensitive, and then he stopped. He lay the side of his face against Harry’s groin. “Told you I was good.”
Then Draco was sliding off of him, and Harry wanted to protest, only Draco’s hands were going for the button on Harry’s jeans. Harry let him, and Draco got it undone, moving next to the zipper. And then they were both lying there, Draco’s body curved against Harry’s, and they were both just watching it—Draco’s hand slowly drawing down the zipper. Their shallow breathing made harsh sounds in the room, the only other sound that zipper. They couldn’t take their eyes off of Draco’s hand drawing it down. They watched its slow descent, the metal teeth parting, Draco’s pale hand guiding it with the metal tag.
This most-important task accomplished, Harry felt a wave of relief—quickly followed by a wave of hunger.  He hadn’t eaten since returning to his normal age—which meant Draco hadn’t eaten either.  The wave of hunger dissipated into a wave of panic, as Harry realized he was solely responsible for Draco now, and most children were horrible at feeding themselves.  No wonder Draco had lost his mind over the taxi; taking care of kids was terrible.
Draco spanked him again. “Harry.” Draco reached around Harry’s arse, pointing his wand again, drawing up Harry’s dick again, making him hotter and hotter. “Do you think I could make you come, just by spanking you? Do you want me to?”
“I don’t understand.”  Malfoy frowned, his brow furrowed in such a poignant way.  “How could I get around them?”
“No. Yeah. This.” Harry gestured at the hall. “Do you ever think about the house-elves that built this place? Do you ever think about why we built it? It was a stronghold against the Non-Magical World. It was us making our own government, instead of working with theirs.”
Tentatively, Harry put his arm around Draco’s shoulders, and Draco just—melted, going boneless against him, face pressing into Harry’s chest.
“I don’t know you, do I?”  Draco whirled around.  “I don’t even know if I’ll like you when I do meet you.  Maybe—maybe nothing you’ve told me is true!”
The man, momentarily distracted by the flying papers, only narrowly blocked Draco’s spell, shouting, “
The March day was fading, casting gold light into the courtyard in shafts the building allowed. Malfoy’s hair lit up with it, looking almost bright again, the way it used to.
A short silence followed, then Malfoy’s light voice. “Perhaps some things are better left forgotten.”
“Where is he?” Harry asked, looking around as though Teddy might materialize from the accordion wood door in the corner, which must lead to a cupboard.
Draco flinched anyway when Harry began casting, and Harry tried to make the spells even gentler, wrapping the protection spells around Draco like something warm and soft.  He wasn’t sure whether Draco had expected to be hurt for some reason—the things Draco had told him already about Lucius didn’t make it sound as though Lucius would draw his wand on his son, but you never knew with these things.  Meanwhile Draco’s eyes were luminous; he watched the movement of Harry’s wand with his lips slightly parted.
“You’re right,” Hermione agreed. “In the end, never choosing to go a different way is also a choice.”
“I talked to one at the zoo.  Then the glass disappeared, and it escaped.  That was right before I came here.”
“Excellent. Neither do I. Is Edgar Travers about? He invited me. Half-blood. He has a distinctive head. We don’t like him, but we tolerate him. Anything to avoid pushing the wizarding world to the breaking point, don’t you agree?”
When Harry pushed the button on the front of the box, the picture of the red-head man and brown-haired girl appeared again, as well as the bar that said, “Slide to unlock.”  Having already figured out this part, Harry slid his finger on the bar, and the picture changed again to a sky with some smaller picture boxes on it.  One of the smaller picture boxes was a drawing of a telephone, so Harry tried touching it, and yet another picture came up.  This one looked almost familiar, numbers laid out like they would be on a telephone.
“That’s not . . .” Draco began, then waved away the cloud.  “It’s a very difficult spell,” he said.  “You have to be feeling just right for it to come out correctly.”
“Malfoy.”  Harry didn’t know why he was so relieved, as though something frantic had be pushing him this whole time, and only now did he feel like he could breathe.  Sinking down to the ground, Harry sat next to him, broom cast to the side.
“I’ve brought—shopping.”  Harry thrust out the bags, because maybe then Draco would take them and—and go away.
“But Father said—well.”  Biting his lip, Malfoy doodled with his wand on the lab bench.  “Never bother about that.  What did you play, then?  No, wait.  Let me guess.”  Malfoy looked at Harry out of the corners of his eyes, as if he didn’t want Harry to see him looking him up and down.  “You were Keeper,” he pronounced triumphantly, after a moment.
, Harry wanted to say, but instead he said, “I wish I’d taken your hand as well.  I think . . . I think we could have taught each other things.”
Harry glanced back at Vinicius, feeling somewhat uncomfortable with this phrase. “I thought you thought he was out of your league?”
After only about seventeen minutes, the taxi came.  Opening the door in back, Harry read out to the driver the address he’d found among the papers they’d got from Cecil Vance—thirty-three Colville Road.  Though he tried to shut the door on the fawn, it got right in with him and jumped up on the seat beside him.
“Oh,” Harry said.  He hoped it meant eating cake as well, but Harry could never be sure.  Usually he didn’t get to have cake, unless it was the fruit cake Aunt Marge brought on holiday.  No one else wanted to eat that cake, so Harry always got a little—even though he didn’t want to eat it either.
, Harry wanted to say, but knew better than to say anything this time.  This room was full of shelves and boxes but looked as if it was perhaps used more often, as there was not nearly so much dust.
“Oh.” Duggins shoulders deflated. Though he seemed to be hiding it, he sounded relieved, as though he had been gearing himself up for treatment of a Fudge supporter. Had he not heard about Harry’s fifth year? But the bloke was so young. Perhaps he didn’t know Fudge had been Minister before at all—and this was unfair. Wizarding youths knew their history—a lot better than many adults, who had lived through it and so hadn’t seen a need to learn about it.
“Is that it, Kingsley?” Fudge sneered. “There was another fellow who wanted the magical world to reveal itself to Vulnerables. What was his name?” Fudge pretended to look thoughtful, then snapper his fingers. “Oh, right. His name was Grindelwald.”
“Er.” Harry’s hand touched the scar on the back of his other hand, and then he remembered that this was Ron. This was okay. “I’m not actually going to square things away,” he confessed, feeling a bit embarrassed that he had tried to cover it in the first place.
