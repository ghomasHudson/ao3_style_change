"Nope," Ron said. "I'm not spending the weekend at the infirmary. No offense mate but fuck your honor."
"Did you hear that Ruth?" Harry asked his new goat friend, with mock dismay. "That dweeb over there has the audacity to call me a nerd."
"Works for me," Ariel remarked.
"Oh, like you can't read minds." She said, handing him the light rectangular-shaped object.
"I can."
"It was fine, my Lord. Thank you for asking. Ariel sends her love."
"You're welcome," Ariel replied sweetly before she turned her attention to Draco and Narcissa who stepped ahead and gave their bows. "My Lord. Lady Ariel."
"Because I want to be able to trust you, Tom. But I know trust goes both ways." She outstretched her hand holding the vial.
“You’re going to eating good for a while Nagini,” he remarked in parseltongue with a chuckle as he whipped a finger the size of his leg into the bloody meat pile. Torrent of blood rained down on the already soaked wizard, splashing his white skin and black robes. He loved the feeling of blood raining down on him the way most people loved summer rain.
"What about tonight?"
Draco felt his spine rust over with terror. He looked to Snape but only saw that his godfather's cold calculating eyes were focused on his master.
Ariel chuckled under her breath as she took a few steps to meet him. "Nerd." She whispered coyly.
"N-no, madam."
Tom loathed beach days, almost as much as he despised the adults who ran Wool's with an iron-will but were mawkish and caring out in public. He hated it all. The sun, the sand, his housemates who ran around like chickens with their heads cut off and shrieked and played and ate sandy treats like they were regular children. But Tom knew better by then. They would never get to be normal children who grew up into normal adults with normal lives. They were all doomed, himself included, to lives of poverty, hardships, and unnoticed deaths. He saw their lives for what they were. They were the bastard offspring of cadavers who will grow up to be nothing more than pathetic adults with nothing to look forward to than a pauper's grave. If they ever grew up to be adults at all. And that knowledge scorched his soul and filled his little body with more rage than he knew what to do with.
"The man literally called me his 'hero'. He told me that 'I wouldn't be the wizard I am today if I wasn't for you'." Ariel ranted, her voice rising with anger and shame as she pushed herself from the floor and started to pace. "He literally called me his origin story. I am the reason that Lord Voldemort exists. I'm the reason there are little kids running around with no parents. I'm the reason millions of creatures are dead. I'm the reason—"
"I can honestly say," Snape smiled, "That's the nicest compliment I've ever gotten."
He could see a ghost of his boyhood self huddled against the end of the couch behind Ariel, watching them with attention-starved eyes. If only the kid knew, he thought. All those years of dreaming. How often he prayed, back when he was young and foolish enough to think Gods listened to prayers, he would wake up in that piss-soaked cot to Ariel's beautiful voice telling him, I'm taking you home with me. The two of them living in some crummy home, like Spinners End, ending each day together with a bedtime story. Oh, little Tom, those desperate prayers may have fallen on apathetic ears but they weren't the pathetic cries of an orphan with a pipe dream. You just didn't know it was all a part of a contingency. You can have everything you want out of life but some things had to come first. Maybe there never could be an Ariel without there being a Dark Lord first. How would there have been a Bellatrix to bring you back to me had there not been an army of Death Eaters first?
"There! You happy?"
"Wait, there's more." She pulled out the crown from her robes and gave it to him. "When I went through her stuff, I found this."
"There's an idea for you, Ariel," said Attina.
Ariel gave him a broad, sleepy smile then caressed his face with both hands and drew him in to plant a kiss on his sloppy forehead. “I love you, Tommy.” She said with a happy, drunken slur.
His speech ended when Ariel's palm collided with his cheek.
His heart froze then burned at the use of his name which rolled over of her tongue effortlessly.
"Disagree," Harry stated. He was still glaring at the entranceway. Only his mind was racing. He looked to his friends and said, "You guys go ahead."
He looked at her hand and when he looked up at her his face had hardened. He tugged his hand out of hers and said, his voice clear and hard as diamond, "This isn't about Potter. This is about removing witches and magical folks out from the rocks of oppression shadows of muggles and mud bloods. This is about making sure they don't burn any more of our kind at the stakes. This is about—"
By the time Draco had finished cleaning the second floor of Spinner's End, his body felt like it was run over by a stampede of unicorns. But even as he hobbled down the flight of steps with his collection of cleaning supplies, Draco kept his aches and pains to himself. Not out of fear of being heard by the Dark Lord, but because he didn't want to miss a word of his conversations with Ariel.
"C'mon guys," Hermione said with a hardness in her voice that signaled she was struggling to calm herself down. "That menstrual cramp of a boy isn't worth it."
"Hello, Tom."
"But we never thought we were subject to such extensive research," said Adriana with a coy smile that belied otherwise.
"Diagon Alley has plenty of places."
They shared a look then a knowing smile.
"But, enough gushing," he replied using his wand to pour them both another cup of tea, "Tell me about you. What have you been doing for the last sixty years?"
"I wonder why." She replied with a sarcastic laugh as she dried her face.
"The first."
She gave him another charming smile, held out her hand for him to take, which he did without hesitation, and the two of them started towards the castle, giddy with horniness.
"You know, I didn't think celestial creatures like yourself concerned yourself with the lives of witches."
underestimate you."
Alana grinned proudly at her sisters. "I always knew muggle writers were fascinated by us."
Voldemort halted mid-step. "Pardon me?"
Harry looked at Ruth then Ron, shaking his head. "She's such a mean drunk." He whispered at Ron, playfully.
"I would've—I would've—I would've…if I could've…" She said through croaky sobs as she held his calloused hand against her soft face.
"You thought of me?" Voldemort asked his turn to sound surprised and touched.
"Okay your turn," said Ariel. "Ask me anything."
"Tried to," he replied as he leaned down to deliver a hello kiss on her cheek. "Hello, mom."
They didn't stand there holding each other long. At some point, Nagini came out and warned him, "Sssssomeone's here." Voldemort lifted his head and peered through the streaky window. He didn't see anything but he sensed what Nagini meant. Enemies were near. Too near. He pulled himself away from Ariel and told her, "Sleep tight, drunky." Before she could respond, he pinched a nerve in her neck. Instantly, her body went limp and her eyelids slammed shut. He carefully laid her down on the dirt ground, propped her head against her cloth bag for a pillow, then ordered Nagini to protect her. The cobra compiled, slithering over to her side, laying its body lengthwise against sleeping Ariel, who snored peacefully against the welcoming earth.
"Be that so! Why turn down someone's offer to do an unpleasant task when you can spare yourself?"
"That's fantastic!" She exclaimed. "Oh Tom, I'm so proud of you."
"You wanted the truth."
Fifty-four years later and somehow that little boy from the cave was still making her cry.
"Where?"
"Well, well, well." She heard a voice say as the sound of footfalls approached her. Ariel watched in heart-juddering terror as a pair of black high-heel boots stepped in her direct vision before one boot nudged her by the shoulder and flipped her onto her back, forcing her to look. A long black-haired woman with hooded eyes towered over her, peering down at the helpless Ariel with unmistakable delight. "What do we have here? Killed five Death Eaters and you didn't even raise a wand. Don't see that every day."
"Me too."
For a moment, they stood there, studying each another's face with loving eyes.
"Mom." He cringed the second it left his tongue. His head dropped into his tented fingers. "Oh crap! I do love her!" He reached with both hands, clutching at his bare skull as if he had forgotten he had no hair to tear. When his hands came back empty, a ferocious groan roared out of him that made Narcissa flinch but he didn't strike her or destroy anything like she expected. Instead, he stood there, clawing at his hairless head looking somewhere between suicidal and homicidal before he let out a frustrated growl and cried, "What's the point of splitting your soul seven times if you're still going to feel?!" He sunk to the floor with an anguished moan. "Crap!"
"He's with his mother."
"I'm glad too because once I read that article I was hooked—pun intended—on all your articles. Any time I saw your name was in the table of contents, I'd read yours first. I don't know if you remember this but I wrote a letter to the editor about your last article." Ariel quickly tore through her tote bag until she found the issue, she needed which was bookmarked and flipped open to yet another article of his immediately. She pointed past the article to a little segment titled Letters to the Editor where A from Ocean City, UK wrote: 'In regards to Traumatic Limbs Regeneration in Non-Wizarding Folks, is it feasible for a those of the aquatic magical community, ie mermaids sirens finfolks, etc, who lost her lower half to regenerate human legs? If so, do you think they would the procedure survive and do you think it be astronomically expensive?' Snape's reply followed: 'Yes. It would be expensive and time-consuming but I think any competent potionteer would be able to pull off restoring human legs on any species.'
“Anyway, he recognized me from the paper, and complemented my choice of robes for the Ministry Ball last April—”
The photos turned out brilliantly— they had successfully created a magnificent crab kingdom. Teddy and Andromeda would surely adore this photo set. Especially the photo of the epic battle with the starfish. He could already see it sitting on their mantle— right next to the photo of Teddy posing victoriously on Harry’s lap. This was after they had beaten Draco at Exploding Snap on his 4th birthday.
Harry nodded and pointed to a large rock a few meters away.
--------------
Harry was having trouble breathing in between the laughter and the hiccups. After a minute of controlled breathing, during which Draco was thankfully silent, he was finally able to reply.
Draco followed him back and waited as Harry grabbed his bag from the tent, slinging it over his chest.
“Ah, what do we have here? Is this just for me? Why, I’m flattered,” Draco’s voice lowered in pitch and took on a firm tone, “I suppose I’ll reward you for being such a good boy.”
the failed proposal attempt.
He waved his wand to unstick the ring from the shell and placed it on Draco’s left ring finger, the cluster of white pearls adorning his pale hand beautifully.
“Hey babe, what do you think happened to dessert? Shouldn’t it be here by now?” Harry asked.
“I beg your pardon?” Draco gasped. “If anything you’re the one who is benefiting from our relationship.”
“My parents often took me to beaches in southern Italy when I was a child. They always said that the tides changed twice a day thanks to Proteus, god of the sea. If we didn’t respect his schedule, our lives could be in danger,” Draco said, crouching in the water and leaning to see the wildlife, “Knowing them, it was pure rubbish. I’m sure Granger probably knows, though.”
After they finished eating, they began to get ready for the pool. Harry quickly brushed his teeth and switched out his boxer briefs for a pair of swimming trunks. He laid down on the bed with his hands behind his head, waiting for Draco to finish his morning routine. As he observed Draco walking back and forth between the bedroom and the bathroom, he remembered to grab his watch off the nightstand and check that the time was accurate. He cast a
“Gee Harry, I think our waiter probably didn’t want to interrupt what was clearly a
“You’re a war hero, not bloody Britney Spears. Of course they don’t know who you are,” Draco rolled his eyes.
He’d have to figure out another way to get Harry to wear the talking watch.
A few minutes later, they were seated at the table awaiting a meal that Draco ordered for them. Harry didn’t know too much about food unless it involved dough. Cooking just wasn’t his thing. He was excited to see what they had for dessert, though.
He grabbed the box out of Draco’s hand and found himself bowing forward, his forehead resting on his knee, completely overwhelmed with emotion. When he lifted his head to look up at Draco, his vision was blurry and he realized he was crying.
“Good boy,” Draco said, in a sultry tone. Harry immediately straightened, heart beating a bit faster.
“What does that mean, then? You’re going to model for him? Probably half-nude?” Harry asked, still irritated at this Hoffman character. He had called Harry Draco’s date. His
“Elke, you’re drinking a margarita right now,” replied another girl. So, the first girl is called Elke?
“That was a brilliant idea and you’re just jealous because you didn’t think of it first,” Draco huffed.
. He’d have to try more to decide if he liked it or not, but he didn’t want to spoil his lunch.
Harry smirked.
Draco went over to greet them, and at the opening of the tent stood a man in a suit— possibly the hotel manager, a beefy man in the hotel uniform, and a petite Mexican woman in healer’s robes.
Harry huffed. “Seriously? I don’t think this is necessary,” he whined, “I don’t burn.”
Plenty of fit resort guests roamed the pool area, from two young men who could have passed for underwear models, to a striking older gentleman in a dashing white suit. Draco put on his most flattering bathing suit that afternoon— a fitted dark blue number that really showed off his arse, and he was feeling particularly confident with his appearance. He was happily ogling his boyfriend, who was jumping off the diving board repeatedly and enjoying himself immensely.
He patted his jacket, nervously checking that his mokeskin pouch was still in his inside breast pocket. It was. Just as it had been there two minutes ago.
“On your back, Potter,” he spoke with a slight growl. Harry’s eyes went wide, pupils dilated with desire.
we discussed,” Draco said, “In addition to what I already mentioned, Mr. Hoffman will be partnering with Malfoy Industries so that we may provide the technology to support his many business ventures. He’s starting with an order of ten-thousand mobile phones. I’m sure he means for me to sign the contract at the dinner he invited us to tomorrow evening.”
“DRACO,” Harry interrupted, still gasping for breath but thankfully without hiccups, “Please stop. I’d like to breathe.”
“Hello again, ladies. Mind if I join you?” Harry asked, in the most enticing voice he could muster.
Harry grinned at him and Draco couldn’t help but return the smile. Harry had never been to the beach before. He had never gone on holiday. He had never even had a real childhood. Draco was determined to bring as much joy into Harry’s life as he possibly could, whatever it took. Even if it involved crabs.
“With magic, of course,” Draco replied, raising his wand.
“Draco, what the fuck?” he asked, “This whole thing with Hoffman? The romantic dinner? It was planned?”
Harry was too shocked to answer him. Virgin mimosas. What a sneaky, Slytherin bastard.
Harry pinched him in retaliation.
from his father, after all.
“Okay, you’re on,” Harry agreed. “What does the winner get?”
The dish was beautifully condimented and cooked to perfection. Harry’s favorite part was the mussels, which were slightly chewy and flavorful. Draco must have noticed, because he gave Harry all the mussels in the pan.
It was Draco and his damn tongue, running up Harry’s chest. Leaving the gentlest kisses as he traveled up. But they were slow and wet, and Draco watched Harry melt in his hands. When Draco stopped and came back to his face, Harry shook his head.
“Now, we keep doing what we’ve been doing— working, babysitting Teddy, running from reporters. But we get to do it with the knowledge that whatever happens, whatever disaster may come our way, we’ll always be together,” Harry spoke softly.
Kissing down his stomach, Draco stopped above his belly button and glanced up at Harry with a sly smile. His lips left his skin as his hands moved to Harry’s hips. Fingers danced at the hem of his swim trunks, teasing as he slipped in to brush Harry’s hipbone.
Harry was positive that this was the perfect moment— they were pleasantly full from dinner but not yet completely exhausted. He was also just eager to get it over with. It was now or never.
“I’m never going to hear the end of that, am I?” Harry asked, resigned to his fate.
Parting his lover’s lips with his own, he slipped his tongue in to eat up every moan Harry gave him. The kiss was full of their love for each other, spiralling as they were pulled in more and more. Harry’s lips were pillowy, soft, perfect for Draco to sink into and kiss on and on. As the kiss slowed, Draco pulled back to kiss Harry’s bottom lip and then bit into it. Tugged at it through a smile and pushed back in, hands driving themselves into Harry’s hair once again. Kissed him deeper to leave Harry’s lips swollen and red.
They walked along and Draco realized that he was being led to the spot where Harry had been collecting shells this morning. Draco could see clusters of large rocks and colorful blurry shapes under the water, which was about mid-thigh.
“Harry, even from here, it was
you up close,” Harry growled.
“Those sprays are rubbish, Harry. They don’t cover your skin enough to actually work,” Draco was looking in the mirror as he closed the clasp of his necklace, “Trust me, this is the best way to protect your skin. I won’t have you dying of cancer in twenty years because nobody taught you proper skin care.”
Here, Draco swallowed audibly and clutched Harry’s hand tighter than ever, “You are the most wonderful man I will ever know. I would be honored if you would allow me to become a part of your family too.”
Harry said sarcastically, rolling his eyes.
Smiling softly to himself, he thought about their day so far. It had been utterly perfect— Harry really impressed him with the surprise island adventure. He looked down at his boyfriend laying down next to him. The man was spread out on his stomach, arms wrapped around the small pillow under his head. His black curls, sprinkled with sand, were ruffling in the breeze. Half his face was smashed into the pillow, but what he could see was relaxed in sleep. His ears were already red— he had probably forgotten to put sunscreen on them again, the dunderhead. Harry’s position showed off his broad shoulders and muscular back. With his t-shirt ridden up, Draco was able to appreciate the view of the dimples above his arse.
“We remove the sea urchin spines,” Draco firmly stated, with a determined look on his face.
“Yes, you’re the very picture of masculinity, darling,” Draco replied, indulgently, “I’ve always wanted to be with a man who can pitch his own tent. Did you see that the beach has tiny crabs?”
“Babe, you know I would never cheat on you—”
Come to think of it, those oysters looked nothing like the pearl oysters he had seen in the jewelry store adverts.
still manage to dominate the society pages.”
Harry rolled his eyes.
As the afternoon wore on, Harry got more and more intoxicated. But he was feeling fantastic! Draco was right, it seemed as though every available adult at the resort wanted to get in Harry’s pants. Elke and her friends. Antonello and Luca. An American pilot named Steve… He couldn’t remember the names after that because he’d been too pissed. But safe to say, he’d been teased, complemented, and groped by any number of people of both genders.
Draco was obsessive about taking care of his skin. Harry had never met anyone who used so many lotions,creams, and ointments. He didn’t fully understand it, but if it helped preserve Draco’s gorgeous skin then Harry was all for it.
His immediate reaction was one of shock, his jaw dropping open. Then he looked up at Harry, waiting for a confirmation of what this was.
“Oh I
“Why are you asking me? You’re the one who wanted to catch them in the first place,” Draco replied, exasperated.
“Hold on,” Harry said, “I never saw anyone hanging all over you. Where are all your admirers? Someone had to buy you all those mimosas, virgin or otherwise,” Harry asked, frustrated.
“I’m not being fucking
Draco cried.
“Of fucking course it was planned! I was sure you had figured me out when you gave me that look as I was accepting the dinner invite,” Draco replied, “And you just completely stole my thunder, as always. I had a speech planned and everything. I hope you’re sorry,” Draco sniffed.
“They invited me to a match! And they said we could hang out later. That they were looking for someone to play with,” Harry said.
In a swift motion, Draco swung his leg over Harry and reached up to pin Harry’s hands down. With his other hand, he slid down to the base of Harry’s shirt, slowly pushing the fabric up to his chest. As Draco’s hands grazed over his stomach, Harry arched his back with a sharp inhale.
“What? The water’s got to be at least ten centimeters higher than it was this morning!” Harry exclaimed, sounding disappointed and seemingly ignoring Draco’s warning.
Seeing him strut his way onto the yacht as if he owned it, admittedly made Harry’s knees a little weak.
Draco sighed in resignation.
“It’s brilliant. You’ll be an international baking sensation. Men everywhere will question their sexuality. Women will name their children after you.” Draco replied, continuing in a wistful tone.
Draco leaned in, his face an inch away from Harry’s and whispered, “They’re lovely profiteroles, Potter.” He closed the gap between them and their lips finally connected.
Draco stood in the sand and soaked in the view as the cool sea breeze ruffled his hair. As he took a few steps, he saw something scuttling across the sand, and when he looked more closely, it was a tiny crab. In moments, it had disappeared into the sand. Looking around, there were several small holes in the sand, which most likely belonged to more crabs. After inspecting the ground for a few minutes, he saw more crabs, both larger and smaller than the first, fleeing his footsteps. He saw a red blur out of the corner of his eye and turned his head to find a pair of scarlet macaws perching on a nearby palm tree. What an extraordinary sight. He wondered what other creatures were living in the small copse of trees on the island. Thankfully, his boyfriend spoke Parseltongue, so they were probably safe from snakes. But what about spiders and jellyfish and sharks and stingrays…?
“Why are you like this? Are you good at literally everything? This is unbelievable,” Draco said, astonished.
“I don’t have to pretend anything,” Draco said, counting off on his fingers, “You drink your cereal milk straight from the bowl, you won’t throw away pants with holes in them, you thought Mozart’s
“I haven’t told you the story yet. I got this ring from my mother. It originally belonged to Phineas Black around 1895. I don’t know if you’ve heard about him before, but he was disowned by his father, Phineas Nigellus Black, for supporting Muggle rights. He’s one of the scorch marks on that hideous Black family tapestry,” Draco looked up into Harry’s eyes, face still red and grey eyes blazing with emotion.
“Everything you do impresses me, Draco,” Harry responded, sounding heart-wrenchingly sincere. Of course, he had to ruin it by adding, “But you’re right, the crab castle is one of your better ideas. Loads better than the talking watch.”
Harry continued, “Wait, how many drinks did
“Don’t be crass. Mr. Hoffman happens to be the owner of several luxury fashion brands. In fact, he’s one of the wealthiest wizards in Europe. He would put both of our fortunes to shame,” Draco paused for another sip of his drink. At this rate, he wouldn’t die of alcohol poisoning but of diabetes.
Jesus fucking Christ,” Harry groaned, “Well, none of that matters because these people don’t seem to recognize either of us.”
Draco asked, amused.
“Hello, love,” Harry said, sitting on the edge of the chaise, “I just came to fetch you to join me for a swim. Is everything alright?” He refrained from touching Draco, as he knew it was very likely that he was about to get his head chewed off.
Draco also favored any and all of Harry’s baked goods with chocolate, from breads and scones to macarons. It was truly an addiction.
The box held a stunning black diamond ring, made of an intricately carved pale gold. It was very old-fashioned, possibly antique.
was composed by Beethoven, and you
“They were probably just drunk!”
“In the next,” Harry paused to look at his watch, “Two hours, we try and see who can get flirted with the most.”
“You’re doing a great job, don’t listen to anything he says,” Harry spoke softly to the crabs as he gently lifted them out of the bucket.
It was their first full day at the resort and Harry was having a blast. They had spent the morning in bed and ordered room service. Harry was in love with the food that arrived: sausages, omelettes, toast with jam, and eggs benedict made with English muffins fresh from the griddle. He closed his eyes as he chewed, and sent a silent prayer to his younger self going without food at the Dursleys’. When he opened them again, he was greeted with the vision of his boyfriend sitting across from him in only a robe, stirring his tea and totally unconscious of his bed hair. Draco took a few bites of his omelette and deemed it ‘acceptable’.
Draco could see the skin already beginning to stitch itself together, the potions had time to demonstrate an effect.
He was pulled out of his reverie by the distinct sound of feminine chatter and his squalid heart jolted alive.
He guffawed. He couldn't believe it. Imagining it made his core harden: little Voldemort scared shitless of a little crab. "No fucking way."
The two married that night on that nameless beach underneath a bright purple moon in a ceremony that took less than five minutes with Attina as the officiant and the rest of Ariel's sisters, and Narcissa, Snape's only guest and the only person he trusted to keep this a secret, as witnesses.
"I have to go home and feed my snake before I lose another loveseat."
He watched her eyes, waiting for them to change into loathsome pity but they never did. Ariel's eyes remained bright and welcoming as when he told her his name.
Draco ran into him and clamored onto him as he used to when he was five. Severus stood there still while silent tears ran down his worn-out face.
As he expected, she had never seen a graveyard before. Her eyes shone with curiosity as she strolled through the door.
"That one you always sing," he said as he lowered the top half of his body, resting his head on her tail.
Narcissa raised the nearly empty bottle of wine and declared, "A bottle of wine says you can't break my husband out of Azkaban."
"Just like her owner." She giggled.
"More like a man of few interests outside the stony walls of academia." He scoffed, slightly embarrassed by her generous smiles. "Um, so, you swam all night just to see me?"
Voldemort stood there, tall and smug, in her impressed silence.
"Oh...n...no. No, thank you." Ariel said. When Bellatrix wouldn't move away, she added, "I'm going to need you to take a couple of steps back and also never do...any of that again."
Ariel clawed at the dirt underneath her as she held back the visceral urge to screech at the heavens. Her body pulsated with fresh agony while the two halves of her tail contorted, turning from dark green into a fleshy white, the scales the gills disappearing and transforming into new muscles and fat.
"How did this happen?" He asked, his voice muffled as he face-planted into the ornate rug. "How did I become…that guy? That seventy-year-old guy with mommy issues?" Narcissa opened her mouth to offer her thoughts when he cut in again, head turned sideways so he could breathe, "I mean—I know I was an orphan but…Merlin's beard, am I really that weak? Am I nothing but an overgrown child who needs their mommy?"
He said it so casually. Snape was thunderstruck.
There was a long silence between them.
"Yeah. I always have. When you're not using it be a bigoted asshole anyway."
The rest of Ariel's night was punctuated by restless sleep and anxiety. Despite what she told Severus, she continued to agonize over her role in the rise of Lord Voldemort. How could she not? If you were told tomorrow your good intentions caused the suffering of millions, wouldn't you flay yourself with shame as well? Why did she lie then? Well, the same reason we tell ourselves we'll be a better version of ourselves tomorrow. She wanted it to be true. She wanted it to be true the same way Tom wanted her to be his biological mother.
His words cascaded down her ears like cold rain. She felt her stomach lurched violently as the reality of what he said settled on her.
"This is incredible," he said breathlessly as his charmed quill furiously transcribed all the fake plans. "You're so brave for doing this."
Ariel held back the urge to gag. Her breath smelled like her ass and her mouth switched places. "You know I'm dating Severus right?"
"Probably for the best," remarked Arista. "I mean, what with the state your world is right now."
"It's for only for the night," Ariel added to Draco reassuringly noticing right away the look of abject humiliation on the young boy's face at the sound of someone being in his room. Then to Narcissa, she said, "Thank you again for the kind offer. I hadn't had a chance since I've gotten to land to find a place to rest."
With that, the Dark Lord waved his arm and on cue, Ariel emerged into the room out of the shadows looking so ridiculously out of place in her pale pink dress and her bright red hair amongst the sea of darkness. Draco felt the room balk at the sight of her. He looked to gauge Snape's reaction but all he saw was the back of his head as the man turned himself in his seat to give all of his attention to his master and the new guest.
Snape smirked involuntary then stiffened his face and said in his usual seriousness, "When are you going to the cave with Potter?"
He looked up and found a red-headed woman in a purple bikini top swimming in the dark green waters. Tom froze, half-afraid and half-defiant, his hand still wrapped around the gold coin.
But he was so hungry and weary at that moment it didn't even matter to him that this was possibly his last meal. At least, he thought as he ventured towards the kitchen, I'll get a last meal. Most people don't get that privilege when it came to the Dark Lord.
"You could butcher a newborn in front of me and I wouldn't judge you."
"Your godson came by and cleaned."
"Lucius," Voldemort said in a lukewarm voice that Lucius knew, from a previous life, often foreshadowed the calm before the raging storm. "Sit."
"It goes without saying," the Dark Lord began his voice low and threatening as he migrated to the center of the room, "That what I am about to tell you may never, ever, ever leave this room."
Nothing hurt. She could breathe as deeply as she wanted. Her hand no longer burned or throbbed. It didn't even bleed. The cut turned out to be no deeper than a cat scratch. It took Ariel three minutes to calm down her deep, panicked breathing.
Tom listened to her speech, his mouth fluttered open, looking so torn and anguished by her declarations. He drew his hand out of hers, flung his arms wide, and coiled them around her, declaring, "I'll always love you, Ariel."
"I did." She paused then asked, "Is it true... is it true you made a spell that can turn people inside out?"
"That emphatically includes your big sister." He insisted, his voice an angry hiss as he began pacing the room.
Nagini, sick of being touched, nipped at the back of Ariel's hand as a way of saying, 'stop fucking touching me', then continued crawling along the sofa doing as she damn well pleased. Ariel drew her hand in time, missing both fangs, but felt the longer tear the back of her hand and leave behind a dripping puncture wound.
He gave the crown a momentary glance before he demanded, "Where are they?"
"What are you singing?" He asked finally.
“Everyone but her sister and her nephew it seems.” He said, moving his ear to her heartbeat. He listened for a while in indulgent silence then remarked, “This is nice.”
Ariel followed the creature for what felt like an eternity through the cold, unwelcoming corridors. She had to keep her eyes focused on the back of the dementor's raggedy robes as she felt the dead-eyes of every prisoner they passed follow them and burn against her soaked body. She wasn't afraid of their leers more than she was terrified by their haunted wraith-like faces. None of them even bothered to catcall her. They said nothing, knew nothing, dreamt of nothing but suffering.
“Fuck, Draco… Kiss me up here, you—AH!”
He was currently laying on a cot, spread out on the sand under shade provided by the tent. There was a towel wrapped around him like a blanket, to shield him from the cool breeze. Harry was snoozing on the cot next to him and Draco was heading that way himself.
“Oh?” Harry raised an eyebrow.
“Back...?”
He wasn’t going to disappoint him. Worst scenario, Harry would still have plenty of oysters to eat. He agreed and started collecting oysters with Harry, popping them open with his wand and handing them to Harry to put away. Harry kept giving him shifty looks and fiddling with something in his bag. Wasn’t he enjoying himself? This was his idea, anyway.
“Will you wear the ring, now that I’ve acted all
“STOP, STOP, STOP!” Harry cried, wheezing with laughter and simultaneously shoving his head into the pillow out of embarrassment.
“Your nipples landed you an amazing business deal! You’re the hottest boyfriend in the whole world!” Harry exclaimed. He draped himself all over Draco’s front and wrapped his hands around his lower back, “My boyfriend really
“Aaaargh, fine,” Draco conceded. “Stubborn bloody, Gryffindors…” he muttered, reaching to grab Harry’s hand.
“Draco, it’s not like you’d
“You sneeze and it ends up on the front page, so I wouldn’t hold my hopes up,” Draco replied, giving a crooked smile. His eyes suddenly gleamed with a slightly mad glee, and he grinned wide, “I have just the favor in mind.”
Draco rolled his eyes. A lifetime of service to the wizarding world and the man was still proudest of his Quidditch accomplishments. Figures.
The German girls had firmly latched onto his status as a bread baker and the people at the resort now referred to him as Mr. Baker. Even Antonello and Luca, who he’d introduced himself to beforehand, called him by his new nickname. Harry felt like he was shedding his old identity as The Boy Who Lived and rapidly becoming Mr. Baker— the resort’s favorite boy toy. He’d drunk three margaritas and four fruity cocktails that he couldn’t name but tasted delicious.
Draco really hoped he’d finally win that argument. It was fair, though. After handling Moldymort’s soul in various trinkets over the years, Harry had a right to feel the way he did.
Totally distracted by gushy romantic thoughts, Harry lost all desire to argue and obediently began applying the sunscreen. When he finished with the areas he could reach, he asked for Draco’s help with his back.
Harry nodded and held out the box in his hand.
at a gourmet restaurant!”
“Mhmmm. Not as good as yours, I think. You were out like a light after lunch. Just like a baby,” Draco teased.
the hottest celebrity in all of Britain. You have an official fanclub, Potter. They sell
Harry took a deep breath. This had to stop.
Oh well, he still had the rest of the day to try again.
-------
“Of course, love. You know I will,” Draco choked out. He reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a small velvet box, “You are such a fucking prick though. I can’t believe you stole my elaborately planned proposal.” He opened the box and held it out towards Harry, who was still bent at the knee.
He held out his hand for Draco, who grasped it and looked questioningly into his eyes.
Harry’s eyebrows rose and his mouth was open wide out of pure joy as he gave a dramatic gasp.
“I really don’t” Draco was cut off by three loud claps of Apparition coming from just outside the tent.
“TWELVE MIMOSAS?? How are you not passed out on the floor? Did you use a sobering charm or something?” Harry asked, shook to his core. Draco couldn’t have weighed more than 11 stone.
“Don’t come closer! There’s,
The sun had gone down by the time Harry woke up from his nap. He felt extremely relaxed and he had a really fun time at the pool that afternoon, but he was still a bit disappointed that he hadn’t been able to swim with his boyfriend. He supposed they had the rest of the week for that. As his thoughts wandered to the small velvet box in his mokeskin pouch, he frowned. Today’s antics had not been very conducive to an unforgettably romantic proposal. He was determined to do a brilliant job because Draco deserved nothing but Harry’s absolute best effort. Tomorrow, he would definitely do it. Then they would spend the rest of the week celebrating. It was perfect timing— he just had to gather up the courage to actually go through with it.
- bloody horse?” Harry asked, gasping for breath. He began holding his breath again, and was determined to hold it this time.
Green eyes just looked at him, still totally unconvinced, despite his passionate speech.
“Not after I inform the twins about your little fanclub,” Draco replied, climbing into the bed with Harry.
“But what if both your hands are busy? What if you’re blind? What if you’re paralyzed? What if you’re brewing an extremely finicky potion which requires you to add an ingredient at precisely the right time, and just as the clock is ticking your neck cramps up? The potion would be ruined! Someone’s life could be hanging in the balance!” He grabbed both of Harry’s shoulders to emphasize his point, “The talking watch can change everything, Harry.”
Bloody showoff.
“Mione either knows the answer or she won’t stop until she does,” Harry said, sounding distracted, “I was actually hoping we could look for some pearls. They come from oysters, right? The ones from this morning were somewhere near here…”
Here Draco was, wearing nothing but a gold chain and a pair of swim shorts that left very little to the imagination, looking sexy as hell, and yet nobody could take their eyes off of Harry! Draco looked down at himself and began to wonder if his physique, which he had always thought of as slender and graceful, was actually just scrawny. He looked down at his slim arms and, for a moment, he felt quite inadequate. But then he thought of the last Ministry ball, and how the Prophet article the next day spent a whole paragraph gushing about how handsome he looked on Harry’s arm in his stunning silk robes. His eyebrows furrowed as he made affirmations to himself.
Ariel kicked him in the shin and for a few horrible seconds, the two of them were glaring at each other. Draco thought the house would explode from their quiet intensity but then Ariel turned her head away and told Draco with a smile, "Thank you for cleaning the house."
He's so preoccupied, in fact, that at first he doesn't realize where they are.
Draco's eyes narrow in a glare. "Because I can do
"What, doubting my sexual prowess?" Harry says, laughing again. He doesn't know what makes him say it, except that the way Malfoy turns absolutely flaming was worth it. He
drinking. Listen to the words I'm saying."
"To Malfoy!" Williamson bellows this, too, and Draco braces himself for a poor response—but the returning roar is just as hearty as it was for Harry, and might even be stretching on longer.
"No." Malfoy still won't look at Harry. "No, I suppose it's not, but that's true of anybody, isn't it? And yet somehow, telling myself that the great Harry Potter had it worse does not make it any easier to bear."
"It does no good for team cohesion when we come back from a win only for Potter to shut himself in his cavern of an office all day," Williamson continues, right past Draco's self-flagellating, moonlit thoughts. "I think you're a bit of a twit but I think you do Potter some good when you go crashing about the offices in a fit of self-righteousness, or barge past his door to say something posh about how you need his attention."
"Who knew, all this time," Malfoy says, suddenly fixing Harry with a malicious glint in his eye, "you'd been in the closet right alongside me?"
"You're 42. Keep your nipples to yourself."
"I told you," Malfoy says, looking positively demonic. "Blackmail, Potter." Harry notices, too, that Malfoy's altered his swim trunks. Unlike Harry's standard mid-thigh fit, Malfoy's now barely skim his legs at all, closer to a brief cut than shorts. They're also now silver and green.
Ginny excuses herself and Pansy to the bar, though not before hugging Harry one more time. Pansy makes an obscene gesture as the pairs part that only Draco sees, something with a circled hand and her tongue poking the inside of one cheek, and Draco flips her off in return, mouthing a vehement
"I think," Granger says, as Weasley returns to the table, "that for all that we miss Harry so very terribly, you're the one who needs to talk to him."
"I didn't know if it was safe to come look for you, to be honest," Harry says, as he helps Hermione to her feet. "I thought I'd been caught in some kind of time traveling hex, and well—I didn't want to muck anything up. You, of all people, know how delicate time is. I didn't you or anyone else to die, or vanish, or anything else on my account."
"Harry's made it clear he won't speak to us anymore," Weasley says, and then, more urgently, "If you can communicate with him, at all—"
"You really are a Pureblood," Blaise laughs, though he doesn't make the gesture again. "What, afraid all the other grownups in the room will hear us talking about SEX?" Blaise bellows this last word, and it takes every ounce of Draco's self-restraint, every second he's ever spent in Dr. Fiddlewood's office, to not tear Blaise's head off with his bare hands. But the room is too loud for anyone to have noticed Blaise raising his voice, and Draco exhales his relief.
"Known you a bit longer than that," Harry murmurs, running his palms up and down the tops of Draco's thighs. "What, do you think you tricked me into asking you out?"
"I don't know what you mean. He paid me for my work," Draco sniffs. "Hardly helping him."
"I mean, this is what I'm wearing today," Potter says, completely ignoring the rest of Draco's words. The hood laces have been wrapped around his index fingers, pulling tight until his fingertips pale without blood flow.
He can't, of course, stop thinking about his morning with Harry, by which he means he can't stop thinking of all the different paths it could have followed. All the delicious tributaries of kissing Harry and being kissed in return, of pulling away wrinkled robes and shirts and tracing fingers down hot skin, of Harry putting kisses there, instead.
With any other client, Draco would be happy to finish the sentence with any praise-related words he could think of.
"They're little patty pans, not Hagrid's giant pumpkins. Is it really so hard to just put them in the basket?"
free food out of the deal, and I still maintain my house is nicer than your flat." He raises his arm at Draco's nudge.
Ah. No. A one followed by four zeroes, in his hand. Very damning evidence. "I did not mean to write this, no," he says, the blood draining from his face. "Thank—" Draco swallows. "Thank you, Elda." He swipes his wand tip over the numbers, pulling the ink from the parchment's surface, and writes in a very deliberate
"Draco."
"Good morning," Draco says, to be louder than the argument with himself currently brewing in his head. Harry looks up, and gives Draco a smile so much like the one in his fantasy he wants to run right back into the hall. "Ready to get sacked today?"
—sits highlighted at his drafting table, the lamp always on to remind him of his goal when his body aches from lack of sleep, his eyes sore, his fingers trembling.
When Potter locks eyes with Draco again, the fire of terror has guttered, never out but no longer roaring.
"You don't seem to be a wizard who knows how to do them well," Harry laughs. "Having a bit of trouble there, Malfoy?"
He sits, after the funeral, in his empty husbandless house and whispers to his wand, "
"Why on earth didn't you do that to begin with?"
"I don't know." Potter shrugs.
"I'm not going to toss you aside just because you've helped me feel like a human being again, Draco." Harry kisses Draco's high forehead, and Draco shivers with the electric spike that shoots down his spine. "I really, truly, sincerely enjoy you, and the person I am around you." Then he's tipping Draco's face up, bending to kiss him properly.
Griselda's thick wand goes spinning through the air, clattering against the poured concrete floor on the other side of the room. Draco clutches his wand in one shaking but purposeful fist, having pulled it from his robes as Griselda pulled him up. Griselda watches the wand fly from her hand with wide eyes, but when she turns back to him, her face is twisted with a snarling grin that fills Draco with terror.
“Veritaserum, then,” Hermione says, hands going to her purse. But Harry holds up his other hand.
mean. "How long?"
"Oh, how dreadfully heterosexual of you," Malfoy chuckles, head lolling from shoulder to shoulder.
"And my childhood, with two loving parents," Draco counters.
he wants to say. He physically bites his tongue. He should never say that.
"You haven't seen me whip you about," Harry whispers in return, as Hermione recounts Rose's first encounter with—something; Draco's entered the story too late to follow the details. Draco flushes a furious red, but his attempts to push Harry away are stymied by how firmly Harry's pinned him to his side.
"I think between the two of us, I'm more equipped to be the arbiter of what's beautiful, don't you think, Harry?" Draco says, and he can feel Harry's silent laugh against his chest. Maybe they don't need to go to the Gala after all, if it means Draco can stay like this for longer. He can have this selfish thought. "And a lifelong coward may be the best judge of what constitutes bravery."
Draco doesn't comment on her faux pas. He taps his chin, the better to control his wayward hands. "Are there other survivors on this ward?"
Draco sits, refusing to be intimidated by this strange, Spartan display. "Potter," he says, forgetting to choose between smirking familiarity and cold professionalism and getting an awkwardly muddled tone between.
"So what
"Mr. Malfoy," Elda whispers, one Tuesday afternoon. Draco startles, and realizes he's—not dozed off, not quite, but certainly slipped into some sort of fugue state.
Without exploding, Auror Potter discovers where the rest of the children have been hidden in the house, behind a false wall in the basement. They are similarly bony and dirty, but they are
Neither man says anything, the only sound the night breeze that gently bends the canola stalks as it passes. Potter looks small, surrounded by such large plant life, and lost. When he makes no move in any direction, Draco pushes through the canola to make his way over. After all, what else can he do? Find a different part of Wiltshire in which to be sad and lonely? Pretend he never saw Potter near his home?
Draco does almost all the talking as he recounts each bizarre detail of his midnight encounter with Potter—his hair grown back, his smiling banter, his admission that he'd visited the fields in the past—and yet each short, calculated prompt or question from her pushes him to admit everything he'd promised himself he'd never say.
"Thank you," he whispers, and is on his feet and exiting within seconds. Draco stays in the mystery room for a while longer, finding that now he, too, needs to reconnect with his corporeal form.
"Getting air."
"This is how you tricked me in my office."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Ah." Harry takes Draco's hand again. "So you agree, you were stupid to go off on your own without waiting for trained officers of the law to lead the charge?" And he grins, the wanker.
his friends at the same time. "Get the fuck
"To prove you're not dreaming," Potter says, with the beginnings of a grin on his face. "And I don't think you're lazy, if you're making things like this."
"Dolls don't talk. Not unless they're possessed, and possession means you can't go to the Gala." He sweeps the eyeliner across Harry's eyelids, with just a tiny point at the outer corners. It's not a complicated look; over the top makeup wouldn't suit Harry. "Eyes open. Let me look."
Potter rolls his eyes, but gives the doorknob a violent little twist and throws the door open at his back.
. Then, of course, the endless parade of hugs and goodbyes that will have to be repeated for every departure after theirs. All the while, Lily is practically twisting by the door with her need to leave.
He wills Potter to respond to this one silently too. Draco pulls at the sleeve length, tucking a pin a quarter inch above its current hem. He can feel Potter's gaze, can already feel bile in his own throat at everything he imagines is tied into that gaze. Pity. Disgust. A total lack of surprise.
"You sound just like your father," Potter says, softly.
Potter is quiet, tracing Draco's lines with his fingers. "I suppose you know what my Patronus was, like anyone else in wizarding Britain," he says, head angling as he looks down at the sketch. "This is a work of art, Malfoy. You really—" His eyes flick up, catching Draco's. "You've come a long way."
"Lunch," Potter replies. "Lunch is happening."
"Fine. But only because you're being violent and I'm afraid for my life." Malfoy finally accepts Harry's hand, and Harry takes at least a little pleasure in yanking him up so suddenly that Malfoy stumbles a few paces. "Potter! Be careful, you idiot!"
Draco gasps as he pushes himself up on his arms, holding up his wand. He doesn't know why he still has it; Griselda had every opportunity to pull it from his hand when she had him by the throat, and even now, she could disarm him any time she wanted. "
The door opens a fraction, but no sound issues from within, and Draco frowns in the middle of putting his wand away. Best to keep his wand out, then. "I'm here from Atelier Malfoy," he announces, feeling silly when there's no clear conversational partner to be had. "Is this your way of inviting me in, Potter?"
"I don't know, cheese? I'll take it away if you're going to be a snob about it."
"Things were so different then." Molly sighs again. "Your father did his best to make you as twisted as he was, and for a while, it worked. With only those memories, can you blame Harry for feeling the way he does right now?"
"Because I had to attend your funeral!" Hermione bites back. "So if you feel put-upon because one of your best friends wants an explanation for letting her think you were dead—"
There is no sudden change in Harry and Draco's work relationship—Harry is still as stoic and professional as ever, on the clock. Draco just doesn't feel like he's running into a wall of ice whenever he has to talk to Harry, anymore, and he toys with the idea of suggesting they go out for drinks. Just a glass of wine and some small plates, of course, nothing over the top that might betray his actual feelings.
Six months. Six months of Harry gone, undercover for the Ministry and out of contact. Draco thinks he's meant to work as an Unspeakable, with all his Harry-ness Polyjuiced into oblivion. It's for Harry's safety, of course; the middle-aged savior of the wizarding world can hardly comb his hair forward and stride unnoticed into a den of ne'er-do-wells. And of course, Draco doesn't even know if that'll be the case. Harry's not allowed to tell him anything.
Harry fixes them tea afterward. Draco notes, with mixed feelings, that while he's not treated to any more flowering jasmine tea, Harry's procured a tea strainer for him in the shape of a gormless-looking giraffe, and filled it with loose Assam. He chooses not to comment on it, especially when he sees that Harry's drinking PG Tips, a Muggle brand he
stairs, and he certainly doesn't want to speak to anyone.
It's a kind of loneliness he's never felt, and he thinks he likes it. It's nothing like the social isolation he felt growing up with the Dursleys, never being able to escape their presence and never being included. He can go for miles without seeing another human being, much less one that will recognize him, that will unload their wartime tragedies on him as if he's a roving pastor. Sometimes he packs a bedroll and provisions and camps out in the grasslands, lulled to sleep by the moon.
"Ah-ah-ah. This is a pep talk, not an argument." Draco finally, slowly, regretfully pulls away from Harry, holding him by the shoulders at a relaxed arm's length. "But you don't have to go if you don't want to, Harry."
"Is there such a potion?" Harry asks with another aggressive flick of his wand, missing what Draco thinks is the grace of his own suggested wandwork. "Or, I dunno, a potion you can use as a base?"
get into fights with bigoted old schoolmates. Then he has a couple more pints, and he can't remember what he'd been reminding himself.
"Yes, well." Draco pulls his work back over, and Pansy seems to finally notice it, her gaze sharpening as the cork top disappears under the masses of organza. "Lately I haven't been sleeping." He spreads his hands across the silk organza, around the wooden hoop that holds part of it taut for embroidery work. "Because of this."
the feathers, cropped high on his ankle over pointed gold oxfords, and his cotton voile shirt, with long narrow sleeves and an open-throated collar, is a nearly neon royal blue. Draco could have Apparated down to the ground floor, now that he's been added to the house wards, but he refused to deny himself the chance to let his cloak billow dramatically.
"Oh, don't do
"Oh, don't be so dramatic," Draco murmurs, taking better stock of himself now that his eyes have adjusted. He's tucked into a hospital bed, angled up just enough to see Harry without craning his neck, and he's swathed in what feels like a sea of bandages. His left forearm, in particular, is bulky with it. "What's it been, an hour?"
"What do you—ah," Potter says, cutting himself off as the measuring tape snakes around his neck, chasing Draco's fingertips as they trace the circumference of it. Potter's stubble is damp with nervous sweat. When Draco pins the measuring tape in place, he has to wait for Potter's equally nervous swallowing to stop, because the bob of his Adam's apple is skewing the measurement.
Draco finds the quietest way to the stairs, and makes his way down the very edges of the steps until he's safely out of earshot. He's got to hurry back to the atelier.
He's sitting at their kitchen table, in their house in Chudley. Ron and Hermione sit across from him; Hermione's eyes are rimmed red, and Ron's long nose has gone red from crying.
"I don't see the difference, frankly," Harry snorts, and Draco throws his arms up.
"You're awfully worked up," Griselda murmurs, lowering her eyelids coquettishly as she takes particularly languorous strides, and Draco feels nauseous at the implication of her guess. "But I mean—I'm not Voldemort. I don't actually care, you see, if I get Harry bloody Potter. I'd have to be as stupid as he was to focus on one person like that."
Harry's eyes flick down along Draco's body, then back up to his face. Draco is so
The pub door opens. "I said get gone, the both of you!" the barkeep shouts. "You're both pretty, now back to your bloody cottages and go sleep it off!" The door slams shut again.
"You know what, Malfoy? You're so right. Throw yourself off the nearest cliff for all I care." Harry rolls his eyes again, and sets off for the peak again.
"That should do you better," Draco says, once he's sure he's satisfied, and presents the sketch to Potter with much more grace than his last. Potter leans forward to take it.
"But you don't like what I've designed for you."
"You're welcome back tomorrow night," the barkeep says as she hustles both men out the door. "Goodnight, gentlemen."
"Privacy?" Draco wrinkles his nose, pulling his upper lip into a sneer. Even into his forties, Potter is still obsessed with his own celebrity status. The only reason anyone cares about the name
Draco bites his lip, frowning. "Is it so different from the way you and your Aurors put your lives on the line? It was for something important."
"What if you get there and they all see just how beautiful you are?" Draco all but whispers. "What if they're all in awe of you for being so brave?"
"You move quickly, don't you?" Draco smirks. They step nearer to the fireplace again, only three pairs ahead of them now.
"That would be lovely, thank you," Draco mumbles. He finally looks down to discover he was working on a totally different order, and immediately begins checking it for similar mistakes.
"You were trying to be good to me at the funeral, and I ran from you." Draco rolls his wand gently between his fingers. "I'm sorry."
Draco takes a deep breath. "Pansy—"
And Draco explains, until Harry understands, that if a person's magic is like a well full of water and the water is being drained, then he wants to drop a Trace spell right into that water, and let it follow the water along its new path.
Everyone is so happy to see Harry, though, that they keep filling his glass. Wine, lager, Firewhiskey, some vodka from a bottle with Viktor Krum's smarmy face on it, all of it keeps pouring into Harry's glass and then down Harry's throat. He's so happy to see his friends, in turn, that he never says no, just an increasingly slurred "Cheers!" that gets returned by the friend doing the pouring.
"I don't even know what you're so upset about. I brought you out here as a sort of—I don't know, an apology for the last time, and because it's hot out and I thought you might like it. Not to argue over pointless, stupid things again." Harry paddles after Malfoy again. "Stop swimming away, it's not fair. I can't see."
at the first Burrow dinner after Harry's completed Legilimency healing, and although Harry wasn't the only one who didn't have a clue what Ron was talking about, the evening was ruined in seconds. Harry's fear and anger devolved into a crying, shouting meltdown; Draco had to practically throw his husband through the Floo and follow him home.
He'd been so afraid just to be near her and her treasonous words. Didn't she realize she could put her father at risk, criticizing Voldemort? Not just his high position as a Death Eater, but his very life?
Suddenly, Harry's hands are wrapping around the backs of Draco's upper arms, and Draco doesn't get to talk to the floor or look into nothing anymore. He's faced with Harry's burning green eyes, the determined set of his full mouth, the way his jaw flexes with an emotion Draco is frightened to pinpoint.
"Interesting. Very interesting." Harry bolts toward Malfoy with such a sudden turn of speed that all Malfoy can do is yelp while Harry hurls him bodily into the pond, his flailing white limbs sailing over shallow waters and making a dramatic splash.
"Oh, stop it," he huffs, but she starts cackling. "If I'm a muppet, you're a cow, and what a pair we make."
The kettle shrieks back in the kitchen, and Draco pulls himself from his self-imposed torture to leave the drawing room. "What would Dr. Fiddlewood say?" he mutters to himself as he heads toward the stove, pulling the kettle from the heat as he flicks the burner off with a deft twist. But he struggles to think of just what she might tell him, hearing a replay of Harry's words again instead, calling him a manipulative cockroach.
Harry gulps between the gasps he's passing off as breathing, but his wand doesn't lower.
find their son and his wife.
"Well," Harry says with a shrug, "I've been hiking without issue for weeks and you've got a sprained ankle the one time I see you on a mountainside, so who made the right decision here?"
And stops at the sound of Potter's voice.
Potter opens a closet just past the staircase without a word, gesturing. Draco plucks a wooden hanger from inside, hanging up his cape with shame burning his face into patchy ruddiness. He's
"Sweats!" Pansy's melodramatic shriek, her hands flying to the sides of her face as if Draco had told her he'd found Potter dead in the parlor with his trousers round his ankles, tells Draco she doesn't suspect him. For now, he's successfully avoided further discussion of Potter's current appearance. Pansy reacts in all the best ways as Draco tells her about Potter's inability to choose something as basic as colors he likes, his audacity in comparing any sketch of Draco's to something implied to be cheap Muggle clothing (never mind that Draco knew it was far from his best work), the way Potter honestly thought Legilimency would be a normal part of a consult for custom garment work.
"Choose a day. You're not even seeing her properly, she'll probably be booked up. We'd just be going to the office." Draco gives Harry's hand a stern squeeze for emphasis.
"I know." Draco stops at his bench to trade his knife for a pair of shears. Hermione picks up a pair as well. "But maybe what I need to work on is figuring out how to not be loved anymore."
"Go to sleep, Malfoy."
"Yes, your husband," Hermione huffs, pointing at Draco where he's been watching from a distance. "Why haven't you come home, if you were this close, Harry?"
Harry pauses, hands clasped behind his back, though not with the rigidity of his office persona. "I suppose I do like to make friends quickly," he says, and turns back to his tea.
"I just think it would behoove you, as a man in his thirties, to care about food on this level on a regular basis," Draco says as he pours Harry a second glass. He feels warm from the wine and the sun, and from sitting so close to Harry.
"Now, usually I'd have a mockup for you to try on," Draco says, helping himself to a hanger in the same closet as last time. He thinks a bit guiltily of the mockup Pansy had found at his work station next to hers. "But bear with me, Potter, because I bring only the best of tidings."
"Whatever you like," Harry says coolly, walking backward into the pond until he's in up to his shoulders. "You haven't ever actually said you're sorry, though."
"Be that as it may." This is far from what he wants to talk about. "My point—"
"At the table, downstairs." Potter doesn't
Archimedes returns with a reply (and no companion) within a few hours. Weasley seems to have penned this one, and he assures Draco that this sort of grand return to the fold is just what Harry needs, if he's feeling so much better. It's to be held at the Burrow this Friday, and as for the who, they expect to invite the full coterie of Gryffindors and sundry, it seems. Weasley's written out the whole guest list and it takes up most of the page. Draco sees Neville Longbottom on the list, and wonders if Blaise will be in attendance. Oh, he'd never hear the end of it if Blaise caught him on the arm of Harry Potter where people could see, and all before Blaise had heard it from Draco himself. Draco reminds himself to pencil in another Slytherin gathering before the party, though he may leave Greg out again.
," he mutters as he finishes off a slice of his toast.
"Apparently, if anything goes wrong at the party, you're going to Apparate me to the moon, and we won't be seen again." Harry vanishes into the kitchen, and Draco twists his anxious hands together until his knuckles crack. He follows Harry in despite his trepidation.
Had he said all that out loud?
he wants to say, but he will not frighten off this unicorn that Potter's become.
Draco's very confused, until he comes downstairs to a brilliant shakshuka served with thick slices of toast. Harry has the nerve to apologize for not having pita on hand.
"I know," Draco agrees, sober and quiet.
"Well, I'm going up to the manor to have an ice bath," Draco says, a bit more stiffly than he means to.
"We've been through so much worse," Ron pleads. He takes Harry's other hand. "I
Draco flushes. "I don't think I'm capable of inspiring that kind of feeling, but it's a lovely thought."
he's petting it. "One that will light your face. Not backlight it."
"See you at dinner, Draco," Pansy says, with a swift kiss to Draco's hairline before she marches off. "Ta, Potter," she says as she passes Harry, and then she disappears inside.
"It's going to backlight my face, is that what you said?" Potter asks. He doesn't reach for it.
Rather than reply, Draco begins pulling out the next item. He admits he stuck to the formula of the green and silver ensemble—he still rather likes the concept of a massive robe draped over another. Masses of black organza tumble out of the bag like a Muggle magician's handkerchiefs as Draco pulls, twinkling with the ornamentation buried in its folds.
"Got your jollies, have you? Having a laugh at crazy, wretched Potter and his panic attacks, and his—how did you put it?—pathetic inability to speak to friends?" Harry advances on him, and suddenly Draco feels small and brittle, a handful of twigs in the path of an oncoming windstorm.
He fills the album end to end, packing in not just photos but old owled letters from when they were bothering each other in Connemara, from when they had started courting each other outside of the fantasy world of hols—here's the one where Harry had asked Draco to move in with a simple, short sentence, the imprint of a key folded into the parchment still there after all these years. He puts in the long letter Hermione had owled him detailing all her reservations about the relationship, warning Draco of all the ways she'd make him feel pain if he was being insincere or otherwise awful, but ultimately offering her blessing, with Ron's signature at the bottom for an easy cosign. Draco almost thinks of taking it out when he realizes he's reached the end of the album and has some more photos he'd like to put in still, but Hermione's (and Ron's) letter feels too important to the cause the album is to serve.
and let me put this blasted thing on you!"
"Please, we're not teenagers. I don't care if you drink." Malfoy rolls his eyes with his whole head this time, proving he's at least closer to drunk than to sober. "Go on, show me up. Take a drink from this godforsaken thing."
"By then, what? Harry won't hate the sight of me anymore?" Draco pushes himself to his feet. "I think we'd better get some herbs cut, too."
, he'll just have to track down the memory that contains the precise location of the bolt.
"I don't think you would, actually," Potter says, and Draco pauses, because these moments of being sassed by Potter come so intermittently that he's surprised every time.
"You know, you're right, and I'm a fool for never having realized it." The barkeep comes back, and Malfoy orders a glass of wine. "Who knew you were such a visionary, Potter?"
Then Draco Malfoy reenters his world. Just as much a whirlwind of entitlement, sharp remarks and words meant to provoke as he ever has been, somehow focused from his first step into the Auror offices on dragging Harry out of his icy disguise. For the first time in years, Head Auror Potter slips.
"No, I've got it from here, thanks mate." More crinkling as Potter bends again, his back bobbing.
"They're lucky I'm here at all. If they think I'm insulting her, they can add it to the list of all the other things they think of me, true or not."
Draco's pulse thrums through his chest, his arms, his trembling hands. "I—" He could put down the bag. He could say he meant accessories, and oh no, he's forgotten them at the atelier, what a shame. Why does it feel as though he's working up to a romantic confession?
" Draco croaks, and with a mediocre gleam of scarlet light, the hawthorn wand drops from Harry's hand, and rolls across the rug to just before Draco's toes.
It is, as he suspected, mostly drivel ending with yet another invitation to join her on the continent. Narcissa Malfoy swans from the house in Italy to the house in France and back as the weather and her mood dictate. She is not wandless, though her every spell is tracked by the Ministry through a charm created during the war trials. Draco wonders, sometimes, what made her seem so much more harmless than he—a child, at the time, pale with fright. Then he remembers what Potter said at her trial, about how he could not have survived without her courageous lie to the Dark Lord or something equally as puffed up.
"I'm not loud!" Harry shouts, and Malfoy winces.
"So you wanted that to happen?"
"I don't think I ever saw you speak to him," Harry says, frowning so hard his eyes cross. "Always with Grabbe and Coyle."
"Now, why lie to me, Potter?" Draco murmurs, switching to his silk pins. Potter grunts again. He could probably come around to Potter's front to see what kind of face he's making to go with that sound, but he's sincerely invested in the drape of the back of this robe. This time, the shoulders are actually a smidge too wide, hanging just far enough past Potter's imaginary shoulder seam to look awkward and ill-fitting. To Draco's eye, anyway. He pins.
"It's going to be glorious, you'll see," Draco says, as he lines up the five most recent client requests in the air in front of his desk.
"To make you look good. Well, as good as anyone with a Malfoy as a plus one," Draco adds.
Twelve Grimmauld Place is nothing like he remembers it, and of course it isn't. Harry wouldn't hold with troll leg umbrella stands, mounted house elf heads, or any of the other Pureblood trappings his Great Aunt Walburga had so proudly displayed. Harry's version of the Black family home is warm, and somehow invitingly messy, nothing like the office he keeps at the Ministry.
Granger adds, as a post script, that Draco should come, then adds another post script saying she hopes Draco had already assumed he would be in attendance. He rolls his eyes before summoning more parchment.
It should be a compliment. Something that should make Draco preen. Why yes, he has come a long way since his days as a misguided and arrogant youth, barrelling down the path of bigotry and possible murder. He's come a long way since being a resentful young adult, giving lip service to how he's changed without doing any of the work. A long way, even, from the sad and quiet man who accepted every and any insult with gusto, convinced he could never rejoin the world so long as he was exactly who he was. Draco Malfoy at 42 knows himself, from the past he will always be sorry for, to the talents he will never deny. And all those long ways have been acknowledged—by his friends, by his former enemies, by the press, even by his mother.
"Well, I did it because I knew I could help and you weren't doing too well, but clearly I made a mistake," Harry says, rolling his eyes as he gets to his feet. "Most people say thanks when they're given help, you know."
"I'm not naked," Potter mutters, and Draco stifles his laughter. It's such a silly response to Draco's spiel. "Fine. You're a professional, and all." The charm melts away, though Draco thinks he's never seen a charm dissipate so slowly.
"Oh, I do now, unquestionably," Ron agrees. "We went through a bit of that as well. Harry made some kind of up-his-arse speech about how he knew we weren't like to accept Draco, and I said something wise about how we're all grownups giving each other second chances."
"Harry Potter won't find you, but maybe I'll keep your body in stasis for a little while," Griselda hisses through her awful grin, "and bring it to him so I can show him all the ribbons I cut you into, before I kill him too! A lovers' reunion!" She throws her head back, her laugh feral and loud, a hyena before it makes its kill.
Now Harry frowns. "'Draco'?"
, and lets his head roll across the leather so he can stare at Potter.
They're quiet again, the only sounds the breeze, the buzz of insects and chirp of birds, the clink of the heavy wine bottle against the fragile wine glass as Draco pours his own serving.
"This is a mad amount of basil," she says with a shake of her head, but she gets down to join Draco and begins snipping. "I just want you to find, I don't know, a middle ground between having fantastical expectations and giving up. I certainly don't want you to give up."
Instead, he takes a bite. The pasta is creamy, nutty, complex despite its simplicity; the bucatini is cooked perfectly
A sea of gold.
His ears prick to the scuff of an uninvited shoe against the floors outside, and his heart drops into his stomach, his skin cold. He knows, he
"He's Harry, isn't he? He always comes out alright," Ron assures him the next time he’s over, because Hermione told him about Draco's obsessive checking of the paper.
For now, he takes Blaise up on his dinner party invitation, and tries very hard to be sociable and present, not thinking about Harry or the photo album at all, for at least this one night. The wine helps.
Draco owls back that Thursday will work for him, keeping all his theories and jokes firmly to himself. He's got to save them for Pansy, anyway, he's pretty sure she'll laugh at the secret life thing.
have his wand back, he
"Right then," Draco says, snatching up his tape again as he gets to his feet. He opens the drawer of his drafting table, pulling out a notebook, quill and inkpot. A Dictaquill is so much more convenient, but he thinks saying every measurement aloud for the sake of an enchanted quill might be what kills Potter at last. "Let's get measuring."
i'm excited to post the beginning of my second hp fic ever! i'm not sure how long it will be, although i have the story more or less plotted out to the end; that T rating should stay correct, though.
"No," Harry moans, voice small. He reaches for Draco's hand, and Draco mirrors him, ready to clasp Harry's hand. Instead Harry grabs at the ring, trying to yank it off, and Draco yelps. "It's a glamour charm! Or transfigured! How did you know how to make it look, Malfoy? Been spying on me while I suffer through missing decades of my life?!"
"You're his friends," Draco points out. "Not me."
But the roots of their love are deep, and strong. And together, they make it bloom anew.
"It's not afternoon!"
"Who?" Harry's voice perks.
She sighs. "Just because we're back at Hogwarts doesn't mean you have to behave like a teenager. I saw you slipping away and came to check on you."
"There is no excuse for how I treated you." He can imagine Dr. Fiddlewood in the wings of the proverbial stage of his mind, mouthing along and encouraging him to keep going. "I was a child, but so were you. I am—" Draco licks his lips, frowning. "I am trying to not be my father's son. I am trying to do better. And I'm sorry. For everything."
"Your friends need you," Draco croaks, before Harry can say something that will kill him on the spot. "They miss you."
Harry had been in the room when Draco had first held Hugo. He hadn't fallen in love with holding an infant all by himself; no, Harry had been next to him, arm held around Draco's waist to anchor him in the sea of Ron and Hermione's doubt. Harry had been there when Molly had embraced him. Harry had never missed a Burrow gathering. Whatever happy moment Draco tries to summon, that he might send a message to his friends that he's sorry, that he doesn't want to push them away anymore, Harry is always there, infecting the memory with pain and sadness.
"Forget—?" Pansy's pug nose scrunches.
"Ah! Not until I've finished pinning these bloody trousers," Draco says, lunging for Potter's legs with a pin at the ready.
Harry laughs. "Did you just call yourself a swot?"
And because the Ministry can't admit they seem to have misplaced Britain's most famed modern wizard—
Draco doesn't mean to shift his weight. He didn't think Potter would be able to hear it over the roar of his own words, as he'd gotten louder with each disparaging word, but suddenly everything is absolutely still, from the absolute silence in the room beyond Draco, to Draco's frozen body, breath held prisoner behind his ribs.
Draco struggles against Harry's strength to snatch his hand away, and cradles it to his chest as he stares at Harry, panting.
Potter calls right back, tearing his wand from his sleeve to blast Pertinger with a Stunning Spell. It lands at her throat, and she falls back to the bed, gasping and shaking, but her eyes are still open. For once since Draco began this case, there's emotion painted across Potter's face, his expression sick with anger and despair. He Stuns her again, and she goes limp, her wand arm hanging over the edge of the thin mattress.
Dr. Fiddlewood wouldn't want him to say he isn't. She would want him to agree with Harry. "I don't know," he says, splitting it down the middle.
"Harry," Draco whispers, Harry's wand still pointed at his throat. "What are you doing?"
"Drinking this morning before I came to get you, were you?" Harry asks with a nervous laugh, rolling onto his belly in the water to swim after Malfoy.
Draco casts Harry a suspicious look, but nods. "Alright." He lets Harry press the wand into his hand.
There's an intersection of those two ideas dancing at the tip of his mind's tongue, but Draco can't quite spit it out. That, and his father's casket is fading from sight, the last of his mother's spellwork moving it to its final resting place in the catacombs. Draco shudders to think there's been a space for his corpse there since the moment he was born.
"Oh." Malfoy hasn't got anything to say to that, it seems, and conversation dies again, until he says, "I always thought you hated to be alone. Every single time I saw you at school you were always surrounded by people."
It's such a simple incantation. A single word that robbed Harry of years of his life; the Mediwizards at St. Mungos admitted Harry would likely never remember who cursed him, even with a full Legilimency healing. And yes, Draco believes he's powerful enough to pull off a memory charm of the magnitude and precision required. He could Obliviate himself.
He turns around, and sets off for the mountain again. He
But Draco Apparates back off to the manor, feeling as heady as he is elated.
, the better to be petty.
"Granger-Weasley has those, too," Draco points out.
he's crying. Potter curls over completely, the shroud pulled taut between his two pale-knuckled fists.
"He called me disgusting," Draco says, watching Harry give him such a look of loathing that tears prick his eyes. "Pathetic. Said even if he were gay—Hermione, he doesn't even know his own sexuality anymore."
"Please," Weasley adds.
Harry is the sun, after all, and at the Gala Draco will be the moon, shining only by grace of the sun's reflected light. Harry is a bright flame, after all, and Draco is a moth all too ready to burn up in that heat.
For once in their long, complicated history, Draco is glad for Harry's fame, which keeps him from being subjected to long testy arguments about where he's allowed to go and why that list is so short. If the Ministry has sacked Harry in the past three days, the staff at St. Mungo's certainly haven't been informed, and it isn't long before Harry—and Draco, hurrying to keep up behind him—is escorted to that same strange, hushed part of the hospital where Draco had first seen Auror Pertinger.
All Draco wants, in this moment, is to go to Harry. To wrap his arms around his waist from behind, pillow his head against his shoulder, let him know quietly with his body that he's not alone. He finds compromise in rising from the table to stand just next to Harry, close enough to touch but not touching yet. "You're not ruining my life," he says, almost a whisper.
"I promise you this much," Draco says at last, breaking the ugly silence between them. "I only want to help. Please let me do that."
before I had to look at you first thing in the bloody morning." Draco throws back the covers to find he's at least still dressed in his disgusting T-shirt, with nothing to cover his arse but a pair of briefs. He apparently hasn't got any dignity left anyway, so he plants his feet on the floor and makes an attempt to stand. He falls right back onto the mattress, his legs infuriatingly shaky.
"You were supposed to infer that I was when I asked how I could possibly say no." Pansy is smirking, which coming from her is a relief.
"I'm sorry to hear that."
"Disgusting," she replies without inflection. She bats away this request, as well, and it crinkles at her touch, as if offended by her rejection.
At least there's no more Pureblood nonsense. He'll take mortification over that any day. But no, he doesn't ask her to sell Malfoy Manor anymore.
She finds Draco, sixteen, head bent over the sink. She finds him whirling to face Harry Potter, an Unforgivable already forming on his lips, because he hates himself, because he
to address Harry's little joke. Why let Harry remind him of reality?) Harry pulls him up with such strength that Draco stumbles several steps. "Harry!"
More glory days come to him as he sits at the kitchen table, waiting the scant few moments it takes for his tea to brew to a rich, buttery flavor. It was at this table that he had first been accosted by the occupation's youngest member, a scowling girl with long flaxen hair and virtually no eyebrows on her square, strong-featured face. Griselda Yaxley, too young for Hogwarts but apparently not too young to be indoctrinated into a violent blood purity cult.

"And good morning to you, mysterious yet obvious patch of shimmering air," Draco says as he enters Twelve Grimmauld Place again. "You could just leave the door open, you know, instead of doing this every time. Merlin forbid the postman see you."
Harry arches his brows as he lays a healthy slab of shepherd's pie onto Draco's plate. Draco expects him to wax nostalgic about their rivalry, but there's no misty-eyed recollection happening behind those serious green eyes. Draco swallows, reading everything he needs to in that one look. The train. Draco's every awful word to Harry and both his best friends. The train, again, but different. The cabinet.
spoken at Malfoy's trials.
Harry looks oddly somber at that. "I don't—I don't mean to leave in the middle of things, you know. I don't want to go back to work for any number of reasons, but this is certainly on the list now." The smile he gives Draco this time is weak, falling almost as soon as it's up. "It's not what I expected to happen, if you want to know. You surprised me." Harry adjusts his bag, clearing his throat. "But I'm glad you did."
"And convince Blaise to come? He won't pick up my firecall."
As he settles into the earliest bedtime he's had in months, Draco is fully aware of what an unhealthy fantasy he's entertaining when he lets himself pretend Harry Potter's asked him out on a date. He knows the longer he luxuriates in the daydream of entering the room with one arm twined around Harry's, of Harry introducing him as his
"Your fault for wanting a difficult man," Draco replies, but he feels heady, disconnected from the earth. Giddy, that might be a term that applies here. And then— "You do, don't you?" Draco falters. "Want me, I mean."
"Well spotted," Potter grunts, managing to turn the doorknob enough that he can get the door the rest of the way open with his foot.
Hermione looks at Draco in alarm, then turns back to Harry. "You know how old you are, don't you?" she asks, faintly.
When Draco closes his eyes, all he can see is Harry as he's come to know him, soft and open in moonlight, happy and loving in sunlight. Harry who cooks for him, Harry who likes him, Harry who casually admits he fantasizes about taking Draco on holiday. Harry who fixes him a friendly romantic picnic and silently hopes Draco will kiss him for it. Harry who shares his fears with Draco, Harry who opens himself to Draco's fears in return.
Harry turns to leave without another word, and for the second time in recent memory, Harry Potter has left Draco a sobbing, breathless mess.
"No! No, not at all," Harry says with the last of his laughter, before taking a seat at the kitchen table with Granger. "I mean, good that she, er, knows about gay people."
"I certainly don't know," Draco says, with a dry voice and arched brows. "Are you or aren't you?"
Draco says under his breath, hating much he likes the sleeveless pagoda shoulders balanced with a high slit and matching opera gloves, all in a blue so delicate it's nearly white. It should be tacky, he thinks, and he reassures himself that Fleur Delacour could make anything look good. As Harry and Bill chat, Draco is left trading thinly-veiled barbs with Fleur about each other's fashion sense.
like that," Harry snickers. "I promise, Draco, that I'll try my very hardest not to die again."
"That's why you're helping me with it, idiot. If we split it, it's only, er..." He holds up his fingers, but fails to count on them. "What, three? Three pints."
this is part of a double update, which is why the chapter count went up by one again!
trying to speak every blasting spell he knows until either he dies for his efforts or until one hits. And then he will keep trying some more. "Bomba—" She slices him down the middle of his abdomen and his new scream is barely distinguishable from the constant sobbing that won't stop coming out of him.
"Biased is the diplomatic term," Draco sneers in reply. "I made Harry look like a god, and you made Weasley look like an off-season matador."
Few of Draco's childhood memories are so clear as the day he received his wand in Diagon Alley. It feels strange to his touch, the wood smooth and cold, and he hesitates to touch it again.
"I did see," Harry says, a bit kinder now, "that you've become a good man, in all this time. Molly loves you, you know, and that's no small thing. And this garden is—Malfoy, it's wonderful."
Draco arches his brows, but selects another pearl rather than comment any further on Harry's hermit tendencies. He's fairly certain the way to find out why Harry's put himself on house arrest for a decade is
"They told me a few other things, as a matter of fact," Draco continues. His thumb is getting tired, so he switches to his index finger, holding Harry's hand with just one of his own. "They never cut you off."
to my list of titles."
posh, and a peacock, and—"
"No, no, we have to pull out the big guns, don't we? Now's your chance to show Parvati Patil that you do know how to show a girl a good time, and be the best looking pair on the dance floor. Potter, do you know how to waltz?"
"No." Harry rolls his eyes.
Yet again, Draco doesn't quite remember how he gets to his next location. He's dimly aware of walking back out to the lobby, and the squeezing sensation of being Side-Alonged, but he doesn't remember going up the stairs at Twelve Grimmauld Place. Careful hands lay him out on a soft surface that must be a bed, and pull off his shoes, open the throat of his robes and the shirt beneath. Draco puts his own groggy hand to the fly of his trousers; he hates to sleep with a waistband choking him. He's fairly sure he's not the one who finishes the unbuttoning, and then his trousers are being tugged off his legs.
funny. "About time," Draco says, brandishing a heavy graphite pencil.
"Oh, Draco," she says, with a sympathetic click of her tongue. "How long has it been since you used your magic? Fifteen years?" She waves, and Draco is pulled by an unseen force into the center of the room, right onto the massive blood stain. "I think I've gotten everything I wanted to say out of my system, and it's clear you really are alone. Let's begin your death, shall we?"
The "perfectly functional atelier" still sees plenty of use. Client requests for jackets and robes for the Gala have ramped up, and while they're not as intensive as the full ensembles Draco had been working on, they still take a good deal of time. Atelier Malfoy begins declining all requests, with all five couturiers full up on work.
"So that's a no on placard mischief." Draco finds his place sitting next to Harry, the stone of the dais cold through the thin materials of his dress. "You're not a mess so much as someone who's willingly thrown themselves into the deepest part of the lake."
"What's wrong with that?" Harry wants to know. "Weren't you and Pansy Parkinson a thing?"
"But what
Harry shrugs at his old friend. "It's summer hols, Hermione. Besides, the kids don't like physical media these days, don't you know? She could be reading loads of books, for all you know."
"I have not."
For a moment, both men are frozen. "That's, erm," Potter says, his entire stance shifting. "That'll be the grocery delivery."
"Can't I want one anyway?"
Draco presses the organza into Potter's hands. "It's not done yet," he says, watching Potter twist and pull the organza to find the golden stitches Draco's lost so much sleep to, to flatten it into planes and see the larger scope of the image Draco's made. "But it's close enough that I thought I could show it to you."
But Potter shakes his head. "Perhaps, but nothing to do with you. I'm aware of the work you've put in. Hermione says you dressed her for an event."
"I need you to speak to him for me."
Draco forces himself to raise his wand, through the vertigo of blood loss, through the fog of the agony of all the places his body has been torn open. Griselda is already raising her hand in turn, probably to hit him with another taste of her exacting Sectumsempra, but he opens his mouth for the incantation anyway.
"There." A thump accompanies Harry's voice, and Draco flinches again.
Maybe he should have conducted all of this business out in the hall, actually, all jokes aside. There's something about the drawing room that makes it feel intimate as Draco presses the end of the measuring tape to the bony knob at the top of Potter's back, smoothing it along the gentle valley of his spine. It doesn't help that when his hand stops at the small of Potter's back, the man gasps, just enough to make Draco dizzy for a moment. When he tells Potter what he'll measure next, the words are hushed, like it might spoil the mood if he raises his voice above a murmur.
"Stop stalling, then. Upstairs!" Draco commands, a long hand pointing heavenward.
Delight spreads across Malfoy's face, and he slides even further down the wall as he laughs helplessly, until his whole long body is laid across the grass, his head propped against the base of the wall. "Merlin, do you mean it?" Malfoy asks, still laughing as he wipes at his eyes. "Or is this because I called you drrreadfully heterosexual?"
"What Ron means," Granger says, and Draco whips his head to look at her, "is that while the apology is very,
"I—" Draco has to say this clearly. "I made a photo album. So you could see."
years ago by now, and the quote has dogged him since, to the point of annoyance on his part. "Melinda Hemlock," Draco mutters, rolling his eyes. More like
Potter looks at Draco's hand as though he's found a knife stuck through his wrist instead, and Draco's hand darts back to his side of the table. The other man keeps watching Draco, his frown different as he regards him. Suddenly Draco doesn't know where to put his hands, or what to do with his face.
Pansy cackles. "No, you came here because you crave Potter's arse, and you want him to say he l—"
Draco quashes his natural urge to be snide, because who else could he be? The papers have certainly always zeroed in on his high Black forehead, highlighted as it's become over the years by his receding hairline. "Yes," he grits out at last, smoothing the word down just as it emerges.
"I can't sit between you and Hermione!" Draco whisper-shouts. "I didn't know I'd be sitting up here!" He picks up her placard, and Ron's as well, shuffling them over and placing his own placard at the end. "I shouldn't even be—"
I'm so excited to have taken part in hd wireless—my first hp fest ever! I want to give a big, happy shoutout of thanks to my wonderful alpha reader, G, who let me ramble endlessly every moment I got stuck, and to my excellent beta reader, K/N, who never lets me get away with anything, and rightly so. I'd also like to thank matsinko for this excellent prompt, to which I can only hope i've done justice:
And Malfoy catches him. Draco catches Harry.
Harry's eyes flick open, regarding Draco lazily. "Of course I did. I didn't make it easy for you, did I?" He chuckles. "You fought so hard to pull me out of my own stupidity that I hated you all over again, in the beginning. And you did it more than once. So yeah, of course you're brave, Draco." Harry's eyes start to slide closed again.
He signs his name to pay her the owed 30 Galleons; Gringotts has made some forward progress since his father's time of heavy sacks of gold needing to be carried and passed around. He agrees to his next appointment in two weeks, same time and day as ever, and makes his exit.
Potter shrugs. "Honestly? Something like that, yeah." He only barely looks bashful, the bastard.
"Draco! Psst!" Harry lifts the front of the shroud, and Draco jumps. "What are you doing?"
a big shoutout to spacehubsands, Saphira and ThestralHouseofBlack for excellent alpha and beta reading, the britpicking channel, and everyone else in the drarry server who helped me out with this chapter—it was a group effort for sure!
He Apparates before Hermione makes it back to Harry.
There is, at least, no doubt that she's guilty. Draco's first words to the Aurors who interview him at St. Mungo's are to say that he'll bear witness at her trial, assuming the Wizengamot don't simply throw the book at her.
"Where's that energy for Hugo, darling?" Ron asks, taking a seat on the wicker loveseat next to his wife, holding two hefty teacups of coffee. "He's a smart lad."
"To the Granger-Weasleys first, then to Harry," Draco instructs Archimedes, petting his lovely white gold feathers and feeding him a strip of jerky. "And if that git Weasley tries to read Harry's letter, you have my permission to bite him as hard as you like." And then, "Don't bite the children. Just avoid them." And off Archimedes goes.
or whatever awful dismissive thing he was taught to consider her as a child, but twenty years after the end of the war, she seems to have gotten smaller, all her aches compressed into a shrunken space. "I can understand Harry a bit, you know."
"You deserve that," she says, but she clasps his hands properly anyway. Draco has always had enormous hands as an adult, with fingers fit to play the piano and knuckles that he thinks look arthritic and awkward. They make Pansy's hands—soft, chubby—look all the tinier.
"Touché," Blaise snorts. "But what I'm up to hasn't got to do with my dead husband. It's been a year, Draco."
much of an idiot. I don't ever want to feel that way again. You know that, or you ought to." Draco stares at her, and Pansy only frowns. "And I'm not risking what we've built. Not like that."
"Why ask me here if we're not staying?" Draco says, unable to keep the mild irritation out of his voice. He's simultaneously relieved and disappointed that Pansy was wrong, bu tries to lean more toward relief. After all, Pansy will hate being wrong.
The silence that follows feels like the pressure of the deepest oceans, pressing on Draco harder with every passing second.
That doesn't seem to be the reaction Malfoy wanted, because he's frowning, and says, "Oh, come off it, Potter, that didn't hurt your feelings. There's no way."
"Thank you for the reminder," Draco says drily, holding up a hand to the server offering a tray of Champagne flutes. Hermione takes one, replacing it with her empty glass.
"Then you ought not leave Charlie waiting." There's that ugly spike of jealousy again, making his words so much thornier than Harry deserves.
makes it perfect. Draco's heart aches to look at him, a celestial body come to visit the people of Earth in the shape of a beautiful man.
"This! I'm—I'm old! I've got aches, and crow's feet, and there's gray in my beard! I've got a bloody
"Sorry! Sorry," Harry says, collecting his glasses as quickly as he can without poking Malfoy in the eye.
Pansy leans forward, eyebrows now wiggling like a stadium audience waving their arms, and Draco decides immediately he will not share the news of Potter's weight gain. Not yet, anyway; it's not like she won't find his measurements once they're taken, or see the completed garment once it hangs on a Resizing Dress Form, patent pending. And she's well aware of the privacy agreement Draco signed, promising she wouldn't even talk to anyone else in the atelier about it. But telling Pansy now feels salacious in a way that makes him feel slimy, rather than the bitchy delight gossip usually brings him.
"Not Friday. Thursday."
The third reason the spell took so long to construct is because it's powerful. As it leaves Draco's wand, it embarks on a trip around every inch of the globe, hunting for Harry's magic, and his alone. It will seek him where the air is thinnest, and where the water is darkest. It will look for him in every crowded city and every lonely plain. Wherever Harry is on this planet, Draco's spell will find him someday, dead or alive. And when it does, it will open a portal—all Draco will have to do is step through.
Malfoy, and starts making his way down. "Come on, then. Keep up."
The news is finally broken. Harry Potter is presumed dead, after a hushed-up disappearance, and the fact that it breaks via the front page of the Daily Prophet means that Draco can't refuse to mourn in peace. Although the masses are held back fifty solid meters from the funeral, he can still feel their eyes on his back, still makes him feel as though he might as well be burying the casket right in the middle of a public thoroughfare.
For himself.
He shivers out in the moors when he thinks of the words
Nothing's jumped out at him yet, so he takes one step toward the odd wall out, waits to die, and takes another. Still alive. He heads toward the wall at a brisker pace, inspecting it despite not knowing what he ought to look for. The edges don't look properly joined to the other walls. When he knocks on it, it sounds less like a wall and more like a door. Draco frowns, and taps his wand against it, murmuring spells to investigate it.
Harry drops his wand as he buries his face in his hands, and Draco rushes to pick it up, putting it on the dresser behind him without ever taking his eyes off the other man. "I don't doubt you want me to go," Draco says, quieter yet, "but I can't leave yet."
What he does notice, when he realizes where he is, is that Potter's not got his Disillusionment Charm up. (Either that or he dropped it in the span of time Draco spent checked out.) Draco's brain scrapes for a greeting, and comes up with, "A lovely morning." A groan follows; it's not morning, and that doesn't even begin to qualify as a greeting.
The smile drops from Potter's face, and now Draco wishes he hadn't said anything. He doesn't want to be the person who stops Potter from smiling, not anymore. Not ever, really, even when he thought he did.
"Still not compelling," she says, sighing. "I think you've been risking it perfectly well these past few weeks. You put on a good show for a while, after our little talk, but lately..."
"Well, it's—" She turns it back over, frowning at the croquis in its fitted little suit. "Darling, it's a bit bare, isn't it?"
"An enervating potion," the orderly explains. "We use it on the wards quite a bit—maybe even a bit too much," she admits with a grimace and a glance upward. "But it'll make you feel instantly awake. A tiny sip's worth about a half hour. The whole bottle usually lasts a full shift."
Harry opens it, and Draco recognizes its contents immediately.
There's a very pregnant pause as they look at each other, and Draco swallows around a tight throat, wondering if he's imagining how dark Harry's eyes seem to have gotten. Then again, the room itself is dark, so he must be. Then Harry laughs again.
But Lily is already headed up the stairs. "Goodnight," she says softly, once she's halfway up, then turns back around to keep climbing.
Dr. Fiddlewood's voice says in his head, and Draco looks down, steepling his hands and touching his fingertips together over and over.
"Why?" Draco asks, in a voice he doesn't mean to be so small.
"I already added you to the wards, so can we skip the fire?" He's standing so close to Draco's back, and Draco doesn't think it's unreasonable anymore when he imagines just sinking back into Harry's arms, maybe tilting his head to let Harry kiss his neck.
"Please, I'm too sober to discuss your sexual confusion in relation to my sad attempts at banter," Malfoy says, waving his free hand. "Entirely my fault for trying."
When he looks up, Harry reaches for the wand, holding out his own. "I think you know what you have to do," Harry says.
—when I can't—I can't even—" His sentence ends in a frustrated grunt, and he rises from the bed so abruptly that Draco falls back in a tangle of his own legs. "I can't even come over for bloody tea and biscuits without abusing the only person brave enough to be close to me these days!"
"I might do him wrong," Harry remarks behind them.
"I hired you to design an outfit. You're the most celebrated designer in wizarding Britain," Potter says, flinging his hand out as if gesturing to wizarding Britain itself. "So design something."
"Yes, Judge Fiddlewood."
Draco snorts, pawing Harry's face away with his better hand. "Incorrigible. Absolutely horrible. Don't kiss me anymore." Harry laughs, just for a moment, kissing Draco's hand as it bats at him instead. And then—
"I—yes? I mean no!" Draco says, almost yelping as he corrects himself. "Yes, all of the above are behind all the reasons you listed for why you've so ardently convinced yourself I've returned to the bottle. No, I'm
"I only want to bring a handful of different witches and wizards in front of Pertinger. You can vet them; you can
"In here," the orderly says, standing five feet from the door at which she's gesturing. "Do you want me to wait for you?"
"Why—? Because you're paying me." Draco feels lost. "I need you to put on the robe if I'm going to check the fit, Potter."
doing here?"
"Are you ready, Harry?" Draco whispers into the crown of Harry's head.
"I just think it's funny," Harry says with an extra chuckle. "I can't imagine Draco Malfoy, age 11, thinking he'd ever call himself that."
"Told you we'd last," Pansy says, when she arrives with Ginny. She sticks out her tongue.
"How dare you!" Draco gasps, and he's only half-joking. There's plenty of interest in his sketch, with fine fabrics and plenty of glamour.
Draco thinks, but blessedly does not say as he rises. Potter puts a hunk of hard cheese into Draco's washed hands without looking at him, pointing at the grater nearby. If it were up to Draco, he'd simply use magic to get this done—but it's clear that's not how Potter does things. So he grates.
That gets Draco a sharp look from Harry, but it subsides quickly. "I just don't want people to make that connection, is all. Cooking isn't that for me. The weight came on when I first started staying in and I didn't know how to take care of myself, and once I did start taking care, only a bit of it came off, and... Honestly, I didn't care to try and lose the rest of it." He shrugs deeply, as though he wants to hide between his shoulders.
"I'm just glad to see you're doing well," Ginny says. Draco doesn't understand how she can sound so kind and so mischievous at once. "Mum's going to go mad when she hears you turned up at some bigwig event before you ever came by the Burrow, you know."
Dinner is simple fare, hot and well seasoned, and it's another lesson to Draco that the best food is not always the most expensive. The children join them at the table and absolutely dominate all conversation; Draco is more than fine with that. He feels Hermione's presence acutely, and he wonders if he's going to have to have a similarly difficult conversation with Ron; it seems like a fifty-fifty chance to him.
"Well, I
"Oh, Draco."
around him.
"So you can give me a time to come over and
"Ron. Hermione." Draco scowls. "I don't know the whole collection, alright? There's a handful of them."
"—with all your weird, ostentatious Malfoy shit. I'm not you! I don't dress like this! And what's more—"
"I have not—"
"Oh," is all Draco can manage, because he'd expected—
"You look like you belong in the Basilica," Ron laughs, reaching to flick one of the metal flanges of Harry's headpiece, and Draco wants to slap his hand away. "Are they finally granting you sainthood tonight?"
Draco must have dissociated, because it feels like time has barely passed before a plate clatters in front of him. A generous twirl of pasta in a thin white sauce takes up most of the plate, with a parenthesis of garlicky broccolini beside it. A moment later, Potter's taken a seat across from him with his own plate. Thin-stemmed goblets of white wine pop into place beside each plate, and Draco gently pushes his away while Potter is looking down.
"Water." Draco purses his lips. "I'm on the clock."
"You don't like it," Draco says, panic only making his dizziness worse. "You don't have to wear it! You have an entire other completed ensemble to wear! I'll take this one home and make a bonfire, you can come by if you promise to cook—"
"By being me, I suppose," Potter says with another tug at his hair. His hairline doesn't seem to have moved at all since they were in school, drat him. Drat Lucius Malfoy and his genetics, may he rest in some modicum of peace, but not too much. "I did try to actually shave my hair off, you know. It just didn't take."
Harry nods, with only a heartbeat of hesitation. "Yeah." He picks up the shroud, turning it over in his hands—and sets it back down. "Yeah, I'm ready."
at all, but Harry. They know Harry, they like and even love Harry. Draco is a strange and immodest ornament at best, who wishes now he'd worn trousers under his dress. He wonders if Pansy's doing any better—and has his question answered ten minutes later, Pansy just as involved in a conversation with some part of Harry's cohort as Ginny is.
and think that means they ought to throw a
"I—" Draco twists his woven fingers against each other until it hurts. His mouth is as dry as if he'd never had any tea at all. "N—" He swallows, and Harry watches him as though his life is on the line. "No, of course I want it to be, but—is that what
"Nobody's going to come barging in before you're ready," Draco reminds Harry, as he holds up the finished outer robe. "Relax."
Their hikes get longer by the day, and what began as long stretches of silence interrupted by bouts of round-cornered insults become long chats about anything, seeded with deep truths. Harry learns that no, Malfoy's father never hit him, the way Ron said he must, but only because Lucius saw corporeal punishment as being for servants and poor people. He learns Malfoy's known he was gay since before he even came to Hogwarts, but even then he sensed it would cost him to say as much to anyone. He learns, and he would have seen it in the Prophet had he left for Ireland a day later than he had, that Lucius is dead.
"Yes, I was planning on laying you down on it, but I had to buy the biggest one they had to accommodate your massive head," Harry replies, hurrying past Malfoy so he doesn't have to school his face into passive calm anymore. His head is filled with images of pressing Malfoy into the tall grass, making his ears flaming hot, followed by his own mental voice shouting that these aren't his own thoughts—he's just alone with Malfoy and an overactive imagination, is all. If Ron and Hermione were here, he'd never consider it.
Potter's hand slips from his grasp to reach up and thumb a tear from Draco's eye, and Draco gasps.
He can't say it. So he pulls out gold fabric, instead.
"Go home, Mr. Malfoy," Potter says at last, and it deflates Draco like a needle to a balloon. "Finish your leave."
But Draco is too slow. The spell is already beginning spark at the end of Potter's wand, and Draco has yet to spring to action, rooted to the tile with panic. Williamson roars again, and does the work himself, bundling Dendron out of the room so quickly that by the time the scarlet bolt fires, Draco is the only person in the room with Potter.
"Aren't you a terror," Draco mutters, dropping owl treats on the floor rather than put his hand nearer the tiny owl than necessary. The owl scampers across the floor, gobbling them up with gusto as Draco opens the letter.
"There was a reason she reacted so exceptionally to you but ignored me, I know it," Draco insists. "Give me this."
"I'll get it," Hermione's voice says, and Draco can
"Soul-baring is what you do when you're drunk," Harry says, holding up his hand to count poorly on it again. "I had, uh—"
Malfoy frowns, looking out into the trees as he crosses his arms and drums his fingers on his bicep. "What did you want to get away from, Potter?"
"Then you'll understand,
Draco spills a bit of boiling water over the side of his cup.
Within a few angry strides Griselda is upon Draco, hauling him up by the collar and jamming the point of her wand into his throat. "And you're not going to fucking stop me, of
anything, I—"
"I would say we're in strange times," Weasley says, "but we've lived through stranger, haven't we, mate?" And his eyes crinkle as he spares a smile for Draco. Draco swallows painfully.
want?"
Draco grumbles wordlessly, wriggling a big to burrow deeper into the tacky armchair. "What is this, another jab at my emotional honesty?" But she doesn't answer, spotting his deflection easily.
Potter stands in the center of the sitting room, his mockup linen suit nearly a perfect fit. Draco is a master draftsman, after all, venturing into the unknown waters of dressing a fat body with all the skill he can muster. Where all Potter's own clothes—lumpen, stretched out, pilled, faded—made him shapeless, made him look like he was falling into himself, the linen suit makes him look sleek without being dishonest about his size. Potter even seems to stand straighter. Draco thinks he looks a touch powerful, actually.
"If you want to wear trousers in front of the other Gala guests, I'm going to have to measure the area trousers usually cover, and that includes between your accursed legs, is that a little clearer?"
"I said I
Well, anything else he wants is unethical to think about, because Harry is a paying client. Potter, properly.
"Hey!" Harry sits up, and Draco juts his chin at him, glaring.
"With considerably less mess," Malfoy asserts, accepting the chalice of stupidity from Harry. He plants his mouth on the opposite side of the rim, which looks like it's pushing his jaw into his neck, and takes several hard gulps of his own. "See? I—"
Draco writes, near the croquis' head—but below, a wide cutout plunges all the way to the waist seam, exposing the shallow cleft at Draco's sternum. The sleeves are enormous unlined bishop sleeves that Pansy will laugh at, because he can't help himself, with a moderate gather at the cap and mounds of fabric gathered into the cuff. The cuffs are tight and buttoned from wrist to mid-forearm, and he writes himself another note chastising himself for considering mother-of-pearl shank buttons again. He just likes them so much.
Draco starts pasting photos in, scribbling around them with a self-inking quill as he goes to note dates, places, commentary on how the weather had been scorching or how Harry had just bought this particular shirt only to sacrifice it to his inability to eat neatly at an Italian restaurant. Draco peppers in, whenever he really feels it, how proud he is of Harry, and of their relationship, and how in love he is. And because he feels it near-constantly, even with Harry's recent rejection, he writes it all over the photo album.
"Molly and Arthur miss him so dreadfully."
"No, as Molly told me, you said now wasn't the bloody time for more of his Malfoy obsession, then later on told him you couldn't believe he'd brought Draco fucking Malfoy to the birth of your child."
Griselda bursts out laughing. "Harry, is it? Are you on a first name basis with the Savior? You, son of Useless Malfoy? Oh, that’s funny." She shakes her head, still chuckling. "Do you think he might come find you? I hope so."
for Draco's answer, as if Draco would ever say no.
"I could ask you the same," Malfoy retorts, puffing out his chicken chest as he puts his haughty nose in the air. "Obsessed much, Potter? It's been nearly a decade since school, you know. Pathetic."
"We'll get it," Harry tries to reassure him, but he doesn't sound too sure, himself. It's been days, and there've been no breakthroughs on how to manipulate the Trace to transcend its usual surface touch—Harry made mention of getting dinged by the Ministry, just before second year, for a spell cast by Lucius's errant house elf. Working with the Trace as a base spell is working with a flawed foundation, but especially without a wand, Draco can see no other avenue for it.
"I don't understand." Draco puts his fingers to his throbbing temples. "It's a robe. How can you find this—this deeper meaning in—"
There is absolutely nothing untoward about it, as it turns out. A standard legal document that looks like it was copied from a Ministry file, guaranteeing Mr. Draco Lucius Malfoy and Atelier Malfoy's promise of client confidentiality as pertains to the transaction between one Mr. Harry James Potter and Atelier Malfoy, blah blah blah. Yadda yadda, as Draco's favorite American client is wont to say.
people, Draco Malfoy!"
"If you're sure." There's a pause, filled with more of the crinkling. "You going somewhere?"
What he can do is garden. Even if Harry wishes Draco would blink out of existence, Draco's plants still need him. Summer is in full swing, and there's plenty more to harvest and tend to. Between the cucumber vines and radish leaves, the skin on his forearms has somehow been rubbed raw, even with gardening gloves on; the fairytale aubergines are much easier by comparison. Maisie is doing well, but she needs pruning as she grows. There's a moment, as Draco looks out across all the work he's set himself, where he realizes he doesn't remember how many times he's expanded the back yard; it feels less like a garden and more like a field. He's certainly going to have to give most of his harvest away, probably mostly to Molly.
Potter. Overheating Potter. He can practically hear Pansy tutting in his head, and he asks himself again why he doesn't just go and get more friends.
"No, I'm afraid I don't know," Draco says, a little too quickly. "Fashion rots your brain, it's a known phenomenon."
"Oh please," Malfoy says, and doesn't answer the question. "Don't make me beg for your assistance, Potter."
"And what do you know about what she's like?" The clank of the kettle onto the range is louder than it should be, and Draco twists in his seat to see Harry bristling at the stove.
Draco holds up his free hand, just as Hermione twigs to his occupied one. "I am but the exquisitely dressed chauffeur. Fret not, I bring someone you'd much rather see."
And then six months are up. Any day, now, Draco will hear the creak of the gate that needs oiling, and Harry will be coming down the cottage path, looking exhausted but happy to be home. Draco will pretend Harry's only been gone a day, stand steadfastly ignoring him—oh, who is he kidding? He'll fly down the path, and collide with Harry so hard that Harry will have to pick him up,
"I'm being emotionally sensitive to others, leave me alone," Draco scowls. "Are you coming or not?"
Much the same way Draco already feels Harry's absence from his own life, just three days in.
"Soon," Draco assures her. The chair is high backed, winged; in shape, it's something that might have fit into the manor, but there its sympathies with pure blood style end. The flowers on its rough-woven surface are endearingly hideous and busy, and its clawed wooden feet end not in the traditional dragon claws but in rats' paws. As a child, he would have sneered at it, just as his mother would have taught him; as an adult he finds it delightfully stupid and teeters every day on the edge of asking to buy it. The idea of Lucius Malfoy seeing a rat-pawed armchair teeming with daisies and other low class flora in the ancestral home—
"It's been a few weeks," Harry says, "since my last visit. Draco, look at me." And though it hurts to tear his eyes away from the wasteland that is his garden, Draco obeys.
Harry frowns. "No? No, my robes are fine. Draco—"
Draco's heart twists in his chest. "And how does Harry... feel?"
It doesn't land, though. Potter's tiny smile fades, replaced with an exhaustion that seems to wash over him until he's underwater. "I'm sorry. I'll go." And he begins to turn.
"I, er—hullo, Ginny," Harry says, a hand to the back of his neck. "I made it! Look at that."
"Fuck the wizarding world!" Griselda shouts, rounding on Draco with her wand held up, and she radiates so much aggressive magic he feels it pressing him to the wall. "Everyone's going to die! Then there'll be no more caring about who's a Pureblood, who's not, who followed
Dr. Fiddlewood taps her pen against her notepad twice. "Is that what I asked?"
He feels stiff, and stupid, being eyed in much the same way Hugo had just done by Granger. Or Granger-Weasley, perhaps, or perhaps she's given up her maiden name to become yet another Weasley. He realizes Harry hadn't told him that, or any other detail in the same vein; Harry's friends in a recent context never came up much, when they talked. Draco clears his throat. "May I come inside?"
"I'm sorry," Harry says, and he puts his hand on the door knob of the back door. "I'm going to go now."
The disdain on Potter's face fades into confusion. "It's my house. It's alright."
Pansy, Blaise and Greg come as one to see Draco in hospital, and all three are delightfully awful in their own way. Greg apparently tried to bring Draco some of his first batch of homebrew, to which St. Mungo's staff put a very firm stop. Blaise says Draco looks awful and showers him with some of the luxury items companies have already paid for Blaise to wear, telling Draco these will help. And Pansy—
His contemporary's fear pissed Tom off greatly so much that he lost his sangfroid and turned to lambast the child, for being so weak-willed and moronic, when he stopped. When he turned his head quickly, something shiny winked at him from the corner. Suddenly the promise of treasure was greater than his bloodlust and Tom ventured towards a ravine, despite his companions' protests.
She froze at the sight of the deadly weapons. She didn’t attempt to conceal the look of horror on her face as her eyes scanned the three wizards’ blood-soaked bodies, looking like they got out of a bloodbath with all their clothes on. Her hung mouth widened as her eyes drifted over to the blood splattered walls, the blood drenched floors or the towering pile of blood and gore standing in the corner.
She uncorked a bottle of rum and filled her teacup. Then she shook the bottle at him invitingly.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, was murdered by Death Eaters.
"Right?" Ariel agreed. "But yeah, anyway, I walked in, grabbed Lucy over here, and then I was out like the wind." She one-shoulder shrugged the ending, like what she did was as commonplace as closing a door.
"Lord Avortement," added Attina.
“Here,” said a voice.
"Yes!"
By daybreak, Malfoy Manor was flooded with the blood and gore of giants. So much, Nagini swam in it, her long sinewy body zigzagged in ankle deep blood, her mouth unhinged, guzzling it down like water. In Voldemort’s mind, this was the sign of another successful day.
"Be safe." He echoed with a snort. Ariel had stepped into the circle when he grabbed her by the arm, raised it triumphantly, and decried to the near-empty beach, "As if anything in this realm could stand a chance against us!"
The news of her death came in the form of no news. After that day, she was never mentioned again by the Dark Lord as if she had never existed to begin with.
Bellatrix nodded. "It's true. I used to go whole days without being checked on by a guard."
Voldemort's eyes squinted slightly as if confused. "You... didn't make any...life-changing decisions over the holidays?"
"If you two keep making us cry, this lagoon is going to turn into an ocean," said Aquatta wryly as she used a knuckle to dry a tear.
"You can't intrude if you're being invited." She replied, taking a half step towards him, wearing the sweetest smile. "Besides, I'm sure my sisters would love to meet their nephew."
"I thought I made it painfully clear by now that I do." He replied, annoyed.
"I love it," she confessed, tracing the shape of his ear with her index finger like old times. "I love clingy."
"Leave the boy alone," Ariel said, listlessly. "You know, I had a marble statue of my crush in my treasure room when I was his age."
"I swear." He said, half-pleading. After a short beat, he insisted, "Go on. Ask me anything."
"I'm just looking for a book I lent Severus a while back." He said with a light almost nervous laugh as he slowly stood to greet her. "Going to catch up on some light reading finally."
"Any new developments with my soon-to-be assassin?"
Ariel cut the murderous wizard a sideways glance. How was this wizard before her, this hideous noseless creature who was practically begging her to love him, be the cruel, soulless Lord Voldemort? How could this be the same wizard she had spent so many years appalled by tales of his never-ending evil? "Well, I don't know…If we do make this a weekly thing, are you going to be on your best behavior?" Her voice turned serious when she added, "Or am I going to see things I wish I hadn't?"
"When am I ever anything less than polite and well-behaved around you?" said Tom with a mawkish smile.
And so Nagini maneuvered her twelve-foot-swamp-water-and-oil-colored body out of its loose coil and headed off to do what she damn well wanted.
He let out a cold laugh them turned his head at Ariel and said, vindictively, "Good." Then he pushed himself from the bed and stride out of the room, demanding, "Make sure she's transported to the safe house."
"Oh. Good then." Voldemort said, his voice back easing back to its normal octave. "This actually makes the next topic I have to talk to you about much easier. At some point before, during, or after you…ugh…go to town on each other, I need you to convince her to help me kill Harry Potter."
"I do but she's such a snot most of the time."
Ariel dumped her drink into the sink, then poured the rest of the sleeping draught spiked rum down the drain as well. Then she turned to her drooling monster.
"Excellent," Voldemort said, mollified. "Well, if that's that, then the only thing left then for this meeting is for everyone to get up and pay respects to our honorable guest." Voldemort decided while he pulled a chair from the wall and created a new space for himself beside Ariel at the head of the table. When a stunned silence kept the Death Eaters from moving fast enough to his liking, he shouted, "Now!"
"Aw, Belize! Good times..."
"Whatever you've read, it's all lies!" Adella interjected causing all of them to laugh.
He was stunned to find the downstairs bloodless but relieved to hear humming instead of screaming. Ariel was on the couch with Nagini, stroking the venomous snake's long body while it slithered triumphantly along the back of the couch.
Tom beamed at her but the smile was short-lived as he heard one of the workers from the orphanage scream his name. Tom looked over his shoulder to say goodbye but only caught the sight of Ariel's tail slapping against the water as she vanished with a swan dive.
"It's true. I wasn't going to kill him." He said with a voice strained with shame. He knew what he was admitting.
"Oh, that reminds me," Voldemort said abruptly, taking a stand for the first time since the ass-kissing began. "I must borrow you for a moment, Severus." To Ariel, he explained, "It's Nagini's feeding time and I promised Severus last time he could feed her."
“I told you I had a meeting today,” he said.
"Well," Voldemort said through a clenched, toothy smile despite the seething rage that embroiled his insides. He despised Narcissa so fiercely in that moment. How profoundly he wanted to make an example out of her by turning her husband into a widower. Or go really overboard and turn Draco into an orphan. Delicious, violent images swirled in the back of his mind. His wand burned eagerly against his thigh. But he remained still, smiling, listening calmly to Ariel as she told her prison break tale. Because if he gave in to the temptation, he realized to his chagrin, Ariel would freak out. Look how terrified she was when she first arrived this morning. Remember the sickness in her face when you told her who you are? She's terrified you. And, who could blame her? But if he wanted her back in his life—which of course I want her in back in my life—who wouldn't want a relationship with the closest thing they've ever had to a—he berated himself into not finishing that thought. Look at you. Little Tommy wants a mommy…So, what if I do? Greyback may be a moron but he wasn't wrong when he said we all have our weaknesses. Stupid, loveless childhood. This would be so much simpler if I didn't have that fragment of a soul left. Once she finished her story, he cleared his throat once, turned his attention away from Ariel, and told the terrified three, with forced placidity, "That's all I wanted to know."
Snape shot him a piercing glare then after a few minutes of seething informed, "He doesn't speak to me. And he hasn't for months."
"Oh, yeah," Ariel said as she pushed herself to her feet. She walked over to Bellatrix to refill her cup, saying as the witch poured the bottle, "I actually had to help break out the same friend." She laughed when she raised the cup to her purpled lips and explained, "He got caught summoning the Kraken. Again." She shook her head after she took her sip. "I told that idiot not to but you know how hard-headed pirates can be."
"Shit," Snape hissed as he threw his pants back on.
Snape took his potion and watched the midnight saturated window as he transformed into another Ariel.
Voldemort gave her an amused chuckle. "Fair enough. And what happened after that?"
"That's very kind of you," Narcissa replied with a small bow before she took the empty chair across from her. Ariel lifted the tea kettle but Narcissa declined with a small shake of her head. "Thank you but I'm not much of a tea person."
"You look terrified," He observed as he drew the cup to his curled lipless mouth.
"I love you too, you little shit," Snape said softly as he closed the door.
The room was silent except for the sounds of cooking. Soon, pleasant smells filled the air, teasing the starving young man who felt dizzy waiting for the meal to be done.
Snape clinked his glass into Draco’s and said with an impassive face and wet eyes, “To Ariel, may she rest in power.” With that, the two of them took a giant swig from their glass and lapsed back into unbearable silence.
So what?! You have to be a morally reprehensible person to be liked by the darkest wizard to ever live!
"It's a song a family friend made up a long time ago. I don't know the name."
Ariel was alone, in the living room, with the newest issue of Potions Heads Monthly when a soft sibilant sound pulled her nose out of the magazine. She looked up and found Nagini floating above her head, staring at her with unblinking black eyes, her little black tongue poking at her, hissing away as if saying, you smell good enough to taste. But Ariel didn't flinch or scream or was startled in any way to see that man-eating cobra instead she gave the fearsome beast a small smile then reached up and gave its chin an affectionate scratch.
She expected pain. Instead, she was met with the sounds of rumbles as the world violently shook. She opened her eyes in alarm expecting the earth to collapse underneath her and swallow her whole. But it didn't though.
"For fucks sake, and you did that to yourself seven times?"
At some point, Ariel blacked out and came back to in an opulent goth kitchen she'd never seen before. She was sitting alone at a long, sleek, black table. A stray ray of sunlight broke through a nearby window and caressed her back of her neck. For a split second, everything felt so serene and surreal, as if she had just awakened, safe and sound, after a horrible dream.
Ariel let out a sigh of incredulity. "This—you—" She pulled her gaze away from the undead and looked at him with genuine absorption. "Wow. You really have your own undead army." She looked back at the zombies and said in soft awe, "Holy shit..."
But Voldemort raised his non-wand-wielding hand to the group and everyone shut up immediately and he continued, "No, it's true. This ambush that left us five men short was, in fact, my fault. After all, neither Rudolfo, Yemo, nor the Beckles triplets would have known better had I been a little more…open about my childhood."
The young man disappeared in a red flash and the curse shot into the mouth of the cave-like a ballistic, colliding into the cave with a thunderous BOOM. Rock fragments rained down onto the remaining Toms but Voldemort cast a shielding spell above his head and the fragments dissolved into dust. Once the dust settled, Voldemort told the invisible child, "Don't listen to him. He doesn't know jack shit."
Tom stopped studying his reflection in the glass-like waters in order to lift his head and watch Ariel as she addressed her sisters. She pivoted herself so that she could switch her gaze between her sisters and him as she announced, "Sissies…I would like you to meet someone. His name's Tom and…he's…my son. I, uh, fostered him when he was a kid and when I came to land, we reunited and—decided to make it official."
"Wow," Tom blurted out, impressed but sick with jealousy. He read in a magazine recently that the average age for most people nowadays was a paltry 58. "I hope I live that long."
"Better. Especially now that we have a wedding to look forward to."
"I'll make the meeting for tomorrow," he informed her.
"Blessing?" He said with a cold laugh. "You don't need my blessing," he said with an irritable hiss. All docility disappeared in an instant from his face. He was like a garter snake that turned into a rattlesnake ready to strike "This isn't the Muggle world Severus. Should she marry you that's her prerogative. And should she marry you I will support her decision entirely and be giddy as a fucking puppy for her because I think Ariel deserves to be happy. But should she refuse your proposal and or dump your ass because you know, she's a masterpiece and you're a pale greasy old shoe smelling atrocity, or worse, because you mistreated her in some way, my prerogative will be to saw off your head and skullfuck—"
"Ariel, I lied the other night when I said you were my hero." He said, drawing closer to her as her bottom lip trembled and her eyes brimmed with tears. "Because the truth is, whenever I thought of you over the years, it wasn't hero-worship. Whenever I thought of you, I would think about how…" He caressed her wet face with one hand without her flinching. "I would've given anything to be your son. To be your real son."
Narcissa smiled into her cup but Ariel noticed when she raised the cup to her lips her eyes creased with quiet despair.
"What?"
"So…Did you want me to eat your corpse afterward?"
"Mom…" Voldemort said, his voice as gentle as the wind. "I'd like you to meet…" He gestured to Ariel with an open, flat palm and said something he wanted to say for decades, "Mom."
Harry scoffed at him in mock disgust. "It's like I don't even know you."
Ariel arrived into Diagon Alley in a swoosh of smoke only to find the shopping promenade was nearly empty. Shops stood in unlit clusters of failure and hard times. There were fewer shoppers. Anybody who walked by her kept their heads down and their feet hurried.
"He'll see right through that. Besides, I loathe how much we use her already. Heavens forbid if that deranged man—" His sentence ended in a fury of sputters and dreaded silence. His hopeless silence thickened the air which Dumbledore broke with his light airy voice, "She's doing enough for us. Besides I'm sure Mr Malfoy will make himself known in one way or another. Maybe if I'll luck out and he'll kill me with kindness."
"For now." He could fall asleep this way.
"Malfoy," Potter says, "you're still on bereavement leave for another few days—"
"It's not a tiara!" Draco all but screeches, headpiece in hand. "It's a halo, lovingly crafted by Pansy for
"You called him Harry," Granger says, softly.
"Oh." Malfoy's face is blank for only a moment, before it begins to curl with a devious smirk. "Why, Potter! Do you have a picnic blanket secreted away somewhere already?"
Her beauty made his stomach stir but her nakedness burned him to the core. He had to keep his eyes on the placid lake or else he would embarrass himself, and her, with an erection even he couldn't control.
