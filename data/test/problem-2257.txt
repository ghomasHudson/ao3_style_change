kid. Harry realised he didn’t have a script for this. His happy adult Harry self didn’t go to zoos and act silly and just have fun. It was exhilarating.
will leave, because Harry is Good and Draco is Bad. He doesn't realise that Harry doesn't want Good. Harry wants Real, and Harry wants people who stick around.
Harry hadn't really considered the amount of hypothetical debate that happens when Hermione and Draco are together, the arguments conducted in which each of them are arguing a position they don't believe in. It can be a bit exhausting, actually.
Harry turned, Draco following closely, and Rump started talking, trying to get in the last word, but Harry walked swiftly out of the office, not slowing until he was out of the entire department. Out of breath, he paused, then felt Draco's hand on his shoulder, nudging him forward. Harry, ears ringing, allowed himself to be steered, overcome with anger and annoyance and absolute disgust that people had
"No!" Harry said. "Sorry. Well, I don't know. It would certainly put your opposition to Rump at the forefront of people's minds, which seems like it's probably a good thing when the election comes?"
," she corrects. She pulls away and looks around, worrying her lip between her teeth. "Our flat—it's not like when we were living in the tent, is it?"
If Harry wasn't wrong, Malfoy's cheeks reddened, and he quickly took a sip of his drink, obscuring his face.
Once they're on the ground in front of our feet, I glance at Potter. He's frowning. "This is such a bad idea."
Harry waved his hand. "It's fine. I don't mind. I've put my life on the line before, doing it with my career is no big deal."
But he couldn't say it to Harry. It was too much. It was too hard; he was eleven years old again, thinking he'd concocted a master plan to get Harry caught in the corridor after dark, but in the end forced to serve detention himself.
"You love those books too," Draco defended, trying to keep his voice level despite Harry's best attempts to wreck his composure. "And no one's ever been fucked in my office."
Harry slanted a glance at Draco, but Draco was looking ahead. "Yeah, we probably do. But that's only because we're still good friends. There was no way she'd ever not feel like family, you know? What with the Weasleys being my surrogate family. It's a bit like we're siblings and friends, now, but with the added history of a shared life." He shrugged. "But oh—you should've seen us at our worst."
Harry pushes off the sofa and makes to climb into Draco’s lap, but Draco holds a hand out and pushes him away. “I am not letting you on my lap like that. You’re making me feel like a lecherous old man.”
child—was lecturing him about having become boring by giving up his hobbies and focusing too much on his family? Harry had half a mind to tell Albus that
Where is he? Harry has Malfoy's new mobile number in his phone, but he doesn't really want to call him.
Hermione is on the sofa behind an intimidating stack of case law textbooks, and Ron is sitting next to her watching telly and trying to get her to take a break whenever she emerges from a book. She'd instructed him earlier to make sure she takes at least two breaks before dinner, and Harry thinks Ron is doing an admirable job. He finds their relationship a bit strange, but he supposes that's not bad.
Molly's face turns from confused to concerned. "Was it a bad trial today, dear? Who was it—the young Malfoy, right?"
Draco's office was in the building next to Gringotts, and usually he loved the location, being surrounded by the happy hubbub of Diagon Alley: peddlers of magic, children entranced by charms, wix in colourful robes striding into the bank to conduct financial transactions. It reminded Draco of his childhood, of the way he had once thought adult life would be.
Draco's expression slowly settles into smugness. "In that case, let's try out those condoms. I have no idea how they work. Are they electric?"
As Harry waited for his vanilla latte, he thought about Malfoy, wandering around Gringotts, no one to talk to but a bunch of goblins, saddled with extra work while Bill was on parental leave.
"Does it really matter?" Draco asked, turning to look at Harry, squeezing one eye shut against the glare.
"Between you and your Mum, you did for sure," Harry said, lost in a haze of memory. It was strange—being here again, in a different role. It was exciting, but in a way where he wasn't sure exactly
When Harry completed his spin, Draco's eyes snapped away from Harry's shorts. "The shorts are, of course, spectacular. I did an incredible job."
Harry and Ron glanced at each other, uncertain. It somehow seemed like anything they could say would be the wrong thing.
"Well, we can do that tomorrow, after lunch, if you want. I think they'd have a disco ball at that market we went to last weekend, remember?"
"My job is general curse breaking, so I deal with whatever comes up," Malfoy said, "but my favourite is sentient curses."
When Harry stepped away, Draco's face was unreadable. "You're very welcome. Now everyone hurry up or we'll miss it."
There she is—heading back into the crowd, a few feet to their right. "HERMIONE!" She doesn't hear. "
"Right," Harry says, distractedly pulling on his pants and trousers. He finishes dressing quickly, despite his continued drunkenness. Before he leaves, he turns and looks at Malfoy. "You're right—you're not dead. Try not to massively fuck it up this time, Malfoy."
When he gets home from class, he's not sure how to feel. Nervous? But he knows most of the people who are coming. The only people he doesn't know are Hermione's new law classmates, and whoever comes along as a guest.
"No, I have some of that cashew brioche. And before you complain, I also have the country sourdough you like from The Philosopher's Scone."
Lily slashed her wand with a determined expression and a pretzel nugget soared through the air towards her brother, but he dodged to the left at the last second and the nugget hit his nose.
"No, I am an idiot, because I am only ever this unhinged when it comes to you. And other crushes, I suppose."
"A suspicious drink?" Bill asked, laughing. "I didn't know there was such a thing as suspicious coffee."
Draco held up a hand. "I happen to be in possession of these items, which I am happy to offer you. Lorraine?"
It was all an act. It was an act, and yet somehow it felt better than Harry's last few relationships. When he'd been forced to answer questions about past relationships, Harry always felt awkward and like he was somehow letting people down, or like his relationship was going to be judged lacking, or like people would think him pathetic and incapable of love.
Malfoy was wearing a tailored set of business robes and looked like he was about to prance off to a corporate job where he would go about the daily grind of wringing every last Knut out of lowly peasants. He looked like the wizard equivalent of the man on the Monopoly box.
He probably should've got a smaller place years ago, but the truth was that any time he considered leaving it, he got sad.
Ginny fixes him with a look. "I'm better at charms than you, just give me a second." She rummages through a bunch of books piled on her floor, pulls one out, and starts flipping through. "If I'm pregnant, it'll turn blue." Her face takes on the concentrated look that Harry remembers from battle, and she waves her wand towards her stomach. A moment later, her midsection is engulfed in a shining blue haze.
Harry should laugh. Standing here staring at Draco was going to make it more awkward. He should lighten up the mood!
been holding up the queue, then stepped behind Blue-Lens. The queue was moving quickly, even if it was preposterously long. A moment later, Harry stood at the doorway, in the awkward position of being the one who had to hold the door open. He tried to hold it with his foot, but it slipped and hit him in the shoulder.
to belong there any more—why do you think I live in this Muggle flat? I don't belong here, but I don't want to belong where I do belong, so here I am. Faking it until I make it."
"That's not why I'm here, though," Draco announced. "Sorry, I got distracted. I wanted to talk to you about this legal action against Rump."
“Sometimes,” Harry said, “people tend to overlook things in the very beginning of a relationship. Or think the other person is funny for something that, later, they find annoying.”
Harry laughed and walked to face an open wall. When his chest was almost touching, he raised his palms to the wall and began moving them up and down, counting to thirty. When he finished that, he dropped to a forearm plank, which he held for about ten seconds before Draco started jeering.
Harry moaned as Draco dragged himself up, and then he took a breath and said roughly, "Pretty sure political corruption is the whole reason we're fucking right now, Draco. Don't knock it till you try it, and all. Oh
"How's it coming?" Harry asked Draco. Then he turned to Aster and said, "Yes!" He booped her nose. "Let's ask Poppop how it's coming!"
When they returned, Ginny and Astoria were alone—Ginny looking nervous, Astoria stiff, as they stared at the closed door.
There was something pained on Draco's face. "I don't want to be another thing that forces you into a life you don't want."
The minutes fade in a haze of dancing; "Tubthumping" comes on, and Hermione starts punching the air while screaming, "I get knocked down, but I get up again!" Harry laughs, happy to lose his worries to this sight, wishing Ron were here. Someone bumps up against Malfoy and suddenly Malfoy is pressed up against Harry's back while Harry sings, "Pissing the night awayyyyyy!" That's weird, and Harry isn't sure if maybe he should turn around, but then their faces would be very close together, so maybe this is better.
“Alright,” Harry agreed, heading in that direction. “I expect the zoo staff is happy I won’t be visiting the Reptile House. When I was a child, I caused a bit of an incident at the Reptile House at the zoo in Surrey.”
pretending!" Harry said, finally having quelled his laughter. "That's what you told me. That we weren't pretending to be family, because we
“It was a heartbreaking story of growing up,” she said, pulling one leg up under her bottom, raising herself up in both intensity and height. “There’s this doll, Jessie, and she is now a collector’s item, and Woody thinks Jessie doesn’t understand what it’s like to lose a friend, but then Jessie tells him her backstory, because she does understand! And turns out Jessie used to belong to a little girl but the little girl forgot about Jessie as she grew up, and Jessie got kicked under the bed and eventually tossed into a box of free stuff that was left on the side of the road, Harry. Don’t you see? She understands. Because she’s experienced loss, too.”
Lily launched into a discussion of something she was calling "genderfuck black tie" wedding outfits that she and Teddy could wear, and Harry let it all wash over him, trying not to get too invested in these little details of their sham relationship. He smiled, because he loved watching his kids excited like this, but he couldn't help but wonder what they'd say if they knew the truth.
. I haven't been trying to be married to you. My memory of being married to Astoria was constantly feeling like there were these things I was expected to do, ways I was supposed to be, and I resented it. And I haven't been thinking of us that way."
to Draco Malfoy. It's not like Malfoy is even that good-looking. He's skinny, and his chin is too pointy, and his complexion is so pale you can see his veins. But, frustratingly, Malfoy somehow makes this work, and Harry finds himself very turned on. Or maybe it's the booze. Or maybe it's the thrill of it being
Harry snorted. "Yeah, going on reality telly definitely sounds like something I would do." His phone buzzed and he glanced at it. Text from James: "Dad, are you fucking kidding me? This is the 'planned leak' you warned me was coming? Are you out of your mind? Is this just what happens when you date someone in politics? What the actual fuck! Are you ok? You usually hate this kind of attention."
He knew that he was about to face Goldie Masters, protegee of Rita Skeeter. What a load of bollocks.
became Minister. A counting error in the election returns, the Vow killing him on the spot, a freak heart attack—something.
Lavender and Parvati spin past, knocking into Harry's shoulder. They're doing some kind of involved dance, laughing and spinning. "Sorry Harry! Sorry Draco!"
Harry snorted. “Do you think I’m wrong?” he asked, head still resting in the hand propped up by his elbow.
Harry couldn't have stopped the loud snort from escaping his nasal passages if he had sealed off his nostrils with a Sticking Charm.
Hermione heaves a dramatic sigh. "Alright, I'm going to have to pick Malfoy up at a bar for a one-night stand." She cuddles closer to Harry. "Don't tell Ron."
of a shoe hitting the wall. He's the bounce of the bed as they fall. He's the squeeze of strong, untentative fingers around his cock.
At 11:50, the wooden lumberjack in the cuckoo clock on Harry's office wall popped out of his little door and announced, "Lunch with Draco Malfoy in ten minutes. Approximate travel time assuming Apparition and walking to and from the Apparition points, eight minutes." He swung his axe at a little wooden tree. The axe never felled the tree. Harry wondered if Wilhelm felt like Sisyphus, always swinging, never felling. Fucking hell, Harry's moroseness had extended to existential questions about a clock.
The news had been some sort of compromise about werewolf rights; some families who’d been harmed by werewolves under Death Eater control had sued the Ministry, bringing the case all the way up to the Wizengamot. Harry had been hoping for a ruling unambiguously supportive of werewolf rights that also addressed the harm the family had experienced. Instead, the Wizengamot had voted to curtail certain rights of free movement for werewolves and had terminated the werewolf liaison position to the Wizengamot. Harry felt sick about the whole thing. He hadn’t fought a war for
Harry gapes. He is living! He's doing his best, isn't he? He's allowed to care about the thing with Ginny and the baby. He's allowed to care about having lost nearly everyone in the world he ever cared about.
Was Draco actually arguing about whether their hypothetically in-love selves would hook up in the Ministry? Or was this all an act to convince the kids?
Ginny stared at Albus assessingly, reminding Harry of the way she used to inspect the kids for signs of illness when they were little. "Hazza," she said, "I think we need some sugar. Go find us some sweets?"
Wilhelm was friendly with many of the magical objects in the building. He couldn't see anything except in this office (he couldn't travel the way portrait subjects could), but he could chat with other sentient objects in the building. He got the best gossip from the Head Unspeakable's charmed stapler. Harry'd never been clear on how the objects communicated; he wasn't sure anyone knew. In fact, he suspected that many of them had no idea what a security risk it was. Wizards never seemed to think through the wisdom of charming sentience into thousands of objects and then leaving them around a building like this. Mortimer Vance's stapler had loose lips; but Harry trusted Wilhelm with national security, and with, indeed, his own life.
Harry didn't want to get in a fight with Albus, and tried to think of what he could say. To his surprise, Draco spoke up.
Aster sat, reaching up with pudgy arms. In one hand was Harry's barmy wooden clock man. The one that had perved on them that one time. Draco hadn't seen it in ages.
Draco's face twisted into pitying derision. "Kneazles often live well into their thirties, Potter. If you're going to use facts to try to make me look like an idiot, you should keep in mind that I am a solicitor and a
"Everything bothers me," Harry says. Then, "No. It doesn't bother me." Harry's hands find Draco's face, and he kisses him. He's kissed Draco dozens of times by now, but this is the first time it's felt free, unburdened.
It was true—they knew they'd have to give an interview soon. Much of the public had been wrapped up by the star-crossed lovers angle and didn't seem inclined to rest until they had evidence that the couple was together and happy despite the odds. "It could work. Give the public the story they want and give a little fuck-you to Rump."
It's a coffee that reads your deepest java desires and transforms its taste into what you most crave!"
“It was like...you couldn’t stop daydreaming?” Harry ventured. “About all sorts of things? And you want to talk about it all, even if it’s completely unlikely?” It was a hard feeling to put into words.
have control of it. I think it's the Board of Governors. Possibly with the approval of one of the Ministry departments? I forget."
“Sleep. Hang out with Ron and Hermione, and some of the others. Go through the motions of going to class, eat junk food on the bed.”
Jorgen handed Harry a pile of papers. He frowned; what even were these? The date was 2015—more than twenty years ago. He flipped through, trying to figure out if it needed to be kept.
"What do you want from me, love?" Draco asked, rubbing his nose along the hardness at Harry's groin.
Hermione’s eyes sparkled. She did love a protest campaign. “Brilliant. Brilliant, Draco! Yes! And what’s better—we don’t even have to break the dress code. Not at first, at least.”
Draco rolled onto his back and pressed his palms against his eyes. “You didn’t know me after the war. My mother actually set a curse on me to stop me cursing. Fancy that, an anti-curse curse. The joke was on her, because I just kept my cuntmongering mouth shut—wouldn’t speak at all—until she relented.”
"Ugh," Harry groaned. "Fine. I can't believe I'm going to marry you. What a crock of shit." Draco's mouth split into a tentative smile that grew wider every second. "This is what the ancient philosophers meant when they said that duty comes before pleasure. Here, we need to drink more." Harry poured more whiskey in their glasses.
"We know," Hermione said, leaning forward, tone steady, "that your relationship is fake. That it's a political ploy." She, apparently, thought this was enough information, because she sat back and crossed her legs.
“I will never forgive you for that,” Draco said, hair a mess, cheeks pink, after they finally got outside. “I barely escaped with my life.” He rubbed his lip, then stuck his tongue out surreptitiously as if testing whether he tasted of tropical fruit.
"I could conquest some bread right now," Draco said, continuing his ministrations and letting the sight of contented Harry with snoozing, contented Aster swell his heart. "Hungry? Then you can tell me about your new anarchist ideals."
"Does that getup have any pockets?" Wilhelm asked, hinging forward at the hips for a better view of Harry's clothes. "I'd prefer a breast pocket, but I won't turn up my nose at a trouser."
Draco met Harry's eyes, and though he said nothing, Harry could see the understanding, the confirmation that this wasn't fake. Not all of it, anyway. But maybe that was the problem—that Harry knew parts of it were real, but he couldn't tell which parts weren't.
Harry, mouth full of toothpaste, waved his hand to turn off the radio. He couldn't listen to another minute. This would be a complete nightmare at the DMLE, of course—how would his MLEOs and Aurors deal with this? Harry certainly wouldn't be condoning the arrest of people whose only crimes were using foreign spells. Merlin, what a nightmare. He was going to have to write a DMLE policy directing his employees to turn a blind eye to harmless foreign spells, possibly by clarifying what was meant by "reasonable grounds for suspicion"—
As such, Harry hasn't really had cause to consider whether the garments are attractive. Turns out they kind of are? And why has Harry been able to completely ignore the fact that he and Malfoy had
Draco leans forward. "Listen, the baby is not you. You are not the baby. You're being ridiculous. I don't care about the baby."
I sigh, and it comes out sounding performative, over the top, even though I feel that sigh deep in my soul. "I didn't mean it like that. I'm here for the same reason, you realise. Only in my case, you're the house-elf and I'm the hero."
He's helpfully distracted by the appearance of an unreasonably blond head. Malfoy's coming around Piccadilly Circus wearing, of all things, a Tommy Hilfiger jumper.
Draco leaned forward and hissed, "I am allowed to want good things for people I care about. That doesn't make me a snob."
Except his children, of course. His children were the perfect exception to the lack of choice that had always defined the rest of Harry's life.
Draco frowned. "No, you're going to get super worked up by the sex scenes, aren't you? I think maybe you need to go back to your room to read this, Potter."
"But!" Harry dropped into the chair opposite Draco. "We've been members of the ICW since the sixteenth century!"
He tried to resume working on his policy paper, but he couldn't help watching the antics of the others. Draco couldn't find the news-hologram spell password. (There were different passwords for different broadcasts, so you could be sure your spell would bring up the right hologram. This had become necessary after people started accidentally projecting porn holograms into their sitting rooms.) Draco griped for a bit about not being able to easily find the password on the Prophet app, and Albus muttered to Scorpius that they would've come prepared if they'd known Draco didn't have it under control. Scorpius eventually found the password and they began the holographic broadcast after some of the (unpleasant) pleasantries had passed.
"Harry!" Hermione says, all smiles, as she jumps up. "This is my Aunt Peggy. Aunt Peggy, this is my best friend, Harry."
It's too hard to even think about, much less talk about it with Hermione. If Harry talks about it with Hermione, they'll both end up sobbing on the floor. If he's ever in the mood for sobbing on the floor, he'll tell her. He thinks she'd be a receptive audience for parents-don't-want-me angst, ever since she returned from Australia.
"Is that so?" Draco asks, his voice sounding posher than ever as he tries not to reveal his emotions.
"Happy Samhain!" Harry says, turning back to the spellbook in front of him. "We have the moss, the lavender, the pewter cauldron…"
"Scorpius?" Draco said, his voice becoming drawlier in a manner that Harry now knew revealed anxiety—something in Draco's subconscious apparently thought the pedigree might help any anxiety-inducing situation. To be fair, that was true most times—blast this unfair world.
career trying to weed out and deplatform these power-hungry bullies. And it's not like I thought I had some kind of 'legacy' in the DMLE and that my work will live on forever or something delusional like that. But it's been what,
"When we were here for Lily," Harry said, "I think we were in and out in six hours flat. She came in like a Gryffindor, that's for sure."
Harry couldn't help it—he laughed, a free, happy, warm-with-family laugh. It was all going to be alright, wasn't it?
Harry leaned forward, pressing a kiss to the side of Draco's mouth. "We're always going to be a little fucked up, though, aren't we. But we are getting better, slowly. Penelope will be thrilled that I actually want to do something."
"Draco Malfoy is speechless," Harry said, a grin sneaking onto his face despite his foul mood. "Well there's a first. Should I call Rita Skeeter, get this documented?"
Draco sighed in agreement, pinching his nose. "Yes. And Rump would find a way to make it seem like he was promoting you or something, to avoid public outcry."
"Aster!" Scorpius said, sticking his hands under the baby's armpits to steal her away from Draco. With no delay, she pressed her open mouth to his chin, smearing him with apple-scented drool. "My lovie! How are you today? I missed you so much!"
"Precisely." Draco paused. "We need to let those little hints slip even to our families, so they'll believe it too."
Harry sighed. He hated these sorts of decisions. “Is it possible to just secretly bankroll their salaries? Or is that, you know, illegal?”
“I expect they’ll break any day,” Harry said, grinning. “The Taboo has been triggered no fewer than ten thousand times each day this past week. Lily says she’s completely won over by the Arabic cleaning spell, by the way. She says she’ll never go back to Scourgify.”
"It looks a bit like Slughorn," Potter says, and I can't retain composure. I end up laughing so hard I have tears in my eyes, which actually helps a bit, because it's better not to look too closely at Radcliff Slughorn at this point in the process.
"I'd watch out if I were you," Draco said, his nails scratching a very unthreatening line down Harry's scalp, "because there are two semantic uses of 'to take care of' someone, and I might switch to the other."
Harry explained about his accidental magic accidentally setting a boa constrictor loose in the zoo and accidentally trapping his cousin behind the glass.
Every face in the vicinity swiveled to look at him and a person at the security desk rose from his seat.
Harry pressed a kiss to Draco's chest. "That too. First on my list is that you didn't warn me about Jasper Andersen's brother in
“Can you come up with an alternative thought?” Malfoy asked, his face breaking into an amused smirk.
And he also kind of looked like the cover of a smutty lumberjack romance novel. Except lumberjacks didn’t usually wear jewelry. It was a bit of an odd look, really.
"Draco, I was fucking joking. You can't have a crystal hammer and sickle. I know it's hard for you to remember, what with your being all…Malfoyish. But that would quite defeat the purpose."
Draco turned slowly to fix Harry with a glare. “Are you incapable of answering a question without snark?”
"Literally just fill the Atrium with canoodling couples," Harry said, a starry look in his eyes. "Just think of it."
He grabbed his wand off the side table and Summoned his phone. It had taken him awhile, after receiving the phone as a gift from James a decade or so ago ("Because
“I know you don’t want to,” she said, giving him a kind smile. “But do you think you could force yourself to go outside for five minutes every day, even if you don’t want to? Maybe drink more water.”
me, he simply has other people to hate more. I've been supplanted by a bunch of megalomaniacs who don't even
Malfoy looked like he’d just spotted an erumpent wearing a top hat tap dancing through the cafe. "Have coffee. With you. Now?"
Draco put the cheese on a board and went searching for a knife. He raised an eyebrow in Harry's direction. "Are you sure you won't end up martyring yourself? If Albus and Scorpius are Slytherin about it, they might manipulate your Saviour inclinations."
“You’re not fucking waiting in the corridor,” Draco says, grabbing Harry’s wrist and pulling them towards his quarters.
The door doesn't open. I hear someone utter the incantation to turn a wall transparent. I close my eyes, hoping against hope that the Dark Lord lowers the wards, casts Incarcerous at the rats, and Potter gets us the fuck out of here.
They’re a couple. And I’m not with Ginny anymore, you must have realised that. It was all over the fucking Prophet.”
Harry decides he can't cope with processing Malfoy's outfit, so they might as well go up the rocket escalator into SegaWorld. He stops, a thought occurring to him. "Have you ever ridden an escalator?"
Harry laughed, crossing his arms over his chest. "I've never felt as inept as I did when we brought James home. No wait, that's a lie. I definitely felt more inept during the war. Facing Voldemort as a teenager will do that to you."
Draco snaps his fingers up by his eyes. "Up here, neanderthal. I just want to be on the same page. You want to—to be with me, right? I don't care if we tell the public or whatever, but just, you want to be—a couple? There are no good words. But you, me—together. Exclusively. Friends, partners, boyfriends, lovers, et cetera?"
today. The public may never know that, because you did this strategically. But you were in control of everything that happened today. If he thinks he had any power in that interaction, he's delusional. Which, we know, he is."
Harry sighs and gestures for the book. "Give me the book. It's got to be about hunting or video games. Or gang violence, maybe."
“There are phases?” Ron asked, rubbing self consciously at his eyes, which still looked a bit smoky even though he’d spelled off the makeup.
"Who is she?!" Teddy repeated, laughing delightedly. He turned to the rest of the table. "James uses the cloak to show off to the ladies."
“Alright,” Draco’s voice said from behind the bench, sounding smug. “Close your eyes. Hold out your hands.”
Malfoy's shoulders relax when he realises Harry's joking. "Yes," he says seriously, "and the quail would try to convince me I'm not evil." He pauses. "It's like an advertisement for WETB."
"Don't say 'the ladies' like that, Teds," Lily said, wrinkling her nose. "It makes you sound like a douche."
Harry reached behind Draco to Vanish flour from the counter, but when he tried to pull away, he was stuck. "What the…"
"And what about non-binary magical people? And Squibs?" Scorpius seethed. "Of course he would just say 'witches and wizards'."
Harry stared at the notification for a long minute, reading it over. His brain wanted to short-circuit, but it couldn't really, because they had engineered this very outcome. Parvati had insisted that whatever they leaked needed to be 'scandalous.' They'd walked back her first draft a bit, added some flair of their own, but it was still—pretty extreme. The thought of the entire wizarding world reading it had Harry feeling very odd indeed.
"I'm also not certain whether rats engage in cannibalism." He says it back mocking my accent, and I would never admit it, but he does a fair job.
"Ah, yes. We couldn't possibly jeopardise that brilliant ruse." Draco smiles and gestures at the door. "After you."
just so. "I know you have always had to do everything yourself. I know people haven't taken care of you. Harry takes care of other people. But, believe it or not, it can go in the other direction. It is possible for care to flow
Harry sipped his coffee and let the happy warmth of Shell Cottage seep into his soul. Dominique finished nursing, and the sling immediately adjusted so that she sat upright, facing her mother, but she twisted her head around and reached for Harry. "Ga!"
"Everything's fine," Al said, sounding anything but. "She's in there with the midwife. A Healer has come to check on them a few times.
He didn't answer, but he flashed her a smile, hoping it didn't look as pinched as it felt, and right after he saw the flash of a camera, he disappeared into one of the lifts.
I roll my eyes and pick up one of the metal strips. My fingers tingle from the magic. I hold it like a wand and swish it through the air, attempting to cast a Lumos.
Harry raised his eyebrows. It was rare for Draco to turn household items into expletives. "What did he do now?"
"No offense, Draco, but having to pretend I'm in love when I'm actually not in love and am, instead, horrified about world politics definitely falls under the label of 'shit'."
Harry covered his face with his hands. He did know. He’d been Owled some very disturbing things over the years.
"Because I know that every time you've yelled at me, I've deserved it." Malfoy holds his finger up to quell the possibility of interruption. "Which isn't to say that I was in the wrong! You always deserved it, too."
Harry joined the queue and let the rich smell of coffee and the slightly bizarre atmosphere of the cafe wash over him. The music playing today sang, "I love coffee, I love tea, I love the java jive and it loves me." Wren stood at the counter taking the order of the person at the front of the queue.
Harry knew, without a doubt, that Hermione was right about his knees being more distracting than hers. One summer Witch Weekly had published a photo of him at the beach with a cover story about his “distinctive” knees.
Malfoy spun around to look at Harry and clamped his hand over his mouth. “Wha—I don’t—I never think like that. I can still think of about a million reasons why none of those things will ever happen.”
"I can't see us deciding to come clean on our own unless we were engaged and having a press release or something," Harry said, thinking. "But I am pretty impulsive, and I am known to rile you up, so I can also imagine us accidentally spilling the beans."
“I am wearing colourful socks,” Draco said triumphantly. “I’m pretty sure that was disallowed somewhere in here.”
Harry scooted back onto the sofa, tugging Draco on top of him, and maybe this was all he needed right now—to do something just because he wanted to. Because it felt good, because he liked being looked at the way Draco was looking at him, he liked being touched the way Draco was touching him, he liked having a partner when the partner was Draco. Draco's hands fumbled with Harry's jeans, Harry slipped his fingers under Draco's waistband. Because the rest of it all—the fucked up world outside their walls—could wait.
That was the thought that finally roused him from the bench, pushed him towards home. Harry didn't make Draco brave, but Harry made him feel like shit for being a coward. Sometimes that was enough.
Harry's eyes flitted towards Draco, and then he froze—shocked to see the ghost of tears in the corners of Draco's grey eyes.
Draco snorted inelegantly, rubbed his forehead with the back of his hand. "Sure. I'll be happy to squeeze you in, Mr Potter."
"Trying to," Harry replied, grinning. "Not sure if she can really take in the message while asleep."
, Draco said. "They'll thank me," he said. Harry couldn't help but think that Draco was probably right, though he was adamantly not involved, not wanting to risk Albus's wrath.
Draco raised one eyebrow. "Not personally," he said, drawing out the word. "But most people who are lucky enough to fall into bed with me report that the event is life-defining; now this momentous event has occurred, their life can finally begin. So it makes good sense you'd be feeling that way."
"Dad?" Albus wandered into the living room from their bedroom, bleary-eyed and tousle-haired. "What's wrong?" Scorpius followed behind him, pulling a t-shirt on as he came into view. Harry was sometimes still taken aback by the way Scorpius did and didn't resemble Draco—Scorpius looked like who Draco could've been, in another life. He looked like Draco without the imprint of fascist bigotry and torture.
Draco rolls his eyes. "Get some forks." He carries the takeaway into the sitting room. "Let's play Duck Hunt."
goes into effect today!" The man looked at the sign, then at Harry, then back at the sign—poor bloke clearly had no idea what to do. Harry was his boss. In fact, Harry was his boss's boss's boss.
Scorpius stepped into the room. He looked a bit off; Draco frowned. He could cheer up his son with baby hugs. "Scorpius! Bad day? Give us a hug!"
Draco stands, picks up his robes from the chair, and slips them on. "It's okay. It was perhaps presumptuous of me to think I could hang out here with you two."
He nodded, and as she shut the door, he winced at the fact that she would, almost definitely, put her career above any ethical qualms. He wondered if maybe he was the only person who wouldn't. And if that was so, did it make sense for him to go out in a firestorm? Should he be staying, since no one else would have the backbone to mitigate Rump's evildoing?
For a moment, Draco stared at him with a sort of twinkle in his eye. Then, abruptly, he stood, strode forward, grasped Harry's face between two hands, and kissed him briefly on the lips.
"I will not watch it." He pulls out his wand and waves it, and the room fills with the sounds of the Backstreet Boys. Not "Everybody", the dance to which they still haven't mastered, but "Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)".
Harry tipped his head back and laughed. "Alright, fine. We tell no one. I don't like it, though." He sighed. "But how are we going to convince these people who know us so well  that
She doesn't answer, and Harry eventually tears his eyes away from trying to find non-existent constellations on the ceiling. He wrinkles his nose in confusion; Ginny is poking one of her tits. "Um, Gin?"
"I—" Draco started, wincing when he realised how far back he needed to go to tell the story in a way that would make sense to their ears. To make them understand why asking Harry to pretend, why Harry agreeing to pretend, was based on years and years of working together, on years of co-parenting their attached children. How far back to make them understand?
“Er, right.” Harry realised that he was shirtless, and about to do shoulder exercises. In Draco Malfoy’s bedroom. Sweet Merlin. He laughed. “It’s not much to watch, I assure you.”
Harry smiles, reaching up to brush Draco's hair off his forehead. "I'd say, yes, you were there. But you were there, like, for a reason."
Harry woke the next morning surprised that he hadn’t had a Floo call from Hermione or an owl delivery of some kind of gender-bending outfit to wear to work. He tried not to think about Hermione and Draco’s new mission, but the truth was that Harry had more than a small crush on Draco, and it was hardest to ignore when Draco and Hermione were excited about something.
Harry frowned. He hoped Lily knew he didn't expect any so-called "accomplishments" from her. He reached across the table, tilting her face towards him. "Hey, what? Of course not! You've done so much, and even if you hadn't, who cares? You don't need to
“You know what?” Penelope interrupted, not willing to listen to Harry’s depressive political nihilism. “The problem is you two are lacking imagination. You’re stuck in a cycle of negativity and you have forgotten how to envision anything good happening.”
Draco walked in wearing a slim dress shirt and a pair of elegant trousers. He looked markedly more Muggle than usual—he often wore Muggle clothes for work, but at home he usually wore casual robes.
"Can we stop at the bookstore before we go back?" Draco asked, wincing as one of the boys fell and slid down the ramp on his bottom. "I know you wanted to look for that book on charming wood."
"Yes. And I don't want to get married under false pretenses, as if I hadn't enjoyed it. That seems dishonest, unethical, something. I don't know. So, there you have it: I liked it."
Harry's heart clenched, and he couldn't tell if it was in shame or in some kind of indescribable worry. "You're quite the romantic, aren't you?"
He's panicking a bit. He knows Hermione's being a big person about this whole Draco thing, but it's one thing to be okay with it hypothetically and quite another to witness them snogging on the kitchen floor.
“Oh stop,” Harry says. “You know I still think you’re fit. But we’re both kinda, you know. Saggy. Grandfathery.”
"Oh good, you're here, I—" Draco turned to look at him and abruptly stopped, his eyes dropping to Harry's bare legs.
"Yes, Potter," Malfoy announces, arranging his face into stoic determination. "Good grief. Let's go."
Harry reached into his bag and pulled out the parchment, handing it over at the same time as Malfoy. For the first time that day, they made eye contact. Harry wasn't sure what he'd expected to see there, but Malfoy just looked tired.
The Muggle Mediation Measures was a programme run by the ICW to prevent the worst effects of what Supreme Mugwump Geneviève Chéreau referred to as "Muggle mismanagement of the Earth." (Well, she called it "mauvaise gestion non magique de la terre," but the British had landed on 'Muggle mismanagement' and 'Muggle Mediation Measures,' because the Ministry loved alliteration when acronyms weren't to be had.) The Triple M was tedious, difficult-to-organise labour—magical people in every country and continent had to work together to try to stop ocean desalination, animal extinction, deforestation, and so on. And it was thankless work—the Muggles continued to ruin the planet, making the Triple M (which Ron insisted on referring to as "mmmmmmm") seem ineffective when it was actually working, only against impossible and ever growing odds. No one wanted to pay for it. And yet, it was important work. If Britain left…
Draco raised an eyebrow in his usual, teasing way, though he looked a bit taken aback. "Hah. Right. Well. We'll just, er." He pointed at the sitting room, and Harry laughed, unaccustomed to seeing Draco so wrong-footed.
Potter shrugs. "Sounds like the best plan we've got." We set to work, expanding the paper and changing the colour to match the stone wall. It's a fair approximation. It looks more like the wall than Wormtail's corpse looks like me, anyway.
"Your guess is as good as mine, Potter. I have no idea how house-elf magic works. I'm sure they can keep him out for a while, at least."
It was Lorraine's day off, so Harry was cooking one of his signature dishes—James's favourite, Shepherd's Pie. Draco, who, before Harry had moved in, used to have Lorraine leave food for him to heat up on her days off, stood uselessly against the counter, holding a bottle of Voss sparkling water that he'd bought when Harry took him food shopping.
Not even the energy-sapping fog of depression could steal the happiness of being alive from Harry these past months, and
"Sit up, Potter. Don't be dramatic," Draco said, then slumped gracefully into his hand. "The entire world is going up in flames. The LabMags haven't even figured out a way to deal with the ban on foreign magic yet, and now this."
When Harry wakes in Ron's lurid orange room a few days later, he picks up a stack of letters he's been ignoring and starts sorting through them. He has job offers from Puddlemere United (no), the Auror Academy (fuck no), and the Daily Prophet (fucking hell no). He has a letter from McGonagall telling him she's talked with her contacts at the Royal Academy of Magic, the small magical university in London, and has secured him a spot, despite his failure to sit his N.E.W.T.s. He has a letter from Florean Fortescue's daughter, asking if he's interested in investing in Fortescue's rebuilding effort.
Draco looked around the kitchen, wondering if he should throw something in for Aster. A banana. Perfect.
Draco sighed. "That's certainly true." He waved his wand and a desk appeared behind the sofa. "If you need to keep working."
I sigh. "Well, alright. There's only one Wormtail, though. I don't really fancy cutting the corpse in half first."
The Floo roared; Scorpius stepped through. "Dad. Thanks for the stuff, but how on earth do you use this thing?" He held up an inscrutable piece of fabric.
At this point I make the grave error of looking down at the corpse Potter is trying to bewitch into my likeness.
Harry poured the milk potion into a bottle and hit it with a warming charm. He tested the temperature with a mumbled, "
“Good grief, I should’ve worn a skirt years ago. The patriarchy would’ve been immediately clear, and I wouldn’t have had to do all that reading about feminism and miswitchgyny.”
"I'm serious!" she says, getting herself under control and bringing her feet up on the bed, legs bent. "I think there are exactly two people in the world who would tell you to get over yourself, and I'm one of them. Well, and Ginny. Three people."
"But right now, we need to exercise that imagination. Because we need something to aim for, don't we?"
“A splendid idea,” Draco agreed, standing. “I’m going to go show him around and see if he needs a Dreamless Sleep.”
Harry increases the rate of his stirring and layering of ingredients. Draco drops to the floor with a triumphant "Aha!" and manages to get his hand inside at floor level, grabbing Harry's ankle. He can't move his hand up or get any more of his body in, but he has a death grip on Harry's ankle.
"Oi!" Harry said, tempted to crumple a paper and throw it at the git's head. "What's the matter? Is something wrong with Albus? Or Scorpius?"
Harry's head swims, sloshes. A man walks by and catches his eye. He's tall, thin, wearing some kind of shirt made of leather straps. Harry can't help but stare, and then he turns back to Malfoy and says, "Have you ever kissed a bloke?"
By the time the weekend arrives, Harry is swamped with reading and wondering how he's going to make it through these courses. No, he's wondering
"Harry, trust me. I tried to turn down a vault when I turned 21. I told my parents that their prestige and money had ruined my life and I wanted nothing to do with their blood Galleons. It was a nightmare. A goblin followed me around for a month, and the vault key kept appearing, no matter how many times I returned it to Gringotts. One time it landed in my tea. Another time it whacked me in the head while I was in the middle of getting off with some bloke from the London School of Economics."
"Oh Merlin and Morgana," Draco said when he pulled away, eyes drawn in horror to Harry's apron, which had become visible when he turned away from the counter. "I've just noticed your apron."
Hermione starts to laugh, just a giggle at first and then harder and harder until she's heaving for breath.
Draco's eyes flew open. "What? No! They're fine. I think. I haven't spoken to them in a few days, have you?" He narrowed his eyes. "What aren't you telling me?"
"Muggles have a very limited understanding of what werewolves are," Hermione explains, out of breath, jumping to the right at least three beats too late. "They think it's mythical and treat it rather like a costume?"
The house was so loud that Harry had cast a charm at his ears to lower the decibel level. He'd learned that charm when he and Ron went to a RATM concert in 1999, but here he was using it in his own home.
The next morning he sent Draco a letter saying he wasn’t feeling well and couldn’t go to the skatepark.
Harry's eyes scanned the sign with the offerings, and when it was his turn he smiled at Wren and ordered a vanilla latte, then stepped next to Malfoy to wait for it.
"Oh, right," Draco said. "That is the entire point, rather. I want to run for Minister in the next election."
"And almost half of the people in this country approve of this clown," Harry said, shaking his head. "I can't…" He trailed off.
Albus nodded aggressively. "We know which spells on that list of Taboo spells probably wouldn't hold up as 'foreign' in the Wiz! You and Lily did all that research on spell etymology. If we use social media to tell people which spells to use, like civil disobedience, we can do direct action! Flood the Ministry with thousands of Taboo violations all at once—make their Taboo completely useless."
But today, he was annoyed; he wanted to get home. He wanted to rant and complain to Harry. Today the crowds of holiday shoppers in Diagon felt like an impediment rather than a joyful backdrop.
“The dress code said no visible knees,” Harry croaked out, staring at Draco’s knees. “I specifically remember something about knees.”
Harry pushed the sleeve of his Auror robe up to glance at his watch. He'd be late for work if he didn't hurry up.
The rat runs by, and I swear it's giving me a look. I turn my back on it. "Why the fuck was Dumbledore giving magic the form of a chain?"
Draco continued speaking without acknowledging Harry. "Taking someone home will be…difficult. Certainly risky."
"Sorry, I can't help myself." Draco selected a carrot slice. "I heard from our solicitor, Angus Heartvine."
"Er," Harry said, picking up his cup and taking a sip. He closed his eyes, letting himself get momentarily distracted by the way the chocolatey bitterness of the coffee contrasted with the sweetness of the whipped cream. "At work? Which is what we're talking about. I get off on catching bad guys."
The door to the bedroom—which had already been open—flew open farther still, hitting the wall with force. It didn't bounce back, though, just stayed open against the wall—Draco must've slammed it open with magic.
"It's not polite to make fun of a lack of musical ability," Draco insisted from somewhere behind him. "Madame Toussaint did try."
Draco blinked, stoically looking away from Harry's legs. He seemed to visibly gather his equanimity, and when he met Harry's eyes, all traces of fluster were gone. "Would you care to put trousers on before I tell you news of international importance?" When Harry didn't answer, he continued, "I'm not sure how you usually approach these things. Perhaps minor news items can be relayed whilst nude, whereas important news items require full dress?"
"Whatever," Al interrupted. "The paperwork is signed, and the baby is healthy. I don't even care if you call me old."
Malfoy sighed, but pulled his and a quill out of his robe pocket. Harry had his parchment, but had to Conjure a quill. It would probably break two minutes into using it; Conjured quills were shite.
"You're not an idiot," Malfoy said with a touch of “there, there” pomposity. "You're concerned about the world."
. I figured the most revolutionary thing I could do when faced with Rump's nonsense was to stay sober for it."
Malfoy gestures wildly at Harry, a tea cosy in his hand. "You are not allowed to get weird about this
your partner in a fight like this. But there's a noise on the landing—sounds like Ron and Hermione bickering—and it snaps Harry out of it. He has to leave. "Fine."
"Haven't you been reading about anarchism? Who's the one who says 'from each according to their ability, to each according to their need'? It's not about equal treatment, it's about making sure they each get what they need. And because Albus has an infant right now, his need for support is higher than the others'."
With Draco, there was none of that. There was only bickering and talking about their lives, and it felt normal, somehow.
you don't want to piss me off?" Harry leaned back in his chair, and Draco found himself noticing how incredibly hot this man was.
Malfoy didn’t answer, only raised the potion to his lips and drank. Harry hurried to drink his too, not wanting to look like he had been waiting for Malfoy to drink first.
Harry sighs and holds up his hands. "I'm not! I really don't know. The Muggles I lived with didn't let me do anything, and I spent most of the last decade at Hogwarts being chased by Voldemort. Sorry if I can't tell you exactly which video game to play, fucking
Department of B.A.I.R.N.s - Births, Adoptions, Interrelational bonds, Repro/fertilimancy, and Nuptials.
That night, Harry, exhausted, crawled into bed next to Draco. "I love them all so much, but I cannot express how much they wear me out."
Malfoy gave him an impenetrable look. “I don’t really want to answer that. Unless you want me to lie.”
forgetting the proper Muggle word for a household machination. It wouldn't be an issue if Scorpius would simply use an
“Come have some breakfast,” Harry said, putting a hand on James’s shoulder, “and tell us what happened.”
Harry had no idea what was going on, but he pressed the toe of his right foot into the back of his left and slipped his foot out of his trainers, hoping against hope that his socks didn't have any holes. He leaned over and grabbed the shoes, wondering what he was supposed to do now. What if his evil children made him try to walk on nails or something?!
"And congratulations," Lavender said, placing a hand on Harry's arm and giving them an excited look that made Harry uncomfortable. "I'm
"Alright," Lily said and clapped her hands decisively. "You've had your little fun. Now's the part where you laugh and we all guffaw about your prank."
Draco's face falls into faux shock; he raises his hand to dramatically cover his mouth. "Muggles have a thing with beaters that can assist in matters of masturbation?"
Lily rolled her eyes through a smile. Harry wasn't kidding, though. He didn't have favourites between his kids, but the memory of Lily's first smile stood out. Harry remembered being in a haze of sleep deprivation and toddler discipline and stepping on toy dragons, giving Lily a bottle, and she looked up at him with her wispy red hair and reached out for his face with her little hand and smiled at him. He'd cried. Well, he'd
"We hooked up in secret," Draco continued, "and we saw each other after in the course of our regular lives and it is currently in the process of slowly evolving into an actual relationship rather than just sex."
"Well, yeah. You know George thinks of you like a brother. And you're a bit nearer than Charlie, who probably can't get here just for a therapy intervention. At least, unless it were really important. But we can probably do this without Charlie, if we're all there."
Draco's face—just a moment ago carefree and joyful—has taken on its old mask of supercilious indifference. "Have you never seen people dance before, Weasley?"
"We got off track." Draco frowned. "You were asking why I was with you yesterday and then I'm saying this today—it's because I'm a piece of shit. I wanted you too much last night. Just one more time, you know?"
"But what about when the law goes through, assuming that won't stop it forever?" Lily asked. She looked impatient, which was common enough for her. She'd never done much to challenge stereotypes about redheads; Harry loved her for it. "Dad, you're not
Harry handed it over and let Draco lead. Draco was probably going to take them to the Reptile House, despite earlier claims to the contrary, and give Harry some kind of lecture on Slytherin pride.
Nico stood from his stool and grabbed Lily's hand, pulling her in to dance—the two of them waltzed around the room, laughing as they sang
He stood in the entrance hall, alone. Draco's house had never felt unwelcoming before, but then he'd never been here without Draco.
“Oh, yes, I did it this afternoon. You can add some pleasantries to it and send it off. I would be happy if we could just pay the salaries, as it’s so much easier than dealing with paperwork.”
There's an exhale, shoulders relaxing, hot mouths. There's a body under Harry's hands and it's this ridiculous, dramatic
For a few minutes they sat in silence, a million possibilities swirling through Harry’s brain. He wondered whether Malfoy’s brain was doing the same.
The man touched his wand to his head and the Glamours disappeared, revealing Draco. "Sorry. Didn't want them to think I was being an interfering spouse. Like I'm casting the Imperio, metaphorically or otherwise. One can never be too careful. It's important that everyone thinks you're still your own man."
Apparently even mild excitement about something had become out of the norm enough for them that they didn't tease each other about it.
“If it wasn’t fun?” Harry asked. When she nodded, he thought. “I guess not. But I’ve never been to a place like that before. It’s not comfortable, you know? And with Malfoy…”
Potter almost smiles. The corner of his lip lifts up and everything. That shouldn't make me as happy as it does.
The song changes to something with a dance beat and lyrics saying, "Move to the groove, move to the groove, dance!" Harry hops into the circle of people who have stopped congaing and grabs Hermione's hand. It's too loud to say anything; she catches Malfoy's eye and sends him a drunk, sceptical eye, but continues to dance.
She starts to laugh, but not like she thinks it's funny. She laughs like her entire life is unhinged, which, to be sure, it kind of is.
“Yes, thank you, Professor Potter,” Pomfrey says. “This is exactly why people with partners live longer than those without, because someone is around to make sure they seek attention when they need it.” She flips open the record and starts thumbing through it, oblivious to Draco’s shock.
"I didn't fucking ask whether the job was important," Draco said, swinging an arm out dramatically and slamming it into a container of
Harry looks up, his body tight with hot rage, and he sees Draco standing there looking like an unshakeable force. Draco's eyes are steel, not silver, and he looks like he could take a dozen Sectumsempras without falling over.
. Not that he'd actually forgotten. But he hasn't been thinking about it. He's been trying to figure out how to simply be in the same room as Malfoy without it feeling awkward. He's been busy coping with life. And he hasn't been drunk and/or on a dancefloor, and, well.
"You need to be at class in one hour," Hermione says, frowning, hand on her hip. "And you can't rely on me to wake you up!"
Draco lets himself fall heavily on top of Harry, pushing the air out of Harry's lungs and then, before Harry realises what's happening, rolling their hips together. "Maybe we did," Draco whispers, his head tucking into the crook of Harry's neck as Harry moans.
Harry’d always thought that Lucius’s long hair looked ridiculous—a prissy signal of his class and arrogance. But on Draco—or combined with the clothes, or combined with the beard—it didn’t look like Lucius at all. It looked like a huge
Potter’s laughter escapes. “You’re sitting here, unable to stop hiccoughing, and you’re allergic to an entire group of plants, and I’m just imagining you sitting inside your big manor house as a kid, hiccoughing and sneezing, and your mother telling you to stay inside because the outside world is too dangerous and your constitution too fragile.” Harry pauses. “Which, to be clear, is funny because that is very much
“They’re just normal legs,” Harry said around a hitch in his throat. “People make a big deal, but they’re just normal, weird-looking legs.”
Harry wonders, confused about what he's supposed to be doing, when Malfoy scoots down and swallows Harry's cock from underneath.
Draco wrapped Hermione in a congratulatory hug punctuated with many back pats and laughs, and the three of them chatted animatedly on the walk to the Atrium. (Ron didn’t need to go home; he just
"Is that why you went so overboard talking to Nico about law school? It's hard to watch people make mistakes you once made?"
Draco shrugged—an incongruous motion on his usually graceful body. "I don't feel guilty. I barely feel like we
Harry's spoonful of Crunchy Nut Cornflakes—it had taken him a few weeks to get a sufficient stock of ready-made foods in Draco's house—was halfway to his mouth when Draco spoke.
Harry picks up the parchment and looks at it for a moment, then touches it to the flames. Instead of bursting into flame, the letter disappears, the roar of the fire increasing for a moment as it pops out of existence. Or out of this dimension, rather.
He poured another measure of cherries out and Banished the container back to the pantry, where, out of sight, there was a mild crash.
"I can't!" Draco interrupted. "I can't be honest with you! It's like I'm fighting Imperius when I try to say…things."
An otherworldly, ethereal tone sounded, and when Harry turned around; Wilhelm had pulled out a little saw and was playing it with a bow.
. I'm attracted to all sorts of people. Usually people who don't care what people think of them. And since you are literally a politician and your job is to care about what people think of you, that may be a struggle for me."
and Harry isn't even sure what's happening anymore because his eyes are closed and his head is spinning and he just feels like
Teddy's hair slowly morphed from neon pink to a deep blue. "I don't know, it's like—none of these issues have any clear-cut rules or definitions or policies. It's easiest for me to explain just using examples of me. Like, I can morph my body to look like whatever I want, right? Any parts. I could change my biology every day. Does that make me trans? It's certainly a different experience than a trans person who isn't a metamorphmagus, but is it roughly the same like, category? How could we ever answer that? It's messy. What if I'm in a relationship with a cis man and every time I'm with him, my body is female? Is that a heterosexual relationship? Or like, it's queer for me because I'm always queer no matter what—but what about for that bloke. Is he queer now? We use all these labels because they're amazing and they help people and establish that we have
Malfoy squirms and adjusts his Tommy Hilfiger jumper. "But didn't you grow up with Muggles? Aren't these your people? I need
"You weren't listening," Draco snapped, apparently annoyed at Harry's reaction. His foot was still, and Harry tucked away the observation that the foot tapping must indicate anxiety, not anger. "If we do this, I will
“Mother and Father are seated in the garden—because I’d rather use this potion-induced imaginative power for happier things than thinking of the fucking Manor—and I say to them, ‘Hullo, Mother, Father, fuck you, and there’s no way I’m allowing you to use me as your political pawn. I will refuse all betrothals you arrange. I’m gay by the way. I don’t even care if I ever produce an heir. I won’t be living in this Manor anymore.’ And then Mother raises an eyebrow and Summons a bottle of champagne, because she’s actually quite capable of dealing with drama, but Father turns whiter and whiter until his face is the colour of his dyed hair and he clutches his chest as he faints, falling off his chair and landing on the floor, his head lolling onto the dirt.”
Ginny collapses into her desk chair, her head dropping to the desk as she softly bangs her forehead against the wood. "This cannot be happening."
"He's pretty private these days, Harry," Bill said, setting his cup on the table. "He has to be, I think, what with the way people treat him because of the war. I'd just leave him alone, if I were you."
a shame when good relationships go south. I always say it's from the magical community's shameful lack of therapy."
On Friday night, Hermione asked, “So did you figure out a skatepark to go to? I don’t even know where I’d look it up. I suppose you could Apparate to a Muggle town and then look it up once you get there.”
They spent a full thirty minutes working on Harry’s automatic negative thought, “post-war wizarding politics is hopeless.” Penelope had to stop the two of them once they’d offered a combined twenty-four items for the “evidence for” category and not a single item in the “evidence against” category.
"Dittany's hardly rubbish," I point out. I used to beg my mother to buy me dittany to heal my acne, but she claimed it was too rare and expensive to be used for acne. I'd told her, what good is wealth, if it can't be spent? She held her ground but bought it for me the next Christmas.
They reached the zoo quickly; Harry purchased tickets, blinking a bit at the fact that it cost ninety pounds for the two of them. He used to have the family membership; he expects the expired member card is still stuffed somewhere in his wallet’s magically extended space.
Draco's phone buzzed, and Harry leaned over to read the text over his shoulder. Text from Scorpius. "Dad, WHAT are you two trying to do? Give everyone in the country a heart attack? Though I guess I can see the advantage in controlling the message this way. Albus is reading over my shoulder and he says it seems quite Slytherin. I was thinking it was quite Gryffindor. I suppose it's just right then, but ugh. Did you really need to mention incest? Are you and Harry okay?"
Teddy laughed. He worked at an LGBTQ organisation that worked to improve the social, political, and legal position of queer wix in Britain; he'd been teaching a unit on sexuality and gender to sixth- and seventh-year Hogwarts students every spring for the past seven years or so.
"I'm not mad at Dumbledore." Harry sighed, rolling his eyes. "Don't get upset on my behalf over things that are water under the bridge. You're forgetting that I
Hermione's face was unreadable as she crossed her legs behind her desk, a pile of towering paperwork beside her. "I would've laughed at that."
After a few moments of silence (Penelope always left silence, always waited for them to fill it), she said, "Did you have the same experience, Harry?"
"So when I heard you talking about it the other day," Scorpius said, his voice quiet, "in the kitchen. You were—what? Just referring to the past? Why?"
"Like an intergalactic Floo!" Harry enthuses, wrapping an arm around Draco's waist and wiggling his fingers into Draco's pocket.
Harry looked over his shoulder, hearing the frantic tone in Jorgen's voice. There was something on Jorgen's face—it reminded Harry of the anxiety of a parent getting a phone call from their child's school. It was one of his kids. It was the anxiety that bubbled in a parent's chest, provoking a panicked,
"I don't really have any food," Harry says, interrupting Draco's analysis of the worthlessness of Runes translation without also teaching Runes implementation ("Because really, Potter, what good is understanding an old textbook if you can't cast a Rune yourself?").
"Harry." Draco was desperate for him to understand. "We can't be married, because a relationship that started as a heap of lies and half-truths cannot magically transform into…into something real." He almost winced—he was absolutely failing to speak his heart.
him, exactly. "Yes, well," I say. "I was mid-Crucio. We're both the worst. So I suppose we're even."
“Good things will continue to happen,” Penelope said. “Good things happen every day. Today I ate an almond croissant, and I’m going to walk to Hogsmeade. And even these big things that you feel so strongly about, the political things, are not foregone conclusions. Someone could spearhead a movement to change the structure of the government. You could do that.”
Draco met Harry's eyes. Harry had always been able to read those grey eyes pretty well, and right now he saw nothing but resignation. "I'm never going to fall in love, so it's a moot point."
." Harry tried to flick his wrist to nudge Draco into a ridiculous spin, but Draco misread the cue and tried to switch to a different hand position.
“Oh,” Harry said, wishing he were sitting up rather than fully reclined. He felt oddly vulnerable, on his back in Draco’s bed without his glasses, while Draco loomed over him with a huge fucking book. “Er, thanks. But this is fine.”
"I suppose." Draco pushed his grey-blond hair off his face. "This isn't going to hurt Scorpius and Albus, is it? They'll be alright?"
Harry tried to keep the horror off his face, not wanting to insult them. "We don't want any of that. We don't want a fictionalised account or merch or whatever."
Draco opened the cherries and poured a small pile onto the chopping block. He scowled at one that still had a pit attached, partially dislodged by whatever process was used to de-stone cherries for sale. He shot an Evanesco at the offending pit, but used too much force—the entire pile of cherries disappeared. "Fuck!"
"They do! They know how many truly horrible people you've taken down; they're scared shitless of you, and rightly so. But then you turn around and you're talking to a sentient clock or saving all the world's babies or something. Or babbling about the hypothetical mechanics of male space pregnancies."
"It's a surprise," Harry said. "But I can tell you that we said no to their suggestion that we start a reality show on holo-telly."
“Yes, it’s well within the dress code,” he said, smoothing the material down with one elegant hand. “And I do think I look rather dashing in it. If only it had pockets, it might be my new favourite.”
anything—it doesn't mean she'll leave Harry. But you can't reason with anxiety, and Harry needs to distract himself. He needs to listen to Draco blather on about something boring. No, scratch that, he needs to pull Draco's clothes off and suck his dick.
—their entire worldview is challenged! So much easier to just pretend that bi people don't exist, right?"
He said nothing. Draco’s eyes were so light, silvery grey in the industrial-strength Lumos. “Draco, I—”
Harry leaned back on his desk, taken aback. Since when did Draco ask Harry's opinion on career moves? What was he even supposed to say to that? He decided to fall back on his tried and true parenting technique of just echoing back whatever was said to him. "Er, sounds like you're considering it. What do
When Harry was an Auror, Head Auror, Head of DMLE, he'd put enormous effort into working against abuses of power. He single-handedly instituted de-escalation training, Muggle and Squib sensitivity training, Dark Magic recognition training for all officers, multicultural spell awareness training, Poverty Is Not A Crime Week, Being a Creature Does Not Constitute Probable Cause Week, and many others. He'd written dozens of policies that encoded proper channels of authority in ways that would minimise power over-steps.
"Except for that time with the whole Death-Eaters-take-over-the-government thing," Albus deadpanned.
you should show me where the item is that might be needed to save your life. Perhaps. If it's convenient for you."
“Okay, so probably the Ministry just wants to make sure that people dress professionally,” Harry said, “because you saw those dolts over in Magical Games and Sports with their little running shorts or whatever.”
Harry laughs, closing his eyes as Draco buries his fingers under Harry's back. Harry can't think of anything.
He stared at that empty “evidence that does not support the thought” column and closed his eyes. What was some possible evidence that Kingsley wasn’t being a sell-out? His brain helpfully supplied a vision of a scenario in which Kingsley had to fight to prevent an even worse outcome. Or a scenario in which Kingsley thought he could use this agreement as a basis for a future push to help werewolves. Fuck, Harry didn’t know. But the visions swimming through his brain told him they were at least possibilities.
Harry refused to open his digital owlmail until he'd had a cup of coffee or three. It was not a good day to be the head of Magical Law Enforcement in Britain. There were sure to be celebrations by Rump supporters and protests by angry, sad, and disillusioned leftists. Hell, if it weren't Harry's job to keep the streets of Diagon and other magical places safe and clear, he'd join the protests.
Malfoy’s eyes widened as he realised how much he’d said. “I don’t—” he stammered, “I don’t actually want to say that to them. At least, not like that. I really can’t do all that.”
He pulled the parchment for Penelope out of his pocket and started reading through the alternative thoughts he’d written. But instead of feeling that they were perfectly reasonable alternative thoughts, Harry felt a rush of skepticism and despondence.
Their mouths met tentatively; unlike the last time, when Harry hadn't been able to stop smiling, this time the emotion he couldn't shake was sadness. "Put your hands back in my hair," Harry whispered, a small smile tugging at his lips. "I need cheering up, after all."
“Huh? Oh, cause I’m bi,” Harry said. He almost didn’t say anything else, but then he had this vision of it maybe going well if he said what he wanted to, and he added, “Were you joking before, about being gay? Was that just you trying to list all the things you thought would shock your parents?”
Harry coughed on his mocha, spraying bits of whipped cream high into the air, which of course was the exact moment that their waiter arrived carrying his crustless quiche.
Draco, unfortunately, was still wearing the skirt. When Harry had suggested he change before the pub, Draco had fixed him with a challenging look and said, “I’m quite comfortable, Harry. Thanks ever so for your concern.”
Harry put his hand on Draco’s cheek and rubbed it down the hair—it was soft, not the prickly feeling of stubble, but coarser than head hair. It felt—good. Harry brought his eyes to Draco’s and found them staring back at him, a pink flush high on Draco’s cheekbones.
"What? No!" Draco seemed honestly offended by this. "They're in an inter-dimensional vessel." Then he whispered under his breath, shaking his head with derision, "Is the womb a portal."
“I wasn’t interrupting anything, was I?” James asked, nodding towards their state of undress. Harry was still in his joggers and an old Puddlemere t-shirt, Draco in his dressing gown.
"Wizards for the Ethical Treatment of Beings," Hermione says, and Harry jumps out of his skin, spinning around to face her.
"Hi." He smiles as she wraps him in a hug. "No thanks. I was hoping to talk to Ginny." He winces, hearing what she'll hear—the hope of a reconciliation—the hope of a son-in-law. But he's not responsible for Molly's assumptions, is he?
Unable to keep the amusement out of his voice, Harry said, “I, er, never usually hear you curse like this.” Harry reached out and gave Draco’s shoulder a little shake to help him wake up.
Draco nodded. "I didn't—I didn't know. How are you not more paranoid about it? You don't seem to worry when you eat or drink in public."
“Imagine this,” Harry said, managing a smile. “Imagine the only way Voldemort could’ve been defeated was for you to go through all that shit. Because of the wand and everything else. Imagine it was the only way.”
Harry opened his eyes and started scratching out some “evidence against,” watching Malfoy out of the corner of his eye doing the same.
Draco sighed, running a hand through his hair, and slumped. Well, if Harry had moved his body in that way, he would've been slumping. Draco was too posh to slump. On him it looked like some kind of casual lean—you might say he draped himself. Wanker. "Rump knows it's shitty. He wants to make sure everyone knows what an enormous twat waffle he is. That's why they voted for him, after all."
But when he's with Draco, he always ends up forgetting any resolutions to be circumspect. Because he doesn't really think about the things he does with Draco; he just
Harry fidgeted in his seat. She was right that he felt he was seeing the truth. That post-war politics in Magical Britain were fucking hopeless. That the left’s self-congratulatory post-war attitude was alienating those who had been neutral, causing a political rift that was preventing alliances needed to actually pass legislation. That the surviving Death Eaters’ imprisonment in Azkaban wouldn’t eradicate their views from society. That the bigots wouldn’t ever be cured of their prejudices. That people were dead and never coming back, and Harry could’ve made better decisions that may have saved them. That Hogwarts and Dumbledore had completely failed to prepare them all—him, especially—for life after the war.
At the Muggle reference, Harry peeked at Malfoy, but Penelope's hand motions must have sufficed as explanation, because he didn't raise an eye. Or maybe he knew what rollercoasters were—it wouldn't even surprise Harry. Malfoy's surprises had ceased to be surprising.
Harry looks down at his page. He's meant to be reading something called "The Philosophy of Alchemical Science," but he keeps getting stuck on the word
He’s just thumbing to his message thread with Harry when the Floo wooshes. Draco tosses his phone on the counter and walks into the living room, then freezes.
"And Draco has spent his adult life doing good work in the Wizengamot, despite everyone treating him like crap when he first started," Harry added. "He's right—we deserve to be happy."
At first Harry thought Draco was being sarcastic, but when he looked up it was clear that Draco's question was genuine. "Er." Harry chuckled nervously. "I don't know. I have a lot of practice making sacrifices for the good of others?" When Draco just stared at him, Harry continued, trying to lighten the mood, "It's kind of my thing, you know."
to slapstick duel you," Harry replied honestly. If they were ever short of cash, they could probably charge a small fortune for tickets to that.
. That's a test if Harry's ever heard one. He tries to meet Malfoy's eye, to warn him that this is a trap. Malfoy should pretend he needs to go to the loo, or—
Every time someone (Padma, Justin, Luna) had tried to get Harry to go hang out or have a party or go drinking, he’d declined. He’d rather stay in his room with Ron and Hermione, or by himself. That wasn’t a crime, was it? It was so much effort to go out. So much that could go wrong. It wouldn’t be fun, anyway. It’d just be a lot of chatter about meaningless nonsense that made Harry itchy with how that kind of conversation seemed so trite to him now. He couldn’t pretend the war hadn’t happened. He didn’t want to pretend, and he didn’t
He shrugged out of his coat, brushing a bit of leaf off the lapel as he hung it up. He emptied his pockets—phone, wallet, loose change on the console table. He placed his wand next to the other things, and walked into the kitchen. He felt naked, stripped down.
Harry tilted his head back, hoping that would encourage Draco to continue whatever he was doing to Harry's neck. "Look," Harry said, trying to affect a pedantic tone, "I only like to be impaled on knobs under the right circumstances, for example, with proper consent and forewarning, and preferably when it won't result in an accidental self-cleaning cycle."
Harry had a bit of sauce on his cheek, and Draco reached up to rub it off, brushing his thumb over the stubble on Harry's cheek, swiping over his dimple. Draco let himself
Harry's still not used to the way the Royal Academy of Magic people call it "rah-mag", but he nods all the same.
Ugh, I need to change the subject. "I can't believe we're going to die today. If I'd written a bucket list, it would be mostly unchecked. What do you wish you'd had a chance to do, Potter?"
But it feels natural. It all feels natural with Draco. Harry's not embarrassed to be naked with him. He's not awkward about sex (well, maybe he's a little awkward, but like, a normal amount). He doesn't feel strange about being naked with Draco
Hermione stands. "How do you know, Malfoy? Maybe Harry's parents didn't die in the normal dimension. Maybe they travelled to another galaxy and are stuck there."
makeup,” she said with a scowl. “Unless I’m going out and putting on glitter, because that’s fun. But how
“No.” Harry sighed, picking up a brown leaf and pressing it between his thumb and forefinger, watching it crumble. “Have you decided?”
"Is this leftover curry?" Draco asks, sniffing a takeaway carton. He's got this haughty look on his face, like the curry will be dismissed if it makes one mis-step; in an odd contrast, he's also got red marks on his bare torso from Harry grabbing him.
It's a bizarre sight: Draco Malfoy wearing jeans and a loose, maroon-coloured, collared bowling shirt, surrounded by Muggles, asking the bartender for a G&T. Last time Harry saw him, he'd been in
"I mean, that's not a lie. Well, I guess these Muggles might just think you were goth. In any case. You look ridiculous."
"A Galleon," he says, laughing a bit. His eyes have that spark of wonder they often have when he's delighted by magic. "I guess that's useful, but not really for this purpose." He sticks it in his pocket.
"I don't know what the fuck I want," Harry said, thinking of career paths and housing decisions and the weight of society's expectations.
"We said we wanted to do it as soon as possible, so that it was old news by the election. We have the public's approval, thanks to Parvati and Lavender. The kids are all fine. So…we should start planning. Right?"
"I'll help!" Nico said, leaning forward. "We could do a wicked social media campaign. So many ways it could go. Scare tactics? Show images of poisoned Muggles? Some kind of image of the earth being overtaken by toxicity? Babies dying from their arrogance?"
Draco blinked, taken aback. His eyes fell to Harry's lips again, then snapped back to Harry's eyes. "Can—?"
"Indeed." Draco shook his head, a faint smile on his lips. "Sometimes I can't believe this is my life."
when Draco slammed his fist on the table and then Hermione nodded vigorously, throwing one of her hands into the air.
I'm sitting against the opposite wall, mirroring his position, except I'm freshly bathed. I'm sure I look like shite, though, even if my hair is clean.
Harry laughed. “It makes you wonder. If all human children start off as nudists, why are so few adults?”
Draco’s bedroom looked no different, which had Harry wondering where all his things were. He started opening drawers and wardrobes at random, and found that Lorraine had somehow split the space evenly. Probably through the generous use of magical space.
Harry blinked, looked at Draco, blinked again. He dropped the bags he was carrying, then realised that wasn't right and bent to pick them up.
"He is here. Our time is up." My father extends a hand. He's going to Apparate me away. Or maybe he's going to deliver me to the Dark Lord himself. Maybe he'll kill me himself, in hope of gaining favour. I don't even know anymore.
He needs more power. I drop my forehead to the stone wall and ask myself if there's any bravery left in me.
"Mr Potter! Harry!" Jorgen cried, shouting above the voices asking Harry to make a comment. "HARRY!"
"Excellent!" Draco proclaimed, his hands and lips gone from Harry's face before he had even clocked what was happening, and Draco turned and was out the door. "See you tonight!"
“Harry,” Penelope replied, leaning forward in her leather wingback chair, “I'm not saying that these depressive thoughts you're having are
Harry said the first thing that came to mind. “Er, situation: I need to decide what to do after school. Automatic negative thought: every job fucking sucks.”
"The Draught of Pure Imagination," Slughorn enthused. "A lovely little concoction. I may nip a small bit of it for myself, I dare say. Ho ho!"
"We're all happy for you two. Just do us a favour, and if you're going to engage in premarital activities, wait at least ten minutes so we can clear out."
"I'm really sorry to grab the baby and run," Scorpius said, Summoning all of the baby items in sight into a tote bag with ASTER magically embroidered on the side, "but I need to get back home. The nighttime routine requires adherence down to the minute, or none of us get any sleep. Thank you for watching her!"
Lorraine Apparated directly in front of Scorpius, holding aloft a soup tureen that had been charmed not to slosh. "Master Scorpius, a freshly made cassoulet for dinner. And a small side of plain beans for Miss Aster."
Draco waved a hand, unwilling to explain the mind-numbing intricacies of Malfoy estate planning to anyone in this world, much less Harry, whom he
"What for?" Harry knew that James was capable of producing a perfectly functional Disillusionment, because he'd used it to try to trick Harry on multiple occasions. The cloak, meanwhile, lived in a locked cabinet.
He looked at the side of the cup, where a quill usually scribbled the contents of the cup, but instead of reading "Caramel Latte," it read,
"Nah, mate." Ron crosses his arms over his chest. "Hermione told me we're not 'playing house' and she will invite me over when she's ready to invite me over."
"A fair point," Draco said. He stood, gesturing to the desk. "Tell me what you have so far on this policy paper?"
"The water doesn't get hot enough in the third floor bath unless you use a Charm. There's a thriving magical aquarium inside one of the toilet tanks—Scorpius Charmed that when he was younger and couldn't bear to get rid of it. Supper is at seven unless I'm stuck at work, in which case I always let Lorraine know." He paused, halfway up the stairs. "And you. I'll always let Lorraine and you know."
"I just got off with them," Harry said, gesturing towards the fire and standing with a groan. He looked at Draco—pink cheeks, sparkle in his grey eyes. "You bought something for her, didn't you?"
"But what you're suggesting is that those actions are, perhaps, beyond forgiveness? That's very interesting, Ronald."
"Don't mind me, lads! Yeh seemed to be getting on just fine!" Wilhelm proclaimed, swinging his axe up onto his shoulder.
“I didn’t say that.” Her mouth screws up to the side; she looks as if she’s trying to find the correct words. “What I am about to say may be of a sensitive nature, so if you’d like Professor Potter to step out…”
Draco let his emotions stay at the surface; he didn't push them away. He grabbed Harry's shoulders and let all the love and desire and worry and fear and love and gratitude and disbelief pour from his lips into Harry's mouth. He let the
Draco snorted, allowing himself a measure of relief that Harry didn't take offense. "I may have swung too far in the opposite direction with Scorpius. Every time he pulled himself to a stand, I would whisper that he didn't have to. Astoria thought I'd gone barmy." He paused. "I suppose I had gone barmy."
For a few minutes they sit like that, Harry sipping his tea, taking comfort in his friend's embrace, in the comfort of shared understanding. He has the sudden premonition that he's been a terrible friend to her lately—making everything about him, even though she's going through just as much.
Harry takes a breath and begins the process of answering questions slowly and deliberately, making sure to include every single thing that had ever happened in the last few years that made Harry think maybe, just maybe, Draco Malfoy wasn't a complete prick.
"So?!" Harry's tapping on the table picked up pace. "Last I checked, it wasn't a problem to have emotions for your spouse."
"I think it's funny," Harry said softly from the sofa, "that your parenting love language is like, offerings of stuff."
The Floo interrupted them and Lily stepped out, holding a piece of paper. When she saw the two of them, she froze. "Oh,
Penelope held up a hand. “This is not group therapy. If you two need counselling to work through your relationship issues, it’ll have to happen at a separate time.”
Oh. The Circadian Charm wasn’t safe to cast at oneself. Something about the danger of falling asleep as you were casting. No one but Ginny had ever cast it on Harry. “Oh. Er, sure. Thanks.”
At Scorpius's voice, Harry jumped backward, away from Draco, eyes wide. Draco's cheeks were red and Harry covered a laugh. "Erm." He cleared his throat. "Wouldn't want our kids to catch us at it before we have a chance to tell them of our secret love affair."
"Forgive me, but I really don't want to talk about that. Unless—" Draco's eyes narrowed. "Unless you're still threatening to jilt me at the altar, if I don't do what you say…?"
dumped that woman for hitting the track forward button on "Rebel, Rebel." He was just about to open his mouth to offer a life lesson about how love wasn't necessarily principled when Draco spoke up.
Harry groaned, shaking his head. "No, never mind, I'm not going to invade your space any more than I already have. Maybe shelves would be good. I was just thinking about how annoying it is to have to keep changing where my stuff is whenever the kids come, too, but forget it."
Draco tilted his head to the side. "What is it, Potter? I can hear you thinking. You changing your mind before we get to the slapstick duel?"
"I love you," Draco muttered back, his face smushed into Harry's shoulder. "I love you. You really think we can do this?"
and did James have no shame? But then Ron caught Harry's eye and made this grimace that seemed to reflect a sentiment of
"What am I even doing, Dobby?" Harry whispered, but there was no answer except for the crash of the waves.
Malfoy sighed. “Maybe. I’m sorry, by the way. Imagine that. I’m sorry, and I’m actually telling you out loud. Why am I telling you that?”
"Poor sods," Draco said, his words at odds with the fond look on his face. Apparently they were going to ignore Astoria's commentary on Draco's parenting.
"I have to agree with Harry, here," Wilhelm piped up, and Harry could only assume Wilhelm wanted to make sure Draco knew he was no longer silenced. "You name a kid Amaryllis and inevitably people call them Amar and from there, who knows? Amaretto? Amar, but pronounced real harsh—it's like your kid's called Hammer! What's next, Sickle?"
She says nothing, which is unlike her. She just walks, apparently content to let Harry have the full brunt of the awkwardness.
Harry breathed a sigh of relief and cast a charm to improve his attentiveness—one he learned his first year of Auror training and had consistently used in every meeting since. Well, in every meeting he cared about. In the pointless meetings, he allowed his mind to wander.
Just as Harry began to smile and feel his shoulders relax a fraction, he heard a weary sigh behind him and turned to see Malfoy standing, arms crossed.
She's so calm—weary but calm—and Harry doesn't understand. How can she be acting so...so...logical? "What was there to
Draco clamped both hands over his mouth, then rolled to press his face into a pillow, but his lips moved despite himself, creating a muffled kerfuffle.
Harry tried to pull him in for a hug, but Albus stared at Draco and his phalanx of baby paraphernalia.
Harry's face gets even hotter. "I didn't mean—oh, fuck." He sits at the kitchen table. "I didn't mean I forgot it. I obviously didn't forget it; it was amazing sex. I just—I don't know. I think I compartmentalised it. Like, we did that before we were classmates, and that was something else. Now we're learning how to, you know, coexist."
Harry understood the dangerous tendencies of law enforcement better than most. He had worked at the DMLE for over thirty years, but his job had never made him numb to the dangers of the profession.
"Very funny," Draco said. "And no, I donated that entire vault to Hogwarts once I realised the key wouldn't take no for an answer."
"Come on, what is it? Like, five shots of decaf espresso with foam, extra hot, and a dash of cinnamon?"
Or maybe he was making excuses. Maybe all those things wouldn't stop Harry from talking to Draco if he really wanted to. Maybe Harry was nervous.
Last July they'd all gone to the London Pride parade. Harry had tried to go in his usual clothes—a pair of jeans and a Queen t-shirt. He'd figured that the Queen t-shirt was basically bi pride merch, anyway.
"Miraculous," Malfoy drawls, and all the wonder in his voice is gone, replaced with the usual arrogance. As if it's
“We need to get publicity as soon as is feasible,” Draco said, quickly pivoting from the wank issue, “because the threat of public disapproval is what will stop the Ministry from taking action against us. So I think we’d better get ahold of someone at the Prophet, because their reach is much wider than Luna’s.”
Hermione went to wrap Harry in a hug. "How are you two? I've been in a stupor. I still can't believe it."
Draco laughed, looking over his shoulder for his son. Scorpius was sitting in front of the fireplace, charming fairy lights into James's and Albus's hair. "Quite right. He always made it festive, even when I didn't have…" He gestured at the mess of flour and sugar covering the kitchen, "structured Christmas activities for us."
Another time, Harry arrived home to find the vestibule littered with Amazon boxes. “Uh, Draco? Have you been Muggle online shopping?!”
Harry stared at him. Malfoy looked genuine, not sarcastic. He placed his right ankle on his left knee; his shoes had that undefinable look that indicated they cost more than Harry’s entire wardrobe.
Harry turned away from the empty pitch. The morning sun glinted off Malfoy's hair. At close range, Harry could see a freckle near his left ear and that his hair got slightly darker at the roots, not like it was coloured, but like it had changed colour with time or sun exposure.
“How many times can we say ‘arse cheeks’ in one conversation?” Draco asked, the side of his mouth turning up into a grin.
like angry Harry who killed the Dark Lord, and try to use me to forget about whatever's bothering you." Draco leans forward, eyes challenging. "Talk to me."
Harry holds his arm up awkwardly, wondering what Malfoy is doing, when Malfoy pulls his wand and sends a spell at Hermione. Harry has a moment of panic, but the spell seems just to tap her shoulder and she looks their way. She walks towards them, and Harry says, "I'll meet you at home, okay? I need to—Malfoy and I need to—talk."
. What a bell-end. He opened his office door. "Jorgen, I'm off to Malfoy's for the Vow, so I'll probably be out of the office for the rest of the day. Text me if anything important comes up?"
but he also can't be arsed because he really wants Malfoy's tongue in his mouth again. She nods, and once outside, Harry turns around, his ears fuzzy as they adjust from the loud noise of the club. "Erm."
Harry forces himself to meet Malfoy's eye. "I also, erm, don't think that casual sex with a friend is on the cards for me. Like, a drunken one-night-stand when you think you won't see each other again is different than having sex with a friend. I wouldn't want—" Oh fuck it, he might as well forge ahead. "I wouldn't want to do that with a friend unless we were, you know, properly together."
"I've never written a business plan," Draco said slowly. "But I assume you need to consider the costs, marketing, sets of goals for each of a series of time frames, at what point you project the venture becoming profitable." He paused. "Market research, probably. Showing why there's a need for your product and why you expect it would be successful."
This motley group was an improvement over Harry's usual Ministry meetings, too. They were much more engaging. They weren't all career bureaucrats; many ages and viewpoints were represented. Before long, they'd made a list of the most vulnerable groups (magical refugees, immigrants, people with non-Western cultural ties, poor Muggleborns, people with housing insecurity, Squibs, non-English-speaking magical people, werewolves and other beings with "creature" status) and strategies for outreach to each group. Harry's input wasn't needed for any of this—it didn't involve magical law enforcement or require his Saviour persona. He listened raptly, though, at one point wrapping an arm around Albus's shoulder and taking comfort in the close press of his son.
She wriggled out of his grasp and began whispering with Teddy, who had somehow already eaten all of his toast. Teddy grinned, and the two of them ran out of the room.
“Lucky for me, I’ve always found your father supremely annoying. So there was never any love-struck wool pulled over my eyes.”
Harry groaned. "Not a Howler, but based on them. Rump decided he hated the paper aeroplanes the Ministry uses because they looked 'girly.' He thought this fit better with his style." Having received more than his fair share of Howlers and Rumplers (as Harry called them, when safely out of earshot) over the years, he resignedly tapped it with his wand.
"I am going to be excellent at this, Potter," Malfoy says as Harry struggles with the Muggle lock they use in addition to their wards. "I am a country gentlewizard; excelling at shooting fowl is in my nature."
“Which side is yours?” Harry asked when they’d finally stopped laughing, sobering up quickly when he realised they were about to get into bed together.
"I didn't run away," Malfoy said, turning to fully look at Harry. "I had someplace to be. I left a note."
"I just want people to be shitty to you for only the right reasons," Harry says, as if this makes sense, as if it's very important. "Like, because you're a knob, not because Voldemort made you do things in the war."
He wakes to tears on his cheeks. He sits up, trying to calm his racing heart, trying to convince himself that the flames weren't real—that hadn't happened—his parents had died in a different, equally horrifying way. He rubs the heels of his hands over his eyes, takes a drink of water. Fuck.
A tingling jet of cold air blasted into Harry's skin and he found himself skidding backward, away from Draco, as if he'd been yanked away. He blinked, trying to get a sense of his surroundings, and saw Hermione standing with her wand out, giving him an inscrutable look.
"He's complaining about how everyone keeps asking him how this will be written in the history books of the future."
When the music blared, they danced. When people clinked spoons on glasses, they kissed. When people shouted "awwwww," they smiled.
And if Draco turned him down—well. If slicing someone open in a bathroom and nearly killing them didn’t ruin a friendship, asking them on a date probably wouldn’t.
"He's too vain to kill you in a cellar." I'm not sure why I'm voicing this particular thought, though it's true. "So, there's that. You'll probably die upstairs."
Draco lifted a shoulder. "Scorpius and I don't have a bunch of mandatory Yuletide events, like it seems you do."
After they'd been there for an hour, Ginny sat cross-legged on the floor and pulled out a pack of Exploding Snap cards.
“Shut your pretty fucking arse mouth, Harry Potter.” Draco’s weary tone just made Harry laugh harder.
"We might be able to have lovers sign a non-disclosure agreement, tell them we have an open marriage but that it can't leak to the public."
"I think red shoes has a crush on black hoodie," Draco observed as one of the boys slid along the metal edge Harry didn't know the name for. Red shoes was, indeed, looking longingly at black hoodie.
“Up until about six months ago, Malfoy, my wildest dream was that the  war would end and everyone I love would still be alive,” Harry said, suddenly exhausted. “It didn’t happen, though truthfully, we came a lot closer than I thought we would.”
