He glared at the bottle and its label. He wanted— He half wanted to—No, he really wanted— Nudging Potter under the table didn’t so much as get him a twitch.
“Help me up, we’re almost there.” Harry struggled again, Draco relenting only a fraction to allow Potter to stand - no way was he marching off again - and he stood with Potter awkward as it was shuffling to his feet and trying to hold himself up with his hands and arms shaking on Draco’s shoulders, Draco’s robe crinkled and bunched under Potter’s hands - bloody Merlin. What even was today?
Sighing throughout the house, Draco wasn’t sure if he should return it to his finger. Not until this blanket of guilt removed itself from his head. What was he doing? What did he really think would happen? Realistically? Nothing could come of this, nothing public.
“How long ago was that?”
The fact Harry wasn’t even dressed – it was almost lunch! - but sat in the bed with the owl – oh no - “Off,” Draco shooed the bird back to where it belonged. Harry read his letter with a smile.
Draco smirked, “you don’t need to do that either.” Kid-gloves from Harry. Funny. From what Hermione said, they were both Oblivated, or at least seemed it. He sipped at his glass. Blaise, he hoped, was telling the truth. He hoped Theo rotted in whatever torment he made.
“Pay in for Pan’s pet project and I’ll do it.”
“What month would you say this happened in?”
“Tonk’s changed to a canine because of her love for Lupin – he was part werewolf.”
“Because being turned into an owl was your plan?” Stabbing, prickling heat spread over his face and Draco scoffed. He couldn’t say it was. Now he must look incompetent. If Draco picked what he loathed out of all humanity’s traits it was that one. Do a job and do it well. Do it once and never again. Some might find cowardice or jealousy more distasteful but Draco was forced to be self-sufficient. Potions for Astoria were brewed by him because no one wanted to be the Apothocary that sold the woman who shagged Voldemort a potion to breathe easier.
How long had it been? He really should go back to sleep and leave the talking for later. So he waited, keen to lay with the comfort of another person. He did miss this, as Harry nuzzled and hugged into his space. While Harry was content to return to sleep, Draco stayed up. Mind whirling. This was fine, nice even. So, why was he panicking earlier?
“Be careful,” she spoke to him soft and caring and for a single moment Draco wondered what would he have to do to lose Luna’s tentative friendship. Was being cruel to anyone a deal-breaker?
It wasn’t difficult to say Harry would never find someone like Ginny. They’d been through a war together, had death and scars all around them. And still they’d stayed because they loved each other – like Draco did Astoria. But to assume going from such a long and closely knit relationship back to something not so serious was naive. Then again, Harry had never been a Casanova.
And it was somewhere around his fifth bottle when the thought of staying here wasn’t so bad. No awful memories to conjure up, none at all. Just having to deal with Harry using the shower for hours upon end. How he hadn’t run through the world’s water supply, Draco would never know.
If Draco was an impulsive sort like Harry, he might have listened to the part of his brain that told him to push back or close his eyes or bloody well grab at Harry’s hands and push them further down or demand him to do it harder. No, what Draco did was started to tilt his head, occasionally, slightly, so Harry wouldn’t ignore that side so much.
“I’m not fucking lying! A year of my life is gone! Gone.”
The Healer left, hopefully to learn some bedside manner.
Harry found him hiding in the rafters of one of the opened interrogation rooms. He relented the notepad first then stepped over to be carried back to Harry's Office. He shut the door, grumbling about Rita and how much of a pain she was. Draco could only hoot in agreement.
Bringing his separated wife, her brother and his what -- current infatuation? -- to the same bar to drink? Merlin, no wonder Harry’s life was filled with such drama and adventure.
Unlike the anger and the tears, the sheer lack of reaction from those words put Draco on edge. Harry was always the one to bicker first, to argue and show his emotions. This numbed stare made Draco shift, relax his grip on him if only it brought Harry back from his messed up headspace.
The magic diminished slowly, Harry couldn’t just switch it off. It took a few minutes for his talons to touch the ground but he was no longer enraged. He knew what Astoria had cost him: years of moping in private and wanting to be left alone. He didn’t wish that on anyone. Still, he would remind his son uncontrollable magic was dangerous regardless of the moral compass it came from.
The Chasers which remained unharmed were better, more agile on their brooms but Draco couldn’t say he was watching them with much interest. Hurry up and get Scorpius in the air.
“I heard, he split from her because she cheated!”
“You were a bully - an awful person in school and I thought Harry was barmy letting you off.” Neville sighed and conceded and Draco was not so soft as to think it was because he might have looked hurt over the truth. “And then Luna said I should give you a chance because you were different now.”
“I’ll demonstrate. I'll make Neville blush.” The table did not believe him, Neville included. Draco made a point not to look at Harry because he was sure if he had he’d be using him as a prop in this demonstration - just to erase some of this petty jealousy. He whispered in Neville’s ear how grateful he was he hadn’t shunned Scorpius and was undoubtedly the best Herbology teacher to set foot in Hogwarts. It took longer for Draco to speak than the colour did to rise. Laughing at his handiwork, Draco was more relaxed now. Nothing he couldn’t handle, no one he couldn’t handle.
“For your recent behaviour,” he flicked a Galleon to her, “here you are. A bonus for protecting Scorpius.” Lotty apparated away though not far enough that they couldn’t hear her exclaim how she was unworthy of such a merciful master (Lotty was the only one who would ever consider Draco capable of mercy).
“Yes how fearsome you are, not even able to hold your own head up. The world quakes.” For good measure, Draco prodded Harry’s cheek and Harry grumbled and tried his best to move. He did not manage it. “I would think most would be concerned about being so out of it.” Draco crossed his arms and didn’t have to try to look unimpressed.
“It’s really mine?”
Muggles must have had a very inconvenient life, no easy refreshing spells, nothing to make clothes clean – within a few seconds. Draco didn’t mean to say he thought all of their inventions were awful. Most of them were and only a select few were noteworthy. Showers, did and would always beat spells in terms of comfort. And yet, Draco wanted neither when he awoke.
“About time.” Returning to eat, Harry’s apprehension was gone as if it hadn’t been there. “You know, absence makes the heart grow fonder.”
Up the stairs, into one of the old room never used, not for anything but storage, and at the far side, a metal pipe cut onto the floor. This room used to contain experiments, dark and disgusting. Before Draco’s time but he didn’t need to acknowledge the rust-like stains which made the pipe stink during the rainy days. Whatever thrown down this pipe would cover those at the door, and Draco couldn’t fathom such hate at unwanted guests. He’d love if Moran used the front door.
“Right because you don’t just have your magic.”
“I did not kiss him!”
Harry, as such, was left well alone during the rest of the after-party. Draco spoke to the rest, careful of his words and the earlier heat dying because tonight showed how useless it was. No one would think well of him, even if Potter had his say. Weatherby didn’t so much as answer a question any more. He’d simply been caught up in whatever little spell of Harry’s.
Scorpius bit his lip only to wince. “Can we talk later?”
“So your affections are because of the crup?”
“Sometimes it helps just to have someone with you, through the rubbish bits.” Draco wanted dearly to write his letters, his questions and insults. He wanted his livelihood back even if it wasn’t necessary for wealth, he needed it for himself. And Harry, ever optimistic and heartfelt and not-Draco. But there was no going back. Harry had seen it.
SHOW/TELL THE CRUP WHERE IT RESTS
“Unless you want Lotty to burst into tears, you’ll have it served in bed, you pillock.” Harry erupted into a wheezing cough before Draco could say anything else. This wasn’t right, this wasn’t right at all. Draco rubbed at his eyes and wished he could leave the house and deny any existence of what was going on here. “This was the worst idea ever.”
A frizz of redheaded hair told him a Weasley neared. Oft. Going by the physique, not the one who might kill him by crushing him still best to make room. No, he would rather leave. Accidentally, he shoulder-checked into another guest, panic arising. Just what he needed, another mention about his truly evil manners.
He hadn’t just wanted one as a boy, he’d been utterly disappointed to be a Malfoy when he’d found out. Madness.
He checked the Owlery, where some letters had been deposited and ignored. A quick look and it was from no one with any urgent news. Daphne and Luna with their own take on the new vote. Daphne and her parents were absent from the vote, no doubt a move to show displeasure but not change the more likely outcome. They’d complain like the rest how they’d be taxed and how unfair it was to put children not their own through school.
“Lotty was asked again. Lotty didn’t want to be rude - even though Lotty is mending the Manor - Mister Harry Potter wishes Master Draco Malfoy’s presence.”
“Hard choice that.” Harry was far too pleased with himself and Draco blamed the phone call for it. “Care to help me up?” He shifted forward, as if Draco would fall for this act.
His eyes would never adjust to this veil of darkness and he was glad. Glad Potter wouldn’t see him worry or question. He really was a coward, wasn’t he? The darkness emboldened him like a thief. Reaching out, entangling that unruly mess of hair between his fingers, till he could feel the heat from his scalp. With gentle strokes Harry leaned into them.
(Your social circle is somewhat limited, it’s not an issue if you have a friend or two but what happens if they can’t see you? Your emotional support system needs some attention.)
“I haven’t, apologises but things have been… difficult.” Draco looked at his shoes instead of Luna’s usual stare. Bit into his bottom lip and waited to hear of her judgement. Luna tilted her head, whatever contraption sat on the table between them fogged up Harry’s lenses.
“You owe me, Draco. If it wasn’t for me, you wouldn’t have won that one.”
“My healing spells aren’t great, but it should help.” His healing spells were by far terrible and he cast the same spell several times before it slowed the bleeding but it failed to staunch it completely. Fuck.
“I’m going to bed. Goven can deal with you from now on.”
I've another few chapters to upload though will be double checking each so I'll try for one per day, so long as there are no major issues. They are in varying length (this one is fairly long, the next few are around 7-5K~ish).  I suppose what I'm saying is... This is probably going to be like a 12 days of Christmas, just... with chapters.
“It’s agricultural, about hippocampus fins.” Blaise really had no real reason to be upset.
What was Harry up to now?
‘Just have a bite,’ she’d say, ‘promise me you’ll get something soon,’ and then Draco would grumble an apology and he’d follow her and eat his fill and Astoria was pleased. Too pleased, sometimes, over Draco just doing what was necessary. Apparently as much as Draco could do a few tasks side by side he did so at the expense of his own health. An obsessive tic that might have followed him through Hogwarts.
Making sure Scorpius wasn't trying to make a joke, Draco sat a little straighter. Really? Had he just said that to him? Without so much as a hint of sarcasm? “You just skipped the country after a tiff with your friend – one which I might add, you claimed you never wanted to see again.”
Draco’s laugh translated as a long shriek that neighbours would hear if Potter hadn’t put up silencing charms.
“Sure.”
“You asked me a question,” Harry didn’t so much as look up from his files and Draco could tell the panic from either was returning.
If Draco could spit his hate towards the inefficient and noncommittal attempt, he would. What Harry got was Draco attacking the door handle, desperate to open it. Harry scoffed, told him off and Draco just screamed at him. Trying again - the noise of his talons clashing against the wood and metal off putting.
“Harry.”
“It’s eating plant matter.” What kind of bear only ate plants? Where was the blood? The crazy urge to rip people apart for intruding on its territory? Were all animals in the Muggle world so utterly feeble and dull?
"Repello.” Draco tilted his head, watched the spell hit the wall and voice colder than before, he said, “You’re going to die if that’s it. You and Albus should leave.” Albus yanked Scorpius over to whisper in his ear, hurried and panicked Scorpius nodded. The two of them cast together.
“Who did you come in the Floo with? Before.”
Walking, keeping his head high and ignoring the glances that both Malfoy’s were out and in Saint Mungo’s was easy. His only problem was one of the Healers who stood in front of him, unimpressed and snappy.
(See the end of the chapter for
Not so happy with this one but it'll do until I'm not as distracted by the end of Lucifer season 4. I am brokzenx~.
“Not gonna lie, Harry. These things, they burrow under scales - dragon scales. Their teeth alone can cut chunks out of people.” Charlie might have caught the panic that shot over Harry’s face, the exasperated huff from Siobhan and Draco wasn’t sure why - but he really needed to sit down. The pictures were more than enough for him, he didn’t need to think about it taking literal pieces out of people. “Not that, that will happen! I’m going to be holding onto it, it won’t do that. But it will want to latch on and it does that with its teeth.”
No wonder he had no friends. No wonder he was so pleased and comfortable with Luna. The Loopy Luna who might very well be impossible to fluster.
And then he stopped pretending and looked at it.
“Harry,” Draco panicked, “Harry, your phone is yelling at me. I didn’t do anything.” The very face of the phone had changed, as if it were somehow angry, ready to spit and swear at him going by how it convulsed - until he read the name Neville and then Draco was simply confused.
“Potter’s visiting you pretty often.”
Decimus whined, pawed at the shine on Draco’s shoes as if it could sense the crumbling pride at his feet.
“I don’t need to go in till later.” His ruined shirt rested on the bed, and Draco pulled his wand to fix it. Knowing Harry’s usual ignorance he spelled the buttons back on.
The morning wasn’t fresh and welcoming. Tired and too at peace, Draco slept several times, over and over until the ache in his stomach returned and Draco slipped out of bed, to find food.
“Must I?” Harry’s face was reacquainted with a cushion. “I may have told Ginny, you know what? I can’t tell you. No, I can’t.” Was this Harry’s second breakdown of the day? Watching him mumble and turn red told another story. Draco had to know now.
“Lotty will find a salve for your allergic reaction.”
“Definitely, Mary was sick. Can’t stand being near it. Poor thing was in a state when she found it. Left wing was shattered. Don’t think it’ll fly for a while.”
The problem with such an accusation was Draco wasn’t feeling hunger - at all.
“I’d heard Nott was with another man – I didn’t expect it to be you--” Draco understood then, impressed. “--because the rumour about you and Pansy was out already. That was fairly well played.” Another expectation diverted as Blaise didn’t start gloating or bragging. “Blaise? What’s going on with you, you’ve been acting odd for a while now.”
At least his son wasn’t going to die, Harry had more of a chance to defeat him and Scorpius and Albus could defeat Blaise. Draco never wanted to lose a duel before.
“Mallory.”
“Fuck off. Both of you.” Wilks stalked away.
“And your boss,” Draco countered, hoping it would sink in. “If you tell Hermione, she’s going to have to force you to give up your job. And if that happens, the Prophet will be all over her - and you - and everyone else who's ever so much as stood in line with you to give an opinion as to why.”
“Lotty brought some, said you hadn’t eaten breakfast.” Harry gave him such an expectant look it was difficult not to sit up and attempt to eat. The tray sat nearby, two plates – one empty, Harry having finished his own in several quick bites with such speed, it reminded him of a baby bird, swallowing up whatever food given.
Really, it wouldn’t have been difficult to entice Moran to have a taste. Really, whatever buzz he searched for at the ends of the vials was what killed him. Had he even considered how easy it was to taint a potion?
Now Draco was confused and glad to show it off. This didn’t make any sense. Had Harry been hit on the head? Was this a side effect to the potion? Should he call a Healer? “I don’t have a farm.” Harry still didn’t look like he understood the problem. “You don’t have a farm. We have no sheep Harry and I will not purchase them to amuse your… creature. Dog.”
Draco allowed the change of topic. Handed over Potion Number One which was a sickly yellow that sparkled in the vial. Hesitating after sniffing it, Harry knocked it back and grimaced. Potions weren’t any good if taste was a factor: only children needed those. Then Draco sat, pocket watch in hand and started to time Harry and make a note of any symptoms, wanted or not.
Harry was on his way downstairs - those took him a little while, and Draco paused in his half-rabbit half-dragon attempt. He hadn’t seemed to take the stairs often, even at the party. Probably not strong enough to rushup and down them just yet. When he started moving again, Draco returned to blacking out the fur and pushing the worry out of his head with each haphazard stroke.
Harry started and Draco wanted to apparate right there, “You--” And he was interrupted as Lotty appeared, carrying a bowl of soup. It didn’t look appetising with its purple and grey colouring.
Draco struggled to follow the logic in the same way he could not hold his head up.
“It worked.” Harry’s venom would make an adder blush.
His revelation came in the form of Harry trying to keep to his side of the bed - he flinched away when his foot dared to tap at Draco’s shin. If Draco hadn’t seen the pattern before, he’d have been offended. The mattress shifted under him as he turned over and Draco tried to make out some details of the room. Only the black blob of Harry’s hair, the greys and whites of the covers and-- Harry turned around too, too close - too close - his hair tickling at Draco's neck and chin.
Potter was annoyingly naive at times. Did he really not see why? Even he, Draco Malfoy, someone who had already had Potter stand up and say to everyone else he wasn’t actually a Death Eater still made sure not to be seen near him. Just in case any disaster was blamed on his presence near him.
Resting was always a thought, a traitorous and deadly thought Draco had. If he stopped here, if he dared slow down he would die. He just had to find somewhere else to hide, somewhere not in plain sight. Reminding himself of Harry, forcing himself to go up the stairs helped. He wasn’t going to be outdone walking up stairs. Harry was having a laugh if he thought Draco couldn’t also be unbelievably stubborn.
“I still have the names of the Healers I considered, look through them tomorrow.”
Harry didn’t say a word and Draco’s ready to ignite anger fizzled out. Already, Harry had settled down using Draco as a makeshift pillow. How long Harry stared back, Draco couldn’t hope to say.
Harry handed the glass off with no care, sloshing over the rim and over Draco’s hand. What was he staring at? Draco looked down, memories still swimming independently. “Not gonna watch them?”
Draco wanted to see the runes himself, though Luna did not use a quill or ink. A Muggle contraption, most likely as it scratched against the parchment. He wasn’t Outstanding in them but they would give a glimmer of hope and knowledge as to what was really wrong. She was quick to make a copy and Harry rotated it in his hands as he looked at the runes. Draco had seen only three he recognised one was: everlasting, the second was: magic, the last was: bound. They were most certainly not good runes when dealing with a curse and a wizard and Harry’s expression mimicked it.
“No bloody surprise there,” Ron snapped and Draco paused in his request. They really had guffed this friendship of theirs up and while Draco had no intention of fixing it – he wasn’t a mender by any stretch of the term – he was worried over that terrible magic which crawled up his arm.
Ron opened the door and the wards fluttered away--
The next chapter is currently sitting at around 2K words. So, I'd say it's maybe a 4th-5th of the way done, however once I finish that one I can upload the next one immediately after that too, as that is in my finished pile as I skipped ahead for that one. Cruuu is your clue. So basically, next update is a doubler. :'D
“Wilks started it,” she informed him. “By breathing.”
“You--” Draco turned to see if Harry was playing a joke. But all Potter did was stare back, interested in what Draco would say. No. No, surely not. He was friends with Hermione. How--  “I don’t even know how you survive knowing so little.”
Why did nothing ever go to plan?
“Perhaps you’ll speak more plainly before I get the wrong idea.”
“It was a last minute thing.” It sounded like a lie even to him, so he added taking a sip of his champagne. “Ask Hermione if you don’t believe me.” Finally, Ginny’s presence quelled and her Gryffindor bravado calmed. Whatever she thought was going on, he’d managed to convince her otherwise. Because there was no way on Earth that Hermione would cover for Draco when it came to Harry.
“I’ll take my chances.” Draco yanked his arm back and scowled at the height difference, it bugged him, terribly. And Wilks, whatever kindness he considered before was dead too as he sneered back in a way that was Slytherin Common Room Embarrassment Defences.
Draco would apologise to Albus, he was going to kill his father. He refused to believe he’d been degraded to a pun. This should count as abuse, made illegal and have an Azkaban sentence carried alongside it. Potter was the worst.
Luna giggled as Neville corralled Seamus to sit. Draco hated this beckoning back to reality. Too many emotions and too much booze all swirling around Draco couldn’t even tell any more what he was feeling. Angry? Disappointed? Hurt?
“You stay away from this shop if you know what’s good for you.” He sounded harsh, harsher than what Draco had ever heard from him. Wrek made a song and dance how much he disliked Dark Magic but he sold anything to everyone and didn’t ask.
It sat there, warmed by a charm. One lesson the War brought Draco was he was not to expect affection from others so easily again. Complimenting idiots became the sneering ones, the galleon-chasers were more obvious in their pursuits and Draco hadn’t realised how much he had missed. When was the last time Lotty made him food and kept it warm for him? She’d much more likely recook an entire meal instead of using magic. She’d never do this either. Harry was a little too much like how Draco’s tea had been the last few days.
Not yet, anyway.
“I can look up a few things, at the office, y’know.” Harry reminded him. Moran. Moran could have had one or two of his allies there. The Artefacts were hidden but would he threaten Siobhan if he thought Harry would leave the Manor too? Why else would Moran have stayed away for so long? Attacking a house with Harry Potter was a mighty dumb move. What if this was Moran’s plan? Making the Healers back away, having Harry leave-- wait. If Moran knew Harry was ill then it wasn’t as great a deterrent, so why would he stay away?
“I don't normally see couples, and when I do they don't tend to have such turbulent history. You have quite literally been at the wand of the other countless times. And Draco I believe you've almost died. Twice. I can't say from what you've told me - how the animosity could go so easily...”
So, Draco stood on the upper floor, looking down, waiting for Hermione to finish her rounds and make her way upstairs so she could start her speech. This was always a boring time during the night. No one really liked the speeches, they were a means to an end. Unless Draco had done a terrible job those who would vote for Hermione’s incentive would do so without needing to hear a long winding speech about how it was the just and right thing to do.
Lunch was a meal Draco devoured. Hermione had arrived again, chatting animatedly with Siobhan and Draco ducked out of that conversation. When he returned to Harry, he was grumbling in his sleep. Only as Draco shut the door, Harry blinked awake.
“Harry, did you… cast a Patronus?” Trying not to look like a schoolboy eager for a distraction over homework, Draco returned to the previous line and scored it out, rewriting it over again to look busy. The words looked wrong.
“Nine.” Another spoonful and then Harry’s bloodshot eyes were back on him, “So, what happened?”
“How much do you know about Harry’s life, before Hogwarts?”
“I’m not whining.” He huffed. “Just take the Key back, I can just come home if I need money.”
“That would be very helpful. And it would be something only you could do. You’ve had the practise of doing it among the best of the best.”
“Go to hell. I told Hermione you wouldn’t say anything.”
First and only thing Draco would do in this house was to find a room to change out of this form. His wing ached worse than ever and he was hopeful to apparate out of this skip. He hopped off the post, Potter not bothering to re-secure him was a choice. One Draco knew was spawned by curiosity than ownership. Did he really think Fornax was just a regular owl? Draco hadn’t thought too much into the manners of owls before. The longest in this form was six hours. It was nearing the fourth day.
“Dad?” Scorpius sounded sad and for Draco who hated this place he couldn’t reconcile the two. Not really because his childhood was a whimsical spoiled affair and by the end the Manor consumed those cherished memories too.
“Those aren’t good qualities of food but of a bed warmer.”
In response Harry hummed, “What’d you say?”
“I don’t want to die,” Draco said. He tried. He didn’t hear himself say it so maybe he’d simply thought it. Maybe he was going to die right now, for the tragic irony Fate liked to flout in her stories. To die once being safe.
“If, he says.” Blaise shook his head, sat next to him and motioned for Draco to show his arm. He did, not enjoying the way Blaise twisted his arm round, "Just drink when I say so," and Draco looked over the vial again. It did not look pleasant to drink. A small blessing that it was no more than a cup-worth. He could down this in one go.
“--I might have secrets, some you might know, Nott. But trust me when I say this,” Draco leaned closer, pulled on the drawstrings of his ruffled cloak and smiled, “The Prophet will be more eager to hear of your philandering ways than Pansy’s.”
“I would rather bury Zabini under the patio.”
Draco was aware Siobhan had done this before. Goven was an alias but he now had to wonder as she took no issue with holding onto his arm and still walking down the stairs with large heels, that she was somehow related to a pureblood family. Unless they taught her these skills at that school of hers.
No one said Harry didn’t have baggage and Draco couldn’t complain much because his might as well have been a warehouse of emotional hung-ups. Really, he could understand in a sense, copying over behaviour from an old relationship to another. It wasn’t fair. Bloody hell this wasn’t fair at all. To be accused like he’d ran around dropping Potters name at every chance. He done it once before even Potter had started his flirting nonsense.
“Stay put. Unless of course the Manor falls down.” Lotty made a sound of pure horror at the suggestion and Draco smiled at the poor thing, she never did get his more pessimistic humour. He excused himself, but stopped at the threshold and decided to play it safe.
A glance managed to the see the trees outside, windows larger than any door and-- Opraceius Manor did not have a roof in the same regards as houses did. It breathed new life into rooms necessary and wanted. A new staircase flittered to life, extending up and pleased tingles of magic washed over him. Good, a place to go.
"You are being honest today"
Of course he was. He was a pure blooded wizard that had collaborated with Voldemort, how could he
"You didn't defend yourself?"
Without looking Harry knew Draco was tense at his side, scared even. He wanted to reach out and touch his hand, let him know it was going to be okay. He didn't.
Safety was something he wasn't used to. From a young age those that should've given him comfort and safety only hurt him and left him alone, right now he was given all of that by someone that should be hurting him. Life was weird.
"No" Harry frowned, what if Draco didn't want him finding out about his birthday? It was crazy. There was no reason to hide something like that. Especially considering they would... Be together for a long time, right? They were both bound to know each other's birthday, and possibly every single skeleton they kept in their closets. Oh, boy. Sometimes the weight of having a relationship struck him, but not in a bad way. Not exactly. It was almost as if something in his head said:
"Yes" Draco kept his eyes on the darkness beyond the window's glass. "I guess so"
"Me too. Who starts?"
"Don't mention it"
"It's alright... or maybe not. I don't know, really. I hate not knowing"
"Yes" Draco opened his bag, and pulled a blank paper, placing it on the space between their books "I..."
If anyone had told Harry a couple of years back that he would be willingly - and happily- following Malfoy around Hogwarts without really knowing where they were going, he would have laughed for hours. Yet here he was, staring at the back of a blonde head while quietly moving from hallway to hallway trying to avoid ghosts and prefects.
"Hi, Bea"
Draco frowned, looking at one of his fisted hands underneath the table, he hadn't even realized he was doing that. With a sigh, he relaxed it, staring back at Lucius. "I've seen a of things, father. I-"
Harry smirked "Sure, Draco. Whatever you say"
wizarding world.
Knowing Malfoy, if he felt accused he would probably say some really uncomfortable things and that could not go well for him.
Oh. Ron frowned looking back at Harry. What? Had he gone with
"Don't give me the whole hero of the wizarding world shit, Malfoy" Harry didn't want to sound angst-y but he didn't feel exactly great at the moment and the idea of Malfoy seeing him like a
"Fine. Just a headache" it was partially true anyways.
Harry chuckled "I think you are just scared of loosing" There was something oddly comforting in their old rivalry and he could see Draco try to suppress a grin.
"Did something happen?"
Harry hummed, pressing him a bit closer to his body, and kissed the top of his head. "I didn't think I would live long enough to get married..."
Enjoy!
Lucius focused on him again "She seems to think that you are afraid of me"
Ron made a guilty face and looked away. Wow.
Harry knew the last bit was a lie, he was a light sleeper and a simple push would make him wake up immediately. He was glad the boy had let him sleep, actually. The writing on the piece of paper was so neat and pretty Harry wondered how someone could get that good at something so silly like writing.
Yeah, Draco knew exactly how many letters he had. They arrived on mondays, wednesdays, fridays and twice on the weekends. And he was unable to answer. There were many reasons, but how to put them into words? They were clear to him every time he held his quill and tried to press it against the parchment.
"I am aware you two are not sleeping in your bedrooms" Draco got a bit paler "The School has strict rules about this sort of thing, and after the attacks we cannot allow something like this to happen. Do you understand?"
There was no point in delaying the moment, so with a heavy heart Draco started walking towards the living room.
to see his reaction. Merlin.
"It's okay... We should be going anyways"
She looked up, looking extremely exhausted. Harry almost got the impression that she was completely spent, unable to get angry or sad or... He could understand that numbness. He sat on a chair next to her bed, where he assumed Noah had been sitting and stared at her. It wasn't easy to talk to someone that had had her wand pointed at both him and Draco, with the intent of possibly hurting them. But, at the same time, he didn't hate her. Not one bit.
Draco swallowed, unsure of what to say or how to say it. "This is who I am" his father frowned at his words but said nothing "This is what I want"
" She smirked, quick on her feet "What do you need of me?"
"Are you implying the aurors are involved?" Ron looked at him in a way it made Harry feel uncomfortable. He still remembered the argument they had had and the things he heard Ron tell Hermione. His best friend was still not okay with Draco -and that was fine- but being caught in the middle was a horrible sensation.
He nodded. "Of course, I-... I will support you in any way that I can"
"It's not alive" Draco said, standing straight and looking at the thing "Nothing will truly hurt it"
Did his friends not see that?
They had shared kisses and some moments during the rest of the week, but it hadn't been enough. Luckily that weekend was the last Hogsmeade trip and they had already decided to have diner there. Harry wanted for them to spend the night there, but it would take some sneaking around. Nothing too difficult, considering teachers and students slept late on the weekends.
Walking back to Slytherin he carefully avoided hallways crowded with people, he had investigated the castle enough during sixth year to know where to go if he wanted to be sneaky. He still wondered how Harry managed to... Find him so many times that year. Hm, maybe he could ask him.
"Why don't you come with me?"
Bell laughed, with cruelty and didn't let him go. He was surely using some sort of spell, Harry realized the way Draco was sitting wasn't normal. He was incredibly still on a simple wooden chair.
"They are not going to leave you alone" Draco said stretching on the bed like a cat before sitting with his back against the wall. "It's not a big deal, Potter, let them. You are avoiding them anyway"
Draco smiled "I'll think about it"
"Potter!" Draco threw the wand across the floor to him, it was a risky thing to do but the creature didn't seem smart enough to try and stop the wand from reaching him.
Harry sat up too, but didn't touch him. No one should touch a snake that's ready to defend itself.... Or a Dragon that's scared.
Draco felt sick. Sick at what she was saying, yes, but the thought that truly made him want to puke was how she was trying to manipulate him through her 'comforting' presence. Was he just a pawn to them?
"How come you are here and not out there? I am sure you got some offers"
"Hm, shut me up"
"Just... something"
Draco had touched his knee before leaving, a strong squeeze that they both knew what it meant: 'meet me later'
"I have things to do, Potter" Draco smiled to reassure him "Look, I'll meet you after... Herbology?"
A little voice inside his head told him his father would hear about it and there would be hell to pay but he silenced it. What hell would his father make him endure now? The memories from the war were enough to keep him awake for years.
Harry started stacking the books they had already gone through, placing the others inside his bag. He could feel the boy's eyes on him the whole time.
Draco wasn't going to lie and say everything was okay, or that everything would be okay. His parents were dead and nothing was going to bring them back and nothing was going to change how his life had been. Draco frowned and walked forward again, hugging him tightly. Without thinking much about it, he placed a hand on Harry's hair, and another on his back just to keep him steady.
"I was a bully as well, Harry" Draco whispered "But I think there might..."
Neville nodded and gave him three parchments filled with drawings and notes on belladonna. Thank Merlin. Draco loved potions and he was quite capable of remembering which plant did what, but he was uninterested in learning about the plants' life cycle or whatever. He wasn't going to be raising the plants, he would buy whatever he needed and be done with it. Still, if he wanted to... Even consider pursuing a career in potions he needed an Outsanding in Herbology as well. And he knew exactly who was the best to help him: Neville.
"Doesn't make it easier"
"Sure" Harry knew he wasn't welcomed there, and he really wanted to get away from Lucius' gaze. He suspected Draco didn't want to be left alone with them either, but at least McGonagall would be there with him.
"No, it's supposed to give you what you need... I think it's broken. We hurt it"
"Harry" he panted, short kisses being shared in between moans, hands touching, knowing, pleasing. Sometimes he would kiss Harry's neck, or feel Harry do the same and his body almost felt about to explode in a million pieces.
Harry found himself pushing past the students to the front of the crowd, not to stare but to try and help the teachers and Madame Pomfrey. He was so used to people trying to murder him and things going wrong that it almost felt good to see everything fall into place again. Almost. Seeing that kid there... There was so much grief already, and someone was causing more? Harry wasn't sure about his future, but in that moment he wished to be an auror to stop anyone from hurting anybody ever again.
Draco shrugged, holding his gaze "That's why you went to the trials?"
Draco was sitting on the floor, playing with the little boy was barely over a year and was an orphan. Harry felt his throat ache. Had he looked like that? Back then?
and yeah she's cool but... You have to meet a lot of people, nurses, other doctors, employees... And they'd look at my ID and use the
Ginny frowned while giving him a
"We can fix it"
"But you just said-..."
"I know something's going on" She started, not looking at him. Her red hair moved with the wind making it hard to see her face, but she didn't seem to mind at all "And I won't push you. I know... we are family, Harry" She smiled, walking towards the school's lake. "And I know you will tell me what's going on when you can"
"Yeah" Harry shrugged, finding patterns on the stone floor "You?"
"I knew it"
Harry looked at Draco in confusion but then he turned to the Castle and... Oh, fuck.
There was a sigh and Draco carefully folded the piece of parchment, placing it between two books before sending them all flying into his bag. Then, he laid down next to him.
) so he vanished it to the bottoms of his heart, for later. For a moment in time when he felt ready.
"You are never getting his... Stuff"
when someone gives you a compliment"
"Ah, yeah, thanks. I will talk to her" He said, with no intentions of doing so but trying to get Neville out of the way.
Noah rolled his eyes and focused his attention on Harry, the only one that hadn't been asked - or dared- yet. "Harry"
"You don't have to say it like you are disgusted" Draco sighed, why bother? "What am I saying? of course you are disgusted. Look, father, it's complicated. More than you'll ever know"
going to have a heart attack, that everything was fine.
"Wait, please... Don't"
"Are you still worried about helping them?" Noah toyed with one of the book's pages, looking at him.
Harry followed quietly, not wanting to say anything too incriminating and not really ready to explain everything but maybe he didn't have to.
She made a face, shifting uncomfortably in her seat. She had every reason to despise Malfoy, but Harry was almost sure she didn't. "Fine. But he has a better chance with us, obviously"
They should be, after what Voldemort had done, they should be but they weren't. Hm. Maybe that would change now.
"No, but... there has to be some good people in there. Like... me and Pansy, or Blaise"
"Have you talked to him?" Ron seemed cautious and his tone made him know he meant Draco.
"It's complicated, Potter"
Harry nodded taking a turn right and finding a dead end. Shit. They backtracked and took the right way this time, walking faster.
"Of course I do"
, but now? They have a reason to hate you. They don't really need a reason to hate me but this helps. If we were nobodies it wouldn't be so obvious, I suppose"
Ginny"
"What did you do?"
"You are being impossible, you know?"
"And you won't tell me"
"Yeah, you are"
Reaching the upstairs hallway was a relief, and Harry decided it was time to
Lucius kept his eyes on him, hands behind his back.
"Remember..." Noah said, laughing "that stupid dance they did, the year of the triwizard whatever?"
He heard nothing more after that.
Draco's hand was searching again, moving over his arm and touching more than it should, trying to find... something. Harry held his breath when the warm soft hand touched his own.
"I guess so"
"Excuse you?"
Even if he had tried to go back to being the Malfoy heir his father wanted so much, during The Trials everyone had been exposed for who they were. And the Malfoys weren't
Elliot was waiting impatiently outside Gryffindor tower, looking as if he hadn't slept at all during the night. It was odd, feeling much older than him. They only had, what? Two years of age difference and yet, Draco felt older. Much, much older.
Hermione sighed, giving an uneasy stare towards Ginny. Did everyone see her as a child? Draco didn't quite mind having the Weasley girl helping them. Well, he felt
Ron sighed and nodded, hugging her.
, but everything smelled like smoke and death. Draco touched the wool a little bit, accommodating it around his neck a little bit better while Harry walked in front of him. Harry clearly had a great memory and a sense of orientation because he was leading.
"I'll trust you, but if I end up in Azkaban it will be your fault"
"Then what, you know her?"
Hopefully you liked it! xx
and deep down he knew violence solved nothing. But, again, if someone instigated hate after what he had been through, he would probably lose his cool.
He knew they should try and sleep as much as possible, but they didn't. Instead, they talked and laughed until the sun came up.
"You know you can call her by her first name, right?"
"It's not that"
"It's fine" She gave him a look "I know you can't really play Quidditch this year or anything but would you like to train later this week? I could use the tips"
"Yes. Her wounds are self inflicted, at least the ones on her arm. It seems this was not another attack but... a suicide attempt, Minerva"
Harry revealed himself, folding his cloak while shaking his head even if it was pointless: Malfoy wasn't watching him. The chat with McGonagall had not gone well, clearly, but how bad had it been?
"Apparently people tried to uncover his... mark" Ron saw how Hermione touched the place where Bellatrix had hurt her. He moved to the couch next to her and placed a hand on her lower back. It was hard not to remember the war. Or the way she had screamed. How could Harry forget and go be friends with
"I don't think Malfoy is going to be joining us" Harry used a hand to rub his face. He had screwed up. And he knew he had to go and apologize.
"I want to..." Malfoy said, eyes on the red curtains surrounding the bed "to talk about Cedric... About fourth year"
"Yeah, sorry"
"Are you serious? Did you not see it? It's
"You will do no such thing. You will give him to me, we can settle this. You and I”
He knew Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy knew about them, and that meant they would, undoubtedly, have a say in their relationship. He tightened his grip around Draco. He hoped the slytherin would be strong enough to face them, but he also hoped they wouldn't harm him too much. Harry knew how much he had endured and... It was unfair to put him through even more stuff.
"I wanted to speak to you, professor"
Draco gave a dry laugh "I doubt the Weasleys want me over... Or the Ministry"
"I still think you are a snob, but yeah"
. Draco loved him, and there wasn't a moment in the day he didn't want to be around him.
to. Harry had trusted him with this and he... he had to deliver.
Harry felt the floor give from underneath him "You... Planned this?"
"Do you know how she's doing?"
"What? Really? Never?"
"It wasn't... It isn't my place. I don't know the full story, do I?" There was a small curve on her lips "I just... I want to explain myself"
Harry sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Can anyone explain a bit better? Draco, could you just...?"
"You were searching for me?" His tone was mocking and Harry almost wanted to snap but didn't.
“Excellent” He smirked, taking one of the vials and looking at it for a few seconds “I had hoped to have more fun with you two” He said, shrugging “But I guess I need to focus on what's important”
, you are insane"
"I'm not
People stared an unfair amount, but that had been the bulk of it. He wondered if they were scared of facing Harry Potter, who was undoubtedly a powerful wizard.
Harry sighed, a small headache starting to make his life unbearable "We just want to know if anyone knows anything. We think someone is targeting non death eaters, and trying to frame it as if Malfoy or someone like him did it."
Harry frowned, wasn't that obvious? He was about to shrug, as he always did to avoid something, but he could see the subtle change in Draco's demeanor: he was nervous, insecure even. It was strangely endearing.
"You were quiet"
Draco shrugged, resting his shoulder against one of the bed posts. "Sometimes I think I do... But I don't think he knows, not really"
Draco wanted to say so many things, but before he could open his mouth, the office's door opened and the Headmistress strode in, a frown on her face. He imagined it couldn't be easy to be polite to a bunch of Death Eaters, even if he felt like she thought a bit better of him.
He nodded "Yes"
"I truly think we shouldn't..."
"Elliot, are you okay?" Harry asked, a worried undertone in his voice.
Elliot knew they only had a few moments to get something out of her before she put some excuse and decided to leave.
"Us having to seat out here just because those
Damn it. Draco twisted his head back to the cool floor. At least this was comforting, this non-marble, non-cobblestone ground. The curse was on his left wing, he was sure of it. The pain was severe there for days. Leaching into the rest of him like an owed favour.
“Maybe my hearing’s going too. What’d you say?”
“Can I send him a message? As you.”
“I mean sure, but joking about it-” Ron scrunched up his nose. “It’s not like everyone made it out without a scratch that day. They were definitely coming to kill you and anyone who thought to get in their way.”
He sat up as Harry shoved the – another bloody box! – to him. “I suppose this is acceptable,” he mumbled, not eager to let Harry know his mouth watered at the very smell. Unlike a conversation which lingered regardless of what he was doing, Draco and Harry were quiet as they ate. Draco wasn’t sure he could go any quicker without losing some of his engraved eating habits.
"What are these monstrosities exactly?" He scowled at them. Harry didn't get it. Not at all. Draco stabbed him in the thigh with a finger.
Meek wasn’t what a Malfoy was - no longer, not with Voldemort gone. He could return to Hermione’s Office and grab the form from her desk. But he wouldn’t. Maybe he should move permanently to France and retire of his political games. What could he do? Return and face Hermione? Or go home and deal with Potter? Failing to pick the document up was the more embarrassing of the two. Home it was. He’d send her an owl later, not that she hadn’t noticed already.
Harry sounded like he was struggling too. He ran his thumb over a small forgotten patch under Harry’s jaw, unshaven and rough against his skin.
“Play nice.” Three thumps against the door and Draco stilled. Had they heard Harry speak? Had they heard him? “What’s wrong now?”
About time. Lotty handed Draco the letter, along with an anxious look to his feet where Decimus curled.
“--think you getting me a crup did—”
“It was a nice cloak. She loved it.” The words were too much and Draco tried not to seem too happy over the gift being well received. But with all good things, Potter had to ruin it by staring at him. Not that Draco could see it, but he could feel the pressure on the side of his face and he made a point to ignore the man. “Are you two arguing again?” Luna spoke with such a dismissive tone, Draco had an instinct to defend himself against it.
“We’ll talk after Harry’s better. Sorry, Harry. I’m so sorry.” Charlie chanted and Draco went to turn Harry’s head, away from the violent and gruesome scene of the bloody leech and his mangled arm and close his eyes. Blink rate should go up under times of stress and pain. Now it explained why he hadn’t shut them. Charlie pulled it away only after Siobhan cut away a tiny part of flesh that was stuck in the leeches’ teeth.
Not too tight, Draco nipped at Harry’s finger. Not enough to even scratch at his skin but Harry yelped and looked at him.
What was he supposed to do?
“Other than go out of my way to kill all my other relatives you mean and be the head of the family?” Blaise scoffed, rubbed his face and for the first time Blaise didn’t look so well-put together. “We were gonna pretend Nott got kidnapped, killed – something big enough for the papers. But the Vault Key. We wouldn’t be able to use ‘em then. There is one way, I suppose.” Rubbing at his neck, he slid off the column and shrugged with one shoulder. “If you were in this situation, would you do whatever it takes?”
This batch of butterbeers was pretty potent. Neville’s face was blotchy in the heat and Harry didn’t fare much better. “Do you really like Harry?”
What Draco could only wish for was Theo and Blaise weren’t as smart as they assumed and the Aurors would catch up to them quicker than they expected. The idea flickered in his head - he could hurt Blaise and Harry couldn't do a thing, Theo couldn't do a thing and yet-- He stayed put, glaring and wanting and wishing he was a killer to murder Blaise right there - in front of his son. If Scorpius had died, Draco didn't doubt his rage would simmer but with him at his side, nattering away, this was enough for now.
Draco didn’t have time for this.
“He’s a Deatheater's son, that’s a fact.” The bravado was still there, just not quite so confident now. “And his dad should be in Azkaban.”
“One-fifty.”
“I’m fine.” Harry sounded far from it and Draco wasn’t equipped with much bedside manner. Not with the Manor babying him - a series of images of warm beds flickered in his head. No. Not yet.
‘Excuse me?’ Draco paused in eating, watched Harry and his lies. “We aren’t even passed the middle-aged mark yet.”
"Who's Boris?"
“Why would he do that when he could just use the map?”
He nudged the crup with his foot. “I’ve a plan.” Decimus sat at attention, listening.
He hopped onto her arm and she made a meandre to Harry’s office taking her time in order to give heartfelt compliments. Little weird, but Draco assumed she was sane enough and she knocked before opening it herself.
“We’re kinda in the middle of something.” For the first time, Harry’s good mood flagged and Draco’s poor mood plateaued. Now, he had thought Harry was far too happy to see this Muggle, who hung over him and chatted only to him. A lie Draco even feel for - Ginny was right, Harry could lie. Not for very long, going by how he grimaced and scowled and tried to redirect any attention towards Draco back at him.
Well.
“Harry, I’m going to need you to tell me which of these apply to you.” Harry made no acknowledgement he’d heard. “Do you hear things? See things you don’t want? Thoughts that just -- appear out of nowhere?” Draco pried Harry’s hands away and asked again, and again until Harry bowed into himself. Only now, he latched onto Draco’s wrists and Draco felt his bones nearly crumble under the pressure.
“Seven years? Albus was still in Hogwarts,” Ginny scowled, and Draco didn’t know what he’d done to cause it. “When Albus stayed over the summer, at your – the Manor – Albus and Harry’d had a falling out. We didn’t even agree it was a good idea. But I thought giving them some space would help.”
Draco felt the way Harry said those words. Not happy, not keen to leave and yet with no reason to stay he was ushered to the door. Yet Head Auror found a trapdoor, voice booming and making both Trainee and Harry jump into action.
“If you interfere, I’ll go to the Minister.”
“Sorry. The house didn’t deliver the message.” He dusted off some extra Floo powder and wandered the Manor, Scorpius in tow. Whatever he assumed was going to happen in his departure, brief as it was, nothing had happened. The rings stay levitating in their box and not a scratch was around the plinth.
Cooking Class did nothing new. Nothing Draco hadn’t done to the innards of beasts for his potions. He didn’t like the idea of having too many spices in his foods. Beside him Neville threw everything in till Draco could take a bite and breathe fire.
For the next few weeks, I'll be uploading what I'd done with the little breaks I managed. I will be making edits in previous chapters too, as I'll be rereading them shortly to make sure everything's consistent and I haven't forgotten some minor plot info.
Turns out the early summer cold wasn't that but an awesome combo of allergies and food poisoning that came on at different times. Do not recommend having both at the same time. 100% 100% now though. I took a few days just to make sure my head was on tight before starting the chapter (didn't want to make continuity errors).
“That one’s not going fast.”
And then Harry nodded, looked away and Draco dunked his head under.
What a show off indeed.
“I promised I would. So, now you won’t be totally alone in this house once Scorpius leaves.” Once he leaves too, Draco heard the lilt of worry but Harry was beaming and a rush of excitement at the possibility--
Returning the tray and the food upon it to Lotty would upset her, damned Harry was no doubt aware. Well, he supposed eating wasn’t the victory in itself. Forcing Harry to leave didn’t feel like the usual win but he’d take it. He had no time to brew Harry’s medicine, learn what he needed and consider Harry’s affections. It was all very…
“Don’t worry. You’re a Slytherin, you look good in green.”
“So you are pitying me.” As if a reward for sussing that out, Harry took another mouthful and Draco urge to leave dwindled. He regarded Harry again not sure how to respond. Harry wasn’t entirely self-absorbed or naive to the world. He was able to, in some way push conversation to where he wanted them to go. Aurors must have some form of interviewing or interrogation lessons.
Scorpius shrugged, “Sure, dad, they aren’t really my style-” his disregard was alarming as was it ridiculous. Draco grabbed onto his son’s shoulder and made sure he knew exactly what Draco meant.
“Holy shit!” Ron’s roaring laughter made it all too obvious the heat on his face was noticeable. “Neville, you have to tell us. Forget it, tell me.”
Lotty appeared, head poking through the wall. “Harry Potter has re-arrived.” Lotty twisted on an ear. “Will Lotty let Harry Potter back in?”
Harry was slipping out of his seat and, if anyone else saw how Harry was far too eager upon seeing him they might be in trouble. “I’ll need to apparate Draco home--”  and there were better lies to sneak away, more obvious lies. Less lies that made Draco seem like a lightweight.
“You’ve had your tongue in my mouth, a date isn’t much.”
He sat in silence, eyes closed letting Luna’s presence calm him. Don’t make him see his face right now. He couldn’t cope. He didn’t know how to fix anything. How can you fix someone who didn’t think they needed or deserved it?
He licked his lips and tried to focus on what he was expected to say, but all that popped into his heads were more sensationalised headlines. 'Death Eater Ruins Potter Marriage', 'Malfoy Corrupts Boy Wonder,' 'Harry Potter Under Impervious,' and he couldn't let go of the paranoia that Harry wasn't serious, not really, not even as Harry was saying otherwise. “You have more money, political clout and reputation than I have. You should find someone else if you want someone other than Ginny.”
Since their time seemed limited, Draco sighed. Fine.
“Elise Middleton. No employment records, no relatives, no friends. But has a swanky place. As it turns out, she has a letter from our resident Deatheater discussing services rendered.” He seemed proud of his assessment and wanted nothing more than Harry to sign the parchment that floated to his desk.
“It has no feelings or thoughts. No opinion unless I give it one to pursue. It has no will of its own.”
“Right,” Draco said as he left Lotty to feed Potter.
To spell it down would be pointless. What did Draco even have in it? He couldn’t brew any potions, he hadn’t the time. And the only potions were--
“If you dare ever, I mean ever, try and give me this – this fluff – again, it’s not food – it’s disgusting – and it’s sticky – why is it sticky? Merlin, this is the worst – Shut your mouth, Potter.”
“What do Muggles even have in their zoos?” Neville frowned, and shoved the bottle, larger than his pocket into it. It thumped into something else before disappearing completely.
“What was the name of the Transport they drove into battle?”
Potter actually produced his wand for spellcasting this time.
But Harry made a point to offer to go to see another movie and Draco wondered if he’d started to be influenced by the strange puffs which tasted too buttery, too salty and yet ultimately something Draco had finished by the end of the movie. And he wanted them again.
And then all hell broke loose.
"Vault 521. Get out, please."
Harry smiled as he placed four plates on the counter and opened the fridge. "Sure, why not? Al said he wanted to see her, too, and since she's not gonna be back for another week, what say we go this weekend and surprise her?"
"We'll come again, Gram'ma!" Albus and James chorused as Harry helped them into the Floo.
"It says here that I'm going to have to sign another form after you give me an introduction?"
Ron frowned. "Yeah?"
The duo looked up from Lily's bed, where they were playing some sort of hand game. "We're fit as a fiddle, so can we go out and play, now?" James piped up, climbing out of bed.
Harry rose to his feet, a rush of joy flooding through him, and he had to hold back the urge to crush the blond in a hug as he yelled, "They've found them! They found your son!"
"Well," she drawled, coming around the desk to stand beside his chair. "The kids are asleep…"
here, too!"
doing here?"
Once he felt solid ground beneath his feet, Harry coughed for a moment, out of habit, and stepped out, looking around to find the familiar face.
He took a moment to observe the boy and get his thoughts straight. The child was definitely around seven or eight years old, and Harry's suspicions were confirmed as he watched him scarf down the bread. His appearance was even worse on second glance: he was far too thin and pale, he wore only a single layer on a cold, November's evening, and his sandals were falling apart and were too small for his feet.
"No," he said, focusing on his food. "It's nothing."
Making his way up to the kitchen, he intended to grab a bite to eat and disappear into his room without a sound, but, as luck had it, his mother had the perception of a female dragon guarding her egg.
The other wizard's expression shifted to a more mellow one, even bringing out that mild smile of his that had stunned Harry the first time around. "Well, that… is an interesting thought, no doubt," Malfoy said, and Harry could've sworn he could hear the wry laughter in the man's voice if it weren't for his calm expression. "But why don't we focus on
"No! You have to go to work!"
“Wow, you haven’t changed one bit, have you?” Potter grinned. “I was banking on you being shocked for long enough that I could just get you to sign the agreement and we could make this official right away, but I guess I underestimated you.”
"Blimey, Harry, you've even started to
"Don't be silly, Harry, of course I wanted to come. There's no way I would refuse when Ginny asked me, now, would I?"
"Draco…"
At the very bottom, almost swallowed up by the frayed edges, was a single, incomplete sentence in slanted, elegant handwriting. He assumed it was Narcissa's, but only when he saw Malfoy's name did he realise it wasn't. Curious, he squinted as he tried to decipher the faded writing.
Draco stared at him, belatedly realising that Harry still had his arms around him but feeling relief in the warmth of his embrace. "How are you so unfazed by all this?"
Placing the photo on the table, Harry stared at it unseeingly, barely noticing the tears falling down his face. He was too afraid to flip it over. He was too afraid to see what message was written on the back.
"You're
I move aside as an elderly couple exits the bus and step on board, swiping my travel card against the electronic ticket reader in a hurry, intending to head to the back of the bus.
needed you to take the week off. Your constant jittering and overcompensating were driving the whole department mad."
Nothing.
"The boys found it in the garden; I'm not sure what it is, yet," Harry said quickly, making to grab the pouch from her hand.
"Re—Realm?" Harry blustered as Draco escorted him out of the sleeping chamber—or, rather, an ornately decorated birdcage, whose design Harry decided not to question—and down into the garden itself.
"Will you help me if I were to tell you that this is a memento from the Second Wizarding War?"
"I would offer it to you, but our staff wouldn't be too happy about that."
"Stop being paranoid," he scolded himself, turning back to the parchment—although he couldn't shake off the feeling that someone was watching him.
Unsure of why exactly Ginny had such a hard time telling him this story, he frowned and nodded.
there, taking away every last bit of my broken heart."
Weasley threw his arms in the air, shaking his head in disbelief. "Nothing to do with anything, he says!" He directed his rage at Draco once again. "Why'd you decide to suddenly become friends, eh? I can't believe it was just because Harry asked."
Just as Dyers disappeared out the door, an Auror, whom he recognised as Buxley's right hand, poked his head in. "Sir, the papers?"
Barely managing not to spill the scalding liquid on himself, Harry gingerly placed the cup back and stared up at the pretty blonde who had her hand outstretched towards him. She raised her eyebrows when he didn't take it, and Harry blustered, grabbing it and shaking it awkwardly. She smiled as she settled in her seat and beckoned to the same brunette waitress.
"I'm… not sure," he admitted finally, and Malfoy nodded as though he'd reckoned as much. "Why? Do you think it means something?"
"I'm only saying," Mr Simpson said, hesitant, looking towards Astoria for support, "having Aurors searching the place won't look too good for the exhibition, Professor."
The first witch waved a hand in impatience. "Oh, what does it matter who said. One of the Aurors, they was standing outside the ladies room—a rather odd place to stand for some idle chatter, I thought—and one of them was shaking his head and saying, 'He hung himself by his shoelaces, mate. We didn't get a peep outta him'. I'm telling you, Bernice, Macnair is dead!"
He scoffed at that. "Typical. We're all dying to find an excuse to get out of work, and here you are, having to be literally thrown out."
A disembodied voice announced the arrival of the lift, and Harry stepped aside as the door opened and the occupants poured out, some smiling or greeting Camilla as they passed by her. Once they were inside the lift, Camilla gave him a brief run-down of everything he had seen and of where they were headed. He listened attentively, nodding every now and then when she glanced his way.
He watched as the blonde's eyes went round once he introduced himself and hoped that she'd paid attention to whatever he'd said after that. "Of course," she squeaked, and then cleared her throat, seeming embarrassed. "Of course, sir. When would be a convenient time for you?"
George generally let his and his siblings' children use some of the less dangerous prototypes just to see their reactions and get their opinions on what they liked or disliked, or what could be added or removed. He used these inputs and made changes, because with the rather wide age-range of the next generation Potter-Weasley children, it helped him and Ron formulate merchandise for their target audience and devise appropriate marketing strategies, especially now that they were about to convert Zonko's into a second shop in Hogsmeade.
"They seem to have had fun."
"Er, thanks," Harry said, letting Draco lead him to the centre of the circle.
Scorpius called, bouncing on the spot, his impatience evident.
Malfoy chuckled. "Do you want to know the actual reason I put Scorpius there?"
Sighing, he called for a waiter and ordered a cup of black coffee. The girl who'd served him before arrived with his order five minutes later, shooting him an odd look as she replaced the empty cup on the table with the full one. He thanked her, and she bustled away, greeting the customer who had just walked in. Picking up his coffee, Harry eyed the overcast sky from his seat by the window and wondered if it would start raining again. He had been soaked by the time he had found the café half an hour earlier.
His heart beginning to race, Harry asked, "Are you telling me that Lisanna Barkridge's arrival in London wasn't a coincidence?"
"I don't understand you."
She caught his arm before he could walk away and gave him a searching look. "How are the nightmares?"
"OK?"
"I'm so sorry," he says in a rush, bending over to pick up whatever he had dropped and shove them into the wicker basket slung over his arm. "I'll pay for your shoes; I really am sorry."
Apparently, both things were inevitable now, and his opinion on the issue didn't matter one bloody bit.
"Good." Harry watched Neville, waiting, knowing that there was something else the other man wanted to say.
"Yes, ma'am," Ron said as he shoved the bags in, piling them one on top of the other.
"What?" she demanded.
Chuckling to himself, he finished his muffin and downed the last of the coffee. He could hear Lily shrieking as she ran up the stairs, and Ginny's voice as she tried to placate the little girl. He reached forward, gingerly opening up the tattered piece of cloth the object was wrapped in. Curious, he peered at what looked like old photographs, now faded and worn.
"Miss Audrey has been informed of your arrival," the young witch said with a little bow, motioning to the door. "This way, please."
He wondered if he should pretend like it wasn't just to tease her but decided against it. Knowing Hermione, she'd probably make a new batch and force him to stay till they were done so he could taste-test them for her. "It's amazing! Who knew, huh?"
his brain supplied helpfully.
"And this is…?" he asked awkwardly when the young witch continued to watch him with eyes filled with anticipation.
"Well," Harry said, "for starters, whoever targeted Lisa today and allegedly stole the blueprint not only knew that she was here, in London, but also where she was staying,
"So you've decided what you're going to do with it?"
The large streamer fluttered and then hovered in place. He slowly raised his wand till both ends were level and then nodded.
She offered him a small smile. "No, it's alright. I know you're only trying to help."
"Sorry 'bout that, I ended up falling asleep," Harry apologised.
"Oh, I hope so." He laughs nervously. "I haven't really had
Neville needed this more than anybody else, he knew. The man deserved what little peace of mind this whole experience would get him, and if Harry could help, he would do it without being asked twice. Neville was someone who had gone through so much because of and for Harry—he couldn't even begin to imagine what sort of nightmares he'd had when he thought of all the torture Neville had been put through.
he said to the Ginny in his head, scoffing when mental-Ginny rolled her eyes and shrugged.
"Sorry," he said as he dodged the mop. "I usually sleep on the sofa in my office. It's been a while since I slept here."
Ignoring his disdain, she walked up to him, making sure not to step on his mess, and held out what looked like an official notice.
"I never meant to stay for a whole week, anyway," Ginny began before he could say anything. "I was only going to go with her until George and the kids arrived for the surprise and leave the day after. But I thought it'd be fun to surprise you and the kids too, so I thought why not, and asked Hermione to help."
"Who's the smarter one, now, eh?" He waggled his eyebrows, and he could swear that Pig rolled its eyes. The owl turned towards the snacks and Harry shrugged.
Harry stepped back and waited as the receptionist fumbled in the cupboard beneath the desk. He was surprised when she pulled out a device that looked almost identical to a Muggle telephone but was definitely magical, because of the way it distorted the space around it in the slightest. Intrigued, he watched as she dialled a number on it and pressed it to her ear.
He walked over to the coffee machine and poured the decoction into two mugs, heating them up with a quick spell and adding a dash of milk to them. Taking the mugs over to where Hermione was grumbling away, he placed hers on the desk and Summoned the box of croissants he'd brought from home because he'd left before breakfast.
"And?"
He sighed, too irritated to fold all the clothes, and magicked them into the suitcase. Picking it up, he walked past Hermione and strode down the stairs, swallowing thickly and willing himself to calm down. The day had barely begun, and he was already letting his insomnia get the better of him.
Harry shrugged, sipping his coffee. "I was never really going to cancel it because I'd booked the rooms and everything." A sudden thought occurred to him and he asked, "Wait is
He grimaced, feeling chastised. "You're right. I'm sorry. I should've handled it with more tact. I guess I was just annoyed that they simply waltzed in here without permission and behaved like they owned the place."
"Do what?" I ask, feeling a lump form in my throat, the answer to his question already resounding within me even before he says it.
"I'm not complaining," he grumbled, suddenly realising that Kingsley hadn't pressed any of the buttons.
Harry's mind told him, but he ignored it. "Right, yeah, but when do you
"Nobody wants that more than me and my lads, trust me," Harry said as Dyers rose to his feet. "Oh, and Hermione's taking the day off. Her son's sick."
"Potter?"
"Well, I guess you're not the only one pulling an all-nighter," he said as he placed the mug on the desk. "Mrs Weasley's still here finishing up the past week's paperwork too—with Gonsales."
His stomach growled again, and he sat up a little too fast, causing his head to spin, and a spell of sickness swept over him. Swallowing thickly, he slid off the narrow bed, placed his glasses on the bridge of his nose, and stared at the oddly familiar bookshelf in front of him.
Hermione nodded as she straightened her skirt. The enchanted voice announced their destination, and she turned to him. "Right, then."
to tell you all about my cases, trust me, but unfortunately they're confidential. So even if I wanted to, I couldn't tell you."
"What?"
"I can't thank you enough," he said, his voice trembling. He pulled away, his eyes moist with unshed tears. "I feel like every time I see you, you end up saving me."
"Come on, Draco," Pansy says, gesturing to the large, wooden signboard hanging behind me. "A flower shop called
Harry picked up his own cup and sipped, feeling a sense of calm settle over him as the warmth of the tea passed through him. "That happens, when you someone for the first time after over a decade," he replied, more to himself than to Malfoy.
He shook his head with a sigh. "Didn't have a choice in the matter. And I swear I had no idea how much more there was to it when I accepted the case."
Harry nodded and thanked Ron before pulling his head out. He remained on his knees for a long moment, lost in thought as he stared into the burning coals, and finally reached up to grab a handful of Floo powder. He tossed it onto the firewood, stuck his head in, and muttered, "Silver Sprigs Montessori."
The goblin took the keys, eyed them for a moment to make sure they were real, and handed them back to Harry. He then picked up his quill and wrote down something before jumping down from his stool and looking up at Harry.
He pressed the button and waited with two other Healers, half-heartedly listening in on their conversation to distract himself from thinking about Camilla and their lunch and his latest nightmare.
"Go away," Draco hissed, trying and failing to push Harry away in his still-weakened state, and Harry managed to pull the blond's hand away to see that the familiar facial features that mesmerised him had distorted to form a beak and stray feathers.
Fuck.
“Before Hogwarts, what’s the worst thing that ever happened to you?” The nonchalant tone grated.
“I’m not sure if I can diagnose your partner without him being here. Let’s focus on you.”
Of course, Draco was not impulsive as much as he’d like to be and calling on a crup and demanding its loyalty might be easy, incredibly easy all it taking a few works.
Oh. But Draco took a few seconds to lower it, the unsettling idea he wasn’t safe still present.
“Harry’s ill but I think we both know that he’s not the type to admit it. Tell me what you know and I’ll drag him to therapy myself.”
But bloody four seeds in total? Whether the fourth had bloomed or not was irrelevant.
Had the entire store of them been destroyed? Another worm at his neck and then another, and another. Groaning the images flashed across his consciousness so fast he was close to retching.
Whatever passed between them was lost and Draco rolled his eyes. He may as well get this over with and see what the two were scheming. It’s not as if his own mother would go against him.
Blaise was the worst brewer this side of the Channel. The night turned to a feasting extravaganza and Draco cursed him out as Lotty continued to cook and serve him meals throughout the wee hours of the morning. Tasteless and unfilling for the first few courses, Draco was tired of eating by the time his taste buds recognised flavour again. Draco knew the lack of sustenance would catch up with him but he expected a weak body and a irritable mind. Not, not this. Not this gurgling hunger that made him grimace and groan. Just end, just end soon, he’d resorted to asking after each cleared plate after cleared plate.
“Nothing happened,” Draco said as they left the stands. Nothing, no one, not a peep. Everyone had focussed on the match. Why would they bother with him? For so long, Draco assumed the same antagonising people would fling their comments towards him and his son and they’d never be able to watch a game in peace. Never. And so Draco had always avoided live matches, never once accepting any invitation by his son to go see any.
His eyes were the first to lose their alertness, then it was clear he wasn’t quite able to keep his head up. And by the third minute, Harry Potter was asleep, collapsed back on the bed. Harry’s limbs would twitch violently and recoil. Restless Limbs wasn’t the worst side effect but it might lead to other problems, cramp and pain being a possibility. Potion Number 1 would need refined. The mumbling started not long after and then Harry jerked awake, a shout in the air. Draco didn’t comment on the panic in his voice.
Thanks for reading! See you next update. <3
“Hope it’s okay for me to stay for a while, Mr. Malfoy.” Still in the habit of looking at his shoes in his presence.
Draco’s ears burned.
“Yeah, Alice.” His gut lurched, oh, yes. Obviously, Draco hadn't seen any names in the few Prophets Scorpius brought home. What was he expecting? A year without a word was obvious.
“Just so we’re on the same page.” Harry scratched at his head. “You don’t… mind, right? Me liking you.” A thought Draco could only assume as uncomfortable had him start to ramble as his face darkened and the nerves dampened down his question to almost an apology, “Just tell me and I’ll stop. I don’t want to be pushy. I know I am pushy but-”
“Children do this, Harry. Children.” Draco took a few steps back, and at the thought of Scorpius his eyes landed on his wedding ring. He twirled it on his finger, smoothed away the dirt until it shone bright again.
“Can I ask you something?” Draco hummed, not too keen on agreeing until he knew for sure what Harry’s end goal. And just as Draco was starting to unwind the bandage on his skin, Harry grabbed his wrist and Draco wanted to apparate.  “Do you always flinch when someone touches you?”
Instead of clambering to his feet, opening the door and letting Draco turn with ease, Harry scribbled on a piece of parchment with sluggish indifference. They weren’t even words. He halved it over nonetheless, stood and held it out alongside his arm.
For the first time, Draco would oversee what he was doing. Point to where the equipment he needed was kept. Ignoring the world outside, Draco took up a chair, read over some tome he hadn’t used much. He didn’t recognise the writing in the margins.
She did not just suggest that.
“Obviously, Potter, you’re late.”
Wait, what? Okay, that might have flustered Draco a bit. He tried to save himself with a cough and a sneer. Though those ever vigilant eyes were far too filled with nonsense to say he’d managed to recover in time.
“Wait for Ms. Goven.”
Harry beckoned him over, despite it only being a few paces away, Draco didn’t move. The machine popped. And popped and Draco spied something white fire up in the air and it managed to rouse Draco to sit up to watch.
“Still going to pretend you're not interested?”
“Just tell me what you want me to say.”
“They don’t have those...” Draco forgot the word, motioned for what he meant.
“Did this just come in?”
“So?”
But this story was a gift, so I tended to use a lot of tropes and (I believe?) fandom tropes that my friend likes more than anything else.
Luna slammed down the stamp on a hot seal before she finally starting speaking.
“What?” Draco gasped for air and his brain wasn’t quite up to speed for holding conversation just yet. What a time for a truth to spill out. What was he talking about? As if Draco needed to know he lied now of all times.
“I know the feeling.” Neville looked away, grim as if he’d heard the placating words false and fake. Draco carried on, “Astoria didn’t pass her days that peacefully near the end either.”
It wasn’t just Scorpius who flinched, Draco did too because he knew too. If Scorpius hadn’t opened up to Blaise, didn’t allow him such easy access to the Manor then It was probable Blaise never would have managed to find the Rings of Celius. And when Scorpius turned to see if Draco would reject what he was saying, well, Draco wouldn’t even if he wasn’t under the spell of agreeing with whatever Blaise wished. If Draco was lucky, Scorpius would take his silence as Blaise keeping him quiet and look no further into it.
It was easy to see when Draco had to leave him alone, when Draco would give a platitude: it was okay, it was fine – it did nip, the rejection. It wasn’t a rejection of him personally, at least that’s what Matthews tried to explain. And Draco would leave him if Harry needed it, but never actually leave him. The Mind-Healers were either all barmy and paid too much or paid not enough.
If I just suddenly disappear and stop uploading, it's because I've decided on mass uploading 'em so you don't have to wait "between" them anymore. No cliffhangers...like this one. There is a few chapters that are pretty long though so, might take a few weeks if I go down that route. :'D Either way, if it turns out I'm taking a while - I'll post some sort of comment on my Profile about progress, just so people don't think I've up and Vanished again. But out of the five chapters, I've done like 3 1/2 in terms of work, maybe closer to four. Got a few more scenes to do and some of them are kinda hefty so, might be a few days for them on their own. <3 Thank you for reading.
“You have my word, Scorpius.” Draco nodded once, and the trap to catch Moran and his interfering patrons was paramount now. Quickly, he must find everyone involved and cast them away from his family.
“Maybe.”
They pushed by everyone, Harry keeping his head down and charging forward, his bag of forced free goods held like a shield to plough through everyone and Draco being pulled along. If he let go, Draco would apparate back to his house because he wasn't sure he had anywhere else to go.
‘Why – Are – You –’ He scratched out the next attempt at words. He kept thinking of Blaise, of Theo.
As Potter placed his hand on the ground, the first tree bloomed - four seeds dropping with a pitter-patter before the tree itself was washed out of the world by the breeze. Most people made one or, if strong, two. Four without trying was rare. The burn in his gut was back. If this was Potter not trying, how many would he end up with?
“I want a cuddle too you know!” She’d tutted. And the memory faded, of Astoria rolling her eyes but perching on the nearby armchair to keep an eye on Scorpius - and to pick him up if he were to wake. And as she tutted the next followed, where Draco and Astoria were chatting, the memory fuzzy on what or why.
Okay. Not what he was hoping to hear.
He wasn’t sure what to think about the way Harry’s weight was so much more than what he was familiar, not when it was pushing him down on the bed and Harry started tugging at his trousers and-- a vicious bolt of panic stole his breath and he froze. “Stop- stop. Wait.” Draco just held Harry’s hands in place, not wanting him to move any closer. He couldn’t stop the uneven breathing, couldn’t stop the awful truth. (What was he doing?) Harry kept saying his name and Draco couldn’t bluff his way out of this any more. Trying to settle him, Harry tried to pull away but Draco didn’t want that either.
