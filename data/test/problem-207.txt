Draco was stiff in his arms, not melting into the bite like he normally did. It was a drastic change, one he knew was a harbinger for things to come. If he were a different man, he might have cared. But all Harry's body knew was
“And what a pretty leash it is,” Silvestri finished.
Potter swallowed hard, but didn't move toward him. His voice was raspy as he asked, "So you really did know it was me?"
She sits up straighter, letting her feet fall from the bench where she'd been half-reclined to the ground. "May I see?" It's a forward question, and she feels off-kilter for even asking, but off-kilter seems to be the norm whenever Neville's around. It's certainly something personal she would never ask anyone else.
"But you see, we have all the time in the world for that, don't we?" Harry breathes over Draco's lips again. "Because I don't think I'll ever be done with you."
Draco only turned when a shadow crossed his vision and looked up. Again, the age-old Malfoy lineage reared its head, cool and polite, as Draco’s eyes passed right over the scarred face and to rest on the haunted blue eyes. He offered a broad smile and a steady hand. “Draco Malfoy.”
Harry follows Malfoy down a maze of hallways and corridors, but his eyes can't be bothered to note the elegant surroundings of the Manor's interior chambers. His eyes are far too fixed on the way Malfoy's spine stands straight, and even more so on the curves of his arse are undulating beneath the fabric of his trousers.
“Fine!” Draco shouted after him. “But I swear to Merlin if I wake up and find you gnawing on me, I will hex your bollocks into next week!”
"It will keep her occupied," Harry concedes.
His smile was brief. “Eight hundred and twelve.”
“And Ginny? Where is she?” Bill opened his mouth again as Ron’s brows shot into his hairline.
Malfoy's lips purse. "A childhood nickname. One my mother is fond of. I swear," he sighs, coming over to lead Harry out the door. "It's like I'm six all over again."
Ron goes quiet, watching Harry with focused intent. His Auror face. He's calculating, deducing. Coming to a conclusion.
"What 'same'? He's the same he's always been—"
"Always."
The teasing from his mother has to be the last straw, because Draco's head whips around to seethe,
"I told you to go," Harry says with warning.
At that, something in his mind throws a switch, and suddenly he's seeing everything through a cloud. It's an angry red haze, a filter that shouts, a voices that whispers, and Harry feels the long-buried insecurities start to rise. With each lash of the crop, each exultant cry that escapes Draco's mouth, Harry feels the confusion set in. The pleasure that courses through him twists into an ugly, gnarled beast, sneering at him in disgust.
"I think they're going to be okay, don't you?" she asked.
He waves a hand in the air, and a small pulse of magic settles over them both. "There. If either of us feels the need to safeword, the scene stops. If you are bound or restrained in any manner, you will be released. Then we will talk about what happened and either choose to continue or end the scene altogether." He fixes Draco with a pointed look. "There is no shame in using it. There will be no consequences or repercussions. It is exactly what it implies: safety. For both of us. Understand?"
"Why are you here, Potter?"
“Bill.”
Potter shrugged. “I’ve slept in worse.”
"Are you hurt? Did he hurt you? Were you bitten? Did he scratch you? Did anyone else touch you? Did anyone else bite you? Did—"
"Those are Narcissus 'Rose of May' daffodils," Potter murmured over his shoulder. I know your mother was fond of roses, but these reminded me of her. I hope you don't mind."
heartbeat, idiot.”
Harry digs in his heels. "No," he growls, "you're not orchestrating this time. I'm not chasing him. If you want to interfere so badly, then you go work your magic on Draco. It's his eyes that need to be opened, not mine."
think is best for me. You've never trusted me to make the right decision." He opens his mouth to say something else, but snaps it shut at the last moment. "I'll owl you in a week or so."
would it have brought him here?" It's the sheer offense in Malfoy's words that makes Harry's head turn his way. "What in the hell would the Manor want with Potter, of all people?"
Harry raises a hand, taking great care to look Malfoy in the eye. "It's alright. I know this is an awful surprise for you both. I'm probably the last person you ever expected to see again."
"Don't set your robes on fire."
Harry's made quite the habit of startling Draco into speechlessness, and this time is no exception. He smiles with warmth at Draco's surprised expression.
. To prove himself. To show that he trusts Harry enough to let him know when he can come.
people'.
“You’re making a mistake here, Harry. I am not often inclined to indulge you, but with such a treasure in your grasp, how could I not alter the terms of my offer?” Silvestri continued his silent perusal of Draco. “He is beautiful—”
The smooth polish that normally coats his words is gone, and Harry hears the raw want that makes Draco's speech rough—almost common, really.
"Yes," Potter drawled, "because this life is exactly what I planned."
The thought is sobering and her hands give a tiny push against his biceps. His hold relaxes and he gently sets them apart. His dark eyes are glittering with arousal. His lips are full, slick, and red. He is so young, so handsome, and she
Millie looks chagrined. "Look, I got a robe on her, didn't I? There should be a medal in that, I think. Daft bint," she adds with a soft smile.
Harry waves a hand and wandlessly refills their glasses. "So you know your limits, then?"
"No. Because whatever is good between the two of you isn't wrong, as long as you're not hurting someone else in the process." He eyes Ron good to drive the meaning home.
The magic pinning him to the floor thrums in agreement.
Submission.
"I don't think she meant together," Harry chuckles.
Potter paled and his lip curled into a snarl. "Draco is fine." The vampire's words were forced out with vehemence.
"Harry, there you are." Narcissa's voice is fond as he strolls into the dining room. "I was hoping you would join us. It seems we've all gotten a late start this morning." Her face is open and bright, while Draco sits next to her, glowering at his plate.
Potter shot Ron a tentative smile. "Thanks."
Potter’s hand slashed through the air. “We go now, or we don’t go at all. I don’t go out in sunlight.” The finality in Potter’s tone came across through clenched teeth and a death glare.
"Oh?" Harry says with a raised eyebrow.
Harry raises higher on his knees, bearing more of his weight on his left arm. He's not squeezing any further, but rather letting his weight bear down on Draco in eased increments. His fingers curl, brushing against Draco's prostate, and he jerks upward on a strangled hiss. He pushes in harder with his fingers, faster, adding a third on the next upstroke. The pressure on Draco's body is tremendous, but so is the pleasure, he knows. All Draco has to do is lay back and take it.
Potter's face curdled, still heavy with remorse. Draco knew there were a multitude of pleas waiting inside that fanged mouth, but he was in no mood to let them be heard. His ire was far too great. Perhaps in days to come, it might cool, might abate enough to where his heart would entertain the possibility of accepting Potter's mea culpa, but certainly not now. Not while his heart beat with so much anger.
Hermione’s gaze was soft and searching as she let Ron ramble, but she stayed quiet.
Potter frowned at the obvious dismissal from the house-elf. “Make up the room across from mine for Draco. It’s his now.”
Harry slumps back in the booth. "Yeah, why not? I've got nothing else to do with my time. And I'm pretty good. Maybe I'll open a gallery, feature my own work as well as some local artists. You know Luna's got her hands in with her sculptures. They're not bad," he says, nodding to himself. "I think they'd sell."
"Ye—Yes, Harry." Draco sounds totally broken now and Harry smiles against his skin.
for this. He's still not certain if it's his magic, or the Manor, or a conspiracy of the two. He called for sanctuary. And this is what he got.
Hermione wound her arms around her husband's neck and chuckled against his lips. "Oh, Ron."
“What did you do?”
"I suppose we really are family, now," Draco said. "The wards recognize you."
Harry tamps down the shout he wants to let loose and fucks Draco harder.
"I don't know," Ron whines, slipping back down into the cushions. "It just happened. Hermione wanted to talk to her more about this new shop she's opening, and she invited her round." Ron glanced up at him. "We had her over for dinner. Then we had her on the kitchen table. And again in the sitting room. I think I fucked up my back. If this continues, it will likely kill me."
“How can you say that?” Harry hissed. “Because I would have, you know?” He glared at Ron, desperately wanting him to see the thing within so that he could understand. “I would have killed you.”
Harry ties the promised letter for Ron and Hermione to Pennywort's outstretched leg, pulling his fingers back in time to avoid being bitten—again. She's an adorable, spotted little thing with an unfortunate tendency to nip if the stroking isn't hard enough to her liking. A tad on the puffy side, she's squat with big moon eyes that look up at Harry with equal parts adoration and irritation. She's sweet enough, if a bit beaky, but she's a Malfoy owl, and Harry supposes that makes her high-maintenance on general principle. He looks into her eyes and purposefully doesn't think about Hedwig. He can never replace her, not ever, but he does think it's possibly time to consider her successor.
It's hard enough to keep her thoughts straight in the hot heaviness of the air, much less without having to stare at his perfectly-shaped backside. His shirt clings to the toned musculature of his back and upper arms, leaving no doubt that he keeps himself in shape. The white cotton t-shirt is damp in patches where the heat has gotten to him as well, and the hem has risen with his movements to settle just above his waistband, revealing a dark, inky something against the tan of his skin.
Draco picked up the photo and clutched it to his chest. “This is all I want. I don’t care what you do with the rest.”
The amusement is gone in a flash and the truth pours out of Harry like water. His eyes harden and he lays Draco flat with a stare. "Yes, I want you. But I'm not trying to seduce you. That's not how I do things. I won't chase you, I won't beg. I don't subscribe to manipulative falsehoods to get you where I want you. I'm not trying to seduce you because I don't have to."
Harry imagines those long lashes fluttering so sweetly, slowly opening to pin him down with those piercing gray eyes. He imagines a hand, long-fingered and adept, one that knows how to touch, to please, reaching out in question.
Silvestri smiled with the self-importance of a man with the upper hand. “And how far do you think you’ll get with the Ministry’s chains wrapped around your neck?”
Draco gives her a curt mock bow. "Apologies, dear lady."
Potter snorted from the couch.
"Are you still seeing this Dr. Marbury? Will you continue to see her?" Draco didn't think Potter's confession was lip service; the man had been far more insightful and less histrionic than he supposed. Honestly, when he thought about Potter coming to his senses and demanding Draco come back, he thought there would be some dramatic showing, complete with hysterical crying and possibly a good bout of begging. But this, Draco had to admit he hadn't expected. Potter was
"I know," she says with a wry smile, "because if you did, you wouldn't have lasted the night."
to love you. I'm not afraid to love you. Not anymore. I'm committed to loving you. And loving you means that I have to work on myself and get through my issues." He brushed the back of his hand across Draco's face. "I'd like for you to stand by me while I do that. I need to do it for myself, but Draco, I want to do it for you."
“You could just say what you mean.”
"Why?"
Harry raced up the stairs, threw on some jeans and his trainers, mind reeling with all the possibilities as to what could have happened and where Draco might be now. He straightened, ready to Apparate, when the wards tingled in a familiar, sinister way. Rage exploded in Harry's body and a growl left his lips. No, now he knew exactly what had happened to Draco.
She turns with a rustle of skirts, and all of a sudden Harry feels an emptiness in his chest the farther away she moves. It's a little thing, this want that has unfurled inside him, something easily pushed aside, but he finds he can't bear to squash it.
Potter took an unsteady step back, bracing himself on a chair. "What—that's not—"
Draco's cock is hard.
It's like someone has opened the floodgates on Harry's joy, and he has to press a hand to his throbbing cock to keep it from going off right there. Harry steels himself and leans over to lick a stripe up Draco's jaw.
00000
Harry edges him closer to the new door. "What did you think we were going to do? Hold hands and snog on the sofa?"
Draco continued, cutting off the vampire's protest. "Guilt at burying your friends and loved ones. Guilt at watching the survivors try to rebuild their lives. Guilt at having the unmitigated gall to not die. Again." Potter turned his face, and his shoulders slumped on a low breath. "Because you wanted to die."
"I'm glad of it," Draco replied.
“I can heal those for you,” Potter said, pulling aside the gaping neckline of Draco’s too-big t-shirt and ghosting his index finger across the two puncture marks. The touch was feather-light, and Draco bit his lip to fight back a shiver.
"No," he bit out, "it wasn't discussed." His eyes flicked to Potter's name next to Snape's. "At least not with me."
Snape's face pinched. "What bothers me is that you have fallen into the Potter malaise and thought coming in here like that would be acceptable. Now," he sniffed, gesturing across the room, "you'll find suitable robes in that cupboard over there. Adorn yourself properly and we can get started."
. You will find there is nowhere for you to set up housekeeping. No decent Dom will associate with you, and no self-respecting sub will go anywhere near you." Harry smiles, but the mirth doesn't reach his eyes. "But on the off-chance you find someone foolish enough to take you on, there's always this—" Harry's fingers flicker at his side, a glancing movement so quick, it's almost imperceptible, and a discreet ripple of magic settles over Zabini.
Neville lets out a deprecating laugh. "I'm sorry, of course you have. You're married."
"Not yet, darling," Harry murmurs over his lips. "Tomorrow night, after the dinner party, when everyone's gone home, I'm going to take you to my room and kiss every inch of you. By the time I'm done, your taste will be branded on my tongue."
She chuckles. "I'm old enough to be a museum piece."
There's a banked fire in the corner of Harry's heart, one that's been put aside to be forgotten. Draco's admission has funneled oxygen into it, enlarging it, spreading it out, and now it's creeping across his bones in a white-hot burn. Draco is
"Yes, Potter. I knew. I knew it from the minute they brought you in. I would have known you anywhere." Draco sighed out a heavy breath, and a hollow thud battered in his chest as he said, "You could have worn a thousand different faces, and my heart would have seen through every single one of them."
"And if you don't, that's fine, too." The words rushed from Potter's mouth and he held his hands out in supplication. "Really, it's okay." There was a flash of earnest protest in Potter's eyes as he continued, "If it's not, just tell me what you want and I'll do everything in my power to give it to you, I promise."
"It's nice to see the war hasn't dampened your ambitions. Good for you." Harry finds he means it. He knows post-war has been especially rough on the Slytherin set, and he gathers her story is probably quite similar to Draco's. "So what brings you back here, then?"
The table was nearing empty as Bill, George, and Ron stood up to clear the dishes at their mother’s request. Draco looked up to his right as Hermione suddenly appeared, laying a soft hand on his shoulder. “Could I speak with you a moment, Draco?” She cast a glance at Potter. “If you don’t mind, Harry?”
"Nothing nefarious, I assure you." Her smile is devilish. "I design and manufacture haute couture. Park is my signature line. I've got boutiques in Milan and Paris."
Draco shot a wary glance at the doorknob.
“Congratulations.”
Three years later, fresh off a French Potions Mastery, the hard soles of Draco’s bespoke Italian loafers echo down Ministry corridors. He’s flanked on either side by Aurors Ron Weasley (still ginger as fuck) and some Hufflepuff he can’t be arsed to remember. He can feel Weasley’s glare on the back of his neck like fingers, slowly threatening to choke the air from his lungs. Which is patently ridiculous because Draco’s done nothing in the past three years but catapult himself into the lauded position of youngest Potions Master…ever. Suck it, Father.
Snape's head swiveled toward him with a black glare. "Everything affects the outcome of your grade."
Harry frowned. “What for? The Ministry’s taken everything, there can’t be anything left now.” She returned his frown with her patented ‘you’re missing the point’, look.
. He sucks on Draco's earlobe. "I'm going to give you everything you want. Everything you need. Are you ready for that?"
Her twinkly eyes widen with apprehension, but she nods furiously and pops back out again. There's a second or two lapse when Cook appears in the dining room with a loud, grating pop. All eyes turn to her, but hers are firmly fixed on Harry, glaring daggers. Harry simply smiles at her, rises from his seat, and begins to applaud. The rest of the guests at the table soon join in, and a smattering of happy applause rings out through the room.
Then nothing.
you for it."
Neville is quiet for the better part of an hour, taking the utmost care with the bushes as he combs the soil and takes samples, waving his wand as he performs some intricate diagnostic spells. She thinks maybe he's forgotten her presence altogether, when he asks, "Are you happy, Narcissa?"
The sneering scoff is unintentional, but it escapes Draco all the same. He takes a sip of his scotch and calmly tells Gilles that if he’s finished with his injured queen act, he should sit the fuck down or get the fuck out. A bitter hiss is Gilles’ reply, and he doesn’t hesitate to toss that overpriced, mediocre flute of prosecco right in Draco’s face before huffing out the door.
He heard the rustle of Draco's shirt and knew he had straightened, spine rigid with set shoulders.
He should go. Should run for the safety of his own bed, his own nightmares. But instead, he allowed himself to be pulled back. Draco laid his head on the pillow, facing out into the darkness of the room. Potter’s arm snaked over his waist and dragged him back until their bodies aligned. He tensed, and Potter tensed behind him in response. Seconds ticked by and neither moved, until he felt the creep of Potter’s palm sliding up his chest to splay wide open, letting the whole of his hand cover Draco’s heart. It pressed down hard, not moving, as if any minute Potter was going to curl those fingers and rip out the very heart of him. White noise filtered into his brain, and he realized he couldn’t hear his own heartbeat over the sound.
He steps out from behind Harry and levels a dazzling smile on Ron. "Good to see you, Weasley. Please give my regards to your wife."
"Draco. Call me Draco." Malfoy swallows audibly and adds, "Please."
His mother’s words came back to him and he found himself wrapping his arms around Ron in return. “One Potter, as your wife requested. You’re welcome, Weasel,” Draco whispered back.
“Potter? What’s goi-'' he didn’t need to ask, Potter started hyperventilating, his body shaking and his breaths shallow; he collapsed into Draco’s arms, looking like he was about to black out. Draco knew this was a panic attack, he had them all the time during the war but he had never seen anyone else have one. He picked Potter up, carrying him over to the sofa, he sat him down, taking both sides of his face in his hands; pulling him to look at him.
“Do you see someone you recognise Harry?”
“Don’t say a word, just dance with me.”
He knew Malfoy had a bit of a reputation for sleeping around Hogwarts, the only time he had ever been in a committed relationship was with Pansy Parkinson and every time he saw them together the girl had her tongue down Malfoys throat. Even before that, there was a new girl on Malfoys waist every week. He was a complete slag, and knew the room of requirement all too well.

“Thanks potter” he said, staring forward and not meeting Harry’s eyes.
"What a lovely little mess I've made."
also harry james potter is a himbo
Harry leaned in, kissing Draco hard. It was quick, firm and not at all pleasurable; it was like he was kissing a mannequin. He pulled back, staring at the other boy intently. The dare was finished of course, but neither of them were backing down, they were both too proud for that. Draco grabbed the back of Harry’s neck, kissing him again.
Harry shot up, staring blankly at Ginny. “What?” Kiss Malfoy? Over his dead body. He glanced over at Draco in front of him, he expected the boy to be cowering in a corner, except he was sitting proudly; a smirk on his face. “Sure.”
but ty for the support, i love seeing kudos and comments so leave them if you'd like!:)
But he’d never let a flame touch Harry.
Harry looked around the circle, he was sat in the middle of Ron and Hermione, directly in front of them was Blaise and Pansy. Neville, Dean, Seamus and most of their other friends were decorating the circle alongside them, looking just about as bored as Harry did. Pansy put down the bottle, producing a round of shot glasses and placing them in front of everyone. “Alright ladies, rules, someone in the circle will ask a question, and if you’ve done it, you take a shot.” Pansy explained, pointing her wand at the glasses as they filled up with the rusty looking drink “The glasses are charmed so when you finish a shot, they will fill up again automatically.” Harry looked down his glass, feeling the nerves rise up in his stomach. “Let’s get started then, shall we?”
Harry arrived at Mcgonagall's office right on time, Malfoy was already standing at the door, once he noticed Harry he pushed open the door, leaving it open for Harry to walk in after. Mcgonagall was sitting at her desk, she handed them both a sponge and a bucket. Harry made a disgusted face at the metal bucket sitting on the table.
tw- a lot of fighting and swearing, i couldn't let it stay soft for that long could i?

Draco stopped in front of their window, it was wide open, curtains around it fluttering slightly in the wind; still giving a clear view of the Quidditch pitch. Harry stood next to him, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder, both of them staring at their windowsill.
Draco was sitting in his room, smoking at his favourite spot out the window. He was enjoying his little moments of peace before dinner, where he everyone would give him, Pansy and Blaise dirty looks for the whole hour. He looked out over the quidditch pitch from his open window, he missed playing quidditch; if rooming with Potter wasn’t the worst part of eighth year, not being able to play quidditch was.
He unbuttoned Harry’s shirt slowly, reveling in the way he was squirming under in his touch, he smirked slightly. Draco picked the other boy up, Harry instinctively wrapped his legs around Draco’s waist, his fingers once again tangling in his hair.
Of course, of all people, Draco would get stuck with Harry Potter as a colleague. He thought he’d got rid of the pretentious tosser after leaving school, assuming Potter would stay as far away from any kind of science as possible; the boy spent most of his time on the football pitch rather than inside a classroom. So it was a pretty big shock when he came sauntering through the door of Lunars a few years ago.
hell yeah time for the spice
The green lighter sat on his bedside table, almost mocking him, he had been doing something for years unknowingly making his childhood enemy go crazy. Draco was starting to feel the pleasure rising up in his groin, he was teetering right on the edge of his orgasm.
Their window was wide open, streaming in the early morning sun, early July heat filling the room. Draco could hear the birds chirping from outside, he sat down at the windowsill, sticking his arms outside and feeling the warmth hit his face. He looked down at his watch,
Draco reminisces and Harry has a problem.
Falling in love with Harry Potter came out of nowhere, but it was in no way a mistake. They didn’t talk about life before their eighth year, it wasn’t needed, so much more could be said in the unsaid. Everything about Harry was exactly what Draco needed, he fell for him hard, and was still falling.
Draco has a breakdown, Harry has a revelation, Hermione is the best friend anyone can ask for
“Listen up sluts.”
harry and dracos final days at hogwarts
Potter’s breathing levelled out and he stopped crying, his hands that were clutching onto the front of Draco’s shirt released and he sat up a bit; his face flushing with embarrassment. “What happened before you came here?” Draco asked, firmly, not to scare Potter, but to ground him.
(See the end of the chapter for
He stared back down at the pot, the black liquid swirling about in cosmic swirls. Draco didn’t even hear the kitchen door being pushed open fully, he didn’t notice Harry was standing in the room until the other man cleared his throat. “Draco” his voice was stern, steady.
And there’s people all around him, they’re saying things but everything is filtering through in distorted waves. He picks at the cotton sheet underneath him, it feels nice through his fingers, momentarily distracting himself from the disgusting agony that runs from the roots of his hair to the tips of his fingers.
It was something he had been dancing around for a while, he’d never wanted to admit it, but he’s known since fifth year. When he enjoyed snogging Nott more than he enjoyed snogging his own girlfriend. He had just shoved to the back of his mind for years, he had a reputation to keep up and his father would probably murder him if he found out; no time seemed like the right time to sit down with his incredibly pureblood family and tell them he was most likely very gay.
But he doesn’t, he stands just at the door.
Harry yanked the door to the trophy room open, he hadn’t been here since fourth year and it looked like it hadn’t been cleaned since then. Malfoy set down his bucket, “I’ll start on this side.” He walked over to the left side of the room, starting on the first trophy. Harry blindly moved over to the right side, sighing as he started on his own trophy.
“Oh, so it’s Potter now? I'm pretty sure it was ‘Harry’ a few days ago...” He added, resting a hand on the kitchen counter. Draco slammed his spoon down on the table, making Harry wince slightly. “Stop it, stop
“Stand. Up.” He said, more firmly this time.

He reached into his pocket, pulling out the letter opener that he always had on him, touching the tip of his fingers to the top; wincing, he knew it was sharp enough.
“No Harry, you’re going to let me talk first.” Ron said, sitting down at his desk. Harry nodded, leaning on the wall next to him.
The red headed boy snorts, shaking his head at Harry. “Good one mate.”
All he can feel is pain.
The first morning being back at Hogwarts was certainly a shock to the system, Harry had spent all of seventh year hunting for horcruxes and then he fought a war; he had forgotten how much a school day took out of him. His brain wasn't sure how to take in information anymore, it had really caught up to him how much he had missed, Harry had no idea how he was supposed to take his NEWTs at the end of this year. He could barely write an essay anymore.
The biggest shock however, was Draco Malfoy leaning forward for his glass. Knocking it back, slamming it back down on the floor, aware of every one staring at him. “Who?” Hermione blurted, Harry eyed Draco, waiting to see his reaction. “I don’t think that’s any of your business Granger.” Draco sneered, sitting back against the sofa again. “Theodore.” He said quickly, the potion taking over, despite his resistance. Harry’s mouth fell open, his eyebrows raising.
He looked right at Draco when he said this, the boy gave him a small smile.
“Because of the severity of your actions, you will both be serving detention every night this week, if I hear one insult, argument or hex, it will be for the rest of the month.”
“They hate each other ‘Mione.” Ron sighed, Hermione paused, looking forward again. She saw Harry and Draco laughing and smiling with each other; you would never have guessed they spent seven years at each other’s throats. “No they don’t, not really.” she took Ron’s hand in hers.
Harry could see Hermione crying, even Draco looked like he might tear up.
He wasn’t happy when his friendship was rejected. Which sparked a six year hatred between the two of them, and hadn’t died down in their adult life. They mostly worked in anger induced silence or dirty looks.
“I’d watch your mouth, Malfoy, one owl to my brother and I'll have your arse rotting in a cell for the rest of time.” Ron spat, crossing the room over to Draco, who stood up to his full height. “That’s enough Ron.” Harry placed a hand on Ron’s shoulder “we can talk about this privately.” Ron shoved his hand away, looking Draco up and down one last time.
“Hey Malfoy, can I ask you something?” Potter asked, tentatively. Draco took a sip from his glass before nodding.
“Harry wait!”

He picked up the case, hauling it up under his arms, Draco went to leave the kitchen, but stopped in the doorway.
the seventh year final exams require something, something draco can’t do
“‘I’m sorry, you two seem like lovely people. But I don’t know who you are, and I’d very much like to be left alone now.” Harry hears the girls' protests, but he just lies down and turns away from them.
enjoy my loves<3
Harry made a small yelp of surprise before kissing him back, he slid his tongue into Draco’s mouth, wrapping his hands around his neck. Draco pulled Harry into his lap, biting on to his lip, grabbing at the back of his shirt. Harry's hands tangled into the other boy's hair, tugging his head backwards, kissing down his neck. He could see the goosebumps appearing on Draco’s skin, his hands grasping for anything to hold onto.
was whispered too.
"Checking how high the drop is, see if its worth it." Harry was seething, the cheek of Malfoy since they had returned had been through the roof, and Harry wasn't taking it anymore. He grabbed the boys shoulders and shoved him against the wall, "Don't forget Malfoy, you'd be dead without me too, you'd be lying in ashes right now if i didn't have the fucking decency to pull you of out of that bloody fire! We both saved each other okay? It's time forget about it"
Draco's hand around his bed frame fell down, pushing his pyjamas haphazardly off his hips, hitching his legs up. He shoved a finger into his mouth, reaching down and circling his entrance, pushing a long finger in. The feeling immediately encased him, letting out a deep moan. Draco moved his finger further in, and then out again, adding a second one in for good measure.
He’d always been obsessed with Harry, he’d just confused it with admiration. Up until this year, Draco had wanted everything Potter had. Now Draco just wanted Potter.
Hospital, he’s in a hospital.
Pansy was smiling wickedly, an idea clearly playing on the tip of her mind. Ron looked up from his textbook, looking glad to have a break from studying. Hermione didn’t even glance up for her parchment, ignoring Pansy and continuing to work. Pansy stood in the middle of the common room, clearing her throat.
(See the end of the chapter for
What’s your suggestion Parkinson?” Harry walked into the centre of the room, taking the bottle out of Pansy’s hands and taking a healthy swig. Pansy took his hint, giving him a smug smile. “Well Potter, I was thinking never have I ever? It's about time we get those secrets out in the open, who’s in?” There was a low murmur of approval from the common room, people moving out of their seats and sitting down into a circle. Pansy gave Harry a small nudge on the shoulder before sitting down herself.
“Never have I ever, kissed someone in school?” It was Hannah Abbot’s question, she kicked back her shot, winking at Neville; who spluttered into his own drink, blushing furiously. Harry took another shot, remembering him and Ginny’s kiss in the common room in sixth year. Hermione obviously drank, along with Ron and Luna. “Okay, I’m kicking things up a little, never have I ever kissed someone of the same gender.” Blaise chimed in, picking up his own glass. Dean and Seamus drank, which wasn’t a surprise, they’d been dating since the war ended. Ginny took her shot, along with Luna, who slung an arm around Ginny’s waist.
Harry pulled Draco into his lap, taking his wrist and removing it from his crotch. The other boy whined at the loss of contact, arching his back up against Harry’s chest. He slid up the hem of Draco’s shirt, his cock was straining against his blushed stomach, his eyes still slammed shut. “Look at you Draco, all spread out and needy for me.” Harry knew he was close from the way Draco had Harry’s t-shirt was balled up in his fists, his knuckles going white.
A pale finger trailed down his chest, stopping at the waistband of his pyjama bottoms, he started palming gently; a dribble of precome staining the light material. Draco reached a hand down, throwing his head back on his pillow at the feeling, a deep exhale slipping through his lips.
“But the truth is, we were all children thrust into a war, we didn’t know what we would become once it ended? Coming back was not easy for a lot of people sitting here, some were even scared, but being scared is good, because we don’t grow when we stay inside our comfort zone.”
TW-mentions of homophobia/past family trauma
“You’re different, you’ve changed since the war.” Harry stated, meeting Malfoy’s eyes, the boy seemed to twitch at the mention of the war , his mouth opening scarcely, just as he was about to speak, Harry heard the door open. McGonagall moved swiftly through the opening, holding a small glass container, dripping the pearlescent liquid onto Malfoy’s lip; the blood disappearing straightaway.
Harry and Draco have an incident, Mcgonagall has plans to sort it
“That's not a happy story” Harry sighed, Malfoy stared at him, pity running through his eyes. “Well I don’t have a happy life.”
reminder "fag" is british slang for cigarette, for my american readers:)
big kith
The man had always been attractive, even during school, but Draco could never seem to get past the hero complex and unimaginable sass. There was always something about him that just had people dropping to their knees, and now Draco could understand why. Seeing Harry's fresh green eyes heavy and thick with desire was something he would never forget, holding that image in his brain for as long as he could.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry immediately kicked into gear, sprinting to Malfoy’s side of the room. He turned the corner to see that he had fallen down one of the many trap doors that led to the river underneath Hogwarts, it was a long drop and he was only holding on by his right arm, the trophies around them threatening to fall. “Fucking hell Malfoy are you okay?”
“We think you’ve been in an accident Harry, you were found in the forest and when you woke up…” She trails off, looking to Madam Pomfrey for support, who nods for her to continue. “Madam Pomfrey guesses you’ve been hit by some kind of memory hex, except it was cast by a very experienced hand, and we’re working on how to get it back.”
“I’m struggling in potions.” Harry said, his cheeks tinting pink, Hermione just raised her eyebrows, asking for him to continue. “And…?” she urged, motioning her hands in circles. Harry didn’t want to finish, he’d taken advanced potions while barely passing his OWLs, it was his own fault, but he had no idea what he was doing.
“If it makes you feel better, me and Blaise fight all the time, you see this scar here?” he pointed to a thin scar down the side of his neck, Potter nodded. “Sixth year, Blaise has long fingernails.” Draco said, Potter laughed, pushing Draco’s head to the side a bit. He ran a finger down his neck, tracing over the scar with his finger; Draco shivered under the other boy's touch, goosebumps prickling his skin. Potter’s hand immediately pulled away.
“Breathe Harry, take your time.”
“Alright, I’m heading out, need to see ‘Mione.” Potter stubbed his out on the windowsill, unfolding his legs and standing up. He turned before walking out of the door, “see you later?”
"Um..the moment I saved
The great hall felt emptier than the years before, without Dumbledore, Lupin, Fred, Sirius.... Harry thought he would be never be back here, yet here he was, sat in his usual spot with his two best friends; It was almost like nothing had changed. Except everything had changed, he had destroyed his entire school and people had died trying to save Harry's ass. One of them being his best friends brother.
Draco’s mouth fell open, Potter just called him lovely.
these four speak french fluently and you cannot tell be otherwise
Harry broke out in the biggest smile he could muster, carefully sitting down next to McGonagall as Ron said his speech. It was very funny, causing their entire class to roll about with laughter, he even saw McGonagall let out a small laugh.
i’m so happy with all the views and likes this is getting, i love reading and seeing them:)
God he really needed to sort out his sleep schedule.
Ron is a drama queen, Draco and Harry have their first tutoring session, everyone is really angry and Harry goes a little mad
“Well hi everyone...I’m pretty sure you all know who I am, but today, I want to reintroduce myself to you. Everyone here knows me as a saviour, as their hero, golden boy, the boy who just wouldn’t bloody die. But this year, I’ve just simply been Harry. This year was the first time in my life where I could just be normal! Worrying about school and relationships and not about some dark wizard trying to kill me.”
It was familiar now, Harry’s smell, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t the thing that made Draco blush more than anything. The hints of cinnamon mixing together with the orangery scent made him flush from the bottom of his neck to the tips of his ears, it was like he had smelled it for his entire life. That was when it hit him.
i love reading your comments, i really am so grateful!
He needed his education, he had the ministry practically knocking down his door to join the auror team but they wouldn't take him if he had no bloody clue what he was doing. Plus Hermione would probably kill him if he didn't get his NEWTs.
Draco, on the other hand, bolted straight to Pansy’s room, needing to tell her everything. He felt like he was going to have a panic attack of his own, his breath labouring his throat as he ran all the way to his best friend; he had messed up a lot in there, and Pansy knew how to help with everything.
work partner.
Draco opens up about something, Harry has a similar story
At the end of the day, Harry knew he had to go back. People would be fawning over him every two seconds but he wasn't doing this for praise, he was doing this because he was terrified of Hermione.
After being roomed with Harry Potter during his final year at Hogwarts, he found out that the most important thing about a home is the people inside it; which probably explained a lot about Draco’s upbringing.
“Felt that one.”
He glanced over at Hermione who was across the table from him, her potion was near perfect and he had barely started his. Harry let out a groan, looking up at the clock on the wall. He only had twenty minutes left to complete his potion, he felt like crying, or kicking over his cauldron, maybe both.
Draco ran his fingers over the green lighter in his pocket, it had been a present from Pansy Parkinson for his eighteenth birthday. It was a proper old fashioned, flip lighter, and Draco was obsessed with it. He wasn’t even really a big smoker anymore, but he always had it on him; it was just for something to do with his hands really.
home with
He sighed, guessing it was just another girl calling for his business partners every need. Draco put the phone down on his shoulder, shouting for Potter downstairs. He heard the scrambling of feet flying up the steps before the door burst open. Draco pointed the phone in his direction and the man's face instantly fell, grabbing the phone out of his hand.
He’d hated rooming with him originally, but in time, Draco had grown to love the mess that Harry just created wherever he went. He’d also grown to love the boy who left in the first place.
He threw Potter his cigarette case, he pulled one out with a tan finger, sticking in between his chapped lips. Draco picked his wand up, lighting the end of Potter’s cigarette, spinning his wand around his fingers then putting it down. Draco watched the contentment ease around the other boys face, he clearly had been doing this in his own time.
For merlin's sake he was about to be Auror, living with his Hogwart's Professor boyfriend in Grimmauld bloody Place.
also we hit 300 in two days, thank you so much for all of the support, it seriously makes me so happy!
The music could still be heard playing faintly from downstairs.
i'm nyx and this is my new story, i hope you enjoy it:)
“Living together outside of Hogwarts is a bit different than just being dorm mates though?” Pansy mentioned, giving Draco a funny look. “Well we shag and argue about who left the window open either way, I don’t really see a difference.” He quipped, Blaise snorted, Pansy didn’t laugh. “I just think you’re rushing into this Draco.” She touched his shoulder, Draco frowned, “well
Harry pushed Draco’s shirt off his shoulders, kissing down his own neck this time, his breathy kisses made Draco’s stomach pull. Harry let out a whimper against his chest, the sound going straight to his crotch, his skin heating up. Draco reached for Harry’s coat, carefully pulling it off, trying not to damage the stunning pocket watch.
“No, you don’t. You are allowed your own life, you can decide what you do with it.” Harry snapped, running a hand over his face.
Thinking on it, Harry didn’t actually know how the wizarding world took people being gay, he knew proper purebloods like Draco’s family weren’t crazy about it, the whole “keep things pure” malarky. But they allowed incest so Harry wasn’t too worried about what they would think if he wanted to snog boys.
The only other person that could help him was Malfoy.
Harry’s eyes open, the bright white of the ceiling has a slight blurred haze to it. His breathing his haphazard, a sheen of sweat lines the back of his neck, making him twitch uncomfortably. His back arches as another wave of pain streaks through every nerve in his body, a strangled groan leaps out, forcing him to sit bolt upright.
“I said” Potter moved closer to him, leaning over Draco and closing the window. “Have you ever kissed a boy?”
But did he want to do that? He didn’t know, he’d only ever snogged a girl and he had certainly enjoyed that; so that can’t make him gay. Harry just brushed it off, he’d never kissed a boy and most likely never would so why was he taking Ron's claims to heart?
The red headed boy, he seems most familiar, but still, there’s nothing.
“Who’s Draco Malfoy?”
“We should get the shop open, we have a lot to do today.” Potter said, striding swiftly away from the desk. “Guess I’m doing it then!” Draco yelled at the man walking away from him. Potter just flipped him off before disappearing to the office.
“Potter?”
Hogwarts had always been Harry’s home, there was nowhere else on earth where he felt more comfortable and safe. He’d been through so much here, he was pretty much pegged for death from first year, but here was, still living, despite it all. And tomorrow was his last day.
“Seems a little juvenile, especially for you Pansy...”
Draco watched as Potter stormed out the room, slamming the door for good measure. He straightened out his jacket, swallowing the lump that had formed in his throat, he clenched his fists, feeling the anger rise up in his stomach. He grabbed his cloak that was hanging on his bedpost before marching out the room, headed for his favourite spot from all his years before.
“Granger”
be gay, thinking these thoughts felt poisonous, he might vomit on the spot. “Harry?” Ron whispered, Harry’s head snapped up to look at his very concerned pair of friends.
Draco sat up on the windowsill, Harry across from him, just like usual.
In fact, he doesn’t remember anything.
"Damn right" Harry agreed, Malfoy sat himself up a little, staring out the window again.
Harry groaned, deciding instead to just go down to the kitchens instead, to avoid running into Ron and Hermione. Considering they still hadn’t spoken since their argument earlier on, he didn’t feel that showing up to sit with them at dinner would be the best option. He sauntered his way down the kitchens, taking the long way so he could spend more time outside his room. He liked just walking around Hogwarts, all of his happiest memories had been here, walking through them all again almost blacked out the even worse memories of the war.
“I haven’t done anything to him this time Professor, but the constant look of confusion on his face makes me almost wish I did.”
He released a flustered Malfoy from his grip, disappearing off to find Ron and Hermione.
Harry looked at Ron, who just raised an eyebrow, shrugging. Harry knew Pansy was a bit reckless at times, she had a reputation around the school for being a little crazy; she’d been too tame since returning to Hogwarts. But Harry was so bored, he could use a little cheering up.
TW-a lot of sexuality questioning
Harry kneeled down next to him, picking up the letter opener.
Harry grimaced, shuddering at the thought of how disgusting the floor was. Still, Ginny crawled into her stomach and completed her dare. She was always a ballsy girl; it was something Harry had always admired. Ginny sat up, turning to Draco. “Draco! Truth or dare?” There was a glint of trouble in her eyes, which meant this was probably going to be really good. “I’m not a pussy, dare.” Draco snapped. Ginny smiled the smuggest smile he’d ever seen.
Sometimes knowing too much can be dangerous, there's a reason the saying is 'curiosity killed the cat'
Draco almost vomited at the thought of doing anything other than curling up on his sofa with a cup of tea and a novel. He quickly typed out an apology and a rain check, beginning to clean up his work area so him and Potter could close the store. He closed his eyes, inhaling sharply, sticking his nose up as he swung through the door.
“Have you ever kissed a boy Draco?”
So he slept with every girl he could, trying to push down the feelings that were bubbling up in his stomach for years. And apparently, snogging Harry Potter was the outcome of those feelings.
Harry is surprised at his irate outburst, all of their gossiping heads snap over to him, appalled looks on their faces. He sits back against the armchair, running a bruised hand through the front of his hair. “Can someone please tell me what the hell is going on?”
He wasn’t exactly expecting Potter.
The many plates of food appeared on the tables in front of him, his mouth watered at the sight of Hogwarts food again, he had missed it. Ron and Hermione were both stuffing their faces, trying to make light conversation. "Do y'know Malfoy's back this year?" Hermione mentioned, putting more food on to Harry's plate. "Surprised the prat showed his face, he so much as even breathes near you Harry I'll hex him into next week." Ron drawled, an aggressive tone lacing on his tongue, it scared him a bit. "I've actually already spoke to him" both Ron and Hermione snapped their heads up, looking at him as if he was mad. "He was just spouting this all this stuff about being called a hero" Harry pushed the food around on his plate, Ron scoffed. "He wishes, he's just a git" His friend threw his fork down, leaning forward on the bench, Harry just brushed him off.
"delightful" a voice he knew all too well sneered from behind him, a quiet
“No that’s not what I meant-” Ron began, Harry stopped him. It was his turn to talk now.
Walking through the Hogwarts grounds again felt unnatural, Draco didn't have any worries this year; he'd certainly messed up a lot in his years at Hogwarts, his biggest regret was not telling Dumbledore what was going on before everything hit the fan. He thought he could control it, he thought that he could deal with everything alone. But it went too far too quickly, and he just had to deal with all of his mistakes. It was his own fault, he made his bed so he had to lie in it.
Harry stood up, crossing the circle and flopping down in front of Draco. He'd never been so close to the other boy in their whole life, they had been throwing insults and arguments at each other since first year, but that had always been from afar.
“You two need to stop this childish bickering, do you either of you know what you are fighting about anymore?”
next chapter is the ball ooooh
After what might have been the worst few days of his entire life, Draco had never been more delighted to see the end of the week. He’d mostly worked in silence alongside Potter, they hadn’t had a proper conversation since Draco’s brush with death; he didn’t know how to feel about it. They seemed to have fallen into a weird habit of hating each other’s guts but not hesitating to save the other person's life,I mean he hated Ron but if the git was falling to his death he would just let him; what was the difference with Potter?
Before the war, Harry felt like he was constantly walking on tissue paper that could tear any minute. He fought one of the most powerful dark wizards ever and won, but he couldn’t complete his seventh year potions exam, he felt like such a failure. He couldn’t live up to being “the boy who lived”, Harry would give anything just to have lived a normal life.
“I’m so happy, that house is finally gonna have some life blown into again.” Ron winked, Harry kicked him playfully, throwing his head back; exhaling.
It was innocent at first, just a few drinks in the eighth-year common room to break the ever-growing tension between them all.
The options whirl around in his mind, either he’s suffering from some extreme concussion, or he’s dreaming. He screws his eyes shut, so tight his eyes start flashing white, willing himself to wake up from this horrendous nightmare.
“Thank you for pointing that one out Ron, I hadn’t noticed.”
i lost this whole chapter right before posting it lmao
“Why are you doing that?” Potter questioned, Draco cocked his head to the side.
we hit 600! thank you so much, it means the absolute world to me:)
Harry burst out laughing, Ron joined in.
Draco turned around to face him, their gazes meet. And for a moment, the walls drop between them, leaving them open and vulnerable to each other.
He was walking back to the station with the rest of the school, he’d let Pansy and Blaise walk on ahead; he’d catch up with them on the train. Right now he just needed to feel the fresh air on his face, Draco just needed a moment alone before what would be a very hectic weekend waiting for him when he returned home.
Harry speaks to Ron, Draco speaks to Pansy
“Have you ever kissed a boy?”
strange things start happening around the apothecary shop
The woman sits upright, she's trying not to show her worry by giving him a reassuring smile. She taps the stack of papers on his bed. “I’m going to show you some pictures, is that okay Harry?” She asks, Harry nods and she turns over the first picture.
Normally, Draco would have fought back, but Potter seemed to be in such a state that he didn’t want to hurt him. He stopped, looking back up at Draco, feeling the cut from Harry’s nails starting to bleed down his face, a bruise of his own probably blooming somewhere. Potter reached a shaky hand up, running his finger down Draco’s face, the blood smearing down with it.
He knew exactly why Ron hated Malfoy so much, his friend had never had a direct argument with the blonde boy but Malfoy had made Hermione and Harry’s life a misery for years; and friendship was the most important thing in the world to Ron Weasley. He hated Draco Malfoy simply because Harry and Hermione did.
He closed his eyes, reminiscing over the way flying felt, Draco could almost feel the wind in his face, the smell of the quidditch pitch and the cheers from everyone in Slytherin gave him the weirdest feeling of nostalgia;he missed his old life. His stomach churned at the thought of his life before the war, there’s so much he could’ve done, things he could’ve said that would have made everything different.
Draco bloody Malfoy was stood in the stairwell, leaning with his arms crossed on the wall.
Harry has a moment, Draco and Harry have a genuine conversation for the first time
Harry notices things, Draco gets a letter.
Harry's mind can't stop running riot
He felt like he was on fire, the way Draco’s cold hands were unzipping Harry’s trousers was making him fall apart. The boy wrapped his fingers around him, pulling him out of his boxers. Draco stopped kissing Harry, sliding down his body, licking a stripe up Harry’s cock.
Harry sits cross legged on an armchair in a plush, cosy room. The walls are scarlet red, draped with charming tapestries and ornate fireplaces. And he wonders why he’s been brought here, because it may be snug and pleasant, but it’s in no way familiar.
Weasley, I wouldn’t do it in a stupid game of never have I ever.” He quipped, Ron’s eyes darkened, lurching forward and necking back his shot. He watched as it filled up again, before looking up glaring at Malfoy. “Never have I ever, joined a bloody terrorist group.”
CW-sexual content, internalised homophobia
Draco meets up with a friend, something happens to Harry
He slid down sheepishly on the bench, Ron and Hermione side eyeing each other, Both putting down their forks and staring at him; their eyes filled with animosity. Ron cleared his throat, Harry shook out his thoughts. “Ginny.. Uh said you were looking for me?” Harry cautioned, trying really hard not to piss Ron off anymore than he already was. Ron was still glaring at Harry intently, “yes, I
Oh for fucks sake" Harry hissed, Hermione appeared at his side, she sighed, giving him a pitying look. "I'm sure It'll be fine harry, if he drives you to insanity you can always ask McGonagall to switch." Hermione reminded, patting him on the shoulder; Harry grunted, shoved the door to his room open. Someone was already unpacking his stuff in his-
kithes
Harry sat down next to Ron, fidgeting with his hands. All of his anger was gone, it was replaced with embarrassment, how could he just let Malfoy stand in front of him and speak to him like that? And he just did nothing? Ron rubbed his back, leaning over to whisper in his ear. "Go say some horrible shit Harry, I know you want to and I won't tell 'Mione" Harry smiled smugly, and bolted up to his room.
Draco sighed, turning off the stove and wiping his hands down on his trousers. Pulling open the door, almost running directly into his just
someone cares for Harry
“Look at them all, your friends are all watching you fall apart.” Harry wasn’t exactly sure where all this was coming from, but Draco was whimpering into his ear. The hand that was pulling on his leaking cock was starting to tremble, signalling that he was close. “Harry, you think you can make him come just from talking?” Pansy asked him, turning her head to the rest of the circle.
It's the girl with the brown hair, who was sitting with him earlier. He knows he doesn’t know her.
i'll be updating this pretty regularly over the next two weeks since my school is on break
“Never! In all my years of teaching, have I seen two students be so hurtful to each other for so long! Never!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“There’s a problem Malfoy.”
they were going to have. He pulled open the old door, yanking Harry inside quickly.
"This year, we have returning students who missed out on their education due to the battle in last year. They will be know as our 'eighth years'. First off, you will not be in your house dormitories this year, there has been a special tower built where your dorms will be. Since there is not many of you will all be taking classes together, rooms are assigned in twos, if you wish to swap come to my office, your timetables will be waiting for you on your desks. Welcome back and enjoy the feast!"
. “Shit”
was, just under Malfoy who really was surprisingly good at potions. They were working on the cure for boils, it had been a solid while since Harry had been stood over a cauldron and he was having a really hard time time trying to figure it out.
Harry was red faced, he was fucking fuming. A purple bruise appearing on his jaw.
“He’s a death eater!” Harry shouted, exasperated. Malfoy shuffled in his chair, pulling at the material of his shirt; his face dropping to the floor. “Used to be” the boy next to him mumbled, he was avoiding looking at both Harry and McGonagall, resorting to playing with the rings on his fingers.
As soon as the door was closed Draco had Harry shoved up against a wall, kissing him fervently, his hands travelling up to Harry’s hair, tugging, enjoying the illicit moan that came out of his mouth. He kissed down the other boys tanned neck, leaving already purpling marks as he went. Harry pulled his head back up, kissing him again, fingers grasping for Draco’s buttons, unbuttoning them quickly; not stopping this time.
"Yes," Harry says. "Please continue."
"You said before that I should consider seeing a Mind Healer."
Harry's voice was cold. "Get out, Valeria." His magic pulsed and the front door flew open with a bang. The female vampire didn't move.
In retrospect, Draco thinks a week really isn't that long. However, it's been a week to the day since Harry Potter dropped in and turned everything upside down. It's altogether maddening, and Draco's quite at sixes and sevens over the whole situation. Harry and his presence. Harry and his eyes. Harry and that damned domineering confidence. It's enough to drive anyone spare. It's enough to make Draco rethink the trajectory of his life. Or the course of his wants. He admits he's resigned himself to self-imposed celibacy. Because his experiences have not matched up to the needs of his soul. And now here's Harry, telling Draco he can have it all. It's ridiculous.
"Strip."
Potter snarled, "Please tell me you are not comparing me to Lucius fucking Malfoy."
Pansy Parkinson is a devastatingly beautiful woman. She's grown from the pinched, pug-faced girl of Harry's past and morphed into a bold, confidant woman. Her hair is still severe, but the few years that have passed have made the black bob chic instead of over-styled. She's all dark eyes, red lips, and steely resolve, yet there's a warmth underneath that graces her edges. Her nails are polished, lacquered to a blood-red shine, and her hands curl around a tall flute of sparkling pumpkin juice. There's a tremor just at her fingertips that is reflected in the minute quiver of a perfectly-shaped upper lip.
“Don’t worry, Potter, I won’t be trying off you with sunlight.” Draco gestured with a finger between them. “This is supposed to be a mutually beneficial arrangement. I have no plans to kill you now or in the near future.”
Draco stepped out onto the patio to find Molly sitting at a little outdoor table, pouring tea into cups from a sturdy, but well-kept teapot.
They enjoy their breakfast in relative silence, and are about to part ways when Blinky barrels into the dining room as fast as her little feet can carry her, tripping over the frills on today's sunshiny frock.
is waiting for you."
is all James Potter."
The sheepishness slides from Potter’s face in a slow spread at Draco’s humble pleasantries, turning into a swear-to-Merlin all-out smile. Draco’s breath seizes in his chest for a long, slow second as that smile crinkles all the way up Potter’s face into those green, green eyes. He inquires after Draco’s mother, ensuring she’s settled in at home after the trials, how she’s coping with his father’s incarceration, asking if either of them needs anything.
“Oi! That’s my wife, Ferret!” Weasley bellowed.
She nodded. “Yes. I spoke with her at length about two weeks before-well, before she passed.”
Draco deflates on a soft exhalation of breath, and he turns to go.
Ron strolls in a few seconds later, disheveled and out of sorts.
Harry's breath catches at the genuine smile on Draco's face.
"She's on a lot of committees," Harry replies dryly.
Draco slammed the door behind him, feeling oddly hopeful about the whole process. Yes, Snape was the same, and that was comforting. Expecting the worst of Snape's tongue and tedious tasks brought him back to his Hogwarts days. And he wasn't the same man anymore. Then again, neither was Potter. With that, the tiny bit of hope sputtered out, and Draco's stomach took an ominous turn.
Potter’s hand clamped down over his wrist, while the other scrabbled for purchase underneath his t-shirt, skittering across his skin to finally rest at the hollow of his waist, fingers digging in with bruising ferocity. The hold sought to keep him in place, and Draco wanted to laugh out loud at the ludicrousness of the gesture, because his body had no intention of going anywhere anytime soon. The pull of Potter’s lips on his wrist was drugging as he drank, and Draco moaned as he floated somewhere between a dizzying vortex of pleasure and pain.
Hermione waved a hand. "No, no, I won't be here long. I wanted you to take a look at these as soon as they were ready. I know you've been waiting for this, especially since the Ministry decided to grandfather in your apprenticeship."
“The row Ginny and Mum had earlier today about you and the Ferret. It was epic.” Ron’s eyes danced with amusement. “Epic.”
Draco opened the door and gone was Walburga's well-appointed old lady study. In its place stood a state of the art potions lab. Potter had resized the room at least three times over and filled it with the stuff of Draco's dreams. Shelves and shelves of glittering vials and potions ingredients took up a large portion of one side of the room, there were not one, but two, stasis chambers, a rack of shiny new cauldrons, and several workbenches scattered through the work area. A tall, heavy-drawered chest in one corner looked to contain tools and implements, and one wall was nothing but bookshelves. Hundreds of tomes lined the wall, breaking only in the middle to frame a large portrait. It was a vignette of a library somewhere, with more books in the background. It looked homey and lush, and a large leather wing-backed chair sat to the forefront with a small side table. A steaming cup of tea sat all alone, its wispy tendrils of vapor rising into the air as if someone had just poured it. The room was heaven. And Draco was speechless.
"I'm not perfect either." Draco's hand ghosts over the front of his shirt. "Blaise used to lament the fact that you left your mark on me. It irritated him. He talked about actually branding me before the end."
"I know what you're doing."
Harry grins. "It kind of is." He shifts and pokes at Ron again to get his full attention. "So…how was it?"
Harry shifts his gaze to Draco's hands, upturned on his thighs. His fingers are long and elegant, exquisitely crafted, and Harry knows exactly where he wants them.
Snape face twisted into a thin line of regret. "Me."
Harry moves closer, stripping his shirt off as he nears. He wipes paint off his hands onto his chest as his eyes fixate on the muscled curve of Draco's arse. Harry runs a hand across Draco's flank, and his eyes flutter open at Harry's touch.
It appears that Potter is the good cop (to use hackneyed Muggle expressions) in this scenario. Draco tells him exactly what he thinks of that. Potter chuckles again, the slight quirk to his lips highlighting the sharp edge of a jaw that Draco really shouldn’t be noticing right now. He steps around the front of the desk, coming close enough into Draco’s personal space that he’s tempted to step back. But he doesn’t because fuck Potter, fuck Robards, and fuck this shit. His best cutting Malfoy glare is second nature, and even easier when he’s laying it on Potter, who’s parked himself on the edge of Robards’ desk like it’s got a cushion there specially made for his arse.
“Harry—” Silvestri’s voice was like silk.
Draco manages a breathless, "Yes", and lets himself be maneuvered.
In a split second of distraction, Harry grabbed hold of Silvestri's robes and yanked him forward, head-butting him with an audible, nausea-inducing crack. Silvestri dropped to the ground like a rock, and Potter crawled on top of him, pinning him down with a muscled forearm to the neck. Draco heard Silvestri's panicked wheezing as Potter shifted his forearm to grab Silvestri's free hand and still it.
"No," Harry replies, shaking his head. "You want me to do what
She chances a glance upwards and sees the conviction sparkling in Neville's eyes, and it warms her, down to her toes.
Hermione folded her hands in her lap, fidgeting with her fingers. "Ron and I are pregnant. We're going to announce it then."
But Malfoy and his mother give no notice that the house is exerting itself. It's as if the feeling is reserved for Harry, and Harry alone. He's never felt anything like it, but he knows one thing.
Draco comes to dinner as requested, wearing his haughtiness like a mantle, as if the reason he decided to join them is because he has deigned to do so, and not because of Harry. He makes small talk with his mother and Harry, keeps his expression light, and is in general, a wonderful dinner companion.
"What?" Malfoy snorts and shakes his head in confusion.
He braces against the sudden feeling of being swallowed, of being dragged out to sea without an anchor. Of the reality of being alive, and why.
Mrs. Malfoy stands, ever so graceful, and Harry rises along with her. She spares him a long glance, and Harry can't quite fathom what's going on in her eyes. She is warm and enigmatic, and Harry feels a distinct pull toward her. Her smile is light and a little wistful. Her hands tremble a touch before she clasps them together in front of her.
Draco crossed his arms over his chest and waited.
He is beautiful.
“Curse at me all you like, Malfoy,” she replied coolly, “but if you ever stood a chance at getting out of here, this is your ticket.”
The change in tone urged Draco to speak. "I won't apologize for leaving. I had to go."
"Potter."
Arthur braced Harry with an open, inviting face and stuck his hand out. “Harry, it’s good to see you.”
Harry shakes his head. "I don't think I want the details as to how it all happened, but now that is has…how are you and Hermione? This sort of thing can change a relationship."
"This look suits you," he says. "With your hair unbound, relaxed in comfortable clothing. You look like you belong here, among living things, things that will blossom and grow. Not inside that huge old house, persisting like a museum piece."
“No, this time I was just watching.”
“That’s not your concern. See if there’s anything here you want before I get rid of it all.”
Empty.
He can't hold on much longer, but Harry has to push him just a little bit. Harry leans to the side and puts his lips next to Draco's ear. Draco's head cranes, chasing him, wanting to lean into him, wanting contact, but Harry pulls back.
His movements falter as he works slower, dragging his hands across his skin in a slide of warm suds. He rubs in gentle circles over his chest and abdomen, coming back up over his arms and shoulders. The water is hot and the spray is firm, making his skin tingle as it couples with the friction of his hands. He turns and braces a foot on the marble shower seat, washing down over his thigh and calf and foot, getting in between his toes and behind his knee. He washes like this all the time (cleanliness is always a personal priority), but it somehow seems more intimate now. Something altogether different than his regular ablutions. Draco gives his other leg the same attention, and then grabs for the bottle, squirting another dollop into his palm.
He heard Potter's footsteps retreat and slid down the side of the sarcophagus to the floor. Tears welled from a spring he thought long dry and he whispered into the air.
Draco sighs. "Ugh. Take her. Not even half an hour and already I'm reminded of why she's a loathsome bint."
Potter smiled. "I thought you would be pleased. You'll be able to do whatever you want."
No. Slow down.
"Yes, Professor. They're all squeaky clean."
The difference was startling, and not marginally arousing.
He moves to the nape of Draco's neck, burying his nose in the fine, silky hair, mouthing at him as if he will learn everything about the man by taste alone. He bites along the line of his shoulders, teasing and tasting, alternating back and forth between right and left, causing Draco to pant and shudder.
He chuckled at that. “Ginny’s name seemed to cause a bit of a stir,” Harry added.
The wards rippled as they walked into the boundary of the property, the familiar magic thrumming over Draco's skin in a long, forgotten way. It pulsed the same as Potter passed through.
"Make terrible puns together?" Draco drawls.
Harry’s brow furrowed. What was the problem here? Malfoy certainly seemed to enjoy the attention, and certainly hadn’t persuaded him from continuing to feed. “What are you talking about?”
Green light flashed from within the void where Silvestri's mortal heart used to beat, and Potter rolled off to the side, leaving Silvestri staked to the forest floor. Within seconds, his screaming abated, and the corpse seized and turned to ash. Potter grabbed Draco's wand and tucked it in his back pocket, making his way over to Draco without preamble. As he approached, he waved his hand, and the ball of foliage and thorns around him dissipated.
“Oh!” she exclaimed, waving a hand in the air. “Coats off! Supper’s about ready!”
The fairy lights winked in the moonlight, illuminating the trunk of the large tree with just enough light to read by. Draco raised the envelope, taking a good look at the wax seal again before letting his fingers brush lightly across the surface. Inside were his mother’s last words. Her last thoughts. He wasn’t certain of what he would find, and part of him almost stuffed it into his trousers to be forgotten. But there was no way he could deny her, not now, not after having lost her. He pressed back against the tree trunk and flicked his fingernail under the wax to break the seal. As he lifted the letter from the envelope, the faint, mingled scents of rose and night-blooming jasmine nearly brought him to his knees.
The cry rips out of him before he can stop it, and between one breath and the next, the pull of Apparition whisks him away.
"With all due respect, Mrs. Malfoy, I don't see how that's possible." Harry's holding back a bark of incredulous laughter, because her suggestion is ludicrous.
Draco's posture stiffens, but he doesn't rise. "No," he says firmly. "My relationship with Blaise has run its course. Permanently. There's nothing in Switzerland left for me but you and the chocolate."
He waves a hand in the air. "Yes, yes." He pauses, "Oh, and tell Hermione I'll expect an update on the November investment schedule. It's been over a month and Entwhistle is still putting me off, the pedantic bastard. She said it would take two weeks. She owes me a curry."
When he hasn't seen Draco for meals or been accosting him in corridors, he's been holed up in his office with his head stuck in the Floo. Harry thinks Draco's come to decisions regarding the Malfoy trust, but hasn't pressed for details. He'll let Draco come to him in his own time. And Harry has all the time in the world.
Harry's eyes shoot to Draco's face. His head is turned to the side so he can breathe through his mouth. The green silk is still in place, and his hands are white-knuckled on the handles. There is a visible tremble to his grasp.
"Yes," Draco murmured. "Outstanding."
Happy? Happiness is an emotion that's been gone off her path for so long she can scarcely remember what it feels like. Survival has been the cornerstone of her existence. And now that the war is over, it seems like far too much to even hope for. If anything, survival has dimmed to a low pulse of getting by, and even then, it's something that's beyond her reach.
And the disbelief in Draco's eyes tells Harry it's a start.
Draco pushed back from the table to rise. "I know you've been avoiding me."
"Lean forward," he says, running a hand up Draco's spine to ease him down. "Slowly. Now stretch your arms out—good, like that. Lie flat for me, darling." Draco's pressed chest down against the padding, and the length of his spine is elongated in front of Harry. "The handles are right there. Reach out and grab them."
"Merlin, you still want it, don't you?" he sneered. "I won't deny you. After all, I made a promise I intend to keep. But you will learn that there is a time and a place for everything. I can make this more trouble than it's worth for you. I suppose that's the only real leverage I have." Potter's eyes narrowed but he stayed silent. "You'll understand if I use that to my advantage." He lifted his chin, watching the fire return to Potter's green eyes as his neck was bared for the vampire's view. "Go on, then," he sniffed. "You want it. Take it."
A wizened, grumpy-looking house elf popped in. “Master Harry is home?” Kreacher let out a gasp as he spied Draco, and then bent in a formal bow. “Greetings to Master Draco Malfoy. Kreacher is being pleased to serve the line of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black in their ancestral home.”
Her lips curl on a slow smile. "Correction: I am widowed. And I wasn't talking about Lucius."
Neville's head tilts to the side, appraising her with a single glance. "These are magical plants. When you use magic on them, a bit of your magical signature rubs off them, like a residue. It clings to the very core of the plant and mingles with its inherent magic. And Trilling Roses are very susceptible to the emotions of their caretaker. They feed, in part, off your energy. So when you use your magic on them, it seeps in, and those emotions are fed to the plant." His voice drops. "Narcissa, if you're not happy, the plants will feel it. They'll know. And they will respond, or not, in kind."
“Holy shit!”
“I’m not going to say no to that.”
There is a picture inside, and it's
Draco stumbled back onto the sofa he knew was there, he let Harry down next to him, who leaned back on the arm rest, breathing heavily. Draco couldn’t stand a second away from him, pulling the other boy onto his lap, Harry straddled his waist; kissing him blindly. He reached for Draco’s belt, his breath hitched, his body on fire. Harry looked up at him with pleading eyes and Draco could not wait.
He was hard, painfully hard. From Draco Malfoy. It was actually Harry’s worst nightmare come to life.
“And yes, it is a guy, don’t you think that maybe i’m freaking out that it’s a boy too? Did you ever care to think that maybe I have no idea what’s going on? I don’t know how to explain what’s happening between me and him right now! What you saw was, look, he invited me to the Malfoy’s christmas ball and they have proper dancing and shit and I don't know how to dance at all.” Ron snickered, Harry shoved him gently. “So he was teaching me how to dance, we just had a moment, it’s happened before.”
night.
Harry’s eyes narrow, huffing pointedly, he tries to speak, but the boy shoves a hand over his mouth.
“I know! Isn’t it great?” leaving his best friend with a million questions and a bunch of open ended answers.
“Draco’s moving into Grimmauld with me.” Harry mumbled, to his complete shock, Ron yanked him into such a tight hug he was sure he could barely breathe.
Harry scoffed, shaking his head. “You don’t need to do this Draco.” He stepped back, eyeline falling to the floor. “Yes, I do.” Draco’s voice was quiet, but his mind was screaming at him just to grab the back of Harry’s neck and kiss him until he couldn’t breathe, but he refrained.
“I’m sorry” he finally managed to get out.
“I don’t deserve you Harry, I can’t be your friend because I am an ex death eater who watched people kill everyone close to you.” Draco put his glass down. “I can’t be your friend because I said some horrible things to you and your friends for
He pulled his mouth away from Draco’s neck, kissing him deeply, pressing his hips down. Draco groaned into Harry’s mouth, their kiss getting sloppier as they got more and more into it. Harry had almost forgotten there were other people in the room, until someone clearing their throat snapped him back to reality. Harry immediately leapt off of Draco’s lap, crawling back to his seat at the other side of the circle.
It was chipped a little, but the gold paint was still swirled on the black door, standing out like a sore thumb. Draco put his hand on the wood, pushing it open gently.
“I’ve got it, you can keep the game going.” He drawled, Pansy nodded, starting the game up again.
he makes so much sense to Harry; unlike everything else.
When he first read the letter the idea has seemed entirely ridiculous, but after some thought it really didn't sound so bad.
He stiffens at this, body moving away from the wall, looking at Harry for the first time head on.
“Harry, is everything alright? You’re awfully quiet…” The girl asks, she sounds more worried than she looks, without knowing her, he could guess she’s either bad at covering up her anxiety or a bloody good actor. Harry feels slightly ill, but it’s not from the pain in his head or the other injuries in his body.
please leave comments and kudos, love you all
“We can’t do this Potter, don’t make this any harder than it already it.” Draco started gathering up his oils, placing them into small glass jars for resale.
tysm for 500 reads, i love every single one of you<3
The portrait hole swung violently open, Harry's head snapped up to see a fuming Malfoy storming over to him; Harry glared at him, standing up to face the boy who was most likely about to scream at him. Malfoy stopped, right in front of his face, but he didn't say a word. They both just stood there, staring each other down with nothing but pure hatred, Harry raised his hand, away to punch him right in the middle of his smug face, but Malfoy stopped his fist in his hand; holding it above his head. "You have no power over me Potter" Malfoy snarled, Harry tried to wriggle his hand free, "you sure about that?" Malfoy's face did not change, continuing to hold on to his clenched fist. "I'd be careful around me golden boy, I've been top of potions every year since first year, I know how to kill you and make it look like an accident." Harry gulped, Malfoy released his hand and stalked off to their room.
The office was rather quaint, two desks sat opposite each other, the walls a clinical shade of white; which was a worlds away from the burgundy walls of the main shop. Draco holstled his bag onto his shoulder, fishing for the keys to his
“What.” Draco grumbled, feeling guilty for snapping at him.
Pain.

Harry crawled over to the wall, resting against it gently, he was taken aback when Malfoy sat up next to him.
“That should stop the bleeding now Mr Malfoy, as for that bruise, I think Mr Potter got you good there, It will have to go away on its own.” McGonagall threw Harry a disappointed look, before wiping the rest of Malfoy’s face with a tissue.
“What would your parents say about this?” Harry asked, Draco paused. “A lot.”
He pulled open the door, his mood instantly dropping when he saw Malfoy sitting at the windowsill, and he was
He shakes his head.
“He only remembers you for a reason Mr Malfoy, so either you cast this or are somehow involved as to why Mr Potter has suddenly woken up with no recollection of his life.”
Draco doesn't know how to control his anger and Harry tries something new.
“Okay so i’ve not told anyone this yet, not even Ron and ‘Mione, so you can’t say anything alright?” Draco crossed an X over his chest, Harry rolled his eyes. “I took a job at Hogwarts.”
After about an hour of deafening silence, Harry might as well have been asleep, this task was tedious and mind-numbingly boring; could feel his eyes getting heavy, he was abruptly woken by a loud crash and an ear-splitting scream.
After a very lovely dinner from the house elves, Harry set out to find ron. He wasn’t going to originally but if Ron had got Ginny to speak to him? Something might have happened and he didn’t want to be that arsehole that didn’t help his best friend. He checked the great hall first since dinner was still on, peeking in through the door to see if he could spot the fiery hair of his best mate, he groaned internally when he saw it; meaning he would have to go in.
“You have me Harry.” The other boy leaned forward, their foreheads touching, the only sound heard was their breathing. “I want you to tell me every terrible thing you did and let me love you anyway Draco.” He exhaled shakely, moving to kiss Harry again.
Ginny laughed and shook her head, she reached her hand up, stroking his face. “I’ve gotta go Harry, Luna’s waiting for me.” Harry nodded, staring at the floor. He heard Ginny's feet pattering away, he started walking towards the kitchen again, growing hungrier by the second.
He was pushed up against the wall by the door, Harry kissing him hard on the mouth, running his hands up and down Draco’s chest, tracing little circles into his hip. As much as he was enjoying this, he pulled away. “We’ll get carried away.” Draco whispered, Harry’s expression didn’t change. “Then let’s get carried away, skip graduation, run away together”
“Veritaserum...good one, where’d you get this Dray?” Pansy mused; Draco sat down directly in Harry’s eyeline, leaning against the back of the sofa. “Brewed it the other day.” He added, nonchalantly. Harry was surprised, he didn’t know Malfoy was actually that smart. Pansy stands, lacing their shots with the potion. “Hold on a minute” Ron stops Pansy before she can drip the liquid into his drink.
Pansy looked stunned. “WHAT?”
Harry clearly took his own shot; he’d cheated on every potion test for all of sixth year due to Snapes book. He felt the drink sliding down his throat, leaving a burning taste in the back of his mouth. He shook his head, already feeling the Veritaserum entering his system. This was going to be a
After that, Harry had been filled with confusion, looking too far into Malfoy's life. Why would someone who had despised him for seven years willingly help him kill the person who was meant to be his saviour? If Malfoy hadn't thrown him his wand Voldemort would still be alive and Harry would be dead. Is that not what Malfoy wanted?
There was only one other person that could help him with potions, and the last time Harry spoke to him about that subject he told him he knew how to kill him without leaving any traces. Still, he was out of options now.

“Ron! It’s not what it loo-”
“You called me Harry” Potter stared in bewilderment.
“Can’t wait”
He was staring at the ceiling, today was his last full day of school at Hogwarts, tomorrow would be graduation day, and then he was off; out into the big bag world. He glanced through his open bed hanging, Draco was still asleep in the bed next to him, his blonde hair messily sprawled over the green pillow case, the sheets tangled up around his legs. Harry threw his covers off, tiptoeing over to Draco’s bed, climbing in with him.

"Fuck off Malfoy, I'm not dealing with you this year" Harry grunted, stepping closer to Malfoy. "You know they're calling me a hero down there" Malfoy boasted, Harry rolled his eyes and snorted "when did

Potter was leaning on the counter, a dark haired girl stood very close to him. His face was flushed and his hands were awkwardly playing with his still badly done tie. The girl was holding a bag of things from the shop, meaning she’d already paid but was lingering around Potter like a bad smell. Draco was used to this by now, the endless stream of girls coming in to buy things for the sole reason of flirting with the boy who lived.
harry and ron have an uncomfortable conversation, everyone goes home for christmas
happy born day draco malfoy
Harry cast his mind back to the first time it had happened.
He doesn’t remember anything. But he has this overwhelming feeling that the blonde boy is special.
“I-uh...i just- i don-”
Basically him and Ginny were simply not meant to be, they'd been placed up on this pedestal as the bloody saviours of the wizarding world and it had too much pressure on them as a couple. Ginny eventually ended things, Harry wasn't surprised but he was upset. He did genuinely love her, but being the boy who lived came with a lot of baggage.
you love to see it
i love all the comments so pls comment if you want to!
sorry for a relatively short chapter, i’ve been soooo busy and hadn’t had much time to write’!
Harry felt the unfamiliar feeling flood through him, it wasn't exactly unwelcome but it was far from pleasant. "First time" Malfoy questioned, raising an eyebrow. Harry shrugged, taking another inhale, "it gets better, I do it all the time, calms me down" Malfoy shared, Harry was a little shocked, this was the first time they had ever had a genuine conversation. "Might take it up too, the war fucked me up a little." Harry leaned his head back against the window, exhaling; Malfoy let out a weak laugh, "I think you deserve some calm after all you went through."
“I think I smelled you in my amortentia in sixth year.” Draco’s mouth was hanging open, he never understood what he smelled in the potion, he literally didn’t smell his own girlfriend so he just assumed his one wasn’t working properly. Harry was stifling a laugh, a hand flying over his mouth. “Sorry, that’s not funny” he tried to say seriously, but Harry was almost tearing up trying to hold this laugh in.
“I have something I want us to do.” Draco stated, holding out his hand for Harry. The other boy smiled smugly, placing his hand onto Draco’s.
this is the most random au ever but i hope you enjoy:)
He poured Harry a glass of wine that he brought from home, dimming the lights a little with his wand, before joining his boyfriend at their kitchen table. Eating the first meal in their new home together.
He straightened himself out, “Er, I was just letting you know that it’s okay to fight with your friend sometimes.” Draco ran his hands over Potter’s. “Now let’s get those hands fixed and get this tutoring over with, I guess.”
Draco has a mark, Harry has a few.
become a hero"
It was the place where they realised that they looked at each other just a little too long for them to be just friends, it was their special place.
A slight buzz from his phone woke him up, Draco reached out for it, taking a quick break from thoughtlessly cutting up fruit.
It was weird seeing their room completely empty, it had become so homely in the short time they had been there. There was none of Harry’s endless quidditch magazines, Draco’s sheet music wasn’t pinned to the corkboard hanging on the wall. Plus Harry’s side of the room was clean for the first time since they returned to school.
“Is it true you and Weasley are shagging?” Hermione’s cheeks went pink, taking a drink from her glass. “We were, we’re not anymore.” She said truthfully, Harry knew this, they had tried a relationship for a few months after the war, but it just wasn’t working; they broke up before coming back to Hogwarts, it was mutual so they were still really good friends. “I’ll go next, Ginny, truth or dare?” Neville asked, Ginny just scoffed. “Dare.”
Draco shuffled about in his lap, turning around to face Harry. “You think you can be quiet?” He quipped; Harry gestured to the rest of the circle. “I don’t think any of them are paying attention.” He pulls Draco flush into his lap, his legs on either side of Harry’s hips. He leaned forward to kiss the other boy, instantly slipping his tongue into Draco’s mouth. His hands reached down for Harry’s belt buckle, undoing it slowly, his fingers brushing against his stomach.
“Done!” she stated, finally turning her attention to Harry, “yes Harry?”
“Are we going to do this?” Harry’s voice was hushed, Draco knew exactly what he meant. He placed a hand on Harry’s face.
He glanced out the large window at the front of the shop, it was still dark outside. Not surprising for it being early december. Draco pushed open the door to the small, lab-like kitchen at the back of the store, shivering slightly; he pulled his jumper closer to his skin to retain some warmth. His hands reached for the green pan from one of the cabinets, placing it on the stove burner to heat up. Draco bumbled about the supply cupboard, picking up the ingredients he needed to start cooking up his concoction. He undid the ribbon on a small bag of lavender, tipping them into the pan.
Harry ran over to Malfoy, the knuckles of his hands were covered in blood, he had to have punched something. "You fucking psycho Malfoy! What the hell did you do?!" The whimpering boy in front of him strangled out a "punched a wall" before Harry started healing him, "sorry, I don't know many healing spells" he muttered, before wrapping a bandage around his knuckles. "S'fine" Malfoy shrugged, Harry got up off the floor, moving to sit on his bed.
They stopped in front of their door.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Em, er- I don’t know if that's-um” Potter was stammering over his words, looking everywhere except from the girl's eyes.
“I have to go”
“I think i’m falling in love with you Draco Malfoy.”
“Alright then?! Kiss Harry.”
looooong chapter
Just as he was almost out of the main shop, the phone rang.
and that’s it!!!
Mate? There’s no way Harry’s friends with these people, he doesn’t even know their names.
“I’m close, doing so well for me baby.” Harry’s words were slurred, getting dangerously close to spilling down Draco’s throat. He felt the boy coming all over his thigh and that was enough to send Harry over the edge.
That was true, he was an awful liar. He swallowed, his entire body felt like it was frozen in place. Having Potter leaning over him like this was making his stomach tug uncomfortably, god the other boy was so
Harry wasn’t exactly sure how it had begun.
big kithes
“He’s right Pans, if he wants to move in with Harry, just bloody let him.?” Blaise nodded at Draco, who gave him a slight smile before leaving the shed.
Draco followed Harry out of the room, he wandered up the stairs, pushing open a door on the second floor. Inside the room was a large, black piano, with alternating keys. draco felt his face lighting up, moving over to the instrument and sitting down, letting his hands hover over the black keys; relief washing over him. “It’s been here for years” Harry sat down next to him on the bench, “I was here with Ron and Hermione before we went horcrux hunting, ‘Mione knows how to play so she attempted to teach me and Ron since there was nothing else to do.” Harry’s face was soft, running his fingers gently over the keys.
When Harry wakes, he’s still in the hospital.
"Harry I can almost hear you thinking." Harry looked up to see Hermione with her arms crossed, her hair getting slightly frizzy because of the humidity in the classroom. Harry shook his head, "I'm fine 'mione , just not been in school for a while s'all" Hermione was not at all convinced, she walked over to the other side of the desk, picking up his ingredients and helping him finish his potion. He smiled the biggest smile he had since the war.
I am so sorry it took this long, but I thank you all for sticking with me. I hope you find that this was worth the wait. Cheers!
Draco roused to the dancing flicker of lamplight. He stretched and turned, only to open sleep-heavy eyes on Potter lounging in a chair across the room staring at him with intense scrutiny.
“Goodnight. Love you, see you.”
“Look, it’s last ditch. There’s not a soul in the Ministry that wants to see Draco Malfoy walk free. And they’ll do what they can to keep him shut away for as long as possible. The only way they wanted him to go home is when they laid him in the same tomb with his parents.”
“And why is the Ministry forcing him to take a Consort? I didn’t think they concerned themselves much with vampires outside of treaty negotiations.”
"You can't!" Potter spluttered, suddenly finding the energy to move. He reached out with grasping hands. "No, Draco, you can't—"
Tonight will determine if Draco can obey enough, trust enough, to earn Harry's touch. Harry wants to give it to him, Merlin's fucking beard, he wants it, possibly even more than Draco. But he possesses enough self-control to keep from giving in. The waiting has a purpose, like everything else. Harry's learned that anything freely given has a tendency to lose its value over time, and that's the last thing Harry wants. What's about to happen between them has an importance that Harry can't possibly put a price on. If Draco wants it, he has to earn it, so that he may know the value of obedience and the depth of Harry's esteem.
Harry narrows his eyes in acute displeasure and glides forward right into Malfoy's personal space, hovering just on the other side of uncomfortable. His voice is low, this time it's dangerous and he knows it, but he doesn't care. "I'm long out of school, Malfoy. And I may have been a Gryffindor, but I can assure you that I am in complete control of myself. I no longer 'blunder about' and you can be certain that for every move I make, for every word that comes out of my mouth, there is a reason behind it. So I'm going to figure out how and why I got here, whether or not it pleases you. You can decide to be nice, or you can decide to be a shit. But I'm telling you that if you expect me to revert to our old, petty ways, it's not going to happen.
“We’ve missed you, son.”
"Where do you want to be, Potter?" Draco's mouth went dry as he asked the question.
"He did show me the studio," Harry adds. "It will perfectly suit my needs. Everything here will."
Draco's cry of orgasm is sobbed into Harry's mouth, and his entire body bucks like he's being electrocuted. Harry feels the warm wetness seep into his trousers, and the knowledge that Draco has been completely unmade triggers his cock into bursting. He comes hard, still licking into Draco's mouth, with white lights flashing behind his eyes.
Water was pelting them both, and Potter didn’t seem to care that he was drenched from head to toe, nor did he seem to care that he had Draco pressed against the wall, with nothing between them but Potter’s wet pajamas.
“Goodnight, Draco,” she answered.
Draco's throat moves in a nervous swallow as he turns his head to look at Harry.
"Good." Draco shifts on his feet, and his fingers fidget by his side. "I was thinking, since I believe they'll be a while in the greenhouse, that you would join me for tea?" He hesitates, and then continues, "I just thought we might enjoy the pleasure of each other's company for a while."
"A worthy apology, I presume?" There was too much of a knowing tone to his words.
"You must think me rather silly, I suppose, asking for a hug in broad daylight," he murmurs into her hair. "I don't think I ever asked for a hug before. They've always been sort of given to me." He pulls back to see the beginnings of tears in her eyes. Happy ones, he surmises, based on the brightness glimmering there. "I hope Draco doesn't think I'm trying to steal you away from him or some such nonsense."
"Yes," he replies. "I worked through it. It's a line of thought I'm slowly learning to leave behind."
Draco took the vial and set it on the table in front of Snape's portrait.
Ron sighed, long and breathy. “You know you saved him, right? By taking him on as Consort.”
, shouting and gesturing like a herd of rabid Thestrals.
Draco complies, hands slowly moving to the top button of his shirt. One by one, he unfastens them, stopping only when he reaches his waistband. He untucks the bottom half of the shirt, making deliberate work of pushing each button through the hole. His eyes are downcast the entire time, and his bottom lip is pulled between his teeth in light concentration. When he shrugs one shoulder from the fabric, his eyes come up to meet Harry's, and his lashes flutter as he releases his lip on a sigh.
Draco laid out before him like this demands touch, and so touch Harry does. He leans up and over, crushing into Draco's arse, peppering his spine and back with bites, nibbles, licks, and kisses. Draco's skin is salty-sweet, and Harry mouths at him with relish, savoring each taste as if it is last.
Out of all the things he expected to come out of Narcissa Malfoy's mouth, an invitation to stay certainly wasn't one of them.
"I don't know," Harry says, studying the way Draco's hair is falling softly into his eyes. "Might not be so bad."
She waves her hand. "It was no trouble, I assure you. We merely want you to be as comfortable as possible." Her head turns to her son. "Don't we, Draco?"
“Is this your arse-backwards way of telling me I’m showering too loudly? Because you’re the one who offered me a shower in the first place. If you wanted me to wait, then you should have said something before I came in here and got naked and started lathering up my bits-” Draco’s rant cut off when Potter stepped into to the shower, pajamas and all, and pressed two fingers to his cheek, tapping softly.
Potter dropped his head to Draco's chest and snickered furiously. Draco pushed him back to look him in the eye.
Draco awoke to tangle of sheets and the flood of lamplight in the room. Potter was nowhere to be found, but the sound of raised voices carried up from downstairs. He yawned, rubbed his eyes, and shuffled down the stairs to see what the hell Potter was up to now.
Ron reached out and gave him a playful punch to the arm. “Good to have you back, mate.”
Small lines crease the corners of Malfoy's grey eyes as he stiffens a bit. He draws in a breath before replying, "Mother's room is in the other wing. She's a light sleeper, and I—I keep odd hours." Long lashes flutter over those stormy gray depths. "She needs her rest. I don't like to disturb her."
Ron rubbed a hand over his face. “I mean, he was never going to really be free. You why he was only tried on the one charge? Of letting the Death Eaters into Hogwarts?”
Harry blows out a breath and leans in with a smile. "Afraid not. I have a date tonight." He tilts his head to consider her. "And you?"
That's all it takes.
"I'm not unreasonable. I suppose after three months, I can give you audience."
Ron's face turns sheepish. "Really, it's okay." He pauses and Harry lets him have the moment. "Because 'Mione slept with her, too."
Malfoy's a few good inches taller, but it only takes a fraction of distance for Harry to lean forward and radiate command with his presence. Malfoy's head immediately dips to his gaze.
Harry's voice is firm. "We will have no boundaries. We will go where you have never been before. And then we will go farther. We will be
“Please-”he panted, lifting his head from Draco’s neck. “Please-I need…It feels-”
“I wasn’t—”
Draco's eyes are searching his, and Harry sees the wheels turning in his mind.
Draco spluttered. "Ex—excuse me? What?"
He tightened his hold on Draco's hair, yanking back harder to lengthen the line of his neck, making it available for the point of his tongue as he slid it across Draco's blood-stained skin. He suckled away the remnants as his ankles pressed against Draco's arse to bring him closer. Harry's hardness met Draco's, and he growled in approval as Draco moaned into the air.
"Two women. One Ron. The maths pretty much have to equal amazing. Even if I just got to sit there and watch." He laughs. "Seriously, though, and this isn't to disparage 'Mione in the least—" Ron pauses as if he's waiting for permission. "It was the best sex of my life. Is that horrible? I think it should feel horrible on some level considering how much I love my wife."
Harry traces the curve of his ear with the bridge of his nose, sighing softly. "You're going to be so good for me, Draco. Aren't you?"
"I don't like him because he's dangerous, presumptuous, and frankly, he's a giant arsehole."
Harry set down his book and turned to face her. "He did say he was going back to Knockturn before coming over. Something about a supplier getting his order wrong." He smiled, even if he didn't feel like it. "I'm sure he'll be there soon."
"Potter."
Draco looks suitably fuddled when Harry pulls back. The sight is pleasantly arousing. He turns and heads for the doors.
"I can be civil," Draco sniffs. "I can be polite and accommodating. Hell, I can even go so far as to be," he shudders delicately, "friendly."
The terse command startles Draco into attention. "Wh-what?" His voice falters a touch and Harry has to stop himself from smirking.
"You feel that?" Harry asks. "That's what you do to me. Kissing you, watching you, feeling you respond—that's what happens, Draco. You have me coming in my trousers like a schoolboy. You did that. As much as you think I have power over you—" he thrust his cock forward for emphasis, "—that's the power you have over me."
Potter took the statement in stride, tilting his head to the side and smiling. "Do you really think Molly's going to kick you out? I'm surprised she hasn't given you your own wing."
"Not in here," Potter interrupted. "Not in this room. Not in this bed."
"Magic," Harry replies. "At least what it feels like to me."
"Yes, sir!"
"Oh," he said, perking up, "I think you should know, I'm pretty sure our owls are involved in some sort of romantic relationship."
Draco whipped around in time to see a large swath of black robes swish into the frame, and Draco's heart caught in his chest. A familiar profile appeared, a hook-like nose he'd known since childhood, and suddenly he was looking square into the dark eyes of Severus Snape.
"Oh, Mother. What in the hell have I gotten myself into?"
Draco's cock twitches at his words, and his right hand moves to grip his erection. As the first touch, Draco hisses and his chin drops to his chest. But he complies, and his hand begins to stroke with hesitance, fingers curling lightly around the shaft.
Draco turned into the corner of the sofa and rested his hand along the back, trying to adopt a casual pose. Potter tracked every movement with open interest.
“I suppose it’s your home now, as well,” Potter replied.
Draco's face tilts like he's been jerked backward.
“And who came to you with his hand out, apologizing to you, when it should have been the other way around?” Her voice ascended into a higher pitch as she spoke. “Who tried to mend things with you? Who tried to help you make peace with your transition? Who tried to make you see that he still loved you, no matter what?”
Pansy blows Draco a kiss as Harry steers her across the floor. "But I'm your loathsome bint, darling. Never forget," she clucks. "Chop, chop, Potter. I have a finite amount of time before these heels give out. Let's make it count."
“Just stay away from the curtains, Malfoy.” Potter snapped his fingers. “Kreacher?”
Harry opens his mouth but shuts it a second later because Malfoy has suddenly
The door isn't shut for two seconds and Draco's scrambling to get into the bathroom, tripping over his own feet in haste to chuck off his pajama pants. It doesn't even register; his body is moving of its own volition, propelled forward at Harry's words as if disobedience isn't even an option. It's unthinkable.
"What was I supposed to do?" Ron throws exasperated hands into the air. "I mean, you tell us you'll owl, and we don't hear from you, you're not at home, you don't have an office anymore—Circe's tits, man, you practically disappear, and I find out you're here, of all places!" His eyes go soft around the edges, and Harry sees the long-time friend lurking beneath. "Christ," he mutters, "I thought something had honestly happened to you. I wasn't going to stand for it. You should know that by now."
"Yeah."
Harry nearly chokes on his coffee as a ripple of the Manor's magic flushes through his groin on a rush of pleasure. He sets the cup down and daps at his lips with the napkin, letting the smile spread wide on his face, because he knows Draco has done exactly as he was told.
"How wonderful. We have a studio. I'm sure you'll find it more than adequate for your needs." Her eyes are entreating. "Please…stay."
His heart feels light and frothy with the warm happiness of companionship he thought he'd only ever find with Ron and Hermione. Now it appears his circle is growing, and his fondness for them all expanding with it at a rapidly increasing rate. He glances back to Draco, standing there looking elegant and perfect in his tailored suit. Draco winks at him and raises his glass in acknowledgment.
"I respected him for your mother," Potter said smoothly, and the weight of the statement made Draco feel a little guilty for not thinking of that himself. By her own hand, she had revealed how much Potter had meant to her. "And for you," he finished. "I came because I knew Narcissa would have wanted you there by her side, and since that wasn't possible, I came in your stead. I was a poor stand-in, I'm sure, but I think she appreciated it all the same." He smiled wistfully. "She hugged me. In front of the officiant and Kingsley Shacklebolt."
"But you're watching out for Potter, too, aren't you?"
"I am, because even dead, that man has his hooks in Draco's soul as surely as you do. If you keep this up, you will lose him, I guarantee it."
*drops chapter and hides*
Harry's vision goes white.
He pulls back, but continues to speak in Draco's ear. "Now, I'm going to go downstairs and have breakfast with your mother. While I'm gone, I want you to go into my bathroom and take a nice, long shower. I want you to think about last night and touch yourself again. I want you to wash your hair with my shampoo, clean your body with my soap, and think about what it would feel like to have my hands all over you. I want to be able to eat my breakfast knowing that you're up here, bringing yourself off and thinking of me. Of my hand on your cock, my lips on your skin. Thinking about what it would be like if I split you open and fucked you against the wall, right underneath the hot spray."
The effect is instantaneous, and the wind blows from Draco's sails. His shoulders droop as his face lines with remorse. To his credit, he swallows, but does not look away, taking the rebuke and shouldering its consequences.
All his years of pureblood training kicked in and he bowed formally before kissing the back of her hand. “Hermione. You look lovely this evening.”
Potter sighed. "Just Silvestri. You know, like Madonna, or Sting."
Harry doesn't say anything, but keeps his smile in place. It's only a second or two before Draco sighs and shakes his head.
"Bondage? Restraints?"
Draco stands motionless, blank-faced, as if Harry's just introduced a concept that is completely alien to his scope of thought.
The tapping at the window breaks the mood as Blinky pops in to let open it for the fluffy gray owl. It immediately settles on Blinky's arm and she trots it over to Narcissa. Her eyes widen in surprise as she examines the outstretched leg. "It's from your Mr. Longbottom. I didn't expect to hear anything so quickly."
Potter’s lips curled as if he were going to smile. “Are you getting up anytime soon?”
"Don't get cheeky," Harry grins with a glint in his eye. "Or I'll have reason to color
"Anything, sir?" His voice is measured, low and carefully even.
Malfoy pops upright in his chair. "Telling? What's so telling about Potter here popping into places he doesn't belong? Merlin knows he's done enough of that for a lifetime. He probably pops round to places all the time. It's Monday? How about the Ministry fountains? Thursday? Isn't Wales horrible this time of year? Easter Sunday? Why don't I just come back from the dead like Jesus bloody Christ?"
Draco makes a face at him. "Take all the fun out of it, why don't you?" He wrinkles his nose and sighs. "Alright, I'm leaving." Draco shoots Ron a withering glare in passing. "Welcome to my home, Weasley. Don't fucking touch anything."
Draco drew himself up and sniffed with as much dignity as he could muster. "Yes, selfish. I didn't care about which side won or lost. I didn't even care if you went on only to die later," he added with a sneer. Draco's heart lurched into his throat. "But in that moment, I held your life in my hands. My word was everything. I could have been the one to deliver Harry Potter to his death. And isn't that what every devoted little Death Eater wanted? Fuck," he hissed, "do you know the kind of praise I would have received? How exalted the Malfoy name would have been?" Draco shook his head. "But I couldn't do it. Despite everything it would have bought me. I was too selfish because I loved you, because I couldn't bring myself to be the one who caused you to die." He sucked in a sharp breath and squeezed his eyes shut. "I loved you so much I knew I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I did. Whatever happened to you from then on—win or lose, live or die— didn't matter. All that mattered was that it wasn't my doing." Draco looked up at Potter. "I loved you so much that I wasn't willing to live with my guilt. And I hated you for it. Just bloody hated you for it." He was quiet for a second. "Sometimes," he whispered, "I think I still do."
His hand reaches for hers on instinct, cradling it gently. "Neville Longbottom is a good man, and not the kind to let the past intrude on his present. He's made his peace with things. But if you're inclined to keep to yourself, I'll respect that." Harry's lips curve into a sly grin as he adds, "And I know for a fact that he'd love to get out here and see your famous gardens firsthand. From what I hear, they're legendary. Much like their mistress."
Draco nods, keeping his focus on Harry.
"Look, Potter," Draco interrupted. "Your attempt at actually giving a fuck is noted, if not appreciated. However, we both know that you couldn't care less about what happens now so long as it doesn't interfere with your feeding schedule. The small talk is unnecessary." Draco stepped back a bit, and those long fingers he had admired moments ago closed around his wrist, pulling him between Draco's body and the table. "Just do what you have to do. I'm busy, and the clock is ticking."
Draco maneuvers around the easel to stand just behind Harry's shoulder and quietly peruses the canvas. It's nothing like he's painted before—still lifes, an attempt at portraiture and the lot—but he's taken a step outside his box and created something he finds he's remarkably proud of. He's certain it isn't to popular esthetic, but that really means very little. The bright swirls of formless color speak to him in a way he's not going to bother to understand. Harry merely accepts the muse for what it is.
"I'm going to have to get used to staring at his pointy face for the rest of my life, aren't I? Because this is different. You're different. He's not some bloke you picked up, like Owen. I think you've been waiting for this. Waiting for Malfoy. But you didn't know it, not until now."
“And what, bind myself to a man I hate and spend what’s left of my natural life as what – the feed-trough for the Golden Boy of Gryffindor?” Draco snorted. “Pull the other one Granger, it’s got bells on.”
"You really are incredible Hermione Granger." Harry thanked, she gave him a playful shove on the shoulder. "I know" she smiled, before returning to the her own potion.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry suddenly got very embarrassed at the question he needed to ask.
“What the HELL do you think you’re playing at Harry? Fraternizing with the enemy? Sleeping with Malfoy so you can get your grades up? FUCK YOU!” Ron exploded, Harry was shocked, where the hell did the idea that he was shagging his worst enemy? “Are you serious Ron? He agreed to help me with potions, not down on one knee confessing his undying love for me” Harry spat, “and why the fuck do you think i’m shagging him? I’m not gay and he’s not gay so why would I be sleeping with him?” Ron released his grip slightly, his nails leaving crescent shapes in Harry's wrist, but his face was still bright red with anger. He could hear Hermione screeching at them in the background but it was just white noise. “Well I don't know Harry? Maybe the fact you jump to his defence at any chance you get? Who knows what you two get up to in your dorm at night?” Ron sneered, Harry was raging now too, how dare Ron accuse him of that?
“I’m so glad I met you, this version of you.” Draco rambled, “you’ve always been so special, you are genuinely the most amazing person I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.” Harry blushed at the compliments, no one had ever said those words before, not truthfully anyway, anyone who’d ever told him that was just trying to get something from him. But here was his lifelong enemy, someone who he spent so many years hating more than anything that ever walked the earth, telling him those things. Harry’s heart was beating so loudly he was sure Draco could hear it.
They were both silently walking around the room, running their fingers over the furniture, reliving memories they had made together in the small dorm room. Draco couldn’t wait to make more with Harry in Grimmauld Place.
No bloody way had Draco Malfoy snogged a boy.
“You’re a terrible liar Draco Malfoy.” Potter’s voice was thick and raspy, and filling through Draco’s ears like water.
Draco didn’t even knock, he just burst right into Pansy’s room, the girl didn’t even look up from her book; just sighing gently. “Yes, Draco my love?” she sang, he could hear the smile in her voice. “How did you-”
but for now, this is goodbye! i love you all endless amounts<3
Harry faded back into his seat, his face dropping into a scowl. It wasn’t directed at Hermione but he was a little annoyed, he had no clue about any of the potions in the NEWTs potion list and couldn’t even fathom starting any of his essays, who else could help him? Ron didn’t take potions, neither did Seamus or Dean and like hell was he talking to Ginny. They hadn’t spoken since their breakup, Harry knew she was happy with Luna.
He looked at his empty childhood bedroom, he expected to feel upset, but a flurry of excitement rushed through him; breaking into a huge smile.
With Malfoy’s fingers beginning to slip, he gave in and grabbed Harry’s arm. He pulled Malfoy up through the opening; the other boys weight knocking them over, landing on top of Harry. Malfoy quickly scrambled off of him, lying down to stare at the ceiling. They both just lay there for a minute, breath heaving, chests rising up and down in tune with each other.
"So it really is true?" Malfoy glowered, staring down Harry intently, "the door wasn't a boggart?" Harry shooed away Hermione, walking in and tossing his bag down on the empty bed. Malfoy was parading about the room with his usual strut, Harry noticed that Malfoy appeared to be a clean freak; picking things up and putting them down again to get them in their exact place. That surprised him, Harry had just always guessed they had house elves to do everything for them.
And soon, he was fast asleep.
Rons allegations were not ones he took lightly, and from the tone of his voice, they were not ones that had just come out of nowhere. They made him feel weird, if Ron thought he was secretly shagging Malfoy then Hermione did too, they probably talked about how strange and gross it was all time. Harry felt responsible for that, he didn’t exactly do anything that proved them wrong.
Harry walked into his room, ready to give Malfoy a piece of his mind. The sight he saw when he walked in was not one he was expecting.
“Nah I think we’re good” Ron smirked, pulling Harry into his room.
He stirred in his sheets, his cock already half hard just from thinking about last night. Draco willed himself to have self-restraint, staring directly at the ceiling, letting his hands rest on his chest to stop them from going down any further. He couldn’t do this, he knew that, although Harry kissed him first, last night was enough to send him running for the hills. But his words were playing on repeat, making his cock twitch again.
“Leave it to me.”
Dismissed, as always. But she's learned of her own worth enough these past years.
“Close your mouth!” Hermione hissed, elbowing him from the side. “We’ve talked about this.”
Ron’s body shook as he chuckled, and Draco’s gaze shot up to notice Potter had gone still. Moonlight passed over his face, and Draco saw the set of his jaw and the fierce emotion that danced over his skin and in his eyes. He knew that look, didn’t need the bond to spell it out for him.
He imagines what he looks like, crumpled on the floor of the shower, a mess of monumental proportions.
He looked down to see Potter's half-hard cock hanging out of his jeans, dribbling into a pearlescent pool on the floor. Potter had come untouched with Draco's cock in his mouth, and not a drop of blood between them.
"Draco? Are you alright?"
Potter’s fangs bit down, sharp as always, but instead of the drugging pull, Potter’s mouth was gentle. Something stung, and he realized it wasn’t Potter’s bite, but the salt of his tears that burned on the wound. The deep draws of before were gone, and this time Potter nuzzled Draco’s flesh with soft, tender touches, suckling like a babe at the breast.
Ron's head falls back onto the sofa. "Yeah. We had a—" he makes finger quotes in the air, "talk." He laughs. "Frankly, when she brought it up, it didn't send me into a cold sweat like it normally does. You know how she gets when she's in 'discussion mode'."
Draco rolled his eyes and smirked again. "Never use a cauldron that you yourself haven't cleaned and inspected."
His eyebrow quirks and Draco replies soberly, "I am still me, Harry."
"Yes," Harry agrees, waiting to see how this plays out.
"A matter of oversight, I'm sure. I don't think updating his will was his first priority while withering away in prison." Draco sighs, and it's a heavy sound that echoes through the room. "I disappointed him, and he was ashamed of me. I didn't care either way. It was one of the reasons I went to Switzerland in the first place with Blaise. If I wasn't going to give a fuck, I might as well go all the way." Draco's lips curl into a wry smile full of regret. "I suppose it doesn't matter now, anyway. He was right. He told me I wouldn't end up happy with Blaise. He's right, and now he's dead." Draco pulls a disinterested face, and his arms fall his side. He braces his hands on the edge of the desk. "And I can't step into his shoes knowing that for all I was angry with him, the bastard was right all along."
Potter’s still using breathy words like perfect and precious and gorgeous and Draco knows he’s done for. He’s not leaving. Rabid thestrals could drag him from Potter’s bed.
Harry's hands slide down the frame as he goes. The only part of him that touches Draco is his lips, and Draco's taste burns on his tongue like sweet fire. Draco's scent and taste swirl around his head in a fog, and Harry has to close his eyes and take a deep breath to keep his focus. His tongue swipes a lazy figure just over Draco's tailbone, slow and methodical, and when he presses it flat over the top of his crack, Draco lets out a keening wail.
Another item that wasn't there before.
"No touching yet, baby. Not until I say." The endearment feels fond and sweet on his lips, not the saccharine, infantile appellation it used to be with others.
In a heartbeat, Harry is on him, knees on either side of his hips, straddling him, pressing him back into the couch. Harry's left hand comes up to curl around Draco's throat, the hollow between his thumb and forefinger slotting underneath Draco's jaw with increasing pressure. Draco's eyes go wide and startled, and his whole body tenses.
He makes his way to the dining room (he's late for breakfast—again), when he spies Draco just about to enter himself. Draco stops and appraises him as Harry approaches.
Snape glared from the confines of the portrait. "Charming." He let out a put-upon sigh. "I'm already dead, Draco. I can drag this on forever if necessary."
"I'll keep that in mind."
"Yes," she replies, "you've led an interesting life so far, I'd say."
Potter snarled in fury before biting back in return, “I will hurt you!”
OOOOO
“Because I’m afraid for you.”
Harry knows if he waits, if he ignores it for now, Draco won't be able to stand it. The temptation to throw his carefully constructed mask in Harry's face will be too much for him, and Draco will instigate something. Because if nothing else, Draco is a hopeless instigator.
Potter nodded. "He's your potions tutor."
"Muggle one," Potter affirmed. "Well, she's a squib, actually, but takes on the odd wizard or so. I needed someone who would look past two major things—Boy-Who-Lived, and these," he said, pointing at his fangs. "Dr. Marbury has been wonderful. She has a working knowledge of wizarding society, and couples her therapy with Muggle technique."
Suddenly, Potter's face was in his neck, breathing out over the bite mark and making it tingle, before the flat of his tongue licked a long, slow stripe over it, trailing up Draco's neck to just under his ear.
Potter stood there awkwardly, looking sheepishly at him while scratching at the back of his head, waiting for Draco to say something. And he honestly wanted to, but his brain had short-circuited the minute he stepped into the room.
Harry shuts the bedroom door behind them and turns. On the far wall, to the right of the window, stands another door. One that was not there yesterday. "Oh, that." Harry sucks in a small breath between his teeth. "I required a room, and your house gave me one. Wizarding space never ceases to amaze me."
“Does it really matter?” she asked. “The who is incidental against your getting to walk out of here and live your life.”
Draco secured his grip to hold Potter's head still, and gave an experimental thrust of his hips. The sound Potter made was filthy and perfect. He thrust again, sharp and deep, and watched as Potter's cock twitched and dripped moisture onto the floor. Potter took his hands from their clutch at Draco's arse and braced them on the wall, astride Draco's hips, to further hold himself in place.
Harry shook his head. “He had five years left. That’s hardly saving him, Ron.”
Harry's index finger stretches to draw a lazy circle on the tablecloth, still so close but not touching. Draco tenses, as if he is anticipating the contact.
Draco levelled him with a glare. "We're not discussing avian hook-ups. Go on with what you were saying."
Green.
The deflection was intentional, and Draco wondered exactly how much wiser Potter had gotten in the last three months.
Draco's head snaps back and his eyes slam shut. His mouth falls open on a keening, guttural groan that's got to be coming from his toes. The sound is so resonant it hits Harry right in the balls and he has to press the heel of his hand to the raging hard-on in his trousers to keep from joining Draco in plummeting over the edge. The muscles and tendons in Draco's neck are straining against his skin, and Harry wants to lean forward and sink his teeth in right there over Draco's pulse. He wants to feel the pounding of Draco's blood, feel the shake of his body as he rides out the high of orgasm.
something."
Her worry for Draco morphed into a hard mask of disappointment as she glared back at him. "I wouldn't have to if you would get your head out of your arse, Harry Potter." She huffed and disconnected the call, disappearing back in a puff of smoke.
Harry steps back and Draco falters a little, but steadies himself before nodding. "Ye—Yes, Harry."
"Well, then he's got it bad. He sits by the front door and waits for her. Preens for hours. Puffs up before she arrives, that sort of thing. Brings her dead mice. There's an awful lot of cooing for it to be strictly platonic." Potter grinned. "It's kind of cute."
"No," Draco protests as his head swings around to Harry. "I mean—just, no. That won't be necessary. I want this."
It’s a sensory onslaught of the first order, every single one of them suffocated underneath the sheer sexual energy Potter exudes. Something stops their backwards trajectory, and Potter’s hands slide up to Draco’s back to cushion him from the abrupt stop. Potter now has more leverage to press his muscled frame against Draco’s body, getting as close their clothes will allow. He doesn’t know what he’s been backed into—a wall, a door, a fuck-all piece of antique furniture—but it’s flat and vertical and gives Draco enough support to buck his hips into Potter’s. There’s a hard ridge of an erection that matches his own.
It's not his personal concoction; this is a brand used in all the guest rooms, specially imported from Wizarding France. Draco prefers citrusy scents, sometimes lavender, but this one is fresh and green, with a hint of juniper and an undercurrent of peppercorn. It smells like Harry.
Potter vibrated with anger, demanding an answer. "Then tell me why, Draco? If the answer is so obvious as to why I saved you, then why did
"My goodness, you're clingy this evening," Draco teased. "This wouldn't have anything to do with your visitor earlier, would it? Because if you're going to get handsy every time someone you don't like pops round-" Potter stopped in his tracks and pulled Draco sharply around to face him, cutting off his words.
"I went into your room," Potter said, suddenly more subdued, as if the memories were all catching up with him, "just to see if I could still smell you in there. Hear your heartbeat. But there was nothing. You were gone." He snapped his fingers, and Draco startled in surprise. "Like that."
"That's good, because my son is interesting. There's more to him than a handsome face."
Draco slid up and down his cock in a way that reeked of servitude. Desperately, Harry wished that he was just another nameless, faceless figure, one that his imagination could mold into something that mitigated his guilt. But he wasn't nameless.
Draco whimpers, and Harry's cock twitches at the sound.
Potter’s face tensed and a myriad of conflicting emotions danced in his eyes. An unmistakable yearning coupled with anger and regret. In that moment, Draco felt for Potter. And he knew that no matter how much of a bastard Lucius Malfoy had been, he would have given anything for an embrace and declaration of affection like that. Potter pulled back.
Potter rolled his eyes. "Really?" he said with a dry grin.
Potter rattled the magazine as he flipped another page, not sparing a glance for either of him.
"Draco?"
She prepares the tray and steps back, clasping her hands in front of her. She shifts from foot to foot, as if she has more to say.
Draco’s voice faltered. “I think we do our bleeding in a different manner now, don’t we?”
The afterglow is warm and sleepy, but Draco knows that this might never happen again. He waits the appropriate two minutes (not too short to be rude, not too long to be clingy) in Potter’s arms before shifting to get up and get dressed. But Potter’s having none of it. He tightens his hold on Draco and rolls them to the side. Draco chokes back a squeak because he’s never the little spoon. He’s not used to spooning.
Heat and fire and Harry zip through him, setting him ablaze. He's sweating, his back is aching, his balls are heavy and swollen, and his cock is harder in his hand than it's ever been. He knows he must look, whimpering and whining like a slut, needing to be fucked, needing to be filled with a want that is blind to everything in this world but what he thinks Harry's cock will feel like. Debauched, mouth open in an inelegant gape as he gasps for breath, body hunched and contorted so he can fuck his hand and his arse at the same time, the very picture of sin itself. But Harry's eyes look back at him with wonder. With approval. With want. It settles over him that this is how Harry sees him.
The vampire moved towards Draco a fraction and Potter snapped into action, stepping in front of him. Potter’s eyes were transfixed on the other vampire, not sparing a glance for Draco. His hand shot out behind him, and Draco felt a Shield charm rise in front of him like a wall.
Draco rocks against Harry's mouth as his legs shake to keep him upright. Harry feels his body flexing to maintain the posture.
Zabini is pale and speechless—two things he's probably never been before. That's satisfactory enough.
Narcissa holds her chin high, managing to look down on him even though he's a head taller. "Because Harry is powerful. He will always be powerful. Do you forget that he held the fate of our world in his hands? Do you forget that he could have become twice the Dark Lord Voldemort was? Harry is an extraordinary man without equal. All that power he holds in his hands, and what did he do with it?" Her stare is unwavering, as is the command in her voice. "
“I mean, does the thought of fucking a woman turn you on? All that creamy skin, soft curves, and say, a pair of tits made to fit in the palm of your hand?” He waved his finger in a circular motion at Potter’s crotch. “Lighting any fires?”
But for all Draco's responding, he's still got a lesson to learn. His behavior is self-indulgent, reckless and selfish, and it will lead them nowhere. Not if Harry lets it go unchecked. Harry pulls back and regards him with not with a glare, but with a stony countenance that exudes authority. If he balks now, there's very little hope in getting Draco to come around. But if he concedes, then Harry knows it's merely the matter of a firm hand before Draco settles and accepts what is happening between them. What could be inevitable. Harry's patient, but he's not interested in manipulating Draco to become someone he can't be. Experience tells him it's best to know now.
Potter's eyes shot to the floor and he mumbled, "Go without me."
"Lose the scarf, Draco."
Harry sheepishly sat in Professor McGonagall’s office, Malfoy was hunched over next to him, holding a tissue up to his bleeding nose. He was feeling very guilty for getting physical with the boy, they definitely have had their fair share of pretty intense arguments, but the only time they’d ever hurt each other was when Harry was snooping on Malfoy in sixth year. He hadn’t exactly deserved a broken nose but he definitely shouldn’t have been eavesdropping on Malfoy and his friends.
Harry let out a loud groan, not only did he have to room with Malfoy, he was now spending his entire week with the boy.
Harry thinks briefly, but nothing flashes his mind except from white light.
“You are both cleaning the trophy room this week, I will come get you both at eleven and I want to see some work done.” She said sternly, motioning for them to leave. Harry and Draco shuffled down to the trophy room in silence, buckets clattering together as they walked.
He looked at him, the boy who taught him how to love.
The ginger boy gives an unconvicted chuckle, Harry leans forward on his knees, exasperated. “You think I’m crazy…” The boy sits up, a smirk appearing on the sides of his mouth.
He looks up, and shakes his head. The woman makes no reaction, removing the picture, and giving him another one.
changes. “Okay, I have a lot of work to do here.” Draco motioned to the oddly coloured walls of the kitchen, Harry shoved him gently.
Ignoring the protests in his head, he moves to stand. The girl next to him pushes down more firmly on his shoulder, effectively shoving him back down onto the hospital bed. A taller boy comes to stand next to her, grabbing onto Harry’s other arm and helping him down too. His vision is still blurred, and Harry now assumes it’s not just from waking up, he can vaguely make out red hair, which sends a shiver down his spine.
He moved to open the door, he was just leaving when Potter’s voice stopped him.
“Oh Harry, why didn’t you come see me, I missed you!” Ginny kept hugging him and pulling away again, Harry felt very uncomfortable in this situation. “Ah you know, just busy”
It’s a group photo, of a few people, clad in black robes with contrasting reds, blues, yellows and greens. Harry scans the picture, there’s an oblong boy with substantially large front teeth who stands out, but he feels more like a distant dream than an actual person. His eyes stop, and a burst of memory shoves into him like a bus.
A knock on the open door alarmed him, Ron was leaning on the door frame, looking positively pissed off. "Oh" Ron sneered "so you're still alive" he grimaced at the sight of Malfoy for the first time in months. "Oh don't sound so disappointed Weasley, I might start to think you don't like me" The blonde boy strolled into the adjoining bathroom, Harry just mouthed at Ron to close the door and leave, giving him a look of
Draco's head fell back against the sofa, his eyes falling shut. He worked his hand over himself, his hips bucking up faintly. Harry felt a surge of confidence wash over him, standing up from where he was sitting, sauntering over and sliding down next to Draco. Before anyone could say anything or protest, he leaned over and whispered into the other boy’s ear.
The big grey house was a safe place for Draco when he was a child, but it was always tainted by darkness, evil was threaded through the walls, you could never rid yourself of the sick feeling it left in your stomach. All he wanted to do was get away from it, going to Grimmauld with the love of his life was exactly the fresh start he needed.
Draco impulsively reached for his glass, downing his shot in an instant; Pansy drank too. Blaise’s mouth hung open, “Pansy doesn’t surprise me, but you Dray?” Draco shrugged smugly, “Theo Nott, fifth year, a game of truth or dare.” he put his glass down, leaning back against the bed, chuckling to himself faintly.
The boy sneers at Harry, and then peers down his nose at McGonagall.
“Potter” He nodded shortly, shoving past him and walking out of the kitchen. Leaving Potter to do the morning oil checks.
Again.
big big kithes today
he recognises it.
“Look, I don’t care who you’re shagging, you’re eighteen now, I don’t control you and I never have. But I do hope you realise what you’re doing, this is Malfoy we’re talking about! This is seven years of shit we have to undo?!” Ron ran his hands through his hair, sighing. “You do what you want, I just don’t want you to be another notch on his bedpost. And I don’t mean to state the obvious Harry, but he’s a guy.” Ron motioned to Harry, he rolled his eyes.
Ron plopped down on the sofa next to him, out of breath and red faced. Harry closed his book, turning a little to face his friend. “I can’t believe we’re leaving tomorrow, it almost doesn’t feel real.” Ron was right, it didn’t feel real, even when he thought he was leaving Hogwarts, he was back again a year later. “No, it doesn’t” Harry agreed, letting his legs rest over Ron’s lap. “What are you and ‘Mione doing after school?” He asked his friend, Ron shrugged.

“Look he’s not interested okay? Take the hint and just sod off..” Draco trailed off, noticing the upset on the girl's face. She mumbled some sort of apology before darting out the front of the shop. He looked up at Potter, who was still clutching the back of the counter, staring intently at the floor. Draco’s eyes narrowed, a large burst of anger flew through him. He’d had the decency to stand up for his childhood enemy and the man couldn’t even spit out an a “thanks”
Harry had spent his entire life hating Malfoy, he blamed every little problem on him; convinced that the pretentious git was always up to something. When Malfoy switched sides, Harry had just assumed that it was his own choice. That had clearly been proven wrong when the boy threw his wand to him in the final battle.
You could feel the tension in the air. Yet Draco could not bring himself to say anything.
The blonde boy must be familiar, because Harry
“I think It's time we up the ante, truth or dare?” Pansy suggested, filling everyone's glasses again. Harry nodded, that did sound like a lot of fun. He kept drinking from his glass, as did the majority of the circle, no longer needing the excuse of never have I ever to neck back shots. “I suggested it so I will start, Hermione, truth or dare?” Hermione evaluated her options, before looking to meet Pansy’s eyes. “Truth.”
It was the only place they had left, a smile appeared on his face, bolting to the grounds.
tensions have to be released somehow
Harry's mind travelled back to his current problem, he had to get help with his potions work, but if Hermione couldn’t help, his list of smart friends that would be willing to help dwindled to zero. He felt like breaking down, his head fell into his hands, the weight of the world on his shoulders was pulling him down further into a hole; his inner quarrel with himself slowly taking over every other thought in his mind.
“Okay, okay! Never have I ever, had sex with someone in school?” Blaise giggled, his face shining from the alcohol, Pansy and Draco both drank, both laughing at the memories of their terrible relationship. Blaise shot them a surprised look, not touching his own glass. Pansy smacked her glass back down on the table, “my turn lovelys! Never have I ever kissed someone of the same gender?”
this is my favourite chapter i've wrote yay
“You have all been mind-numbingly boring since coming back, I think it’s time we spice things up.” Pansy wiggled the bottle, a smirk appearing on her face. “What do you say?”
Draco reached the old wood shed at the barriers of the Hogwarts grounds, he came here a lot during his sixth year, it was the sole place in the whole school that was completely secluded from everyone; the only other person that knew about his wood shed was Pansy Parkinson. She was the one that actually discovered it but they hadn't been there together since they broke up. They had a horrible relationship, it revolved around them getting wasted and having sex, they broke up when the war started since Draco was needed a lot away from Hogwarts and Pansy's parents were trying to get them to marry each other. They were still friends but had been distant since returning, Draco just guessed the war had hit her badly.
You could’ve heard a pin drop in the room, neither of them spoke a word to each other. The only sound that could be heard was the faint tick of the grandfather clock placed in the corner of the room. Harry glanced over to Malfoy, he was still staring intently at the floor; not a single word came from the usually very mouthy boy.
“It’s pathetic really, how much I hope it’s you and me in the end.”
“Draco”
The woman curtly takes the picture out of his hands, placing another one in quickly. “How about this?”
“So, am I getting the grand tour?” Draco gave Harry a wicked smile, before he was pulled up the stairs.
Sometimes home isn’t a place, it’s a person.
TW-it gets a lil spicy this chapter, nothing too graphic tho:)
A footstep in the hallway up ahead has Madam Pomfrey tugging Harry into an alcove, pulling a curtain. He squints at her, corners of his eyes crinkling.
long awaited:)
As soon as the great hall doors shut, Ron jumped at Harry, pinning him to the ground. “What the FUCK RON?!” Harry half shouted, half cried, Ron’s nails digging uncomfortably into his wrists, his head throbbing painfully from the force of hitting the stone floor.
Draco spluttered into his wine, shaking his head wildy. “Merlin no Potter, I was a spoiled git when we first met, and then I joined a cult, I don’t exactly think we would've been braiding each other's hair and wearing friendship bracelets.” Potter laughed, a real one, it was the first time Draco had ever heard him laugh a genuine laugh, it delighted him a little. “Plus the whole Gryffindor-Slytherin thing would’ve fucked things up a bit.” Draco added.
Draco pushed the door open, revealing a rooftop garden, red rose bushes were blooming from colourful pots, there was an extraordinary view of the extensive grounds lying beneath them. “Woah” Harry breathed, Draco pulled at their still connected hands, showing Harry out onto the deck.
Harry pulled away from Draco slightly, just enough so he could see his face. The moonlight was kissing his blonde hair, his cosmic eyes shimmering in the lowlight, his face pale except for a soft pink tinting his cheeks; gods Draco was simply exquisite.
His attention pulled back to the pot in front of him, it was simmering away nicely, releasing a pleasant lavender aroma. Draco grabbed a few of the jars labeled “Lavender milk bath” from the cupboard, ladling the liquid into them. This was undoubtedly his favourite part of working in the shop, he got to do all the packaging for their products; and he took great pride in making them perfect. Draco loaded up the bottles into a small wicker basket, kicking open the door to the main shop.
“So, I am here, reintroducing myself to all of you. Hello, I am Harry Potter, just a normal boy.”
“Harry?”
i can’t begin to describe how delighted i am at the love my fic has got, it went up so quickly and is still going!!
this is it, grab your tissues:’)
“I am here this year as a friend, a boyfriend, an enemy. I’m not here as a saviour, I am here as just a normal boy trying to finish his exams and get a job. I’ve had a moderately normal school year this time, and I can’t wait to spend the next few years living a quiet life. Hogwarts has always been my home, that will never change, but now I'm ready to move on.”
When Harry asked him to move into Grimmauld Place, it was their final day at Hogwarts, they were tangled up together in their dorm room and Harry had just blurted it out. It seemed like such an insane idea, but now that Draco was packing up his entire life into boxes, he couldn’t wait to be rid of the Manor.
Sharp.
, was he? Absolutely not.
apologies for the very late chapter today lol
second to last chapter:')
fair warning, this chapter is really long, make a cup of tea and enjoy...
“Harry, I need to know what you remember.” Her voice is stern, scaring Harry slightly. He opens his mouth to speak, but no words come out, because he doesn’t remember
He knew he was about to get into a stew of trouble, the boy who lived came with a huge price, one that Draco was willing to pay. Harry was pure trouble.
“Oh so it's official then?” She smirked, his eyes widened, “how did yo-”
Draco stood behind Harry, wrapping his arms around his waist, his face buried in the mess of Potter hair. He swayed them both gently, softly moving them to the music still playing on the radio. “It’s ready love” Harry kissed him on the cheek, turning off the stove. They both bumbled around the kitchen, Draco setting the table and lighting candles because “that’s how the Malfoy’s do it.” Harry plated up their food, adding the last little flourishes so it was
The short woman from earlier is sitting on the end of his bed, she is holding a stack of papers; a sharp frown hanging off the ends of her mouth.
ty for all the kudos:)
shit starts to happen next chapter hehehe stay tuned
He notices the smell before he notices the room, it’s chemically, combing through his nose; prodding at the already searing pain in his head.
Harry was gobsmacked, Draco had been just as into that kiss as he was, and now they were both sat across from each other, painfully hard and having no way to fix it.
ooooh angstyyyy
The dark, worn floorboards of the store bent and cracked to Draco's footprints. He wandered aimlessly through the shop, moving around certain glass jars and placing out the new stock he made last night. It was early, no one except him was in the shop yet; he liked it that way,
“Harry potter speaking?”
She turned to him, wearing a flowery dress. “Treat him right okay?”
“FUCK YOU RON!” Harry tried to push back against Ron’s hands, proving unsuccessful considering he was slammed back onto the floor in an instant. He felt a fist connect with his jaw, the pain searing through him, his ears were ringing but he could still blankly hear Hermione screaming for them to stop. Ron’s weight shifted off of him, standing up and towering over a whimpering Harry on the floor. “No, fuck you.” He grabbed Hermione’s hand and pulled her out of the Hallway.
this might be favourite chapter
(See the end of the chapter for
“Now i’m going to talk. First off, I’m not shagging him, we just have been getting on better recently, for merlin's sake we live in each other's pockets Ron! He's changed a lot, but so have I…” He trailed off, he had changed a lot in the past few months. He came into Hogwarts hating Draco Malfoy more than anyone else on the entire planet, now he was not entirely straight and slowly becoming obsessed with his roommate; for the second time in his life.
Draco’s eyes opened back up, grabbing for his wand to clean himself up, buckling his belt again. He sat up from Harry’s lap, but didn’t move off him completely, Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist. He turned his attention back to the game, boy had it changed since Harry had been enveloped in Draco.
yay we hit 400! thank you so much:)
Before Harry could even realise, he was being pulled up a set of twisty staircases, he never knew how big Malfoy Manor actually was. They kept running through corridors, up more stairs, and then they finally stopped. In front of a door, Harry could still hear the music from even this far away.
Harry gasped, his hands tangling up in Draco’s hair, the instantaneous pleasure rushing through him. “Good boy” fell from his lips, Draco moaned around his dick, sending wonderful vibrations into him. Draco had Harry fully in his mouth now, sucking him hard, his head hitting the back of the sofa; eyes screwed up in pleasure. Harry could feel Draco rutting up against his thigh, probably well on his way to coming for a second time.
“Did you enjoy snogging Draco?”
tomorrow's is gonna be a pretty exciting chapter so keep your eyes peeled;)
“No fucking way.” Draco removed his head from Harry’s shoulder, sitting up as straight as a board. Harry looked at him cautiously, confusion coursing through his face.
this was originally posted on wattpad but i have officially migrated to ao3!
Harry however, knocked on Ron’s door, surprised when it actually opened, he was fully ready for him to just slam the door in his face but Ron smiled, sadly, but he was still smiling. His face was red, his eyes bloodshot. “I’m sorry, truthfully, ‘Mione’s been working with me on my anger,I think you know more than anyone that I struggle with it.” Ron said sincerely, Harry nodded, laughing a little. “So will you let me apologise?” his friend  was trying to keep his cool, but his eyes were begging.
Harry sat in the room for ages after Malfoy left, just mulling everything over. It was well past midnight now, he could see the moon hanging high in the sky out the window. He looked down at his hands, the angry red marks around his wrists were burning with pain and his knuckles were all bruised from being pushed so hard against the concrete hallway. His whole body drooped down, Harry felt like he was to blame for the whole argument with Ron and tonight just proved his theory right.
“I think your story is crazy.”
Blonde, tall, sharp,
Draco rubbed a hand over his eyes, cursing himself for almost falling asleep again. He was cutting up hawthorn fruit, and it was taking bloody forever. Outside the door, he could hear the last bustle of the shop for the day, they’d be closing soon. Draco watched as he mindlessly cut up the fruit, it was something he’d done a million times now; but just because he could do it in his sleep, it doesn’t mean he should be nodding off with a knife in his hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry didn’t dare breathe, nor move. Draco placed two fingers under his chin, pulling his face up to meet his. He pressed his lips gently against Harry’s, he let out a content sigh. This kiss was different from the last, this wasn’t angry, this wasn’t unresolved sexual tension needing to be released with some sloppy snog. This was a genuine, intimate, sweet moment that Harry had been dying for. He just didn’t expect it from Draco Malfoy, but now that he got it, there was no way in hell he was stopping.
Harry and Draco make a huge mistake, Harry has a mental breakdown in the shower
“I want you, so much.” Harry paused at the door, his breath shallow in his throat. “You’re all I fucking think about.”
Draco was at the window, it was wide open and he was leaning out of it, a cigarette hanging out his mouth. He could hear the door open behind him, he didn’t turn around, he knew it was only Potter and he’d probably just crawl into bed like usual. He felt a tap on his leg, Potter was sitting down on the windowsill. Draco handed over his metal cigarette case but Potter didn’t take it, he looked over at the boy; he was white as a sheet and something was running around in his mind.
Harry studies the floor. He feels microscopic, like someone has just shoved him hard into the deep end of a pool, and his feet don’t touch the bottom but his head doesn’t go out over the top either. There's a burning question digging into the back of his head, he glances over at Madam Pomfrey and the other lady.
Harry was sweltering, he knew as soon as he agreed to speak at the graduation it was a really bad idea. He was an alright public speaker, but speaking about his life in front of his entire class made him want to vomit all over the floor. He ran over his speech for the hundredth time, he could see Ron doing the same out of the corner of eye. The door clicked open, Professor McGonagall was standing in the doorway. “It's time boys.”
But bloody Potter had to go and ruin that for him, what right did he have telling him to just forget about things? The anger rushed through again, he had to hit something, and that something was probably going to be Potter.
“Thank god you came back Harry, we thought you weren’t going to.” she admitted, casting a glare at her boyfriend.
He heard Hermione’s chair scraping against the floor, he winced, the sound piercing through his ears. “Let me know if you find someone.” She smiled, gathering up her stuff, she walked around the table; wrapping her arms around his neck from behind, feeling her warmth and smelling her flowery smell made him happy, but as soon as it was there it disappeared. “Have you been smoking, Harry?” Hermione recoiled, standing back from him with a revolted look on her face. Harry froze, he was unsure of what to say so he just nodded. “Seriously, do you have any idea how bad for you it is? Not only that it is disgusting!” Hermione scolded, Harry rolled his eyes. “If I wanted a lecture on smoking ‘Mione, ' I'd dig up my parents.” He said, dryly. He watched Hermione stomp out of the library, leaving only her floral smell behind.
Harry was reading in the common room, a place he hadn’t been in a few months, he figured he had to spend a little more time there considering he was leaving school forever tomorrow. Harry hadn’t even started packing up his stuff yet, he was planning on doing it tonight, he and Draco had made a pretty big mess of their room. There were exam papers, sheet music and textbooks scattered everywhere and Harry just couldn’t be bothered to clean all that up just yet.
i am sorry that there was no chapter last night, i had an absolute monster headache but i am totally fine now:)
Potter exhaled, fiddling with his hands, Draco clasped his hands around his, stopping him from shaking so much. “You’re okay,” Draco assured him.
Harry had been through so much during his life, Hermione knew that what he was doing was the best decision Harry ever made. She smiled, glancing over to Ron. “I’m so happy for him, you know? He deserves this.”
“I’m sorry, could you please tell me who you are?”
note- the oneshot is up! it's called "The rest of our life", please check it out if you can!!
It had quickly escalated into something that Harry could no longer describe.
Ron said flatly, Harry gulped, looking anywhere other than directly in front of him. Hermione’s gaze softened, touching Ron gently on his back; tucking a red curl behind his ear. “Maybe you should take this outside boys” she suggested sweetly, Ron shot up, almost knocking his plate over in his intensity. “Yes. I think we should.” He was bloody angry, and Harry guessed he was about to find out why.
“So i’ll ask again” he pressed
And that was it, he came with a shout, back arching; the remnants of “Harry” falling out of his mouth.
"Malfoy are you bleeding?!"
Potter was mumbling nervously, not meeting Draco’s eye. “Look Harry, you just had a panic attack, It’s not exactly the right time to start an argument with you.” he leaned back against the arm of the sofa. “As soon as we leave this room we can go back to hating each other.” Draco let one of his arms fall naturally over the back of the sofa, the other one resting in his hair. Potter got up, walking over to the drinks cart that had just appeared at his request, he poured two glasses of wine, heading back over to the sofa and handing one to Draco.
“Maybe the git just hit his head too hard on his ego.” He bites out, grey eyes narrowing at Harry. McGonagall just sighs, as if she’s dealt with this one hundred different times. “Away Mr Malfoy, come see me after dinner, we are not finished with this.” Experienced hands wave him away
“They'd say a lot.” Draco said, Harry stifled a snort. “Okay, okay! I’ll move in with you on one condition.”
The class let out some light laughs, Harry relaxed a little bit.
thank you all so much for everything, pls keep leaving comments i love u all
“I deserved it” Malfoy whispered, finally turning to look at him. The dried blood staining his mouth and chin, a bruise appearing under his eye. Harry let out a shaky sigh, the hurt threading through Malfoy’s face. This was the first time that Harry had heard Malfoy ever admit something was his fault, it was almost comforting? It let Harry know that something had shifted in the other boy's life, something for the better.
Hi there!
He wasn’t exactly sure why he thought of the library, he knew it was the only place where nobody would be; or think of going, a wicked smile appearing on his lips at the thought of the amount of
heres a kiss for u
Draco let the pan he was hovering over simmer on the heat, looking out of the kitchen door. Harry was sitting at the till, a pen wedged in between his lips, a look of concentration etched on his face. Draco's stomach flipped.
“I- um.” Harry starts, but it chokes in his throat. “I remember a bright light, and then a lot of pain, and then I woke up here.” The woman nods, edging closer to him cautiously. “And can you tell me anything about your life before the pain? Maybe something about your childhood?” She's less angry this time, comfort lacing her tongue.
“Am I up for ransom or something?” He smirks, leaning back against the stone wall, a cool droplet of water dripping onto his neck. Madam Pomfrey gives a half smile, but Harry can tell she’s trying hard not to laugh. “No Harry, but Weasely is right, you are famous and everyone here knows who you are, so we’re keeping you safe until we can sort you out.” She lets out a shaky breath, and He leans his head back, touching it to the stone. This was insane, he wasn’t famous, or popular, or a literal
“Hello, Lunars Apothecary store, how may I help you?” Draco grimaced at his embarrassingly posh phone voice.
Green eyes close, and sleep floods through him.
saw someone rec my fic on tiktok which was literally surreal, tysm for everything<3
them.
Harry sits himself back down, the white ceiling is still blurred, and for a moment, he thinks that maybe he’s hit his head
Harry and Ron followed their lifelong Professor out into the courtyard, the rows of white seats sitting out in the sunshine. He looked around for Draco, seeing the boy sitting in the front row next to Pansy and Blaise, Hermione on Pansy’s left; he was smiling widely. Harry felt all his nerves drain away in an instant.
sorry for a relatively slow start, shit starts to pick up next chapter:)

(See the end of the chapter for
Draco pulled Harry away as soon as he could, after this moment, the rest of their life started; they needed one last time to just be teenagers.
Draco was wandering around again, trying to find his two best friends, they weren’t in Pansy’s room, or in Blaises, and he couldn’t see them in both the great hall and the library. He’d almost ran out of places, but then one place crossed his mind.
“Yeah, we snogged once, dunno why.” Harry chuckled, his face flushing faintly at the memory of that night. Ron spun his chair to face Harry, a smile appearing on his face. “I’m sorry Harry, as long as he’s not being an arse to you, shag who you want.” Ron pulled Harry in for a hug and they just stayed there, holding each other for ages.
His eyes travelled over to his two best friends, they'd gotten together after the war and they were practically talking about marriage already. Hermione was asleep on Ron's shoulder, Ron was playing with her hair. Harry wanted to vomit, it's not even like they were snogging but after Ginny; Harry couldn't even stand to see anyone in a happy relationship.
the malfoy’s christmas ball arrives, draco comes to a conclusion
He appeared in Harry’s living room, he wasn’t there, but Draco could hear music playing somewhere in the house. He threw his bag down on the floor, opening the door into the main stairwell.
Harry tried to push down the potion still in his system, but the whole point was that it made you tell the truth. Meaning, he had to be honest.
“Draco!” Harry had caught up with him, walking next to Draco. “What time do you want me at yours next week?” he asked, Draco had almost forgotten that Harry was coming to the Manor, he heartbeat speeding up at the thought of Harry Potter being at his house in dress robes. “Seven” he choked out “I’ll see you then.” Harry beamed, a glint shimmering in his pretty eyes.
Everyone was gaping at him, they had every right to, even Harry was unsure of what had just happened. Their faces were all flushed, pupils blown wide, tugging at their clothes; the room was undeniably hot. Harry looked straight across the circle, Draco was sat back against sofa, knees pulled up to his chest, lips kiss bitten and swollen. His usually sickly pale face was crimson, a purple bruise turning up on his neck.
