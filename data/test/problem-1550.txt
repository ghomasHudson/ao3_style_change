Harry had made an effort to see Teddy and Andromeda once a week since the end of the war, he wanted to be a part of Teddy’s life, wanted Teddy to recognise him and grow up feeling loved and supported. Even with his regular visits however Harry still couldn’t quite believe how anything so small and fragile could exist. Teddy brought out a fierce protective streak in Harry that he’d never really acknowledged before. He had quickly realised that he would go to any lengths for this small and delicate person.
“Err… Hi Mr and Mrs Granger, how are you both?” Ron asked the two senior Grangers whilst simultaneously trying to shrink into his jumper.
“Come on ‘Mione what’s going to happen if they are? Its not like the Ministry’s going to let them all go, then ask them all to be back in a weeks time for their trials is it!” Ron said.
“Oh it shouldn’t take more than ten minutes if we all work together I’m sure, here let me explain” said Gobhar, stepping forward for the first time he had a high pitched voice and spoke incredibly quickly almost running his words together in his effort to get them all out.
“But” Dean continued, before glancing into the unlit hearth. “I don’t think he wanted to be a Death Eater.”
Harry just smiled, deciding he would have to introduce Ron to the rather impressive record collection he’d found hidden under the floorboards in Sirius’ old room at Grimmauld Place.
“Well there you go Mr Granger, Mrs Granger, thank you for your understanding, the ministry apologizes for the time we’ve taken out of your day, especially as I’m sure you’d rather be spending it catching up with your daughter. Now we really must be off. Mr Potter it’s been an honor” Ramshorn said all this in the same brisk manner she had held throughout the rest of the morning, but when she turned to Harry there was a light shining in her eyes that gave away just how much she meant her last statement.
Harry made a beeline for the large yellow number three sign the message board had instructed them to go to, Ron trailing along behind him still looking around with a puzzled expression plastered across his freckled face.
Harry listened to the conversation as it continued to develop. It soon moved off the topic of the Malfoy’s and the trials, onto more mundane subjects. Harry however kept quiet throughout the remainder of breakfast. Cool grey eyes, full of fear and self-doubt taking his thoughts down to those dark places where he spent so much of his time these days.
“And what exactly are these tests may I ask?” Mr Granger asked looking seriously at the women. “I hope they won’t take long, I don’t want to have to book into a hotel for the night if I can avoid it, I’ve spent too long away from my own bed already” He glanced quickly in Hermione’s direction before looking back at Ramshorn. It was only a slight flicker of the eyes, but his implication had been implicit. Ron slid his hand into Hermione’s giving it a gentle squeeze.
“I don’t know if that’s entirely fair Neville,” Luna said making everyone look at her in bewilderment. “I can’t speak for Narcissa or Lucius. But Draco was only young when the war started.”
Mr and Mrs Granger on the other hand did not look nearly as impressed, if anything Mr Granger looked more dubious than when they had first arrived and Mrs Grangers face hadn’t been quit the right shade of pink since the small Wizard had mentioned getting blown up.
Turning around Harry saw a medium sized house. It had pale grey stone walls, a short, wrought iron fence and flower baskets hanging from the upstairs windows. It would be almost picture perfect if it weren’t for the obvious months of neglect. The flowers in the hanging baskets had all died, giving way to over grown weeds and the paint on the front door had started to peel off in a few places. The over all effect was one of a once loved property left to be forgotten, it was quite sad to look at really.
Harry stared after the two wizards in horror; they had been talking about Malfoy. Harry couldn’t quite get his head together; they had been talking about Draco Malfoy an eighteen-year-old human like he was some kind of filthy animal. Malfoy was an arse and a bigot but he was still human!
With a tiny flick of her wrist the top of the bag sprung open. Harry watched as what must have been everything the Grangers owned poured out of the bag. Pots and pans flew out one at a time, heading straight for the kitchen. Bedding and mattresses headed up the stairs and out of sight, followed shortly after by a couple of bedframes and several very delicate looking Tiffany lamps. Ron was forced to dive out of the way of a dining table making it’s way through to the conservatory. A line of chairs following it like ducklings following their mother to the nearest pond. Last were a sofa and matching chair that squeezed out of the impossibly small hole in the top of the bag. Settling themselves down on the red paisley patterned carpet with a gentle thump.
“Merlin, sorry I know you probably don’t want to talk about this” Harry said quickly, sounding tired.
“He is also charged” the spider like attorney continued. Glaring now, directly at Malfoy, his arms folded over his narrow chest. “Of harbouring and abetting the Azkaban escapees from both the ninety-six and ninety-seven breakouts, the Werewolf Fenrir Greyback and You Know Who himself. However his final and most reprehensible crime is that of bearing The Dark Mark, marking him incontrovertibly as a member of the self named terror group The Death Eaters.”
Harry’s days were long and hard. He spent most of them helping Mrs Weasley around the house, cleaning and gardening, at this point the garden had been de-gnomed so many times that the gnomes were starting to only come out at night. This had lead to several midnight de-gnoming sessions that had only been put to a stop when a miss thrown gnome had flown straight through Mr and Mrs Weasleys open bedroom window. The senior Weasleys had been woken up rather abruptly when said gnome had landed firmly on their bed and preceded to cause havoc and quite a lot of damage. It had taken nearly two hours to get the gnome back outside and had caused Mrs Weasley to ban all outdoor activities after the sun had gone down.
Hermione stood there for a second, her lower lip trembling. Then she bowed her head and turned to leave.
“Good morning Harry” Percy said rather pompously as he finally looked up from the paper he was reading, just as Harry started spooning in the first of his many sugars. Percy Weasley was still incredibly pompous and entirely as full of himself as he had always been, but since the final battle there had been a marked difference in him as he attempted to repair the relationship with his family that had broken down in the years running up to the war. He was quicker to make a joke and seemed less likely to judge things as he had when he was younger.
“You have seen and fought all of that?” Mrs Granger said, fixing a wide-eyed stare on her only child.
Harry felt his chest tightening; he and his friends were quite literally trapped in this very small box. The lift wobbled as eight reporters tried to step in, cramming Harry right back into the corner. The lift surly couldn’t hold this many people Harry thought. The cable would snap under the strain, come to think of it Harry wasn’t even sure the ministry lifts had cables, were he and his friends suspended above some unknowable drop by nothing more than a charm of some sort. Could the enchantment hold out with so many people trying its limits? There were too many people jostling Harry. He didn’t have enough space, he couldn’t breath and his vision was starting to go hazy. He couldn’t see, his whole body felt ridged, like he’d been put in a full body bind and no matter how he tried to move to get himself to safety to find his way out he couldn’t.
“Oh Ron! Harry! How are you both? How is everyone doing? How is Dean? It’s just awful I didn’t know what to do when I heard what had happened, he must be distraught.” She said all in one giant rush. Harry had almost forgotten how fast she could speak when she was concerned about something or someone.
“Bloody hell, I’ve not seen Dad’s new office yet. About time they moved him out of that fucking cupboard.” Ron knocked on the mahogany wood and pushed it open at Mr Weasley’s summons.
After taking a breath to wipe her eyes, she spoke of Neville killing Nagini and fighting Bellatrix with Ginny and Luna just before Molly killed her. At last she spoke of Harry and Voldemorts final duel and Harrys victory.
“Oh yeah, of course, Er can I leave Ron here? He’ll be a bugger if we try to wake him.” Harry replied.
“DEPULSO!!!” a bluish white wave of energy shot through the compartment pushing the reporters out with an unnaturally strong force. The lift doors shut and Hermione quickly lowered her wand, darting forwards to press the number three button on the wall.
“Hello Teddy” Harry cooed as he gently trotted over to his tiny godson. Reaching out to him Harry gently tickled Teddy’s belly.
Also as a side note some people weren't pleased with the way Harry was thinking at the end of the last chapter. I'd like to highlight that this is how Harry is thinking as the story is from his perspective. Harry has a tendency to see the best in people and be a saviour thats kind of one of the building blocks of his character. Whatever you think of my writing, I'm doing this for fun and to destress from the plague thats happening, especially as I'm high risk. I don't need any more negativity right now please remember that when commenting. if your genuinely enjoying it though and are being nice I'm sorry for making you read this aggy little message. love to you all XX
“Fucking hell!” Ron nearly shouted almost falling to the floor as a jumbo jet flew only a hundred feet or so over the glass ceiling. “That things almost as big as a full grown Ridgeback Harry” he said looking rather alarmed.
Mr Granger’s lips thinned as he watch Hermione put her hand over her right arm, covering the scar left by Bellatrix after their imprisonment at Malfoy Manor.
“Your right of course, but Lions aren’t usually capable of killing eight men from forty feet away by burping. Wings and fire tend to make people a little more antsy.” Chuckling Andromeda put the book back down and reached over for Teddy. “Right come hear you great lump! Nanny Andy needs to give you some lunch.”
“It’s not your job to care anymore Harry. You know that right? You’ve done your bit.” Dean said seriously.
Harry however was going to make damn sure that life turned out better for Teddy than it had for him. Not that he had to work that much, Teddy was already in a home that loved and wanted him. All Harry had to do was keep that world safe for him.
Hermione had to physically bat away a large grey bird that was attempting to land on her head, presumably mistaking her bushy brown hair for a nest. Crookshanks jumped at it hissing and arching his back before leaving in search of a calmer place to knap.
Ron finished his outburst standing squarely in front of Mr Granger, his chin jutted forwards and his eyes bulging ever so slightly.
“Yes, yes, it all been so very exciting to meet you all, I can’t wait until my Milly hears about it. Once again thank you to all three of you, you have no idea how much your heroics mean to so many, they wont be forgotten, I can promise you that! They most definitely will not!”
“I would of wanted you to come to us!” Mr Granger bellowed, spittle flying everywhere and his face going such a deep shade of beetroot, even Uncle Vernon would have been impressed. “We could of helped you, protected you, you silly girl. THAT’S OUR JOB!!!!”
Conjuring a glass and filling it with a quick ‘Aquamenti’ Harry took a few calming sips of water, Harry closed his eyes leaning his head back against the wall behind him.
Mr Granger gave them both a small nod. “It’s good to see you both again boys, I’m glad we’ve been given the chance.” He said rather gruffly, the note of accusation in his voice wasn’t hard to miss.
“The Defence” Nyxia replied as she raising her chin to the Gamot “Pleads Guilty on all charges your honour’s.”
“Is that what the scar on your arm means Hermione?” Hermione’s mother said looking at her, a crease forming between her dark brows. “I saw it before we got on the plane, ‘Mudblood’ it’s a slur about having a Muggle family isn’t it?”
Hermione put her rucksack down in the centre of the Grangers living room and stepped back. The house was almost bare; obviously her parents had taken most of their belongings with them when they had emigrated to Austrailia. The only things left were a few pictures on the walls. Most contained family photos left to gather dust after her parents packed to leave, unable to see or even remember that the photos existed.
Harry was trembleing from head to toe by the time the glass shimmered, shifting back to a swirling silver mist. Ron shot up, managing to stumble to the kitchen before he throwing up all over the red terracotta tiles.
“Well Mr Granger the threat from the radical group known as the Death Eaters has indeed passed and it’s now safe for those in danger, such as yourselves, to return to normal life. But we have no idea what, if any, curses were placed on your residence or the surrounding area during the war. These could be anything from simple tracking spells to highly lethal hexes that could be triggered by the presence of certain people. As we speak Ministry Aurours”
as Ron put it earlier. And what sort of dangers my daughter has gone through. Especially that one or more of them left her feeling there was no other course of action but to remove herself from our memory entirely. Please Hermione, it’s becoming blatantly clear that you have not been telling us about large parts of your life for several years now, and I think we deserve to know why.”
“Finally realised his precious mummy and daddy aren’t going to get him out of this one, got enough on their own plaits” the other said with just as little sympathy.
Harry went to step in and try to control the situation, but before he could move more than an inch he felt Ron’s hand tighten around his wrist. “Don’t mate, this is one she’s got to finish herself”, the red head murmured into his ear, giving his wrist a gentle squeeze before letting go.
“You made us think we wanted to move to another country. You ripped yourself out of our lives and made us forget who we are. Why? And don’t give us the half truths and platitudes you have obviously been feeding us since you restored our memories. We deserve to know the truth, we deserve that much” he was looking directly at his daughter now. It was the first time he’d done that all day; as far as Harry could tell. Pain and betrayal filled his eyes. It was almost too much to look at.
“Harry!” she called, rushing out to give him a huge hug and covering him in flour. “It’s so good to see you dear, come on in. I’m just making a banana bread”
Rapwinder bowed his head, a sly smile curling his lips awhen he passed Nyxia Greengrass as she took the floor.
“What Hermione said was true Mr Granger” Ron piped up looking at his girlfriend with a worried expression. “The Death Eaters were a bunch of blood puritanical madmen, honest.” Hermione gave a small huff of humourless laughter, looking at Ron with a weak smile before catching Harry’s eyes.
TW - grafficish descriptions of emaciation and prisoner mistreatment, kind of. Please if its upsetting you skip the first paragraph and put your health first.
“Stan Shunpike though! He was obviously imperiused. I mean come on Hermione, the guy’s a bus conductor.” Harry couldn’t believe anyone would seriously think Stan believed in blood supremacy.
“You really should be more careful Mrs Tonks, just because the war’s over doesn’t mean it’s entirely safe yet. They still haven’t caught all the Death Eaters.”
It was well past two thirty in the morning when Ron fell asleep. Harry and Dean had been playing two against one with him for the past two hours, and had still lost three games.
“Great Merlin, what are they saying now?” Harry asked hopelessly. Ever since the Battle Harry’s fame had only increased, it didn’t seem like a day went by that there wasn’t some mortifying story about Harry splashed across every paper’s front page. The stories ranged from deeply embarrassing speculations as to his relationships with his friends to incredibly invasive biographies of his early life. The most ridiculous so far had been an article that had suggested that Harry and Ron were secretly dating and Ginny and Hermione were merely helping to hide it from the rest of the world.
Another flick of Hermione’s wrist and the lamp was back to its original form. No one would have known anything strange, or beautiful had ever happened to it.
“Harry Potter you are far too kind and by far too stupid for your own good. You always seem to look for the light in whomever your path crosses, whether that be for your benefit or not. It’s reckless and dangerous and quite frankly far too admirable in my book.”
“As for Hermione’s involvement, I’m afraid that has a lot to do with me Mr and Mrs Granger. You see there was a prophecy that said that only I could kill Lord Voldemort and stop the war, unfortunately Voldemort had used Dark magic to make himself very hard to kill and there were a number of dark artifacts I needed to destroy in order to finally defeat him. I will not lie to you. What I had to do was very dangerous. Quite frankly if I’d tried to do it alone, as I’d intended to, I would be dead and Voldemort would still be in power. However being my best friends and knowing what was at stake, both Ron and Hermione decided to help me. I know I shouldn’t of let them come with me and I’m truly sorry for putting your daughter in danger.”
Harry stared at the parchment. So they were about to begin. Harry had known that the trials would start soon, but he had been doing his best to avoid thinking about them. The idea that he would have to sit in that cold cave of a court and talk about the events of the war, some of his most traumatic experiences, probably multiple times was terrifying. Not to mention that Harry would be forced to face people who had been trying to torture and kill him, only two months ago.
“Not that we’d of given you any bloody choice mate, you needed us. Of course we were there” Ron said sounding very serious,
“I’m really sorry about that Mrs Granger” Ron said looking at Hermione’s mother in extreme embarrassment.
“Mum!” Hermione said in surprise remembering her parents and the whole reason for the nightmarish display they had all just witnessed.
“Ok” Harry pressed on. “When I was at the Ministry today I heard these guards coming off shift. They were talking about Malfoy. Apparently he’s not doing well in custardy. I know he should be there. He needs to answer for his crimes but honestly Dean the way they were talking about him, it was inhumane.”
“I completely agree Ron, such an odious woman” Hermione replied. “Still I had a little word with Kingsley on our way out of the court room. Apparently Greyback’s trial should finish tomorrow, he’s got life obviously. Anyway Kingsley hinted that the only cell able to hold him was the one right opposite Umbridge’s.
“Anyway” He said, taking a deep breath. “You need to know that I let her down. When we were hunting the Horcruxes. We’d been at it for weeks and we weren’t getting anywhere, we were hardly eating and that bloody locket was driving us all crazy. Voldemort had taken over and his followers were picking off anyone that opposed him one, by one. I didn’t know if my family were alive or safe and was getting desperate. We had an argument and I left. I regretted it the second I’d gone and I tried to get back to them, I really did, but I couldn’t find them. I was scared and stupid and I put them both in danger. I’m sorry, I’m sorry because I know I don’t deserve Hermione’s forgiveness or yours, but I do love her and I’ll bloody well fight tooth and nail to keep her safe. So you can think what you like of it and of me, but now you know and you can do with it what you will”.
The next thing any of them knew Mrs Granger had crossed the living room and pulled her daughter into the fiercest hug Harry had ever seen.
As she began bickering with the twins, Hagrid clapped Harry and Draco on the back and headed towards the Leaky Cauldron. Harry and Draco headed up the street where they could see Ron and Hermione waiting. After joining up with them, they headed into the Apothecary and got potion ingredients, then wandered a bit (the boys stopped to look at racing brooms, where the Nimbus 2001 was sitting in the window) and eventually came up to Flourish and Blotts. They were surprised that, when they stepped in, the bookstore was packed full of people. Draco stood up on his toes, looking for his father among the crowd, and then fell back down with no luck. After a moment, it became apparent why it was so full in here; a handsome wizard stepped up in front of the crowd, grinning out at the crowd.
Speaking of which... That was something that Draco had noticed lately. Where he'd seen Ginny awkwardly avoid Harry with a scarlet face, and Ron occasionally staring at Lavender Brown ("I was staring into space, not at
"I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets, professor." Hermione asked, a little breathless from how quick she shot the words out.
Harry looked up at him, in what almost seemed to be shock, while Arthur and his sons glared up at him.
Hermione and Ron muttered their agreement, and Hermione put her book back in her bag. She was reaching for her schedule when Ron noticed something peculiar and snatched it up before she could do anything.
"I simply told my son I would meet him here when we finished our respective errands. Is that such a crime, Weasley?" Lucius responded, his voice and gaze cold.
That did it. Arthur threw Ginny's cauldron and books aside and lept at Lucius as Draco jumped to the side, mildly horrified. They scrapped for a moment before Hagrid parted the crowd and pulled them apart.
That really got their attention. Everyone in the room fully sat up and looked at Professor Binns. From his expression alone, it was clear that in the many
"I mean, obviously," Harry said with a roll of his eyes, "but it was something else. Something... violent."
Ron and Draco exchanged a look. "There shouldn't have been anyone but you and Lockhart in that room, Harry," Ron pointed out.
"Well, we all make mistakes." Hermione said, freezing another pixie. "And look at the things he's done!"
They turned back to the front, where Lockhart was talking and gesturing animatedly. Ron rolled his eyes and pushed through the crowd, accidentally stepping on the photographer's foot as he did so.
He'd heard of the Chamber of Secrets, discussed by his parents with each other or with old family friends in hushed whispers when they thought he was asleep. Tales of a monster, of purebloods and mud bloods, of purification and of legacies, and, oddly enough, of the Dark Lord, he who shall not be named. Beyond that, however, he realized that he knew close to nothing about the Chamber itself. But now, it seemed like he was likely to get a front row seat to whatever it was that was that might occur. And, as luck would have it, the doors to the Great Hall are flung open, and students begin to rush down the halls, straight towards where Ron, Draco, and Harry are standing. It seems that most of the school ends up, there, stopping dead in their tracks and staring, with their jaw's agape, at the writing on the wall and Mrs. Norris hanging like some kind of sick Christmas decoration.
As more students filed in, Draco leaned back in his chair and whispered to Harry; "Are you alright? Your face is still really red."
After the class had settled in, Lockhart turned and grinned at all of them, before picking a book off the top of his stack. "Welcome, students, to the best class you'll have all year!" Lockhart smiled widely at the class, and Draco heard Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown giggle from the back of the class. "Now, I'm going to start you off with a simple quiz. So long as you've all read the books, there's no reason you shouldn't pass with flying colors!"
So I've been rereading the books as I've been writing the series to keep them somewhat accurate, and MY GOD. I forgot just how much happens in the Chamber of Secrets. Unfortunately, it's also my least favorite book. So I'm sorry if the chapters aren't as good as they should be. I promise they'll pick up after this part of the fic, but for now... Let's just say that criticism is fair and warranted here.
Arthur glanced down at Draco, who had never felt more awkward in his life. He knew that Lucius was his father, and he should defer to him, but he was also friends with the Weasleys and thus didn't want to isolate himself from what few friendships he had managed to make thus far. He sent a pleading glance up at his father, who caught his eye and hesitated.
Hanging, stiff and lifeless, beside the words was the caretaker's bad tempered cat, Mrs. Norris. Draco felt his breath catch in his throat as he read the message again, and again. This couldn't really be happening... There was no way.
"We were going to meet Harry after his detention with Professor Lockhart, sir." Ron said quietly. "We just..." he trailed off here, and Draco was fairly certain he saw some blood drain from Harry's face.
Relieved, the four of them thanked their Professors, and scrambled out of the office and up the stairs towards Gryffindor tower. It's just a shame that a lot of other students didn't see things the same way that McGonagall and Dumbledore did.
"Cut the pleasantries, Borgin." Lucius snapped. "Let's get this over with; I passed Arthur Weasley in Diagon Alley and I'd rather not have this transaction broadcasted to the Ministry."
He stopped, staring open mouthed at the three Gryffindors as Hermione also pushed her way to the front of the crowd, glancing in horror between the writing on the wall, and her three friends. Dumbledore stepped forward, a grim look on his face, before turning to the other three.
"He's mad! Absolutley idiotic!" Draco hissed as he made a grab at another, which stuck it's tongue out at him and cackled.
Dumbledore chuckles a little, and gazes out kindly at the quartet. "Mischief makers though you four may sometimes be, I don't believe you've ever been trouble. Perhaps you should head back to the common room for the night?"
Draco and Ron exchanged a look. "I think I heard the pipes hissing..." Draco suggested, frowning. "But no-"
McGonagall looked shocked at the suggestion. "Of course not. Dumbledore and I highly doubt you four had anything to do with this. Despite your record for... mischief in the past, this goes far beyond anything you've lost points for in the past." She smiles a little, and adjusts her glasses. "Beyond that, I like to think better of my students."
And chaos quickly ensued. At least 5 of them smashed the windows and headed out towards freedom, covering the back row in shattered glass. Two more had grabbed Neville by the ears and were lifting him into the air. The rest rocketed around the classroom, and most of the Gryffindors quickly headed towards the door as Lockhart dived under his desk just as the chandelier Neville was hanging from gave way, sending him crashing to the floor. Neville staggered up and sprinted out the door, with Lockhart close behind. As he stopped byt he door, he turned to the four of them and said, "well, I'll just leave you lot to take of them! I'm sure you can do it." And with that, Lockhart was gone.
The next day, after receiving their schedules at breakfast and rather difficult Herbology and Transfiguration lessons, the four were sitting in the courtyard beneath an overcast sky. Hermione had her head buried in one of Lockhart's books, and Harry, Ron, and Draco were talking about Quidditch. Draco had just gotten started on a tactic he had noticed at a game this summer, when Harry suddenly broke away from the conversation, looking up at a shadow in the corner. The shadow shifted into the daylight and revealed itself to be a first-year Gryffindor, clutching a muggle camera.
Draco and Ron were quick to follow after him and almost slipped in the water that coated the floor a couple of halls down. As they slipped and stumbled forward, they soon came across the source of whatever Harry was following...
Just as Theo was about to open his mouth to say something else, another voice sounded from the stairs leading up from the grounds. "What's this I hear about a signed picture?"
As he was being steered back onto Diagon Alley, Draco looked over his shoulder and said in a quiet voice to Ron, Harry, and Hermione "I'll see you at school."
"I suppose..." Binns murmured, then sighed and laid the chalk down, turning to fully face the class. "The Chamber of Secrets is a legend as old as Hogwarts itself," he began. "The story was born from the split of Salazar Slytherin and the rest of the founders.
To say the tension in the hall could be cut with a knife was a massive understatement. Draco Malfoy and Ron Weasley stood outside Lockhart's classroom, waiting for Harry to get out of detention so they could walk with him back to the common room. Normally Hermione would have been there to provide a barrier, but she had insisted on staying behind and studying. Both Ron and Draco were fairly certain she just wanted to reread Lockhart's books and
Lockhart waved his wand, and a few moments later a few sheets of paper landed in front of each student. Draco picked up the one on top and glanced at it as he fished his quill and ink out of his bag. He glanced away for a moment, then snapped back to the paper, certain he had read it wrong because there was
"I know," she said, her lips as thin as Draco had ever seen then. "With me, all four of you." She said, shooting a meaningful look at Hermione as she led them away from the writing on the wall and to her office. The quartet trailed after her, and Draco was certain that his heart was going to beat right out of his chest.
"Well, well..." Lucius whispered, gathering the attention of the Weasley's and Harry. "You must be the famous Harry Potter. Draco has told me
Granted, that someone was Hermione, but she managed to get the entire classes' attention. Binns mumbled on for another two minutes before he turned and noticed her hand straight in the air, and the entire class staring at her in silent shock and awe. He frowned, and gestured at her "Yes, Miss Grant?"
Over the week, Draco noticed students from the other houses, including Slytherin, whispering about him as he walked past. Though this in itself wasn't unusual, the content of the whispers was. "Pureblood family..." some would mutter, "Father was supposed to be one of
Hermione stopped a few of them with a freezing spell, while Ron and Harry jumped up trying to catch one. Draco managed to snatch a few out of the air, which Hermione then froze, and stuffed them into the cage.
She ushered them into her office, and they stood nervously, as she leaned forward and fixed all of them with a cold stare. Draco was fairly certain that if looks could kill, all four of them would have fallen dead on the spot. He swallowed hard, and quickly turned his gaze to his feet, rather than look up at the professor, who was leaning onto her desk, silent. A few moments later, Dumbledore stepped into the office as well, looking far more grim than Draco had ever seen him. Dumbledore stepped up next to McGonagall's desk and fixed them all with an impenetrable stare.
Theodore Nott pushed his way to the front of the crowd, and grinned up at the wall. In his ridiculously nasally voice, he said, "Enemies of the heir beware! That means you'll be next, mudb-" he was unable to finish his sentence, as he was practically shoved over by Percy Weasley as he rushed to the wall, McGonagall, Snape, and Dumbledore hot on his heels.
"We stumbled upon it while we were heading towards the Great Hall," Draco finished, and he thought he saw Harry's shoulders relax a bit.
Draco likes to think he's afraid of very little. Maybe it's just a Gryffindor thing, but he's always considered himself to be fairly fearless. He's starting to think that maybe it's just him; the chamber opens and suddenly Draco is facing a situation within which he is completely safe, while his peers and friends find themselves in more trouble than he could ever imagine.
Lucius sighed, then nodded and headed out. Borgin headed into a back room with the list, muttering quietly to himself. Draco was about to open the cabinet when it suddenly slammed open. Draco cried out, and stumbled back and falling. To his shock and surprise, Harry stepped out of the cabinet, covered in soot and clutching broken glasses. He looked down at Draco, who looked back up at him incredulously.
a teacher would give out a quiz like this. The questions had nothing really to do with defense magic or even the dark arts; they were all about Lockhart himself. It included questions like
"Yes! Everyone's told me loads about you, and I'm sending pictures home to my dad. I thought it would be really cool if I had one of you! Maybe you could even sign it?" Collin said, speaking so fast he ran out of breath.
!"), and of course Hermione's infatuation with the handsome Lockhart, Draco had noticed that he didn't seem to exhibit any of the same behaviors. That wasn't to say he wasn't attracted to anyone... Hermione was right, Lockhart was really handsome, and had Blaise Zabini always been that pretty...?
A soft bell rang through the shop as Lucius Malfoy pushed the door open, Draco trailing just behind him. While Draco had been to Nocturne Alley with his father before, it always made him a little uncomfortable; something about the atmosphere and lingering dark magic that accompanied the shopping district. Borgin and Burke's was empty, aside from a withered old man with small, black eyes standing behind the counter. He glanced up from the old glass he was polishing and grinned. Draco noticed that he was missing most of his teeth.
"I do not!" Mrs. Weasley hissed, swatting him lightly on the shoulder and making the twins and Draco snigger.
pictures? Potter's giving out signed pictures?" a reedy and nasally voice said from the other end of the courtyard. Draco and the others turned to look and saw Theodore Nott walking towards them, Crabbe and Goyle at his heels. Draco felt a familiar knot of anger coil in his chest; they used to be
"I thought I heard someone talking in detention..." Harry muttered, and Draco couldn't help but smirk.
After about ten minutes, Lockhart collected the quizzes, then tutted aloud as he began to berate the class for answering most of the (ridiculous) questions wrong. He was flipping through and noticed that Hermione seemed to have gotten every single one right. Draco was grateful for it, as it earned Gryffindor ten points, but he resisted the urge to roll his eyes; of
The sound of the door to Lockhart's classroom opening shook Draco out of his thoughts and broke the tension. See, it wasn't that Draco didn't like Ron, but given the fact that they had grown up with completely different world views, they definitely weren't the closest out of the quartet. In fact, Draco often felt he was isolated from all three of them. Again, this could be attributed to the difference in his background from theirs, but...
still some things he hadn't quite grappled with. The idea that muggles weren't a problem, weren't a genuine threat anymore. The fact that being Pureblood really didn't matter nearly as much as he thought it did.
"Why, Master Malfoy!" Borgin said, his eyes tracking Lucius as he headed toward the counter. "What do I owe the pleasure for a visit from your esteemed-"
Draco was sitting behind Harry by the window in History of Magic, very nearly put to sleep by Professor Binns usual droning. He wasn't even certain what this lesson was on... or any other lesson this year, now that he considered it. His mind was somewhere between pumpkin pasties and, oddly enough, Dobby, when something happened that no one in the class had ever seen before;
Draco's thoughts were no longer on mundane topics like food and house elves. Instead, his mind had drifted to the Chamber, and it's purpose. Did people really think he wanted to remove muggleborns from the school...?
"Think it's funny, eh?" Lockhart said, still smiling. "Well, let's see you take them on then!" and with a dramatic flourish, he pulled open the cage.
"I was with my father," Draco said, and offered nothing else; he didn't quite know what his father was doing down there.
"Oh, Harry! I was so worried!" she fussed, using her wand to remove the rest of the soot and fix his glasses.
Draco has yet to really come to terms with the fact that his parents' views were... wrong. Cruel, even. Especially given the love and kindness they've always shown Draco, who will always see them as being good people, perhaps as a direct result of their care. But when suspicious eyes turn towards him, Draco must finally face the prejudices he was raised with head on.
my son keeps." Lucius hissed, his eyes darting towards Hermione's parents who were standing awkwardly to the side.
They swarmed around, jabbering with high pitched voices, and rattling the cage. They were bright blue, and maybe 4 inches tall with little dragonfly wings. Immediately, Seamus and Dean burst into laughter in the front row, and Neville straightened up as Draco tried to hold in his own laughter. The Pixies were annoying maybe, but they weren't vicious by any means, and Draco was pretty sure they couldn't smell fear.
"Percy, get the other prefects together and have them bring their houses back to their common rooms immediately. Snape, stay here and keep anyone front interfering. McGonagall-"
"I know, but-" Harry suddenly stopped in his tracks, eyes wide. "Did you guys hear that? That's the voice!"
"Ah, Harry! Should have known it was you! Well come here now, you too Mr. Creevey, and you can get a picture of the two of us, and we'll both sign it!" Lockhart grabbed Harry by the wrist as he said all of this, pulling him into his side with an arm draped over his shoulders. Collin took a few pictures and thanked them in a stuttering voice before hurrying off. With little ceremony, Lockhart guided Harry off up into the castle while the others watched, dumbstruck.
Draco opened the door, and he and Harry stepped out onto the dark street. They kept their heads down and headed up the street. They were rounding a corner, when...
"I suppose not. Doesn't explain why you're bothering to speak to me, though." Mr. Weasley responded.
"But sir, don't all legends have some bit of history behind them?" Hermione insisted, and the class muttered in agreement, staring eagerly up at their professor.
As Harry stumbled back over to them, a collection of Lockhart's books in his hands (which he gave to Ginny), Draco felt a familiar hand rest on his shoulder.
"It's coming from over there!" Harry said, taking a step forward. All the blood suddenly drained from his face as he turned and sprinted around the corner, shouting over his shoulder, "it's going to kill someone!"
Lockhart seemed to overhear the squabble and turned to look at them, at first he seemed to pay them no mind, then his eyes settled on Harry and he stopped midway through his speech.
He sighed to himself, as he and Ron followed him down the hall and back towards the Gryffindor Common room.
Just as he was certain that voice was about to come back full force, Lockhart grabbed the classes attention at the front of the room. Sitting on his desk was a large cage, covered with a large cloth. Lockhart looked out with a very serious expression. "Now, it is my job to teach you all how to protect yourself from the vicious creatures that reside out in this large world of ours. I ask now that you try not to scream and remember..." he looked around the room and Draco noted that Neville was cowering in his seat next to him, "they can smell fear."
I'm back, specifically to piss on JK Rowling's grave (who may still be alive but is dead to me) because after everything we deserve ACTUAL LGBTQ+ representation in the Harry Potter books, and as a queer woman who struggled with her own sexuality during grade school, I am determined to see it through. And pile on as many parallels to the Marauders as possible because that's what you guys seem to like. This is a shorter chapter, just to get back into the swing of things.
Lucius nodded and pulled a list on parchment out of his robes. While Lucius and Borgin talked business, Draco wandered the shop. He saw a shriveled old hand, holding an unlit candle, and a beautiful sapphire necklace with a plaque that read;
Draco wasn't surprised by the lackluster response; he knew things would be tense after the incident in Diagon Alley. With a little more chatter, the boys crawled into bed for the night, and Draco put the lights out.
"Oh! Uh, hi Harry... My name's Collin." the boy said, shifting slightly on his feet. "I was wondering if I could maybe get a picture?"
Draco grinned up at Harry from where he was lounging on his bed as they walked in. Neville looked up from his book and smiled as they headed towards their own beds, Seamus and Dean just behind them.
Draco was stunned, to say the least, and looked through the papers to see that there were around 50 questions of the same caliber. With an internal groan, he began the quiz.
. He felt something drop in his stomach and moved on. As he stopped to examine a large, black cabinet in the corner. He was reaching for the handle when...
“Ah well let me show you” Gobhar said excitedly. “Mr Potter if you would step this way.” Harry took a couple of steps forwards until he was standing in front on the wiry little man. “Now, please take the Simularéé in your wand hand. Thank you. Ok, so to begin with the Simularéé will need a sample of your anatomy; a hair should do the trick. Just pluck one out and place it in the hatch at the top.” Harry pulled a hair from his head and placed in the whole in the top of the globe as Gobhar had indicated before closing the lid with a small ‘click’.
“Magic isn’t all terrible Mrs Granger” Harry said looking up at the small woman from his seat. “On the whole it’s actually really quite beautiful”.
“Bloody Paps, how we gonna find a way round them Mione? That ways a fuckin’ slaughter waiting to happen.” Ron glanced over at Hermione scribbling on a piece of parchment.
Harry took a second to digest this; Hermione obviously didn’t want her parents to know the intricacies of the war and that was her choice, but Harry now had to come up with something to say that would appease the Grangers curiosity yet not cross the line his friend wanted hidden. Not to mention Harry felt decidedly uncomfortable lying to these people he barely knew about the dangers their daughter had put herself through, mostly for his own sake, during the war. He decided to go for the bones of the truth and hope he was making the right decision.
Sighing he pushed the paper away. “Yes, all three actually. Not exactly the way I’d like to spend my August.”
He wasn’t the only person at the table. It had become a common sight to see many of the Burrows guests drag themselves to the kitchen early of a morning, all in search of strong caffeine and hot food. None of them ever asked about the dark circles under each other’s eyes or the slight shake of someone’s hand as they bought their first cup to their lips. They didn’t need to ask; after all they knew what answers they would receive.
Once the door closed behind Harry he walked over to a little alcove set back on the other side of the hallway. Sitting down in front of the fake window looking out on a non-existent garden, Harry cracked it open, allowing the enchanted breeze to roll over him.
Following the Directions on a large flashing sign Harry and Ron made their way to the Arrivals area, Hermione’s Flight should be disembarking now, which only gave them a few minutes to find the right door and meet her and her parents.
“I confiscated them off a fourth year, on the train home at the end of sixth year. I didn’t know what to do with them, so I left them here.” She said with a slightly bossy tone to her voice, although Harry couldn’t help noticing her cheeks had gone just a tiny bit pinker than usual and she was definitely not making eye contact with anyone.
She spoke of how she’d removed their memories; how she knew they’d never of left if they’d known what was happening. The only way to keep both them and herself safe had been for them to be somewhere far away where they couldn’t be used against her. She told them of Bill and Fleur’s wedding and their hiding in Grimmauld Place. Of how they’d discovered the locket was at the Ministry and how they’d broken in. How they had been discovered and spent the next months on the run. She glossed over how Ron had left them and although she mentioned going to Godric’s Hollow and what had happened there. She avoided telling her parents quite how close she and Harry had come to dying. She did tell them about Malfoy Manor, but opted to refer to her torture as “I was interrogated by Bellatrix Lestrange, one of Voldemort’s highest ranking Generals”. She told of their break into and subsequent escape from Gringotts. Finally she told them of the Battle of Hogwarts, of how she and Ron had destroyed Helga Hufflepuff’s cup and how the Diadem had been consumed by the fiendfyre. She told of Snapes death and bringing down Fenrir Greyback. Finally she spoke about seeing Harrys body lying, limp in Hagrid’s arm’s and how utterly helpless she had felt in that moment.
“Mr Potter may I demonstrate with you? It’s an honor by the way, truly an honor to meet you, to meet all of you of course. The three most famous people in the country! My wife is going to have a fit when she finds out what my assignment was today. I can’t thank you enough really I can’t, my wife’s Muggle born and we spent most of the last year on the run. You’d know all about that though I’m sure, we’ve all heard the stories, remarkable, truly remarkable!”
It was almost time for dinner and the Burrow was surly a hive activity by now, as Molly Weasley bossed and berated whom ever was available into helping her with whatever gastronomic meal she was preparing. As Harry turned on the spot, apperating back to the Burrow, he was quite convinced that this month couldn’t get any more stressful.
“It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that me and Hermione have become a thing. I mean the way she said hi at the ‘arrowport’ was pretty damn obvious wasn’t it.” Ron gave Mr and Mrs Granger a look that suggested they’d be daft not to have figured it out.
Hermione stared at him. After a second she nodded, her eyes never loosing his. Harry didn’t know if it was because he almost never bought his parents up in this way, or if it was simply that she trusted him. But he had to try.
“I’m sorry,” she said in a dead sounding voice. “I didn’t know they’d be that real, I wasn’t thinking” Hermione looked at Harry and Ron, her eyes begging them to forgive her.
“Your absolutely terrifying. I’ve told you that, right?” Ron replied fixing his girlfriend with a stare that was half fear half awe.
Noticing the new arrivals the two blatantly obvious Magicians turned and started walking straight for the small group who had just vacated the sleek black vehicle behind them.
“I’m up, sorry if I woke you” Harry said pushing himself up in the cot he’d been using, squeezed into the tiny floor space in Ron’s room.
Once inside the three friends and Mr Weasley, who was finishing work in half an hour anyway, flooed back to The Burrow just in time for Mrs Weasley’s dinner.
Harry still hadn’t told Ron and Hermione the extent of his abuse at the hands of the Dursleys and he didn’t think he ever would, but ever since Ron had found Harry locked in his room with bars on his windows just before the start of second year Ron had had suspicions about how deep their neglect of Harry really went. He never asked, but it was obvious whenever Harry’s biological family came up that he was harboring a lot of anger towards his best friends kin.
“THEN LEAVE” Mrs Granger’s screech came from nowhere, making Hermione recoil in horror. “If you don’t have the decency to treat us like human beings. If we don’t have the right to our own freedoms to choose what we can and cannot know about our own daughter. Leave and do not come back, because I for one don’t want a daughter who can’t find it within herself to respect us” Harry was horrified, gone was the quiet, sweet voiced women he had come to recognize as Hermione’s mother. The woman who stood shaking with rage before them spat cold poisonous words like a viper ready to attack. There was no doubting her.  She meant every word she said, there were no empty threats or cold manipulations going on here. She was completely, deadly serious.
However much Mrs Weasley under appreciated Ron’s choice of words, they did break the oppressive quiet that had briefly consumed the kitchen.
The rest of the car journey was completed in silence, Mr Granger looking stonily out of the window whilst Mrs Granger became inordinately interested in a small hole that had formed in the pocket of her cardigan. This left the three friends to eye each other with worried glances as they attempted to silently communicate feelings of comfort and companionship.
Once again Harry was filled with the anger he had felt outside Mr Weasley’s office at hearing those guards spewing bile at Malfoy’s imprisoned state. Harry had seen others come from the holding cells in rough and dishevelled conditions. Both he and Hermione had been in some rather heated arguments with Kingsley about it already. Still even those like Umbridge and Lucius had seemed less decimated and maltreated than Malfoy was. His entire demeanour was hunched over and broken.
A bright warm smile lit up behind Hermione’s eyes, as tears started falling down her face once more. “I’d like that Dad. Thank You”. She rushed forwards to give Mr Granger a tight hug before stepping back with a smile.
“Oh sorry, how silly of me!” Hermione said sounding rather strained all of a sudden. “Mum, Dad, You remember Ron and Harry don’t you?”
Dinner at the post-war Burrow was just as large and chaotic as it always had been, though now many of the meals had a quieter retrospective edge. As the Burrow had filled with more and more mouths to feed it had become increasingly clear that however much Mr and Mrs Weasley enjoyed having the company they were not able to afford to regularly feed up to twenty or more people. It had become a bit of a bone of contention to begin with, as none of the Weasleys would accept any money towards the food; this was until Luna arrived one day with two whole salmon and a large cake she had made. Mrs Weasley had been too polite to refuse the gifts and had cooked the fish up into one of the largest stargazy pies Harry had ever seen. Ever since that day when people came over they regularly bought an offering of food to add to the veritable feasts Mrs Weasley would prepare. The offerings were never expected but they were also never refused and Harry had often seen Mr Weasley’s thankful gaze fall on anyone who offered something towards the nights meal.
“Ok” Harry said. “Why don’t we start with what you know and work out from there?” he asked looking between the two older Grangers, hoping one of them would offer him a good place to start.
From within the pocket of his jodhpurs Gobhar pulled a large glass object that closely resembled the Remembrall Neville had used in first year, only with two large golden rings around the outside and a bright purple liquid held within.
The only real peace Harry got was in the brief frenzied games of Quidditch that happened most nights in the Burrows garden just before the sun went down. The games were never particularly well structured as they rarely had enough people to have a full fourteen-person game. Mostly they were merely chasers games of four on four at the most, or else just a mêlée, every person for themselves. The games had started as a distraction from the pressing silence that often arose in the later hours of the day when the housework was finished and peoples minds started to wonder down dark paths. Flying gave everyone a chance to put their feelings aside for a while, caught up in the adrenalin high of the wind in their hair and the turn of their stomachs as the ground dropped away. The games would often start around five-thirty and would continue until Mrs Weasley and whoever was helping her had finished cooking and dinner would start.
“Bill” Mrs Granger warned, laying a hand on her husbands arm and avoiding looking at the way her daughter blanched at her father’s jibe. “You’ve both grown a lot since we last saw you, although that has to be a couple of years now doesn’t it?” she said in a soft sweet sounding voice. Her eyes lingered a little longer on Ron than they had on Harry as she gave them a slightly nervous smile.
Mrs Tonks lived in the most muggle house Harry had ever seen a witch or wizard own. Pale Cream walls and French Blue curtains were certainly a better taste than the Dursley’s choices of Magnolia and Fuchsia, but apart from the moving pictures on the walls Harry thought even Aunt Petunia would of approved of the simple lines and elegant features.
“Well” said Hermione, peering into the bottom of the now empty bag. “I think that’s everything back where it should be.”
They continued in this manner for a couple of minutes, each taking a turn to perform a charm or transfigure something in the room into a pretty or often comical object.
“Here goes nothing,” Ron whispered to Harry through the corner of his mouth, trying and failing to hide his nerves at seeing Hermione again. Harry could understand Ron’s anxiety, whilst the two had left things in a very strong place before she left to find her parents, they hadn’t had much time to actually find their feet as a couple before they were separated again. This had left Ron fretting about how they would get on once they were back in the same hemisphere. These were not a set of fears Harry sheared; he had never seen two people he felt fitted each other more. Yes they pecked and quarreled, but they even seemed to do that together. Harry had secretly suspected that the two harbored more than a school kid crush for each other for a couple of years now and he was just glad that they had finally realized the depth of their feelings. Seeing the way the two had supported each other in the first days after the final battle had given Harry hope for the future, a hope he had sorely needed at the time and quite often still did.
“Bloody awfully if you ask me” Ron said a little too loudly making Harry drop the rubber duck Mr Weasley had on his desk. Clasping his hands together quickly to stop them shaking, Harry took a step back from the surface so as not risk breaking anything.
Before the Death Eaters had captured Dean and taken him to the manor he’d been on the run for nearly three months. Before leaving, Dean had placed all the protection he could around his family, in the hope that with him out of the way they would simply be overlooked. His precautions had been in vain.
“Yes he did” Dean nodded still looking into the fireplace. “And I think he believed everything he said growing up. But you saw him at the Manor, whatever notions Malfoy had about Voldemort’s rise to power, I think they were far from the reality he ended up with. I mean think about it Harry, we all grew up with people telling us what was good and what was bad and we believed them. Malfoy only did the same in the end. He believed his parents, what they said and what they taught. I doubt he even had a reason to question any of it until he actually met Voldemort himself. By then I don’t think Malfoy had a choice but to follow him, Voldemort would have killed his parents if he hadn’t done what was asked.” Dean glanced at the chessboard quickly taking one of Harry’s knights before looking away once again.
“Na Nev, the Ministry’s stopped using the kiss remember? Gunna be fazing the Dementors out completely by Christmas.” Ron replied.
Harry rolled over and got up; reaching to the top of the cupboard where he had left his jeans and rummaged through the open duffel bag he was keeping the rest of his clothes in to find a T-shirt. Pulling on an old, very faded red Quidditch jersey Harry headed down stairs.
“I can’t tell you,” Hermione said again, looking imploringly at her parents. “You wouldn’t understand.” Pushing Ron’s hand away she took a step towards them.
“I’ve been called as a character witness, although what help I’ll be I don’t know. I haven’t so much as spoken to her since I was eighteen.”
Finally about half an hour later Mrs Grangers rather pleasant sugar-plumb pink Simularéé came flying out the front door of the Grangers home and Gobhar pronounced the house safe to enter.
Four heads whipped round to face the Granger patriarch. Hermione and Mrs Granger wearing the exact same look of surprise, their eyebrows almost blending with their hairline.
Harry sheared Ron’s excitement for the morning’s activity, although he imagined for slightly different reasons. Hermione was finally returning home from Australia with her parents this morning. She had left for the far side of the world two weeks after the final battle to find them, and hopefully restore their memories. Harry and Ron had wanted to go with her, but she had insisted they stay with the Weasleys, reasoning that the family needed their support more than she did then.
Harry took a second to digest all this. So at least he wasn’t going mad. Malfoy didn’t deserve the brush he was being tarred with. He still deserved to pay for his crimes though… right? Knowing Malfoy had been forced into the decisions he’d made was tragic, but he’d still made them after all. He had done awful things, made stupid decisions, hurt people and changed lives for the worse. Harry shouldn’t care what was happening to him now; it wasn’t even Harry’s responsibility anyway. As Dean had said he’d done his bit.
“Mr Potter, My name is Auror Ramshorn. This is Auror Gobhar. We’ve completed all the preliminary sweeps of the residence and area. Everything seems to be in order, we’ve found nothing more than a decaying tracking charm, which we have since neutralized. All that is now left is to perform the presence specific tests and everything should be ready to go.” The tall pinstriped woman reeled off in a very business like manner as soon as she was in talking distance.
“You didn’t, its ok” Ron replied stretching; his bright red hair clashing so violently with the walls of his room that it was almost hard to look at. “I’m gonna go for a shower. Meet you downstairs before we head off?” he asked. Harry nodded, rubbing sleep from his eyes as Ron climbed over him to get out the door, heading for the bathroom.
Ginny and Seamus had taken to singing lines from it around the Burrow any time things started getting too serious, much to Harry’s chagrin.
Harry spent the meal lost in thought, unaware of the chaotic storm that was The Burrow at dinnertime, as it whipped around him. He didn’t even notice when Ron’s hair turned bright blue after he had a sip of pumpkin juice Ginny had laced with a Wizard Wheezes potion. Nor did he notice the subsequent fight that broke out right in front of him. In fact Harry Potter was so lost in his own thoughts he completely missed the announcement of an impromptu Quidditch game and only came round in time for Mrs Weasley to pull him into the Kitchen to help wash up.
“Your right” she sniffed, taking Ron’s hand in hers and sparing him a quick glance before turning her gaze back on her parents. You deserve to know what’s happened.”
Harry looked at Hermione in shock. Had she never explained about the Death Eaters obsession with blood purity or her role in the war?
Harry was still getting used to having so much money, whilst he had always known he had a lot more than the Weasleys, a thought that had always left him a little uncomfortable, he had never really comprehended quite how large the sum of money he had really was. Shortly after the Battle, Harry had gone with Hermione to Gringotts to work out what his finances were like. He had been astonished to discover that his parents account alone contained nearly Eighty-thousand Galleons. This on top of several other smaller Potter vaults he’d had no idea he’d inherited from distant relatives and the gigantic sum that was the Black family fortune that Sirius had left him meant that Harry had well over five-million Galleons to his name. What had come as a real shock however was when Hermione had turned to Harry as they were leaving Gringotts to say with a rather meek expression on her face, “Of course Harry one Galleon is worth roughly eighteen pounds. That means you have the equivalent of around ninety-million pounds, can you imagine what you could do with that”. The truth had been that Harry really couldn’t. He had completely panicked when he got back to the Burrow and hadn’t calmed down until Hermione had suggested he donate anonymously to the repair efforts. So he had given large amounts to Hogwarts and the ministry for the repairs.
Next Ron stood up and raising his wand produced several small blue birds that flew around his head twice before vanishing in little puffs of smoke. His eyes lingered on Hermione during the conjuring, a small smile playing at his lips. Next Harry stood quickly searching his mind for a spell that would show how wonderful magic could be.
Harry appeared on the street with the faintest of popping sounds; a year on the run really had honed his apperating skills.
“Ron’s right Harry, we would never of let you go and do the things we had to last year alone. It was our own choice and you need to stop taking the responsibility for it”. The last sentence Hermione directed right at her parents. It seemed that she wasn’t going to allow him to take responsibility for this either.
He was in Ron’s bedroom at the Burrow. The first rays of dawn’s light just starting to shine through the curtains setting the whole room ablaze, the weak light being transformed by the eye watering orange wallpaper.
“I’m sorry, I keep forgetting… Arthur” he said with a smile, opting not to tell him he’d gotten the two very different Muggle devices mixed up.
Hermione looked even more tired than she had before leaving just after the war. Two dark purple circles bruised the skin under her eyes and it looked like she had lost weight, which was nothing short of alarming considering the famished state the trio had been in by the final confrontation in May. Her hair was tied up in a messy bun on top of her head and she had a large blue Muggle style backpack on. Next to her walked the two older Grangers. Mr Granger was a tall rangy man with a balding head and that type of frameless glasses that Harry new he would break the second he bought a pair. He was wearing knee length tan shorts and a faded check shirt, he always gave the impression he was the kind of man to go bird watching on Sunday afternoons. Mrs Granger was a small shy looking woman, she sheared Hermione’s dark eyes and bushy mane of brown hair though she kept hers cut much shorter than her daughter’s. Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen her not wearing at least one cardigan, normally the over sized kind with a large shall collar and big patch pockets. She was the kind of person you felt needed to be protected, a trait that stood in strong contrast to her daughters self-assured manner. All three Grangers bore the same strained expression on their faces as they entered the main expanse of the airport through the arrivals board; it was a look that did not bode well for the rest of the morning’s interactions.
“Those were my memories,” she explained. “They were all the memories I have of seeing dark or dangerous magic, that’s what I was trying to protect you from.” Hermione looked at her Mum with such a look of pleading it made Harry want to sob.
Harry stared at her for a moment more than a little impressed that she could find it in herself to still wish her sister well after all this time.
“I’ve sent us to The Muggle Liaison floor, we’ll have to ask Kingsley to connect your dad’s office to the floo network temporarily.” Hermione finished writing her note, folded it into a delicate origami bird and tapped it with her wand. The bird lifted both its tiny wings and flue up into the air and straight out of the lift doors as they opened onto Ministry corridor.
None of the estate’s residence would expect that behind the hawthorn hedge and lace curtains lived the last full blooded descendent of one of the oldest and most powerful pureblood houses in the world. They would be even more dismayed to learn that with her lived the infant child of a werewolf and a woman who could change her appearance at will. The strangest of things it seemed, were often found in the most likely places.
“And that is?” Harry probed. He knew it was presumptuous of him to ask but he needed to know if he was alone in wanting to give a Malfoy a second chance or if he was just finally going off his rocker.
After a minutes silence, in which the two friends took turns moving their respective pieces, Dean turned to Harry “You alright Harry? You’ve seemed a bit off all night.”
“So what happens now?” Mr Granger asked the group at large. “Hermione said something about needing to take some protective measures on the way home? I hope those radicals we were told about are gone?”
“Yeah” Harry said with a smile “They can fit over four-hundred people in the big ones. The Dursley’s went on one when they had a holiday to Spain. I was about nine I think”. He didn’t mention that the Dursley’s had actually left him with Mrs Figg for those two weeks and the only reason he knew the fact at all was because Dudley had rubbed it in his face for a whole four weeks after they came back. From the frown Ron gave him he doubted he had missed the insinuation.
“Ronald please” Mr Weasley said sharply before turning to Harry with a small frown. “ He’s right Harry, you are looking a little under the weather. Can I get you anything?”
Typical Dean, Harry thought, the guy had just lost his whole family, spent half a year on the run and been imprisoned in Voldemort’s base of operations, yet he still found it in him to notice when others were struggling with something.
Three days after Hermione had arrived home, Harry was sitting at the Weasley’s kitchen table. A large, sweet mug of tea in front of him and the promising scent of fried sausages wafting over from the arga, where Mrs Weasley stood making breakfast.
AHHHH I know I'm sorry it was too good to not do. I will put the next one up as soon as I can. Please stay safe in this time of total madness. love P&U
“Shame about it really the whole family should be sucked dry if you ask me, there aren’t even any Dementors in Azkaban anymore, it’ll practically be a holiday, fucking Death Eater scum.”
At that moment Percy Weasley called for order.  As the room quietened down Kingsley Shacklebolt organised his papers and rose to his feet, drawing the attention the court with his presence.
is quite frankly a breath of fresh air for most people.” he looked rather serious all of a sudden. “Now I’m off to work, I have a few things I need to get done before the Minister arrives. Coming Dad?” Percy got up and started hunting for his cloak whilst Mr Weasley filed his papers into a rather battered brown leather briefcase.
“It is. It’s not very accurate I’m afraid, but wizards don’t tend to make children’s books about creatures they mostly consider to be highly dangerous.” Andromeda said with a mock sigh.
“You mean I have to tell these people if I think the accused is guilty or not?” Harry asked, more than a little alarmed that he may have to be responsible for other people’s fates, even if they were criminals.
Over the intervening weeks since the end of the war Dean had started to communicate more and he’d even started taking part in the regular Quidditch matches that took place, but he was quieter than he’d ever been. He rarely stayed in a room that held more than a few people, but was equally anxious when left alone. The first few times Seamus had tried to leave him, even simply to go to the toilet, Dean would have a complete melt down.
“Harry mate! Wake up, your having another nightmare” Ron said with a worried expression as he looked down his long nose at Harry, his hands still holding Harry down.
“Of course Dad” Hermione replied running up to give her parents a final hug. They made their good byes and headed towards the front door.
“You could of given a guy some warning Mione” Ron said from the kitchen door way. “I love you, but I didn’t need to see that again”.
“You’re going to Narcissa’s trial?” Harry asked a little shocked that she would even want to see her sister after all that had happened between them.
“Alright” Gobhar said bringing Harry out of his thoughts with a start “Now when I say, I need you to tell the Simularéé your full name. Please speak clearly and don’t use any abbreviations or nick names or else this won’t work.”
“I’m not sure I entirely agree with you Luna” Hermione cut in, obviously seeing Ron’s hackles starting to rise. “But I do agree he should be tried for the majority of his crimes as a child as most of them were committed whilst under age.”
It took Harry a moment to figure out what Hermione had done. But as the large French Doors started to shimmer and swirl he realised with horror that Hermione was somehow using the glass as a form of flat-screen Pensieve.
Mr and Mrs Granger stared at the spot they had vanished, their eyes gleaming brightly in the July sunlight. “I…” Mrs Granger started “I’ve never seen anything quite as beautiful… Yes, well.”
“But Hermione, you have to understand that what you did was naïve, reckless and quite frankly stupid. You put yourself in dangerous and impossible situations, apparently risking your life and those of your friends. You blindly jumped into situations without any real knowledge of what you were doing or the consequences of your actions. A war is no place for a seventeen year old girl!” Mr Granger had started shouting now. “That is not to mention how you ripped your very existence from our heads! Your mother hasn’t slept a wink since you so graciously returned our memories. How dare you violate our minds, without even considering what we would want!”
As if to demonstrate this exact point Percy smirked, humour lighting up behind his eyes “Your in the news again this morning, its quite heroic” he said as he raised an eyebrow at Harry.
“You still have no idea do you!” Hermione laughed in her father’s astonished face. “You think you could have protected me? You think you could have protected me from people who hold more power in the palm of their hand than the atom bomb? You don’t even know what real magic can do! The most you’ve ever seen are the few parlor tricks I did in my first week home before I wiped your memories!”
“No I’m er… ok, I… I’m just going to get some air. Give me a minuet” Harry said, quickly turning on his heels and making his way back out of the office.
Harry was suddenly furious; he hadn’t fought a war against a madman only for people to still be treated like cattle, that was what HE had done.
Ginny and Neville both started sniggering, Mrs Weasley was not similarly impressed, giving Ron a swot around the ear.
“Well whatever he says, Lucius isn’t going to be getting out of jail this time” Ginny said looking angry. “Not after serving as Voldemort’s personal house keeper and dungeon master for the last year” She protectively put her arm around Luna’s shoulder at this.
“You might be right Ron, but I don’t think he thought He Who Must Not Be Named was as amazing as he’d expected after actually meeting him. Besides many people are bullies in school, that doesn’t mean they deserve to be imprisoned for acts they did out of fear, or to protect themselves.”
The doors shut on the lift before the cramped mettle box zoomed off backwards and up towards the Ministry atrium.
As the five figures watched on in amazement images started flashing in front of their eyes. Slowly at first but gradually gaining speed until they only had enough time for the image to sink in before they were moving onto the next.
“The Court thanks the Prosecution for its address and calls the Defence to make it’s stand” Kingsley said.
Harry looked around in confusion for a second totally at a loss as to what Ron could be on about. But then he saw it and he had to stifle a laugh at how obvious it was, of course Ron had thought that the clunky padded headwear a good sized portion of the younger Muggle travelers were wearing were earmuffs. “Those are head-phones Ron, they plug into a Walkman, a kind of mechanical box you can play music on whilst you travel. Muggles use them for entertainment”.
“Andy is fine dear. Please, I don’t like to repeat myself.” Andromeda said with a smile, reminding him of her request from their last meeting. She gently patted his cheek as she made her way around the Kitchen island with the kettle, filling it with water before placing it on the hob.
The boy who was escorted into the courtroom was so changed from that of the Draco Malfoy Harry had gone to school with that he seemed more likely to have been another person altogether. Malfoy’s skin had a waxy yellow tinge to it and was pulled tight across his bones. His eyes were sunken pits of coal, dark and glassy. He was so thin his cheek and wrist bones seemed to poke through his skin and his obviously small-sized prison robe hung loosely on his shoulders. The most shocking transformation in the once good-looking boy however was his hair, or rather lack thereof. Someone during his incarceration had shaved off Malfoy’s trademark platinum locks. It was obvious that it had been done roughly and with little consideration to his safety. There were a few patches that had been missed altogether where several fine hairs stuck out at odd angles and few scabs were healing over from where the shaving charm had caught the scalp. Moreover Malfoy had four purple marks on one side of his neck and cuts to his lip and on his cheek. It seemed to Harry more like an Inferi had been bought in for questioning than the once proud Slytherin.
When Harry got down stairs the first thing he saw was Seamus and Dean curled up on the sofa fast asleep, a game of chess lay abandoned on the mosaic topped coffee table before them. Blacks were winning, which probably meant they were Seamus’, he was the only person who would still play Ron even if he never did actually win. They were slumped over each other, Seamus’ head resting comfortably on his best friends shoulder. The pair had become entirely inseparable since the end of the war, Seamus had confessed to Harry one rather drunken night a few weeks ago that the time Dean had spent on the run had been some of the Irishman’s most terrifying months. “I didn’t even know where he was yeh know? If he was even alive, I had no way to help him. We kept hearing about the people they found, what the snatchers would do to them and all I could think was, is Dean one of them?” he had slurred to Harry in an intoxicated whisper. It was Seamus who had gone with Dean to see his family straight after the battle only to find a burnt out shell, his entire family still inside. Dean’s eyes often became vacant as he got lost in his own grief and Seamus was often seen talking to him quietly in a corner or else taking him away for long walks in the Devonshire countryside.
The silence stretched on as each person around the room started to comprehend what the Ministry was asking of them.
“I think Ron has quite the turn of phrase actually Mrs Weasley… I can introduce you to a poetic publisher if you’d like Ron, I’m sure he’d be very interested.” Luna remarked, offering him a small smile.
It had been nearly two months since the battle, two months since the war had ended and Harry had defeated Voldemort. There had been funerals, so many funerals and Harry had gone to them all. He had spoken at many, asked by family members who thought he would know what to say. People always came up and thanked him for coming, thanked him for everything he’d done. Harry knew they meant well but he couldn’t shake the feeling that he could of done more, if only he’d been a little stronger, a little faster, if he’d just put all the pieces together just a little quicker he could of stopped them from suffering at all.
Since Seamus was in Ireland visiting his family for a few days, Harry and Ron had stayed up with Dean. It hadn’t been openly discussed, but no one was quite willing to leave the dark skinned, West Ham supporter alone just yet.
“She is still my sister Harry. She made the wrong choices; she holds awful beliefs and no doubt has done some dreadful things. But if your asking me if I want her to go to Azkaban? No I can’t find it in myself to want that… I’ve lost too much family to this war already. I won’t loose any more, even if that family wants nothing to do with me.”
“Still a fucking hell whole though isn’t it,” the guard grinned. “That little rat will go mad in a week, he’ll be a gibbering wreck before he turns nineteen.”
those terrifying metal contraptions Muggle women use to remove unwanted hair? The things Muggles come up with! Why on earth anyone would want to walk around bald all day just for fashion I will never know. And we’ve told you before Harry, please call us Molly and Arthur, all this Mr and Mrs business really does seem far too formal after all” he said all this with a firm smile that made Harry feel both incredibly awkward and rather pleased. Even after so long he still found it hard to believe that the Weasley’s really did think of him as family and wanted him around.
Hey so I decided this chapter is going to be huge so I've split it up. This is part one Part two will be up when I've actually finished it. The second half is still looking to be quite big but I thought here was a good place to break it.
“If you’d only warned us!” Mr Granger shouted back, his face looked almost panicked now, it was quite obvious he’d never seen his daughter quite this angry. If Harry was honest neither had he.
At that moment Ron came in through the living room door, maroon Weasley jumper clashing spectacularly with his red hair, which was dripping slightly from the shower.
“Yeah, one sec” Harry said downing the rest of his tea, and immediately regretting it as he scolded the roof of his mouth.
. You say that it was dangerous and quite frankly that is obvious from the multitude of scars I can count on all three of you from here. I would like to know why three teenagers took it upon themselves to rid the country of this
As Andromeda took Teddy out of Harry’s hands an enchanted baby bottle filled itself with formula and floated itself over to the pair. When it got close Teddy started waving at it, desperately trying to make a grab for it.
Harry realized rather quickly that this was not going to be an easy journey. He took a breath, bracing himself for a long interrogation before he opened his mouth.
Anyway now I'm stuck in my house because of the international plague so I finally have both the time, health and inspiration to get back to it. Hope you enjoy, if you like it please click a like it makes me very excited and then makes my lazy arse motivated.
“Oh the usual you know, mostly eating and sleeping. We started a new book this week, didn’t we Teddy?” Andromeda said picking up a large purple book with a picture of a dragon on the front and wiggling it in front of Teddy’s face.
“Stand back everyone, I don’t know where everything will go.” Hermione said giving everyone a chance to back off from the bag. Pulling out her wand Hermione pointed it at the rucksack in the centre of the room she muttered a quiet
“Believe me I know” Harry grumpily moved his queen out of the way of Deans oncoming rook. “Malfoy picked the wrong side and needs to pay for what’s happened. He hurt people, almost killed Ron, then there’s the night on the astronomy tower. He was a prat all through school and then went and joined a bloody death cult, I shouldn’t even care what happens to him.” Harry sighed, running his hands over his face in frustration. “But the way those guards were talking about him… no one should be treated like that, it’s not what we fought for!” Harry realised that he’d stood up at some point. He quickly sat down, trying not to wake Ron in the process.
“No your right Ron. But the Death Eaters families could start claiming imprisonment compensation. Which would hold up court proceedings even further. Not to mention that the Ministry can’t afford to be paying out claims for every one arrested since the war.”
Not only was the conversation Harry had just heard vile on any moral level, but Harry wasn’t sure it even had a basis in truth. Sure there were people out there who deserved nothing but derision and contempt. People like Greyback or Bellatrix, hell even Lucius, but Malfoy wasn’t even close to that level of evil. Sure he’d done his fair share of damage. After all the idiot had almost killed Ron, but mostly Malfoy had been nothing more than a pawn, and a weak one at that. He wasn’t twisted and he certainly wasn’t a killer, Harry had seen that on the astronomy tower.
“Harry” Hermione called, peeking through Mr Weasley’s office door. “The floo’s been connected, come on before Molly starts serving dinner.”
“Right yes, sorry, I do let my mouth run away with me at times, my wife’s constantly telling me to think before I open it, but there you have it” Harry couldn’t quite believe anyone could actually talk that fast, he was having trouble keeping up with what the man was saying.
As Harry approached the front door it was flung wide to reveal a tired but smiling Andromeda Tonks. Alerted by the wards. She had obviously just come straight from the kitchen as she was still wearing a flour-covered apron.
“I hate that you went through all of that Hermione. I hate that I couldn’t protect you, and I hate that you thought your only course of action was to change our memories. Even if it was.”
Hermione looked at him with that slightly exasperated look of hers, like he hadn’t read the books for a piece of homework.
Harry went over to the large kettle that sat on the arger and started making himself a cup of very strong, very sweet tea. Even after six years of knowing him Mrs Weasley still tutted quietly under her breath every time she watched him heap the five, mounded teaspoons of sugar into his cup. He couldn’t help it he just loved the way that no matter how much stirring you did you were still left with a deliciously syrupy sweet liquid at the bottom of the mug that you almost had to spoon out. Harry was beginning to think he was drinking almost as much tea these days as he was alcohol and since the war that was quite frankly impressive.
Finally, Harry produced his giant stag patronus, it galloped around the room once before it was joined by Ron’s Terrier and Hermione’s Otter. The room filled with an overpowering sense of joy as the three glimmering specters played with each other, their very presence acting as a magnifying glass for all the positive emotions that made them. The Patronas’ faded slowly, leaving ghostly after images burnt into Harry’s retina.
Neville snoozed across from him, his head drooping close to the mouth of his mug. Ginny, and Luna sat next to him, both shearing that day’s Quibbler. Ginny gave Neville a poke, making him to jolt awake with a start, nearly spilling his tea. Hermione was curled up on the faded old armchair that sat in the corner. Her nose berried in a book on thermal conditioning charms, Crookshanks in her lap, purring softly. Ron was on Harry’s left his feet on the table as he scanned yesterday’s Prophet for the Quidditch scores.
The song Ode To Potter is real its by the Switchblade Kittens and you should definitely look it up... its a blast.
“Our daughter didn’t tell us she had a large part in it all, only that it wasn’t safe and that they were hunting people like her. People with magic born to those without any like us.” Mr Granger said stiffly not looking at Hermione as he said this.
There was a quite ‘bing’ and a cool voice announced “Ministry Atrium. Exit here for floo network, canteen, wand assessment centre and greater London.
“And what would you want me to do Dad?” Hermione shouted, standing up from the sofa. Her body almost vibrating with suppressed rage.
It had been a tense time for Hermione as it had taken several weeks to locate her parents, even with the help of the Australian Bureau of Magical Policies. Not only that but extended memory charms were considered highly dangerous as they could become difficult to reverse, especially if the person whose memory had been altered was reticent to regain the knowledge that had been taken. After weeks of hunting and almost a month of work carefully restoring the Grangers memories, they had finally closed their small sweet shop in Sydney and were ready to move back to the UK and resume their old lives. Hermione had written to Harry and Ron a few days ago asking if they could meet her and her parents at the airport. Mr and Mrs Granger had apparently not been thrilled that their daughter had written herself out of their lives without their consent and there had been a strain in the family’s relationship because of it. Hermione wanted Ron and Harry to be there to help her explain to her parents exactly why she had felt she had to do it; she thought they might be able to hear it better if it came from someone other than herself.
Standing outside the arrivals door waiting for Hermione, Ron looked around with a small frown creasing his forehead. “Harry?” he asked, staring openly at a teenage girl only a year or two younger than the two boys. “Harry? Why are half the Muggle kids wearing earmuffs? It’s the middle of summer!”
“Prosecution if you would make clear your opening statements?” Kingsley said to the tall man with a black widows peak and a nose so hooked it could of rivalled Snape’s.
He was pulled from his thoughts by a great clattering and banging as a whole parliament of owls flew in through the kitchen window. Suddenly there were feathers flying, birds hooting and several people crying out in shock.
The two friends made their way out of the front door and down the crooked garden path made of large, knobbly stone slabs with grass and dandelions poking out between them. Through the wooden gate with it’s peeling pale blue paint, until they were standing just outside the Weasley homes wards. They took one look at each other before turning sharply on the spot, disapparating.
Hi, so sorry it's been ages since I updated. please don't hate me. Also I've actually uploaded this chapter once but then I decided I hated it so I took it down and had writers block for far too long.
“I think it’ll be a lot worse for her than that Ron. Greyback won’t move cell for the full moon after all.” A rather scary gleam had appeared in Hermione’s eyes at this.
“Good morning Harry, did you sleep well?” Mr Weasley asked looking up from a pile of paper work with a tired smile. Mr Weasley had been given quite a serious promotion after the war; he was now head of the Muggle Liaison Office and was responsible for repairing all the damage the Muggle community had un-knowingly suffered at the hands of Voldemort and the Death Eaters.
Turning his giant brown eyes onto Harry, Teddy gurgled and spat little bubbles at him as he grabbed at his fingers. As Teddy looked up at Harry, his eyes lightened shifting from the dark brown that resembled his grandmothers to that of Harry’s own bottle green. There was a moment though, as the young Lupin’s eyes lightened from chocolate to emerald that pinned Harry to the spot. For the briefest of instants Remus Lupin’s soft hazel gaze was staring up at him, seeming to see too much and question everything. The next second he was gone and Teddy was grinning wonkily up with that special love that only infants really have. Harry took a shaky breath still astounded that a child who looked different every twenty seconds could, so often, look so much like his dead parents.
Harry mouthed a silent “I’m sorry” too her as the Grangers looked out of the window. “Its ok” she mouthed back just as quietly and Harry knew she didn’t blame him.
Harry and Ron gave Hermione a slightly shocked look at the idea that she would be hiding any skiving snack boxes in her bedroom.
“Harry mate, you all right?” Ron asked. “Take a deep breath, in… and… out… that’s it.” Ron held Harry’s shoulders firmly calmly looking into Harry’s eyes. This was by no means the first time Ron had helped Harry through a panic attack. Attacks like Harry’s had become a common occurrence at The Burrow in the past few months and the occupants of the Weasley family home were all used to helping one another through them.
“Yes, you were scared that your mother and I would of taken you away from your friends if we’d learnt of the political climate in your world and you thought if we did that you wouldn’t of been able to protect yourself from these criminals” Mr Granger said sounding very sure of himself now.
The small woman looked directly at her daughter “Hermione, you truly are so amazing. I don’t know where this gift came from, but I am so glad you received it.”
Harry was by far not the only volunteer helping to straighten out the mistakes of that sadistic regime, but he was attempting to use the sway he had gained in the wizarding world to make sure the corruption that had wormed into the ministry in the years before the war was ripped out and wouldn’t find a foot hold again. He’d had several long discussions with Kingsley, who had just been named the official Minister for Magic, about how the Ministry’s downfall had only hastened and enhanced the suffering that had occurred. How more measures should be put into place to stop those in power abusing their influence for their own gain rather than the gain of the government and the country.
Mr Weasley… Arthur, Harry corrected himself, beamed at him across the table before looking back down at his pile of papers a frown instantly crossing his face as he started reading again.
“Looked after me!” Hermione screeched. “Looked after me! I was the one looking after you!” at this Hermione whipped out her wand, pointing it directly at her own head before pulling it away and throwing what looked like a silver liquid at the glass conservatory doors.
“Yes?” Hermione said, whipping round to look at her farther. If it weren’t for how her hands shook before she clenched them into fists Harry would have had a hard time seeing just how scared Hermione really was.
The only room that remained off limits by unspoken consent was that of Fred and George. Even now, George rarely made his way out of his room. Mrs Weasley had finally forced him out two weeks ago, insisting that he eat with everyone else “It’s not healthy for him to be stuck in that room all day, he needs more than old photographs for company” she had said. So now he ate dinner with them, it hadn’t helped much though; he was still unnaturally quiet, and his eyes were little more than sunken holes in his face. The only people to ever venture into his room were, Angelina Johnson, Lee Jordan and Charlie, who had decided not to go back to Romania just yet.
“You found her again didn’t you?” he said, his face still utterly devoid of expression. “You went back and fought through all those horrible things?”
Becoming a Godfather was a daunting prospect for Harry. He knew next to nothing about children and knew even less about how to help them through life. He was barely eighteen for Circe’s sake. Still he was determined to be there for Teddy in any way he could.
“So you are right there was a radical group called the Death Eaters, they were lead by a very powerful Dark Wizard named Lord Voldemort. Their mission statement was to wipe out anyone with magic who wasn’t born with at least one magical family member. Not only that, they considered themselves superior to all other life on the planet whether that was magical or not. I believe they would’ve continued fighting until they ruled the world and quite probably until they were the only ones left. They considered anything that didn’t have magic to be filthy and worthy of destruction. The war started in an attempt to stop them, but mostly it was just a fight to survive.”
“That’s the gist of it yes, it’s supposed to help the bench make their decision. I still think we should be taking more from the Muggle system. Not having a randomly selected jury strikes me as a tad elitist, but I’ve yet to convince Kingsley.” Hermione sighed.
There was silence for a long time after Hermione had finished her story. Ron was holding Hermione’s hand so hard his fingers had turned white. Harry on the other hand felt surprisingly numb. He’d never heard it all laid out like that before, it sounded like some giant epic fantasy story. Full of Heroes and Villains hell there was even a Dragon. Only it wasn’t a story, it was Harry’s life and it hadn’t been exciting or thrilling like a fantasy should be, it had been scary and bloody and horrible. It was funny thought Harry, when you listened to a story full of adventure and fighting, it could sound all amazing and exciting in your head. But if you ever tried to live that life you’d soon discover it was anything but.
“Malfoy!” He hears Potter’s voice, and it sounds like he’s drunk. He is drunk. He comes stumbling into the kitchen, spotting Malfoy at the table, and then he’s grinning, a foolish, dazzling smile.
“Do you have to throw my clothes in different directions every time, Potter?” He complains, and Potter throws him a million-watt smile that makes his knees go weak.
It’s Sunday night, and Draco is sitting in the kitchen, looking over some papers for work. Work as a Healer isn’t only practical, there’s paperwork. Luckily, paperwork is easy to take home, a perfect distraction from his unfortunate situation with Potter.
When they're finished, sweaty, panting, and happy, an owl flies in through the window. It drops its letter on Harry’s head and flies off again.
“Tell me what? That he loves me? You’re seriously misinformed if you think Potter’s in love with me.” It just doesn’t make sense. Why had Potter said he’d used Draco if he loves him?
“You’re leaving me for some prat at work. Why wouldn’t I drink?” Potter mutters, slurring his words a bit. The warm feeling that settles in the pit of Draco’s stomach is all kinds of wrong, but he can’t help it. Potter has gotten drunk due to being upset because he thinks Draco had gone on a date. He decides it’s the best lie he’s ever told, maybe excluding the one at the Manor, when he’d lied that he didn’t know if it was Potter or not. Excluding that lie, this was absolutely his best lie ever.
“Merlin’s rotten balls!” Potter curses under his breath, and Draco can’t help but laugh. At Potter’s angry and embarrassed glare, he stops laughing.
Friday evening Draco finds himself out drinking with his two best (only) friends; Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini. If Potter isn’t going to fuck him, he might as well fuck himself over with too much alcohol. But he isn’t precisely getting drunk, not yet anyway. Blaise and Pansy can see he’s down and if he gets too drunk they will weed out of him what it is about and he doesn’t want them to know that he has fallen head over fucking heels in love with Potter of all people. He suspects they already know, but he doesn’t want to confirm anything. They are Slytherins after all, and there’s no telling what they might do; how they might hold it against him.
“Well, yeah. I might have been projecting my fears quite a bit now that I think back on our conversation. But you said Granger told you that you were using me, and I assumed that you were using me for sex, despite knowing about my
“Fuck you, Potter” Draco mumbles, even though he knows Potter is right. He’ll always come back to get fucked into the mattress by the Boy-who-lived, as long as said man will have him.
“You weren’t supposed to find out, not like that anyway,” Potter mumbles, refusing to look Draco in the eye.
“Mhnm..” Potter grunts and then throws his arm back around Draco, tugging him impossibly close, closer than is good for Draco’s heart. “Stay” he murmurs into Draco’s ear, his hot breath sending tremors down Draco’s spine. It’s tempting. Very tempting. Too tempting. He needs to get the fuck out.
“What? That doesn’t make any sense, Malfoy. You said I was humiliating you. You said that being with me was mortifying.”
“Malfoy” Potter flashes his million-watt smile as soon as he lays his gorgeous green eyes on the blonde.
“I… might have developed feelings for Potter.” He admits, swirling the drink in his glass, an awful bourbon, but the taste doesn’t genuinely matter when you’re out to get drunk.
“What did you mean by that anyway? That you were using me.” Draco asks because he still can’t fathom what else Harry could have meant. But if Harry was, is, in love with Draco, then he wouldn’t have been using Draco at all.
“But you’ve still liked him for quite some time, so what’s the problem? I thought you were screwing Potter anyway, as disgusting as that is.” Pansy prods.
When Draco wakes up, Potter’s arm is slung around him and his chest is pressed up against Draco’s back. He feels content for a second before he remembers that this is Potter. He’s in Potter’s bed once again, in Potter’s apartment. When they started fucking, almost three years ago, they made rules. One of those rules was that the one who came over to the other’s place was to leave afterwards. No need to sleep in the same bed after the deed was done.
“Good evening to you too, Potter. No, you cannot fuck me.” Draco sighs, and puts down his parchment.
“Screw you, Potter. I’m leaving.” He buttons his trousers and stomps out of Potter’s room and to the fireplace. Before he calls out the address of his own apartment, while throwing the floo powder into the fireplace, he hears Potter calls after him.
“You told Granger and Weasley?” It isn’t truly a question. “Who else have you told?” The words leave Draco’s lips in a rush, forced out against his will for Potter to see, for Potter to laugh at. How Draco is so fucking desperate to keep his deplorable feelings hidden, how Potter can hurt him by spreading it around, how he can humiliate him.
“Wait, hold up Granger.” Draco holds up a hand to stop her ranting as he mulls over the one sentence that she had uttered that makes no sense whatsoever to him. ‘I understand if you don’t love him back’. But it’s the other way around, Potter doesn’t love
“I don’t know what you possibly could have to talk to me about” he tries to step around her to continue his work, but she grabs a hold of his collar and pulls him down until his face is dangerously close to hers.
“I met up with Ron and Hermione yesterday, you know.” Potter begins and Draco wonders where the fuck this is going. Whatever Potter wants to talk about, Draco could never have imagined that it would begin like this.
Draco turns as he’s buttoning his shirt, scanning for his trousers. Potter is laying on his side, resting his head in his palm, his elbow holding him up. His hair is a mess, but when isn’t it? It stands up in the back, and Draco knows he made it that way when he pulled on fistfuls of hair as Potter pounded into him last night. The memory makes Draco pause, his brain focusing on the way Potter felt against him and the feeling of Potter’s stupid hair between his fingers. When he re-emerges from the memory, he meets Potter's expectant gaze and realizes that Potter asked him a question.
“Oh, how you infuriate me, Malfoy. You’re a despicable excuse of a human being.” Now, Draco doesn’t think he’s warranted that kind of description, and especially not from one of Potter’s friends.
“No, I didn’t mean- I meant sleep as in sleep, Malfoy. Let me sleep with you, please.” This is not a good idea. He and Potter are strictly just sex, nothing else. Draco can’t afford to let Potter come that close to him in any other way. His heart won’t be able to take it.
“Yeah, well. Hermione said it wasn’t fair on you. She said I’m using you, and I guess I kind of am, even though I didn’t mean for it to happen.” Draco feels a sudden cold run through his veins. Potter talked to Granger (and Weasley too, probably) about Draco. He told them about his feelings for Potter, took their advice. It makes Draco suddenly furious and humiliated. Potter has no right to tell anyone! Did he laugh with his friends about how pathetic Draco is to have fallen for him?
“I have plans, Potter.” He lies and throws Potters arm off him, not too gently. His bare feet touch the cold wooden floor and he shivers.
“Well, it gives me the pleasure of watching you go around half-naked collecting it.” He laughs, and Draco blushes, curse his pale skin.
Saturday evening, Draco is still panicking. He doesn’t want to confront Potter, because what if he’s gotten it all wrong and Potter has no clue about Draco’s pathetic feelings. So, Draco can’t exactly confront Potter and risk spilling feelings that Potter has no clue about. Draco’s pacing in his living room when the floo network swooshes to life. He has only a split second to compose himself before Potter himself stumbles out of the fireplace. He is sober this time, thank Merlin, but he seems apprehensive, hesitant.
“Fine” he can feel Potter retract into himself. Maybe it was the wrong decision after all, but no, he can’t afford anything else. Potter might be okay slipping into the friendly area, but to Draco that would just mean more futile hopes to push down.
“Malfoy?” Potter breathes. He’s right out of the shower, his mess of black hair plastered to his face, almost entirely covering his scar, and water is dripping down his toned chest and disappearing into the towel he has around his waist. Draco shakes his head; he’s not here to get fucked, he’s here to talk.
“She did? I’m so sorry, Malfoy. I didn’t kno-“ Potter begins to apologize, but Draco interrupts him.
Draco waits in the living room, draped over the couch, trying to figure out where to start. Then Potter’s coming down the stairs, dressed in jeans and a green t-shirt that shows off his collar bones. Draco wonders if the colour choice was deliberate but then he focuses back on the matter at hand. Potter settles down in the armchair opposite Draco, and Draco doesn’t know if he’s trying to keep his distance.
He steps out of the fireplace and into Potter´s living room. He’s been here many times before over the past three years, but it feels different this time. It’s quiet. Draco’s heart is beating in his ears as he scans the room and then heads for the stairs. Maybe Granger is right and Potter’s lying in bed, Draco thinks and then he runs right into a wet, naked chest. He knows it’s Potter before he can lift his gaze to meet his stunned gaze.
