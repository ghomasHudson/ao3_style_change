Sniffling slightly, the boy spoke, "I suppose you must be all right if you're sarcastic." Tears threatened again. "We—I though you were dead. I thought you would die."
"Time," Harry repeated. "Time for what?"
The bleached blond cut Alex off with a fierce kiss. Even in his pained and exhausted condition, Harry could feel a hot blush rising in his cheeks when, instead of stopping him, Alex dropped the glass to shatter on the floor and pulled him closer.
She looked up at him with a wicked light in her eyes and said, "Very luxurious, Sev."
Beyond it Severus heard people, and a lot of them. A dull beat seemed to throb in the floor underneath him, and he looked at the vampire suspiciously.
"Open your eyes," Harry said gently
"Why so sad, Ferret? Missing your Master?"
Pushing Harry's helping hands away, Draco stood, but just as quickly fell as magical drain and the pain from his broken ribs and Chris's death washed over him and he was enveloped in darkness. He thought he felt something brush against his cheek as he slipped into unconsciousness.
"Spike?"
The only cloud on their love was their lack of a child. Narcissa wanted greatly to give her husband a son, an heir, but their wizard Snape had warned her that carrying a child could kill her.
Harry didn't want to laugh, he really didn't. But when he heard Snape sniggering into his glass, he couldn't stop himself, and as the older man began to choke and cough on the powerful alcoholic fumes, even Draco had to join in.
Spike had been quiet, spending a lot of time closeted with Chris, talking more solemnly than anyone else had seen him before. Draco had always insisted that the vampire was more than capable of serious thought and strategic planning, but this was the first time any of the girls had seen it.
Occasionally Harry would sigh and Severus tried to ignore it, but the low soughing sound began to grate on his nerves and finally he broke.
"Felt what- how badly hurt were you-  Alex hasn't said anything."
Paige took Draco's place sitting next to the bed. It took a few minutes to get used to the low, squishy chair, more a padded stool than anything, but when she was comfortable she settled in for some quality Sev-watching.
"And you," Paige said, now looking at Chris, "is he a bad dangerous guy?"
"I am sorry, Draco. I should not have told you that way. You are too innocent for such things."
Then a hollow bang sounded at Severus' door. Draco went into the bedroom so no one would see him, and Severus made his way to the door. On the other side was a frantic Ginny Weasley, tears streaking down his face.
The bleached blond snorted at the gesture, "Yeah, whelp, he's fine."
There were several blank pages that covered the years after their break and his joining the Death Eaters, and then the one picture that broke his heart.
"I am bisexual."
No human mind could comprehend the vastness of heaven, so it became something that could be understood; a white expanse of clouds, a wondrous city paved with gold, a warm familiar place. And so it was with Elder's headquarters, an antechamber, as it was, of heaven.
Draco was kneeling over a boy whose ribcage had been completely shattered when one of the falling rocks knocked him into a wall before landing on his chest. One of the other students removed the rock, but it took the last of her energy, leaving Draco alone to try and reconstruct the bones and remove the splinters embedded in the delicate tissue they were supposed to protect.
An eternity was lost in the soft press of mouth on mouth and the exquisite tangling of tongues.
So far he found out his boss was some kind of were-thing and knew who he was, he had been attacked by death eaters, he had been saved by Snape and a vampire, of all things, and now Draco.
Another interrupted, "Now then, he is just tired. Last night's celebration was excitement enough the exhaust all of us."
(See the end of the chapter for
The music was loud, and the dance floor throbbed with bodies, mostly male, and mostly unclothed. The professional dancers were on a break and the audience members, worked into heat by the near naked performers, were taking the opportunity the DJ's gave them to work off some excess energy and hormones.
Just after dinner when Draco was taking his usual constitutional/Prefect round through the castle Pansy and Blaise had mentioned a particularly lovely view of the lake from the windows in an abandoned classroom.
As soon as Severus opened his mouth Paige snatched her hand back, hearing Phoebe snort behind her.
The dark haired man turned. "Yeah?"
Standing at the open doors of that balcony, Draco removed his robes, folding them carefully and setting them on the floor, out of the way. He had something to prove.
"Alright Gin, thanks." With a weak gesture, the mirror went dark and Harry was left alone with his thoughts.
Ron's fever had finally broken, and the boy slipped into an exhausted rest when Harry let himself relax. Nudging Neville awake to take a shift at watch, he went outside to see the sun rise and smoke a cigarette. It was an unhealthy and unattractive habit, but it was pretty much the only vice he could afford.
The blond stood, awkwardly, one hand braced against the rough stone wall. He took two steps forward and his legs buckled, Chris moving to catch him.
The brunette looked taken aback. "You don't know?"
Harry's mouth fell open and Draco began to laugh.
"It would seem so. I see no reason to keep up with childish threats at this point. The outcome of our battle in inevitable now. You will die, it's only a matter of when."
"I thought I locked that," Alex said, still smiling.
"Draco? You're awake?" Draco looked up and saw Hermione standing over him. She knelt down at his side and pressed a hand against his torso, over the area where his ribs had been broken. "Seems to be mended," she said absently, then sat back on her heels.
Severus smiled and looked at the crowd. "I suppose you're right, Miss Matthews."
Draco turned away, staring at the embroidery on the quilt in his lap. "… I still have a link to Potter. I should have severed it when my assignment ended, but I—I wanted to be sure he was okay."
"Harry? I don't know who that is."
Draco felt his boyfriend's hair brush his cheek as the green-eyed boy leaned forward.
Normally Lucius avoided the sight. The gardens were Narcissa's project, and they were maintained in her honor and grew as green and lush as they had during her life. His heart aching again at the thought of his beloved, Lucius clenched his jaw, but as he turned away he saw something flash in the depth of the foliage and it drew his attention. Looking closer he saw a blond head moving back and forth under the leaves of an old willow tree. The blond hair was just the color of his wife's and he was caught in the dream that it might be his Narcissa returned to him.
As the boy looked up Severus felt a familiar pain in his chest. He always believed he was past his love for Lily Evans, and then he would see those green eyes again and be brought back to the place where yet another person he cared about betrayed him.
After the vomit gave way to dry heaves, which faded slowly to deep shudders, he was able to turn and face the rescuer of his hair.
A few hours later Draco returned and they were too late.
"My Master, I can help if you need me."
Phoebe's eyes widened and she nodded, a sly smile building on her face as Paige had to fight down the same expression.
"Okay, Paige, you stay here with Severus." The older man opened his mouth to say something, but Harry cut him off. "No, Severus. If Voldemort has this weapon and he's intent on using it, you are vulnerable."
The blond broke off with a gasp, pressing his hands to his stomach and falling to his knees on the floor.
Before he had the chance he felt a firm tug on his shirt sleeve that unbalanced him and he fell back to the ground.
Harry shook his head. "What? Help you how?"
With a smile on his face, Harry closed his eyes and pictured the Halliwell house and a small niche just off the living room.
When he got there he found his red-headed best friend curled up on one of the beds, sweating heavily, thick bandages wrapped around his chest.
Severus nodded. "I do understand how you feel. But you have to remember that Draco has responsibilities outside of the war, and apart from us."
Without voices they spoke of pain, and sorrow; and the hope found in the potential for joy. Of the tempting desire to surrender, to give in. Then the press of responsibility and of tasks that must be completed.
When he opened his eyes, which he'd closed in anticipation of a strike, he saw Chris staring at him quizzically, and then Draco gasped as the brunette white lighter pulled him close. In a shower of blue sparks they disappeared from the cave.
Draco didn't seem to notice them walking towards him. He was muttering, and as they got closer, they could hear him whispering, "Help. Paige. Chris. Please help me. Please help me."
Harry felt Draco jerk in his arms and the blond looked up quickly. Harry saw Draco grinning and felt the pressure of tears in his eyes. He nodded frantically, grinning through the impending tears, and felt Draco's head bob next to his.
Draco took his hand tentatively. He'd never had a good history with introductions.
He felt Draco rise up, none too gently slamming knees and elbows against Harry as he did so.
Paige asked her sister and Phoebe just said that the little family was exhausted and needed their privacy so they has been tucked away in Blaise's room with wards set up to keep the noise out so they could rest and bond.
Draco nudged him again. "Come on, you lazy bugger. Wake uop."
Down in the Infirmary, he held Draco's hand, oblivious to the medi-witch working around him and the curious stares he received from everyone that passed through the white room.
Blaise seemed convinced, running one hand over his grumbling tummy, and Paige saw Piper guiding the boy into the kitchen when all of them heard a loud whimper, followed by the harsh sound of an indrawn breath.
"He's right, Harry," Hermione said.
A giant of a man with a bristling beard came out of the stables and took the reins of Ron and Harry's horses before looking at Draco.
"You're kidding, right?"
Severus made his way, slowly, to the small breakfast nook in his quarters and waited for the house elves to deliver his usual breakfast of toast and coffee. When the food arrived, Draco snatched the first slice, slathering it thickly with grape jelly.
"My Lord?"
Night after night he was chased with shining implements he couldn't identify, suffocated in bolts of strange fabric, his eyes were burned, and holes were pierced in his skin with a strange apparatus.
Indignant grey eyes caught his, "It was a trap, idiot. Let me say that again, and slower. It. Was. A. Trap."
"So, this is going to happen," Harry said, his voice shaking.
Harry winced, then turned away, shifting to get his feet under him so he could stand and leave and run as far and as fast as he could.
He could already think of the effect of the cool piercing against other bits of Harry.
"Okay, we're here, now spill," Paige said, and Harry leaned in to listen closer, even though there was no other noise in the room.
"Seamus told me. Said Malfoy left early, though. So I don't know why he'd be so sick."
American.
He fought back a blush and moved to sit next to her. "Nonsense. It's very cold in these dungeons. I just wanted something wa-"
All he remembered after that was making some inane comment and running for his life, mumbling a wandless spell to clean the blood from his hands.
"Okay, maybe I said something about wanting to update my look a little, but a complete makeover?"
Hermione and Neville broke away from their teams, along with a few of the other group leaders. They gathered around Harry and Draco, their faces serene, but their eyes shining with the fierce light that told Harry they were ready to fight.
The two boys fell together on the bed to sleep, to dream of costumes and kisses, getting dressed up, and the joy of taking it all off.
The vampire grinned and leaned in, catching the man's mouth in a fierce kiss, teeth and tongue flashing in the dim light of the exposed bulb hanging from the ceiling.
The first thing he saw was his boss, Alex, and behind him a pale, bleached blond man.
Harry felt himself shaking, but whether it stemmed from fear or anger he couldn't be sure, "What the hell are you?"
Piper rolled her eyes, "Why would I? He's a vampire Chris. I don't think he's scared of the dark."
Feeling the other man's hand in his, he quickly shook it free, hoping no one had seen them together. Maybe it wouldn't be too late for his lover to pass this off as another dramatic rescue. But the shaking woke Harry, and he turned sleep-bleared eyes on Draco.
Severus sighed, wishing he had taken a moment to get a glass of brandy before sitting down. "I don't know what you want me to tell you, Potter. I can't predict when you will die any more than I can predict my own death or anyone else's. It may be years or days, or even minutes."
Paige saw a distinct look of relief in Chris's eyes every time Piper complained about morning sickness or swollen ankles or how irritating it would be to have two small children, then turned to face the adult embodiment of the baby with a glowing smile and said it was worth it. The brunet white lighter's conception date was looming and Chris had confessed to Paige that he was worried he might end up never existing at all.
The red head stepped forward, fist held high and Draco shrank back, but before the blow could land, the green eyed boy reached forward and blocked it. "Enough, Ron." Turning back to Draco he said, "I cannot leave you here. This forest is Gryffindor country and if the border guards saw you, you would be dead."
A few seconds later he was done reading and he looked at Paige, a confused expression in his eyes. "I don't understand. He said he had a surprise for me, but that by the time I read this I would already know what it was. You said he was here, but I never saw him. Why would he come all the way to California and not say anything."
Severus turned where the petite brunette was pointing and saw Harry and Draco walk into the room, more than a bit mussed.
Then Draco twisted his tongue just so and all of the brunet's thoughts were washed away for long moments.
Mock surprise and warm laughter warred for control in Draco's response, "A Griffindor? Sneaking out of his dorm in the middle of a Monday night? Whatever is the wizarding world coming to?"
Harry had taken Draco aside to see if the blond could accompany them, but Draco pled his duty as a white lighter and Harry had no other choice but to agree.
With that Draco felt that heart in his throat drop to his stomach and land with a hard thump. He knew it must have shown on his face because Severus rubbed a hand over his face and turned away.
"We can't stay here."
"Please love; I'm a vampire, ain't I? I can smell it."
Harry woke up, but kept his eyes closed because he learned very early in life that the more you knew, the safer you were, and people said more when they thought you weren't listening.
A regular Tuesday morning. It always felt too early, no matter that it was the same time they'd woken up at every morning for the last couple of years.
The only thing that really struck Draco was how much nothing had changed.
His decision was made when Paige met his eyes and hissed. "Severus what the hell is going on?"
Draco looked away, but Severus could seen the sheen of tears over his grey eyes. "I didn't even see him. Paige told me he was there, but he wouldn't stay for me, would he? And now he's not even answered my letters and he hit me. I mean, he hit me."
Both Severus and Xander said Draco had a 'gift' for destruction and he could only hope that gift served him now.
In the alley behind the club, Harry pulled out his mobile and told Hermione what was going on.
Another Elder stepped forward, but Draco watched as Shannon pushed her way past, coming to his side.
Severus shook his head. "Nothing now, but I can prepare something. When will you be going?"
"Where is Draco," the brunet asked and Harry felt his breath freeze in his chest. He hadn't looked. The whitelighter hadn't even crossed his mind since the blast. He turned frantically, searching for a glimpse of blond hair. He spotted Draco hunched over a supine figure on the floor and breathed a sigh of relief. The air around the two men was light blue. Draco wasn't injured, he was healing.
Naturally, Harry was suspicious.
Unlike the potions master, whose skills were only used in peace and solitude, well away from the press and crush of the fighting, Harry was needed in strategy meetings, then on the battlefields themselves. Too many of the boy's nights were taken with cataloguing the dead, and planning the sorties that were now daily routine.
Paige almost winced at the tone. She wanted to feel sympathy for the guy, but at the same time she wanted answers so she just leaned in and watched him sweat.
Dropping the smouldering end of his cigarette on the pavement, he ground it out with his boot and went back inside.
"I'm fine," Harry shouted, lowering his voice as the red-faced red-haired boy got closer, "But something's wrong with Draco. I think the arrow was poisoned."
"Chris Perry," at Paige's sharp stare, he added, "—Halliwell. And this is my aunt, Paige. We're friends of Draco's from San Francisco ."
"Who are you to tell me what I can and cannot do, Severus?"
At the first sip, Harry saw a shine in Draco's eyes, but the boy didn't stop. He tipped the glass up higher. A few gulps later, he had to support the globe with both hands, and the tearing in his eyes was obvious.
Draco focused his attention on the binder, "I know, but I'm staking my claim anyway. Your ass is mine Potter, in flannel or leather. How about this one?"
Until now.
This startled Chris, who had been watching the proceedings with an expression of mixed worry and amusement. "Wyatt's missing? Mom, what's going on?'
Still watching him warily, she spoke, "My name is Paige Matthews and you're in sunny San Francisco. Your godson brought you here, you got burned or something when a potion exploded."
With no warning, a demon burst through the windows, and Phoebe barely had time for a choked off scream before a swing of the leathery fist drove her into a large book case. Paige spared her sister a glance, but she couldn't stop to check on her yet.
And before he knew it, he was crying, and it hurt, more than he remembered.
"Okay, we're here, now spill," Paige said, sitting n the very edge of the couch and leaning forward.
Paige smirked. "So, you're an Elder, huh?"
Alex sighed, slumping into his chair. "I'm a were-hyena, of a sort. I never physically change, but I have some of the characteristics of the animal. I've been fighting evil since I was in high school, which puts us in pretty much the same boat."
When he entered the hall it seemed as though most of the dancers had been waiting for him because the crowd gasped as one. This time, instead of his going to Harry, the prince came to him and without words led him onto the dance floor.
That was the main reason Severus had changed his focus to the subject in the first place. It gave him an hours long excuse to be left alone.
Harry, rose from his chair and rushed from the hall, ignoring his friends calls.
Draco smiled and shrugged, and followed Harry into the house.
Harry looked sad for a moment, then pouted slightly and grinned. "Very well, you may go. But tomorrow night you must be more beautiful, agreed?"
Harry opened his mouth to introduce himself, but before he could say anything Phoebe cut him off.
Finally shaking himself out of his stupor, Harry stammered. "Of course, of course. I'm not leaving you in the lurch. I'm sorry, I was just- godfather, I mean- definitely."
Severus felt his stomach flip as the young whitelighter paled at the thought.
"Now, what happened after that?"
"Piper, watch Draco. I'm going to get the banishing potions."
None of Severus's pictures were magical. It was too painful to see the endless repetitions of awkward moments in his life. Bad enough to remember them without watching himself relive them over and over again.
Immediately after the net appeared Severus relaxed and Harry heard him sigh in relief.
Shortly after they got back to the Manor, Piper had taken Blaise under her wing. She'd been pregnant before and knew what the boy might have to deal with. Though Phoebe was leery at first, after Blaise said he didn't have anyone to turn to the middle sister threw away any reservations she might have had about a pregnant boy and eagerly agreed to begin the shopping process.
"You're bruised pretty well, but there are no cuts."
Phoebe sputtered. "Hey! I was serving a purpose. I'll have you know that according to everything I've rea-"
"So, wait, you know how the war ends," Draco said.
Severus nodded, setting his plate next to his glass on the table before following Paige into the garden.
Lucius felt his legs collapse beneath him, too weak to hold him upright, as the child approached. This is what had killed his wife, this small wrinkled thing.
Draco anticipated Blaise lasting out his enforced rest for one more day before he snapped and apparated himself to the living room, which would be necessary as Ron had warded the door on both sides.
Faded and shrunken, the pants and shirt fit Harry with no room to spare. But if the admiring light in Hermione's eyes was any indication, he looked good. He ran his fingers through his hair a few times, long ago giving up any hope of making it behave, tucked his wand into his boot, and left.
It turned out to be a futile effort as he elbowed his way past her on the way to the refrigerator, but as the only other inhabitants of the kitchen were Severus and Draco, Paige figured they were safe.
Harry smiled at the boy, "So if she asks where you were, you're going to tell her?"
Walking through the kitchen to the living room Harry felt his teeth vibrating from the noise. He didn't know the song, but it sounded vaguely like one of Hermione's workout mixes.
According to the blond, the tie that the Dark Lord has with his servants through the marks they bore would be enough of a bond to allow the man to use this weapon, to tap into all of their power and use it as his own.
Inside were pictures of everything he wanted to remember, for good or ill.
They looked into the shifting distance of a grey sky peering through the black trees of a snowy wood.
The witch shook her head. "Not hardly, Severus. He's a wreck and we need your help."
Something sparked in Harry's eyes, and even if it was only anger, Severus was happy to see it.
It had been three hours since Hermione sent the request. They didn't know exactly when Ron was injured, but all three of them knew time was running out. Neville had taken Harry aside when Hermione went to get ice and said that there was no way it was only a scratch. Ron was too sick for it to be anything but a bite, and if they didn't get the potion soon, Ron would be a werewolf for the rest of his life.
Draco looked from Harry to Severus. "But I- my father?"
He shrank the photo album and tucked it back into his pocket before standing again and following Paige's path out of the room.
Draco smiled when the pain was gone, calling an answering grin out of Harry as the Gryffindor put his wand away. Eagerly the boy said, "So, do I get to see it?"
Draco swayed slightly on his feet as another blast rocked the castle and his eyes looked glazed. Harry signaled for one of the other rescuers to bring the fallen soldier, whom he now saw was Dean Thomas, to the infirmary before he wrapped his arms around the sagging blond's torso and led him to a low pile of rubble in the corner. Helping Draco sit, Harry did a quick field triage on the other boy. There were no cuts or bruises visible, but when Harry pressed Draco's chest the blond winced.
When he awoke, the curtains over the small window were closed, but the amber glow of a streetlight bled through.
"You took his side. I suppose I should have expected that." Harry stood up. "Thank you for the drink and the conversation, Professor. I have to go."
The silence seemed to go on forever. Draco sat frozen in time, the weapon a freezing block of ice behind him, and in front of him, Harry.
Harry scoffed. "You will do as you have been doing. Your brews can save lives or take them. That is your worth in this fight. Right now no one cares how quickly you can throw a hex."
The sensation faded like morning fog as the grey-eyed boy smirked gently at her.
The three women moved away and Harry tried to follow them but he couldn't pull away. he looked down to where Snape crouched between Blaise's spread legs and a steady flow of blood and fluid covered the towels laid over the couch cushions.
Severus stepped towards the cubicle and drew back the curtain.
He got past the first few guards with no problems. They were startled and the draw of the weapon had weakened them enough to slow their reflexes. He stupefied four before he got to a real fight.
The guards froze and the king stepped forward, brushing Draco's cheek with his hand while the boy fought the urge the shudder and turn away.
"Leave him be, Jenkins. He is tending the fires as is his duty, and you are to be serving the prince."
Paige met Severus's eyes. They had a lot to talk about.
The woman set her hand on the prince's shoulder and smiled. "I have lived a long life, my child. I have seen you and your mother and many others into the world, and now I may help you escape this terrible fate. I have lived a good life and I will die well."
Harry nodded. "He was the one who rescued me from the DE's. Him and Spike and a white lighter named Chris."
Harry sniffled lightly, "I wanted to do it for him, but my car broke down and here I am. I just need enough to fix it up. I can wait tables, or tend bar, or… whatever you need."
Laughing Harry rushed forward and took Draco in his arms, kissing him chastely on the lips. "And if I say I will have you forever, my Bearski-Draco?"
"Draco?"
"No, they have to be tied to whomever is using the weapon somehow, though we didn't get much detail on that."
A shrill cry sounded in Paige's ears, and when she looked at Chris, he had his hands pressed against his ears, but it didn't block out the sound. Somewhere, someone was screaming.
"Ronald Bilious Weasley this is your fault and if you ever come near me again I will rip your dick off!"
He got teased mercilessly by the sisters for his glow after a conversation with the green-eyed boy, but he couldn't help himself.
Harry didn't respond.
Spike's voice rolled out of the basement doorway, "Shouted like a harpy she did. Poor nephew blew out of here like a strong wind."
When they got there, they saw that the massive room was full. It looked like everyone had gotten into their battle groups, and Harry quickly counted them off in his head. He knew there were at least two teams out in the field or on guard duty, but it looked like everyone else was ready. The room echoed with tense conversation and there was electricity in the air.
"So you want me to what? Seduce him? Why can't you just have Zabini in here? He'd probably enjoy it, the twisted bastard."
The vampire muttered under his breath.
Severus looked away form the gathering to see Paige smiling softly at him.
Draco called out towards the ceiling, hoping the red haired elder would hear him.
"And the potion," Severus asked.
"He was there. He was in the hall when Shannon was visiting."
Harry looked up when he heard Hermione. The girl was standing in front of him and it looked as though Ron was now explaining the intricacies of Blaise's pregnancy to Neville.
The voice was loud and it rattled his bones. Draco opened his eyes, carefully and painfully, squinting at the blurry pale figure before him.
The very edges of his nerves were trembling. That combined with the sharp metallic taste in his mouth indicated the Cruciatus. Severe queasiness was the final clue, and as he felt propelled up from the surface he was lying on to retch on the floor next to him, he felt reasonably sure what he had been cursed with.
"Harry, you know we need an in here. Word has it that the owner knows everyone on the grey side of magical law, and Voldemort has been trying to get a foothold into America lately. If we can get close to the manager, we can get some answers, maybe a big advantage."
The pregnant boy sighed again, and went on, "I know the ingredients, but the timing… My… My belly hit the table and knocked the wormwood in too soon, it must have reacted with the agate and dragon's blood. The next thing I knew the room was full of smoke and I couldn't breathe. When I woke up, I was in here and fine, and Severus…," Blaise swallowed heavily, "He saved my life, my baby. If you can help him, please, please save him."
The baby was crowning.
Covering his ears he walked into the kitchen.
Tonight, the red-headed boy had gone to the local community college, following rumours that Death Eaters were recruited from the students.
Draco smiled at this.
"Nothing. They can't see anything beyond fierce bursts of green light. And she got very sarcastic about the whole thing."
"Idiot Potter. If I wasn't already dead…"
The other woman took it and shook it once, firmly. "I'm Shannon." The woman, Shannon, looked Paige over curiously. "You're a whitelighter, aren't you."
The man's expression sobered and Severus watched a different face pass over the laughing one. Before the man had looked young, carefree, and vaguely threatening. Now he was serious and defiant, and most definitely threatening.
"In the flesh, Severus."
The boy looked up and met his father's gaze, his eyes reflecting a confusion and wariness Lucius remembered from his wife.
He sighed quietly. Perhaps love made sense in fairy tales, but Severus was sure that was the only place.
But Blaise only smiled and pushed Draco's hair back, murmuring something about 'shaggy dogs' in the new parental tone he had developed in the past few weeks.
As the vivid colors of dawn faded into a sunny blue Draco rose from his perch in a tree branch and jumped to the ground.
And gave in.
"Severus? You can wake up now."
He was a Prince to be proud of.
His prayers were answered when Draco looked up and met his eyes fiercely. "Of course I love you, you idiot. I've been trying to tell you that for ages. We didn't get the chance to say it before you left and then you weren't answering my letters and-"
"I'm sorry, my Lord-"
After learning his real age and a bare outline of his life before he became a whitelighter, Piper had withdrawn all of her animosity towards him and Spike and took both blonds under her wing along with Blaise, keeping all of them well-fed and well-rested and only slightly over-protected.
"Honestly, no. You look a mess. Why didn't you go get a hangover potion from Snape?"
Severus took a deep breath. "Go to Draco, Harry. Tell him that you love him and that you want him for whatever time the two of you have."
His arm still around Draco, Harry walked over to the stereo with the other boy.
After he left Harry set the pictures of Blaise and prenatal Weasley on the floor next to the cot and leaned back, feeling the last of the tremors work their way out of his system. He was tired, but his head was too busy with the events of the past twenty-four hours to sleep.
"Is this okay, Harry," Draco asked.
"Who are you," the green eyed boy asked.
Harry looked for Alex and saw him on one of the couches, curled around Spike, the two of them pressed so tightly together that Harry worried for their safety at the same time he felt massively jealous. While part of his brain wandered over to the snack table, another one was planning to find another couch for he and Draco to-
"So," Paige said. "Prophecies are vague mysterious portents of the future. You can't let your entire life fall to the wayside because of something a complete stranger said before you were born."
"Xander?"
In that instant everything came rushing back to Draco. The Dark Lord, the tent, the weapon, and a ray of green light.
There was no such luck as he heard them dismount from their horses and walk closer, heavy footsteps over the dead leaves sending echoes through the dark woods.
Something in Severus called out to him to rush to the boy, who was sitting silently and staring at the floor, torn between fighting the urge for the sake of both of their dignities and giving in to it, Severus heard a soft sob.
"It is wrapped in cotton, Severus. You caught it on the desk on your way down, and unfortunately whitelighter healing doesn't work very well on wizards."
"Okay, tell me everything you know about the weapon."
The red head laughed softly. "Yeah. Big bad war hero can't handle the sight of blood."
Draco looked up from healing Chris's back and saw Piper holding pitcher of water and a stack of towels.
And he was in complete and utter shock, his head spinning with what Ginny had told him only a week before.
But she forged on. The sandwich she'd had at two in the morning was filling, but if she didn't start her morning with an actual breakfast, she was twitchy all day.
Absently, Paige saw Spike wander out of the basement and over to the living room.
Together they approached the infirmary and Severus found cold dread build in his chest. He pulled Hermione to a halt. "Is he injured? Did something happen?"
"What's going on?"
Harry looked up and Draco lost himself for only a second in the depths of those green eyes before shaking off the distraction. Harry had said something, but for the life of him Draco couldn't remember what it was. Hoping it was nothing important he nodded and brushed Harry's hands aside to stand.
Harry realized that it had been a while, but he tried to ignore the uncomfortably familiar sensation of an inappropriate erection. This was not the time.
"No." Harry's voice was implacable and the steely glare the Gryffindor was giving him told Draco was a bad time to argue.
Paige worked one arm free and grabbed a towel from the stack, trying to lay it out under Blaise's legs. She felt warm hands take it from her and looked up as long fingers brushed hers to see Severus adjusting the towel, a soft light in his eyes.
Harry stifled a gasp, and heard Snape try and fail to do the same. Draco couldn't be dead. Or he could, he could be a vampire or something.
It was Harry. Harry had found him.
Draco turned back to Harry and saw that the Gryffindor's glazed eyes were focused on his mouth. Not a new experience, but pleasant never the less.
For years Severus had avoided thinking of his personal life, but these months away from the war and the Dark Lord had afforded him the freedom to be what he had ever been before, a regular man. His feelings for Lily were a childish crush on an idealized figure, but Severus knew there was potential with Paige, potential for a relationship between adults with someone who would understand him and the fight.
"My son is still a child Severus. That figure was almost the image of my wife when we met."
Severus and the three women were standing at a small table covered in snacks that Harry's grumbling stomach encouraged him to visit, and soon, and Hermione and Neville were standing by the stereo with the other white lighter, Chris.
"No, Dragon, it's just an exceptionally detailed and realistic dream." Severus saw the woman, Paige, smile slightly, and Draco seemed calmed.
He wasn't proud of his behavior, always believing himself above such blatant cowardice, but in the face of events he had no choice.
Snape echoed the sigh. It was most likely true. In the two months since Draco… left, Snape had done everything in his power to locate his godson, even turning to some of the darker blood magics, with no result. When the boy disappeared from his chambers, he completely disappeared and in his absence, Harry had changed.
One day a few months later he found it underneath his desk and though the sight hurt, the pain had faded. In hindsight he wasn't in love with Lily. He loved her but it wasn't romantic, it was more than that and completely different.
"He is scary, isn't he? He just gives me the tingles, he's so frightening."
"That was really sappy, Godfather," Draco muttered into the blankets.
"I—uh—yeah. I don't know. I leaned and it opened," Harry stuttered.
But in a way these dreams were worse. Harry always knew in some tiny part of his awareness that the nightmares Voldemort sent were outside of him, but these tortures came from his own life, his own heart.
Looking around the hall she saw a large group of people of all ages staring at them in curiosity and confusion. Some of them seemed to recognize Draco, but no one stepped forward.
Seamus was good; Harry had to give him that. The Irish boy had all of the tricks down, waiting until everyone was asleep, holding his shoes instead of wearing them, and leaving bulky robes in his trunk so they would snag anything or knock it over.
"So, what do we do now?"
"Ignore him," she said. "He won't even remember saying it once the baby's born."
Paige saw a strange expression cross Draco's face, then the young whitelighter disappeared in a shower of blue sparks at the same time Blaise grabbed her hand tight. Paige looked at him. his eyes were squeezed shut and large beads of sweat were trickling down from his hairline.
Putting on his best intimidating professor voice, Severus said, "Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter."
Alex leaned forward on the desk, motioning Harry to take a chair. Smiling, his regular smile now and not the insane rictus grin of moments before, he said, "Did you really think America was such a backwater that we wouldn't know who you are?"
There was a fire in the depths of the other man's eyes as he said, "Never say that, Draco. Never say that, you foolish boy."
"Harry? What are you doing he- Are you okay?"
The last few words were aimed directly at Granger and the young Weasley girl. Both of them cared for Harry, but they expressed it through nagging and affectionate smothering. Severus knew a great deal about heartbreak, and he knew that that was the last thing Harry would need.
So twice a week it was 'Demon' night at The Meat Market.
Severus was surprised. "What do you mean? I know your sisters and nephe-"
The next morning Harry found a note waiting on the table by his bed, tucked securely under his glasses. Harry felt the belated sting of a paper cut as he opened the seal and saw it was from Draco.
"That's enough now," Spike said, pulling Xander back and into his arms. "I think you're about done. So, what are you two doing here?"
Closing his eyes Draco felt the cold tingle of orbing rush over his skin. The next time he opened his eyes he was standing at the edge of the Forbidden Forest just behind a grey tent. A strange blue light glowed from inside the tent and Draco's breath caught in his throat. It had to be the weapon.
Pansy and Blaise nodded, and Draco let out a bitter laugh.
Their first stop would be Oxnard so Alex and Spike could return to the club and the others could retrieve their things, then back to Scotland and Hogwarts.
At Ron's urging they broke up the sappy moment and Ron turned back to the room, keeping his grin under admirable control.
Severus inclined his head slightly. "You are subtle. I believe I am the only one who could tell, and that is only because I have observed your interactions with my godson for many years."
Paige opened her eyes and turned around. Severus looked uninjured, but there was an unhealthy green tint to his skin. Under the green Severus was paler than Paige had ever seen him, and he was pretty pale normally. He leaned heavily against the door frame, Chris and Spike nowhere in sight.
Harry grinned widely, exposing his crooked smile, then pushed his unruly hair off of his face where a few tendrils had caught on the frame of his glasses.
Hermione's voice was piercing, and from the corner of his eye Harry could see Alex and Spike alternately giggling and wincing in sympathy before walking into the back office.
Harry smiled at his gobsmacked friends and followed. He knew where his priorities lay and he wanted to discuss their 'mutual circumstances' and 'agreeable solution' a bit more.
Gathering all of his strength, Draco pushed Harry away. Fighting his own body because all he wanted to do was pull the man closer, "Harry, what are you doing? They'll know now, you know Weasel can't keep is mouth shut."
"'Love?' Harry, you shouldn't say that, someone might hear-"
The blond vampire's face became serious. "Look Paige, all I can tell you is what I know. You're interested in Snape, and he's interested in you, or at least curious. I can't promise true love to anyone on this earth but me and my Xan-pet, but how are you to know what will come of it unless you ask?"
Harry stood frozen in the mouth of the hall. Draco was talking in the living room, but she couldn't make out what he was saying. Whatever it was it had the green eyed boy in shock, his shoulders slumped even as his back tensed.
"Oh yes, how on earth could I have forgotten the war. I mean it isn't as though I was just kidnapped and tortured by a group of fanatical idiots or anything."
Severus could hear the air crackle with Harry's magic. It felt like the tantrum Severus had been expecting for the past week was on its way.
It broke apart on contact with the creature's leathery skin, and a sizzling noise accompanied by low growls filled the room, along with the stench of burning demon.
Harry had to wait to respond because his boyfriend was almost literally choking with laughter.
The green eyed boy shook his head, looking almost sad. "I am sorry, but this forest is not safe. Come with us and we will find you a home and work, perhaps even clean you up a bit, eh?" He smiled, but there was still sorrow in the depths of his verdant eyes.
Shannon gripped his shoulders firmly, turning him to face her. "What's going on, Draco, what do you want?"
Following Phoebe's motion, Paige looked down at the mess on and around the couch and grimaced.
Severus tucked his wand back into his wrist-sheath and pushed through the crowd until he was a Spike's side. He spoke in a normal tone of voice, trusting to the vampire's enhanced senses and certain that the writing bodies around him would never hear over the throbbing techno and their own drunken screams.
When the blond Slytherin offered his hand, Harry took it and stood, brushing the dust off of his robe with the other.
"Draco, are you here? Please don't hide.
Hermione sighed. "Well, you're in the hall because the infirmary is full. We sanitized the floor and laid out some blankets for the less severely injured students. And as for Harry…" Hermione's voice softened as her gaze drifted away. "He's doing what he does."
"And now he said something about not wanting a lifetime with you? Could he have heard anything?"
Harry's stomach flipped and all of the blood seemed to rush from his head. He tried again to pull his hand away and this time, with the strength born in panic, he managed to get free and flee to the other side of the room.
"Hardly," Blaise replied, smirking. "The only person in the school gayer than Potter is Finnegan."
Draco rushed past Harry into the room, his hands glowing blue again, but Paige held him back.
Hermione opened her mouth, but before she could say anything Draco went on. "If you must know Harry came to me, told me he had made a realization and brought me outside for a modicum of privacy so we could discuss our mutual circumstances. We came to an agreeable solution and here we are."
If he had the nerve to admit it, he would say he was in love.
"Feeling better?"
Harry spoke before he had the chance to think about it, "Do you?"
And with that Severus could control himself no longer and he started laughing. After a few seconds Harry joined him and together they laughed until they were out of breath.
If it had been Draco, Severus would know what to do, but this was Harry. Still, the older man called on what knowledge 18 years as a godfather bestowed upon him and took the blanket off of the back of the couch, wrapping it around Harry's shoulders.
"You didn't know? I mean, the air between you two was electric, and it's such a romantic—"
The bag reappeared in front of her and a cultured accent said, "I'm terribly sorry about that. Though I would be rather difficult to kill, unless… You're not a dark-lighter are you?"
"If I knew anything. I'd say so. But Draco never talks to me. Hell, he never talks to anybody but Spi—"
Draco snorted softly. "I am dead," he muttered, then bit his tongue. He hadn't told Blaise about his life, about the way he died or the fact that he was a whitelighter. He hung his head, letting his bangs fall in front of his eyes while he waited to see what his best friend would do with the admission.
Chris was standing with his mother and Phoebe over a small table covered in snacks where it appeared both women were exhorting the lanky brunet to eat.
The vampire looked surprised. Hesitantly, he said, "You're trusting me?"
As always, please review. I appreciate Kudos and Bookmarks very much but it's Comments I find most encouraging
"They're tied that closely, Spike?"
Severus turned and saw Neville Longbottom walking over, a pink blush on his cheeks.
Shannon spoke, her voice sounding more tentative than it ever had, "We… We could do something about that."
Severus was standing nearby, his wand in his hand and a gentle blue glow suffusing the air over the pregnant boy.
"Hermione, it's the weapon." The bushy haired girl nodded. It was one of her spies that had told Harry about the weapon only that morning. "Severus is under Paige's wards in the dungeon right now."
Severus fought to hold on to his dinner as he settled in the dusty room. Seeing a chair nearby, he grabbed the back of it and collapsed onto the seat as his knees gave out beneath him. He took a few deep breaths to settle his stomach, then looked up at the vampire.
"Pouting? I can barely breathe right now and you say I'm pouting?"
"I'm not sure if I should be insulted or jealous at this point. Are you trying to imply that I'm not enough for you, Mr. Malfoy," Harry asked as he slid his hand up behind him, caressing the boys' thigh.
Paige heard the deep rumbling voice of Severus Snape roll through the room and squeezed her eyes shut. A few feet away, she heard Phoebe smother a giggle.
The boy sighed, "You know how it is. Ever since first year she's thought she was our mother. Ron has to put up with it, but as I don't want to get into her pants I don't see why I should have to listen."
Held in Hogwarts naturally, not the site of the final battle, but the place where the tide had turned, where war became more reality than just a misty possibility and the most famous and tragic martyring had taken place. On the night Dumbledore had been killed, and Death Eaters had raided this spot, long considered a sanctuary, war had come to Wizardkind.
From the hall Harry could hear Spike's aggrieved, 'Oi,' and he smiled.
He knew it was too late to escape the memories that were swirling in his memory so he found the shrunken photo album in his trouser pocket and enlarged it, thinking that if he was going to be depressed he might as well go full out.
The red head looked up. "Would you two be godfathers?"
"Do we have more information than that?"
Draco looked away from the window to see his best friend, still propped up in his bed.
"I knew the Malfoy and Prewett families had intermarried, but I've never heard of a William."
He saw the Book of Shadows open on its pedestal and he was tempted to go back to his research as a distraction, but the first and last time he touched the book it had set his shirt sleeve on fire. Apparently the Book of Shadows disapproved of his Dark Mark.
Again Harry felt the pressure of recent events, but there was no time to stop, no time to regroup as Severus began to groan and curl up again.
Shock eclipsed the sorrow on Draco's face as he looked up sharply. "Of course I love you, you idiot. I've been trying to tell you that for ages. We didn't get the chance to say it before you left and then you weren't answering my letters and-"
"William, my godson is laying half-dead on a floor. Where the hell have you brought us?"
Both were male, and both carried overtones of familiarity and concern, the second more than the first.
"Do you want forever," Harry asked, crouching down on the floor next to the blond. He reached out and Draco violently flinched away. Harry let his weight carry him the rest of the way to the ground until he was sitting on the rug next to the blond. Without touching him, Harry said, "Do you love me, Draco? Was that ever true?"
"Do you want to clean this up or should I," she asked her sister.
Harry replied, "It was a gift. I found it in my soup last night. There were two other tokens on the previous nights. I expect the servants banded together to surprise me for my birthday."
"Harry? Are you okay?"
Sunday afternoon Harry announced he had a 'surprise' for Draco, and the next thing the blond Slytherin knew they were in front of a rather run down looking tattoo parlor.
"No, no. he loves you, I'm sure of it. Maybe you just misheard him," Severus said. He knew he chose the wrong words as Harry immediately stiffened in his arms and pulled away.
Past the smoke, on the other side of the room, Severus found Zabini slumped over his work table, a cauldron sizzling beside him. From the smell, he almost knew what was brewing, and if he was right there were only a few seconds to spare before it would reach the most volatile point.
Harry pushed up off of Severus's couch and strode to the door.
Six and oe haf days after Harry's return from California and subsequent collapse, Severus set a tray loaded with delicacies in front of the boy with a heavy thump.
"Is it that obvious? I've tried to be subtle about it, in case anyone flows me and finds hi—everybody."
Draco set his fingers on the knobs. The machine was icy cold, freezing his fingers even as he felt the Dark Lord getting closer.
"Harry and I getting together, I suppose. I told her some rubbish about our mutual circumstances and an agreeable solution and I think it put her off."
Startled into alertness, Snape drew his wand from his shirt sleeve and made his way towards the man, for man he was, tall but terribly thin at first glance.
The room froze as Harry whispered, "James?"
Blaise turned away, walking slowly to his room. Draco watched him go, and as he heard the door swing closed, he slid to the ground and pulled his knees to his chest.
"Then let's do this," Draco said, starting sharply towards the staircase leading towards the Slytherin dorms and dragging the hapless Gryffindor along behind him.
Dumbledore had kept a collection of strange devices in his office, many of them covered in strange meters and knobs. Severus had inherited a few and he let Draco 'play' with them, and then Xander, in the rare moments when he was not about to or in the middle of having sex with Spike, had advanced Draco's education in mechanical engineering. Neither man had been able to teach him how to fix things, but Draco was a dab hand at taking them apart.
As they got closer the music got louder and when they stepped into the kitchen deep base notes throbbed through their feet.
"Just try it first, okay?"
A quick spell simulating laser surgery had taken care of his myopia and astigmatism, and Harry knew the bright green color of his irises was much more visible with the light tracing of coal liner Draco had applied. All of these things combined gave Harry's coy gaze the stopping power of a bullet train.
"How is he," another voice asked.
Pulling up a chair, Harry settled in for a few hours of clock-watching, trying to convince himself that everything would be fine.
"Professor, you have to help him, there was a crossbo-"
She moved forward, taking Piper's place at Draco's side. The whitelighter had fallen on his side, the hand underneath him still pressed to his ear. Paige saw a thin stream of blood flowing from the exposed ear and assumed both sides were the same.
Draco was short. Not that it meant anything, as Harry was short himself, but the other boy still had the gangly arms and legs that heralded an impending growth spurt that would never come, and Draco's skin, so pale and smooth, would never need to be touched by a blade.
Paige smiled, "Fraid not."
After a while, the sobs faded and he could hear her telling him it would be okay.
Finally she sat down with the boy and they worked it out. The last time Draco heard from Harry was the day of the zoo trip. Paige got Draco to confess what he and Shannon had been talking about that day. The possibility of his having a real life-long relationship with Harry.
"Still throwing things when you're angry, eh?"
It wasn't an easy life, Harry and Draco had to learn to live together. The press had a field day with the news that the Malfoy and Potter heirs were in love. And Harry's friends weren't much help, though Hermione, always weak for a romantic story, accepted it easily. Over time, people got used to it. It wasn't scandalous anymore, it just was.
Severus looked over and saw Chris, Hermione, and Neville smile at the pair before turning back to their debate.
The orange juice was almost empty, a few good gulps would finish the jug, and since she was in slouchy clothes anyway Paige grinned to herself and raised the jug to her lips.
Blaise jumped in, "Frankly Draco, there are only two people who don't know you have the hots for Potter. You, and Potter."
The dancer's visible eye was a strangely familiar shade of amber brown. Not that Harry was staring or anything.
"Draco….," the king said wonderingly.
Draco bit back a cry of shock as Pomphrey went on, "And we can't possibly make any plans while you're being hysterical."
Draco felt tears press and fought them back. "You may not die. The king is not so far gone into madness."
Draco smiled gently, "I wanted to come home."
"Very well," Severus said moving further into the room and taking a seat on the low couch next to the bed. "Lucius. I'm afraid the figure you saw was not wholly the creation of your grief."
Then he caught the plump glossy pink flesh of his bottom lip between his chemically whitened and magically straightened teeth.
Paige smiled. She heard the thread of affection running under the words. According to Draco Weasley was one of the boys that had come under Severus's wing as the war went on, much like Blaise, Draco himself, and Harry Potter.
"Alright," Poppy sighed, exhaustion resting heavily on her voice, "Get him to a bed Mr. Potter. Mr. Weasley, go get Professor Snape. He's in his lab in the dungeons so you'll have to hurry."
He knocked out the third Death Eater from before, the one that slashed his shoulder, with a quick hex, and Harry managed to throw a cutting hex of his own that managed to connect with two of the oncoming Death Eaters.
"Considering how my nephew feels about him I wouldn't think of it Sev. But I'm sure the Boy Who Lived would be happy to hear of your concern."
"I mean, it could be days, or months, or years. How do I do it, Severus? How do I make a commitment, a promise, that I may never be able to fulfill."
Of course, there was the night Phoebe tackled a six foot tall, green-haired woman skulking around the bar… But Miss Demeanor was very nice once he got his wig back.
"Everybody? Or just Severus," Phoebe asked, a wry grin making its way past the pained grimace on her face.
Severus nodded and walked toward the other door. Paige felt a cool hand on her shoulder and turned to see Spike, a depth of sorrow in his eyes as he looked from Paige to Draco. Xander came up behind the blond vampire and wrapped his arms around Spike's waist.
, Harry thought,
Searching the thousands of paths and trails that covered the old castle, he found the name he wanted in their room, their private place in the Astronomy Tower. Breathing a sigh of relief, Harry made his way upstairs to the old classroom.
Snape waved Harry into silence, "Mr. Weasley told me, now kindly step away so I may conduct an examination."
"I'm giving you an out, Potter. Take it if you want it."
As she laid eyes on him, he shifted and groaned again before opening his eyes slowly. "What the bloody hell happened to me?"
The days went on and Draco split his time between Blaise and the baby, hunting demons with Chris, and talking to or thinking about Harry.
"Piper, now! Blast 'em," Paige shouted, then dropped to the floor in a ball, her arms over her head and the back of her neck.
"Don't be silly, Piper is your sister and she'd never do anything to harm you. Blaise, on the other hand," Draco said, the smile stretched out into a tense grin.
Harry smiled and laid his arm over Draco's, enjoying the warmth of the other boy against his side. "I suppose it would be," he said before turning in Draco's hold and meeting his eyes, "So say it."
"I'm so sorry, baby boy," Shannon said, her voice warm and soothing. Draco leaned back against her but felt some hard barrier between them. He turned to see what it was and his face hit a bunch of feathers. Pulling back he muttered, "Shannon? What is going on? What are these feathers?"
As he got closer he saw the glitter of blond hair reflecting firelight and he waited.
Draco was audibly weeping now.
Swallowing a wave of nausea, Draco said, "I am not so innocent that I do not understand. My father believes I am my mother returned and he means to wed me, to have me." He felt a thick dampness at the corner of his eyes and brushed away the impending tears. There would be time enough for a collapse later. "What do we do?"
Severus waved, irritated, "I know what a chip is. Living in the magical world is not the same as living in a cave." He sighed, "I suppose I just wonder how much I ever knew of you. I mean, you have family I knew nothing about, you went on adventures as a child, when I worried you were trapped in that monstrous house, and you were dead."
If the note had been from anyone else, Harry would have been waiting in the Room of Requirement. Once revealed to the Hogwarts population at large it had surpassed the Astronomy Tower for all clandestine meetings. But coming from Draco, there was only one place it could be.
Hermione was grinning like a Cheshire Cat and Neville and Chris wore milder versions of the same expression.
When the worst of the storm was over, Severus pushed Harry back upright. He'd neither the patience nor the inclination to try and make sense of the broken syllables that fell from the boy's mouth as he cried into the fabric of his sweater, but now he judged Harry calm enough to talk.
He fished his wand out of his pocket and whispered a gentle 'Alohamora' at the door. It swung open, but all Harry saw was his manager, sporting a relaxed grin, and a blue glow—coming from the ceiling.
Unable to stop himself, Harry cut the blond off with a kiss. Draco hated mushrooms. Hated anything that even looked like a mushroom, he even hated the word 'mushroom', but he had gotten them for Harry.
Ron nodded as well, "I don't like it either, mate. But it has to happen. I mean, you started it after all."
Using the last of his energy he lunged forward and wrapped his arms around Draco as the curse spewed forward. And as everything around him turned a vibrant green, Harry thought he heard the rustle of wings.
"What the hell is going on," Blaise asked, standing up. Paige saw Piper giving the pregnant boy a once-over, but from what she could see the only damage was a bit of dry wall dust in his hair.
In her long conversations with the blond Paige heard the entire history of Harry and Draco, from their first meeting in the robe shop to everything that happened in the garden the night before Harry left. It was amazing that the two of them got together at all and Paige knew from Piper and Leo's example that it was difficult to have a relationship with a white lighter, but then she was sure it was hard to have a relationship with the Boy-Who-Lived as well. Still, she felt confident, knowing Draco the way she did, that if Harry felt half as strongly for the blond as Draco did for him, they would be together for a long time.
Tonight, it would end.
The reality of his mortality sent Draco's thoughts spinning. If he loved Harry he had to find a way to be with him, even if it meant leaving his duty behind.
Fandom rundown-
"Well it may have saved your life, so I guess it works." With that the other boy went and joined Ron and Hermione as the red head began reciting the different names he was considering for his potential offspring and asking the other two's opinion.
Once Phoebe was settled, Paige looked over at Piper, "You guys okay?"
It was Draco.
Still, the blond didn't appear. Harry wandered from couch to couch, prodding each and checking the dark spaces next to and behind them.
The only thing that brought back the old Harry were letters. Once a week the Gryffindor wrote to Draco in California and Draco wrote back, and once a week they got to speak on the magic mirrors. Then Severus would see the smile that he had once resented, being, as it was, half caused by James Potter. And then those eyes, Lily's eyes, would shine again with life and light.
He accepted the tissues, tears still trickling down his cheeks, and politely turned away to blow his nose.
Severus began to feel something he hadn't felt in years, desperation.
He could hear music coming from inside the house, so he took a deep breath of cool night air tinted with Draco's cologne, then leaned back. "We should get in."
"You may be the only person who can prevent me from committing murder today and you want to quibble about introductions?"
Draco accepted it, then blushed as Harry lifted the delicate fingers to his lips and kissed the air above them lightly.
Settling the blond on another couch, he transfigured as many blankets as he could, then he began rubbing the blond man's limbs firmly, trying to bring some warmth into the cold flesh.
Ron looked at Harry and he saw a bright terror in his friends blue eyes as the words sank in.
Piper huffed, "He said he didn't need to hunt for Wyatt and disappeared into the basement. I don't know why Paige insists he stay here."
Draco nodded in agreement and pressed his mouth against Harry's, driving his pierced tongue into Harry's mouth. The sensation of cold metal against hot flesh made the Gryffindor groan and Draco smiled into the kiss.
"Is fine. You however, are not. You could have died. If Draco wasn't there, you wouldn't be here."
Paige sat down on the couch next to Draco. "Care to tell me what that was about?"
Paige shook her head, getting down on the floor to help Spike sit upright, "Yeah, sorry, it was an accident, I swear."
Tugging a sleeve over his scarred hand, Harry made his way to his own favorite seat, the low padded stool in the corner tucked next to, practically under, the heavy mahogany desk. After a childhood spent in a cupboard under the stairs, some things had stuck and in times of intense stress Harry had to fight the urge to crawl into a dark space and wait for the noise to stop.
Harry took a deep breath, and forced a smile, "Of course we'll be fine. It's only a scratch after all. Once Ron wakes up he'll tell us it was only a scratch and probably be mad we made him drink some vile potion for no purpose."
Paige smiled, "I'm going to find Chris, and he's going to lead me to Draco."
He managed to slip in the door behind Severus and Paige just before it closed and the wards reset. He stood in the darkened doorway, the cloak over his body, as the others took seats around Severus's always burning fire.
The red head snorted softly, "Better hope the Ferret has, mate. If he's still out there, he's drowned by now."
Perching on the edge of the desk, Spike waved Severus back to the chair he had abandoned, and motioned Chris out of the corner.
Paige saw Severus roll his eyes and say, "He is in labor."
The first again, "Celebration? Hardly. I would bet he has gotten into the wine."
Eventually she felt someone guiding her hands free and she looked up to see Severus leading a red headed young man into her position. He locked hands with Blaise who looked elated to see him, though the red head's other hand with tightly entwined with a dark-haired boy.
Ron's bellow startled Harry out of his contemplation of the dancer. He did seem so familiar.
Draco shot them a dirty look, and concentrating fiercely, orbed out leaving the gooey mess to fall on the stone floor of the cave.
Blaise nodded from his seat on the other side of the desk, well out of range of any drunken hexes.
Harry nodded, but the man didn't look up from the folder.
Overcome with the power of the moment Harry wrapped one arm around Ron and the other around Draco, pulling the two of them into a massive hug. The two boys looked at each other, shrugged, and put their free arm around each other, turning the whole thing into a massive group hug.
Harry turned sharply. "Of course it is. I mean, come on Malfoy. It was practically inevitable." By the end of his statements he heard himself shouting and broke off, feeling his cheeks grow redder with embarrassment.
"I'll get it," Paige said. But Blaise's grip was too tight and Phoebe jumped up and rushed out of the room.
Draco nodded and took the bag he had prepared with the gifts and some food. Wrapping the bearskin robe around himself, he made his way to the hidden corridor Pomphrey had discovered months before, and without looking back he ran.
"Ah, yes. Well. Dragon."
Not in an overly sentimental way. There would be no childish infatuation, a partner without fault, an angelic representation of all that was good and right with the world. Severus was himself beyond such expectations and assumed any woman fool enough to love him would be so as well.
He had some messages for Ron and Blaise from friends and family and a gift for Paige from Severus stowed in his backpack as he made his way to the apparition point for the States.
On the other end of the mirror, a fog cleared, revealing Ginny Weasley who looked more exhausted than he had ever seen her. When she realized who she was talking to, she started.
"I need to talk to you about something serious, Shannon," he said, and she settled down, her wide grin struggling to become something more businesslike.
"We're clear," Piper barked.
Piper took the jug out of her hands and poured the last ounces of juice into a tall glass before handing the empty carton back. "Well, if you don't want it, I'll finish it," she said, sipping at the cool liquid.
The woman looked shocked. "How did you know? Did Draco tell you about me"
Moving towards the door, Draco looked over his shoulder, "You don't need me. You can do this on your own. I've always known that, and you should know it too."
At this, Spike smirked and opened his mouth to speak before Chris cut him off, "None of this explains what you are doing in my family's house right now."
Chris shot a glance at Severus, but the man said nothing. Sighing heavily and running a hand through his already touseled hair, Chris said, "He was… Well, I guess tortured. Severus told me it was some kind of pain curse, these wizards had him trapped in a cave-"
With the cocky sneer that had become so familiar over the years, he said, "Besides, I'll be watching you, Potter. So don't muck it up."
The youngest witch orbed home. With Leo away on some kind of Elder quest and Chris locked up in the attic searching for what turned Wyatt evil, Paige felt alone in the house. Phoebe was in China with Jason, and Piper had gone on another date with Fireman Greg, leaving Wyatt with Darryl and Sheila.
Alex stood, "You can start by cleaning up here. I can tell you don't want to dance and you're a few years younger than I'd like to have tending bar. Can you push a mop?"
"Ah Severus," the king said, "I had a fearsome dream. My beloved came back to me. She was so close, Severus." The king reached out one arm towards the open air, not seeing a shadow pass the advisor's face.
Harry looked at him and Draco shrank back against the fiery look in his vivid green eyes. "You shut up. I'm not letting you die."
It was the first time Harry had ever used an Unforgiveable. Cruciatis. And he didn't know how to stop it. His heart was full of hate and fear and panic and even with Neville, healthy and now-safe Neville, at his side, Harry couldn't stop.
The room exploded.
"It's heartburn," Blaise said. "Oh the miracle of child-bearing." He tried to smile, but Draco could see him wince and he stood up and walked over to join Paige.
Severus reached out to his god son and grabbed the twitching fingers, "Draco?"
"Well, that's hardly behavior fit for a Head Boy. I think Dumbledore should speak to him."
She locked eyes with Spike before they both turned and ran into the kitchen, the vampire leaping over the couch easily.
This day had been like any other. Classes were cancelled long ago when the school stopped acting like a school and became a fortress, so Severus spent much of his time in his lab. Healing potions and anti-nausea draughts for Zabini, as he was still complaining of morning, noon, and night sickness; when he wasn't begging for news of Weasley and the rest.
It was one thing to fall in love with your childhood nemesis, and quite another to find out that the boy was your guardian angel.
As soon as it was secure, Severus opened his mouth to speak, but before he had the chance the vampire cut him off.
Full disclosure, I am reading this along with you guys for the first time in absolute years. I like to think I have grown as a writer but there is some charm in this
Paige heard the question, but underneath that was a more desperate request.
With that the work began. There were guests from all over the country so there were more rooms to prepare, and large meals served every day so Draco spent hours at the spit.
His attention now split between Harry and the weapon, Draco forced himself to focus on the weapon, trusting Harry to take care of himself. Taking advantage of the confusion, somehow Harry had tackled the Dark Lord and even now was punching Voldemort in the face, Draco crept along the wall of the tent until he was next to the weapon.
Walking away she saw Harry standing in the doorway looking confused.
Harry flushed, "I have no idea what you're talking about."
He reached out carefully and took the tiny bundle gently, cradling it like the precious burden that it was. He looked up at Paige and she saw the thin edges of fear and shock and joy around his eyes so she guided him to the large rocking chair in the corner. "Why don't you sit here for a while and bond?"
"So he has the potion on hand?"
Eyes half lidded, still Draco's gaze cut through the black-haired boy. "I'm strong Harry. Are you strong? Was this worth it?"
Several hours later an exhausted Draco Malfoy staggered out of his Head Boy's room. The Slytherin dorm's common room was filled with Harry's friends just waiting for the unveiling, and at the sight of the bedraggled blond they held their collective breaths.
Draco froze in place. Why were the Elders there? In his arms Harry moaned and Draco could not fight back a grin. He was alive!
Draco's voice came slowly, each word falling into the pool of silence that was the stone-walled dungeon room.
"Half dead."
Harry made his way to one of the vantage points. He needed to get a look at the battlefield before he charged out. Maybe it wasn't the Gryffindor way, but if it kept Harry alive for a little bit longer he would take it.
"I so desire," Draco said, and pulled Harry into a kiss that held all of the love and potential he held in his heart
"Harry? Is that you? What's wro- Is it Ron? Is he alright? We're so sor-"
Cursing old bones as his knees popped, Severus lowered himself onto the floor next to the boy and wrapped an arm around Harry's shoulders. The two of them sat there in silence for hours before Harry finally broke, throwing the blanket off and pushing himself into Severus's arms until hoarse sobs could be muffled by the thick fabric of his robes.
Ron piled his plate high, as he had every other morning, and as usual, Harry marveled that not only would his friend be able to eat it, but that he managed to balance it all, precarious piles of sausages on top of eggs, buttressed with pastries, and supported by crumpled pancakes. Syrup and tomato sauce were added in strategic locations and the red-head bent his head once, reverently, before he began to eat.
"What happened?"
Paige Matthews locked the back door as she stepped out into the night. P3 was doing brisk business again, and in the interests of 'security' Piper made a schedule for the three Charmed Ones to take turns guarding the club from supernatural events.
Piper's morning sickness faded after about six weeks and she insisted on taking the opportunity to get out of the house and get some fresh air, so she planned a massive family trip to the zoo. This would be Jamie's first trip out of the house since his birth, Ron being very protective of his fiance and son. Draco begged off and Phoebe had to work but Paige was ready and willing to play proud auntie to Jamie and Wyatt.
"Dammit Harry. You were going to do it again. You were going to run away and never talk to me again without giving me the chance to finish a thought. This," the blond said, gesturing to the space between Harry and him, "This is what we can't do anymore. These stupid misunderstandings. It took us too long to get together the first time, years. And then one misheard comment broke it all up again, and now you were going to run away without letting me explain?"
He and Harry were a item now, or at least, Draco thought they were. They hadn't really discussed anything so concrete in the few hours they spent together before Harry and the others returned to Hogwarts.
Harry grinned. "Then you will have to come the next two days, and if this is only the beginning you must become more beautiful." Playfully wincing, Harry said, "I wonder if my eyes will be able to survive such loveliness."
, in the tight grip and found himself facing Malfoy. Placing his hands, freshly buffed fingernails painted a deep indigo, around the blonds' waist, Harry peered through his artfully messy bangs at the other boy.
"Get up. They are going to kill each other down there!"
Hers seemed sharp in comparison when she replied, "No, we were just talking."
Hermione nodded, her lips in a thin line. "You're going alone."
Harry jumped as he felt a cool hand settle on his shoulder. He turned to see Draco staring off at the end of the hall. Harry followed his gaze and saw a strange red light covering the far wall. The red glow grew brighter and larger and as a fierce blow to the wards shook the floor beneath them, Harry felt his stomach drop to his feet.
He made the soup again that night, more at the prince's request than any need of his presence as many of the sick staff members had recovered enough to return to work.
"I think I've been in love with him for a long time. I want to spend the rest of my life with him, but I wonder exactly how long that would be."
"But do you really want to be here when she realizes why you refused to 'hunt' for Wyatt? She can make things explode. With her mind."
Centuries after their deaths, and the deaths of their friends and family, when all events had been consigned to legends and dusty history books, students still claimed they saw the ghosts of two young men, one blond and one black-haired, swaying gently in each other's arms.
The older man snorted, "Honestly, Draco. You have the worst taste in men."
Harry felt a shudder go through Draco's body before the other boy gently let go of the abused ear and pressed a soft damp kiss to the appendage.
Gathering his robes around himself Lucius rushed back into his chambers and through the castle until he found himself at the garden gate. Beyond he saw the blond figure moving back and forth in the flourishing plants and he stepped in slowly, so as not to startle the apparition.
Severus let out an actual laugh at that. Brushing Paige's fingers off of the album he opened it to another familiar page.
The dark haired man groaned and slumped in his seat and Paige looked away from her growing pile of orange peel to see him rubbing fitfully at his eyes. Setting the orange down, she looked at him.
Phoebe and Paige shared a long look. They had kept the reality of demons away from the brunet to protect him. According to Severus a male pregnancy was more complicated than a female one, especially in the later months, and Blaise was eight and a half months along and looked it. They had been treading on eggshells for weeks trying not to upset the petite brunet.
And she was staring at his mouth.
"Well, his hair did end up very shiny and smooth, and the color seemed a lot brighter as well," Chris added, also smiling.
Draco nodded silently again. He had always prided himself on his quick wit, but there were no words for he moment. As he moved into Harry for another of those kisses he saw Pansy and Blaise shaking hands with Ron and Hermione before the four left the classroom and closed the door quietly behind them.
Merlin, please wake up. You were right, you weathered the storm. You won. Now please wake up. I owe you a dance, you have to wake up.
On the day of the first ball tragedy struck in the kitchen. Half of the staff fell sick from tainted food they purchased from a peddler. That left the head chef, Remus Lupin, enraged and cursing all peddlers and feckless workers who couldn't even be trusted to prepare their own meals. Draco watched the man round up footmen and maids and everyone he could get his hands on, and the blond was half-convinced he would have brought in Hagrid if the man only fit through the door.
"You've just agreed to be our inside man here, mate."
Harry no longer visited Severus's quarters in the evenings, though the potion's master heard about the toll of the war o Harry. According to the House Elves he wasn't eating or sleeping. The Gryffindor had become more short-tempered, speaking out in anger when he deigned to speak at all, and that concerned Severus more because Harry had always been pleasant and garrulous.
Paige didn't buy it, but didn't feel like fighting it. The kid didn't look evil, not that that meant anything anymore, but she got a familiar vibe from him. He was hiding something, the way Chris had when he first showed up, but he was there to help.
Draco took the opportunity, trusting Harry to watch his back and returning his attention to the machine.
Then the nurses and maids rushed into the room sweeping Lucius outside. He tried to get back into the room, but the door has been barred and through the thick wood all he could hear were his wife's cries of pain, until they were broken by a child's wail and then, silence.
Harry looked up from their joined hands and met Draco's gaze. The blond's grey eyes were swirling with fear and worry and a fierce determination.
"This- these are for everyone," he said, tossing the knapsack he head been wearing to her. She caught it as he said, "I have to go," and with a loud crack, he was gone.
Then Phoebe jumped in, a greenish tint on her face, "Fifteen?"
Harry smiled, but it was a weak and bitter twist of the lip. "The last person to call me 'boy' wouldn't let me eat."
Now more than ever he knew he had to destroy that thing. Not only was Voldemort using the weapon to destroy Hogwarts and all those it contained, he was killing his own Marked, and one of those was Severus. Paige's ward would only protect the man for so long, Harry had to get to that weapon and shut it down, destroy it if possible.
And so his new career began. A large storage closet by the kitchens was cleared out and Draco took it as his own, building a bed out of old blankets and cushions. He slept in complete warmth and comfort for the first time in a year.
Since then, the enthusiastic hugs had become a reminder to him that physical power did not always mean physical violence; and also that someone cared about him, which was a new, but pleasant, sensation.
Harry knew Ginny was still talking, but he hadn't heard anything after 'Malfoy.'
The man returned to his chair, next to the blond Slytherin, and Shannon looked at them both, a twisted smile on her face.
Draco opened his mouth to speak, but before he had the chance another scream sounded, tinged with panic and Harry was through the now-splintered doorway.
"A cave? What? And the cruciatis, why didn't you tell me, Severus?"
Draco pressed himself closer to the machine and closed his eyes tight.
"Can I not stay here," Draco asked, his harsh voice a breathy growl.
The man smiled, and that smile seemed familiar, but Snape knew he'd never seen such a soft expression on Lucius's alabaster face.
"I would rather you not use that name, Severus."
This was the more than familiar speech Draco had been expecting from Chris. To hear it from Piper, and for no reason, was more than he wanted to deal with.
Paige gently pulled his hand away. "I healed it for you when you came out of the room. Severus and I came to get you, he knew—or, rather, he thought that this would end badly, and I guess he was right."
I did enjoy writing this.  I hope the folks who have clicked here are enjoying reading it
She squeezed her eyes shut and clenched her teeth as she felt her stomach rising in her throat.
"It was pouring bloody cats and dogs out there."
"How did you get these?"
As the boy dabbed water on Ron's head, he turned the boy over so Harry could see the livid scratches on the freckled skin.
"No bear would jump from a tree like that. It's a wood elf or something."
The sound of Severus clearing his throat cut the white lighter off.
Slowly Paige opened her eyes and turned, leaning against Severus's sturdy form as her knees hadn't solidified yet. She met the laughing gaze of Spike and saw another man grinning behind him.
Wide windows let sunlight flood into the room, which looked very different under the bright light. Harry was relieved that it didn't look as seedy as it had appeared last night in his nightmares.
"Neither did I," Harry said, his eyes now returned to Creevey's body on the cot.
"I thought not. But still, Severus, you were my trusted friend and now you betray me?"
"Draco, can you get out of there? The baby is sitting right on my bladde—"
Harry yawned widely and looked for an empty spot on the table in front of him so he could put his head down. Another night of intricate and confusing dreams had left him half-asleep as he staggered through his morning ablutions and down to the Great Hall. All he wanted was to go back to bed.
Draco smiled. "Despite appearances it went well. I believe the phrase is 'you should see the other guy.' We took out the demons and got some solid information."
The boy sputtered a moment before sighing. "Look, Phoebe went to work and Piper had to take Wyatt on a play date. Chris is out researching again, and quite frankly I didn't want to be left alone with them when they get all snappy." The boy mustered up a few tears, and even though Paige was sure it was only for effect she turned to look at Draco and Severus who were now determinedly looking everywhere but at each other, Blaise, or Paige.
This time it was Draco's turn to clear his throat and his eyes slowly regained their former clarity, "We were in the Infirmary, and I was upset. Paige and Chris heard me and came. They couldn't help you at Hogwarts, so we brought you to San Francisco. Blaise insisted on coming along and he was so upset I didn't want to leave him behind.
"Did you go down there to check on him," Chris asked.
"Sna-ape," the pregnant brunette whined, "I'm sick again. And I think my breasts are starting to hurt." The word 'breasts' had been whispered as though the two men had an audience in Severus's shadowy lab.
Harry clenched his eyes shut and clenched his jaw. He didn't want to hear those words again. He was so intent on trying not to hear that he missed whatever the blond said; only hearing Draco's last words.
His fists now clenched at his sides as his chest heaved, the green eyed boy said, "I never wanted a lifetime with you either, you nasty little bastard," before turning and walking away, leaving the blond in tears on the floor.
Draco let Harry secure the seatbelt around him and looked out the window as they pulled out of the parking lot and drove away.
The sound was harsh, grating to Harry's ears already ringing from the sound of explosions and endless screams, and in the moment, he wanted to kill the man for that alone.
As his body relaxed he felt someone rubbing his back in gentle circles. He raised his head to see who it was, but then Blaise screamed again and he dropped it back down, focusing on the pattern of the carpet.
Harry's voice broke into the gloom and Severus, startled, turned sharply to see the Gryffindor standing in the shadowed doorway.
"Are you guys okay," she asked.
"Broken ribs," Harry said. The blond nodded, his glazed eyes clearing quickly.
"Well really Harry, would you want to see Neville naked?" The Know-It-All tone came from behind them. Harry couldn't look. He'd seen a lot of crazy things in his time, but
And so it was that the war with the kingdom of Gryffindor began, for had it not been their doctor, doctor to the king and queen of that far off golden land that told the Queen she would die? The doctors, so wise, could have saved her and did not.
Harry watched the other boy slowly unbutton his shirt, hands heavy and slow from the alcohol, and his fingers itched to help.
Draco reappeared with Phoebe in his arms and Paige saw her sister push the blond away before joining them at the couch.
Severus suspected that the short Slytherin had more lascivious things in mind, but he didn't care to think about it too much and refused to take any pictures that might even remotely be deemed suggestive.
For years Severus Snape had gone without he presence of another human being in his life. He had hi students, and his colleagues, and his godson, but all of them had to be kept at a safe distance form his hidden life of spying and treachery.
Ten minutes later it had faded to only the occasional snort and Harry was relieved, the blond boy looked better, more relaxed.
Draco tilted his head back, feeling it brush the wall as he stared at the framed pictures that lined the hallway. There were generation of generation of Halliwell women and men, and a few snapshots of Severus, and Draco and Blaise. There was even a sketch of Spike, as vampires didn't take well to flash photography.
The fire was burning brightly and with no further excuse to stay in the room Draco moved towards the door.
"I was wondering when we would meet again, Mister Potter."
Completely unafraid, Draco kept still. And as Harry muttered something the pain in his mouth faded along with the swelling until the piercing was completely healed.
When she pulled away, she took a moment to adjust his sweater and trousers, running an awkward hand over his hair then walked back to her desk and the blond man who had been watching their interaction.
And everything went still.
Then he turned and Severus got his first good look at the brunette.
"Ronald Bilious Weasley. I am not stripping."
Finally someone pushed their way through the milling crowd and Paige smiled when she saw Severus, wrapped in robes the style of the ones he had been wearing when she first met him, stalk toward them.
Harry gritted his teeth, and turned back to his friend, "Neville doesn't mind because Neville gets to keep his clothes on."
Draco found himself swept up in an exuberant hug.
"Mate!"
Harry looked at her silently for a moment before nodding. "I'll think about it, okay? I can't make any promises, the war doesn't allow for much of a personal life."
The blond's voice was full of anger and hurt, and as he finished speaking all of the strength seemed to come out of him and Draco crumpled back to the rug, burying his face in his hands.
Severus stepped forward again and took Harry's arm. To his surprise the boy didn't fight back and Severus led Harry to his quarters, and to the couch. Pressing a glass of brandy in his hand, Severus too ka seat next to the silent and shivering boy.
"Harry? Harry!"
The dour and dark-haired advisor flushed lightly. "In truth Lucius, Draco is the image of his mother, with her sweet spirit and quick wit. The resemblance is quite remarkable to see."
' Harry said, "I need to show you exactly how much I appreciate all of this."
Draco leaned closer to Harry, "Do you want to try it out?"
Another healing draught, another sleeping potion, another poison. When Severus was young and he made his decision to focus on potions, he actually believed the words the professors said, that he could stopper death or bottle glory. (look this up and find the actual speech.)
Paige rolled her eyes. "Yes, Phoebe, because I'm so ruled by my hormones that I don't care about everything else that's going on now. I don't care that you're hurt, or Draco is having seizures, or my nephew is out who knows where doing who knows what. It's all about sex. Sex, sex, se—"
Harry looked from the hand to the man and raised an eyebrow in his best impression of Snape, before standing without assistance. "Sorry, Tom. Hate to be rude, but I want to set a good example for Miss. Death Eater over here," he said, waving at the woman who moved forward sharply, her hands clawed, before stopping at a gesture of Voldemort's. "Doesn't do to accept help from the enemy, does it?"
As she went on, listing every fault and error the blond had made since his arrival at the Halliwell house, Draco could feel the air of rage and frustration wafting off of the petite brunette, and it was making him dizzy, even as his chest ached.
Harry might be out there himself, with the right partner, but that chance had been stolen from him months ago.
Beyond the air was cool and redolent of old garbage.
Harry saw Severus open his mouth, but before he had the chance to say anything Blaise cut in.
Looking up at the tattooed man, Draco smirked and twisted his hips slightly, just enough to give Harry a teasing taste of friction without satisfaction. The Gryffindor's grip tightened and Draco saw the clerk flush.
Ginny's mouth dropped open and she visibly forced herself to calm down, "The potion? How did you get it?"
At first Draco pretended it was fine, that he never watched for the owls bearing messages, or stayed by the magic mirror for hours around the time he and Harry used to talk, but Paige could see right through him and so could everyone else.
"Is that you, my Bearskin? Are you my wood elf?"
The boy looked away from the cots lining the infirmary wall and focused on Severus. "Yes?"
The two men winced at the harsh croaking sound of Draco's voice, but no more than Draco did. Had it been that long since he'd spoken?
The pictures of his Hogwarts years were sparse. It was difficult to make the camera work near the school and well nigh impossible inside it, but he had managed to get some of his professors and classmates out onto the grounds so he could capture their image, even if he had to use subterfuge at times.
Harry followed him and his eyes narrowed as he saw the blond punch a strange brunet in the arm. The man laughed and wrapped his arm around Draco's shoulders, turning towards Harry.
Severus sounded enraged. Draco had never heard the man so angry. Irritation as common, but not this disgusted rage. Desperate to know what had so overset the man he considered an uncle, Draco stayed in he shadows of the hall, out of sight.
"On the floor everyone, now!"
"Any better, mate?"
"How did he know you were hurt?"
There were a series of knobs on the side of the device. Two of them were just under a large gauge that seemed to be measuring something, and the third was separate, with no descriptive marks around it.
She walked around the bed and rubbed Draco's shoulder lightly, leaning in to whisper something in his ear.
Harry tried to laugh, but it fell flat. "Oh, you know. Same old, same old. Death Eater torture is the same no matter where they go, I think it's in the handbook."
Paige sighed. "Do you want to come with me? The zoo is pretty cool, lots of fascinating creatures and odd smells." She used her best wheedling tone, but Draco only laughed, the lines of tension in his face easing away.
Draco sighed, "So he's why I'm here? My new charge?"
Startled at this, Piper spoke up, "And what are you going to do?"
"—Eaters. We're loyal, he knows that."
"Well, the only naked Slytherin you've seen is me. Imagine Crabbe or Goyle swinging past you on the way to the loo."
"I'm going to go see how Ron and the bab-."
Paige nodded. "I know exactly how you feel, my friend. It is not a pleasant sight and I was much closer to it than you were." She made a quick decision and nodded at the cup. "Care to join me in something a little stronger? We'll toast to the new baby and try to wash the horror away at the same time."
Piper rolled her eyes, "I've done nothing but call for him, and Phoebe's in the attic right now."
He didn't want to get too far away, he knew it was a delicate time for the baby and Blaise, but he couldn't stay there. He had cried in front of too many people already.
Harry stepped back, away from those words.
Harry was finishing up at The Meat Market, giving the floor a quick mop before leaving when he heard someone banging at the back door.
"You know what, Elisa can help you," the man said before walking into the back of the tattoo parlor.
He'd been here before and it had ended badly for him.
Harry took one and popped it in his mouth, enjoying the taste of lemon, pepper, and shrimp over the savory earthiness of the mushroom.
"Draco couldn't help him."
"May I have it back, Severus? I believe I have a rather sentimental attachment to it," the king said and Draco smiled under the deep shadow of his hood.
His voice had deepened into a man's round tones over the years, then grew harsher from shouting over the sounds of battle, but now it squeaked as it hadn't since he was the age Draco appeared now.
Draco felt cool hands holding his hair away from his face as he retched. If he could have taken a clear breath, he would have thanked whoever it was, even if they were the most disgusting, slavering, horrible demon the Charmed Ones had ever fought.
Draco's feet were surprisingly steady under him, though he could still feel the drain on his magic from all the healing he had done. He would be able to continue, though he wasn't sure for how much longer before he collapsed.
He wanted more of that feeling.
He was a werewolf.
The blond man, Spike, raised a scarred eyebrow and said, "I think the better question is how you know me? I'm a dab hand with faces and I think I'd remember seeing a boy as pretty as you before."
Chris grinned, mumbling, "Thanks Auntie Paige," before escaping to the stereo.
When he spoke, Spike's voice was a rumbling purr, "Anything you can tell us about a pretty boy with an interesting scar, love?"
Draco pushed him harder, slapping at his cheek lightly, and Harry didn't respond, but his head rolled a bit and Draco caught a glimpse of his eyes. They were rolled far back into his head, the whites the only thing visible.
Severus opened the door slowly, not sure what he would find on the other side, and he was thankful he did so as something heavy hit the sturdy surface before crashing to the floor.
Watching the undead Slytherin boy take his own seat on the floor, Harry had a million questions running through his mind, but the only one to make it to his lips and out was the harshest.
"I know who you are kid. And I know what you're doing here. It's hard to trick a guy like me."
Severus relaxed his grip. "I never thought I would live through this fight-"
Harry leaned in, letting Draco take a hot breath of his cinnamon scented shampoo and conditioner, and the sandalwood and orange cologne he had applied.
A half hour later the three of them were sitting around the low kitchen table. Paige had a sandwich, Chris was nursing a glass of water, and Spike was making obscene gestures with the contents of the fruit bow—
Paige sat back on her heels as Draco moved to the edge of the bed. Harry took a seat next to the blond.
The other man nodded.
The red head turned away from a blown glass swizzle stick shaped like a snake and walked over. "Ginny said he was doing well. Pretty far along but healthy, why?"
Paige still found the idea of a pregnant boy odd, but she had a bright yellow teddy bear with a green ribbon around its neck hidden in her closet for the baby shower her sisters were planning to throw and at least three ideas for names, none of which started with 'P.'
His eyes were dead.
"Severus? Am I home?"
She had taken shifts on and off during the week, whenever Draco was too tired to put up any real fight. Severus didn't move at all, or make a sound. It had been frightening at first, like she was watching over a dead man, but Draco insisted that was the way Severus had always slept.
In fact, he'd been waiting for just that for weeks, as every day the Charmed Ones seemed to get more bothered by his silence, his aloofness, his presence, and he could feel the weight of their hearts on his back.
It hadn't helped.
Draco looked up, eyes focused over tear-stained cheeks, "Chris? You're here? Paige?"
Spike hissed at the brunette boy, cutting him off. "I don't want to talk about that fat bloody wanke—"
Both men sat in silence.
Together the group made their way back to his quarters and Severus offered both of them a seat as he settled on his wingback chair, wondering at how much had happened in one evening.
Draco saw Severus's lip curl and jumped in to cut off any sarcastic comments. "I think there's something wrong with Blaise. He's in pain but he's pretending to be okay."
"You're a mess, Potter," Draco said. "But then again, so am I. I think, if we're patient with each other, this could work out."
"You know about it," Paige asked.
The light came and went quickly and Paige saw the man stand as he guided her up. Together they presented the baby to Blaise and he began to cry, taking the infant and pressing it to his chest.
Severus saw his godson grin and Harry's eyes glisten as both boys nodded.
All of the attention as focused on a small group in the middle of the room and as Severus approached he saw a trace of red hair.
"Well I'm not sure, but I bet I could find it my Magical Creatures texts." Blaise shook his head. "Now stop distracting me. Why is Draco hurt? Where are Severus and Spike? Why were we attacked?"
Choking black smoke flowed out of the doorway, and Severus could hear muffled coughs inside. Brandishing his wand, he dissipated as much smoke as he could, while the Weasley girl rattled on beside him.
And all around surrounded by a soft warmth.
Harry felt his mouth drop open. Not the most advisable action in this sort of club, but he couldn't help himself. He watched Ron's smirk turn into a full on grin.
"Blaise stop," Ron said from the doorway. The red head's face was flushed with laughter, but Draco could feel his cheeks reddening from other emotions. "Poor Jamie won't have to bother with this for more than a few years yet, and right now poor Draco looks like he might spontaneously burst into flame."
"Yeah," Spike said, "Talking about yo- Ow! Sodding hell, woman."
Raising an eyebrow at the two, Draco said, "I know Spike is happy because you two were on your way to see his boyfriend—"
The woman, Paige, smiled, "He's okay. My sister Piper practically adopted him."
This role left him wide open to endless attacks of teen age angst, but it didn't allow for the one opportunity Severus had been waiting his entire adult life for.
A few moments later, and glass in hand, he returned to his seat and faced the now visibly upset Harry. "Perhaps I should. Perhaps that is my role, that of supportive mentor now that Dumbledore is dead. But I find I do not have the energy for it. I cannot give you reassurances or predictions because I do not know what will happen. No one does. Your friend Hermione has consulted the seers available, hasn't she?" Harry nodded his head. "And what has she found?"
"Hey. Knock it off," Paige said, snatching the innocent banana to safety before slapping Spike's hand.
With that she put her empty plate in the sink and made her way up to bed, as the two men stared after her with questions in their eyes…
The Slytherin boy took a deep breath and continued, "I never hated you, Harry. As weak an excuse as it is, I acted as I had been raised to act towards the muggleborns, but I… liked you. Still do, for whatever that's worth now."
A few tingling seconds later the blond pulled away with a grin. "There, all better."
"Sorry about that. I wanted to let them know where we were going. With a family this size it's a necessity, you know."
I suppose I assumed the chapter date updated automatically but it does not so ... learned something new today. This is chapter 34. I have 40 total written and at least 2 more that would be needed aftrr that to finish this story. If you're reading and (I hope) enjoying. I could use a little motivation to finish
Torn between laughter and pity for the confused boys and ignoring his friends questioning looks, Harry got up and left the hall.
The boy was quiet, but tense, not tense in that pre-battle sense, or in the post-battle way either. it felt very much as if Harry was expecting something and as Severus looked into the green eyes, he knew.
"Harry, get up!"
"Actually, it's curry," Piper said, ladling a hearty serving of the thick stew into a bowl and setting it in front of Draco with some warm pita bread.
In that picture she didn't know that he would betray her. Hell, he didn't know. They were just children in school.
"Half white lighter" Paige replied. "My father was the white lighter and my mother was his charge."
"He's upset," Severus said, but Hermione just snorted. "We know that. What is he upset about?"
Harry made his way over to the wall and slid down, settling cross-legged on the floor. The early morning battle stretching for hours, the confrontation with Voldemort, and now this, and as nervous as he was for Draco's condition, he fell asleep against the comfortingly cool stone, never even noticing as he was settled into a cot of his own, a thick blanket in Hufflepuff colors laid gently on top of him.
Draco felt a blush touch his cheeks and was thankful for the lack of light in the hallway. "I know I- I mean, I care for Harry, but still…"
Two hours into the card game and Harry's eyes were drifting shut. The wine and Firewhisky had flown freely and he'd enjoyed enough alcohol to loosen his tongue.
He slipped into a noxious sleep until he felt a warm calloused hand against his shoulder. Startled he pulled away, backing into the door. Opening eyes he didn't realize he has closed, Draco saw his nurse looking down on him.
When the room was empty Draco stood up again on trembling legs and walked back to his room. The door closed by itself, and inside the bedroom an invisible presence revealed itself to the blond.
Severus winced again as the castle shook and Harry heard a distant explosion.
Harry sighed heavily and Paige felt tempted to do the same, but she resisted. "That doesn't mean we can't be happy. It doesn't mean we can't fall in love and get married and have children. I mean, just look at Ron. He's in love, engaged, and now they have that beautiful baby boy."
Blaise took a deep breath, "Harry needed help, a potion. Ron got scratched by some werewolf and Sev developed a potion that could prevent the change if the victim got it early enough. But he was in his rooms and we didn't want to disturb him, and I've watched Sev make the potion for months now so I thought I could help."
The first fight after they came back where Harry had blood on his hands, where school boy hexes weren't enough, had happened only days after their return from California .
A young man in a flannel shirt and blue jeans was closing the office door. Harry took the chance that he worked at the establishment, maybe as day janitor or something.
The moment was broken as the blond grinned sheepishly and called into the house. "Knock it off, Chris. You couldn't handle my ass anyway." Draco smiled at Harry again, a bright pink blush covering his cheeks before he turned and went into the house.
"Werewolf attack." Neville's even voice came from behind Harry. The brunette turned to see his friend walk out of the bathroom, a dripping washcloth in his hand.
"Severus? What is it? What is happening?"
Still there was some good to come from it. The volume and pitch of the alarm meant that strong magic was being used nearby. Severus's wand led the three men to a small park, an in the park a cave. Red light streamed from the mouth of the cave and weak screams could be heard within.
Not the best news to a man hidden in a dark lab, well out of the line of fire. Snape knew that the soldiers, his students, on the front lines would die, had known it his entire teaching career, but it didn't make the reality any easier to bear.
Now Paige watched Piper and Phoebe circled the low bed, discussing various potions that were good for burns and chemical poisoning and consulting the ingredients list Draco had provided.
"Do you need some help, Harry?"
Severus could hear some conversation coming from the main room of the club, so he stood to close the door and noticed some of the thick splinters of wood on the floor were shape of table legs.
The same sad light was in Severus's eyes as he looked up at her and Paige took a seat beside him. Running her fingers over his where they pressed into the cover of the album, she said, "Who is she?"
"Not so fast, Mister," Paige said, cutting him off. "We have some questions for you. And you'd better have some answers."
