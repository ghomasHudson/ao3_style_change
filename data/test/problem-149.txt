"We were having sex!" Harry burst out with a grin. "Weren't we!" He tugged unceremoniously at Draco's hands. He had gone a very interesting pink colour.
"Get some sleep, double potions tomorrow." Malfoy yawned, flipping the sheets to cover Harry. The gesture felt so intimate it made him smile.
"I'm sorry mate but as much as I love you you're not crashing our date. Not that you're not my type." He raised his eyebrows and winked at Ron who made a puking noise. "But that I am disinclined to share Draco."
"So let me get this straight, or not straight apparently, Harry passed out because having sex with you was
The wards at the manor only allowed him to make it just outside the gates which were open slightly. Without thinking he raced up the long driveway towards the door and knocked hard.
"Mmm no he isn't up to something." Harry replied, only half listening, choosing to focus more intently on Malfoy. He watched him wrap skinny fingers around a goblet of what he assumed was water, Malfoy didn't like Pumpkin juice after all.
Saturday morning saw Harry waiting expectantly on the common room sofa in a similar outfit to the one he wore to their Hogsmeade date, although, he'd switched the beige trousers for a pair of brown courderoy ones and the black tshirt for a white one.
' they were doing 'good Auror bad Auror' today then, a standard interrogation technique of theirs. Harry knew how this game was played. Hermione as the ruthless interrogator and Ron as...Ron. The chicken drumstick was really selling his image.
The healer coughed lightly, he was also now very red in the face. "I assume the two of you are aware of the Legilimency bond between you, would that be a correct assumption? And you know who cast it?" Harry shook his head but Draco looked up to interrupt.
He felt extremely paranoid throughout the rest of the three hour Transfiguration class as he snuck a few quick sniffs at Malfoy's jumper. He relaised that the smell was indeed very Malfoy-esque and very overwhelming. It smelt good though. He wondered why he never noticed it before. His thoughts were interrupted, of course.
Malfoy simply smirked and pulled Harry closer to him until their chests almost touched. Harry wondered if Malfoy could feel the raw heat emanating from his body. They continued to dance until the gramophone stopped abruptly at the end of the song. A ripple of applause sounded from the rest of the eighth years as well as McGonagall.
Once inside the Hog's Head Harry paid for drinks as promised, despite the fact that Malfoy had come into a good 160 million galleons in inheritance money on his eighteenth birthday. (Harry was slightly ashamed he knew that, although he could never be criticised for not paying attention to The Prophet whenever Malfoy was mentioned.)
McGonagall stepped forward into the center of the room and gestured for the eighth years to stand back against the walls. Harry noticed Malfoy against the opposite wall sandwiched in between Parkinson and Zabini who appeared to be having a conversation over his head, well trying to anyway, Parkison was about 5"4 after all and all attempts to communicate
Ok so I did some sneaky things right, so "Gedankenleser" pretty much translates to mind reader in German. Think that's it for the sneaky things.
and denied food, eventually he had managed to shake it off and had gotten his own back with a particularly long and painful
"No you can't Potter, you have never once told a convincing lie, admit it." He'd not moved from the position before and was staring down at Harry with those stupid gray eyes and that stupid smug smirky look.
"Right thank you Mr Malfoy. From our tests we have deemed that Mr Potter received an influx of overwhelming thoughts, emotions and physical sensation from something the two of you were doing." The man paused and looked between their joined hands before colouring. "Ah I see." He mumbled quickly.
Harry breezed through breakfast ignoring the usual perverted and brainless chatter of the Gryffindor table, Harry was unsure that any other house talked about sex at the breakfast table as much as the Gryffindors did. After hearing one too many sausage related innuendos Harry left breakfast and made his way with Ron and Hermione to Transfiguration.
Harry frowned and tugged at Draco's arms again. "I's ok, don' be sorry." He gurgled. "You didn' know. If you wan' to make i' up to me though you can take me back to that hotel roo-"
Harry found himself blushing at the innuendo but chose to ignore it. Malfoy knew bloody well that he was not rubbing
Harry nodded and supported the back of Malfoys head with his head. He pushed the sticky white hair away from his forehead relishing in how soft it was even when it was sweaty and bloody. How the fuck was his hair
“Only as a classmate, I was a Hufflepuff too but he was in a different group of friends. I wish I had been friendlier with him. I’m sorry, I’ll move away from that now, you're doing great Draco." She spoke quickly, avoiding eye contact and sniffing before looking up again. "Do you have much knowledge of previous Triwizard tournaments?"
' in any historic documentation it means that they were inarguably and indefinitely shagging." He huffed, folding his arms across his chest and leaning back into his chair.
"Harry! Are you feeling better now?" She asked, lifting her head up from her book and slowly propping herself onto her elbows as not to disrupt Ron.
Malfoy cried out again and shook his head. The tears were still steaming down his face and dripping into his clasped hands.
By the time Herbology finished and dinner rolled around Harry was starving. Whether it was the interrupted breakfast, the missed lunch or the constant stress of trying to avoid questions about his jumper, he was bloody famished.
Weasley went from red to white in a heartbeat. Draco found that he was enjoying the whole charade rather too much but decided to lay off and wait for Granger rather than push Weasley to do something stupid and reckless,
was your option number two." The words elicitic a low growl from Pansy which Draco reminded himself to be terrified of shortly after he stopped being monumentally pissed off at the situation and himself for being stupid enough to turn his back on his dinner with Pansy next to him, again.
"Yes well I am a liar with a flair for the dramatics, I thought we'd established that?" He drawled. Harry kicked him again.
After a minute of shuffling it seemed that most of the couples were in place. Hermione have him a shy smile from her position opposite and Harry grimaced back.
Harry looked up to meet Malfoy's eyes, shadowed behind his mask. He had a gentle smile on his face and gave a supportive squeeze to Harry's hand. Harry gave a weak smile back.
Harry felt his cheeks grow hot. "You're trying to tell me to take him to the ball too?" He asked incredulously.
Harry grinned. I love cake, you'll have to take me sometime." He elbowed Malfoy lightly who gently pushed him back.
Harry was surprised that getting ready had taken him more than the usual ten minutes and made it down to the common room at ten to nine. Most of the other students were still in bed but a few had already left whilst others milled about in the common room in their pyjamas. Harry relaxed on the sofa as he waited for Malfoy. Ron had grunted something horrific that sounded suspiciously like 'don't come back limping' as he popped out of the room briefly to scan for Hermione.
And a book so old and worn through that the lettering of the title and author had faded. He recognised a few of the others from defence lessons. He also noticed the Gretel Gedankenleser journal amongst the mess.
"We just went to the Room of Requirement because I was cold." Harry said. He took a deep breath; "andthenwecuddleduptotheronthesofaunderablanket."
Harry shrugged. He hadn't really thought much about it since that day in the library and that was over a week ago. "I'm not sure. I guess we'll keep it until it wears off, if it doesn't and we want it gone then we brew the potion."
Malfoy jumped slightly at the contact but eventually settled down. Harry moved from stroking to pressing the pads of his thumbs into the firm skin where Malfoy's foot met his ankle, in between the tendons.
"Then that's why you wanted him locked away? You thanked me for it during your trial." Harry whispered.
Harry kicked him. "What was it like in my head?" Was that stupid question? Did it feel different in someone else's head or was Malfoy just going to laugh at him?
"What's so funny?" Malfoy frowned, a small smile tugged at his lips which he fought hard to keep down.
The next few days ran smoothly as far days at Hogwarts were concerned. Monday's lessons were filled with silent written work rather than practical, including potions oddly enough and Tuesday's lessons barely had any content in them at all as the castle was prepared for the ball. Eventually the professors gave up multitasking and cancelled all lessons after lunch on Tuesday for students to get ready.
The bustle in the Slytherin common room hushed immediately as Draco entered before the whole room burst into cheers and applause. Daphne Greengrass and her sister kissed Draco on the cheek along with most of the other Slytherin girls and Theodore Nott. Greg had congratulated him although he was perplexed by what was going on and quickly turned to Millie for an explanation. Blaise had slapped his arse so hard he left a handprint and Pansy had ignored him for not telling her he had entered. Draco had decided that it was probably for the best; he couldn't deal with Pansy fawning over him like the rest of his house were. She was busy anyway, scowling in the corner with Zaff, a seventh-year Slytherin girl who had also entered the tournament and appeared to be bonding with Pansy over their shared disdain for Draco.
"I'll stop if you keep that up. I'm not bloody rubbing your feet while you keep being filthy, and i'm not rubbing your dick as a favour." He growled.
"Right I don't stalk him. Ok maybe I did stalk him but only because he was up to something in case you don't remember. And no I'm not dating him Mione for fucks sake. I'm not gay am I."
"Don't you dare fucking aplogise for that, the way they treated you was disgusting. That's not how a child should be treated." He could feel the rage bubbling in the pit of his stomach.
He was still angrily ranting in his head about Slughorn and desperately fixing his tie as he and Ron pelted towards the Transfiguration classroom, tripping over almost every single stair on the way. The bloody castle was out to get him now too.
(Universe:163738299 - Harry: 0). He opened the door slowly knowing full well who to expect behind it although hoping that perhaps for once the universe could waver in it's unbearable predictability.
"Mione! He'll have my bollocks for breakfast if he finds out you know!" He cried. She really was the brightest witch of her age if she figured that one out.
"Fuck ok thank Merlin!" Harry stuttered as he began casting. He sighed shakily as he watched the skin of Malfoy's abdomen knit itself back together. His breathing started to steady and he stopped trembling after a minute or so. Harry cast a few more times until the wounds were completely closed. Shakily, he used the water on the floor to wash away the remaining blood from Malfoy's torso and chest. He then then used the water to clean the tear tracks, blood and dirt from his face. Raking the rough pads of his thumbs over Malfoy's soft cheeks.
Malfoy looked up with a start, a quizzical look quickly settled on his features. Reluctantly he held up the parchment to show a soft, charcoal drawing. It was the classroom they were in however all the other students we blurry and faded into the background, the center of the picture showed Harry himself, chewing on his lip and staring off into the distance with intense precision and detail.
Malfoy let out a light snort next to him. "Oh don't tell me the Golden boy, saviour of the wizarding world and Witch Weekly's most eligible batchelor is a blushing virgin." He cooed.
Harry found himself smiling at the snarky reply. He shoved the rest of his clothes on rather unceremoniously, making sure to pick up the correctly sized jumper this time, and made his way down to breakfast.
"Would the court recognise that, as of my last question, Mr Malfoy attempted to resist the Veritaserum. Mr Malfoy what was the motivation behind using your ability during the war?"
"Good evening Granger you look lovely. Evening Weasley, I would say you looked lovely too but I don't quite fancy being hexed." Malfoy drawled with a hint of a smile.
Draco leaned in to brush a swift kiss to Harry's lips before removing his fingers. Harry ached at the loss. Draco spread his legs impossibly wider before slicking his cock with the remainder of the oil and lining himself up with Harry's entrance. Harry nearly cried out as he felt the blunt head of Draco's cock brush his hole before slowly pressing in, Harry gripped Draco's arm tightly and squeezed his eyes shut as Draco bottomed out.
"Prat. Can I go into your mind?" Harry asked. It was only fair wasn't it? If Malfoy saw his so he should see Malfoy's.
So I know this chapter should've have been out way sooner but my hayfever really dkared up today and was defo not in s state to write.
Harry felt relief was over his body from Ron's acceptance along with a new sense of dread. "So what does this mean?"
Sitting by the fire, Ron and Harry traded stories of their various kidnappings (twice in one week seemed excessive and unlucky even by Harry's standards) and whilst Harry informed Ron that he'd gotten a snog out of it Ron had been given an ultimatum of finishing all assigned homework before he was allowed in the same room as Hermione which Harry thought was fairly ingenious. He was infinitely glad that it didn't involve any strange sex punishments.
voice. It had a different presence. Similar to how the Basilisk had sounded but much more like Snape when had attempted to teach Harry to resist
Harry shivered and realised then that he still had his jumper with him which would go a little way to keep out the bone chilling cold of the castle although he'd left his robes upstairs. He felt almost instantly better as he pulled the jumper on over his head.
Ginny had speared yet another sausage on her fork and was waving it under Harry's nose rather suggestively before Hermione finally decided enough.
covered with treacle. He kissed back slowly as Draco backed him into the counter top. Harry's hands moved to Draco's waist and he let himself be pulled in closer, hips pinning Harry's to the counter behind him. Draco's hands tangled themselves in Harry's hair, he tugged gently forcing Harry's head to tilt further back so he could deepen the kiss. They were filthy, and sticky, covered in flour and other ingredients and they were both far too hot and sweaty and yet Harry felt as if it was a perfect moment that he never wanted to end.
to move. The girl pressed impossibly closer, Harry could've sworn that she was trying to share his bloody skin with him.
" Oh I'm sure you have. Badly, like a blundering moron!" Malfoy jabbed his finger into Harry's chest again and Harry lost it.
The morning restarted fairly typically with both Harry and Ron rolling out of bed at five to eight as both of their wands set off alarms. The two of them proceeded to fumble around rushing to get changed into yesterdays shirts in order to make it down to the common room to meet Hermione, who, as usual, was already dressed and waiting for them with an intimidating cluster of books firmly pressed to her chest for 'light reading' she'd said.
"Malfoy's." She said rather boastfully as she raised an eyebrow. "You always stare at him and you used to stalk him. Seamus even has a bet about you two. You were also with him all morning. Almost seems like you're dating him wouldn't you say?"
"Well I'm fairly certain that this means that you're gay and are finally realising your long term crush on Draco Malfoy. I'm happy you've worked it out with minimal help mate. Come on let's get breakfast." Ron glided out of the room with a pat on the back leaving Harry feeling even more confused than before he'd bloody well asked.
"What do you mean? Smell like what? What are you talking about?" He glared at Nott. Perhaps he shouldn't be glaring he thought to himself. He could still hear Malfoy's snarky comment about his temper.
Silence fell again as Harry reached under his pillow to grope blindly around for his wand. He cast a
Malfoy flashed a smile. "Wasn't a bad thing, feels nice actually. Who knew Prince Potty has magic hands."
The voice was getting clearer. Harry snorted lightly at the string of curses flying through his head. Strong language was not an uncommon occurrence as of late,
"I need to go!" He sputtered and pegged it from the hall hoping that he had made the right move here.
Nott was grinning at him now and looked like he was going to burst out laughing. "I'm not going to ask why you're wearing Draco's jumper but considering how flustered you are Harry, I assume it was an accident. The scent is blatantly his though and that is very obviously not your jumper."
“I didn’t want anyone to stop me, I s’pose,” Draco answered, ignoring the fact that Blaise had called him ‘little potato’ in favour of sneaking another look at Pansy; who was standing with Millie, Daphne, Astoria, Zaff and Eden; who appeared to be a good friend of the younger two girls and was shamelessly sporting her Gryffindor robes as if it weren’t a violation for her to be in their common room to begin with. The group were looking murderous and ranting excessively with flailing hands. Zaff caught Draco’s eye and scowled before nudging Pansy with her elbow, setting the five girls into further fits of unnecessary rage as if Draco’s very presence offended them, which he didn’t consider too far from the apparent truth.
Soon the interview with Vidal was concluded and Oline scampered off to the room with Lydia. Draco found himself slightly concerned for Lydia's wellbeing with the overbearing Durmstrang girl but reminded himself to calm down. He offered a similar spiel of information about himself to Vidal. Who, in turn, had told him that his family were Spanish although he had lived in Portugal from a very young age before moving to France to attend Beauxbatons since there was no wizarding institution in Spain. Much like Oline, he showed a particular interest in the Beauxbatons girls and proudly informed Draco that he'd shagged his way through his year group already, which didn't sound like it should be voiced as an achievement and yet he wore it like an Order of Merlin award nevertheless.
Harry laughed and nodded and made his way to the chair next to Malfoy's bed, he began casting various cleaning charms and drying spells and spells for stains at his school uniform and was eventually greeted with a somewhat presentable looking uniform once again.
Almost instantly Malfoy began to move and Harry found himself, once again, swept up in their ease and coordination.
McGonagall had informed them that the dress code for the ball was muggle formal wear with wizarding outer wear meaning cloaks or open robes. Two years ago this would've been an odd choice but after the war muggle clothing had become increasingly popular especially in pureblood circles. Harry found that he quite liked the mesh between the crisp lines of suits matched with the billowing cloaks and robes.
It was nearly two hours before Malfoy woke up again. In that time both Ron and Hermione had checked in on the two of them when Harry had failed to make it back from the toilet and then never turned up Defence afterwards. Professor McGonagall had also been called down to ask a questions about what happened. All Harry could supply was that it was Zacharias Smith with diffindo in the bathroom. He'd laughed at the Cluedo reference despite the situation which had got him an odd look from McGonagall and Ron, Hermione, however, had caught it.
Harry looked up to see Malfoy grinning at him from the sofas in front of the fireplace. He was sat with a few other eighth years. Theo and Daphne were cuddled up in an armchair opposite him, Neville was sat on the floor leaning on Zabini who was on the sofa next to Malfoy and Parkinson sat directly in front of the fire painting her nails this time rather than Malfoy's. Harry smiled back.
what this was about. Harry almost laughed if it weren't for the fact that he was deeply disturbed that this was going to have to be about his sex like, or lack thereof.
"I know how to use it to access your mind, I only did it once though by accident. Wasn't much going on in there." Malfoy said thoughtfully.
"I'M NOT FUCKING PLAYING GAMES MALFOY!" Harry screamed, banging his fist on the table next to him in Hope's of scaring Malfoy off however, he only moved closer to tower over Harry.
Harry started gently, stroking his hands along the arches of Malfoy's bony feet they were bloody cold, he was sat next to a fire why were they bloody cold?
"I AM A GREAT LIAR!" Harry shouted, shoving Malfoy backwards. He was surprised it had taken this long for Malfoy to elicit an outburst from him but he was not going to deal with Malfoy and Hermione criticising him 10 minutes apart.
"Er I still see a string." Harry answered. The string was easily visible after Malfoy had mentioned it although he assumed he needed to figure out what else he was supposed to see on his own. So this string was a connection into Malfoy's head? Maybe he just needed to follow the string or maybe- "Oh it's a tunnel!" He exclaimed suddenly.
but I don't want to end up transfiguring the gum under the tables into new quills again because you made us late. That was a fucking nightmare last time!" Ron was red in the face with the exertion of trying to wake up Harry. He was half shouting half babbling as he fumbled around the room trying to find his bag and books. It reminded Harry of earlier that morning and he laughed at the Déjà vu. They were always this horribly disorganised after waking up but even so it was a rarity to see it twice in one day.
? He'd never really considered that he should feel bad for Malfoy but he should've done. He should've considered it. In his mind he was a kid yet somehow he had never considered that Malfoy was in the same boat.
"Oh bloody hell Potter, come here." He sighed, grabbing Harry by the wrist and surging forward. He pulled Harry up three more flights of stairs before he eventually let go outside the entrance to the Room of Requirement. He paced the doorway three times and, when the door eventually appeared, pulled a very confused looking Harry inside.
Potter high enough to grab him from the air and wrap Potter's legs around his waist. Predictably, the dead weight of Potter's body winded him when he cancelled the spell. Potter was much heavier than Draco had originally thought although that was more than understandable from his dinner habits, it was like somebody had cast an undetectable extension charm on his stomach.
like you're going to do it because it's unsettling." Harry had quickly accepted that this was not something that Malfoy was going to make bloody easy for him. It was like he had made some kind of sodding blood pact from birth in which he promised to spend his existence making things very difficult for Harry.
The eighth years stumbled back to the common room at quater to one, giddy from punch and dancing. Harry bidded Malfoy, Zabini, Parkinson and Hermione goodnight and made his way up to his room with Ron in tow. He fell asleep that night dreaming of Malfoy's arms around his waist.
Hermione nodded but didn't return to her book. "I'm sorry for teasing you at dinner Harry, what you're going through Is obviously very stressful but I didn't realise at the time." She flashed him a half smile. "Besides, I've figured it out now." She grinned properly this time.
“Exactly like Ernie Macmillan,” Draco confirmed. He was glad someone else shared his hatred for Macmillan with no conceivable reason.
Also I apologise but chapters in Draco's POV will probably always be shorter just becuase I prefer writing from Harry's POV more, we share the same angry, oblivious, dumbass energy so it's only fitting. :)
?" Hermione giggled again and this time it was Harry who swatted at her. The three of them dissolved into fits of giggles that wouldn't sound out of place coming from the mouths of twelve year old girls discussing their crushes.
"Same reason he wanted you at Grimmauld place the summer before fifth year, because Sirius was family for both of us. He loved you, you know that? He called you 'Petit cerf' means 'little deer'. Talked about you the whole time I was there." Malfoy was whispering again.
His sentiment was quickly confirmed as Malfoy rolled his eyes and scowled at him. "Potter you really think I would've voluntarily called you down here if I knew what was going on? Because if I
"Bout bloody time you insufferable ponce." She snapped. "Enjoy this Potter, he's a bloody nightmare." He half smiled at Pansy and made his way over the fire place and plonked himself down. He mirrored the position he'd seen Pansy in, pulling Malfoy's legs onto his own.
Ron gulped and fumbled for the newspaper tucked into his bag. He handed it over to Harry, not making eye contact.
"Um well the thing is-" Harry tried, however his assailant was not only unfairly strong-willed and unfairly loud but also unfairly capable of making somebody feel unfairly uncomfortable in the hallways at
McGonagall clasped his hands in hers and smiled gently at him as he met her at the far end of the hall. "I know you are doing this because you believe you have something you need to prove, but you need to promise to keep yourself safe. You are allowed to survive and you are not dispensable. I will be here for you if you need to talk." She said firmly, fixing Draco with a stern, yet concerned gaze.
Nott laughed at him quietly. "Don't you stress. I doubt anyone else will realise. Well maybe just Pansy, jealousy makes people perceptive."
Harry snorted again before he was interrupted. "What the bloody hell was that?" Ron burst out. He looked beyond confused, Hermione looked equally confused and had latched onto Ron's arm and was slowly rubbing his back as if he had gone into some kind of shock. He did
"No Professor that's quite alright, my apologies I didn't sleep well." He grumbled. He knew she meant well, she was one of many teachers he had been surprised hadn't shunned him upon his return although he suspected that as teachers they understood students from abusive homes who were coerced into action by less than morally upstanding pureblood families. He couldn't be the only one surely.
Definitely not the Basilisk unless it had come back from the dead and was studying for it's N.E.W.T.S.
, was lurking behind a wardrobe. "Congrats man!" He grinned, showing white teeth with a gap in the center and speaking with a thick accent that Draco swiftly determined was Portuguese rather than Spanish from his fluency in both languages.
"Thanks but I have a date." Harry snapped, she had managed to push her thigh very deliberately against his groin and that had done enough to ensure Harry that this really wasn't a situation he wanted to be in, not with this girl. He grabbed her shoulders and pulled her off of him before pegging it at full speed down the corridor.
He decided not to answer. Although tried subtly to scour the room for the blond. He was sat right in the back corner with Blaise who had his left sleeve rolled up to his elbow and was letting Malfoy draw on his arm with the quill. He didn't even look up to address Harry.
As she finished speaking footsteps were heard coming down the corridor and a man made his way into the room. Draco recognised him immediately as one of the Weasleys, the one that was head boy when Draco had been in his third year. He was wearing a three-piece, black pinstripe suit with a sage shirt and black tie and looked surprisingly professional for a Weasel.
"Bullshit were you minding your own business. Never, in seven years of knowing you, Harry James Potter, have you ever
The two of them jostled each other the entire walk back to the castle, giggling and stuffing their faces with sweets as they went.
Draco pulled a face. "Potter I was under Veritaserum, try as I might, and I'm sure you saw, could barely resist it let alone lie." He said shakily.
Both of them dissolved into fits of laughter, this was the most ridiculous situation Harry had ever been for the sheer improbability of it. Malfoy was fucking weird.
"So it would be correct to say that your motivation for saving Mr Potters life was not solely due to the fact that you wished fo Mr Potter to vanquish You-Know-Who?"
The curses were still going strong as he stumbled in through the door, a few choice words slipped out as he tripped the step. The common room was mostly empty, he spotted Hermione and Ron curled up together on the sofa, Ron appeared to be asleep whist Hermione was reading.
The ministry was quiet when the trio got there. Clearly the Prophet hadn't been tipped off that the Malfoy trial was today, Harry had expected it to be swarming. The three of them made their way to the cafeteria to await the trial.
Harry snorted at this which earned him a very confused look from Ron who had only returned half of his attention to his eggs, favouring instead to watch the bizare, wordless exchange between Harry and Malfoy.
thought he was weird. He wasn't even sure why he had offered. He found he didn't really like knowing that Malfoy was in pain but a foot massage? Really?
The Great Hall fell eerily silent after McGonagall's speech had ended; concluding the Halloween feast and marking the official onset of the 1998 Triwizard Tournament. The department for International Magical Cooperation had decided, after many months of heated conferences and public debates (and the unfortunate stress-induced combustion of one of the governors on the board), to re-host the Tournament at Hogwarts as a futile attempt to atone for the disaster of the previous one. Since Potter and co had won the war and Voldemort was no longer a necromantic pain in the arse, it seemed as good a time as any to bring Wizarding Europe together as one and completely distract from the mistakes of the Ministry with a little barely-of-age, quadrennial, ritual sacrifice.
By the time he made it back to the common room Granger and the Weasel had vanished presumably to Granger's room where the castration would be taking place. Draco snorted at himself and made the short walk to the Room Of Requirement stopping only a few times when Potter nearly slipped from his arms. He conjured the same room as after their date on Sunday and slipped inside.
“So what are the others like then?” Blaise asked, shouldering Draco lightly to disrupt him from the existential state he was slowly slipping into as he pondered his own mortality. “Vidal is...nice.” He added, winking.
She smiled brightly as she turned back towards Harry. "Of course you can dear but do us all a favour and clean yourself up first first."
It took him a few minutes to realise that it was far to big for him, the sleeves were a good four inches too long and it went down almost to his knees. He desperately tried to tuck the jumper into his trousers to hide the ridiculous length and cuffed the sleeves three times before they sat comfortably at his wrist.
Eventually they turned off from the busy road and crossed through a park which lead to a quiet alcove of the city, a cobbled square. Wrought iron tables and chairs decorated the the square and a stone fountain sat in the middle depicting a small, goblin-like creature spitting water. There was a few shops and restaurants surrounding the space, each with a different style of outdoor seating giving the whole place a mismatched yet oddly uniform look. Most of the buildings were covered with ivy and Harry understood why Draco had chosen to work here. It felt more like Paris than London.
"Come on, we need to get you to Pomfrey ok? You've lost so much blood but I need you to walk can you do that for me?" Harry asked softly trying his best to support the dead weight of Malfoy's body.
Draco sighed. He really couldn't be bothered with this, he just needed a shower and a wank and then a bloody long sleep. "Fine Pans I'll tell you but only because I have better things to do than lie here and prove my point. I cuddled him on the sofa. That's it."
He hadn't heard much from Malfoy since Sunday evening having sat together in the common room and recounted stories of how each of them had been been kidnapped by their idiot friends who wanted a full run down of their Hogsmeade date. However, they hadn't spoken much after that as the theory-only classes hadn't been able to rouse much conversation from Malfoy considering he was as bad as Hermione with a book in his hand. Any attempt to communicate with Malfoy on Tuesday evening had followed in a similar fashion since the pompous git clearly couldn't multitask getting ready with talking to Harry and eventually he had given up.
"Good for you mate. She'll love that!" Harry grinned encouragingly enough to quell Ron's anxious pacing. "Look can I ask you something?"
"Hmm among other things." Draco didn't dare say that the majority of his hatred for his father came from the fact that he had wanted Potter dead and Draco had disagreed. Potter didn't need to know that after all. Draco's father had given up hitting him or firing hexes and unforgivables at him after a particularly cruel two ay punishment where Draco had been
"Why did you start painting your nails?" Harry asked suddenly. The presence of Malfoy's arms around his waist had made him think of it.
He threw all his bags on the bed along with the robes and jumpers and decided that, much like Ron, he deserved a nap. Crawling under the warm blankets and duvet he fell asleep almost instantly.
Aplogies for being a sappy bastard but I'm a sucker for eighth year Drarry going to the ball and it felt like a personal insult to myself not to include it.
Harry leant forward over the bed and cast the same series of cleaning and drying charms on Malfoy's hair and clothes and then repaired the shirt which was was tattered from spell damage and Harry's clumsy fingers.
Malfoy just laughed. They continued on like that for another thirty minutes, somewhere during that time Malfoy had gone into a sort of dozy state which Harry was happy for. It meant he didn't have to listen to the git.
Firmly, Malfoy took his waist and hand as Harry's arm found it's way around his neck. They stood like that for what seemed like an eternity but was more likely to be a few seconds.
Malfoy nodded again and yawned. He pushed his chin forward to rest on Harry's shoulder. Being inside Malfoy's headspace elicited a level of calm in him that he had never experienced.
"I see." He said stepping back and moving across the classroom to the door. "You know that you really do have a terrible temper don't you?" He spoke shakily, attempting to look down his nose at Harry.
"McGonagall is right you know, you two dance so beautifully together." She whispered with a small smile.
Harry hadn't had a chance to talk to Malfoy, not properly anyway, about any of the legilimency stuff since the day before and he was becoming increasingly worried that the two of them may not find a solution without the help of Hermione who, had surprising sworn off getting involved in favour of making Malfoy and Harry work together.
rather that Harry. She busied herself with a book and rested her head in Ron's lap. Harry didn't care enough to ask what he was supposed to be figuring out and instead decided to wander off to the common room.
"Are you aware that by using your ability to protect Mr Potter you directly defied He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and everything he stood for?"
Ron caught Harry's eyes as he glanced across the Great Hall to watch the Slytherin table "Let me guess: You think he's up to something." Ron jibed, elbowing Harry sharply.
Harry awoke to a light tapping against the window next to his bed. Cautiously he padded over. A small, tawny owl was perched on the window sil, it couldn't have been much bigger than the palm of Harry's hand and yet it carried with it an official Ministry letter over double its size.
Malfoy rolled his eyes again and shook his head as if he was hoping it would dislodge the pink flush of his cheeks. No use. He returned back to his drawing and Harry tried to refocus on his charms work although if course it was no use.
Confident in his decision, Harry tore into his living room to fire call Hermione. He had expected some resistance from his best friends although Hermione had agreed with him. Malfoy didn't deserve Azkaban. Surprisingly even Ron had agreed.
Harry stared at Malfoy gaping in question. Was this a normal thing for ex-rivals-turned-friend-crush-and-occasional-bed-and-dance-companions to do? He wasn't sure he would ever understand the blond git.
regarding Slughorn. He'd been thinking the same thing as he struggled to finish writing the four foot essay on the properties of each individual ingredient used to brew a Polyjuice Potion the night before. Not that it bloody well mattered what the properties
When Harry awoke it was to a stark white ceiling and the overwhelming odour of medicinal potions. His head felt fuzzy like he was drunk and he didn't seem to have much control of his body.
"Mr Malfoy." The wiry man growled moving closer to where he was sat. "Why, despite the fact that you were in danger of torture or death from Voldemort for protecting Mr Harry James Potter, did you actively chose to use your ability to protect him and save his life?"
"Oline Amboise." McGonagall's austere, authoritative voice rang out, shattering the silence as she snatched the parchment from the air. There was a ripple of chatter and scattered, yet fervent applause as a petite, stocky girl pushed away from the wall. She tousled her tangle of black curls, shoving them away from her face before turning to beam at the rest of the Durmstrang students. One of the boys who looked startlingly similar; with the same disheveled black hair, tanned skin, and gold eyes, stepped forward to embrace her in a rough hug before pushing her towards McGonagall. Oline’s long fur coat trailed behind her, sweeping the flagstones as she strutted toward the headmistress, waving intermittently at the applauding students around her. McGonagall shook her hand and gestured to the small doorway in the corner of the hall, indicating to the Durmstrang girl to exit through it. Oline turned to wave one more time before disappearing through the doorway.
Before long Oline’s interview was also concluded and the three champions reunited in the room with Lydia loitering in the doorway fixing her notes. A man with the same dusty lavender hair descended the steps soon after. Draco recognised him to be the photographer; Myrion Lafant, Lydia's brother. He had been in Slytherin and was a year younger than his sister. Draco thought he had recognised her surname when she was introduced but, for reasons beyond him, hadn’t made the connection between ‘Lafant’ and purple hair.
Once inside Malfoy had started taking short, raspy breaths again and Harry could feel his eyelashes blinking against the sensitive skin of his neck. "Hey you're ok we're in the hospital wing now. I've got you." He lay Malfoy on one of the beds and darted to the portrait door leading to Madame Pomfreys quarters.
The elves bustled around fetching dinner for the two of them at Malfoy's request and they were ushered to a low table in the corner of the room.
His fingers scraped against the hard, sharp metal of the latches as Harry pried them open and flipped the lid of his trunk up.
Harry snorted which made Malfoy smile. He'd turned around on the sofa and was resting his arms and head on the back.
"No need you inside me please." Harry gabbled as the amounting pleasure threatened to make him come in his pants. Draco just grunted as he removed his pants. Harry felt his mouth go dry as he took in the sight in front of him. Draco's pale cock stood out painful hard from the thick, white curls at his groin, he fisted cock loosely and stroked himself slowly as Harry removed his own pants.
Malfoy smirked again. "My my Potter get your head out of the gutter. I merely meant my other joints, but if you're offering..."
"Parabéns, Vidal." He answered stiffly in congratulations, offering the same polite nod to the other boy despite his growing reluctance to civility. He found that he didn't trust Vidal. Something about the overbearing cheer he exuded was painfully off-putting to Draco, but then again he didn't particularly trust anyone; sunny disposition or not. He felt the same way about that bloody twit Ernie Macmillan, far too happy for his own good and fucking infuriating.
Draco followed the door to a dank, sweaty corridor that seemed to bleed the foul smell of decaying plant matter. He must be partially underground now since it smelt similar to the dungeons. He could still hear the ringing of applause behind him as he made his way to the room at the end of the corridor.
Draco snapped his eyes up to meet Harry's. His face wore the same hopeful smile as it had whilst they were dancing.
Bravely, Harry opened his eyes to see a very furious looking Draco Malfoy standing over him with his arms folded across his chest. Quickly he relaised that he was, in fact, not in the bed he remembered blacking out in and was, instead, on a very comfy leather sofa, covered with a thick fur blanket.
was going to rip his testicles off and feed them to his owl, probably half for punishment and half because he was a sadistic bastard.
"More." Harry croaked as the feeling became more pleasant. Draco obliged by pressing another oiled finger into his opening. He waited for the burning to subside again before he retracted his fingers and pushed them in again. It wasn't the most pleasant feeling in the world and Harry had half a mind to stop him entirely before he brushed a spot that made Harry cry out.
Malfoy thought for a moment. "You can go into my headspace, that's what I did with you anyway. There won't be any memories and you won't hear my thoughts but you can go. If you'd like."
After finishing up he curled up in the chair and focused on the slow rise and fall of Malfoys chest, not wanting to go back to class and leave him here.
Malfoy screwed up his face in a feigned disgust "Now? I dont think the house elves would appreciate it, Mon coeur."
“You know we wouldn’t have, right?” Theo added, frowning slightly at the comment and picking at the frayed edging of the musty wallpaper before fixing Draco with the unimpressed gaze he was slowly becoming accustomed to.
"Well, you've been voluntarily working with Malfoy so I guessed there was a problem that you both needed to fix, you have been jumpy all day so I assumed it was because something was distracting you which I guessed would be Malfoy since you're working together. He came over to our table at breakfast but didn't say anything and then you left so, by my deductions, it's some kind of mental connection and considering there has been no potions mishaps I guessed legilimency." She finished speaking and laughed at the dumbfounded look on Harry's face.
"Mr Malfoy!" A sharp voice cut into his head and he found himself hurtling out of Potters min and memories and back into the Arithmancy classroom.
"No I got it mixed up with mine you cock." He snapped batting Malfoy's hand away and trying desperately not to think about the proximity or the smell of Malfoy around him. It hit him in that moment just how tall Malfoy was. His head just about reached Malfoys shoulder height.
Oh Merlins bollocks he was in for it now. "Oh um." Harry stuttered. "We agreed to uh meet, to study, y'know he's helping me with potions. We're um partners." He gabbled, avoiding Hermione's scrutinising gaze and really hoping he could convince Malfoy to partner with him in potions without having to
Malfoy was already waiting inside, leant against a desk with his legs crossed at the ankles and arms folded. Harry cast a quick
Malfoy nodded his head against Harry's shoulder. Allowing his body to go slightly rigid as he attempted to stand on his own.
"Sirius did it for me one evening. I liked it." He spoke quietly, his breath ticking Harry's neck. He found that he enjoyed the feeling.
They went quiet after that. The two of them drifting in and out of sleep, lulled under by the warmth of the room, eachother and the steadiness of deep breathing. Harry was the first to move after several hours had gone by and the heavy sound of footsteps outside signified that it was dinner time. The two of them walked groggily, still bumping into one another, to the Great Hall where they separated and headed to their house tables.
an early start, he wanted to roll out of bed ten minutes before breakfast and muddle his way through the morning, like usual. His face unfolded from the deep frown into a look of reluctant amusement as he realised the strong hypocrisy of his second request. The voice was clearly a bad influence on him.
I know Draco's POV chapters are always shorter but sometimes I feel like they're necessary for story progression even though they dont actively progress the plot they kinda give  way for me to Express more than Harry's dumbass opinions which is nice.
"It was a fairly common spell amongst academics in Gretles time and much earlier, owls were were far more expensive and required rigorous training and many lower class researchers were not connected to the floo network. It was far more practical to communicate via a legilimency bond." He finished, eyeing Harry warily although he looked somewhat relieved that he had managed to finish speaking without any further distractions.
The common room was bustling less than an hour later. Ron was still asleep when Harry woke up, yet Hermione had obviously woken and was back to reading the old, leather tome from earlier that morning. A few eighth years were also hanging around the common room, Daphne Greengrass and Theodore Nott were snuggled together, backs to the fire and Dean and Seamus were playing, what was a very painful to watch game, of chess. The only surprise was that Malfoy was sat in front of the fire with Pansy Parkinson painting his nails a shiny, Slytherin green.
"Ok well considering the two of you know who the caster is we can give Mr Potter a potions to reverse the inhebriation and you may leave. Mr Potter, St Mungos will require you to either learn Occlumency or have the bond removed by the caster, is that clear?"
Harry, face still crumpled into a frown, slid down further in his chair, bringing his elbows to rest on the table. "So first off you meant to tell me that we've been cursed without our knowledge and you're not freaking out in the slightest and secondly it was only used by academics? For what, sharing research?"
She chucked at him and tapped his forearm. "No need to be so formal Draco, your manners are impeccable but unnecessary here. I am well though thank you." She turned slightly from Draco and brought her eyes down to Harry. "Don't tell me that's who I think it is."
Eventually the over enthusiastic references to the 'Golden Knob' (Seamus' brilliant idea of course) died down and Harry was able to join in Hermione and Ron's conversation about the eighth year trip to Hogsmeade the following day. Nev and Ernie had invited all the returning eighth years, surprisingly even the Slytherins, for the monthly trip. Harry had debated about going and decided he would make the decision later.
are this board of governors?” Draco spoke up. He wasn’t about to be shafted for being an ex-death eater. He knew that despite the fact that the trials were over and he had been cleared of all charges as a result of Potter’s testimony, there were
Draco nodded at him and smiled again. Harry's breath caught in his throat as he watched the purple firefight dance across his face. He looked ethereal again.
Harry nudged Hermione next to him and whispered in her ear. She turned to look at Malfoy's nails. 'Cute' she mouthed at him 'Cute'. Harry agreed nodding.
"Don't mention it." Harry sighed. He didn't do anything except cast the spell after all. Malfoy had pretty much healed himself. He wouldn't have known what to do without the connection between them.
However, he was now stood, in his room, in a towel, staring at the ensemble lying on his bed and feeling the familiar ache of dread curl in his stomach. Bloody castle and it's bloody balls! He was going to have to dance, in front of the whole school,
This chapter contains depictions and descriptions of past child abuse/mistreatment. It's not graphic but please be warned that it is there.
He had dived straight into the food as it appeared at the Gryffindor table although it couldn't distract him from the look Hermione was giving him. He could see how desperately she wanted to ask him something. She had that look where it seemed as if she was physically attempting to keep the words in her mouth and Harry thought she might actually explode.
Malfoy's frown relaxed and he stretched one long, milky white leg from under the blanket, flexing his toes. He laced his fingers together and pushed them forward until they clicked, rolling his shoulders forward. The quiet pop of bones made Harry shiver "No that does make sense Potter. I was consciously projecting thoughts into my head because I was stressed. I was actively thinking, honestly it's like you don't even pay attention in defense, kill one dark lord and you know think you know everything."
"You look so hot like this." He breathed. He leaned forward to kiss Harry again as he pulled out and thrust back in. Harry thought that he could probably die right now and be entirely happy that he was lucky enough to muddle his way into this situation to begin with. The burning feeling of being stretched open did nothing to null the unparalleled pleasure Harry felt as Draco's cock brushed his prostate on every thrust. Draco sped up the movement of his hips, kissing Harry furiously. The two of them were sweating and panting heavily as they moved in tandem on the bed.
"Draco you won't tell me otherwise and I have no access to Veritaserum at the present. This was the next best option." She sounded agitated.
"Actually sir I know who cast it, shortly after I informed my friends I was here with Harry and the accident that happened, one of my friends admitted to casting it as part of a dare. She wasn't aware of the consequences." The four in the room turned to look at Draco. "I'm sorry Harry I didn't know."
Most of the students were in the Great Hall already by the time the trio made it downstairs, with a few stragglers hanging around the entrance for their partners or for the best opportunity to make a quick getaway.
Flitwick beamed. "Right you are Mr Potter, 3 points to Gryffindor." Flitwick turned his attention from Harry and began talking to the rest of the class.
Harry shot up. Malfoy was right of course, when was he not. (Not that Harry would admit it to his face or anything, it would do awful things to his ego.) Harry looked across the room, Ron had obviously gone already, the bloody traitor, since the bed next to him and the bathroom were both empty. Harry swore inwardly.
Lydia giggled lightly, clearing catching the expression of intense dread that momentarily penetrated his patented ‘Malfoy Mask’. "Well thank you Draco, I could listen to you talk all day but unfortunately I have to interview the others." She pulled a stupid face and laughed.
"Fuck off." Harry snapped feeling the anger come flooding back. He had just screamed at Malfoy and now he was being mocked for it.
self control. He started storming toward the stairs before spinning on his heel. "I'll find you after breakfast. Charms is cancelled, Flitwick got knocked over by first years again, he's out cold in the hospital wing so we have an hour and a half. And if you tell anyone about being in each others heads I'll hex your bollocks off." He added snappily. He scowled and dragged himself up the stairs.
The name that flashed into Harry's head shocked him to the core. He felt the blood draining from his face. "Oh shit." He whispered. "Oh shit, oh no, oh fucking shit Ron!" He rambled. This really wasn't happening was it? Why did
Harry looked at Malfoy who he was glad to see was also biting back a laugh at the mention of 'hidden balls'. He could feel Ron chuckle behind him and heard the all too familiar smack of Hermione's hand on his arm.
By the time Harry pulled away they were nothing breathing heavily. Malfoy's hair was disheveled, his lips were swollen, a drop of blood pooled around the corner of his mouth. He showed a shy smile.
"So you told him to drink dreamless as to avoid me?" Draco snapped finally when the fidgeting became unbearable. The question was rhetorical and he already knew the answer but getting under the Weasels skin seemed preferable to the awkward silence and unrelenting fidgeting.
Harry rested his chin in his palms and stared expectantly at Malfoy. Of course he didn't know about strange and obscure legilimency and of course he didn't listen to Professor Binns.
Ron snorted next to Harry and slapped him on the back. Hermione was also giggling. Malfoy looked very flushed across the room and was desperately trying to push Parkinson away from him who was failing to whisper in his ear given their height difference.
"May the court note that this is the 4th time Mr Malfoy had attempted to resist Veritaserum during his questioning, which gives us the legal right to administer a stronger dose." The courtroom stayed mostly silent aside from a few strained whispers.
"What have you found then?" Harry said, slinging his bag onto an empty chair and shrugging off his robes before dropping himself, rather unceremoniously, next to Malfoy.
Ron leaned down behind him. "Hate to say it mate but you and the ferret looked great. Do us all a favour and take him yeah?"
"It's not fair Mione. He didn't ask to be on that side of the war. Dumbledore didn't even fucking offer to help him. Fuck! I didn't even offer to help him. I knew exactly what he was going through and I didn't reach out. We could've helped him Mione." He felt extremely frustrated now. Why couldn't he see that Malfoy was so desperate for someone to save him. Harry was the saviour, he saved his friends, he saved Hogwarts and fuck if he didn't save the Wizarding world and yet he didn't save Malfoy. He had refused to accept that Malfoy was just as much dragged into all that shit as he was. Why didn't Dumbledore help? Or Snape? Or
"Mr Malfoy why were you prepared to give your life in order to save Mr Potter?" The man said again, growing impatient.
Harry followed him up the stairs making his way back into his dorm where he promptly drifted back to sleep.
Draco set about removing various jars, packets and paper bags from the cupboards, setting them down in the counter in front of them. He proceeded to talk Harry through the steps for making his treacle croissants which Harry had immediately thought sounded incredible. He then busied himself making the treacle and left Harry to mix the pastry which was relatively easy with instruction. Once the pastry was eventually in the oven the two of them were covered in flour and sticky treacle and were breathing heavily.
He lifted arm up and around Malfoy's neck and loosely fumbled with the other arm to grip his hand as McGonagall instructed them. Malfoy slipped his arm easily around Harry's waist and pulled them closer together. Harry tried to ignore the loud wolf whistle from Seamus that echoed through the room and the numerous snickers of the other eighth years who should not be enjoying this at their expense!
He looked up at Malfoy who waved a hand, dismissively as if to say 'don't mention it'. He smiled and returned to his parchment. Harry realised that he wasn't actually writing but drawing.
"Thank you, Headmistress McGonagall." Doina Vacarescu answered. Her accent was barely audible but still present, definitely Romanian, more specifically from Transylvania. She tugged wryly at a curl of black air that had worked its way loose from the tight French twist at the back of her head and pursed her lips at Oline. Madame Maxime nodded but said nothing, smiling gently at Vidal with a look that gave Draco the impression that there wasn’t a sizable number of thoughts floating around in her head.
The bell tinkled as the two of them stepped into the shop and they were greeted instantly by the sweet, hot smell of baking. A short, chubby woman in her late forties looked up from behind a cash register and her face flushed as she broke into a grin.
Malfoy scrunched up his face. "A lake of blood? And they call me dramatic." He snorted. "You're right but you need to sleep too. You can't keep watch over me all night, Potter as much as it would satisfy you're hero complex."
The fucking counting in his head was addling his brain. He fumbled with the handles of his trunk and eventually managed to pry it from under the bed.
After a few corrections on their form, mostly Harry's, and a brief outline of the steps from McGonagall, Filch started up the gramophone which erupted with a crackling pop before the music was heard. It was a slow tune played on a piano which Harry thought may have sounded like a song by an old muggle composer he had studied in primary school. Then again he never enjoyed music lessons at muggle school so he couldn't be too sure.
Potter let out shaky sigh. "We won't talk about it anymore. I don't really want to discuss it. Can we just sleep?"
McGonagall glared at Harry and Malfoy again. Harry found that didn't really care, he was glad that he made Malfoy laugh out loud with just a look and the mention of balls like they were bloody twelve year olds.
After an awkward few moments of ignoring the other participants; McGonagall entered the room. She was accompanied by Madame Maxime as well as a painfully thin woman with weather-aged skin, whom Draco recognised as Doina Vacarescu the headmistress of Durmstrang. Following close behind was a girl with waist-length lavender hair, no older than twenty who sheepishly carried a ratty notepad and a swan quill. "The three of us want to offer our congratulations on your volunteering and subsequent selection to partake in this tournament. As you well know from last time, the tournament is a dangerous event, although we are lucky that Hogwarts has been allowed to host again in reparation. We wish you the very best of luck." McGonagall spoke firmly and fixed the other headmistresses with a polite smile.
He sounded pissed off Harry thought. But then again this was Malfoy. He always sounded pissed off. It was one of two perpetual states of being he could manage along with sarcastic wanky twat.
didn't have to dance with his ex-rival-turned-friend-crush-and-occasional-bed-and-dancing-companion, did he? The answer was no he did not and Harry was increasingly jealous of the fact.
"Right ok." Harry mumbled to himself trying not to smash his skull against the hard wood of the table and incapacitate himself. Why did everything that happened to him always result in having to do research? Malfoy had already left the library when Harry turned to look at the now empty chair only to realise that he'd left his gray school jumper slung over it. "Fucking idiot." He grumbled to himself. Now he'd have to deliver Malfoys jumper like a sodding owl. He rolled his eyes and opened the '
"Draco." Harry whined, reaching his arms out as far as they would go and making small grabbing motions with his fists. Ron laughed again, even Hermione stifled a giggle but Draco simply rolled his eyes and let Harry take his hands.
He raked at the cork in the top of the bottle with blunt finger nails before hearing a small pop as it released.
"Nngh Harry I'm-" Draco cried out as he shuddered inside Harry, his warm release and newly slicked cock was enough to send Harry over the edge too and he came with a cry, long thick ropes spurting hot onto his chest. Draco collapsed against him, breathing heavily which was the last thing Harry remembered aside from a splitting pain in his head and then...nothing.
Harry looked up to see Malfoy grinning at him. He worked his arm around Malfoy's waist. "We did do pretty great didn't we your holy pratness."
"That doesn't explain why I was experiencing your thoughts though." Harry added. "If it's legilimency I should only be able to receive thoughts that you choose to project into my head. You weren't even aware there was any kind of connection between us."
"Yes mate I think it was." He answered. "My family, my home, is so full of love of so many different kinds. I've been surrounded with it since I was born. It's powerful. So yes I could feel that there was something more between the two of you." He spoke gruffly, his eyes looked wet again and Hermione gently held onto his arm.
"Cerces tits Potter are you always this dense or is it especially for me? You must know that any time a same sex couple in history are referred to as '
"Now as you are all aware we will require a demonstration of the traditional dance you will expected to partake in during the first song of the evening. I require two volunteers and since Mr Malfoy and Mr Potter have been unable to take their eyes off each other since they walked into my classroom I am sure they will be more than happy to help out." McGonagall chided.
Malfoy was shaking so violently that the shackles cut deep into his skin, blood spattered onto the floor by his feet. Tears were now streaming down his face and he cried out.
Harry hadn't been called in to speak at many of the trials. He saw to it that Snape had been exonerated and that the ministry knew who's side he was on but other than that he had kept out of it. He chose instead to spend the weeks after the battle at 12 Grimmauld place, sleeping and cleaning and reading. That was until the month anniversary of the end if the battle.
"Yeah are you gonna spill? We've already told you s'ok." Ron mumbled, apparently he was as unprepared for this interrogation as Harry was since he was still holding a rather mauled looking chicken drumstick in a loose fist and still had gravy dribbling down his chin.
Harry shot across into Malfoy's head. He may feel sorry for Malfoy but he had not forgotten the altercation in the potions classroom.
Staff and students simultaneously held their breaths as the Goblet of Fire spewed out the first piece of scorched parchment in a burst of sparks and ash, a tanned square charred at the edges. The heat of the Hall was overwhelming, punctuated by the nauseating saccharine of burning parchment that hung in the air and mingled with the musty damp of the castle. The full moon remained hidden by the overcast enchanted ceiling, rendering the faces of many students shadowed as they stared in anticipation and wonder at the Goblet.
"Want you to fuck me. Please!" He cried out. Draco grunted and began unbuttoning Harry's trousers with his free hand. Harry took the hint and lifted his hips up to allow Draco to slide them off. Draco removed his hands from Harry's wrists to take off his own trousers. He straddled Harry again, the two of them now just in boxers, the thin fabric doing nothing to reduce the bursts of pleasure he felt every time Draco rocked his cock against Harry's own.
The hotel was an old stone building more than three stories tall complete with columns holding up a balcony above the first floor. The inside was flashy with a three story chandelier hanging down into the atrium. It was decorated almost entirely with red velvet and gold accents which made Harry think of the Gryffindor common room or the old palaces he learned about in primary school.
Harry slept through until 7:30 when a particularly over enthusiastic Ron woke him up with his pacing.
It was Harry's turn to blush, he felt the heat rising in his cheeks as the woman in front if his so openly discussed his romantic endeavours.
"I worked in a patisserie, making cakes and pastries and such. Felt like I needed a change and something to do to relax. Figured I needed some muggle clothes." Harry noticed a faint flush grow across his cheeks and ears.
Harry nearly grinned at their astounded faces. He would've done if he wasn't pissed off and still rather confused. "And then we cuddled up together on the sofa under a blanket. Told you nothing happened." Merlin had he meant to say that? Maybe Hermione had slipped him Veritaserum after all.
Harry found that trecherously his arms had worked there way around Malfoy's waist and were loosely cradling his lower back. This was not good at all.
knowing looks from Hermione whenever Harry seemed lost in thought, but a few less jumper related comments, although, that hadn't subsided entirely.
"You're bleeding out Malfoy stop being fucking facetious. How do I fix this?" Harry had an awful flashback to sixth year in the bathrooms. How did Snape heal Malfoy then? He really hoped it wasn't with any kind of potions.
happen. We were right. I'm surprised the whole hall didn't realise. Honestly Harry you two have the subtlety of a three headed dog."
He traded pleasantries with Abaforth before making his way over to the booth that Malfoy had chosen and handed over his butterbeer.
"You kidnapped me!" Harry exclaimed. He was in the bloody Room of Requirement again. The room they had gone to after their trip to Hogsmeade.
Luckily any news about Harry and Draco hadn't been subject to public scrutiny yet which left Harry offering Dean and Seamus a begrudging thank you for keeping their mouths shut. The two of them had shrugged and informed Harry that it was much better to have him owe them which had made Harry fear for his life, dignity and sanity.
one. A slightly different git who had apologised to everyone he'd hurt both directly and indirectly.
"Just because you're the Chosen Twat doesn't make you immune to the weather." Malfoy offered as if it was a perfectly acceptable reason for dragging somebody halfway around the castle and summoning a special room to keep them warm because you care enough about them to dislike seeing them cold but are too much of an emotionally constipated moron to admit it. It wasn't a perfectly acceptable reason Harry quickly decided.
It was only after they had gone that Malfoy eventually woke up, around forty minutes before dinner was due to start. He cleared his throat to get Harry's attention.
Harry was still fuming by the time he made it back to the eighth year tower. He had spent the best part of the journey shooting expletives into Malfoys head. He didn't care that he was a hypocrite, Malfoy was a fucking wanker!
"Blimey." Ron sputtered. "Never thought I'd see the day when they willingly decided to spend time with each other. You sure about this mate?"
They grinned at each other across the room as McGonagall went back to explaining the ball. Apparently they all had to wear a mask of some sort? Harry wasn't listening though. He'd ask Hermione about it later.
"You sure Harry?" Draco asked gently, the sudden tentative tone of his voice made Harry's heart swell. He nodded furiously and pulled at Draco's waist. Draco summoned his wand into his outstretched and and murmered a spell that Harry didn't recognise which left a pool of clear liquid in his palm. He used his spare hand to push Harry flat on his back on the bed before coaxing his thighs apart. Harry could only watch as Draco slicked one long finger with the oil before gently circling it around Harry's exposed hole. Harry moaned at the feeling, instantly wanting more.
Harry sighed. They were close enough to the hospital wing but he couldn't wait for Malfoy to regain consciousness. He reached under his knees and picked him up supporting his legs and holding him under his arms and round his waist. His head rested on Harry's shoulder and he felt his hair and breath tickle him.
There was a low grumble of reluctance but eventually a few couples bled from the excited crowd onto the cleared expanse of floor at the centre of the hall. Hermione and Ron were both grinning ear to ear although Ron still looked mildly uncomfortable, Blaise and Neville had also appeared along with Dean and Seamus. Ginny had stepped forward with a boy and Harry tried to hide the satisfaction that McGonagall had picked on her in front of her class. She was glaring at a very giggly looking Luna. A few other couples made it onto the floor, most of them seventh and sixth years but a few who looked much younger than that.
“Right, well congratulations again you three, I’ll speak to you again on the 24th before your first task.” Percy shook each of their hands before departing, swishing his coattails in an amusingly bird-like fashion. He passed Lydia on the way out and offered her a stiff embrace and a kiss on the cheek before leaving the room entirely.
He swallowed thickly before turning to Hemmione. "I asked him if he wanted to partner with me. He's good at potions." He hesitated for a moment. Before meeting Hermiones cool stare. "And, well y'know...
"Well." Ron started. "Do you remember that Care of Magical Creatures class in third year? The one where ferret face pissed off the Hypogriff?"
"Yeah Mione that's great and all, but I need to go now. I'll catch you later?" He cut her off. What was that about Malfoys mum? Ugh didn't matter time to grace the ferret with his company.
After they had left Marie, Draco had informed Harry that they could check into their hotel room which had provided Harry with all sorts of inappropriate thoughts of what one might get up to in a hotel room.
As soon as McGonagall dismissed them Harry bolted from the room and made his way to the greenhouses for double Herbology.
They lapped the square and came to a small shop with two white, iron tables outside and a few chairs of the same style with patchwork cushions. The shop itself was one story with a pale blue awning that read 'Le coin de Marie', which Draco informed him meant 'Marie's corner'.
Harry's breath caught at the use of his given name. He lurched forward and caught Malfoy...was he Draco now? In a kiss, sticky from the sugars and jam from the pastries. Draco let out a small squeal of surprise but gently kissed back before breaking away.
"Yeah well maybe we just use the same soap?" Harry snapped, looking away from Nott and trying to focus his attention on whatever Seamus was trying to blow up at the back of the room. He didn't need to deal with Nott.
It wasn't like Harry had never been interrogated by Ron and Hermione before: There was the time he kissed Cho, the time he kissed Ginny, the time him and Ginny broke up and not to mention almost every time he was accosted in the hallways by overenthusiastic fangirls but this one really took the treacle tart.
Harry snapped up to meet his eyes, he couldn't just let Malfoy say that and get away with it could he? "I suppose the Slytherin Prince, Pureblood poster child, Lord of Snakes and arranged marriage requests gets shit tones of women then." He growled still glaring at Malfoy.
Harry took a long, hot shower that morning taking extra care with his hair, even daring to use real shampoo and conditioner rather than just soap like he normally did. Who knew having a crush on Draco Malfoy would do bloody weird things to your brain? Certainly not Harry.
The three talked for a while longer before Hermione asked what Harry was doing at the weekend and if he wanted to come to the Burrow with them.
Harry knew how pained his voice must sound in Malfoy's head but he found he didn't care. He kept talking to Malfoy hoping that he would be ok by the time he got there and that whatever had happened, the blood he spoke about, wasn't his. He knew that was probably wishful thinking.
"As much as I am enjoying the pleasantries, Potter, we have a job to do, and by 'job' I mean dance and by 'do' I mean perfect and instill jealousy in the hearts of those observing."
The rest of the day went by fairly quickly. He'd spent it in Herbology next to Neville. He'd assumed Neville would be a safe bet as he would obviously not notice the suspicious jumper through the bedroom eyes he was giving the large Shrivelfig plant (and Blaise Zabini) in front of him.
“This is Percy Weasley with the Department for International Magical Cooperation. He will speak to you after the three of us take our leave.” McGonagall spoke again, clasping her hands together at her chest and beaming at the former Gryffindor. Percy nodded politely at Draco, Vidal, Oline, and the headmistresses. “And this is Lydia Lafant, a journalist for the prophet. She will interview each of you individually and then you will be photographed for the front page.” McGonagall informed clerically. She gestured to the girl behind her who waved and offered them a shy smile. “That is all I have to say, if any other head wishes to add anything then be my guest, if not then Mr Weasley is free to talk to you, and then Miss Lafant is welcome to conduct her interviews.” The other heads stayed quiet and so McGonagall nodded to the three champions again and led the women out of the room.
Harry decided almost instantly that there was no way he was letting anything happen to Malfoy. The ministry would take any opportunity to toss him into Azkaban. They would see his Dark Mark and lock him up for cursing Katie or poisoning Ron or letting Deatheaters into Hogwarts or plotting to kill Dumbledore without ever stopping to think
Draco rolled his eyes. "It's Harry when you're not being an enormous fucking idiot. Why did you do that?"
share his headspace with, which he supposed was a start. It was still unpleasant though, however, it was safe to say, it wasn't the worst thing to happen so far this year. No, that would be a toss up between almost being ingested by a venomous tentacular in the second floor boys toilets (how that had got there was a mystery.) Or having to face off with an oversized acromantular on the third floor corridor (How
"I need you to hold him and make him swallow these." Pomfrey ordered as she strode to Malfoy's bed. "He is unconscious and I don't want to risk waking him up to take the potions do you understand me?" She barked.
"She thinks we're...uh...doing things together? I guess like...a couple? I dunno. I told her we were just potions partners." He sighed still pointedly not looking at Malfoy and hoping that murder had cooled down to mild torture.
"You're off duty Pans. Our wonderful saviour is taking over." Malfoy drawled. Pansy just rolled her eyes and shoved feet from her lap.
Draco too was wearing the same thing as before but with a Gray jumper instead of light blue. His nails were black again but matte rather than shiny.
Harry tried to clear his mind so he could go back to sleep but it kept fluttering back to the unsettling and painfully familiar voice from his nightmare. It had sounded frantic.
"Merlin! I want you." Harry panted. Draco just growled and rocked against him harder nearly causing him to cry out from the intensity of the friction.
The man turned back to the guard. "Mr Malfoy has attempted to resist the second does of Veritaserum twice, therefore a third dose is permitted."
After a very embarrassing and stressful lunch Harry, Ron and Hermione made their way down to the lake. There was more whispering than usual on the way out of the castle and Harry caught many students staring at him and huddling together giggling about him. He growled low in his throat.
"Well what happened then? You've been grinning like an idiot at him all through dinner and you expect me to believe that
Harry was breathless as he jumped the final stairs onto the third floor but kept his pace as he sprinted towards the bathroom. The floor was almost entirely flooded in two or so inches of water. He still couldn't see Malfoy.
Eventually Hermione bustled in wearing a satin gown in the same cobalt blue as Ron's mask and cloak and hounded Harry to get changed. He managed to get her to leave by threatening to drop his towel and give her an eyeful which was apparently enough of a deterrent. She'd rolled her eyes and swept out of the room muttering something about boys being disgusting and knowing too much about Harry's genitals to care much anyway.
Malfoy sighed and pushed away the loose strands of hair that had fallen in front of his eyes."As much as I hate to admit it, Potter, I belive you may have been correct, about it being legilimency or similar." He sniffed distainfully at having to admit that Harry had been correct about something and Harry found he quite enjoyed it. "Someone has cast a spell with the intention of linking our minds." He continued. "The connection appears to open winder when we experience overwhelming emotions or when it is at it's newest. For example this morning, you regrettably had full access to my thoughts because I was considerably stressed."
Harry grabbed a few slices of toast and fanned them like a hand of cards, raising his eyebrow at Malfoy. By this point Hermione had closed her book and was also eyeing Harry.
"Draco!" Harry cried. "Ron, Monione!" He wasn't entirely sure he had got Hermione's name right but he had given it a good go.
"I'm glad I didn't scare you off." He said quietly, staring down into Harry's green eyes. Harry shivered as his breath ghosted across his face.
. Seamus, Dean and Neville had ribbed him mercilessly. Even Ginny had found the entire situation far too amusing for Harry's liking. It also didn't help that Pansy Parkinson, Queen of gossip, was claiming she had actually seen it unfold (which to Harry's knowledge was a big fucking lie) and was, along with Zabini, promising to sell the pensieve memory to a large group of 6th year Hufflepuffs who had braved a trip to the Slytherin table. There was absolutely no positive to the situation since Malfoy wasn't here to take any of the teasing.
Harry blushed furiously and puffed out his chest. 'Now or never' screamed his Gryffindor courage. "I said. I love you." He spoke firmly before shooting his arms up to Draco's neck and pulling him into a harsh kiss. There was too much teeth and it was way too frantic, Harry could taste blood but he couldn't care. He felt like an elastic band that had snapped. It was how they did everything, full of passion but marred with pain and it was perfect. It was what he should've done in third year when they faced off in Care of Magical Creatures, in fourth year when Malfoy made those stupid badges, in fifth year when Harry beat him up for being a twat on the Quidditch pitch and in sixth year in the bathroom. It was an aplogy for the misunderstandings. It was long overdue.
Harry didn't hate Malfoy. He didn't hate him for their rivalry or for how he treated Harry because Harry treated him in the exact same way. The two of them riled each other up and spurred each other on. He didn't hate Malfoy for the war either. They had both just been pawns, their actions manipulated by the adults around them. They were kids.
Hermione nodded in agreement. She stayed silent for a moment longer before speaking again. "Harry what are you doing about your bond?"
It was bitterly cold outside for early October meaning that Harry was in a perpetual state of freezing his arse off. He could literally see his breath shuddering out into the empty corridor.
After taking one sip of his drink Harry burst out laughing so hard that he barely stopped the butterbeer from shooting out of his nose.
Harry was buzzing after his kidnapping-turned-date with Draco. When they eventually made it up to the common room and parted ways with a small kiss Hermione squealed so loud that she could've been mistaken for a muggle car alarm, Ron looked faintly bemused but that was to be expected and, as the only other two people in the common room, Dean begrudgingly handed Seamus ten galleons. Harry assumed that was the bet Ron had mentioned a week prior, he reminded himself to enact his revenge on Semaus, Dean and anyone else who had bet on him at the next available opportunity. He was sure he could arrange for a few goblets to explode in the faces of the unexpected at breakfast.
When Harry woke the next morning it was to the same, snappy voice that had woken him up the previous morning.
"Well Harry it is very obvious really." She said glancing over at Ron who looked like it wasn't at all very obvious and clearly had no idea what the awkward conversation was about. He made a noncommittal grunt.
Eventually, after the common room had mostly cleared the three of them made their way to their dorm. A few of the younger years had tried to snag an autograph or a photo with him on the way which was annoying, to say the least, however, he went to sleep that night feeling like maybe he had a fighting chance in this tournament if he really tried.
"Yes well as you know not all of us have the self control of the Chosen Twat. Oh wait! Yes we do considering that the Chosen Twat has the self control of a hyperactive toddler and most of us have grown out of that by now."
"We needed to relax his brain after the accident Miss Granger, the effects exhibited by the potions Mr Potter was given are the same as alcohol without the negatives. He is merely inebriated." The healer answered. Hermione nodded and Ron laughed next to him.
Ron snapped his attention back to Harry and nodded frantically before plopping himself on his bed and facing Harry. "Anything mate, you know I'm here for you."
. As Hermione finished speaking, Pumpkin juice shot out of Ron's nose in shock. Proving that he had, in fact, absoloutely no clue what his girlfriend was talking about.
Harry did not take his time. He lurched out of bed and tried to ignore the pounding headache that felt like he'd been hit by a fucking bludger and knocked out cold. He fumbled for a few minutes changing into school trousers and a shirt, leaving his tie loose around his neck he bolted from his room towards the Great Hall. Immediately all eyes turned to him. He smiled at Draco who smiled weakly back and made his way over to the Griffindor table.
He was cut off as Hermione nodded enthusiastically. "He's gone back to Wiltshire Harry, back to the manor.
was going on and there was nothing he could say to change that...Unless there was...Oh of course there was.
Malfoy nodded slowly. Clearly that wasn't a wrong answer, Malfoy was still being civil at least. He leant back into the sofa, folding his arms across his chest. Still frowning, of course.
The wall of heat from the kitchens hit like a stunning spell. Predictably the house elves fussed around 'young master black' before paying any attention to 'mister Harry Potter, sir'. Harry didn't mind. He liked watching Malfoy flush with the attention.
Malfoy grinned and chugged his butterbeer with long, smooth gulps, barely waiting for Harry to finish his before pulling him out of the Hoggshead and along to Honeydukes.
Harry went to bed that night feeling a great deal happier than he had in the long month since the battle.
The man laughed heartily at Harry. "I assume by Draco you are referring to the Mr Malfoy who's frustrated pacing had him sent to a waiting room? He is with your friends, Miss Granger and Mr Weasley I believe. I will fetch them for you now, Mr Potter. Then, we will discuss what happened, am I understood?" Harry nodded bluntly.
“Thank you, Mr. Weasley.” Draco bowed his head in response. He seemed bearable as far as Weasleys went, definitely one of the most Slytherin of the bunch, following the twins and the She-Weasel.
Malfoy was lying next to the sinks covered in blood. His shirt was torn exposing a large open wound running from his sternum to his waist. The word 'Deatheater' was carved underneath the wound.
So I know this is another short chapter without much plot HOWEVER, its v important and you'll see why soom. Also the next chapter will be LONG and rather dramatic and It will also have smut so......
"It's Saturday tomorrow, you fucking idiot." Harry grunted to himself with laugh as Malfoy shuffled down the bed and faced toward him. He gave him a light shove.
Draco sighed. "Blaise can you just stun her. If you'd recall this method of interrogation doesn't work on me."
The inside of the room was cosy and warm with high walls lined with dark-wood bookcases filled with leather books of various shades of tan. On the back wall there was a wide, ornately carved stone fireplace with a roaring gold fire in the grate. The wall behind the fireplace was adorned with a number of intricate gold mirrors in a myriad of different sizes and shapes. A large brown, leather sofa, similar to the one in the eigth year common room, sat in front of the fireplace on an olive green shaggy rug. Across the back of the sofa an expensive-looking, fur-lined blanket was slung. In front of the sofa was a coffee table in a wood to match the bookcases with two steaming mugs resting on it along with a pile of books, a few lit candles and a crystal ball on a wooden stand.
to open the letter. After all the Ministry had proven time and time again that that they didn't care a great deal about his well being and much preferred to haul him in when it seemed convenient for them. They had been absoloutely no bloody help in the years leading up to the battle.
"No. It wasn't a fucking lie. I told you I wasn't going to." Harry growled, attempting to scowl at Malfoy and wondering how he'd calmed down so easily just from Malfoys soft tone.
"Master Malfoy is telling Pipsy that there is to be no visitors for him today." She squeaked, glaring at Harry.
There was a loud applause and more than one excited whelp from the audience as the couples made their way from the floor. Malfoy, still holding Harry's waist, escorted him to a quiet corner of the hall with a punch fountain. Ron and Hermione followed close behind along with Zabini and Neville and Parkinson and a boy Harry didn't recognise.
"Mmfgh." He grunted as he felt the heavy weight of a cloak wrap round his shoulders with a strong pair of arms. The arms wrapped tighter as the began to do the clasp of the cloak up around his neck. With as much warning as the arms arrived they were gone.
Draco had kissed him gently in the common room before taking Harry's hand as they made their way down to Hogsmeade so they could apparate. They found a quiet spot behind the Three Broomsticks to apparate from.
what you’re like in bed, and then Pansy would’ve put me in a body bind and tied me up in a broom cupboard. Forgive me for not sharing my plans.” He huffed, forcing himself to keep eye contact with Theo as opposed to fueling Pansy’s vendetta any further.
"Furthermore, unlike most legilimency bonds it can't be broken by the subjects, only the caster. It will remain unless we find the caster and make them break it, it wears off or we brew a very complex and very illegal potion." He paused again allowing the information to catch up to Harry who, yet again felt mildly bewildered. It wasn't his fault that legilimency was stupidly complicated yet mind numbingly boring.
in the north of England, he wasn't good at telling apart English accents so well. She mentioned that she only went to Durmstrang because her twin brother Quais, the man from the hall, had wanted to attend and that she would've rather gone to Illvermony, although she'd settled in quickly. She had also mentioned that she was single although she wouldn't mind 'having a go at' a fair few of the Beauxbaton’s girls which Draco found to be rather crass yet terribly amusing. He hadn't told her much in turn only that he was from Wiltshire and he spoke many languages, having discovered at a young age that he was an exceptionally talented linguist.
Harry focused on the click of the door closing and the slow tapping of receding footsteps and he tried desperately to understand what had just happened.
Ron blanched, freckles standing stark against sickly green skin. "Right mate, um, not sure how to help you here. At least he hasn't turned u-" Ron was interrupted by a sharp banging on the door.
"Fine." Harry said finally. "We'll work together, if we can't figure it out then we ask Ron and Hermione. Deal?"
"You kissed me." Harry said bluntly after he had finally figured out, undoubtedly, that this wasn't a dream. He was never very elegant or tactful and he really wanted to get to the bottom of the situation.
. Goyle was loitering nearby scuffing his shoes against the floor and looking generally disinterested in the whole ordeal.
"I told you it was all just pulling pigtails, Draco, didn't I tell you?" She looked stupidly pleased at the small act of affection.
Harry frowned. This was seeming to become a common occurrence. "Why did they need to keep their relationship a secret? They were allowed to be friends, they founded a castle together?"
Harry gently untied the letter from the owls foot, avoiding the harsh nips it attempted to land on his fingers.
"Er." He said. He didn't really have anything else to say. They were lucky he was actually choosing to speak to them. The last time they had kidnapped him he had pointedly refused to answer any questions. Besides he didn't understand what information they were trying to pry out of him this time, he never normally did. The oblivious thing really wasn't an act.
Malfoy flushed furiously. "Pervy moustache? I- wait a minute." He growled wiping his mouth on the back of his hand and pointedly glaring at Harry who was still falling around with laughter. The furious, red blush on Malfoy's cheeks and neck only made him laugh harder.
"Salazar's balls you're really going in heavy with the questions this morning aren't you? It's not the most effective due to the fact that the two subjects have to have a strong emotional connection so they can share thoughts or pictures or memories or other such things." He took a moment to lift his head and raise his eyebrow at Harry. Like he was making sure the information had sunk in before he continued.
The three of them chatted for a while longer before eventually falling silent and lethargic in front of the roaring fire. Harry checked the bond a few times to find that Draco had fallen asleep. It was gone twelve before the trio made it up to bed and Harry passed out the second his head had hit the pillow, despite his twelve hour nap earlier that morning. It had been a long day after all.
Malfoy straightened his back and folded his arms as Harry reached over and grabbed his sixth croissant.
Myrion started with the individual shots. Oline stood akimbo, glaring into the camera with an evil sneer which rivalled that of even Severus. Vidal went for more of a sexy look, attempting to smoulder into the camera which Draco had thought looked more akin to the face one made upon drinking a Polyjuice potion or perhaps suffering from constipation. Maybe even both, it wasn’t an attractive face. Draco chose to stand with his arms tucked behind his back and his legs parted slightly. A pose mirrored in many portraits in the castle. It presented a defensive kind of power, strength with control, non-threatening.
Draco took his hand again, leading Harry through busy streets swarming with people. Harry was oddly surprised that Draco remained unbothered by the sheer volume of muggles and the loud rumblings of buses, cars and taxis but, like everything, he supposed it was something a person grew accustomed to.
By the time two of them had made it back up to the castle it had only just gone twelve. Lunchtime was the most popular time to visit Hogsmeade meaning that the majority of students in third year and above had left the castle for a visit, while Harry and Malfoy were still out, leaving the castle relatively quiet save for the younger years who would likely be in their common rooms and the odd professor.
Harry nodded slowly, hoping that if he pretended he knew what was going on the information might actually make sense.
"Mr Malfoy would it be correct to say that, should the only option to save Mr Potter have been to give your own life, you would've done so?"
Malfoy coughed drawing his attention away from the elegant fingers to his stern gaze. "This." He said, waving a tatty-looking, green leather-bound book lazily in front of Harry's face. "Is an exceptionally well known text by Gretle Gedankenleser, she was a German legilimens. This was sort of her diary, or research journal. She is the only reason that we have such an advanced understanding of modern day legilimency." Malfoy said as he stared at the book thoughtfully again. "She briefly mentions a spell '
Malfoy shook again, much more violently. The cuffs around his wrists began to leave angry, red marks against the white of his forearms.
Harry's eyes snapped up from the book he was reading curled up of the chair to meet Malfoys and he smiled. "Hey." He croaked. His voice was hoarse as he fought through the threat of sleep sweeping over him. It had been a bloody exhausting day, what with the gay crisis and saving Malfoy, after all.
"No it's ok, not your fault. Talking about Sirius always makes me cry I guess. I knew him well enough to feel like someone was snatched away when he was killed y'know? I'm sorry. "
Eventually it did end when the timer Draco had set went off and they pulled the croissants out of the oven. They used a small piping bag to inject the croissants with the hot treacle and Draco wrapped them up in a brown paper bag. He left a few of them on a plate as a thank you to Marie. They bid her farewell and promised to come back soon as they left the shop.
"No. I didn't tell anyone I was planning to or had entered," he answered, sheepishly revisiting the memory of a livid Pansy looking away from him in the hall.
"Do you agree with this summary Mr Potter?" The man asked turning his attention towards Harry who nodded stiffly. "Mr Malfoy is there any personal information that has been withheld from your personal file at the DMLE?"
Lydia continued scribbling, pausing a few times to look up at Draco, perhaps trying to gauge how he felt and whether or not there was any truth behind his words. "How did you feel when, during the 1994 Triwizard Tournament, the participant for Hogwarts Cedric Diggory passed away? Did it dissuade you from wanting to enter?”
Potter let out a soft snort and relaxed into Draco's embrace. "Just sorry you had to see it s'all. Why are you so mad about it anyway?"
Sorry if u dont like feet just thought it was a weird and very homosexual thing for Harry to do. Thought I'd project a bit on Draco, there were storms when I wrote this and it makes my joints hurt.
"Er hullo." Harry blurted at the elf. She looked him up and down and slowly started to close door again.
Bit of a short one but the ball chapter is the next one so... Also wanted to say thank you for all the support it's really appreciated and makes me v happy :)
Harry laughed out loud. The voice didn't seem threatening after all and he deserved to find it amusing if he was forced to listen to it. In fact he didn't even think the voice was aware that it was in his head. It didn't feel like Voldemort trying to drive him to insanity or Snape trying to infiltrate his memories. This voice was just...there. Just rattling around in his head like his own conscious narrative. Gingerly, Harry decided to try and talk.
sharp this morning. Much more witty than he normally did at this ridiculous time. After a few minutes of silence Harry decided to probe again.
Eventually Harry was called up and gave his testimony. He answered a few additional questions before eventually he was excused to sit down and watch the rest of the trial.
He closed his eyes briefly and brought his focus to the niggling connection he felt at the base of his skull. He concentrated hard on the feeling of a tunnel inside his head and gently pressed himself through. The tunnel grew warmer as he went, he could feel the atmospheric tingling of Potters magic around him: raw and powerful and uninhibited, much different to his own. He felt like he was plunging into a volcano. Still he pressed on through the tunnel until he came to the other side. This side was much different to his own headspace, firstly it was loud, thoughts were buzzing incessantly around in his head which meant that Potter was processing information, he caught the odd flash of legilimency terminology although the thoughts were weak showing that Potter was distracted.
He felt himself screaming into his brain hoping that Malfoy would hear the words and maybe decide to listen to him for once. He pushed through the piles of first years trying to cram themselves into the great hall and screeched towards the fourth floor. He took the stairs two at a time nearly knocking over a group of Ravenclaw girls before he came to a stop outside the potions classroom.
He had thought about his feelings toward Malfoy. He had always craved the attention of the other boy, there was always a need, not to outdo him but to impress him. He relaised that there was so much more to Malfoy than the spoilt, bratty kid he thought he knew. He was intelligent: Matching Hermione at the top of the class through out his years at Hogwarts, he was talented, at chess and Quidditch and duelling, it was stupid to deny that. He was also attractive, Harry would've had to have been an idiot not to see it. With his milky white skin and his striking white hair and those gray eyes. The way he carried himself and spoke.
Malfoy shook his head and closed the book in front of him. "The most famous use of this bond was between Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin. They used it to keep their relationship a secret from the other two founders although Merlin knows why since Rowena and Helga were most definitely getting off with each other behind closed doors, but I digress."
Lowkey had too much fun writing oblivious Harry. Also gay crisis which is always fun. Lowkey a cliff hanger but I'm not dramatic enough to do it properly so f. Also wanted to explain that I kinda have a head cannon that whilst Ron is oblivious to most things love isnt one of those things due to the love in his family and he understands it better than anyone.
"Too many clothes." He began removing Harry's shirt before unbuttoning his own which gave Harry time to pull his tshirt off over his head. Before he could think Draco had pinned his wrists above his head against and was slowly rock against his hips. He leaned forward to catch Harry in a kiss again, grinding slowly throughout.
Malfoy looked around, as if to confirm that there were, in fact, no free beds and that Harry wasn't, in fact, an idiot. "Come here then." He answered finally shuffling over to one side of the bed and flipping the sheets over.
Malfoy laughed lightly as he walked to the door and opened it. "I'm glad it wasn't a lie you utter wanker. I feel the same."
Malfoy resisted again but only managed a few seconds before answering. "July 31st 1991. The day I met him."
Malfoy's head snapped up to meet Harry's eyes, the smug look disappeared instantly and was replaced with something more akin to murderous. "She's fucking what?" He sputtered. "What did you do Potter?"
Without much warning Draco stepped forward and pried the clean spoon from Harry's hand and dropped it on the worktop before capturing him in a kiss. Harry quickly relaised that he much preferred this to licking a spoon even if it
"I have to say gentlemen that was beautifully done. I'm sure I will not be the only one to say that I will be sorely disappointed if we are unable to witness that again at the ball." McGonagall sniffed lightly and dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief.
Harry was exceptionally groggy when he woke up. He had a vivid memory of his date followed by mind numbing sex with Draco, then after that only a vague memory of a hospital, the Headmistresses office and throwing up. He groaned.
"Fine." Harry said again pushing back off the sofa. "Can I go back to bed now or are we having another little potions meltdown?"
"Happy birthday Mr Malfoy." The man crowed. "Now would you please summarise your relationship with a one Mr Harry James Potter?"
"Uhh right ok." Harry bleated trying to ignore the personal jibes. It's just Malfoy being Malfoy he reminded himself as he watched him turn his head back to the book in his hands. Harry couldn't help but look as Malfoy began thumbing through the worn pages with long bony fingers and squared off gray nails.
"Shuff off Malffoy." Ron grumbled almost instinctively through a mouthful of his third helping of eggs. He didn't even need to look up. He' be an asset to the Aurors if he could sense dark wizards with as much ease as he sensed Malfoy's presence. Harry shifted round on the bench to face Malfoy who was hovering next to the table.
When Harry woke up on Saturday morning it was to a dick so hard it was painful and a very heavy weight pinning him to the bed.
Dutifully he returned to the mass of tables on the desk and pushed all, well most, thoughts of Potter from his head.
The group stood and talked a while longer before McGonagall dragged them up for another dance, more or less the same as the first, which was followed by a band singing covers of Celestina Warbeck, the Weird Sisters and a few other wizarding groups Harry recognised but couldn't name.
Draco knew he should've expected that question, but oddly enough it came as a shock to be able to openly discuss his buried feelings about Cedric’s death. That had been one death that Draco had never felt he had been allowed to grieve considering the Dark Lord was the one to kill him, his family were already heavily involved with Good Ol' Tom back in fourth year and grieving Cedric in front of his father would likely have ended in hexes of the unforgivable variety. "Cedric was an incredible role model to many people, I'm sure everyone who knew him and even those who didn't will agree. He was kind and a good friend to myself and many others." He paused. "Cedric helped me through a very confusing time in my life, something that I didn’t quite understand. He recognised that I was struggling with something and just talked to me, I was thirteen.” Draco could feel himself tearing up at the thought of his last memory of Cedric, just before the third task. They had only spoken briefly but Draco had told Cedric that everything would be ok and Cedric had told him that his parent's opinions and expectations didn’t matter. As it turned out, neither of them were quite right in the end.
Harry had chosen a pair of plain black suit trousers and a white shirt with an emerald green cloak, with help from Lavender Brown and mask to match, Hermione had provided both him and Ron with masks after spending Monday evening in the library researching masquerade balls and Harry had to say he was impressed.
Ron frowned for a moment. "I would ask the person if the issue is that they don't like being touched." He said, finally. "Some people don't want to be come onto and that's ok."
Experimentally, Harry lifted his hand a traced a thumb across Malfoy's cheek, letting his palm rest to cup his jaw. Malfoy let out a heavy rush of air and Harry retracted his arm quickly. No, that was not a good idea. It could only end badly.
" He knew Hermione would accept that answer. Inter-house unity seemed to be some kind of get-out-of-Azkaban-free card in Hogwarts this year for all students, with the exception of Seamus (always the exception) who had not managed to escape three weeks of detention for smuggling firewhisky into the castle by hiding it down his trousers. Then and only then was inter-house unity not a viable excuse.
“But he’s hot, Theo. There’s a rule; the hotter you are the more of an arsehole you’re allowed to be. That’s why Draco and I are such massive knobheads because we’re hot. You could afford to be a dick by the way.” Blaise countered, winking at Theo, who grinned despite himself.
Now here they were, less than a month into term bouncing around in each other's heads, he could hardly say it was pleasant having his mind space invaded again so soon after Voldemort was killed but oddly he could think of people he'd much
"Shit I'm sorry, you shouldn't have had to see that". Potter grumble, looking pointedly down at his feet to avoid eye contact with Draco. He must've realised that Draco had seen his dream, perhaps he was a more gifted Occlumens than Draco had given him credit. But why was he apologising?
He jumped off the bench and strode over to the Slytherin table. He grabbed Draco by the arm and pulled him off of the bench so they stood together in the aisle. Harry stared up at Draco's wide, confused eyes and did the only thing he could, he tangled his fingers in the hair at the nape of his neck and pulled him into a firm kiss. They shocked silence turned into a scattered applause and eventually perpetuated into excited cheers by Seamus' loud whistles.
Harry forced a smile as he felt his heart racing in his chest. "Yeah ok." He stammered. "Fucking Hufflepuff." He added. Just so Malfoy wouldn't quite know the extent to which this was affecting his stupid fucking feelings.
"I-" he started but faltered. He didn't trust his voice so he trusted his instincts instead and lurched himself forward, crashing into Draco and wrapping his arms around his middle.
Predictably, Granger flushed, the pink climbing all the way up to her ears and down to her chest. "Ok fine I was just checking." She grumbled, refusing eye contact. "He will be out for twelve hours, that was a rather large dose he took and he's bloody lucky we don't have any classes tomorrow. I'll let you stay with him and in the meantime. Sound ok?"
After that Myrion had ushered them into the group shot. Oline in the middle, Vidal on the right and Draco on the left. The three of them stood with their arms crossed and chins held high, smiling intermittently as the camera caught their eye.
Once back in the common room Ron and Hermione had announced their departure to 'Study' although it was oddly convenient that Pavarti Patil, Hermione's roommate, had left to go to the library ten minutes beforehand. This left Harry to sit on his own in the corner of the common room.
"Now students, today's lesson may come as unexpected to you however, it is important that with every ball that is hosted at Hogwarts an accompanied lesson on dance and dance etiquette is provided." McGonagall said rather wistfully. Had Harry missed something here? Since when was there another ball? He bloody hoped they weren't springing a surprise murder tournament on him too.
Harry frowned to himself. Maybe he should talk to the voice? Ask it to fuck off, watch it's sodding language and let him bloody well go back to sleep. He didn't
At some point during the night Malfoy had managed to flip him onto his back and was now choosing to use Harry as a mattress. Malfoy's chest was pressed flush against with his legs straddling Harry's hips and arms draped lazily around his neck. So this is how you're supposed to feel when another body is pressed against your own. Harry thought to himself. Fucking fantastic!
"NEITHER AM I. FUCKING LIE POTTER. NOW!" He jabbed his finger into Harry's chest again. He was now only a few centimetres away forcing Harry to look almost straight up at him.
The rest of the day went by quickly whisly the trio sat around the lake. Harry had finished his Transfiguration homework followed by a charms essay, Hermione spent the time writing an Ancient Runes essay that was probably about sixteen feet long and Ron spent the day throwing stones into the lake and spouting off Chuddley Cannons Trivia, very productive. Thankfully the rumours about Harry's cock had ceased completely by the time they had sat through dinner.
"I just wondered what you did with your jumper Harry. It looks awfully big and smells very...nice." She sounded oddly surprised as she told him that the jumper smelt nice which Harry reminded himself to take offence to as soon as he got himself out of the awful conversation.
Pomfrey smiled at him. "Even so Mr Potter well done." She turned and began to walk back to her chambers.
Annoyingly, Malfoy didn't even bother looking up. He reached down to wrap his long, slim fingers around his wand and shot what Harry assumed to be a drying charm at his nails. He lent back on his elbows, stretching out like a well fed kneazle in front of the fire.
Hermione looked at Harry with an odd, soft expression in her eyes. She nodded and indicated the chair next to their sofa. Harry sat down and shuffled forward to rest his elbows on his knees.
There is depictions of blood and wounds in this and reference to torture kinda so if you don't wanna read then please avoid this chapter.
Harry smiled and gave an overexaggareted bow as the applause continued along with a few more whistles than strictly necessary. Malfoy gave a stiff bow too before scampering back to Parkinson. Harry moved back to Ron and Hermione, her eyes were also looking suspiciously moist.
Almost immediately a very tall man in healer robes leaned over him. "Mr Potter how gracious of you to bless us with your company." Harry felt like he should take offence to the words but the man's tone seemed genuine. Besides, he was far too sleepy to argue.
Harry sighed. "And what would you think if someone told you they were in that situation and they were not interested in the slightest and felt uncomfortable with that person pressed against them." He asked.
Without too much warning Malfoy began to move. Harry stepped tentatively at first, looking down at his feet but found that the movement with Malfoy leading felt natural to him. He felt as if he could follow it with his eyes closed.
"Mate take a vial of dreamless. He can't talk to you if you're out cold!" Ron burst out looking far too pleased with himself for thinking of solution. The banging and shouting from outside continued.
"Ok close your eyes and focus on the pulling feeling at the base of your skull, can you feel it?" Malfoy's voice had dropped into a whisper next to his ear. Harry closed his eyes and let the warmth of the body behind him and the voice in his ear clear his mind.
"Fuck!" He exclaimed suddenly. "The fucking jumper that's why it's so big!" He must've got them muddled up in his groggy post-nap state. Malfoy was much taller that he was, freakishly so. Well maybe 6 foot was only freakish because Harry was barely 5"8. That's what you get for spending eleven years in a cupboard he supposed. He knew his dad was at least 6 foot although his mum wasn't tall was she? He cursed child abuse for his inability to fit properly in Malfoy's jumper causing him, henceforth, to look like a bloody first year on their first day.
"Ah, then another time." He smirked at Harry at reached for a small pastry supplied by the house elves.
Harry was kicked out of the hospital wing an hour later as apparently cuddling Malfoy until he returned to consciousness was not a viable substitute to catching up with missed lessons and homework. He was finally able to deal with the unrelenting hard-on.
"Uh, that's great thank you." She blushed again and sat herself down in the chair, perching on the edge and bouncing her knee. "Ok, Draco, so I'm going to ask you a series of questions, some general and some a bit more personal. Is that ok with you?" Draco nodded and she grinned. "Great! So firstly, what made you want to partake in the tournament?" She asked, pulling a pair of wide lensed tortoiseshell glasses from her pocket and sliding them onto her nose.
"Honestly Ginerva, what would your mother say." She glowered at Ginny. At least someone else in the hall didn't fancy hearing jokes about Harry's unrelenting hard-on whilst they ate lunch. Ron was still grinning, y'know, like a bastard, however, Harry was still distracted by the fact that he had come so hard he saw stars when he left the hospital wing to care all that much.
"Just tell us Draco bloody hell!" Blaise snapped. "None of us enjoy this but unfortunately it's apparently necessary to get any ounce of truth out of you."
Harry just nodded, completely stunned at whatever the fuck had just happened. Was this still part of the dream? Was it one, long and continuous hellish stream of dreamscape designed to torture him?
Harry woke up with a growl and a mammoth hard on already leaking in his boxers. At first he was hit with a wave of frustration which was eventually replaced with a feeling of undeniable dread and immense fear. Had Malfoy seen that? Fuck what if he had? He couldn't deal with that, not right now.
"Gentlemen, now would be good." McGonagall snapped, clearly relishing in the discomfort of the two of them. She was a cruel woman, very Slytherin of her to humiliate them like this.
it's way out of his ribcage. He shoved his glasses onto his face and quickly the hazy border around his eyes began to clear. He relaised he was in his room. Ron was in the other bed with the purple drapes drawn tightly shut around him whereas Harry's were partially drawn. He assumed he must have opened at some point in the night, judging from what was obviously a very erratic nightmare. Oddly it was light outside, not the usual pitch black or dull moonlight he was normally greeted with after a nightmare. The bright, early-morning Scottish sun burst through the curtains and cast a neat triangle of sunlight on his torso.
Pansy stamped her foot sharply against the floor. Great an now she was having a tantrum. How typically Pansy.
"Oh yeah, well good. Gonna ask Mione to the ball today, wanna make it all romantic y'know, to make up for last time." He said grinning. Harry was happy to see Ron and Hermione together and glad that Ron loved her so much he made the effort. They really were good together.
"Pipsy I told you, no guests. That's the only thing I ever asked for. I bought you lots of lovely new dresses and this is how you repay me? I-" he stopped grumbling and scowled at the sight of Harry at the door.
"Ok, well..." Harry started, he was obviously going to have to be very delicate with his wording, he did not want tirade of swearwords from Malfoys foul mouth directed at him. "It feels a bit like legilimency I guess." He decided to go with. "I mean the way you sound and your presence in my head. Feels like legilimency. Sort of."
Honestly thank you so much to everyone who has supported me through writing this, it means so much to me that people actively enjoyed the work. So yeah...not to be sappy by thank you ❤
Harry jerked up in bed, flailing wildly in an attempt to disentangle himself from the stiff, white sheets that were holding him in a faux body bind. He was wet. Soaking wet in fact. Taken-an-impromptu-swim-in-the-Black-Lake wet. The steady drip of sweat onto his matress from his tshirt and hair rung in his ears. A dull twanging thud. Every sound was amplified as his heart hammered in his chest. The voice from his dream was an unrelenting echo in his head.
He growled low in his throat as he drew up his thirteenth numerology table on a crisp piece of fresh parchment. He needed to focus! His years of having his mind invaded by his father had proven useful in teaching him occlumency, yet, he knew how easily distracted he was by Potter and so the more distracted he became the more likely it would be that a wayward thought would slip into Potters head. Perhaps he shouldn't have given Potter such easy access to the legilimency textbooks after all. Draco knew very well how to access whatever shit was going on in Potters head, yet it had been dangerous to give him the tools to access Draco's.
have sex, do you?" Draco snapped, shifting his weight on the sofa, causing a distracting enough movement that Weasely looked up for the first time to meet his eye.
"Fuck Draco, I'm gonna-" he panted against Draco's open mouth as Draco's hips snapped forward, hard.
"He had a wand, he did worse than hit me." Draco growled, failing to keep the bitter resentment out of his voice.
"It's cool, and slippery like silk?" He felt like silk was a stupid comparison for someone's mind. "Not cold though. It's loud in here too but not buzzing it's like...humming?" He frowned. "Oh I caught a thought there!" He had briefly heard an word he didn't recognise floating around. "Malfoy are you deliberately thinking in French so I can't understand?"
"Right then Mr Potter, as for what happened to you." He turned to Draco. "It appears that, unlike yourself Mr Malfoy, Mr Potter is not a strong Occlumens and has limited mental shields. Would it be correct to say that you are well versed in Occlumency?"
Malfoy grinned stupidly at him from under the covers and latched himself onto Harry's back like a parasite, or a child with a giant teddy bear. Harry found he did not mind being treated like a host or a giant teddy bear after all.
McGonagall turned for a moment to shoot a stern look at the two of them, clearing seeing through Malfoy's fake cough and deeming Harry responsible for it, before returning to her speech. "This year on the 13th of October Hogwarts will be hosting a Masquerade Ball also known as the 'Occulatum Ball.' Or 'Hidden' Ball." She continued.
"Merlin! Harry you're so tight and so hot. You're gonna make me come like this." All Harry could do was whimper in return as his orgasm built in the pit of his stomachs threatening to explode.
Malfoy nodded encouragingly behind him and hummed gently. Tentatively, Harry pushed through the tunnel. The feeling inside Malfoy's headspace was definitely different to his own. It was very calm and serene. He could now understand what Malfoy had said about the buzzing in his own head.
Harry hadn't left the house since the trial. He also hadn't spoken to anyone. He had ignored the owls and the visitors at the door and his wards had remained, thankfully, intact. He had a lot of time to think though.
Hope ppl are actually gonna enjoy this, also gonna quickly manifest the guy im sleeping with to fall in love with me bc im sick of his lack of attention bullshit thank you this is my new therapy.
Lydia nodded and scribbled furiously with her quill. "And uh, what would it mean to you to win the Tournament?"
"Hello Harry I know this is a little unorthodox-" she gabbled, yanking Harry by the wrist and shoving herself against him in an alcove. The cold of the stone behind him was more appealing that her warm body against his.
"Bed." Harry managed to croak before the overwhelming intensity rendered him speechless. Draco just nodded and pulled Harry to the bed, pushing him down and straddling him on top of the satin sheets.
Malfoy pulled a away and huffed a laugh. "Come on then Potty, I won't be having complaints that I'm starving you."
Harry knew instantly that he need to go to that trial. Malfoy was never evil. What they had at school had been nothing more than a childish rivalry. The two of them had never really had much of a choice, the side of the war that the Malfoys were on would never have let the two of them become anything more than bitter enemies, their fate was sealed from the minute they laid eyes on each other in Madam Malkins nearly 7 years ago.
"S'cuze me, I wan' Draco." Harry slurred, he had decided fairly soon after waking up that he needed to be kissed by Draco
"Potter it's not a fucking curse it's just legilimency it's not like people bloody die from it and yes someone has used it without our knowledge but it's hardly dangerous. As for uses: it was used for a few other purposes although there are minimal uses of it after the 1320's." Malfoy said pointing lazily at another book he had pulled from the pile which appeared to be an index of recorded use of various types of occlumency.
"I see." He said looking like someone who didn't at all see and was in fact just enjoying Harry's extreme fear and discomfort. He paused for a moment and the frown crept back onto his face. "Well you'll have to keep trying to avoid the topic of conversation." He sighed. "You're not a good enough liar to ease Grangers suspicions so you'll have to avoid the topic altogether. I'm honestly not surprised although I thought you would've lasted longer. Boy wonder can't keep secrets clearly."
“Hello Triwizard champions, my name is Percy, and I’m here to regulate the tournament and guarantee the safety of the three of you. Now, I am obliged to inform you that injury may still be sustained despite our extensive work on safety, it is unavoidable. Although, you were aware of this upon application. An unbiased governing board has also been appointed to review your performances in each task to fairly determine who has earned the most points based on the quality of their performance and therefore who wins each task. I will speak to you before each task commences. Are there any questions?”
The three of them were waiting outside the door along with the rest of the eighth when Harry felt someone creep up behind him.
He called them attacks because that's what they felt like to Harry, although, Hermione called him 'over-dramatic' from the use of the word and Ron called him 'a lucky bastard' for the nature of the attacks.
Harry smiled weakly at Hermione as he walked in with Ron. They were so going to get it for being late to Transfiguration again, even if MacGonagall hadn't noticed it this time. Hermione rolled her eyes at the sight of the two of them and busied herself clearing the chair next to her, presumably for Ron. Harry looked around the room before he made his way to the only empty seat next to Theo Nott. Harry had come to relaise that Nott was genuinely the most kind, soft spoken, and empathetic person he had met and was perpetually confused why exactly Nott was a Slytherin.
Hermione squeaked with laughter. "You are are ridiculous. I just hope you figure it out soon." She didn't say anything after that. She flopped down on Ron's bed as if the whole interrogation had been mentally taxing and exhausting on
"Well he was my second cousin wasnt he? Besides Sev said it was important I met him, he was family."
Harry grinned at him making Draco grin back. The two of them ate more pastries than should be medically possible before heading up to the eigth year tower for bed.
"Has been known to happen." Ron replied lazily. Harry scrambled around searching for his trunk. Of bloody course it was under the bed!
"I've found I quite like them. I spent a lot of time in Muggle London over the summer." He said quietly.
Ron and Hermione had exchanged a few hushed words with him about whether or not their bond had been affected in any way once McGonagall had left which Harry assured them it hadn't, he had come to recognise a light fluttering feeling at the base of his skull to be the magic of the connection and that had remained the same since the day before.
"You know Potter, there are a few other things you could rub if you feel up to i-" he was cut off as Harry smacked his leg.
"I'm a seer. Of sorts." Malfoy sniffed and wiped his face against his shoulder, smudging dirt across his cheek.
He found Ron taking a nap with his bed curtains open when Harry finally made his way back up to their room, weighed down with the legilimency books from library, his bag and robes and both his and Malfoys jumpers. He felt like an overloaded owl.
Draco rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand and let out a shaky breath, glad for the sudden topic change, He wasn’t inclined to have a sniffling session with a Hufflepuff, his pride would be damaged beyond repair. "Yes I do, it's something my father told me about when I was a child, I read all the books I could find about the old tournaments. I have to say it was particularly appealing to me as a young wizard, hearing about battling monsters and the glory of winning the cup. I'm sure many children felt the same.”
He did eventually make it down to breakfast and relived the same conversation with Hermione who had congratulated him on
She laughed again. "Don't worry Harry I understand why it needs to stay a secret for him, with the ministry on his back all the time it must be difficult." She looked sad now. It was true that the ministry were on Malfoy's back, he had been taken away for three days at the beginning if term for borrowing a book from the restricted section in the library that the ministry had deemed 'inappropriate'. Harry was stalking him that day and had seen that it was only an ancient runes book. Eighth years were allowed full access to the restricted section without written permission but clearly the rules were different for Malfoy who had ministry officials on his arse for weeks after.
"I wasn't following him. I just bumped into him s'all. I was minding my own business." Harry complained.
Ron appeared to be in a similar state of panic as he eyed himself in the mirror wearing charcoal suit trousers and experimentally swishing a cobalt cape. Harry had an odd flash back to fourth year although Ron looked less appalled with his outfit.
"Yes it was a fucking accident. You think people will realise? I would take it off but I can't, I'm bloody freezing."
Harry shrugged. "Has been known to happen. Anyway can't sleep, no more beds." He said nonchalantly as he tried (unsuccessfully) to get comfortable in the chair. The chairs in the hospital wing felt as if they were made deliberately to make the occupants want to abandon their sick loved ones in search of comfort.
"This will all help. Do us all a favour: learn to read and then read them." He said indicating the large pile of books. Among the titles he saw
After what felt like an hour but was probably closer to 45 minutes Charms was over and Harry, Hermione and Ron made their way to Defence.
Harry tugged at the drawstrings of the bag, clawing desperately to reach the small potions vial that would be the temporary solution to this fucking mess. He thought he might cry when his fingers made contact with the cold glass.
"Said he'll be here in a minute." Harry nodded to Ron and Hermione as the situated themselves against a wall outside the doors to the Great Hall.
"I nearly died, I think I'm allowed to be a little confused Potter." He snapped playfully. "Can I cuddle you again, I liked that." He added quietly, his voice muffled by the pillow.
Their normal transfiguation classroom had been completely stripped of desks and chairs leaving the expanse of smooth flagstone completely open. Aside from the lack of furniture the only other difference in the room was the all-too-familiar, oversized gramophone from the Yule Ball dance practice in fourth year, still looking a little beaten up for something that spent the majority of its life being molested by Filch. At least Harry assumed that's what happened to it when it wasn't being used to humiliate students and generally make life hellish. Harry snuck a glance at Ron who had gone faintly green at the sight of it, of all terrible things that had happened to him Harry was fairly sure that the Yule Ball dance practice would always have a very special place, high up on Ron's shit list.
Malfoy screamed and cried out as he resisted the potion again. Harry knew that this more potent dose would make it painful for Malfoy to resist rather than just unpleasant. And yet he was still resisting.
Malfoy stumbled back a few steps. "Oh!" He murmmered. "Was that your lie?" All of the anger had flooded from his face as his eyes focused on Harry's. He was now looking only mildly ruffled but was still breathing heavily.
Draco grimaced. "It would appear so." From the bed next to him Harry nodded enthusiastically. "Right! Enough participation from you, I think you've done enough to traumatise your friends enough for the day, dont you think?"
Harry bit his tongue quickly after responding. Was it really a good idea to see Malfoy? They had spent the first month back in their usual way, bumping into each other in corridors, name calling, petty bickering but generally ignoring eachtother. Come to think of it they had barely spoken properly since the trials after the Battle of Hogwarts. Even then that was mindless pleasantries and reluctant thanks from Malfoy for keeping him and his mother out of Azkaban and keeping his father
They were girls. Always girls. Always at least two years younger. And usually Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs or Gryffindors. This one was a Ravenclaw.
Draco nodded and sank further down into the bed. Potter allowed himself to be dragged along and pulled the duvet and blankets up over the two of them.
Thursday started in much the same way as both Tuesday and Wednesday had, with Malfoy's voice ringing through Harry's head. Today it was to remind him to wear his robes as his shivering was apparently 'distracting and unsightly' but Harry now knew that it meant that Malfoy cared about him in his own, very weird, emotionally constipated, twatty pureblood way.
Ron sputtered violently cutting him off. "Mate that's enough I don't wanna hear about you and the ferret going at it thanks." Harry thought that Hermione might hit him again but she seemed to share the sentiment.
Malfoy growled but bit his tongue choosing instead to make an obscene two fingered gesture at Harry. At least he'd learnt
"Well that was rather satisfactory Potty. If your lucky I'll let you do my neck tomorrow." He drawled. He still sounded pretty dozy.
Draco cut her off with a wave of his hand. "Yes, you can call me Draco, Lydia. No need to be so nervous." He smiled, hoping that perhaps the action would make him appear less like an intimidating ex-death eater and more like a normal eighteen-year-old boy.
Ron pursed his lips and looked pointedly at Harry. "I think the fact that you chose to ask shows what you think the answer is. But yes mate I think it went both ways."
"Vidal Morales," McGonagall called out. A tall, athletically built boy with broad shoulders and narrow hips emerged from the crowd of Beauxbatons students. The dancing glare of the enchanted candles suspended overhead appeared to be mirrored in his dark skin. He tugged at one of the twin braids hanging from his head down to his waist as he walked down the aisle to the front of the hall to receive the same greeting from McGonagall. He too stopped to wave one last time and gave an obnoxious bow before leaving through the door, swishing sky blue Beauxbatons robes as he went.
Draco hadn't considered the fact that the connection between them was already strong enough to allow dreams to slip through but he considered that his attraction to Potter along with the completed life debt may pertain to a stronger emotional connection than he had originally considered.
Malfoy snapped now after seeing the enraged response. His face had flushed bright pink and he was breathing heavily."REALLY YOU'RE SO FUCKING GREAT? TELL ME A LIE NOW GO ON!"
By the time they made it both of them were panting and breathing heavily however, Harry realised that even the physical exercise couldn't warm him up and he was still bloody freezing. He'd never really dealt with the cold that well. When he Ron and Hermione spent time together it was always him and Hermione squabbling over blankets or the closest seat to the fire or over Ron's jumpers. Ron normally didn't even bother wearing them let alone robes and somehow slept most nights on top of the duvet. Even the thought of it gave Harry the chills.
"Mr Malfoy I will ask you again. Why was the safety of Mr Potter more important than your own life?"
Hermione reached across and squeezed Harry's knee. He had gone a ghostly white and was staring fixated at his hands in his lap. Malfoy
Ron nodded thoughtfully. "Alright mate. I am going to ask you a question and you need to focus on the first name that comes into your head. Who would you
"So what's going on then?" Harry asked. He relaised it was a stupid question. Merlin! of course it was a bloody stupid question. Clearly neither he nor Malfoy had any clue what was happening.
Harry growled low in his throat before standing up on the bench. "This!" He shouted, waving the Prophet in the air. "Is bullshit." The hall murmered but stayed quiet, great they probably thought he was bloody mental now! That seemed to happen everytime he tried to deny a Prophet rumour. Harry growled again, of course he would have to prove it, they couldn't just believe him.
Draco sighed. “Theo if I had told you then you would’ve told Daph and then she would somehow let slip to Pansy, you know how she is with secrets considering that we all regrettably know
"Yes Mione. That's because the owner of the jumper is bigger than me. Thought you would've guessed that." He growled.
"Oh come on Harry just ignore it. You've dealt with worse." Hermione huffed and grabbed his arm, pulling him along like a disobedient toddler.
"Beacuase I love him!" Malfoy choked out. "Becuase I fucking love him! I couldn't let him die, wouldn't!"
By the time he made it back to the eigth year tower his head was swimming with questions. Should he have enjoyed that more than he did? He knew it was unexpected but would any other guy have taken the opportunity with that girl? She was clearly trying to come on to him and he'd pushed her away and run off, would most guys have stayed? He shook the thoughts off as he made his way back up to his room and collapsed on his bed. So what did this all mean then? Harry closed his eyes and tried to ignore the swimming questions in his head. He wasn't supposed to be having a crisis over this. Eventually the thoughts in his head slowed down long enough for him to drift off to sleep.
Draco's heart hammered in his chest as he was met with hesitant applause from the older Hogwarts students. However, it was more than compensated for by the younger years and the foreign students who cheered with the same enthusiasm for him as they had for the other champions. He felt giddy as he tried to calmly walk to the front of the hall, tugging at his shirt sleeves and avoiding the scrutinising glares from those not applauding, hoping no one had the balls to hex him.
The scream that left Malfoy's lips was blood curdling. The whole court felt the pain and anguish behind it as it echoed through the circular room.
"Malfoy please wake up. Fuck. Please. What happened to you? Who attacked you? I don't know how to fix it." He was frantically undoing his shirt to expose the wound more clearly.
