Harry drags himself up, leaving Draco curled on his side on the rug, and goes to the kitchen to get a glass of cold water (no ice, just a Chilling Charm) and some of that French dark chocolate (two pieces per orgasm) Draco likes.
“Do you think he can hear me?”
and within the confines of Harry’s four-poster, he finally lets Malfoy take the cloak off.
"Come on," Harry presses. "I've got all kinds of charms up my sleeve, she'll never know I'm there."
-ing another beer from the kitchen and popping the cap off, "he invented this completely insane spell that made anyone who came within a few yards of the cursed object start fighting, pretty violently usually." He takes a sip of his beer and then points it at Malfoy, straight-faced. "You're like the human embodiment. Causing strife and chaos wherever you go. They don’t usually fight like this anymore."
“Yeah,” Harry says. “So fuck—you’re so gorgeous, Draco.”
"Armond," he says and shakes her hand with a strong grip. "Armond Blewitt, down on Potions and Plants. Draco referred a case to me just yesterday, been here most of the night running tests."
Pansy believes that some fault likely lies with Potter — he's a hot-headed moron and probably has very little control over his urges. She also believes that
For good measure he gives his wandless magic one more go to no avail, and finally gives into the strong urge to take his heavy Auror robes off. Irritated, he simply lets them fall to the floor and then follows, sliding down the side of the lift to sit in the corner, not unlike a grumpy child.
Draco says, "I can do without the pleasure of Granger's company outside the workplace if it means avoiding you. Inside of it too, perhaps, after tonight. You do realise she enticed us here in the hopes of some jovial festivities? Merlin, must all the women in my life be so fucking conspiratorial?"
On the verge of sniping back, Harry just manages to rein himself in. There’s no point letting Malfoy taunt him into yet another fight. “Why don’t you relax with the witty banter for a minute,” Harry says, “and make us some tea, yeah? I’m exhausted.”
Harry hums around Draco’s cock in approval, bobbing steadily with one hand wrapped around the base and the other fingering him into pure liquid want.
“I will,” he says, and means it. He loves seeing Charlie with his dragons. “Maybe I’ll come in January too. Kinda need to get the fuck out of here for a while, I think.”
Because he’s determined to make Potter yield, Draco says, “I doubt there’ll be much talking, but thanks.”
“You can’t leave me here with him!” Harry protests.
She isn’t usually one to gripe about work — it’s boorish — but she’s been going nonstop the last couple weeks while they transition head of operations from Paris to London. She is in some respects glad to be back home, but Merlin, it’s strange.
“Right,” Harry says absently. “A cock.”
“Neither,” Draco drawls. “It’s a
"Mind if I kiss you?" he says, because Harry had become more attractive in the months they spent together, less drawn and grey, less lanky and more wiry, and he's only gotten more so since. Soft lips, proper cheekbones. Beautiful eyes and long lashes. Charlie has a thing, for eyelashes. “Don’t mean to take advantage, you just, you know. Seem like you could use a good snog.”
Draco shrugs. “Find them.”
He stands and grabs up his Auror robes to hold them strategically so they cover his crotch. And he
Harry frowns. “At least I’m not all coy —” he sweeps his hand about his head. “Coy.”
Harry thinks he might be broken. He also thinks about sucking a cock clothed in fine lace and damp with precome into his mouth. Thin straps of elastic slid down cream coloured thighs—
Draco’s sure it’s just the lack of proper lubrication that’s making him feel utterly split open by Potter’s (average sized, definitely) cock. That, and the way it’s being reamed into his spit-slicked hole.
Draco says, "Of course." He's not quite in the mood for Granger's particular brand of support and general niceness, this afternoon. He's been here since three PM yesterday.
Harry's stomach turns. Maybe he does hate him.
Still straddling Harry’s hips, Draco looks down at him, twisting his fingers in the cool, slippery sheets. After a moment of thought, he says, “Love you, too.”
“Of course not, Potter,” Draco says. “You haven’t the arse for it.”
Draco’s hand twitches when Potter mentions his wand. He shifts it back under his thigh. “You’re welcome, then.”
The thing about nighttime wanderings is that the body gets used to them. Tiredness has evolved from a desire to sleep into a kind of dull torpor that lives far enough away from his brain for it to be ignored. Far more prominent is the restlessness. So Draco walks across the grounds until the forest seems to find him, spinous edges of a path that crawl towards his feet.
"If I was," he says eventually, "would it matter? I'm really good when I'm with you. Mentally, I mean. I feel less—" he gropes for the right word, considering carefully "—untethered. And I'm not trying — I'm not saying I'm some kind of — like it's your responsibility. Or something. I just mean ... it's easier. All of it." He gestures vaguely, encompassing everything he's ever confided to Charlie in the impelling darkness of night. "Not everything lasts. You can't just not do stuff 'cause it'll end someday."
Draco says, “At what point does coincidence become stalking?”
It’s a Friday in July, and it’s past twelve now, surely, and Ron’s probably put away four kebabs at least, and Hermione will be reaching up to wipe his eyes when he reaches the inevitable sentimental-teary stage of his intoxication, and there’s a something with a heavy beat playing over the speakers in the club, and Harry is kissing Draco Malfoy.
“This is most irregular. We’re hardly dating,” Draco says.
“I think I’m about to fall down,” Harry says, because it’s four am and he’s still really high.
“Ah,” says Harry. “Of course. Tell you what,” he leans down on his elbows as well, lifting a brow at Draco, “I’ll let it go for now, but you have to tell me something else about yourself.”
“Didn’t catch that.” Harry licks again.
Draco says, “Ha, ha,” and makes a shameless grab for Harry’s hand. His eyes are screwed shut with the raw, sensitive pleasure of having his recently-fucked ass toyed with, but he manages to make contact and tug in the direction of his throat.
“Oh. It was funny,” Harry offered.
hex it out of him, and he plans to enjoy it while it lasts. “I’m not telling either of you,” he says. “There’s really nothing to tell.”
to come," Pansy says, all tinkling laughter and dark eyes. "We don't do pubs as a rule —" she gestures around vaguely "— sort of bourgeois, don't you think? I told him he
Harry says, “The experience was mutual.”
Ron has the good grace to look a little sheepish about that. Hermione had told him, though she only got about halfway in before Ron clapped his hands over his ears, and no amount of scolding him about how he’s a father now and shouldn’t be acting like he’s five literal years old could get him to remove them.
Slick and slurred around Harry’s fingers, “Oh, Merlin,
. I'm not going anywhere near Potter and his mediocre cock ever. Again," says Draco vehemently. He means it, he really does. Despite the fact that he'd sort of, er, goaded Potter into fucking him in the first place (which Pansy really doesn't need to know), he's adamant that it won't happen again.
"Is it?" he says, tugging the belly ring again. This close, he can just see Malfoy's tongue between his pink lips. He wants to punch him and he wants to taste the inside of his mouth. It's very confusing. "What verb would you use, then?"
you doing here, Malfoy?”
. Draco tilts his face up, his hands finding Potter’s jaw. He says, “Could I kiss you?”
There’s something in the way Potter’s looking at him. Draco’ll be fucked before he makes that assumption, though. “I’m out,” he says.
...?”
He takes a careful step forwards to compensate for Malfoy's, and at least he's had
Knowing it would be most politic to shift the discussion away from what happened at the end of that tournament, Draco says, “So your saviour complex came in handy for once? That must be very validating.”
Harry makes a disgruntled noise. He’s been told he has a very nice arse (on more than one occasion), thankyouverymuch.
“You know you’re being really annoying about this,” says Harry, inspecting a platter of chocolate-covered biscuits. “Don’t you?”
Draco whines.
“I’m a disgrace, aren’t I? An outrage to the Malfoy name,” Draco says. And then, more simply, when Potter doesn’t say anything, “I like cock.”
After a few moments of waiting and contemplating a strategy, Harry says, "It's okay to miss them. They're your parents."
“I’ll have to— things to organise,” says Draco. His hand flutters up to his hairline. “I’ll have to ask Pansy.”
Draco doesn’t really want any more wine. What he wants is to make Potter do that jaw-clenchy thing some more, so he throws up his arms and makes a whiny noise from the back of his throat that Blaise always tells him sounds like a dying Crup.
Malfoy's magic doesn't work, because he wants to get the fuck out of here. But he
“No! Absolutely not. You have to find out for sure.”
“Gagging is far too aggressive of a verb,” he says.
"Yeah," he says. He stares at him another second, wondering at the disappointment he feels. "Whatever. See you, Malfoy."
Draco does; Harry lets him buck and writhe and fuck up into his mouth and cry, hot desperate streams hitting the back of his throat. Harry waits until Draco’s finished, hips fallen back to the floor, and pulls off him with a delicate kiss.
“Oh,” says Draco. “To be perfectly honest, I forgot you were there. Didn’t you finish last for that challenge?”
“Nghh,” Draco says.
The whole thing made him feel claustrophobic. When he went to escape into the yard, Harry was crying on the back steps. Charlie hardly knew him, but he sat down anyway. "Alright?"
He can tell George is trying to keep things a bit surfacy, though, so he just says, “Yeah.”
“Thrilling,” Harry mutters. He pushes his sleeves, which have started sagging, back up to the elbow and grabs his beer. “Are we sure Malfoy didn’t encourage him to do it? So he could sell the extra liver on some black market? Sounds like classic Draco to me.”
"Oh!" says Dean. "Don't eat their jackets—"
"What do you mean?"
“Mm,” Harry agrees. He pulls out gently — “
year?" Harry says, thinking back and trying to imagine having been comfortable enough with himself at that point to have sex with someone. Even if he hadn't been entirely focused on the tournament, he still doesn't think he would have. He'd barely been able to ask Cho to the ball. "Shit, with who?"
Draco clears his throat. “Well. Fine.”
His eyes are closed, the column of his pale throat exposed. “Another ten points.”
“And you’re hopeless at knowing when to stop,” Hermione says (she doesn’t like to swear, unless it’s in relation to the Ministry and their ‘piss-weak stance on Elvish welfare’).
Harry laughs, amused, horny, and rendered exhausted by Draco’s ever-shifting mood. “Yes,” he says. “Are you suggesting I punch you?”
enough to start getting over it, and I'm not sure he's trying to be. Do you know what I mean?"
“So hard,” Draco murmurs. He helps Harry pull his jeans (ugh) down his thighs, and mouths at the bulge beneath his pants. “Gonna make you come,” says Draco.
“Sorry?” Harry tries. And then smiles, because—
Draco smells too good. Too much man and sweat and expensive shampoo. And Harry can’t seem to force himself from the crook of Draco’s neck, laving at the skin below his ear and hearing taught exhales and soft whines in his own.
“Our little Draco doesn’t have it in him, do you, darling?” She laughs again when he wriggles away from her and pinches his arm for good measure. “He told me Potter got a bit dommy on him,” she says, grinning wickedly.
"No. No, I just don't think— it doesn't seem very, fuck no offence mate, but it doesn't seem likely, the way you're talking about him."
"You two are exceptionally dull," Blaise tells them. It's not a tragedy or anything — there are plenty of people in his club he can get off with. Bit of a shame, though. He'd been rather in the mood for some quality time with his two oldest friends. "Don't let him fuck Potter. And you don't fuck him either, you utterly depraved twat."
Draco crosses the leg closest to Potter over the other. Fucking little cunt. He says, “It sounds like you’re trying to tell me I’m desperate for your Chosen fucking cock, or whatever, and I’m sure I’m mistaken, so feel free to elucidate.”
Harry frowns. “What, what’s that look? I got you your wand back,” he reminds him, eyebrows lifting. “I thought you’d be slightly more excited.”
“No,” Harry says quickly. She frowns a little. “That’s alright. I’m fine.”
“Hm?”
“How do I know what Slytherins get up to?"
“I’m still angry with him,” Harry says candidly and sits down next to Malfoy. The honesty makes his stomach hurt. Until now he’s hardly admitted that to himself, always finding ways to distract himself when he starts thinking about it. “Been avoiding it, I guess.”
The night he finds Malfoy sitting in the seventh-floor corridor outside the Room of Requirement is the first week back from holidays and it gives him a sense of overwhelming déja vu. It's two am and that's another one of the spots he's been avoiding, but this particular circumstance seems like the right one to go face it. Besides, he sort of feels like seeing Malfoy. He hasn't since the forest last month.
to be charming, but still is. Hermione's mostly interested in Draco's dislike, though. It's kind of cute. "You've good taste, Draco. Roqberry is one of my favourites."
The surprise on Harry’s face is due not to the revelation but rather the fact Malfoy is telling him. He wonders suddenly whether Malfoy knows that that particular information has been through the Hogwarts rumour mill more than once. Never confirmed, of course, but speculated by plenty.
“He, oh, fuck, again Harry please, killed Ladon and — Hera placed his, ah, image in the sky, around the North Pole.”
“But then we wouldn’t have gotten to try your lovely tampnad,” Weasley says earnestly, and Granger punishes him by dumping a spoonful of it on his plate.
“Knew you’d show up tonight,” he says from the steps. He looks good, as usual; there’s a bandage on his arm, probably from a bad burn. The comfort of his presence is immediate and profound. “George set up a trap for you, by the way. I’d go round the front if I were you and didn’t want my hair strangling me.”
"Oh, I don't think that's necessary," Pansy says. She pulls on her skirt, tucks her blouse into it, and goes to sit beside Draco, where she takes his chin and places a kiss on his cheek. "I forgot I'd asked you to come. We were only going to try and bribe you into joining our little orgy. I suppose we could do dinner instead?"
“That’s —
(See the end of the chapter for
And with that she marches off back upstairs with Rose.
Harry feels an odd combination of emotions: pity, guilt, sympathy. Even some vindictiveness. His twelve-year-old self would have given anything to hear Malfoy admit he was jealous. He thinks he
Harry turns Draco at the hips, hears the thunk of his palms bracing on the wood as he tugs Draco’s trousers to pool around his ankles.
Harry sighs again, and releases his temples. “Right. So you spent I-don’t-think-I-want-to-know-how-many Galleons for an I-don’t-think-I-want-to-know-how-illegal Charms specialist to come and replicate an stupidly complex, potentially dangerous ancient Mirroring Charm on your living room ceiling, because you want to look at the stars, and it’s too cold to go outside.”
Draco sniffs. “My parents were thrice removed,
“That waiter is clearly a troglodyte,” Blaise drawls. “And it has nothing to do with their fucking disgraceful oysters. Let’s go to The Rooftop, I need fresh air.”
Draco sips the Roserum, relishing in the wash of syrupy warmth and rose water, the sharp tang of liquor. "Splendid, Pans."
Harry laughs openly. This is weird, so he laughs. Malfoy—
“They decided awaiting judgment in Azkaban was time served.”
Harry rolls his eyes. "Fine," he says and hits it again. The smoke sits in front of them in the stagnant night air, sticky and potent. "God forbid you ever unclench for half a second."
"I'm not getting involved with him," he says. From the fridge he grabs a beer and tosses the cap into the bin a little too roughly. "And I'm not forgiving him for anything that he hasn't apologised for. But I do think he's grown up, all right?" He pauses, then says, "He's got this belly button ring."
-minding?" Pansy echoes, completely taken aback. She lets out a surprised laugh, which snowballs into something loud and ringing and gets a chuckle out of Blaise before finally tapering off. "Oh, don't be silly, Draco, you've no affinity for children. Come," she ushers them both towards the door, "you can tell us who you were shagging on the way out. I'm thinking seafood, what about you, Blaise?"
“Like that, pet. And if you stop, I’ll stop.”
“No,” Blaise says defiantly. “We won’t. I can’t believe you’ve told Pansy and not me. Are we even friends, Draco? Potter makes you
at my misfortune. It's unbecoming. I had dinner with Granger and the Weasel the other night, and Potter was there. Naturally, he was enraptured by the way I've grown into my fabulous looks, and I happened to notice. And, you know, point it out. Don't enfeeble me for not telling you earlier. You've been bloody busy this week."
He sits down next to Malfoy and, surprising himself, takes out the map and hands it over. He doesn't see why he shouldn't — he'll be gone from Hogwarts after this term, and it's not like there's any real trouble to get up to anymore. "I only used it this time. And it
“Can’t think,” Draco pants. “While you’re doing that.”
remorse rather than all the horrible things he did back then.” He pauses and feels his stomach do an uncomfortable jolt, a nauseating feeling rising in his throat. “I’m completely infatuated, Charlie.”
Harry slicks his cock and slides into Draco in an easy, languorous thrust, fingers pondering the dimples on either side of his spine before finding purchase on slim, delicate hips.
George smirks. He lifts his feet obligingly but then brings them back down on Ron's lap. "What's the haps, little brother?"
“Hey,” he says, looking around just in case. “Myrtle's not coming back, is she?”
"Quite," says Draco. He doesn’t bother make mention of the fact that he’s actually been home barely a month, because the demented coot will only find a way to twist it to his agenda. "A ghastly oversight on my part. I'll triage my diary. Make room for some family time in the new year."
Draco waves a hand at his robes, popping one shoulder blade to rest against the wall of the still-halted lift. “I see no appeal in your bedraggled aesthetic.” He tilts his head. “Though I expect, perhaps, it might be rather handy.”
“Gladly,” Draco says, reclining on one of the only things kept from the Manor when he packed everything up after Narcissa moved to France. A sprawling Kashan rug, with intricate swirls in dark teal and navy and pale gold.
Dominique may be a useless little sycophant, but she’s awfully quick. “You can’t go in there, Mr Malfoy,” she says, hand curling around Draco’s on the knob of Pansy’s heavy mahogany door. “She’s on a Floo call.”
to lighten the mood adds, "I'm hungry as hell and Neville's treacle tart tastes better than Malfoy's arse. And that's saying something."
?” Harry chokes out, grip loosening. Instinctively he thinks he knows what Malfoy’s getting at but that does nothing in the way of helping him process it.
“Don’t fret, Potter. It’ll give you wrinkles,” says Draco, reaching up to give him a delicate flick on the top of his scar.
"It's all right, darling, his mother couldn't stop his tantrums either, I'd hardly expect you to. Come in, Draco," she says to him, gesturing him into her office. "Dominique, fetch us some tea and you can leave for the night."
“Likewise, Mother,” Draco says. “There’s not much to tell,” because he’d sooner move back into the Manor and Lucius’s private wing than tell his mum that Potter sort-of-fucked him in a lift, and everything else that’s happened since.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” says Malfoy. His cheeks are pink, but he’s looking at Harry now. “I know nothing of any book about your heroic exploits, and if I did, I wouldn’t go near it with a ten foot broomstick.”
“Not at all. It’s an important part of Muggle culture. Like, you know, Quidditch is for us.”
“Draco!” she chirps. “I’m so glad you came, come on in.”
, things seem to get worse."
Pansy lifts an eyebrow at him. Her stomach sinks a bit. "What? Draco, what?"
. She knew we’d fuck off if she gave us any longer.”
Draco, who hadn’t spared much thought to his post-Hogwarts accommodation (he’s no shortage of access to extra bedrooms — half his friends are scions to manors and castles across Europe), is temporarily dumb with disbelief.
Malfoy shakes his head. “No.”
Draco laughs, but there’s no humour in it. “That Monday, I had a hearing. They were deciding whether to end or extend my probation. Guess which they chose.”
"Well?" she drawls. "It had better be good."
"My sort?" she drawls. "What, a lesbian?"
Draco takes up his gin and tonic the minute it's set on the table and takes a long, pensive sip. He says, "Yes."
“No,” Draco agrees. “I suppose you wouldn’t.” He walks through the door Potter’s holding for him. The kitchens are big and high-ceilinged, with rows of cluttered workstations and brass cookware on hooks from its stone walls. “Perhaps a toss off.”
Unlike Potter (who had thrown off his robes without so much as a thought to what the sight of his browned, bare forearms would do to Certain People’s brain function), Draco knows exactly what he’s doing when he unbuttons his. Shrugs them off both shoulders, and stretches his arms over his head so they drop to the floor (the hideously thick lime green canvas will crinkle something awful, but it’s worth it for dramatic effect.)
Harry says, "Brilliant," as he steps into the Floo.
you!”
, but that's different. It's about getting off. Ever heard of hate sex? Potter could take out all that Gryffindorian moral outrage on you. In fact," she grins again, "I might be persuaded to pay you a healthy sum of gold to watch that memory a few times."
If anything, Blaise is surprised it’s taken a whole month for this to happen. He doesn’t like seeing him this way, but also he’s hardly as much fun when he’s sulking. Especially over Potter.
Harry releases Malfoy’s wrist and lets his own arm drop. He looks between his eyes, tries to see something there beyond the cold anger, but he’s not easy to read. “If that were true,” says Harry, “you wouldn’t have had sex with me in the first place. Try again.”

“Just satisfied after a lovely night with my girlfriend. We’ve been expanding our horizons. You see, evidently the Muggles have this incredible thing they call
Until Potter’s vague motion, Draco hadn’t realised where they were. His mother had told him what happened here one night before their trials, as frail and grief-stricken as he’d ever seen her.
"Am I," says Harry somewhat drily. "Care to elaborate?"
“Very much so,” he says. “Now we’ve got that out of the way, can we talk about your husband? I know you want me here for Christmas lunch tomorrow Mother, but if he continues to bother me, I shan’t stay.”
A man in black denim overalls with no shirt beneath deposits two drinks, salt rimmed and clear, on the table in front of Malfoy.
, and the worst.
Malfoy hums around his straw. “Earning it back would hardly be strenuous, Potter.” Hm. Harry wishes Malfoy hadn’t asked for a straw.
“There’s not much to tell,” she says dismissively. “I’d like to hear more about it, if that’s alright. You know he’s a good person to have an association with, don’t you? He doesn’t ... surely he can’t blame you for ...?”
“Ah, Potter,” Draco tuts. “I know everything.”
“Right,” Harry says quietly, too low for Malfoy to hear. He watches him walk out towards the water while he tries to figure out what the fuck is going on here.
“Potter,” she says jovially. Her heels come to a clicking halt beside him. “Granger. Weasel. Lovely ... really lovely. You’ve all been well, I hope?”
Harry holds the smoke in far longer than necessary, mostly to give himself time. If only he'd learnt to think before doing things, that would have been a big help right now.
“Don’t gripe," says Blaise. "It’ll give you wrinkles.”
“D’you remember that time I saved you from a lake?” Ron mumbles.
Instinct makes him pull away when Malfoy touches his shoulder — he feels kind of bad after he does it, but he doesn’t know how to explain that it’s not
“You’re such a cunt,” Draco spits, twisting around in Harry’s grip to try and get more friction on his cock. “You’re a fucking cunt.”
“Going to fuck you so hard you can’t talk. Can’t
“What? How?”
Draco says, “How about this,” and twists himself so he can press his bare chest to Harry’s and nuzzle at his neck. “I’ll talk about the stars until you get hard again, and then you can edge me ‘till I can’t even remember which
Harry shakes his head, trying to rid himself of the mental image. "Gross," he says. "When was your first time with a bloke?"
"Oh, yeah, sure," says Harry,
Harry blinks, surprised by what looks like genuine irritation on Malfoy's face suddenly rather than pure mockery.
“You know the rules, pet,” Harry says, gently licking at Draco’s cock.
”See you,” Harry says when Malfoy gets up. He wishes he wouldn’t leave but doesn’t stop him when he does, because he’s not really sure what the point would be.
“You mustn’t keep these things from me, Draco,” says Blaise. He sandwiches himself on Pansy’s other side (Draco would be surprised at the sudden peace-making, if they didn’t bicker this way literally all the fucking time) and starts rubbing her arm in an attempt to warm it up. “I find it very upsetting.”
"Sober me," he says, making up his mind right then, because he's certain this wouldn't be happening if he weren't drunk. He could've side-stepped this whole conversation very neatly indeed, and his stupid, fuzzy brain wouldn't be making him feel things he'd rather not.
, Cancer’s just by the Moon, which is why you can’t see it as well. But it’s got the Beehive Cluster, which has, hm, thousand stars, or something.”
Lastly, Ron's good at giving him space when he wants it, and more importantly, being there when he needs it, even when he doesn't know how to ask for it. Like tonight.
“Fascinating witticisms
It's been a snowy first week of December, but the floor of the Forbidden Forest is only lightly powdered with it thanks to the roof of thick, tangled branches. Not even enough to leave footprints behind. Harry had gone in still undecided whether he actually wanted to find the clearing again or not, but the decision is made for him when he looks around suddenly and realises he's in it. By the light of his wand he can even see a Death Eater mask sitting at the foot of a tree, leaning up against the trunk.
“I know how to
"Mm," says Draco. "I'm sure you will. Give it to me, then."
“The Hercules constellation, shit, it’s up there. Near Draco.”
“It’s the disparity, don’t you think?” Draco says, and Harry knows the chocolate must’ve done its job if Draco can use words like
"S'pose so. Prickly fuck, is he? Like his dad?"
they’re in.”
“Wow,” Ron drones, stabbing his fork into a piece of chicken and sending the tapenade a dirty look. “France, Harry, did you hear that? Must be where he learned to make the tampanod.”
There’s a moment of silence that draws out, both Pansy and Blaise waiting for more, until Blaise says, “
Draco pulls himself up on his elbows, so he's leaning out of the bath and water sloshes over the lip and Pansy glares at him for getting it on her shoes. "Pansy," he says. "No."
“Oh, right. I could … “ Harry hesitates, thinking through the repercussions of what he wants to offer. There are ... a lot. “I have the invisibility cloak. I could — erm — sneak you into my. Erm. Dorm?”
Draco himself is often (right now) of the opinion that Pansy's a wretched harpy, but his mouth still curls into a snarl when Potter insults her. "Oh?" he says, voice dripping in derision. "And what, pray tell, were you going to say to me during this visit?"
“Oh.” Harry looks past Malfoy at the mask lying against the tree trunk and thinks that it’s highly ironic he can’t even look it at. Of course he doesn’t say that — he gets up and goes over to it, picks it up, turns it over in his hands. He’s never looked at one up close; it’s pristine still, probably Charmed not to scratch. He wonders whose it might have been but doesn’t dwell on it, tossing it into the blackness of the forest beyond the clearing.
Draco resents being told what to do, but he supposes, if they’re both stuck there, they may as well have some tea. He’ll just spit in Potter’s cup, or something.

, Harry wants to say. Instead he smirks, and wraps a fist around Draco’s cock. The sarcastic tilt of Draco’s mouth melts back into something pliant and soft.
“Tapenade, Ronald,” Hermione repeats, flashing him a dangerous look over her shoulder. “It’s French.” Harry’s still glaring at Malfoy: he should know his audacity, that Harry absolutely does not approve of this, would in fact approve of the giant
Draco moans quietly in lieu of an answer — nipping at Harry’s jaw — as Harry grips his arse tight and hooks a thumb over the waistband of his trousers.
. Maybe I will go and see Blaise. You and your cold, unsympathetic heart will rue the day, Pans, when Blaise knows and you don’t, and it’ll serve you—
In times like those, Harry just wants to pick Draco up and shake him until he agrees to take better care of himself. And then make him some tea and read to him in bed. So maybe it is endearing, but less in a you’re-absolutely-mental-Draco, snog-me-right-now kind of way, and more in a let-me-stroke-your-hair-until-you-fall-asleep kind of way. Whatever.
“Can’t,” Harry says, “Boot spilled it all over me.”
. The lift with Malfoy had been so rushed and clumsy and he hadn't finished, notably, and Charlie has warm hands and feels familiar when Harry pulls him down on top of him.
He watches Draco go through several different emotions that he can't quite name, but it's the question — the disbelief in it, the underlying hopelessness — that makes Harry sad. "Of course I'm not," he says, frowning. "I watched Kingsley sign off on it earlier and McGonagall's really happy about it, I don't think she's eager to give them a chance to change their minds. They can't," he adds quickly, seeing Draco's face. "It's done." He kisses Draco's cheek. "You're welcome."
The extra dig about coasting through life makes his grip on the clipboard tighten. He gestures again to the door, trying hard not to let his anger make him do anything stupid, but his voice still comes out sounding too much like he’s in an interrogation room with a criminal: “Get in the fucking room, Malfoy. Now. Don’t make me say it again.”
“And he’s well?” she asks weakly.
"Have a nice day, Healer Granger," the receptionist says as she's leaving, and Hermione doesn't bother returning the sentiment.
It’s an interesting thought, actually, and not one he’s had before — obvious reasons, like he hadn’t questioned anything about his sexuality up until quite recently. But with Draco’s nails on his back and stirring up a kind of angry arousal he hasn’t ever felt before, he’s not thinking about that so much.
terms, definitely not like this, and that prospect is looking thin now. Plus he's reminded that Malfoy is the fucking worst and no amount of begging and whinging with a cock up his arse can change that. "We're gonna have to see each other, you realise that, right? Since you've decided to be mates with Hermione?"
who’ll be polishing off that Galleon.”
"This room looks empty," Harry says, heading over to it. "Shall we?"
In his gut Harry feels a ghost of the old hatred. It’s Malfoy, after all. Bratty, malicious, elitist, bullying Malfoy who always got so much joy out of shitting on Ron for not having money and Hermione for the status of her blood purity.
“Thank your fucking stars he hasn’t got your wife fooled, too,” Ron says. He doesn’t really mean it, because as if a slimy prat like Malfoy could ever pull one over on Hermione, but whatever. He’s ranting. “Even when Harry inevitably gets over the fact that he’s, you know, blond and an arsehole and therefore exactly his type, I’m still at risk of coming home to find Malfoy sitting at my kitchen table. Fuck me. And fat chance, since when has anyone ever been able to talk Harry out of anything?”
“Yeah,” says Harry, looking back at the house. He hates that he feels the tug of irrational jealousy or irritation or
“It’s an olive dip,” says Granger.
“Stars,” he prompts.
“What did you mean?”
She's at work, thankfully. Ron's home with the baby, which works to Harry's advantage since Ron can't throttle him or whatever if he's holding his kid.
be a bit bedraggled when he feels like it. Plus the colour has always been too close to Dudley's old Smeltings uniform for his comfort — all it needs is a cane. Right now, he would use it to beat Malfoy to death, probably.
Ron's hair is still in tact when he goes back into the kitchen, Rose now happily suckling on the bottle Harry's holding for her. "How disastrous would it be, d'you think, if I fucked him again? Properly, though, like, just to get it out of my system, right?"
Of course, Pansy wouldn't understand. Draco himself doesn't quite understand. He just knows that wanting Potter in any capacity leaves him vulnerable, and vulnerability is something that should always be avoided in dealings with ones enemies.
“Is Harry okay?”
Harry snorts. “Sure, whatever. Come on.”
He might have retorted but Harry actually feels oddly sorry for him in the same uncomfortable way he had when he'd found Malfoy crying in Myrtle's bathroom. Sure, he's always been a massive fucking prick for no reason, but he's also been through some fucked up shit lately and getting disowned seems like unfairly rubbing the wound with salt. It only makes Harry more bitter towards the Ministry, towards
So far he’s exhausted several possibilities — had Ron gotten his letter from the Aurors early (no), was there another secret Weasley sibling trapped in the attic of the Burrow (no, probably not.)
Lucius. At all. He spent a lot of time wishing he was. But he's not." Harry shoves his hands in his pockets. "I told him I don't hate him and he said he doesn't know how to talk to me. I don't even know what the hell that means."
The kitchen bench is pressing against him, a firm line on his lower back. He wasn’t sure if this is what he wanted to happen when he started poking, but regardless, he’s rather pleased with the results. If he could only get Potter to move that frightfully calloused hand of his a little closer to his hip.
“Shall we make it interesting?” Hermione smirks.
“Of course,” Draco says. He waves a lazy hand. “But what with the way you’ve been staring at me, I’d dismissed it as a possibility.”
Pansy laughs lightly — it
"Of course not," Pansy agrees. She doesn't push it, because it seems pointless to make him admit it out loud if it is true, even partially.
"I know Hermione's put you up to this," Harry says bluntly. "She's so fucking freaked out about the whole thing, it's driving me nuts. I mean, look, I get that Natalie was a shit show and you two are eternally worried now, okay? And I get that I don't exactly have a nice past with Malfoy, that none of us do, but I need to figure this out, Ron." His cheeks are warm, his heart pumping a little faster. "Without Hermione taking notes every step of the way, if possible. I just ..." He lets out a deep sigh and presses his palms into his eyes until he sees popping lights. "I can't stop thinking about him."
“Wanna fuck you properly.”
“Flash the scar,” Draco suggests. “She’ll be gagging for it.”
Harry mouths up to his pulse and bites down hard while his hands go to work undoing and then slipping inside Draco’s pants. “I’d venture to guess I’m a bit quicker,” he says, fingers curling around his cock. “Beat you every time, didn’t I?”
“Shut up,” says Draco.
"I'm not the one inventing things!" Harry yells before Malfoy's even gotten his last word out. He doesn't want to explain that whatever Malfoy had said to Hermione had caused her to use words like 'toxic' and 'unhealthy' and fret over his mental health, and it hadn't felt that way in the lift. Not lovely or tender, maybe, but at least
"What a shame for her." Draco thinks Potter bites harder when he talks about McLaggen.
“I tried to slap him,” says Draco. He still doesn’t really feel bad about it, just a bit funny behind his ribs.
Draco says, “Can’t we just fuck again?”
He can’t blame Pansy for neglecting her tea. Dominique’s swill always tastes like some variation on diluted piss (although Draco’s has probably been spat in. So.)
Cunting shit. “Hullo Malfoy,” Harry says.
"Of course. I didn't realise our little tryst was to be kept so hush-hush."
After a moment, he says, "Is it a secret Slytherin requirement, then, that you can't be heterosexual?" And then, "Daphne's fit. Greengrass, yeah?" Amazing tits. He doesn't say that part.
Harry’s still panting and coming back to himself when Draco — probably unaware of the bruises already developing on his neck — turns to the side and announces his imminent departure into unconsciousness and Harry pulls out of him feeling somehow surprised by the situation he’s suddenly in. He blinks at Draco a few times, briefly assesses the constriction in his chest the sight evokes, and then grabs his wand to clean them both up and cast another
Harry says, "Very funny," but he's grinning as he does. It slides only the tiniest bit when he continues, "Listen, I have news. About your wand."
“Our star signs,” says Draco. “We have love compatibility.”
"So, what," she says in disbelief, "he pulled out and you went your separate fucking ways? You started, you may as well have finished!"
"Fine," Pansy sighs. "Excellent."
“Yeah,” says Harry.
"D'you ever wonder how Seamus hasn't burned his flat down yet?" Harry says as plates and cutlery begin flying out of shelves and cupboards and stacking themselves on the table.
She'd asked, concentrating very hard on not blushing, and as tactfully as she could, whether he'd arranged to see Harry again any time soon. Draco stood up, announced that no, he wouldn't, because he didn't feel that a rough and angry not-even-a-proper-fuck in a stalled lift, following which their only interaction had been a brief and very snippy conversation, constituted a proper courtship, nicked half the packet, and left. Sulking once more.
“It’s Draco Malfoy, from school.”
Harry feels quite like his brain stutters to a halt. “Mc … Mc
, make me sob, Harry, please.”
He’d said that to Harry.
Ron has been intolerably smug for several days now, and Harry would like to know why.
It’s a good question and when Malfoy asks it Harry realises that’s exactly what he’s doing. Swallowing hard, he uses slightly more pressure, just enough so he can feel his palm pressing into Malfoy’s Adam’s apple. Fuck, he’s hard. “No,” he says. “I was thinking aloud.”
mean?" Hermione asks hotly. "Draco is not
Ron pinches the bridge of his nose. Grimaces. Fucking Harry.
He says, “You’re very funny, Pans. Very very funny. No, it’s nothing to do with Lucius. It’s just— fuck, I think this might be the stupidest thing I’ve done since then.”
"You know, he'd also tell you he's really proud of you," he says a bit more quietly. "It's been pretty cool, watching you with Rosie. I always thought it'd be Percy having kids next."
Draco grabs at the balustrade behind him to steady himself. "If I had a wand, I'd Vanish you. I don't want your apology, Potter, kindly fuck off."
It stings, and Draco is temporarily mum with disbelief. “Fuck this,” he mutters, and pushes his way out of the rickety, ruined door.
Gathering all his will power, Harry pulls out more fully this time before gripping Malfoy's hips and slamming back in. And then again. And soon he can't help himself anymore, giving himself over to a steady rhythm of pounding thrusts that knock Malfoy against the balustrade, burying himself gratefully in Malfoy's willing body. It's an insane juxtaposition to see snow around them and outside the tower and yet to be beading sweat inside the heated interior of the Warming Charm.
Giggles.
Harry snorts. He doesn’t see much value in pointing out that Malfoy has ignored him literally every other time they’ve come across each other since his trial. (Except for when he flipped him off, once, but Harry rather thinks that does more for his case than Malfoy’s.) “‘Course not.”
“I’m sure he’d be flattered to hear you say that,” says Hermione. “Now, do you think you could elucidate the reason you invited me here? As much as I’m enjoying this reunion, I really do have a full schedule today.”
attention, but—”
Malfoy nudges into the space beside Harry. Hm. He’s wearing a pair of grey woolen trousers (if they weren’t so loose, they could have been the ones from his Hogwarts uniform. As it is, Harry can see pointy hip bones and pale abdomen and a slink of golden hair. So.) and a cherry red t-shirt. Which has David Bowie on it. And is very tight. Harry thinks he should probably say something like; do you own any clothes that are actually your size? Ferret bastard? (For good measure.)
Harry laughs quietly through his nose, shrugging then and leaning over the rail on his elbows. There’s a joint (courtesy of Seamus) in his pocket that he decides not to take out quite yet.
George makes a face. He doesn't actually care, obviously. It was weird at first, especially because of Ginny and that situation, but in the end he was happy they were happy. Still, he likes to be a bit of a child about it, for fun.
“Yeah, s’pose not,” he agrees. “My life's become too easy lately, I thought I’d goad you into a fight or something.”
"Well. That brings us to number two."
"Dickhead. She knew."
a couple orderlies just down the corridor, and that's definitely something, right? Definitely worth not fucking Malfoy. Yeah.
“You’re here with someone?”
“I’ll snap your strap in half, you wretch.”
“Unhand me!”
Draco says, “My little pureblood arse is disinclined towards such plebeian duties.”
. Merely responding.
"Well it isn't easy to get Draco to beg," she says in a low, conspiratorial voice. Harry actually feels lightheaded suddenly. He can't look at Ron or Hermione. "Believe me, I've tried. You must be good. I'm quite good myself — it's an innate thing, don't you think? Either you can dom or you can't."
“What’s the point, then?”
“Well, fuck, I don’t actually know any of those charms, so would you mind?”
“Thank you,” says Draco. A small thrill runs through him at the point of soft contact. “Do you always take the trouble of helping your conquests conceal their battle scars?”
Blaise snorts. “Are you forgetting about our dear friend Draco, and his actual, literal, sizable cock?”
“What?” Draco slurs, pushing his face into Harry’s neck, bleary.
Harry,” and then hugged him (or at least tried), and then told him something else helpful and profound and soothing. Hermione’s good, like that. Ron never has been.
“I’ve never fucked my best friends, if that’s what you're implying, you sick twist.”
Draco gives him what starts out as a smirk but, seemingly unintentionally, ends up a lopsided smile, and Harry makes his way into the kitchen and tosses his robes over a chair.
"Really?" he says sharply. His grip is just tight enough so Malfoy would have a hard time pulling away, but not enough to really hurt. "You're gonna hit me, Malfoy? Did I strike a nerve?"
“D’you ever think he sort of ... does a thing where he goes after relationships that can’t go anywhere? I dunno, it’s like ...” He shakes his head, sighs again. “Like he avoids stuff that might last. I don’t think he does it on purpose, but ... I mean, Charlie. Natalie was never going anywhere, she was insane. Now Malfoy. It’s weird.”
glad for the look on his smug face when his charm doesn't work, so there's that.
"We had to track this bloke down last year," he says, wandlessly
He’d sort of expected the answer but it’s still odd to hear it.
Harry doesn't bother to ask what
It’s not easy for Harry, being physically affectionate, sometimes especially in a platonic sense. Charlie knows that — he also knows Harry
“You’re a child.”
Hermione rolls her eyes. “That’s not a
“But if Percy Weasley were here,” Draco says, deciding that if they’re going to be stuck for a while, he may as well act the proper, actual cunt and enjoy himself a bit. “Whatever would you stare at?”
The way Ron tells it, Harry chased his ex for a month or so before they actually got together. Perhaps that's the reason he's so resolute about it now. "Did he tell you that?"
He tugs on the piercing again, a little harder, until he can feel the pull. He's not exactly sure what he's aiming for at this point since he's certainly
"Gin," he says, stretching his arms above his head and yawning, "promise me you won't have kids until these ones get a bit older."
, those heels are sharp, you utter cunt. Fine.”
Draco leans forwards on his elbows, eyes on Polaris above his own dragon. "Not a Malfoy," he mumbles. Then, louder, so Potter can hear: "Yeah, you're welcome."
"Well you've already done that so many times, it wouldn't hold much weight." Rose fidgets a bit and Harry resettles her, a soothing hand on her back and one under her bum. And, to fill an awkward silence he can't stand, he says, "How were your, er, holidays?"
“Hm.”
the Great Hall looks like it does, and Harry’s truly sick of it.
A few of the books he took back with him still smell like salt and Pansy's clementine and grasse tuberrose perfume. Here, he likes to read them at the Black Lake's edge. There are trees that have sprung up since Dumbledore's burial, a copse of Elders that are always rustling gently, even when the air is still. Draco had begun his expedition onto the Lake's shore with caution, half convinced the trees would grow arms and try to drown him, or something, if he got too close. But they didn't, and now he can feel like he's improving his virtue, confronting his failings, while reading, which is far more interesting. Win-win.
Draco thinks for a second, wondering how to best contextualise what he knows Harry really wants to ask about. He said he was gay, his father expelled him from the Manor; that's what happened. However, it feels like a strangely dishonest way of retelling things. Sometimes, Draco thinks the flame of hero-worship he carried as a child was never quite extinguished, and if he could prise from Lucius the faintest flicker of remorse, he would believe it.
“Ngh, Harry, Harry, love,” Draco babbles. Harry can hardly hear him, but he knows Draco’s I’m-about-to-orgasm-voice, and he feels distinctly like he’s missing out.
Heart positively swelling, Harry takes Draco’s fluttering hand and presses a kiss to his knuckles. “You’d really come and live with me?”
Cheeks burning suddenly, Harry shrugs. "I mean ... I want you to have somewhere safe to go is the main thing," he says quietly. "I'm not trying to ... I do really like you. A lot. I dunno, I s'pose I didn't really think it through."
The third time they spoke was when Hermione and Malfoy started studying together. Hermione asked Harry if he’d like to join them, to which Harry replied that he’d done his homework already. Malfoy raised his eyebrow and said, “Really?”. It was kind of mean, but Hermione laughed.
. Not like I’ve gone to see him again. Believe me, finding him here was
"No," Draco says. "I was entirely embarrassing tonight. Blaise is right, sulking about Potter is fucking boring."
A lovely segue. Pansy wonders if it was purposeful. Only, she’s never imagined Granger to be skilled in the art of delicate conversation — she’s always been so incredibly blunt.
“See you later, Roonil.”
, it wouldn't be Malfoy if he wasn't being whiny and contradictory.
Clawing his way out of his fucking sweater prison, Draco stares at Potter, feeling incredibly indignant but also like he might cry. "Why would you do that?" he says.
Not Malfoy.
“My Teenage Wedding UK!” Harry says in desperation, and Ron laughs and piffs his rook at him over his shoulder.
Ron says, "Yeah, listen, never fucking tell me anything like that ever again. And I suppose so. Just — you can deal with this, yeah? You're good?"
"You know," Ron says thoughtfully, settling back down next to Hermione with a plate of sandwiches. "George was asking a very similar question the other day. You should keep an eye on that, Harry."
So, all right. Malfoy, notably, is the one who won't drop it, which really should absolve Harry of responsibility regarding any insane decisions he might choose to make, such as playing into the taunt.
Pansy keeps a deliberately straight face, but she realises suddenly he's just revealed (finally) the heart of the matter: Potter rejected him. In his mind, at least. The lift started moving and Potter jolted back to reality where he didn't fancy getting caught with his cock up Draco Malfoy's arse in a hospital.
Some part of him thinks of getting up and leaving, because
Draco groans, a proper, whiny thing from the back of his throat. "This is extortion," he says. Potter is unmoved. "Fine."
Dominique tilts her pretty blonde head (Merlin, Pansy’s glaringly unsubtle.) “How’d you get stuck in a lift? Couldn’t you just use a spell to get out?”
He looks down, but he appreciates Hermione's sentiment. A lot. It makes him think of the Dursleys', and never once feeling comfortable or welcome there, or like his opinions or feelings were taken account. Because they hadn't been.
“How lovely of you.”
“I know,” says Draco. Above him, Harry’s hair is tousled beyond salvation, and the swell of new light through the tower windows turns his skin golden and the puckered tissue around his scar shiny-white.
Harry snorts. “Yeah. But I thought that’s not all you wanted?”
. You know, with a
angry.” Looking up at Harry, Draco suddenly realises how he must sound. It’s childish and naive to keep looking for the good in his father that so clearly deserts him. He adds, “Really, I think Azkaban fucked him in the head somewhat. I don’t know. I wouldn’t count on an invitation to Christmas at the Manor this year, if that answers your question.”
“She has,” concedes Ginny. “But I’m sure you’re sick to death of talking about him by now.”
shouldn't've goaded me into it in the first place, by the way, on a goddamn
“Mmph.”
"No, we shalln't. I'm going to talk to Potter. He's become much more interesting as of late."
Charlie knows he's subjected himself to an inquisition by his siblings the minute he sits down at the table. They won't say anything in front of Mum and Dad and Teddy, but they'll sure as hell corner him and Harry after dinner. Whatever. It was quite worth it, in his opinion.
, Hermione! Inviting Draco Malfoy into
call me lover. It’s vile.”
“Right,” says Hermione. Annoyed and keeping it to herself. “Thank you.” And goes to sit down on one of the outrageously luxurious sofas.
Hermione’s eyes widen. “Let’s go, Ron.”
Blaise snickers.
Ron transfers his lanky slouch from Harry’s shoulder to Hermione’s. “Ciao, Harry.”
He’s clearly avoiding the topic, for which Narcissa can’t really blame him. Still, she can’t help but be interested.
bad, but still fucking infuriating. He has half a mind to demand to speak to Kingsley tomorrow and ask what the hell this is, taking kids' wands, letting the Wizengamot order it to be locked up outside of classes.
Harry stands and lets Hermione take Rose from him, rolling his eyes a bit when she apologises to him the same way as her infant daughter.
Draco looks up from Rose, squalling in his arms, when he hears Potter’s voice. At first he thinks he’s hallucinating, that the crying that kicked in about half an hour after Granger left and hasn’t stopped since has actually driven him properly insane. But then Potter steps forward, and sparkling relief fills him, because even though it’s Potter (
“I wouldn’t want to be impolite.”
"Excellent," says Draco. "I don't even have a wand to defend myself."
tip Harry right over the edge. He pounds into Malfoy’s yielding body without restraint, his orgasm washing through him in a wave of euphoria that sparks all his nerve-endings, and he can feel his own come start leaking out around his cock, easing the slide as he keeps pumping. He slows only gradually, squeezing Malfoy’s wrists and panting against his jaw.
to call him out on every single thing he tries to pull. So there.
“Pardon?”
With a small sigh, Pansy does listen. She's
“Hardly,” Draco says, and the haughtiness he’s trying for is a little undercut by the obvious desperation. Potter’s wanking technique is hardly elegant; it’s rough and rasping and every pull makes him push his hips further against his fist.
He hasn’t expressed the feeling out loud, but Blaise is of the private opinion that coming back to England had been a terrible idea. He’s enjoying himself, of course (save for the subpar blow), and he knows Pansy will be fine once she gets the logistics of her company sorted, but Draco?
Yeah. Not very nice.
a proper one either. It’s all very confusing, and Harry’s had a long day.
begun going back to work just yet, mostly because Hermione's been fretting about it, but when Heidi (the store's assistant manager) Floo-ed this morning in a panic rambling about George having an allergic reaction to a new product he was testing and Tess, the manager, being completely unreachable on her day off, Ron had to say yes. So Hermione had come home around eleven, in the middle of a shift at the hospital, while Ron went to take over at the store, and after calling nearly every one of their friends who she thought might be available last minute and finding absolutely nobody able to watch Rosie until the late afternoon, she'd done what she had to do. Without telling Ron.
Draco glances around them. It’s about seven on a Sunday, the staircases and sprawling landings are empty. He leans over and gives Harry a departing kiss, full on the mouth, with his hands on his jaw.
Harry laughs. He pushes Draco onto his back, his head hitting Harry's pillow. "You're just mad 'cause you're a little turned on by it."
Potter was at Mungo's, if he'd sought Draco out. But she goes with the latter instead.
“Mmph,” Weasley says, reaching for a (fifth? sixth?) spoonful of tapenade (which he most recently called tapenyoke, and Potter almost choked on his beer) “if she had been a Malfoy cousin, Malfoy would be married to her by now.”
His eyes are closed, and he looks horribly, perfectly debauched; swollen lips, slick with sweat and messy with glitter, black lace and come splattered along the v of his abdomen.
Pansy barely suppresses another eye roll. Granger is so fucking proper, it's incensing. She's lovely to look at, sure (with outrageously incredible skin), and she's got this whole virtuous, heart-of-gold thing going for her, but fuck she must be an utter bore in bed. Pansy can hardly bring herself to picture her and the Weasel, in all their heterosexual missionary glory. A tragedy, for both of them.
“I’ll put you off your tipnid in a minute."
He thinks he might have actually gotten lucky, but all hopes of putting off dealing with Malfoy until next time disappear when the lift opens and there he is, dressed in the lime green Healer robes that look terrible on everyone else. He thinks of waiting for another lift and then decides that would be pathetic too. So he gets on and ignores him as well as the one other occupant, another Healer who does nothing to hide her glance at his scar.
Harry’s fingers where they are, “Mess” is all Draco manages to get out of the snide comment he’d planned. He thinks the effect is much the same.
The hand still on Harry’s has moved from waist to hip, and the bone is poking into Harry’s palm. “Isn’t what?”
"Deal," Harry grins, leaning down to kiss his neck. "Go on, then."
He takes his wand out and taps the doors, which do nothing.
He says, after a puff, “He was angry because I told Granger that it was a hate fuck, and she thought that was unhealthy, so he got in trouble. And I said that he should get fucked, or something, and then he said
Harry’s face is blurry in the mildew-flecked mirror, a smudged thumbprint with glasses and dark hair. Draco turns to look at him. “No,” he says. “She’s in a rather magnificent strop.”
“Right,” he says, and goes to do it himself. The pear giggles and the door opens and he gestures for Malfoy to go in ahead of him. “Well I wouldn’t know then, would I? You tell me.”
“You alright?”
“I did,” says Draco, watching Harry’s hands on the wall. “Nothing happened.”
Then came the fighting. At first Harry would tell them about the fights, but he must've started to notice how concerned they looked when he did, because he stopped all of a sudden. He looked tired a lot, and unhappy a lot, but whenever they asked he gave them this look, and said 'I'm not a child'. He'd tell them, very stiffly, that things were great, and then he would leave.
Harry regrets asking suddenly; he hates the way he can see Malfoy touch his sleeve, and he hates the nearness to the subject of Lucius. The last time they'd been together, Malfoy had tried to slap him over his (admittedly a bit cruel) comment.
“You know, Harry,” says Hermione, and he braces himself for whatever harsh truth is forthcoming (Ron shoots him a sympathetic grimace), “sometimes I can’t believe how much you’ve grown up when I see you working so hard on a case, going to meetings and doing paperwork and being professional in interviews.” She purses her lips then, looking uncomfortably like McGonagall. “And then Draco comes over for a nice,
"Shit," Harry says quietly. "Too bad." He looks it over once more, shakes his head, and turns back to Malfoy. "Listen, I'm gonna head down to the kitchens and see if they'll get me some hot cocoa. You wanna come?"
Charlie says, "I'll try my hardest," and takes Harry's jaw in his hand.
Harry sucks at the tender spot by Draco’s ear, the whiny noise it draws going straight to his groin.
Well. That settles that: he can sit here no longer.
Draco spreads his arms. “That’s me, Potter. Very nouveau riche. Pass on my apologies, will you? Only, I’ve got an engagement soon after six.”
They lie for a while, Draco with his eyes closed and Harry looking at the stars a little but at Draco the most, until an arm shifts beneath his.
“Comes naturally,” Draco says, deciding not to be offended. “Besides,” he adds, “pot, kettle. My namesake is the dragon that guarded the gardens of the Hesperides. Who’s yours? ‘Harry’ is horribly common, you know. Though you are too, so I suppose it’s quite well-suited.”
, I’m being
Technically marble. “Er. Kind of.”
Malfoy was the problem, and continues to
“Oh?” he says. “How so?”
“Are you sure? You were all in that tent together a very long time.”
After a moment, Harry says, “Would you have handed me over? In the Room of Requirement, if you’d had the chance. Would you have done it?”
It's then that Harry realises Hermione has decided he deserves to suffer for whatever reason, because she's taking her place next to Ron and the other chair is across the table, next to Malfoy. He grits his teeth and takes it, glaring at her.
Draco says, "No."
He says, “Whatever, Potter.”
Draco smirks. “So if your father was so brilliant, why’re you such a twonk?”
When Hermione and Ron first got together a few years ago, that probably would’ve hit a little too sensitive of a nerve. But Harry’s made his peace with it now. More than. “Are you calling me a wheel?” he says.
Draco’s muscles twitch when Harry strokes his thigh, alternating little circles with the pad of his thumb. He presses a few kisses along the slim column of Draco’s throat, exposed with his face turned skywards.
Lifting his neck, Harry meets him in a kiss that feels different than usual, hand moving to his jaw. “I know you can,” he says.
. Can’t think of anything but my cock filling you up, yeah? Making you feel good.”
George snickers. "It's my duty, now he's gone."
“How sad,” Malfoy says. He’s still lazily rocking to the beat in Harry’s arms. “An exquisite tragedy that shall be lauded alongside Shakespeare’s greats, I’m sure.”
, under his trousers. “Not wearing pants. That’s—bloody hot, Merlin.”
Draco wishes he could make that promise with any kind of confidence. "I'm not the one who's been hard for the last twenty minutes," Draco says. "Tell me, Potter —
"Tell me more about St Mungo's, Draco," she requests. "You've told me all about Paris, but nothing about what you'll be doing while you're home again."
Draco grunts in objection, and nibbles languidly at Harry’s collar bone.
Draco shrugs softly, with one shoulder, burgundy sheets bunching underneath him. “Secret.”
It's not what he wants to hear, Harry realises. Which ... at least that's illuminating. And he can't help smiling a little as Ron takes Rose from him, because shit, he really picked the right compartment on the train that day twelve years ago.
“What the fuck?” Draco says, covering his wrist out of instinct. “Why?”
Draco says, "I'm here for one night, Lucius, no longer." His father's hand is numbing where the fingertips grip at his skin, but he doesn't want to touch it to wrench it off. He presses his wand to the heel instead. "I'll do as I please."
“There’s a million stars, Malfoy, what makes you think I know where ‘there’ is? You’d be a terrible teacher.”
“That’s not what I meant. And no, I don’t.”
Draco pushes Potter away from him, just lightly with two hands on his chest. “You can’t
“What?” Draco says again. “Where?”
A not uncomfortable silence descends and Harry’s high brain flits haphazardly through all his peculiar encounters with Malfoy these last three months, the new things he now knows about him and some of the suspicions they’ve spawned. He’s told Hermione about it — the random encounters, not the suspicions.
Harry glances down at Malfoy’s mouth and back up again. Says, “Have another guess.”
“Find them,” Harry mutters, fiddling blindly at Draco’s flies and pulling his trousers over the swell of his ass. “Find them. What kind of fuck-wittery—”
, like a pleb, instead of letting him go on through to Pansy’s office like the last one did when he brought her chocolate biscuits. He’s tried the same tactic on the new girl, but she doesn’t eat processed sugars. The bitch.
Harry’s jaw clenches and he fights the sense of humiliation with some small modicum of success, only because he
“I’m calling you a
Sometimes, when Harry’s brought home a casefile to review in the evenings, he’ll ask Draco to explain a paragraph of legal jargon to him, just to hear him talk, and see him wave his hands in that expressive way of his.
Draco turns towards the caress like a flower to the sun. “Good morning,” he says, voice thick with sleep hardly departed from. His mother used to wake him up softly like this, with kisses on his forehead and cooing his name. It’s a weird thought, Draco shakes it from his head.
“I’m not fretting,” he argues.
“Oh really?” Pansy coos, taking Blaise’s arm. “And then, pray tell, what would you do when you’re in a strop and want me to dom you a bit, hm?”
isn't the only thing that's half-finished. I'm not an idiot, there's more to the fucking story."
"There," he says. "I've done it for you. Throw the tantrum next time, Draco, instead of dirtying your wand." He sips at his own. Crosses a leg over his knee. "You do take pleasure in your mother's suffering. You do, or you wouldn't have stayed away so long. I was never such an ungrateful son. I don't know where you get it."
“You’re not,” Harry insists. As if he could confuse fucking cotton or flannel or
“Really?” Draco says. He reaches over and pulls Harry’s glasses off his face, sliding them onto his own. (Harry sometimes thinks his life would be easier if he just shacked up with one of those perfectly
“Oh?” Pansy says, perking up. “More than you told me even?”
"He said he doesn't hate me."
Harry lowers his wand, feeling sort of silly but also fully justified, to be totally honest. He’d died here not too long ago. So.
Lucius watches Draco dip his wand into the whisky and feels an all-too-familiar rage. He know he's doing it on purpose, flaunting his magic, the adult version of sticking one's tongue out. Coupled with the use of his given name, it enrages him so thoroughly that he swipes the tumbler off the end table between them and doesn't flinch as it shatters on the Turkish rug.
“Points for effort,” Draco offers.
her to be deliberately dim just to annoy her, and that’s not this poor girl’s fault. “Is she in her office? She sent me an owl.”
Blaise snickers, and Draco slides from the low slung couch to the ground. This close, he can hear the steady thrum of music from the club below. “Apparate me from here,” he demands. “Tired.”
bad. Somehow the image of Charlie fucking Malfoy is significantly better, actually, which makes Harry think again about how fucking weird his life has remained even after dealing with the murderous psychopath. He turns round again and finds Hagrid's hut in the darkness, smoke curling up from the chimney. "It's Hagrid, isn't it," he says, looking at Malfoy. "You fancy Hagrid."
This is where they part. They’ve come, and they’ve
"Splendid," Draco says, and lets the door close in Potter's face when he goes back inside.
Grinning, Harry says, “Would it ruin your opinion of him to know he was in love with my mum?”
“Will you,” says Harry, and then, “Will you call me Harry?”
