Uneasiness flitted across Harry’s face, gone so quickly that Draco almost thought he imagined it. He had to admit that he was curious as to the answer to this question as well.
Laughter rose unbidden in Harry as she released him, only to look up at Harry with a sharp smirk on her lips—one that almost seemed to spite the redness of her eyes. He knew for a certainty that he would be hearing from her over the weekend.
Draco watched the team practice until Harry gave them all the okay to go to the changing rooms. That was when it occurred to Draco, that if Harry was the last one out of the changing room, Draco could talk to him. Alone. And the odds of Harry being the last were good, seeing as he had stayed on the field to pick up the balls and small cones the team had used. And so, Draco hoisted his bag back onto his shoulders and walked towards the changing room.
The smirk that grew on Narcissa’s face was unmistakable, and yet it clashed with the concern and interest in her icy blue eyes and her sky-high eyebrows. “So… have you two…”
Pansy’s lips were pressed into a thin, wobbling line. Misty eyes blinked at both Harry and Draco from across the table. Looking at one of his best friends, one he’d known for years, through everything, Draco could only wish that he could empathize with her. To feel the pain that she felt so that he could help her to ease it. To help her in every way he possibly could. It killed him that he had no idea what to do.
” Sirius shook his head with phony disappointment written across his face. “Really, Harry, it makes me feel old. You should know better.”
And oh, if that wasn’t the most arousing, moan-inducing thing Draco had ever heard in his entire life, he didn’t know what was. He cupped Harry’s face and met his dark, heated eyes.
The watch on his wrist had just ticked midnight when he heard footsteps through the door. Draco had left it open the smallest bit in order to hear anyone approaching. He was practically vibrating with apprehension and the hope that Harry would think sneaking out was worth all this.
“That was great!” Harry reached forward and nudged her shoulder. “That was ten more pounds than usual, Katie. I’m proud of you.”
are you waiting for?” It seemed that Ronald had finally caught up to him, the bright white light of his flashlight flooding the hall as he ran. Though he resented the way the light made his eyes sting, Draco knew that Ronald had a point.
“Wouldn’t be so bad,” Harry mumbled. Draco could see the sleep hanging over him. Each muscle in his body seemed to have relaxed, gone limp. He wasn’t asleep yet, but he would be.
He felt Harry lean closer from beside him. When he whispered, Draco could feel Harry’s warm, peppermint breath on his ear, his neck, “It’s okay, you know. I think you smell wonderful.” Harry paused as if gathering his own composure. “I have a football game later today. You should come, it’ll be a close game.”
“Harry, I’m so sorry,” Draco whispered before his boyfriend could say a word. He laid down and stared at the ceiling.
The thought sent uneasiness flooding his body, his veins. But before he showed any outward signs of his panic, Harry buried the feeling. This was something important to Draco, and he would keep his word.
The lungs in Draco’s chest were suddenly working double-time, his breaths coming in so fast that his head felt slightly dizzy. Somehow he managed to look over at Pansy as if asking for her permission to go. She nodded and waved him away like she would to shoo a bug.
Draco couldn’t stop smiling. His heart was pounding in his chest, his skin was tingly wherever Harry touched him. They closed the door to the courtyard behind them, and Draco saw that Harry was smiling, too.
The message sent, and no more than a few seconds later, the “read” banner came up beneath it. But Harry wasn’t typing. Draco mentally cursed himself. He cursed himself for his own patheticness, that he seemed so reliant already on a boy he had only just met. He cursed Harry for his stupid power over Draco. For the effect that he seemed to have on him. He cursed Harry all throughout Maths because, by the end of it, Harry still hadn’t messaged him back. And Draco was beginning to think that he wasn’t going to.
“I dunno, I’m kinda used to being up so late. And I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable or anything while you were sleeping.”
The front doors of Hogwarts Academy were truly extravagant. The doors to Draco’s own family manor couldn’t even compare, much to his chagrin. And the fact that he also happened to be standing next to Harry Potter may have played a part in how absolutely
Icy, soft hands suddenly trailed across the skin at Harry’s hips, just at the hem of his shorts. That, combined with the cool breath fanning across his shoulder, made him shiver as goosebumps flowered across his skin. A familiar pair of silky lips pressed a delicate kiss between Harry’s shoulder blades. Both relief and excitement poured in through every pore in his body, flooding his every sense.
Harry tried for a smile, but it was shaky at best. “I understand your concern, I really do. I would feel the same if it was my best friend. But I have no intention of hurting Draco. I like him, and I wouldn’t ever want to cause him pain or make him sad. I know that you’re not going to take me on my word for it. But I hope you’ll give me a chance before you attempt to murder me.”
Harry had unexpectedly grown an inch or two in the past few months, so Draco now fit more comfortably against him. When they’d first noticed, it had bothered Draco to no end.
The instant the last guests had left—some elderly couple that Draco didn’t know—Draco dashed up the grand staircase and down the hall to his bedroom. As soon as he heard the door click behind him, he’d practically ripped off his suit, nearly tripping over himself, and thrown on the sweatpants he’d stolen from Harry, along with his football hoodie. The overpowering scent of his boyfriend grounded him, almost like he could hear Harry’s voice in his ear, gentle and quiet.
“Can I see?” Harry asked with an uncertain voice. Draco’s hands were shaking a little as he handed Harry the sketchbook, waiting for the scoffing voice his father always gave him. Instead, Harry’s eyes went wide as he examined every page. He looked up and said, “Draco, these are
His mind went blank. Harry wasn’t even thinking about the punching bag in front of him anymore. He’d reached that mind-place where he was moving purely on muscle memory. He was barely even comprehending what he was seeing in front of him, Harry was so zoned out. Someone could have screamed and he probably wouldn’t have heard it. (This was the best part for him. This was the place where nothing and no one bothered him, not even himself. This was the place where he got to forget who he was, where he got to forget everything and just
“Harry,” Draco said, wrapping his arms around his boyfriend’s shoulders, “promise me you’ll be on time to breakfast tomorrow.”
And like lightning, Draco’s head instantly snapped up, startling Harry. His grey eyes were wide and nearly horrified. His hands suddenly grasped Harry’s and yanked them to his chest as he exclaimed, “No! No, Harry, God, no, never.”
Fred plopped onto the couch beside them with a brown translucent bottle in his hands. George wasn’t far behind, sitting on their other side.
“They can’t hurt you anymore, my love,” Draco whispered, his lips grazing against the shell of Harry’s ear. “You’re safe, sunshine, you don’t ever have to see them again.”
Hermione had finally arrived at their lunch table, where Ron had been pestering Harry for details about the boy he had met.
Harry could still hardly believe that the beautiful blond boy he’d met on a late-night plane had become his boyfriend. Although Draco still managed to use Harry’s shoulder as a pillow at breakfast, and whenever else they had the chance to sit down together, Harry felt that they had come a long way in such a short time. He knew that the progression of their relationship was fast, he
The arm around Draco’s shoulders tensed slightly. He looked up at Harry, only to see him staring at the floor in front of them. It was a strained sort of silence, his fingers were fidgeting in Draco’s hand. The blond didn’t think he would get an answer to this question, but Harry seemed to push through whatever barrier had been holding the words in.
” A disbelieving laugh rushed from his mouth. Draco had been trying for about a week or so to find a pet name that suited Harry, but so far none of his attempts had been successful. He’d tried sugar, sweetums, sugar plum, loverboy, and so many others that had only made Harry laugh.
skin. The nervousness and anxiety that had strangled Harry quickly dissipated, replaced by burning indignation that he felt deep in his bones. He found himself straightening his spine and lifting his chin, staring not at the father of his boyfriend, but at the man who had taught Draco those awful words. The man who had used those words like they were
Silence had fallen over the table. Their little group had turned their undivided attention to Harry. Draco squeezed his hand under the table and stretched upward to press a soft kiss under Harry’s ear. It earned him a delicate smile before Harry continued, his eyes boring into Pansy’s.
Harry held Pansy close to him, soothingly running his fingers through her hair until he felt her quivering come to a stop. Her arms loosened around him, but her hands were fisted firmly in his shirt against the small of his back. Harry felt her taking slow, deep breaths in tandem with him.
She threw her arms around Draco’s neck—reaching across Harry to get there, but she just tugged him closer. Draco was sure that the look on his face was comical gold. He felt warmth blooming in his chest, a different sort than when Harry touched him. Draco cautiously wrapped his hands around Hermione’s small frame, looking at Harry over her hair with wide eyes.
Rolling his eyes and shaking his head, he walked through the doors to the boys’ dormitories and headed straight for Harry’s, familiar enough with the hallway that he was sure he could walk to Harry’s room in the dark, or with his eyes closed. He couldn’t believe the
With a pointed look at her once again pinging phone, Harry quipped, “Your phone begs to differ, Pansy dearest.”
Draco had decided early on in his boyfriend’s absence that he would do more than mope around and miss Harry until he came back. No, he’d decided to keep himself busy—thinking, mostly. And reasoning to himself. He’d finally decided that he wanted to broach a topic that he and Harry had never discussed deeply or seriously.
“No, no, not really. I guess I just haven’t seen you out of school uniform since the airplane. You look… nice.”
“Do you think that I just let him say those things to me?” Hermione looked slightly offended, enough to make Harry stop. “I told him to screw off! Harry, I’m not defenseless. So please,
Hermione sighed. At long last, they reached the Great Hall, and the first person they both saw sitting at their table was a certain Ronald Weasley, who had his arms around Lavender Brown’s waist, and his tongue down her throat. Lavender’s hands were raking through his red hair in an almost animalistic manner.
Draco was hit with an entirely new kind of fondness for Harry. (He had a heart that must have taken up all the space in his broad chest. His compassion must have filled the space in his bones where marrow was supposed to reside. His empathy ran in his veins, his passion burned in his lungs.)
This is an important note, dearest readers. I won't be able to update this work for the next two to three weeks. I swear I'm not abandoning this work, believe me I've worked too hard to give up now. I'm in my school's musical, and for the next two weeks we'll be rehearsing nonstop, all hours, zero breaks. So, even if I did write anything in what little time I would have for sleep and homework, it would be complete trash. So please just stick with me, I'll update as soon as I can, but just be forewarned that it won't be for a couple of weeks.
“I think,” he began smoothly, confidently, scathingly, “you mean it’s a pity that you lost. It’s a pity for you that you had to resort to hitting below the belt and playing dirty to try and hurt Harry so you’d have at least a
“Ow!” Draco whisper-yelled, trying to keep the Professor from hearing them, “Pansy, what the bloody hell was that for?”
Draco finally ran out of air and had to pull back, keeping his eyes closed to savor the moment. He felt Harry lay his forehead against his own and smiled at the tender touch. He could smell the peppermint on Harry’s warm breath.
Harry’s grin was beaming, even as he teased, “Are you saying that you’re embarrassed to be seen with me?”
An obnoxiously high-pitched giggle sounded from behind the door frame, announcing Lavender Brown’s arrival. “Ronnie, what’s taking so long?” she whined, “It doesn’t take much time to grab a jacket-” she stopped as soon as she stepped into the room, seeing Harry and Draco entangled on the bed. “Oh!” she squeaked, too loudly for Harry’s taste. Draco shifted, his nose scrunching and his brow furrowing like he detested the noise even as he slept.
Without the least bit of warning, Draco swiftly snatched Harry’s keys from his jeans pocket and said, “I’m just… I’m gonna wait in the car, okay?”
“Draco has what could possibly be the biggest crush on a certain Harry Potter,” Blaise had explained through his dying laughter. Theo then looked at Draco, who explained the whole story through again for his other friend.
Which he surprisingly hadn’t. He’d been too engrossed in his pencils, charcoals, his brushes, and paints. His hands were mindlessly swishing across the paper with familiar movements, the images coming to life before his eyes. Looking at his multiple papers now, he saw different renderings of the same pair of green eyes. Whether that be on the lion he’d used his watercolors for, the snake he’d used his charcoals on, everything had that same shade of shining green eyes.
Hermione turned a shaky smile in the blond boy’s direction. Draco suddenly felt like less of an intruder. He felt like he might’ve actually been helping her, instead of just observing. She looked back at Harry when he began to speak again. Suspicion passed over his face, shadowing his eyes and tensing his jaw.
Draco could feel his hands sweating. He had followed Harry all the way back to his common room in the northern dormitories, where Harry had gone inside to get Hermione. Draco was alone to ruminate in his thoughts. They weren’t very pleasant ones.
“I have a feeling that if we stay here any longer, Theo’s going to kill me,” Harry laughed before pulling away. Disappointment washed over Draco. But Harry leaned forward, and Draco thought that he was going for another kiss. But he kissed Draco’s cheek, lingering for a moment, as if loath to leave. Draco smiled tenderly at him as he pulled away and walked to the door, giving him a glance over his shoulder before he left.
“Perfect timing,” Pansy snarked. She picked up her story where she had left off, but before she got very far, the common room door burst open.
His eyes felt as though they were boring into Draco’s, and his somber tone returned, even as there was still a crooked smile on his lips. “What do you feel?” Harry asked. “About having sex with me?”
His boyfriend had seemed fine, happy and content after they’d arrived back at school after the cafe fiasco. He’d walked Draco back to his dorm room and kissed him goodnight. Everything had seemed fine. More than fine, really.
“Not like this!” Draco’s lips were turned down in a pout, which Harry found both adorable and endearing. “I’m not some stereotypical housewife you can just spoil.”
The laughter pushed past his lips, just loud enough for Draco to hear and scowl at. “Alright, damsel,” Harry smirked, “Sirius and Remus are just heading outside, let’s go.” Gently, he interlocked his fingers with Draco’s and led him out into the slowly dying sunlight outside, smiling when the smaller boy pressed himself into Harry’s side and hid his face in his shoulder.
“With you, before I left,” Draco whispered. His voice was ragged and thick. He leaned into Harry’s hand, pressing his soft mouth to his palm.
, Harry thought, sitting on the bench in the locker rooms, minutes before the game was going to start,
Even though his muscles were slightly sore from training the day before, Harry ran as fast as his legs would take him through the corridors, into the garage, and dashed for his car. Draco’s breaths hadn’t improved; he sounded like there was a weight on his chest. His muffled cries hadn’t relented. Harry started his car and hoped that it wouldn’t alert anyone to him leaving as he quickly pulled out of the garage and got on the main road, still holding the phone to his ear with one hand.
Draco had taken a step closer to Ron with every word, forcing the other boy to back away from the door, his resolve crumbling with Draco’s scathing tone and scorching words. He could feel his blood boiling with the need to get the Weasley boy away from Harry, his nails digging into the meat of his palm.
And so he did. The moment Pansy walked into the dormitory she said, “Spill everything. I can’t believe you didn’t tell me sooner!” Theo walked in behind her, a grin splitting his normally serene face. They all piled onto Draco’s bed despite there being three others in the room, looking at him with expectant faces. “Well?” Pansy said, waving her hands for Draco to get on with the details.
Harry’s eyes shot open, shooting upright on his mattress. He could hardly see anything, his eyes hadn’t adjusted to the darkness of the room. His breathing was harsh and erratic, his head spinning. His heart was beating painfully against his ribs, the horror of the dream making his stomach turn and nausea rise up in his throat.
Peeling his eyes open, Harry first saw Hermione pacing in the center of the room, her cellphone to her ear. He couldn’t make out anything she was saying, but he couldn’t care enough to strain his ears to hear. Scanning the room, he spotted Ron sitting on his own bed, hunched over and staring at his hands. He briefly wondered why he was there but didn’t let himself linger on it.
“Oh, shut it, both of you,” he snapped. They were practically howling at this point, gaining the attention of everyone in the common room. Even Theo had walked over to see what the ruckus was about.
“I kept a few,” Harry admitted, “the ones I liked the most, I may have… slightly stolen them.” He felt no regret for taking them—he knew that most of the others had been kept in Draco’s sketchbooks. The same sketchbooks that were now nothing more than ashes in a fireplace.
“I have to go and tell Ron, otherwise he might try to beat you up when he sees you with Malfoy in the halls,” Hermione teased.
“Well, Harry, it was nice to have finally laid eyes on the boy my son is constantly writing to me about.” She set her hand on Draco’s shoulder like she was trying to soothe her son’s immediate embarrassment. The blond boy was flooded with relief when he saw the soft, small smile on Harry’s face—not that he’d expected anything else from him. “Now,” Narcissa continued, walking to the passenger side door, “be a dear and just put his things in the trunk. Draco, say goodbye quickly before your father gets even more impatient.”
“Well, my father, as you know, isn’t my favorite person. But my mother- my mother is definitely my favorite person. She’s wonderful and has always supported me, even if she had to do it silently. She’s always been very clever in getting around my father’s disapproving glares,” Draco laughed, thinking about the smirk his mother would give him after outwitting his father.
“No, it’s alright,” Harry slowly moved to sit up again, his muscles protesting each movement. He didn’t exactly know why he protested—he just knew that she had already done enough for him. “I can do it.”
When Harry arrived at the door to Draco’s common room, it was Pansy who answered, in her pajamas with her hair in pigtails. Harry nearly laughed at the image, but he knew that she would probably break his kneecaps. She simply pointed him to Draco’s dorm as if to say,
As they approached the door, the atmosphere shifted, now charged with the combined uneasiness of both boys. Harry felt his hands begin to sweat. It was like his lungs struggled to function, the air had to fight to get to his brain and each of his muscles.
The drive back to Hogwarts was quiet. In the backseat, Pansy swiped through Harry’s photos with Theo, cooing over the ones with Astrid especially. Hermione and Blaise were silently looking out of the window, watching the road go by. Harry held Draco’s hand over the center console, rubbing circles into his soft skin with his thumb. The radio was a distant background noise, Draco humming along to the slow melody. When Harry parked in the school’s garage, the calm atmosphere followed them out of the car and into the school’s corridors as they made their way to the southern common room once again. Harry held Draco’s hand and walked behind Pansy and Theo—who were now giggling at the pictures of Draco on his phone—swinging their hands between them. Harry could hear Hermione babbling excitedly about the books her parents had sent her, telling Blaise all about the new things she’d been studying.
Harry; knew that he absolutely loved football, his favorite color was green, knew that he considered Hermione his sister, and positively adored her. He knew that deep down, Harry missed Ron, and it was driving him crazy not talking to him. He knew that there was some deep pain inside of Harry that he had yet to share. And Draco was okay with waiting until he was ready.
Draco hadn’t anticipated the feel of Harry’s hand on his wrist. He hadn’t anticipated how it would feel to have any part of his body so close to Harry’s lips, the warmth of his breath on his skin. He hadn’t prepared for the way Harry’s eyes darkened
Also, trigger warning for the end of the chapter, when the big chunk of text in italics starts, there is a scene about child abuse, and some of the writing afterwards might be triggering for someone with an eating disorder.

problems with the colors of our skin.” Draco’s face flushed slightly at the mention of Harry’s interest in him, but he nodded.
Hermione looked at him with a critical gaze, her eyes skeptical and her lips pursed. “I’m alright.” Her mouth twisted in a wry grin, and Harry knew that she was out for blood. “How’s Cho doing, Cedric?” She shot a glance at Harry, making sure that he was alright with this direction of the conversation.
When he looked back up at Harry and saw his smile and his beautiful green eyes, he couldn’t help but throw his arms around the other boy's neck and just
Draco opened his mouth to protest not being told, but then seemed to realize where they were. His mouth instead opened in a smile, his shoulders shaking with laughter. “You’re taking me to the department stores?” Harry looked over at him with an almost shy smile on his face before looking back at the road to pull into the parking garage.
Pulling away, Narcissa gave him a watery smile. “My son loves you, Harry. So, I hope to see more of you. And get to know you better.” She waited for him to nod his head before leaving, closing the gates behind her and walking to the doors of the manor.
Draco felt a giddy smile spreading his lips as he put his hands on Harry’s shoulders, sliding them up to link behind his neck.
“You’re not going in there,” Draco hissed, trying to keep his voice down for Harry’s sake. “I don’t care what you were going for,
Draco immediately started combing Harry’s hair back with one hand while the other ran up and down his back. He’d needed this. He knew that Harry had needed it, too. The closeness, the subtle intimacy of just
Draco flung his arms around Harry as they crashed together. Harry crushed the smaller boy to his chest, sweeping his hands over every inch of him he could reach, checking for anything wrong. Draco’s entire body was shaking, his tears soaked into the loose gym tank top Harry wore. One of his hands was wound in Harry’s hair, the other clenched on his shoulder. The sensation of having his boyfriend so close to him again made happiness flower throughout his entire body, but it was soon suffocated.
“Uh—no, no of course not.” Ronald seemed to grimace at himself. “I just… I wanted to apologize to you. I’m sorry for saying that Harry didn’t need you. For being an ass to you when I had no right to be.”
“I did, but I don’t anymore,” Harry stated, his eyes drifting closed and his lips spreading in an even wider smile.
Draco’s throat went slightly dry as he walked towards Harry through the crowd of students. Harry looked up and noticed him when Draco was about three or four meters away. Draco was beyond relieved to see a small smile on his face instead of the grimace Draco had been slightly expecting.
Thinking was impossible for Draco. He may have even forgotten his own name. Though he surely remembered Harry’s, as he moaned and whined it into his boyfriend’s ear and into his open, panting mouth. He didn’t bother to hold back any desperate, needy noises that were drawn out from him with the rhythmic rolling of Harry’s hips into his.
. But Draco hadn’t really thought about it. He’d never thought about what he might do in the face of someone who had been with Harry, someone who had known him, loved him. He hadn’t been prepared.
and tightened his fingers on his waist, tight enough to leave bruises, a new vigor in the way he was sucking on Draco’s skin. His tongue smoothed over every bite, his mouth was soft and hot.
This was the most nervous that Draco had seen Harry since he’d met him, and the thought of that gave him somewhat of a confidence boost. Without a word, he took his cell out of his pocket and handed it to Harry with a new contact form open. Harry looked at Draco and smiled at him, that same small twist to his lips that melted Draco’s confidence as if it were snow in the springtime sun. His face felt hot, and the slight brush of Harry’s fingers against his when he took the phone made his chest feel as though it would burst open.
to all of us for the past three months! Not just to me, either. Hermione, Draco, all of us. It’s not just about what you said to me anymore!” Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. “You got back together with Lavender, of all things! Do you not remember how
Theo nodded at him and stepped aside in a move that Harry was sure they had planned, to reveal Draco. Harry let his eyes wander over the blond boy. He was wearing a pair of black jeans that had light destruction, and a pale green pullover shirt. His hair was slicked back as always, and he looked… beautiful (Harry knew that Draco would prefer to be called handsome, or even good-looking, but neither of those words did him justice. He was beautiful in the way he stood, the way his shoulders moved with his breath, the way his tongue wet his lips. He was absolutely, undeniably, irrevocably gorgeous).
him enough to be gentle with him, enough to give him space if he needed it. So Harry brought his smaller boyfriend closer to his body, moving so their heads were on Harry’s pillows, facing each other. Draco slowly brought his hands to Harry’s face, softly tracing his skin. His fingers were as chilled as always, and Harry kissed his fingertips as they passed over his lips.
Harry felt it when Draco drifted to sleep, his chest moving against his own with deep, even breaths. He finally allowed himself to reflect on the events of the night. Whatever Lucius had done, Harry knew there was only so much he could do about it.
“It’s okay,” Harry whispered back. “Just… take everyone else to your common room, I’ll meet you there.” He lowered his voice even further. “Keep an eye on Hermione for me, try to keep her talking, okay?”
He wanted more of Harry’s hands on him, more of his mouth, tongue, teeth, and skin. So, Draco pulled him down into a kiss by the back of his neck and crossed his ankles over the small of Harry’s back, drawing his body closer until every inch of them was pressed together. He soaked in the warmth that radiated from Harry. He ran his hands over every muscled plane of his body, drinking in the guttural noises that came from his boyfriend and gave his own in response.
“Cedric,” Harry acknowledged, trying his hardest to keep his voice composed, “what can I do for you?”
There was one cologne he was absolutely obsessed with. He had spritzed it on his wrist, turned to Harry and squealed, “Smell this and tell me it isn’t the most amazing thing you’ve ever smelled!” Draco hadn’t anticipated the feel of Harry’s hand on his wrist. He hadn’t anticipated how it would feel to have any part of his body so close to Harry’s lips, the warmth of his breath on his skin. He hadn’t prepared for the way Harry’s eyes darkened as he said, “That is definitely the most amazing thing I’ve ever smelled. Which one is it?” Draco had weakly gestured to a bottle in the shopping bag.
“I have a couple of tests coming up. Logically, I know that I’ll do fine, but I worry anyway. The last championship game is next week, and we’ve all come so far this season, and I don’t want to lose, Sirius. I don’t want to have come this far, worked this hard, just to lose.”
“Ooh, he’s bossy, now.” Harry teased, though he did as he was told and laughed at his boyfriend’s playful scowl. “That might be even more attractive than the gentleman thing.”
“Hey,” Harry interrupted, taking Draco’s jaw in his hand. Those grey eyes seemed to flicker in the fluorescent bathroom lights. “Baby, no. It doesn’t matter to me that you’re a virgin, or that you might not know what to do. It doesn’t make me think any differently of you. That’s why we need to communicate with each other about what we need, or what we want.” A smile pulled at the corners of Harry’s lips. “It’s okay if we go slow, my love.”
“I promise.” Harry punctuated his words with the last kiss to his boyfriend’s forehead. “There’s nothing else I would rather do, my love.”
“Harry, I—” Draco choked. Harry looked back up at him. His cheeks were streaked with tears. His eyes were tinged red. “I can’t even imagine… I—” He stopped. Draco crawled across the small space between them and wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck. The way he touched Harry was so light and cautious—like Draco was afraid that he might shatter in his hands. It brought tears to Harry’s eyes because he was
Confusion wrinkled Draco’s brow as he looked up into Harry’s gorgeously green eyes. “I’m just fine, love.” There was a subtle anxious air about Harry. One that Draco silently cursed himself for not having noticed before. “Why?”
Pansy smacked his arm, “Shut up, Potter.” Harry simply laughed at her as she swaggered off. He looked back at Hermione across from him, who was peering at him with an unreadable expression on her face. Her dark eyes were examining him like she would a science experiment. She glanced behind him, then back at Harry.
Harry looked back down at him rain dripping down his face and beading in his hair. There was a bright grin on his face, and Draco knew that for whatever reason, he was happy to be out in the rain if it meant being with Harry. “What, you don’t want to dance in the rain with me?” He brought Draco closer to his body—still warm even in the shivering rain—with his hands at his waist.
Harry could feel his body trembling. His hands were fisted in Draco’s shirt, his breathing unsteady and stuttering.
He saw Harry’s throat move with how hard he swallowed before he answered, “Yeah, yes, I really want that.”
Draco’s mind felt as though he’d left it behind in his common room, still trying to process that there was something
The gates that surrounded Malfoy Manor looked more like a cage in the face of the midnight sky. Harry had already called Draco to tell him that he had arrived as he’d parked the car in front of them. He was currently pacing back and forth in front of the black, wrought iron gates, not caring about the chill in the air. Behind them was a long driveway that led to a menacingly large manor with huge, ornately carved doors—doors that suddenly opened.
“So, Draco,” Sirius started, voice soft so as not to startle him, “tell me about yourself. Harry’s told me quite a bit, but I’d like to get to know my son’s boyfriend for myself.”
Light from the rising sun filtered through the curtains surrounding Harry’s bed, casting a red-hued haze over Draco’s vision. The smaller boy had been awake for nearly an hour, just listening to the sound of Harry’s breathing and studying the texture of the curtains. They had shifted sometime after Draco had fallen asleep. The pale, bare skin of his back was pressed into the warmth of Harry’s chest, with his boyfriend’s arms enveloping him, keeping him close. Draco had tossed away his shirt sometime in the night, Harry had been more than enough to keep him warm. Their legs had tangled together underneath the worn sheets. With his head tucked under Harry’s chin, Draco curled perfectly against Harry’s body.
Hearing the window roll down, Draco made himself as small as possible, hiding his face from Harry’s godfather.
Scrambling, jolts of unfiltered shock jarring him, Draco leaned—fell—back on the steering wheel, yelping when the sound of the car’s horn startled him even further. The adrenaline that had already been flooding Draco’s entire body multiplied faster than he’d ever thought possible.
Now, as he fell asleep, Hermione took a moment to smile at how far he had come. She was glad that he was still able to let her in, to come to her. Harry’s breathing evened out, and Hermione settled down into the pillows to take a nap as well, her head on top of Harry’s.
“Really?” Draco blurted, his voice rising with each word, his fingers curled into fists. “You didn’t appear very uncomfortable to me, Harry! You seemed just fine, chatting it up with your ex-boyfriend while I was sitting
Harry had figured that, if he’d made such a mess of himself and his painting, then surely Draco deserved to have his feathers ruffled as well. Hence, the streaks of paint all over his face: sky blue cutting through his left eyebrow and down his cheek, pineapple yellow fingerprints from his chin to his ear, lavender purple smeared down his nose and the corner of his lips. His face had practically turned into a rainbow.
Blaise only shook his head in disbelief and leaned forward to get a poke in for himself. Harry’s smile was crooked when he looked at an aghast Blaise, who continued to nudge at him like he was making sure it was real. “
him. His breathing was still heavy and uneven, his one hand was still knotted in Harry’s hair, the other fixed on his shoulder. The taste of him was still on Draco’s tongue, peppermint and something citrusy- like grapefruit. When he looked back at Harry, his green eyes were dark with desire. His hands continued caressing the pale skin on his torso, the scrape of his rough calluses against his skin made the blond boy tremble. He bent his head down to proceed kissing up the column of Draco’s neck, up to his jaw.
Anyway, I hope you liked the chapter!! I really hope it will satisfy you for the few weeks I won't be able to update. Comments are always amazing!!
Curled around his boyfriend under the comforter, Harry felt an indescribable warmth fill every pore and crevice in his body. Laying there with Draco—both of them languidly exploring the other’s body with their fingertips in a way that felt lovingly intimate rather than sexual—felt like complete heaven. Like pieces of himself simply melted into place with Draco. Like Draco’s hands on his skin was a revelation from the highest of powers, telling him:
As a sort of separate note, I hope that you all can find the courage to stand up for yourselves and for your fellow human beings in today's world, especially for pride month and for the BLM protesters trying to change our world. We're doing good work in the face of such adversity, and the world is long overdue for change. Lots of love to everyone out there!
The words slowly sunk in. Harry pressed Draco even closer to his body as if he could chase away his tears.
Hermione had looked excited, up until he said his name. Her eyes went wide, her brow furrowed, and her mouth opened slightly. She looked down at her hands, which were clenched together so tightly that it seemed she was about to break her own fingers.
Draco watched with amusement as Harry nearly choked on his orange juice. Though a laugh tumbled from his lips, it was weak and strained.
“Pansy said you liked your lotions and such, so I brought you to the best ones. I figured you’d like it,” Harry’s brow furrowed, and Draco could feel his arms tense under his hands, “Do you? Like it, I mean.”
Running his tongue over his lips, Cedric languidly looked Harry up and down again before stating in a low voice, “I’ll be there.” His grey eyes finally seemed to notice Draco’s presence, but he didn’t seem fazed. His mouth stretched in an almost smug-looking smirk. He ran his hand through his already-mussed hair before looking at Hermione.
Harry abandoned the toiletries he’d been packing and walked over to where Draco stood by his bed. He could practically feel the agitation oozing off of the smaller boy as he gently hugged him from behind, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist and hunching over to set his chin on his shoulder. The fabric of his pull-over sweater was soft against his hands. He felt Draco freeze, then all the tension seemed to melt from his body. His arms dropped to his sides and his head came back to rest on Harry’s shoulder.
Harry exited the shower, threw his clothes on as fast as humanly possible, and made his way to the door. But not before seeing all of his teammates, apparently waiting for him. Harry swallowed past the lump in his throat, shifting his face into what he hoped was a passable smile.
Draco knew he was being slightly unreasonable. He was well aware that Harry was captain of the football team and therefore couldn’t miss practices or meetings. He knew that Harry wanted to be with him as much as Draco wanted to be with Harry.
The sternness in her gaze immediately commanded Draco’s compliance. “Promise me that you’ll stay calm.”
With something between a chuckle and a suffering sigh, Harry explained, “It’s just Teddy. One second.” He set the phone down, so all Draco could see on his screen was the bedroom’s ceiling—which had glow-in-the-dark stars on it.
“Draco, you haven’t been doing anything naughty on that phone of yours, have you?” Pansy teased, her dark purple lips pulled into an almost malicious grin.
“Draco, you need to stay calm,” Hermione said. Her black eyes flitted between him and Harry, who had let out a terrified whimper. Draco’s heart squeezed and his entire body ached to touch him, but he didn’t know if that was okay. “If you can’t stay calm, I’ll need you to leave. Right now, Harry can feel all the panicked and frightened energy in the room, and he can’t tell the difference between it and his own.”
Draco snatched the hoodie the moment Blaise gave it to Harry, pulling it over his head. It was a deep navy blue fabric that was soft to the touch. Had he been standing, he was sure the hoodie would have almost completely covered his thighs with how big it was on him—he was able to wrap the ends of the sleeves around his hands and he still had plenty of room. He buried his nose in the fabric, surrounded by the familiar, comforting smell of Harry. The cold left him almost immediately.
Finally, he managed to dig the cell phone out of Draco’s pocket without dislodging him from his clinging position, Harry looked at the caller ID. He took a moment trying to register what he was seeing.
“Harry,” she whispered softly, “honey, it’s not your fault. It’s nobody’s fault, I promise you.” Hermione’s heart fractured when she saw a tear trickle from Harry’s closed eyes. His brow was furrowed, his lips were pressed together—like he was trying to keep the thoughts inside his head, attempting to control the screams begging to be released.
in front of his boyfriend for the first time. His face was swept with a new wave of scarlet. He felt his fingers twitch. He knew for certain that he wasn’t bad-looking. But he wasn’t… Harry’s level of good-looking. (Harry was the type of handsome that was obvious. He was the kind of handsome that had you looking twice and then staring for as long as possible until he looked in your direction. Draco was sharper in his beauty, he was more fine-boned, thin and lean. He was the type of handsome that wasn’t obvious at first glance. He was the sort of handsome that had you analyzing his features, trying to figure out what it was about him that was appealing.)
The other boy’s mouth opened to argue, to protest, but his eyes widened as he realized that Harry was teasing. He looked down again and flushed even more as he said, “Shut up, Harry, you know what I meant.”
He was too busy carding his fingers through Harry’s soft, black hair. He was too occupied panting into Harry’s mouth, straddling his legs over Harry’s on the soft, worn couch. Draco couldn’t care less that they were in public, the way his boyfriend’s tongue swept lazily against his own made him dizzy, unable to concentrate on anything but the sensations of being so close to Harry and yet wanting to be so much closer. He could hardly focus on the feel of Harry’s hands gripping his hips, let alone everyone else in the room.
“Someone’s on cloud nine, eh?” Blaise said from the doorway. Draco didn’t even bother moving to look at him. Instead, he closed his eyes and let out what must have been the most pathetic sounding high-pitched sigh he’d ever made. He could practically feel Blaise’s eyebrows shoot up. He felt the bed dip down with his weight as Blaise sat on the bed next to where Draco had flopped on it.
“You know,” Sirius said in between fits of laughter, “I’m still a little jealous that he only ever gets like this with
in love with you.” Tracing the lines of Harry’s face with his pale fingers, Draco drew him even closer. “I need you to know that when you don’t feel safe, when you feel out of control or afraid or
Harry glanced over Draco’s shoulder, and his smile widened as he laughed. “You can even bring your friends,” he chuckled. Draco whipped his head back to look at his friends, only to see Blaise laughing at him and Pansy smiling wickedly.
He heard Harry’s sharp intake of breath, his gaze focused on Draco’s ribs. Draco looked down, only to see a large purple and blue bruise covering the expanse of his right ribs. Memories of falling down the stairs flashed through his mind—he couldn’t really recall everything that had happened, but he knew it was a possibility that he’d slammed his side on one of the stairs at some point.
Quickly following him out, Harry locked the car behind him and then gripped Draco’s hand, walking with him inside. The inside of the store was even more colorful if a little disorganized. The whole place carried the aroma of incense, a sweet and flowery smell that Harry couldn’t say he didn’t like. It smelled like the early spring air that had surrounded them outside.
“It’s nothing bad, I promise!” Harry laughed, having seen Draco stiffen. “It’s just, Hermione was saying something earlier, and it got me thinking… Do you, um… Would you want to be my boyfriend?”
But, just as the call was about to end, Draco answered, cursing under his breath. He was greeted by a smiling Harry leaning against the wooden headboard of what must be his bed, with his glasses perched on his nose and what looked like a dog—Snuffles, if he remembered right—laying across his lap.
“And second,” Draco continued, not allowing Harry to second-guess anything he said, “you don’t frighten me, Harry. You didn’t freak me out. It’s not your fault that you have these attacks. It’s not something you can control.” Taking both of Harry’s hands in his own, Draco ignored the judgmental stares they were receiving from passing students and kissed each of Harry’s calloused knuckles. “I don’t love you
“Where are we going?” Theo asked, nearly shoving Pansy off his lap and into the window to get closer to them. Draco looked around his seat just in time to see her violently smack him upside the head. His hand went to his hair and he turned to her with wide eyes and his brows drawn together.
He saw the near madness burning in his gaze, reflected in the way he almost fouled on Nicole—roughly but efficiently stealing the ball back with a complex maneuver Harry had only shown him once. It was messy and needed work, but he had the ball back.
“You’re thinking too hard,” Harry muttered in a sleep-deepened voice, “I can feel it.” The vibrations of his voice sent a pleasant tingle down Draco’s spine.
to see her suffer as he had. To see that flame of hers flicker and sputter—much like his own had. There was no doubt in his entire body that he would do the best he could to help her breathe that fire back to life.
Luckily for him, and the rest of the football team, Coach Hooch walked in, blowing her neon orange whistle to get their attention. “Alright, you sweaty pigs, you’re off for the night,” at this, there were several sighs of relief and exhaustion among the already heavy breathing, “and take the weekend to rest up before we get started again Monday afternoon.” Here there were mixed signals, hollers of joy for the weekend, and groans at the mention of Monday.
Ron’s face reddened, almost the same shade of his hair. His eyes had taken on an angry glint, his voice rising.
“Hi,” Draco breathed. He curled himself tighter under his thick blanket, a smile tugging at his mouth. “How are you?”
Lucius had been the one to arrange them. Conveniently following after Draco had come out to his parents as gay. Luckily for him, however, none of the few therapists he’d seen had seemed to have any interest in his father’s agenda. Most were actually quite nice.
Narcissa chuckled. “Is that so?” She leaned over and poked him in the ribs, whispering in his ear, “Is there something specific that made it so…
Blood rushed to Draco’s face. He felt it staining his skin; his ears felt hot. The sheets were crumpled in his twitching fingers. He wasn’t ashamed of Harry—not in a million years—but he knew some of the things he’d written in his letters were a bit… embarrassing. Humiliating. Cliche. Juvenile. But in his defense, Harry was someone he thought was
Harry smiled wider when Draco’s face flushed red once again, this time reaching even his ears. Draco looked around for a second and realized that there were only a few other passengers who were actually awake, seeing as it was so early in the morning.
“You know,” Draco said, his voice thick and wobbling, both of his hands coming to tangle in the hair at the nape of Harry’s neck, “deep confessions of love like that aren’t usually meant to be made when your godfather is less than ten feet away and you’re about to leave.”
“Well,” Harry replied with a teasing lilt in his voice, “if that’s the only thing you like me for, I guess that’ll have to be good enough for me.” Taking the cloth from Draco’s hands, Harry turned his boyfriend to face him, holding his jaw, and gently dabbed at the remaining paint. Luckily for both of them, it hadn’t dried yet and was still relatively easy to clean off.
Draco nodded before giving her a quick embrace and leaving the empty classroom, making his way for Harry’s common room.
“Three months, three weeks, and three days,” Draco said, straightening his shoulders at the giggle that came from her. He’d proudly kept track of every single day he’d gotten the privilege to call Harry his boyfriend. Blaise had eventually stopped teasing him about it. Those were two weeks that Draco would rather not relive.
Once they stood in the center of the bathroom, Draco felt Harry’s hands drift down to the bottom of his hoodie. Warm fingers dipped underneath the soft fabric, brushing against the skin at Draco’s hips. Harry’s eyes were questioning—like he was asking for permission. Draco was slightly surprised to find that he wasn’t the least bit embarrassed as he shucked the hoodie over his head, letting it fall to the floor.
Draco took a moment to calm himself—taking deep breaths and banishing the images from his mind—before he turned on the warm water in the bathtub. He waited for it to fill up about halfway before sliding his briefs off and stepping in the water. The warm, borderline hot water immediately made his body start to relax as he sat down and let it surround him.
Katie finally finished, lifting the bar onto the hooks and sitting up. Harry grinned as she wiped at her forehead. Her shoulders sagged as he walked around to face her and sat down, straddling the bench and facing her. She looked up and scowled at his grin.
“When was the last time you slept, love?” Harry asked gently, brushing away strands of blond hair that had fallen in front of his face. Draco grabbed his hand, holding it to his downturned face.
Rather, it was the feeling of hope that made Draco smile. No matter how many bad days lay in their future, they could always rise with the sun the next morning and make something better.
Harry analyzed his face, then grunted, “You have five minutes. Make it good,” and turned back to his locker. Draco hesitated as if he couldn’t believe that Harry had actually given him a chance, then began talking.
Draco felt himself smile and felt the mood lighten when he looked up to see Harry gazing at him with something akin to affection in his eyes. At least, Draco
Sympathy and concern shone on both Remus and Sirius’ faces. Their eyes took on that familiar gleam that screamed their shared worry.
A moment of tense silence passed before Ron looked each of them in the eye and then walked away, to the common room door and out into the corridor. Harry finally allowed himself to relax, uncurling his fist from Pansy’s shirt. He felt Hermione’s fingers pry from his shoulders. She slid down off the couch to the floor, squeezing herself into the space between Harry and the couch, wrapping her arms around his waist from behind, resting her forehead against his back.
“Harry, come here a minute, will you?” Came Alicia’s voice from behind Katie, who had finished her rant and was tying off her hair. Harry made his way to her, giving Fred a playful shove out of his way, just hard enough to knock him into George.
Draco hesitantly lifted his hands to the expanse of Harry’s back. The instant his fingers touched the scar tissue, another sob wracked his chest. He bit his lip so roughly he tasted blood. The scars were raised and rigid, slightly bumpy under his touch. And there were
His father cut him off. Harry could hear the sharp tone the man used. Indignation bubbled in his gut, heating his blood. It was quickly vanquished when Harry caught sight of the defeated expression on Draco’s face. A flooding concern took its place.
his thoughts were too occupied with questions he wanted to ask Harry. He was just now realizing how little he knew about Harry’s life. Sure, he knew
“I,” the red-headed boy swallowed hard, “I’m so sorry, Harry. I’m sorry for saying those awful things to you, for just assuming the worst of you.” Ron removed one hand from his pockets to rub at the back of his neck. “Ginny came and told me everything. Almost beat me up for being so stupid. I know you didn’t just… I’m sorry. I was horrible to you.”
Looking at Harry, Draco ran his hands up the other boy’s deliciously brown chest, marveling at the smoothness of his skin. One hand came to rest against his face while the other tangled in his hair, lightly scratching and massaging his scalp. He bumped his nose against Harry’s and threw his leg over his hip, drawing his body closer to the taller boy’s. Their stomachs pressed together and Harry’s arms circled closer around Draco’s waist and hips. The tips of his fingers rested just above the waistband of his sweatpants—well, more accurately, Harry’s sweatpants that Draco had borrowed. The smaller boy leaned up to press his forehead against Harry’s. He tried to absorb the warmth that exuded from him, the same warmth that had filled his bones every time he was near his boyfriend. It wrapped around him like a blanket, comforting and… safe.
Harry whipped his head up to see Draco sprinting down the driveway, his face blotchy and sobs still breaking from his mouth. He barely registered that his boyfriend was wearing his sweatpants and his hoodie as he shoved the gates open to run to him.
“Dray, I can practically feel you stewing,” Harry said, gently breaking the stretched silence. “Whatever it is, just spit it out.”
“Draco!” She exclaimed, rushing forward and pulling Draco into a quick hug. “I haven’t seen you walk through those doors in far too long!”
He fought off the apprehension burrowing in his bones. Slowly, Draco reached out a trembling hand to pull the large door open. But just before his fingertips touched, Harry gripped his hand and pulled it to his chest. Draco’s fingers instantly gripped his worn t-shirt like he was holding on for support.
“That’s understandable,” Sirius admitted, “and it’s okay to feel that way. But I hope you’ll both keep an open mind for each other and try to fix your friendship. Even if he has been a complete jackass.”
“Are you—,” Harry paused, dropping his gaze to the floor and reaching up to rub at the back of his neck, “are you mad at me? Is there something I did to upset you?” His green eyes darted a glance at Draco’s tensing jaw. “I know that Cedric was… I know that he was being an ass, and he was making everyone uncomfortable—shit, he made
angry before I got to him, and when I asked him what was wrong, he said he couldn’t tell me. But he asked me to meet him in the library after class so we could study together and he would tell me then. He said something about needing to get back to Hermione.”
But the voices hadn’t come through until he stopped moving. Once he felt himself be lowered—onto something soft, a bed maybe?—his body moved without his consent, curling in on himself. Maybe if he made himself smaller, the fear would ignore him. Maybe if he took up less space, his heart would stop beating up his ribs. Maybe his lungs would start remembering how to breathe.
And just then, the sleeping boy curled more into Harry’s side, grabbing onto his arm and pressing his side into Harry’s. His ribs were pressed into the arm rest, so Harry slowly used his right arm to lift it back up so that the blonde could be more comfortable. His fingers curled around Harry’s arm were cold, seemingly sucking out Harry’s heat, but he didn’t mind. The blonde cuddled so tightly to Harry that there was almost no space between their bodies
“Hi.” Draco smiled against the nape of Harry’s neck. “Someone’s still as devastatingly handsome as ever, I see.”
Fondly shaking his head, Harry caught up to Draco and laced his fingers through his boyfriend’s free hand. The miffed pout on his pink lips could have easily been one of the most adorable things Harry had ever seen. Gently, he leaned down and pressed a soft, tender kiss to Draco’s mouth, smirking at how he chased for more.
Harry simply smirked harder and nodded his head, which sent Snape away to another student’s table to bark at them about how they were failing.
“I… I-uh… Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to sleep on you, I guess I was just really tired, I’m-”
She shook her head. Draco was about to say something, demand that she tell him what she meant when Harry stirred and pulled Hermione impossibly closer to himself. Both of them snapped their heads toward him, but he remained asleep.
Ron looked skeptical. “Who is it then? It’s been a bit since you’ve gone after a guy. Wasn’t the last one that Krum fellow who was only here for like a month?”
A squeal stole out of Draco’s throat as the rain fell on him. It was more than a sprinkle, but he could see just fine and he wouldn’t get soaked for a while. It was a cold shock compared to how warm he had been just seconds ago. He heard Harry laughing, his face tilted upwards as if he were trying to drink in the rain.
“Hermione, have I ever told you how amazing you are?” Harry said in jest. Hermione snickered as she flipped her curly hair over her shoulder and replying, “No, I don’t believe you have. Now would be the perfect time to do so.” She made to walk out the door before Harry gasped and said in a rush, “Wait, wait, wait!”
As much as it pained him, Harry pulled away but didn’t go far. His hands cupped Draco’s face, thumbs wiping away the trails of tears going down his cheeks. “Baby, what happened?”
“Of course I do, I’m not stupid Ron,” Harry said, a snap to his voice that he rarely used, “but this time is different. He does go here. We both thought it was weird that we hadn’t run into each other before, but he does go here.”
So, walking as quickly as possible, Harry rushed out of the locker rooms through the back exit, into the school, through the halls, and into his common room.
He shook his head slightly, and talked into her hair, “All he needed was a push, really.” He shook his head again and kissed her forehead just as he heard her sniffle, just slightly. She let go of him after he told her she was squeezing the breath out of him. She smacked his arm lightly.
“Yeah, everything’s fine.” Draco pushed off the wall and met him in the middle. “I just… I know that Snape’s been driving you crazy, and I wanted to see if you were up for anything tonight.”
When he finally managed to disentangle himself from Harry and walk into class, Draco felt that familiar warmth that came from simply being near his boyfriend begin to fade, until all that remained was an ember at the bottom of his heart. However, he wasn’t able to stop smiling throughout the entire hour of boring lectures and homework assignments.
Harry was more than aware that leading Draco into the cafe could mean putting him through one of the biggest embarrassments of his life—but he trusted Sirius to take it easy on him. Especially since it would be the first time either of them met the other. And he trusted Remus to make Draco as comfortable as possible, and Harry hoped that he would help to at least reel his godfather in.
with her. He hadn’t slept since he’d left Hogwarts—no matter how hard he’d tried, how long he’d lay in bed for, sleep evaded him. The dark circles growing under his eyes were a nightmare to look at.
Looking in the rearview mirror as he started the car, he saw Hermione glance at Blaise—who was laughing at Pansy smacking away Theo’s hands on her waist—and then look back down at her fiddling hands, the smallest of smiles on her face. He knew what that meant; he’d seen it more times than he could count. A devilish smile split his lips. He was looking forward to talking to her about this later.
For a moment, Harry thought Joan was going to interrogate him further, but to his relief, her face softened and she finally seemed to accept his answer.
Harry knew that Draco was slightly upset at Harry’s absence in recent days, but he also knew—or hoped—that Draco wasn’t really
He was too tired to feel anything that he was saying. Harry’s mind and body had been too full for too long, he would work through what he felt tomorrow. For now, he just wanted to get it off his chest. He just needed someone else to know.
“God, yes,” Harry panted back, his warm breath fanning over Draco’s neck. And just like that, Draco’s briefs were pulled off his legs, and he was left completely bare while Harry trailed his lips up his right thigh. He reached into his nightstand drawer, and Draco saw him bring out a small bottle and a condom. “Tell me if you want me to stop, alright?”
Harry howled with laughter, and it was such a wonderful sound that Draco couldn’t even stay mad at him. He even thought he heard his boyfriend snort, he was laughing so hard. Shaking his head, Draco just grabbed his hand and continued walking to his common room. The laughter only started dying down after he—completely accidentally—stepped on Harry’s foot. Hard.
When they reached the common room, Harry pressed a soft kiss to Draco’s forehead in farewell. The shorter boy glowed at the affection, and he felt a new sort of peace wash over him.
Distantly, Harry heard Draco’s footsteps against the tile as he strode out of the bathroom. Emotions warred within Harry at the thought of Draco leaving him—fear, sorrow, sympathy—but he didn’t have long to worry about it. Coughing, Harry finally managed to stop vomiting just as he heard Draco walk back in.
Opening the door to Number 12 Grimmauld Place was like breathing in fresh air after being stuck underwater. Familiar smells of sandalwood, vanilla, and jasmine surrounded Harry as he looked down the familiar hallway, which was lined with countless framed photos. Sirius’ hand on his shoulder and the smile on his face reminded him of the first time he’d walked through this door—one of the happiest days of Harry’s life.
“Wait, wait, wait,” Harry blurted, eyes wide as he gaped at Pansy across from him, “he was cheating with
“Yeah.” Draco could barely hold eye contact, and his face was just as flushed as it had been the night before when he’d called Harry. His fingers twitched at his sides, and Harry could see his feet shuffling ever so slightly while his brow furrowed.
“Mr. Malfoy, it’s nice to meet you,” Harry gritted out. Draco could see the tension in his broad shoulders, and it was at this moment that he realized that Harry was bigger than even his
“Shouldn’t we move him somewhere quiet?” Draco asked. Slowly reaching forward, he placed his hand over the one Harry had fisted in his hair, gently trying to disentangle his fingers. He winced at the fearful whine that came from Harry’s lips. “Or with some light?”
Warm bath water swirled around Draco’s legs. He was sitting back against Harry’s chest, in between his legs with his strong arms wrapped around his waist. His boyfriend had had to carry him to the bathtub, his body was so limp, so exhausted.
Draco’s trail of thoughts disappeared as the laptop hit the bed, as Hermione closed the door behind her. He turned back to face Harry, who was rummaging through the basket and pulled out a container of sandwiches.
And Harry loved every second of it: the coddling, the cuddling, all of it. He was usually expected to be the supportive one, the first one to offer a shoulder to cry on, the one that offered comfort, protection, love. And while he loved being that person, there were times that the pressure threatened to strangle him. But with Draco, it was more of an even balance. They were both there for each other, both of them supported one another)
Despite his facade of a complaint, Draco felt impossibly warm like this. His skin against Harry’s, the feel of him so close, with Harry’s arms wrapped around him and holding him to his chest, it all made him feel so
Nodding, Draco moved so that his mouth was close to Harry’s ear. But before he could start speaking, he spied Ronald staring at him with a wary gleam in his eyes. Though the flashlight was still the only source of light, Draco hoped the boy saw the contemptuous glare he sent him before returning his full attention to the trembling boy in his arms.
What'd you guys think of Hermione's POV? I'm a little nervous that I didn't do her justice. I hope you guys liked this chapter! I love getting comments! I mean, kudos are great, but comments are like a jackpot! :)
“Harry, as much as I love this,” Draco said, his voice incredibly breathy even to his own ears, “I have a feeling that Seamus isn’t kidding.” It took every ounce of his strength to untangle his fingers from Harry’s hair and pry them from the muscle at his shoulder. The other boy snickered into his neck as he gently pulled his hands away, running his palms over every inch of skin he could reach in the process.
The scarlet flush and baffled look on Draco’s face would have made for an adorable combination if Harry’s brain hadn’t still been going a mile a minute, trying to process everything that had just happened while also calming itself.
Harry had managed to get closer to all of Draco’s friends. He’d learned that Pansy loved the color green and giving surprisingly sound advice, that Blaise had a younger brother and sister-twins-that he absolutely adored. He’d managed to worm his way through Theo’s tough shell, and now shared a smile and a wave whenever he saw the other boy.
Tugging his boyfriend to follow him, Draco promptly turned on his heel and traipsed toward the center of the field where the rest of the team awaited them. A sense of twisted bliss and satisfaction bloomed in the pit of Draco’s stomach.
Hermione nodded her head, but Harry wasn’t sure she was entirely convinced. He figured she wouldn’t be for a long while.
“You think that I… I wasn’t… I…” Draco could see Harry’s eyes widen in what looked like panic, his breath was coming faster, his hand was gripping the hair at the back of his neck. The other boy closed his eyes and his shoulders moved with deep, rhythmic breaths. His lips were moving—apparently without his knowledge. It looked like he was counting.
conversation with his mother when it could have gone in so many other directions. “We’re not having sex!”
“Mr. Potter, care to explain what you’re doing out and about at this time of night?” came the telltale voice of someone who was most
Harry kissed his fingertips as they passed over his lips. He removed his hand from Draco’s hip and intertwined his fingers with those of Draco’s that had been touching his face. He kissed the smaller boy’s white knuckles, a small smile spreading on Draco’s lips.
I was more like his punching bag than a nephew, and Petunia couldn’t have cared less if not for the mess he left behind.”
. He started saying things about how I was wasting my time, how this is why he couldn’t get me into Oxford or Cambridge… I tried to hide my sketchbook and he… he started
“You’re going to tell Hermione everything you just told me. You’re going to apologize to her, and you’re going to mean it with every fiber of your being,” Draco’s mouth opened like he was going to protest, but Harry lifted his hand and continued, “I may be interested in you, Draco, but she’s my best friend, and there’s no way in
“Okay, really, people are trying to eat here, you two.” Pansy mocked gagging. “Stop being so… touchy-feely and nasty.”
“Save it for another day, Theo,” Pansy said, drawing him onto the couch to sit beside Draco, “when you have some actual backup. Besides, I already broke his nose. It’d be cruel to let you at him already.”
“Nice to see you, Hermione.” Cedric’s hands went to his lap under the table. “How are you these days?”
Sirius murmured to him, “Shh, Harry, you’re safe. You’re safe, my beautiful boy. Shh…” Dropping his head to Sirius’ shoulder, Harry let his godfather’s words wash over him in soothing waves. His hands ran up and down Harry’s back, lovingly and tenderly. “Breathe, son. Deep breaths, you’re safe, shh…”
“Don’t say it, please.” Harry stopped at the doorway to the locker room, gazing down into his boyfriend’s saddened grey eyes. “‘Sorry’ doesn’t change anything, baby. I appreciate the sentiment, though. Really.”
“Okay,” he started, mesmerized by those beautiful, enchanting grey eyes, “okay, I have to go, but I’ll text you, okay?”
A horrible, awful sort of feeling settled over Harry. His hand started running up and down Draco’s back in an attempt to soothe him.
Draco’s shoulders lifted with a deep sigh. Harry watched as his boyfriend reached out his hand and pulled the door open, seemingly in slow motion. Sunlight poured into the previously dim entrance hallway. Nervously, Harry followed Draco outside onto the steps that led to the doors. His eyes immediately caught on the absurdly expensive-looking black car that was parked in the cul-de-sac in front of the steps.
“Harry’s just going to bring these up to the dorm with me,” Draco said, cutting off his friends before they could say anything stupid.
Sorry I'm late on the update, guys. With Christmas and all my drama going on, it's been hard to find time to write. But, I did it, and better late than never. So, I hope this isn't complete trash, and that you guys enjoy it.
“On the field in three minutes, team,” she ordered. “Don’t you dare be late.” With that, she pivoted out the door. Harry could hear the crowds in the stands, cheering and shouting. His heart raced faster, his grin widened.
Harry dropped down from the pull-up bar, surveying the rest of the gym to make sure none of his teammates were slacking off. He knew that they were all tired,
Harry seemed to search his eyes before speaking. “Hermione has had… feelings, I guess you could say, for Ron for a couple of years now. But he’s never really caught on to it, never even thought of Hermione that way. But today, we walked into the Great Hall and Ron was,” Harry paused, looking at the ceiling and letting out an almost disbelieving almost-laugh before looking back at Draco and continuing, “He was making out with Lavender Brown.”
So, with a long-suffering sigh, Harry began, “I guess Snape has this whole… grudge thing, against my father. I guess they went to school together or something when they were our age, I don’t know. But Snape never misses an opportunity to say something insulting about him.” Harry paused when he saw Draco looking up at him. The next words were harder to get out, it was a fight to get them past his lips. But he knew that if he didn’t say them now, it would be harder later. “It just sucks, because I didn’t get to know my father enough to prove him wrong.” He felt his boyfriend lay his head against his shoulder, the shorter boy wrapping his hand that wasn’t in Harry’s around his arm.
The expression on Draco’s face when Harry looked at him was a medley of gratitude and quiet pain—Harry realized that talking about his art must remind him of the night before, of what his father had done.
“No!” Draco sputtered, “No, of course not, Pansy!” His face felt hot again. Why was he blushing so much recently? What was it about Harry that made Draco’s blood go hot and rush to his face in the most embarrassing moments? Draco immediately set his phone down, hoping that the conversation would end there.
Draco.” It was at that moment that Harry knew that his godfather practically adored his boyfriend. What with the awe in his eyes, and the clear approval of Remus’ nodding head, there was no way that either of them thought badly of Draco. “Have you thought about making a career out of this? Going to art school?”
“Can you keep a secret? Like, you can’t even tell your friends, because Hermione would kill me if she knew I told anyone,” Harry said, his voice had turned more serious, his eyes beseeching.
Harry wouldn’t admit he was nervous. For the most part, he wasn’t. For the most part, he was sure that Draco would love what he had planned. There was just a small part of his brain that was worried Draco would absolutely
Draco finally felt Harry’s chest movements begin to slow. Though it was still too shallow and fast to be considered calming, Draco would take what successes he could.
Harry dropped his head onto Draco’s shoulder, his breathing a little off-kilter, and then started laughing. Draco didn’t even have the chance to regain his breath before he began chuckling, only half trying to keep it quiet since they were in the library.
Draco turned to the next row of lockers to find Harry standing at his open locker, his hair damp and dressed only in sweatpants. This time, however, Harry seemed to hear him before Draco could get a close view of his back. And the scars that laced it. He turned around, every movement looked slow and aching. Draco walked to his boyfriend (Draco’s heart still skipped a beat when he thought that word to himself, or when he heard it out loud. Harry Potter was his
It was truly ridiculous how much Harry had missed his boyfriend over the course of two and a half days. Enough that he’d caught himself wishing that he’d simply brought Draco with him. Stuffed him in with his luggage, perhaps. He’d certainly fit, even if it was a bit squishy. Harry’s lips twitched into a laughing smile at the thought.
Harry caught Draco looking at him and pointed out, “That’s Sirius behind me. That picture was taken the day Astrid was born.” Draco looked up at his boyfriend to see him smiling affectionately down at Astrid.
This seemed to brighten their moods the smallest bit. They all gave him the same somber smile, and nodded at him, giving him permission to leave. Harry turned to go through the door, but just as his fingers touched the doorknob, Angelina exclaimed, “Draco’s waiting for you outside.”
Draco thought. He shoved his hands into his pockets, dropping her gaze. “I just… I don’t like the thought of someone else with Harry. Yeah, sure, I didn’t like that Cedric talked to Harry, I didn’t like that Harry didn’t tell him to screw off.” Draco’s frustration returned, he scraped his hands through his hair. “I don’t know, Pansy! I just… I want to be with Harry and I want Harry to want to be with
Anyway, I really hope that you guys enjoy this chapter, it's the longest one yet, hopefully that makes up for my absence.
Harry had been right, the game against Durmstrang academy had been a close one. But Hogwarts had won.
Harry—” Draco’s sentences cut off at Harry’s nodding. Tears started flowing from his shattered eyes. He knew the scars that laced his skin weren’t pretty to look at, but he also knew that they could have been much,
Nodding, Harry watched as Hermione reluctantly stood and walked out with a glance over her shoulder before closing the door behind her.
“Me too,” Draco answered, receiving a pat on the back before Sirius smiled and took the backpack he’d been carrying, then got in the car.
“I missed you, too,” Draco whispered, his long fingers slowly and soothingly threading through Harry’s unruly, slightly damp hair. “I missed you a lot.”
“Draco, baby, listen to me, okay?” Harry paused and waited until Draco gave a weak “okay” as affirmation. “It’s not your fault. I wasn’t paying enough attention. It’s my fault,
Luckily, Draco was far enough from the field that Harry would pay him no notice. Oh, but Draco noticed everything about Harry. Especially the fact that Harry was leading the pack of running humans.
“Do you think…” Harry swallowed thickly, “do you feel like I’ve been... neglecting you? Since Draco and I started dating?”
Draco’s heart would have stopped right there if his phone hadn’t started ringing next to his ear. Jerking it away from his face, he saw that it was Harry calling—only it was a video call, instead.
“No, no I’ll hold out until dinner. Besides, I don’t think I could live with myself if I let you buy anything else for me,” Draco said dramatically.
“Granger,” he paused, swallowed hard, “Hermione. I… um. I just, I know that what I said to you was awful, and horrible, and I’m so sorry.” Draco swallowed again, he couldn’t seem to dislodge the horrible feelings there. “I grew up with a father who has no regard for colored people-”
And there stood the last thing Draco had expected to see: Ron Weasley, panting like he’d been running and holding a flashlight.
Theo’s reaction was immediate. His face hardened to stone, every muscle in his body tensed, the scowl adorning his face foretold of violence. A guttural, animalistic sound that Draco would almost call growling came from his throat.
“Of course I’ll be okay with that.” Harry’s hand on Draco’s thigh resumed its soothing rubbing motions. “Whatever you want to do today, kitten, we’ll do it.” He leaned forward and softly pressed his lips to Draco’s, such a different sensation than a few minutes ago.
Harry. All of it. Every contradicting emotion and thought in his mind and body threatened to stifle the very breath that gave him life. Crying, sobbing like a child made him feel weak—but he couldn’t find it in himself to stop. He was so impossibly relieved to be going home to his family, and yet, he was…
Sighing, knowing she was right, Draco was finally able to pry Harry’s fingers from his hair, instead twining their fingers together and softly squeezing. Harry gripped Draco’s fingers with iron strength. His eyes shot open, blown wide. Even in the darkness, Draco could tell that Harry wasn’t really seeing him. He wasn’t seeing much of
Sirius had parked his jet-black car in the cul de sac driveway in front of the academy; he stood leaning against the driver-side door. Just seeing his godfather made Harry feel instantly more relaxed. A small, sad smile appeared on Sirius’ face, just as Harry felt the tears building behind his eyes. It was like his own dam cracked and broke free, the pressure too much for it to hold.
They stayed like that for what felt like hours—just sitting together in the silence of the locker room. But despite the warmth that had blossomed throughout Draco’s entire body, he couldn’t ignore the niggling feeling in the back of his mind that told him that there was something more—something that Harry hadn’t told him yet.
Draco followed Harry into the common room and into Harry’s dorm, where the bigger boy stashed his gym bag under his bed. And then promptly flopped onto said bed, an arm thrown over his face, the other reaching for Draco; who then hastily took Harry’s hand and crawled across the sheets-which were nowhere near as silky as Draco’s own-to curl into the bigger boy’s body, trying to absorb the heat he always seemed to emanate. Those green eyes were only inches, if that, from his own, hooded and heavy and exhausted. Everything smelled like Harry, Draco was swimming, drowning in his scent, an intoxicating combination of peppermint, orange, and vanilla.
Hermione interrupted his thoughts with a raised brow in his direction. “Well? I’m not going to stand around here wasting my time waiting for you to put two words together, Malfoy,” she hissed.
Draco hesitated. “I mean... I don’t know. I guess.” His tongue darted out over his lips, his hands twitched where they lay on Harry’s thighs. “I just—don’t want to feel like I don’t know what I’m doing, or that I can’t—that you don’t want someone who doesn’t know how to—”
The newest member of their team looked around at his teammates. Ever so slowly, the worry melted off his face, leaving the smallest of smiles behind. Lastly, he looked back at Harry, who felt a spark of pride in his chest. He’d given similar pep-talks to each and every one of his teammates and been on the receiving end of them more than once. The other boy’s eyes had lost the majority of their uncertainty, his shoulders lost most of their tension.
Theo didn’t move when Harry sat beside him on the bench. Harry knew he was trying to compose himself, trying to collect his fears behind a facade of confidence, attempting to prove that he was ready. The captain set a hand on Theo’s shoulder.
Her dark eyes were sad as she said, “I wish I could stay, love.” She leaned in and hugged him tightly, pressing her lips to his forehead. “I’ll see you in the morning.”
Harry saw the laughter coming before it burst from Sirius’ mouth. “Just call me Sirius, please.” Letting go of Draco’s hand, the man looked back at Harry. “What nonsense have you been telling this poor boy that he thinks he needs to call me
The memory brought a surge of warmth to his face. He felt the pieces of himself start to fall back into place. Draco picked up his pencil and set it to paper, letting his mind wander as his hands took over.
When Harry stepped back again, he was slightly shocked to see how quick of a learner his boyfriend was. He only had to correct the thumb situation before he was content with how well Draco was doing. And so he returned to his own bag, working up to where he was before he stopped. Soon the sound of Harry’s fists hitting the bag drowned out even Draco’s harsh breaths.
The sun had set by the time Hooch had let the team go. Every muscle, joint, and bone in Harry’s body ached, even as Hermione sat behind him on the couch and rubbed at the muscles in his shoulders. Pansy sat in front of him on the floor with her head tilted back so he could braid her hair. Blaise and Theo were sprawled on the floor beside them, Theo’s head in Pansy’s lap. The northern common room was surprisingly quiet, only a few murmuring voices around them.
In the photo, Harry had tears in his eyes and a smile so bright it was blinding even through the screen. Behind Harry with his hands on Harry’s shoulders was a man with shoulder-length, messy black hair. His face was ever so slightly wrinkled with his grin, his body was thin, and his eyes were shining as he looked down at Astrid.
All the tension that Harry’s body held seemed to melt away, and Draco felt himself relax in return. He pressed closer to the bigger boy’s side, trying to absorb all the warmth that the very early spring atmosphere denied him.
“Two. Cedric and Ginny.” Reading Draco’s blank expression was impossible. His eyes were fixed on Harry’s chest, his brows drawn together ever so slightly. His lips had pressed into a thin line.
He felt Draco take a deep breath before he answered, “You know how I told you my mum’s birthday is on Tuesday?”
Just as Draco was about to open his mouth and say something he was sure he would regret later, Hermione gave him a small, heavyhearted smile and reached her hand out to him, as if beckoning him closer, her other hand
So, this chapter is a little shorter than my previous ones, but there's a surprise POV, so I hope you guys enjoy it! Also, I upped the chapter count so there's that...
The smile on Draco’s face was overflowing with such unadulterated happiness when he declared: “I love you.”
No, he was cuddled up to and wrapped around that gorgeous pair of green eyes he had been obsessing over. He had been sleeping on that pair of brilliant green eyes.
“Not even a little bit.” Draco held up his hand when Pansy’s eyes got that familiar questioning glimmer. “I don’t have any of the information you’re probably about to ask for, Harry didn’t have time to explain anything to me before the bell rang.”
flowers. Since that night he’d told Draco about his parents, his past, his family, he’d been drawing lily flowers. He’d been painting them: Easter lilies, water lilies, daylilies, oriental lilies, calla lilies, trumpet lilies, even lily-of-the-valley. Draco had created pages and pages of lilies, every single one was different and more breathtaking than the last. They were all different colors, different vibrancies, and hues. Each was a different shape, with a different story held within its petals and leaves. When Harry had first seen them, his heart had skipped a beat. His smile had stretched so wide his cheeks ached and his eyes had pricked with tears, he was so unbelievably happy. He’d scooped Draco into his arms and peppered his face with kisses, bathing in the laughter that came from his boyfriend. He’d kissed his artist’s hands, his long, pale fingers. And since then, Draco hasn’t stopped drawing them)
He was sitting at one of the four tables with his friends at lunch, his eyes fixed on an empty conversation with Harry.
Though he knew Sirius was right, Harry couldn’t help but feel an intense sort of apprehension at even the thought. Not wanting to ruin his good mood, he instead focused on his surroundings, the warm atmosphere that had settled over the people he called family.
Draco was dumbfounded. How did someone who came from that sort of background, one that was filled with so much loss and sadness, turn out like Harry?
“Harry,” Hermione was whispering, glancing at Draco’s scared eyes, “I need you to take deep, even breaths, love, or you’re going to get a nose bleed.”
Draco closed his puffy, red-tinged eyes, tilting his chin down to his chest. “I-I was—and, and Father came in—and—” Words sputtered out. His face crumpled and more tears flowed down his face, a choked breath escaped his lips. Harry felt as though someone had sucker-punched him in the stomach.
Draco nodded and took his hand, leading him to the couch. But before he had the chance to sit down, his phone rang in Pansy’s hand.
With deft movements, Harry untied the strings, all the while keeping Draco’s gaze. Draco could tell that his boyfriend was monitoring his every movement, the pattern of his breathing—heavy and staggering as it was—to make sure he was still okay with where he was taking things. It felt as though Draco’s lungs couldn’t get quite enough air—but not in a bad way. It was like the adrenaline made it impossible to breathe properly. His heart was beating so fast and hard that he was sure Harry could hear it.
And then Draco felt Harry’s tongue caress his bottom lip and he gasped in surprise. Harry seemed to take full advantage and swept his tongue against Draco’s own, evoking a keening noise from the back of Draco’s throat. An entirely new array of sensations tore through his body, he was tugging at Harry’s hair, trying to pull himself closer to him, trying to get more, feel more, he
“Well?” Draco asked suddenly from the passenger seat, pulling Harry’s attention to him, “Did they like me or not?” Anxious energy dripped off of him—he fiddled with his fingers in his lap, his grey eyes were wider than ever, his lips were pressed in a tight line.
upset about, anyway?” Pansy demanded, “That Cedric talked to Harry? That Harry didn’t immediately get rid of him?”
Harry managed a small smirk, letting out a barked laugh. “I’ll damn well confess my undying love to you whenever and wherever I feel like it.”
Sirius had seen his inner turmoil. He’d gotten Harry a dog as a way to help cope, allowing him to name him—Snuffles, of all things—and take care of him as a way to take care of himself)
Honestly, it was one of the most humiliating things that Harry had ever endured. Krum had gone out with him, without realizing it was a date.
And yet, Draco was so impossibly grateful that Harry could help Pansy when the rest of them couldn’t. It was just yet another reason that he knew that being with Harry was one of the best decisions he’d ever made. He wasn’t only good for Draco, he had helped all of them.
“Alright.” Draco released Harry’s hands and stood from the table even as Harry released a relieved breath. “I’ll meet you at your common room half an hour after classes end.”
By some miracle, Draco forced his limbs to move and ran after Ron, who had already taken off, only able to see because of the redhead’s flashlight. The only coherent thought in his head was
Harry smirked, and he knew that talking back to the teacher was a bad idea, but- “If I have only half a brain, Professor, surely you, as the professor, would be much better suited to helping Neville? Or any other student who has already finished with the project?” Harry gestured to his own beakers in front of him, and the worksheet that he had already finished. He knew that he had improved in chemistry since he actually started studying with Hermione, and he knew that it bothered Snape to no end.
Harry hesitated. Draco could see it in the way his shoulders stiffened slightly, the way he clenched Draco’s hand just a little bit tighter.
But Harry wasn’t sure if having sex with Draco would ruin everything. The same way it had with Ginny. Obviously, he wanted to, he wanted to take that step with his boyfriend; but wanting something and being ready for something were two very, very different things. He just hoped that he could explain his thoughts with the right words if tonight came to that.
And when Harry hooked his thumbs in the elastic band of Draco’s briefs, the inferno that was Draco’s desire blazed ever higher and burned in the most pleasurable way down his skin, in the pit of his stomach, melting his nerves.
However, when he heard the heavy sigh through Harry’s nose, Draco knew he wouldn’t be getting the answers he wanted right then.
Hermione had been waiting for Harry in the common room since the moment the game ended. So the moment the door opened, her head snapped up. With no one else in the room, Harry’s gaze immediately went to her. His hand dropped from the door once he closed it, and his entire body seemed to slouch. Immediately, she rushed to him and enveloped him in her arms, her head perfectly under his chin.
” Ron hesitated. He dragged a hand through his hair and down his face. “I know. I don’t even know what I was thinking. I was just—I was trying to protect Hermione from getting hurt again.”
Seeing this through heavy-lidded eyes, Harry mumbled, “Was too hot, you were taking too long.” Reaching out, he grabbed one of Draco’s hands and drew him closer, his sleepy smile more than enough to draw Draco in. But, before Draco could even touch the sheets, Harry’s hand had moved to the hem of Draco’s shirt, fiddling with it. The smaller boy recognized it for the request it was.
He knew the moment that Draco realized who would be paying for everything he’d placed in Harry’s arms. His grin turned into an annoyed scowl, but luckily the light in his eyes didn’t diminish.
“Goodnight, Harry.” Draco waited until Harry turned a corner and he couldn’t see him anymore to go into the common room.
The sound of the door banging open didn’t reach Draco’s ears—he was too busy being utterly consumed by Harry. His mouth, his hands, his body, his tongue, teeth, warmth, and breath. Heat poured down every inch of Draco’s body. He couldn’t decide where to put his hands, moving from Harry’s shoulders to his waist, his ass, his hair.
Guys, I wrote this while I'd only had five hours of sleep and running solely on hot chocolate and crackers, and while I should've been sleeping. Which makes no sense, because I was experiencing some serious writer's block. I really should've picked another time to do it, but I guess there's no time like the present! So, if it's terrible, I sincerely apologize.
Harry had left Draco standing there in the hall after telling him that he would be back in a few minutes. The moment that he and Hermione had walked into the common room, she had practically tackled him in a hug. Of course, Harry, being as well-built as he was, wasn’t even moved by her much smaller force. But he could practically feel the energy buzzing off of her. He wrapped his arms around her.
With a small smile, Draco stretched up to kiss him, bringing Harry’s head down to meet him in the middle. Though it was short and sweet, any amount of Harry always brought a smile to Draco’s lips—the same smile he wore as he disentangled himself and walked back into his common room, wishing he could bring Harry with him.
Hermione nodded. “That was his name, Harry. Draco Malfoy’s the one who called me a-” Harry put his hand up to stop her there. He didn’t want to make her taste that word on her tongue.
When Draco had finished, Harry had wrapped him in a soft, fluffy black towel and peppered kisses on his face, down his neck, and across his collarbones. After he’d dressed—in one of Harry’s smaller grey t-shirts he’d tucked into a pair of black skinny jeans—he’d asked Harry to braid his hair; he’d assiduously done two dutch braids, and Harry was proud to say that Draco looked absolutely captivating, even with the short hairs that refused to stay in the braids. His skin had lost the sallowness, the sharp lines of his face looked healthier, and his beloved hair was as shiny and silky as ever. The only thing that remained was the dark bags under his eyes. But Harry would be making sure that Draco slept that night.
Those days had also been full of Draco; dragging him into abandoned classrooms for heated kisses, raking his hands through his blond hair and trying to draw out those noises he
The other boy just smiled wider and swung his arm around Draco’s shoulders, and started walking down the corridor. Draco realized how late it must’ve been.
Draco quietly instructed, “Deep, even breaths, Harry. Slow down. Let’s get you to sleep, baby. You need it.”
Embarrassment crept up Harry’s neck. His skin flushed, and though the color of his skin was just dark enough to hide it, he still felt the blood rushing to his face and neck. But Draco seemed to sense this and tightened his fingers on Harry’s jaw, preventing him from pulling away. His grey eyes flashed, warning the other boy not to fight him on this.
And just then, the sleeping boy curled more into Harry’s side, grabbing onto his arm and pressing his side into Harry’s. His ribs were pressed into the armrest, so Harry slowly used his right arm to lift it back up so that the blonde could be more comfortable. His fingers curled around Harry’s arm were cold, seemingly sucking out Harry’s heat, but he didn’t mind. The blonde cuddled so tightly to Harry that there was almost no space between their bodies, and Harry looked over at the shriveled hag a seat over. Her eyes were so squinted with disgust, Harry found it nearly hilarious, (if he had known this blond boy, if they had been boyfriends, Harry would have kissed him senseless just to see how far her face could squint into itself) Harry sent a smirk over the boy’s head. He settled in to watch a movie on his cell and smell the blond’s hair, moving as little as possible.
Even though Harry wasn’t the same thirteen-year-old boy that he’d been when he first met Sirius, the feeling of complete safety in his arms had never faded. Though he wasn’t as naive and helpless as he had been, Sirius always embodied what Harry thought of as
But he didn’t know all that much about Harry’s past. It was like one big blank. There were a few little things he’d pieced together himself, but it wasn’t the same as being shown the whole picture.
Harry huffed a laugh and slid his hands up and down Draco’s spine. “I like that one, too.” Lifting his head, Harry smirked at his boyfriend, adoring and crooked at the same time. He quite enjoyed the way Draco looked back at him—all smitten and rosy and beautiful. “
Then he noticed the pain in his chest slowly fading, his heartbeat calming, his muscles going limp. Harry let himself lean completely back into Draco’s chest. The boy behind him nuzzled his face into Harry’s neck, supporting his weight. Harry tried to mimic the deep breaths he felt from Draco’s chest.
Harry tried his best not to let his nervous curiosity show. “What is it, love?” The air around them became charged with a shaky tension, fueled by Draco’s prolonged pause.
“That’s good.” Harry moved to stand again, brushing off his pants. “Look, I have to go. But thank you—for apologizing.” He took a step away but stopped. “When she’s ready, you need to talk to Hermione, too. She deserves an explanation and an apology.”
He’d felt so disconnected from his body that when he felt his arms move, he hadn’t registered that someone was making him stand until they’d managed to get his feet on the ground. Feelings had slowly trickled in until the awareness of his body finally clicked and he was able to manage most of his own weight.
Even as he now sat in the Great Hall beside Harry, holding his hand under the table, Draco couldn’t get the small, soft smile off of his face. Yes, the day previous had been…
And yet, there was a part of Harry’s mind that retained the fact that he could get caught if he snuck out, he could get detention—or possibly suspended—if he was caught by the wrong professor. However, he knew the school like the back of his hand, had a schedule of the teachers’ night patrols and a map of the school from the Weasley twins, and it wouldn’t be the first time he’d snuck out of bed after curfew. He hadn’t been caught then, it wasn’t likely he’d be caught this time.
What he’d learned, the insights he’d gained, the twisting pain and grief he’d felt for Harry—it all made his heart drop to his stomach. It made him feel sick just thinking about it, it made the pressure build behind his eyes until they glistened with held-back tears.
“Not even a little bit.” Harry was practically vibrating with his excitement. Draco knew how much this meant to him, how crushed he’d been after Beauxbatons had beaten their team. This was a second chance. This was the team’s second chance. This was
Hermione made a small squeaking, gasping, surprised noise that seemed to come out without her own consent. Her hands squeezed Harry’s arm so tightly he was sure she would cut off his circulation, but Harry didn’t think he would notice even if she did. He could feel her arms trembling, he could feel her breathing stutter from how closely she was pressed against him. She started tugging on his arm, trying to pull him back out into the hallway they had come from. He let her pull him along.
Harry came out of the shower stall, ruffling his hair with a towel, a fresh pair of sweatpants riding low on his hips; Draco’s eyes widened at the sight of his Adonis belt. His deliciously brown skin was still damp from the steam. Draco was fighting for concentration while staring at him, wondering how it was possible that
Harry could feel the stunned energy in the air. The tension that arose in Draco’s arms around him was more than enough to say how shocked he was. Hermione’s hand had stilled on his knee. Sirius had gone quiet over the phone.
warm. Draco knew he could never tire of this—falling asleep next to Harry, being held by him, loved by him.
Cedric Diggory was beaming at him, a smile that seemed too bright. (That smile used to have him coming apart at the seams, always extracting a matching grin from him. His smooth voice used to have Harry falling on his knees. Those grey eyes had once looked at him with such love and adoration, his tanned fingers had traced the lines in Harry’s skin, known every inch of his body. Harry used to adore his dark, bronze-colored hair, his chiseled face, and his gentle laugh. There were a great many things Harry used to love about Cedric Diggory. But looking at him now, everything was so much different. Looking at him now, there was nothing Harry needed from him, nothing Harry
He heard Harry’s sharp intake of breath, his gaze focused on Draco’s ribs. Draco looked down, only to see a large purple and blue bruise covering the expanse of his right ribs. Memories of falling down the stairs flashed through his mind—he couldn’t really recall everything that had happened, but he knew it was a possibility that he’d slammed his side on one of the stairs at some point.
Even though it was through a screen, Draco looked deep into Harry’s green eyes, and let that feeling of safety blanket him. Each of his muscles relaxed and he let the tension in his face go.
Harry’s entire body froze, his fingers almost jerking off the knob. No, he couldn’t face his boyfriend. He wouldn’t be able to stand the disappointment that would no doubt be written on Draco’s face. He would crumble, collapse, fall apart. He.. he just couldn’t.
“Harry!” he exclaimed. He couldn’t tell whether he was excited or annoyed at being dragged into the rain by his boyfriend, but before he could decide, he was in the courtyard.
And with that, he was gone as quickly as he had come. Draco released Harry’s hand under the table. Theo cleared his throat, Blaise shoved his friend’s shoulder.
The tension in the air was so thick he could have cut through it with his hand. Draco’s fingers tightened on Harry’s, attempting to nonverbally beg him to back down, just this once. Luckily, his boyfriend seemed to get the message.
Draco’s eyes only softened while his smile spread. His fingers trailed down Harry’s stomach until his fingers hooked in the belt loops of his jeans, jerking Harry closer with his hold. “I love you,” he whispered, almost conspiratorially.
Fingertips lightly skimmed over the bruised skin, bringing Draco back to the present. He could see the concern in his boyfriend’s green eyes, the unease, and sadness. Draco almost thought it was amusing, how Harry was more worried about it than he was. But instead of lingering on it, Draco watched Harry’s fingers drift down to the ties that kept the sweatpants on Draco’s hips.
“Something’s wrong with him, and Hermione sent me to come get Draco,” Ron replied, looking more urgent and panicked by the second.
Draco had never felt so warm than he did when Harry clutched him to his chest and wrapped his arms around the smaller blond. Draco wound his arms around the other boy’s body, trying to take in all the heat from his body. He could feel Harry’s heart beating in his chest, he could hear it, he felt his chest moving with heavy and almost laborious breaths.
The taller boy looked confused. His brows drew together. “What are you on about, ‘Mione?” He raised his hand to press against her forehead like he was checking for a temperature. She swatted his hand away.
“Theo,” Harry laughed, “my eyes are up here.” Faster than light, Theo’s gaze snapped back up to his face, his face becoming more flushed than it had been before. He quickly busied himself with getting another weight for the bar. “I’m kidding, mate,” Harry chuckled, finishing the weights on his side.
Harry stopped her with a hand on her wrist, gently pulling her back to sit down. He wasn’t looking at either of them. He
Draco snuggled in closer to Harry, laying his head on his shoulder and against his neck. He could already feel the contentment spreading in his chest, the warmth seeping through his skin, sleep pressing heavy on his eyelids.
“I suppose I should just start at the beginning,” Harry said quietly, trying to prevent anyone from overhearing. “You know Ron, yeah?”
“Yeah, yeah, I’m coming,” Harry murmured, standing and walking behind the twins out to the field. When Coach Hooch saw him, she gave him a knowing smile and a pat on the back.
The goalie’s fingertips just barely brushed it, but she wasn’t close enough or fast enough to stop it.
“Does that… disappoint you?” Harry asked, feeling as though his heart had dropped to his stomach. He tried hard to swallow past the burning feeling in his throat. “Do
“It’s too early to be awake on a Saturday,” Draco whispered, tracing the shape of Harry’s mouth while his other hand was still massaging his head. “So why are you up?”
Also, just as a little friendly reminder that you've probably already heard far too many times, make sure to practice social distancing and wash your hands!! Remaining optimistic is hard, but we can make it through this together!
“Go, go talk to Malfoy. I’ll find Ron.” Hermione gently shoved him towards the door, wiping her face with her other hand. Harry nodded, watching her walk away for a moment before going back outside to the corridor, where Draco was waiting.
Walking to the front doors of Hogwarts Academy was quite possibly one of the most anxiety-inducing things that Harry Potter had ever done. Only, it wasn’t the journey there that terrified him, but rather what awaited him on the other side of those ornately-carved doors. Certainly, nothing could go quite as horrible as the scenarios Harry had playing on repeat in his mind—hostility, abduction, murder, spontaneous combustion, the likes—but there was always a chance.
But fear… It was a powerful thing. It coursed through Draco’s entire body, holding his legs as if they were stuck in wet cement. He felt himself drowning in it. Fear for Harry, fear for what might have happened. Fear of seeing what lay behind that door.
And then, as though a bubble had been burst, the sounds around them started pouring into Draco’s ears: cheering, shouting, whistling, one of the Weasley twins jokingly telling them both to get up and get a room. The kiss was broken by Harry laughing into Draco’s mouth, but the shorter boy couldn’t care less as he laughed with him. He felt high off of Harry’s victory, even though he hadn’t been playing himself.
“No, I mean,” she paused, swallowing hard, “Ron came to talk to me, just a few minutes ago. I could barely look at him, Harry. I just kept picturing him with Lavender, and thinking about him ignoring us and… And I… Am I a horrible person for not wanting everything to just go back to how it was before?”
With silver-lined eyes, Draco’s watery, beaming grin was the impeccable twin to Harry’s. His pale face had flushed red, turning the tips of his ears pink in the most adorable way possible. Blossoms of fondness flowered all throughout Harry’s body, adoration replaced the blood flowing through his veins; devotion, respect, fondness, and affection filled his bones.
“Harry, my father is probably one of the most racist people that I know. I had constantly heard words like those from him, and I grew up with them being tossed about like they were nothing. When I said those words to Granger, I had no idea what they really meant,” Draco paused to take a breath as Harry pulled a fresh shirt over his head, and turned back to look at Draco with his arms crossed over his chest.
With that, he made his way to the adjacent locker room. Draco followed, not giving up just yet. He watched as Harry opened his locker and dropped his bag on the bench before stepping into one of the shower stalls. Almost immediately, steam started pouring out of the stall from the rushing water, carrying the scent of vanilla and grapefruit.
and leaned into Harry’s hands. His eyes fluttered closed as if of their own volition. He could feel his chest vibrating with something akin to a purr—but he’d never admit to that.
Harry carried him through the common room, receiving many glances, some calculating, some amused, others slightly concerned. Harry walked past them all, giving Hermione a nod as he passed. He could practically feel the smirk she tossed Draco behind him. Harry walked out the door.
Regardless of that, though, the game had consistently stayed head-to-head, neither team with an advantage over the other and a tied score. There were only two minutes left in the game, and Draco could practically feel the frustration from both teams, the desperation to make
Sooo. This chapter is a week late. And I am deeply, incredibly sorry for that. It's also probably complete trash but like, oh well.
“He hasn’t drawn like that in months,” Pansy suddenly said from his other side, quietly so that Draco wouldn’t be distracted.
“Come on, am I going to have to carry you?” Harry asked sarcastically, poking his boyfriend in the ribs.
“Whenever I did something Vernon didn’t like, he would lock me in the cupboard under the stairs for a few hours. That was basically where I lived. He’d shout at me and hit me. But when he was really angry…” Harry paused, looking down at Draco’s fingers tangled with his own. He took a deep breath. “When he was really angry he’d make me take off my shirt, and he’d hit me with his belt.”
Harry didn’t have nearly as much luggage as Draco had had when he’d gone home. Not that he was allowed to carry what little there was.
“What do you th-think about… I... I mean, h-have you…” Draco stammered. Both his mouth and throat suddenly felt like sandpaper.
Narcissa had remained silent and stone-faced in the face of Lucius’s explosive anger—screaming words that Draco would rather forget. The man had stormed out of the dining room muttering under his breath. The moment he was out of earshot, Narcissa had jumped from her seat and yanked Draco into a tight hug. He had clung to her while she whispered soothing words in his ear. Afterward, she had huddled in his room with him, asking him questions and trying to relieve him of the weight that pressed on his shoulders)
When he’d finished, Harry gently gripped Draco’s fingers and led him out of the locker room. They walked in comfortable silence all the way to the southern common room. Draco was loath to leave the warmth that Harry embodied, but he knew that he had to if Harry were to get to his own common room in time.
Draco waited for Harry on a bench against the lockers. Steam from his shower had started to fill the locker room. Draco couldn’t even think about how his boyfriend was showering literally
In the end, logic won out. “Come on,” Harry said gently, sitting back up with Draco reluctantly following, “we need to get you packed.”
Shock slapped Harry in the face. He hesitated before carefully bringing his arms around her back. He had to hunch over so she could reach his neck comfortably, but he didn’t mind. Her warmth was a kind that he seldom felt—the kind that could only be found in a mother. The closest thing he’d ever had to one was Tonks, and even then it was a stretch. Narcissa simply emanated motherly warmth, and Harry was tentative in accepting it.
The sound of Harry’s pounding heart drowned out everything else. The only thing he could think about was Draco’s face—afraid, vacant—as he’d gotten in the car to drive away, and how he’d known that something was bound to go wrong.
Alright guys, I hope you liked it! I seriously get so excited when I get comments, it's ridiculous, but I love getting feedback and hearing what you think. So, comment, kudos, advice, I love it all! Thanks a ton for reading!
This time, Draco had chosen where they were going—a small coffee shop that he, Pansy, Blaise, and Theo liked that wasn’t very far from Joan’s shop.
“Okay,” Hermione said, standing up. “I’m going to go clean my face. Harry, I heard a rumor that Fred and George may or may not have snuck in a few bottles of Baileys in celebration of their magnificent captain.” She looked at him with a smile that was almost a smirk. “Go have fun, I’ll be down in a few.”
The memories of his boyfriend from that morning swirled in his mind, a ruthless whirlpool of tears, shampoo, and Draco’s porcelain skin. Harry had had to keep a tight leash on his thoughts throughout the entire bathroom ordeal; he’d had to keep a balance between distracting Draco and helping him feel better.
Pansy smiled up at Harry, and he knew right then that none of his friends would be leaving him any time soon. They would stick by him, as long as he did the same. That thought brought more comfort at that moment than any of his calming techniques. The only thing that could have made it better would have been Draco, sitting there with them, laughing and smiling with them.
Pansy stepped in front of him, a sympathetic gleam in her dark eyes. “Just go and talk to him, yeah? Figure all your stuff out.”
his hair, but from the beginning of their relationship, Harry had seemed to be an exception to the rule. Harry’s fingers were gentle and yet effective all at once.
“I’m serious Harry!” he yelled from the hallway, “I wanna get to bed, and I am not afraid to be a snitch to get there!”
She kissed his hair as she whispered, “I’m so proud of you, Harry. And I’m absolutely, one hundred percent positive that your mum and dad would be just as proud of you, more proud of you than I ever could be, love.” She felt his shoulders shake with choked back tears, his arms tightening around her.
Draco was walking on air. Sure, Blaise and Pansy had been teasing him all day for it, but all he could think about through his morning classes was that
“No, no, I wanna talk.” Harry swallowed hard. He could feel his Adam’s apple bob with the force of it. Though he was afraid of the disappointment he might face, Harry knew he needed to talk now. He didn’t think he could garner the courage to do it again later.  “I… I haven’t been able to sleep. The nightmares have been worse. It’s stupid, really—”
The second was the fact that he finally got to take his favorite suit of his closet and wear it. It was perfectly tailored to every inch of him, and Draco was completely okay with admitting to himself that he looked
“I love you, too,” Harry mumbled against his lips. Gentle fingers ran through Draco’s meticulously combed hair, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. Moving his fingers to curl in the fabric of Harry’s uniform sweater, Draco pouted as Harry pulled away. “But you’re sure—”
Harry grinned as she gave a long-suffering sigh. “You’re lucky I love you, Harry Potter.” Draco felt a twinge in his chest, he knew it was stupid, she didn’t mean it like
Harry opened the door to the common room as quietly as possible. When he looked inside, a weight was lifted off his shoulders. Draco was sitting on the couch next to Hermione, Pansy on her other side, while Blaise and Theo sat by her feet. From what he could hear, Hermione was giving an animated retelling of how she had met Harry.
The man who had insulted Harry’s people, his friends, his family—perhaps not directly, but any time those words were uttered, it pained them all.
Harry snickered and reached across the console to hold Draco’s hand. Draco’s heart stuttered. He could feel the heat rushing to his face, he ducked his head in an attempt to hide both the blush and the smile that crept across his face.
By the time she’d finished, Pansy was pink-faced and had planted her hands on her hips, a stance that Draco knew all too well. It usually meant that whatever she was ranting about, she was right.
He heard Hermione sigh through her nose. “Look, Ron. We appreciate you apologizing, but we can’t forgive you right now. You’ve apologized before. You’ve said all of this before. I don’t know that either of us can get our hopes up and take you seriously right now. Maybe not for a while. But,” Hermione paused, the barest amount of kindness slipping into her next words, “it would be great if we could actually talk with each other like friends.”
“Pretty well.” There was a heavy breath and a pause. “At least at the end. Most of it was pretty hard—there was a
“This is our second chance. We’re going to win.” When he looked back down at Theo, Harry saw the boy crossing his arms over his chest, looking down at his knees. The captain slightly shook his shoulder until Theo looked up at him. “And you’re going to help us.”
Watching Harry run and play was just as satisfying and attractive as it had always been—possibly more so now that the stakes were so high. The way his body moved was both fluid and controlled at the same time, well-practiced and personalized to play on Harry’s strengths. Draco could see his muscles moving under his skin all the way from the stands, could see the sweat dripping down his face and soaking through his clothes.
“What, um, what did Hermione say?” Draco asked as they started walking. He definitely wasn’t trying to steer the conversation away from blush-inducing topics.
He looked down at Hermione only to see her looking up at him as well, her cheek a little squished against his arm. The sight made him smile with fond memories of when they were younger, and smaller, with fewer inhibitions.
Standing in front of him was Ronald Weasley, red hair and all. When Draco closed the door behind him, he noticed that the youngest Weasley boy was without a certain rotten girlfriend. He also noticed that Ron was making his way to enter the room he had just exited.
Harry caught sight of Draco right before they left the doorway, the same second that those grey eyes caught him. Harry couldn’t even smile at him, or wave at him, his mind was too occupied with the scene he had just witnessed as he walked away. He somehow pressed Hermione closer to his body, ushering her back to their common room, which he was positive would be empty.
She sent him a parting smirk before departing for the girls’ locker room, leaving Harry to laugh to himself. He took out his phone from his shorts, looking at his screensaver—a picture Hermione took of Draco and himself, Harry kissing Draco’s cheek as the blond boy laughed—for a moment before sending a message to his ‘new boyfriend’.
Even he heard the slowness of his words, felt the drain of concentration it took to even get the simplest two words out. Harry laughed harder, kissing his forehead and bringing Draco’s body closer to his own.
Lucius had cut him off, speaking to Iris. “Draco will be attending London Business School after he graduates. I’ve tried to secure him a spot in both Cambridge and Oxford, but he hasn’t taken the right classes in Hogwarts, and his grades simply aren’t high enough. They wouldn’t have him.”
Harry felt Hermione’s thin fingers tangle with his own. Her soft, warm skin contrasted so severely to Draco’s icy fingers which slipped under Harry’s shirt to splay over his stomach, comforting and calming.
“How unfortunate, Professor. But whether or not you believe me, that is the explanation I’m giving.”
Draco stopped in his tracks, staring at Harry’s receding back. The other students pushed past him, some of them bumping his shoulders in an attempt to get him to walk again, but Draco seemed rooted to the ground. His fingers had gone slightly cold, as if missing the warmth they might have gained if Harry had stopped to touch his hand.
With a heavy sigh, Harry turned to face Draco, now straddling the bench. Draco copied the movement. Some deep sort of compassion washed through him when Harry moved closer and hunched over until his forehead lay on Draco’s shoulder, his hands settling on his thighs.
“I just…” Ron started, his eyes flitting nervously between Draco and Harry, “I went to get water for Harry. I figured he’d need it.”
“I promised I would, sweetheart.” The smaller boy wound his arms around the other and placed another kiss on his nose. Those green eyes were gazing intently at him, a light in them that hadn’t been there when Draco had left. He lifted his hand and traced the contours of his face. “Where’d Hermione go?”
Harry had anticipated the speech to come before Theo even started it. He’d spent all night trying to mentally prepare himself for it, because he knew what, or who,  it would remind him of.
“Oh, shut up and walk me back to my common room, you ass.” Draco chose to ignore the boisterous laughter that burst from Harry’s mouth, (the same mouth that had kissed him, the same mouth that had been on his, on his skin, his neck) and instead got off the bed and turned his back to Harry, searching for his shirt.
When he spoke, Harry’s voice was thick and low. “I’ll be back in a minute.” He released both Hermione and Draco’s hands and moved to stand. Every muscle in his body was stiffened, his fists were clenched. He looked ready for a fight.
“I think curfew is in about half an hour, love,” Draco said. His soft words seemed too loud for the peaceful quiet that had settled over them, but he didn’t want to risk either of them getting detention. They’d been lucky so far, but the thought of that night Harry had gotten caught by Snape made taking the chance hard.
“I need your help getting him to his dorm.” Hermione shifted her body as she spoke, pulling away from Harry’s back, flinching at how his breathing quickened. “It’ll be quieter there, and maybe lighter if we can get enough lanterns.” Both she and Draco moved to either side of Harry, taking his arms and settling them over their shoulders. With some struggle, they managed to help Harry stand. To Draco’s surprise, it felt as though his boyfriend was managing to hold most of his own weight.
Draco’s heart stopped. Everything stopped. Frozen. Fear—pure, overpowering fear, froze every muscle in Draco’s body. Every bone, every tendon, every ligament was stilled.
make me uncomfortable, baby.” Seeing the doubt written on his boyfriend’s face, Draco resumed with a slight eye roll. “Sure, I don’t particularly
“I really shouldn’t have even told you anything, Draco,” she whispered, “It’s for him to tell you, it’s his business.”
So, Draco just kissed the back of Harry’s hand and walked him the rest of the way to the rest of the team, and then left to wait for him outside of the locker rooms.
The screams of the crowds echoed in Harry’s ears. His heart pounded in his chest. His body ached in the most pleasant way possible, flooded with adrenaline. Sweat coated his body, a sheen on his forehead. His eyes roved over the football field, tracking each and every player in sight, sensing those he couldn’t see. His legs were aching to race after the ball that was in Ilvermorny’s possession, rolling up and down the field between their players, but he knew he had to wait for the perfect opportunity. There were only ninety seconds left on the clock for the last half of the game, and he had to make them count.
He didn’t exactly believe his boyfriend, but the guilty weight on his chest lifted, if only a little bit. Then he remembered the other thing he called to say.
Draco looked up, and immediately looked like he was at a loss for words, his face was flushing red. “Well, I… uh…” His hand clenched around Harry’s like a silent plea for help.
“Alright, alright,” Harry conceded, “we met on the plane here. He sort of fell asleep on my shoulder on the way. His name’s Draco. Draco Malfoy.” Harry smiled.
“Yup,” Pansy said, popping the ‘p’ with her purple lips. She’d been rehashing the news she’d told Draco, Theo, and Blaise the day before to Harry and Hermione. “It seems that you and I have something in common other than our unparalleled attractiveness, Potter.”
“It was a compliment of the highest order, my love. I have no idea how it could be anything else. Everyone knows that the gentlemen are the sexy ones.”
“I know it doesn’t count for much,” Harry told her, a sympathetic frown on his lips, “at least not right now. But I’m so,
He threw the blankets off of him and ran like hell to the bathroom, nearly tripping over Blaise and Theo’s sleeping bodies on the floor. He threw open the door, reaching the toilet just in time to disgorge the contents of his stomach. He clutched the sides of the toilet, his head pounding and his throat burning. Cold sweat coated his forehead, a droplet running down his temple.
“You don’t think you can trust him to uphold it after what he did the last time,” Remus finished, taking a long drink of his coffee. Harry nodded and did the same, smiling to himself when he realized that Draco had already taken most of it.
A comfortable silence fell between them. Draco moved his head so his ear was against Harry’s chest like he was listening to his heartbeat. Harry drew lines between the sparse freckles on his boyfriend’s shoulders and back, his other hand still in his blond hair. Harry knew that they should be getting to Draco’s dormitory so he could pack, but… he didn’t want to let him go. He’d planned on spending every spare moment with Draco before he left, but now those moments were cut short.
“We should do something today,” Pansy complained, having given up on the intricate style of braid she had been attempting. Harry opened an eye to peer at her bored expression, the corners of his mouth lifted in amusement. He just settled deeper into Draco’s body, surprised that the other boy wasn’t crushed by his weight. Draco only shifted his hips to better fit him, cradling him with his body. (It was soothing, being wrapped up in Draco’s body. He was a cooling presence, easing the heat that constantly overwhelmed Harry. Although Draco was the smaller of the two, there were times he insisted on holding Harry, demanded to be the one supporting
But even his mother’s happiness couldn’t change that the noise in the manor drove Draco insane. He could hardly handle the noise in the Great Hall of Hogwarts—this was completely overwhelming. He’d spent the first hour standing in the entrance hall, welcoming guests with his parents under the smothering gaze of his father. Then they’d moved on to the dining room for dinner, where the sounds only amplified off the walls. Draco’s knuckles still hurt from clenching his hands so tightly.
“Professor,” came Harry’s voice, it sounded as if it were just a few feet from the door, “I was just out for a walk. I couldn’t sleep.” His voice seemed too calm for the situation.
However, Draco could see the sincerity in the way he looked at Harry, whose eyes were fixed on Ronald as well. But glazed over and tired as they were, Draco didn’t think that his boyfriend really cared at this point. Draco could feel the exhaustion inside of him, begging him to sleep.
“Hey.” Pansy poked his shoulder from beside him. “Did something happen after I left? Theo looked about ready to wring someone’s neck when you guys walked in.”
The first was the food. He couldn’t be bothered to remember what restaurant it was that catered, but whoever it was, Draco could have eaten their food for
me?” Pausing his perusal of Harry’s hair, Draco cupped Harry’s face and drew him up to look at him. He traced the shape of Harry’s lips with his thumb, the other caressing his cheekbone.
. Draco couldn’t stand the thought of anyone else, Cedric Diggory included, touching Harry. Kissing him. Loving him. He didn’t want anyone else curled up in bed with him, or laying their head on his broad shoulders. Draco didn’t want anyone else, either. He didn’t want anyone but Harry running their hands through his hair, or holding his hand, or watching him draw. He didn’t want anyone else.
Hermione laid her head on his arm as they walked to the Great Hall. “Harry, there’s no such thing as being stuck with you. You aren’t going to shove him into the dark, love. Maybe it’s a little fast, but not every relationship is the same. And from what Pansy’s told me, Draco really likes you too. He was practically fawning over you yesterday after dinner.”
In the past few weeks, Draco had become closer with Hermione, trading information about classes while also exchanging good-natured banter. He’d learned that she was overwhelmingly smart; if he had been less proud, he would have admitted that she outranked even him as the best student of their year. She always had an answer for everything, and in those rare cases she didn’t, Hermione researched and swam through the information until she found one that satisfied her.
Harry came out of the door that led to the northern common room with an unreadable expression on his face.
At an especially sharp nip, Draco whimpered and dug his fingers into the muscles of Harry’s back. His boyfriend only made a deep, nearly animalistic growling sound in the back of his throat and Draco felt him lick over the bite. He removed one of his hands from Harry’s back to wrap around the headrest, drawing himself closer and pressing Harry further into the seat. His entire body felt like he was on fire, he was burning, his heart was bursting.
Slowly but surely, Harry watched as Draco’s resolve strengthened—as if realizing he truly had a choice made him more resilient in his decision. “I’m okay.” Draco took a step closer, his hand released the fabric of Harry’s t-shirt, his long fingers splayed across his chest. “I’ll be okay, muffin, I promise.”
“You’re probably right,” Harry sighed. Slowly, reluctantly, he moved out of Draco’s grasp to pull on the rest of his clothes—a loose-fitting tank top and basketball shorts.
Draco pulled back so he was facing Harry, who smiled at him. Harry leaned forward slowly as if to give Draco time to pull away. Instead, he leaned forward to meet him in the middle.
Pansy’s purple lips were pursed in a thin line. The apprehension in her gaze caused Draco’s brows to rise as he stared at her, waiting for an answer. One that didn’t come until they were safely seated on a couch in the southern common room. Theo and Blaise were already there among the other students milling about, almost as if they’d been waiting for them.
Laughing, he turned back to his boyfriend with a similar look. “I’m still waiting on an answer, baby,” he muttered.
Without question, Draco did as he was told. He slid onto the bed behind Harry, wrapping himself around his boyfriend as Hermione had. He felt Harry’s rapid heartbeat through his back, felt his lungs struggling for breath, his warmth seeping into Draco’s skin. Draco held onto him as tightly as possible, nuzzling his face into the juncture of Harry’s neck and shoulder.
it’s on him.” Even though her eyes spoke of fury and confidence, Draco could see Pansy picking at the skin around her nails. He could see the hidden pain in her slouched shoulders, in the dark circles around her eyes that she’d tried to cover with makeup. “What did you do?” she asked, looking intently at Harry. There was an air of desperation about her, like she longed for connection. “To make yourself feel better?”
When he opened his eyes, Harry felt more settled inside. His stomach had stopped churning. His head felt clearer. While the nightmare was still prevalent in his mind, he felt less affected by it. He flicked his gaze up to Draco, who was looking at him with concern swirling in his eyes.
Hermione pressed her lips together but Draco could still see them trembling. She took a shaky breath, barely audible over the thundering music echoing off the walls.
This had been a recurring thing throughout his entire life. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon—Harry’s relatives that had raised him, with his cousin Dudley, for the first thirteen years of his life—had drilled into him how horrible James and Lily had been, how they were good-for-nothing wastes of space. Harry had always had to keep his doubts about this to himself. Any outward rebuttal of their judgments was not met kindly. His disbelief had been held in for so many years, it had become twisted and ferocious, a new concoction of rage and grief that drove him to tears at the thought of what his life might have been like if they’d lived to raise him themselves.
He knew that Harry could see the flush on his face, and Draco couldn’t stop thinking about that moment in the changing room when Harry had said he was interested.
Draco went crazy. He smelled everything he could get his hands on, sampled every lotion he set his eyes on, examined every hair product, inspected every skincare application. He still had some part of his logical mind working, so he tried to narrow down what he actually chose for Harry to buy.
Draco had heard that name before. Cedric had asked Harry about someone named Teddy when he’d come to talk to him at lunch a few days ago. Draco had meant to ask about it, but it had slipped his mind. Cedric had mentioned an Astrid as well, and the way Harry had talked about them made them sound like children.
A sudden weight crashed into Harry, forcefully enough to make him stumble back a step. Lean arms wrapped tightly around his middle, almost clinging. Looking down, Harry saw Pansy’s newly-dyed lavender purple head of hair, nuzzled into the center of his chest, her shoulders quaking. It seemed she’d finally let the dam around her pain start to crack. An ache filled him—he knew how she felt, to the greatest extent he could.
Draco opened his eyes to see those green eyes he adored looking at him already. There was a sparkle in them that he hadn’t seen before.
Her dark eyes were trained on Draco’s hands as she replied, “His father thinks it’s a waste of time. He got annoyed at how much time Draco was spending with his art. He called him out on it, told him that he wasn’t any good, that it wasn’t going to get him where he needed to go in life.” Pansy paused, looking up at Harry, who was staring at her in shock. “His father loves him, in his own way. Lucius just doesn’t understand him.” A smile spread across her purple-painted lips. “So, thank you. For understanding him. For bringing this part of him back, when he couldn’t do it himself.”
Draco raised his hand and ran it up and down Harry’s back. He could feel the ridges of Harry’s scars even through his shirt, a constant reminder of what he’d been put through.
Harry opened the door when Draco knocked with a remorseful look in his green eyes. The shame buried itself deeper in Draco’s gut just looking at him. But then he recalled how Harry hadn’t done anything to push Cedric away. He hadn’t told him that his advances weren’t welcome. He hadn’t done anything but talk and smile at him. The scene replayed itself over and over in his mind, and each time the focus turned to Cedric and his stupidly handsome face.
Remus laughed and patted his back, squeezing his shoulder. “You have no idea, Harry.” Smiling, Harry then pulled away and was immediately tugged into a strong embrace from Sirius.
Draco moaned louder than he ever had with Harry and felt him laugh against his neck, coming back up to caress Draco’s bottom lip with his tongue. Steaming red heat rose to stain Draco’s face, he was sure it was hot enough to burn, but he didn’t care. Looking at his boyfriend, Draco couldn’t help but think that Harry couldn’t get any more attractive than this—his lips bruised and swollen, raven hair mussed more than usual, his breathing heavy and off-kilter, his eyes darkened and focused intently on Draco’s. Harry was
“Nope. You’re going to have to carry me.” Draco opened one of his eyes, only to see what Harry was sure was a mischievous grin on the bigger boy’s face, a glint in his eyes. Harry stooped down and scooped up his boyfriend.
He started walking towards the door and said to the others, “We’ll be at my car in less than ten minutes, meet us there.” The chuckles receded as he walked out of the common room and into the corridor.
Draco thought. The heat had spread from his face to his ears and chest—it should have been impossible to feel that flushed. Swallowing thickly past the lump in his throat, he tried again. He had to force the words out, if quietly. “What do you think about h-having sex with me?”
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry I haven’t had time for you lately,” Harry whispered softly, his peppermint breath caressing Draco’s ear, his neck.
The change in Harry’s face was immediate. His jaw clenched so tightly it was a surprise to not hear his teeth cracking. He looked menacing—
Harry saw Draco’s eyes widen as they got to the car; Harry knew it was nice, he’d been nearly shocked to death when Sirius surprised him with it on his fifteenth birthday when he wasn’t even allowed to drive it yet. It was an older model, from 1978, but he and Sirius had been able to fix it up into near perfect condition. It was one of his fondest memories of his godfather, who had become more of a father to him in the past three years he’d lived with him.
Draco watched as Harry completely melted. Every ounce of tension in his body thawed. He practically fell back onto the stairs and gently pulled Hermione to his body. She curled into him, closing her eyes and burying her face in his chest. Over her head, Harry looked at Draco. He smiled softly and reached out one of his hands to the smaller boy, beckoning him to them. Draco felt his heart fluttering as he took his boyfriend’s hand.
The only response Draco could make was an acknowledging grunt in the back of his throat, Harry was kissing him again, and it was impossible to even
Alright guys, this week has been a rough one (and it's only Tuesday). And while I'm aware that I'm updating early, I just kind of felt the need to write and update today. And so, I present to you, chapter five.
to fill the gap between them, he needed to be touching him, and if not touching him, he needed to see him, memorize the lines of his face and the cut of his silhouette.)
Immediately, the sleep that had riddled his body dissipated. Faster than lightning, Draco shot up and snatched the phone from Harry’s hands, staring at it for a moment before answering.
“Oh please, you’ve hardly even touched your plate. You’ve been too busy texting Terry,” Draco quipped. Pansy’s mouth dropped open in protest, but her phone pinged. Her attention immediately shifted to her cell as she typed away. Theo laughed from Draco’s other side, Blaise sniggering from beside her.
“Was that supposed to make me feel better?” Draco pinched Harry’s bicep, smirking at his surprised yelp. “Because it doesn’t. And I can’t decide if I’m curious or disgusted.”
Harry just about skipped a step in his shock. Of course, he’d thought about it. He knew it was faster than most people’s relationships, but he also knew that he didn’t think he would ever be okay with anyone else touching Draco’s soft skin, or gazing at him with the adoration that Harry did. He wanted Draco to himself. He wanted to be the one that was on the receiving end of those soft kisses, wanted to be the one to make those stunning grey eyes glow with laughter.
Harry let his other hand fall to his side, returning to the handle of the wheeled luggage bag. The look in his green eyes spoke of devastation, but it was quickly masked with a facade of detached nonchalance.
After Draco nodded at Joan, Harry followed him through all the different aisles, asking questions and holding everything Draco put in his arms. It got to the point where Harry had to go and get a basket, but he didn’t mind. It made Draco happy, so Harry was happy. The beaming smile on his face as he looked through different paints, pastels, and charcoals was more than enough to make Harry feel lighter than ever.
“Thank you,” he replied, the relief audible even to Draco’s ears. “I’ll see you tomorrow, baby, alright?”
Ron looked down at the ground. His shoulders slumped. He backed away a few steps, moving to lean his back against the corridor wall.
“I think it has something to do with the fact that I’m a pacifist, unlike you crazy psychopaths,” Draco retorted.
“Yeah, I just need a shower, and then we can go do whatever you want,” Harry replied with a creeping smile. He leaned forward and unwrapped Draco’s hands, making sure there was no bruising on his pale knuckles. (Harry loved the color of Draco’s skin, white as porcelain and smooth like glass) After unwrapping his own hands, he intertwined his fingers with his boyfriend’s and started walking for the showers.
“Dray,” Harry reluctantly whispered in his boyfriend’s ear, gently shaking his shoulder, “Dray, baby, we’ve gotta get going, my love.”
Joan turned her vibrant smile on Harry, looking him up and down. Harry offered her his hand, and after a second’s hesitation, she shook it.
He found a tree to sit against and decided that this was where he would do his Maths homework, right where he could concentrate (on Maths, of course), which also happened to still have a decent view of the football field. Draco watched as the team ran their last lap, and Harry ran a hand through his damp hair, screwing it up, as he gave the team orders. Some were playing a mock game against each other, while others started running again. Harry himself joined the mock game, and Draco decided that he could probably watch Harry play football for hours on end. The way that he moved was graceful and almost beautiful, but every movement was also precise and not without purpose.
“I was just at my desk, drawing, when I heard my bedroom door open from behind me. My father came in and… and he got so
“You remember the horror stories from that old gang, the Death Eaters?” Draco nodded, already dreading where this was going. “The Halloween after I turned one, their leader, Tom Riddle, broke into the house we were living in, in Godric’s Hollow. The reports say that he killed my father first. They say that my mother had run upstairs to my nursery, apparently, she had a gun with her. So when Riddle got to my room, he shot mum and she shot him a second later. They say that she was trying to protect me. The rest of the gang had waited outside—and fled when the police got there. A neighbor had called because of the noise.”
With a heavy sigh through his nose, Harry turned his face into Draco’s neck, pressing gentle kisses there. “Of course not, Dray. You have every reason to have resentments against your father.” Harry tightened his hold on his boyfriend, pulling him closer to his chest. “Your feelings are
“The old man’s right.” Sirius smirked as Remus shoved him, just hard enough to nearly knock him over. “Tonks only lent Remus to me for the afternoon so she could go get her hair dyed and let the kids have a day at Andromeda’s. And Draco looks like he could use some sleep.”
one he wanted to deal with. Once the boy found someone to complain to, they were roped into taking care of him until he felt better. And while Draco loved his friend dearly, he had no intention of leaving this bed to take care of him.
When they both finally pulled away for breath, it was no surprise that neither had any more tears in their eyes. A moment of silence was spent simply gazing at each other, and Harry knew that he could do so for hours.
The smile on Draco’s face was worth any risk of getting caught. Harry pecked his lips before turning to Blaise, who was looking at him with a knowing smirk and raised eyebrows.
Instead, Draco stood from the bed and took a few steps in Ronald’s direction. “I won’t lie and say that I forgive or believe you,” Draco started. “At least not right now. But, in all fairness, I could’ve handled the situation better on my end as well.”
After a beat, Harry stood, bringing Draco with him. A crooked grin spread on the smaller boy’s face at the sight of his boyfriend’s smirk.
Harry’s mouth shifted from Draco’s, moving down his cheek to his neck. He felt biting, sucking kisses placed there and Draco tilted his head back, reveling in every sensation, not caring about how heavy and loud his breathing was. The skin of his neck had always been overly sensitive and Harry always seemed to take full advantage.
Harry parked the car in the school’s garage, and this time Draco opened his own door before Harry could get there. Harry had the bags in one hand, and grasped Draco’s in the other, their hands swinging slightly between them.
The most Harry could manage was a pointed glare in Lavender’s direction. Ron saw this and huffed out an exasperated breath. He snagged a jacket from the floor  beside his bed before grabbing Lavender’s hand and leading her out of the room, slamming the door behind him.
The bigger boy simply gave him a soft smile and wrapped his arms around the blond. Draco’s brain went haywire. He was touching Harry’s bare chest. He was being held against Harry’s brown, muscled, slightly damp, bare chest. His skin was even warmer without the barrier of clothes between them. The shorter boy could smell the soap on his ridiculously smooth skin. Harry’s body felt like silk-covered steel, soft to the touch but hard and strong underneath. Draco let his arms come around Harry—but felt him stiffen when he touched his back. Draco almost pulled away in fear that he may have crossed a boundary, but Harry quickly relaxed again and only pulled Draco closer to him, pressing a kiss under his ear that made the smaller boy lightly shudder.
After getting their luggage and successfully shoving it into the trunk of the taxi, Harry was finally allowed to admire Draco’s face once again.
Draco thought. But he couldn’t find the strength within himself to look away. He had a broad back, and hips that were narrow, but certainly not as small as Draco’s. His skin was a rich, almost-light brown with olive undertones, and the lighting of the room seemed to make him glow.
“I tried to follow him down the stairs—but I tripped over myself halfway down and fell the rest of the way.” Draco pulled back only far enough to face Harry. The dejection that was written across his face, the trembling line of his mouth, the tears trailing down his blotchy cheeks—it all made Harry’s heart splinter into a million pieces. Harry slowly leaned forward and gently leaned his forehead against Draco’s, trying to keep the images of Draco—crumpled at the bottom of the stairs, bruised and screaming and sobbing—at bay. It didn’t work. Before he could make any more effort to stop them, tears ran down his face. “I watched my father throw
Almost the entire back seat of Harry’s Camaro was filled with bags from Joan of Art, and the peaceful feeling blossoming in Draco’s chest was worth every penny he would be paying back. The warm spring air blew into the car through the open windows as Harry drove. One of his hands held Draco’s over the console—the same hand that Draco held to his lips, gingerly and leisurely kissing each of his fingers from knuckle to tip.
“No.” Harry gritted his teeth and shifted in his seat, closer to Draco. “Coach and I are holding try-outs.”
“You’re right,” Ron whispered. “I’m sorry. I wanted to apologize to you. To make things better. I didn’t want to fight with you.” He slid down the wall to sit on the floor, his forehead against his knees. Nearly against his will, Harry moved to sit beside him, his head against the wall, staring at the ceiling. Waiting. Hoping.
Harry’s eyes were wide at her implications. “I don’t—Pansy I don’t think it was me. I think he did it by himself.”
The smile on Harry’s face was bright and immediate. He dug his phone out from his pants pocket, talking as he scrolled through photos. “He’s my cousin. Well, sort of. It’s kind of like he’s my nephew, too. I don’t know. His dad, Remus, is Sirius’s best friend. They were both best friends of my mum and dad, too.” Harry stopped scrolling and handed his phone to Draco. The photo was one of Harry and a little boy, no more than two years old. The boy—Teddy—was sitting on Harry’s shoulders in a stairway, a beaming grin on his young face like he had been laughing. The thing that caught his eye, however, was Teddy’s teal blue hair.
He waited in that room for almost half an hour after Snape left to venture outside and return to his common room. He left everything behind, deciding to come back for it the next day. Draco didn’t see anyone on the way and got to his dorm without any trouble.
“You’re an asshole,” Draco growled. Moving around on his bed, Draco shifted so he was sitting upright against the wall, his blanket like a warm cocoon around him. The scowl on his face surely matched the bitter taste in his throat.
His mind wandered to that morning, where, true to his word, Harry had shown up to breakfast on time. However, his eyes had been shadowed like he hadn’t slept much the night before. He’d spent nearly the entire meal hunched over with his chin on Draco’s shoulder and his arms wrapped around the blond boy’s waist, hardly eating anything at all.
angry at myself—for not seeing it earlier, for being so incredibly stupid and naive, for being so dependent on Cedric and falling apart over him. I sought validation anywhere I could get it, made a lot of stupid mistakes for it.” Running a hand down his face, Harry slightly shook his head. Draco watched as his broad chest moved with a deep breath. “But, through all of that, though, and after, it was
“Alright, you’d better be getting back to school.” A sort of melancholy wistfulness passed over Sirius’ eyes—the same melancholy wistfulness that clenched around Harry’s heart every time he had to say goodbye. Tugging him into another hug, Sirius said, “I’ll see you soon, okay? I love you, Harry.”
Hermione followed behind him, her eyes scanning the hallway before landing on Draco. Her eyes narrowed while the rest of her face went blank. Draco could feel his stomach clenching, his heart was beating faster, his hands felt clammy, he couldn’t even-
“Yeah, my thoughts exactly. Anyway, Hermione was really hurt and upset, so I took her back to our common room and went to get her lunch from the kitchens. We ended up skipping the rest of our classes. She fell asleep about an hour ago, so I carried her to her dorm room.”
Draco flushed and looked down at his fumbling hands as he answered, “I didn’t want to wait that long to see you.” Harry pulled the shirt over his head, ruffling his already messy hair. He grabbed a gym bag from the locker before closing it and turning back to face Draco.
“Well,” Harry said, a smirk on his face as he entwined his fingers with Draco’s, “no more waiting. I am all yours for the entire weekend.”
Draco dragged his tongue over every inch of Harry’s mouth, inside and out, sucked on his tongue, nibbled at his bottom lip—all to extract that
Harry softly caressed Draco’s cheek before turning and walking out the door. All the way to his dormitory, he had a small smile on his face.
know as well as Hermione did. Sure, Harry had liked Ginny, had really liked her. And Ginny had liked him, at least he had thought so. And they had gone on a date, they just… hadn’t told Ron. They had both been afraid that Ron wouldn’t take it well.
Harry watched intently as Draco’s face hardened. He could hear a voice on the other end of the phone, but couldn’t make out the words that were being said. Clearly, Draco didn’t like them very much.
Draco immediately scooted closer to his boyfriend, and by consequence also almost squashed Hermione between them. Harry didn’t seem to register that Draco was there for a moment, and then his eyes went wide and his hands tightened on Hermione.
Draco swayed his hips to the beat of the music with Harry behind him, his broad hands on the smaller boy’s hips. A carefree grin spread across his face as Harry dragged his lips up from his neck to his ear. Giggles erupted from his mouth, because, goddammit, his breath
Draco shoved down the apprehension he felt before weaving his way through the murmuring crowd. With how little information Ronald had given him, his imagination had run wild. Images of blood and broken bones, perhaps a fight that had gone wrong, ran rampant through his mind.
The monster inside Draco—the one he’d worked too hard and too long to restrain—urged him to rip this apology apart, to spit hateful words at Ronald until he was on his knees, begging. It wanted him to tear this boy before him to shreds until there were tears in his eyes.
“Draco, we’re leaving. In the car, now,” Lucius ordered, walking back around the car to get to the driver’s side door. The moment his back was turned and he’d gotten in the car, Narcissa rolled her eyes and shook her head at her husband. She stepped forward until she was less than two feet away from the boys, looking at them both with a motherly gaze.
Heads whipped in their direction from all the other customers, giggling and smirking. Draco immediately covered his quickly-flushing face in his hands, groaning at himself. Trying to muffle the warm laughter bubbling up inside him, Harry leaned in and kissed his temple, lingering a moment while Sirius and Remus paid the bill.
“You,” he answered, breathless and decided. “I want you, Harry. I want all of you. I want you to make love to me, I want you inside me, God,
“Thursday,” Harry said, quickly removing his hands from the table, “at six o’clock, on the football field.”
Harry smiled and pressed his lips to Draco’s own. “She didn’t want to fall asleep here, she went back to her dorm.”
Harry snickered with him as he sat up and gently maneuvered Draco so they could both stand up. “I have to go talk to Hooch and shower, and I’ll meet you after, my love.” Feeling somewhat unreasonably disappointed and disgruntled, Draco leaned up to kiss Harry again, only for his boyfriend to press a finger to his lips and continue, “I heard a rumor that Fred and George may have planned another party, just in case we won tonight.”
“I love you, Dray.” Harry leaned in and kissed his forehead before slowly unraveling his arms from around the smaller boy. Draco followed suit, letting his hands trail over every inch of skin he could touch before his hands dropped to his sides.
A stroke of apprehension swiftly wrapped around Harry’s heart like a clawed hand, each finger a fear that relentlessly dug into him. He knew, logically, that Sirius and Remus would like his boyfriend, and that Draco, in turn, would get along with them just fine. But the ‘what ifs’ of the situation nonetheless threatened to overpower Harry.
“Harry, please, just shut up,” Draco laid his hand on Harry’s shoulder, collecting every ounce of his daring before asking, “Do you want to be my boyfriend?”
Harry snatched his keys from his nightstand. Whatever trace of grogginess that might have remained was long gone. His heart clenched as he heard his boyfriend’s stifled sobs through his phone. “I’m on my way, baby, okay? I’ll be there as soon as I can. I promise. Take some deep breaths for me, okay?”
Though he nodded in answer, Draco knew that there would be no stopping tonight. He bathed in the way that his boyfriend looked at him—like he was in awe, like he was in love, like there was nowhere else he would rather be. With his feet, Draco pulled down Harry’s briefs as far as he could, letting his boyfriend do the rest.
“Harry?” came Hermione’s voice, somewhere above him. “I have Sirius on the phone, I’m just going to put him on speaker, okay?”
(Even if he hadn’t been there for Harry’s first word, his first steps, or his first day of school, he’d been there for Harry the way no one else
Both Blaise and Theo left the bed after she did, and all three of them got ready for bed before Draco laid back down in his bed, looking forward to his Saturday afternoon with Harry with a smile on his face.
He leaned forward to kiss Harry, slanting his lips over his boyfriend’s in such a gentle manner it barely even qualified as a kiss. But even the slightest touch sent shivers shooting down his spine and goosebumps erupted on his skin. His lips were soft, and moved against Draco’s so tenderly—the moment couldn’t have felt more perfect.
“Um…” Harry saw some of Draco’s uneasiness start to melt away as he got talking, he was settling more comfortably in his chair, and the smile on his face practically shone. “Mostly just pencil and paper because they’re convenient, but I like using paint and other things when I can.”
Memories from the previous night swirled in Draco’s thoughts. He couldn’t stop thinking about what Harry had endured, what he’d been subjected to in place of a childhood. But through the hours of sleeplessness, Draco had come to realize that the scars on his back didn’t only exist as painful memories. They were reminders that he had come through. Harry had survived and he’d found a way to live again. He’d fought for years to be the person he’d become. The boy that he’d fallen completely in love with.
It felt like a moment in a cheesy chick-flick, dancing in the rain with Harry. Neither of them was very good, but that didn’t matter to Draco. They swayed in time to the sound of raindrops, the thunder a distant drumbeat. Their feet shuffled and there were a few times Draco almost slipped on the slick cobblestones, but he wouldn’t have rather been anywhere else. When Harry spun him, Draco laughed, and he felt freer than he had in months.
Both boys simply stared at the other, the silence between them wasn’t tense or comfortable, but somewhere between. There seemed to be shadows hiding behind Draco’s eyes, the light usually in them was hardly able to shine through.
“I’m sorry.” Harry opened his eyes and folded his arms across his chest. His voice was quiet, almost fragile. “I’m so sorry, that I made you feel like that. I know I should’ve asked him to leave, I should’ve pushed him away. I just—I was shocked, and I didn’t know what to do, and I didn’t want to hurt him. I’m sorry. I’m so, so sorry.”
When his shoulders began to ache, Harry knew he was finished. Swiping a hand over his sweat-ridden face, he turned to look at Draco; he was still hitting the bag, though with less enthusiasm than before.
“I hear you’ve been giving your dad some grey hairs, mister,” Harry teased, letting his fingers wander over Teddy’s sides to tickle him.
Voices sounded from the living room as soon as Snuffles’ barking died down. Beyond elated, Harry stood up and, with Snuffles practically attached to his hip, followed them down the hall. He glanced at all the pictures hanging on the walls as he went, pictures he’d seen a million times. He was in most of them, after all, in some form or other. Reminiscent memories caressed his mind, filling him to the brim with happiness. Harry felt as though he might combust.
“You scared the hell outta me,” Harry whispered in Draco’s ear, realizing that they were still in the library. Draco only buried himself further into Harry’s body as an apology instead. The shorter boy felt him pressing a kiss to his temple, his hair, there was a kiss on his cheek, and a hand playing with the hair at the nape of his neck.
So, when Draco opened Harry’s dorm room door, he was expecting to find his boyfriend alone and in need of comfort; the same kind of comfort that Draco was more than happy to provide for him.
He’d had to use so much of Pansy’s makeup to cover up the mark on his neck Harry had left. But Draco didn’t mind, he kind of liked the reminder that Harry had been there, that Harry had kissed him and
Draco was anticipating to hear a protest from Harry, an exclamation of how unfair this was- Draco knew that it was taking every ounce of his self-control to not do it himself- but instead all he heard was a “Yes, sir” and footsteps walking down the hall.
A throat being cleared in front of Harry made him snap his head up, only to see an annoyed Snape standing in front of his desk. He was looking down his hooked nose at the boy, a venomous glint in his black eyes.
Draco’s fingers were digging into Harry’s shoulders like he was afraid he would float away if he didn’t hold on tight enough. Harry’s mouth traveled down to Draco’s neck, where he seemed to switch gears and started leaving butterfly kisses across his shoulders and collar bones. The blond boy could hear his own heavy breathing, only consoled by the fact that Harry’s was just as uneven and labored. He quivered when Harry kissed under his ear, his tongue then tracing the shell.
However, the moment that Draco felt Harry’s fingers clench around his shoulder and saw his eyes once again shut tightly, all empathy for Ronald was instantly replaced with worry for his boyfriend.
Slowly, though, he managed to get his mind under control. Moving through the motions of all the drills was both soothing and exhilarating. Harry felt as though a piece of himself was falling back into place as he ran, directed, and observed on the field. His body simply knew what to do. The scent of freshly cut spring grass was a familiar embrace to his senses. Warm sunshine shimmered in vibrant hues as the sun continued its descent towards the horizon.
Shaking his head the other boy answered, “No. But- But I’m going to go and talk to him tomorrow. I’m going to tell him it was my fault and-”
The ball came racing towards him, and Harry let muscle memory take over. His mind went blank as he pivoted with the ball, feeling the seconds on the clock tick down in time with the beat of his hammering heart. He sensed each and every player behind him, he could feel them running after him. But he was already gone. Harry raced to the goal and without thinking he set up the shot—hoping,
The possibility of having this—someone like Harry, to love him, hold him—had always seemed impossible to Draco. It had always seemed like a fantasy, something that he saw others have but never experienced for himself. Looking at Harry, he realized that he never wanted to let this go.
He was cut off by Harry’s lips slanting over his, somehow soft and bruising at the same time. A new fire sparked in Draco’s chest, kindled by the love and lust he felt, by the certainty that settled in his bones. Slowly, they shuffled toward Harry’s bed, hands wandering and clothes finding themselves removed from bodies and tossed onto the floor.
It was dark. It was dark, and Harry didn’t know why. Panic began to set in. His heart started racing, his breathing labored. He could have sworn that two seconds ago, he’d been with Hermione in the common room. They’d been fine, talking quietly in the corner. He’d been working up to telling her what had been pressing on his mind, working up the courage to take down that first stone in the dam that he’d built to hold everything back.
Draco had pinched the tender part of his bicep—not hard enough to hurt, but enough to let him know that he didn’t like it.
Draco looked at him for a second before he seemed to process that he was supposed to shake Harry’s hand. “Draco Malfoy. I really am sorry.”
“Oh,” Pansy interjected, “they were just fine until Draco made us late to first hour this morning.” Draco groaned, knowing what was coming next.
Idle chatter followed the loud laughter, and Harry felt unbelievable loving warmth spread throughout his entire body, reaching every nook and cranny. He almost felt like he could be glowing. He’d missed this. He’d missed being with his little family.
It felt as though half of Harry’s heart had gotten in that car and driven away. It was like his lungs had to battle for air, what was left of his heart fought for every beat. His skin felt uncomfortably hot without his ice cube of a boyfriend there to leech off of him.
“Really mate, what’s got your knickers in a twist?” Blaise nudged him again as he took his seat next to him. Blaise continued to stare at him until Draco lifted his eyes from the desk.
And then he saw the face he was looking for. Draco’s face. He was in the bottom row of the stands, closest to the field. Harry was sure that his grin widened as they made eye contact, and Draco started making his way down to the field. Harry didn’t even notice that Pansy and Blaise had been next to Draco.
And just like that, the thorns withered and died, bubbles of bliss growing in their place. After so many years, Harry knew that doubting Hermione’s words never did him any good. A content smile pulled at the corners of Harry’s lips. “Okay. I just wanted to be sure, I guess.”
He only had time to draw his eyebrows together in confusion before someone sat down next to him, filling the spot where Pansy had just been.
“What about Harry?” Theo asked from behind him. There was a prevalent sort of worry in his voice, making his words tremble.
Harry reached over the table to hold both of Draco’s hands, his smile turned a little nervous, his eyes bore into Draco’s.
The northern common room was brimming with students; even those from younger years were dancing to the upbeat music that seemed to come from every corner of the room. But Draco couldn’t be bothered with any of that.
“Really?” Grey eyes widened even further and pink lips parted in what Harry recognized as disbelief.
Icy, soft hands suddenly trailed across the skin at Harry’s hips, just at the hem of his shorts. That, combined with the cool breath fanning across his shoulder, made him shiver as goosebumps flowered across his skin. A familiar pair of silky lips pressed a delicate kiss between Harry’s shoulder blades. Both relief and excitement poured in through every pore in his body, flooding his every sense.
“Go talk to Theo.” Alicia’s black eyes darted over to the boy. He was sitting on one of the benches lining the lockers, his head in his hands, fingers clenched in his brown hair. “He hasn’t moved from that spot in at least three minutes.”
Alright, I hope you liked it! Comment, comment, comment! I love them and they basically make my day. So, I hope you liked it!
A relieved sigh came through the phone. Harry’s lips twitched upwards at the sound of it. Just hearing Sirius’s voice made his heart calm, his breathing easier. The reassurance he got from just that one word was almost ridiculous, but he didn’t care.
“Well,” Remus said, leisurely standing from his seat, “it’s getting late, Nymphie’s going to be home with the kids soon, and Harry, you and Draco need to get back to campus before curfew.”
Though he was sure he’d regret it later, Draco turned and snapped with quiet fire in his voice, “Well don’t just
Harry let out a quiet laugh before resuming his trail of soft kisses down Draco’s neck, over his shoulder, and anywhere he could reach. Draco simply let his head fall back on Harry’s shoulder, closed his eyes, and trusted that Harry wouldn’t leave him in there long enough for his skin to prune.
He knew the way to Harry’s common room well enough by now that he knew he could run his way there without light. That is, until he slipped up the last staircase when a loud, shrill alarm sounded through the air—fire alarms. He barely caught himself at the last second. It hadn’t even registered with him that he’d fallen until he was already up and running again, trying to block out the ear-splitting, piercing alarms.
, Harry.” She tried to pull her body closer to his, but he simply rolled over so they were facing one another. She gently brushed his hair from his face, curling her arms around him again as he laid his head on her shoulder, his face in her neck, arms around her waist; she felt a bit like a human teddy bear, but she didn’t mind. Hermione was just contented with the fact that Harry had even found the strength to let her in.
“Yeah, they are,” Draco said, his voice soft and words slow. Quickly swallowing the last bit of the blueberry muffin he’d started picking at earlier, Draco met Sirius’ softened gaze. He gave Harry’s hand a gentle squeeze. “I started drawing those after Harry told me about his parents. There are others, ones that aren’t just pencil, but…”
“There’s a little sushi place downtown that Draco’s been wanting to go to,” Harry answered. Giddiness flooded through Draco. He’d only mentioned the restaurant in passing, but Harry always seemed to remember everything he said. Since he’d heard about the place opening a few months ago, he’d wanted to go there, the sole reason that it was exactly the kind of place his father would never permit him to step foot in. The place was downtown, and Lucius Malfoy was known for never settling for anything less than high-class restaurants and service. And while Draco enjoyed those things, he also hated his father’s attitude towards anything he deemed below him.
“No, no, I think you’ll be alright without one,” Harry looked at the others for the first time since he’d seen Draco, “Pansy, Theo, Blaise, it was nice seeing you all again. I’ll have Draco back before curfew.” Theo nodded at him, and Harry could tell that he would be the hardest of Draco’s friends to befriend himself.
Harry thought, his stomach twisting into a knot. He’d tried calling Draco earlier that night, but he hadn’t picked up. Harry had just assumed that he was still at his mother’s party. He quickly answered his phone, his voice gravelly and deep with sleep as he spoke.
Clutching at his chest, Harry slumped to the floor where he’d been standing, desperately trying to blink away the black spots dancing around his hazy vision. He couldn’t breathe, couldn’t see, couldn’t hear, couldn’t stand, he
Harry nodded, then turned back to his locker to shove the rest of his things inside, smiling slightly. After he closed it, he walked past Draco to the door and said, “Come on, then.”
Tears welled behind Draco’s eyes. Looking deep into Harry’s eyes, he started searching for any sign of falsehood, or lies. But the only thing he could find was a desperate kind of earnestness. Draco’s lips spread in a wide smile, his chest exploded with elation, his heart erupted with ecstasy.
Forcing his limbs to move, Draco ambled to his suitcase beside the bed, pulling out all the art supplies he’d brought with him, then shuffled to sit down at his desk. Flipping through his sketchbook, Draco smiled at the ones that depicted his friends. His heart steadied when he saw the one he’d drawn of Pansy, a wicked grin splitting her lips. The next few pages were all of Harry. His lungs stopped stuttering as he studied the rendition of his boyfriend’s face.
Heat suddenly effloresced throughout Draco’s veins. Scarlet surely stained his face—he could feel it in his ears all the way down to his chest. It was hard to look at his boyfriend in the eyes when Harry said things like that, and thinking straight was impossible.
“Who you talkin’ to?” Teddy asked. His dark green eyes were wide as he gaped keenly at Draco, who gave a weak wave and nervous smile.
Draco swung their hands between them. “Do you want to talk about why you’re needing to hit things?” His voice was casual but Harry could hear the concern behind them. He supposed now was as good a time as any to start telling Draco about where he came from. And—for better or worse—Harry trusted Draco. And he wanted to trust him with the things he kept closest to his heart.
“So,” he started, looking down at his hands for a moment, “since we haven’t really seen each other around here, I doubt it’ll magically start happening… so, do you want to, um, exchange numbers, or something?”
“Sweetheart, please—” Draco took Harry’s hands, gently unwrapping the elastic cloth around them, “please tell me what’s been eating at you. I don’t want you to hurt yourself.”
“My father is immensely racist, Hermione. I grew up with those words being tossed about like they were nothing, it was normal to me. But-but when I said that to you, I instantly, immediately regretted it. I hated the way that those words felt when I said them, and I wanted to take them back so badly,” he paused, ready to bear the worst of it, “I was just too much of a coward to do it. I was so ashamed and- and I hated myself for it. And I couldn’t stand to let you see that.”
The water was hot on Harry’s skin as he rushed through his shower, attempting to get out of the locker rooms and to his dorm as fast as possible. He didn’t think he could handle the disappointed looks of his teammates on top of the lost game. It wasn’t their first loss with him as captain, but this was the game they’d spent hours upon hours training for. This was the game everyone had been looking forward to
The memory of her, curled in on herself on the stairway in tears, was burned into his brain. Ron had already caused both of them so much pain and so many problems. The things he’d said had opened too many wounds; it would be a while before they could heal. But no matter how much time they gave it, Harry knew that there would always be scars on the once-clean surface of their friendship.
