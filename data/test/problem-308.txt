He was coming fast down Draco’s throat, the pleasure making him see white spots in his vision, crashing through him was the most intense orgasm Harry had ever had. Draco pulled off of him, collapsing over his chest, exhalingly heavily. He kissed Draco’s hair, stroking circles into his back. “what do you say we finish this upstairs?” Harry murmured into Draco’s ear; he could practically feel the smirk against his shoulder.
“You whAT?” draco’s eyes widened, Harry beamed from ear to ear. He pulled the other boy in for a hug, lifting Draco off the counter. “I’m gonna be the next DADA teacher at Hogwarts Dray!” He spun him around, meeting his eyes. The dimming sunlight was streaming in through the window, reflecting over his green eyes in iridescent beams. Harry turned his attention back to the pot on the stove, turning the heat up and dropping in some carrots, stirring the pot once again.
‘Yes, but there’s some political unrest back in England right now and Malfoy Senior’s backing that politician everyone talks about…’
Harry sat up. ‘They found out — from Beth and Pauline, I suppose — that we’re heading to Tinworth. Dolohov will go there to wait for us.’ Draco blanched. Harry continued. ‘There’s more.
Esther said, ‘I can’t promise you it will be OK. It might not be. I know that very well. Bad things can happen to good people. But we can’t live in fear.
Real life Harry turned a much deeper red when he undressed. On the other side, he was much more unrestrained than his Mirror self as he positively manhandled Draco into bed and climbed over him, kissing him as if he’d been parched and Draco was a spring. Their cocks rubbed against each other, shooting sparks of pleasure down Draco's spine, his mouth glued to Harry's, unable to tear away.
A car roars behind him, the sound deafening. Harry moves closer to the field to let it pass, but it pulls up right beside him.
Draco had always been on the side of the powerful, the wealthy, the connected; it showed in his reluctance to put himself in harm’s way. Though, Harry couldn’t blame him. It wasn’t like he was jumping at the chance for possible capture, torture and death.
Malfoy huffed, cold and contemptuous, his eyes on his aunt’s knife. ‘Will you kill me, Potter?’ he asked, his voice taunting. Malfoy had never been that good of an actor; the trembling of his hands and his shallow breathing belied his uncertainty in Harry’s benevolent nature.
Draco remained gazing at the fire. ‘I mean there are no posters about me. No rewards. If these people weren’t decent, you’d have been fucked. But — but I could’ve saved myself. They didn’t care about me.’
Draco curled his index around Harry’s and held tight, an anchor to keep them both from drowning. Wearing a small, content smile, he turned to gaze outside. ‘Who’d have thought Cornwall was so hilly,’ he said conversationally.
bursting through him, every bit of frustration and longing and regret he’d kept hidden inside finding sweet, thunderous release. Grabbing Harry tight, Draco pulled his body flush against him and tilted his face, driving his tongue in deeper. Harry responded eagerly. They kissed for a long time, and every time Harry would attempt to pull back, Draco would pull him back in, kissing him and kissing him until he had enough—and he could never have enough, so he kept kissing Harry, sloppily, wetly, furiously; and he kept pressing Harry against him, hands clutching at his bare shoulders, holding on for dear life.
‘We’ll hitchhike,’ he said. ‘Last time the Death Eaters found us before we had a chance to give it a real go. Or, maybe Dawn knows someone in the village that could give us a lift to a busy junction or something.’
‘Him. He punished Rookwood and Dolohov for not finding us yet. He’s sent them back to the petrol station.’ Harry paused, trying to make sense of what he’d seen. ‘He thinks you helped me free the prisoners and escape.’
Amused, Harry waited on the platform, keeping an eye on the train notices, while Draco marched to the shop’s counter. He peered at the menu high on the wall and poked at the change some more before ordering.
Harry’s exams went okay, his potions exam was a little ropey but aside from that, every other exam seemed to have gone well. He’d never been an academic, but having a particularly brainy roommate gave him a bit of a leg up; also being able to snog the face off said roommate whenever you wanted helped too. They studied a lot together for their exams, Harry barely saw Ron and Hermione, but he just assumed they were super busy with studying too.
Harry found Hermione in the library, she was hunched over a defence against the dark arts textbook, scribbling away at an essay they had just been set. He pulled out a chair across the table from her, her head didn't budge from her parchment. Harry unceremoniously cleared his throat, she just lifted her finger. “One moment Harry”, he immediately shut up, waiting for his friend to finish whatever she was doing. Hermione looked up a few seconds later, holding her essay over head. “Mion-” Harry began, but Hermione put her finger up again, shushing him.
“That should stop the bleeding now Mr Malfoy, as for that bruise, I think Mr Potter got you good there, It will have to go away on its own.” McGonagall threw Harry a disappointed look, before wiping the rest of Malfoy’s face with a tissue.
Harry crawled over to the wall, resting against it gently, he was taken aback when Malfoy sat up next to him.
Malfoy looked Ron up and down, taking his shot. “Real mature Weasley, now can we ask questions that people don’t actually know?” He mumbled, his confidence draining at the mention of the death eaters. “Alright,” Padma Patil piped up, sitting up straighter. “I’ll start off easy, never have I ever cheated on a test?” She took her shot, as did pretty much everyone else, except from Neville and Hermione. Which absolutely didn’t surprise him.
“I deserved it” Malfoy whispered, finally turning to look at him. The dried blood staining his mouth and chin, a bruise appearing under his eye. Harry let out a shaky sigh, the hurt threading through Malfoy’s face. This was the first time that Harry had heard Malfoy ever admit something was his fault, it was almost comforting? It let Harry know that something had shifted in the other boy's life, something for the better.
Draco sighed, “we can do all that, after graduation” Harry mocked sadness, Draco pulled him out the bathroom.
Of course, of all people, Draco would get stuck with Harry Potter as a colleague. He thought he’d got rid of the pretentious tosser after leaving school, assuming Potter would stay as far away from any kind of science as possible; the boy spent most of his time on the football pitch rather than inside a classroom. So it was a pretty big shock when he came sauntering through the door of Lunars a few years ago.
Harry made a strangled sort of sound, running a hand down over his face. Draco slammed the door to the kitchen, striding into the main shop floor. He placed the box of oils on the till counter, unpacking the small glass bottles onto the shelves, his hands shaking ever so slightly from the anxiety running through him. The kitchen door clicked open; Draco didn’t turn around, hoping Harry would just walk past and out of the store.
“We should get the shop open, we have a lot to do today.” Potter said, striding swiftly away from the desk. “Guess I’m doing it then!” Draco yelled at the man walking away from him. Potter just flipped him off before disappearing to the office.
Draco was wandering around again, trying to find his two best friends, they weren’t in Pansy’s room, or in Blaises, and he couldn’t see them in both the great hall and the library. He’d almost ran out of places, but then one place crossed his mind.
Harry sheepishly sat in Professor McGonagall’s office, Malfoy was hunched over next to him, holding a tissue up to his bleeding nose. He was feeling very guilty for getting physical with the boy, they definitely have had their fair share of pretty intense arguments, but the only time they’d ever hurt each other was when Harry was snooping on Malfoy in sixth year. He hadn’t exactly deserved a broken nose but he definitely shouldn’t have been eavesdropping on Malfoy and his friends.
When the letter from Professor McGonagall had arrived at twelve grimmauld place, the world around him faltered.
ty for all the kudos, pls leave a comment if you'd like, i really do love reading them because it helps me better my writing!
And there’s people all around him, they’re saying things but everything is filtering through in distorted waves. He picks at the cotton sheet underneath him, it feels nice through his fingers, momentarily distracting himself from the disgusting agony that runs from the roots of his hair to the tips of his fingers.
Harry looked at Ron, who just raised an eyebrow, shrugging. Harry knew Pansy was a bit reckless at times, she had a reputation around the school for being a little crazy; she’d been too tame since returning to Hogwarts. But Harry was so bored, he could use a little cheering up.
Draco was sitting in his room, smoking at his favourite spot out the window. He was enjoying his little moments of peace before dinner, where he everyone would give him, Pansy and Blaise dirty looks for the whole hour. He looked out over the quidditch pitch from his open window, he missed playing quidditch; if rooming with Potter wasn’t the worst part of eighth year, not being able to play quidditch was.
Normally, Draco would have fought back, but Potter seemed to be in such a state that he didn’t want to hurt him. He stopped, looking back up at Draco, feeling the cut from Harry’s nails starting to bleed down his face, a bruise of his own probably blooming somewhere. Potter reached a shaky hand up, running his finger down Draco’s face, the blood smearing down with it.
Harry gasped, his hands tangling up in Draco’s hair, the instantaneous pleasure rushing through him. “Good boy” fell from his lips, Draco moaned around his dick, sending wonderful vibrations into him. Draco had Harry fully in his mouth now, sucking him hard, his head hitting the back of the sofa; eyes screwed up in pleasure. Harry could feel Draco rutting up against his thigh, probably well on his way to coming for a second time.
He pulled his mouth away from Draco’s neck, kissing him deeply, pressing his hips down. Draco groaned into Harry’s mouth, their kiss getting sloppier as they got more and more into it. Harry had almost forgotten there were other people in the room, until someone clearing their throat snapped him back to reality. Harry immediately leapt off of Draco’s lap, crawling back to his seat at the other side of the circle.
Harry tried to push down the potion still in his system, but the whole point was that it made you tell the truth. Meaning, he had to be honest.
Before Draco could reach the group, a single movement of the scissors freed the hair grasped in the boy’s fist. The rest fell limp against the girl’s face, causing sobs to escape from the child with more force.
Her words ran together as the feelings that had been building inside rushed to get out. She let go of Draco’s hand, so she could hug her knees close to her chest for comfort.
Thomas lifted them in his arms causing them to let out giddy squeals. "You better give the old man trouble for me, OK.”
“And I found the perfect one for you.” Harry announced, a cheeky grin on his face as he rummaged in the hanging aprons.
“Or we could go to the Sanctuary here in England,” Jasmine spoke up, her book tossed aside. “It’s one of the largest zoos in Europe. The place is famous for their many biomes spelled to mimic environments from across the world.”
Staring back at him was an average looking man with brown hair and eyes. His square face a tad broader than Draco’s own. He was of average height and was slightly on the chubby side. This was the perfect disguise for Draco's plan, one could see him a thousand times but never remember him.
His clenched jaw preventing the bitter and angry words from escaping as he followed the woman down the hall.
He brought the snitch close to his lips and whispered, “Thomas Franklin Nitwiker.” At the uttered words, delicate wings unfurled, and the ball darted into the air.
Macy was too focused on brushing off soot that had fallen on her clothes to look out the window in amazement.
Looking around, Draco saw Max asleep, curled into his side, and Isabelle’s limbs spread all over the place. Macy laid on her back, mouth open softly snoring, Jasmine had one hand under her head and the other grasping the blanket to her chin. Thomas was semi-awake. He had one eye slightly opened, gaze on Draco. The other closed, squished against the pillow.
He was having an excellent morning. Mittsy made his Earl Grey tea the perfect temperature. His omelet contained two eggs, bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms; exactly as he liked in. After breakfast he went on a pleasant walk through the ground's garden, even with the slight chill in the air.
Man won the battle this time, the shirt was released. Although, covered in saliva and with a little nibbled off. Unfortunately, the war was just beginning.
Draco thought about this seriously; it clearly mattered quite a bit to the younger male if it caused him this much anxiety.
“Oh no buddy,” Thomas began, resting a hand on the gingers shoulder, then with a devious smile toward the Auror. “With the way he is breathing I doubt he works out much.”
“Ya, Jasmine said that it has a lot to do with balance and flexibility. There’s even a pose where you touch your head with your toes by laying on your stomach and bending your back until the two meet.” Thomas mentioned, casually sensing a weakness in Potter.
“Don’t look at me like that. I told you if you brought that many trunks you’d be responsible for carrying them. And what did you tell me...”
“Draco.” Max's voice floated from behind the man. Draco hummed an acknowledgment his eyes not straying from his task. He had a tent-like cloth levitated and with an uttered sticking charm it hung from the ceiling.
Another small voice spoke up from his other side. “Leave him alone. I want to stay with Draco.” Max said, standing behind Draco, his shaky hands tangled in the blonde’s robes.
A third refusal was in his throat, but his will crumble at her face. It took years to hardened himself from his godson’s look and now it may be just as long to do the same with this girl.
Draco delivered a swift goodbye to Harry and Teddy, not wanting to invoke more teasing for taking too long. He pretended he not to notice Potter watching him until he disappeared in green flames.
“Oh, ha ha very funny.” The blonde man dryly said, before he found himself trapped once more in Macy’s arms. This one with less yelling, but with more tears. Macy’s head was buried in Draco’s chest making her next words muffled, “You had better write to me!”
Yet, Draco couldn’t recall them having a child, let alone a ginger haired one. Both Hawkes were blonde, and none of their ancestors were able to pass down that gene.
This was the beginnings of an epic pillow fight between them all. Max tried to build himself a fort to avoid the conflict entirely. Which worked until Isabelle destroyed the structure with one well-aimed throw. Seeing his haven in shambles, Max joined the fray. Grabbing a pillow to chase Isabelle up the couch, before she flung herself off with a cry of “Thomas!” latching on the other boy’s back.
The only response was Isabelle flipping over onto her stomach, so she couldn’t see the man in front of her anymore.
The envelopes were bound together with a piece of twine and keeping them closed was a red wax seal. That presented a familiar school crest.
McClain was the first of the three to speak up. “Mr. Malfoy, the DMLE have received some concerning reports that you're harboring a group of dark wizards.”
“Let’s go!” said the shortest of the three. And with one final sneer at the girl, they dashed out the alley, laughing and joking all whole way.
Before, when he thought of the future and what he was doing caused him to sob, but now the same thought brought a hopeful smile on his face.
“Also, Potter, I don’t believe I gave you permission to call me by my first name,” Draco casually threw over his shoulder.
The fireplace was inlaid with grey marble. A soft, brown wood engraved with the Malfoy Crest framed the marble. The grey couch, handpicked by Draco himself, was plush and made with a smooth cloth. It was as comfortable as any bed, which could be the reason Draco found himself dozing midday, a book on his chest. A small table placed in front of the couch had a shaggy, Slytherin green rug beneath it, protecting Draco's feet from the cold floor.
The battle of Hogwarts had left everyone at ease, but it left Harry confused. There were many things that had happened during the war that Harry could simply not explain, but by far the most confusing thing that has ever happened to Harry was Draco Malfoy.
was, just under Malfoy who really was surprisingly good at potions. They were working on the cure for boils, it had been a solid while since Harry had been stood over a cauldron and he was having a really hard time time trying to figure it out.
“I’m close, doing so well for me baby.” Harry’s words were slurred, getting dangerously close to spilling down Draco’s throat. He felt the boy coming all over his thigh and that was enough to send Harry over the edge.
But it was Macy that had done the most work this night. She had already finished Thomas’ makeup, who was surprisingly docile during the whole thing. When questioned about his nonchalant attitude he shrugged and claimed he was used to such antics from Macy.
Their reactions to the letters came as a surprise to Draco, who as a kid would be ecstatic to get his letter each year. Unsure how to breach the topic with the uneasy feeling that settled over the table Draco left it alone. Hoping that if it was about something significant, they would come to him.
The others were getting farther away from them, so Draco scooped the boy up using his unoccupied arm. He picked up the pace to catch up as Max’s head sleepily drifted onto Draco’s shoulder.
“Of course, he’s not poppet. Mr. Potter is being the one being a prat. It’s his own fault for scaring you, he should know better than to throw blame and call you names.” Draco gave Harry a hard glare and got a contrite look in return.
Mood worsening once he'd heard that most of his classmates returned to Hogwarts for an eighth year. The golden trio included. Even Slytherins, that weren’t killed or jailed, had the opportunity to go back.
“We’re walking the whole way to the Ministry!” Jasmine exclaimed in disbelief. “Surely, we can’t be traveling to London on foot?”
“I’m sorry, Mal-Wait, I mean, I’m sorry, Draco. I should not have used that spell on you, it was stupid and reckless. If I knew what that spell did, I would never have cast it.”
Did Draco even deserve this apology after everything he had done? A whirlwind of confusing and contradictory feels erupted, threatening to drown him.
When Mittsy had told him that Senior Auror Terrence McClain and Junior Auror Harry Potter were walking up his pathway, he thought she'd taken a few of his hallucinogenic potions. But here they are.
About twenty minutes into the ride, Isabelle became bored with the scenery out the window; setting her sight on Draco and Max.
He laid on the floor, sketch pad in hand with one of Max’s dragons placed to model for his drawing. Draco was surprised when Thomas had joined them that morning after breakfast. The teenager preferred listening to the radio as it spewed the Quidditch scores for the week in the solitude of his room.
Draco strode to Isabelle’s room giving it a knock before entering and found her jumping on the bed. From the state of the bedding, she’d been at it for a while.
Macy looked a ghost, with her pale face and dark, purple bags under her hazel eyes. Her hair uncombed and tangled as if she tossed and turned the whole night, until she decided to venture here.
Draco seemed to have run out of child friendly insults to throw at Harry and was trying to set Max on the floor. But the boy had a handful of Draco’s shirt and refused to put any strength in his legs to keep him up-right.
“It’s OK. You won't be going anywhere near your parents or Azkaban. I promise,” the older man said giving Maximus’ arm a gentle squeeze. Only taking a step back when the boy had relaxed enough that he wouldn’t continue his previous actions.
Draco nodded along, cursing Potter for putting such thoughts into the girl’s head. Now, she may go find a snake to ‘talk’ to just to get injured. Not only that, few people would be kind if she pretended to be a parselmouth.
“Hey, I’m going to get Isabelle ready for bed. I’ll come back to help you next if you don’t mind waiting.” Draco told the boy once he opened the door.
“I can’t talk to idiots.” Draco said, a hand to a temple. He walked away, breaking whatever trance that fell over Potter. And he was quick to chase after the other man.
“Nah, if they really want it back, they can report me.” Harry said, slipping a hand into Max’s free one so they were walking in line.
Draco downed the brown mixture in one go. Shuddering at the disgusting taste, he braced a hand on the wall as his body changed. Once the disorienting feeling passed, Draco checked the mirror to ensure nothing was out of place.
“This is the best the Ministry can produce?” came the condescending voice of Thomas. “It really is pathetic.” The final word dripping with disdain. Draco could feel a headache coming on.
The three looked much more relieved and relaxed the rest of the night. Macy finally choosing a turquoise polish, announcing that it was the color for Draco. Once his nails were completed to Macy’s professional standards, the fire was extinguished, and everyone laid down for their much-needed rest. But before they fell asleep Thomas cheekily quipped, “Who would have thought you’d be so sappy, Draco?”
“It was at that time that it really hit me about the kind of destruction I was capable of. And I am so sorry that you had to be at the receiving end of it.” Harry finished, retaining eye contact with the other.
“I told you Macy, four trunks are too much.” Thomas claimed as he watched his sister huffing as she struggled with her load. He had opted out of placing his single trunk with the others, deciding to carry his himself.
“You know what I find funny,” Thomas spoke up. The teen stared defiantly into the eyes of the man who defeated the darkest wizard of their time. “That you came here accusing someone of a crime with no proof. He took us in and fed and clothed us.” He finished in whispered disbelief, with a gasp and a hand over his mouth.
This launched the story of Hercules’ brave deeds that King Eurystheus tasked him as punishment for murdering his own wife and kids.
"How can I assist you, Max?" Draco said, cutting off the charm once the sheet was secured and turned to the boy.  Max stood in the doorway fiddling with the camera that hung from his neck.
He cursed his rash decision. Far too Gryffindor-like; there was no chance that his scheme would succeed. And if his fake credentials won’t give him up, it would be because he had hexed this woman out of annoyance.
The streaks of morning light that made their way through the window fell on the young man. They caressed his face and body, casting shadows on the floor beside him. Accentuating the strong features of his face and causing his pale hair to glow.
It was such a simple thought, but true. And surprisingly enough it did make him feel more at ease. So, he informed everyone that he was going to try to relax by doing something that he hadn’t done in a while, yoga.
“That look doesn’t do much to change my mind about you two.” Harry laughed at Thomas’ grossed out face and walked over to Teddy, shaking his head at the other’s actions.
But it was his kids that held his attention. Thomas and Jasmine stood side by side chests out and faces stern. Behind them was Macy who held her head high. A large bruise was forming from her eye across her cheek and there seemed to be a bite wound oozing blood on her wrist.
What Harry wasn’t expecting was the strong shock he’d received when he touched the door handle. No counter charm he knew would break the curse placed on the door knob. It wasn't until the fifth shock, a numb hand, and various co-workers snickering for Harry to leave the Ministry.
Now, Draco was struggling to pull Isabelle away from the penguin exhibit. They were making their way to the rainforest habitat where the others were already waiting.
A fire was lit in the fireplace casting shadows in a dance across the walls. They all were once more gathered in the living room, it was a peaceful scene no outsider could encroach on their private bubble.
“Oh, right. I forgot about that." Draco said. He bit his lip looking worriedly at Isabelle, who looked back with a smile.
Setting his burden down, Draco approached the child. Placing a hand over the abused forearm to stop the subconscious movements.
“Professor, you are one of the smartest men I know, and I wouldn’t have anyone else teach my kids the Slytherin way.” Draco said, fluttering his lashes.
Hearing her name Macy turned from the mirror to the group. On her feet, she wore two different types of boots.
Max stood to the side arms crossed at his chest, a puddle forming at his feet. Draco quickly pulled the towel from where it hung and wrapped it around the shivering boy, ensuring everything was dry.
“I can do that; I was blessed with perfect pitch.” She said, her voice soft with understanding. He gave her a grateful nod.
Thomas ignoring the call, turned and buried his head further into the pillow. Pulling the covers up to hide himself from view. The rest of the children were gathered around the table when a loud shout from the first story bedrooms got their attention.
After leaving the train station, Draco had to watch out for Max who stuck as close as possible to the older man, tripping him up every now and then. He also had to keep Macy from falling behind, shop windows distracting her. A hand kept Isabelle restrained because she continued to run off to explore as he guided Jasmine around. The bespectacled girl refused to stash away her book, so she had to be pulled out of the way of light poles and other people.
“They want everyone to believe the war is over, but in those halls, it’s still raging strong. Every Slytherin is an enemy doesn’t matter if the kid’s a muggle born or a pure- blood. And it’s not only our house being affected. Pure bloods from any house are being targeted and don’t get me started on those with death eater ties. Students are being disowned if they are not placed in the ‘correct’ house. And I’m sick of it, why does it matter? All because a stupid hat decides to place you in a glorified dorm doesn’t have anything to do with who a person will be. Only they can decide that! No one seems to care that there is nothing but fear and hatred still at Hogwarts and it needs to be addressed!” Thomas finished his rant, chest heaving and eyes glassy.
Finally sitting down for their meal, Draco looked at the tables occupants and thought back to his meals before they'd all met. Meals spent alone and feeling sorry for himself. He didn’t know why his life had made this complete one-eighty, but he was thankful to know this group of amazing children. And with a smile on his face, Draco began to eat.
“Godson? You mean that’s my cousin's child?” Draco inquired, leaning down to get a glimpse at one of his few living relatives.
“Thank you, Harry.” Draco said, clearing his throat. “If you need any help just ask Mittsy or Professor Snape.”
“No, I’m not from the Ministry, and I’m sure you don’t have anything I need. I'm rich enough that I want for nothing." That came out more conceited then he'd attended. Draco paused to gather his thoughts better before starting over.
“They weren’t good people, their beliefs extreme and ridiculous, but I have no doubts that they loved me. I believe you can hate what they've done and still mourn the loss of the parents you love.”
Jasmine refuse to ask for dishes, preferring to stretch an arm over the plates to reach the food. This didn’t change, no matter how many times Draco told her that if she’d asked, it would be passed.
“It’s not exactly good for a family’s social standing to associate with us, if you know what I mean. Most Slytherin families who wouldn't join He-Who-Should-Not-Be-Named are still carefully watched. There's no way they'd worsen it by taking in Death Eater kids.” Thomas finished.
He looks up, and shakes his head. The woman makes no reaction, removing the picture, and giving him another one.
He was just about nodding off, when the door to the common room burst open. Harry jumped out of his skin, sending his chair flying across the floor. He whipped around to see Pansy Parkinson standing in the entryway, a bottle of firewhiskey in her hand.
“Alright, I’m heading out, need to see ‘Mione.” Potter stubbed his out on the windowsill, unfolding his legs and standing up. He turned before walking out of the door, “see you later?”
Harry was gobsmacked, Draco had been just as into that kiss as he was, and now they were both sat across from each other, painfully hard and having no way to fix it.
The first morning being back at Hogwarts was certainly a shock to the system, Harry had spent all of seventh year hunting for horcruxes and then he fought a war; he had forgotten how much a school day took out of him. His brain wasn't sure how to take in information anymore, it had really caught up to him how much he had missed, Harry had no idea how he was supposed to take his NEWTs at the end of this year. He could barely write an essay anymore.
Harry pulled Draco into his lap, taking his wrist and removing it from his crotch. The other boy whined at the loss of contact, arching his back up against Harry’s chest. He slid up the hem of Draco’s shirt, his cock was straining against his blushed stomach, his eyes still slammed shut. “Look at you Draco, all spread out and needy for me.” Harry knew he was close from the way Draco had Harry’s t-shirt was balled up in his fists, his knuckles going white.
Harry ran over to Malfoy, the knuckles of his hands were covered in blood, he had to have punched something. "You fucking psycho Malfoy! What the hell did you do?!" The whimpering boy in front of him strangled out a "punched a wall" before Harry started healing him, "sorry, I don't know many healing spells" he muttered, before wrapping a bandage around his knuckles. "S'fine" Malfoy shrugged, Harry got up off the floor, moving to sit on his bed.
Harry had been ranting to Ron and Hermione for the past half an hour, he was pacing back and forth in the eighth year common room spouting about how much he loathed his roommate, Ron was studying and Hermione was eating some cookies that the house elves had brought up for them. "Who's bloody idea was to put those two together" Ron mumbled to Hermione under his breath, she just rolled her eyes, leaning her head on to his shoulder. "Someone with a death wish" Ron laughed, Harry finally sat down in one of the armchairs; letting out an exasperated sigh.
Harry shakes his head, this can’t be happening, can it? In his head, he’s just woken up in some random timeline and he’s being fed information that he has no clue how to handle or what to do with. “No, you’re wrong, this isn’t right.”
Draco sighed, turning off the stove and wiping his hands down on his trousers. Pulling open the door, almost running directly into his just
“Do you want to ,maybe, move in with me?” Harry blurted, surprised at what he’d actually said. Draco sat up, his eyes widening, “really?” Harry thought for a moment, living with him outside of Hogwarts sounded like utter heaven. “Yes, I have this huge house and no one to live in it with, having you there would make it a lot less lonely?” He sat up to face Draco, who was gaping. “Yes! Of course I would!” He leaned forward and kissed Harry, it was quick and chaste but it was still filled with love and excitement.
It’s a group photo, of a few people, clad in black robes with contrasting reds, blues, yellows and greens. Harry scans the picture, there’s an oblong boy with substantially large front teeth who stands out, but he feels more like a distant dream than an actual person. His eyes stop, and a burst of memory shoves into him like a bus.
also we hit 300 in two days, thank you so much for all of the support, it seriously makes me so happy!
“‘I’m sorry, you two seem like lovely people. But I don’t know who you are, and I’d very much like to be left alone now.” Harry hears the girls' protests, but he just lies down and turns away from them.
He looked at his empty childhood bedroom, he expected to feel upset, but a flurry of excitement rushed through him; breaking into a huge smile.
Harry made a small yelp of surprise before kissing him back, he slid his tongue into Draco’s mouth, wrapping his hands around his neck. Draco pulled Harry into his lap, biting on to his lip, grabbing at the back of his shirt. Harry's hands tangled into the other boy's hair, tugging his head backwards, kissing down his neck. He could see the goosebumps appearing on Draco’s skin, his hands grasping for anything to hold onto.
Draco sat down on a ledge, letting his legs dangle off into the night air. Harry sat down next to him, leaning over the railing. He looked at Draco, he was looking out over the grounds, his face focused and his jawline sharp. He smiled at the boy, feeling a flush of calm wash over him. “I like coming up here” Draco started, “it makes you forget.” Harry suddenly had the best idea he’d ever had.
"So it really is true?" Malfoy glowered, staring down Harry intently, "the door wasn't a boggart?" Harry shooed away Hermione, walking in and tossing his bag down on the empty bed. Malfoy was parading about the room with his usual strut, Harry noticed that Malfoy appeared to be a clean freak; picking things up and putting them down again to get them in their exact place. That surprised him, Harry had just always guessed they had house elves to do everything for them.
Harry was reading in the common room, a place he hadn’t been in a few months, he figured he had to spend a little more time there considering he was leaving school forever tomorrow. Harry hadn’t even started packing up his stuff yet, he was planning on doing it tonight, he and Draco had made a pretty big mess of their room. There were exam papers, sheet music and textbooks scattered everywhere and Harry just couldn’t be bothered to clean all that up just yet.
He glanced over at Hermione who was across the table from him, her potion was near perfect and he had barely started his. Harry let out a groan, looking up at the clock on the wall. He only had twenty minutes left to complete his potion, he felt like crying, or kicking over his cauldron, maybe both.
“I-” Harry stuttered, unclear of what he was about to say. Malfoy’s head lifted a bit but he just stared forward.
“Me and Ron had a fight, well it was less of a fight and more of a pinning me down to the ground and calling me a traitor but it was physical, it’s the first time i’ve ever had a physical fight with anyone other than well...you.” Potter concluded, gesturing towards Draco with his head. His shoulders had relaxed since sitting down, his face had regained normal colour too; Draco took a little pride in the fact that he calmed the great Harry Potter down.
This was what he wanted, Draco longed for the touch of the other man, not even just sexually. He wanted to hold Harry’s hand as they walked home together, he wanted to kiss him on the cheek while they cooked dinner for each other, he wanted to fall asleep in his arms, their breathing falling into sync.
Harry however, knocked on Ron’s door, surprised when it actually opened, he was fully ready for him to just slam the door in his face but Ron smiled, sadly, but he was still smiling. His face was red, his eyes bloodshot. “I’m sorry, truthfully, ‘Mione’s been working with me on my anger,I think you know more than anyone that I struggle with it.” Ron said sincerely, Harry nodded, laughing a little. “So will you let me apologise?” his friend  was trying to keep his cool, but his eyes were begging.
His attention pulled back to the pot in front of him, it was simmering away nicely, releasing a pleasant lavender aroma. Draco grabbed a few of the jars labeled “Lavender milk bath” from the cupboard, ladling the liquid into them. This was undoubtedly his favourite part of working in the shop, he got to do all the packaging for their products; and he took great pride in making them perfect. Draco loaded up the bottles into a small wicker basket, kicking open the door to the main shop.
Draco pulled Harry away as soon as he could, after this moment, the rest of their life started; they needed one last time to just be teenagers.
It’s because he has no idea where he is, sitting next to people that he has no idea who they are. He swallows loudly, turning gently to his left.
Draco’s hands were stroking up and down Harry’s back, his face buried in Harry’s hair, both of them gently moving back and forth. “I’m glad I got to dance with you.” Harry whispered into Draco’s chest, he could feel the other boy smiling against his hair. “I mean, you taught me how to dance and I almost didn’t get to dance with you.”
Thinking on it, Harry didn’t actually know how the wizarding world took people being gay, he knew proper purebloods like Draco’s family weren’t crazy about it, the whole “keep things pure” malarky. But they allowed incest so Harry wasn’t too worried about what they would think if he wanted to snog boys.
They were both silently walking around the room, running their fingers over the furniture, reliving memories they had made together in the small dorm room. Draco couldn’t wait to make more with Harry in Grimmauld Place.
“I’m sorry you just look, really funny.” she giggled, moving his hair to the side, revealing the cut from Potter’s nails, her expression changed to a look of worry. “How did you get that?” Draco just shrugged, the memory was faint now, “Potter”, he had almost forgotten their fight, other things were more important than a stupid fight. He could tell Pansy was about to freak out so placed a hand on her shoulder. “It’s okay, I have other things to tell you,” he assured, she lit up, clapping her hands together at the mention of gossip. “He hit me, he then called me lovely, then had a panic attack, then asked if we could’ve been friends at some point, i called him Harry and then I just left.” he said, easily, as if he was just reading from a textbook.
He walked over to the windowsill, taking the cigarette out of the metal box; he sat down and put it between his lips, leaning forward as Malfoy lit it with his wand.
He poured Harry a glass of wine that he brought from home, dimming the lights a little with his wand, before joining his boyfriend at their kitchen table. Eating the first meal in their new home together.
Ron is a drama queen, Draco and Harry have their first tutoring session, everyone is really angry and Harry goes a little mad
Harry clearly took his own shot; he’d cheated on every potion test for all of sixth year due to Snapes book. He felt the drink sliding down his throat, leaving a burning taste in the back of his mouth. He shook his head, already feeling the Veritaserum entering his system. This was going to be a
He looked over at Ron, who was staring intently at Professor McGonagall, He looked fine but Harry knew there was nothing he could do to fill the hole of Fred Weasely. McGonagall was telling them about the new year, and what the eighth year arrangements would be:
Harry grimaced, shuddering at the thought of how disgusting the floor was. Still, Ginny crawled into her stomach and completed her dare. She was always a ballsy girl; it was something Harry had always admired. Ginny sat up, turning to Draco. “Draco! Truth or dare?” There was a glint of trouble in her eyes, which meant this was probably going to be really good. “I’m not a pussy, dare.” Draco snapped. Ginny smiled the smuggest smile he’d ever seen.
Oh for fucks sake" Harry hissed, Hermione appeared at his side, she sighed, giving him a pitying look. "I'm sure It'll be fine harry, if he drives you to insanity you can always ask McGonagall to switch." Hermione reminded, patting him on the shoulder; Harry grunted, shoved the door to his room open. Someone was already unpacking his stuff in his-
"No i'm not, I'm much worse." Malfoy mumbled, getting off the windowsill and leaving the room. Harry stubbed his own cigarette out, flopping backwards onto his bed, the smell and feeling of the nicotine circling around his body.
“Malfoy made this; how do we know he’s not about to poison all of us?” Ron spat, shuffling away from the circle. Harry heard Draco scoff, leaning forward and tilting his head forward. “If I wanted to poison
“Draco!” Harry had caught up with him, walking next to Draco. “What time do you want me at yours next week?” he asked, Draco had almost forgotten that Harry was coming to the Manor, he heartbeat speeding up at the thought of Harry Potter being at his house in dress robes. “Seven” he choked out “I’ll see you then.” Harry beamed, a glint shimmering in his pretty eyes.
i am thinking of writing a oneshot of our favourite boys moving into Grimmauld place, if that's something you want to see then let me know.
Harry pulled away from Draco slightly, just enough so he could see his face. The moonlight was kissing his blonde hair, his cosmic eyes shimmering in the lowlight, his face pale except for a soft pink tinting his cheeks; gods Draco was simply exquisite.
He glanced out the large window at the front of the shop, it was still dark outside. Not surprising for it being early december. Draco pushed open the door to the small, lab-like kitchen at the back of the store, shivering slightly; he pulled his jumper closer to his skin to retain some warmth. His hands reached for the green pan from one of the cabinets, placing it on the stove burner to heat up. Draco bumbled about the supply cupboard, picking up the ingredients he needed to start cooking up his concoction. He undid the ribbon on a small bag of lavender, tipping them into the pan.
“Well, what do you propose Draco my love?” Pansy said, with a wink. Draco stood up from the wall, walking into the middle of the circle, producing a vial of pearly liquid from his pocket and throwing it to Pansy; who’s eyes widened.
He opens his eyes, they’re still sitting to his left, burning holes through his skin. Harry tries, he really does, to put names to the faces. But he can’t, as much as he wants to know them, he just has no idea who they are.
He took his wand off his neck, everyone was clapping but he didn’t care about everyone. He was looking at Draco and Draco only, his grey eyes shimmering with tears. He gave Harry a small smile before mouthing to him.
Walking through the Hogwarts grounds again felt unnatural, Draco didn't have any worries this year; he'd certainly messed up a lot in his years at Hogwarts, his biggest regret was not telling Dumbledore what was going on before everything hit the fan. He thought he could control it, he thought that he could deal with everything alone. But it went too far too quickly, and he just had to deal with all of his mistakes. It was his own fault, he made his bed so he had to lie in it.
And that was it, he came with a shout, back arching; the remnants of “Harry” falling out of his mouth.
Draco, on the other hand, bolted straight to Pansy’s room, needing to tell her everything. He felt like he was going to have a panic attack of his own, his breath labouring his throat as he ran all the way to his best friend; he had messed up a lot in there, and Pansy knew how to help with everything.
Potter exhaled, fiddling with his hands, Draco clasped his hands around his, stopping him from shaking so much. “You’re okay,” Draco assured him.
“You’re different, you’ve changed since the war.” Harry stated, meeting Malfoy’s eyes, the boy seemed to twitch at the mention of the war , his mouth opening scarcely, just as he was about to speak, Harry heard the door open. McGonagall moved swiftly through the opening, holding a small glass container, dripping the pearlescent liquid onto Malfoy’s lip; the blood disappearing straightaway.
“We have too much unfinished business, you can’t make anything positive out of what has happened between us, it’s too much hurt, i-” he trailed off, he knew what he wanted to say but it didn’t seem like the right time, but Potter raised an eyebrow, silently asking him to continue.
ty for all the views, they are going up so quickly and i am just delighted! i really do love all of you:)
“It’s practically criminal! First I have to live with him, now I have to spend every night for the next week with the arsehole! It’s basically child abuse!” Harry lamented, rolling on to his back, he let out a heavy sigh; the dread streaming through him, he could feel it lighting every nerve in his body. “Harry I don’t mean to interrupt your breakdown, but it’s 7:55.” Ron heaved, grabbing Harry’s legs and pulling him off the bed. Once he was upright, Ron handed him his bag and his quill, opening the door for him.
“I’m so glad I met you, this version of you.” Draco rambled, “you’ve always been so special, you are genuinely the most amazing person I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.” Harry blushed at the compliments, no one had ever said those words before, not truthfully anyway, anyone who’d ever told him that was just trying to get something from him. But here was his lifelong enemy, someone who he spent so many years hating more than anything that ever walked the earth, telling him those things. Harry’s heart was beating so loudly he was sure Draco could hear it.
“But seriously Harry, I know now how happy he makes you, he’s good for you. And you’re good for him.” Harry pulled Ron in for another hug, when they disconnected, Ron stood up.
Harry's mind travelled back to his current problem, he had to get help with his potions work, but if Hermione couldn’t help, his list of smart friends that would be willing to help dwindled to zero. He felt like breaking down, his head fell into his hands, the weight of the world on his shoulders was pulling him down further into a hole; his inner quarrel with himself slowly taking over every other thought in his mind.
Ron said flatly, Harry gulped, looking anywhere other than directly in front of him. Hermione’s gaze softened, touching Ron gently on his back; tucking a red curl behind his ear. “Maybe you should take this outside boys” she suggested sweetly, Ron shot up, almost knocking his plate over in his intensity. “Yes. I think we should.” He was bloody angry, and Harry guessed he was about to find out why.
“We don’t have to, but god Harry” Draco looked up at him, “you have me, until every last star in the galaxy dies.”
“If it makes you feel better, me and Blaise fight all the time, you see this scar here?” he pointed to a thin scar down the side of his neck, Potter nodded. “Sixth year, Blaise has long fingernails.” Draco said, Potter laughed, pushing Draco’s head to the side a bit. He ran a finger down his neck, tracing over the scar with his finger; Draco shivered under the other boy's touch, goosebumps prickling his skin. Potter’s hand immediately pulled away.
“Your name is Harry Potter, you’re sixteen years old, you’re in sixth year at Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry. When you were a baby, you defeated the greatest dark wizard there has ever been, and now, you’re probably one of the most famous people in our world. But you’re more than that, you’re funny, and you’re kind, and you’re a sarcastic little bitch, but shockingly enough, you’re my best friend in the whole world. My name is Ron Weasley, and that girl over there? That’s Hermione Granger, and we’ve been best friends since we were eleven years old. And you remember Draco bloody Malfoy over us.”
“Ginny! I’m sorry I didn’t see you there.” Harry squeaked, willing or her to just nod and leave him alone, the red-head was beaming, she pulled him into a hug. Her smell made him almost tear up, the smell he smelt for three years in his amortentia was now no longer his, he hadn’t checked to see if it had changed since they had broken up; he’d probably break down if he still smelt Ginny.
“He’s right Pans, if he wants to move in with Harry, just bloody let him.?” Blaise nodded at Draco, who gave him a slight smile before leaving the shed.
“Am I up for ransom or something?” He smirks, leaning back against the stone wall, a cool droplet of water dripping onto his neck. Madam Pomfrey gives a half smile, but Harry can tell she’s trying hard not to laugh. “No Harry, but Weasely is right, you are famous and everyone here knows who you are, so we’re keeping you safe until we can sort you out.” She lets out a shaky breath, and He leans his head back, touching it to the stone. This was insane, he wasn’t famous, or popular, or a literal
“Veritaserum...good one, where’d you get this Dray?” Pansy mused; Draco sat down directly in Harry’s eyeline, leaning against the back of the sofa. “Brewed it the other day.” He added, nonchalantly. Harry was surprised, he didn’t know Malfoy was actually that smart. Pansy stands, lacing their shots with the potion. “Hold on a minute” Ron stops Pansy before she can drip the liquid into his drink.
He wasn’t happy when his friendship was rejected. Which sparked a six year hatred between the two of them, and hadn’t died down in their adult life. They mostly worked in anger induced silence or dirty looks.
Dean gave him a knowing look, turning to look at Pansy, a smile playing on his lips. “I say we have some fun with them?” Pansy’s face lit up at the thought off mischief, she looked at Draco; who was sat smugly against the sofa. “Draco’s hard.” She said easily, as if it was the most normal statement to say. Everyone was snickering, the boy across from him went even redder than before, pulling his shirt down.
Seven years, it’s weird how much of that you can undo in only a short amount of time. Harry felt like he had known this version of Draco for his entire life, it was odd to think it had only been a few months.
“I think I smelled you in my amortentia in sixth year.” Draco’s mouth was hanging open, he never understood what he smelled in the potion, he literally didn’t smell his own girlfriend so he just assumed his one wasn’t working properly. Harry was stifling a laugh, a hand flying over his mouth. “Sorry, that’s not funny” he tried to say seriously, but Harry was almost tearing up trying to hold this laugh in.
A short, stout woman shuffles through the crowd of people, she’s holding a few glass bottles with varying amounts of colourful liquids, they clink together as she places them down on the table next to him. And then they’re being shoved into Harry’s hands, and down his throat.
Draco didn’t even knock, he just burst right into Pansy’s room, the girl didn’t even look up from her book; just sighing gently. “Yes, Draco my love?” she sang, he could hear the smile in her voice. “How did you-”
It was the place where they realised that they looked at each other just a little too long for them to be just friends, it was their special place.
So why was he being taken there? Could it possibly just have been so they got some peace and quiet, thinking about it , that one actually made a lot of sense. Their dorm room only had one desk, they would get funny looks in the library and the common room; the only other place was the room of requirement. He glanced down at his watch,
The rest of the ceremony was quite emotional, getting his final certificate made him cry his eyes out with Ron and Hermione. He was so proud of himself, getting through everything he had gone through and he still managed to pull some decent qualification off. Once it was over, there was a kind of party in the great hall, everyone excitedly moving through the hallways. Harry could feel the buzz in the air, he was listening to Ron talking about something to do with Quidditch when a pale hand pulled him away.
Harry groaned, deciding instead to just go down to the kitchens instead, to avoid running into Ron and Hermione. Considering they still hadn’t spoken since their argument earlier on, he didn’t feel that showing up to sit with them at dinner would be the best option. He sauntered his way down the kitchens, taking the long way so he could spend more time outside his room. He liked just walking around Hogwarts, all of his happiest memories had been here, walking through them all again almost blacked out the even worse memories of the war.
He’d hated rooming with him originally, but in time, Draco had grown to love the mess that Harry just created wherever he went. He’d also grown to love the boy who left in the first place.
“Hey Malfoy, can I ask you something?” Potter asked, tentatively. Draco took a sip from his glass before nodding.
Correction, Potter did not call Draco lovely, Potter called the mess he had made of Draco’s face after beating him up lovely. Then proceeded to smear Draco’s own blood down his cheek, he could still see it on Potter’s fingers. He looked down at Potter, his face was tear streaked, he was holding his hands up, his wrists were covered in fingernail marks and the backs of hands were bruised. His eyes filled with shock and guilt.
His dreams had been uneasy, flitting visions of stone dungeons and dark alleys. Voldemort’s presence never left Harry; the pull he exerted snatched at the edges of his consciousness; long, grasping fingers like the voices wishing to lure them in the forest. Their days at the cottage were running out; Sunday drew inexorably closer. The war beckoned.
Draco detached himself from Harry, shuffled down the bed, and settled between Harry’s legs. Harry understood — and experienced such a wave of lust that he almost choked. Even Draco’s breath on his cock aroused him, and he told him that.
But it wouldn’t do any good to start a fight. So he crouched and unlaced Malfoy’s shoes. He cradled each foot, making sure Malfoy held the wall for balance, and removed the shoe and the sock. It felt strange, touching Malfoy’s bare feet.
was the smuggest expression Harry ever saw on Draco Malfoy. ‘Better not die yet,’ Draco said and arranged himself next to Harry, his erection bobbing, hard and glistening. ‘You’ve got to get me off too.’
Apparently, he didn’t have to. ‘So it isn’t just his cock that has you going back there every day? He has
he’d been feeling all day when he caught glimpses of emotion and vulnerability behind the mask Malfoy hurried to put on. It disturbed Harry, this uneasiness that settled in his chest. His mind warned him that it could only mean one thing: deception. This could all be a ruse, making Malfoy look like a decent person before the carpet was pulled under Harry’s feet.
“You’re a terrible liar Draco Malfoy.” Potter’s voice was thick and raspy, and filling through Draco’s ears like water.
Harry sat in the room for ages after Malfoy left, just mulling everything over. It was well past midnight now, he could see the moon hanging high in the sky out the window. He looked down at his hands, the angry red marks around his wrists were burning with pain and his knuckles were all bruised from being pushed so hard against the concrete hallway. His whole body drooped down, Harry felt like he was to blame for the whole argument with Ron and tonight just proved his theory right.
He had this incredible chance at a relationship, but all he could feel was shame? He'd got too carried away, enjoyed himself too much, and that little voice at the back of his head was shouting at him again; telling Draco that he was disgusting.
When Harry asked him to move into Grimmauld Place, it was their final day at Hogwarts, they were tangled up together in their dorm room and Harry had just blurted it out. It seemed like such an insane idea, but now that Draco was packing up his entire life into boxes, he couldn’t wait to be rid of the Manor.
“Is it true you and Weasley are shagging?” Hermione’s cheeks went pink, taking a drink from her glass. “We were, we’re not anymore.” She said truthfully, Harry knew this, they had tried a relationship for a few months after the war, but it just wasn’t working; they broke up before coming back to Hogwarts, it was mutual so they were still really good friends. “I’ll go next, Ginny, truth or dare?” Neville asked, Ginny just scoffed. “Dare.”
Harry arrived at Mcgonagall's office right on time, Malfoy was already standing at the door, once he noticed Harry he pushed open the door, leaving it open for Harry to walk in after. Mcgonagall was sitting at her desk, she handed them both a sponge and a bucket. Harry made a disgusted face at the metal bucket sitting on the table.
“That’s the problem! You think you don’t deserve something so you ruin if for everyone else.” The other man tugged at his shirt sleeves, trying not to show to Draco that he was nervous.
This girl should’ve known by now that he was very obviously not interested in her, but Potter was way too nice to tell her to just piss off. Draco quickly shoved the bottles onto the shelf, attempting to run away as soon as he could so he didn’t have to hear this trainwreck of a conversation.
“He’s a death eater!” Harry shouted, exasperated. Malfoy shuffled in his chair, pulling at the material of his shirt; his face dropping to the floor. “Used to be” the boy next to him mumbled, he was avoiding looking at both Harry and McGonagall, resorting to playing with the rings on his fingers.
Before Harry could even realise, he was being pulled up a set of twisty staircases, he never knew how big Malfoy Manor actually was. They kept running through corridors, up more stairs, and then they finally stopped. In front of a door, Harry could still hear the music from even this far away.
“I have something I want us to do.” Draco stated, holding out his hand for Harry. The other boy smiled smugly, placing his hand onto Draco’s.
As soon as the train pulled into the station, Harry bolted. Needing fresh air as soon as he possibly could, he sprinted down the platform; apprarating straight to the doors of Hogwarts, feeling the bile rise in his throat, he leaned over the railing and vomited.
And he is, taller than Harry anyway, long legs look even longer stretched out in an onyx suit. His deathly pale skin is simply a stain on an inky canvas.
Ginny laughed and shook her head, she reached her hand up, stroking his face. “I’ve gotta go Harry, Luna’s waiting for me.” Harry nodded, staring at the floor. He heard Ginny's feet pattering away, he started walking towards the kitchen again, growing hungrier by the second.
Pansy was smiling wickedly, an idea clearly playing on the tip of her mind. Ron looked up from his textbook, looking glad to have a break from studying. Hermione didn’t even glance up for her parchment, ignoring Pansy and continuing to work. Pansy stood in the middle of the common room, clearing her throat.
“When do you start at the auror program?” Harry asked him, turning the heat down on the stove slightly, turning around to stand in between Draco’s knees. “Monday morning” Draco shrugged, resting his arms on the nape of Harry’s neck. He was nervous about starting in with the Aurors, it was a huge shock when an owl came saying he’d been accepted into the training program, an ex-death eater in the aurors? It was mental, but Draco couldn’t wait. “When do you start?” Harry blinked at him, exhaling, Draco raised an eyebrow.
Draco's hand around his bed frame fell down, pushing his pyjamas haphazardly off his hips, hitching his legs up. He shoved a finger into his mouth, reaching down and circling his entrance, pushing a long finger in. The feeling immediately encased him, letting out a deep moan. Draco moved his finger further in, and then out again, adding a second one in for good measure.
He knew he was about to get into a stew of trouble, the boy who lived came with a huge price, one that Draco was willing to pay. Harry was pure trouble.
The man had always been attractive, even during school, but Draco could never seem to get past the hero complex and unimaginable sass. There was always something about him that just had people dropping to their knees, and now Draco could understand why. Seeing Harry's fresh green eyes heavy and thick with desire was something he would never forget, holding that image in his brain for as long as he could.
A footstep in the hallway up ahead has Madam Pomfrey tugging Harry into an alcove, pulling a curtain. He squints at her, corners of his eyes crinkling.
“Well, my dads getting killed in two weeks, I ruined my entire life by simply being too much of a coward to stand up to him, my mums going insane because she’s not allowed to leave the house, half my family are dead and I depend on smoking to get through the day.” Malfoy concluded, leaning his head back to hit the cold stone behind them.
Their window was wide open, streaming in the early morning sun, early July heat filling the room. Draco could hear the birds chirping from outside, he sat down at the windowsill, sticking his arms outside and feeling the warmth hit his face. He looked down at his watch,
He wasn’t exactly sure why he thought of the library, he knew it was the only place where nobody would be; or think of going, a wicked smile appearing on his lips at the thought of the amount of
The short woman from earlier is sitting on the end of his bed, she is holding a stack of papers; a sharp frown hanging off the ends of her mouth.
Harry was confused but he wasn't going to ask why, he couldn't be bothered showing any interest in the other boy. He turned, beginning to sort out his trunk. A pale hand pulled something out of his open case before he could, Malfoy was stood there grabbing stuff out of his trunk; putting things in Harry's side of the room. "Touch any more of my stuff and i'll throw you out that fucking window." Malfoy dropped Harry's quill to the floor and walked over to the open window in their room, "What the hell are you doing Malfoy?"
“Are we going to do this?” Harry’s voice was hushed, Draco knew exactly what he meant. He placed a hand on Harry’s face.
The big grey house was a safe place for Draco when he was a child, but it was always tainted by darkness, evil was threaded through the walls, you could never rid yourself of the sick feeling it left in your stomach. All he wanted to do was get away from it, going to Grimmauld with the love of his life was exactly the fresh start he needed.
CW- Harry is going through it a little here, tiniest bit of internalised homophobia but nothing bad:)
He’d always been obsessed with Harry, he’d just confused it with admiration. Up until this year, Draco had wanted everything Potter had. Now Draco just wanted Potter.
He pulled his wand out of his pocket, moving Harry so he was underneath him. He buried his face in the other boy's bruised neck. Pointing his wand at the door.
“Potter! Potter, calm down, it's okay” Draco attempted but Potter was still heaving in front of him, his eyes glazed over and filled with unfocused tears. He wrapped his arms around Potter's neck, pulling him closer and holding on to the back of his head, letting him cry into his shoulder. “Shh Harry it’s okay, everything is going to be okay.” He stroked the other boy's hair, Potter’s hair was messy but it was surprisingly soft. He let himself bury his face on the top of his head, his hair smelt like citrus.
Hogwarts had always been Harry’s home, there was nowhere else on earth where he felt more comfortable and safe. He’d been through so much here, he was pretty much pegged for death from first year, but here was, still living, despite it all. And tomorrow was his last day.
Rons allegations were not ones he took lightly, and from the tone of his voice, they were not ones that had just come out of nowhere. They made him feel weird, if Ron thought he was secretly shagging Malfoy then Hermione did too, they probably talked about how strange and gross it was all time. Harry felt responsible for that, he didn’t exactly do anything that proved them wrong.
His second hand reached up to the metal railing of his headboard, clutching around It as his well-trained hand moved up and down his dick. Draco's eyes fell closed, the only thing on his mind was everything that was pouring out of Harry’s mouth last night.
He reached into his pocket, pulling out the letter opener that he always had on him, touching the tip of his fingers to the top; wincing, he knew it was sharp enough.
“Do I look bloody okay Potter? Please help me!” Malfoy strained, Harry pulled open the trap door properly before outstretching his hand for Malfoy to grab. “Take my hand!” He gave him a nauseated look, “I am not taking your hand potter!”
Delving too deep into something that you weren't meant to know can deceive you into thinking that you were meant to help that situation, when realistically; you just make it ten times worse.
He was staring at the ceiling, today was his last full day of school at Hogwarts, tomorrow would be graduation day, and then he was off; out into the big bag world. He glanced through his open bed hanging, Draco was still asleep in the bed next to him, his blonde hair messily sprawled over the green pillow case, the sheets tangled up around his legs. Harry threw his covers off, tiptoeing over to Draco’s bed, climbing in with him.
He knew exactly why Ron hated Malfoy so much, his friend had never had a direct argument with the blonde boy but Malfoy had made Hermione and Harry’s life a misery for years; and friendship was the most important thing in the world to Ron Weasley. He hated Draco Malfoy simply because Harry and Hermione did.
His theory was correct, he could hear Pansy and Blaise laughing from inside the shed, he pushed the door open, sitting down next to them. They were both smoking, he pulled out his metal case, and Blaise smirked. “Still have that then?” Draco chuckled, nodding, running the cool metal through his fingers; his rings clicking as he did so. He pulled a cigarette out the case, slipping it in between his lips and lighting with his wand like usual. “Me and ‘loverboy’ are moving in together.” He said casually, shrugging it off like it was nothing. “WHAT?!” His friends spluttered out, Pansy dropping her cigarette in the process. “Dray don’t you think it’s a bit early for that?” Blaise cautioned, Draco shook his head, “nah, we’ve technically already been living together for a year and he lives alone in this huge house.” He explained, taking another inhale from his cigarette, flicking the ash off the end.
But did he want to do that? He didn’t know, he’d only ever snogged a girl and he had certainly enjoyed that; so that can’t make him gay. Harry just brushed it off, he’d never kissed a boy and most likely never would so why was he taking Ron's claims to heart?
“I- um.” Harry starts, but it chokes in his throat. “I remember a bright light, and then a lot of pain, and then I woke up here.” The woman nods, edging closer to him cautiously. “And can you tell me anything about your life before the pain? Maybe something about your childhood?” She's less angry this time, comfort lacing her tongue.
Falling in love with Harry Potter came out of nowhere, but it was in no way a mistake. They didn’t talk about life before their eighth year, it wasn’t needed, so much more could be said in the unsaid. Everything about Harry was exactly what Draco needed, he fell for him hard, and was still falling.
Draco watched as Potter stormed out the room, slamming the door for good measure. He straightened out his jacket, swallowing the lump that had formed in his throat, he clenched his fists, feeling the anger rise up in his stomach. He grabbed his cloak that was hanging on his bedpost before marching out the room, headed for his favourite spot from all his years before.
He closed his eyes, reminiscing over the way flying felt, Draco could almost feel the wind in his face, the smell of the quidditch pitch and the cheers from everyone in Slytherin gave him the weirdest feeling of nostalgia;he missed his old life. His stomach churned at the thought of his life before the war, there’s so much he could’ve done, things he could’ve said that would have made everything different.
With Malfoy’s fingers beginning to slip, he gave in and grabbed Harry’s arm. He pulled Malfoy up through the opening; the other boys weight knocking them over, landing on top of Harry. Malfoy quickly scrambled off of him, lying down to stare at the ceiling. They both just lay there for a minute, breath heaving, chests rising up and down in tune with each other.
Harry had been through so much during his life, Hermione knew that what he was doing was the best decision Harry ever made. She smiled, glancing over to Ron. “I’m so happy for him, you know? He deserves this.”
Draco took Harry’s hand, standing up and wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist. He put his own arms around Draco’s neck, them both swaying in time with the music. They were pressed together this time, Harry’s head rested on Draco’s neck, breathing in the now familiar smell of Draco Malfoy.
He picked up the case, hauling it up under his arms, Draco went to leave the kitchen, but stopped in the doorway.
The biggest shock however, was Draco Malfoy leaning forward for his glass. Knocking it back, slamming it back down on the floor, aware of every one staring at him. “Who?” Hermione blurted, Harry eyed Draco, waiting to see his reaction. “I don’t think that’s any of your business Granger.” Draco sneered, sitting back against the sofa again. “Theodore.” He said quickly, the potion taking over, despite his resistance. Harry’s mouth fell open, his eyebrows raising.
“No” he lied, but did that game of truth or dare count? Well, yes considering he spent the next week after that snogging Theo Nott in the prefect's bathroom. And when it caught up to him, Draco kicked Theo’s teeth in to ensure he wouldn’t say anything.
things that even my own mother was angry at me for saying.” He stood up from the sofa, backing away to the door. “And lastly, I can’t be your friend because you saved the world, and i’m practically a monster.”
“What?!” Draco spluttered, dropping his cigarette out the window, his usual sneer returning to his face and his bratty fifteen year old self coming back, grimacing at Potter.
The red headed boy can tell Harry is starting to panic, he shoots up from the sofa adjacent to him, kneeling down and placing his hands on his knees. He's close to him now, super close, and he smells like cinnamon and fresh laundry detergent, which shoots another distant memory down his spine. Harry closes his eyes in an instant, and the memory is gone. The boy takes out a wallet from his back pocket, he opens it and hands it to Harry.
