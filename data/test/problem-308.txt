Harry: "Promises… promises. Silencio!"
Ginny: I’m gay. Don’t take everything so personally.
Harry: I’m HIGH KEY not a club person, Draco.
Ginny: Hahaha I’d like to see you try, Finnigan!
Prongs: Ha Ha. Grab something and go into the third men’s fitting room. Your present is waiting.
Ginny: The only person worth talking to… or the only person you talked to.
Harry: Figured that one out for myself, thanks.
Arthur: Yes, I still have the scar to remind me.
Draco: Excuse me?
“Please stop,” Harry said, exhausted. Malfoy did, if only in challenge. “I don’t want to fight, alright? I just…” What did he want to do?
Prongs: : )
Harry: "FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK!"
Greenviper: That’s painfully adorable.
Get it from the Hufflepuff. I don’t trust your friends.
Harry: No. Never. I was talking about Hermione.
Greenviper: It’s a family name. At any rate, who wants to be common?
Harry: Ok, what the hell? We had a great night why are you suddenly pissed at me?
Prongs: Even you can’t think of an eloquent thing to say. I’ll consider that a personal victory.
Right, well nice talking to you I guess.
Prongs: But I’m a keeper ;)
Hermione: He’s gagging in person.
Harry: Guess who was skulking around Godric’s Hollow?
Greenviper: I don’t know… hate sex wouldn’t be nearly as fun.
Hermione: Oh yes!
Hermione: Ron!
Theo: Tsk tsk, Draco, secrets do not a good relationship make. Still, I think I’ll bow out here gracefully. Give my regrets to the Hero.
Theo: OK…
Harry: What? You’re mad. TOTALLY OFF YOUR TROLLEY!
Prongs: The things we talked about on Howlr… is that really you or were you just saying things you thought I wanted to hear?
Pansy Parkinson has managed to cultivate a good life for herself after the war. She has a job she loves, friends she’d kill for and Howlr to keep her bed warm at night. She has everything she’s ever wanted except – Weasley. And she wants Weasley, even if it means a giant ginger bludger is heading toward her perfect life.
Prongs: Processing.
Draco: Calm down, Blaise wouldn’t hurt a Hufflepuff.
Greenviper: Don’t ruin this.
Neville: Do not be embarrassed, Harry. We all have bad weeks! Remember when I was practically living in the Janice thickly ward.
Hermione: Ok, I did some snooping. They seem really happy. They’re showing off pictures of their prize-winning Crup.
Prongs: A cute Slytherin boy by my side…
Prongs:  And if things were reversed?
“Because,” Draco said, exasperated, “I have everything to lose!” Harry opened his mouth to protest but Draco continued on. “You already know where I am in this. It’s up to you, now, to figure out where you stand.” Harry let out a disbelieving breath.
Come on, I’m not tricking you. Trust me.
Greenviper: That’s what you get for thinking about other men.
Hermione: "Ms. Granger"
Ginny: Did Mum really throw Ron’s spellular out the window?
Teddy: “But Cousin Draco – “
Harry: "Yes, Ma’am."
Am I what?
Harry: Oh shit… I think she sees us.
Hermione: Ronald.
Harry: I will think on it, yes.
Prongs: Sry
Greenviper: I’m going to do you a favor and pretend you were joking.
“Daad,” Teddy called in a sleepy voice. There was no mistaking that. Draco leapt off Harry’s lap, practically flying off the bed. It would have been funny if the situation wasn’t so – not.
Harry: Then don’t wreck this. Support me. Let me be happy, you TOSSER!
Greenviper: Christ, you didn’t follow me here did you?
Draco: Then be a good boy, Potter, and do as you’re told.
“Well which one is it?” Harry said, raggedly “Do you want me to count or shut my mouth?” Draco laughed then too and Harry’s heart swelled with pride.
Draco: She hates me. I had to do something.
Ginny: Hey, remember that time we literally rocked your socks off. We were in a rush so you left them on, yeah. But then you got hot half way through and decided to take them off but your feet smelled so bloody RANK! HAHAHAHA
Harry: "Huh?"
Greenviper: What if I promised to help you return the favor at some point.
Dean: That’s what I said. : )
Me – What’s that?
Answer me!
Greenviper: Same.
Harry: Why not? It’s true. One day, Hermione, you’re going to face the fact that when you get home from work you and Ron have each other. You don’t have to go to the store alone, or cook alone or eat dinner alone. There’s no cooling off after a fight because you’re stuck in the same house and you just have to deal with each other. That’s family!
Harry: Gin, I will never love anyone the way I love you. You were there for me at a time when I couldn’t stand to be in the same room as myself, much less anyone else. I let YOU in, not Ron, not Hermione, certainly not Draco – you. And it wasn’t because you were my girlfriend because I didn’t really let you be that then. It was because you were the only person who understood how lonely and empty it felt to finally have him out of my head and how fucked up it was that I almost missed it. That foundation of brutally naked honesty has made our relationship grow into something so special. I don’t ever feel the need to hide anything from you and I never feel even the tiniest bit of shame in the things I share. Not many people have that with anyone in their life, Gin.
Draco: "Ah, there’s a good lad."
Prongs: Give me a second to organize my thoughts.
Draco:  Where the hell are you?
He turned Harry’s head toward him again and placed a torturing kiss over Harry’s stretched upper lip. Then Draco sunk to his knees. Harry shook with want and anticipation. He couldn’t possibly be – there was no way Harry would last if he –
Ron: Nope. I’m out!
?” Harry flinched, again, at her tone.
Patientpuff: Then you’d fuck me till I bleed, Grandpa
Harry: I’ll do it when they’re both over tomorrow. Hermione has way more pull than me.
Lavender: "How have you been since last week’s ... well, you know."
Harry: "Look, I just called to make sure everything was set on your end for the catering tomorrow."
In light of your recent engagement, Harry James Potter is officially kicking, best friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger out of his flat.
Harry: "You don’t sound anything like you do in my head."
Harry: "Ginny! I
Prongs: :) Don’t be jealous, Diddums. I’m gay.
Hermione: Absolutely.
Draco: "I am touching you."
I’m hard right now just thinking about you.  I get hard thinking about you a lot if I’m honest. About how I want to kiss that smart mouth of yours until it’s raw. Maybe slap you around a bit…I hope you’re still not touching your cock.
Harry: Not to be dramatic but if I walk into this pub and 30 people shout ‘HAPPY BIRTHDAY’ at me then I’m going back in time and choosing death.
Harry rolled his eyes at Hermione’s last message and made his way into the restaurant, heart beating rapidly against his chest. Breathe, he coached himself, the walk to the hostess stand feeling comically reminiscent to the one he took to his death.
Harry: We’re just putting the finishing touches on your card. Be there in a bit!
Harry: "Sure! Just don’t tell Pansy I let you eat deep fried cheese."
Ginny: I’m coming to Draco’s.
Harry: I am going to be single-handedly responsible for the downfall of Hogwarts.
“I like both,” Teddy said, diplomatically. Godric bless that child.
Harry: Footjob?
Harry: I’m going to ignore your virtual tone in exchange for an actual favor.
Draco: You’re late.
Harry: You are SUCH a Slytherin.
Draco: I’ll be good.
Greenviper: You know what I’m getting at.
Ron: ‘Ha. Not a chance in hell but I bet my fiancé does!’
I don’t want to meet.
Harry: "Oh my god, I did not mean it like that."
Draco looped his fingers in Harry’s belt loops and jerked his hips against his own. “You want to fuck me, Potter?” he said on a breath at Harry’s ear. A shiver ran down the length of Harry’s body.
Never mind. I don’t care. Put on some trousers, I’m coming through the Floo.
put it in."
Greenviper: Talk to me more about it.
Prongs: Something like that?
Ginny: Teddy went back to Andromeda.
Prongs: I couldn’t stay mad at you, Darling!
Harry: "Bye."
Unknown: It’s Pansy, you absolute dolt! Is Ginevra there?
Greenviper: Wouldn’t you like to know.
Harry: Handjob?
Greenviper: First of all, bite your filthy tongue. I could care less about the boy hero. It’s just a saying. Don’t get your wand in a twist. It means you were at Hogwarts at the same time as him. I’m not a huge fan of the system but everyone on here uses it. You must be new.
Ginny: My brain only goes in one direction. You know this.
[photo unavailable]
Greenviper: Would you rather be stuck on a desert island with Morcott for a year or live the rest of your life without magic?
Hermione: You don’t think he’ll be so cross he’ll say ‘no’, do you?
Draco: “You haven’t looked into your closet since - how did you get dressed this morning? Never mind. I hung one sky blue and one tan lounge suit on the inside of your closet door. Wear the blue one to brunch.”
Prongs: Right.
Harry: Of course…
Greenviper: You’re good at this.
Greenviper: I didn’t know what to think, that’s why I asked.
Ginny: Hush you.
But do know this, if you ever ask me to call you ‘Sir’ in person, you’ll find yourself extremely disappointed.
“I’d be impressed, if I wasn’t so pissed off. I mean,” Draco laughed, a cold, bitter laugh, “where did you find the time?”
Ginny: Fuck off.
, he was kissing Malfoy and Malfoy was kissing back.
Greenviper: Haha Salazar, could you imagine?
Hermione: Supposedly.
Prongs: I don’t know. I need some time.
McGonagall: "Now, I’m just calling to check in. Neville has informed me you have agreed to take his place in handling the last minute arrangements for this Friday."
Harry: :)
Greenviper: And you wanted to meet in person. What was it you said, ‘It won’t be an issue.’
Ginny: It shouldn’t take a Ministry ceiled piece of parchment to validate my relationship in the eyes of my family. I say I love her, that should damn well be enough. Percy’s only been dating Audrey for five months and she already gets invited to family dinner.
Ginny: That’s my boy!
So, it's over? Yeah, that's the end! I hope you enjoyed it! It has been a sheer joy to write and work on with Syn! Please don't be shy, I want to know what you thought about the final chapter or the fic as a whole. Over conversations has easily been the best part about Howlr.
Draco: You should be.
SheSnake: Oooh, Pansy is it?
Prongs: Fuck. Ouch.
Harry: "Fuu – Mmm, yes! Keep narrating what you’re doing. I like hearing you say it."
Harry: Course she has.
Boom* Mind. Blown.
Neville: My bad.
Greenviper: You like it.
Greenviper: You are a complete dunderhead, so much so that I worry it might be contagious. I do not say ‘I like you back’ because I am not a randy fourth year trying to score a lush date to the Yule Ball.
“God Da’,” Harry adjusted for what must have been the thousandth time that day. It was a phase the young metamorph was going through in which he ardently refused to call Harry anything but Dad. It broke Harry’s heart a little each time he had to correct him.
Prongs: You don’t say.
Prongs: That’s the one.
Harry: Go get her, Fitbottom!
Harry: Yup. Janus Thickey’s is looking more like home by the second.
Pansy: There are certain few wizards that can pull this off.
Ron: Bloody hell, not the letters again.
Prongs: Stop sulking.
Greenviper: You’re an idiot.
Draco: How fortunate it is to be loved.
Greenviper: You know your mythos.
Ginny: Revolutionary, I know. Where do I come up with this stuff.
Ginny: Potter, stop texting my girlfriend. She is otherwise occupied.
Ginny: *Clears throat* ‘Viktor, I love you. Viktor, I do. When we’re apart my heart beats only for you!’
Ron: I don’t TELL Hermione anything because I want to one day have the option of having children.
Harry: …Ok
Ron: Yeah mate, it was great. Friendly suggestion though BIGGER PORTIONS. Throw in a carb or two.
Harry: I’m supposed to have a date tonight but it’s with a person that’s all wrong for me. I’ve been talking to him for a while now but we’re complete opposites. We haven’t even been on a proper date yet and we already fight all the time.
Harry: I just don’t feel like sitting at another pointless staff meeting. I’m sure you’ll get on without me.
Ginny: Dark.
Harry: *Groggily* ‘Ron?’
Harry: "For starters, my foot won’t stop shaking and my heart’s racing and my face is red."
Harry: *Clap hands * You. Are. Bi. *Clap hands * You enjoy sex with men!
Draco: I’ll be on my best behavior, Daddy, don’t worry.
Harry: My breath sure is bated.
Harry: Merlin, that’s so creepy. Even over text I can tell you’re pulling ‘the face.’
Draco’s body was flush against his for the first time and Harry had the absurd impulse to cry. They’d been through so much. They’d come so far. Draco must have been feeling it too because he pecked Harry on the back of his neck and whispered something that sounded suspiciously like ‘I love you.’
Damn it, Potter! ANSWER ME!
Syn, you are my light, my gift, my beta and I adore you!
Greenviper: Haha trust me, you REALLY don’t need to be.
Draco: Dimwit. I’m not even sure I want to eat with you after what you said earlier.
Screenname: TheRealGing
Harry: "OH oh oh God!! Yes!"
Harry: Geta room!
Greenviper: Oh, I am.
Harry: Which I agree with wholeheartedly, Hermione. Now, going on about how ‘ridiculous’ it would be to get married so he wouldn’t beat you to it is, however, devious.
Ginny: Hey, Malfoy told Pansy you really rocked his socks off last night ;)
Prongs: Well-timed bodily functions? Aren’t they just.
Greenviper: Are you busy this evening?
“Not only are you rude,” Harry stated, emphatically, “but you’re wrong. I get my best recipes from restaurant menus and I rarley make the same thing twice, so I’m pretty much an expert at ordering at this point.”
Ron: Whatever. Do you reckon he’s in our year?
SheSnake: Was that your crack at a threat, Potter?
Harry: Shut up.
Harry: Why don’t you just give it until the end of the week. If things are still strange, we can begin to formulate a plan to win her back!
Greenviper: I do know a very famous person and he’s an arsehole. So, I’d probably say ‘Hey, arsehole.’
Step three, Howlr – download app
Ron: Hey, have her come here. You can make us all breakfast!
Ginny: "What the queen doesn’t know won’t hurt me."
Ron: LMFAO *slow clap* *THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE*
Hermione: He said yes!
Ginny: YES.
Harry: Letters?
Prongs: Who is Collins? And, more importantly, does that mean you’re saying ‘yes?’
Harry: Why are you deliberately sabotaging things with Draco? You know how important this is to me.
Harry: Please don’t let it. The only thing you need to worry about is your recovery.
“Tell me, Potter,’ Malfoy inquired, “would you have continued our correspondence if I had told you who I was then?” The hard line that made up Malfoy’s jaw quivered at the end of the question.
Prongs: I told you, Hydra, we’re fine. I’d rather just leave it, ok?
Ron: Hey Harry, we’re all meeting at 3 brooms tomorrow night to celebrate your Birthday! The theme is muggles!! Kiss kiss, see you there. Bye!
Hermione: That is a totally natural response to have when the child you help raise says that, Harry. You should not feel guilty.
Prongs: Hey. I am not the bad guy here.
Ginny: You keep saying that. What THE FUCK do you mean?
Cho: “Will that be Carry out or Delivery, Sir?”
“Piss off,” Harry said, a sudden rage overcoming him.
Neville: I accidentally made bodily contact with Immobile Mushrooms and now I’m paralyzed from the nipples down.
“Love you, Ted!” Harry called back. He shook his head as he watched them leave the room. He ran his hands through his tangled, morning bird’s nest, wondering what demon had possessed Ginny Weasley and which method was best to exorcise it.
Harry: No. He’s too old. He doesn’t even know they make those.
Draco: “Pardon?”
Greenviper: Know what?
“Weasley’s trained you well,” he said, to which Teddy nodded, “Uh huh.”
Hermione: Nowhere! I can still pinch those rosy cheeks.
Prongs: I’m game. Meet me in men’s washroom in 5.
Ron: Our hero vanquished by libido.
Greenviper: I’m already regretting this.
Prongs: Where did you come from?
Prongs: Why Hydra?
Ginny: Are you going to put it on a pillow, cuddle with it at night? Let it remind you of a better time?
Prongs: LOL!!! And you called me kinky?
Draco: Yeah, he does good work.
Prongs: Except, you know, your identity.
Ron: This is not for the eyes of babes.
Harry: “Yes. And I have a coupon that says – “
Draco: Use your words, you msg like a pubescent muggle with a non-existent intelligence quotient.
Harry: Either way, Hydra isn’t bi. He was pretty adamant about only being attracted to wizards.
Draco: Rough around the edges? There is someone’s dirty sock hanging across an exposed pipe above my head, Potter.
Greenviper: Hmm…Everyone deserves love, I guess.
McGonagall: I’m sure you have no short of confidences. My advice would be too seek out one of them. Ms. Granger in particular.
Teddy sang, “You’re the only reason I keep on coming,” then Harry, “you’re the only reason I keep on coming,” then twice together, “you’re the only reason I keep on coming home.”
Harry: No judgement on this end.
Prongs: Is it working?
Harry: "Ta. Later."
Harry: I don’t know, Dean, is he going to punch me in the face again?
Draco: “So I’ve been told.”
Greenviper: Clearly.
Greenviper: I’ve nothing against them, on principle, but relationships are meant to be about candor and trust. With the Magical Statute of Secrecy, it makes that impossible. I’m aware many couples have done it in the past but being a wizard is a huge part of who I am, it’s a part of everything I do. It is unlikely that anyone could understand or connect with the real me without it.
Ron: It’s like she’s trying to get me out of her system or distract me or something, but I’m vigilant. She’s figured it out, Harry. She knows I’m not good enough for her.
“She knew it was you remember!” Harry spat back. Malfoy gave him a lip-curling, scornful smile.
Harry: The foundation of all great relationships? I could never.
Hermione: Please don’t use that term. And anyway, I’ve been doing some thinking and I think it’s clear Hydra is Malfoy.
As if he couldn’t help himself Draco pulled one of Harry’s balls into his mouth, suckled on it, then moved on to the other with a ‘pop.’ Harry fought to breathe, desperately trying to coax his body down from the brink, to make this last.
Harry slid further up the counter, trying to ground himself for each blow, wrists almost as sore as his arse with the constant back and forth.  But it was worth it to feel that exquisite sting, the excruciating anticipation of the next time it was to come; worth it for his cock to be red, rock hard and leaking onto his cabinets.
Hermione:
Prongs: Sure.
Theo: Don’t be sorry! I have a new business deal in the works, this will do wonders for my reputation.
Ginny: Good book. Very scary.
Draco’s vocal cords emitted a high-pitched whimper, “You should see how you look,” Harry heard him swallow, “Potter, you’ll be the death of me.”
Neville: So it’s ridiculous that we’re actually doing this right?
Draco: “Well, you rushed me.”
When he was one he saved world, at fourteen he battled a dragon and at twenty two Harry Potter was about to denounce Godric and run away from his problems. He could buy a Crup and commit to a life of abstinence. He could live vicariously through characters in books, where each complication had a desired degree of separation from his own life. He could even convince himself that that wasn’t as pathetic as it sounded in his head, what he couldn’t do, however, was live with not knowing. The past couple months, Theo had given Harry a glimpse of what his life could be; to have a partner to joke, fight and grow with and all Harry had ever wanted was a family. So, as barmy as it was, he stood outside The Sinclair, doubt turning to sweat at his temples, and confident in nothing but the fit of his jacket.
Teddy – “Put on your robes, it’s time for a Handsome party!”
Harry: Where did the time go?
Prongs:  Are you in a relationship or something? Are you married?
Harry: Hey!
Arthur: Might I suggest not dating a Death Eater.
Prongs: NOPE!
I'm so sorry it has taken me so long to update! I know some of you saw my message on Tumblr but if you didn't, I'm an actor and recently had a show open so that was the cause of my brief hiatus. I'm back now and so ready to share this chapter with you (especially since my poor ass has to finish this fic before I don't have internet....)! Thank you for your continued love and support, I really really appreciate it!
Harry: "Christ! Mhm…So everything you’re doing to me; you’re also doing to yourself."
In other news, I'm looking for cover art for this fic. I have none of the necessary skills, so if you're interested in helping me out hit me up on Tumblr (http://partialtopotter.tumblr.com/). If you're not interested and just want to talk to me also hit me up on tumblr, I'm always in search of more HP friends!
Harry: I think I’m going to go talk to Nott in person.
“I forced Pansy to confirm it when she and the Weaselette found your profile, but I’ve known since you sent me the books.”
Greenviper: Why in the name of magic…
Prongs: Tell that story to children, do you?
Harry: Ron. If you are truly grateful, we will NEVER speak of this evening again.
until Harry ‘wanted Draco.’ Draco smirked. “I made an educated guess.” Merlin, his mouth.
Harry: "Sweet dreams, Hydra."
Andromeda: Mind that sass. You know how I feel about it.

Harry: I know! I’m sorry, I had to drop my godson off at his Gran’s. I’m on my way.
Greenviper: Not a chance in Knockturn, Prongs.
Ginny: Guess it’s settled then. Harry likes me best.
Prongs: You started it.
Ginny: What?
Cho: *Mumbling* “What a surprise.”
Prongs: Deal! The kid’s telling me to stop texting anyway.
Harry hadn’t dared chance a look at Draco while he was singing but now that it was Teddy’s turn, he couldn’t help himself. Draco was still, lips slightly parted, cheeks flushed and eyes looking down on Teddy with pure, unguarded affection. Then he turned that look to Harry and let it stay there. Harry forgot to breathe, forgot nearly everything that wasn’t the grey swirls in Draco’s eyes, he would have forgotten he was alive too if it weren’t for his heart beating twice it’s normal speed.
Harry: Hey, does Pansy let you bring those into the flat?
Ginny: When’s the wedding?
is that?"
Prongs: Christ!
Prongs: Like what? Sympathizing with death eaters?
“You’re mine.“ And then Draco was coming too. Harry felt his come deep within, his spent cock making a valiant, yet feeble, attempt to jerk back to life.
Draco: You fucked me like you wanted to get me out of your system. Like it wasn’t going to happen again.
Ron: Didn’t Nott go to Azkaban?
Harry: RIP
Harry: Texting in the middle of them is better?
SheSnake: I’m shaking in my Balenciaga’s.
Draco: “I love you too.”
Harry: Welp, it’s always nice talking to you…
Prongs: Wow. That’s so exciting! Can we do it now?
Harry: Idk yet. Feels like, probably.
Greenviper: … Anyway, I have a present for you.
Harry: I’m assuming that’s a ‘yes’ and am moving on.
Harry: Fucking hell! You’re going to miss the ball!
Is your godson ok?
Teddy – “My hair’s pink Harry, you know what that means!”
Harry: How long does it last?
Harry: So you say. Oh and what the fuck is up with this potterera shit?
Greenviper: Hurried and rough.
Thank you to my Beta and friend, synonym4life!!! Readers, she's just the best! I am at all times impressed by and in debt to her and her brilliance.
Ginny: There’s nothing I can say that I haven’t already said. Howlr’s great! The queer wizarding populous is dreadfully low and still very shy. With the app, at least you know, yeah? And you’re always talking about how you wish someone could get to know you for you without the whole ‘I saved the whole bloody world’ thing getting in your way. Closet cases do Howlr anonymously all the time.
Dean: Be my guest.
Ginny: lol It was bound to happen to one of us eventually.
Yes, yes I want to know.
Harry: Hahaha that’s the best one yet. Save it for me, will you?
Harry: I’d say your actual daddy issues have at least a little to do with it…but yeah, sure, blame who you need to.
“God Da’” Harry and Draco corrected that the same time. Teddy fixed Draco with a stern look that was all Andromeda.
Greenviper: I try.
Harry: Yeah, I seem to remember you enjoying yourself… 3 times.
Greenviper: Don’t pretend this is the first time you’ve noticed.
Harry: "Fuck! I don’t know what’s hotter, feeling the sucking in my mouth
Draco: “Ramora roe and truffle oil.”
“Draco, did we have plans?” Harry looked nervously over his shoulder, down the hall to his bedroom. He squinted, was that Teddy or a skived off pile of laundry? Definitely laundry!  How long had it been since his last eye exam? Too long, probably.
Ginny: You’re Welcome! The team gets broom prototypes all the time so it really wasn’t that big of a deal.
Greenviper: Never. Again.
Greenviper: You’re worried about me? How… quaint.
Harry: ‘You were scared.’
Draco: "No, no, dearest, that’s not how this game is played.
Harry: "You did!"
Harry: Are you, perhaps, upset about something, Draco?
Greenviper: HAHA how pissed are you?
Harry: "I’ve been like this since you walked in the door."
Ginny: *Cough* loser *cough*
Hi friends and readers! I hope you're still out there, it's been a long fucking time! I won't offer excuses or apologize for my long absence because I've come to realize that taking the time off was what was best for me and the fic. I will, however, offer you an explanation. If you aren't interested in my life (fair) please read the warning and skip right to the chapter.
Neville: You don’t need to plan it. It’s already planned. You just have to manage and make sure everything’s in place on time. I will be here to help via Spellular in any way I can.
Greenviper: Why are people buying you shots, Prongs?
Harry: "Fuck yesss!"
Greenviper:  Already in past tense, I see.
Draco: "No. It’s just late."
Harry: "You’re my hero!"
Draco: I could be persuaded to move some things around.  What did you have in mind?
Harry: ‘And what does she get in the deal? A yearly jumper and some dad jokes?’
“Dudley’s lyrics aren’t near so creative,” he protested. Draco moved from Harry’s ear to his neck, pressing what felt like – oh god – his hard length against Harry’s backside.
Greenviper: No one wants to carry a new Armani around Mayfair, Prongs.
Photo (3)
Harry: CHRIST Neville! What the hell? Do I want to know why it’s nipples down?
Prongs: Just yesterday you were going on about how much you fancied me. Mind telling me what happened between now and then to make you act like a total prat!
“You’re funny!” Teddy proclaimed, mood changing with the air in room. “Can he stay for dinner?” Teddy asked Harry.
Ron: Right you are, Harry. Right. You. Are!
Ron: I’m away from my Spellular for five minutes and I come back to this shit!
Prongs: Did you kill anyone?
So you’re good with kids, then?
Harry: Draco, I really appreciate the effort you’re putting in but I think it’s just going to take time.
Harry: I set my Spellular to mind message.
Draco: I think it’s pointless to not let Teddy call you ‘Dad.’ I know that when you read this in my voice that it appears judgmental, but that’s not case. I completely understand why the prefix is important to you, however, Teddy doesn’t have the same sentimentality about honoring the memory of Professor Lupin that you do. He’s just a little boy being raised, superbly, I might add, by his hero. He wants someone to call ‘Dad,’ I know you can relate to that. The title means a lot more to him than it does to Professor Lupin at this point. And in any case, last time I checked, a kid was allowed more than one Dad.
Hermione: Merlin help me, so much!
Harry: “Dragons don’t know how to eat toads. Fact!”
Teddy: "IT’S SOOO COOL! They’re all named Mac and they live on marshmallow mountain."
“And you didn’t?” Draco questioned. Harry reared back, breathe caught at his chest.
Draco: "Prongs?"
Harry: No we’re not. I have Teddy.
Cho: “Great.”
Ginny: Poor dear. You should send him one…YOU have two! ; )
Prongs: Inside joke.
Draco: “Splendid.”
Tomorrow I drop him off at 8:30 before Auror Training and pick him up at 6:00.
Neville: Well…Since I can’t move, you have to take my place as head of the party planning committee and finish the last minute preparations for the ball.
Harry: “Yes, I would like a house salad, a small cheese pizza and a large – Draco, what toppings do you like on your Pizza?”
“I don’t really know how to play,” Harry said, deciding to pointedly ignore the state of the room.  “I only learned it because Teddy – “
Pickled
Arthur: You know you have an open invitation. You can always bring anyone you’d like.
Ron: Or worse… SHE’LL NEVER WEAR THEM AGAIN!
McGonagall: "I needn’t tell you how important it is for the school that this go well."
He found that what Pansy Parkinson lacked in kindness and generosity, she made up for in results and adeptness with hair-care potions. By the time Harry was ready to leave for his date, his hair, defying all logic and past performance, managed to hold some shape and the jacket she selected was currently giving his firebolt a run for its money for his most prized possession. It was made with the softest lining Harry had ever felt and he had to keep cautioning himself not to ask Pansy for the price of his comfort.
Anyone who’s interested, message me by replying to this question: ‘If you ever met a very famous person, what would you say to them?’
Neville: The grand prize for the raffle fell through. And we need to secure a replacement as soon as possible.
Ginny: This is the happiest relationship I’ve ever been in. This is the happiest I’ve ever been. period.
Prongs: Living my life…I know this might be hard for a narcissist like yourself to grasp, but the world does keep spinning even if you’re not at the center of it.
“You think
Harry: Kittens?
Greenviper: Don’t insult my intelligence.
“I’ll do that.”
I mourn the loss of that arse each day. I will never have an arse as perfect as yours again. You’ve ruined me for all other bums!
Hermione: I hate this bit.
Harry: HAHAHAHA
Pansy: Got it.
Ron: Not likely. You broke his heart.
Harry: Now, we both know that’s not true. According to Nott, I’m EXACTLY your type!
Prongs: Haha I guess
Harry: Just for the record, I never doubted you would make it in quidditch.
Hermione: Top of the list of things that aren’t funny.
Harry: I won’t soon forget.
Prongs: I did grow up in the muggle world but my family is super homophobic. I only know so much about the queer community because one of my best friends, who’s brilliant by the way, bought me a shit ton of muggle literature about it when I first came out. So I’m a total hypocrite, ok?
Greenviper: If there’s a women married to you at the other end of said kid, we have a problem.
Greenviper: Not yet.
Harry shot him a knowing smile back, mentally preparing himself for whatever way Draco chose to respond. He hoped it’d be wicked. Harry wanted to push Draco, so that, in turn, he would push Harry back. Because when you got down to the crux of it, that’s what they’d always wanted. They’d simply been two stubborn boys revving for a challenge. It wasn’t until later that they discovered a challenge could take many different forms.
Prongs: I’d rather not, if it’s all the same. I prefer my mini appetizers to remain in my stomach.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry: You’re a cruel witch.
Teddy: *Giggling*
Greenviper: Why should I? We haven’t made any promises to each other. This was an uncomfortable error on my part, however, I apologize.
Audible swallow*
Greenviper: Of course not.
Harry, for all his planned misbehavior, melted into it. He pressed himself further against Draco and rolled his arse against him, reaching back with his right arm to a get ahold of Draco’s neck. He let his tongue glide against the other man’s, let the arousal coiled in his center release itself into the kiss.
Draco: "I assume you only have beer. Instead, you bring out a dusty bottle of Ogden’s with a ridiculous grin on your face. You’re very proud of yourself."
Harry: … Yes?
Hermione: I’m glad you like them! I think they’re the only books you’ve read that I’ve given you these past eleven years.
Guys, why is he so red?
Hermione: *Copy and pastes to chat* I apologize for his lack of tact. We’re working on it.
“I stole a copy from my file. I’d recognize the writing anywhere.”
Millicent: "Why are you calling me, Potter? I told you, I wasn’t interested."
“I don’t hear you counting?” Another blow.
Harry: “Sure.”
“Now, if you ever want to stop what we’re doing, curl your hands into a fists and bang them on the counter.” His voice was serious. “Do it so I know you understand.” Harry complied immediately, touched because even in the heat of their play Draco was so careful. He cared.  “Good.”
Ginny: Be sure to let us know how soon she brings out the wedding album.
Draco: "I run the slicked fingers over your chest, leaving light kisses on your arms along the way."
Harry: That might be late.
Are you, Ginny Weasley, implying you need male anatomy for a satisfying sexual experience?
Harry: Shit.
Ron: …Uhh, I think you mean the best. We did save the world.
Prongs: I have a present for you.
Greenviper: What’s wrong, Prongs? They’re already a threesome. They were practically made for this game.
Prongs: Now I’m jealous.
Prongs: Can I watch? ;) jkjk
Harry: Right! You can’t go to back to Hogwarts without riding the HOGWARTS Express. Period.
Pansy: Every Crup has its day, Potter.
Ginny: You’re a 3
Harry: Get it?!? I have so many that I don’t need to use my hand?!?
Prongs: Yes?
SheSnake: I need your floo address to collect my gf.
Harry: Exactly! And sorry.
Harry: Cruel.
Harry: ‘Are you crying?’
Ginny: Oh My Fucking GOD! I am running out of creative ways to explain this to people! I’ll break it down for you, even though it’s not anyone’s business but mine and Harry’s. Something wasn’t right between us. Everything was ‘supposed to be’ and never quite was. We were supposed to be perfect. I was supposed to be the hero’s trophy. Sex was great but it was supposed to be passionate. Harry was supposed to be my PREFERRED GENDER but that wasn’t in the fucking stars, OK? Aren’t you supposed to be the clever one?
Greenviper: Unfortunately
Ron: I’ll go get him. You two will make him talk. Right now all he needs is a hug and to come home.
Prongs: I’m glad you think so.
Greenviper: For the record, I’m not a stalker, however, I noticed you haven’t even logged onto the app in three days. Are you OK?
From your wit to your humor,
Prongs: I’m in line for the loo. I actually had to go.
Harry: Knowledge from the school of Teddy – “Healers can’t fix brooms. Fact!”
“Why,” Malfoy asked.
Harry: "No, Millicent. Neville just didn’t tell me – "
Draco: And you’re not angry?
Harry: Also true.
Greenviper: So I’ve heard.
Prongs: I’m not kidding. Get out of there.
Harry: Mushrooms are my new sworn enemy. I WILL VANQUISH THEM ALL!
Draco: Thursday is Magic Night, they have wizarding drinks and Veela dancers. It’s the only night to go! Besides, I just bought a new outfit. You don’t have work tomorrow, correct?
Draco: “Harry.”
“Oh. My. God.” The instrument glided smoothly into Harry’s hand.
Greenviper: Ok.
Hermione: Enough.
Draco: Potter.
Prongs:  [click to download photo]
Where are you going?
Greenviper: First day, huh? And already you’re talking to me. How auspicious for you.
Greenviper: He gets that mouth from you.
Greenviper: I’m not joking, Prongs. I’m not proud of it, but it’s true.
Prongs: But you didn’t ask permission
Pansy: Vodka or Whiskey?
Prongs: Crisis averted.  I really am sorry about ruining your plans for tonight.
Neville: Oh god, we’re fired aren’t we?
Harry wanted to be irritated - he had a plan to give Draco a piece of his mind but was much too distracted by the way the other man peered, patiently at Teddy. Was far too swept away by the flurry it caused in his chest and the onslaught of want it triggered in other places.
Ron: Smh
Harry: Aw man, the ice is my favorite part.
Ginny: I know you were just joking but the Pansy/Ginny break-up bit is really starting to get to me.
Prongs: Oh. LOL no! He and his boyfriend were only on a break at the time. He was not pleased when he found out we hooked up.
Ginny: Touché.
Harry: Sorry.
Neville: Show me the lie.
Harry: I’m on my way.
Harry: You should be. I’m terrifying. Like a Horntail.
Harry: How thoughtful of you.
Harry: I’m already home.
Harry: "Why does he keep calling you that?”
Greenviper: Don’t be a prude, Prongs. If they’re anything like you, I bet it was positively ribald.
“Alright over there?” Harry smirked, waving in Draco’s direction. Another nod.
Harry: What have you done now?
Pansy: I didn’t do it for you. I swear, Potter, if you hurt him I will set Blaise on you and, trust me, the poison apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.
Draco: Miss me already?
texted,” Draco segued, the mischievous look on his face transfiguring the mood of the room, “then I’d probably miss the chance to see you walking about your house in nothing but your joggers.” Draco looked Harry up and down, pausing, lip wedged between his teeth, to admire Harry’s firm abdomen. “A true loss, I assure you.”
If there’s anything I can do… you can tell me.
Ron: How long you think before Kingsley loses it?
Draco: “Am I not?”
Ron: WHAT?! On what planet is that clear?
know him and the careful thought put into the location was a testament to that.
Harry: What’s up with Teddy’s room?
Harry: Your boyfriend just challenged me to a duel.
Harry: “I didn’t want Hydra to be you because if he were you, I’d be done for. I had feelings for you so tucked away I … I had to separate it because if you were human, I mean if you weren’t Malfoy… I could always hold on to the fact that we would never work together, would never be a normal couple. I accepted that. You could be a fruitless infatuation. But if I could laugh, tease, banter, open up to
Greenviper: Yes, I have one of those. You do too, you might have noticed.
Draco: "I pull out my fingers, watching your hole pulse for me. Your pucker’s practically begging for my cock."
Harry placed his hands on the counter with far more care than the task required and bent himself horizontal, curving his back. He pushed himself against Draco’s length, teasingly, then pulled himself forward again. He arched an eyebrow at Draco over his shoulder that said nothing short of “what now.” Harry wanted to be a whimpering, desperate mess when they were through and if he had to play the role of prat to get there, he was fully prepared to make that… sacrifice.
Harry: “No, you hang up first!”
I GOT THIS!
Harry: I was traumatized!
Harry gave Draco a fleeting glance, hoping the blonde would save Harry the same way he’d been saving Teddy all evening. There was no such luck. Draco sat, gracefully next to Teddy on his bed and said, “Go on, ask your questions.” Teddy smiled.
“Being gay isn’t something you’ve done, Malfoy. It’s … just a thing that’s a part of you.”
Ron: Oh yeah, best stay away from the stuff all together, mate.
Draco: Of course she does, Boy Hero. She’s insisting upon tea next week.
Greenviper: Yes.
Prongs: ????
Mr. Weasley:
Draco: "Ah fuck!"
But then Draco removed his hand altogether, instead placing it on Harry’s chest, resting his forehead on the door next to Harry’s with a sigh.
Greenviper: I meant, imagining you being paternal. For example, taking care of another living being, bedtime stories, dad arms! All things listed, I find very attractive.
Draco: You’re not funny, Potter.
Harry: Right. Sorry.
Harry: UGH!
Neville: Yes.
Millicent: "Uh huh."
Greenviper: Chapter Title: “Rediscovering old Crushes: why we didn’t recognize them”
Prongs: Are you suddenly going to not be the person I’ve been talking to since June?
Prongs: Probably for the best.
Draco: Not. That.
Prongs: I’m a Hufflepuff.
Malfoy who had, unfortunately, been savouring at the time....had promptly began to choke. Harry, for his part, was patting himself on the back for managing not to laugh during the coughing fit. Malfoy, however, surprising Harry for what must have been the fifteenth time that evening, did laugh.
Ginny: There are plenty of other queer fish in the rainbow sea, my friend.
Harry: Much appreciated.
Harry: I’m scared.
Harry: Third wheel in the domestic life of Romione just isn’t the move tonight.
You’re no fun today.
“You’re to join the Aurors, then?” Malfoy enquired, when Harry had been silent too long.
Harry: “Cho Chang? From Hogwarts?”
Harry: "Mmm-my nipples are really sensitive. Uh uh Christ, I’m going to buck myself off the bed soon."
Harry: Ok, now I’m worried that I haven’t heard from you. You’re not dead, right?
Harry: Jealous of what, Gin? I know you don’t have feelings for me anymore.
Harry: Oh, was that not how we were playing this game…
Hermione: I know taking Teddy back to Andromeda’s has been hard on you but you can’t shut everyone out like this.
Though, I suppose you get points for knowing not to try for Ravenclaw. Wouldn’t that have been a laugh.
“Are you alright?” Malfoy asked, looking dead serious. The intensity in the way he looked at  him caught Harry off guard.
Greenviper: I was in love with one all through Hogwarts. Far too much time staring at your wretched table has given me an acute awareness of all things crimson and gold.
George: We’re all a bunch of nutters, Harry. You’re not special.
Ginny: "A noted oversight on my part, I assure you. Is there enough for one more?"
Harry: Thank you!
Andromeda: I’d rather have my grandson back if it’s all the same to you.
Prongs: Touchy.
Harry: "My cock.
Harry: *Breathily* "Feels nice."
Harry: "
Ginny, you can invite Parkinson if you’d like.
After that, Teddy steered clear of relationship questions, opting for the very important ‘who would win in a fight’ variety instead.
Prongs: Uh huh <3
Prongs: Someone thinks highly of themselves.
Greenviper: Fine. Get on with it, Sir.
Harry: Go head.
Harry: Those books on gender and sexuality are the gifts that keep on giving!
You really are famous, aren’t you?
Harry: "Course."
Harry was so relieved when the waiter arrived with the glasses of water that he considered begging him to stay but, thankfully, that remained a private request.
Hermione: Dragon leather should be illegal anyway!
Greenviper: Is that supposed to be comforting to me? That is revolting. Change it immediately.
Hermione: I thought it might make things more comfortable when Ronald comes to live with you.
Ginny: Even attempt to bugger Pansy and you lose your dick, Potter!
“Might I make a suggestion,” Malfoy said, picking up and flipping through his menu. Harry nodded, perhaps too enthusiastically. “May I please order for us? You’re bound to choose something safe and bland and I, generous wizard that I am, will end up taking pity on you and giving you half my plate.”
Harry: You ruined blow jobs for me.
Dean: I’ve been in the bathroom less than a minute.
, that’s just a lot of sugar before bed.”
Dean: He hasn’t been at Auror training for the past couple days either.
Prongs: Are you shopping right now?!?

Draco: "I slip the fingers into your mouth and flirt with your tongue." *Slightly muffled* "Can you feel them? On your tongue?"
Prongs: Ooh, this is fun. You smile when you think you’ve written something clever.
TheRealGing: HAHAHA Damn straight!
MagicWood69: Send pix!!
“Oh,” Harry said, breathing heavy. He didn’t want to be an arsehole but he could feel the disappointment written all over his face.
Harry: Mr. Weasley!
Harry: "RIGHT THERE! Don’t stop, please don’t stop! I’m so close!  Touch yourself. Please touch yourself. Touch me! I’mmhmm s-so close!"
Greenviper: If by some miracle I decide to continue correspondence with you, you may refer to me as Hydra.
“That doesn’t matter,” Teddy bellowed, “my first Dad was a werewolf and Vic’s gran is half veela and she says a full veela could beat a full werewolf but I want to tell her she’s wrong!”
Greenviper: I’m sure you’ll find everything sized to your satisfaction, yes.
Ginny: Harry, Teddy adores you. Where he sleeps at night can’t change that.
Harry: "I don’t really mind getting up early."
Draco: "Why are you whispering?"
Harry: She went running after Malfoy when he huffed out the room a few minutes ago.
Prongs: Oh yeah, I started him young. Can’t get enough of the stuff.
Snicker* "Sorry."
Draco: Laugh now, Potter, but these depraved fantasies are entirely your fault.
Harry: Pub. Now.
Draco caught it smoothly.
Hermione: Stole his show? How many times do I have to tell you, there is no modern reason why it shouldn’t be the woman who proposes?
Draco: What were you planning on wearing to brunch tomorrow?
Harry: "Marshmallow mountain is surrounded by broccoli trees."
Harry: Do I need to say anything else?
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry: Everything is fine! Relax and stop stressing. We did good.
Hermione: I wonder why Malfoy got sooo upset at the EXACT same time Harry started dancing with Theo?
Greenviper: Let me know if that changes.
Ginny: Harry…if you wanted one of my old jerseys, all you had to do is ask.
Harry: I’ve got to go, I told him I was in the loo. I just wanted to keep you updated. We can talk about this when I get home.
Prongs: Ha Ha very funny. Full marks for creativity, though.
Greenviper: Excuse me?
Cho: “Come again?”
Ginny: Fire away.
Draco: "Prongs, are you there?"
Adventurous couple seeking third for a good time. Yes, I play for the Harpies. Yes, she’s the model you saw on the cover of Witch Weekly. We KNOW we’re famous! If you lead with that, I promise you we won’t respond. Only queer applicants need apply. Please and thank you!
Prongs: An extremely handsome Wizard…apparently.
Malfoy was sitting in a secluded little corner of the restaurant, anxiously checking his Spellular every couple seconds. And he said he was turning it off. Harry had to admit ,though, he looked fantastic tonight, panic-stricken expression and all.
Prongs: Merlin, I just realized what a prat you were at the ball.
Prongs: Work still busy. Can’t deal with this right now.
“No.” He was sure of that. He was. And he sounded it too, when he said it to Malfoy. But just so he’d really absorb the message, Harry said it again. “No! I’m sorry Malfoy but you’re mad if you think that. I didn’t.”
Prongs: Ok, whatever that just was… Look, I know it’s weird to ask to be exclusive when we haven’t been on a proper date yet so I think we should go on one. We just need to try this and if it doesn’t work it doesn’t work but I’m confident that it will. I want it to.
“Fucking hell, Hermione’ s going to be impossible,” was all Harry managed to say. He knew other words existed in the English language, was even aware enough to realize those words sometimes came together to form a sentence, but at that moment his mind was far too busy flipping between late night chats with Hydra and corridor duels with Malfoy to even attempt such communication.
Neville: They think we’re dating.
Prongs: Liar.
Ginny: WAIT A FUCKING SECOND! NOTT’S A DEATH EATER?!?
Prongs: Just tell me what you know.
Harry: Really…after last time?
Harry: I almost made rice but Ginny’s in training.
Anyone who’s interested message me by replying to this question: ‘If you ever met a very famous person, what would you say to them?’
Greenviper: I’m relieved.
Harry’s wand hand shook as the foggy impulse to attack and flee dissipated. He let himself see white blonde hair and immaculately tailored muggle clothes. He breathed in the smell of his cologne. Harry had asked him once what it was called and he’d responded “black musk,” but on the frequent occasions when Harry let himself get lost in it, he thought it smelled more of cinnamon incense and hot rosemary tea. Things that you convince yourself are only for special occasions but in actuality aren’t all that hard to get your hands on.
Hangs head * I know.
Ginny: Harry! YOU HAVE THE INNER EYE, I SWEAR!
Harry: *Laughs*
Greenviper: I thought as much. Truly, though, it isn’t that big a deal. I’ve walked in on my friends loads of times. Once, I thought I was meeting my best friend at her place for brunch and instead I met her girlfriend…tied to a swing… in the middle of the living room.
Greenviper: Wait, you got a five-year-old to eat curry?
Blaise: I do
Greenviper: Thank, Salazar.
“I think you’ll find that’s exactly who I am.” He began ticking things off on his fingers. “I’m the man you flirted with, you joked with, you shared anecdotes about your godson with; the one who told you about the tooth fairy and who fucked you over – “
Pansy: It will bring out your eyes. You know, those orbs in the middle of your head, saving your face from repugnance.
Draco: She made me sip the wine I brought to check I hadn’t poisoned it.
Neville: Did you read the prophet this morning?
Draco: "Sssh, I am here. You’ve just got a blindfold on so, unfortunately for you, you can’t see all the truly depraved things I’m going to do to you."
Greenviper: Fuck.
“Sorry, must of – we slept in.”
Draco: Meet me at Charming tonight at 9.
Draco: "No, I don’t think I will."
Hermione: Neville says you haven’t been to work in three days.
Anyway, I’m sure you could ask the cashier to have it shipped to your house.
Harry: TMI
“Do shut up,” Draco said with a chaste  kiss before aparating away.
Ginny: Oh, I got it.
Harry: I guess.
SheSnake: Did you give her cakes?
Ginny: I can hear your tone from London.
Draco: NO. Pansy dresses you like sex on a broomstick. I won’t be focused.
“No,” he said, “on the contrary, I think that was rather decisive, Potter”
I can’t believe you’re talking to me.
Greebviper: Yes.
Harry: Very true. We both know that despite years of torture, humiliation, and physical violence you were scribbling Mr. Malfoy-Potter all over your potions book. There’s no need to discuss it further.
Theo: Suppose it is, yeah. Can’t live on Granddad’s galleons forever, can I? Then again, here I am chatting up the air to Sleekeazy’s. What do you think, would I make a good trophy husband?
“I know,” Draco consented, both hands firmly on Harry’s chest again. His arms were completely outstretched to ensure there was a substantial amount of space between the two of them.  “You need to go home before I lose my nerve.”
“I won’t get in trouble?” Teddy asked. Harry shook his head.
Harry: YOU gave my number to Pansy!
Greenviper: No. I’m not.
Harry: What about one Potter giving head?
Arthur: I look forward to seeing proof of that.
Harry: *Laughing* “The floos open.”
Harry: Maybe?!?
Prongs: Rather mean than evasive.
The sass. Just, WOW
Hermione: Shall I see if Florean will stay open late tonight? He’s always had a soft spot for you.
“Says me,” Teddy said, exasperated, “just pretend it’s the rules. So, Cousin, are you his boyfriend?”
Draco: *Laughing* “Idiot.”
Fleur: Harry, I don’t mean to do this on your birthday but Teddy woke up screaming and he hasn’t stopped for the past two hours. He won’t tell us what’s wrong. He just keeps asking for you.
Hermione: Harry, are you going to be alright tonight?
Greenviper: Yes, please discontinue that course of action immediately.
Prongs: Really?!?
Harry: Ron sees this chat!
Pansy: Oooh, Potter learned to play. What’s this for?
Prongs: You don’t have a leather jacket, do you?
“I’m just going to go to the bathroom and – “
Harry: I’m exhausted but Merlin he’s cute.
Greenviper: For wizards, yes! And she gives a lot better than galleons. Do not ruin this for that precious child!
Greenviper: Smooth segue.
Harry: WTF just happened?
Neville: Because I didn’t brew the antidote fast enough and I was only able to preserve about a quarter of my body.
Prongs: …Beer from my fridge.
Hermione: Teddy wakes Harry up at 5am, therefore we all must wake up at 5am. #survivingthetedtextnado
They were late to brunch.
Harry: Hate is a strong word.
Prongs: Thank you!
“Keep working, Potter,” Draco taunted. His voice had taken on the same husky quality as the previous night and what was once a whisper of arousal, became a steady pulse between his legs. Harry let out an exasperated huff.
Prongs: And women and non-gendered fellows…people.
Prongs: Mate’s got a crush on the bar-woman there.
Hermione: Frankly, I’m not convinced you’ve done a spectacular job of concealing your identity.
Greenviper: I refuse to play this game with you. Am I your boyfriend or not, Potter?
Harry: Gin, could you maybe just let her back into the flat, you don’t even have to forgive her. I would just really like Draco to talk to me again? Pretty please!
, he thought, unable to speak, this was really happening.
Ginny: Good boy.
Ron: Huh?
Draco: "Oh tisk tisk, I’m not sure about that disingenuous tone."
Greenviper: We all lost people in the war, Prongs.
Draco: "So you’ve turned into a – "
Prongs: Until you’re begging for my cock.
Harry: Maybe. Gin might come over after. Depends on how the night goes.
Pansy: You’re a fucking hypocrite, Weasley! If the roles were reversed, there’s no way you would have given up Potter if he asked you not to say anything.
Did the band get here on time?
In a rational world, Harry would have watched him walk away. He would drink himself under the table on Malfoy’s tab then return home to a chorus of ‘I told you so’s’ from Hermione. But nothing in Harry’s life was ever perfect, and the idea of letting Malfoy leave already seemed full of regret. After all, he’d spent six years staring at the bloke and the past three months falling for him.
Draco: “Wear the blue.”
Harry: This is REALLY unnecessary.
Harry: What spell gets me out of this?
Prongs: If it makes you feel better, I had to look up auspicious.
Harry: Knew it.
Ginny: What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Ginny: BLEH!
“Ready or not, here I come,” Harry called, voice echoing throughout his flat. Truth be told there weren’t many decent hiding places in the quaint two-bedroom. Particularly when one was on the hunt for Teddy Lupin, who tended to favor Harry’s old school trunk. Harry made a performance of looking for the boy all the same; he checked under the kitchen table, in the cabinets and, dramatically beneath the couch cushions.
person does, Malfoy.”
Greenviper: Too soon to tell.
Prongs: No. I’ve just told you we broke up.
Draco: Easy for you to say, my mum already loves you!
Ginny: LOL I knew you couldn’t make it a full day. Ron you owe me ten galleons!
Draco: Sweet dreams, you sap.
Draco: Hmm, what would you have done? Drag me to a secluded corner of the castle like you did at the club? That would have been interesting. Not sure if Snape would have approved…
Look, Hydra, it’s not my fault YOU told me some personal shit about yourself and now you’re feeling insecure about it.  I told you I don’t care about your family.
Get a friend to side-long you home! Not a Gryffindor! You lot always drunk-splinch yourselves thinking you can out-nerve statistics! Again, I recommend Abbott. There is only one reason to invite a Hufflepuff to a party and it’s not to be the life of it.
Harry: Yes, Ma’am.
Prongs: No, you’re Draco.
Greenviper: I regret what I did. I’m a horrible person. I deserved to die in Azkaban, maybe you wish you killed me yourself, I don’t know. Is that what you want to hear? Because I like you! I never put up with these war conversations because they never make anyone feel better but I like you a lot and you needed to know.
Ron: Come again?
Seriously, GO TO SLEEP. She’s not going to wait all night for you.
Prongs: Sure.
Harry: That you even know the word speaks volumes.
Greenviper: Do.
Lavender: "Later, then."
Harry: "Mr. Brewer."
Greenviper: Why?
Who needs internal organs?
Greenviper: Isn’t that why everyone’s family’s in Azkaban.
Lavender: "A travesty, more like! Don’t worry, I’ll handle it. We’ll be there at ten to set up. Is that satisfactory?"
Harry: Headmistress!
Harry: I don’t think I can do this!
Cho: *Deadpan* “Would you like to order something, Sir?”
Greenviper: Obviously.
Harry: You don’t remember giving me a blow job EVERY day in November then not so subtly asking me to do a publicity tour to promote your brother’s Spell Phone company?
Draco: "Tell me you’ve heard of a silencing charm."
Hermione: A foot massage says he doesn’t make it to the next song.
Draco: Get Pansy out of my house.
McGonagall: When I was a girl, I too fell for a man that seemed wrong for all the logical reasons and, for that matter, so did your mother around the same age. She chose her heart and, though unfairly short, I believe those years with your father and later you were the best of her life. While I am not one for regrets, I have plagued myself with decades of wondering. You do not want to wonder.
Harry: “I was styled again by my close and generous friend, Pansy Parkinson.”
snap a shot of him leaving? Would this all be some strange dream that only worked in this place, at this time, tonight? Because as much as Harry didn’t want it to be, he had this horrible feeling that this was something huge but temporary. As if he didn’t believe this kind of happiness was sustainable.
Prongs: Parkinson would kill me.
Harry: ???
be scared of me,” Teddy said quietly. Harry’s head abruptly turned back to the boy, Harry and Draco saying “No,” at the same time.
Harry: Haha It’ll be done in 10.
Prongs: For fuck’s sake!
Neville: Don’t know, might make Hannah jealous.
Harry: Kind of.
Harry, past  shame, quoted his own notes in the margins of the book he’d gifted Draco. “Who’d you think I was talking about?”
Greenviper: Salazar, we have returned to Hogwarts. Truth.
Ron: NO! I was using a daydream potion and you need a physical representation … and sometimes she puts them on for me and it just REALLY WORKS OK!?!?
Ginny: ROFL!! Your toy collection is out of hand!
“Mr. Malfoy your table is ready,” the cheery hostess informed them. She seemed to realize she’d walked in on something and suddenly looked like she wanted to bolt on the spot.
Greenviper: Done.
McGonagall: That was a lovely event, Potter. Well done.
Neville: … She gave you the first week of evening patrols, didn’t she?
Ginny: I’m in truoble
Harry: I’m on my way!
Harry: Ginny thinks I am.
“You’d be a pathetic excuse for a Slytherin, just so you’re aware. ” He had a smug look on his face and Harry wished he could spell it off. “You have lie written all over you.” He leaned close to Harry. So close Harry could feel the warmth of his breath, smell the vodka on it. Grey eyes bore into Green. “Did you think Hydra was Nott, or did you want him to be?”
Prongs: Haha it’s not like that. I just want to know your pronouns. I’m pan so I don’t know if it’s not in your bio.
Harry listened and laughed at the way every story Malfoy seemed to tell was a performance, embellished with a sense of suspense and an endless series of hand gestures. He was all at once exactly the same and totally different than the wizard Harry had known at Hogwarts or even the one he’d gotten to know over Howlr. It was so odd, Harry kept thinking, how he’d felt he’d known Hydra completely but in reality had known nothing about him.
Greenviper: Trite.
Ginny: Hey.
Ron: Lucky…We didn’t get off early enough!
Prongs: You wound me.
Harry: We’re on our way! You just saved me from dealing with an epic tantrum.
Draco: "So help me, if you break character one more time, I’ll stop altogether."
I’m up before ten, so your lazy arse better be awake.
“Why are you fighting this?” Harry asked.
Harry: Arrg.
Mr. Weasley: Molly wanted me to tell you that you look very handsome tonight. She also said to get off your Spellular and talk to people.
Greenviper: Are you still there!?!?!
Greenviper: Alright, I’m in the cubicle. There’s nothing here.
Greenviper: Abbott?
Draco: Let me clarify the question. If Teddy COULD come tonight, would you still have invited me?
Draco: “Potter, are you deaf? That’s not what I - “
Ron: Woah.
Harry: What do you want?
Hermione: Oh, Harry.
“You’re so beautiful,” Draco confessed, kissing the back of Harry’s thigh. “A nuisance, no doubt, but gorgeous.”
About what genius are we speaking?
Teddy: "Lo" *Giggles* " Jimmy!"
Greenviper: If you were dreadfully ill, confined to your bed, would you apologize for it?
Neville: Had to. I’m shagging the boy who lived!
You need to get laid. Immediately.
Draco:
Harry: That’s quite enough of that, thank you!
Harry: Hey, watch where you’re pointing that wand, you might miss and hit my feelings.
Harry: "
year girl.
Harry: No. You and Ron are a family. You’ll get married and have kids that will also be your family. Ginny will have Pansy and Neville will have Hannah and Teddy will have Andromeda and I’ll just be a side relative everyone calls uncle but doesn’t actually belong.
Ginny: If you must know, Pansy and I use it for threesomes.
Prongs: You KNOW I’m not pure blood. You’ve known since week one. Why would you even want anything to do with me? Why put me through this?
Harry: I just want to enjoy the time I have left.
Harry: You waited until the last minute to tell me on purpose, didn’t you?
Prongs: Ye of so little faith, Vipesie!
Prongs: Was my house really that obvious? I was a hat-stall, I’ll have you know.
Hermione: We’ve sorted that all out. He’s going to spend the night with Bill, Fleur and Victoire. He loves her!
Draco: "He says affectionately.  Do you trust me, Prongs?"
Harry: Option 2.
Draco: How did you manage to put your number in my phone? I was with you all night.
bastard back!
Harry: "I…It…you *sigh* See you tomorrow."
“Some memories good,” she took a deep breath and shivered sugestivley, “some better!”
Harry: No.
Hermione: Harry?
Harry: Calm down. Let me get Teddy fed then we’ll come help you.
Prongs: She felt I was taking too long to figure out my sexuality.
Draco: Only the songs they play at Christmas.
Theo: So, when are you going to ask me out?
TheRealGing: FIND NEW WANK FODDER, POTTER! AND STOP HITTING ON MY GF BEFORE I CASTRATE YOU!
McGonagall: After all, I can’t have the students getting away with everything for an entire month. What on earth was I thinking?
Prongs: It’d be hard to…I eat lunch.
McGonagall: What is it, Potter?
Screenname: Prongs
Harry: "Hey, Lavender."
Harry: A pleasure doing business with you.
Draco: "She asked you not to say anything?"
Prongs: Soundly tucked away.
“Was that her?” Draco demanded. Her? Harry stared at the blonde, utterly and completely lost.
Mr. Weasley:
“It’s important to remember, Ted – and I tell you this all the time – that being a werewolf isn’t fun or cool. They have no control over the wolf part of themselves and are likely to hurt the people closest to them, making them feel horrible about themselves.”
Prongs: HAHAHA Well, I definitely fancy you… so you can take that as you’d like.
“Mmm,” Harry sighed, mouth slack, as he widened his stance. His heart was hammering against his chest.
Harry: Sorry, Ma’am.
Harry: I’m not.
Oh MY GOD. My messages are so embarrassing.
Harry: "Perfect."
Harry: So help me, Parkinson, if you hurt her…
Harry: Where?
Pansy: I’m just not going to tell you the price.
Harry: lol
Harry: Tell her I said ‘no.’
Harry wasn’t sure how long the song had been over, he kept strumming nonsense chords in the hopes that if he didn’t stop playing, the moment between he and Draco wouldn’t have to end.
“I guess,” Harry began, “this means – mmm – we’re no longer waiting.” Draco stopped thrusting and stared directly at Harry.
Theo: You and I made the prophet, Potter.
Harry: Fine.
Harry: What do you think?
Pansy: Stay out of this, Scarhead.
Harry: I’ve no idea, Headmistress.
Ron: ‘I know. Couldn’t sleep. Hermione Proposed, mate! I’m gutted I didn’t get to ask her, tell you the truth, but, FUCK, I’m getting married!’
Harry: "FUCK! Merlin, please Hydra. I want it. M-make me wet for you. Open me up and give me what you promised. I-I’m desperate for it."
Prongs: That I’ll see you tonight.
Draco: “I know you hate it, Potter, but my mother will love it.”
Prongs: Putting his godson to bed. He sings him a song and everything. I had to leave, it was giving me a cavity.
Ginny: Oi, why wasn’t I invited?
Prongs: Don’t be riddikulus.
Apologies, I didn’t mean that to sound so lachrymose.
Ginny: NOOO!!! I hate you. You’re so inconsiderate.
. I remember that being a significant pull in Lavender’s favor.’
Greenviper: Are you naked?
Hermione: That’s impressive magic.
Ron: So he can blow up my house?
Harry let out a half-hearted laugh, the phrase ‘like what you see?’ poised to come out of his mouth when he remembered they were not the only people in the flat.
Harry: Fine. Ground rules of the flat. There are bedrooms for a reason. If you’re so keen on the couch, we can arrange to have it put in your bedroom or burned. Either works for me.
Draco: So help me, Potter, if you’re not at this door in ten seconds…
Prongs: ‘Get yourself off.’
I’m his godfather. His parents died in the war. I’m not even usually his primary caregiver but his Gran is in hospital for the next week, so I get to look after him.
Draco: We can’t leave in the middle of toasts, it’s rude.
Harry: Merlin! Very funny, Ron. That can’t be Hydra.
Harry: "Wait no, don’t stop." *Groan* "Oh, thank Merlin."
Andromeda: Yes, yes, he’s perfectly well but I have a checkup in an hour and I completely forgot it’s a half day at Wiz Kid? Do you think you’d be able to pick him up at noon? If not, I could always cancel my appointment. Of course, who knows what they’ll charge if I do that.
Harry: “You can have one or the other, Ted, not both.”
Harry: Draco, come on?
Prongs: Hahahaha
Prongs: Bond with Hermione, shag Ron, and stun Harry.
Ginny: I know. I know. But I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important.
Ginny: Lol why Oops?
Harry: Try first MONTH.
Harry: You guys are the best!
Prongs: Switch, remember ;b
Greenviper: I didn’t say it did.
Draco: Goodnight, Potter.
Prongs: I know.
Harry: “Teddy don’t say that.”
Padma: According to my records, he owns two public properties in the wizarding world. His flat, which I’m sure you’ve already checked, and number 12 grimmauld place. Have you looked there?
Greenviper: I’ve decided to be the better person and forgive you for yesterday’s blunder.
Dean: I thought we banned his name from this chat.
Prongs: Typing from personal experience?
“Salazar Potter, you heartless fool, look what you’ve done to my cousin.” Draco stared at the boy like he was the most precious crystal ball in his collection. “Do something,” he continued, “he’s about to cry!”
Prongs: So there’s this purple bottle just sitting on my bedside table, know anything about it?
Neville: Well, as long as you have time to be a smart arse.
And Draco was on him – really on him – but it was almost as if Harry knew it was coming because their lips fit together perfectly and when Draco came at him with more force, Harry stayed planted, adapting to the other man’s moves. Draco devoured him, hands everywhere he could reach. He let out a relieved whimper as if he’d been starved and Harry were a hot meal.
Prongs: HI-DRAAAA!
And I can’t quite tell, zoom out.
Glad I didn’t have to, though. I’ve never thought about it like that before.
Greenviper: Says you.
Prongs: Give my apologies to my fans.
Greenviper: Have you sobered up at all?
Ginny: Isn’t it just.
Pansy: Your beloved, Potter, wasn’t in any danger! Salazar, he defeated the Dark Lord, I’m pretty sure he can handle, Draco.
“I just finished my potions mastery,” he gritted out, “and am looking for – “
Prongs: What?
Draco: "I almost got to hear you laugh just now."
Ron: Well, you know Hermione’s been traveling for work a lot lately. So I was having myself a bit of a wank and I got carried away and now I think I’ve ruined a set of her old Hogwarts robes.
Hermione: Where to start? I was going to surprise Ron because I’d been away but for some reason, I couldn’t get my skirt’s zip up.
Greenviper: Indisputably. Do pretend you have a brain, Prongs.
Blaise: This is Blaise Zabini. I was in your year at Hogwarts.
Harry stopped then, noticing Malfoy had gone very pale and looked rather more panicked than he had a moment ago.
Harry: So mutual masturbation then?
Draco: This is a terrible precedent, Potter. And you can say his name, now. I know my own cousin, even if we’ve never spoken.
Harry: *simultaneously* “You could just come over n - “   Draco: *Simultaneously* “I think it’s best if I do your hair my – “
Prongs: Course… Trying to avoid another meltdown, thanks.
Harry: Yes!
Greenviper: As I said, I am tragically familiar with the steps of an episode. I assume you are in the apology phase. Congratulations, that means you’re doing better. I just don’t need to be on the list.
Forgive me?
Greenviper: Not that it’s necessarily a problem, but you’ve never mentioned you had a kid.
Harry: "Yes. I’m really really sorry but we’re going to have to do this another time. T- Something’s wrong with my godson and I have to go get him. *Muttering* I knew he was too young to stay the night."
Lavender: Cho hasn’t done a drop of magic in three years.
Harry: Could we possibly do this another time?
Harry: "Liked that, did you?"
Harry: "You’re at my place. I offer you a drink."
Ron: Thanks for earlier, mate!
Prongs: I wasn’t aware it was my job to reassure you. Shall I bill you hourly or will a flat rate do?
“Well, it’s good to know someone can pick up my hints,” Malfoy continued on, “I was beginning to think I was the problem. Can you imagine?”
Harry: *Chuckling* "No. It’s perfect. You’re perfect. Just fuck us, baby. Believe me, I’ve been tortured enough."
Draco: "Of course you must go! Let me know he’s alright when you can."
Ginny: Harry, what did you do?
Greenviper: I’m turning my Spellular off. If you would like to talk to me, you can put on your Gryffindor pants and do it properly.
Harry: “If your cup is full then you haven’t drinkin anything yet. Fact!”
Harry: Yes. For a few years. Don’t know what officially for, though.
Harry: "I’m afraid."
Harry: “Try again.”
Ginny: Bet’s a bet.
“Bum ars-e-tit,” Harry continued in a bad French accent. Draco promptly batting Harry’s hands away from him.
Harry: Good luck with that. I’m more powerful than you. By the time you work your way through them, I’ll be gone.
Ginny: I know. That’s why I came to you.
Harry: I got off early.
Ginny: NO. I want to see the 2 you together
Prongs: Yes! Veela v. Werewolf! Turned out to be a real critical thinker.
“Pureblood prejudice is not a friend to any of us.” Malfoy averted his eyes, looking as if he were choosing his next words very carefully. “I can’t imagine growing up with it as a child his age.” He adjusted the position of his plate. “At least I can understand what I’ve done to receive it.”
Harry: His hair as dark as a blackboard.
Draco: "You’ll be needing that silencing charm."
Prongs: This from the man who uses the silent treatment as a threat.
Ron: Right in one.
Harry: To go with my eyepatch?
Ginny: ‘Mum, Ron was talking to me about Gran’s ring the other day. I think he’s finally ready to propose!’
Did you taste the food?
Neville: Right.
Andromeda: Very well. I feel as if I’ve missed something.
Andromeda: Wonderful. See you later, Harry.
Draco: Yes, well she’s taken a fair few quaffles to the head so I wouldn’t quit your day job quite yet.
Greenviper: Draco Malfoy.
Greenviper: Not in the slightest.
“God, Potter – Yes!” Draco gripped onto either side of his hips and slammed into him. Sweat speckled Harry’s back, a loud grunt ripping from both their throats. It was all too much for Harry. With a twist and the brush of his thumb against the head of his cock, he was coming.
Rolling*
Prongs: Hydra…
Prongs: Right. Good talk.
Oh. No, no. I don’t think he’s what we’re looking for.
Hermione: We thought it might be nice if you came over for dinner tonight.
I’ve got it. The Golden Trio: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger.
Ron: ‘Older, luckier and fair bit wiser, I’d reckon.’
Harry: No. I think I’ll have another lie in.
“That was all you!” he insisted.
“I assure you, I just had an exceedingly satisfactory breakfast,” he reached a hand down to rub at Harry soar bum, “I’ll thank you to remember.”
Greenviper: You’d be surprised.
Hermione: "What’s the name of the manager?"
Greenviper: I know.
Draco: "I vanish your clothes, sitting at your feet – appraising you. It’s important to me, deciding which parts of you I want touch first. Eventually, I slowly slide my hands down your chest then back up your thighs."
The next blows cracked against his thighs, alternating, one right after the other then back again. Harry whimpered, a panting mess, sweat making his hair stick to his forehead and the back of his neck.
“No, but only with us, yeah?” Teddy nodded. He looked from Harry to Draco as if he couldn’t quite believe his luck and said, “Fuck’um,” then laughed.
Prongs: Up against the wall.
Draco: Which one?
Harry:
“Oh –“ Draco said, eyes landing on the five-year-old at the entrance to the living room. Today he had dark black hair going in every direction, green eyes and a white-toothed smile that took up a quarter of his face.
Harry: …
“What are you doing, Potter,” Malfoy said with bite. He hadn’t sat back down. “You’ve made it perfectly clear this isn’t going anywhere. I scarcely see the point in wasting anymore of our time.” He pulled out his wallet and smoothly placed a hundred pound note on the bar between them.
Prongs: Sometimes I genuinely miss changing nappies.
Then he was fucking into Harry, shoving forward as Harry used his remaining energy to push back. They settled on a hard, erratic rhythm that was sure not to beget longevity. Draco thrust in, angled perfectly to ignite that spot inside him.
“Aaaare you coming?” Harry heard Teddy whine, voice muffled and odd-sounding from within the trunk. Harry jerked his head back to look over his shoulder again, the sound of his godson’s voice like a bucket of ice-cold water to his senses.
AS ALWAYS, a size-kink thank you to Syn, who is the world's best Beta (I mean no offense)! We work so well together and she sacrificed studying for her exams to get this chapter to you faster and I love her and she's perfect and (oh yeah) enjoy the final chapter!
Draco was on him again, kissing him like they’d been apart for  weeks as opposed to mere minutes. This time, it was Malfoy weaving his hands through Harry’s impossibly messy hair. He was the one moaning wantonly at every brush of their cocks.
“You’ve got to stop sneaking up on me,” he admonished, craning his neck to look up at the blonde.
Harry:  *Exhausted chuckle* "You and me, both."
Harry: Are you allowed to be messaging to me?
Prongs: Ppl keep bying me shots. Rude 2 sa no I think
Draco: We know what we know, Potter. There is no need to belabour the issue.
Prongs: Christ, you’re right!
Greenviper: I’m waiting.
Prongs: Fancy going to the Yule Ball with me? I promise not to cop a feel.
Harry: HAHAHA You did what?!?!
Prongs: Merlin forbid you carry a bag.
She made me do so many broom pull-ups I think my arms might fall off.
Harry:
“Sounds more like the six “s’s” of sucking cock,” Harry blurted, remembering himself too late and turning a shade of red one doesn’t often see outside of December.
“We never managed to, actually,’ Harry said, absently, mind reeling at what felt like an impossibility. No, what
Greenviper: I’ll divulge this; if nothing else about us works, we’ll always have the sex.
Harry: Jesus, Gin, how did you know where I was? You didn’t have to hit me.
Greenviper: I’ll meet you at the bar of a restaurant called “The Sinclair,” on Pollen st, Mayfair. How does 18:30 sound? I know it may seem early but it is a Monday evening, after all.
Greenviper: You’re delusional.
Barely half a second later, Teddy was in the room, clutching his Hippogriff stuffy to his chest.
Greenviper: You know what would make me feel better?
Draco: I haven’t the faintest idea what you’re insinuating.
“Thank you,” Harry grinned, very pleased with himself.
“You’re such a bratty sub,” Draco said. He kneaded at the red, marked globes that were once Harry’s arse, occasionally tracing over bits of raised skin. Harry was going to feel this well into next week. The thought made him shudder; sitting in the Great Hall, preparing for classes, no one knowing why he kept wincing.
Prongs: How did you know…
“Well done,” Draco praised and Harry, Godric knows why, thanked him, the word ‘Sir’ poised at his lips. In the future, when Harry looked back on this morning, and he certainly would (often), he would mark this as the moment he knew he was thoroughly and irrevocably fucked.
Prongs: If it hurt someone else…probably.
first years and then you’re off dancing with him like he’s as pure as puff.” Malfoy all but shouted.
– “mouth –”
Greenviper: Is this your subtle way of asking me to kiss your arse, Potter? A public rimming is a bit kinkier than I had in mind for a first date. But who am I to refuse the Chosen One?
Drink two cups of water.
Finger guns * I really loved that joke!
Harry: It was better live!
Harry: Ginny… give it another go.
Harry: Can I bring Draco to the engagement party tomorrow night?
Prongs: I promise I’m not usually this much of an arse. Give me another chance.
Prongs: Shit…did you think?
Greenviper: Weren’t you the one who said we should just leave it?
Pansy: Take comfort in the fact that befuddlement is the state I assume you are most comfortable.
Draco: *Listens to Harry laugh*
Greenviper: Then again, waiter boy does have libidinous lips.
Unknown: Potter!
Ginny: "Wow! What?"
Harry: Why?
“Funny enough,” Malfoy chuckled, taking Harry’s hard length in hand, “this gave you away.”
This chapter destroyed me. There is none of me left. Syn Beta'd so hard! SO HARD! I OWE HER A LIFE DEBT! Some scenes had to be rewritten multiple times. I had a bit of a breakdown where I forgot words and I cried in my car to "being alive" from company because I think it is basically Harry's anthem in this fic! Anyoo, I hope you enjoy the product of my blood, sweat and tears! Comments and love are always appreciated.
Ginny: Did you go to family dinner?
Oh and his bedtime is 7:30 on school nights but we both know I’m not going to stick to that.
McGonagall: Hmm… You know, I asked myself the same question when I made Remus Lupin a prefect. It ended disastrously then too.
Ron: ‘You knew, didn’t you?’
Draco brought his hand to Harry’s cheek and kissed the skin just below his left ear. “Don’t tell me you’re not happy to see me,” he said, then had the audacity to chuckle with the cockiness of a wizard who knew there wasn’t anything further from the truth.
“And they said we couldn’t compromise,” Malfoy teased. Harry rolled his eyes, if only to skive off the absurd impulse he had to giggle.
“However, on a full moon, the wolf has no real connection to his human self, while the Veela maintains human consciousness, which in the case of a fight would hopefully mean they’d also maintain a sense of human morality thus – “
Harry felt a sure hand wrap around his waist. He jumped, belatedly realizing, as he looked down at pale, manicured, fingers who they belonged to.
Greenviper: Tell me something personal about yourself. Level the pitch a trifle.
Harry: I don’t have anything in my hand.
Neville: It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to a school full of teenagers.
Prongs: lol Alright, my turn! Truth or dare?
Prongs: Yeah
Ginny: She said she had a shoot there, but she had her lie voice on. I’ll pester her about it later. For now, we know where he is!
“How could I possibly interrupt – “ Draco paused, a teasing look about his face, “whatever it was I just walked in on.” Harry gave him a two finger salute and returned to his work on the hollandaise. He spared a glance at the butter he had clarifying in a small pot and leaned more fully into Draco’s arms.
Harry: Great.
Ginny: Fuck.
Ginny: Text right before you leave Shell.
Prongs: So… your screenname?
Prongs: I guess. This one seems to like me.
Draco: *Labored breathing* "I hope that silencing charm worked."
Hermione: Say hi to Malfoy for me.
Seriously, I’m waiting up. Don’t make me come find you!
It’s going against my better judgement to say so, but that actually looks pretty good.
Fairy dust and Ogden’s…non-advisable combination.
Harry: Besides the point.
Greenviper: I’m trying not to take this personally. Have I misplaced a fight somewhere in my memory?
Not that it’s any of your concern, Potter, but you needn’t worry. You know better than I, so I’m told, that Ginevra is the heartbreaker in this relationship.
Draco: "It’s a potion I invented. I took the alpha draft. Where ever I touch myself, you can feel it on your body. For example, this is my hand on your inner thigh. And this…"
Harry: The one and only.
“How you did all the eating but I ended up stuffed.” Harry snickered, wiggling his eyebrows at Draco, proud of his joke.
Harry: "I have reliably good instincts."
Harry: Are we going to talk about it?
Ginny: No.
Screenname: Prongs
Harry:  Precisely, that would be the point of all the toys.
Ron: Hey, you just getting up?
Oh and Harry, totally unrelated, could you possibly bring some of those muggle nail clippers?
Prongs: I got on Howlr because I wanted to start an actual relationship and I see that with you. I like you, Hydra, I really do but I don’t just want to be the bloke who occasionally gets you off.
Draco: If I tell you something, will you promise not to wax Gryffindor?
Ginny: It’s been two years!
Mr. Brewer: "I’ll see what I can –"
Ron: Fuck … Must have been distracted. ;)
Prongs: I came here for comfort and support in this trying time.
Prongs: You two are insane!
Draco:  I’ll just ask Pansy what she’s wearing, shall I?
“Are you two gonna kiss?” Teddy grimaced, looking equal parts disgusted and intrigued by the prospect. Harry laughed, cheeks growing ever redder. He picked up Teddy’s stuffed Hippogriff, placed it in his arms and put the boy to bed without another word.
Hermione: Grrrlshfla
hit Harry like a spark of life. He lurched forward, lower lip trapped between his teeth. This is what he wanted, had been pushing for, needed.
Harry: "Please Hydra, just put it in!"
“Did he say he wanted me to be his boyfriend?” Draco challenged.
Prongs: Hey
Hermione: I told you, perseverance. That’s the key!
Ginny: The world may never know, Harry. It may never know.
Harry: "Nothing good, I suppose."
Harry: Then…Sure, bring him long!
He sauntered toward Harry, a look of concern on his face but chose not to comment on Harry’s apparent paranoia and what had inevitably caused it.  Harry was grateful for that and tried to let his embarrassment melt away with the tension in his shoulders. He could see it in his face that, at least, that was something Draco understood. He wasn’t going to make Harry talk about it or explain himself because he also had bad days, days stolen by echoes of a past neither of them asked for.
Harry: God Gin, I’m sorry.
Harry: You’re all arseholes.
TheRealGing: Say it. I know you want to.
Except also…Never again.
Greenviper: I was headed out anyway.
Harry: I feel like I’m missing something.
Harry: Oh, I almost forgot... I was too (ehem) distracted earlier to tease you about this, but your Daddy kink was OUT OF HAND last night. I still can’t believe you wanked in my bathroom.
Ron: ‘Harry!’
Ron: LGBTQSPEW…GAY
Photo (3)
Prongs: Hydra, Hydra, Hydra…I know you’re gagging for it, but I already told you I can’t send you a dick pic.
Pansy: What could the invincible Harry Potter possibly need from me?
Now all eyes were on a pink-cheeked Draco Malfoy. “I thought I was a tosser,” he teased Teddy, to Harry’s chagrin. He’d much prefer it if the word was forgotten rather than become a staple in the boy’s vocabulary.
Harry: So it’s spirit week at Teddy’s school and today they’re supposed to dress up like a witch or wizard they admire. I walked in his room and he looked just like me.              Metamorphed himself a little scar and everything.
Ginny: She was already coming. It’s a public bar, Ron, you don’t get to decide who I bring to it.
Prongs: They’re only really family by blood but yeah, they’re pretty much all the ‘phobics’.
Sorry, my left. Your, right!
Greenviper: I have another confession to make… I am Timothy Morcott.
Greenviper: Hey stranger.
Oh… Damn it, you let Pansy dress you! Unbutton your top button and get your fit arse over here.
“Just for you,” Harry echoed.
Ron: Not at MY party.
Ginny: Well, if memory serves…
Greenviper: "Say what you will about his tactics, but at least when he was in charge you didn’t have entitled homosexuals making political demands. Can you believe they have the wizengamot discussing the idea of marriage contracts?”
Harry: Me and my baskets.
Greenviper: There will be others nights.
Draco: Deductive reasoning, too? How they let you get away, I’ll never know.
“Malfoy,” Harry began, determined not to look at him any longer. “I don’t mean to be rude but could you move down a seat, I’m meeting someone.”
vaults , Potter!”
Hermione: "It was nothing. We’ll see you tomorrow at what time?"
I’m so freaking excited!
Greenviper: I'd arch my back, keening
Greenviper: Where do we stand?
Hermione: Thanks again, Harry. Dinner was exquisite, as always! I look forward to your next culinary creation.
Draco: Of course, how could I have possibly forgotten: Veela, Could-have-done-better and Who-cares?
“You’re still not counting,” Draco admonished. Harry laughed, voice coming out a bit madder than he’d meant it to. He took a steady breath.
Harry: Stop that. I’m over it. Hydra’s a Death Eater.
Hermione: If he wants to.
Harry: I’ll bring her home in a minute.
Greenviper: Pardon?
Harry: "FUCK! The head of my cock is red and leaking. You’re driving me insane. FASTER."
Hermione: Hydra, obviously.
Failing to satisfy, however, Malfoy took matters into his own hands. The surprisingly capable blonde grabbed Harry by the collar and slammed him against the front door. He ran a smooth hand down Harry’s neck, eventually holding his throat in place as he bit, licked and sucked on Harry’s ear.
Harry: I told him he could call me ‘God Da’ if he didn’t like ‘Harry’ anymore.  He said that ‘Harry’ didn’t ‘define the relationship.’
Ginny: Is it true you felt up my brother?
Draco: No, I know the names. In chronological order:  Aunt Murderer Weasel, Born-to-be-muggle Weasel, Attractive Genetic Anomaly Weasel, Dragon Weasel, Swotty Weasel, Auditorily Challenged Weasel, Worst Weasel, Soon-to-be Mrs. Granger-Worst Weasel, Potty Weasel and, last and almost least, Weaselette.
Greenviper: You still there? Or did you fall asleep?
Harry: I think he’s going to be pissed you stole his show. But you’ve done well, it really does suit him!
Harry: "Yeah… I know you didn’t want to use the Floo network for the delivery but the giant fireplace in the kitchens looks like our best bet at the moment."
Draco: Doesn’t she have about 30 other kittens that could help her?
Harry: *Clenched teeth* “It’s not the money
Harry: Oh yeah, it’s wasteful, crazy and 100% unnecessary.
Ginny: Anyway, it’s my identity. I prefer sex with women, I’m not romantically interested in men anymore and am monogamous with a woman. I choose the label ‘gay.’ How other people interpret that label is not my job to give a fuck about.
My beta is beautiful and wonderful and true.
Hermione: Frankly, I’m hurt.
Prongs: You are kinky, right? I’m not about to scare you away, am I?
Ginny: Yes… but tbh Harry that’s not such a bad idea for you. Besides, I thought I was going out with a hook up and they ended up being my soulmate.
Greenviper: It’s in the wizards toilets, first stall. Message me when you get home and I’ll tell you how to use it.
Prongs: Yes Sir!
Greenviper: Oh for Melrin’s sake, not like that!
Greenviper: I don’t know you.
Ginny: Lol Talk to my twat of a brother. If I say something, it’s a ‘thing.’ If you say something – it’s gospel.
Ron: Oh god… it’s started!
Prongs: I took a peak at the tooth fairy.
Greenviper: The house, the crup, gnome infestations.
Greenviper: Stop that, you’ll give me a boner.
Draco: "I want you to say it."
Ginny: Wouldn’t I, though.
“You should have told me sooner,” Harry said, wincing at how accusatory the words sounded in his voice.
“If you’ll excuse me,” Malfoy said, getting up from his seat. “I’m going to talk to the sommelier about a wine I don’t see on the menu.”
“You are not a werewolf and if you were, I would make sure you took the potion to suppress it just like your Dad. You would never be a monster and the kids – some of the
Harry: Fine. Wait, come on Gin.
Ginny: Pansy’s looking to get into styling as well, but she needs to acquire a client base first. So I was hoping you would let her style you for the ball and you could tell it to the press when they ask?
Padma: He owns another property but the address is private in his file.
Harry: I hate this.
Greenviper: You’re aware it’s considered rude to have your phone out on a date.
Sorry for the late update, the Beta and I were both traveling last week and didn't have time to fic. This chapter is twice as long, however, so you can't be too mad!
Speaking of looks…
Ginny: Leaky. Your tab.
Greenviper: And I never said I didn’t want a relationship. That’s the thing with you bloody Gryffindors, you plopped on this earth severely lacking the critical thinking skills necessary to see a view different than your own. Not all of us jump head first into heartbreak without looking back and that’s ok, Prongs.
Harry: "Hello?"
Prongs: Fuck … I just made eye-contact with him.
Is the ceiling too much?
Hermione: We can’t all show up and bombard him.
Greenviper: I don’t recall.
Welcome back Harry!
How didu no
Harry: Pub? Need a drink.
“Muggle p-protections,” Harry panted out between breaths, trying to pull some sensibility out of the depths on his desire, “on the house?”
Hermione: Yes. That’s first place we checked.
Draco: "Shame."
Ginny: Oh no. What happened with Hydra?
Prongs: Don’t sound so surprised.
Harry: Are plucking and shaving ok? Threading? Hair removal potion?!?! I need to know!
Ron: HELP!!!
Greenviper: I thought it was clear that I no longer had any interest in continued correspondence with you. See: ‘have a nice life.’ You fucked up, Prongs. Move along.
Ron: Filthy Rotten Traitor!
Prongs: He speaks.
Prongs: Yes and no. She’s still one of my best mates but it sort of messed me up at the time.  I wasn’t really in a great place after the war and she got me through it… She also went about some things the wrong way.
Patientpuff: Lol it means House? Sex? Potter era?
Hermione: Fine.
Harry: Just in it for the money, are you?
Hermione: Hush, Ronald. I politely sit across the dinner table from Percy every week and it was he who stood by the ministry while they were stripping muggle-borns of their wands. People change.
Neville: Give me a sign of life.
Ginny: Of course I like having sex with men, Harry? YOU of all people should know that? :b
Parvati: Lavender stopped taking Wolfsbane for a year and almost got herself arrested.
Prongs:
A lot of you asked me for an update when I started posting the Ginsy companion piece, well chapter one is up! It is a story about how Pansy and Ginny get together and will eventually overlap with the Howlr plotline, so you'll get a bit of Howlr from Draco's pov. This is a quick preview, if you like it check out the rest
Harry: I’m not. I’m helping Mrs. Weasley in the kitchen all day. I gave you the address, didn’t I? Just text when you’re outside.
Harry: I’m really Sorry, Gin. I don’t know what to say.
HARRY
Draco: "Randy little prat then, aren’t you? I’d suggest calming down. I’m in the mood to take things slow.  I start with your face. I trace each plain with a light hand."
Greenviper: One of them.
Harry: “So close.”
Pansy: I assume money is not a factor.
Draco: Do we need a little refresher on the definition of the word persuade?
Prongs: It’s like 9am.
Greenviper: You’re an idiot.
Greenviper: I was under the impression that you liked them mean.
Prongs: ‘Come for me, Hydra’
Greenviper: You know, an open-mind extends in all directions.
“We’re going to fuck,” Draco said, decisively. He climbed on the bed, straddled Harry’s waist and began unbuttoning his shirt at the same time. “I don’t care which way we do it,” he continued, “but it’s happening. Right now.”
Greenviper: I don’t know what you want me to say? He was a horrendous man, if you could even call him a man. He did heinous things.
And what Harry lacked in finesse, he made up for in sheer need, for when his lips finally met Malfoy’s after all those years, he thought he’d die if he couldn’t have more. He had never felt anything like it; being so desperate for something while it was actually happening. It was like being on his Firebolt and missing flying or craving Indian while eating curry; it didn’t make any sense, but it didn’t have to because he was kissing Malfoy.
Prongs: Sorry. Did I overstep?
Harry: Why are you on Howlr? You and Parkinson break up again?
Greenviper: Everything about ^ message is embarrassing for you.
“Professor Lupin’s son, yes,” Harry sighed.  “Is that going to be a problem?”
You’ll be so close we won’t have to text. I’ll be able to whisper directly into your ear.
Prongs: You had to be there.
Greenviper: Technically, so is he.
Greenviper: If you could see me, you’d agree.
Harry made sure to make a big production of opening his own menu and began his search for the perfect dish that would wipe that smug smile right off Malfoy’s frustratingly attractive face.
Ginny: Fuck off, Ron.
“That was hours ago,” Harry said confidently, “I’ve had enough time now.” He gave Draco a smile he hoped was in the same Portkey zone as charming. “The idea of us is so old hat it could practically sort itself.” Draco chuckled.
Wait what?
Potter, get back here!
Prongs: YES! And until a few minutes ago, I was sure you hadn’t either.
Screenname: Greenviper
Prongs: Ha ha. I already put a couple galleons under his pillow.
Draco growled, taking his thumb back and capturing Harry in a fierce kiss.
Harry: Ha Ha
Ron: WHY? The prat was a Death Eater! For fucks sakes, Harry.
Draco: “I’ll come to yours in about an hour and we can floo over together, yes?”
Ron: God, I love you.
Harry: Me too. He’s always sending me pictures of muggle shit and asking me what it does.
McGonagall: "Good. Contact me if there are any mishaps." *Pause* "Potter?"
Harry: Ginny, you know I avoid press like the plague at these things. It’s never just one question!
“Figure that out, Potter,” Draco tapped a finger on Harry’s chest, “and I’ll fuck you.”
Mr. Brewer: "I just turned forty, it’s too late to start my life over."
Gran would be so proud.
Harry: Don’t tell me what to do. I’m a grown up.
Mr. Brewer: "M-miss Granger, I had no idea."
“So the kids at school
Draco: "Valiant effort, alas –"
Greenviper: Patience, I’m thinking.
Another blow landed, this time Harry couldn’t hold back a grunt.
Harry: Well, stop it. You’re scaring the children.
Prongs: Holy shit.
“Yes, that is what a Gryffindor would do.”
Greenviper: Light on the compassion.
Harry’s insides did a nervous flutter, thinking about doing that in front of Draco. It was much too early in this relationship for Draco to hear him sing. In fact, on their joint deathbed after seventy blissful years of marriage it would still be too soon. It wasn’t that he necessarily had a bad voice, it was just that Harry didn’t know because he didn’t sing in front of anyone excluding Teddy. Well, and sometimes Ginny but once you watch your girlfriend take six shots of fire whiskey in a row then attempt to deep throat you in the nearest loo only to vomit her burrito bowl all over your dick, you lose the ability to be embarrassed in front of her.
Prongs: Damn it.
Ron: Wth?
Harry: "Are you ok? You sound weird. Did I say something?"
Harry: Uh, you weren’t here when I woke up this morning.
“Draco, he’s five,” Harry chimed.
Shit. Sorry, wrong person.
Prongs: Looking for a Scottish slag on the side. Someone to warm my frigid bed whilst we’re apart. Neville’s already turned me down, see.
“Come on, Boy Wonder,” Draco goaded, “I know you can fit it all in that smart mouth of yours.” Harry shook his head, eyes watering from the strain on his jaw. It wasn’t possible, his mouth was full to breaking and there was still a whole quarter a towel left.
Neville: Don’t forget you have an appointment with McGonagall at 12:30 to go over the agenda. You can’t be late, Harry, you’re already on thin ice with her.
Ginny: "I’m not getting up at the arse crack of dawn to see a frogfish, Harry. Period."
Harry: I know you all think I talk about him too much but the best thing just happened. I think I might cry!
Prongs: Oh, alright. Later then.
Greenviper: I’m curious.
It’s the middle of the work day.
Draco: Don’t forget PTSD!
Greenviper: I’m serious.
Harry:
“I wasn’t worried,” Malfoy spat defensively, though Harry did notice his expression soften. “Salazar, the size of your ego tonight.”
Ron: Yeah, talk to us mate!
Harry: Not really. You always crave sweets during training.
McGonagall: Something like sending the phrase “cock it all up” in a message sent to the witch that employs you to teach children.
Ginny: You made plans with him, didn’t you?
Ginny: RUDE!
Harry: You think it’s been ‘hard’ on me? You can’t even begin to imagine what this feels like. They all leave me. My parents, Sirius, Dumbledore. Fuck, even Hedwig. Every time I start to feel like I’ve finally got a family, it gets taken away from me.
Draco: "Are you always like this?"
Ginny: Harry…no!
Harry: Pansy Parkinson?
Ginny: Nothing personal, Grang. Collateral damage.
Pansy: You’re full of it. This has nothing to do with me or Draco and you know it.
Greenviper: You are easily impressed.
Greenviper: You would.
“So you regret getting to know Hydra, then?” Malfoy pushed, looking, for lack of a better word, terrified of the answer.
Screenname: Prongs
Greenviper: No. You didn’t.
“But I don’t understand, why are the Veela and the werewolf fighting in the first place?” Draco questioned, attempting to have a logic based conversation with a five-year old. “I’m pretty sure they don’t even occupy the same re - “
Are you still at Hogwarts?
In my defense, it’s hard to cook with a five-year-old running around.
Ginny: Sure. I was meant to be getting drinks with George, anyway. I’ve told him he can come along and that you’ll be paying his tab as well.
“For breakfast?” Harry shook his head. “Yeah, I don’t think so. They’re in a bag on the counter, you can take them with you.” He gave his ex a disapproving sidelong glance, “I’m sure Ginny with let you have one as soon as I’m out of earshot.”
Ginny: You’re not so bad on a date, Harry. I mean that. You’re funny and cute when you’re nervous. Just don’t do that thing you do with your ice.
Ginny: Everyone’s already said they’d come, so you can’t back out now.
Greenviper: Fuck. Why did I just tell you that?
Prongs: Oh Viper u rembered!
Hermione: Are you going to be ok, Harry? If we move out?
Draco: "You’ve just felt a little surreal. This… Even if I’m not hearing the real you, this feels good."
Harry: I never do.
Draco: "Salazar. Go with the convention, Prongs."
Your Profile
Greenviper: Oh, almost forgot, do us both a favor and wear something presentable. It’d be dreadfully anticlimactic if you turned up looking like a troll.
Greenviper: Sorry, I went to brunch.
Harry: It’s cute.
Ron: So her Royal Highness of Lesbos graces us with her presence for the first time in weeks and she gets to pick the menu? We all know you’re only here because your gfs out of town.
Harry: I know it’s kind of crazy but I have the first two weeks of evening patrols when Hogwarts starts back up in a couple weeks and I just want to make sure we give this a proper go before it fizzles or something.
Neville: We’ll always have the prophet.
Prongs: Open it, open it, open it!!!!
Greenviper: To be plain, I didn’t think you had it in you.
Draco: "I believe that’s how I said it worked, yes."
Draco: We’re not doing this.
Prongs: Hydra…
Ron: We went there earlier… you were there.
Harry: No problem.
Harry: *Grumbles* Thank you.
Ginny: I was trying something out. Still too soon?
WARNING: This chapter is much longer and much smuttier than most chapters. There is Dom/Sub content as well. You have been warned. Oh, and you might need this at some point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50Qo62s8QNg
Harry: Hermione told you?
Ginny: Shut the fuck up. You would not! That was the best month of your life. The tour was only two weeks. You were fine.
Ginny: Excuse me?
Harry: Nobody else was… you know what that means.
Thanks again, Harry.
Greenviper: Just this once.
Harry: Hey, I know this is your lunch break but I really need some of your magic. Neville and I have been trying to get a hold of this band Casting Castles that’s supposed to be performing for the ball but they’ve been giving us the runaround. Their twat of a manager just gives one word responses and that’s if he decides to pick up at all.
Draco: "It’s actually ‘Hydra,’ but ‘God’ works too."
Harry: Can we go talk about this in another room. Not on this bloody device.
Ginny: Fuck yes!
McGonagall: I’ve just found a child’s stuffed Hippogriff in my office. I assume it belongs to you.
Neville: Still in poor taste, I think.
Harry: Oh god! It’s going to be horrible.
Harry: Your friend is a murderer!
Did you tell the others about it?
“Sorry, Draco,” Harry stammered. He ran a sweaty palm through his hair. His cheeks warmed and he felt  like an oversensitive git for getting so worked up over nothing. His heart was still racing and his mind hadn’t quite stopped coming up with escape plans but it was only Draco, he reminded himself. One more time for good measure – It. Was. Draco.
Harry: How’d you find out?
“I want you to count them,” Draco instructed. Harry nodded, eager for the next blow. When it came, Harry bit back a moan, he could take more than this. Draco could hit him harder. Harry wanted him to work for every sound he made, wanted him to earn his obedience. If there’s one thing Harry learned from switching, it was that the sub had all the control and he planned to take full advantage of that power.
His wand flew to his hand before he had time to think of the spell. He planted himself firmly between the fireplace and the hall that led to Teddy. He didn’t have time for a full on duel. He would have do a stunner, grab Teddy and apparate them to Godric’s –
Draco: I most certainly would not like. Did you splinch your brain in apparition?
Prongs: Hey Hydra
Ron: True.
Prongs: No. Just don’t be surprised when I return the favor. Sarcasm is my parseltongue – skill acquired at birth.
Ginny: Did.
The room will be nice. Neville will bring plants. Draco will terrorize the staff!
Prongs: Then let go of your cock. You don’t get to come until I tell you you can.
” Harry didn’t mean it to come out like that. As if  the idea of Malfoy repulsed him to his very core but it sounded it anyway and he didn’t know how to take back the intention of words that he meant.
Harry: Sorry mate, can’t pass up the opportunity to defy gender roles and shit on the innate binary of the traditional wedding ceremony.
Ron: But you’ve got to know to help me.
“Now you get the light system,” Draco bit. “Color?”
“Fuck. God. Draco, I’m go – “Draco squeezed the base of his cock again and Harry almost sobbed.
Harry: Yes...two…that’s the reasonable number I have. :/
Ron: Bloody hell, Mum would adopt you if she could.
Sorry, that was a joke.
Prongs: Yes…
Harry: You get so Northern when you’re upset. Like, even over text.
Harry: "A fourth year, trying to score a lush date to the Yule Ball? Yes."
Greenviper: So when do I get to see you again?
Ron: …
Prongs: Much better!
He spread his legs wider, trying to spur Draco on without having to say it.
Ginny: "Hush you. Hiya Ted!"
Prongs: I’m the gayer twin.
Harry: Or she wanted to not serve anyone all night and just talk to your incredible arse!
Ron: We’re all missing the big picture here, yeah. Harry is the Malfoy expert. I’m pretty sure he’d know if he’d been flirting with him since June.
Harry: Fair.
Greenviper: How do you know my house?
“No actually,” Harry responded. And went on to tell Malfoy the story of when he’d walked into McGonagall’s office disillusioned with the Aurors and displeased with his future prospects, and walked out the newly appointed flying instructor for Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Greenviper: Which pub?
Prongs: Mmmm, scrummy.
Draco: "Sorry, sometimes I bite."
Greenviper: Don’t make me block you.
Patientpuff: I’d probably say ‘Hi’ cus they’re still people right?
“Da-ad,” Teddy whined, “Why aren’t you singing.”
McGonagall: In that case, perhaps you could repay me by changing my contact title in your Spellular to something more appropriate. I am your boss not a part of your squad, you’ll do well to remember.
Harry: "I…uh… Just needed to discuss delivery and setup for your decorations."
“Draco, I don’t care.” He made to pull him towards him again.
Harry: Fuck. Sorry, I had to put down my phone. I was in a meeting. I didn't mean it in that way, Draco. I just meant that I want to spend as much time as possible with you before my life gets crazy. I DON’T want this to fizzle. I’m having fun. Aren’t you having fun?
Greenviper: What? I said it was considerate, didn’t I?
Hermione: Come on, we should be able to discuss this as civilized adults.
Draco: "Mind healers everywhere marvel at why I put up with you."
Ron: Mione’s scared of Mum.
Prongs: Yes, actually!
Tell me how it feels.
Hermione: Harry, just do it.
Greenviper: You can’t owl-post your purchases after each store.
Screenname: Parkbench
Greenviper: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Harry: Well now that you have, kindly move along and forget this Spelluar address.
This is what you’re wearing.
Greenviper: In the future, if you happen upon a stroke of good fortune, we will be at our wedding and I’ll read this conversation aloud, in the presence of all our friends and family, so they’ll all know you ruined this moment.
They sat in their respective seats, alternating between making darting eye-contact with each other and feigning interest in the other couples around them. Harry’s saving grace was the fact that this would make a wonderful story to tell Teddy one day when he had a first crush. ‘It was the most awkward date of my life,’ he’d tell the boy. ‘I liked the way his lips formed words,’ he might keep to himself.
Prongs: When we talk, we fight. Besides, this is already helping.
Harry: It’s alright. At least you’re nice to look at.
Ron: Oh God!
Yeah, she passed out on the couch about an hour ago.
Hermione: Christ! I’ve just considered he’s a Weasley. What if we get married and he thinks that means I want to have kids right away? I don’t want kids yet. I am on track for Minister for Magic and I’m not going to have that derailed by a load of ginger spawn.
Harry: WTH!! DRACO DOESN’T MIND?
Prongs: Virtual admirer? Is that what I am? I mean I could be your boyfriend but apparently that would ‘ruin’ things.
Ron: HARRY YOU FORGOT THE BADGE!?!
Hermione: If you’re sure. That just leaves, Nott, Bassenthwaite and Morcott.
Prongs: *Blushes* Stop that. Answer the question.
Prongs: Shocker.
“I have no idea what you’re – “
Hermione: So, Bassenthwaite just showed up with his husband.
Harry: You should have told me this in person so I could kiss you.
Draco: No, that wasn’t an attempt at macabre humor. I really need you to be more specific.
Ginny: ;)
Greenviper: Thank, Salazar.
Ron: I know you’re going through something right now but watch your fucking mouth, yeah?
Prongs: That’s just her personality. You have nothing to worry about, she’s the gayer twin.
Greenviper: Yes, I remember you mentioning your family was homophobic as well.
Harry: Teddy is my everything! We were watching the Series of Unfortunate Events movie, he turns to me and says “It’s good, I guess, but it would be better if it was like the books.”
Draco: Likely story.
Ron: NO!
Greenviper: You must be the Ex.
Prongs: You see the incredible ginger-soy salmon I made for dinner and fall in love with me?
Draco: "Not of little old me, I hope?"
Ron: I hope you’re talking about me.
Harry: Who is this? How did you get this number?
Harry: Right, yeah, I think I can do this.
“That’s what a
Prongs: My trusting demeanor and irresistible charms.
Prongs: Ha. Guilty.
Prongs: I’m done talking to you.
Dean: And when Seamus set his mum’s house on fire.
Harry’s body jolted awake. He swiped his glasses from the nightstand, shoved them on, then patted at his bed in search for his wand, but  found two warm, sleeping bodies instead. He hummed pleasantly, remembering vaguely who those bodies belonged to. He blinked twice, so his eyes could catch up with his limbs. Ginny Weasley was leaning against his bedroom door frame, arms crossed and looking the picture of irritation.
I fucked you like I’m falling in fucking love with you. Like I’ve been in love with at least four different versions of you all ready.
Greenviper: Too much?
Greenviper: The Hostess is back, I’m letting her take me to our table. It’s in the corner by the window. If you’d like to escape, this would be the time to do it.
Ginny: I mean, honestly, first Dean, now Neville. Which one of my ex’s are you going to bugger next?
Prongs: Who is the fittest bloke at this ball?
Greenviper: I haven’t.
Harry: Hey, I’m trying to help YOU!
Prongs: What about all your intellectual bullshit about being self-aware and seeing things from all sides? Like you have some moral superiority over the rest of us and you just wanted to make yourself feel better! I mean you’re very clever, that part’s not a lie. You really know how to talk around who you really are.
Harry: Ginny was over last night.
Harry looked down at the ukulele making sure his fingers were in all the right places and started strumming the intro. This was their nightly routine when Teddy stayed with him so Harry could play the song with his eyes-closed, but somehow the presence of Draco Malfoy made his fingers clumsy and unnecessarily slippery, so he fumbled a bit. Never enough to mess up the overall construction of the melody or to damper Teddy’s experience, but Harry still felt the color of the Gryffindor common room by the time he was supposed to sing.
Ginny: You had fun! You got to hang out with Ron and George the whole time.
“Sorry,” Draco groaned, sitting up and pressing buttons on his Spellular. He rubbed a hand across his face, tiredly. Harry tried to pull Draco back to him. “No, Potter, I really have to go. Now I have to shower again before my interview.”
Prongs: What’s that supposed to mean?
Prongs: No. My hands would be too busy.
Neville: A Time-Turner.
Option two.
Blaise
Prongs: Granger things have happened.
Prongs: I’m just surprised. I thought this conversation was going to a very different place.
Draco: I don’t have daddy issues.
Greenviper: Tsk tsk. So shallow, Prongs. What would Godric say?
Teddy – It’s just like a normal party but everybody’s pretty.”
Hermione: "I’m sure you didn’t. And its Ms. Granger – Ms. I could have sworn I heard ‘Miss’ but perhaps it’s me that needs to check my connection."
“Potter what – “
Let me sit down.
“Malfoy!” Harry anxiously looked over his shoulder to see if anyone had heard. He could feel his cheeks flaming and he wished to Merlin they would stop. He also wished he could stop thinking about that night Malfoy was referencing and all the other great nights he’d spent chatting with Hydra.
Greenviper: I would be surprised if you managed that with this particular conversation.
Ginny: I need a favor.
See the lengths I go to get you back? I’d grown accustomed to my virtual admirer.
Ginny: Booooo!
Ron: ‘EGGSactly.’
Prongs: Uhh, curry take-away from down the street.
Harry: "Pretty please, Hydra, will you fuck me?"
Greenviper: And the title of Sass Queen truly belongs to _
“They were starving me,” he said flatly.  Ginny caught the pillow easily, crawled across the bed and hit Harry square in the face with it. Teddy cackled.
Harry: I’ll make it up to you?
Prongs: I don’t want us seeing other people.
Harry: But he’s being such a prat right now!
Greenviper: Yes, sir.
Harry: NOPE.
Harry: Might do.
Harry: "Yup, yup, a bunch of things I don’t understand. Hermione’s got it."
Hermione: At the risk of stating the obvious, this could be dangerous, Harry. Though, true, I believe people can change it would be wise to err on the side of caution moving forward.
Ginny: Skip to the important part. It’s too early for this shit.
Ginny: What else is new.
Draco: You fucked me to Australia and back, Potter. Of course I enjoyed myself.
Harry: Where are you?
Draco: What am I meant to wear to this party tomorrow?
Prongs: Have you opened it yet?
Ginny: xx
Are we really doing this?
Greenviper: You’re smarter than you write.
Toad.
“Your handwriting,” Malfoy said simply. Harry waited for him to go on. “There were notes in the margins of the books, remember?” Malfoy met his eyes then and, though Harry was wholly unprepared for fierce grey being thrust upon him, he did not move. “You wrote a letter to the Wizengamot,” he went on, “a plea to clear Mother and myself of our crimes in the war. You must have known they wouldn’t refuse you…” He petered off and Harry waited. There was a living silence between them in the busy restaurant, almost as if, if Harry dared to breathe too loudly, he’d never get the chance to hear what Malfoy said next.
– “your –”
Prongs: You’re about to burst into song.
Greenviper: What needs telling, Prongs?
Draco: Now you’re just giving me ideas.
“Sush, I’ve singing to do,” Harry proclaimed. Teddy clapped his hands excitedly.
Harry: I move into Hogwarts on Tuesday.
Harry: Sorry.
Prongs: So if not a daddy kink, what kinks do you have?
Harry: I do not.
Harry: How did you know?
Ron: Bloody hell, not this again. So he was staring at Harry, what’s else is new? He was probably plotting something. Hermione, YOU were clearly staring at Malfoy! Are you telling me you fancy the ferret?
Ginny: No can do, Harry, dear. You asked, I listened, I PROMISED. I couldn’t possibly go back on my word.
Ron: We’re certainly not moving out now! He just wants the place empty so he can fuck the ferret.
Prongs: Nice try.
Harry: Hermione, do you love him?
Harry: Huh? What if I called them “father” issues?
Ginny: Oh yeah.
Ginny: "What are you two up to?"
Hermione: Oh god, I’m so nervous! What if we ARE too young? What if all that tripe I’ve been feeding Ron is true?
Prongs: Sure. Fine. Whatever you say. You’ll just have to forgive me, I thought we were passed that.
Ginny: Fantastic. You’re still like this.
Harry: I don’t appreciate your tone.
Prongs: Ok, tell it to me straight.
Greenviper: Yes. Just put it in your ear.
Greenviper: You know what? You clearly grew up in the muggle world and had access to an LGBT community that doesn’t yet exist in the wizarding world. I’m a pureblood, I can’t just look things up on the enterpet device. I didn’t even know what ‘pan’ meant. I had to message three different friends and my ex. You are a judgmental arsehole. Have a nice life!
Prongs: Alright, then.
Greenviper: No. You never are, are you?
“Draco,“ he asked, his name a question.

“Fuuuck,” he called like prayer. His head swung up, back arching in the process, like he’d reached some sort of higher plane, his orgasm frozen in time. And that’s what it felt like, too, Draco fucking him through it, singing his praises.
Pansy: I’ll send over some look options in a bit.
Ron: Wouldn’t that be a headline: The boy who lived for justice and died for a shag.
“We made eye-contact at the ball,” Malfoy pressed. “You knew it was me.”
Harry: Draco.
Prongs: Please don’t do this.
Greenviper: I do not gush.
Ginny: *Singing: delightfully on key* Harry and Mal-foy romp-ing wil-low. Slytherin spunk left on your pil-low. *big finish (pun intended)*
“You just – “Malfoy repeated impatiently, “want to hex my bollocks off? Want to be friends?”
Hermione: Pansy’s rubbing off on you.
Draco: Kitchen. I volunteered to help Mrs. Weasley re-plate and serve the second round of starters.
, is standing outside your door, not near above begging you to let me in.”
Hermione:  Do you think he’ll like it?
Ginny: Brilliant!
Greenviper: Are we alright?
Harry: Moving on… The queer male Slytherins from our year are Theodore Nott and Blaise Zabini. Blaise is pretty openly pansexual, though. So that just leaves Nott.
Greenviper: Are you SURE you’re a wizard? Honestly, it’s a wonder they allow you to function without assistance.
Pansy: No, you’re trying to get your dick wet.
Draco: “Harry -”
Harry: "God!"
“Fuck, Potter” Malfoy breathed, moving in on Harry’s mouth again. This time, Malfoy decided slow was fine as long as it was accompanied by maneuvers with his tongue Harry felt ought be labeled dark magic. The hold Malfoy had on Harry’s throat seemed to tighten with his enthusiasm and Harry was so hard the slightest breeze could tip him over the edge.
Ron: DRACO!?!!?
GINSY: I AM writing the Ginny/Pansy companion piece, so please look out for that! It will be from Pansy's perspective and will cover before, during and after the Howlr timeline. I will post a preview at the end of this fic when it's ready or you can follow me here or on Tumblr (http://partialtopotter.tumblr.com/) for updates!
Greenviper: Something like that.
Greenviper: Any loose teeth?
Harry: *Side eye*
the way I did with Hydra then…then I was ruined. Then…There’s nobody else for me, Draco … You are everything I’ve ever wanted. *Hysterical chuckle* and we’ve technically been dating a week. So that’s like defeating-the-Dark-Lord fucking terrifying.”
Draco: "Drink it and I’ll show you."
Ginny: I assure you, I am ignorant to what you are referring.
Hermione: That narrows it down to four options. That’s not so bad.
Harry: …YES.
Prongs: 8-----> ‘,
Ginny: Mates, if you’re at Harry’s party then it is up to us to make sure he gets brilliantly pissed tonight! I don’t EVER want to see him without a drink in hand and I don’t want him paying for one either. He saved you lot, show some respect!
Prongs: You’ve never even said you like me back.
Greenviper: Less like a hippogriff, for a start.
Draco: I can wait.
“I’ll do the five questions then,” Teddy consented, “But – I get to ask Draco and you,” he dragged the word out, making it sound like three syllables instead of one, “still have to do the song!”
Harry: “Right o.”
Then Draco took hold of Harry’s leather jacket, relished the feel of the material in his hands, and removed Harry Potter from his front door.
we’ll go inside.” Harry took a deep, laborious breath.
“Really?” Draco had opened his mouth to say more but Ginny cut him off. “What is it you’re doing now,
Neville: Cheers.
Draco: “Delightful.”
Prongs: No. I think you have to be joking.
Harry: "It’s not that late."
Prongs: Oooh I know this one…
that morning Sybil said there was bad hair in my future." *sniffles* "Sorry Harry, working the ball has brought back all these old feelings. You were saying?"
Arthur: Don’t forget the nail glue.

Prongs: Don’t be cross. It’s cute.
Pansy: The halfwit told Draco their relationship was fizzling.
Draco: Weasel offspring are referred to as kittens. Read. A. Book.
Prongs: Oh, you’re serious?
What have I done?
Ron: Let. It. Go.
Prongs: Shit. I’m sorry. I have a really short fuse when it comes to prejudice and sometimes I assume the worst. I guess you can say I’m not quite over the war.
“Sweet pea, apple of my eye,” he sang anyway, “don’t know where and I don’t know why. You’re the only reason, I keep on coming home.” Teddy smiled, temple to temple, head and feet bobbing in different directions as Harry played.
Ron: What did you say?
Harry: Right. We’re on our way.
Thank you all for your REVIEWS, LOVE and PATIENCE! I do this for you all and the response has been amazing so far! I could not be happier!! :)
Harry: I think you’re overestimating my power, but I’ll try.
Greenviper: I’ll stop responding again.
Harry: Across the room to your left.
Mr. Brewer: "Look lady –"
sliding his fingers into the fine, white silk that was Malfoy’s hair.
Draco: So, you’ll consider it?
Harry heard a loud thunk come from the direction of his bedroom. Great!
Prongs: Truly.  It’s perfection.
Ginny: You know what time it is?
“So, your godson,” began Draco, “he’s –“
Ginny: What’s that in your hand?
Greenviper: Yes, Prongs?
Draco: Three nights in a row, Potter?
1. Roses are red, violets are blue
“Wait,” Harry said, throwing his hand out into the space between him and Malfoy as if the action would stop the other man from speaking. “I just need some time to think.” Of course, no such silencing gesture existed where Malfoy was concerned. If it had, Harry would have used it somewhere between, ‘My father told me all Weasleys’ and ‘I’ve got to do it.’
Pansy: Obviously. And don’t shave, you look good with a bit of stubble.
Prongs: Kiss arse.
“Hmm?”
Prongs: Right. You don’t know that there’s limited jobs in the wizarding world? Even fewer that leave you famous?
Prongs: Hah! I knew that one.
Prongs: LOL. It’s not a dick pic!!!
Ginny: Shot-o-clock!
“Don’t be so sensitive, Potter,” Malfoy replied haughtily. Harry waited for the usual fury that came with the Slytherin being obnoxious, but amusement was the only emotion that surfaced. “I am not rude,” he finished with a pout.
Harry: No, no, certainly not practical, but you know what it will be?  Fun!
George: Challenge accepted.
Theo: No. Haven’t you been reading, Hero Boy? I’m also in it for the free press.
Theo: I saw it in the paper but I wouldn’t believe it unless I saw it with my own eyes.
Mr. Brewer: "Oh that."
Harry: *Long groan* "Shit I’m going to – Ohhhh My – FUCK!"
Ron: Yeah right, mate.
Hermione: "Yes, that."
Prongs: Well then what are we doing here? We’ve talked almost every day for over a month. We’re compatible in more ways than one, yet you don’t want to meet? How the hell am I supposed to take that?
Harry: “Draco!”
Ginny: Idk. Why don’t you tell me when Malfoy puts out.
“Well,” Draco said, sounding like he was preparing himself for a big speech, “what is interesting about these two particular creatures is that they both spend the majority of their time in human form, a Veela only transforming when angry and a Werewolf ideally only during a full moon. With those parameters in mind it would seem that the Veela has more of an advantage because it would only have to catch the werewolf on a non-turning day.” Teddy’s shoulders sank with disappointment.
Harry: Hint: tall, dark … poisonous.
Hermione: "I’m hearing past tense."
“My mistake,” Harry said with a knowing smile.
“DRACO LEAVE, DRACO LEAVE,” they both jumped, the alarm obliterating their peace. “YOU NEED TO BE AN ADULT AND GET READY”
“Right,” Harry said numbly. “Well, my aunt and uncle used to force me to cook for them. That’s how I learned. And with them it was the same rotation of ten or so different meals: pot roast, Yorkshire pudding, Chicken Tikka Masala,” Harry looked up to see if Malfoy was still listening. He had the other wizard’s rapt and undivided attention. “I love to cook, I just – I can’t get into another rotation like that again.”
Pansy: Well, I’m at Draco’s so you’ll have to wait.
Prongs: I know right?!?! It’s distracting. Was he your ‘Hogwarts enemy?’
“Don’t you start,” he warned, turning the look to Harry, “And you don’t get to interrupt, ok?”
“I’m taking the rest of this pizza, too,” Ginny shouted from the kitchen.
Harry: You guys want to know something weird?
Greenviper: I don’t judge what you do on your lunch break.
Harry: Ron…buddy
Dean: Sure
Harry: You’re more than welcome to come check, if you’d like?
Your Profile
Fresh
“Sorry,” Harry stammered,  “you just sound so much like how he writes.”
“You’re my cousin!” Teddy burst. Draco blinked back at him, only managing a stilted nod.
? To the confession, to the uncharacteristic sincerity, to the traces of longing Harry wished didn’t feel so relatable. Harry motioned for the bartender, silently ordering them another set of drinks. Neither of them dared speak until they arrived.
Neville: Loads of fun! And sentimental.
Draco: ‘Hm?’
Draco: “Yes, Potter, it’s his day. Give the child what he wants! It’s not as if you can’t afford it.”
Greenviper: Lucky you.
Mr. Weasley: Molly wanted me to make sure you and Teddy were coming round for dinner Sunday.
Prongs: Do you actually regret it?
She eyed Teddy, who was contently curled into Draco’s chest. His hair was a lighter pink this morning, not it’s usual vibrant hue. It was so light, in fact, Harry thought it could have been white.
“So,” Teddy said, ignoring Harry completely, “what are your in- in,” he screwed up his face in concentration as he struggled with the difficult word. “In-ten-chuns with my Dad?”
Greenviper: Is that what you would do if you were here. Spank me?
Harry: *Hermione voice* Ginevra…
Prongs: Slide your hands slowly up your chest. Feel every inch of yourself. Play with your nipples until you squirm, then pinch them until you scream. That’s what I would do if I were there. You’ve promised beauty and I have a feeling you’re not exaggerating. I bet I get hard just looking at you.
Ginny: Someone has to love you before they put up with you doing that over dinner.
Draco: "I slide two fingers into the knuckle." *Whimpering* "I go right to the place I know will – FUCKING HUH f-fuck!"
Harry: If you can tease, I can tease.

Harry: Could you sign one of your old jerseys and donate it to the Hogwarts ball as a raffle prize? Pretty please?!?
Prongs: Very.
Pansy: Oh, certainly, the ball’s only tomorrow but please take all the time in the world doing whatever it is Potters do.
“Umm,” he stammered, “change of subject, please.” Malfoy gave a curt nod, picked up his menu and gave Harry a pleasant smile.
Prongs: Your profile also made me laugh.  True story?
A bit of Ogden’s just before you leave does the trick, as well.
Prongs: Accio my love!
Prongs: I’m glad.
Ron: Ugh…fine!
Ginny: Have any of you seen Pansy? She’s been gone for a while?
What have I ever done on a date ever before? This sucks, why do people do it?
Ron: Good call.  Spare her her feelings. ;) we know the truth.
Prongs: HAHA really?
Hermione: I thought it was odd, but did a fastening spell and let it go. Then I found a stain on my prefect’s badge.
Prongs: My screenname works so easily. You get to call me ‘Prongs’ but what do I call you? Green? Viper? If I call you Viper, you have to own a leather jacket. It’s a rule.
Ginny: Yeah, don’t be so bloody selfish.
Harry: "I really like it!"
Draco: "Did you just go primal on me?"
Hermione: Good point.  Harry, would you mind cross referencing how you flirt with Hydra with how you flirt with Malfoy in your fantasies and see if there’s any overlap?
Harry: "You know what I mean. My - my"
Draco: "I linger on your lips with two fingers. Huh uh … so soft, it almost feels like a kiss."
Harry: Hahaha Kidding. Kind of. What am I supposed to do about it?
Greenviper: I’m surprised you do.
Greenviper: ‘I’m going to come.’
Greenviper: And I’d stun the Weasley.
Prongs: My arse.
A swirl of facts and feelings warred inside Harry, each demanding to be heard but he didn’t have time for that because Malfoy was going to leave and if he left that was it? If Malfoy walked out that door, there was no salvaging this. There was no Hydra or companionship or any of it. The thought seemed almost too much to bare.
Ginny: Uhh, course I am.
Ginny: Perfect. Cause I need you to DO something.
Greenviper: Splendid. I accept offerings in the form of well-lit dick pics.
Draco: Who is conveniently not in attendance this evening, yes.
Greenviper: Right, technically you will.
Draco placed a soft, but painful, pat on the right side of Harry’s mouth.
Lavender: "Yes, that’s it."
Prongs: U DO HAVE A DADDY KINK!
Harry: Nope. Take this fight to a private chat.
Draco: “Don’t forget to comb your hair.”
Harry: You can do that?!?
Harry: I hate you! Why would you do that to me? You didn't need to take it there!
Greenviper: Did your friend actually do it?
Andromeda: Harry, where are you? I’m getting anxious.
I love you all,
Ron: You still like me better though, yeah?
Greenviper: Are you going to make me ask?
Teddy: *Whining* “But it’s my day!”
Neville: We are not dendrophiliacs!
Prongs: Talks about me a lot, huh?
Ron: Clock it at 7 minutes.
Hermione: Ginny, why?!?!!?!
Theo: I would be annoyed but I know how long you’ve wanted this! Have you told him of your string of doppelgangers? Never let it be said that Draco Malfoy doesn’t have a type. Could be the fittest bloke in the world but if he doesn’t have green eyes and the inability to use a comb…
Prongs: OH MY GOD! Where are you? I’m worried about you.
Harry: This morning Teddy asked me if he could call me ‘Dad.’ Am I a terrible person for loving it?
“Will it be a book or questions?” Harry asked. Teddy sighed, throwing his body against his Holyhead Harpies blanket as if he were tasked with deciding the winner of the Triwizard Tournament.
Harry: "Deep."
In the millions of times (thousands just tonight) Harry had fantasized about kissing Draco Malfoy, this was not at all how he thought it would go. Maybe he’d grab him by his tie and pull him into a searing snog or he’d stroke his cheek and gently lean in, extending the moment, or he’d just throw him against the wall and forgo kissing all together. Not once did he lurch forward with a nervous shot of adrenaline, barely managing to hit his mark.
Ron: ‘Wanker!’
Hermione: ;)
Prongs: Haha I don’t care that your bigoted family is in Azkaban. Dead chuffed about it, if I’m honest.
“Wait, you think – ” Harry began, laughter overtaking him before he could explain that Teddy was, in fact, not a witch Harry was cheating on Draco with.
Harry sighed, feeling like the universe had conspired against him. Why wasn’t he permitted anything simple? There truly was no joy without stipulations for him. He was pissed at Malfoy but he didn’t want to hurt him. He wanted Malfoy, but he hated the idea of wanting him. Fuck, he needed more alcohol!
Ron: Oh no, mate. Hey, there’ll  be other wizards. If you can get on this well with Malfoy, imagine what it’ll be like flirting with someone you can actually stand!
Harry: That 2

Harry: "Mmmmm it tastes like maple syrup."
Ginny: The Tedtextnado is upon us once again!!!
Greenviper: I think you’ll find I did not.
Harry: Ginny.
Harry: It was Neville’s event, I just made sure it happened.
Please remove me from this fucking place! You were the only person I could think to scream my feelings into the void at.
It hit Harry then, like a full speed bludger to the head; the tone, the slight on Harry’s intelligence… It wasn’t supposed to be – couldn’t be – but, Merlin, how could it not be? The clipped drawl he heard in his head when he read Hydra’s messages, it was always right there in fucking front of him. Draco Malfoy. Draco Bloody Fucking Ferret Malfoy.
Ginny: Why am I so out of the loop? This is just like back in school! With all your bloody secrets. I swear, Hogwarts brings out the worst in you three.
Draco: Oh.
Ginny: Ta! It’s just pre-season but we’ve got a good team this year. How’s Howlr?
“We’ve seen each other every day this week, Potter,” Draco drawled as the hands on Harry’s shoulders grew bolder and traveled down his arms and back up his chest. Harry sighed into the touch. It felt like his nerves were at a breaking point ever since that dreaded (more like treasured) night on Draco’s doorstep when he informed Harry that they would not be
“How?” Harry met his gaze, though Malfoy’s eyes seemed to be off somewhere else entirely. Harry didn’t mind, it wasn’t the other man’s face that was forbidden, it was the intensity of his stare. In fact, studying Malfoy from a distance felt alarmingly familiar to Harry. Like returning to Hogwarts after a Dursley summer or getting back on a broom at the end of a long winter.
Harry:  ;)
Harry: *Groaning * “Draco n – “
Harry: Well I wasn’t destined to date, Gin. You of all people should know that.
If I met you in person,
“Oh,” Harry said, taking back his hand and running it immediately through his hair. “I mean –  I wasn’t thinking about … When I – Hiya, sitting looks fun. Let’s do that.”
Greenviper: I was busy. I couldn’t very well spend the whole evening on my Spellular, it’d be a social travesty. In any case, despite what delusions you’ve brewed in that knut-sized brain of yours, you are not the only person to occupy my attention.
Ron: I think Hermione’s going to break up with me.
Hermione: Unacceptable. Let’s see him ignore the Ministry Floo, shall we? Have your Spellular close, I’ll conference you in.
“It’s a play on a Bible verse,” Ginny informed Draco coldly. He looked confused and isolated. Harry took his hand and squeezed.
Harry: I’m actually pretty swamped with work. Is everything alright with Teddy?
Pansy:
Harry: I think he just belched in the Minister’s face.
Prongs: Ok.
Prongs: Hahahahaha you should see the look on your face! Quick question, would it have made a difference if it was a wizarding toilet?
Harry: I’m at your flat, where are you? I need your help!
Prongs: WTF. By ‘he’ do they mean fucking Voldemort?!?!
Harry’s hips jerked forward and he let out the first of a series of long, embarrassing moans.
Ron: Why don’t you join the conversation. Live dangerously Hermione. Release the lion.
Ron: Are you fucking MENTAL?
Ginny: Already?
Harry: “Could you do it faster… Apparently, I have to comb my hair.”
McGonagall: You are lucky in that often when you make mistakes, they work out for you in the end. In any case, if this man faults you on one mishap then he is probably not worth the trouble in the first place.
Pansy: And my personal favorite…
Prongs: Well it tasted delicious! “Zagat rating 31 out of 30” “Can’t wait to see what he cooks next!”
“Potter, you’re dense but you’re not an imbecile.”
Harry: "Of waking the irritable beast that is child."
Draco: Ah, Blaise got to you.
Greenviper: Was it a bad breakup?
Harry: "The Ministry denied our request to move the the decorations via express because they’re concerned about the muggle traffic in front of the platform."
Greenviper: Are you trying to seduce me with glazed fish?
Harry: Mate, I know she’s right next to you.
Prongs: You implied it.
Harry: ‘Punbelievable.’
Hermione: You two are horrible. Harry, I’ve never known you to be superficial. I’m sure he is perfectly lovely.
Greenviper: I have my drink. What now?
Neville: Wanker.
Prongs: Wanker.
Harry: "You’ll be the death of me, you snarky prat."
“Christ, Draco!” Harry dropped the pot and bowl he was holding on the counter. He held on to its edge to steady himself.
Harry: And that is bad?
Witch * Slytherin * Lipstick * Model * Fashion
Harry: I’m. Glad!?!?!
Ginny: Harry, I could never quantify the love I have for our friendship.
Prongs: Oh…
Prongs: Ok. I switch but I’m pretty dominant and I’m not really into sadism. I mostly like the rigging side of bondage. Sensory play is always fun. And I have a bit of a toy kink too, but it’s not like I need them to get off.
Prongs: Like treacle, heavy on the tart.
Andromeda: Go over it for me one more time, Harry. Put an old lady’s nerves to rest.
Prongs: Spank your yourself for me.
Greenviper: A note in the margins: “Those stupid eyes. That damned hair.”
Greenviper: I’m disappointed. What would the Zagat say?
Ginny: I’ll buy you a peg leg for Christmas.
Blaise: As a matte
Harry: WERE YOU WEARING THEM?!?!
Greenviper: Exactly.
Harry: Me too!
Ginny: Too early!
Ginny: Course not.
Prongs: How?
Ginny: Could I have it used in a sentence, please?
“Did I say you could stop?” Draco released his nipples, let them bloom again then grabbed and twisted them again. Harry squealed, rubbing himself against Draco to give his lower half some needed attention. Draco, taking the bait, bucked into Harry’s day-old trackies with a grunt.
