“Yes, alright? I figured out who you were, and I still liked you, because our deal worked for me. You know, the one where we agreed to keep talking long enough to not be influenced by who we thought the other was?”
“Yeah, thanks. Sorry.”
“Oh it’ll be very good,” Pansy says, and her laughter follows Harry out of the room.
Harry lets out a huff of laughter, and releases all his fear with it. They’re alright.
“It’s true then. The Disaster Bi is real. Ginny, you’re an outlier and shouldn’t have been counted. You’re setting unrealistic standards for the rest of the bisexual community.”
Harry reached for the closest book and forced his brain to focus on the words instead of going down a dark road.
Only after getting dressed did Harry realise he should probably shower, but he was already running late so he cast a freshening charm instead and used one of the dozen deodorants Millie had put in his bathroom. She was the only one who could get past the wards and into his bedroom and bathroom after someone leaked a photo of Harry sleeping and Witch Weakly wrote an article on how to sleep like a hero. She used her access to make sure Harry always had fashionable clothes and accessories, beauty potions, perfumes, and deodorant.
“You feel so, fuck, Draco! So good!” Harry’s only half aware of the words escaping his mouth. His focus is on Draco thrusting into him again and again, making heat and pleasure build up in his pelvis and begging to overflow. It’s on his aching cock, on the precome leaking down it’s tip. It’s on Draco.
“Yeah?” he asks, smiling and bending over just a little bit. Just enough to make the ropes rub against his skin one last time, and to give the audience a final look at the come and lube escaping out of his arse.
Pansy gets out of bed, throwing a slipper at Harry’s head in the process. “Shut your face, idiot. It’s just Draco. And people with no real job don’t get to judge the ones of us who have full-time employment for taking a break.”
“What does that mean, you fell for me? Me or M?”
"What are your experiences with BDSM then?" Malfoy said, and to Harry's relief he looked more interested than scared.
“You’re not the only one who feels terrible,” Harry admits.
Harry closes his eyes against the rush of grief. It’s been more background noise than anything else for years now. Seeing this place though... The last time he and Ron saw the Great Hall it had been filled with bodies. Fred, Remus, Tonks and so many others.
Harry stayed late at Ron and Hermione’s. Too late, probably, since they both had to get up early with Rose in the morning. When he left though, he had a plan for how to continue with Draco.
“They’ll be mad. Fuck that, they’ll be hurt,” Draco says. Harry doesn’t think Draco really cares about that. The growing seed of doubt that’s taken place in him twitches at the thought.
Harry looked up to avoid seeing the reaction to his words on his friends faces and noticed it had gotten almost dark around them. Despite his atmospheric charms the air in the garden was getting cold with the sun mostly gone so he summoned firewood and got to work making a fire in the firepit.
Thank you for reading! Comments/kudos are always appreciated!
Malfoy doesn’t need Harry to answer twice. The second Harry shows that he wants it, he leans in and kisses Harry like he’s been starving for it. It’s all teeth and desperate clinging and Harry’s grateful he’s sandwiched between Malfoy and the wall because he’s pretty sure his legs stopped working somewhere around the time Malfoy took his bottom lip between his teeth and bit gently.
“Minerva took the memories I placed in there when I was alive and wove them into this portrait version of me,” Dumbledore says. “So you can fill it with your own memories if you like. I always meant for you to have it.”
Harry's eyes flickered to the red bracelet circling Malfoy's wrist and he shivered with want. Without giving himself time to think better of it he walked over to the man, cutting off a pink-haired girl.
Harry laughs. “I think the sex cured it.”
Harry comes down from his orgasm in a state of bliss. He tingles with aftershocks, and he opens his eyes to look at Draco who isn’t hiding his face anymore. Instead, he’s staring down at Harry with a look of pure awe that makes Harry wish he could come all over again.
name while in the throes of a wet dream strikes hard.
He cast a summoning spell and winced at the sounds of crashing and breaking coming from the pile of boxes he still hadn’t unpacked as the journal fought its way through the rest of the contents to fly to him. He opened the empty journal and transfigured his spoon into a pencil. If he couldn’t avoid his thoughts he was going to, at least, get them out of his head.
“Yeah, I’m guessing you’ve never been?”
“Eager are we, pet?” Draco asks, running a warm hand down Harry’s back.
"The date is set for six months from now." Draco places a hand on Harry's knee, and though the gesture should be comforting, it only hurts.
The problem arises after dinner, when Malfoy decides to retire to his room. Harry follows him to their common room and then to the hallway with their rooms without issue, but in a cruel twist of faith Malfoy’s room is at the very end of the hallway while Harry’s own is near the entrance. With Malfoy safely inside his room, Harry’s wrist stops him five feet from the door of the room he was assigned.
Harry suddenly wanted to turn back to the tomatoes instead of having this conversation. Had Draco really come here to confront him about knowing who he was for a little over a week before they were supposed to meet?
“I do,” Harry says. He hears his own heartbeat in his ears, beating louder and faster than Draco’s. If he can’t have everything he can at least have this. “I definitely want to.”
“They’re all watching you, you know,” Malfoy says. “Eyes wide, hands down their pants, wishing they could be the one up here with you.”
The following morning Harry paced the small cabin, nervously waiting for Millie to arrive. He wasn’t sure why she made him so nervous, but the second she stepped out of the Floo his nerves faded away and were replaced by affection. Millie was a friend. She wouldn’t guilt him into something he didn’t want to do.
In dream logic the door had closed and Malfoy had Harry pressed up against it, his hands tight around Harry’s wrists as he held them pinned to the wall. Harry had groaned and tried to push closer and Malfoy had smirked, leaning in to brush soft lips against Harry’s ear. Harry’s hips had buckled and Malfoy had pushed forward to meet them. Then Harry’s clothes were gone, and Malfoy was on his knees in front of Harry, wet lips inches from his aching cock. And then Harry had woken up.
“Claim me,” Harry says. “Come on me.”
“Now?” he asks, trying to wrap his head around what it is Draco’s offering him.
Harry forces himself to take three deep breaths before trying the spell again. It works this time, pouring lube into Malfoy’s hand and onto the sheets.
, it’s grief about what he
Harry crawled towards the bed, both because he didn’t trust himself to stand with his tingling feet and his dizzying arousal, and because Draco hadn’t given him permission to stand. Harry wanted to please the man more than anything.
“Yeah, in the kitchen,” Harry yells back. He rinses the frosting off his hands and grabs a towel to clean up the mess he’s made.
“Kneel in front of the bed,” Draco demanded, “and lean over it.”
“What I’m trying to say,” Draco says, voice steady, “is that I’m angry about a lot of things. I’m an angry person. But I’m not angry with you for the rough sex or release or whatever it is you call it, I’m not disgusted with you or with the things you like. And the fact that I’m angry doesn’t change the fact that I
wants can be like this. That he can give up control and feel the deliciousness of pain and pleasure intertwining without it having to be something dark or broody.
Draco freezes, but doesn’t let go of his wand.
“Draco, please.” Harry’s hands tighten around Draco’s arms and he hears his voice shake with longing.
Harry moves his hands down to Malfoy’s hips and pulls, making Malfoy lie fully on top of him before he lifts his hips to grind his crotch against Malfoy’s. He groans at the contact, throwing his head back and breaking the kiss. Malfoy isn’t deterred though, moving to kiss and lick at Harry’s neck again.
It doesn’t take long for Hermione to get Draco. Harry shouldn’t be surprised. He’d known Draco was close, but he’s surprised anyway because Draco once again looks perfectly put together. Harry would never know how much he was hurting if he didn’t hear it.
Harry loses his train of thought, not that he’s entirely sure he ever had one. “Er, so just – don’t apologise. OK?”
“She’ll hex you if she hears you calling her that,” Harry said, feeling a rush of warmth for Millie. He should reach out to her.
The months become weeks become days. Harry cries until he can’t cry anymore, pacing restlessly around his flat, waiting for Draco. When days turn to hours Draco shows up, and Harry knows it’s the last time. It’s nearly midnight, and Draco is getting married in the morning. To someone who isn’t Harry. Part of Harry wants to scream and shout, wants to fall to the floor and sob desperately, wants to beg Draco to stay. This is their last night though, the last chance for Harry to feel loved and love in return. He won’t ruin it by crying or screaming.
"Green."
Harry nods, twisting his fingers in the sheets to make sure he can’t do anything wrong with them. Draco looks down at them and smiles. Seconds later invisible bonds pull Harry’s hands up above his head, and he groans at both the feeling of being restrained and the display of wordless and wandless magic. He had no idea Draco could do that.
Ginny looks strangely nervous as she pulls Harry down the street, and Harry keeps walking with growing anxiety. What kind of hell-hole are they going to this time, if Ginny’s so nervous about showing it to him? They turn a corner, and suddenly the club is impossible to miss. Flags in every colour of the rainbow cover the entrance and from what Harry can see through the window the walls inside are covered too.
"Yeah. I've been waiting for you to make a move, but I only have so much patience."
“Merlin,” Draco groans, fingers tightening on his cock.
“I’ll have to start bringing Draco around more so I’m not constantly being the third wheel to whatever fucked up bi-cycle you two have going on,” she says, but doesn’t get out of the bed like she had the first couple of times. “And yes, that was indeed a bi-pun.”
Harry draws a sharp breath at the words, this time so strong he would have sworn Malfoy said them out loud if he hadn’t been watching him. They sounded just as needy as Harry feels, and the force of his desire makes him take a step back so he’s leaning against the wall.
“Merlin, your neck is gorgeous,” Draco says. “I love seeing it with my marks, love remembering how you gasped and buckled when I put it there. Love that everyone who sees them knows you’re mine.”
The silence that follows feels heavy, and Harry can’t help but feel like he should fill it. He doesn’t have anything to say though, nothing that would make sense of the scrambled mess in his head.
“Yes! Sorry, I understand.” Harry spoke hurriedly, desperate to please. Though it might not be the worst thing to displease either, he thought, if it meant Draco might spank him again.
“Make love to me like you mean it,” Harry says. “Fuck me like you love me, and then just -,” he closes his eyes to keep the tears in, breathes to steady his voice. “Then hold me until you have to leave.”
“Good thing you’re here to remind me then, isn’t it?” Harry asks.
He wakes too early, dreams of Draco swiveling in his head and making his cock ache. He rolls out of bed and has another cold shower, determined to wait for Draco though he can’t explain why.
Harry makes it over to the table Malfoy has saved for them in a daze. Ron might have a point, at least about the whole
“An arsehole?” Draco finishes.
Draco frowns. “No you don’t. It’s just the rush of catching Crabbe, and the sex. You’re confused, that’s all.”
“I do love you Harry,” Draco says. Harry doesn’t bother trying to examine if he’s saying it because he means it or because Harry asked for it. It doesn’t matter. He lets the words ring in his ears, trying to memorise every part of them.
“That too,” Harry says. “But most important, the plant is officially your responsibility. Neville can give you the sad eyes when he comes over to find it half-dead.”
“No, really? Why not? You’re friends with Bull-uh, Millie. Ginny has been going out with that Zabini bloke. You’ve held countless speeches about second chances and moving on and creating a unified society. Why can’t you be with him if he’ll make you happy?”
If nothing else, following Malfoy around becomes exponentially easier now that Harry isn’t doing it in hiding. He gets to enjoy long breakfasts. He gets to walk with Malfoy to the classrooms, instead of dodging his way through a crowd in his invisibility cloak or following at a distance while occasionally being pulled forward by his wrist. His new routine makes his life a whole lot easier, and if it wasn’t for the whole ‘sleeping on the floor’ issue, he doesn’t think he’d mind the bond. It has its drawbacks of course, like increasingly pointed questions from Ron and Hermione and the inability to choose where he goes. But the drawbacks seem less daunting and more like a mild to moderate inconvenience now.
“Why did you want me to come early?” Harry asks. He tugs at his t-shirt, wondering if he should have worn something else.
“Yes,” he says, hips twitching up as much as they can in the pinned position Draco has him in. He likes it, that Draco is the one in control, that Harry can’t just push down and have Draco in him. He likes that Draco is making him ask for it.
“Didn’t you want sex though?” Ginny says with a laugh. “Because you’ve kinda been going on about it a lot lately.”
Three-month anniversary? Is that a thing? Harry keeps his eyes closed, letting panic rush through him. He’s been trying so hard - and this is where he’s going to fuck it up. Daniel keeps kissing him though, and eventually, Harry kisses back and shakes off the final remains of sleep.
“You’re so tight for me, Harry. I can’t wait to feel you around my cock.”
When Harry doesn't deny it Daniel laughs, and the sound tears at Harry. There's no humour in it, only pain and anger.
“I know some people would maybe categorise this as our first time,” Draco says. “But it doesn’t feel like that – I just, sex is sex, right? We’re doing something new, but it’s not our first time?”
“Yes,” Harry breathes, leaning his head back to look at Draco standing above him.
“I think from the moment you met him to the moment you stopped talking should suffice,” Draco says. He doesn’t look happy about it either, to Harry’s relief.
Harry sets the Pensive down and tries to think of anything to say that will make this better, but Draco will know he’s lying no matter what he says. They know each other too well, and not well enough.
Harry ignores the way Draco winces a little as he says
He’s fine though, he does want a relationship. He wants to love Daniel the way Ginny loves Pansy and he’ll get there. He’ll keep living this dream until it
M, Malfoy, and Draco seemed in his head like three separate people. M was the person he’d chatted with, Malfoy was the boy who tormented him at school, and Draco was – both, and something else entirely. He was the boy who grew up a bully and found himself in a war he didn’t believe in. The boy who lied and said he didn’t recognise Harry, Ron, and Hermione when they were caught and brought to Malfoy Manor. The boy who wasn’t brave enough to fight for what he learned too late was right. And the boy who grew up to be a man. Who got a job and worked every day to be better. The man who went out in the Muggle world to learn their culture and cried over musicals.
He doesn’t waste any time approaching and pulling Harry close, like they were in the bar. Harry closes his eyes and lets him. He focuses on the feeling of hands running over his t-shirt and of a firm hip against his growing erection. He lifts his hands to let his shirt get pulled off, and groans a little at the feeling of skin against skin. It feels good to be touched and his body reacts with a shiver when it stops. He doesn’t open his eyes, deciding it’s better to just wait for a new sensation. Seconds later, a naked torso presses against his and Harry pushes back, chasing the warmth.
Daniel pauses, close enough that Harry can feel the heat radiating off his bare skin. He still just looks like a bloke, like some random person on the street or in a magazine or movie. Harry’s body misses the sensations Daniel had made him feel, but now that they’ve stopped, Harry realises doesn’t want to stand here staring at the stranger that’s going to make him feel it.
“He told me he loved me, and I couldn’t say it back. I didn’t even want him to say it, or feel it. What the hell is wrong with me that I don’t want that?”
all the time. It’s intense.”
Harry, being a sane and rational person is
“What do you want us to do then?” Draco asks, finally setting his cup down on the table.
“Fuck me,” he says, feeling calm and sure in his request, the blushing hesitation from earlier burned away by the heat of his desire.
Harry stays in bed, tries and fails to keep from hoping that Draco will return. That he’ll get to the altar and realise he
“I love you,” Draco said, seeming to surprise himself. It wasn’t a huge step, not when they’d been saying ‘I’m in love with you’ since the day they met in person. But it was, because they hadn’t said that yet.
“No, you shut up. Because I’m in love with you too. I’m an idiot, but I swear I didn’t leave because my feelings for you disappeared when I knew you were J.”
“Sweet Morgana I’ve created a monster,” Draco sighs, pretending exasperation. “I thought you felt awkward talking about sex.”
His lack of attention to Malfoy’s words turn out to be a problem because Malfoy suddenly waives his wand to distribute vials to each table and then walks briskly towards the door. Maybe if he had paid attention Harry would have had time to grab his invisibility cloak, but as it is Malfoy is through the door and pulling Harry along with him before Harry has time to blink the glaze from his eyes.
Harry smiles, remembering Molly’s words about the kitchen being the heart of the house. Maybe it’s a pure-blood thing.
Harry smiles at the praise. “Thank you.”
Harry ate his soup and went to bed, feeling exhausted by not only the day, but the life he’d spent the last few years living. When he woke up again the heaviness was back, laying over him like a second duvet and weighing him down to the point where he couldn’t make himself get up. And he didn’t have to, did he? There was no-one waiting for him or expecting him to be or do anything. Nobody would care or notice if he didn’t get up. So, he didn’t, besides using the bathroom and getting food and water, he stayed in the loft on the strangely comfortable mattress.
“Drop it, or I shoot. And not a word, I know how those things work.” Matt’s voice is cold, and through the haze of his throbbing head Harry suddenly feels afraid. Draco could be hurt, he could be hurt, all because Harry wasn’t quick enough. Because he didn’t think to consider Matt a proper threat.
“So, I’ve moved in?” Draco asked, eyes glowing.
“No,” Harry says. He shoves his hands in his pockets and is glad for the robe that covers his still half-hard cock.
“Fine,” Draco says, and Harry aches with knowing he’s hurt him. It bleeds through his clipped words and stiff shoulders. Draco thinks Harry doesn’t trust him. Harry knows, because when he turns to get their Pensive Draco rolls down his sleeves to hide his faded Mark.
October 30th
Draco laughed softly behind him, but it didn’t sound real. “She told me, but only after screaming at me for thirty minutes about how much of an idiot I am.”
“I’m Harry,” Harry shouts back.
Harry knows, rationally, that Malfoy is waiting for him outside the door. If he isn’t there Harry would feel it, after all. Still, he feels nervous opening the door, like Malfoy might have left him behind. Or maybe he’s just nervous Malfoy will make him explain his strange behaviour.
“Harry can be bisexual and aromantic,” Hermione offers. “Romantic and sexual attraction are two separate things.”
Inspiration strikes Harry, and it’s silly, but he has to let Draco know they need to act
He landed in the middle of London and frowned. He didn’t want to be in London. He wanted to be – he wasn’t sure, elsewhere. He Apparated again and again, letting magic and intuition guide him as he appeared and disappeared over and over throughout England. Finally, he tried to Apparate and found he was too exhausted. His magic wouldn’t rise up to let him leave the random city he found himself in. Frustrated Harry held out his hand for a passing taxi and asked to be taken to a hotel. He’d sleep and figure it out in the morning.
“Yeah, maybe,” Draco says, and it sounds like he believes it just as much as Harry does.
“Sounds perfect,” Harry said, smiling warmly at his friends. He could do this; he could go to a quiet cabin and sit with his thoughts until they learned how to be nice to him. He’d find himself or something, and he could deal with the consequences of running away later.
Harry picks at his food through the whole dinner and struggles to make eye-contact while Ron tells him about how much Rose is enjoying her Muggle school. Hermione notices something is wrong, Harry knows, because she keeps shooting him concerned looks throughout the whole meal. She’s gotten better at giving Harry space and time until he’s ready to talk about whatever he needs to say, but she’s never been able to control her trademark
Draco’s jerks were becoming erratic and Harry was pleased to know he wasn’t the only one feeling close and desperate.
Harry laughs, some of the anxiety bubbling in his stomach escaping with it. “That’s definitely true. Thank you, Pansy, for finding a way for me to blame Ginny for my terrible boyfriend skills.”
The movie does have a lot of dogs in it, and it makes Harry wonder why he hasn’t got one. He likes walks, he likes dogs, he has the time. And more importantly he’s always wanted one. And he’s not in limbo waiting for his life to begin anymore. His life is exactly the way he wants it, apart from the spare bedroom that’s empty more often than he’d like.
“I did my homework,” Harry admits while putting the kettle on. Maybe the kitchen is the best room for talking because there are so many excuses for avoiding eye-contact.
“I feel like I should enjoy what I do too, or what I did. I mean, I was helping people. I don’t know why it bothers me so much that it’s so public. And I’m not sure it’s fair to place what I want over what others need.” Harry felt that he found the root of his issue as he spoke. He didn’t like to be a public person, but he wasn’t sure his guilt could deal with not doing something if he had the power to try.
“I didn’t mean to,” Harry says, and it’s the wrong thing. It’s not what he means to say, because while that might have been true at first, he
Draco takes a few steps closer before he stops, dead in his tracks.
Harry smiled. It sounded like something M, or Draco, would do. They’d talked about his terrible job, and the apothecary he wanted to open. Harry had asked him once why he was so determined to open an apothecary independent of St Mungo’s when he didn’t really need the money, and Draco had said he wanted to offer potions and medicines to everyone at a price they could afford. He’d said St Mungo’s ridiculously overpriced some of their medications because they weren’t officially lifesaving and didn’t fall under the public healthcare the Ministry paid for.
“Circe Potter, the man was old enough to be my father. No, I did not have a childhood crush on Snape,” Malfoy says. “You, however, never let age stop you from that crush you had on Lupin.”
Malfoy remains standing and rolls his eyes.
for over a week now, and it’s strange how quickly Harry got used to it. He started using it after hearing Draco thinking ‘
“You’re not upset that I refused your pity-pint, are you?”
“Thanks,” he says, giving Malfoy’s hand an appreciative squeeze before releasing it.
Draco casts a quick conjuring spell. The same one Harry had used their first time.
The first smack of the belt against his arse comes as a surprise, and Harry gasps. “Fuck.”
“Never fear,” Draco says holding up his bag, “I come prepared.”
He goes into the office the following Monday feeling just as relaxed and well rested, and the lights in their office don’t seem too bright at all.
“Malfoy,” Harry says. He tries to keep his tone neutral, but the truth is he’s furious that Malfoy has ignored him for the entire lesson and has only now, at the worst possible moment, decided to disturb Harry. “What do you want?”
Draco looked up at Harry with a soft smile. “At the risk of sounding clingy, I’m not leaving until you kick me out.”
Rose and Hugo are awake by the time Harry gets to Ron and Hermione’s, and they’re so excited to see him that it takes Ron and Hermione a full hour to make them calm down enough to go to sleep. Harry sits in the living room, warming-charms on the pizzas he bought on the way over, sipping a cold beer.
Harry doesn’t have time to ask what she means. Doesn’t have time to summon his wand from the bedside table. The red light of a Stupefy hits him and he’s out before he hits the floor.
Hermione and Ron is sick of seeing Harry depressed because he can't find a single person to date that isn't into him because of his fame. So they set him up with a new wizard dating site where personal pictures and names aren't allowed.
Draco smiles. “And today I think you should take some time. Get some rest, and think long and hard about what you like and don’t like in bed. We won’t do anything at all until I know what we both enjoy and what our boundaries are with each other.”
Pansy and Ginny both consider him for a while, but Pansy is the first to speak.
“Good,” Draco says. “I trust you too.”
“I never want to not know you,” Harry says. “I’m sorry I made you doubt that.”
"I'm sorry," Harry says. "I don't love you back."
“Brown forgets to boil his tea-water. He should have retired before we even started working here, but he’s a stubborn sod who insists on sitting here and being useless instead. Naturally, he wrote this note and forgot all about it.”
He finds Malfoy at the table he usually chooses and drinks deeply from the mug that’s placed in front of him. It’s perfect, and the warmth and caffeine both make him feel instantly more alert and less like he’s spent weeks sleeping on the floor.
“I know she was a bit of a shit in school, and fuck, I was so mad at her when she said we should turn you over to Voldemort, but she’s really grown up – I promise. And she’s really sorry about saying that! It’s how we met actually, she came up to me to apologize and –.”
Harry decided to take full advantage of his permanent summer and have his breakfast in the garden. After a moment’s consideration he grabbed a pen and paper to bring with him as well. He hadn’t seen anyone for a while now. At first it had been because he was too exhausted to deal with anyone, too unsure of how to act and who to be. Lately though, he’d been afraid that if he let anyone see him it would shatter the fragile shape of a ‘self’ he’d managed to build in his solitude.
“You know like how Squibs end up homeless and no magic shelter will take them in, or how werewolves can’t get jobs, houses, or the Wolfsbane potion. As the foundation grows, I hope to employ people society sees as unemployable.”
“I’m here sharing the burden now, aren’t I? I’m getting better at it.”
we feel happened anyways. Like if you walked in on me wanking or something.”
But when Harry had asked him out for a pint after the trials were all done Malfoy had turned him down. And he hadn’t tried to rebuild in other ways either. He donated an absolutely obscene amount of money to charity, but all of it anonymously or under aliases. Harry only knows because he used his authority as an Auror to do a little off-the-books investigating. Finally, Harry had settled on the theory that Malfoy had given up England as a lost cause and was investing his time in making a life in France. But here he was, fucking with Harry’s brain, and making all his buttons shake with the knowledge that they’re about to be pushed.
When the credits roll Harry feels so sated from the food and tired from the travel that he would have fallen asleep on the sofa if it wasn’t for Ayla licking at his knee and walking to the balcony door in an obvious request to be let outside. The fresh air gives him a second wind and he stands there looking up at the stars while Ayla chases a ball around.
“It’s brilliant,” Harry says, grabbing Draco’s hand and leading him out onto the new balcony.
“Alright fine I take it back, I’m never sick of pizza.” Harry casts an Aguamenti in Ayla’s bowl to hide his eye roll. “How about Indian though? I could go for some biryani and naan.”
Harry felt a rush of relief at Draco’s words. He didn’t care if anyone else thought they were moving too fast. He cared that they were moving at the same pace as each other.
Draco gave a bark of laughter so loud they both jumped, and Harry was glad he’d paused his work with the knife.
Harry sits on the floor to pick up the papers scattered there. “It won’t. We swore we’d have no desk-fillers. And besides, Crabbe isn’t a genius — we’ll figure out a way to flush him out. We just need one of our brilliant plans.”
Harry wobbled a little on the floor when Draco roughly pulled his ankles together and pushed Harry's jeans up so the soft velvet was touching his skin even as he started bonding them together. Harry breathed a sigh of relief as he felt himself start to sink into the ropes. The constant itch he felt that was always whispering that he should
“Yes, and I’m sure some of the other spells might be useful, just like we know at least one of them will cut a person open.
“Exactly,” Draco grins. “Then we have tomorrow and Sunday to talk,” he winks, “and we’ll make a plan for Crabbe on Monday.”
“I know you know what this is,” Harry says, directing his words to Draco. “You know it doesn’t affect my mind. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you.”
Harry hears the words like a whisper in his ear and he jumps, head twisting to the side so fast his neck twinges in protest. Of course, there isn’t anyone there. The voice had clearly been Malfoy’s, and he’s thankfully not standing behind Harry whispering in his ear. He’s standing right in front of Harry saying something at a normal volume.
“Well, yeah,” Ron says, “but also, you talk in your sleep. Like, a lot.”
Harry shrugs and extracts the memory, placing it gently in the Pensive. “Alright, but just so you know I’m all for it.”
“Oh!” Hermione says, jumping out of her chair with a grin. “I read about that.”
Did that mean Draco might want to do this again sometime?
Harry smiles. “No Malfoy, I don’t think you’re up to something now. We just agreed you’re not a git anymore, didn’t we?”
Harry jumps when Ayla crashes into him with the stick in her mouth and her tail wagging, as she waits for Harry to take it. Draco stands further back and shoots Harry an apologetic smile, but Harry just grins back and takes the stick from Ayla to throw.
Harry makes it through the room to where Ron and Hermione are sitting and leans over their table.
about you.”
“I love you,” Harry says before he can stop himself. He means it, but he’s not sure Draco is ready to hear it. Draco had thought it, but Harry suspects this is one of the things that’ll take him a while to say out loud.
Harry busies himself by rummaging through his bag for some parchment and a quill.
Harry frowns, taking a step back. “What, you’re queer so I have to be too? Not that I mind, but I think I’d know.”
Harry gasps when Draco accentuates the words by crooking his fingers and pressing against Harry’s prostate. Hearing Draco say the praise out loud is so much more satisfying than overhearing a thought. Draco knows he’s hearing it now, grins with pleasure when he sees Harry react to it.
Ice runs down Harry’s spine. He has a sneaking suspicion that Crabbe isn’t just in the Muggle world to traffic drugs, but people too.
“I guess I have, haven’t I?” Harry laughs.
“Let’s just hide in our part of the castle until they leave,” Harry agrees. “Though I’m mostly relieved I won’t have to suffer through Slughorn’s potions lessons.”
Harry weaved his way through the crowd, making his excuses and promising to return after his speech for a chat. When he finally made it onstage they dimmed the lights in the room and hit him with a Lumos so bright he couldn’t see. And that’s when he realised, he had no idea what the fundraiser was for, or if it even was a fundraiser. Maybe it was some sort of memorial event? Or just a social thing Millie had thought he should attend? He had no idea.
The next day he got out of bed without issue, actually looking forward to his day. He spent half an hour in the shower, and when he got out found the delivered groceries by his fireplace. Harry unpacked them into the various cupboards in the kitchen, casting freezing and cooling charms on some of them.
“Please,” he says, desperation making his voice tremble. He doesn’t know how to explain what he wants so he turns his head and tilts it, exposing his neck and using a hand to gently guide Malfoy’s head to where he wants him.
When he wakes he’s in a room he doesn’t recognise. Ron and Hermione are talking to Draco, who looks so closed off Harry almost doesn’t recognise him. They haven’t noticed he’s awake and Harry gets off the floor as quietly as he can. He doesn’t have his wand, and he has no idea what’s made Ron and Hermione lose their minds, but he’s going to find out. He takes a few quiet steps forward and almost walks into the shimmering barrier. He recognises it immediately from work. It’s a magic box, designed to keep him, and him alone, in. Without his wand he won’t be able to get out.
“Matt, what’s going on?” Harry asks, though by now he’s certain he knows. He pushes as much hysteria into his voice as he can. “You’re not going to sell me to some creepy old bloke to be kept in a basement, are you? You’re joking, right?”
Ron pushed Harry’s plate closer in a clear encouragement for Harry to start eating and turned to Hermione.
“Uh, hi,” Harry says, feeling caught. “I was hoping to borrow your Pensieve.”
“Take me to bed?” Harry asked, breaking the kiss and shifting on Draco’s lap. “We should celebrate.”
“I’ll be down in a second,” Harry says and pushes past Draco to lock himself in the bathroom. The sight of himself in the mirror shocks him. His right cheek is a deep purple, spreading varying shades of blue down to his chin and up to his eye. The rest of his face is covered in tiny red dots. Probably from the lack of oxygen, he thinks absently, raising his chin to look at the bruising on his neck. He looks like a mess, and he thinks he probably feels worse.
“Harry, please!” Draco says, and he’s closer now. Harry should speed up, but it hurts to breathe in the cold air and Draco sounds so sad. And maybe Harry isn’t the only one who’s selfish.
“You’re coming out of your self-imposed exile then?” Ginny grinned. “What will you do? I mean, will you get a job? Will you go back to doing events all the time?”
“Thanks.” Harry grins. “I’ll catch up with you and Hermione at breakfast tomorrow.”
“He’s sex on legs, you mean,” Draco says.
“Yeah alright,” Harry agrees, “I think we’ll have to set it up here though. Your and Pansy’s flat runs entirely on magic, and the TV needs electricity. Did you get anything to watch?”
he was coming, just that he was. The anticipation makes Harry’s skin tingle. He’s not even sure they’ll get to the sex today. Maybe Draco will insist on just talking and talking and talking. Maybe he’ll listen to what Harry likes and not be interested in any of it. Maybe he’ll — arrive while Harry’s pacing and freaking out, apparently.
Draco leaves the room without waiting for Harry’s reply, and Harry takes a minute to rub his tired eyes. Having the case to focus on helps, but Harry’s brain is slowly overflowing with thoughts and worries that he can’t seem to suppress. His skin seems to be itching for the sharp sting of pain and the roughness of letting go. He’ll go to the club tonight, he decides, when they finish interviewing Martin. Smiling with the relief of his decision, and the direction of having another lead to follow, Harry grabs his jacket and follows Draco.
if Malfoy looks at him or not.
He felt a little less heavy, with the showers. He had a reason to get out of bed that wasn’t ‘I need to’ or ‘I should’, but ‘I want to’. When he ran out of food again a few days later he considered ordering more fast meals, like soups, that only needed to be reheated. It was what he usually ate, when he wasn’t at some sort of fancy dinner. But it wasn’t what he wanted to eat. He wanted to eat spaghetti Bolognese and roast chicken and shepherd's pie. Normal foods. He decided to go with the flow of ‘I want’ and wrote down a long list of various ingredients.
“Good for you,” Harry says. “I did and now I’m in love with Draco, and Draco hates me.”
“Trust is vital to every part of our relationship Harry, you can’t go off without me like that again.
Harry grinned when Draco grabbed his shoulder and the press of apparition closed around them.
Harry figures he’ll have Ginny buy him multiple drinks, actually. Throwing an arm around her he lets her lead him towards the rainbow-coloured doors.
“Ah, yes here,” he says, holding up the book and starting to read. “The subject of the spell will be bound to stay within a 20 yard radius of the target, blah blah blah, they will hear the thoughts their betrothed has about them.”
“Heard of that too, but I always felt like it would defeat the point. Nobody ever asked for one anyway.” Harry lets his brain slow down into only doing what Draco asks. He lets the worry and the anxiety slip away for now. He can’t fix what he’s done. He can’t change how Draco will feel about it, but what he can do is what Draco asks of him. And right now that’s answering.
“So loose and wet for me,” Draco said. “I knew you were made to take my cock.”
“Your place is the restaurant where you had your first date, and where Gin booked you a table for your one-month anniversary,” Pansy says.
By the time Harry and Malfoy are the only ones left in the classroom Harry is finding it hard to control his breathing enough to appear calm, but he can’t quite tell if it’s anxiety over the gold band on his wrist or anger that Malfoy has asked him to stay behind.
Harry laughs.
He’s enjoying his time with Malfoy; learning the habits and personality of the man he’s grown up to become. Now that they’re almost friends Harry doesn’t feel strange inviting Malfoy along to fly if he feels like flying, or asking Malfoy to guard the door to the bathroom, or accepting help on his Potions homework.
Harry waves at Ron and then grabs one of the trays at the end of the serving table and fills it with a glass of orange juice, coffee, buttered toast and some strawberries. He’s tempted to grab one of the chocolate covered pastries too, but he figures it’s a bad idea to start the morning on a sugar high.
“Is it alright if I put my arm around you?” Draco asks, holding the hand that had been placed on Harry’s knee up without moving it towards Harry.
Harry laughed, and it was such a strange feeling to still find joy in a situation where his life felt turned on its head. Draco had said the same thing to Harry only a few weeks ago, and it had been partly what had prompted Harry to seek out Ron and Hermione now.
Harry had been right, that Draco had filled out, and the weight made him look healthy and approachable. Draco Malfoy was in no way a pointy git anymore. His shirt looked soft, and Harry caught himself wanting to reach out and touch it. Though, that probably had more to do with the man who was wearing the shirt than the shirt itself.
"Indeed," Draco grinned, eyeing the straining bulge in Harry's jeans.
“I feel like a prince or something,” Harry says, drinking his juice and realising he’s surprisingly thirsty.
“I like that,” he said, remembering his promise to tell Draco what he liked as they went along. “When you tell me I’m good. And when you give me orders.”
“What?” Harry groans. His mouth still feels numb with the tingles of healing magic.
“Harry? Ayla?” Draco yells. Ayla immediately runs to see what’s going on, and Harry rolls his eyes before getting off the floor and following her.
“I don’t usually have a problem showing this. It’s – I’m obviously not proud of the mark itself, but it’s a visceral reminder of how far I’ve come. I don’t usually mind people seeing that.”
“Yeah,” Harry sighs. He feels defeated, but there’s relief in the admission too.
Grateful, Harry nods and watches as Daniel steps into the flames. He lifts a hand and runs a finger over the ghost of Daniel’s touch on his ear, his lips, his arse. He wants this. He enjoyed the way his body felt when it was pressed up against Daniel, and fuck – he’s been horny for years now. He wants to feel that release, the pleasure as it builds up to orgasm. Daniel could scratch that itch just as well as the girls he’d tried it with, couldn’t he? It’s strange and new and a little terrifying, but he does want it. Several deep breaths later, Harry steps through the Floo.
“Started out vanilla then?” Draco smirked, “That’s pretty common. What you like can be anything though, not just kinky stuff.”
A vaguely familiar man stops in front of him, holding out his hands as if asking permission. Not entirely sure what he’s agreeing to, Harry nods. The man places sure hands on Harry’s hips, and looking down at them Harry thinks he must have played Quidditch. The hands are strong and sure, and Harry doesn’t feel disgusted at the sight. He feels pretty much like he does when it’s manicured and feminine hands wrapped around him.
“So, just an alcoholic and insomniac then? Better, I suppose, though still a disaster. I assume you’ve forgotten all about our case?”
“Green,” he said, wanting to reassure the man behind him. It seemed to be what Draco had been waiting for because as the final syllable left Harry’s mouth Draco’s hips slammed forward and Harry screamed in
Hermione opened the door wearing her dressing gown and fixed him with a surprised expression. “Harry, what –,” she said.
Harry blinks hard and makes his eyes focus back on Malfoy’s hand. He reaches out for it and lets their fingers intertwine before pulling himself up. His hand feels cool and soft against Harry’s. But he’s not thinking about that. He’s been excellent at spending years not thinking about that, he’s not about to give in now.
“I know it’s supposed to be our first date,” Harry said, “but it doesn’t
“I do not!” Harry insisted, though he figured Ron probably had a point.
“I think he might be more inclined to forgive you than you think,” Snape says.
"You'd look gorgeous sucking me off, bound like this," Draco said, running his fingers down Harry's cheek and over his lips. Harry's hips buckled, the motion pulling on the ropes and sending shivers of pleasure through him.
Harry takes the page and looks at the flat, because he’s not sure his voice will sound properly excited if he says anything. The flat is pretty, though he’s not sure he’d call it a flat at all. It’s the second story of a two story house in Hogsmeade. It has a small garden attached, and it’s a purely magical town so Ginny can go flying without worry. It’s everything she’s dreamed of.
“So, what then? You’ll just be alone?” Ron asked.
“In twenty years I’ll be in my seventh year as Minister for Magic, have two kids and a house with a giant bathtub.”
“Should I stop?” Draco asks, hips slowing even though he’s obviously close.
"Or it'll make it brilliant," Harry argued. He'd spent several evenings in bed wanking to the idea of being tied down and unable to relieve himself while being brought to the edge of orgasm again and again. He'd never been able to do it himself, always feeling too impatient to hold off when his orgasm started building.
“No, shut up!” Harry felt his fingernails dig into his first perfect tomato as he gripped it even harder to keep tears from escaping his eyes. “I fell for you. And that – it didn’t change just because I learned your name. You’re still you, the man I’ve talked to daily for months. And I can’t blame you for the fact that your feelings changed when you saw me. I can’t make you want to be with me. But I can make you stop seeking me out to – what, yell at me for not saying I knew who you were right away?”
Then days and weeks pass, and slowly but surely life gets to him. Will he catch that murderer? What will happen if he doesn’t? Will he be able to avoid that Witch from St. Mungo's who’d asked him out? Will he ever find someone to fit in with, and when he doesn’t, will he be able to deal? His dishes get left undone, building up to an insurmountable mountain on his kitchen counter and stressing him out so much he can’t use the kitchen at all anymore. He’ll run out of clean clothes and spend hours at work worrying over what to wear the next day. He’ll stop sleeping. Harry’s thoughts will gain momentum and weight until they spin around the inside of his head and slam against his skull with such force he can’t figure out what any of them are saying anymore. And that’s when he’ll give in. Because at that point his thoughts can’t hold him back anymore, and even if they could, Harry’s pretty sure they’d tell him functioning at work is more important than avoiding the feelings of guilt and worthlessness sex always brings.
“You still want this?” Malfoy whispers, mouth so close to Harry’s ear he can feel lips moving against it.
“Merlin yes,” Draco said, lips moving against Harry’s skin as he spoke. He was clearly affected too, his hips twitching against Harry even as Harry worked to unbutton his trousers.
He could do this. He would do this.
“Uhm, what about almond?” Harry suggests, catching sight of a bag of the very thing on his counter.
Shit. Was he ready for this? After all, his contact with the outside world still consisted only of letters to Ron and Hermione and grocery-lists for Floo-orders. This wouldn’t be much different than letters though. And it was a chance for him to really be himself, without any expectations of who he
“Now that I think about it, why was it so loud? Did you bring something huge with you?”
“I love the little Hobbits so much,” Harry says. “Look at how they’re just in their feelings like they don’t have room in their little bodies to contain it all so it just shines through all the time.”
“Yes,” Harry says, filling the word with determination. “It’s just that the headspace I get into when I’m having sex is a bit wonky, and if I’m in one of my moods when I go there I get very concerned with trying to prove my worth. I wouldn’t be able to say no then, I think. At least I can’t guarantee it, and I don’t want to do that to you.”
Draco finally moves, though he walks into the room instead of out of it. “Fuck, Harry, you look — what happened?” His voice shakes as much as Harry’s.
"Haven't tried anything I didn't like," Harry shrugged.
“Are you absolutely sure you’re alright?” he asks, looking for any sign of damage.
An hour later Harry is sitting in the Potions classroom flipping victoriously through his old Potions book. The outside has been discoloured by ash, but the book itself hasn’t been touched by the fire at all. Harry hears the voices chatting quietly around him quiet down, and he looks up in interest. The Potions teacher isn’t listed on his schedule, probably because of the late hire, and Harry’s curious to see who they’ve chosen. Whoever it is, they can’t be worse than Snape.
Malfoy lets go of Harry’s hips and grabs the rope instead, pulling out and using the rope to pull Harry hard against him when he pushes back in. Malfoy sets an unrelenting pace and Harry lets his mouth fall open as pleasure spikes in his belly, clutching the bar tightly and letting Malfoy control his movements.
“If you have a previous engagement I’m perfectly fine to work by myself,” Malfoy says. He looks so sincere Harry might have believed him if it wasn’t for the disappointed sigh in his ears. Malfoy really does want to sit with him.
aroused by the man, or like he
Harry grabs a pillow off the bed and screams into it before putting it underneath his head and staring at the ceiling.
The sound of Malfoy’s zipper opening is so faint Harry might have missed it completely, if not for the collective hush that falls over the room at the same time. Harry is going to be fucked. And he’s ready, his rim already stretched and lubed up before he entered the stage. His cock has been aching on and off for days in anticipation.
“I like when I can feel it, I’ve been using that blue bondage-rope you sell here with Ron. It’s got the perfect amount of friction.”
Harry sighs and grabs the pillow back, hugging it like a teddy as he stares hopelessly at the girls.
He logged out of the site and left the the Po-cuter in his bedroom to go mix himself a drink. Who needed love anyway, right? He had a party to host and a fundraiser to attend in the morning. Nothing had changed, he could still be Harry Potter.
“We’re in a hallway,” Malfoy whispers, lips wet against Harry’s ear. Despite his words he doesn’t stop the gentle roll of his hips against Harry.
“Sorry,” Harry says, directing it at Hermione. “You know I think you’re right to about the laws that demand qualifications for certain jobs. I just hate that it means I need to do a course to get my NEWTs to qualify for a job I’ve been doing for five years already.”
“No,” Harry says, and the hand on his knee twitches in response.
“And the only thing you’d need from me is that I show up once or twice a year to make a speech?” Harry asked.
“Thank you for spending the night,” Daniel says. “I had fun last night.”
“I’m a regular Dom at the BDSM club in Knockturn,” Draco says, and Harry twists to look at him in shock to make sure he’s not joking.
Hermione and Ron both frowned with concern, and Harry was sure they’d blame him for their worry-lines one day.
Draco comes out of the Pensive looking furious. “I’m going to fuck you over your desk now,” he says, “and I don’t want a word about it!”
Something wild flashes in Draco’s eyes, and Harry’s breath catches.
Harry stares at Malfoy in open mouthed horror. He can’t have bonded them together for
Harry isn’t too sure he’s in a closet, but as the distance to the club closes he feels the strange comfort he always does when coming home to his flat. Like he’s somewhere he belongs. At least, as much as he knows how to belong.
Matt always delivers feelings and sensations strong enough to make Harry force out everything else. His knees throb, his arse feels full, his shoulders ache with holding himself up from the floor, his body surges with adrenaline when Matt closes his hands around his neck until his vision goes spotty and still holds on for a while longer before letting go. His thighs shake with need to come, and he gasps for air through it all.
“Nevermind that,” Harry says, fighting to hold his irrational irritation back. “Who was that girl I saw you kissing last night?”
Harry laughs. “That just means we’ll have to work twice as hard, or we’ll be accused of favouritism.”
Draco catches Harry’s mouth in a kiss, hands moving to tug gently at his hair. “Me too. Fuck you feel so good.”
Harry shakes his head and grips the sheets tighter.
Harry looked down at the journal and smiled as the warm feeling from earlier sank back in. Maybe his thoughts weren’t so big and scary if he didn’t work so hard to avoid them?
Harry looks down at Draco’s cock. It’s thick and gorgeous and flushed with arousal, Harry imagines the burn and stretch of taking it all in and drags in a ragged breath.
Harry smiles at Daniel, but doesn’t take the small present in his hand. Harry likes the sex with Daniel well enough. It feels good, and it scratches that itch he’s felt for years and done nothing about, but he can only do it when he’s in the mood and nothing Daniel can do will get him there because three months into their relationship Harry still doesn’t
Relieved he wasn’t the only one affected, Harry lifted his arse off the bed as high as he could without lifting his face from the sheets.  “Anything. Fuck me, make me come. Please.”
Harry stares expectantly at Ron and Hermione, hoping they’ll agree that yes, a romantic relationship does need some time and nurture to do well. He can’t be sure what they do think though, because Malfoy is already walking out of the Hall and in a few seconds Harry will be pulled forcefully after him if he doesn’t get up to follow.
Harry considers his friends for a second before he finds inspiration. “Actually I think some time away might do you some good. You’ve gone from sharing a flat and being alone together all the time to sharing every meal with me, spending all your time in the library or the common room. I think you need to have a proper date to maintain your relationship.”
“Accio coffee,” Harry said, pointing his wand at the door. It was a terrible decision, and he knew it as soon as he heard a startled scream and a crash from his kitchen. When his summoned coffee finally arrived, it was just the unground beans he’d received as a gift and had stuck in the back of a cupboard when he figured he’d never bother to learn how to grind them.
“So, what’s the problem knowing who it is if it doesn’t ruin things for you?” Hermione asked.
Matt grinds his clothed erection against Harry’s arse and makes a frustrated sound. “He isn’t, or I’d have a go at you in the bathroom before heading up.”
Harry waits until Ron and Hermione have gone down the stairs before he tries again to walk further from the Dining Hall. Once more his wrist goes icy cold and then freezes mid-air. It feels like someone has put up an invisible barrier that everything but his wrist can move through.
“You knew, didn’t you? You always know things,” Harry said. It wasn’t an accusation. He’d asked Ron and Hermione to not tell him, if they figured out who M was. He’d made a deal, after all. He suddenly understood why M wanted the deal as much as Harry had.
. Sure, Harry doesn’t have much time to himself anymore because Daniel wants to have sleepovers all the time. And maybe Harry doesn’t sleep much because he can’t settle with Daniel holding him. But it’s nice, growing with someone. And Harry still has his Fridays where he can sit on his sofa and drink soda and tell Daniel he’s busy working.
“Right,” Ron said. “Uhm, sit down, you need food.”
“But you’re not —,” Harry starts.
Harry rolls his eyes and holds up a hand to be helped up from the ground. His jeans are already wet and he’ll be freezing cold in a second.
"You know the traffic-light safeword?"
“Well, no, I wanted to – with you, but that’s alright,” Harry says, dejected. Being rejected by Malfoy shouldn’t
The sex is quick and dirty, and like taken straight out of one of Harry’s daydream fantasies. Draco fucks him in determined thrusts, his hand on Harry’s cock the entire time. Harry’s orgasm builds quickly, and he struggles to hold back before remembering that this isn’t a scene — he doesn’t need permission. He comes with a strangled groan and relaxes into his desk while Draco fucks him to completion, loving the feeling of being fucked while he’s over-sensitive and sore.
Harry spent a lot of time thinking over the conversations he’d had with M and Ron and Hermione about his ‘job’, both in his head and in his journal. M had had such a different take on things that it had thrown Harry completely. He’d been told to care for himself plenty of times, but it had always been in the setting of ‘help yourself to help someone else later’. Molly had told him ‘if you don’t eat how will you stay alive to feed others’, Ginny had said ‘you can’t save everyone, and if you let the guilt of that kill you, you won’t be around to save anyone’. They were good sentiments, of course, and at the time he hadn’t been ready to hear anything else. M though, had gone and said, ‘save yourself because you deserve to be saved’ and ‘help yourself because your responsibility is to yourself’. To Harry it felt like a radical thought.
He still wanted to do something that was helpful, but maybe he could find a way to spread warmth without being on fire. Harry figured he had to act while he still felt the determination M had instilled in him, so he wrote Millie and invited her to lunch. She was good at her job, she would help him figure out how to proceed. She was also the only friend he hadn’t invited to the cabin yet, out of some strange fear that he’d see her and decide to go back to being ‘the Chosen One’.
“Please Harry, tell me I’m not the only one who feels terrible right now.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry says. He’s not entirely sure what for, but Draco sounds pained and it’s his fault.
Harry laughs. “I can live with that, as long as I get to take you home from now on.”
“How long until he wakes up.”
December 28th
“Remember when we were talking about things we’re really attracted to?” Harry asked, his blush returning in full. “And how I said I have this weird thing for men in fancy shirts rolling up their sleeves?”
Back in the office they get plenty of back-slaps and congratulations on their catch, Draco accepts it all gracefully and they’re halfway through the Auror offices before he realises Draco is subtly moving them in the direction of their private office. When Draco closes the door behind them ten minutes later he immediately grabs Harry’s face and turns it side to side to study it.
“Well done,” Draco says, walking to stand at the foot of the bed. “You’re being so good for me.”
Harry grabs his invisibility cloak, he’s not ready to be seen by anyone. Not ready to be confronted about his stupid choices. The walk to the Headmistress’ office is almost free of other people, and Harry realises the kids must have left for the summer.
Ginny and Pansy get married on Valentine's day, a year after they got engaged. Harry and Draco are the best men, and they both get a little teary eyed when Pansy and Ginny announce they’re invited to the honeymoon.
Draco steps back, and Harry listens as he puts his cloak on. “Brilliant, let’s go.”
“Perfect,” Harry says, grinning and sitting down. He laughs when the ancient springs creak loudly at his weight. “We’re going to break this sofa, aren’t we?”
Draco leans in slowly, brushing his lips gently against Harry’s. He doesn’t pull back to speak, lips moving gently. “I think we’re both motivated enough to make anything work.”
Harry releases his lip and lets his mouth make whatever sounds it wants while his body shakes and convulses with his orgasm. Malfoy fucks him through it, sending shivers of pleasure through him even as his orgasm fades. Malfoy’s orgasm takes Harry by surprise because his thrusts are hard and rhythmic until the very end. When he comes he groans, placing both hands on Harry’s hips and squeezing hard.
“Naturally,” Draco drawls, for a horrifying second sounding like Snape. “Slytherins look after our own.”
December 18th
“Merlin, you’re so hot,” Daniel says. He runs his hands down Harry’s abdomen and traces his fingers lightly along the waistband of Harry’s jeans.
He got lost in the book, one Draco had lent him about magical pirates, and he jumped a little at the crack when Draco Apparated in.
“I used to dream about this, you know?” Draco murmurs. He closes his hand around his own cock and groans, eyes fluttering shut. “I dreamed about everything from this exact thing, me getting ready to fuck you in your bed, marvelling at how good you look when you’re all flushed and hot and desperate for it. I dreamed about you finding me in France and giving me a blowjob that was all furious and resentful attraction. I dreamed about letting you watch as I finger myself and then riding that wonderful cock of yours until we both come.”
“Potter,” Draco said. His voice was back to the cool hardness he had used earlier, and it did wonders to immerse Harry into their roles.
“Oh joy, we get to visit Azkaban,” Draco says. He considers Harry for a second and reaches into his desk for a bar of chocolate.
“It’s gorgeous,” Harry says, “I’m so happy you’ll have a garden finally.”
“I have people lined up who’d pay good money for you,” Crabbe grins, but his eyes stay cold. “Maybe not quite the job you had in mind, but you’ll be fed and fucked on a regular basis.”
Harry suddenly wants to pull away from Draco before Draco can pull away from him. Of course that’s what’s happening. Draco’s being kind because Harry is obviously falling apart. He’ll put him back together and then he’ll leave for good. Harry’s breath catches and he hates himself for it. If Draco’s only staying to make sure he’s safe, then Harry should pull himself together so Draco doesn’t have to care for him.
Harry escapes to put on his shoes and coat before anyone can insist they should celebrate together. He hears Draco speaking behind the wall, but he can’t make out the words. When Draco joins him in the hallway Harry goes back to the livingroom to get the wand he left behind only to find Pansy and Ginny passionately kissing. He decides to leave the wand and walks out of the flat as fast as his feet will carry him.
Hermione, however, already looks pissed off. A quick glance at Ron, who looks apologetic, tells Harry that he’s sold them both out about something. He only makes it halfway into his seat before Hermione starts talking.
“I wasn’t sure if I was going to fuck you or not,” Malfoy says. “But looking at you now? Looking at how desperate you are to be had? I’m going to fuck you so hard you’ll scream.”
Harry’s hand finds its way inside his pants, and he gasps in relief at the friction. The hard floor doesn’t matter, the dryness of his hand doesn’t bother him – he wants to come. Wants some release for the tension that’s been building over the past week of following Malfoy around. Harry grips himself harder and moves his hand faster. He’s already wet with precome, and he knows it’s going to be over embarrassingly fast. He bites his lip to keep quiet, not fully trusting the silencing spell he’s placed over himself. Merlin, it feels good to let go.
Harry snorted, “As if.”
“We’ll have to bring Ayla, of course,” Draco says. Harry knows he’s trying to sound casual, but his eyes are shining just as bright as Harry imagines his own are. Harry knows he’s missed the closeness he had with Pansy, and he must be feeling the same rush of joy that Harry is, knowing he’s missed and loved.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry blushes and laughs at his reaction. “I wonder how I’m fine making porn but can’t have a conversation about sex without blushing.”
if he could be the boss of them and poison them with drugs." Draco looks disgusted, though Harry isn’t sure if it’s with Crabbe or the stupidity of Aurors.
. Had almost given in too, but then Malfoy had thought; ‘
“What just happened?” Draco asks, gesturing at Harry.
“No, I’d like to sit with you – I need my homework, remember?” Not to mention the fact that he doesn’t want to risk his wrist putting him on the floor again.
Hermione looked like she was trying to hold back a grimace, and Harry couldn’t help but laugh at her.
Ron stared at his wife with huge eyes. “Merlin ‘Mione, you could have told me at least.”
“None at all,” Harry smiles. “Just motivated to put Crabbe behind bars.”
would always be disappointed by Harry. He wanted someone who didn’t want him for his fame, but the people who weren’t interested in fame were utterly disinterested. So, he’d asked Millie to fill his house with people and parties to stave off the loneliness and the heavy realisation that he would never again try to make someone love him. And it had worked, it was working. But of course, Ron and Hermione would never understand that.
Harry fights to hold back the wince the words trigger and smiles instead. He's fine when Ginny, Hermione, or any of the Wesleys tell him they love him. He's fine saying it back, but saying it back now would be a lie. He doesn't know Daniel well enough to love him, not like he loves his friends, and even if he did - he doesn't love him the way Daniel does. He doesn't love Daniel the way he wants to be loved, and Harry can't deny the truth that he doesn't think he will
Ron and Hermione both went quiet at his statement. Only when he looked up at their surprised faces did he realise he’d dropped the L word. He hadn’t meant to say it, but the word rang true in his head. He’d fallen in love with Draco Malfoy. And it was strange, to be in love with a man he hadn’t seen in a decade. But it wasn’t strange, because they’d talked almost every day for the past three months. Harry knew him, and he knew Harry in a way Harry hadn’t let anyone know him before.
“Hard. I mean, uh. Fuck. I mean difficult, but yeah also I guess hard, arousing. Please make me stop talking.”
you went to the Room of Requirement for that book,” she says. “Have you completely forgotten what happened the last time you had it?” She shoots a pointed glance at Malfoy who’s sat down at another table.
“There’s always later,” Harry assures, but gives a sigh of disappointment for Matt’s benefit.
Ron does, and the glamour Harry’s placed to hide the gold band fades into nothing.
Draco rolls his eyes and refills Harry’s glass with a quick Aguamenti. “Idiot, next time tell me and I’ll come with you.”
At least half of Ron and Hermione’s boxes were books, and Harry spent unnecessarily long unpacking them. He decided he should put them in the shelves alphabetically, then alphabetically by author because who sorted their books by title? But then it looked messy so he sorted by colour and size, except Hermione would hate that, so he sorted them back to alphabetically by author again. The garden, in contrast, was a free space in every way. Harry didn’t follow any rules when he worked on it, except keeping what he liked and getting rid of what he didn’t.
“I ¬–,” Harry starts, words curling up in his throat and dying there, apparently.
After hours of working together in the library Harry thinks maybe this bond thing won’t be so terrible after all. Maybe the ‘always’ bit of the spell won’t even work and it’ll just pass on its own in a month. And if it doesn’t, staying close to Malfoy while he figures out how to break it won’t be so bad now that Malfoy isn’t acting like a spoiled brat.
“What do you want?” Harry asks. He sounds angry, but that’s nothing new for him. At least it won’t be new to Malfoy either, Harry suspects he’s one of the few people that won’t be scared of Harry’s anger.
Harry shivers again. “I like that.”
Draco grabs Harry’s legs with slick hands and places them around his hips, and Harry knows he’s about to be fucked. That
and go back to being Harry. And now here he was, disrupting their morning with his sudden crisis.
“Cheers to that,” Harry said, lifting his glass in a toast.
Ron rolled his eyes at his brother and sat down to hear an answer he’d obviously discussed at length before.
December 30th
Ginny goes to get them more shots and drinks, and the night turns blurry. Music flows in Harry’s veins along with the alcohol as they make their way downstairs, dancing and swaying to the beat. Ginny lets a dark-haired girl swirl her away from Harry, and Harry grins when he sees them kissing minutes later. Without Ginny though, he’s alone on the dancefloor, and being alone on the dancefloor always means anything but loneliness. Bodies push close, and he sways along with them.
“Thank you for staying,” Malfoy says. He’s leaning against his desk, hands gripping the wood tight.
It’s strange, the little friendship that has evolved between them over the last few months, and Harry sometimes wonders if he should bring Daniel into it - it’s never felt right though. Harry needs this, something that’s
written on it.
After the first time Harry starts joining Malfoy at breakfast almost daily. He’s surprised to realise that Malfoy doesn’t really talk much, because the way he remembers it Malfoy would talk relentlessly as long as there was anyone around who could conceivably be convinced to listen. Now though, he usually reads the paper and eats his food. He’ll engage in conversation if Harry starts one, but if Harry doesn’t, they’ll just sit in silence. A strangely companionable silence. Maybe it’s the fact that Harry can hear him, even when he doesn’t speak that does it. Because even when they’re both quiet he’ll randomly hear snippets of thoughts about himself.
Harry pulls away from Draco’s warm hand on his knee, and sits as far away as possible on the sofa, pulling his feet up and wrapping his hands around his knees. “I’ll be alright if you leave. I’ve been doing this on my own for ages, you don’t need to be here.”
“What?” he splutters.
Harry tugged at the ropes, wanting to reach out and touch Draco.
“Promise?” Harry says, feeling too raw to deny to himself or Malfoy that this is more than just sex to him. The insecurity in his tone must be as obvious to Malfoy as it is to him, because Malfoy smiles warmly and runs a hand through Harry’s hair, presumably tidying it up a little.
He’d imagined them kissing many times, and it had always been fast and angry, all teeth and fighting for dominance. It’s nothing like he’d imagined it would be. Draco kisses him softly, their lips slotting perfectly together and making Harry’s skin tingle all over. Draco hums into the kiss, running his hands up and down Harry’s back, reaching up to rest his hands in Harry’s hair. Harry moans softly, trying to pull Draco impossible closer. When Draco finally pulls back they’re both breathless.
Harry grins around his toothbrush, feeling refreshed and warm from the shower he just shared with Draco. He’s been
, Harry wonders wildly. Daniel is attractive, he’s the sort of bloke Ron would feel a bit jealous of when he walked by him, because Hermione would stare a little too long. He should return the compliment, right? But it feels awkward, he can’t just throw out a
He wishes he could go to his friends. That he could ask Ron and Hermione to hold him together, or at least keep him company while he falls apart. They don’t know he’s ruined though, that he’s losing the only thing that truly matters, piece by agonizing piece. They don’t know that every time Draco kisses him, Harry wonders if it’ll be the last. They don’t know Draco fucked Harry in the shower a week ago, and that Harry thinks he’ll never do it again - that there won’t be time. Maybe it would have been better if they’d broken it off as soon as the wedding was decided. Harry would have shattered then, he knows, but maybe that would have been better than this slow tearing. In the end, it doesn't matter. Harry knows he’ll stay as long as Draco will have him, and then after... Harry doesn’t like to think about after.
“Harry, I’m sorry we had to do this,” Hermione says. “You’re not yourself.”
“Right,” Harry agrees.
“No, I’m not, I just, er, needed some air?” Harry winces when the excuse comes out sounding like a question.
Draco shrugs and looks back to Harry. “Personally, I don’t really care if there is some sort of feeling others feel that I just can’t, or if it’s just that I have a different preference for relationships than they do – it doesn’t really matter. As long as I know what I want I’m comfortable.”
“Is it weird that I want pizza?” Draco asks when they return from their two weeks in Rome. He’s got a slight tan, and Harry can’t stop thinking how strange he looks without his usually pale skin.
Harry had a vague memory of the cause. Not the event itself, but he remembered Millie explaining the charity to him. He nodded to Hermione.
“Please, Draco,” Harry says, mind too flooded with sensation to make the words more descriptive. Draco’s tongue is alternating between pressing a strong tight heat around his cock and teasing deliciously at the tip. Harry doesn’t know if he wants to move up into the mouth or down onto the fingers, so his hips move jerkingly in desperate search of more.
He doesn’t expect the blush the question prompts.
“How do you feel?” Draco asks, looking carefully at Harry.
Harry melts into the kiss, letting it grow from slow and gentle to so desperate and intense he needs to pull back and gasp for air. He wants more, everything, and they’re not exposed in a hallway anymore so he decides he can have it.
“At all,” Harry says, feeling like a terrible person for getting Daniel all worked up. “I’m really sorry, it’s just – I don’t know. Not right.”
“Morning,” Draco says. He has one of those glints in his eyes Harry’s only ever seen while on a particularly interesting case, only now it’s directed at Harry. It makes him feel like he’s the only thing in the world; like everything outside of the two of them doesn’t exist.
“Harry, my boy,” Dumbledore says, and Harry jumps. He always forgets about the portraits.
Turns out, thinking about the details of what he likes, and what he would like to do with Draco is an exercise in arousal. Harry sits at the kitchen table for hours after Draco leaves, imagining Draco bending him over it and having his way with him. He imagines Draco taking him to bed and tying his hands down. He imagines Draco standing over Harry and looking way too sexy in his cloak, making Harry undress and kneel in front of him. He imagines Draco taking Harry’s belt off and spanking him with it until his arse is red and heated, and then he imagines Draco licking and kneading his sore cheeks. He sits at his kitchen table and pants with arousal and refuses to touch himself because he wants to do this properly. Wants to have answers for Draco when he asks, and wants the next time he comes to be with Draco’s hand around his cock.
Harry laughs. “Merlin, I know
“You won’t regret it Potter, or maybe you will. Maybe I’ll make it so good nobody else will ever measure up and you’ll spend the rest of your life missing being fucked by me.”
Draco cleans his back with the cool towel too, and Harry sighs with pleasure when he presses it softly against his heated arse and whispers a healing charm. He’s almost half asleep when Draco speaks again.
“I sort of assumed you’d want to stay as far away from me as possible during your course here, but instead it seems every time I turn around there you are.”
“Harry! Wake up!”
“Go to bed, pet, I’ll be right up. Don’t touch yourself until I get there.”
when he smiles. Button pushed, apparently. Already. Harry has to get out of here.
“Uh, yeah?” Ginny laughs, snuggling closer to Pansy.
“Hi,” Harry says, feeling stupid. “Can I get you a drink? Uh, I mean tea, it’s only ten. I, uh —,”
. Bloody Malfoy always uses the toilet in his room in the morning, and then doesn’t bother going near one for hours. Harry doesn’t have access to his room, so he doesn’t share the luxury of a private toilet. He’s been conjuring a pot to use and then banishing it for the past few mornings, but he was a bit preoccupied this time. He considers just conjuring a pot now, but the Dining Hall is starting to fill up, and Ron and Hermione will be here any second. Harry takes a deep breath and decides he can hold it, if nothing else it’s an effective distraction from the
how much he wants this. Wants
“What do you want?”
Harry breathes a surprised gasp at the whisper in his ear. It’s different to how it had been with the bond, more like it’s coming from Draco himself than some disembodied version of him standing behind Harry.
December 29th
Draco shuffles closer from his kneeling position between Harry’s legs until his knees rest against the inside of Harry’s thighs. He hooks his arms under Harry’s knees and lifts them up, placing his hands down on the bed beside Harry’s chest effectively keeping his legs pinned. Harry feels exposed and open, and his breath comes faster  with anticipation of what’s next. He feels Draco’s cock against his rim, moving up and down as Draco jerks his hips.
“While that’s a valid point and all, I don’t see how it’s relevant to the predicament of me being in love with Draco Malfoy.”
“That might be so,” Draco drawls reluctantly, “but at least he’d have been off the streets by now.”
“This is over two months ago, he never followed it up?” Harry asks, frowning at the note.
“Oh,” Harry says, wondering if that’s a philosophy he should accept in more parts of his life too. “Alright then.”
is happy.”
Harry set to work really sucking Draco off. He wrapped one of his hands around the base of Draco’s cock and used the other to urge him to thrust his hips. He wanted Draco to set the pace, wanted to feel how his thrusts would become faster and faster as he grew more desperate for release. When Draco got the idea and started pushing into Harry’s hand and mouth they both groaned, and the sound seemed to set Draco off, his thrusts becoming faster. Harry’s hair was still securely in Draco’s grip, and the combined sensation of Draco holding on to his hair and using his mouth to please himself sent electric currents of lust and pleasure through Harry’s veins.
“Fuck,” Draco breathes and in that single word Harry can finally see just how aroused Draco is too. Harry isn’t the only one deeply affected by this and the knowledge warms him from the inside out.
Harry winces at the anger in his tone, and to his horror has to wipe away a couple of tears. He feels too raw, too everything.
“Praise kink, huh?” Draco mused, running his hands up the length of Harry’s thighs and brushing lightly over his balls before returning his attention to Harry’s arse. “I like it.”
“Living here I’m still shocked at how easy it can be,” Harry admitted. “I mean, I get up and have a long shower because it feels good. I make myself a nice breakfast and eat it in the garden while I read. Then I work on the garden, or chop firewood, or clean, or cook. And everything I do is just for me, because I like it. Or at least the effect of it, I don’t think I’ll ever enjoy cleaning, but I like to have it clean.”
In response to Harry’s question Draco stood from the table so fast his chair wobbled and almost fell to the ground and used the hand that was holding Harry’s to drag him to his feet as well. They stood close. Close enough that Harry could see the faint freckles on Draco’s nose, and how his pupils widened at their proximity. They breathed hard and fast, and Harry could feel his chest brush up against Draco when they both inhaled at the same time.
He relished in the feeling for a while, grinning to himself until his stomach rumbled and broke the moment. He heated some soup on the gas stove, happy that it wasn’t reliant on electricity to work. He had to order food sometime soon, but he could live off the soup and bread Ron had given him for a few days at least. He wasn’t too keen on communicating with anyone just yet. Merlin, people would demand answers the second he returned to the world – and Harry wasn’t sure he would ever be ready for that. Was this even a good thing? Running away to the woods to find himself. Maybe he was just hiding in a different way.
like how it makes me feel and then I don’t really want to touch them or look at them at all, and I feel kinda bad afterwards.”
“Plus, it’ll likely come up in our NEWT exams, right?” Harry asks, turning to smile at Malfoy.
Harry watches Daniel in silence, trying and failing to feel a rush of desire for the man that so obviously wants him. And fuck, he wants to want Daniel. He knows he’ll probably enjoy what he has planned if he could just close his eyes and feel it, but it doesn’t seem right to Daniel and the longer Harry looks at him, the less he wants him.
Draco ran his hands up Harry’s back and let them rest along the nape of his neck, fingers gently toying with the ends of Harry’s hair. “I know. That’s partly why I can finally do this. Thank you.”
“Mmh, I love you too,” Harry smiled, sighing contentedly into the sheets. “Might fall asleep like this.”
Draco comes out of the Pensieve with a gasp, and Harry has to remind himself that coming out of a Pensieve feels like coming out of water. Draco isn’t gasping at a memory, just the feeling of breathing right again.
Harry rushes out of his room and hopes Ginny and Pansy are still awake because he needs to talk about this right away. He finds them on the sofa snogging, and he doesn’t waste time sitting down heavily in the armchair, being sure to make enough noise that they’ll know he’s there.
The North side of the castle has been blocked off from the rest. They enter through a new door on the ground floor. It looks to be set up mainly with classrooms. Walking up the stairs they find a dining hall and a common room. On the final floor they find their rooms. Harry had worried, at first, that they would have to share like they had when they were actual students here. Luckily, someone decided being an adult should get you the luxury of a private room.
“I just know, I guess,” Harry sighs, “but it should feel different with Daniel, right? You love Pansy differently than me, don’t you?”
“This isn’t just –,” Malfoy begins before he cuts himself off, fist clenching and unclenching at his sides.
Ron holds Harry’s wand out without saying anything and Harry casts the counter spell on his wrist. The golden band glides off instantly, and it’s the most anticlimactic moment of his life. He doesn’t feel any different.
“I didn’t start out vanilla, I er, I didn’t start at all.” Harry closed his eyes, finding comfort in the bonds around his hands and feet. “You’ll be my first.”
Malfoy doesn’t speak his thoughts out loud, instead closing his hands over Harry’s for a second before letting them go and helping with the buttons.
“Fuck,” Harry whispered when Draco gave a rough tug, moving his hands in separate directions and making Harry shiver. Even after the pulling stopped Harry’s scalp tingled, and it sent shivers of pleasure down his spine.
Ron holds up two sheets of paper. “They’ve put us on completely different schedules. We don’t have a single class together all week.”
“Bulstrode contacted us, by the way,” Ron said. “She seemed really concerned about you.”
“I feel like I should be taking care of you,” Harry admits. “You made me feel absolutely brilliant.”
She doesn’t sound accusing, and Harry loves her even more for it.
“Emotionally too? Fuck I can’t believe how low humans can sink, shitstains on society the both of them! Human-trafficking? I could
“Are you sure?” Ron asks, looking like he has half a mind to join Harry and put off his homework.
Harry smiles, loving the knowledge that Malfoy wants to see him just as much as Harry wants to look at Malfoy. He grabs the back of his shirt and pulls it over his head in one move, stepping close to Malfoy before he has the chance to really look so he can feel their chests moving against each other as they both breathe heavily.
“That’s sub drop,” Draco explains. “When you feel like shit after. That’s what happens when you have no boundaries, no safe-words and no aftercare. Fuck, I could kill every single Dom you’ve ever met because they didn’t teach you this.”
Harry doesn’t know if it’s a walk of shame or a walk of Pride when you leave your almost hookup with a date and a strange mix of pride and shame at not having made it a full-on hookup. Anyway, it’s not much of a walk at all when you apparate from hallway to hallway. He’d ended up sleeping on Daniel’s sofa for the night since he’d been too drunk to apparate and he and Ginny didn’t have a fireplace. He left before Daniel woke up, and that had to be part of the hookup experience, even if he hadn’t gone through with the thing.
Malfoy, thankfully, doesn’t laugh. Instead, he keeps staring at Harry with a curious look.
Ron stood up and walked out of the room, and Harry watched him go with growing resentment for his outbreak. He’d let his front down and all it did was hurt.
Harry makes the effort of sitting up before looking at Draco again. He looks worried.
“Did it go OK?” Draco asks, clipping the leash back into Ayla’s harness.
“You look lighter,” Ron said.
Draco gasps and dramatically places a hand over his heart. “You can’t be sick of pizza! That’s an insult to, I don’t know, everything! But we should probably get something else. After the amazing pizzas we’ve had recently, anything we order will be a massive disappointment.”
“Congratulations! I’m so happy for you both!” Harry says, smiling as he feels Ginny laugh into his hair.
“Draco,” Harry gasps. He never wants this to end, and yet all he wants is to feel the rush of orgasm flood his body. He wants to watch Draco’s face open with pleasure, wants to feel his cock spasm and spurt inside him.
Harry looked up at his friend and saw the earnest expression on his face. He really meant it then, that it would be alright for Harry to just… stop.
Five Cuba Libre’s later Harry feels relaxed and happy, smiling and pointing out girls he thinks Ginny should go talk to. Ginny returns the favour by pointing at various boys she figures Harry should go kiss. When she points to someone who looks suspiciously like some bloke Harry thinks might have been in Ravenclaw he frowns.
Draco huffs a breath, and Harry’s laugh only becomes louder at the sight.
“I’ll come too,” Hermione says. “I can prepare for next week’s lessons.”
Fuck, what’s wrong with him that he can’t look at Daniel without his erection flagging? It had been the same with Ginny, and the girl he’d had sex with after that. His desire is selfish, turned in towards himself and what the person he’s with can make him feel – it has nothing to do with Daniel. In fact, Daniel seems to have a detrimental effect on his desire.
“I’m getting a dog,” he says when the credits start rolling.
crush on Malfoy. Like, all-consuming, head over heels, arse over tit crush. Since fifth year, I’m pretty sure – after you got over that crush on me.”
Draco looks at him, biting his lip like he’s holding something back.
“M. He’s Draco Malfoy.” Harry let the words fall out of him, and they came easier than he’d thought they would, like he had been holding them back from escaping.
“Draco, they’re wrong. I promise. Merlin, I’m in love with you!” Harry says, desperate to make Draco believe him.
don’t stop, the more I want.”
Merlin the voice in his ear really isn’t helping un-push the button, not when it’s saying things like that in an almost sensual whisper. Is he hearing Malfoy’s thoughts? He can’t be, right? Malfoy doesn’t think Harry looks attractive kneeling on the floor and gaping up at him. Except the fact that Harry’s eyes are still on his crotch might be sending an impression of something and fuck Harry needs to do something that isn’t stare at the fly of Malfoy’s trousers.
Harry laughs, and it feels soothing on his headache. “Start from scratch then?”
to have Szechuan beef. I’m sure you weren’t even hungry, but you smelled the food and suddenly you had to have it. Ginny makes me feel like that all the time.”
“Not emotionally, no,” Hermione says, walking in with a glass of wine in her hand.
They both collapsed onto the floor after they came, trousers and shorts around their knees and still dressed from the waist up. After catching his breath, Harry laughed.
“Yes,” Harry agrees, tilting his head to give Draco better access.
to him first.
“And a loving husband, of course,” added Ron.
Ron laughs. “I think you’ll find the funniest part is the teacher has written down the books from both sixth and seventh year on the curriculum. How they expect us to learn two years’ worth of classes in a few months is beyond me.”
Draco set an unrelenting pace, fucking Harry hard and fast as Harry gasped and moaned and cursed into the sheets. He wasn’t going to last. He’d been on edge for too long, and as desperately as he wanted this to go on forever, Harry was so close his eyes watered with the effort to hold back his orgasm as Draco slammed into his prostate again and again.
looked back. Feeling almost ready to face the day, Harry drank a Pepper-Up with extra caffeine and cast a glance to the letter and the Prophet article he had hanging on his wall. They served as daily reminders as to why he lived his life the way he did.
“What sort of place were you looking for?” Ron asked.
They make a regular thing out of the movie-nights. Sometimes Ginny and Pansy join them, and on a few occasions, Ron and Hermione join too. Harry and Draco had both been in fits over how frustrated Ron was that the characters onscreen wouldn’t listen to him when he clearly told them what they needed to do in order to not be murdered by the guy with an axe.
Harry grimaces, “I could tell you, but it involves food poisoning and I don’t want to put us off it.”
Ron steps closer, and Harry thinks for a second he’s about to reach through the barrier to touch Harry but he stops just outside it.
He wakes to the sound of footsteps thundering up the stairs to his bedroom. For a second he thinks Matt must have come back, and he searches the room for what he might have forgotten. He only finds sunlight shining in through his window, and for half a distracted second he just stares at the dust-particles dancing in the light. Then the footsteps stop and his bedroom door opens.
“Platonic partners,” Harry grins, summoning glasses and a bottle of Riesling because friendships deserve to be toasted too.
Draco’s hands froze halfway through cutting his potato in half, and when Harry looked up at his face he was staring blankly at the wall, clearly lost in thought.
. “Yeah, alright.”
“I think you’re following me because you’re
“What type of bonding spell?” Harry asks, his own voice foreign to his ears.
“What did you do?” Harry asks.
“Care to explain?” Malfoy asks, and Harry gets the feeling he’s genuinely asking. That he’ll accept it if Harry just says no.
Draco sat up and fixed Harry with an intense gaze. The openness Harry had grown so used to seeing on Draco’s face disappeared, closing him off to the other man’s emotions.
“The Pensieve?” Harry asks, confused. “Why?”
Draco looked nothing like he had at sixteen, Harry thought, yet so shockingly similar at the same time. His hair was still the same almost white, but it hung loosely around his face. His features were still striking with high, defined cheekbones and a straight nose. He had filled out a little and was clearly fit. The biggest difference to the last time Harry had seen him though, was how he held himself. Where he’d radiated arrogance at sixteen, he now seemed more quietly confident. Though his current expression was one of sadness.
They sit on the sofa in comfortable silence until Harry’s raw nerves are covered in a protective film and he feels more like himself than he’s done in as long as he can remember. Draco’s steady presence helps more than Harry could have imagined, and he remains seated next to him even after he starts to feel better. He doesn’t want to stand up and face the conversation he knows they need to have about him breaking their deal to never work without backup. Eventually though, he knows it’ll have to happen and maybe it’ll be better to get it over with.
“Oh wonderful,” Draco says when he opens the door to see Harry. “I found the sequel to that movie we saw last time, Legally Blonde? This one is about dogs and I wanted to see it. Let’s go to your flat.”
“Not sure it counts when it’s never more than two dates and when you don’t even try to let them get to know you,” Ron said, giving Harry a sympathetic look.
“And I hope you’re comfortable, learning from me,” Malfoy adds.
Harry stared at his expression in the mirror and frowned at the sight of himself. His hair was a mess, his eyes looked bloodshot and the bags under them were an impressive dark purple. And, as if in celebration of his birthday, a couple of faint wrinkles had showed up between his brows. He looked almost as bad as he had during the war, and he had no excuse for it. His life was fine. He grabbed the potions to make his hair and face look presentable and when he looked back up into the mirror
“That’s a brilliant idea Ron,” Hermione said, beaming at her husband.
become pretty good at it.
Harry laughs, holding out his hand to summon his wand that got lost somewhere with his robes. “Now who’s forgetting they’re a wizard?”
“Draco,” Harry gasped. His hands moved from Draco’s shoulders to his waist to his hair, unable to settle on a single spot. “Fuck.”
“You’re welcome back to my club anytime you like,” Malfoy says, grinning.
Harry gave a soft moan of appreciation for the praise, and the vibrations of it made Draco groan and move his hips faster. And fuck, Harry moved his fist harder to match. His own cock was dripping precome now, and he was lost. Lost to the sensations and the pleasure and the desperate want for this man. His orgasm struck entirely without warning, a final drop of pleasure making everything spill over and sending heat through his body in shocks of blinding pleasure. His toes curled and his free hand closed around Draco’s knee to ground himself as he moaned helplessly around Draco’s cock, shaking with his release.
Draco exhales heavily and sinks into his chair. Harry’s heard this story before, though they’d both been drunk at the time. He knows it isn’t over yet.
Crabbe walks closer, and Harry struggles against Matt’s grip. He should get his wand out too, he should do
It was painful, actually, but the bigger problem seems to be that Harry is physically incapable of walking away from the dining hall. The room where Malfoy is sitting. The man whose voice Harry has heard talking softly in his ear.
Harry tries again to reach out, but his hand bounces off the barrier. “Bloody hell Hermione, will you take this thing down?”
or whatever. Staring up at Malfoy now Harry suspects they might both be right. Malfoy is introducing himself, talking about his time in France and his credentials and Harry only half pays attention, because none of it is news to him. He’s kept tabs on Malfoy ever since the war. And it’s not because he thinks Malfoy is still a Death Eater. It’s just – he’s curious.
His conversation with the Mystery Man last night had helped soothe that fear. It hadn’t been difficult for Harry to just
The balcony is somehow ten times the size it used to be, and covered in thick grass. Alya runs onto it and starts sprinting around in circles, her tail wagging so hard Harry’s afraid it might hurt.
There's an awkward silence behind the door and Harry knows he's being immature and stupid, but he can't help it.
"Fine, but then we need to wait until tomorrow. I'll need some time to update you on my backstory, and find a Glamour and story for you." Harry finishes with a yawn and lets the past week of sleepless nights wash over him. The second yawn comes without being forced.
“I feel lighter,” Harry said, his back still turned to Ron as he placed firewood slower than really necessary. “I’m not quite ready to return to the world yet though.”
“Naan I can do,” Harry laughs and gets off the sofa to order some.
“Perfectly,” Harry smiles.
“Classes are about to end,” Malfoy says. His lips close around Harry’s neck and suck and Harry forgets entirely about the words. The words don’t matter, or classes, or other people. The only thing that matters is that Malfoy doesn’t stop doing the thing he’s doing.
It takes them two weeks to retrace the steps of the previous Aurors on the case. Two weeks of dead-ends and pointless interviews. One particularly memorable Witch had led them into her house, claiming Crabbe was inside, only to point at the stuffed cat she had standing on her mantel.
“Right, sorry – er I mean, right.”
Harry looked up at Hermione, who had been strangely quiet about his revelation. She was biting her lip and looked strangely guilty.
“That’s true,” Draco muses. “We’re about to close a decade-old case, after all.”
“Me too,” Harry admits. He doesn’t say he had no idea himself until Ron brought it up.
“Gin,” Harry says when she breaks away from the kiss. “When you guys talk about people being hot, or seeing some random person on the street and feeling all hot and bothered, is that a real thing?”
“Mental and physical how?” Harry demands.
“You’re curious about me?” Malfoy asks, pushing off the wall where he’s been leaning and taking a step closer to Harry. “Why don’t I believe that’s the full story?”
“You’re a quick one, aren’t you?” Harry laughs, filling the bowl with the amount of food the shelter had recommended and grinning down at his new dog as she eats.
“It’s true though, isn’t it?” Harry says.
“Ah – yes the all-inclusive,” Pansy says. “Unlike this bed, which is far too tiny and only rooms two people. I vote we get into Ginny’s unnaturally large bed or go to the sofa and open another bottle of wine.”
Malfoy gives Harry another
his dream. He’ll get there, he just needs a minute. Probably. Hopefully.
“I walked up to the café, and I saw you, through the window. You were reading that book, and you had obviously tried to tame your hair. You looked so fucking handsome and nervous and excited, and I just knew that if I walked in, I’d break your heart.”
Harry stares. “I always assumed it was the tortured screaming that gave it away.”
“Yes,” Harry says, surprising himself by sounding almost out of breath with the need to make Malfoy believe him. “I don’t think you’re evil, or up to something bad. I swear. But I never know with you, what you’re thinking or feeling, or why you do the things you do. And I know my curiosity usually lands me in the stupidest situations, but I can’t help it with you.”
“Fuck,” Harry groans, throwing his head back and letting the sensations of Draco’s cock slamming into him rush through him. His body still feels sensitive and charged from the spanking, and he won’t last long. Not with Draco’s cock rubbing against his prostate with every thrust. Not when it’s Draco.
Malfoy bites into a piece of his grapefruit, and Harry stares transfixed as his tongue darts out to lick at the stray drops of juice.
He sits down on the floor to look at her, and his heart melts when she lays her head on his leg when she’s done eating. “And a cuddly one too, I see.”
“Nap.”
“Merlin, I can’t believe I’m back here,” Ron groans.
“Aromatic?” Ron asks, looking puzzled. “You smell –.”
“And if you don’t like it, or want to stop?” Draco demanded.
“You told Matt you thought you’d lose your job next week, yeah?” Draco asks. “I figure we give it at least the weekend before we text the number he gave you. That makes it more believable that you’ve lost your job by the time you make contact, and it gives Matt a chance to speak to Crabbe about you.”
Harry took a bite as well, and yeah, the tomatoes were good. Fresh and with more taste than any tomato he’d bought at the store. Still, they weren’t that good. They weren’t good enough to make Harry want to keep eating them when he could use his mouth for things that looked so much more appetising. Like kissing Draco or licking his neck along the collar of his shirt. Or sucking Draco’s fingers into his mouth, or gasping for air while Draco made him see stars.
“Told you that would be a useful skill,” he says, smiling at Harry.
“I hardly think it’s relevant to the case,” Draco smirks. He walks over to Crabbe and flips him over with his boot. “Now let’s call the others in to arrest what really should have ended as a stain on a dirty mattress somewhere.”
They haven’t spoken much since that day in the library. Mostly, Harry puts his cloak on and follows Malfoy around. He tries to keep his distance, tries not to listen in on conversations or pay too close attention – usually he fails. He’s always been too curious about Malfoy for his own good, but this time the curiosity is different. It’s not about what Malfoy is up to, it’s about knowing him. Harry wants to
December 19th
The sunlight has disappeared from outside his window, and Harry casts a Tempus that tells him Draco will already have gone to bed. Tomorrow though, Draco will leave his room at 6.30 am and Harry will be there waiting for him.
is about to fuck him, and it’s all too much and not enough all at the same time. He fixes his eyes on the ceiling and breathes hard, gasping as he feels the head Draco’s cock rub over his rim. His hips twitch upward, silently begging Draco to
“I wasn’t obsessed, I thought he was up to something. And I was fucking right!”
The fingers in his hair tightened and Harry moaned, moving his head forward as Draco pulled back to make the tugging rougher. Draco was close enough that the motion brought Harry’s face in contact with his bulging trousers and they both gasped. Harry opened his mouth and experimentally breathed hot air over the bulge before following it with his tongue and wetting the trousers with it. The realisation that Harry was completely naked and Draco was still clothed struck Harry, and he felt his cock swell. He should have realised sooner of course, but Harry was so caught up in Draco, and in the bonds on his wrists and ankles, and the ache in his knees, that he found his brain working slower. Draco seemed to realise at the same time as Harry because he looked down at the trousers Harry was mouthing at and growled in frustration before he spelled them off too.
Thank you for reading! Comments and kudos are always appreciated ♥️
Harry was prepared for Draco to pull his head close and making Harry suck him off. Fuck, he wasn’t just prepared, he wanted it. He wanted to taste Draco’s heavy cock on his tongue, wanted to know how it felt to have it pushing against the back of his throat. Harry wanted to make Draco gasp and moan in delight as Harry hummed around his swollen prick. He wanted Draco to keep his hands firm in Harry’s hair and use it to guide his head in the rhythm he liked. Draco seemed content to take his time though, alternating between tugging roughly at Harry’s hair and running soothing fingers over his scalp again and again, leaving Harry gasping for breath and his cock wet with precome.
Harry gets off the bed and opens the door. “I think I need to just relax tonight,” Harry says. “Settle in, you know?”
“Yeah, I do.”
History repeats itself, but in such cunning disguise that we never detect the resemblance until the damage is done.
Draco reached out across the table and intertwined his fingers with Harry’s. “I don’t see why all the moments we shared on the site can’t be dates. We shared meals, we shared conversations. We even shared emotions and personal struggles. It’s hardly a first date if we’re already in love, is it?”
“Well, someone had to call out that bigoted, ignorant –,” Hermione paused and took a deep breath to calm herself, “man.”
Malfoy reaches for the plate Harry’s made for him and grins back. “Apparently we know each other’s preferred breakfasts.”
Draco didn’t stop. His hips thrust again and again at an irregular pace, the only indication that he was almost as far gone as Harry. His hand kept a firm grip on Harry’s cock, and he leaned down to bite at Harry’s earlobe and Harry was gone.
Part of Harry wanted to hate him. To feel horrified that the person he’d been speaking to all along was Draco Malfoy, but he couldn’t muster the feeling. Draco was M and he was Malfoy, and Harry couldn’t help his feelings despite it. Because of it.
Once he’s claimed the word for himself though, he feels a growing cloud of guilt building over his head. He feels truly happy with himself for the first time in a long time, but only Ginny, Pansy and Draco know. He hasn’t told Ron and Hermione, and he knows they worry over him. He doesn’t want his orientation to be some secret that creates a wedge between him and his oldest friends.
“Pour the champagne!” Draco insists from somewhere behind him, and Harry takes the bottle from Ginny and busies himself with the glasses while he listens to Pansy explain how they’d made a date of shopping for rings for each other.
“No emotional hangover then?” Draco asks, grinning at Harry.
Suddenly faced with Draco’s naked erection Harry pulled back a little to study it. Draco's cock was fucking gorgeous, and Harry’s fantasies about the man grew in potency with the knowledge of how he really looked when he was naked and aroused. After a moment of letting Harry take in the sight of his naked groin, Draco dropped his wand on the floor and used both hands to grab hold of Harry’s hair. Harry gasped and closed his eyes, forgetting all about the delicious cock in front of him in order to focus completely on the tugging and pulling of his hair. Draco used his grip on Harry’s hair to pull his head from side to side and twisted his fingers around the locks, sending shivers of pain and pleasure rushing through Harry.
“I don’t want to be like you,” Harry says, beyond caring if it’s rude. “Life fucking sucks, and I don’t want to go through it alone. I
“Thanks for this,” he says, leaving the office before any more dead headmasters start to talk to him about his love-life. Or lack thereof.
“I love you too,” he said. “Let’s not be scared of the intensity anymore.”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. He was floating, relishing in the feeling of Draco on him and in him, and the pleasurable tingle still present in his spent body.
Harry blushes and bites his lip, and can’t quite keep from crossing his legs. Fuck, he has to ask or he’s going to have a fucking accident right here in the hallway.
"Well, my Glamour does. A little."
“We’ll certainly try,” Malfoy says, grinning. He doesn’t sit, instead he starts to unbutton his shirt. Harry’s pleased to see he’s already managed to put some wrinkles on the usually pristine fabric, but he loses his train of thought when Malfoy removes the shirt. He’s gorgeous. He’s filled out, over the years, and it suits him so well Harry can’t breathe. He looks soft and inviting and Harry wants him so much he has to stand up again to touch him.
Harry grinned. Draco didn’t know which one was the basil, and he was embarrassed to admit it. It was a small thing, but it was also a forceful reminder of the man he’d got to know through text. The one who hated being caught out not knowing something. “They’re on the right side, close to the end. They’re all marked.”
. Time passes though, and when his Tempus tells him the ceremony is over and Draco still hasn’t returned Harry realises Sirius was wrong. It wasn’t hope itself that killed, it was the agonizing pain and humiliation you felt when it turned out there had been nothing to hope for. It was the fact that you’d do anything to avoid letting yourself hope again.
“So before you watch this,” Harry says, “how does this ‘partner-with-benefits’ thing work with just, regular sex?”
Harry turned then, tomato still in hand, to look at Draco. “What are you doing here?”
As if to prove the truth of his words Draco pushes his hips down, his hardening cock grinding against Harry’s thigh. He leans down and places his mouth on Harry’s neck, licking gently.
“Fuck,” he says. “I’m the teacher, I have to go back to class.”
Harry hesitates. “Uhm, the whole thing?”
October 8th
Harry thought they had a point. He also thought it swerved right past the issue.
Harry opens his mouth to ask what the everloving fuck Draco is talking about, but Draco steps closer and pulls him into a kiss before he has the chance. Harry startles, but doesn’t waste any time in putting his hands around Draco and pulling him closer.
“Those fireworks look a lot like the ones they sell at Weasleys Wizard Wheezes,” he says, and “that Gandalf bloke looks kinda like Dumbledore, don’t you think?”
sink in it's fine.
“If you try to kiss me I’ll kick you in the shin,” he says, apparently unable to land on an emotion.
“What’s wrong?” Harry asks, swiping a sausage off Ron’s plate while he waits for his answer.
“Where else would I be?” Harry asks, yawning. He’s glad he’d thought ahead and anticipated the call, because the pyjamas he’s wearing can only help sell his story.
“Of course,” Malfoy agrees and leads Harry off the stage.
“Hmm,” Draco murmured into Harry’s clavicle. “I imagine I’d look you up and down and ask...”
“I love you,” Harry says. The words escape him entirely without his permission, but now that they’re out they feel so good he refuses to take them back.
“Yeah,” Draco says. “Even then.”
"But I don't think I can fit into that space. I thought I could, I thought if I gave it enough time I'd want to, but I just can't. I don't think the feelings you want are something I'm capable of having. I don't think I'll ever look at someone and want sex. And I have so much love in me to give, but I don't think I'll ever be
“Honestly? I think because he chose me, and I can never choose so it was easier.”
Harry grins and drifts off to sleep.
like, my Doms or whatever.”
“For several years, yes,” Draco admits. “Hence the part about us being the true idiots all along.”
He looks more dangerous in the dimly lit alley than he did in a dimly lit club, and Harry breathes through the fear that rushes through him and makes his heart pound. He’s going to have to explain to Draco that he knows this man, this scary-looking criminal, and Draco won’t let up until he knows how.
“Now, don’t get too excited,” Pansy insists. “Ginny and I will be spending a lot of time making kisses and whatnot, so be prepared to entertain yourselves and each other when we’re feeling romantic.”
“Matt,” calls an angry voice from the darkness. Harry can’t see his face, but he hears Draco’s gasp next to him. The man takes a step forward, and light hits his face. It is, without a doubt, Crabbe. Matt hands Martin his drugs and takes the money before turning and walking towards Crabbe. Seconds later Martin leaves the alley, breathing hard. The memory fades out when he rounds the corner.
“Yeah, we could have made life a lot easier for ourselves if we’d just hooked up sooner,” Malfoy says. “So, what did you want to do this evening? I assume you’re alright with people watching, seeing as you make porn and agreed to the exhibitionist room.”
Harry grinned at that.
“You don’t have to claim the aromantic orientation if you don’t want to,” Draco says. “Just – don’t try so hard to push yourself to want something you don't. I’ve hated seeing how hard you tried to want things you didn’t, with Daniel, and how guilty it made you feel.”
“Alright,” Daniel says. He starts pulling at him and Harry follows. He only opens his eyes when he stumbles over the edge of a carpet and almost falls over.
“Of course, I believe Minerva hid it in that cabinet over by the globe,” Dumbledore says, sounding just like he had when he lived.
“You’ve never called me ‘Mione,” Hermione observed. “It’s always Hermione even when pretty much everyone else has abbreviated.”
“That’s what asking for consent looks like,” Draco says. “See how nice that feels?”
“Well, duty calls,” he said, turning back to the brunette. “I’ll see you later, yeah?”
“Fuck!” Draco groans, “Do you know what this means? It means we’re the office idiots. I can’t believe this!”
“Idiot,” Harry said again, laughing. The hurt he’d been feeling for the past week had vanished, and it left so much room for relief and joy that he felt like he might burst with it. “Yes, that’s a yes. Now come on, we’re overdue for a date.”
“Actually, there’s this thing I’ve been thinking about,” Harry said, cheeks heating. Draco made him brave, but Harry didn’t think anything could stop him blushing.
“Good,” Draco smiles, “and it gives me time to do this.”
“I’m shit with plants,” Harry laughs. “The only reason that thing is still hanging on is Neville feeding it some potion every time he comes over. I’d throw it out, but I actually think he’d be upset.”
wanted so Harry could please him.
It doesn’t take long before Ginny’s spelling his door open and getting into bed with him. Harry takes comfort in her presence and wonders how he can enjoy sharing a bed with her for the second time in a day, when doing so with Daniel was always something to endure.
Malfoy looks confused for a few steps before his eyes widen in realisation.
The chocolate warms him inside and out, and Harry isn’t entirely sure if it’s the chocolate itself or the feeling of being cared for by Draco. The warmth fades when they get to Azkaban though, because Draco is right. The dementors may be gone, but they left something behind. That, or the dark tint to the magic of everyone there has done something to the castle. By the time they get back to the office they’re both drained and exhausted, and Harry feels like they’ve wasted a whole day.
“You know what I think? I think you’ve been hard for a while, sitting here having this conversation. I think you’ve been imagining me bending you over any hard surface in this room and having my way with you. Am I right?”
Harry wants everything. He wants to touch and taste and feel. He wants Malfoy’s hands on him, in him. He wants to watch as Malfoy lets go. And he wants to hear it. The thoughts. The little words of adoration and confirmation Malfoy thinks, but never says out loud. He doesn’t want to lose it. Not yet.
He stands for a while just looking at Ron and Hermione’s house and decides that today is the day he’s going to tell them about being aromantic, that he’s found something that fits him and that it finally feels like he can be happy. It feels strange though, to come out as not wanting something. He hadn’t even hesitated to come out as bi to them when he’d started seeing Daniel, but this feels different somehow. For all he knows they might not even believe it’s a real thing, they could just think he hasn’t met the right person yet.
Harry breathes deeply and lets the slight friction of the rope ground him to the moment. His erection is achingly hard now, and the ropes are already making him hyper-aware of his own body. How his skin is heated against the cold room, and how Malfoy’s fingers run across it as he ties knot after knot down Harry’s back and chest. When he pauses Harry looks down at himself and sees the rope is tied in a diamond pattern down his chest. Harry’s arms are still free, but he can’t move without feeling the rope pull and tighten around him. He feels powerful, and it feels misplaced until he realises he loves how he looks like this. He loves how he’ll look to everyone watching, how desperate they’ll feel watching him like this. It’s a kind of power he’s never had, and he loves it.
“Oh, yeah, that’s… I don’t know why I’m surprised, really,” Ron said. “I knew you were falling for M, and I mean – you were pretty obsessed with Malfoy back in school.”
“Anyways, Pansy and I had this cramped and terrible balcony and I felt safe there, but it was so ugly. It took me ages but I worked out how to cast an Undetectable Extension Charm on an open space and after that the rest was simple. I just thought it would be nice for all of us to have an outside space so I did the same here.”
Ginny and Pansy both glow with happiness, and Harry is so happy for them he could burst. At the same time though, he’s so sad for himself that he’s afraid his grin will break any second. His life had been perfect an hour ago, because somehow he’d let himself forget that for most people friendship is just a way to starve off the loneliness until they find a girlfriend or boyfriend. He’d let himself forget he was just a placeholder for something better.
Harry had worried ever since he and M started to really get along that the spark wouldn’t be there when they met. Sure, he’d been attracted to the personality behind the words, but he’d worried that it wouldn’t translate. That he’d meet the man and see a stranger to whom he felt no attraction, sexual or romantic. He hadn’t needed to worry.
Harry grimaces, thinking quietly that he might just decide to skip that. The people that matter the most to him know, and he doesn’t really feel the need to expand on that list. Not because he’s ashamed, but because he thinks he’ll be happier if he doesn’t have to keep explaining the inner workings of his brain to everyone around him. He’s in no rush to tell Molly at least.
Harry moves his jaw and winces a little, but manages to stand without falling over. “Yeah, just bruised. Maybe a tad concussed.
“It’s not about what I like though, it’s about what
“Please what?” Draco asked, his voice hoarse with arousal.
Harry walks into the empty club feeling almost electric. This will be something new entirely. Not because of the bondage; he’s tried that with Ron a couple of times just to make sure he's into it. And he knows he likes making porn for other people to watch. No, what’s new is that there will be people watching him as it happens. People Harry can see and hear.
“So this is Ayla,” the shelter employee tells them as she brings them to a stop in front of a cage with a curly brown dog inside. “You said you wanted a younger one and she’s only about eight or nine months old. We think she was a Christmas present that owners lost interest in when the summer holls came along.”
Feeling a cold fist of panic close around his guts Harry hurries to cast cleaning and freshening charms over himself. He’s craving a shower, but at least this way he’ll stay clean. He wants to summon a change of clothes from his room like he’s done in the previous days, but he doesn’t think he’ll have time to change into them. Shit, and he’s still hard despite the panicked rush and the uncomfortable tingle of the strongest cleaning charm he knows.
be. After taking a deep breath Harry realised the matches were sorted by ‘potential for love’. He winced at the wording but clicked on the match at the top of the list, determined to send a message. The match was listed on the site as ‘away’, but as long as they weren’t logged out, like Harry had been, their Po-cuter should ping to let them know of a new message. He crossed his fingers they’d hear it and be free to reply.
Daniel keeps taking up space in his life, and it’s
“I’m not
“The Room of Requirement!” Harry exclaims suddenly, inspiration striking. “Do you think everything burned down?”
.’ He groans and turns over in his empty bed. Draco had loved him, and Harry had betrayed his trust. But Draco had loved him. At least he’d thought he did.
As they walk out of the dining hall Harry feels his wrist get colder, he takes another few steps and suddenly the band around his wrist tightens and pulls him forcefully back, making Harry fall flat on his arse.
“I promise,” Harry says. Then he takes a moment to think, and realises there is something Draco deserves to know. And maybe something Harry deserves to say. “I have these moods sometimes where I feel just, uhm, completely worthless I guess. I think if we do a scene, that’s what it’s called right?”
When lips press against his again Harry turns his head a little to the side. “No, I want –.”
Matt lets go of Harry and pulls a gun out of his jeans, pointing it at Harry’s head.
Malfoy only responds in Harry’s head and horrifyingly he finds himself speaking again, just to fill the silence. “Yeah, so Ron just tried to tell me I’m gay ¬– like I didn’t know that. I mean, after he saw me snogging his brother I thought it was obvious to him that I bloody well knew my own sexual orientation, but apparently he thinks I’m an oblivious idiot and just – Merlin Malfoy will you say something so I can stop talking?”
“Thank Merlin for that,” Hermione said and sat down too. “Though I’m guessing now you don’t know where to go?”
Harry unpacks his belongings into the small wardrobe in his room and lies down on the bed to breathe for a while. It’s odd, being back. In one way it feels like home. Hogwarts always has, but there was so much death here. Not to mention the fact that starting tomorrow he’ll be sitting down in classrooms taking Charms, Transfigurations, Potions and Defence Against the Dark Arts for the first time since he was sixteen. He doesn’t know how he’ll do it. His coping, as Hermione calls it, is all based on running into danger and directing his anger at criminals in order to catch them. He has no idea how he’s going to survive months of just sitting.
“You mean you’re gay, right?” That has to be what she’s saying.
. Because years of pent-up aggression and denied lust is all culminating in this moment; with hands and mouths and bodies that can’t ever get enough.
“This one has traces of Veritaserum in it,” Draco says. “You did work last night.”
The thought is whispered just as Malfoy closes the distance with a final step. Harry’s brain is flooded with the sensation of Malfoy’s chest pressed against his own; Malfoy’s breath hot against his face and the pure
“Pretty much, yeah,” Harry admitted. “I Apparated all over England last night, but I couldn’t find anywhere I didn’t feel like shit.”
A ball of nervousness flitters alive in Harry’s stomach and he smiles with it because somehow it just strengthens his arousal. He steps closer to the middle of the stage and lifts his shirt over his head at the same time. He holds it in his hand for a couple of breaths, wondering what to do with it before he decides to toss it into the darkness beyond the stage.
Harry lets their laughter warm him from the inside out. He doesn’t have to hide, not with these people. He can just be himself, even though he’s still figuring out who that is.
“Hi, Harry! Fun party last night! You having another one tomorrow?”
Harry runs his hands down Draco’s warm belly, circles his thumb around his belly button and runs them back up to his chest, grinning at the small hairs he finds there. He’s relieved to see his curse in the bathroom never scarred, but the thought is fleeting as he runs his hand over one of Malfoy’s nipples and he gasps.
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry I’ve – I didn’t want to break it because I liked hearing your thoughts about me. You’re so quiet all the time, but in your head you – you tell me I’m good and brave and hot. You tell me you want me to stay, that you want me to be yours.”
“May they live long and prosper,” Draco adds. He clicks his glass against Harry’s and when their eyes lock Harry’s relieved to see he isn’t the only one who’s holding back a bit of sadness at the news. But it’s just fear of abandonment or something. He’s not going to lose Ginny just because she’s getting married, is he?
Harry opened his eyes to look at Draco when the man didn’t respond, and what he found in his eyes made pleasure spike in him. Draco looked at Harry’s mouth with heat burning in his eyes. Harry’s gaze fell to his cock and it was just as hard and dripping as Harry’s own.
Harry lets himself be pushed forward, spreading his legs a little and wrapping his fingers against the cool metal. The bar is floating in thin air, but it doesn’t budge when he leans his weight against it.
Harry takes a deep breath and fixes his eyes to a water stain on his table. “I told you my Glamour knows the drug-dealer. That’s true. His name is Matt, and I’ve been hooking up with him on-and-off for the last few months. I was going to go out last night anyways, because I needed —  I hadn’t seen him since we got the case and I needed to. And then we saw Matt in the Pensive, and I figured I could just — do what I always do, and just ask him a couple of questions along the way.”
Harry blushes and bites his lip. He suddenly understands the urge to project his thoughts like Draco had, rather than speaking them out loud. This is good for them though. If they’re going to make this work they’re going to have to
"Hi Guys, want to make it a triad?" the pink-haired girl asked, making Harry stiffen. He didn't mind triads, but he wanted Malfoy to himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry groans and falls back in his chair, appetite suddenly gone. If he fails his Potions NEWT he’s going to lose his job. And he’s going to fail Potions because the only time he ever successfully brewed a potion was when following the instructions in Snape’s old book.
Harry had felt broken and alone, and he hadn’t been able to stop the creeping realisation that maybe he wasn’t worth loving. Or that if he was, the people who were interested in
Harry suddenly feels cold. That’s a possibility? You can just... be unable to fall in love? To never want a romantic relationship?
"Malfoy. Want to pair up?"
“That was weak,” Draco laughs.
Draco shifts a little on the bed. “Pans hasn’t told you?”
"I don't know. I hoped – I really hoped I would feel it eventually."
“I’ll find a movie,” Draco says. “Get me butter chicken and a mountain of -,”
Harry let Ron’s words sink in. He was right, of course. Harry had made speeches about that, because he believed it. Believed that the people who were irredeemable had been locked away and that everyone else deserved a chance at redemption.
He throws the cloak over himself again and picks up the Pensieve.
“But not that you’d survive to see it?” Draco asks, and he sounds even more upset than he’d done when the credits started rolling.
“Right?” Matt says, fingers painfully tight around Harry’s wrist now. “He’s already a slut, so if we get him on drugs I’m sure he’d do whatever anyone asked.”
Harry rolls his eyes. “I’m not really worried about the classes.”
He sounds sincere, like he’s genuinely worried over Harry and feeling his pain, and it warms Harry. He might have lost a boyfriend today, but at least he now knows he has a friend in Draco, even if their friendship is a strange one.
Harry arrives at the club completely sober for the first time ever, his Glamour firmly in place and Draco’s breath on his neck. The bouncer gives him a kind smile when he enters, and Harry feels Draco slip through the door next to him, invisible under Harry’s cloak.
“It’s alright, Harry,” Draco breathed, running a hand up Harry’s back to play with the hair in the nape of his neck. “You can come.”
“I can’t believe I’ve spent years working here, watching his case-file being handed over from incompetent Auror to more incompetent Auror,” Draco frowns, “though I suppose they didn’t trust me not to murder him once I found him.”
“It’s hardly my fault you never bothered to learn how to speak, is it?” Draco laughs. “Jokes aside though, we don’t have to go over everything right away. But we do need the basics.”
“Try saying that again?” Harry laughs, suddenly feeling a whole lot better about having to re-make his chocolate frosting.
Harry spares half a thought to feeling grateful. Matt probably wouldn’t have bothered making him come if not. Nothing about this is about Harry’s pleasure, after all. It’s about Matt’s pleasure and Harry’s release. He stays on the floor, absently noticing the come and lube leaking from his arse as he listens to Matt getting dressed.
It’s an interesting way to get to know someone though, he thinks, watching as Pansy brings Draco into the bedroom, obviously planning to bring him into bed with Harry and Ginny. An indirect friendship isn’t something you experience every day. Draco’s cheeks are pink with cold, and Harry thinks he must have walked a while before coming.
Harry listens as Draco’s belt buckle clinks, and anticipation builds when he hears the belt being pulled from it’s hoops. Draco runs his hands over Harry’s back, and Harry feels the cool metal of the belt in his hands as they move past his waist and down to his arse.
“Well, we know they were further apart than 20 yards. And during the war the Dar– Voldemort had him brew a Potion. A terrible, awful Potion that I don’t like to think about, but it required virgin blood as one of the ingredients. Snape used his own.”
he’s doing this? His erection didn’t need long to recover from almost murdering a classmate, and it’s a strong argument that he’s not doing this just to break a stupid bonding spell. He’s actually become quite fond of hearing Malfoy’s whisper in his ear, now that he thinks about it. There are only a few minutes left of class now, and Harry hears it with increasing frequency. His own name, spoken softly and with an intensity that leaves him breathless.
The spell Harry stupidly cast on himself was probably Latin too. Maybe Harry can get Malfoy to explain it to Harry without Harry telling him what he’s done?
Harry stares at her for a few moments before he connects the dots. “Parkinson?”
Harry spent a few hours unpacking the furniture he found boxed up in a heap on the living room floor. He found a shrunken mattress that he levitated to the loft, a small kitchen table with four chairs, a desk and a shrunken sofa that he placed along the wall. The next box however contained so many bookshelves Harry had to move the other furniture away from the walls to fit them all. He arranged and rearranged until his back ached from dragging the sofa around, and when he finally straightened up and saw his work, he was happy with how it looked. At the sight, a sense of accomplishment rushed through him for the first time in ages.
“It was intoxicating, hearing you. I fucking loved it. And it was wrong, I shouldn’t have invaded your privacy like that. Merlin, I didn’t even realise how bad it was ¬– I just, Draco, please. I’m so sorry.”
Harry laughed a little, not at Draco, but at how similar he sounded to Harry this time last year.
Draco looks at him as if he knows Harry isn’t done speaking and Harry takes a deep breath and forces himself to finish.
Harry’s mouth fell open in a soft gasp as Draco’s fingers tightened a little in his hair. “I like that. Your hand in my hair, I mean. It feels good when you pull it. And I like kneeling for you like this. I like that you’re in control.”
There was no nudity at the parties, not in the main room anyway, but Harry had come so hard in his pants from the paddle on his arse that it was embarrassing. When he lifted his glossy eyes to survey the room and met the cold grey of Malfoy’s he'd shivered. Malfoy had looked wild with desire, and Harry had found himself unable to push away the fleeting thought that he wanted to take the man home.
“There’s this new dating site,” Ron said, “For the Pocket Computers we sell at the shop. Or the Po-cuters as George insists on calling them. Pictures and names aren’t allowed so you can get to know someone before seeing them.”
“Thank you,” he whispers, and lets Draco take him to bed.
“What?” Malfoy asks, breathless. He’s close, Harry thinks.
"You always knew this would happen," Draco sighs, and Harry knows he's right. Draco had never made any promises, and the cautionary tale Sirius told had been ringing in Harry’s ears since he first ran into Draco after the war. After spending the past seven years together though, Harry had let himself hope. A desperate delusion that he and Draco would be together forever. That Draco would love him enough to call off the engagement to Astoria that had been made when they were children, and stay with Harry instead.
The admission that Ginny and Pansy have missed them strikes a cord in Harry. He’d let himself think that Ginny had ‘traded up’ to Pansy, and that he was the only one who missed the closeness they’d had when they shared a flat. He hadn’t even considered that just because she wanted to live with Pansy, it didn’t mean that she didn’t miss Harry just like he missed her.
Ginny’s hands close around Harry’s shaking ones. “I’m not saying you’re definitely gay Harry, just that at least for me, figuring out I’m bi finally lifted that fog in my brain that was always saying I didn’t belong. I guess I’m just saying it might be something worth exploring.”
The club looks like it always does, though the corners look somehow darker without the strong buzz of alcohol to soothe everything over. Harry makes his way to the bar and worries for a second that Matt won’t be there tonight. He doesn’t have to worry long before he spots him on the other side of the bar. Harry orders himself a couple of shots and waits for Matt to come to him. That’s the way it goes: Matt decides and Harry listens.
Harry takes the book from Malfoy and scans the words himself. Everything from the golden band around his wrist to the way the first bloody name he said after casting it was Malfoy’s fits. The words that make him feel cold all over are the final sentences. ‘
“Merlin, not Snape?”
He doesn't have a  destination in mind, just a desperate need to get away from himself. He hears footsteps behind him and assumes it’s Draco, but he can’t slow down now. If he stops all his thoughts and feelings will catch up to him and he can’t let them. He should just feel happy, but he’s a selfish prick and he can’t manage it.
“We think so. She was just fostered by a really nice couple, but they brought her back because she would get so upset whenever she was left alone for more than three or four hours at a time, and the couple both worked eight hours a day so they couldn’t keep her.”
Harry leaned forward to lick at the base of Draco’s cock, buying his nose in his pubes and inhaling the scent that was so purely masculine and Draco that his own cock twitched impatiently in his pants. Draco moaned appreciatively and it spurred Harry on further. He ran his tongue down the length of Draco’s cock, and allowed the tip to slip into his mouth. Running his tongue around the head, Harry groaned at the salty bitter taste of Draco’s precome.
“Draco,” Harry says. “Please. You have to believe me.”
“Well it sounds ridiculous when you say it like that,” Harry laughs. “But yeah, I found myself and it’s what I’ve been looking for this whole time. And what I found is that I want to share my life with someone – just not in the traditional sense. I want to surround myself with love, friendships and nieces and nephews and family. And you.”
Harry’s heart hammered in his chest as he shut down his Po-cuter. He knew who M was. He’d been there, in the flying lesson when Neville broke his arm. He’d seen Madam Hooch go around correcting students. He’d rejoiced with Ron when she told Malfoy he’d been doing it wrong. Malfoy. Draco Malfoy was M.
Draco nods, tea halfway between his lips and the table.
“A date though, really? You haven’t been on a date since me!”
"Yeah," Harry breathed, pulse racing.
“Don’t you dare,” Harry says, clenching the muscles in his arse. “I want to feel it when you come.”
Draco walks forward too, but unlike Ron he doesn’t let the barrier stop him. He runs a gentle hand down Harry’s arm and leans in for a kiss. It reminds Harry of that first kiss, chaste and soft. He sighs with relief that Draco believes him and tries to deepen the kiss.
He apparates home with the bracelet Daniel had given him on his wrist. It’s a leather string with a silver D hanging on it, and Harry feels trapped wearing it. He needs Ginny, desperately.
“No, I think it’s high time I gave their cabin back, actually.”
“Yes, Weasly did mention that,” Draco says. “I laid out some toys and whatnot in the room, you can pick out the ones you’re comfortable with me using.”
“And you do your sex-homework. I’ll come by again tomorrow, alright?” Draco smiles, and Harry gets the sneaking suspicion that he likes to embarrass Harry a little.
“Pansy is my person,” Draco says. “I’m not sure how I’ll survive losing her like that, bit by bit until it’s just monthly lunches. Did you ever get over it? Losing them like that?”
“We’ll be in Rome, I hardly think entertaining ourselves is going to be a problem,” Harry says. “Are you sure you want us crashing your honeymoon though?”
