“Oh I’m so sorry Potter,” Malfoy sneered. “Did I interrupt your next heroic mission? Fat chance you’d do any good. Now what did you say to Pansy?” The tip of his wand edged closer, almost touching Harry’s chin.
“What the fuck Pansy!” She looked almost pleased but still fumed with rage.
“See that it doesn’t.” With a final glare at the side of Potter’s head, Draco returned to his notes and the last moments of the class passed without issue. As McGonagall said her final remarks and dismissed the students, Draco kept his eyes on the back of Pansy’s head. She was very quick to pack up her things, and the boy had to messily shove things in his bag to follow her out of the room.
“Well? Who is it?”
The grass must’ve muffled his steps as Pansy tensed and raised her wand at his sudden voice. Her eyes looked panicked for a moment, before settling into her usual look of disdain.
Harry and Pansy make plans, Draco doesn't, and things start to fall apart as the Yule Ball draws closer and closer.
With his mouth agape at the streaks on the slytherin’s face, Harry stumbled out a “Um no, sorry. I wasn’t looking where I was headed.”
“Yes, Harry why would Cho ever be interested in Cedrics perfectly ruffled hair, natural charm, and ability to hold an actual conversation with the opposite sex?”
“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you, so I’m not going to bother.”
“Hermione, you do remember this is a girl that has joined Malfoy in calling you a mudblood right?” His voice was incredulous but Hermione nodded solemnly.
“And by the end of the week I expect you all to have perfected your proposals for the end of term of project. While I am aware the Yule Ball is this weekend, I maintain my high standards for your work. Do not disappoint me.” With that, Professor Snape waved towards the door, dismissing class. Draco began to gather his books and was on his way out of the room when a gentle hand landed on his shoulder. “A word, Draco?” Snape asked. Draco nodded and stepped out of the way of the other students. He was racking his brain in the silence, trying to think of what he’d done to warrant a word with the head of slytherin house. When nothing came to mind, he began to pick at the corner of his potions books.
“Why wouldn’t we believe you?” Harry asked.
“You’re one to talk Malfoy. You have enough gel in your hair to clog every drain in the school.” Zabini chuckled at that but fell silent with a look from the other slytherins. “Anyway it’s not as if you have a date either. Parkinson’s not around to be your picture perfect backup I’m afraid,” Harry shot back at the blonde.
“What do you mean what Potter said?”
“Why does it matter anyway?” Ron said. “It’s not like that’ll effect us at all. Unless it magically gets us dates for the ball, I don’t care.” Harry let out an involuntary chuckle even as Hermione glared at the pair.
“Your empty threats are truly petrifying, I’m shaking in my boots,” Harry mocked. With a final glare, Malfoy stalked back towards the great hall, an air of nonchalance surrounding him. As aggravating as they could be, Harry had to admire slytherin’s talent for facades. He struggled to his feet and clumsily gathered his books with one last look towards the great hall. Silver eyes met green, and Harry had a bad feeling about the coming weeks.
“Shut it, Potter. Save your lies for someone more gullible.” Lies?
“I heard Malfoy made a bet with Zabini over how long it would take for her to give it up to someone and Parkinson found out this morning. Zabini apparently apologized but Malfoy wouldn’t. Said he the made the bet for a reason.” Ginny added.
“Malfoy, what do you me-”
“Hermione,” Ron began. “Are you going with someone?” She barely glanced up.
“You’re not still mad about that bet, are you? It was a joke Pansy! Just a way to make a few galleons off of knowing you better than Blaise!” Pansy’s eyes blazed.
“Hey Hermione,” Ron mumbled, flopping down on the unoccupied end of the couch.
“We ended up studying in the same section of the library. Actually that wasn’t the weirdest part of my day though,” she said as she closed her book. “I found Pansy Parkinson crying behind the restricted section!” Ron let out a barking laugh.
“I’m afraid that’s not an option anymore Malfoy.” Malfoy? She never called him that, she knew how much he hated it. “I’ve already been asked by someone, and I said yes.” Shock tinged with betrayal coursed through Draco’s body.
“He’s on about the Yule Ball, making fun of Ron’s robes before he’s even wore them,” Harry explained.
“I’m sure it’s not that mate. You know how girls are about asking boys to dances, they expect us to do all the work. We just have to find some that are available and ask.” Ron somehow looked more glum but perked up suddenly and turned towards Hermione, nose deep in a transfiguration book.
“Good news Potter, you’re already a laughingstock, especially with that horrid haircut.” Malfoy’s posh accent cut through the rumble of the crowd around them as he walked past, flanked by Zabini, Crabbe, and Goyle.
“Are you...all right Parkinson?” he asked cautiously. The glare he got in return could have cut through a Gringotts vault.
“Mr. Malfoy.” McGonagall’s voice rang sharply through the room and Draco sighed to himself before pasting on a look of innocence.
“What? Who! Pansy, we agreed we’d go together as soon as the tournament was announced!”
Deciding to head back and look for Pansy, Draco looked up to find that very same girl walking glumly towards the lake. Her head drooped uncharacteristically, and Draco’s heart gave a little pang. He was going to hex Potter into oblivion, his friend had never looked so vulnerable, it wasn’t becoming of members of high wizarding society. He took a deep breath, settled his wand back within his robes, and went to approach his friend.
“Another time Ron,” Harry mumbled. They made their way through the portrait of the fat lady and into the cozy common room. Hermione had already grabbed their usual spot by the fire; anyone brave enough to try and steal a chair would’ve had to move the mountains of books she brought with her.
“Betting on your mate's virginity doesn’t seem like a very funny joke.” Malfoy’s wand grew firm under Harry’s chin as he leaned closer. His breath smelled of spiced apples and Harry almost wanted to lean closer.
“Hey, I can talk to girls perfectly well. I do it with you all the time!” She rolled her eyes at this in an almost perfect imitation of Ron's earlier expression.
“Apparently, her and Malfoy still haven’t made up from that spat they had last week. Zabini’s been nice enough but she’s been sitting alone at meals, and her mom’s going through another divorce. I think Pansy really liked the guy this time, so she’s taking it really hard.” Harry let the new information process for a moment as Ron shared his increasing exasperation.
“I just wanted to talk to you. I saw you crying at dinner over whatever Potter did.” A look of confusion crossed Pansy’s face. “He’ll pay for whatever he said to you, you have my word. I just want to know if I should punch him or full on hex him.” The girl stopped abruptly, causing Draco to backpedal slightly. Her eyebrows drew together, lips pulled tight to her teeth as she spoke.
“That’s not actually an apology,” she bit out.
Draco scoffed. “Of course you rely on her. You’d be a lost cause without it.”
“Yes.” The boys shared slightly shocked looks before Harry spoke.
“It’s silly teenage squabbles, sir. I’ll make sure to get you my project idea by Friday.” Determined to not be any later for his class, Draco moved for the door and this time Snape let him go. The halls were nearly empty which was a blessing. Any witnesses to Draco’s half run towards McGonagall’s room would’ve been quickly silenced. Of course, where the universe gives it also takes which meant the only seats left upon his arrival were those next to Pansy or Potter. His tardiness drew the eyes of the whole class as Pansy spread her books out that much farther to fill the desk she sat at.
“Hey Pans,” Draco began. “It’s just me, no need to shoot a spell in my direction.” Pansy rolled her eyes with a grimace.
Truly, he didn’t understand why Pansy was taking this so hard. To be pushed to tears over a joke was unlike her and it made Draco worry about her emotional state. He shook his head, deciding to leave her be until the morning. Maybe she just needed rest to see how preposterous she was reacting. There was, however, the unfortunate revelation that Potter had gotten a punch in over nothing and that quickly replaced his annoyance with embers of hatred. Straightening his robes, Draco began the walk back to the castle, certain that this would all blow over soon.
Draco's resulting sobs wake baby Alannah, everyone fights to be the one to rock her back to sleep.
"Draco?" Harry scrambles to his feet, hiccuping slightly from the crying fit.
The room exploded into cheers, but Harry didn't notice, because he was far too busy kissing his future husband.
"I want to stay with Uncle Harry," Teddy was going to throw a tantrum soon.
"Yes, he's incorrigible. Save me, Ginevra!" Draco fake swoons into Ginny's shoulder.
"I don't accept your apology, purely because you don't know the extent of it," Luna's voice was even, "We can revisit an apology at a later time."
Harry nudged Draco again.
. Harry hasn't been able to stomach the pasta dish since.

"You were cruel. Nasty. Made Draco and Lucius circa 1995 look like good people," Ron finished.
Harry leaned against the backrest of the bench which Ginny and Neville were slouching on. He took a sip of his lemonade and smiled, Teddy was cuddled in Pansy's arms while she and George talked to Hermione and Ron, Teddy's hair changing colour depending on who was speaking. Harry looked around for Draco and spotted him talking to Andy and the Grangers. Harry wandered over to the group, taking Draco's hand. Casting his eyes around again, Harry spotted Molly and Arthur kissing through the kitchen window and blushed at the sight. Kingsley and Narcissa were sitting at the long table with Fleur, Bill, Charlie and Percy. Bill's hand stroked the side of Fleur's stomach, Harry knew they had started trying for children and were hoping to be blessed soon. Matias and Luna were conjuring lights for after the sunset, discussing Heliopaths as they went.
"Of course, it is important for your mental health to try to rectify errors of your past. You must understand though, others are not beholden to accept your amends, they can choose to refuse. This is important for
It was another two group counselling sessions before Harry spoke of his new aversion to meat.
Harry sat down on the stool beside the stove with his head in his hands and sighed heavily, "He's happy with her."
"I - sorry - I didn't really think that through," Harry stammers.
"I'm good, Gramma. I just want to hug Uncle Harry. I missed him," Teddy sulked and tucked his head against Harry's chest.
Harry stares at the familiar wooden door which is now closed and turns on the spot, aiming for The Burrow. Harry has barely stopped spinning on the back path when Ginny explodes from the back door, eyes blazing and wand at his throat.
"Well, yes," Molly leaned over to grab the carrots Ron had been grating, "She passed away two nights ago. The Healers were unable to reverse the curse damage."
"Potter!" Draco spat the word and charged up to Harry, grabbing his jumper in his fist and shaking Harry in his anger. "You can't just tell me you love me the second you realise that you might lose me to someone else!"
"I sleep all the time, I think I got fifteen hours last night. I just don't feel rested," Harry replied.
"Sometimes," Draco whispered back, "But my Mind Healer says that the war was not my fault and I should only feel guilty if I don't learn from the mistakes I made."
"Potter, over my dead body are you still going to be my partner when we're Senior Aurors," Draco's drawl was comforting in Harry's ear.
"Harry, Draco won't leave you. I need you to fight harder for your life," the healer urged.

"I - I just saw my mum's knickers." Charlie was still staring at a spot on the floor.
Celia was thirteen years younger than Draco and was a trainer for the Wimbourne Wasps. Celia was pleasant enough to Harry but had already started to hint to Draco that perhaps it might be time for a new living arrangement. Albus, Scorpius and Lily had arrived home from Hogwarts just a few days prior and were all refusing to speak to Celia after overhearing one of these loaded suggestions. James had met Celia a few times and dismissed her based on the Quidditch team she worked for and Minty copied everything James did.
"Y-you want me to be part of your family?" Harry's voice was quiet and hesitant beside Draco. He turned to look at the black haired boy and thought he'd never looked so unsure. "Well, Harry you don't have to, of course, but you are Teddy's godfather and the Lord Black. It makes you one of us," Harry stared at Andromeda like she was going to take it back. He stood, hesitating, before racing around the table and throwing his arms around her, "Thank you." Draco had barely heard the quiet words but he heard the sadness behind them, and realised Harry hadn't felt like he had a family before now. He felt the beginnings of anger in his chest, who the hell did Harry live with before this, to make him feel like he'd not had a family?!
Draco looked around the room, Andy was pushing a stroller back and forth, assumedly containing a sleeping Teddy, Molly and Arthur Weasley were sitting in two chairs next to George, whispering to Bill and Fleur and shooting Draco grateful smiles. Kingsley was the person his mother must have been whispering to, they were sharing a chair. Draco's mouth fell open with shock. His mother and Kingsley Shacklebolt were
"Are you sure this is a good idea, Harry?" Hermione actually looked nervous for him.
Harry stiffened and then started to speak confidently, "Kreacher, I order you to take Regulus' room, as your Master." Kreacher immediately stopped crying and nodded sniffling, "Of course Master Harry, Kreacher will honour his Master's request." Draco squeezed his hand on Harry's shoulder,
Draco sighs and leans heavily into Harry, "We've known each other for fifty years now. Happy birthday, you old coot."

"Good idea, there's a huge amount of ambient magic in the soil now," Bill tapped his wand to his chin, "It's not malicious but it will certainly do better with somewhere to channel itself."
behind him.
"Draco, what the hell is happening? I remember being hit with some red light yesterday and I wake up this morning and there's some man in my bed - I am so sorry, I have no idea but I think I cheated on you. I went to Hermione and Ron's but apparently the witch there had been there for years but we were there on Sunday for brunch. Ginny hates me and I'm not an Auror and you finished your Healer training?" Harry had started to tear up again.
"Potter," Draco leaned over him, face crumpled with concern.
Harry felt Ron's calloused hand surrounding his, squeezing his fingers. "I love you and 'Mione, Ron. I'll always be here."
Draco smiled and pulled Harry back into his chest, Harry swung his legs up onto the bed and curled into his side. "I'm sorry I've been so angry since you got back from Australia with 'Mione. I think I felt left out, er, from you and 'Mione becoming such good friends." Draco frowned, he hadn't considered that it was his friendship with Hermione that Harry had been upset about. Draco pulled Harry tight, squeezing him and slipping his hand onto the bare skin at Harry's hip where his jumper rode up.
Ginny had died before reaching St. Mungo's, the curse was swift and destructive. Harry would regain sight in his left eye eventually, his left arm had mostly been regrown and he had been in a magically induced coma for five weeks. The Potter kids were subdued, Draco had taken them to his new home in the Cotswolds. Scorpius had Lily clutching one hand and Albus holding the other. James waited until Hermione had finished, scooped up Minty and left the room, followed by a concerned looking Rose. Hugo had brought a book and was studiously ignoring the emotional atmosphere.
"Mallow-sweet is being used in Butterbeer," Winky sniffled, "Dobby is being telling Winky that children like Butterbeer."
Harry had finished off an enormous pile of bacon and eggs and was about to pull a roll onto his plate when Draco stopped him and put a small ramekin in front of him instead. Harry cracked the sugary top and scooped the custard into his mouth and groaned in pleasure.
Harry stood for a moment, unsure how he wanted to respond, but melted when he saw the cautious look of hope on Draco's face. "Parkinson, Pansy, look er, we were all shit scared, right? Lets just, start fresh?" He held out his hand to Pansy, who immediately grasped it firmly. "Thank you, Potter. Dray, we're going to head upstairs and help with the First Years, but we'll see you soon?" Draco nodded and promised to write. Blaise clapped Draco on the back and nodded at the two boys before leading Pansy to the Entrance Hall.
"Maybe in a few weeks, Teddy. Not right now," Andromeda's voice was carefully held together, but the crinkling of her nose told Draco she too was holding back tears.
"I cannot believe you're sleeping on such filthy sheets, I'll change them," she flicked her wand again, changing the bedding without him moving.
"Harry, I know it feels like there is no way forward, but you're strong enough to recover from this," Healer Gurjeet gave him one of her 'you can do this' looks.
Hermione put a hand on his arm, "Harry... Don't you think it's time to tell him?" He looked at her knowing brown eyes in fear,
"Are you alright? I think you ought to rest, don't you? You've been here long enough," Healer Gurjeet pressed the back of her hand to Draco's forehead on her way out the door.
"That's amazing, Ron. Of course I will," Harry grinned, feeling a little hopeful for the first time since the accident.
Draco breathed out heavily into Harry's hair, "Look Potter," Harry stilled, he was Potter when Draco was mad at him or trying to make a strong point, "Everything that has ever happened has culminated in you defeating old Snake Face. It had to happen exactly as it did for us to get to the point where you would willingly cuddle up with me and live with my mum and aunt." Harry smiled against Draco's throat, "I still can't believe your family lives with me." Harry had explained before - badly - to Draco how he'd just known that they were
Harry nods, not liking the track of conversation, "What brings you here?"
"Every morning is better with you, love," Harry laughs into Draco's hair and presses kisses down his cheek.
"And?" Draco won't look at Harry.
Draco.
There were gasps at this information - Narcissa and Draco's trials had been closed to the public, due to the information about Horcruxes being sensitive - and few knew about Harry's attempt on Draco's life.
Draco could hardly believe it when the weather started to turn, summer faded into autumn all too quickly. The last few months were both the happiest and saddest he had ever known. There was so much grieving to be done, wounds to heal, apologies to make. Draco smiled fondly at George and Ron, arguing at the table in front of him about Safe & Sound, their newest product. Draco looked at the sketch in front of him, the orb coloured in his mind with gentle blue lights. The Safe & Sound was their newest post-War offering, it aimed to provide a bubble of protection for sleeping. The orb would provide a shielded area with calming coloured light and sound that felt uniquely comforting to each user. George and Ron were arguing about the inclusion of a smell component.
Harry was shocked to see Hermione, Ron, Bill, Fleur, George, Teddy, James (holding Minty), Scorpius, Albus, Lily, Rose and Hugo all look up in delight. Harry hissed to Charlie, "How many people
"I've been told that the last five years have been," Harry cast around for the words, "dreadful? Because of me."
The room emptied slowly, with Dean and Seamus stopping to talk to Sergeant Parrish before leaving. Hermione was in Ron's arms, his head atop hers and his hands running a soothing rhythm over her back. Harry shuffled awkwardly before stepping up to Draco and holding out his hand.
"How did you go on?" Harry's words interrupt Draco, midway through a sentence about the shortage of powdered horn of Bicorn.
"The second black one," Harry demands, "Now."
"I do," Draco shuffled his feet, "I think... I think if there'd never been a war, I would have done the expected. Secure the future line, be a proud Pureblood, live a boring life. I'd like to rebuild the family, but differently. I want my kids - if I ever have any - to be proud of their family because they're good people. They probably won't be mine by blood anyway, so they won't learn about all that garbage."
Arthur placed a hand on Harry's shoulder, causing Harry to jump. Arthur seemed to be saying something but Harry couldn't hear him over the deafening sound of his pulse. "Mr. Weas- Arthur, I can't, I'm sorry..." Harry couldn't put into words his discomfort. He felt that he was intruding and it tore at him like claws through flesh. Arthur pulled him close and pressed his chin to Harry's forehead, "Go, find us when you're ready, son." Harry felt Arthur release him and stumbled away blinded by his hot tears.
"What is the date today?" Draco asked him.
Luna nodded, "Do you find it hard to work up an appetite?"
Harry cast a Tempus, "Er, about 09:30?"
"Ready!"
Hermione's voice was barely audible, "I miss him."
"Shut it, Potter, you're killing the mood," Draco slaps him lightly on the chest.
"Alright," she didn't sound convinced.
Healer Gurjeet leaned in to Harry, "You should be improving by now. I don't understand what is happening."
"Honestly, Dad, you're so bloody obvious." Lily rolled her eyes and shared an amused look with Hugo.
scar.
" Harry yelled in unison with eighty other voices.
"It's er, really bright, huh?" Harry wanted to smack himself. All of the things he could say in this moment and that was what he chose.
Draco cradled Harry like a newborn child while Healer Gurjeet assisted him to sip water, most of it sloshing down his chest.
"Er," Harry looked at Draco's face, which was flushed pink, "Thanks." Harry got comfortable and pulled the covers up over the both of them. He slipped back into sleep without really thinking through the fact that he was in Draco Malfoy's bed.
Hermione was draped over an armchair opposite the fire, reading an Arithmancy textbook - or so it appeared. Draco knew tucked inside the textbook was a historical romance novel, his mother and Andy had gotten both him and Hermione hooked on them over the summer. Andy and his mother were at The Burrow, having a girls night - of all things - with Mrs. Weasley - Molly, he was still getting used to calling her her first name - and Mrs. Granger - Jean.
"And kicking me will bring it to fruition?" Draco's smirk was a bit unsure.
"Well, Minty calls you Daddy and Draco never corrects her..." James looked to Minty, who was snoring loudly in his arms.
"It's your fault the bomb went off here," Harry snapped, "It's your fault Hermione lost an arm and Marcie lost a leg and everyone was injured!"
"Harry, you've been very taciturn since we got back from Australia. I know you thought we hadn't noticed, but we're worried about you." Harry bristled, they were talking about him again. "Harry James Potter, the
"It's gone," Draco sob-laughed, "Fuck, it's like a weight around my neck is gone."
"Mr. Shacklebolt," Narcissa's elegant voice quietly began, "with Lucius dead, Draco is the new Lord Malfoy..." Kingsley immediately responded to Draco, "Yes, ah, don't worry about the impact of Lucius on your inheritance, you will not be punished by your fortune being-" Kingsley broke off at the look on Mrs. Malfoy's face. Narcissa cut in coldly, "I assure you, that was not what I was endeavouring to discuss. We do not wish to return to Malfoy Manor, not ever again." She looked at Draco, who minutely nodded before she continued, "We would like to donate the Manor to the Ministry. Please use it for those displaced by the War. Give them somewhere to call home, even temporarily. Our House-Elves were safely hidden from the Dark Lord. They shall remain with the Manor to help provide care for the occupants."

"I-it was requited Ron. Harry - Harry saw it too," Hermione has lost the ability to form words. Her wail of despair is joined by her husband's bellow.
"Oh, right, yeah," Harry was quiet for the rest of the session.
Harry felt a wave of possessiveness roar in his chest as Draco rested his forehead against Pansy's. Harry stormed up to the Slytherins, before realising Pansy was wringing her hands and weeping. Harry felt relieved that Zabini had a claiming hand on her waist. "H-Harry, I'm so, so sorry. I was so scared, we were going to die and he wanted one person and I just... He was so-" Pansy sniffled and shook her head like she was clearing away a Billywig and resumed, "I apologise for my behaviour. Draco has told us how you've protected him and I never thought you could do that for someone like us."
Hermione stood up and made her way to Draco's bedside, he turned to face her, slipping his spare hand into hers. "Draco, thank you, you saved my life." Draco gave her a small smile, "I had to do something. Who was going to compete with me for the most N.E.W.T.s if something had happened to you, 'Mione?" Harry, Ron and Pansy all objected halfheartedly to the implication that they weren't an academic threat. Hermione felt her heart melt. She knew Draco using her nickname was his way of telling her that she was important to him.
"It's difficult, facing these demons," Sergeant Parrish announced at the end of their session, "There's a lot of anger and hurt here, but you all share it. You're all so young, you've got too much life left to let this win. See you next week, same time."
Dumbledore was a sore point for Harry. He'd been seeing a Mind Healer as well as attending the group sessions with Sergeant Parrish. Healer Timkins had cautiously floated the suggestion that Dumbledore had done the wrong thing and Harry had exploded. She was right, of course, the anger and hurt that Harry had been accumulating over the years had been brought to the surface in one moment. He'd been wrung out - emotionally and physically - for the week since.
to protect. Draco gripped Harry's hip again,
"Isn't she perfect," Draco whispers to Harry.
The howler exploded into pieces, sprinkling over Harry's half eaten dinner and leaving a deafening silence in the room.
"I love you most," Harry laughs and kisses him back.
"Ron..." Hermione's voice is broken behind him.
Draco closed the paper and looked pensive for a moment. "Honestly, I wouldn't have gotten through it without everyone. Two days after Tori died, Ginevra turned up at my house with three bottles of wine and a picture of you dressed as a woman."
"I don't know, Harry. I know for you this is new, shocking information. For the people you've hurt it's been five years of constant cruelty on your behalf," Luna replied.
"So, the curse took all memories of your life, for exactly five years. Upon waking this morning, an assumed time release on the curse expired and you regained your memories of the day you were cursed and everything proceeding. Nothing since then?" Draco's voice was clinical.
"Yes, although I've heard a little bit of what I'm missing and..." Harry fights another wave of nausea.
"She was a wolf he turned, she could turn like he could, without the moon," Draco shivered, thinking of the monster. "Father gave the Aurors what they needed to track down the remaining Death Eaters, but he forgot about Anja. She wasn't Marked, she was just vicious."
Ron complained loudly and smacked George for putting him in a headlock. Ron didn't seem to mind Draco at all after he came back, knowing he'd kept Hermione from being hassled by playing "boyfriend" and Draco had become Ron's favourite chess opponent. Draco knew his commitment to George and Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes had gone a long way to building that relationship. Draco turned his attention fully back to George and Ron, interjecting a point about the potion the orb could hold to provide the smell.
Feeling someone against his side, Harry dismissed the notion and tried to identify the body beside him. Flaming hair told him it was a Weasley, but it took several moments before Harry could recognise that it was Charlie, pulling Harry to his feet and over to his family. Except they didn't feel like his family anymore, Harry didn't deserve to share in their grief. In the midst of his haze, Harry wondered if Ginny would want to resume their relationship. He felt a brief moment of
Hermione laughed, Luna was dancing around The Burrow with baby Teddy, who was wearing the shocking yellow and pink paisley onesie that Luna had brought him for Christmas. Molly wanted to save Christmas Day for just the family, but Christmas Eve the Weasleys had decided to cram everyone they knew into the house for a party. Kingsley was booming with laughter beside Narcissa at something Arthur had said. George was talking to Pansy and Blaise in the kitchen while lobbing cocktail onions at Percy. Charlie and Matias had brought home a tiny, ancient Chinese witch for the day, she was showing Molly a charm which folded napkins into dragons and kelpies.
"Harry, Draco won't leave you. I need you to fight harder for your life," the healer began, "I didn't want to try this, but I have no choice."
Draco was slowly getting used to his new family being together in the Hogwarts setting. Nothing had really changed in their relationships. He was Hermione's study partner and academic rival, Ron's chess partner, Ginny's confidant and footstool (filling in for George) and Harry's... friend? Draco was trying to be patient but Harry still barely interacted with him. Draco was sure now that Harry had a problem with his orientation, because he grumbled frequently about Dean and Seamus sharing a bed and kissing in front of him.
"Doesn't matter, what matters is you've finally realised if you don't tell him you're going to lose him." Hermione crossed her arms and put her best 'Minister of Magic' face on.
"If it helps, Ron put you in a week-long coma for it," Hermione offers.
Luna said decidedly while pulling a strand of Draco's hair, "Draco, you've got a Wrackspurt or two I think." Draco smiled at her fondly, "Thanks Luna, I might do." Draco's head turned at the sound of the door opening. Harry stepped up to his bed carefully, looking between Pansy and George like they might attack him. "Er, I wonder if I can talk to Draco for a moment?" Harry was going to tear the hem of his jumper if he kept twisting it like that, Draco mused on the nervous movement.
. Free of that horrifying caricature of a human being, free of his slavery, free of him turning their family home into a slaughterhouse. He knew there would be more pain to come - a trial, public outrage, sentences - but even Azkaban was a safe haven compared to what his home had become in the last two years. He felt acutely out of place here, crouching where the Hufflepuff table usually sat. Draco breathed in the heavy air of dust and ash, the acrid smell of blood filling his nostrils.
Draco suddenly pressed his palm at the nape of Harry's neck,
Harry rolled onto his side, facing Draco, "I dreamt you died."
"Greyback had a girlfriend," Draco gripped Harry's hand firmly, "Did you know?"
are going to discuss things that worry us together!" He sighed, "Sorry, 'Mione, I just... I don't like being talked about."
"Wh-she did that?" Harry knew there'd been a photo floating around from his bucks weekend, he just didn't know Ginny had been the one to possess it.
"Maybe in a few weeks, Teddy. Not right now," Andromeda sounded disappointed. Harry wanted to object that he was fine, but he was still having troubles eating or keeping the house clean.
Hermione giggled as Harry turned to look at the room with horror, "You lot were betting on us and when we'd get together?" Fleur spoke up, "Well, 'Arry, not all of us are tactless imbéciles 'oo bet on true love. Some of us are just unfortunate enough to be married to zem." She gave Bill a sharp look, Bill laughed and pulled her into a kiss. Draco commented slyly, "You know, Fleur, I'm hurt that all the times you tried to talk me into confessing my love to Harry were trying to help Bill win a bet." Fleur looked horrified and protested, Hermione saw Draco's amused smirk and knew he wasn't serious. "Chérie je te crois." Fleur relaxed at whatever Draco had said, offering him an affectionate smile. "Draco, I am 'appy your cœur belongs to such a worthy man." Ron protested, "Alright, that's enough French. You could be giving us the meaning of life right now and we'd have no clue what you're on about."
Hermione left with the children, James couldn't be separated from Minty and Draco passed over the one year old's nappy bag to Hermione to take with her. Draco remained, sitting beside Harry and reading him the finance pages from the Evening Prophet.
"I should have been, Merlin I should be in Azkaban!" Harry cried.
"I'm fine, I slept okay last night," Harry opined. His body was sore though, like it was after too much overtime.
It was another week later that Harry had found himself in Draco's bed again, this time after a nightmare where he was watching Draco burn to death in the Room of Requirement. He kept nudging Draco with his leg to make sure the boy was still alive and next to him.
The monster in his chest was quieter now, but still stretching its muscles and preening. "Duck your head again," Draco advised before scrubbing his fingers through Harry's hair. "Good, your hair is clean, time for the rest of you." Harry blushed again. Draco had grabbed a soft cloth from the pile of linen at the end of the tub, dipping it in the water and choosing another tap he turned back to Harry. Harry tensed as Draco began softly scrubbing him, soothing the ache in his shoulders and washing the blood from his arm. Draco stared at Harry before placing a cautious hand on the crackled starburst scar on his chest. "Is this...?" Draco looked at Harry with trepidation, Harry nodded and placed a hand over Draco's. "Yeah, he got me again the noseless twat." Draco's face immediately perked up and he laughed.
Draco considered the Krups his great grandmother had bred and remembered how noisy they were when hungry, before trying to remember the name of a House-Elf. He remembered the Elf from House Black from his childhood and whispered, "Kreacher?" A loud crack startled the group as the old Elf appeared before them. "How can I help young Master Malfoy?" Draco quickly pulled his old superiority about him like a cloak, "Kreacher, bring us some milk for the baby?" Kreacher looked at the child suspiciously and back to Draco, so he continued, knowing how the Elf would best respond to nobility, "The baby is my cousin - a descendant of the Noble House of Black too." Kreacher seemed pleased and bowed, before Disapparating away for a few moments and loudly reappearing with a bottle.
I should just be grateful we're alive and they're still by my side. After the nights I woke up screaming in the bed next to them... Well, thank Merlin they're better friends than I deserve. I wonder if Madame Pomfrey will give me another lot of Dreamless Sleep. Doubt it, she's so worried I'll get addicted. I don't know how to tell her I have the nightmares anyway, it just stops me from moving and screaming so that other people aren't bothered by it.
Narcissa looked to the closed kitchen door and flicked her wand at the door, warding it, before conjuring a sturdy desk chair for herself and sitting next to Harry. "He is happy with her because he thought you were never an option."
He stepped through the Floo to Healer Gurjeet's office and slumped into the armchair he'd come to resent.
Harry's eyes shut, clutching his hands on the arm of his chair for support, "Hermione, I'm-"
"Because you've been exposed to a traumatic event. I've been in two wars, one magical and one no-maj - Muggle, as you call it," Sergeant Parrish looked at them with knowing eyes.
Draco felt his heart clench for this boy, this man, who had clearly never been loved like he should have been in his life. Draco felt a cold rush of shame, he had tormented Harry with his loveless, parentless existence for years.
people."
Ron held Hermione close to his side and had his other arm wrapped around Harry, "Mate, we'll come over in a day or so, once you're all settled and er..." he looked to Hermione, unsure. Hermione finished for him, "We'll bring the family over and talk it out, okay? If you've chosen to bring the Malfoys into the family, we will support your judgement." Harry nodded and waved goodbye as he headed back to the Malfoys and Andromeda.
Draco signed the waiver he was handed and Marcie removed the supporting charms keeping Harry's heart beating.
"Actually if you'd asked me to imagine Ronald's childhood bedroom, it is exactly as I would imagine." Draco's voice was detached and cool. He wasn't facing Harry.
Harry raced back over to Andromeda and Narcissa, both of them granting him a small smile. Harry felt the monster in his chest puff up, he was Teddy's godfather and Harry wouldn't let him grow up like he had. He was determined he would be a loving and present godfather. He was going to have a good relationship with Andromeda and Narcissa, and Draco too. Harry began wondering where Draco had disappeared to. He suddenly spotted a shock of blonde hair over near the wall, and bristled with irritation. Draco had his godson and was talking quietly to Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini.
Hermione raised her head slightly, "Is he awake?"
"I didn't ask for tea?" Harry took the cup but didn't drink it.
"It took me a week to convince my son to pick himself up off the floor of his flat and stop drinking himself into an early grave," Narcissa could have cut glass with the tenor of her voice.
"Mr. Harry Potter, sir, Winky is bringing you tea to help you sleep again," Winky held up a bright yellow mug filled with steaming liquid.
Harry shook his head, "I need to see. I don't want to be ignorant of my sins."
"Are you two seeking to ruin the tranquility of the village or do you just like the sound of your own voices?" Draco's cheeky drawl drew George's attention. "Drake, mate, please tell your friend here how incredibly incorrect she is. I keep telling her that Fred came to me in a dream and told me to make the shop acid yellow." Draco scowled at George, though it was without any real menace, "Call me Drake again and I'll hex you acid yellow in the name of Fred Weasley's honour." George laughed at Draco's statement and Pansy took the opportunity to flick her wand and change the frontage to a peppy blood-orange.
She stopped short on the back step. The yard was filled with twinkling fireflies, orbs of conjured light strung around the trees, pulsing soft blue to lilac and back again. Ron had his back to her and turned when he heard her approach. Hermione registered the blush on his face and then gasped as he dropped to one knee, taking her hand in his. "'Mione. Hermione. I'm not good with words like you. But you make me feel like I'm the smartest, kindest bloke alive. When I'm with you, everything is better. You've always been the best of the three of us. I know you're going to have a really impressive career, so I'm hoping you'll let me be the one you come home to after a day of changing the world. Marry me?"
"Gin, I swear, I have no idea what I've done to you," Harry pleads.
Hermione and Ron exchanged goodbyes with Kingsley, before starting back to the Weasley family. St. Mungo's workers had started clearing the bodies from the hall, and Narcissa turned to Lucius' body before casting around him, "
. You were a Gryffindor and the defeater of the most evil wizard since Grindelwald. Stop being so bloody cowardly!" Narcissa's tone was both forceful and pleading.

₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪
"Thank you, Luna. For what it is worth, I am truly sorry for what I've done," Harry stood.
Luna eyed Harry for a few minutes, "I'll write to them and explain. Do you want to write the list of people or do you trust me to recognise who you need to hear from?"
"Actually, yes," Ginny took Neville's arm and Disapparated them away. Ron stared at the spot where his sister had been and paled, allowing Hermione to resume her conversation with Kingsley.
"Well, I asked you to give me a year after school to sort myself out," Harry reaches out to tangle their hands together.
₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪
"No, breakfast come to love," Harry groaned.
"Right..." Harry turned to see Narcissa and Andromeda stepping through the Floo.
"I trust you," Harry's response was quick.
Uncharitably, Draco thought, it was his father's only true act of love towards his family, stepping between the curse and his wife while a teacher - it might have been Flitwick? - cut the Death Eater down. Draco considered that he would be the new Lord Malfoy and felt another hysterical wave in his chest. He would never see the inside of the Manor again, relief mixing with trepidation at the idea of spending the rest of his life in Azkaban. Draco knew it was what he deserved, but felt the fear of the unknown sit in his stomach.
"No, Fleur won't let me. Says mum will never leave her alone if I do," Bill sighs, "She's due in three months, I don't know how she thinks she can hide it for much longer."
"Draco told me that I hurt him," Harry whimpered, "I cannot believe I did that. It feels - to me - like last week that I asked you for your permission to marry him."
Harry was staring at the fire in the Eighth Year Common Room, thinking about Draco Malfoy. They had been back at Hogwarts for months and Draco had barely spoken to him. He still heaped food on Harry's plate when he thought Harry wasn't looking, still made sure Ron and Harry went to bed at reasonable time, still wrapped a blanket around Hermione if she fell asleep studying. Draco clearly cared for him but he was spending a lot of time with Ginny, while Harry had bonded with Luna and Pansy. Harry sighed and stared up at the purple ceiling of the shared Common Room. If Harry was being honest with himself, which he didn't like to be, he knew he was making the rift between himself and Draco worse by being moody.
"Another late night raid?" Draco's hand strokes gently down Harry's spine.
Hermione felt Ron jump again and hissed, "What is the
Harry's apparent resurrection had birthed in Hermione a new respect for the magic of life itself. After watching Voldemort fall, she was determined to never allow hatred to shape the world again. She suppressed a small smile, she knew they were going to be grieving for months for all they had lost today, but she knew it meant that they actually had a future in which to grieve. A whole future with Ron and Harry and their families.
After stuffing themselves with enough food to last until dinner, the families moved into the living room to open presents. Draco was delighted with a first edition copy of 'Moste Potente Potions' from Hermione and the Fire Crab shell cauldron Harry had bought him. Harry was tucking into his packet of spiced rum fudge from Ron when he felt Narcissa's piercing stare.
"Oh, well I'm sorry if writing two sets of notes makes me a bit rushed."  Harry snapped from next to Draco who looked over at Harry so quickly, one could think he snapped his neck.
A blood-red bird greater than natural size flew into the misty white and grey that made up the September skies, disappearing only to dive down and splash the surface of the lake. The feat caused droplets to fly into the air on their agenda, imitating their guest before returning to the larger body. Draco's back was resting on the harsh bark of a prodigious tree, it's origin untrackable and species unidentifiable but Draco could feel magic pulsate through the trunk and the roots that weaved and wound across and beneath the ground. While the wood of the tree was a very dark shade when the sun hit at a certain time of day Draco could swear the organism seemed to glow a mystical shade of gold. The leaves were already a phantom of blue but with autumn rapidly approaching the leaves mixed with all shades of a summer sunset. As if mother nature were trying her attempts at watercolor. Tiny white mushrooms littered the base of the grand tree. The steam and cap were both colored a beautiful cream and had a sprinkle of black dots all askew, the gills seemed to glow an enchanting purple while petit rodents gather and feed off the seemingly harmless shrooms.
Draco grasped the bottle and sniffed. It smelled like absolute shit. Draco plugged his nose and threw his head back, chugged it in one go.
" Nothing, Mr. Malfoy, please head on to your next subject. I hope to see you at lunch, hopefully without another incident, hmm?" Draco flushed at the knowledge that Professor Surly knew about his issue with Tony from yesterday.
The two smiled at each other before Harry pulled Draco down the stairs and took off towards the castle.
However, dinner didn't go that way.
" I'm sorry."
" We're idiots." Draco stated bluntly which received a hum from Harry.
"Sorry Professor, it won't happen again."
" I beg your pardon?"
Luna turned to look behind her as Draco kept his gaze down, moving his food around his plate. Harry's eyes were narrowed and pointedly staring directly at Draco. There was no frown on his face, but he didn't look content either. Merely neutral.
How he wasn't jumping around the room by now was a complete mystery to Draco.
Draco turns around to see if Professor Colin was still down the same corridor as Harry and him. And sure enough, he saw the tall Professor leaning against the wall at the opposite end of the hallway. Draco leaned to his left in order to get a better look at what exactly was happened (which made him lean into Harry's arm, but neither boy seemed to notice or care) Harry turned back to find whatever was stealing Draco's attention from him only to discover his companion was staring at the teacher.
The disapproving stares of the crowd shut Draco up as he decided he'd tell the truth. Surely no harm can come from that, can it?
A few others entered, most likely drawn to the noise, as Draco was.
Moment ruined.
them.
Oh Merlin!
All of a sudden, Potter jumped on Malfoy making them both crash into the wall behind them, but before Draco could so much as react he felt the nauseating feeling of an Apparation being cast on him.
Once finding solitude in the Transfiguration room, the boys leaned on the desks as they once more composed themselves.
" Thank you, Headmistress."
"-and Draco, one last thing."
"It has. Anyway, it's just staring, it's not like I'm threatening him or anything."
The library was chilling that evening and brought in a gust of air from time to time. It would blow away the piles of paper Draco had laid out. "Could you at least
A light blush of embarrassment crept onto Harry's features as he instinctively scratched the back of his neck.
Instead of zoning out on Potter's eyes, Draco decided to take in his whole presences. His hair was, as always, a mess as well as his robes. The same old round glasses stood proudly on the bridge of the Gryffindor's nose, which appeared to only exist to frame the boy's spectacular eyes, similar to how a picture frame emphasized a work of art in a museum. The famous lightning scar mocked Draco by slightly glowing red with irritation. A calculating expression was painted over Potter's features like they were molded onto him.
Ever since Draco had come back to Hogwarts he had noticed the the vegetation around the castle had became quite overgrown. Vines climbed the walls of the building and weeds and wild flowers blossomed in patches along the grassy fields. Once Draco sat down on the stone bench, a string of pearls vine lazily dangled over his shoulder.
Ronald laid down on his seats showing he didn't expect an answer. Draco shortly repeated the action, his head by the window so he could watch as the glass fill with clear dots. Ronald's head by the door allowed Draco to see his long legs fold in an uncomfortable-looking position on the seats.
Revised and edited.
" Quite, Headmistress." Draco bowed his head in respect but managed to look back up at her so she would acknowledge that he still has
to write legibly?"
In...
"Yeah? And just what are you doing wandering around bumping into people?" Harry awkwardly extended a hand, only for it to go ignored. Draco pushed himself off the ground and wiped his hands on his shirt a few times.
" Already on i-"
" Well pardon me, you must know all about my life." Potter tried to conceal his angry but he couldn't help the irritation that leaked from his words.
Draco's mind flooded with memories of his previous years and the torment he put Harry and his friends through. Draco bit his lip, hard. He glanced at himself in the mirror. If he were Harry, would he forgive himself?
After finishing some assignments, Draco wandered the halls a bit. Professors were often swamped with work and didn't monitor the halls as strictly as they once did. Not that it matters, it wasn't curfew yet. The soft, warm glow of the candlelight urged Draco on as he walked to nowhere imparticular. Down some stairs and around some corners.
The two walked on for a while until their legs felt like weights, pulling them to a tired state. Sugary-sweet 'good-bye's' were exchanged as the two parted ways, heading to their rooms.
Professor Surly mearly gave a tired small and a curt wave as Professor Colin began steaming their way, shouting from down the hall.
Draco inched forward so he was stood next to Potter and then he promptly dropped to the floor. Potter looked down, confused at Draco who was sitting in the tall grass. Draco still had his gazed fixed on the beautiful sunset and didn't appear to expect Potter to sit down next to him, but that's exactly what he did.
Hooray!!
tall. Mind you Draco isn't super tall, but he's always been on the lengthier side, but this girl made Draco feel like a dwarf.
" Ah, well. Does-does it matter? I was only, WE-we were only talking. It, it doesn't really- I mean why can't we be able to...?"
" Of course, Headmistress."
Oh no no no, this meant more classes which meant more people. More judging eyes, and more sneers (now on the receiving end, Draco discovered that it really wasn't pleasant in the tiniest bit) and more Harry bloody Potter.
Potter turned around noticing that Draco was still in the room. He gave a curt smile that was accompanied with a calculated nod and went to gather his own things. Finally Draco set off, satchel at his side, headed to his next class.
Lovegood had an displeased expression directed at Tony and his friends.
"I meant your two friends. Don't be so full of yourself."
Draco walked for a good half hour and only saw three other students roaming around. Now with his gaze down, he let his feet take him where they wanted. He would close his eyes, for the most part, only opening them when he felt as if he was going to walk into a wall.
Draco rose one eyebrow as an unintentional grin spread across his face. “ Did you just speak to me like a horse?” The hand that was wrapped around Draco’s wrist retreated to scratch at the back of Potter’s neck (something Draco thought to be a nervous habit). “ Possibly.” Potter grinned as he slowly stood next to Draco.
" Of course, Professor."
"Staring is considered rude to many people, Draco." Luna's soft voice carried his head over to her. Silvery blue eyes held onto Draco's as he processed her words.
Draco mindless began rubbing the leaf of an elephants ear plant between his finger and his thumb as Potter finally sat down next to him.
It was a rhythmic sound that gradually got louder. Draco distinguished the noise as someone running.
Draco stopped running in favor of a calmed walk, still swift but significantly slower than before. He treaded into the short corridor that lead him to the court yard.
Potter tread about a foot or so in front of Draco, leading the pair to the middle of the stadium. Once reaching the center, Potter abruptly stopped which caused an absentminded Draco to slam into his back.
Draco's hand reaching for the gravy jerked at the statement and knocked over his goblet. The juice only spilled slightly before it was righted again, Draco cleaning the mess with a wiping textile.
" Headmistress?"
Don’t fear though, my original idea for this book hasn’t changed. I’ve tweaked some little elements but other than that it should be pretty similar!
Stare down at Draco.
" Don't sweat it. I didn't expect us to be the best of friends with our history after just one night." Harry's dazzling eyes hovered on Draco's artwork before it traveled up his arm and made contact with the other's eyes.
A messily dressed, puffy-eyed, Harry Potter stood there. Wand in grapes as Draco studied him in confusion. His clothes looked wrinkled and mishandled, his tie was thrown around his neck like a scarf and his robe was off one shoulder. His glasses sat askew in his face, but he must've seen clearly because immediately after Harry saw Draco he rushed over.
Please note if you find any mistakes and I will take care of them.
His blue orbs danced on top of the many heads that occupied the large space, finally setting on a some-what familiar looking head of a small Slytherin at the other side of the table. Draco wasn't even watching the rest of the room let alone Tony, but he could already tell that a good percentage of the students were entertaining themselves by watching Tony explode at Draco.
" Yes Potter, I'm alright. Are you?" He tried to hide his smile as he walked next to Potter.
Professor Colin (or " New Snape") wasn't even that similar to Professor Snape (no one was, at least not to Draco). Perhaps he was a little strict...
It wasn't much of a shock when the new Defense teacher settled on reteaching their previous lessons for the class instead of providing appropriate defense lessons, despite the many disputes from Potter and his goons. It had been a few weeks after Potter's fruitless argument against Martin Surly (the newest defense teacher) when the class received the news that they were to spend the next week or so 'disarming a treacherous boggart' as professor Surly explained. Draco nearly rolled his eyes.
And with that, Draco was off to potions.
This helps you, as the reader, to get a more enjoyable experience reading.
" He came to check on me after that squabble I had with Tony during dinner. He was merely being friendly and tried to cheer me up, we just lost track of time. That's all, and no. He did not poison me." A couple giggles and points to their friends were shared after the last sentence.
Silence.
After Granger sat down, a couple of other students went. Most were seventh years so Draco would only glance up once in a while.
"Bloody hell, Potter. Why are you so invested in this?" The raven-haired man crossed his arms, looking over at the owl at the foot of the bed. The owl stared back, it's large eyes reflecting the room. "Is this it? The owl who attacked you?"
He had been incredibly late to his first class and as a punishment the Professor made his stay later and help clean up, which lead him to be late to his next class and so on and so forth. It was one huge loop, Draco almost swears the professors planned it.
Draco explains a few things about life at Hogwarts so far.
" Actually, I was with Harry. Crazy to believe, I still can't really process it myself, but it's true."
Sure, she's scared, but that doesn't stop her from facing her fears head on.
Like hell was Draco gonna let Potter save the day.
Draco felt his face flush as he blinked rapidly, his eyelashes tickled the pale skin that surrounded his eyes.
Either way, why would Potter want to help him? Perhaps he pitied him?
" Then, eh...no."
(See the end of the chapter for
Ironically the same color of the boy's eyes that were across the field starring at Draco.
Draco quickly walked two steps in front of Harry and turned around to promptly jut his hand out.
Changing its form.
He made a bee line for his room in the Slytherin's dormitory after hearing another pair of footsteps behind his own. Draco started to pick up his pace as he swung around corners and sped through the halls, the mysterious follower close on his trail. On a very sharp turn, Draco turned his head to catch a glimpse of his stalker.
Once Draco had felt he had given enough time for Harry to...erm...conceal himself, Draco had turned toward said man. " When did you wake up for, all this?" Harry shrugged as he ran a hand through his damp hair and shook probably hoping to shake out some of the moisture.
" -than my-"
"Fine!"
" Do you think they're..." Draco asked while Harry's eyebrows met one another. " Could be possible, I just never imagined either of them to be the type. Anyway, I had a really good time with you and I was hoping you could sit next to me again. Possibly not just in Defense?"
" Are you alright?"
" Now if you will excuse me, I must be off to prepare for the day. I'd suggest you all start the day, I can smell some of you from here." And with that, Draco stood once again and headed out leaving the crowd with his trademark sass.
Draco can no longer conceal the question that was plaguing him inside, and like most of his interactions with Harry he just couldn't have enough self control to contain his curiosity.
Some blonde Hufflepuff had Voldemort (not unlike many others) while a small, freckled boy had a terrifying clown.
" Morgan, you promised me you'd listen." A slight glaze was now visible in Professor Surly's eyes. At the sign of a potential break down, Professor Colin turned his back on Draco and Harry and bent down to put his hands on either side of Professor Surly's head.
(Hey, I know y’all just wanna get to the reading, but I wanted to ask a little favor.
Granger was looking at Draco with a concerned expression, but one without true feeling behind it.
"Drink this please, all of it."
Wait... WHAT?!
" He ought to be pulling our legs."
It isn’t what he was expecting.
Matthew gave an impressed look, " Way to get the cake, Draco."
The one asking was Matthew, Matthew Greenland. A friendly bloke and not a bad looked either. He had some kind of "surfer dude" hair cut that went well with his brown eyes. Not the best looking, but better than many Hogwarts has seen.
" ... Indeed it is."
Just as Draco shifted his hand to pinch himself did Ronald sit down, directly across from him no less. Which was odd. Sure this whole situation was puzzling, but sitting in front of him? Draco wasn't even near the window. He was sitting directly next to the door, finding more calm in the red felt carpet that lined the hall. Draco stole a glance to find blue eyes already watching him, tracking his face like a hunter watching his prey.
Taking longer than Draco liked, he arrived at the infirmary. The familiar feeling of nausea and dizziness no doubt from the blood loss presented itself as he pushed open the doors; breathing heavily and stepping hard.
A few moments went by before Professor Surly turned his attention to Potter.
"Father, I'm sorry. I didn't mean for you to get in trouble!" Draco peeped in a worried whisper. His father's cold, gray eyes soften showing the sparse hints of gentle green in his eyes. However, Draco's worried expression didn't leave his features.
Comment any questions you may have.
It wasn't until after the two girls were completely gone that Draco took a look around the room and realized everyone else had left as well.
Draco stood up and shook his head rapidly, as if the motion would cause any bad thoughts to fly out of his head. He mechanically tied his tie in the way his father taught him. He quickly glanced down at his tie to insure its perfection before he hauled on his robe and grabbed his satchel to make his way to the bathroom to clean up before he started the day.
Draco felt a bolt of amusement at Harry's enthusiasm as he watched the boy throw his arms around Mother, trying not to laugh at her shock over Harry's exuberant affection. "Harry," Narcissa quietly assured him, "You are part of our family now and for us Blacks, family is
Hermione was still shaking with anger. She couldn't believe after everything Draco had done to build relationships with them, the second Harry saw Draco point a wand at him, he had cursed him. It had been three days and Hermione was no closer to letting go of her anger at Harry. Andy and her mum sat knitting together, while Narcissa stared out of the window of the Hospital Wing with Teddy cradled to her chest. Ron was carefully shaving Draco with a charm, Hermione had brushed his hair after Madam Pomfrey had used Cleansing Charms to bathe him.
His mother and aunt were clasping hands and sitting on a wooden bench, whispering to each other with tears down their faces. Draco thought if anything could mend the decades old rift between the Black women, it would be shared grief and a new baby. He startled when his mother roughly pulled his aunt into an embrace as sobs wracked from them both. He felt drawn into their grief, moved by the casual familiarity of his mother's embrace, until he caught sight of Harry awkwardly holding the still screaming baby.
"It was obvious. Your 'eart beats for Draco." Fleur gave Harry a misty smile, she was very fond of Draco.
"Thanks, Molly," Draco rasped.
Draco rubbed his arm absently. It had been Greyback who had carved the slurs about Draco's sexuality on his arm, the deepest one after he refused to identify Harry in the Manor. Greyback mocked Draco and implied that he wanted to be Potter's bitch. Draco hadn't told Harry that part. They had been barely speaking since the night that Draco had told Harry and Ron about his and Hermione's night out in a pub. Harry visibly shutting down at Draco's gleeful description of the cute surfer who had kissed Draco after hearing his posh accent.
"I've gotta go," Neville waved at the group.
"Winky is being going now," Winky bowed, "Restful dreams, Mr. Harry Potter."
, Draco vowed. Harry had drifted off to sleep, Teddy snoozing on his chest. Narcissa and Andromeda shared a small smile and gestured to Draco to take Harry up to bed. Draco carefully picked up Teddy, and handed him off to his mother, before scooping up Harry and quietly wishing his family goodnight.
." His mother fixed Draco with a sharp look, he knew she was making the same connection as he did regarding Harry's past treatment. "You are so thin I could snap you with a hug, you must eat, please Harry," Narcissa ordered him back to his seat. Harry smiled at her and immediately complied, knocking his elbow into Draco has he threw himself into his chair. Draco broke off a piece of bread and buttered it, immediately placing it in front of Harry's face. Harry must have understood his silent request because he shoved it into his mouth and began chewing it. Satisfied, Draco settled in to eat his dinner.
"Huh," Harry blinked, "McGonagall has a potty mouth."
She had gone after Harry with Ron as soon as she realised what Snape's memories had meant, but they were waylaid fighting Death Eaters who had hidden during the ceasefire. Hermione knew Harry was dead when she saw Molly crumple into Arthur, destroyed by the sight of a second son dead within hours, a son who had not been born to her but was as loved as all the rest. Hagrid's tear streaked face had told Hermione that her life and the life of everyone she loved was about to end.
"Harry, I don't think you should keep going," Luna advises.
"You need to trust that he'll come back to us," Draco rested a hand on the back of Ron's chair.
"Because Malfoy's about as straight as I am," Seamus laughed.
"Have you been drinking, Mr. Potter?" Luna asked with narrowed eyes.
The room was silent, Hermione telling Harry off was a rare occurrence since the war ended.
"I can't do it without you standing up with us, it's always been us, mate," Ron began to cry.
Harry will never forget the parallel his mind drew between the despondent Draco Malfoy that night and the miserable figure from his sixth year at Hogwarts, crying in a girls bathroom to a ghost. Draco was sat so far forward on the chair he was in danger of tipping off, his focus on the door which Harry assumed hid his wife from view. Harry didn't greet them, he just sat down next to Narcissa, leaned his head against the wall and closed his eyes. Narcissa nudged him an hour later and (somehow) communicated to Harry with a tilt her head and an eyebrow quirked that he should fetch them some refreshments.
Draco made to stand and leave, Harry reached out and snatched his wrist. "N-no, can you..." Harry desperately didn't want Draco to leave him alone. Draco considered Harry, frowning slightly as he took in Harry's flushed cheeks and nodded, "Do you mind me sitting in with you?" Harry flushed beet red and shook his head, hoping his tan skin didn't show the colour. He knew he was pale from months of hiding and running, but might be dirty enough for Malfoy not to notice. Draco stripped without any embarrassment and sunk into the tub opposite Harry, knocking his knee into Harry's and turning to turn on another tap.
Harry grabbed her shoulders and pulled her into a hug, "Gin, I love you, I do, but I don't, er, I love you like I love Hermione I think." Hermione smiled at this, she knew how hard it was for Harry to express emotional sentiments out loud. Ginny pulled Harry tighter and then held him back so she could look at his face, he started to mumble something about being friends. Ginny smiled, and gently let go of Harry. "How about family? I mean... You're basically our brother, Harry. I think if Mum had her way years ago she would have adopted you properly, but Dumbledore told her you had to remain with your family."
"There's a lot of pain you're all still carrying, but take it from a man who willingly signed up for war: none of you should have been put in the positions you were," Sergeant Parrish eyed Harry as if he was going to argue, "In my country, you cannot sign up for service unless you're eighteen years of age. None of you should have been forced to fight in a war, fight each other."
