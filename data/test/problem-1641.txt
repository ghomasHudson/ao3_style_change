“You alright?” Harry asked when he came back, and Draco realized that he’d actually sighed out loud.
The team cheered in one united, joyful bundle. As their shouts died down, Ginny let Quinn Winters hold the trophy while she tackled Harry with a hug. “How does it feel to be a champion, Harry?”
That familiar hot flash of guilt sprung free into Draco’s mind, and he wrestled it back into a cage as he said, “I left.”
The blow of the whistle pierced as sharp as a knife, and the players were off, Chasers scattering for the Quaffle, Beaters spreading out and brandishing their bats. Cass and Harry shot to the side, scouring the pitch for their quarry.
How could anyone ever love him, after all this time, after all he’d done? But as he replayed Harry’s words in his mind, Draco knew he wasn’t lying. An unfamiliar kind of joy filled him with warmth, and he savored it.
“You’re giving twenty years of your life to repay your and your family’s crimes, Draco. That doesn’t seem like enough atonement to you?”
“You may be right, Miss Granger,” Kingsley acknowledged with a nod, “But this ‘sensitive information’ is being published in the Daily Prophet tomorrow. At least, the gist of it.”
A strain of bright and soothing classical music began to play from thin air. The Muggles muttered among themselves, concluding that it must be coming from “speakers,” but the wizards knew better. Either way, everyone knew the ceremony was starting soon, and the crowd took their seats, expectantly twisting around to watch the beginning of the aisle.
Harry scoffs. “Just because my accent’s a little weak doesn’t mean I’m not British anymore.” There are other reasons for that.
Harry stepped inside and closed the door behind him. Malfoy put his wand away and sat down but didn’t take his eyes off Harry. There was a certain tension in the blond’s figure, as if ready to attack.
Then, rising from the wreckage like a ghost, Draco coughed and waved the smoke away. His shoulders and hair were grey with silt.
Harry squeezed his shoulder in an affectionate reprimand. “I don’t care if I sound like I’m talking in Mermish. As long as you’re taking care of yourself.”
Harry knew Ron made valid points, but he elected to ignore them. “Hermione,” Harry said beseechingly, turning to her, “I thought you and Draco were getting along.”
In fact, he hadn't been thinking much of Malfoy throughout the week. At all the funerals, Harry hadn't seen his pale face among the sea of black robes, and he had almost forgotten he existed. He's the enemy. Harry could never forget that night on the tower when Draco pointed his wand threateningly at Dumbledore. He's the enemy. But the look of anguish on Draco's face that night was that of a child. Not a dark wizard. "
“Ah-ah,” Lily, her bright red hair pulled back from a kind, pale face, shakes her head at her son. “What do you say when someone cooks for you?”
Bangkok’s magic slapped her in the face. Layers upon layers of it, old, new, cruel, and joyful, hummed in the sidewalk and just above it. Joey grit her teeth, concentrating - if Faraday’s associate was expecting them, it should be easy to track their thread of magic.
“Mr. Weasley, Mrs. Weasley, did you hear about the attack on Hogwarts in October?” Harry asked as the pie pan was passed around.
“Oh, don’t sound so worried,” Lucius says flippantly, “What other personal secrets could you possibly have? We already know that you’re a filthy faggot.”
Clarke,” Joey corrected. Melocotones’s wavy black hair, warm brown eyes, and broad smile were movie-star handsome. She disliked him immediately.
Harry frowns and flips the card over, in search of an explanation, but there are only more lines of type. An address, for a place called Lockhart Inc.
Draco gulped air, then muttered, “I can’t fucking do this. I can’t get up every day and face…any of it. All of it. You thought I could. Merlin knows Dad thought I could, but I….” Draco shut his eyes tight. “I’m not a killer.”
For a long while, Draco doesn’t say a word. He keeps his eyes on the road, hands nimble on the steering wheel, lips unmoving. Pansy wonders, bitterly, if she’ll fade from his lack of attention and turn into the ghost he seems to be treating her as.
A pink-haired boy stands on the cold beach, watching the slate-colored waves melt against the shore.
“Yes, it will,” Dahlia said confidently. “And someone may rise against you one day. If you're not careful.”
As Harry showered, Draco lay flat on his back on his bed, staring up at the ceiling. His mind moving a mile a minute with the words he wanted so desperately to say, he closed his eyes, listening to the water running.
Draco eyed Harry appraisingly. “You’ve done your fair share of sneaking; I’d nearly forgotten. Are you sure you’re not supposed to be in Slytherin?”
Pansy sneered. “I hope you’re not referring to yourself. You can strut about the castle all you want,
“Mm-mm.” Amélie shook her head vehemently. “She was in my Healing class this morning, I swear. I saw her with my own eyes.”
Harry swallowed. He felt cold all of a sudden, as if his blood had been imbibed with the March breeze.
“Couldn’t get anything out of Connors, either, told us to wait until after your interrogation,” Ron said with a huff, continuing his wife’s tirade.
Today, though, there’s a stranger at the counter. Harry can’t see what he’s drinking, but he notices a shock of lime-green hair, a pressed button-down, a puffy green jacket tossed over the stool next to him. It’s a slow night, the gaps in the bar and the tables echoing with some soft alt rock song Harry can’t name.
“What was that for?” Harry asked, mouth twitching in amusement. Draco was tempted to kiss him again but answered as his thumb brushed over Harry’s bottom lip.
Draco rolled his eyes, but his pale skin betrayed him with a blush. “You’re full of sugar, Harry Potter. Come on,” He said, reaching for the plates, “Let’s eat and figure out what you’re going to do today.”
“That’s enough, Harry,” Dahlia said softly. Harry sat down hard, chest heaving, and fists balled. Draco tensed when he did so; he’d completely forgotten how much of a temper Harry could have. Righteous anger rolled off him in waves, and Draco counted himself lucky not to be on the receiving end of it. Pansy wasn’t crying - he’d seen her cry only once -, but she had her head bowed in embarrassment, her arms folded tightly.
“Ha, ha.” The hand drifted from his shoulder and came to rest on the nape of his neck, fingertips grazing dark locks.
“Fine. I’ll get some paper, and we’ll write to the Minister.” Harry gave Draco’s hands a comforting squeeze before slipping back into his shared room.
Draco joined the attendees in applause as Ron and Hermione embraced, clutching each other tightly. Ginny whooped, and Harry clapped hard, pausing only to wipe away the tears beneath his glasses. The officiator had to raise his voice nearly to a shout over the cheers. “Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Granger-Weasley!”
“So long as you call me Ron,” came the reply. There was a silent battle of wills as calculating silver met cold blue.
“Hey, maybe this wasn’t such a good idea,” Harry said softly, leaning forward. “We can leave if you want.”
The image of Athena swooping away with their meticulously written letters ignited something in Harry’s brain, a spark that he tossed around for as long as it took to blaze. He ordered something from a Hogsmeade shop by owl post, and it arrived on Friday afternoon, just in time.
Darkness like ink crept in closer as the fire began to die down. Harry stared at Draco for a few minutes, freely admiring his tapered yet handsome features, slightly mussed blond hair, his luminous eyes as they gazed into his own. Like he had weeks earlier, Harry felt inebriated, but not with alcohol. He felt woozy with desire and admiration of the person in front of him - someone undoubtedly flawed, but all the more beautiful for their imperfections, both inside and out.
It was the first time Draco relied on his own reputation rather than his father’s, but it worked. Hyacinthe paled under the Malfoy’s stare and shook his head. “No, sir. I…um, I know who you can speak to. Please, follow me.”
He found Joey standing by the porthole, fiddling with her necklace, and muttering under her breath. She flinched when he came in, dropping the chain down her shirt and swiftly turning.
“You’re leading us in the opposite direction,” Harry commented, looking over Draco’s shoulder at the map they’d gotten from the hotel’s concierge.
Malfoy stood just outside the pitch, standing still and black against the green of the surrounding mountains. He was looking into the distance, but when he heard Harry’s footsteps, he turned to face him.
“Once upon a time, there was a poppy who lived in the desert. It hadn’t rained in the desert for a thousand years, and the poppy was very thirsty.” Oliver opened his eyes and nodded to Erin.
“Joey’s trying her best like all of us are. She made a mistake,” Footsteps sounded on the floorboard, then the springs creaked as Draco joined Harry on the edge of the bed, “That you still haven’t forgiven her for. That’s not the Harry I know.”
The hollow sound of eager dementors hummed through the walls of the cell. Draco was shuddering violently; he took deep breaths, trying to lower his heartbeat, his adrenaline. He thought of Marisa, standing dauntlessly with her wand outside. He thought of Harry, waiting for him at home.
The woman released Harry, which was just as well because Joey could see that Draco struggled so hard to repress his anger that a vein stood out on his neck.
“Never,” George replied with a grin. He procured from thin air a small hourglass filled with colored dust and handed it to Teddy.
Narcissa smiled sadly and pressed a gentle hand to his forehead. “I’m not Gemma, sweetheart,” She said over the prattling, “I’m Narcissa Black. Narcissa, in Slytherin house, you helped me with Charms homework once, do you remember?”
[Author’s Note: The original amount of total House points needed for a mysterious “grand prize,” as McGonagall specified in chapter 4, was 500,000. Upon closer calculation I realized that was way too freaking much. Please disregard that detail and change it to 4,000 points total.]
The three wended their way through the district, through the crowd, ignoring tantalizing smells and powerful waves of magic both. Interest nagged at Joey’s mind - how many wizards like them could safely practice their gifts around here?
“Excuse me, Pomona,” Came a voice at the door. Professor McGonagall stood in the greenhouse’s entryway, hands clasped apologetically at the waist of her burgundy robes. “If I could have a word with Malfoy? Please continue the class in his absence, it may take a moment.”
At the front of the hall, Dahlia noisily rolled up her parchment and left the chamber. A few students began to trickle in, yawning and chatting. Luckily, they didn’t notice Draco and Harry through the mental haze of Monday morning.
A fine mist descended upon the castle that morning, cloaking the windows and enchanted ceiling with light gray. The morning was still young; the tables had only been filled about a quarter, and the owl post had not yet arrived. Hermione, Ron, Harry, and Draco sat in a loose bunch at the Gryffindor table, helping themselves to still-steaming porridge, kippers, toast, bacon, and eggs. As usual, Draco threw a furtive glance around, but the surrounding students were either too tired or too immersed in their own conversations to notice that a Malfoy was sitting with the Golden Trio. And yet he kept a meter of space between himself and Harry, lest anyone mistake their relationship for more than acquainted classmates.
Both Ron and Harry stared at her at the end of this rather long and rushed speech. “Makes sense,” Ron said, once he’d registered everything. “Mate, we don’t blame you for not telling us sooner. You don’t owe us an explanation for who you like. We’re just glad you’ve got things figured out, that’s all.”
” With a crystalline clink, the jar duplicated itself. He carefully plucked a few leaves off, placed them in the jar, and screwed it closed. Draco glanced at Professor Sprout to make sure she wasn’t watching, then slipped the jar into the large pocket of his robes.
“Yes, you are a good listener,” Draco agrees, and Harry allows himself a smile at the compliment. “Take a right – not here, the next one. Wisteria.”
old wizarding families have had their run-ins with the Malfoys. And everyone knows the things Draco has done. The crimes he’s committed as a Death Eater.”
Then, after a pause in which Ginny did some swift thinking, she said loudly, “Hermione, Ron, are you two still prefects?”
The bus rumbled to a halt. The door hissed as it opened, and Draco jumped at the sound - Harry placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder. Most of the bus’s riders spilled out onto the sidewalk, and Harry’s hair immediately wilted in the humidity. He adjusted his bag, letting air flow between it and his back, wishing fervently for a Cooling Charm.
“That’s interestin’,” Hagrid murmured, seemingly to himself. “That’s real interestin’. Not ‘xactly what I expected, but not surprising, considerin’ all…” He trailed off.
“Turns out you actually had a thing for stubborn redheads,” Ron quipped, and Hermione laughed, bumping her shoulder against him in an affectionate gesture.
“Goodnight, Potter,” Draco said with a curt nod. “Let’s hope you don’t do entirely abysmal on the test tomorrow.”
The way Dahlia said “friend” made Harry wonder if the relationship meant more than that. Still having no idea what was going on, but sympathetic, he said, “I’m sorry.”
Anubis swore in what Draco was pretty sure was Gaelic. “Melocotones did not mention that, no. Any idea when Joanne will get here?”
Harry settled down on the stone floor, crossing his legs and leaning back on his arms. A moment later, Draco shifted to imitate his position, but whether it was deliberate or not, Harry couldn’t tell.
Soft footsteps padding on the tile make Draco smile; his mother is here. “Hello, darling.” Narcissa’s kind voice echoes slightly as she settles down behind him. As is routine, she pumps foaming, gardenia-scented shampoo into her hands and washes her son’s hair, fingers massaging his scalp and working out the tangles. “Tell me about your day.”
“Oh, it’s on.” Ron came immediately to his girlfriend’s aid, and he and George began to work speedily on a new barrage of snowballs.
“Heard that one before,” Hermione replied bluntly as she skimmed the lines. “You pureblood supremacists are quite unoriginal. Don’t you think so, Draco?”
Someone in a white lab coat comes in and grabs a stack of files. Their face is shadowed by dark, shoulder-length hair. “Sorry, ‘scuse me.”
The wind rushes through Harry’s hair, and he leans back, savoring this, the warm June night, the fence against his back, the steady thrum of music echoing far behind them. In less than twenty-four hours, he’ll be out of here, free to go wherever, whenever he pleases. The thought scares him, but Harry would never admit that to anyone but his best mates.
“Harry.” Dawn’s already broken, bleeding gold through the window. Draco’s face is ethereal in the light, sky-blue hair mussed from sleep, treasured eyes gleaming with worry. “I wish you’d talk to me, my love.”
Draco tuts, but he returns the hug. “I love you, too, you nut. Now calm down and tell me what’s going on before I lose my bloody mind. Please.” Harry’s smile is hidden in his lover’s shoulder, noticing, not for the first time, how Draco’s accent comes out when he’s upset or worried.
Draco rolled his eyes irritably. “It’s rather different when you’re in the middle of a constantly moving game, isn’t it?”
“You’re one to talk. She told me herself, you know.” Draco bit his lip, unsure whether to believe her, but Pansy’s words rang with conviction. “Make her happy, won’t you? I’m sure the Rosiers will find some suitable cock for you to choke on when she’s looking the other way.”
“It shouldn’t be normal,” Harry said fiercely. “Even before I came here, I automatically considered Slytherin to be the ‘evil’ house. Which obviously isn’t true.”
"Thanks, mate." Ron shot him a grateful look as he and Hermione walked away, still hand-in-hand. Harry felt a twinge of loneliness as he gazed ahead and spotted Ginny, sitting between George and Percy. He wished he could give her his shoulder to cry on. But Ginny had been acting distant for the past week. Harry felt it would be best to give her some space.
The couple landed in the foyer, slipping off their shoes and turning the lights on with a snap. Draco’s insides relaxed at the familiar sight of the flat: the neat kitchen, the less-than-neat living room with the cushiony sofa, armchair, tiny fireplace, owl perch, phonograph, and leafy houseplant. Harry tossed his suit jacket onto the sofa, undid his bowtie, and unbuttoned the top of his shirt. Draco bit his lip at the few inches of exposed skin, trying not to imagine the toned flesh below it. He wished Harry hadn’t placed the thought of sex in his mind; whether it was intentional or not, Harry’s face remained innocent as he bustled around the kitchen.
“Six.” Joey’s hands relaxed, and she was unable to meet her aunt’s eyes. “The sisterhood taught me that life was precious. And then they trained me to take it when they thought it was necessary.”
Embarrassed by his revealing speech, Draco fell swiftly silent, his hands fidgeting in his lap. Within the following silence, Harry felt his whole worldview shifting as he realized exactly what Draco’s words meant. Draco Malfoy had a crush on him when they were kids. Draco Malfoy admired The Boy Who Lived just as much as any other young wizard did. Draco had painted an image of his juvenile self that differed from the snarky, mean-spirited Draco that Harry remembered. An impressionable, precocious, though sharp-tongued, child peeked around the corners of their memory for a singular, intriguing moment.
Draco moved his hand to the space between them, palm curved over the sheets. “All right.” Harry reached out and took Draco’s outstretched hand, folding his fingers over Draco’s own. Draco allowed himself to be held and shut his eyes against the silver-lined darkness, counting the exhales of Harry’s quiet but steady breath until he fell asleep.
Draco’s face emerged into the firelight, his hand gripping the top of a chair as if it was the only thing keeping him from falling. His pale eyes seemed shattered, like pieces of a broken mirror.
“Ah, not this again,” Harry mock-sighed. “Bringing up jokes from fourth year, are we?” He asked Draco.
Harry watched him work with fascination. Draco didn’t look up once, his pale hands fluttering over the potions with intense precision. He stirred the mixture slowly, which rapidly changed from dark gray to a forest green.
Soon enough, two voices crackle through the stillness. Luna slumps in Padma’s chair, catching a whiff of her chamomile perfume. She sighs, every breath, every recorded word, splintering the cracks in her heart.
Joey’s mouth twitched. “It’s those issues that make us who we are, no? Every daughter grows up to be her mother. Every son eventually turns into his father.”
“So, instead, I didn’t think of the past,” Hermione continued. “I thought of the future. I asked myself, ‘When Voldemort is gone, how bright will my life be?’ I thought about how I still needed to choose a career, something that would allow me to make a difference. I thought about seeing my parents again. I imagined myself in a house in the countryside that held all the books I could ever want. I wondered how amazing it would feel to be successful, not just because I could do good work, but because I’d settle down with someone I loved. Start a family.” She glanced at Ron, whose ears had turned bright red. “And, well…it worked. I know it’s unorthodox,” Hermione said, meeting Draco’s gaze, “But when you cast the spell, try to build your own happy, future memory. So to speak.”
But the puerile shenanigans of the younger students didn’t bother Harry much. He had Draco, and his friends back, and that was enough for him.
“Come on, then,” Harry urged them. Whether his donning of the leadership role was intentional or not, Joey bit back a reminder that she was supposed to be showing the way. She was quite used to brash men automatically taking control - but no matter. She’d seize it back soon enough.
“How could you do this to me?” Harry whispers, and he’s crying now, tears slipping through Draco’s fingers. “I love you!”
The heat hanging over the ocean wasn’t blistering nor sunny. It sunk into Harry’s lungs, into his pores, and, incredibly, made his hair lie flat. Draco was most disturbed by this new development, and in the haziness of the muggy morning, deliberately ran his hands through Harry’s dark hair to muss it.
Harry heard the tapping at the glass first, and he immediately dropped his scarf on the dining table at the sight of the owl. With a serious expression, wide yellow eyes, and dark grey feathers ruffling in the wind, the deliverer’s clawed foot held down the letter on the windowsill to keep it from blowing away. Harry hastily lifted the latch, the panes swinging inwards, and the owl swooped onto the top of the nearest chair, dropping the letter onto the table. Harry picked it up and read the address.
Harry was quiet for a moment. His thumbs brushed gently over Draco’s knuckles. “For three years, I thought you were ready. I thought you wanted this. I’m not accusing you of anything, I just….”
Wild imagination carried Draco away in the stillness, and he found himself picturing the man in front of him, but with less clothes, and without the desk between them. Harry’s soft lips wrapped around his prick, rumpled black hair moving as he bobbed his head. Or perhaps the other way around, Draco kneeling before this titan of the porn industry, willfully choking on his eight inches, semen hitting the back of his throat as fiercely as whiskey.
It was dark when Harry entered the boys’ dormitory, the only light glowing dimly from the green cracks in the wall and the burning furnace. Aboveground, the sun had only just set when Ginny concluded Quidditch practice. But down here, the dungeons lay dark, the moon having not yet reached its apex.
“All yours,” Draco called, and he let the creature free. Joey flicked her wrist, muttering a spell, and a bolt of energy slammed into its flesh, crackling loudly. The krasue hissed in pain, skull hitting a stone building with a sound like a gunshot.
The rush of students, the indiscernible murmurs, the curious eyes that gave a once-over to the Chosen One and ex-Death Eater standing side by side. Harry couldn’t blame Draco for being apprehensive, for hesitating in the doorway. He didn’t give an answer right away, and Draco didn’t wait for one.
,” Joey muttered under her breath. Focus. She was grateful when Nina came with her cold cider - drinking it gave her something to do, calming the chatter in her mind.
A smile flitted across Draco’s face. He muttered something unintelligible, but Harry was almost positive he caught the phrase “complete sap.”
Draco’s hands gripped Harry’s T-shirt with desperate strength. His silver eyes wore the exact same fearful expression as they did the afternoon before, piercing and terrified. He seemed to finally feel the shock of their earlier discovery, panic setting in after twelve hours of numb, impassive processing.
Athena warbled disapprovingly, but she butted her head against his hand in an affectionate sort of way before flapping over to greet Draco.
A sudden flapping of wings startled them apart. Athena’s dark gray feathers were joined by the white and beige of a barn owl. Three rolls of parchment, two bigger than the other, were tied to its legs with telltale maroon ribbons.
The Weasley siblings, Harry, and Hermione trundled tiredly up to their respective rooms. Ginny and Hermione said their goodnights to the boys, who collapsed on their beds immediately after entering Ron’s room.
As if we don’t spend half our days bickering, Ron,” Hermione pointed out, and before Ron could think of a reply, she called out to Teddy, “Come get some lemonade, love.”
“Really. I mean it,” Joey insisted, and Draco realized she might have been talking about more than just healing. “Thank you.”
“I’m okay,” Draco said aloud. “I’m okay, I’m okay, I’m okay.” He believed it and was grateful for believing.
“This is hardly a proper way to dance,” Harry murmured teasingly, but Draco did not answer, though he moved his head slightly. “You really are tired, huh? We can go after this.”
“I’m dating Draco Malfoy,” Harry said clearly. A foreboding feeling curled in his chest, like a sleeping snake. “We’ve been together romantically since December. But we didn’t want to tell anyone. For obvious reasons.”
Then, steely ropes flung themselves around Harry, and he was pushed unceremoniously to the ground. His wand was yanked from his hand, and one of the sparrows disappeared.
“You’re right.” Dao looked up at the dozens of dementors, swarming and hungry. They smelled blood, and residual fear, leftover from the cowering witches and wizards that had been slaughtered by the righteous army. Those who died tonight deserved every bit of suffering. Dao truly believed that.
“I’m going to be choosing the partners for now,” Dahlia said, “As you all seemed to have settled into a partner picking pattern.” She let out a solitary laugh at her accidental alliteration before continuing. “Let’s see…Anaya and Gavin, Seamus and Parvati, Dean and Henrietta, Hermione and Pansy…” Harry saw Pansy roll her eyes dramatically, but she obediently walked over to Hermione, who looked queasy - “Draco and Padma, Harry and Ron. Owen, you lucky fella, you can help me with the demonstrations,” She said jauntily, and the curly-haired Hufflepuff swallowed apprehensively.
“Oh! Yes, sorry.” Hermione gave Joey a warm, apologetic smile. Her hair was just as frizzy and voluminous as when they had first met, tied back in a strained ponytail. “Hermione Granger.”
“Dahlia.” Antigone’s frown lines deepened. Joey could only imagine what was going through her head; she must have seen so many die, some even younger. “What happened?”
Shattered eyes fell upon the crumple of red at the base of the tree. Dao made a noise of displeasure, then uttered a command in Thai. Two of the wizards behind her rushed forward to revive their comrade. The other three started after them, but Dao snapped, and they retreated.
a complete disaster. Being forced to come out didn’t help. Ah…anyway, that’s a long story. The point is…” He paused. “It’s hard, being different. I’m not going to sugarcoat it. But I just want to exist, you know? Love whomever I want while everyone else leaves me alone.” Draco laughed again, short and bitter. “No one ever leaves me alone. But then again, what do I know?” He shrugged, as if to say,
“Hey, everything’s going to be fine,” Harry said soothingly, though, in reality, he had no idea how this was all going to turn out. The strange Thai wizards had shown up at the former Death Eater headquarters for unknown reasons, and that scared him profoundly. Powerful enemies, old and new, perhaps fighting each other, or worse, joining forces…that did not bode well for anyone. “How can I help?”
The mild weather had coaxed most students outside - they hung out in tightly-knit groups within the main grounds, a few venturing to the shores of the Black Lake despite the cold air wafting off it.
“Tell a few people and wait for the news to spread like wildfire,” Harry summarized. “I like the way you think, Mr. Weasley,” He said in an overly posh accent, nodding at Ron.
Suddenly, a loud thunk echoed throughout the room as Harry, reaching over Draco’s shoulder, slammed his hand into the door. Draco let out an
Harry decided they had waited enough. He picked up the envelope, slit it open with his wand, and began to read the brief, spaced letter. His eyes jumped to scan the contents before he’d read the whole thing, as they were wont to do, and Harry’s stomach dropped.
With the ringing of the bell, Harry and Draco met Ron and Hermione just outside of the classroom. “Nice potion,” Hermione told them as the group headed down the hallway. “You two always manage to do perfectly.”
“Oh right. What’s the topic for that?” Harry picked up the bow and dragged it across the strings. The instrument let out the appropriate noise, but the strings all played the same note. Harry frowned and waved his wand at the cello, turning it back into an armchair.
“Could you budge up a bit?” Harry asked a Ravenclaw sitting near them. The small, curly-haired girl and her friends were getting a bit close, and Harry wanted to save space in case Draco arrived.
“Morally, I do, since the alternative is willfully letting my parents rot in Azkaban,” Draco stated ominously. “Besides, it’s not like I’m good for anything else.”
“Stay there, Justin,” Padma says sharply over her shoulder, rummaging around in her bag. “Miss Lovegood, watch the monitor, please. If the activity starts to disappear, let me know.”
A glance at the page tells him that the chances of getting all the answers correct are slim to none. He grips the plume decisively and plows ahead anyway. The only constellation he’s sure of is his namesake. The great dragon coils around the North Pole, its serpentine body ending in a vicious, toothed head. Draco even adds extra stars for wings; perhaps creativity will score him some points.
Harry’s silent words couldn’t cross the vast expanse between him and his fellow Gryffindors, but he thought them anyway. He bent his head over his parchment as Flitwick lectured, removing Hermione and Ron from his mind. Quill in hand, Draco’s warmth beside him, Harry let himself pretend that he didn’t miss them, for just a little while longer.
“Of course, pardon me,” He said in a perfect English accent, with the kind of pronunciation that came many hours of practice, disguising a foreign tinge. Joey knew because she’d done the same thing. “There’s more of you, I hope?”
Three figures stood in the center of a forest clearing. Each was dressed in robes the color of fresh blood, but only two donned masks as they stood over the other. Above their heads, shadowy silhouettes swarmed impatiently, kept at bay by a silvery tiger, its fangs bared at the darkening sky.
Draco thought to himself, running fingers through his wet hair. He was fine now, but running around crime-ridden cities, witnessing murder at every corner - he wasn’t built for it. Not like Harry was.
“Fix the fountain, Potter,” Carraway commanded as he ambled over. “Good work to you both. Auror Clarke, you and I will throw this one to the dogs.”
“That’s not it at all,” Harry said quickly. His hand moved as if to grab Draco’s, then remembered their surroundings and slid back again. “I just want to make sure you’re okay.”
Although this chapter is a bit shorter, it does contain significant plot bits that focus mainly on the characters and their relationships. Draco and Harry sort of have their first "falling-out", and though it is a minor one, their making up is ultimately what is important about this chapter. There is something I would like to make note of going forward: this fanfiction is obviously based on the Harry Potter books, but does take inspiration and some quotes from the movies. As you may have noticed, characters like Grawp or Winky have not been mentioned. Like the movies, the universe of this fanfiction is more simplified, and altered to my discretion for the story. I will try to keep the personalities and actions of the characters true to the way JKR wrote them, but there will be mistakes. I am human, after all :) A similar disclaimer applies for the formatting of the fanfiction itself.
An instance of closure for Harry and company. One of the most challenging chapters to write, as I've personally never felt loss that significant, but fun to write nevertheless.
Before Harry could figure out precisely what the Slytherin meant, a third person clearing their throat startled them both. Harry hadn’t realized he had been staring into Draco’s silver eyes, but he tore his gaze away to see Ron standing at the other end of the dining table. The redhead looked back and forth between the other two; Draco stood behind and to the right of Harry, the shorter young man instinctively leaning into the taller. Their faces, due to the quiet conversation, were closer together than usual. Realizing how intimate the scene might look to an outsider, Harry stepped away from the Slytherin.
Impertinent bastard, she almost mutters, but she can’t be mad at a man who’s only trying to protect what he loves. Padma knows the feeling.
Percy dropped his fork in alarm. Molly gave a gasp of concern, but her husband only leaned forward, intrigued.
“Alright. Well, when you come out, Hermione can shock you with her wand. It’s a spell she uses to wake me up sometimes, it doesn’t hurt,” Ron added at Harry’s startled expression. “Okay, see you in a mo.”
The courtyard was filled mainly by Sin Pax members, most of them with masks covering the lower half of their faces. They all conversed quietly on the edges, giving nervous glances to the dragon in the middle. The beast had gotten bigger, somehow, since Joey saw it last, and although it was sleeping, smoke issued thinly from its nostrils, and its scales had darkened to a dull gray. No chains or visible enchantments kept the dragon restrained, and Joey made sure not to let it out of her sight as the group slowed.
By the way, at the end of the fic, I'll have an author's notes section with deleted scenes if you wish to read them, and a Q&A. I'll post a question box on my Insta (@eyes.like.emeralds), but feel free to comment any questions you have about my writing process, the plot, the characters, the upcoming sequel, etc. Please keep questions coherent and respectful. If there's a question whose answer may spoil something, I'll address it but will not answer it. Thanks again for reading!
“That’s alright.” The bedsprings and floorboard creak as Padma spurs herself to action, holding the phone to her ear and rummaging about in her dresser for something to wear. Seamus tosses and turns a bit more than necessary, and Padma feels a sting of annoyance. “I’ll be right there. Don’t do anything but keep him stable and unconscious.”
Snape retrieves a sheet of parchment from inside his robes. Once white and crisp, it’s yellowed and curled on the edges with age. Draco watches as he walks forward and tosses it into the fire.
His fingers are like cold marble, and when Harry stands, he abruptly tilts Draco’s face towards him, searching his eyes, which remind him of tarnished silver, an overcast sky. “I’m losing you,” Harry says, and the familiar words taste like acid.
grade creative writing teacher, who taught me how to actually plan a story, and make it seem like I knew what I was doing all along.
Harry told Mr. Weasley everything, from the train stopping unnaturally short to what the strange Thai witch had told him. Hermione chimed in from time to time to provide a perspective from outside the compartment. The only detail Harry deliberately left out was Draco staying back to protect him. The Slytherin himself noticed that Harry did not mention this; his pale eyes strayed curiously to his friend, but he said nothing.
Harry had gone immediately to Dahlia’s side. She lay gasping in the mud, eyes fluttering in the rain. The skin on her throat had blackened, and not just from the burn. As Draco watched, darkness began to ooze into her veins, crawling up her neck.
“What?” Harry asked as Draco’s jaw dropped. “What, who’s it from?” The Slytherin ignored him and opened the letter with anxious hands. His eyes sped over the message in less than a minute, his expression changing from surprise to concern to fear in a short period. When he was finished, he tossed the letter aside, and Harry caught it, curious to see what caused Draco to shake so violently.
“Kill me!” Malfoy gasped suddenly, and Harry opened his eyes in surprise to see Malfoy, his knife in one hand and throbbing cock in the other, looking up at him with an imploring stare. Shaking in fear or pleasure, Harry couldn’t tell which, Malfoy thrust the dagger towards him. “Do it!” He shouted, continuing to pull himself off with urgency.
Harry was doing his tie when Draco entered, schoolbag slung over his shoulder. “‘I hope you fail?’” He repeated with contempt. “Really, Potter. Twelve-year-old you could’ve come up with something better.”
“No one’s spiked it yet,” Ron observed, smacking his lips as the four friends gathered once more. He took another sip of the amber-colored punch and shook his head.
The dragon landed on the corner of the building, stone crumbling beneath its claws. It roared as it struggled to stay on, and Draco grew dizzy as the beast’s breath hit his face, the stench of coal and flesh rolling over him.
“Yes.” Dahlia wouldn’t look at either of them, and Draco understood. She had already done her grieving. The friend she’d known was already gone. She spoke in Thai again, firmly. A command.
“You’re going to want to pay very close attention, students,” She said seriously, indicating the plants with a tilt of her head. The vegetation was surprisingly docile compared to the rest of the specimens in greenhouse four; kept in wicker or steel cages, most of the plants either thrashed about or made menacing noises. The plants on the table, however, were simply pretty to look at. Delicate, almost translucent rose-gold leaves grew in clumps on long stems that appeared white and soft.
Across the park, Malfoy shrugs off his blazer. It’s against the rules to have it off when school’s in session, but the late summer sun does uniformed students no favors, so Harry doesn’t blame him. His thin shoulders and graceful neck remind Harry a bit of a fairy out of a storybook.
“Ever been to the French coast?” Carraway cut in, and Harry and Joey turned to look at him. “Beautiful this time of year.”
“From the few highway signs in English,” Harry ran a hand through his unruly hair, “A few more hours, I’d reckon.”
Wispy, black smoke poured out of the fixture, spilling onto the floor. A few of the third years gasped in anticipation.
Harry slowed, shivering in the sudden cold, turning to look behind him, but the tangle of trees was too thick. It was Joey’s turn to yank him, her words garbled in a cold, hopeless haze. Where was Draco? Why wasn’t he with them? Tears threatened to spill from Harry’s eyes; the dementors were closing in.
Hermione finally looked up, agitated. “It’s so hard to make progress with this topic!” She muttered. “Every time I answer a question, another one pops up.” She sighed, pulled out her wand, and traced it into the book’s spine, marking the page with a magicked lilac ribbon. “What kind of prejudices cause people, and by extension, governments to hate a certain group based on the way they love? Why is it so hard to pass legislation against these prejudices? And when it comes to LGBT rights, why are both the wizarding and Muggle worlds still living in the 19th century?”
The music swelled in volume, the rich harmonies from the cello backing up their higher-voiced counterparts. “Let’s see if you can handle a spin,” Draco said suddenly.
“I need to get you away from here,” Harry says, panting. He glances back at Draco, bemused, dressed in the cream-colored sweater and black jeans he wore the Saturday they were in New York City.
Draco has Harry pinned before he can say a word, silver eyes narrowing as his palms press Harry’s wrists to the mattress. There’s a whole lot more strength in him than Harry expected, and he flinches, hoping at least Draco will have mercy on his glasses.
Harry dropped to the dirt at the first flash of red, rolled behind a bush, and peered through its leaves. He was terribly vulnerable, far from any substantial magic reserves and the safety of his wand. Harry wished for anything magical - one of those phoenix-infused amulets, a Strengthening potion, even the charmed necklace Draco had given him in their eighth year.
Hot water and steam from the showers poured upon Draco’s aching body, the high pressure and temperature bringing relief to his muscles. He sighed, leaning against the wall, letting the water spill between his shoulders and down his face.
, even, the cutting wit and snide remarks that leave Harry’s sides aching. The tenderness, though, Harry has hardly ever seen, the gentleness that makes Draco coo at a kitten in a pet store window and let a couple of kids skip the line at the fair with feigned reluctance. Draco has really come into himself, his sharp edges softened, his smiles more common.
Harry scanned their surroundings, finding the Ravenclaws at a booth near a window. They appeared to have just ordered butterbeer, white foam threatening to spill over the golden-hued sides.
The kitchen stood hauntingly empty. The wood in the grate no longer emitted smoke, and the dishes lay clean in the drying rack. Harry felt his way through the semidarkness and poured himself a glass of water, gulping half of it down and refilling it as he looked through the window. Outside, snowflakes blew by the frosted pane as if in a terrible hurry. Harry hoped the storm would abate by morning so they could spend some time outside.
“Please continue,” Padma says, monotone, but Luna recognizes the guise in her voice, the thin covering of ice that hides rolling waves beneath. It’s the voice she uses when dealing with a patient close to her, a family member - they don’t come often, but Luna remembers how Padma’s demeanor changed, how her stern brow tensed with emotion, her eyes rimmed in red.
Behind the podium, the small wizard had left for George to say a eulogy for his twin. Harry straightened in his chair, determined to listen, but he was distracted by a chuckle from his left.
Hagrid grunted approvingly as he put on a lumpy oven mitt, grabbed the kettle, and poured hot water. “Suits her. One of you can keep her if you like.”
When he stood from the mattress, Harry promised himself that he’d change and brush his teeth, but by the time he got to his own bed, he was simply too tired. Harry flung off his shoes unceremoniously, flopped upon the sheets, and fell asleep with a heart full of content.
“Er, I don’t suppose there’s any possibility of Malfoy actually doin’ such a thing?” Hagrid asked, more to Harry than Draco.
The three of them burst into the classroom and hesitated at the threshold as they took in the classroom’s wild appearance. The banisters of the stairs to the professor’s office were draped with warm-colored, gold-embroidered fabrics. Along the walls hung exquisitely detailed paintings, some of which, upon closer inspection, did not move. Bookshelves behind the teacher’s desk were crammed not only with books, but with papyrus scrolls, a few assorted statuettes, and a human skull. Two flags hung from the edge of the desk; a rainbow-striped one, and a red-and-gold flag depicting a ferocious bird.
Draco’s jaw clenched, then his expression morphed to confusion. “Likely?” He echoed. “Have you been given a sentence?”
But loyalty and desperation pushed them forward, and Rabbit knelt by her mistress’s side, hoping with all their might that she would wake.
They had arrived in front of a particularly dark and narrow alleyway that seemed to stretch on forever, past Joey’s line of sight. A couple of wizards in dark blue robes leaned against the poured concrete, sharing a cigarette that issued a thin stream of lavender smoke. The shorter, a woman with long, dark hair and sickly-pale skin, spotted them first and began to giggle.
The smell of exotic ingredients and smoke drifted out from the Potions classroom. Harry paused at the doorway and briefly touched Draco’s arm. “We can be Potions partners, if you want,” The Chosen One offered. “And I can tell you what friends talk about.”
Potter shook his head vigorously and stood up again. “That can’t be it, Malfoy,” He said, “You’ve just been thrown into unlucky circumstances. No way that was your fault.”
“One final announcement before you all go off to bed,” McGonagall raised her voice over the crowd of students that had become abuzz at the appearance of the new professor. “This year, the House Cup will work a little differently than it has in previous years. There will still be a trophy awarded to the House who accumulates the most points. However, if you all work together to earn
The Slytherin pulled back a little, and it was then that Harry noticed the thin gash shining redly on his pale skin. “Malfoy, you’re hurt,” Harry murmured, his hand drifting to Draco’s face. He thought he heard Draco’s breath hitch as his thumb brushed his cheek - though perhaps that was just his imagination.
Tea sounded wonderful, Harry had to admit, and he and Ron joined Hermione on the blanket, the cuffs of their jeans dripping with water. Hermione slid her book away from the stray droplets before reaching inside her bag, pulling out a large thermos, three mugs, and a stack of sandwiches wrapped in tinfoil.
Harry woke at dawn, though he didn’t properly register it - the bed hangings deep beneath the castle let in none of the stray glow from the lake. He felt around for his glasses, slipped them on, and the shadows grew sharper at the edges. He took a deep breath and silently began to count to twenty.
“I should be offering my congratulations,” Dao said in dry, sarcastic English. “Top of your class and bound to be a do-good soldier for a country that’s not yours.”
The question is so razor-sharp even Malfoy looks surprised at himself. Harry’s mouth falls open. He forcefully closes it.
“Don’t apologize, I know. But I’m serious, Potter, it shouldn’t have happened. It only happened because of a lack of self-control on my part.”
“Should we get closer?” Harry suggested, and before they could decide, someone peered around the corner of the house.
Harry turned from the window to join the pair, but a sudden coldness from his necklace stopped him. But before he fully registered it, a voice called out behind him.
The warm golden light of the floating candles illuminated Harry’s friends’ faces as they leaned back from the meal. Hermione and Ron sat close together, Ginny introduced herself to a pair of sixth years newly transferred from Beauxbatons, and Dennis Creevey recounted the exploits of snake-slaying Neville to a group of wide-eyed first years.
Draco worked as fast as he could without moving Joey around too much. He tore open the front of her shirt, cringing at the damage. Her whole torso was drenched in crimson, and Draco’s heart dropped. He didn’t dare articulate, not even to himself, how much time she had left, but focused on siphoning away some of the excess blood to more easily identify the wounds.
“Anyway, that’s not it. I can’t talk to snakes anymore,” Harry continued. “It’s…I…I like boys.” He looked at the ground, face warm.
But what the commentator said next, Harry did not hear, because Ginny was shouting, “We won! We won! This is it, final stretch, everyone…!” Willow, Danny, Richie, Eleanor, and Quinn were all slapping each other on the back, congratulating, “Nice save on that last shot!” “You three were
The rest of the students neared the end of their brewing, and when Parvati’s and Owen’s love potion started shooting blue sparks, Professor Slughorn decided to dismiss class early. The eighth years moved to the exit without hesitation, eager to free themselves from the clutches of structured intellect. As they took to the hallway, Draco extended an arm behind Harry and rested a hand on his shoulder - the action was unfamiliar but welcome, and Harry allowed himself to smile as they walked.
Heat creeping up in his cheeks, Harry gave the four students on the other side of the table a cautious glance, but they appeared to be too busy to notice what had happened.
Draco, panting slightly from running upstairs, returned with a glimmering object about the size of a bottle of wine. A white ceramic vase, inlaid with swirling patterns of gold and bits of sapphire, was gently cradled in his hands. He held it out to Mrs. Weasley, who took it carefully, her expression taken aback by the obviously expensive decoration.
“Thanks.” Harry placed the cake box on the kitchen counter, and Draco fixed his gaze upon it. “When do you want me to pay you back?”
“I’ve got class, but you go do that,” Ginny said. “See you all later.” She shot Harry a concerned look before leaving.
Harry thought, but he knew from personal experience that apologies often weren’t enough. Instead, he reached out towards Draco, palm up.
“I couldn’t possibly eat it while it’s moving,” Draco lamented as the squid peeked into Harry’s glove and gurgled curiously.
"Good morning, children," Professor Slughorn greeted them as a dozen students walked in. He stood in front of his desk, hands crossed over his portly frame. "Ah, well, I should say, young
Thus, Friday morning found Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny eating breakfast after most everyone else since the older students’ classes started later. Ron dug into the spread with his usual gusto, Harry and Ginny chatted over toast and jam, and Hermione perused a thick book, leaving her oatmeal virtually untouched.
were carved deep into Draco’s skin, more so than the Dark Mark itself. During the few hours of wandering about Ho Chi Minh City, Draco had often asked himself whether he should have kept it a secret. But time had taught him that hiding the truth had disastrous consequences.
“Er, no. The…you know…” Harry took a deep breath. “Our kiss.” Saying out loud made it terribly real, and a part of Harry wished he could yank it back.
“Scales,” Came a soft voice from the darkness, making Ron jump. “Chinese and Japanese dragon scales.”
“It’s up to you. You won’t be doing missions with me anymore, that’s for sure. I’m staying in Brooklyn.” Joey nodded; she knew this. “Maybe I’ll major in something. Business, writing, anything I want. And I’ll marry Portia.” Latifah smiled, breathing in the crisp autumn, surely imagining the many more she’d spend here. “I know I will.”
Draco unscrews the cap of a miniature whiskey bottle, pouring a few drops into his mug. Harry makes a noise of annoyance; Draco glares at him.
Apprehensively, Harry took the box and opened it. Inside lay a smooth jet stone set in silver, hung on a delicate chain.
“You’ll meet us here with the others at two tomorrow night,” Nikki told the Aurors. “You won’t have to do much. Just watch it all unfold.” She grinned like a skull, and even Kevin’s un-inked lips seemed to twitch.
Not long later, a few sharp raps came at the front door. Harry skidded across the tiled foyer in his haste to open it; he got the feeling that Joey was someone who despised anything less than promptness. She stood before the doorway, face completely neutral, wearing the same Muggle collared blouse and jeans she’d worn to that morning’s meeting, minus wizard robes. Joey held a large, white cardboard box and as it came into view of Draco, standing in the kitchen, Harry could almost hear him perk up in interest.
In which Harry and the other Aurors prepare for their mission. Meanwhile, Draco struggles to get used to their new partner.
“Nothing!” Harry felt heat rising up his face, and he was grateful for the orange firelight. “I guess it comes from being enemies for seven years.”
The woman, face hidden in the shadows, beckoned with an arm wrapped in loose, autumn-colored cloth. “I am who you are looking for,” She said musically and disappeared through the opening.
The image of a child strangling a man, no matter how despicable he might have been, was burned into Joey’s mind. She couldn’t help but be reminded of herself. She replayed the sight of Draco’s and Harry’s figures huddled around a corpse in the rain. It was as if Dahlia had reached out from death, showing Joey the decisions she’d made and where it had led her.
This chapter begins to set the stage for the next part of the ABYS saga - that may not be written for a while yet! Though Harry and the rest are still at Hogwarts, I couldn't resist a little indirect worldbuilding for wizarding England. Also, that was the first time I wrote out a Daily Prophet article :)
did. That was the most she ever felt for one person. Ginny didn’t know that it was supposed to be more until she started exploring her sexuality. I helped her through it, to realize that what she felt for girls was what she desperately wanted to feel for you.” After Harry didn’t reply, Luna pressed, “Ginny loves you, Harry Potter. It’s just that the love she feels for you is not the kind you’re looking for.”
“Those are shit odds; you deserve to lose that money.” Fifteen-year-old Harry can’t help but look for Ginny in the crowd, but her flaming hair must be covered with a hat.
It was hard to read Draco’s expression for the next few moments. Harry felt fourteen again, quivering in front of Cho Chang’s confused stare as he asked her to the Yule Ball.
“Not so obvious,” Draco contradicted softly, but before Harry could argue the point, Ginny waved impatiently at them.
Theodore didn’t answer but emerged from his hiding spot, casually coming to stand beside him. He hummed thoughtfully as he pawed through the shirts, looking back and forth between them and Draco. Finally, he picked out a number that Draco admittedly had his eye on, a crisp garment with a gorgeous, silvery satin color. “Matches your eyes,” Theodore remarked.
“Yes, Ginny!” Ron whooped, and Luna cheered as she waved her red flag. The May sun beat down on the field, sweat glistening on the players’ faces as they wove around each other in the air. The glint of the Golden Snitch was more obvious than ever, and Draco saw the Ravenclaw Seeker perk up and zoom towards it.
“That’s good to hear,” Harry remarked. It was the first piece of news he’d heard about the Grangers since the Battle of Hogwarts, but then again, he never asked.
you think they’ll accept us?” He said abruptly, and it took Harry a minute to realize who he was talking about.
Nearly a year since they’d met in the alleyway, faces lit by the shy moon and stray lamplight. Silver eyes turning away even as they crinkled at the edges with gratitude. Harry couldn’t help but wonder if Draco had loved him, just a little, even then.
The witch inclined her head in acknowledgment. “Our brisk sweep was inconclusive. I am sure we can trust your word.”
Whispers again float from behind Draco’s chair, and Lucius frowns. “Ah…He got the Dark Mark removed somehow so that immediately means…I see. Very well.”
“Not shit odds when it comes to you, Harry. I’m counting on you.” Ron gives him one last thump on the back before disappearing back up the bleachers.
But perhaps that was the first time he met Isabelle. Draco, he ran into on the beach, all pale lashes and blustery limbs, hair the color of squeezed limes. He was hardly recognizable.
Those are the words he wants to hear. But it doesn’t matter if they’re true or not, because Draco’s lips, his voice, his eyes, have dissolved into nothing.
“Wood! Over here!” Harry screams, and his teammate kicks it. A gap, a beautiful gap, opens between the keeper and the goalpost, and Harry takes the opportunity. The ball sails straight into the net.
After another round of butterbeer, the howling wind was audible even through the tightly closed door of The Three Broomsticks. Hermione fretted that a real storm would pick up soon, so the four students left with their scarves wound tightly and hats secured. They bent their heads against the snow, pushing steadily through the snowdrifts that grew bigger and bigger the closer they got to the castle.
Draco, on the floor, breathes in gasping gulps, his heartbeat fierce with fear and betrayal. Lucius holds not an ounce of pity for either of them.
“What’s the big rush?” Ron asked, flipping unenthusiastically through a Potions textbook. “He used to be our biggest enemy, Harry. We spent so many nights complaining about him. This is kind of a big adjustment.”
Joey felt lightheaded, but in a good way, like she’d just gotten off a rollercoaster. “Well. That was much easier than I thought.” She gulped down some of her cider, which tasted crisper and sweeter as if someone had dropped in a tablespoon of honey when she wasn’t looking.
“Yes, yes, yes…” Draco muttered, reaching back with one hand, encouraging Harry to push faster, harder. Harry laced their fingers, and Draco twisted slightly, their mouths meeting clumsily. Christ, he could get used to this, used to everything - Harry’s slippery dick pulsating within him, soft lips against his, strong hands pressing against his lower back.
The six companions studied for the better part of an hour, the comfortable silence often punctuated by idle conversation and requests for homework-related advice. Draco finished his Potions reading much faster than Harry did, unsurprisingly. The Slytherin closed his book with a bit too much force, the subsequent puff of air blowing his quill off the table.
Ginny chuckled too, swept away by the ridiculousness of the situation. “Okay, it’s kind of funny,” She admitted, “But, Luna - urgh, it’s on my robes now - Hermione, someone help, please!”
“That’s the part you’re worried about?” Draco says, tossing the folder aside, and dramatically grabs his chest. “Ugh, someone doesn’t find me attractive! I’m wounded!”
“Oi!” Someone shouted, and Draco opened his eyes in time to see a crumpled ball of parchment fly and hit him in the chest.
boyfriend,” Pansy says smugly. She reaches for a beer as well, shiny black nails tapping on the metal. “I have a boyfriend now, by the way.”
“We’re underground,” Draco reminded her. A roll of explosives was laid out, and he checked them each by the light of the bare bulb hanging above them. His pale hands moved slowly and steadily, which Joey appreciated - one wrong move might bring down the whole cavern.
In the ensuing silence, the Slytherins dispersed, some still muttering about the article, others glancing at Hermione as if she either impressed or scared them. She settled back into the couch, next to her boyfriend, satisfied with herself.
“Hold on,” Harry said, the Cloak clutched in his fear-white fist, “No way. Even if they’re really unarmed, there’s no way I’m letting any of you risk your lives for me again.”
“‘Melancholia is, I believe, a musical problem: a dissonance, a change in rhythm.’” Luna stops her recitation, suddenly, and her brow furrows with the bluntness of it. “I don’t know the rest. It’s beautiful, though. By Alejandra Pizarnik.”
He spends the school day distracted, thinking of a plan to apprehend this new development. At nightfall, he empties his two trunks and shoves the stuff under the bed when the dormitory is empty. As he does so, he hears a sudden spurt of loud laughter from the common room. Potter.
“It’d look too suspicious,” Harry agreed grimly. “Hey…maybe we could ask McGonagall personally about seeing your parents once we’d get back. If anyone can request something from the Ministry and actually get it, it’s her.”
It was even warmer in the city’s proverbial rafters; perspiration beaded on Draco’s forehead, and he wiped it off irritably. He hated sweating. At least it smelled less of blood so high up. Draco hadn’t even realized he’d gotten used to the stench over the past day until they’d come up here.
The seconds, minutes, or hours - Draco couldn’t tell - ticked by. “Okay…” He murmured to himself. “Where was I?” Right. Lists.
If anyone could bring life to the halls of Malfoy Manor, it was an energetic two-year-old with a heart of gold and a penchant for flashing his hair rainbow colors. Harry had been a little dubious about letting Teddy Lupin run around the black marble corridors, but after his and Draco’s painstaking modifications, even Andromeda agreed it was safe to bring him. Andromeda Tonks knew what was best for Teddy more than anyone.
And then it stops, and Draco is on his stomach, cheek pressed to the cold, dirty floor. His breath comes in shuddering gasps, and his body aches. But he’s numb and ready to endure it a thousand times if it means keeping the Death Eaters from taking advantage of him.
“I do.” Harry took Draco into his arms, and Draco melted against him, face turned into his shoulder. “Thank you.”
Harry shuddered, looking wildly around. He must have imagined Draco’s voice - he was a whole country away.
Harry didn’t hear their conversation, but he knew his friends were down in the bleachers, watching him, ready to cheer him on. Most of his mind was focused on the match ahead, but he couldn’t help but feel grateful that they could be here on one of the most momentous and final days of his adolescence. His last game of school Quidditch. His last chance to continue to prove that he was more than the Boy Who Lived.
“Hiya,” Hermione smiled as she retrieved a thin, plaid blanket from her bag. With a wave of her wand, she caused the blanket to spread upon the ground, far enough from the lapping ripples of the lake.
Harry did the same, confident that he'd break it as he once did Voldemort’s, but this time, it felt as if dozens upon dozens of hands held him down. He strained and strained, managing to point his wand towards the tiger-faced witch.
A hand pulled him from the darkness of his nightmares. "Harry," Hermione whispered, "Are you alright?"
A jet of red light streaked through the air like an arrow. Harry slashed his wand through the air to block it, but only a faint shimmer of a shield appeared for a brief moment before the curse hit him square in the chest.
Hurried footsteps echoed down the pathway as Draco sprinted towards the gate. Snow lay in piles on either side, watching him with icy disapproval. He made it to the gate and reached out, then a
“It’d take all day for him to list the reasons,” Draco said dryly, absently fiddling a quill between his pale fingers. “He probably thinks I’ll try seducing you next,” He told Ginny.
Harry reaches for his arm, and Draco dissolves into smoke. Beneath his feet, the street opens its black maw and swallows him whole.
“Mother.” Draco thought his throat might close up when he saw her, or perhaps he’d cry. But all he felt was a rush of muted relief, that she was safe, and not yet imprisoned.
“Uncle George, Uncle George!” Teddy shouted, sprinting to the kitchen table, where most of the grown Weasleys and their partners had gathered. “Did you bring me a present?”
“My name is Luna Marie Lovegood, and I…” A tremble, a sniffle. Luna’s stomach swoops, her eyes widen in the dark.
Draco scolded himself as he combed his damp hair. He didn’t want to think about Lucius Malfoy right now. Not until they were face-to-face.
“Good to see they’ve found someone halfway decent to replace me,” Draco said, silvery eyes narrowing critically at the field. The players had emerged from their locker rooms, mounting their brooms. The new Seeker, a lithe, dark-skinned boy, was adjusting his forearm guards.
“I told you yesterday.” Draco poured a liberal stream of syrup over his pancakes. “I’m really close to a breakthrough on a teleportation potion. At least, the second prototype. I think reverse-stirring
“So, what are you all looking forward to doing in 1999?” Luna asked, retrieving her perfectly browned marshmallow. “Let’s go in a circle. Ginny?”
Full with a lavish dinner and Mrs. Weasley’s strawberry-rhubarb pie, six teenagers sat around the fire pit beneath a starlit sky. Luna had arrived a couple of hours before to celebrate the new year; she and Ginny sat close together on fold-out chairs. Mrs. and Mr. Weasley had stayed out long enough to watch the self-starting firework show George had left them, beautiful and intricate bursts of color lighting up the midnight. But they soon retired to bed, leaving the teens with a handful of sparklers and bottles of butterbeer.
“Find the dragon.” Draco looked up towards the imagined ceiling, squinting, listening hard. “We need to get higher.”
“That’s not a real insult. That’s a nothing insult,” Max replied, pointing his sauce-glazed knife at her.
“The plot changes every night,” Owen replied as he stabbed a stalk of broccoli. “It’s a game we play. Someone starts by saying ‘once upon a time,’ and we take turns until we reach the end. Each person gets a maximum of two sentences. The story has to be interesting, but it has to end at the last person or else…” He stopped, eyes widening spookily, and bit into the broccoli.
“None taken, that was funny,” Draco said with a half-shrug. Harry knew he was being sincere, though he wasn’t sure if Hermione and Ron could tell - thankfully, Ron looked somewhat mollified.
Harry was inclined to disagree, but he said nothing more. Instead, he walked silently by Draco’s side as they went back into the house. Secretly, Draco’s worry had rubbed off on him, but Harry did his best not to give into it. All they could do was wait.
Sometimes it scared Draco how powerful his boyfriend was. Thank Merlin, they were on the same side now.
Draco clicked his tongue while making a finger gun, a gesture that Harry found strangely American. Joey appeared duly bashful.
Joey limped forward, head swimming, boots squishing in the mud. The summer rain was warm, but she still flinched in surprise as she felt it drumming on her bare head, a sensation she’d not yet gotten used to.
“So, we’ll just get the lunch bag and Apparate,” Draco said, turning to walk back to the house, but Harry didn’t let go. “What?”
took care of. But You-Know-Who brought her himself into the house. He said he was disappointed in me for not killing Dumbledore, so he wanted to give me a second chance with this girl they found.”
“They let me off the hook for being a Death Eater since I was so young,” Draco explained. “But my - um, other crimes my family committed hadn’t been properly penalized.” Again, Harry got the feeling that Draco was hiding something, but he didn’t dare ask what. “But the Commander offered me a way to pay off the ‘debt,’ per se, that the Malfoys owe, via a type of…” He paused delicately, searching for the right words, “Indentured employment. If I work as an Auror for twenty years, they might let my parents and me go free. She wasn’t clear on what would happen to them in the interim, but-”
“We can escape from the erasing,” Harry realizes. Draco opens his eyes, and they glimmer with satisfaction. “You’re brilliant, absolutely brilliant,” Harry proclaims, covering Draco with kisses, one for each word.
Yet Harry that they weren’t meant to stay, and it wasn’t long before the Aurors found the bus that would take them and a multitude of others to Ho Chi Minh. Half of the bus was filled with American Muggle students, looking like seventh-years, and despite being relatively close in age, Draco made a beeline for the back of the bus away from them. Harry followed; normally, he wouldn’t mind making conversation with strangers, but the last few days had drained him too much to try.
Harry found a delicate, silver ear clasp in the shape of a dragon at a thrift shop in downtown Ashfell, its eyes set with sapphires. The piece was odd and beautiful; Harry felt sure that Draco would love it. He had it wrapped in a pale green box lined with cheap velvet.
“Of course, you are,” Draco says dully. “You’re erasing me. Now, Potter, do you think a poor artist-slash-café minion like me can afford a single damn thing here?” He slides gently from Harry’s grip and looks again to the store window.
“Precisely. An accurate moniker, to be sure, as they rule with a merciless iron fist. All sorts of nasty goings-on down here: financial exploitation, sex trafficking, child kidnappings, and so on.”
“Falcon’s nest,” Harry declared, stepping forward. “That’s the password, right? And now Malfoy knows it anyway, so just let us in.”
“Says who?” Draco said as he and Harry got to their feet, and though he knew it was rude, he didn’t regret the words. He was sick of following authority to the ends of the earth, chasing enemies on foreign continents with whom he’d never have crossed wands otherwise. Draco had come to admire and care for Joey as a friend; he didn’t mind traveling hundreds of miles to help her and accompany Harry. But he certainly didn’t want to be taking any more orders. “Our original mission is complete.”
Harry waved away the blunder with one large, sun-dark hand. “Well, I’m always up for a challenge. In any case, I’m glad you came to me directly. Most people would push the work on an assistant who can’t make head or tail of the thing they’re having me sign.” He sounded almost impressed, eyes gazing straight into Draco’s with an X-ray-like quality.
What’s going on? Harry wants to shout. What’s happening? A strange beep echoes through the stillness. He shuts his eyes tight, gripping the blankets as a boy lost in a nightmare.
Obediently, Malfoy bared his forearm, pressing the blade with delicious slowness into his flesh. He winced audibly in pain as a gash opened, crimson liquid flowing from it onto the desk. Blood pooled from the deep wound, its coppery scent drifting through the air.
Harry subconsciously licked his lips, slowly pushing deeper into Malfoy as the Slytherin began to slice himself a second time. The warmth and wetness surrounding his erection, combined with Malfoy’s agonized pants and the sight of blood pouring onto pale flesh…it took all of Harry’s self-control not to pound Malfoy mercilessly right then and there. Instead, he moved back and forth at a steady, unhurried pace, wanting to make the satisfaction last as long as possible.
Under cover of the chatter and downing of butterbeer, Draco quietly excused himself and slipped away towards the house. Harry didn’t realize he was gone until a few minutes later and flinched at the realization of his friend’s absence. Looking up, he saw the light glowing from behind drawn curtains on the seventh floor. A silhouette moved restlessly beyond it, pacing.
“I’m not at liberty to say.” Draco nearly laughed at Harry’s serious face, but he smothered the smile at these words and elbowed him.
“Mm.” Draco’s gaze had returned to his book, a slim, green-jacketed volume. His left hand drifted downwards, and his fingers wove themselves through Harry’s raven locks, casually, as if he’d been doing it for years.
“Isn’t he magnificent?” Draco said softly. Harry looked at him curiously. Draco’s face wore a peaceful, content expression that Harry felt suited him much better than his signature scowl.
Harry didn’t blink, certain he’d seen a slight puff of something smoky… “Nothing.” Draco said frustratedly.
“Enough with the pleasantries,” Draco said, holding out his hand, and the witch shook it firmly. “I’m glad you’re here today, Marisa.”
He felt panicked, helpless, but another part, buried deep inside him like a spire of dark rock, felt victorious. The Boy Who Lived was dead.
Harry stepped closer to Draco, wanting to offer some comfort but having no idea how. “What’s up, Malfoy?” Harry said quietly.
Treachery and paranoia came creeping into Harry’s mind, and he tried to replace them with school-related thoughts instead, leaving to peruse the bookshelves. Jealousy would get him nowhere, he knew, and he couldn’t read Hermione’s mind either. All Harry could do was wait.
Joey grit her teeth in anger, scanning the trees, but before she could decide where Rabbit had gone, a familiar shout ruptured her focus.
“Parkinson,” Draco said in a resentful tone. “Hello, Henrietta,” He said, slightly less threateningly.
“Sorry we’re late,” Draco added, surreptitiously adjusting his robes to make sure his left arm was thoroughly covered. “Something came up.”
Harry thought, but the idea of admitting such a thing embarrassed him, and he pushed it away. “Potter, you’ve seriously got sixteen questions left? We may be here a while.” The Slytherin reached across the table to grab his companion’s notes, and Harry caught the faint scent of gardenias.
Harry considered this. “That works for some people, I guess. I’ve always been fine with having just Ron and Hermione to talk to.” He frowned. “Until now. But I’m friends with Dean and Seamus, and I write to Neville.”
Thunder rumbled over their heads as Harry let the charm dissolve, and Dahlia came into view. Her hair, grown to her shoulders, dripped with water, and bore teal streaks that matched her T-shirt. Her arms trembled as she leaned against a tree, her shoulders sagging, brown eyes dull with exhaustion, but her smile was unfailing.
“You look so pretty, darling,” Luna cooed, pressing a kiss to Ginny’s lips. She turned to the others, smiling dreamily. “You all, too.”
Joey returned after a few minutes, her usually placid features contorted with a grimace. The basin sloshed with something truly acrid and foul. Ray, however, did not flinch as he took it and the empty vial. He swirled the bowl, raising an eyebrow at its contents. “Anyone want to look?”
They pass a Chanel store, and Draco slows in front of a mannequin dressed in a crisp, masculine, black-and-white ensemble, complete with gold accents and a cross-stitched blazer. His lover thus distracted, Harry falls in the middle of the street, knees to concrete, head in his hands.
“Shut your mouth,” Harry said suddenly, and before either Dahlia or Draco could stop him, he stood up, glaring at Pansy. “Shut your
He almost said but held his tongue. Harry knew how Draco felt about public displays of affection - Merlin forbid he say something so sentimental, even in front of only Luna and Ginny.
“Murtlap essence, I know,” Draco finished. “Merlin, Potter, you sound like someone’s mother. I’ve had my fair share of injuries. This isn’t my first run-in with…” He stopped short, guilt flitting over his face.
Before they could return the greeting, the Healer standing nearby raised a hand of warning. “Don’t touch her,” The brown-eyed wizard commanded. “I’ll be back in half an hour to continue the healing process.” He swept from the room, leaving the three young Aurors alone.
“We’re not leaving without you,” Harry told her, and when she opened her mouth, added, “Please don’t argue with me.”
Shall we get a move on, then?" Arthur stood from his chair, and his family followed suit. George pushed in his chair slowly, a blank yet devastated look on his face.
The car spins and smashes against the guard rail with a screaming cacophony of metal and shattered glass. Harry’s head is yanked to the side; he remembers the pain in his neck first, and the smell of smoke second.
The ropes suddenly drop from Draco’s body, and he leaps out of the armchair immediately, spinning around to see who stands behind it. There is no one. Lucius laughs, high and cold, for a minute sounding like Voldemort himself.
Much had changed in three weeks. That was the hazy reflection drifting through Harry’s mind when he flopped upon his bed, his head aching, and his muscles tense. He didn’t remember falling asleep.
And yet, she still couldn’t shake it. The taste of blood in her mouth. The shattered purple eyes of the tiger-masked witch. A broken figure in the grass.
“That would defeat the purpose,” Hermione said soothingly - easy for her to say since she was winning by three pairs. “Wait a moment…Yes! A four, I win!” She cried, much to the dismay of her friends. “Shall we play again?”
Draco sees all this and takes Harry’s face in his hands. “That was your first mistake, Harry. You thought I was some magical elfin boy who’d fill in all your holes and fix all your problems. I
“It’s fine.” Her frosty voice contrasted sharply against the summer air as they moved outside. “Goodbye.” Joey turned and left without another word, leaving Harry distressed in front of the café window.
A wand flew handle over tip through the rain, and Harry caught it. Magic hummed through his body, crackling like electricity, and he grinned as the rain turned to steam around him.
into becoming a Death Eater!” Harry protested. Though Draco hadn’t explicitly told him so, he had undoubtedly insinuated as much. “It’s not his fault.”
“Please…” The woman begged, and her voice was the voice of many, each soul inside her speaking over the others. “
Joey had been traveling with Harry and Draco for scarcely a month, but she could tell how much they depended on each other; their lives were linked. Joey knew such a connection wasn’t possible, but she had the eerie feeling that if one of the couple died, the other would go with them. Joey almost wished she could feel that way about someone. Perhaps the strength between loved ones was merely disguised as weakness.
Harry peered cautiously around the tree. A table, its sides uneven and its legs seemingly fashioned from driftwood, held a small array of objects that Harry couldn’t discern.
Before they could move to the exit, an unseen force yanked Joey back onto the dirt. Draco and Harry spun around, wands up.
sounded behind him. Draco spun around immediately, wand outstretched, and came face to face with Harry Potter.
Deciding that simply hearing his enemy suffer was not enough, Harry suddenly pulled out of Malfoy, making him hiss in displeasure. With insistent hands, Harry turned Malfoy over onto his back, to the Slytherin’s surprise.
But when he reached the window, all the tension faded from Draco’s body. Dazzling, colorful patterns and wheels of light rocketed into the sky, the dying sparks falling towards the city below. The streets were filled with people, tiny and doll-like below them, necks craning, and mouths open in awe as they watched the show. The cold ribbon of the Thames in the distance glittered in the light, and it looked like as if it was filled with gems.
Dahlia crumpled the page in her hand. The empty chamber filled with the sound of her weeping as the memory dissolved into silver.
“I just left my paper,” Harry said, pointing. Feeling awkward, he rushed to his desk, grabbed the application, and turned to leave.
“Wait here,” She muttered and was glad to find that Harry and Draco nodded without a word of protest. Joey casually walked over to the man, stopping just within earshot, and pretended to watch the sun as it brushed the tops of the palm trees dotting the park.
“You’re wrong,” Draco said, and it gave him great satisfaction to know that he wasn’t lying. “Yes, I’m training to be an Auror. So what?”
“Do you see the Dark Lord here?” Lucius spits angrily. “Don’t doubt me, Rodolphus.” He stalks toward his son, who struggles in earnest.
Theo seemed happy, and Draco was glad for him, despite him rather obnoxiously flashing his diamond-set engagement ring every ten seconds. “Ever thought about moving so you and Harry can get married?” Theo had asked, arm draped over Cameron’s broad shoulders. Harry himself eyed Draco, attentive for an answer.
Dahlia gave a sigh of relief. “Thank you.” She gripped her wand tight, knuckles paling. “Follow my lead.”
“It’s entirely possible,” Ron said firmly, but a seed of doubt had already been planted in his mind, and there was no digging it out.
Then Joey heard something through the rain pounding the pavement. A tinny whispering, malicious and beckoning, emitting from the amulet.
As he and the witch talked, Draco carefully leaned forward, keeping the Cloak draped over himself. He examined the mask, though his heart raced while doing so - the serpent’s fangs and flared hood were all too realistic, despite being adorned with patterned spirals, dots, thorns, and curling leaves. He looked through the holes as well, getting a closer look into the witch’s violet eyes. They seemed unfocused, wild, but her demeanor and voice were anything but insane.
“All right.” Harry muttered something to Draco, who nodded and pulled out his wand. Now that they were out of Vietnam, they could use as much magic as they pleased, including a translation spell that Draco had only just perfected. He touched the tip of his wand to Harry’s throat, performed the spell, and Harry stood, making his way to the front of the car so he could speak to the driver.
The stray thread dangling pathetically, Harry stands, following Draco to the closet. “Why are you being so - so pissy at me?”
Draco looked up when Harry spoke, and he seemed to notice the stray gazes. “Shove off, Potter,” He said, loud enough for the surrounding students to hear, “I’m trying to work.” Draco’s sneer was very convincing, but Harry saw his silver eyes flit towards the boys’ dormitory.
An old woman knelt wearily, hands bound by heavy, enchanted chains. Her head was bowed, but the sound of her pained groans and shallow breaths was loud enough for the other two to notice.
“No, no, feel free to rub it in,” Cass said flippantly, but she didn’t seem angry. “You won, I lost. We’ll see who’s playing for England in ten years.”
Harry stood frozen, suddenly wishing he had paid attention, as the rest of the players split up. Luckily, Ginny gestured for him to stand with her.
“Yes.” Harry closed his eyes for a moment, wishing she’d leave him alone. He didn’t need anyone fretting over him right now. He needed the wind in his hair, cold fingers around a broomstick, low-hanging clouds cooling his face as he squinted for the Snitch. Anything to distract him from his life on the ground.
Harry turned red at this; even Luna and Draco looked a bit flustered. “Okay, yes, I’m bisexual,” He confessed, “And they don’t know.”
Crimson flowers bloom on white tile. Harry doesn’t cry, doesn’t gasp, only stands open-mouthed over his own blood. His mind, leached of dopamine, carries him to such delirium that he laughs in surprise. Who knew kitchen knives could be that sharp?
“Cool,” Harry breathed, grinning at the setting they had created. He’d never done anything like this before, and guessed Draco hadn’t either - Luna and Hermione were better at the beautiful, subtle works of magic.
A moment later, gravel crunches beneath his feet. The chilly November breeze rustles the live oak trees that grow on either side of the walkway. In their branches, the ghostly figures of white peacocks flutter at the appearance of their master’s son.
Draco hung back, hands in his pockets. Harry turned and looked askance at him; the Slytherin’s silver eyes wandered about the ground in thought.
A friendly, warm atmosphere settled over the eight students as they relaxed in the golden candlelight. Utensils scraped quietly against plates as they passed around food, waiting for Draco to begin. He took a moment to think, pale fingers thoughtfully tracing the rim of his goblet. When he spoke, his silver eyes were focused on the people around him, no longer dipping to the table in hesitation.
As the phone clicks off, Padma takes a moment to breathe, expelling the last of her sleepiness from her lungs. She has a long night ahead of her.
“I don’t know,” Harry murmured, confused, and frustrated with himself. All he knew was that Draco’s hair always smelled inexplicably of gardenias, and he liked wearing his gloves, and he had grown to appreciate his cutting wit. All he knew was that their lips lingered only a few heavenly millimeters apart, a gap that could be closed by one desperate push-
“Hey. Look at me,” Harry said softly, and Draco did, hesitantly. “Everything’s going to be fine, Malfoy.” He repeated the statement like a mantra, trying just as hard to convince himself as his friend. “Everything’s going to be fine.”
“No.” Luna shook her head, made the butterfly dissipate, and pointed down the corridor. “A door,” She repeated, eyes alight with intrigue.
Ron was the first to break their stunned silence. “‘Thank you, Granger’?” He repeated. “Harry, did you hex Malfoy or something? I’ve never heard him sound so nice. Or smart.”
He registered a tightness around his forearm, as if the Dark Mark’s snake was choking his hand. Draco didn’t dare to roll up his sleeve, afraid of what he’d find.
“The moment he recognized me,” Narcissa stated, without a hint of bitterness. “It was somewhat of an accident. But he was chained, so I wouldn’t get hurt.”
A young girl screamed, and panic ensued. Some students rushed for the window, while others ran for their dormitories. Younger kids looked wildly around, tugging at the sleeves of their peers in confusion. Older students who had seen battle before either pulled out their wands or shivered in apprehension.
It was this sentiment that surrounded Harry like the light of a loyal phoenix, and he basked in its glow until Ron and Hermione broke away, the latter’s cheeks unabashedly streaked with tears and the former looking at the ceiling.
“But maybe I didn’t listen to you either,” Draco admits. He’s already on the porch steps of the old beach house. It stands in dark blue and white, unwavering, hollow.
“Couldn’t find the liquor cabinet,” Pansy says with a shrug, and takes a swig with as much swagger as the glass’s shape will allow. “Yet.”
Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter have both been my comfort characters for years now, so exploring them in depth has been a source of joy for me. I picked apart Draco’s guilt and insecurities, explored the extent of Harry’s compassion and tendency to temper, and had a lot of fun doing it. I won’t lie; it’s a hell of a lot easier using characters that I didn’t create originally - I didn’t have to try terribly hard to flesh them out, which left me more room to describe their relationship and the world around them.
Draco furrowed his brow and touched the tip of his wand to the water. He muttered something softly, and mini waves began to roll across the surface.
I'll be honest, this chapter is a bit sloppier than usual. And confusing - though the haziness is quite deliberate. These scenes once again delve deep into the characters themselves, but this chapter is also heavy with important plot events and certain turning points. The story will only escalate from here...
"Well, probably." Hermione's expression changed to doubt, but it passed quickly. "Just because Voldemort is dead doesn't mean his supporters are!"
“That’s wonderful,” Luna said as the pair of them began to walk back to the castle. “Nice to see you, Harry.”
Ron immediately dropped his miming hand, looking mortified. The smirk playing across Draco’s face made it clear that he knew what they were discussing, and Harry’s face burned as if a dragon had spewed flames on it.
The chapel usually gave Harry peace. The sunlight streaming through the tall, stained glass windows cast patterns along the black-and-white floor - sapphire oceans and skies, bright red and violet clothes, skin in shades of yellow, peach, and brown. Harry walked among the reverent whispers of other visitors and stopped before a depiction of Jesus Christ, his head, crowned with thorns, bent against the effort of carrying the cross.
Crabbe’s Killing Curse misses Hermione Granger only by a few feet, and Draco spots the furious look on Potter’s face. He sees for himself the raw, unwavering loyalty that Potter has for his friends, and it’s that same loyalty that moves his wand to send a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe’s head.
Draco posing in front of the Eiffel Tower, leaning against a maple tree, catching snowflakes on his tongue. Pictures of them together, in Ashfell, in Paris, in the towns around England. An amateur charcoal etching of him, only barely capturing his likeness. Polaroids in a green box, of the hidden Draco, dressed in lace, smirking, face half-buried in the sheets. A single photo of the Draco Harry knew in high school, high ponytail pulled back from a disgruntled expression.
“Time out, time out,” Ginny said after a while. Breathless, she collapsed onto the ground. The other six knelt down as well, warm and panting.
"It's possible." Harry adjusted his glasses, then remembered something Draco had said to him at the funeral. "Malfoy told me that he's better with written words. He said, basically, that he speaks without thinking, but writing letters conveys his thoughts better."
Harry wondered, hardly believing that a Malfoy, of all people, truly wanted to have a civil relationship with him.
Then Rabbit’s head turned so quickly that Joey’s curiosity got the better of her, and she followed their gaze. A figure in red robes was sprawled on the ground, surrounded by Harry, Draco, and a colorfully dressed witch Joey didn’t recognize. A gentle white light seeped from beneath the red figure’s mask, spilling smoothly through the grass, its tendrils unfurling like mist. The sound of a hundred people sighing in unison echoed through the clearing, raising goosebumps on Joey’s arms.
“Shall we go, then?” Ginny asked, nearly bouncing with excitement. She wore black trousers and a tie over a deep plum shirt whose rolled-up sleeves drew attention to the gold bracelet winding up her arm. Her makeup was light, face framed by a few stray hairs escaping from an elaborate bun. The colors and style reminded Harry a bit of the Weasley twins’ Wheezes uniform - the grin she wore mirrored Fred’s exactly, and he felt so spooked that he was grateful to look away for a moment as they headed for the stairs.
For the rest of the day, Draco seemed to be determined not to be alone in the same room as Harry. The rest of the students invited him to participate in their various pastimes, and he accepted but was careful not to sit too close to Harry. And when Mrs. Weasley asked for help in the kitchen, Draco practically leaped to assist her, despite never cooking a meal by himself in his life.
Harry’s balls slapped obscenely against Draco’s ass - he felt ridiculously exposed up here, where anyone could see them. And yet he loved it, the indecency of Harry showing all of London just how hard he could fuck. Draco panted in sync with the quick pace, dick twitching in pleasure and asshole clenching around Harry’s meaty prick, feeling his pre-cum mix with the cool lube inside him.
“Should we be looking for something specific?” Harry asked no one in particular. The Aurors had hit the pavement once again, surrounded by the glowing neon of the city and the dim starlight above it.
Draco looked surprised at Harry’s reaction for a moment, but his pale face took on an expression of resignation. “I don’t mind doing it, Potter. Well, I
Draco’s breathing suddenly seemed much too shallow. He slowed near a fountain of gray stone, deep green water rippling as a spray showered the pool beneath.
“Dr. Patil! Thank God.” Justin’s voice, young and frantic, spills through the phone in a rush. “We’ve - well
Harry caught Draco’s eye. He shook his head by a fraction of a degree, and Harry took his expression to mean:
“Good morning, Hermione,” She said casually as if greeting a friend. “Something I can help you with?”
“So many questions,” Dr. Patil laughs. She seems more at ease in the cozy apartment, smiling more, letting her hair down so it rests in thick, dark waves down her back. “I thought I’ve told you the answer to that one already.”
“Man, I told you this guy was an asshole,” Ron says, shaking his head, and Hermione shoots him a glare.
” She smiled when she spotted her friends but didn’t stop singing until they had reached her. “Good afternoon.”
“You all right, love?” Harry murmured, his lips brushing against Draco’s knuckles. Cocky, insufferable, adorable bastard. He knew that drove Draco mad.
Draco needs only to touch the wrought-iron gate for it to dissipate into smoke; it senses pure Malfoy blood and lets him through. In front of him, the trunks are losing their invisibility and becoming worryingly opaque once more. But before Draco can redo the charm, the door to the manor opens. The foyer inside yawns darkly, moonlight stopping abruptly at the threshold. Draco lets the trunks drop to the ground and readies his wand, but before he can say a thing, an unseen but powerful force drags his body into the umbrage of the house.
Draco pushed the hanger away as Theodore tried to hold it up to him. “Why are you really here, Theo?”
Instead of answering, Draco leaned down and kissed him. Harry could taste the fear and desperation on his lips, and he pulled him closer, taking his pain away and making it his own. Draco pulled away a bare centimeter, mouth brushing Harry’s as he murmured, “This would make a good memory.” Harry opened his eyes to see Draco, unsmiling, but with something like hope, or yearning, in his gaze.
The shop expanded on the inside, its lavish velvet walkways and high ceilings contrasting with its polished but innocuous appearance from the street. On one side were aisles of dress robes, silk, embroidered, with rhinestones, with ruffles, or lace. The other side held clothes styled like Muggle outfits, mostly dresses, but with a few suits and tuxedos that were light enough to accommodate a robe on top. Draco had seen far more impressive boutiques in London, of course, but the shop was still as high-end as he remembered it.
Harry sniffles as he soothes the cuts with a damp bathroom towel. “Fine, then. Deeper.” He doesn’t touch Draco this time as he sinks further into the tarpit.
Harry doesn’t miss the implication. “You’re not giving up on…” He gestures like a drowning man. “This?”
Their footsteps echoed on the stone floors as they headed to the lift. The first floor held only a few offices and sleeping quarters for the guards, but Draco could hear the prisoners’ muffled cries over the clatter of the lift grate as they ascended.
“All right, then,” Mrs. Weasley held out a cracked flowerpot filled with glittery green powder. “Ron, you first.”
“Nah, they alternate getting caught and do it in intervals,” Ron replies, plucking a jazzie from her palm, and pops it into his mouth.
“I trust you to do what’s right,” Harry replied. “If you do leave the force, I can’t help you. But if you need a way back home….” He tapped his chest and smiled, and Joey’s hand went to the vial hanging beneath her shirt.
“Your promotion.” The lines on his pale forehead grow deeper, and Draco rubs his temple. “Oh. That. Yes, sorry, I forgot.”
Hermione and Ron kept rapt attention throughout Draco’s story. When he finished, they took a minute to process it all, eyes cast towards the table in thought.
“No problem,” Owen nodded at the others, who shifted around to make room. Padma and Gavin exchanged a knowing glance that Harry couldn’t quite decipher, but he wasn’t sure he liked it. “Um, you both know Gavin and Padma. But I don’t believe you’ve met Erin and Oliver?”
Her eyes shone with love, loyalty. Her hand reached out as if to curl around Dao’s wrist, but Dahlia couldn’t do it. Joey blushed, suddenly feeling like she was seeing and hearing something that ought not to be witnessed.
Despite the person's instructions, Harry felt his lungs expand with fear. He removed his wand from his pocket and gripped it tightly. The voice was as familiar as his own.
The first day was spent in tense silence. The tourists explored the ferry, and Draco followed their example with much less gusto. There was a dining hall and kitchen, about ten rooms, and a diving board off the back of the ship that, according to the captain’s intercom, would be in use when they stopped in the turquoise shallows near the coast of Vietnam. Intermittently, during his pacing, Draco met Harry, who blended in much better with the vacationers. But Draco followed his nervous fidgets and moving eyes – he was restless. They all were.
“You’re…giving it to me?” Harry asked. Rabbit nodded as they walked to the other side of the fountain, the water distorting part of their face. “Why?”
“I don’t think you’re narcissistic.” Harry keeps his eyes firmly on the road this time, but he can feel Draco looking at him in the glass.
The whispers refused to cease. Every time Harry walked into a classroom, studied in the library, or went anywhere with other students, he heard them talking. Their speculations, abuse, and surreptitious catcalling hung over Harry like a storm cloud. He did his best to ignore it; and he should be glad, he told himself, that he was the Chosen One. The fact that Harry had saved the wizarding world seemed to stop most people from outright insulting him.
The rest of the period would have been a perfect time to talk with Draco if they hadn’t been part of the chaos along with their classmates. As it turned out, Welsh Burrowing Roots had a nasty habit of lashing out with their thin ends at anyone who came close. The students had to work together, holding the various extensions of the plant, so the cutter didn’t get slapped. Still, the faces of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco were covered in thin red marks and splatters of dirt by the time the bell rang.
“What in Merlin’s name have we gotten ourselves into?” Draco asked, quietly so that Melocotones could not hear. He looked as if he was about to be sick. Draco slipped a vial from his pocket, opened the top, and took a quick sniff. He passed it to Harry, who did the same and handed it off to Joey.
“Luna’s observant,” Ginny said simply. “And to be honest, once she told me, it made sense. I can see it in the way you guys act around each other.”
“Horace is as misinformed about Draco as I am, Harry,” Professor Dahlia said regrettably. “Wherever Draco was heading, he covered his tracks well. You three may go.”
Draco looked at Harry and Joey to see how they were taking the news. Their faces were grim but set with acceptance.
“Not my business,” Draco muttered as he finished, then draped Joey’s torn clothes back over her as best he could. He couldn’t think of a single reason Joey would pretend to be a woman -
“I'm sorry it took this long to find a cure.” Joey’s gaze fixed upon the ground. “I don’t know how I let this happen.”
“Just because I couldn’t string a sentence together doesn’t mean I don’t have eyes, idiot boy,” Lucius snarled. “I certainly would have said something to that meek, poor excuse for a man when he came in here if I could.”
For years, Harry had held onto a dream, one that had faded nearly to tatters. In the English countryside, a cottage was filled with children tumbling through the garden, getting their new wands, and playing Quidditch in the backyard. Children that would have a childhood far better than his ever was. He would make sure of it.
Draco inhaled and exhaled. He pointed his wand into the air, eyes fixated on some imaginary, high-up spot, as if gazing at a star-filled sky. “
Blossoms colored in orange, yellow, and pink erupted in two-dimensional splendor on the surface of the potion. Draco slipped on a pair of dragon gloves and held the cauldron’s sides, swirling the liquid as quickly as he dared. It was today’s fourth attempt at perfecting the Confidence Draught, a subtle yet effective potion that rendered the user proud of their accomplishments and trusting in themself. At least, that’s what Draco hoped it would do. He wafted the golden-colored steam towards him, sniffing it cautiously. A hint of cloves…
Justin clears his throat, and Padma realizes that she’d been staring at Luna, at the curve of her jaw, her worried hands. “Thanks a million for your help, Doctor,” He says.
“World history first.” Harry winces with sympathy. “I had Trelawney last year for Western Civ, she’s a nightmare.”
The night after the Quidditch game, Harry and Draco went to the Owlery together to send their Auror applications. Athena was more than up to the task of carrying two thick envelopes to London, especially when Harry offered her a strip of crispy bacon. She snapped the morsel up, hooted appreciatively, and swooped off the ledge, gray wings fading into the starlit dark. Draco watched her go with a blank expression, as if resigning himself to his forced future. Harry didn’t have to ask if he was happy at this moment; he knew the answer already.

All around the lake, students followed her example. Hermione helped Ron with Fred’s picture and Harry with Draco’s photo of Crabbe. Henrietta leaned over the edge and attached flowers to both. Pinpricks of light pierced the fog, glowing between the boats, and the lake’s surface grew bright and shimmery as fifty lanterns were set upon it. McGonagall made a large sweeping motion with her wand, and they all began to drift away, lighting up the darkness beyond.
Ron patted his robe pockets meaningfully. “Nah, I’m clean. ‘Sides, Fred always said spiking drinks was the laziest kind of prank.” He recalled his brother fondly, pressing ahead of the sadness that lingered behind his name. “It’s easy to have fun without alcohol.”
Hagrid seemed to soften. “If you trust him, Harry, I might as well. I see a lot has changed since I left. Make yerselves comfortable, I’ll brew us a cuppa.” He lumbered towards the cupboard, retrieving three floral-patterned mugs as Harry and Draco draped their wet cloaks over the kitchen chairs. “An’ she’s not mine,” Hagrid added as he rummaged for tea leaves, “Found her in the Forbidden Forest, little creature seemed lost. She’s young, for an owl.”
“I think I’m going to ask Ray more about those amulets,” Joey said loudly, standing up. Her eyes were glued to the ceiling.
Many of the students immediately burst into applause. “That was so cool, Professor!” Parvati cried in awe. Even Anaya Rosier, a Slytherin who regularly wore a permanent scowl, looked impressed.
A figure shuffled forward from the shadows of the bedroom. “It’s so dark in here,” The hidden person muttered, and with a snap of their fingers, the lights came on.
“I agree,” Antigone said, puzzled at Draco’s intense gaze, and Joey could admit she was confused too. Draco turned the look on Harry, who only sighed and wiped futilely at his damp cheeks. Joey felt that she was missing something again; her partners seemed to have an infinite number of secrets they shared only with each other.
Something in those eyes has melted, like silver over a blue-hot flame. “Please leave me alone,” Malfoy mutters, and takes the steps two at a time, vanishing at the top before Harry can gather his wits.
Two years ago, on New Year’s Eve, Draco had stayed with Harry and his friends at the Grangers’. It was the first time he’d ever been in a Muggle home and seen a movie. Harry had patiently fiddled with the telly for hours on end, showing Draco all its features, like pause and play, rewind and fast-forward. Draco had especially enjoyed watching
“Stay with me,” Harry murmurs, and Draco takes his hand as the house creaks and groans around them. “What about…”
“Are the dreams getting worse?” Hermione asked softly. Ever since the Battle of Hogwarts, the whole Trio had shared nightmares of their friends and family, their minds forever imprinted by the trauma of the war they had been through.
“You think this was his plan all along?” Ron asked doubtfully; the pair seemed to be having a conversation that excluded Harry, who wasn’t sure which “he” they referred to. “Did he think he could pull it off from the beginning?”
Without a second thought, the Chosen One flew right back to Draco’s side as Madam Pomfrey hurried towards them. Slytherin’s Seeker sat up with difficulty, wincing and groaning, his left hand curled into a white-knuckled fist. None of his limbs bent at an abnormal angle, but Harry had been injured enough times to tell from Draco’s reaction that he was severely hurt.
Draco thought when he saw that the attacker was masked up to their onyx-colored eyes. But they were dressed entirely in black and unencumbered by flowing robes. The stranger made a gripping gesture, and Joey was dragged upright, struggling against the magic, reaching for her weapon in slow-motion.
Little skirmishes broke out near them once or twice, but Anubis hardly intervened; the other Aurors had it handled, bringing down the less experienced Sin Pax members or leading groups of huddled civilians towards the exit.
As you can likely tell, I went in a decidedly different direction from previous chapters. I wanted to provide a glimpse into Draco's character and motivations. I know some of you were asking where Draco was in chapter eight, so here's your answer!
“A bone-strengthening potion as soon as possible, Professor,” Madam Pomfrey replied, helping Draco to stand. “That and a good night’s sleep will do fine. There are too many delicate fractures for a spell to fix.”
he thought. But Draco’s robes were soft and warm and freshly laundered, and his shoulders rose and fell slightly with every breath, with a rhythm akin to a gently rocking boat…
“I didn’t mean to snap at you,” Draco continued, and the melting silver in his gaze turned hard again. “I apologize.” His voice was monotone. “I’m just nervous.”
“We were just talking about our favorite memories with him,” Cassandra told Harry. “D’you want to share yours?”
Draco meandered to a rack of dress shirts, shoving his hands in his pockets to discourage the childish urge to run his hands over the cloth. As a kid, he used to do that, back when he thought all the world was in his grasp.
“This all matches what I heard at Hogwarts. Some people from the Following came to our school,” Harry told Ray. “A few attacked. One of them talked to me on the train, asking me to join their cause; she seemed to be their leader.” Harry paused, a realization crossing his face. Draco suspected what he was thinking.
Harry doesn’t hear the rest. Darling, darling, darling. Draco used to call me that. The sounds of the café fade away, a loud ringing in his ears. He watches as Draco, his boyfriend, his lover, his bright-eyed angel, takes this young girl by the waist to greet her.
Narcissa gave her son a sharp look. “Don’t cry,” She commanded, and immediately Draco blinked away his tears. It had been so long since he’d been with his family that he’d forgotten how condemning they were of weakness. “Your father will get better,” She said, though she didn’t sound confident. “When he got here, he didn’t know his name. But he’s remembering his past, slowly but surely.”
“I’m fine with that,” Harry said with a smirk, kissing Draco’s cheek. Draco made a face and shoved him away, with much less force than he was capable of. “Come on. What if I got you tiramisu?”
“Good afternoon, what can I get for you?” Draco flashes a smile – Harry feels like he’s been punched in the stomach. Draco’s upbeat tone, his manufactured positivity, is a mask he wears at his job. But not with Harry. Never with Harry.
Draco shrugged in a defeated sort of way. “I suppose so.” He shifted over on the rock and, after a moment’s hesitation, patted the spot next to him. “Sit with me.”
“Cleaning the coops?” Ginny wrinkled her nose, turning to her brother and his girlfriend. “That’s a three-person job, we’ll start with that.”
It was only when Draco pulled back slightly that Harry opened his eyes and was jolted back into the present. His breath warm against Harry’s ear, Draco whispered words so quietly that not even ghosts would overhear.
Chalkdust still drifted from the floor near the front of the classroom, implying that a class - likely a chaotic one - had recently left it. Potter draped his school satchel over a chair and casually leaned against the adjacent desk. Draco carefully placed his own bag on another chair. He remained standing, though his legs shook slightly.
An era was coming to an end. Three years of nose-to-the-grindstone education: exams, domestic missions in the summer, potion experimentation, dueling, fighting, Legilimency…Draco was exhausted in every way. And if the warnings of Commander Antigone, the division’s supervisor, were any indication, his work would only get more challenging.
“However, I do need to know the name of the dunderhead who hit me so I couldn’t catch that damn Snitch.”
The dorms bore little resemblance to the Slytherin accommodations back home, which Draco considered a blessing. He’d grown to love the shimmering green light cast on the stone walls but hadn’t loved the slime.
“No.” The sudden surge of temper Draco had felt subsided, but he snarled, with terrible honesty, “But I still wish you were dead.”
A group of men, led by a shirtless leader painted in silver sprint by, whooping between broken strains of Auld Lang Syne. Draco laughs as they pass. He’s in a good mood tonight, and so is Harry.
“Hey,” Ron said presently, swallowing a bite of a cheese sandwich, “Where’s Malfoy? I haven’t seen him since class yesterday. I thought you might’ve invited him, too, Harry.”
Harry knew every word written on that page - not that he could recite it verbatim, of course. Not when they’d stayed up nearly until sunrise writing it. In fact, he felt sleepy even now, the slight prickliness of the grass beneath him not enough of a deterrent to keep him from slumping. Perhaps he’d better stand up.
