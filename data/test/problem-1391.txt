Harry pauses, biting his lower lip. "I do. A lot." There is a pause. "Do you... do you want to go out with me tonight?"
The flow of the curse had become non-uniform. It remained in the circuit running through him and Malfoy, but now the intensity of it was redirected more towards Malfoy, less towards Harry.
"Close your eyes," Draco said. Harry did, so Draco could wash his hair. "Your relatives...they were fools. They were fools because they couldn't cherish somebody who needed nothing to become good and kind, because that was just what he was."
He was told to stay with Draco in the room, to maintain contact, so he did. So he slid in behind him, settled him back carefully against his chest. So he pushed his fingers between the spaces of Draco's, held the pointed, delicate knuckles of his other hand, firm over Draco's abdomen. He was explaining to this Healer as much of the situation as possible, as much as he could, through the fog overtaking his brain, whilst Draco was being examined.
he was still here, asking Malfoy if he could go when he could just, well,
"It's so beautiful, Harry," she breathed out, reaching for Harry and pulling him into a hug. Harry gripped her back, smiling into her shoulder. She kissed his cheek before she let him go. Ron came next, hugging him tightly, saying with a shite-eating grin, "you're the best best man I could ask for."
like the sort of person to you who would want to
So he continued on painting. Draco had made his way over to the couch, and he was drinking with a sprawl of his arm across the back of the couch. They didn't speak until Harry had almost wholly painted in the face, putting finishing touches on it.
Draco's head lifts at that, looking at him. His throat bobs. "That was to symbolise to myself that I was moving on. That I could."
There came a lapse in silence that came after Draco's response, and Draco was looking at him, their faces a feet apart. There must have been something on Harry's, because he then croaked, "What?"
"Where are your friends, Potter?"
"Yeah. Sorry. I just…I couldn't sleep…"
formerly Regulus' room
Harry's been searching for Draco, down to tracking the connection by the Galleon, only to find it was disintegrated somewhere in Wiltshire.
"No. Let me finish, Harry. So... then I had thought I could make myself not feel anything for you at all, and hate you, and take my life back. Only, that isn't quite how that works and…" Draco's voice trailed off. He was now moving on to soaping Harry's body, his shoulders and chest and back. His voice went quieter as he said, "And you were just so lovely. And good. And I realised, that day I saw how you were with my mother... I realised then that there was no way that I couldn't love you."
Harry raises an eyebrow, amused. "A
Harry stared at Malfoy's face, his blue lips, his half-mast eyes. How sickly he looked. He looked away when he couldn't look at him any longer. The fear pulsed through him, left his throat dry and closed. What if it wasn't enough? He still didn't entirely understand how this bond worked, how complicated it was made by its basis being cemented in things as complex as emotions of all things. And what if this was all out of Harry's hands now? What if it was his fault that Malfoy
beyond
"I'm so sorry," Dudley said, his voice such a rasp it was almost a whisper.
"We all have homework," Neville says, hiccoughs a laugh. "It's alright, Malfoy. You can dither over finishing it off the last few days with the rest of us."
"Maybe we can still fix this." Harry unfolded his arms, rounded the counters, a hand coming to rest on the top as he came to a stop next to him. He was facing ahead of him, Harry facing him, and he must look as desperate as he feels. "Maybe we could do it better this time, and reverse it
"I'd have done great as a heavy metal rockstar, you know, come on," Harry said, grinning at him grinning, just blindly wanting more of it. "Just
Draco lifts his head from his shoulder and quickly takes his face, makes him look at his own, intently. "Because of
alone anywhere?
Harry gripped Malfoy's biceps, hitching him closer, off the cabinets. He was so cold. He grabbed his back, hooked the other arm under the sprawl of his legs, hoisting him up against him and in his arms.
In the evening, he tried to reach Xavier through the international firecall. He couldn't be reached. He tried to breathe through the turmoil of his emotions, to stay calm, but he ended up upending the table and rattling the bar, several bottles shattering to the ground, with the force of an erratic magic and anger. Then he breathed harder, his chest heaving, staring wild-eyed at the mess he'd made.
For the entire silence that followed, Harry didn't look at him, too busy trying to keep that burn in his eyes behind them, blinking hard.
"I thought we were past thinking Malfoy was an evil, scheming git," Ron said, cheek against Hermione's bushy brown hair. She was reading a book while she leaned into his chest.
He tells her after that he needs time to think about it, that there's stuff going on with him, because he doesn't know how to tell her anything. He doesn't know how to tell anyone anything that doesn't hurt. If he hurts Ginny, he hurts Ron, and he hurts everybody else he loves with that. If he doesn't tell them anything, if he doesn't tell her the truth, he hurts Draco.
was what it was all about.
There are nights when Harry takes the coin out again, places it by his lips, and whispers to Draco everything he can't tell him anymore.
something like that. There
"Excuse me," Harry said, just before dinner, thinking about Draco, who would already be done with dinner by now. He would be waiting up for him, as he always did, with a book and a light on. "I have to make a call."
"Don't do it," Harry whispered, temple leaned against Draco's, his voice so quiet that neither of them would have heard it if the wind carried it away, soft and sorrowful and breathless from kisses and desperation. His lungs were burning, the back of his eyes and his throat burning too. His quivering hands took his face gently. "Don't do it. Please."
"What's this one?" Harry asks. He's trying to distract him.
His heart is an odd flutter in his throat, his hands quivering from a jittery emotion, nerves or excitement, he can't quite tell. He's had too many drinks, maybe. He pushes his fists further in his pockets, bemused with himself. "Well, then. Good night."
"I'd like to have a kiss from a good-looking man," Draco said, the corner of his mouth quirking slightly.
"Is there no cure at all, Ezekiel?" Bill was asking. He sounded irritated, but like he was trying to keep himself controlled. "What of the previous records of such a curse?"
"Were you really going to give me over to Voldemort?" Harry asked.
"I'm scared," Harry whispered, before he could stop himself. Draco was looking at him, a bemused furrow between his brows. 'I'm just scared of this. All of it. I'm scared that I'll… I'll fuck something up, or something would go wrong again and this damned curse would
Harry woke up feeling strange, stretched tight at the core.
"He's found some friends," she says. "He's currently staying with them, and seeking help with their aid."
Harry must have heard something similar from his own. "Yeah. Maybe."
Somebody screamed what sounded much like a slur.
Nothing much was said after that. They drank from the same bottle of wine, passing it around between the three of them. Ron's arm was across the cushions of their new couch, long enough to run around Hermione, his fingers brushing over Harry's shoulder.
you know. Sometimes it's still hard to feel it. I know they think of me as a part of them, but it's hard to feel it. Like it's still possible they could… stop... at any point. And it's strange, I know, because they'd gone through a war with me, and they risked their lives for me over and over. They're… they're my family. But they're the only family I've ever had, you know? So I'll always feel what I feel for them, but I'm sort of just an addition. The Weasleys all had each other before me, but I won't have anyone after them, if it, you know, if it ever…"
“It’s good to see you ‘Mione,” Harry mumbled into her neck as she hugged him, “Draco, how’re you?” He smiled.
Draco gasped and his eyes shot up to Harry, “I love it,” he said emphatically, “I absolutely adore it.” He put the cup back gently, and wrapped his arm around Harry tightly. Hermione beamed at Harry, who grinned right back at her. He had done well this year, he was sure of it.
Harry chuckled softly, and smirked at the thought of Malfoy being so damn wise. He nodded and carried on drinking his tea, “Is everything sorted now? Can everything go back to how it was?” he asked.
Draco sat at the desk, marking his student’s homework and tutting to himself in some places. Harry sat by the fire, with his feet on Draco’s armchair opposite and read his copy of the Daily Prophet. It was far quieter here than it was in Harry’s old room off his office, and it was warmer than Draco’s room near the dungeons. There was an ambience here that Harry appreciated. It was quiet, cosy, relaxed and superbly domestic. It was a fairly dark room, but it was the kind of comfortable darkness that envelopes a person and makes them feel safe. The dark blue wallpapered walls made the room feel both personal and just as grand as the rest of the castle. The only sounds that could be heard was Draco’s quill as he marked, Harry’s paper rustling with each page turn and the crackling of the fire. It was so relaxing that Harry feared he may fall asleep and never get anything done here. There was a stillness here that couldn’t be found anywhere else – time seemed to slow down and Harry found it rejuvenating. Draco seemed more at ease here too, his shoulders were less tense, and his brows weren’t furrowed as much. They had settled in quickly, Harry thought, it already felt like they’d been here forever.
He missed him when he wasn’t around.
Malfoy grunted in what Harry assumed was a confirmation so he left to get the drinks. The door creaked shut behind him, and Draco savoured being alone for a second.
“I asked around for pictures,” Draco admitted, “and some of them I may have taken myself without you realising.” Draco flipped to one of the pages and Harry saw a picture from just after they decided to become a couple – Harry was sitting on the edge of the bed, a drink in hand, eyes crinkled and closed, laughing at something Draco had said. Harry cherished it. On the page opposite, was a picture of Draco and Harry walking hand in hand through the autumn leaves of Hogsmeade. Harry looked at it confused – when was this taken? He watched as Draco kissed him on the cheek, and remembered the night vividly. Neville took a deep breath and smiled as Harry looked at him questioningly.
Harry awoke violently once more. A small house elf that he had never seen before stood next to where he lay, eyes wide with shock or fear and removed her hand from Harry’s shoulder – clearly she had shaken him awake.
Ron rolled his eyes, knowing full well that Harry was teasing him, and gazed over the dancefloor, full of writhing, sweaty bodies, and smiled. People from all walks of life danced together, not caring about personal lives for the moment.
Harry cried aloud, and with swift movements, Draco reached around and grasped his cock with one hand, and tangled his hand in Harry’s with the other, pulling his hair hard.
“I made friends with Harry.” He said.
The healer hesitated, “we aren't sure at this point,” he sighed, “I want to be completely honest with you because of who you are… we haven't encountered this curse, and it spreads like wildfire. We’re trying as hard as we can. It would be good for Harry if you could go get some of his things to be around him. We need to change his clothes because there may be residual magic on his uniform that may affect him - hospital gowns aren't nice, even when you're in a coma.”
“Everything okay?” Harry smiled, as he caught Draco looking at him.
Harry swung his legs from his bed and sat on the edge, elbows on his knees, head in his hands. He sobbed quietly as Draco pondered, asked himself what to do - comforting people wasn't his strong suit.
Draco silenced him with a stern look. Pansy’s expression matched that of Blaise, and Harry picked up on something uncommunicated between the two, like they knew something they shouldn’t - perhaps they teased Draco on a regular basis about ‘paradise’.
The bartender poured some shots in front of them both, with a wink aimed at Harry and then once more slunk off.
Harry nodded, wide eyed, “Where have these letters turned up?” he asked. He sipped his coffee, mildly intrigued with the case - he could see why Draco had been so eager to start, it seemed like a paper trail kind of case and he knew how much that would appeal to Malfoy.
Every so often, Draco would look across the room and smile; it made Harry wonder how long it had been since he experienced a true family Christmas – or if he ever had.
Draco walked Harry back to Grimmauld Place, both sharing a packet of sweets and laughing together. Harry had won a significant amount of money, nearly every single one of his bets had placed and he was equal parts surprised and excited. It had been a thrill for him, beyond anything else, to experience this small segment of Draco's life. He wondered if Draco had enjoyed himself as much as he had, and if they were going to have regular dates to wild and unpredictable quidditch matches. He could see it being a fixture of his life with Draco.
Harry considered things, the words ‘complicated’ and ‘run’ came to mind but he couldn’t convince his legs to follow through. He settled on holding his hand out for Malfoy to take. It was almost a reflex, before Harry could even consider the fact that he was going to
Do Harry and Draco have a breakthrough in the case? What will a simple request for coffee turn into?
Harry watched eagerly as Draco took hold of the boxes that he had wrapped. Draco read the tag and then frowned slightly. Harry’s heart thudded in his chest. Hermione and everyone else watched eagerly.
Harry frowned – had he? He thought everything was going great, as normal. He was showing up to classes, and being there for his students.
Draco looked over his shoulder as he draped a shirt over him, “Well, the show’s over now, Potter.” He smiled as he buttoned it up, and fastened his belt over it. He pulled a black suit jacket on and strode over to the desk, pulling a pocket square from under a book. He shrugged and added it to his jacket. Harry shivered slightly when Draco leaned near him to reach what he was looking for. Why did he do that?
He opened it, and sure enough, there were students out of bed, roaming the corridors. He watched students of his run through the stairwells together, probably looking for a place to have a forbidden tryst. He felt a wave of sadness as he thought about his own loneliness, and how it was out of choice. He longed for companionship of some kind – even just a close friend.
“Yes, Ursula?” Harry asked.
Harry approached the mess of clothes at the foot of the bed and began to sort them out. He left more space for Draco in the wardrobe – he was a far flashier dresser than Harry was and he had a feeling that he would demand more space so his suits didn’t crease. Harry simply didn’t care about his own clothes as much. Kreacher returned, with a pair of green curtains suspended in the air in front of him.
“The Cruciatus curse.” Ursula spoke again, albeit hesitantly.
Draco nodded glumly, like everyone else in the world, Nancy was familiar with the relationship between Draco and Potter. Some students from their school year had been quick to cash in on everything after the war and told the media every detail about Potters life – this included his relationship with Draco. Much of it was blown wildly out of proportion but the gist was correct.
Two years after their official first date, what are Draco and Harry up to?
Harry released the snitch and waited for a second or two before flying to the far end of the pitch. Draco took the near side and stared Potter down. He was wearing his school Quidditch robes that had obviously been tailored to fit his bulkier frame. They were emblazoned with the Gryffindor Motif, and POTTER stood out on the back. Draco liked the way they looked, he thought, they fit Harry well.
Harry shrugged, “I imagine there’s someone out there willing to put up with you.” He smiled and started to laugh.
Harry laid there stark naked, his mind blank with post-orgasmic bliss, waiting for his breathing to go back to normal. To say that that was much needed would have been an understatement. He glanced over to Draco, who had fallen beside him, and smiled to himself. He had been expecting something spectacular but that was something else entirely. He basked in the silence for a minute or two, listening to the whoosh of his heartbeat in his ears and the breathing of the naked man next to him and waited for the usual wash of fatigue to come over him.
Harry put the stack of books on his bookshelf and looked to the door. It was Malfoy of all people.
Harry walked from McGonagall’s office feeling satisfied. The meeting had been less of a discipline, and more of a helping hand. Harry had what he needed, and he felt a sense of relief. Harry walked back to his office with a key clutched in his hand. When he got back to his room, Harry picked up his red tea cup.
Draco carried on stroking Harry’s cock as expertly as he knew was possible, and Harry’s hips began to buck into his hand. Draco too began to feel close to his inevitable climax and let out a series of stifled moans as he tried to control himself long enough to finish Harry off.
“Hey… it’s all muscle dear.” Harry slurred sarcastically and sat up. Draco laughed at him, and rolled his eyes slightly. As drunk as he was, he could tell that Draco was more inebriated than he said he was.
He entered his classroom and smiled to himself. He really did love teaching. His classroom was exactly the same as he had left it - though now a large poster of an Acromantula hung on the wall, ready for his fourth years to study from.
“Just in case you're not fully aware,” she looked closely at the woman's name tag, and wiped some tears from her eyes, “Healer Roberts… I’m Hermione Granger, this here is Ron Weasley… we are looking for Harry Potter, and so help you Merlin if you don’t tell us where the hell he is.” She crossed her arms and tapped her foot expectantly. She was used to pushing her weight around at work, and had honed her authority to the highest degree. The healer looked at her for a second and then caved.
Hope y'all enjoy <3
The great hall was mostly empty when Draco got to it, he saw the Headmistress sitting at the front, her cat like features smiling down on the few students that sat around the hall. He wondered if she held a grudge against him for his actions all those years ago? He took a few tentative steps into the hall, ready to walk to the high table. This always put him on edge, he could not help but think that people were watching him - judging him - as he made his way through.
The meal passed in relative silence for Harry, who just appreciated being in this old castle again.
Shit.
Hermione looked flattered and excited as she opened one of the boxes. She inspected the green patterned china and gasped. “It’s beautiful,” she whispered, “Where on earth did you get it?”
“Well, say what you will about Granger,” Draco sat back at his desk with a sigh, “but she’s right. Just because you’re doing better in certain areas of your life, don’t expect that everything will snap back to normal.”
“Who would’ve thought that you would be doing something so noble this time twelve years ago?” Harry remarked.
Draco rolled over, no longer on his back, but facing Harry. His pale skin was flushed, his body languid, eyes half closed. His chest rose and fell with even, deep breaths; he brushed his hair from his face only to find that his arms felt heavy and unresponsive, he doubted he could move right now if he wanted to. Searching for warmth, he pushed himself closer to Harry, who looked like he may be in another dimension entirely, his eyes closed but occasionally fluttering slightly. His pulse was still visible in his neck, and the desire to lick it once more came over Draco. He’d have to refrain until the morning, right now his body couldn’t take more exertion.
“I did tell you that it was all muscle.” He said, breathless with a flirty smile, and kissed him again.
“You know, Ron,” Harry grinned, “I think you’re the only person to get more eloquent when they drink,”
“As far as we can tell, about two hours ago Aurors Potter, Reardon, Callahan, and Franklin were on Emergency duty and were caught in a firefight with a group of dark wizards. Auror Potter was hit with an unknown curse in the shoulder and the effects of it have spread throughout his body. As the curse is unknown, we have Healers from the curse department working on finding a way of stabilising him, and curse breakers are coming in from the Ministry to help. For now, the only way that we can stop the residual effects from the curse spreading even further throughout his body is to put him in a magically induced coma. Before you ask, I can't say how long this is all going to take, but please, please be assured that we are working as hard as we can to get him shipshape again.”
in his own. He found himself running his thumb along Malfoys skin, just to get used to this new feeling. Harry flinched slightly when Malfoy did it back.
Harry and Draco break some tension in the office!
Harry sipped his drink and nodded, “Sure.”
“Well if it isn’t Harry Potter,” his voice was silken and deep, like the rumbling of water over rocks, “I’m a big fan.” he smiled, his silver eyes glinting in the lights of the club. His french accent sent a shiver down Harry's spine. There was something feline about the way he smiled, like he was capable of being dangerous. Harry liked it immensely. The dancer wound his arm around Harry’s shoulders and held him possessively.
He scanned the pages and stopped when he saw Malfoy in his office, pacing back and forth in a manner that reminded him of Dumbledore’s own behaviour. Malfoy was awake too. He toyed with the idea of going to see him purely because he was somebody that was also awake at this hour, but he noticed that there was someone else in the room with him – Esmerelda.
“I didn’t hurt you?”
“Draco…?” Harry said, meaning to ask a question but forgetting what it was.
“Sorry to wake you Mr. Potter,” the house elf smiled slightly at him, “but you were shouting in your sleep sir.”
“Why does it need to be so perfect ‘Mione?” Ron complained, running a hand through his messy ginger hair.
“On your front,” Harry said, his voice cracked, betraying how much he needed Draco in that moment. He let his silk shirt slip from his shoulders, he wanted no restraints for his planned acts.
Draco watched the people in the club with an amused smile on his face seemingly oblivious to his rudeness only moments earlier, “It never ceases to amaze me at the people who come in here,” he commented, not looking at Harry, still scanning the room, “Oh, look… there’s Weasley and Longbottom.” He pointed to them as they walked in, and beckoned for them to come over.
“What?” Ron shook his head, trying to figure out what the hell Draco was on.
“Of course, I’d be delighted!” Harry cried, and sat back down next to Draco; a big grin still on his face.
He unpacked his things and placed the photo album from Draco on his bedside table. He took his new quidditch gear and put it in the bottom of his wardrobe, looking forwards to being able to use it at Hogwarts.
“Good lord Draco, you don’t actually think that do you?” he smiled, “Of course I want you to be with me tonight,” a relieved look crossed Draco’s countenance and he laughed slightly, “Though we’re staying at mine because my room is warmer.”
Afternoon folks! I'm sure you've been waiting for this, so enjoy it! <3
A mischievous smile crept up onto Harry’s face, “Do you fancy a friendly game of Quidditch?”
“I barely see anyone from Hogwarts now,” Malfoy said, “Well, until I got this job, I suppose.” He flashed a smile at Harry.
Harry awoke with a start, sweat dripping down his face and the sound of blood gushing in his ears. His breath caught in his chest and his hands gripped the sheets beneath him. He clenched his eyes shut, keeping in the tears that threatened to spill down his face. He felt a sob rising in his chest but held it in the best he could. He dared to open his eyes and calmed when he saw that he was in his bedroom at Grimmauld Place, not the Forbidden Forest walking to his certain death. He gasped for breath, hoping now to fill his lungs with air to replace the rising feeling of dread that filled him.
“I just wanted to have something for myself, but it’s not like it went well exactly.” Harry answered, thinking that he now had the time to talk to Draco.
Malfoys long fingers worked Harry to a full hardness, something that hadn’t taken long after the shameless display in the club. He was raging, desperate for Draco to just get on with it, he needed to feel something before he burst. Draco, it seemed, was going to tease him until he was aching.
Well... that escalated quickly.
Harry sniggered and put his arm around Draco’s shoulder. Draco chuckled and smiled at her, “I’ll do just that.” He smirked at Harry and shot him a pretend angry glare. She fought against a smirk she turned her attention to Harry.
“I know,” Harry shrugged, “but I also have hands that work just fine,” he smiled slightly as Malfoy rolled his eyes, “Can I help, Malfoy?”
Malfoy followed his gaze, “Are you nervous, Potter?”
“Is it happening again, Master?” His voice, aged and rough as it was, was sympathetic. The relationship between Harry and Kreacher had improved somewhat over the years. Kreacher didn’t mind working for Harry Potter, because he treated him with respect and decency.
The night took a more uplifting turn when Neville arrived. They started chatting about anything and everything – predicting Quidditch scores for the World Cup final, making bets on which teacher would arrive still drunk the morning after the match. They even touched on how long they thought it would take Hermione to become the Minister. The drinks flowed, rather too quickly for a Thursday night. They even played drinking games, forgetting their reality for just a night.
Harry didn’t want to admit that being praised by Malfoy of all people gave him a light fluttery feeling in his chest, so he tried to convince himself that it was just the shot that the barman had given him. He started to relax into Malfoys arms, and they began to dance in earnest.
Draco complied, laying on the bed with one leg bent, raising his backside into the air slightly. If Harry had a camera, he’d want to snap a million pictures, but he didn’t so he did the next best thing: he joined Draco. He needed to taste him, to devour him like Draco had devoured him. He held Dracos cheeks, spreading them apart to look at his reward. It was glorious. He buried his face, and fully intended to take Draco to pieces. He worked his tongue into and around his hole, getting him ready for the headline act.
Draco looked behind him, and Harry had indeed shown up. She must have invited him to join them. He wondered just how awkward this would be as he hadn’t spoken to Harry and had actively avoided him.
"That
"I'm not. I won't," Harry says, quickly, sincerely. "Never again. Draco, I... I told them all, after you left. I told them about how I felt for you." He pauses, hesitating, looking down at their hands. He breathes. "I did something stupid before that. Got together with Gin, trying to move on from you. But I quickly realised how shitty it was, and she was obviously upset, and
Harry was surprised at the lack of argument, at the ease and lack of concern he'd accepted this with. Then, he thought that perhaps he shouldn't have been so surprised. There wasn't a lot Malfoy could do when he wasn't the one with the upper hand in this situation, not anything that would prove why he did not want any associations with the Malfoys.
He didn't recognise it at first. He only connected the voice to a face when he turned, saw who it was.
He wonders if he's ever going to not think of him. If he's going to spend all his life trying not to now.
Draco may struggle to tell dreams apart from reality, but he knows well the fine line between them.
Now they show up on mornings at each other's door. Sometimes Ron's long gone out to the Great Hall with Hermione, and other times, he's there, stiffly pretending Draco isn't there and vice versa. Draco waits for Harry to get ready, berating him for his tardiness as he leans on his doorway with his arms crossed, watching Harry bustle around, clumsily tie his tie, grab his robes, put his socks and shoes on. On the days Harry isn't late, they walk together to the kitchens, carry their meals to the grounds of Hogwarts, to the ramparts of the castle, to hidden alcoves. On the days when Harry is late, Draco brings him breakfast instead, and he scarfs it all down on the way to class.
in this damned fucking world that makes me feel a damned fucking thing anymore except you! What am I supposed to do?"
"Looked like it was going pretty good this morning," Ron pipes up.
Draco nodded, looked a little flushed. His eyes sort of drifted. Neither of them spoke for a while after that.
"They were the first family I've ever had. Ron and Hermione," Harry says, and isn't sure why he's talking about this. Still, the words leave him, perhaps loosened by his exhaustion, by the comfort that now settles between them at times. Draco knows, though only at a surface-level, of his history with the Dursleys, and it makes it just a bit easier to speak of what he does next. "My uncle used to say nobody could ever — " He pauses, trying to substitute with a word that makes it sound less sad and pitiful as
"My magic," Draco said, then, hoarse and thick, and the bottom of Harry's stomach fell out right then and there.
Harry places it back on the trunk, slowly, and falls back against the wall, putting his wrists to his knees, loosely pulled up.
Harry would fall asleep in bed with an unease that was all his own after he'd had sex with Malfoy, his chest knotted up as he wondered if it had been the bond after all, if it had made them do what they'd done in the drawing room, what they kept doing for many mornings and nights after. Harry didn't know what was worse, for it to be all his own, or for it to not be of his own will.
The morning after his odd and inadvertent encounter with Draco, he'd woken up alone and remembered, in a fit of mortification, that he'd fallen asleep right beside him on the Quidditch Pitch. For two days after, Harry adamantly doesn't open the Marauder's Map to look for Draco again. Now he does need to open the map for other things, such as to search for Ron and Hermione, or to see what Ginny's up to, so sometimes his eye inevitably slips and catches sight of the
Ronald, Ginevra and Granger are calling out for Potter, beckoning him over. Ronald pauses and squints oddly when he catches sight of him, turning to Granger. Longbottom's jogging over to them, leaving Thomas and Finnigan behind.
Then Draco was beginning to take control, gaining in speed and ferocity, closing into kisses on Harry's upper lip, his lower lip, the corners, dipping his head to follow the rhythmic movement of their mouths, and Harry, taking every one of them with the force of his own desperation and need, his love and grief. His heart was tightening itself into a thousand, aching knots, all of it like a tender and raw burning in his throat.
"Matty! You shouldn't say that—" Annie is admonishing at the same time, frowning. "Look, you're making Scorp and Mr. Malfoy very upset!"
"Draco?" Harry said, a deep furrow between his hands. He had skirted around the counter quickly to reach him, settling down as he put his folded jacket on the empty space next to him. "Draco, hey. What happened?"
"Hm," Draco said. "I see."
On the other side, under a bright yellow streetlight, somebody was proposing, and the woman was laughing, on the verge of tears. Draco was watching them, all bored and idle, but there was something private in the way he slowly tore his gaze away from them after a long time, back to the water as she pulled her new fiance up into a kiss, putting the whiskey bottle they bought, off-license, to his mouth.
"Do you guys still hate him?"
"S'not like I knew," Harry said, sitting back with his head over the back of the couch. He breathed through the nausea.
* * *
Harry sighs, caving, and he does, telling him about everything and nothing. But his worry nags at him all throughout, the urge to go to him constantly breathing down his neck.
Potter's throat shifts, and he looks like he's trying to reign in his anger, not say something unkind.
But Harry's head is full of him in the dead of nights, when it's no longer as easy to fall sleep because there is no voice on a coin next to his ear, a vivid awareness of his presence on the other side. And the strange, inexplicable comfort at times, of just being with him in silence or amidst words. His head is full of him—the most ridiculously mundane things. That one time he made Draco laugh harder than he ever has, and how carefree and beautiful he'd looked in that moment. The pin-dots at the corners of his lips. His drawings, tucked in a corner of his trunk, that Harry doesn't know why he keeps so carefully. Who he is with Luna, and that he is someone who stays awake into dead of nights to talk with Harry until they're asleep, who does oddly sweet little things like bring him sweets, his favourites in meals, leaves around funny drawings and notes for him, gives him his coat. That he is quiet in his strength and bravery. That Harry thinks often of the way he'd felt when Harry held him; warm, sharp planes of bones softened by skin, and how his hair smells like mint. How lovely he looked, laughing, with his winter hat and coat and scarf.
Draco stopped at that, seemed to have woken fully at that. His mouth was parted slightly, staring at him. Harry realised, only then, what he'd said. Was it too much?
will be…" His eyes were distant, slightly hazed. The jut of his throat shifted, very subtly. "Maybe that will have to be enough."
they loved him, even when they showed so blatantly that they did, it seemed to dry up in a moment of loneliness and doubt, and he was left feeling like the same boy locked inside a cupboard, like he could vanish right there in the dark and nobody would ask.
"Do you," Harry murmured, thinking he shouldn't ask at all, and somehow still went on to, his mind a little too muddled and his inhibitions a little too out of touch with his actions. His voice came slightly slow, slurry, weighted. "Do you wish you could have been with somebody else? Somebody you wanted."
" But the weight in his throat broke him off, his eyes beginning to burn, not quite certain of where the reasons for it ended, if it was really about the way the night had gone. If it was about something much more.
Malfoy insisting to pay the bills like an old-fashioned man with a lover he was on a date with. Check.
Draco shrugs. "What else shall I call myself?"
There was another shift of his head in Harry's peripheral, turning away. "I see." Harry darted a glance at him, and then away. It was nice out here, the night bright and clear, and though not many, the stars were scattered far and wide across the sky.
Harry rolled his eyes. He turned the stove off and grabbed

Here, in their deserted alcove, sitting there with their bags toppling onto each other next to them, he misses that with an almost sickening intensity. All he wants is to ease whatever grief has the boy he loves looking like this, all haunted and tired, his eyes red-rimmed now in a way it hadn't been when his face wasn't half-nestled into the middle of Draco's shirt, his body sprawled between his legs. Potter's fingers are curled loose at the base of his spine, gripping at him.
So, even when Potter is lovely and beautiful, even when Potter kisses him and smiles at him and looks at him like Draco genuinely makes him happy—
Narcissa eyed him, and then said, "I see." She put her cup down. "He seems tired these days. And fairly troubled as well. I only wondered, seeing as you live together, if you might have known something about it."
And they couldn't. Half of the things, they had to save for the next day, because Draco would get so exhausted, even as he would try to push himself through it, or they'd take too long in some places that most of their time and energy would be gone by the end. It seemed Draco was just desperate to experience everything as much as he could, but at the same time, he didn't want to spend too much time not spending it with his mother, with Teddy and Andromeda and Luna.
Draco, in no mood to argue or persuade, doesn't answer her.
The words of denial don't make their way out through his throat going tight, his lips parting ever so slightly, working around an answer that won't come. His heart has begun to batter harder. "It's not…I don't..."
"Why would I?" Harry asked, waiting for the kettle to boil with his hip against the edge of the counter, arms crossed over his chest. He was groggy and tired, which made him just on the edge of irritated at everything and nothing.
"Explain to me, Mother, how you think I'll be safe in a place where I'll be abhorred."
"Of course," Draco said. He put his hand with the camera down to his lap and put his arm around Luna.
When the sight of Draco at the fireplace finally seems to sink in, his mother begins to cry, reaching forward for him with her hands. Her hair is well-kempt, her clothes sharp and pressed as usual, but she is thin and frail under it all.
Tiredness creeps up on Draco again, slow and unsuspected, after days of snatching little sleep, his head either full of dreams or full of nightmares. Pepper-Up potions keep him going through classes, even if he can't entirely sit still, feels his head splitting apart with constant irritation, and is tired and jittery all the time.
"I don't think they will."
Later on, sitting beside him on the couch, Hermione casted a diagnostic spell over Harry, and a black cloud rose up into the air. "It's
For a moment, in the midst of the malaise sinking down on the hollows of his chest, sticking heavily onto his insides, he'd  wondered how he had come to this, and why Potter couldn't have just gotten fired up and wild this time as well.
"For what exactly?"
"Wasn't your fault," Draco says. "I left because I was not alright."
"Is…" His voice came rough, cracked. "Will he…"
Harry blinked, turned his head away, not having realised that he was outlining him in his mind again, like he would trying to capture the beauty of a moment, a sight. A feeling. He focused his attention on Teddy instead, in his arms. His hair was a flaming red, and he was giggling uncontrollably at Ron's funny voice and silly faces amidst the hubbub of murmured conversation and distant chatter throughout the room.
Elias grinned at him. He had a charming sort of grin. "Yeah, no trouble. Did you get what you were looking for?" Harry nodded, holding up the book still in his hand, showing it to him.
him — it can't end well."
He helped them with breakfast the next morning and then watched the two of them standing at the floo, Ron grabbing Hermione's robes for her from the bedroom because she'd forgotten to bring it with her. She was late because she'd spent too long being engrossed in furious revision of her notes. Ron pulled it on her shoulders for her, Hermione's arms raising to let him, switching notes between her hands. She gave him a smile, a departing kiss to his cheek that he tried to return at the same time in a hurry, and then, with a wave and a
She didn't finish it, but Harry understood. What he did not understand was whether Draco had made a mistake, or that he lied, and if he did lie, the reason for it. But Harry already knew that he would let Draco keep his secrets, if that was what it was. Harry had many of his own.
Pansy breathes a sigh for composure. She has her eyes closed, her throat convulsing as she pushes down whatever she's feeling. In a low, almost trembling voice, "I can't ever see you like that again, do you understand? I don't—"
me what happened that has you so — "
. Harry tore his eyes away from him.
When they break away, Harry's rolling his lips back, a nearly helpless sort of a smile blooming, slow, into a grin anyway. His nose presses featherlight against his, so close they were.
"Hello," she said just as she came in, a tired but broad smile on her cheeks. She was brushing floo ash and powder off of her blouse. There was a book under her arm. She walked over, kissed the raise of Harry's smiling cheek.
There was a pause, a flash of something in his eyes that evaporated almost just as it came, and then Malfoy was left with only an unfathomable look on his face, teeth at the inner edge of his lip slightly, and then a twist, a sort of curl, at one corner of his mouth, turning his head away. "No," he said, low.
Very few of the Eighth Years have returned, and out of all of them, there are less than a handful of Slytherins, hence many of the seats at the table are empty. More than half of the table is occupied by the younger years, recently joined by First Years, who have been pale and afraid ever since their Houses were announced.
The bedsheets rustle, followed by the sound of bare feet padding over to his makeshift bed a moment after, growing clearer as she nears. He feels a shift beside him, feels the weight dipping on his makeshift bed, her gentle hand in his hair.
Harry nodded, his cheeks tight in a grin and his eyes clenched shut as he tried to control his own laughter. He bowed over slightly due to the tensing of his abdominal muscles.  "Absolutely...
"I don't want to talk about it," Harry cut him off, abruptly. "Just. I don't want to talk about the war, or anything like it. So don't ask me anything about that."
Draco draws himself up onto the counter, his bare feet hanging inches from the ground. He gestures at the food on the plate. "What are these?"
Malfoy's face was unwavering and cryptic, his gaze flicking the slightest over Harry's face.
why one of the stipulations was that they were legally mandated to take any and all measures and decisions to ensure the security of their lives, to the best of their abilities.
"Potter," Draco says, slipping into that facade that hides exactly these feelings. He feels the need for it especially after the scene in class, Harry laughing in the corner, as lovely as it was exasperating when it was directed
She smiled, that thin and wry smile Harry had often seen on the same lips, a different person. "I wonder when exactly he started protecting me instead of the other way around."
That month, Harry's birthday came around. He skipped the dinner party planned for him at the Burrows, told everybody he couldn't make it, so everybody brought the dinner party to him, flooing into his house one after the other.
Timothy looked very flushed. "I'm a better man than he'll ever be."

"The Basilisk," Potter says. He's told him the story, the Chamber of Secrets in second year, the diary that his father slipped into Ginny Weasley's books, the sword and Dumbledore's phoenix. He hasn't told him about this injury. There is another on the back of his hand,
In trying to find a place to breathe easy, he ends up at the empty Quidditch pitch, right in the middle of it, watching real stars high up in the sky. The world is quiet, but open in front of him, reminding him that he's free. He turns the wireless on in his hand, tunes it and changes stations until he can hear the grainy and soft singing of an old song, a woman's voice. He puts it next to his head.

"What, like this?" Harry said, after a few seconds of silence, of Draco's crestfallen face. He tried to cast the spell on himself, but it was only a breeze that puffed up the front of his curls, making it flop back onto his temples.
"Well, just so you know, Potter," Malfoy said. "They're not like that here. Not the staff, at least. I've seen it happen, and they were nothing but supportive."
"I lied," Draco said, quietly. "About your magic going away."
“But I… I’m sorry. Because it wasn’t really my place to do that, was it? It just wasn't my place."
"Oh yeah, totally!" Ron said, a bit too loudly.
Ron is angry. He doesn't talk to Harry for weeks, coming close to a whole month. He knows he hurt Ginny, broke her heart. He did the wrong thing trying to fall back in love with her when he knew he couldn't, and he deserves their cold shoulder. He is still terrified of losing him and everybody else he loved. He is still fucked up over losing Draco. He is terrified of not ever talking to them, terrified of going over first only to learn he was no longer welcome or a part of their family. So he keeps himself isolated in Grimmauld Place, with only Hermione and Luna visiting him for company.
"I will," Harry said to him, quietly.
Draco was not prepared for the way he'd felt seeing him go quiet instead. For the strange twist of his own heart at seeing him stand up to his feet, gather his things, and then slip away.
"I'm back." It's all he can think of saying. "I'm here now."
, and of course you deserve to go out and find people you really want to be with." Harry relaxed in his chair, and then felt chagrined for his premature reaction. She waved his apologetic look away. "I'm just saying, no, it shouldn't really be considered infidelity in the moral sense, but in the eyes of the

isn't a word that really fits Draco Malfoy all too well, and it seems much too odd to call him that aloud. So he doesn't.
He turned on his heel, making for the fireplace. Hermione quickly skirted around the table and caught his arm, put her hands on his face, murmuring something to him that made him loosen slightly after a restless and agitated moment, with an acquiescing nod, even though his face was still ablaze.
They had stopped here on the way to have dinner. It was a fairly fancy place, full of golden sconces and candlelights, all lush red decor. Outside, the rain pattered fast and loud, rushing over roofs and falling to the streets in a roaring rhythm, and through the window beaded with droplets, they could see the way it had made the streets dark grey, the blurred blue neon lights of the place across from here.
But in the weeks after, with this distance, there comes a sort of clarity; that Harry thinks about Draco much too often, even when he isn't here and he has no reason to. That he's never thought of another boy like this, the way he thinks of Draco, with such urgency and intensity. With so much of his heart pulled towards him.
, for Merlin's sake, it's
The next time he woke up, it was just when the beginnings of a pre-dawn haze was coming into the room. Draco was sitting on the windowsill, one knee up, looking out.

"Just that I thought of coming to see you. But I wasn't sure what you'd think of that."
"We'll work something out, Harry," Hermione said, softly. "This isn't a marriage. Not in any real sense. This is just… a temporary solution. We'll find

Harry moved a little half-heartedly to their pulling
"Not at all," Harry said. He brushed a hand over his rib, the feel of a somewhat clear ridge if he pressed slightly.
"Everybody knows about your Draco camera, Harry." Ginny grinned cheekily, her hands folded behind her. She was in her blue Weasley sweater. Everybody in the room was, outside of the Malfoys. "Draco showed Luna all the pictures of those places you two went through, and Luna told me the camera was mostly just full of pictures of him, and some recent ones of you taken by him, I suppose."
Draco began to tremble slightly against his chest, and Harry's shoulders tensed. His hand was quick to the side of Draco's jaw, craning his head down to get a look at him, terrified it was all coming back again until he heard the sounds coming.

"You're not
At first Harry didn't quite understand what he'd said. He'd thought it was an incoherent word, as one might in delirium, but it seemed like a sign of improvement and Harry, latching on, quickly kneeled back down, leaned close, hands mindlessly coming around Malfoy's knee, the edge of a cushion. "Malfoy?" he whispered.
Harry looked up from the paper on the table, at him, blinking. His mouth opened, worked around words he didn't have.
He watched Teddy waddle-run over to Draco, whose cheeks folded into a slanted half-grin. He caught Teddy by the underarms, appearing mock-stern and jesting as he spoke to him, silvery eyes narrow and bright. Teddy laughed around his own fingers, face alight, with the hint of two baby teeth through a broad, gummy smile. Draco pulled lightly at Teddy's wrist, with a grimace that had Harry amused, ducking his head.
"I'm here," Harry whispers into it. "Come outside. I'm standing at your door."
"What?" Harry asked, frowning.
"Do you remember that day in the Room of Hidden Things?" Draco said.
Potter stays around with Draco and Luna until it's time for Quidditch practice, conversation branching out from the mundane into more, into past memories, into a sort of banter over each other's younger selves, carefully avoiding the uglier parts of history. At some point Draco had ended up shoving at him in his feigned annoyance, Potter making fun of him to Luna to the point of ridiculous impersonations, the two of them stupid and bickering to Luna's amusement.
"What did she mean? When she said… when she said she didn't want to see you like that again?"
Draco flicks a slight smile at him, glancing away. It's a bit comforting to know that maybe Harry isn't the only one feeling a bit out of sorts here.
His hand raised from the table, nostrils flared. He turned and set at a clipped pace towards the door.
Harry shook his head, pressing his nose into his snow-blond hair. He swallowed, pressing a kiss to his forehead and wrapping his arms around his neck. "You can go back. You can always go back."
"Did you not hear yourself?" Malfoy said, narrowed his eyes. "Fifty percent chance of success?"
"I'm fine," Draco said, quick and absent. "I'm…" He trailed off, sounded feeble. He shook his head slightly.
When Harry shuffled into the kitchen after his shower that morning, a towel around the nape of his neck, Draco was in the kitchen, looking fresh and clean after his own shower, white shirt tightened at the waistband of his pressed trousers. His hair was still damp, thick and tousled together from it, the side to Harry all tucked behind his ear, some of the fringe hanging free on the opposite side of his face. His head was tilted slightly over the stove, hand around the handle moving it around, buttoned sleeves pushed up a bit on a thin arm.
I really have to
"Do you know how the potion works? The one that Malfoy was given?" Hermione asks him, the next day, in the fall of a silence. They're sitting in the library, where she was tutoring him on Transfiguration theories five minutes ago, and then gave him some questions to practice on.
He sees his tousled raven-black hair amongst ginger-reds and bushy brown, all the rest of the world around him blurred out. He sees him leaning his face close to the crying infant in his arms, murmuring to him, a soothing hand running over baby-blue locks. The golden sunlights of the morning are falling down on him, alighting his cheeks, catching on the ebony of his curls and the green of his eyes.
It comes as a jolt to him. Draco's face falls, unable to gather it back up. Potter looks away from it.
"A good marriage?"
The third chapter of the story is set during  the chapter Malfoy Manor, where Harry, Ron and Hermione are captured by Snatchers and brought in front of the Malfoys. Narcissa and Lucius use this as an opportunity to manipulate the Snatchers into bringing Draco to them so that he can identify Harry. Draco is awakened by Lucius' tears and is asked to identify Harry. He refuses to give an apparent answer, ensuring more time for all of them. Eventually Harry and his friends escape, having no choice but to leave Draco behind. Narcissa and Lucius are forced to hand Draco back over to His tormentors. Severus visits him once more and, on his plea, gives him the potion again.
Draco remains transfixed above them. There's a huff, something that isn't quite disdain, something else entirely. "What do you want to know?"
If something still doesn't make sense, feel free to ask!!
"I read," Harry said, huffing at his smirk, and taking it for the teasing it was. "I read all my books before coming to Hogwarts. Picked up the habit again through Eighth Year. I was too busy trying not to get killed to have the time before that."
Harry bit his lip, glancing over at the other man. "I had fun today, you know."
Draco smirked, a scoff through his nose. "Are you really so concerned about getting my praise?"
It lasted three infinite seconds, just as softly letting go.
Then, Draco continued, still with his head low. "Here's another secret." His throat bobbed, his voice having gone quieter. "I don't remember at all, when or how I fell in love with you."

On another day, Narcissa tells him, "He's undergoing Permanent Partial Obliviation."
He looks at the baby in his arms, his heart swelling into a bruise, a melancholic sort of fondness. He looks at him and he thinks of Remus and Tonks, everything they'll never get to see or know about Teddy. They'll never get to see or know how wonderful he is.
"Salazar, why did you take this?" Draco asked, wide-eyed, taking the camera from him and eyeing it closely. Harry did not see what he was so flustered about.
With magic and curses, there was always the possibility of other unforeseen complications, ones that weren't entirely possible to deduce, and might have never shown up in past cases of similar nature, so this was one more thing that they must be fully prepared for.
On Monday, Draco finds his body heavier, drained of energy even despite the stronger dosage of Pepper-Up, feels uneasy tenfold on this particular day. It all comes to a head in Charms, his head spinning and light, colours dancing in his vision, and then everything goes black.
How could Harry have been so blind?

"But I'm sure you're aware that the work I do is not fitting to speak of in this setting," Draco says.
"Yeah."
When it passed, Harry's smile faded, turned a little rueful. He thumbed a line of a scar across Draco's waist, the ones he had always kept hidden behind glamours. Draco couldn't cast them anymore. "Not always," he said, quietly.
* * *
"Draco, Harry… he will be there. Didn't you say he will return to Hogwarts? I can ask him to
Malfoy shrugged. "Why not me?"
But he said — forced it out of himself, "I'll make sure it won't, as much as I can."
" He gestured, incomprehensibly, fumbling through words. "
"I don't want you to go," but then Harry was choking out, before he could even think about it, when the tide of grief had come over him in such a blinding rush.
It's two songs later that Potter dozes off, right there next to him, and Draco sees them from the eyes of the night sky, the image of Potter asleep stark in the middle of an enormous pitch, Draco not far behind. When his heart finally comes to a steady pace, the storm, the turmoil, of his body settles to calm, to a deep and aching tenderness in the spaces between his bones. His eyes fall shut to the stars, the sound of Potter's breathing soft and steady beside him.
"Alright?" Harry asked, softly.
"And you?"
Harry huffed, raspy. "Yeah. I don't know if he
With one person bearing much of the weight of the bond's magic, negative emotions were predisposed to hold an effect on Malfoy in a way it hadn't for either of them before. It might be gradual, accumulative, eventually showing with time. It might affect him as it came and went. This was to be determined.
Harry's face bloomed into a broad grin at that. Then he grabbed Draco's wrist, still sat on the stool, and pulled him down on his lap, into a kiss.
A good part of him wants to ask. His heart beats loud throughout his body.

"Please, Uncle Harry," Emelie said, then, clapping her hands together and putting them on her cheeks, her chin, as if to express excitement. "It'll be so fun! And maybe you can teach me some of your magic tricks, and you can tell me all about the wizards and witches, and the magic school— " She rambled a bit.
"Mother," Draco tried to interrupt, but his voice was barely there.
Draco glances over at him with a raise of his brows, holds it for a few seconds of curious scrutiny, and then huffs, in that way he sometimes did, teetering just between mirthful and mirthless. He looks a bit like he's just walked out of a steamed shower. "Rumpled and sweaty?"
Sometimes Harry almost forgot that. That it's only been months since Draco has gotten better.
There was something in Malfoy's eyes right then that didn't make sense to Harry, an odd, raw flash of— of want, of hope, perhaps even a tinge of desperation. It lasted only for all of two seconds, before he averted his gaze.
Weeks after Draco leaves Hogwarts, he gets on another train that takes him to Cardiff, Wales, where Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini have made themselves a home in the muggle world. They wanted to escape the war and all its ruin, its ugly aftermath.
"What of your relatives?"
behalf one day?
"You're here," Draco says, when it goes on long enough. Just to say something to him, to hear his voice come back. "You came."
He's referring to Draco's tired demeanour nowadays. Harry's caught him sleeping fairly often, on the library desks or on the couch of an empty Eighth Year Commons in the midst of sleeping sessions, his books hanging off of his hands, and sometimes even in the midst of an ongoing lecture.
Teddy put tiny forefingers into them, wrinkling up his nose with a broad, toothless grin on his face.
And then Harry forgot all about his social rules. "He's not a Death-Eater anymore," he said, coldly. He stood up, pushing himself away from him. "Now if you'll excuse me
Harry bit back the laugh seizing his throat. "Did you have to make it worse for him?"
This one doesn't entirely make sense to Harry. There is no date.
"Shit, I… I swear I didn't know that. I'm sorry. I really thought you meant for me to—"
"I understand you don't trust me, what with me being an former Death Eater and all—"
It was impersonal and detached, all primal, no meaning. They never kissed, too intimate and something of meaning. They never talked about it outside of what they needed from each other when they were doing it. The level of sexual appetite, it seemed, would be the only thing they had in common.
He turns the corner of an aisle and freezes.
When they weren't actively ignoring each other and pretending the other didn't exist, they were arguing. Whatever forced patience they'd been trying to maintain at first, was gone by the next week at most, and all over again, they were arguing about Harry not being able to stay still at night, about Malfoy's shite all over the kitchen table and his damned wireless babbling nutty theories about the two of them again
Breaking the pattern of only seeing each other at mealtimes means that he spends a lot of time with Draco now. With Ron and Hermione always paired together in projects, sitting together, Harry makes himself a place beside Draco in all the classes they share. They exchange their drawings and notes throughout drawn-out lectures, quietly smiling. There are times Harry even finds them tucked into his robes, into his books, left under his door.
, Petunia and Dudley's disgust, his own desperately denied crush on a boy in second grade. Harry stared him right in the eye, coldly. "I wanted to let my husband know that I'd be late."
Draco hesitates. He turns his head, looks to Luna, who's sprawled on the grounds next to him. They've been 'cloud-watching', as Luna calls it, her telling him what each cloud in the sky seems like to her. Too often her observations are comically wild, but sometimes they're a creature that Draco has never heard of, and isn't even sure are real, so she has to describe their appearance.
There was nothing said.
He felt it first, that afternoon, while he was in the kitchen fixing himself something to eat. Harry let his plate drop with a light clink and clutter, gripping the edge of the counter in an onslaught of frustration and despair. He breathed through that for a moment, and then turned around, jaw set tight, as he went over and jostled Malfoy's arm, one of their many non-verbal signals. He'd been reading at the kitchen table, thick-framed glasses low on his nose, but he didn't look irritated this time, just looked up at him in that forever bored way of his, politely feigning interest. He must not be feeling it yet.
. Some sort of change. Like maybe it becomes more unpredictable. More intense. But like I said, it's just something to consider if
"Yeah?"
He'd been touchy ever since the war, with Hermione obviously, kissed her all the time and always seemed to have a hand on her waist or the small of her back, but also with Harry; a casual, tight hand to the nape of his neck, an arm around his shoulder blades, bicep against his when they brushed their teeth at the sink together,  as if constantly trying to remind himself that they were all still here.
"You must not have a lot of faith in them, then," Draco says, coolly. "Even after they've gone through a war with you."
"Thank you," she said, taking it from him. She took a sip, a few seconds' pause.
From the other room, he could hear Emelie's shriek of laughter, the vague sound of Petunia's voice. Olivia was carrying her across the corridors, towards the loo to get Emelie's hands washed, laughing too.
"Show yourself!"
"I know, but
and I just can't
On Sunday, he spent dinner with the Weasleys and went home with Ron and Hermione, now that he could. They graciously do not ask about this new development, and the three of them spend hours awake talking about nothing, and then he stayed the rest of the night on their couch, just because he could, and they didn't mind.
"You were the one that—" Harry begins to say, and then sighs, giving up. He shakes his hair off his temples. "Alright. Fine."
Draco turned fully, tracking him as Harry passed by him. "What's the matter with you?"
There was a reason why they were asked the questions they were asked, and why they were made to sign a contract full of the stipulations it contained
"Yes but it makes you feel better! Isn't that so wonderful?" Draco is looking at her keenly, hopeful. She only nods politely.
orchestration
no wireless rambling the day's news, or an old English song, or one of those French songs that he sometimes heard being hummed in the shower. The kitchen table was clean for the first time in months.
"You… did you do that because I—" His voice is coming out so terrible.
"I was wondering if it was something related to…" She cleared his throat. "To the curse?"
And then he's gone, a shadow of another body in front of him falling over his hazy vision. There's a voice somewhere afar, familiar and angry and wild, speaking fast and loud. "
"I'm sorry I didn't..." Harry says. He frowns, looking down at his hands. "I wasn't there enough either, was I?"
"I'm sorry," Draco said, quiet, after a long few minutes, which was surprising enough to snap Harry's head up.
"This is muggle music, you realize." Potter's transfixed on the stars, Draco on the lights in his eyes.
"No, it's," Potter says, a little like he's trying to pacify him. "It's not, but it's just... it's overwhelming, okay? It's hard and overwhelming and
Harry frowned, puzzled. He was trying to say something, but his tongue was too heavy, difficult to work with.
Harry wasn't able to steer clear of Malfoy for all too long, but he tried anyway as much as he could, avoiding rooms he was in, going off somewhere outside as much and as long as he thought he could afford.
of you, it was… disgusting and
Draco awoke in a slow stir, Harry's knuckles running featherlight over his cheek. His eyes opened, finding Harry's face, cheek on the soft part of Harry's shoulder joint, head tilted back a bit. He brushed a thumb under his eyes, a breath stuck painfully in his throat.
"I don't like that nasty stuff we have to take when I get a cold," Jenny comments, scrunching her nose up.
That was how they found themselves sitting at the edge of a pier, legs hanging over it, knees brushing together.
But he didn't, perhaps too consumed by whatever was troubling him so much. "He—he humiliated her—he spat on—" Draco could hardly speak, shuddering with the quiver of his chin. Harry resisted the urge to soothe it away with his hands, hold him close to his shoulder. "He called my mother a—"
Harry tries to shake his head, meet his eyes, but for some reason, finds that he can't, too quick to look away. "Just been a strange day."
"It's the... " Harry's mouth went dry, running on its own before he could even understand why it was. "The physical contact… you know. It's
Malfoy turned out to be correct in his presumption that the bond acted up sporadically. What they hadn't been able to feel the first time, the two of them asleep when it came in, was
Harry's face softens and he smiles. "Bye Scorp," he says, waving back with his hand full of car keys.
well, I suppose, infidelity."
"I was the one that told Harry," Hermione tells Draco, one day, sitting in the kitchen. She and him, drinking tea together, and he never would have thought of this in school, the two of them here like this, being friends. "The truth of those dreams."
Harry doesn't really know what to say. They lapse into silence.
The whole thing with Cho Chang was an awkward disaster. She was wonderful, but Harry supposed they hadn't quite worked well together, and she wasn't in the best state of mind to be in a relationship after... after Cedric's death.
The burst of laughter was surprising to Harry himself as much as it must have been to Malfoy. He bowed over the table, shoulders shaking mirthfully as his arms laid atop the glass surface. His hand shot up to his grinning mouth, shyly, as he looked up, which was just in time to see a split-second glimpse of Malfoy's own grin, before it wiped off quickly.
In watching these videos, he could remember all the times the words had been there, right there on the edge of his tongue. The way he felt. He had watched Draco laugh at something Harry said, and all he could think was,
"Hello. Surprising you," Draco says. "I thought I'd finally come and see you, since you were so clearly miserable without me."
"I fell in love with him."
Then he turns under the tangle of Draco's legs, his fingers curled loose on the soft between Potter's, his head lifting at the cue. Potter slides the other arm across his shoulderblades, pulling him close and rolling them over a little. He presses him down into the pillows, kisses him deep and unhurried.
Ron eyes him for a moment, as if making sense of something. "Our family," he says. "And one day you should give me your stupid relatives' new fellytone number, so I can bloody scream their ears off again."
"What if it gets in the wrong hands!" Harry was saying, slightly wild and frantic, trying to pull him down and tugging at his arm. "Somebody like Skeeter would have a field day with—"
"Anyway, we must be leaving," Draco says, checking his silver watch at the same time he squeezes Scorpius' face into his side by the back of his hair. "I have deliveries to make, errands to run, so I can't be standing around here all day having a chat."
Harry grins, takes the book up and out of his hands. "So now that we've established that," he says, teasingly making towards him for a kiss, but then the book is out of his hands again and shoved back against Harry's face.
"Is there anything she doesn't tell you?"
would pressurise him?"
Harry startled at the hands on his shoulders and arms. Malfoy was blindly tapping his hands over him to get his attention, his excited and awed gaze was fixated on the band playing on the stage, the guitarists and pianists and drummers. It was a strange expression on the otherwise cold or bitter or exhausted face. Harry had somehow not considered what positive emotions not laced with malice might look like on Malfoy's face. His chest felt strange at the sight of it. "Listen!" he yelled over the chorus of noise. "Here it comes, Potter! The best part!"
"Yes. I have a lot of them," Draco says. Harry's tracing a line of the Narcissus flowers covering over his Dark Mark.
Something was tight in the back of his throat. Harry closed his eyes, leaned forward onto his hands on the counter, and tried to breathe. He didn't know what would have hurt worse in the end — if he had taken every bit of time he could have had with him, having him. If he hadn't had anything at all, hadn't had even more to lose when the grief of losing him already felt like dying himself.
Just as he reached the door, however, he heard a voice calling out his name, forcing him and his friends to halt to an abrupt step. Harry had frozen in shock, his heart skipping as if he'd missed three steps altogether when the owner of it registered in his mind.
Warning: this chapter deals with panic attacks, depressive responses and dissociation as a part of PTSD (and some mentions of Harry's abusive past with the Dursleys) but by no means is the portrayal meant to encompass the true complexity of it!
"Well, I do, Potter." Draco's lips are pressed tight, little pin-dots on the corners of his mouth, and Harry is distracted by them in the clearest way right now. "
The golden glitter around his finger wavers and dissipates. He lowers his hand. Fitting, he supposes, that Potter should only fall for someone as good as himself.
"No, Harry!" Hermione shook his head. "No. For goodness' sake, of course not
Sometimes in particularly private places, Draco will kiss him and kiss him, and settle over his lap as he does, with his hands around his jaw, the nape of his neck, half in his hair. They don't do much beyond kissing, and tugging up the tails of each other's school shirts and push their hands up under them, to splay them over the heated skin of each other's bodies, and Harry is very much fine with that. But he thinks about it a lot. He thinks about a lot of things a lot when he's alone, when it comes to Draco. He thinks about a lot
Draco opened his eyes, drowsy, his magic dissipating away. He shifted his head a little on his shoulder, lolling slightly, looking up at him. He smirked, his gaze woozy and mellow and fixated, very closely, onto his own. "Hm. Maybe I'll serenade you."
Strange how his insides twist for a boy that he once thought he'd loathed more than anything. Strange how the thought of him tugs at his gut, leaves him wishing he'd come back. Strange how often he thinks of him, of their time at St. Mungos, more than any of the hundreds of things that could be on his mind after a war.
Following this visit, Harry was much too careful about him. He verbally pushed Draco into bed all the time, did not let him do much of anything to do with chores, brought their meals up to bed and ate with him there. They seemed to spend much of the time in bed, either sleeping or just lying together, or talking about everything and nothing, or sometimes Draco would play his violins for a bit, or watch Harry paint.

"But trying to force two thirteen years old to date with the prospect of marriage in mind? That's fucked up." Draco made a noise, sort of agreeable, sort of
Malfoy was sitting across from him at the table, having oh-so-generously left some space for Harry to have his breakfast again.
Draco introduces himself with his full name, and then presents himself as a chemist, explaining what it means by adapting it to his work as a potioneer, what his tasks are; to analyse chemicals and see what they consist of, to measure how fast a substance reacts with another, to understand a new thing that they don't know much about or to create a new chemical that can help in certain fields or areas of life. He works from a lab in his home, creating a lot of new chemicals and medicine, delivering them for the people that place their orders.
"We'll do it again next week, okay? I promise," Harry said to him loudly across the distance, frowning for quite a while afterwards.
"How about you consider what this looks like, Narcissa?" Molly snapped. "For Harry to have come back from a visit that
Harry’s spirits lifted when he saw them, and realised that inviting them over might spur conversation on, though the timing was curious - had Malfoy perhaps invited them? Ron and Neville approached, as did Blaise and Pansy.
Harry pulled Draco into a warm embrace and kissed him firmly, savouring the taste of Draco on his lips. He had waited for what felt like forever to hold him. He felt Draco relax as he stroked the back of his neck and whispered sweet nothings in his ear. Harry broke the embrace and looked Draco fully in the eyes, “Are you ready?” he asked. While he was trying to calm Draco somewhat, he couldn’t hide his excitement from showing through. He held Draco’s hand tightly, stroking little circles with his thumb on his cold skin.
Without thinking, Draco responded, “Of course,” Neville looked at Harry as if proving a point, then Draco came to his senses, “but if Potter doesn’t want to, then I’m not going to force him.” Neville shot him a look but he couldn’t quite read it - shock perhaps, pride?
Harry’s heart fluttered slightly – why did this feel like a date? Why had he had a sudden flurry of excitement?
“I’m sorry, dear, it was a bit rushed,” Molly admitted, “I only found out that you and Harry were together yesterday,” she shot a glance at Ron who grinned sheepishly at her, “but it should fit all the same.”
“Do you…” he bit his lip, “Dance?”
Harry recognised his cue, and selected a present from the top of his pile. It was from Ginny. She looked excitedly at him as he set to opening his present and then laughed as he gasped.
Harry nodded, and inspected the potion again, mesmerised by the circulating shimmer within the liquid, “Are you marketing this?” Harry asked, a smile on his face.
“I don’t think I am either, Potter,” Draco smiled, “but how about we just go with what feels good?”
“Fine, fine… he's this way,” she gestured with her hand and led Hermione and Ron to Harry's room.
Seamus and Dean stayed with Harry for days, letting Hermione and Ron sort things out for Harry so that the media didn't get wind of what had happened - a media storm in the hospital wouldn't help the situation, and as they were listed as his next of kin, they could pretty much say whatever and it had to be done.
Eventually, Harry spoke as he put his cup down, “Are you okay?” his voice was low, as if the atmosphere surrounding them urged him to be quiet.
When he had told his story, there was a silence across the classroom.
Harry and Draco somehow managed to get to Harry’s room, and Draco flopped Harry onto his bed.
If you're reading the fic with the playlist, the obvious song for this scene is Dance like a Hippogriff <3 https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7zwSW4S80YP35idD1R5Xjg?si=-ViVX7moTbqLyf-7dODJIQ
Harry stood up, and everyone turned to look at him. A hush fell on the room.
Harry groaned, “Honestly, that’s what I was expecting.”
He took a breath, “Always. You make me nervous in ways that I don’t think anyone else ever has done before,”
Harry shrugged and stripped, somewhat clumsily, down to his underwear then slid into bed.
He swung his legs from the bed and perched on the edge, drinking his tea. When he had finished he went over to his trunks and pulled out a white shirt, some grey slacks and one of Mrs Weasleys jumpers. It was a dark red and gold and had Harry’s initials on: HJP. He adored the cosy richness of Molly’s jumpers and so found any excuse to wear one.
When he got back to his room after saying goodbye to Harry, he took a draught of peace to alleviate his symptoms.
Harry sighed playfully, “There’s your favourite chocolate in the pantry downstairs?” Harry smirked, knowing that Draco’s love for chocolate could persuade him to do anything – well,
One morning, Draco doesn't show up to the Great Hall.
The new Eighth-Year Commons is a modest-sized expanse of area themed with colours of all Houses, a fireplace at the opposite end of the entrance door, which is guarded simply by a door that allows entry to only certain people and opens at the correct password. It is, essentially, a small central lounge opening into several dorm rooms.
Harry hadn't thought much about that in these last four days, frankly. His head had been too full of the alteration, too full of the idea of freedom and hope, but now that the moment was so close, it had never felt further away. He had never felt so surreal and aware of everything that could go wrong. So afraid, in particular after reading the clauses of the contract, all the uncertainty that they had to agree to. But he'd thought of all of last year, thought of every year being like this until he was forty, and then it was worth a try. And then anything was worth more than sitting silent and stuck in a life so small and boxed in by this curse.
Draco pauses. He does not know how to explain blood relations to a three-year old. "Yes, but. Much handsomer."
Luna is holding a handful of leaves in her palm, transforming them into butterflies, giving him tips on how to draw his magic. How to focus it. How to mold it into the act of transfiguring.
They eat in his parents'—his mother's room because neither of them can stomach anything at the dining table anymore. Sitting on the bed together, back against the headboards, he can sense his mother's gaze on him. When he looks up at her, she smiles at him, a soft twitch of the corners of her lips. It's only then he realizes that he's forgotten to raise his own spoon to his mouth.
When the bout was over and he finally calmed down, Harry asked again, "What did you do?" He couldn't keep the grin out of his voice as he did at the sight of Malfoy losing it.
She doesn't move nor answer. Draco takes her hands, pulling it away from her swollen, red face, holding them in his own. She swallows hard. "Mother, please."
"Take me for a dance?" Draco said. He was holding his hand out over the table. Their dinner was finished, and they were both on their third or fourth glass of fine wine.
"That's not the same thing. That's just… fanaticism. Or… I don't know. They've never even met me, have they? I mean… I mean
When it's clear that he'll be following him right out the door, Draco whips around, Potter nearly running right into him.
He will know him just by the sound of his breathing.
He huffed out a derisive laugh. "Salazar, Potter. Don't tell me the Saviour of the Wizarding World is
George, too, came by often to check on the two of them, and Ginny as soon as she could get her schedule cleared. So did Ron and Hermione, and Molly too, but most days they did not come upstairs, as if to not burden or disturb, and so Harry only knew by the handwriting on the notes reminding Harry to eat, take care of himself. Only noticed their house left cleaner than before, food always on their table under stasis, a replaced set of potions in the medicine cabinet for pain and malaise and nausea.
All the anger drained from Harry's body in an instant.
"What if I'm just no good for you?"
didn't quite—leave much room—but I preferred being close to them anyway because—" His voice faded off, throwing a quick glance at Harry's face again, back down at the top of his drink. He made a sort of scoff in his chest, one corner of his mouth curling mirthlessly. "You think I'm pathetic."
Harry thought of all the hours Draco spent in his potions lab. Maybe that was what he had been doing all that time, trying to figure this out.
Please look out for discussion of the suicide attempt in the previous chapter!
Draco picked out a nice pair of clothes for Harry and buttoned up his coat and wrapped his scarf around his neck. He brushed up Harry's hair from the front with his fingers, gelled it up a bit into something more deliberate and artful. Harry encircled his arms around his lower back as he did that, loosened quickly when Draco swatted at him to stay still and let him work, and when Draco did kiss him on the lips at the end of it, finally, they couldn't seem to stop.
But he's trying, don't they know? What's the point of holding on to a boy that has long since forgotten he even exists. He's trying to forget him too. He really is.
"Will you tell me about them? Your dreams?"
"Has this happened before?"
He shifts the topic, asks him about his potions mastery. Draco took his NEWTs privately a year back, got into an average institution for his good grades, exceedingly so for their criteria, but the more high-tier ones weren't open to taking him, since his history was no secret.
He'd known it in all these months he had him in bed, transfixed by the rosy flush of his cheeks, and in the way he found himself outlining him in his mind, making a painting out of a moment that he stood in. In the mornings, the first sight of him, sitting cross-legged at the table in the shroud of daylight, at the counter making breakfast, softly asleep right in front of him on the other side of a pillow.
“It’s a hard thing to imagine,” Hermione says.
References are at the end notes!
s, and he remembered the way the curse muddled so much between them, how strange and uncomfortable it could be for Draco to be held by a man he would know was in love with him when he didn't feel the same, and the way Draco didn't need to be burdened by anything more that had to do with Harry, because Harry had done enough to ruin him. And then he knew that he could never say anything.
"A secret?"
Harry strokes his cheek with a thumb. "I know," he says. "I understand."
"But you're not in love with her anymore, are you," Draco says.
"Do you—" Draco hesitates. "Do you think that's wrong?"
That was for how long they'd been
But Blaise is perfectly amicable to him, asks him if he'd like a drink. Pansy is civil only as much as she needs to be, for Draco's sake, but it's clear that she doesn't like him.
"Draco? Does it..." Harry stopped, swallowing hard. He rephrased the stupidly obvious question he was about to ask. "Where does it hurt?"
Harry rolled his eyes, making to stand up. "Look, if you're not going to answer the question, I'm leaving. You're just wasting both our time here." He wasn't serious about leaving. Mostly, he was hoping to force Malfoy into spilling the truth, because for whatever reason, he was very adamant on keeping Harry here.
McGonagall had written in her response letter.
"I'd like to see it," Draco says.
The game starts again. Potter flies off to take his position a moment before, talks to Ginevra and kisses her cheek hard. Draco averts his gaze quickly.
" Harry was saying, hands up, yet another box between his knees, but somebody threw a ball of gift wrapper at his face, and Ginny told him to shut up.
When she leaves, she does so with a kiss to his forehead and a pat to his cheek.
It's just for a second, but Harry sees him, through the blurred wave of dancing people in the distance between them. He sees him standing at the door of his dorm, one hand on the frame, the other around the doorknob, his head bowed slightly. He lifts his head, a faltering movement, looking right at Harry. Maybe Draco realises that he's been seen, a few seconds later, because he then looks down quickly. Away.
But his words faded, and his eyes were glazed, and Harry knew they couldn't go on. He held Draco tighter by the waist and took them back to the hotel room by the wrapped portkey in his pocket, where they spent the rest of the day in bed doing nothing spectacular and adventurous, ordering room service and watching TV on low. Harry was sitting up on the other side of a pillow, couldn't stop looking over at Draco drifting in and out, breathing a soft lilt of squeaky inhales and exhales. He had the back of a hand in the space between them, a loose curl of his fingers.
Olivia was lovely, treated Harry with utmost hospitality, care and kindness. She was telling him, in a loud voice from the kitchen, how she had met Dudley, spinning a funny story out of how she'd given him a piece of her mind for spilling coffee on her. They'd married young, at nineteen, when she got pregnant with Emelie. Dudley was overly kind too, in a nearly anxious sort of way. At some point, Vernon had come up. He'd died of a heart attack two years ago. Petunia was seemingly fine with Emelie, not entirely amicable and open with Olivia, distant and tense for the most part.
"I'm sure they suffered enough the first time," Harry says, smiling back slightly.
and Harry would kiss him on the cheek, about to stand up straight, until Draco would stir and open his eyes and see him, saying his name and mumbling a sleepy greeting as he tried to sit upright. Harry would kiss him softly, a hand curled beside his head, murmuring a
"A bit overdressed, aren't you?" Harry gestured vaguely at him. Then again, he supposed Malfoy was always overdressed. He'd hardly ever seen him in anything other than his fancy suits. Even if he wasn't wealthy anymore, he probably still liked feeling that he was.
Draco fell asleep as soon as he climbed into bed, Harry's glasses and both their suits, belts and shoes off, as he curled up in the tangle of Harry's arms against his chest.
Draco's throat bobs, transfixed on the biggest glowing star. He didn't know this.
Ron looks bemused. "What are you getting so defensive for?"
There is too much that isn't fair.
"I don't know," Harry said, though maybe he did. Maybe he didn't entirely. It should have been okay, but it wasn't, and Harry just didn't know what had gone wrong. He looked down at his hands. "It's the only thing that makes any sense. I don't know."
Draco chuckled and withdrew his fingers from Harry, slowly, teasingly. He pulled Harry up from the desk and drew him into a brief but passionate kiss. Draco broke the kiss and roughly turned Harry around, so he was resting on his elbows on the desk. Draco admired Harry’s behind, his taut, rich skin glistening with sweat and his strong back just daring to be scratched. Draco drew in a deep breath and exhaled slowly, making sure that he didn’t lose control of himself as he once more pushed his fingers slowly into Harry, adding a third as Harry moaned with delight.
“Eyes up here, Harry.” Draco smiled and disappeared into his room. Harry followed him and closed the door behind him. Harry sniggered at Draco’s comment and let it slide.
Harry sat, alone, at the long table in the kitchen. His breathing had slowed, his brow was dry, and his hands had stopped shaking. Kreacher placed a chipped mug full of hot chocolate in front of Harry, and presented him with a plate of hot crumpets. Harry looked favourably upon Kreacher, and smiled briefly at him.
“Potter, are you busy?” He looked around the classroom and when he saw that Harry was alone he stepped further into the classroom.
Harry knew that he would ache tomorrow. He ached now. He had really let loose, let his hair down and lived in the moment. Though this was supposed to be a mission to
Harry looked at Draco sympathetically, “We’ll still see each other all the time,” he said softly, “I’ll see you again at dinner time and tonight.” he reached out a hand and stroked Draco’s pale cheek. Draco leaned into him and sighed. He eventually nodded his head.
Neville looked at Draco and smiled, but smiled with a sadness, “Harry has been eating more and more in his office the past few years. The students - especially the first years - tend to gawp at him a bit. I think it puts him off. Maybe it would help if you asked to join him in his office some time? I’m sure he’d appreciate it.”
They arrived at the club while it was still clad in darkness. The building, while not so grand, maintained a sophisticated air. Knockturn Alley didn’t have the negative stigma any longer, the Aurors had cleaned it up quite well after the war and now it was home to wizarding nightlife. Bars, clubs, and various restaurants filled up the narrow street, enchanted lights and windows glowed with warm, inviting interiors. The Knockin’ Kneazle stood at the end of the Alley, watching over it all every single night. The whole alley would come alive during the hours between 10pm and 7am, only to be lost in silence during the day.
“Neville and Hannah, you and Ron and, erm… Draco.” Harry said. He tried to hide the smile that crept onto his face when he said Draco’s name, but Hermione was far too quick for him.
Hannah and Neville said their goodbyes and Harry let them out of the house. The snow had really piled up, and yet, Harry could still see a lone sunflower swaying in the wind.
It was twelve o’clock when Draco headed to the Owlery to post his letter to Granger, and to send his regular set of instructions to the dispensary. His stomach was still full of butterflies and he tried to figure out why as he walked back to his room to get ready. Was it because he was nervous about playing Quidditch again? Was he happy that he finally had a friendship with Harry – was this just a level of happiness that he’d not experienced before?
"Were you watching me?" Harry asks, amused. His voice is rough, in a way that sounds annoyingly attractive. Draco flushes, flustered alongside his exasperation. Harry laughs, runs a hand down his back. The ink of a dragon wing. "Creep."
Then Draco was back to curling his arms around his neck, the back of his head, cheek against his. Harry pushed a kiss on his shoulder, nestled him closer into his own with a gentle hand at the back of his hair.
That night, he told her everything in a way he hadn't to anybody else outside of Aileen. Like the seven year old that used to tell her all his stories about the treehouse and the peacocks in their garden, the unkind things his father used to say in his cold anger.
Most of the day is spent staying out in the gardens, where Draco feels more at ease than he does between the walls. He and his mother spend the evening recalling old memories.
In his trunk, left slightly open for its mass of contents, he can see all the drawings and notes he's collected over the months in the furthest corner. He picks up one. It says,
At the table, he leaned his arm against Hermione's, hand brushing against the side of hers, strangely craving her warmth. He could still feel the cold press of Malfoy's hand against his own, and suddenly all he wanted was to scrub it clean. He felt fine, he told himself. He was fine. Maybe Malfoy had performed some sort of accidental magic, something inconsequential.
And then Smith shoves at his chest, knocking his breaths out of his lungs. He collides hard to the back of the armchair with the force of it, a voice yelling, distant and detached from his mind. "Answer me!"
"Tell you a secret?" Draco said, smiling slightly.
she'd written.
"I'll tell you, okay?" Malfoy said, his voice low and earnest, staring up from beneath his lashes with a quiet sort of pleaful persuasion, an expression that looked very out of place for him. Then again, Harry wasn't used to the sight of many expressions on that face, besides his typical sneer and deadpan, and nowadays, that awful, gutwrenching blank and lost one.  "I'll tell you everything. You just have to wait and be patient, Potter. It won't be long now. Can you do that?"
Hermione stands to her feet, her face thunderous with fury. She absorbs it quickly on a napkin and then slams her hands down on the table, rattling dishes and plates and spooking everybody at the Gryffindor table. Ginny shouts at the Great Hall to shut up, so that Hermione can rip into the anonymous perpetrator in the utter silence that has taken place.
Draco hummed. "Frankly, I'm feeling quite alright with that," he said.
"What's got you in such a mood?" Draco asks, the edge of a laugh in his chest.
It was him he thought of. Just him. Lying on that hospital bed, Draco's head was so full of him
"I see," Malfoy said, finally, softly. He put his drink away, lips flicking to taste the drink on them, and then he rose from his seat. "Well then, that is that. I shall see you out."
"I do," Harry said. "I want them."
Thank you for reading! And thank you very much to everybody that took the time to share their thoughts and kind feedback 💙 it was fascinating and lovely to read through it
Harry stares at him. He shakes his head. "No. You don't understand. When I say
She would settle against Draco's side, show him all the pictures she took of wildlife throughout the world, or just lean against his shoulder while he slept, holding his hand, either entirely silent or speaking to Harry in murmurs so as to not disturb his rest. When he was awake, she would lie against his side and tell him all about the different magical creatures she had come across, both terrestrial and aquatic.
"...Dear?"
"And you still got with me," Ginny says. "You… you knew you were in love with… with him, and you were
Harry had laughed. He loves them, but he doesn't mind hanging around on his own sometimes. He may have had, once, soon after having found his first makeshift family, after the Dursleys and after eleven years of having nobody, but now some part of him welcomes the liberty of solitude.
"And what else were we supposed to do then?" Harry asked, trying to sound controlled, to keep his voice low and calm. "I wasn't going to just sit there knowing I'd be stuck to you for decades and do nothing about it! Would you rather we'd have taken no chances at all to better our circumstances, then? Just twiddle our thumbs waiting for something that would never come up? This was
In the moment that follows, his mind works over a decision, and then settles with certainty. Harry looks up at Draco, a quirk of a smile at his lips. "Well. I'll be staying here too."
"But I think we made something good out of it," Draco said. "In the end."
"We're on fairly good terms." Harry grins. "I'd even say we're friends now."
but just sounded like 'woom'.  "Just make sure you stay low and have a good hold on him."
"Blaise Zabini." He then leaned in, murmuring to her so that others wouldn't hear. "I haven't got tickets. Sorry. But I've got Harry Potter with me—" Her eyes widened, glancing over at Harry with that awful, awed and starstruck expression he could never get used to. "And I imagine he doesn't need them. He loves the Colovaria, you know, but unfortunately, the tickets were sold out before he could get them. I'm sure you can do something about that? I mean, it's the least he deserves after everything, don't you think? Getting to see his favourite band here in the city, having a fun afternoon to himself with his good friend?"
Draco's jaw tightens.  "This isn't working."
"So you're
I hope you're all safe, well and healthy 💙
His beautiful Harry.
"Ah. No. Definitely not." Harry clears his throat, a flush running up his neck. "I don't want to relive that mortifying event every day for the rest of my life, thank you."
"No really," Draco's saying, edging on a nervous huff of a laugh. "It's very cool. If you only saw it! But there's a lot I can't—"
"It is." Ron shrugged. "But I really doubt it's anything to worry about, yeah?"
Harry stared at him for a moment. What did it even matter?
On the canvas was an outline of a face, black hair, a scruff of a beard. The eyes were painted in, only the edges of the face filled in, shaded in darker colours that faded into lighter, uneven tones of oil paint. There was a smirking mouth, a radiant, easy mischief about the man.
"I did," Harry insisted upon seeing the astonished expression, his chest growing heavy at Malfoy's incredulity. "We should do this again."
had given him in a way he hadn't the first night, when he could only bring himself to touch him but not look at him properly.
a lot of things these days."
"Why the
In the silence that follows, Draco thinks of his dreams again, of waking up that day in a hospital bed. Some days are bad enough that it's hard to be sure, that he won't just wake up somewhere else again, somewhere better, somewhere worse.
Harry moved again only when he was sure, only when he didn't think it would hurt him, lifted Draco in his arms and carried him back to their bed.
"I'm afraid that's not something I can answer," Healer Francine said, still in that soft, sympathetic voice. "With bonds like these, particularly emotional ones... it's very hard to say."
Draco places his suitcase at his feet and steps forward into her hands, his throat burning. He lets his mother's palms cup his cheeks, her thumbs brushing over the apples of them and under his eyes, lets her kiss his face all over, lets her weep against the side of it soundlessly after. He holds her, buries his nose into the shoulder of his mother's dress and almost feels small again, almost like he's seven years old and not older than seven decades, when nothing had ever happened to them.
The look on Draco's face, the flutter of a blink in his eyes from the startlement, before they crinkled slightly from a flicker of a soft smile quirking at his lips, made Harry smile too, thumbing the corner of his mouth.
life. Did these people have nothing better to do?
to him (but he'd meant everything to him somewhere now).
Draco doesn't say anything, is only breathing shallow and slow, staring at him.
Draco gets accepted into Hogwarts as a Potions Professor. He moves into Grimmauld Place with Harry not long after, where the floo connects to the school. It stops being Harry's home alone, and it becomes theirs, and Draco being there only makes it feel more like his own.
Draco's throat convulses again, his eyes roving down from Harry's eyes, over his nose, onto his mouth. His expression has taken on a shade of emotion, something desperate and raw and just as hungry, maybe even more, reigned back. The last song at the party has ended, changed to another, a distant echo. There's laughter somewhere afar, the rise of a muffled hubbub outside, and in hardly a voice, Harry's saying to him, "I'm going to kiss you now, okay?"
"Yeah," Ron said, very uncomfortably.
And then Malfoy broke out into laughter, open and free and uncontained. Even despite the lack of air, which made his laughter soundless, he laughed and laughed, relieved and amused. His white-blonde head was thrown back until it touched the wall and he was slipping down against it as he shook, and Harry hadn't seen him laugh as much as he did today
Draco tosses him a glance, pausing. Then, a hum, affirmative and soft. He sits up, takes his shirt off.
Draco has both his hands on the paper, and by the time the class has gone quiet, his eyes stop alternating between going everywhere and glancing at his paper, and is now just focused on his paper. Harry can't say what it is that he feels upon seeing him — an inexplicable kind of endearment and tenderness, seeing him be so human.
"I don't want him," he said to the room. Only the music coming from the drawing room, distant and echo-like, came back to him.
He heated the kettle full of boiling water in the kitchen, made her tea as she liked it, and sat down on the sofa, handing it to her.
"It's not about that. I just… don't like mysteries." It was the truth, in a way, or not, depending on how it was seen. The wording was just ambiguous. Harry tried to uncover every mystery he came across because he hated not knowing, and he certainly hated not knowing right now. Even so, Harry knew he was being irrationally paranoid, but could he be blamed? Malfoy had never even liked him all these years.
In the blur of a world tuning out of his senses, the hushed chorus of sound around them, he found himself saying, softly, "You look beautiful."
"Back to yell at me some more for absolutely no reason?" he drawled, a curl at his mouth.
In the Fourth Chapter, Draco is rescued by Harry, Ron and Hermione, but remains comatose due to the potion and is on the verge of death.
He caught Draco's eyes, who roved them over his body with an appreciative quirk of his lips. Harry huffed out a shy grin, shaking his head.
He doesn't say anything more. She waits for a moment, and then nods, her lips squinched. Then she lets him go six minutes early.
Only, when he does try dating other people, it doesn't work no matter how smart and funny and attractive they are because none of them are the right kind of smart and funny and attractive and none of them have the right accent or the right voice or the right shade of silver eyes and white-blond hair and none of them — none of them are him.
The silence came over them, hollow and long. Draco was staring at him, brows deeply knitted together.
"Come on, Draco, just go back to bed," Harry said. Draco did not budge from his place, lips pressed together. "Please?"
His eyes landed beside her, on her son.
Harry eyed him, swallowing. Draco shouldered past him.
Harry didn't know what he wanted, but he knew becoming an Auror wasn't it. Eventually he decided to open a book shop in the wizarding districts of London called
. He had sat across booths from him, him under the fall of morning light through cafe windows, absolutely quiet, and all he could think was,
"Yeah. I just — you know. He's been helping me study for the NEWTs," is what Harry says, the first thing that comes to mind that might make sense to Ron. Ron's face is unreadable, and he looks down at the board, moving his piece. There's a pause. Another turn passes by, Harry's, and then it goes back to Ron. "Ginny was talking about you the other day."
Pansy looks down at him, bewildement at first, and then sadness, and Draco doesn't know what he looks like, just that he sounded awful. He knows her, and he knows she wants to ask him a million things about that, but he loves her for not asking anything at all. She squeezes his hand, the one still holding hers, whispering, "Oh, darling."
They found that the bond was hardly much of a presence anymore, after getting what it wanted, because they could stay away from each other for hours without it acting up now, but he'd made such a habit of being close to Draco that he felt strange without him anyway. Finding Draco at home once they'd returned from visits to their families, kissing each other and putting their hands under each other's shirt to get at skin, told Harry he wasn't the only one, the two of them laughing in a bashful amusement into each other's lips.
Harry kicked his trunk as Draco shut the front door behind him, and then opened it. So; he’d half moved in. He looked through his trunk – fitted with an expanding charm – and groaned. He really regretted just throwing everything in there. He pulled the tangled mass of his clothes out and put them on the bed, followed by his bag of quidditch gear. He mounted his broom holder above the fireplace and suspended his broom there. He pulled the photo album out and placed it carefully on his bedside table, along with the few remaining vials of the Essence that he had left; he doubted that he would need these any more, but it was better to be safe than sorry. A framed picture from New Years Eve sat in the bulk of his bedding that he had brought; Hermione had snapped a muggle photograph of Harry, Draco, Ron and George when they were drunk. It was not a great photograph – the framing was wonky, it was slightly out of focus and only Draco was looking at the camera. Though it was not a particularly well taken photograph, Harry loved it. They were sat on a sofa at Grimmauld Place; Ron had one arm around Harry, who had his hand on Draco’s thigh, and George sat in front of the sofa, his head flung back in laughter. That was the one thing in this photograph that made Harry smile – the true, authentic, hysteric, drunken laughter that they all sported in this picture. Ron held a glass of mead that threatened to spill on George’s head, and Draco wore a party hat, though it sat at a jaunty angle on his blonde hair. The top button of his shirt was undone, and his tie was loose. Harry thought that Draco looked simply divine with his flushed cheeks and huge grin. That would be hung on the picture hook for sure.
Harry and Draco finally talk...
“So what time were you thinking, div?” Harry smiled as he watched Draco run a hand through his hair.
Harry took hold of Draco’s hand, “Come with me.”
He packed his trunks carefully, selecting a mix of wizarding clothes and muggle clothes and handled with care his old Gryffindor scarf that he still wore on occasion. He felt a pang of loneliness. Hermione and Ron were happily married, living together with their big family. Hermione was well on her way to becoming the youngest Minister for Magic, and Ron was a surprisingly successful Auror. Harry smiled, knowing that his friends were doing well, but resented their busy career choices as they had little time to see each other like they used to.
Draco nodded, “delightfully so,”
Harry laughed and Hermione put her wand away. Ron opened the door again cautiously, and opened it fully when he saw that the boggart had gone. He disappeared into the room and Harry and Hermione made their way back to their spot in front of the fire.
Malfoy shifted in his seat slightly, “I get it,” his voice was low and quiet, he rested his elbows on his knees and looked down at the floor, “I used to get all sorts thrown at the Manor after father and mother were sent to Azkaban. I couldn’t leave without someone trying to hurt me or shouting vile things at me in the street. I used some of my savings to set up the shop, but for months I only had a little bit of business. I knew that it wasn’t because of my products and potions, but because of who I was, because of the things I’d been made to do. It was awful, Harry, people wouldn’t give me time of day.”
Their office was dingy and cluttered from work. Harry’s desk sat facing the door and the internal windows, looking out over the constantly busy bullpen; Draco’s desk sat under these internal windows, facing Harry’s, meaning that Harry had to look at Malfoy’s ugly mug all day. One of the walls was full of books, casefiles, paperwork, awards, trinkets, and whatnot; the other blank wall was their evidence board - currently full of conjured red string and all the notes they had on the case they were to start. Malfoy, Harry learned, was very visual, he figured things out through sticking them to the board and staring at them for hours on end. This annoyed Harry to no end, as he preferred to have things all over the place until they fit together and provided an answer. It amused Harry, however, when he learned that Malfoy was just as messy as he was: their office was a harmonised chaos of work.
“You’d better cover that neck before your lessons tomorrow,” she smiled, “I suggest a high collar.”
Morning all! I hope you've all had a pleasant day - mine has been rather hectic at work now that we have to close at 10pm, and good lords, all I want to do is sleep forever.
“Training for the Ballet, Malfoy?” Harry smirked and winked at him. Draco laughed to himself – trust Harry to remember that from years ago.
” he muttered and picked up the paperwork, ordered it, and put it in the outbox on the wall. It disappeared with a quiet whooshing sound, straight to the records office.
There was a general agreement of “everything is under control” and so he sat near the fire with Kreacher and shared a pot of tea with him. Harry greeted Molly with a big hug, and Arthur clapped Harry on the back. They took it in turns to watch the Turkey.
“Erm… thanks.” He replied. He
She raised her eyebrows, “Aren’t we all?”
Harry snaked a hand down, over Draco’s pale chest towards his boxers. He pulled at the waistband and raised an eyebrow when he felt the black silk between his fingers. Draco smiled sheepishly and Harry kissed him back, slowly working his hand under Draco’s boxers.
“I just wanted to pop by,” Draco lied, “I needed some peace and quiet.”
Draco sucked his teeth and clenched his jaw, he looked up to the ceiling and put his mug on the desk quite forcefully, “
Harry shook his hand firmly, and nodded, “Thank you for coming, I’ve really loved having you here.” He smiled.
“Right?” Harry said, not seeing what Ron was getting at.
?” Draco laughed, breathless with effort. He sat next to Harry on the bed and waited for his heart rate to calm a bit.
Harry approached him, and put his hand on Draco’s shoulder, “They are good people. They’re not going to hold you to account for your actions twelve years ago when you’ve been through so much yourself. They understand, Draco.”
Harry had no control over the pants and moans that left him. Draco’s technique was flawless. He took his tongue the full length and sucked slowly but hard on Harry’s head. It was excruciatingly hot. Draco’s hands rested on Harry’s hips, kneading his skin and clawing him. Harry thrust gently into Draco’s mouth, working with him to make himself feel good. Soon enough Harry felt the familiar ache of a rising orgasm. He pulled Draco’s head up to his and kissed him violently as Draco stroked him until he came all over, pools of come jetting all over them both. Draco carried him on through the aftershocks until Harry couldn’t take it anymore.
kind of night?” He asked Malfoy, and eyed him suspiciously.
He sat in the chair and looked, annoyed, at the fireplace. He grimaced and shed yet another layer, this time taking off his smart suit jacket, and loosening his tie slightly, “Merlin it’s hot in here.” he complained.
“Stand still.” Harry said as he stroked himself. His voice was rough with lust, as he watched Draco. Their eyes gazed at each other’s bodies, really appreciating them.
Ron rolled his eyes, “Seamus and I, we’ve been working on this case for weeks – there’s a bunch of dark wizards practicing in Yorkshire and we’ve been slowly disbanding everything they’ve been doing. It’s taken weeks and weeks of painstaking work but we’ve finally got ‘em on their knees.”
Pansy rolled her eyes, planted a kiss on Draco’s cheek and sauntered through the crowd and sat by the bar to get a better view of the whole club. The lights dimmed, and a slow song began playing. The next dancer took to the stage, and it seemed like most eyes were on her. Ron, Harry and Draco were left at the table, they were among the few who were not interested in watching this dance.
She looked almost exactly the same, just older. She was still slender, tall, and somewhat bookish looking. Her hair had calmed down, it was no longer frizzy and unruly, and on her left hand she wore a simple wedding band.
“That is how the Ministry works, Ronald.” She smiled and stroked his hair.
Draco crawled on top of Harry, their naked bodies holding each other tightly as they kissed frantically. Draco took both of their cocks in his hand and stroked them together. Both Harry and Draco groaned with the feeling. Draco peppered Harry’s neck with light kisses and possessive bites, and Harry couldn’t help but let frenzied moans escape his mouth and Draco worked him – there really was nothing that turned him on more than Draco stroking him. Harry let his hands explore Draco’s divine body, feeling his deft muscles moving under his skin; feeling the beads of sweat starting to form at the nape of his neck, his soft blonde hair starting to get damp. Harry brought his head up to the crook of Draco’s neck and inhaled his scent - he swore that he smelled different during sex – and then grazed his teeth over his strong shoulder. Draco winced and then chuckled to himself; he liked it. Draco focused his attention on Harry, neglecting his own pleasure for a moment – he wanted to make Harry fall apart.
Harry took his hand and squeezed it tightly, “Are you okay?” he looked at his own large pile guiltily.
They sat in a busy silence until the paperwork was done. Harry stood up from his desk, shrugging off his thick jacket and hanging it on a coat stand shoved into the corner of the room.
“I was going to write a letter to Hermione, to see if I can influence the Ministry to introduce a scheme so that people like you – like us – could get it at potions shops for free with a card or a pass or something.” Draco explained.
Harry has a hangover as the two begin their investigations... and it takes them somewhere wholly unexpected!
Harry straightened out the blankets on his settee and moved one of his Gryffindor jumpers out of view. He wasn’t sure that he wanted Malfoy to see that he still had reminders of his school times hanging around.
At one point, Draco had to talk some students out of using a Weasleys Wizards Wheezes product on their unsuspecting friend, and threatened them with detention. Harry eyed him, biting his lip in anticipation of what was to come. Draco shot him pained glances, clearly, he just wanted to be alone with Harry too. Frustrated didn’t even begin to cover how they felt right now. Harry eventually managed to sneak away and almost ran to Draco’s room. Shortly after he was met by a breathless Draco. He rolled his eyes as he saw Harry and shook his head, “Bloody students,” he sighed, “It’s almost like this is a school or something.” He chuckled as he hastily unlocked his door. They both went in and shut out the noise of students.
Harry was uncomfortable with this. Yes, that usually meant that it was going well – so why did he shy away from it? Why did the thought of it make him shudder? Draco cleared his throat and stood by the burner, waiting for the kettle to boil. Harry watched him for a brief few moments. He stood tall, proud, and stoic against the light from the fire and the many candles charmed about the room. He was supremely well dressed even now late on a Saturday night, his suit was well cut and his snowy hair was perfectly done. Draco peered into the kettle, checking the water, his elegant hands seeming to not feel the heat of the cast iron kettle. Harry still couldn’t quite believe that Draco had had such an emotional outburst about Harry’s date. He imagined Draco being with someone else for a moment or two and felt a stirring of something deep in his stomach.
Harry’s bedroom at Grimmauld place lay in a heavy, satisfied silence on Christmas morning. He hadn’t needed his Essence of Tranquillity to sleep easy for Draco laid in his arms for the entire night. Harry stroked Draco’s back and kissed his skin lightly until he woke gradually. Draco murmured in his sleep but eventually opened his grey eyes, he smiled when he saw Harry and pulled him closer to him. He held Harry tightly, his arms snaking up around Harry’s back and his long pale fingers knotting in Harry’s unruly hair. Harry loved being held like this by Draco.
“If you say Granger, I will hex you,” Draco rolled his eyes, “I’m just as smart as she is.”
Malfoy wondered to himself what the night would have in store.
“Mr Potter,” she said, timidly, “Mr Potter are you okay?”
Harry raised an eyebrow, “
Stay safe, let me know if you want more xx
“What’s going on?” Harry asked and moved to an armchair that was closer to them. Ron turned to look at Harry, his mouth slightly open in shock.
‘You must be thinking too loud then, prick. I can hear the cogs turning from here’, Draco thought to himself. Harry was still not the shiniest cauldron in the set but somehow, he got results.
Draco nodded, and flicked the cigarette end over the balcony wall, where it disappeared in a small flash. Wizarding cigarettes, Harry smiled to himself, designed to always vanish when discarded.
Harry sat at the desk in his classroom, marking essays from before Christmas, and thinking about what Draco had said. Well, he didn’t explicitly say it, but he thought it. Harry twirled his quill in his fingers and thought about maybe asking Draco to move in with him at Grimmauld place, or maybe Draco wouldn’t mind moving his things into Harry’s room at Hogwarts? It was small but it would be worth it. Harry definitely wasn’t moving to Draco’s dark room, it was comfortable, but cold and had an odd feeling because it was so close to the dungeons. Harry thought about moving between the two rooms like they’d been doing before the Christmas break but it just wasn’t the same as having their own space together.
They danced, oh how they danced. Ron relished moments like this where he didn’t have to think about anything other than what to do with his hands. He contemplated shouting across to Harry that this was exactly what he needed, but Harry was too into dancing to think. His face had gone slack, a slight sheen of sweat glistened on his forehead, and it made Ron smile. He always relished seeing Harry relax, he worked far too much and lived life too intensely; seeing him relax had become a personal mission of Ron’s, he’d even once booked a massage for the three of them to try and get some of the tension out of Harry’s shoulders. It worked for maybe two weeks.
