Harry can't help but gives a fond smile when he looks up at the handsome irritated face. “Seems familiar, don't you think?”
Draco gasped at that, flabbergasted by the sudden change of event causing him to lose his balance and stumbled on his feet. He fell backwards, about to land on the dirty ground before an arm took a place around his waist and straightened him up. He was then pressed onto another body, the grip on his waist was strong and secure.
Draco moved his eyes away from the piercing green eyes to his children. “It was a dangerous thing to do; time travel. Scorpius said that they had to find three of my things from this time in order for them to get here.” He said, a bit proud of his children’s intelligence before he realised something. He gasped in horror as he turned to sought for Granger’s eyes.
After what seemed like half an hour waiting, Harry finally saw the top of Malfoy's white-blond head emerging from the stairs, and delighted to note that the male was alone. Harry grinned, feeling mischief when he saw Malfoy walked forward casually, not knowing what awaits him. By the time Malfoy was about four steps away to where he was hiding, Harry braced himself.
To be honest, he doesn't know what to feel. It felt like a sudden force blowing up at his face and he was not ready for it.
They waited until the door was closed, and let a few minutes passed by before they opened their eyes and looked at each other.
“I'm converting him, Granger.” sniffed Draco, trying to appear aloof. “Surely, you can see it yourself.”
“Henry.” whispered Draco, so soft, so delicate that he got Henry to gasp. Draco can't help but give the man a fond look. “We're going to be okay. You're going to save your husband and I know this because you're here, and you're going to save me. I won't leave you.”
“Oh, out with it!” Henry shouted, startling Harry making him blurted out; “I wanted to see if you're okay!”
What he remembered instead; crawling towards the body of his lover with all his might when his body gave up on him. He remembered the dimmed light of the grey eyes greeted him proudly. He remembered the slight tug of the lips he adored when he managed to reach him. He remembered the shaky long fingers that tried to caress his face for the last time.
Draco snapped his eyes to the entrance when his detector chimed, just in time to see his next target of assignment walked through the door confidently, and he appeared to be accompanied by two of his friends.
“You know,” Parkinson suddenly piped in, “Your papa never told us who's your Dad is.” She said, gesturing to her and Zabini but Harry saw her shared a look with Ginny.
McGonagall pursed her lips with a pinched look, “You were hoping that the both of you will get the help you've wanted by meeting with the younger version of your father?”
Harry turned to Malfoy, who was still looking up to him helplessly. “Are you okay? Did he touch you inappropriately?”
"Part of that, yes. Thank you for saving Ginny, but I really do want to see your condition." said Harry, smiling.
They looked into each other's eyes and with a nod, Scorpius began the incantation and Albus followed. They recited the spells over and over again, overlapping each other's voices until a soft glow emerged through the possessions, creeping towards their bodies, seeping through their clothes and skins. The lights were becoming brighter and brighter around them, and Albus quickly held onto Scorpius’ hand when they felt the pressure of air pressing from all directions, sucking their bodies into thin air leaving two wands clucking innocently down the floor.
Potter doesn't need to fall in love. He was already is. He was already in love with Ginevra Weasley. It made sense now. The way Potter seemed too casual no matter how much Draco had flirted with him. He was too carefree, calling Draco his Sweetheart and all that. No wonder he doesn't blink an eye when Draco gave him kisses on his cheek.
The soft hand moved down to his nape like a butterfly, giving them a gentle squeeze as they went further to his shoulder, and he frowned when he felt a continuous tap.
He squeaked and closed his eyes tightly, unintentionally tightening his grip on Henry's face. He felt Henry's hand mirrored his action by tightening their grip on his thigh, calluses palm brushing his skin that got him to moan, legs trembling involuntarily making him lose his balance and stumbled into Henry's lap.
Harry gaped, taken aback by Malfoy's outburst before he snapped out and growled. Stupid Malfoy. He took a step forward towards the other male and something must've been painted on his face as Malfoy squeaked, took out his wand quickly pointed to himself as he chanted a spell and turned invisible in an instant right in front Harry.
Malfoy casted his eyes down at that, and Harry had to tilted his head up just to have those grey eyes back on him.
“Ouch,” Draco covered a hand to his heart, faking a devastated look with a tiny drop of his disappointment slipped on his face before he smoothed them out with a teasing smile. “Then I'll just have to keep trying.”
His heart beating loudly that he was afraid it'll burst out of his chest. Doubled, when there was a sudden sound from the door startling him so bad that it got him to fall off his bed. He quickly climbed on, diving under his covers and fake a sleep just in time as the door was opened.
Harry frowns as he unconsciously runs towards the crowd, pushing his way to the front when the scene in front of him almost send him into a heart attack.
He observed as the three men walked towards the bar, pleased to see that they were walking right towards Ginevra and her companions. When Harry was about a step away from Ginevra, Draco instantly waved his hand discreetly, and the effect was almost immediate when Ginevra suddenly stumbled off her seat right into Harry's arms who quickly caught her, hands dropped onto her shoulder and waist as he helped her up to her feet, giving Ginevra an amused smile. Ginevra appeared to be flustered, as she straightened up and Draco quickly snapped his fingers when their eyes meet, grinning when he saw his magic working right under their nose, making the two human locked their eyes in a dazed way, no doubt they were captivated by each other.
It was almost curfew, they sat themselves near the fireplace of the common room, having what Hermione called, ‘brainstorming'. The temperature was getting colder by the day, and whilst Ron and Hermione shared a blanket, Harry warmed himself by wearing layered clothing. If the way his friends huddled together in a comfortable manner reminded Harry of his single status, he decided to take comfort in his possible relationship with his anonymous Slytherin.
Shivers ran through Draco’s spine as a deep voice whispered down to his ear, hot breath tickling his skin. He carefully gazed up; eyes widened to see it was Harry who had his arm around him, and his body involuntarily gave a startled jolt at that.
Ron had been trying awfully hard to be solemn that night out of respect for his friend, who had just fallen several hundred feet out of the sky (although, that must've been about the fifth time Harry had landed himself in the hospital wing, so it was rather difficult to be appropriately concerned). When Seamus had started groaning and having ostensible nightmares over various lunching items, he'd given up altogether.
Heart positively swelling, Harry takes Draco’s fluttering hand and presses a kiss to his knuckles. “You’d really come and live with me?”
Draco exhales through his teeth. “How long is a piece of string,” he says. Pale clouds shift and Harry looks exhausted in the moon’s full light. He turns his eyes back to the castle’s silhouette, the skeleton of the ruined Hall.
and towards him. Draco whimpers softly as Harry kisses each of his knuckles, twice, and presses them to the wall beside his head. The lights have changed again; dusky pinks and yellows. They turn the grey of Draco’s eyes warm.
Draco puts the joint in his mouth but only pretends to inhale, then hands it back to Harry. “There’s only one you should know,” he says.
"I said two fucking sentences to her!" Draco shoots back, deciding to let the inbred comment go (mostly because it's, um, kind of true). "And they were statements of fact. Whatever Granger's inferred from that clearly has more to do with you than it does with me."
Draco pulls himself up on his elbows, so he's leaning out of the bath and water sloshes over the lip and Pansy glares at him for getting it on her shoes. "Pansy," he says. "No."
Malfoy looked up. Harry thought maybe he hadn’t even realised who it was that was standing over him. “Potter,” said Draco, and stretched his legs back out.
Harry smirks, both at the callback itself and the blatant exaggeration of his accent. "I don't know what I am," he says, and he means it as a global sentiment. More and more lately he feels like he knows nothing about himself. "I know I wanna fuck you again if you'd quit being such a brat about everything."
," Harry bites out, and there goes his attempt at getting himself under control. He's still thinking about that navel ring and even worse than that, having Malfoy consistently drawing attention to it is actually making his cock harder. Death sounds amazing. "I'm not sure that qualifies as
After a few moments of waiting and contemplating a strategy, Harry says, "It's okay to miss them. They're your parents."
And number three: Granger’s boyfriend is the Weasel, and her best friend is Harry Potter. And Draco has known for twelve years, give or take, that any friend of Harry Potter’s is not a friend of his.
Harry walks back down the steps and stops just above him, still frowning and at the same time just beginning to acknowledge something low in his stomach that he can identify perfectly fine, except of course that it’s attributed to Malfoy right now. And that’s confusing for a lot of reasons.
He swallows noisily, eyes back on Malfoy’s mouth with its too-pink lips, and the long, slender throat below it. He doesn’t understand what Malfoy’s doing, why he’s not run out of here in a strop yelling about perverted Gryffindor heroes and their ill-timed erections.
“You know, Harry,” says Hermione, and he braces himself for whatever harsh truth is forthcoming (Ron shoots him a sympathetic grimace), “sometimes I can’t believe how much you’ve grown up when I see you working so hard on a case, going to meetings and doing paperwork and being professional in interviews.” She purses her lips then, looking uncomfortably like McGonagall. “And then Draco comes over for a nice,
When Blaise asks Draco whether he'll be coming to Venus in the evening, Draco says yes. When Blaise asks Draco if he would like a cocktail, and then another, Draco says yes. When they're in one of the five private rooms on the mezzanine, and Blaise is lamenting the quality of his coke in recent weeks, and Pansy is fishing a cigarette stick out of her corset, Blaise asks Draco if he wants a quick fuck, and Pansy says; yeah, and can I stay? Draco says no, and
“Yeah.” He leans back against a counter and looks at Ron, arms crossed, brows raised, knowing why he’s here and wondering if he’ll let Harry keep dodging around it. “Too bad he’s shit at repairing all my glass he’s broken.”
Harry sighs again, and releases his temples. “Right. So you spent I-don’t-think-I-want-to-know-how-many Galleons for an I-don’t-think-I-want-to-know-how-illegal Charms specialist to come and replicate an stupidly complex, potentially dangerous ancient Mirroring Charm on your living room ceiling, because you want to look at the stars, and it’s too cold to go outside.”
“Sorry,” Harry snorts, moving his hand back down to Draco’s thigh. Draco bites his lip. Harry notices.
It’s like the old Malfoy went to France and a new one came back, one that he absolutely cannot get a reading on. Although to be fair, he supposes, maybe he never really had a reading on Malfoy in the first place. He tries to remember the last time he was alone with him and thinks, with a jolt, that it was sixth year in that bathroom.
“No.” Malfoy is rather preoccupied. Evidently the shots are part of a larger scheme which involves. Erm. Leaning back on bars (Malfoy) and slurping tequila from exposed navels (dark-haired bloke).
Harry's hands go automatically to Draco's waist, eyebrows raising at the bull-headedness of what he says, which seems so highly unlike him. Still, he can't help grinning a little. "It's not even March," he points out, "you still have four months to get sick of me and change your mind."
Hermione frowns. Something about the phrasing doesn't sit right with her, and her dislike for Pansy heightens.
The words hit Harry like a train, nearly knocking the wind out of him. For a moment all he can do is stare at Draco, processing, heart beating fast and hard. He’s come abstractly to an understanding inside his head that he doesn’t just
Harry tries not to be disappointed. He also tries to remind himself that it would have been stupid anyway, to let himself get carried away on New Years and shag Charlie. Fun to think about, but dumb. And unrealistic. Charlie’s like Ginny: they both have that dominating sense of logic that overrides even their strongest emotions and allows them to make good decisions in the heat of the moment.
Harry grabs them from the floor next to the bed and drops them on the bed in front of Draco. After pulling his own on and a shirt, he says, “Am I still manufacturing coincidences then? Or are we going to start setting dates?”
Sometimes when he can't sleep Harry pulls out the map. It's soothing, tracing paths through familiar corridors and seeing the names of sleeping students, staff who are awake and walking around, even Filch and Mrs. Norris. Sometimes he finds Hagrid wandering the grounds or clusters of ghosts who must be having gatherings. McGonagall never paces the office the way Dumbledore did.
“Don’t be such a lout, Draco,” Pansy scolds him gently through a smirk. “Dominique is quite useful and very good at her job. Now,” she crosses a leg lightly over the other and dangles a sharp stiletto from her foot, “out with it. Or I’ll send you on your way.”
Harry looks at him, searching his face, and then back out at the water. “No, I suppose you wouldn’t,” he muses. “That is unless you’re about to die in some cursed fire, obviously.”
“I see,” Narcissa says with a brave attempt at enthusiasm. It’s not that she doesn’t want to know, because she very much
“Alright,” he says. “You’ve got to come to Gryffindor with me and I’ll go get the cloak from my dorm and come back out and sneak you in. Good?”
Besides, he’s not sure that would be completely honest of him. If Draco’s a refined-kind-of-asshole, Potter’s an extremely crude one. He wears his emotions without discretion — it’s part of what’s always made him so fun to fuck around with. Draco could practically see Potter debating whether or not to throw his coat back in his face (he’s glad he didn’t. The wool really is very delicate). Anyway.
"I dunno how Ginny does it. It'd be too weird for me," he says. "I thought Harry was doing the Malfoy thing again. A reprisal act. You talk him out of that finally?"
“I shall hold you to that,” Draco says. “A minute later, and I’ll have to take her with me to Blaise’s club. I’m expected at five past.”
They kiss; hot and inelegant exchanges of breath, Harry bites and Draco nips, delicate skin rolled between teeth and tongues slipping to lap at collar bones and low, throaty groans running over breathless whines.
Number one: Granger is nice. In an earnest, unflinching, I’m-going-to-be-pleasant-to-you-whether-you-like-it-or-not kind of way, and Draco is not friends with nice people. He’s friends with Pansy, who calls him ‘you
“It wasn’t when he was fucking me,” says Draco, and he’s getting especially snippy in the way he always does when he’s tired. “By that stage, I was already sort of— actually no, for fucks sake, Pansy. I didn’t
Draco’s tongue traces his bottom lip. “If you don’t do it right now,” he says, “I may have to hex you a bit.”
The tapenade is unfortunately very good, something Ron seems to have realised based on how much of it he’s eaten. He keeps shooting glares at Malfoy, as if he resents enjoying it, and Harry joins him in tossing casual insults Malfoy’s way while he and Hermione descend deep into their academic discussion. Which is actually sort of interesting, only Harry would rather die than admit that.
“Hm? Oh. Well, you asked how we got here,” says Draco. He twists himself around so Harry can see one of his eyes (grey, heavy lidded) and the patrician construction of his profile.
“Right,” he says. He stands and offers his hand out to help Charlie up as well. “S’pose we should probably go back. Your mum’s gonna be pissed.”
It's ironic, because after sixth year, he'd decided that the tower, along with Myrtle's bathroom, was to be avoided with utmost dedication. However, it's been brought to his attention since then (rather unceremoniously, and on multiple occasions) that he's somewhat of a coward. Of course, it's nothing Draco hasn't thought of himself before, but he also thinks his skin tone makes him look like a sickly medieval twink, and according to Pansy (who is brutally honest) it doesn't. So, there's that.
Harry lifts his eyebrows when Malfoy pulls a cigarette out, surprised and rather amused, particularly by the Muggle lighter. "That was Jekyll's big mistake," he says, "thinking morals had absolutes. We all have good and bad tendencies, you can't neatly separate them into two ... I dunno, distinct personalities." He pauses, then adds, "Not really sure what the significance of the missing ingredient was, but it was a good plot twist."
, but doesn’t. He just says, “Guess I’ll see you round, then,” and gathers up his coat before stepping back into the Floo.
“Question,” says Harry, groaning softly with the effort of pulling his gaze from Draco’s arse. “What was the question?”
It’s not at all unexplored territory for Draco, but the fact that it’s Harry pressing down on his throat makes it feel entirely different. It
"I dunno, do I? He's so ..." Pointy? Prickly? Interesting and impossible and unobtainable and kind of really nice-looking? "I dunno. Like I said, it doesn't matter. He's not interested in figuring anything out between us. There's too much history."
Nodding again, Hermione sets the liquor aside (mostly untouched) and stands. "Great. Well, thank you for inviting me here to talk. It was nice seeing you, Pansy. I'm sure we'll see one another again at some point. Is your Floo connected to the hospital?"
Like one of those oil paintings with the perpetual tilt to their chin and narrowed lids, but painted in soft, gentle strokes so the skin looks smooth and the hair kind of gauzy and soft. No. Malfoy's probably more of a sculpture. Angular and carefully made. A marble one with one of those velvet ropes around it and a sign that says ‘
“Yeah. Fuck,” Harry says, nuzzling against Draco’s neck, by the hand that still rests there. Draco’s knuckles are pressed into his chest, and Harry feels the fine bridge of his nose against his flushed cheek. "It was so hot, Draco. You’re so fucking hot.”
.” She meets his eye again and smiles. Reaches to place her hand over his. “You know I appreciate you being here, Draco. I’ve prepared your favourite for tomorrow, you know.”
He likes that he sometimes doesn’t understand Draco’s jokes, and that on occasion, his sarcasm is so profound that Harry really can’t tell whether he’s being serious or not. He likes it when Draco says something awfully dry, and he has a feeling that he’s just been insulted, but can’t be quite sure.
Harry wonders when he became such a deviant. Then he laces his fingers over Draco’s, and tongues determinately at his rim.
Harry,” and then hugged him (or at least tried), and then told him something else helpful and profound and soothing. Hermione’s good, like that. Ron never has been.
It’s when Draco’s utterly incoherent nonsense dissolves into nothing that Harry pulls his mouth off with a pop. Draco bucks upwards, keening desperately, murmuring into the crook of his own elbow. Harry can’t even fucking
“Ah,” says Draco. He turns the worn parchment over in his hand, ink bleeding into gossamer fine threads around the lettering. “So your true namesake is ‘Prongs’? How idiosyncratic.”
feel, so the point seems rather moot. And he's tired. And pissed off, but that he's saving for Malfoy next time he sees him.
Once he's de-booted and de-coated, he goes to the kitchen where Klaus starts rubbing him again and Harry scoffs.
I usually am," Harry says facetiously, though almost out of habit his hand goes to his hair in yet another fruitless attempt to flatten it. He's
“Likewise, Mother,” Draco says. “There’s not much to tell,” because he’d sooner move back into the Manor and Lucius’s private wing than tell his mum that Potter sort-of-fucked him in a lift, and everything else that’s happened since.
has the loudest fucking mouth I've ever seen," he continues in a lower voice. "She's the same one who tried to sell me out to Voldemort, remember that? You really had to tell
“Potter,” she says jovially. Her heels come to a clicking halt beside him. “Granger. Weasel. Lovely ... really lovely. You’ve all been well, I hope?”
("It's like he won't break up with her for his own pride," Hermione said, around a year and a half in. Harry had been very stormy when he arrived after dinner, with big, dark circles under his eyes. He kept cracking his neck, and said it was hurting because he'd slept on the couch. He caught their look at that, and stormed out again without even drinking his tea.
However, tonight Seamus has suggested Truth or Dare, which astonishingly none of the students brought up in the Wizarding world have even heard of.
However, now the problem was that whenever he saw Draco, the only thing that went through his mind was usually something along the lines of, “Does he really have an arse that could cause an eclipse if he bent over?” which was usually immediately followed by the intrusive and unwanted thought of “Holy fuck they were RIGHT, this is UNFAIR.” Harry is glad Draco doesn't know occlumency. He thinks Draco probably would too if he was aware of the situation.
The thirty seconds it takes for him to get across the common room are filled with suspicious stares and whispers that fly around the room like owls, surrounding him in an ocean of mistrust. Harry consoles himself with the thought of Draco’s arse, and then all is Gucci once more.
But, thinks Harry angrily as he throws down his books onto his bed, followed closely by himself, there is No Reason— absolutely No Reason that Pansy Parkinson should have any business knowing that Harry is Willing and Ready to suck Malfoy off on the floor in the middle of the sorting feast if Malfoy should so wish. NO reason.
“Is it really so hard,” continues Harry, deliberately moving closer and ignoring the little voice in his brain that’s currently frantically trying to backspace and sob and nervously tapdance at the same time, “to believe that I might want to spend time around you when we aren’t trying to kill each other?”
“Nothing gets past you, does it? No, it’s the exams, and he’s so fucking annoying; he won’t shut the fuck up for love nor money about how he only got seven on the eight marker and ninety three bastard percent on the herbology practice paper he got given. I’m going to kill him.”
“Draco,” gasps Hannah, once she and the rest of the room have finished killing themselves laughing at her recollection of the time that McGonagall accidentally walked in on her kissing an unidentified classmate in a storage cupboard and spent a week religiously avoiding cupboards and closets in general. Snape’s bewilderment when she made him go fetch some textbooks that were two feet away from her in her own cupboard was, in Hannah’s own words, “priceless”.
“Well, that’s called shipping and it can be done with any two people, and when you write a story about them as a couple it’s called fanfiction. There are loads of types of fanfiction, including-“
Eighth year is not in standard practise for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but what with the minor tizz of Voldemort returning and trying his best (which turns out to be pretty poor) to murder Harry Potter and most of the school while he was at it— eighth year seemed to be really the only way to go as far as achieving a half-decent set of qualifications to go out into the world with. And Harry Potter, along with the vast majority of his year has chosen to stay on. It’s a wise decision overall, although there is the occasional exception.
There’s a bit of a pause while the assorted audience of tiny girls and Harry all turn to stare at Malfoy who keeps trying to find a suitable parting for his white-blond hair. He stares back in confusion before something clicks and he looks horrified.
“Oh yes you stupid little gnats, I too think the sun shines out of his asshole and I do indeed share your opinions on his thighs and how you would pay him to crush your stupid little heads between them. God, it’s not like we’re worst
Harry moves closer still, and feels the tension being pulled tight like elastic in a hairbobble, pulled between them and threatening to snap at any moment.
‘Oh, Yeah, sir, I was just making out with Potter here and it occurred to me he’s probably under a spell’— oh fuck, what have I done—“
Harry is extremely busy gawping from Draco’s side, and Draco rolls his eyes, nods at Glasses Child before gesturing between him and Harry. Glasses Child smirks, and Draco wonders whether he’s in the timeline that God happened to abandon.
“Want a bet?” And he kisses him. Kissing Draco is new, sweet, a tantalising moment that could go any way. Then, the elastic snaps, and Draco’s lips are hot against his, pressing, desperate, searching for something back which Harry is more than happy to give. Harry winds his arms around Draco’s neck, brushes his fingers against the shorter hair at his neck and kisses him with all he has, the space that’s always been tangible between them closed at last and it’s clear that neither have any problem with this. They go down onto the double bed that Harry will discover later belongs to a rather furious Blaise Zabini with a creaking off bedsprings and a one Draco Malfoy giving Harry the full octopus.
Draco gets to his feet, and by the time he can open his mouth to collect some piss-poor explanation for his behaviour Harry is already gone, leaving nothing but the faint taste of cherries and a cold ache where Draco’s heart used to be.
All assembled students (those who didn’t fancy going to bed at half past seven like a few unnamed killjoys) gather around in what can’t honestly be described as a circle, some in armchairs and some preferring to just vibe by the roaring fire as Seamus hands out shot glasses to them all.
It all started when Pansy cornered Harry, you see. Harry has had a Problem with being cornered in the past, and he really should work on it, but unfortunately the only times he remembers this is when he has already been cornered and is far too upset about it to actually make time in his schedule to work on artfully Avoiding People. (This doesn’t matter. We move on.)
“There’s a group of girls in Slytherin House who are obsessed with you for no reason whatsoever and I would very much appreciate it if you could tell them to chill the fuck out. Oh, and also could you inform them whether or not you’re dating Granger because that’s a favourite subject of theirs and I’m fairly sure they’re going to hex her if they get themselves any more worked up about it.”
“Hey, Malfoy,” he says, attempting what he probably thinks is a friendly and not at all awkward smile.
So, students take it upon themselves to arrange ~entertainment~ for their rare nights off, mainly consisting of bitching sessions, tales of Who Put A Turd In Flitwick’s Pencil Drawer and that one glorious evening where Seamus burst in with the grand reveal that the house-elves brewed cherry gin in the kitchens and they were free to have it as they liked.
“No,” sighs Hermione, eyeing them all up over her copy of Feminism For Aspiring Witches. “If only it were.”
“Yeah,” he admits, and it comes out sounding slightly strangled. “Yeah, I want it.” I want you, he thinks, but can’t bring himself to say it out loud.
Harry wants to take a photo of Draco’s face and frame it. The expression only lasts a second, though, before his features mold themselves back into impassiveness and he leans back against the sofa. Just for a second, Malfoy catches his eye and then he blinks and it's gone as though he doesn’t even know he’s in the room. There’s dead silence in the room as Malfoy seems to mull it over.
any Muggle friends, but he knows Potter will probably get all self righteous about it, even though the reason is purely that his only friends are Pansy and Blaise. “Something like that,” he says, and flicks a page.
It’s the lip bite that makes Harry realise how hard he is, and when Malfoy steps even closer Harry’s drunk brain lets him act instead of think, pushing Malfoy back against the balustrade and panting into his mouth. He slides his hand under his shirt just enough to feel warm skin on his hip and breaks from his mouth as he does it to kiss down his jaw, stopping to suck lightly where it becomes his neck.
this, Potter. If they give me my magic back at the end of the school year, they’ll want me watched. House arrest with mother and father. If they don’t, I’ll still need to be supervised. House arrest, with mother and father. Or worse.”
He’d stepped closer before, now he steps back. Lets his words creep into the space between them. “You want me.”
"Please," says Draco, dropping his hand to the mattress with a hollow thump, "cease with the dramatics. You're twisting my words. I know you're serious, you dickhead, I just didn't know you were, you know, living together serious."
listening, actually, but this time she refrains from any teasing or talk of casual fucking. She knows Draco's having a very real internal struggle over this and she wishes more than anything she could do something concrete to help, but there isn't much short of paying Potter off to either corner Draco and fuck him or disappear to another country.
“I asked you to pour me a glass of wine, Potter, not ferment the grapes,” he says, getting up and draping himself against the kitchen doorway. Legs crossed, hip out so a little midriff shows at the hem of his shirt. Draco knows what he’s doing, even if he doesn’t know why.
It’s not a particularly verbose answer but technically that’s what Harry’s going for. The situation is completely surreal, which makes it a lot easier to give into what his body is telling him it wants and not think about all the fucking weirdness of it. He presses down harder for a moment before finally releasing and, while Malfoy’s looking slightly dazed (probably from lack of oxygen), he divests him of his trousers, compelled to press a kiss to his ankle, then his knee, then his thigh, and then the soft skin on his stomach. He doesn’t bother with his own any farther than he needs to in order to get his cock out. Lifting the leg he’d been kissing, he brings a hand to Malfoy’s arse and slides his fingers bluntly between his cheeks and across his hole, still slightly sticky with lube and — god, his face is hot — his own come.
Draco takes another pretend drag. In the far corner of the forest, something bursts from the trees and dives back down again. “Haven’t you heard, Potter? I’m no more a Black than you are. Nor a Malfoy, for that matter.”
almost bugged out of his head when he saw that bloke in the leather harness two seconds after making it through the door. Poor Ron. All red flags.
A shiver travels up Harry’s spine. He dry swallows and tells himself it doesn’t matter, his scar hasn’t so much as twinged, it’s just lingering Dark Magic, but his unthinking, highly-reactive, completely instinctive lizard brain recoils from the idea of
There's a monumental swell of fear and anxiety that climbs and peaks and then quickly recedes, leaving Harry breathing faster but otherwise okay. He sits down on a large log, lights a lantern and takes a joint from behind his ear, and as he puffs on it his eyes wander the forest floor, a small but not insignificant part of him looking for the shimmer of the Resurrection Stone even though rationally he knows it's gone for good, as it should be. As he'd promised Dumbledore, and himself. He thinks uneasily that if he saw his parents again, Sirius and Remus, he'd probably give up and stay here with them this time.
at my misfortune. It's unbecoming. I had dinner with Granger and the Weasel the other night, and Potter was there. Naturally, he was enraptured by the way I've grown into my fabulous looks, and I happened to notice. And, you know, point it out. Don't enfeeble me for not telling you earlier. You've been bloody busy this week."
He’s not exactly an expert or anything on reading Malfoy’s facial expressions (he remembers from Hogwarts that it was usually some variation on disdain anyway), but he fancies he sees something, some small intimation of hurt or offense or ... something. It doesn’t matter, he doesn’t care if he’s hurt Malfoy’s (highly ironically) delicate feelings. But it’s sort of interesting, in a fuck-Malfoy-and-his-delicate-feelings kind of way.
Draco quickly blinked to focus, and locked his eyes to a pair of green eyes similar to Scorpius. He swallowed as he slowly spoke, “They can't go back without three things from the future.”
Now that the twins were literally standing in front of him, he could finally see them up close; the matching set of faces with the same unruly hairs with opposite colours and cut, down to the colour of their eyes. Harry noted with surprise that Albus harbour the clear set of grey eyes, similar to Malfoy's and when he turned to the other twin, hoping to see exact copy of grey eyes, he was taken aback when his eyes met with a pair of green eyes instead. His eyes widened as he stood there with stupefaction and felt Hermione’s tight grip on his robe, he knew she saw it too.
The moment Draco saw his golden sparks of magic turned pink, he heaved a satisfied sigh. He watched as Ginevra shyly invited Harry to sit together, watched as they started to speak to one another, their companions also decided to merge together and Draco let them be. His magic was working on its own and he only needed them to be interested deeply enough to give each other a kiss because that was when Draco needed to shoot them with the arrow.
He continues to rock the baby gently in his arms, softly sings the nursery rhyme - now that he manages to recall - that was sung to him when he was a child himself.
"Yes," supported Scorpius, "Well, hopefully not anyway." he said with a small frown, peeking to his brother. "It's dad, after all."
"One way or another," shrugged Draco, but Harry can see a tiny lift of the corner of his lips. "I told him if he wanted my forgiveness, he better get his arse back to his dorm and keep his eyes on my sons- well, your sons."
"Blimey!" cursed Harry as he brought his leg as fast as he could towards the Great Hall. So much for trying to execute his plan early in the morning. He had slept too late that he overslept, and now he prayed to Merlin he was not too late for breakfast. Ron and the others were already gone the moment he woke up, and he sort of cursed them for leaving him.
“What's wrong?” he asked, and Ron bit his lips, tilting his head as he regarded Harry carefully enough to make him shift uncomfortably. “What?”
"He's doing well, Potter. Madam Promfey made him stay for another night so he'll be back by tomorrow." Parkinson winked, much like the way Seamus did back in their room.
McGonagall kindly smiled, seemingly unsurprised by his words. "Magical pregnancy however, works both ways," said McGonagall then, and Harry unconsciously leaned forward at that. "The carrier will provide their offspring magic, and the offspring will provide their magic to their carrier as a return."
He silently waited until he felt his bed dipped down by the weight on the side of his bed, facing him. He waited, patiently as a soft hand was placed on his cheek, caressing his skin gently.
His face was decorated with a soft smile, fond and full of love as he looked down at his brother. His eyes silken with adoration, as if Leo hung the moon, as if Leo created the heavens and deserved to be praised and worshipped. He looked at Leo as if he was his world.
Malfoy just dismissed him with a wave, though his cheeks were pink. “I think they were rather clever for thinking up the solution.”
Draco heard as Granger continued her explanation, and he let her. He doesn't need to listen to what she had to say as he knew about it already. He then turned to observe his twins, to their rhythmic breath, pinky cheeks decorating their faces as they unconsciously sought each other's hand.
“Right.” He said, “As you know, I'm a bit busy during the war and I don't think no one wants to get on with a Death Eater, so.” He lifted a shoulder at them.
Sure, maybe there were other blokes who got the same genetic traits but the twins just narrowed it down for them.
“Is it?” asked Granger, and Draco shrugged, feeling hopeless of all a sudden but he shoved the feelings far down on where he decided not to bother.
“Ah,” Henry grinned, waltzing closer to Malfoy and draped his hand around his shoulder. “You're going to stay here, with me.”
Malfoy sighed, ghosting his breath on Harry's lips. "I- Potter, you have shown me kindness when I have taken an advantage on you."
Scorpius frowned a little. “Well, it looks like an ancient book of old curses, but that's all I can remember.”
"Well," began Hermione. "I think if anyone could master the Disillusionment Charm, it would be him."
Harry could see nodded from the others, and felt himself nodding as well. He has been meaning to ask himself and now he was sure that everyone has been wanting to ask the same question.
Draco suddenly heard a high pitched shouts, before another pair of small arms wrapped around his shoulder, “I want to use Papa’s wand too!”
“Well,” began Harry, hugging the small pillow that he snatched from the sofa. “I know that he was a male since the first time he kissed me - I heard him. Also, he smelled so nice and his hands were really soft.” He grinned, as he recalled those hands on him, sobered when his friends stared at him with a blank look and he immediately added, “I think I can say that he was a powerful wizard too, not everyone can cast a perfect Disillusionment Charm after all.”
“I don't think you see the point here, Potter.” Draco says distantly. “I'm asking you to fucking set that prick up to his place. Do you think I will just sit there, doing nothing when he and his fucking minions bullied other students, hexing them into oblivion?”
“It's really good to see you in person! Well, we've seen each other before that but I haven't had the chance to meet you officially.” said Ginevra, smiling all the way and Draco doesn't know what to do with that. So he smiled back, “I've been a bit busy lately.” He reasoned.
"Cheer up, mate." said Seamus, wiping a few tears that has escaped his eyes. "You still got time, eh?"
Harry instantly rolled on his back, and pushed himself to sit. Eyes wide as he covered a hand over his mouth.
“Albus, look! It's papa!” He exclaimed and his brother immediately followed his pointed finger. Albus widened his eyes and let out a delighted shriek making Scorpius laugh.
Harry had to look up at him, brows furrowed as he dragged his eyes in between the identical faces; Malfoy wore his hair short, while Leo had his hair long- chest length where he had loosely tied them behind his neck. They were identical, very much identical that it was hard for Harry to differentiate them the first time he met them back in their first year, save for their eyes. They were separated however, when Malfoy sorted into Slytherin whilst Leo was sorted into Gryffindor. That was how they became friends after all.
"Right," says Harry, "guess I'm leaving then." Leave it to Malfoy to ruin his plans. He trudges out of the water, grabs his socks and trainers, folds down his trousers, and gives Malfoy an ironic little salute.
Again, Pansy laughs. And again, she lets it build until it’s echoing in the chilly night air and people are looking. She slings an arm around Draco’s waist and plants a kiss on his cheek.
"Withering," he says sardonically. "Right. S'pose you are too then? Only ... hm ... I don't recall you
"It is," he says. "But I'm not going to. I mean, he's not interested. I don't need to be wasting my time on people who aren't interested."
Ginny didn't though, even though Ron was right and it was weird. It was just that no one seemed to really see the point in getting miffed over Harry and Charlie finding some kind of temporary comfort in each other, when much worse things had happened not very long ago.
When Malfoy wants something, he blinks. A stupid slow one with long golden eyelashes. It’s really quite effective. It’s also how Malfoy ends up sipping a twenty-two pound cocktail that Harry paid for.
His eyes are closed, and he looks horribly, perfectly debauched; swollen lips, slick with sweat and messy with glitter, black lace and come splattered along the v of his abdomen.
"Come off it, Potter," Draco snarls. "Do you really care if your best friends know that the fuck we had in a
"Yes," Harry says emphatically, already taking out his wand and sending the plates and forks and knives into the living room ahead of him. "I deal with things, that's what I do." A sentiment he could in no way overstate.
“Right …” Harry says, because he doesn’t know what else to say. “So ... shall I get it from you tomorrow, then?”
than that, though. Erm — it was Malfoy, actually. Got stuck with him in a lift at Mungo's when the Stifling happened." He pauses, sheepishly scratching the back of his head, and takes advantage of Ron's shocked silence to add, "We didn't finish, though. That's something, right?"
"I'll admit, I may have been inclined towards a rematch while in my — what did you call it? 'Pathetic little cock drunk daze'? Thanks for that, by the way. But I promptly righted myself. I could very easily spill a drink on some sod at Venus and get him riled up enough for a rough go at it in the bathrooms, and I can also do
“More,” Draco says, head thrown back so he can just see the stars beyond the roof of the parapet. His cock ruts again Harry’s midriff as he’s fucked, smooth and warm and taut.
At first Harry's head is too fuzzy to know what Malfoy's talking about, and when he gets it finally he can only nod and tighten his grip in Malfoy's hair and, carefully the first time, push his cock back into Malfoy's mouth. He presses in until he can feel the head slide just barely into his throat and pulls back out again, but doesn't wait more than a couple seconds before repeating the whole thing. Holding Malfoy's head still, Harry starts up a rhythm, fucking his mouth and giving him only brief respites to catch his breath. It's unbelievably cathartic, and Malfoy's mouth is like velvet.
“I just think it was a bad idea, alright?” Ron says testily. “I know you wouldn’t risk her wellbeing, Hermione, but it’s
Frowning, Harry follows Malfoy’s line of sight and sees the Great Hall, a shell of itself now without the enchanted ceiling. From inside one can see the
Draco opens his mouth to protest, you absolutely can be expected at a club at a specific time, especially when that club is Venus and that time is when the private rooms open, but she blows right past it. He just scowls, instead. He hasn’t seen her since before Christmas two weeks ago, and he hasn’t missed her.
“Buy you another,” says Terry. “You need it.” He gets up and goes over to the bar where Harry suspects he also wants to flirt with the girl behind it.
Draco rolls his right back. Pansy is tragically predictable. "You're a pervert, I hope you know. And don't be so fucking offensive. My cock is very precious to me, and no one who could be described as either 'fumbling'
He puts out the lamps with his wand and sets it aside on his night table and says, to Klaus and to the darkness, "D'you think it's time I quit pratting around and try dating like a normal person?"
So yeah, he’s not a baby expert. But he’s decent, and at least Rose knows him. Ignoring the fact for now that Malfoy is for no immediately discernible here in their house with their child, he goes over to him and takes Rose, setting her over his shoulder and bouncing her gently.
When the door opens to the private room they’re currently inhabiting along with multiple other people — she doesn’t know how many, she can hear them making sounds though — Blaise doesn’t even bother opening his eyes when he says, “Get out.”
Harry says “Great” and gestures back towards the centre of the clearing ahead of returning there himself. He sits on the log and finishes off the last of the joint, watching the smoke made visible in the light from the lantern. He’s pretty fucking blazed, which is definitely the only way he can handle being in this place (and he
easy, but he's not quite lust-clouded enough yet (like, apparently, Malfoy) to ignore what a terrible idea it would be.
“A self righteous prick of a one, Pans. Probably thinks he can fuck Draco around how ever he wants cause he’s king of the fucking Wizarding world.”
And now his friends (or so they claim) are gone, and it’s just Harry leaning against a sticky table, and Draco Malfoy pushing his way through thronging bodies towards him.
He's not, actually. Definitely sick to death of talking about the situation, but there's also a part of him that likes talking about Malfoy. Disgusting.
“I mean, like. I can’t stop thinking about him,” he admits quietly. “And when I do, I just ... I feel sick. It’s like a constant battle, trying not to go see him again.”
It's easy to forget it's Christmastime around the Manor, what with the lack of any festive decorations. Once upon a time it had been Narcissa's very favourite holiday, especially when Draco was a baby. He'd loved the lights, and so they had had the house-elves fill nearly every room and corridor with them for his amusement. There was always a grand tree in the drawing room that they decorated as a family, the three of them, and a smaller tree in Draco's room that he'd been allowed to decorate with whatever he wanted.
Pansy pats Blaise’s head. “Then tell us the rest of this story and follow it with the Potter story. Look at poor Blaise, he’s perishing.”
After a minute, he says, “You can leave if you want, I won’t sic the trees on you this time. Thanks for staying a bit. ”
“He, oh, fuck, again Harry please, killed Ladon and — Hera placed his, ah, image in the sky, around the North Pole.”
Instinct makes him pull away when Malfoy touches his shoulder — he feels kind of bad after he does it, but he doesn’t know how to explain that it’s not
“Right,” he says. “Well, I’ll hold Hermione off for now, so don’t worry about it. I’ll see you later?”
The first time they spoke, Malfoy had been sitting on one of the cushy green couches reading. He’d been like that, this year. Bookish. He was besting Hermione in half the subjects they shared. Perhaps Malfoy had always been a swot, only Harry hadn't noticed because he’d been a bitch far more prominently.
, you halfwit, that’s exactly my point. Unless you’re an especially opaque and fucking irksome ghost, then I believe you didn’t die last year.”
"You're fucking sick in the head," Harry laughs. He looks down at his watch and is surprised to see that it's already past three — funny post-war world where he passes time talking to Malfoy and finding out all kinds of fun things about him. Like how he's bent and does coke and has recently been disowned. "Well Hagrid's taken too unfortunately. But if I think of any other blokes with red hair and-or big hands I'll be sure to let you know."
“Oh.” Harry looks past Malfoy at the mask lying against the tree trunk and thinks that it’s highly ironic he can’t even look it at. Of course he doesn’t say that — he gets up and goes over to it, picks it up, turns it over in his hands. He’s never looked at one up close; it’s pristine still, probably Charmed not to scratch. He wonders whose it might have been but doesn’t dwell on it, tossing it into the blackness of the forest beyond the clearing.
He hasn’t come to see it up close since bringing the wand back, too afraid of everything he’d feel. But the truth is, all he feels as he walks up to it is kind of sad and empty. One day he thinks he might ask to sit down with Dumbledore’s portrait and talk, but he’s afraid of it feeling shallow because it’s a painting. He supposes that relationship is one for which he’ll never really have the closure he wants.
“Oh well. Terribly sorry about all that. Et cetera. I think I might’ve been a sociopath in my youth, don’t you?”
“Yes,” Draco says, voice low and fingers clutching at the pristine tablecloth. “He was. He got me so hard I couldn’t think straight. He made me ask for what I wanted, wouldn’t even let me fucking move without admitting first I was gagging for him. He turned me against the wall and rimmed me, and fucked me with his fingers, and he tugged on my belly ring and called me a ponce cause I was wearing those black silk pants, the ones you love so much, Blaise, sweetheart. I got one thrust of his cock inside me, and then the lift started again, and he was Harry Potter again, and he went off knowing I was so terribly desperate for it that I begged for him to finish fucking me in a fully functioning lift, in my place of work. And so do you.” Draco raises his glass and clinks it hard against each of their tumblers, eyes smarting but not bothering to try and blink it away. “Chin-chin, do with that what you fucking will. Tossers. I’m leaving.”
), but he still gets all twisty every time he thinks about (and pulls off to) the memory of Potter’s warm, angular weight pressing him into the wall of the lift.
He hasn’t expressed the feeling out loud, but Blaise is of the private opinion that coming back to England had been a terrible idea. He’s enjoying himself, of course (save for the subpar blow), and he knows Pansy will be fine once she gets the logistics of her company sorted, but Draco?
“Harry Potter. Can’t just have a whacking cock, you’ve got to go around performing wandless, wordless spells without even realising. Because you’re horny, nonetheless.” Draco squeezes his ankle (it’s supposed to be scolding, probably.) “Ridiculous behaviour.”
He has, of course, nailed it. The Weasel coughs over a murmured “wanker” and Granger delivers him a swift whack to the back of the head with a salad spoon. Draco is already having more fun than he thought he would. It helps that he can hear the sound of Potter digging his nails into the arm of his chair beside him.
— so fucking good.” Harry leans over, skin sliding over sweaty skin, and pulls Draco up against his chest.
“Sure,” Granger says. “Take some biscuits with you. Thanks for clearing up, Draco. You didn’t have to do that.”
Mental note; debrief with Harry about what emotions seeing Draco again brought up for him, et cetera. She’ll do it later. Right now, she’s busy being completely narked off.
Narcissa nearly starts. She’s taken so surprise by the rapid topic change — and to something she so violently does not want to talk about — that it takes her a moment to compose herself. It breaks her heart to know her son is an adult now, capable of his own decisions and opinions and with the freedom to do as he pleases. She misses her small boy with his easy laughter and his trivial tantrums.
“Harry,” says Hermione when they’ve made a good dent in the food, acknowledging him for the first time in ten minutes and interrupting his and Ron’s cross-discussion about Quidditch. Her voice sounds a little loose from the wine. “Remember that raid you did last year, the married couple who were selling fake organs?”
Blaise doesn’t like it when Pansy looks troubled. If Draco’s upset, it’s kind of whatever, he’s always been outrageously sensitive. But Pansy’s like him. Unflappable, and if she’s concerned, he probably should be, too. “Not sure,” Blaise says. He knocks back the rest of his drink. “He’s a flighty little thing, isn’t he?”
"You're welcome," Harry says again, with a small sigh. "Will you please tell me what the problem is?"
Well. It’s not untrue. Draco beckons for the spliff with a finger and says, “I wonder how Lucius Abraxas and Narcissa Eltanin foretold that one.”
“Probably don’t call her ‘it’ around Hermione,” Harry says. “And she’ll start up again the second I give her back to you." The proper reaction to being held by a Malfoy when you're but a defenceless infant. "I’ll stay if you think you can stomach my presence, I need to talk to Hermione anyway.”
“He’s just seen Malfoy,” Ron says it with an and-we-all-know-what-that-means (which Harry absolutely doesn’t) kind of smile and a clap on Harry’s shoulder.
He’s literally walked, stone cold, to his own death, he reminds himself. If he can do that and not this, there's something wrong with him.
. Wow. Charlie kind of wants to frown at Harry, and kind of wants to high five him. "Harry," he says. "Mate, of course not."
Harry rolls his eyes. "Fine," he says and hits it again. The smoke sits in front of them in the stagnant night air, sticky and potent. "God forbid you ever unclench for half a second."
Draco says, “Yes,” and then, because he’s not sure if Potter’s referring to his rutting hips or the hand on Draco’s throat, he adds, “Both.”
had known about this and decides he hadn't. Although Harry's suddenly suspicious about his secret having been shared with Hermione.
Draco babbles, something utterly undecipherable about Mars, and shit, Harry won’t be able to listen for much longer without shooting off in his jeans like a fucking teenager.
“First tell me what the hell you’re doing out here,” he demands, walking closer. “You scared the fucking shit out of me.”
Draco groans and cants his hips upwards when Harry pins his wrists, needing more even though he’s already overwhelmed. “Mm, close,” he says.
And that's absolutely no fun to think about, so he focuses instead on Malfoy and his navel ring and his bitten lips and the gleam in his eye that says he's very turned on right now.
, Ron. I would never put Rose in harm’s way, ever. Do you really think I would risk her wellbeing just to prove a point?"
She helps him undress but remains tragically platonic about the whole thing when she helps him into his tub which she magicks full of steaming hot water and rose petals. Another flick of her wand and there are candles burning on most surfaces, perfumed and soothing. Finally she Conjures a velvet-covered chair, and she pulls out another cigarette as she sits.
"Oh?" Narcissa says in a tight voice. There's an uncomfortably familiar name she hadn't expected to hear. Hermone Granger — friend of Harry Potter, top of Draco's class at Hogwarts, Mudblood. (If she closes her eyes, she can see Bellatrix torturing the girl on their drawing room floor.) But Narcissa doesn't want to say anything to upset him. She feels she hardly knows him anymore; it's like stepping around shattered glass. "That's. Well. That's very nice. You enjoy it?"
Where was this Potter, so entirely unwilling to lose him temper, every other time Draco could have used him? Fucking
keep fucking him. Nothing is physically stopping him. It's even possible they have enough time before anyone comes to use the lift that they might be able to finish, if they hurry. But it's only a maybe, and even through the fog in his brain Harry knows that’s not good enough.
“It’s not like you’re any less hard for it,” says Draco. After a moment, he adds, “The lady doth protest too much.”
So Harry’s excited to see him. And he’s excited to enjoy the holiday without the weight of relationship anxiety dragging him down.
He disappears into the kitchen with Seamus grumbling and Dean taking the piss out of him, and Harry barely has any time to start feeling guilty for wishing they'd all fuck off sometime soon before Ron's joining him with that look on his face like he's concerned but pretending not to be so Harry doesn't bite his head off.
It’s rather what Draco expected. It was probably nice and giggly and quick, and Granger and Other Weasley were probably doing the same thing right next door (and Potter has the nerve to call his friends incestuous). He looks at Harry’s red cheeks, and the way he’s scrubbing his palm over his opposite wrist. “You’re quite interesting, did you know,” Draco says.
"Seeing all the Weasleys together must be a pretty overwhelming experience for you, then. I'm pretty sure Charlie's gay, you want me to put you two in contact?"
Still straddling Harry’s hips, Draco looks down at him, twisting his fingers in the cool, slippery sheets. After a moment of thought, he says, “Love you, too.”
, Harry, had thought it had been kind of intimate. Certainly not toxic. "No, I wouldn't expect anyone to believe we fucked
Maybe it’s being back here, but when Harry hears footsteps cracking over twigs and dead leaves he goes automatically for his wand and stands up, breathing hard again. Then, through the darkness, he sees blond hair and realises who’s joined him — and who’s now trying to slink away again.
A great, weathered arch has been cut from Déshabillé’s backmost stone wall. (Harry knows it filters out into what functions as a beer garden between the hours of eleven am and five. A courtyard filled with polished wood trestle tables and cordoned with velvet ropes — before the end of the night, it’ll be closed off completely by a rolling door of corrugated iron. Harry knows this not because he’s a particularly frequent patron, but only because he might’ve thought on one of his few previous visits, and in a spectacularly intoxicated state, that it would be a good idea to bet the bloke he’d been drinking with that he could slide under it as it closed. He was right. Only then, he was trapped in a deserted beer garden and had to scale the fence (he grazed his knee), stumble to a phone box (too drunk to Apparate, too far from any Wizarding establishment to Floo) and call Hermione to come fetch him (and she had, the angel).)
Using her free hand, Pansy removes first one shoe and then the other, setting both aside and out of harm's reach. "Well are you going to tell me the reason then? I assume it isn't simply that he's a prat and you hate him, since that seems obvious."
Harry’s not sure how exactly Skeeter discovered some of the other, finer details, and he’s not sure he wants to.
“Are we?” says Draco, because his desire to be a cunt flares up at the most unpredictable of moments. “How nice of Granger to have lent you the Gryffindor brain cell for today. She really should give the rest of you a turn more often.”
Dominique comes in with their tea, preens under Pansy’s praise, and then wishes her a good night  while deliberately ignoring Draco.
Ron isn’t sure he likes it either. George still makes everyone laugh, but everything he says sounds so sardonic and detached. It’s weird.
Malfoy has dragged him into the hot, pulsing center (ew) of the dance floor. There are a lot of bare limbs, and it smells overpoweringly like alcohol and salt, sweat, man. And then there’s Malfoy, with his hands on Harry’s on his waist, and his back against Harry’s chest, and his arse, well. Harry’s already said.
Five years into his reign, with the help of his trusted friends and allies, Harry had managed to build a powerful empire. He was one of the most respectable Demon King ever existed, and he was also the youngest Demon King that managed to rule the Demon Regime. He has everything, and yet, he has nothing.
Harry mildly paid attention to the sound of Draco hissing as he ended his spell with the last incantation, his spare wand making the last contact with Draco’s index finger before he lifted them and watched as the last golden spark emerging from the wand dissipating into thin air. With a satisfied nod, he slid his wand back into his back pocket when the sound of skin being slapped had Harry to look up just in time to see his younger self was rubbing his hand, wincing. His face was sorted into a wounded look as he looked up to Draco who was looking back at him with an annoyed look.
Harry saw him give his brother a knowing look, a look that didn't sit well in his stomach. Worsen when Albus blinked, and twisted his face in a grimace as if something just occurred to him.
“Besides,” said Albus, stage whispering as he gave Draco a reassuring grin. “Dad was the most handsome person you've ever met! You said it yourself, papa!”
He sent his sons a look just to see if they can crumble under his gaze but to his amusement, they did not wavered as they fixed a comical smile to him. He decided to let it go and shrugged, making no fuss about it. Besides, Draco did not mind if his sons were fans of Harry Potter. The git did save the Wizarding World after all. Also, now that Draco thinks about it, the plan was not that bad. In fact, it was the only plan that Draco thought they could manage without consuming more time than necessary. They were racing with time after all.
"Where's Hermione and Ginny anyway?" asked Harry after a moment when he didn't see any sign of the two Gryffindor girls.
“That was because I will make sure you never noticed.” Potter grinned, slowly lowering his hands down to Draco’s waist and pulled Draco towards him.
"I am Draco Malfoy, son of the Grand Duke of the Demon Regime, Lucius Malfoy. You have my words, Harry James Potter, no matter what happens, I will come back to you." sworn Draco solemnly, with determination.
“Of course not, Harry, but I don't think he knows.” said Hermione softly. “Slytherin was kind of shunned since the term started, it was only because of the chocolates that things seemed to get a little bit better.”
“Let's greet him!” Albus had already climbed down his seat before Scorpius could stop him. He promptly followed, almost falling down his face when he clambered to the floor and chased down his brother.
“I don't think so, Ron,” said Hermione, “They look pretty excited for students who were just being shrunk.”
The twins literally dressed in the same way, as if they were a sole person until they reached fourth year when Malfoy suddenly cut his hair short; cropped at back, longer at the front, and decided to go for a more bad boy appearance which served their personality much better since despite being twins, their personality were the polar opposite.
Right, they have run the test twice and the result stayed the same; the twins were definitely matched Draco’s magical signature.
His eyes fell on the lone occupied bed, curtains were fully retracted to ensure the privacy of the occupant and he quickly made a beeline towards it. He folded the Marauder's Map into his back pocket, along with his wand as he stepped closer, and draped his Invisibility Cloak by the foot of the bed.
A hard smack on his back retrieved him back to reality and he reached a hand to rub the abused spot as he regarded the guilty person with an irritated look. “What's that for?!”
Giggles were heard around them but Harry hardly paid them any attention. The pinky dust that was decorating Malfoy's face was even more interesting, and besides, holding the white-blond haired Slytherin felt amazing.
“Oh?” Draco raised an eyebrow, face clearly impressed with Harry's discreet acts. “I thought Head Student can't abused their power.”
He watches in astonished as Dixon stumbles on his back and Malfoy quickly climbs onto his body, fisting harshly on his collar to continue throwing punches with his other hand.
Draco can understand her implications. “I see.” He unconsciously sought Potter's face. “All of you?”
“I am sure there was a definite explanation regarding the sudden appearance of you both at Hogwarts and specifically at my office.” said McGonagall kindly, but her eyes were firm and calculating, darting back and forth between the two of them.
Harry gulped hard. Forcing his body to stay calm. It was hard not to think they were not his sons when they basically curled up to his body like they've been doing it since forever. He saw Hermione and Ginny's speculative gaze on him and chose to ignore it.
“I don't think you're that bad looking.” said She Weasley suddenly. “I mean, I saw some of the students practically drooled over you despite being a Death Eater.”
“Boys, what are you doing?” He heard Malfoy’s hitch voice, clearly taken by surprise by their actions.
“So, uh, I'm actually done with my meeting and we should probably head back now…” Potter trailed off, gesturing to his son who's sleeping soundly in Draco’s arms.
Scorpius went rigidly still as the older man walked to his bed, stiffly moved out of the older man's range with Albus on his tail doing a terrible job at stalling the man away.
“Well, I say truce for now,” Ginny announced, picking up her pumpkin juice. “We don't want Albus and Scorpius to get scared every time they sit with us.”
Malfoy turned around, raising his head as his eyes widened in an instant the moment they met Harry's. With a smirk as a warning, Harry cradled Malfoy's face with both hands, and stooped down to capture Malfoy's lips in his. He moved his lips against him, trying hard to keep it as innocent as possible without getting their tongues involved. He felt Malfoy's hand placed on his chest after a moment, regrettably pulled away when Malfoy gave him a gentle push.
Draco gaped, unconsciously inching away from Henry as he stared at the older man incredulously. His action however, managed to make Henry laugh out loud, throwing back his head and he put his hands on his stomach.
He stepped forward when Malfoy stepped in front of his hiding spot, sneaked a hand out and took a grab of Malfoy's hand, and tugged him inside the Invisibility Cloak as he walked him backwards towards the hidden alcove and pinned him to the wall. Malfoy gasped aloud, and Harry didn't give him any chance as he immediately dived in and captured the slightly agape pink lips in a desirous kiss.
Draco nodded, as he nibbled on his finger and quickly sobered up before anyone saw that nervous habit of his. “They were too focused to get here, so I don't think they were even aware of it.”
"Well I guess it's not our problem, anymore?" said Albus, unsure as he watched their younger dad's dot was already halfway towards the room where their older dad and papa were. "Merlin, it's giving me a headache."
Scorpius rolled his eyes at his brother's idiocy. “Headmistress McGonagall herself did the magical signature test on us. She tested it twice, and of course we matched.”
He probably won't see Potter again, the chance for them to be in each other's company are too slim and it's not like they were in the same social circle. He was a former Death Eater for Salazar’s sake.
Ginny and Hermione gasped as Ron choked into his drink. “I know that look anywhere!” Ron coughed heavily, “As much as I hate it!”
“Oh, sweet Merlin!” He gasped in shock as he peered down at his sons carefully. “Your dad was not Harry Potter, was he?”
"Male pregnancy is indeed rare in the Wizarding World, some will cause certain complexity to the carrier. The curse should have made a great impact on his pregnancy." explained McGonagall.
It was weird, considering it was both of them. Sworn enemies since first years and now they were talking to one another without malice. It was really weird, but it was nice.
"And if we broke the rule?" asked Harry, looking past Malfoy to observe the older man who got his eyes pinned on him in a challenging manner. He narrowed his eyes at the man, annoyed.
Usually, the sight of the heart shaped chocolates managed to make his day. Now, knowing that there won't be kisses accompanying these chocolates anymore, Harry doesn't feel like eating one; let alone touch them. It felt incomplete, because those kisses were what made these chocolates ten times tastier.
“How on earth did you manage to find a man like that?” asked Parkinson, her voice dripping with amazement.
“Salazar, who the hell is your dad?” huffed Parkinson, “Now I'm dying to know. I mean to create both of you need good genes. Draco got intelligence, so your Dad must possess these-” She suddenly gasped and looked at the twins in horror, “Your dad was a Gryffindor, wasn't he?”
If Harry got to be honest, it felt a little empty without the Slytherins' mischievous treat colouring the school. It was actually sad to see some of the students from other houses put the blame entirely on Slytherins for what has happened; as if there was no traitors from Gryffindor, no Death Eater from Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff.
Draco immediately fastened the baby securely in his arms, making sure he was in a comfortable position as he softly wipes the baby's tears away, and placed a soft kiss on his head. “Don't cry, love. I'm here now.”
He patted Pansy’s bum off his lap and she complied, pulling Blaise to stand with her. Draco shook his head when his two friends started to walk towards the exit, bidding Granger and Weasley a loud goodbye. He turned to Potter when the two disappeared to the exit, leaning forward to give the man a soft kiss on his cheek.
“Papa, you sound funny!” Albus laughed, and Scorpius copied. “But you look just like in the picture!”
“Ah.” Harry suddenly felt exposed, when two pairs of eyes locked onto him. Godric, what would Malfoy say if he told him that Harry got worried over him? It's not like he can freely say; “Oh, it's nothing. It's just, I kind of worried that Henry would do things to you, so I went to look for my Marauder’s Map- you know, so I can watch over you but it seemed that I lost that bloody piece of parchment, and I'm dying to know if you're okay so that's why I'm here.”
“Well,” Potter cluck his tongue in a playful manner. “Ron always said that I looked at you like you hung the moon, especially after you kissed me. I've been dying for your kisses, did you know that?” He bent down closer, wrapping his arms full on Draco’s waist, pulling him closer and Draco raised his arms to rest them around Potter's neck. He bit back a smile from forming when Potter playfully rubbed their noses together. “Hermione been giving me a hell of a week, because she said and I quote, ‘Stupid moron who doesn't realised his own feelings, I hope Draco stops being in love with you!’”.
The man sighed in defeat, “Alright, but you know where to find me.” he said, smiling at Draco with his predator smile that got him to grinned with appreciation.
Sometimes the boys will look up and drag their delighted eyes throughout the Great Hall, taking the scenery around them and sometimes they will look at the students, table from table as if they were looking for something. They talked to each other, and politely exchanged conversations with some of the professors. Too engrossed with his watching, he was startled when the boy with the black hair suddenly turned his head towards their table and locked his eyes with him. The boy raised an eyebrow, his expression uncanningly reminded him of
"Whatever you say, lover boy." Seamus winked, and proceeded to the bathroom with Dean and Neville on his tail.
"What do you expect," said Albus, rolling his eyes, having an idea of what his brother was implying. "I'm part Malfoy, it's my job to annoy Potter."
It was bittersweet, Harry thought, when a pair of lips that he knew by heart sealed the promise, when at the same time, it felt like a farewell.
“Do you have any idea how much it worries me, that you were out there picking fights, getting yourself injured in the process?”
The ruckus managed to attract other houses; heads turning, while curious eyes widely watched as the younger Slytherins practically beaming to one another, speaking excitedly as they start to compare the identical packages they have received within themselves, whilst the older Slytherins shared bemused and unsure smiles, peculiarly as they read the cards that probably came with the packages. The first years, however, were over the moon seeing as they received much bigger packages than the older students.
"And for the hundredth time, I am." said Malfoy, placing a hand on his arm gently. "Thank you for looking out for me." he smiled.
“Dad was a really loving person.” Scorpius continued, “He was really kind and he loves you so much. It broke his heart when you were cursed, papa. We don't want him to get sad, that's why we're here.”
“What?” said Harry, defensively. “Just look at them!” He pointed, “Look at them and tell me you didn't feel the same.”
Albus, that calculative little prat managed to catch the exchange. “You're not going to get that part of information from us, Aunt Pansy.” He cheekily said, smirking a little.
Malfoy who heard the words, instantly nodding his head. “Yes, yes. I can do that. You can have the room all by yourself, Henry.”
"We can't!" shouted Malfoy all of a sudden, having the sudden strength to push Harry as he quickly clawed his way out of the Cloak, and away from Harry as he stepped out of the alcove.
“He- Hello.” greeted Malfoy back, tongue tied - he fucking tongue tied and Harry had never saw him getting tongue tied because of a stranger before.
Henry yelped, a hand automatically wrapped around Draco’s waist while the other quickly dropped to the floor to prevent them from falling,
Draco watches until the bird disappears from his view, and he just had to chuckles. If he got to be honest with himself, he doesn't know if it will lead them anywhere, but he's willing to find out.
“Very well, I am sure for your dangerous effort,” McGoganall began, making the two boys winced at her words, “The only thing I can provide for the both of you is to help you as much as I can give.”
He softly patted the baby's back, lightly bouncing him up and down in his arms as he brings the baby walks around the place. The baby was hiccuping in between his cries now, mouth open wide as he trash around in Draco’s arms.
McGonagall smiled despite herself. “Come now, children. It's dinner time and I'm sure you're hungry.”
Apparently, he was not the only one who saw the smile because he could see the others sharing a look.
He growled at that, hands dropping his weapons as he wrapped them around the firm slim waist, bringing their bodies close together in a tight embrace. He let his tongue enter into the hot cavern that willingly let him in, and their teeth clashed when their tongue started to dance together. It was harsh, and messy, filled with desperation and Harry abused his power when he was allowed to dominate the kiss, letting his frustration seep through for the last time before he calmed down, and started to lead them into exchanging a slow kiss between two pairs of lovers in their own world.
The next day, even more bizarre things happened during breakfast. The moment Harry entered the Great Hall, the entire Slytherins clan have already invaded their table, having breakfast together while chattering amongst themselves. Throwing warm smiles to every student that entered the Great Hall, their little action managed to put other houses in wary, Harry included.
He softly cast Alohomora when he arrived in front of the Hospital Wing, carefully sneaking in and winced when the heavy door made a creaky sound. He looked around the place once he was in, just to take in the sights of it. He knew that Madam Promfey was probably somewhere in her quarter, dead asleep now that there won't be another set of students who will interrupt her sleep.
No wonder he had never managed to grasp any glimpse of his culprit no matter how hard Harry tried to catch him back.
"Yes, professor." sighed Harry, reaching out his hair and ran his fingers through his locks, trying to tame down his frustrations."I just- it's really hard for me to think that he suffered years, unknown of the curse that was placed on him."
He swallowed down the heavy feeling on his chest, drawing a tight smile. “Then it is time for me to stop.”
“Later.” Draco answered, eyes locked on his twins as they were engrossed with Granger displays of magic. The Weasleys and Potter watch the interaction with interest. He raised an eyebrow when Potter handed his wand to Albus who received it with a large grin, and started to mimic Granger’s hand movement. Draco chuckled when Albus whooped in delight when he managed to copy her.
“Oh, yes!” Draco nods, canceling the charms he put on James and moves closer to Potter who gently peel his son off Draco.
McGonagall seemingly caught his action and immediately smiled. "I hope you've managed to make some progress with your inspection?"
Harry pushed away Seamus' face when the Irishman teasingly leaned forward to him as he chanted 'mysterious kisser' over and over again as he blinked at his friend. "What made you say that?"
“That's me.” Harry immediately took the hand in his, and the man gave them a strong shake Harry almost stumbled to his feet. “You can call me Harry.”
Henry raised an eyebrow, and rolled his eyes when he saw the look on Harry's face. “Oh, please. Spare your Saviour trait on me, I won't do anything unpleasant to Draco. He's my husband for Merlin’s sake.”
It has been almost a week after the commotion on the Great Hall and he can't see Malfoy without two little boys on his tail. The two boys will always hang around him, worshipping him as if Malfoy was the center of their world. Honestly.
Draco raised an eyebrow as a response before he shrugged. "You haven't even told me anything about your inspection," he moved over his trunk and pulled out a pair of pyjamas. "Oh, and I hope you did not mind I went over your bag, I was hoping you'd brought spare clothes for the boys. I found them of course, I asked Potter to bring it back to his dorm so the boys can change."
Scorpius sighed but agreed, It was their father after all. Now that the excitement has decreased, he can feel hundreds of eyes from all directions were onto them. He quickly grabbed Albus’ robe and they scrambled up to their feet.
Draco blinked when he tapped his wrist for their matching percentage, surprised to see the numbers that popped up onto his skin and he just had to give a small amused laugh.
By this point, if another Dark Lord came and straight out killed Harry on the spot, he would be glad to let them so.
Feeling excited, they threw compliments to their father but when his face turned hysterical the further they spoke, Scorpius quickly acted and put his palm to Albus’ mouth in order to shut him. Merlin knows how much a chatterbox Albus was when he got excited. He gave Albus a look when his brother questioned his actions.
"Harry, I've never seen you getting worked up on something since War." began Hermione, soft smile playing on her lips. "You were much happier ever since the kisses happened. We were worried that Malfoy being the mysterious kisser would break you down but I guess we should have known better."
Harry decided he doesn't like the way those pale brows knotted in disapproval, so he dragged his eyes southward to sought for the pink lips which currently pressed in a thin line.
Harry looked into the pair of grey eyes desperately, afraid that it was going to be his last moments seeing those eyes looking back at him. The pair of eyes that always filled with devotion and love, the pair of eyes that were currently stare at him with calmness despite the cataclysm that was surrounding them at the moment.
A small cough brought him back to his senses and he quickly whipped his head around to Ron, who gives him a strange look.
“Never mind him.” Ginevra jumped in, “I have never met you officially. Hello, I'm Ginny.” She smiled, holding out a hand and Draco took it and gave them a shake, “Draco Malfoy.” He nodded.
Never once did Draco feel so self insecure until now. He glanced at his pale skin. That's him; nothing seemingly pretty about him. Pale skin, blond hair with grey eyes. Dull colours.
Potter nodded, as he adjusted his glasses, “So, I'm guessing that as soon as you extract your blood, you intend to send Albus and Scorpius back to the future?”
Harry replied by pulling Malfoy much closer, now aware of the position they were in and he can't help but grinned, pleased by the situation. Malfoy looked like a damsel in distress, leaning backwards with Harry as his sole source of balance. If Harry let go, Malfoy would surely fall onto his arse. That thought made him chuckle, and Malfoy's face twisted in confusion adorably.
Harry laughed, relief washed over him as he pulled Draco closer and bent down to kiss him again, aware that the loud applause of all the students echoed in the hall but he chose to to ignore it. Draco gave him a wide beautiful smile when they pulled away, he too had ignored the commotion as he tugged Harry to sit at their table, and with a thumbs up that he had sent to his delighted friends back at the Gryffindor table, Harry had spent his first dinner with Draco Malfoy.
Despite having his friends with him, Harry would take some time for himself to be alone, using that precious time to regenerate and clear his head.
Albus held up the familiar ten inched hawthorn wand, as the holly wand with phoenix feather core sat firmly in Scorpius’ hand.
Harry pressed a hand on his chest, flustered to realise that he was really grateful to know that Malfoy was going to be alright. It was as if a huge boulder was lifted from the depths of his heart, and now he felt at ease.
Draco choked in disbelief and blinked the tears that suddenly gathered around his eyes. He placed a hand to his wild beating heart, trying to calm them down. “You can't say things like that if you don't mean it, Potter.”
“I want everyone back to their rooms, at this instant.” He says in authority that leaves no arguments, and looks over his shoulder for Hermione who gives him a nod. “The rest of you, please follow Miss Granger for further action.” He gestures to the remaining students body, as they promptly moves to take the fighting students, and the first years to follow the awaiting Hermione.
Granger sighed, “You're a great guy, Draco, and it's a dangerous game you're playing. It's better to stop now before you get hurt.”
Ron, the traitor, laughed out loud. Slapping Harry's hard on the shoulder. “It was quite a sight, mate.”
As if he would believe that. What kind of demon who would not kill their victims? He already had a hunch just what kind of creature Harry was, seeing his display of power and when he usually stumbled upon these creatures during his assignment, he would always stay away from trouble and avoid them. Low rank demons won't be able to detect a high rank Cupid like Draco, but having seen the way Harry handled the golden bow and the red flash of Harry's eyes was enough to break Draco’s magic, he knew that this man in front of him was anything but a low rank demon.
Harry heard the chaos before he heard Ron's exclamation. He followed Ron's line of sight along with the rest of the student to see Headmistress McGonagall strived into the Great Hall with two little boys on her tail, watching their surroundings with great interest.
"How did they do all of this?" asked Ron, mouth agape as he took a seat and claimed a present. Seamus, Dean and Neville followed his actions with delighted faces.
Draco had snorted, and Harry tilted his head up knowing the effect of his words and was not disappointed when he saw the pinky dust bloomed on his face.
Draco felt his sight getting blurry, and his breath quickened. He then felt someone’s hand on his cheek. “Malfoy, look at me!”
He ran his fingers through Albus’ hair. What a joyful child; both of them were. He reached out to Scorpius, caressing those soft cheeks of his twin. Seeing them like this, Draco thank Merlin that somehow in the future, he had managed to raise his children in a good environment.
“I haven't found any other solution.” said Granger all of a sudden in irritation, closing the book in her hand dramatically. “All of the information led to the same way of travel.” She continued. She opened her mouth to explain more but Draco shook his head at her, pointing at his twins with his eyes. Granger immediately straightened up and shut her mouth, nodding in understanding. She put the book on her side as she reached out for a piece of bread instead.
“Not really.” said Potter, “but if we can count their clothes as future things, then I guess we only need to find another one.”
“What are you lot talking about?” Malfoy came in, cutting Hermione words and Harry mentally thanked him.
“I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh.” said Henry once he calmed down. “Your face was just adorable. I can't help it.”
"I'm going!" Ron groaned, taking his things with sleep still clouding his mind that got him to stumble into his bed post, cursing loudly all the way to the bathroom.
"Do you want to be with me?" asked Harry then, locking his eyes the troubled pair of grey eyes with determination. "because I do, Draco, I really do."
Henry’s eyes sparkled in relief as he stepped away from Draco. He then clasped his hands together and grinned excitedly.
“And I'm interested in you, could you give me a chance?” asked Draco, tilting his head in a challenging manner.
He scoffed when they smugly smirked at him, and crossed his arms together in a sulky manner. He lifted his chin, pointedly stared at something far down the lawn to avoid his friends’ eyes as he muttered, “Someone has been snogging me for weeks now.”
He opened his mouth to say something - anything just for the sake of his dignity but nothing has came out which got him opening and closing his mouth like a retarded fish. Eventually, he settled with: “I didn't look too silly, am I?”
A sudden pair of delighted laughs from the twins grabbed their attention. Albus had his hand on his stomach while Scorpius went to cover his mouth.
"You sure are in a great mood, Harry." Seamus called, towel slinging on one shoulder as he took his steps towards him. "I take it things went well last night, yea?" He whispered.
“He doesn't look like Harry though.” Ron commented suddenly and they simultaneously turned to him in disbelief - Malfoy looked horrified. “What, I know all of you were thinking the same thing.”
He panicked when he saw that the lights had taken most of his lover's body, particles of bright sparkles went upwards dancing beautifully, as if Draco was someone it wanted to welcome to be amongst the Magnificent.
“Have you ever seen me looking at you?” asked Potter, drawing a smile on his handsome face. Draco shook his head slowly. He never took his eyes off Potter, so he was very much sure that Potter never once looked at him beyond their casualties.
“And here I thought you'll take this chance to get to know me better!” frowned Potter playfully, making Draco chuckled at the ridiculous face the man has made.
Since they were allowed to the Restricted Section now, they only have to use the Invisibility Cloak on the twins and because of Malfoy’s probation, he decided that it was much safer if the Gryffindors were the one who will retrieve the book with the twins-
The twins skipped next to their parents - Harry was not sure what to feel about that - but suddenly Scorpius made a turn and went to him and grabbed his hand, smiling up to him. Harry caressed his head in return.
He helplessly watched as the lights danced around his lover's body, taking him particles by particles, and closed his eyes when the last particles of lights brought his lover away from him forever between its sparkles.
Harry blinked, processing the information. "So, you're saying that my sons have been providing Draco with their magic?"
in the future later. Perhaps he deserved to touch and hold Malfoy whatever he wanted to but they were not married yet in this timeline, and hell if Harry would let the older man do what he wants.
“It's not that easy, Potter. Time Travel requires a good amount of your intent for traveling. Albus and Scorpius were desperate enough to get here, that is why the magic allows them to time travel.”
Their father promptly nodded in agreement, “Yes, of course.” he breathed, glancing at the two of them, “That would be perfect.”
Draco raised his brows as he stared at Potter. Honestly, he didn't even think of that. That was actually brilliant, but it's not like he's going to say it out loud.
“Apparently I had fallen ill, cursed by an old magic. The only way to prevent myself from dying was by using my own blood to reverse the curse.”
Weirdly enough, as bizarre as it sound, Harry had replied to his letter, for he was suddenly reminded of Malfoy's wand that was still in his possession. Seeing that he doesn't see any reason for keeping the wand, he had sent the wand back to his owner hoping that Malfoy would understand it was serve as a peace offerings which led to Malfoy writing back to saying that it was impossible for the wand to recognise him as the owner unless he took it back from Harry's own hand which led to Harry being invited to the Manor and that was the last time Harry saw the Malfoys.
- that led into another argument because apparently Malfoy was always up to no good just like his name-
Harry whipped his head to see one of twins was giving him a challenging look as he heard gasps around him. Even Malfoy looked surprised, his jaw was slightly dropped in disbelief. “Albus!” he scolded, “That was a very impolite thing to do!”
“I would appreciate it if you didn't shout like a Neanderthal, Weasley. My sons are sleeping.” said Draco calmly, as nonchalant as he could.
"I can't believe this." commented Draco hours later as they made their way towards Slytherin's dungeon just after they had done their detention. It was fun to say the least, watching Draco grumble about the fault in the universe for making him mark the first years' essays because of a bloody kiss- here he looked at Harry with narrowed eyes, as if it was his entire fault that he had kissed Draco in front of the whole students. In his defense, it wouldn't have happened if Draco hadn't been so stubborn in the first place. He had immediately dropped a kiss on Draco’s lips when those grey eyes turned slit.
A sudden shout from Malfoy tears Harry's gaze from the first year, and he quickly turns to see Dixon had his fist on the silver-white blond hair, reversing their position and pin Malfoy on the floor, eyes possessing wild looks. When he pulls his grip on Malfoy’s hair to knock his head on the floor, that's when Harry snaps out of his stupefaction.
“Oh.” Draco says, and nothing else. Not that he got anything else to say, knowing that the baby - James - in his arms was actually Potter's son managed to make him tongue tied.
Draco put his head between his hands, resisting so hard not to grab his hair out of frustration. He looks down at his documents desperately, and tries to find a glimpse of concentration that he can pull in order to continue his work.
Draco recognised the look on Potter's face when Ginevra simply turned to him, or acknowledged his presence. That was exactly what Draco looked like when Potter did the same to him.
“Merlin, Harry. All I want is for this bloke to come out and stop snogging you silly in open places like that.” said Ron, making Hermione burst out laughing and Harry can't help but grinned.
Her stares were full of distrust, perhaps it's because he's Draco Malfoy - former Death Eater - but he kept his smile steady.
“You're meant to say that since they did the ritual with three of your things from this time, they need to have three things from the future to send them back?”
Malfoy straightened up then, and Harry couldn't help but felt a major disappointment when Malfoy turned to him with a small sneer; soft smiles and silken eyes were gone the moment his eyes landed on Harry.
"Hard work." said Harry, proudly smiling as he grabbed the present in front of him when he sat himself next to Ron. Draco had clearly stated that the presents were for all students, Harry included.
"Of course, I didn't know what exactly but they're going to launch it on the last day before the holiday." said Seamus.
There was a soft hand, caressing his head in a gentle manner. Long fingers threading through his locks, scratching his scalp with the pads of their fingers lovingly, and Harry had never felt this way before.
Harry paused at that, not knowing where the future's information stood about their friendship. He forgot to ask his twins about that part. But then, he decided to at least tell him the truth about it. "Well, yes. The both of you were friends, in the future."
Harry’s magic instantly disappear into thin air at the words. He stares at his boyfriend’s distant face with a surprised look, as his words managed to put Harry on his place.
“Yea.” Harry agreed. He can't completely point out, but there was definitely something about the boys that got him unable to take his eyes off. “Why do you think they were here?”
"You were already thoughtful for bringing them spare clothes." said Draco, giving Harry a small smile when he looked up to him in surprise. He was in the middle of buttoning his pyjamas and walked towards the king sized bed once he was done. He lay down carefully down the bed, facing the ceiling as he sighed. "Merlin knows they didn't even think about spare clothes and a few items of the future when all they focused on was to travel back in time."
"I will bring Ginny with me, she's the General after all. She can cover my pretty arse." grinned Draco charmingly.
His ears perk up when he heard voices whispering; loud enough to fill in the dead silence of the night, but still low for Harry to listen to the conversation. He forced his heart to calm down, taking a steady breath to convince the night visitors that he was dead asleep. Whatever they were doing, they definitely didn't want anyone to find out and well, Harry was curious enough to know and he'd be stupid if he ruins their fun.
"Figured it's Malfoy." said Ron suddenly and Harry whipped his head at him to see his three friends had their eyes on him in amusement.
“Come here.” He croaked, opening his arms widely and the twins immediately jumped into his arms. He wrapped his arms around them as he laughed for the first time since his trial. “Thank you for coming here, both of you have done so much already. Now, let me take care of you, and then we'll find the solution for my curse.” He said and felt two eager nods on his chest.
"You know the magic words, Lion." said Malfoy, cocking his hips to his side and resting a hand on his slim waist.
Harry suppressed an incoming smile, just looking at his stance alone showed him that Draco was annoyed at him. "I was only gone for a few minutes, though." he shrugged, and carved a playful smile as he continued, "Why, did you miss me?"
"Tell me you're joking, because the day after tomorrow is the holiday." said Harry, exasperated. "I don't have much time!"
Harry fondly drew a smile as he walked towards the bed. He took a seat next to Draco, who had his eyes locked onto the ceiling, hands curled loosely around his stomach. He knew what was happening inside that pretty head of his, knew what he was thinking of. He thought that he was not worth all the hard work they put on him, because he was just a pathetic Death Eater, a person who did not deserve to be given a second chance and Harry did not want him to spend his time thinking about things that were upsetting him, things that could brought him into misery. This person deserved to be loved, and perhaps it took Harry years after the War to show him that, but right now, he wanted Draco to know-
Potter hummed, biting his lips as he tried to keep the smirk away. “It's been almost a year, from what I've heard about. Is it true?”
“Virgin blood.” Granger slid in and Draco nodded, “Most of the victims did not survive due to this reason. There was no way they could find their own pure blood unless they travel back in time which was what Albus and Scorpius have done.”
As much it was a shocked to hear Hermione has used the word ‘sex’, she was right. Malfoy and Parkinson would be around the twins’ age if they- better not think about it.
He smirked when Draco turned into a pretty pink and gave him a chaste kiss on his lips. He then moved to reach out the tray of drinks with one hand, as he locked his other hand to Draco and led them to their awaiting friends.
“I don't know either.” Granger sniffed back, taking a few firm breaths before she straightened up. “Alright, that's it.” She lifted her chin. “Let's skip class for today. We're already late, anyway. Let's call Pansy and Blaise.” She grabbed Draco’s hand without waiting for his answer, and led him towards the entrance. Her other hand fishing her phone in her sling bag, immediately dialing up the number when she got them in her hand and Draco let her. He was too busy to understand the pain in his heart to give his attention to anything else.
“Today, we received special guests from far away,” McGonagall began as the students quieted down. "They are very precious guests to me. Therefore, I look forward to good cooperation from all of you. Apart from that, I would also like to address; under my protection, there shall be no harm to be done for the both of them or they shall receive a fair punishment.”
Several gasped and shrieked broke out from other students who had been within Harry's hearing range.
Apart from that, a successful bond from a Perfect Match could produce enough Enhanced Magic for the entire department for a year and Draco understood now why the entire department had sent him off as if he was about to fight in a battle of the century. Perhaps he was, considering that ironically, a Perfect Match must be done within twenty-four hours or the match would be nullified. Hence why the department decided to give him the assignment; he was the best shooter with the perfect accuracy. He was known to finish his assignment within record time, and he was their best bet to pull up the job. He won't let his department down by doing a poor job at it. He has an important image to maintain after all.
"He fainted while he was working one day, seven years after he gave birth and Hermione was the one who brought him to St Mungos and it was how we found out about it." explained Harry.
"What kind of bullshit are you talking about?" asked Harry, felt the situation was rather ridiculous. Malfoy shouldn't have acted this way.
“You're-” Weasley pointed at him shakily, and Draco frowned at the git, somehow nervous by his reaction. “I'm what?”
“Draco, you're late for your class.” said Potter, snapping Draco away from his gossip with Pansy. He heard Granger give a colourful curses, and he immediately mimicked her movements, gathering their books in their arms as they quickly moved to leave the group.
He unconsciously lifted his head to chase the soft lips when they were apart, but a hand on his chest prevented him from doing so. He frowned, and cracked his eyes open to catch his culprit only to see that no one was even there except for a small heart shaped chocolate that had fallen down into the ground when he moved to stand up.
Harry snapped out when he heard a set of steps fading away into the background and quickly reassembled himself to stay focused.
A gasp was heard above him when Harry decided to deepen the kiss by sneaking his tongue in and he mentally noted of the voice that definitely wasn't a girl but Harry was far too gone for the soft lips to even be bothered with it.
When he saw two identical smiles blooming upon Albus and Scorpius’ faces, he couldn't help but mentally sigh in relief. “Now, tell me which book did you read about the curse, Scorpius?” asked Draco as he gestured to the bunch of books around them. “Because these books we're reading are rather useless.”
“Well?” Draco pressed, when Potter only stood there mimicking a goldfish. He waited patiently as Potter gulped, eyes searching into Draco’s eyes before he shut it tightly.
Ron grumbled as they promptly moved to form a small circle. Even Hermione quickly took her place next to Ron- Ginny on his other side. Surprisingly, the twins decided to sit on either Harry's side. He gave them a questioning look and they sheepishly smiled at him.
“Great!” The twins delightfully beamed. “Let's go now!” Scorpius scrambled off Harry's lap, pulling his hand to stand up.
“Enough!” He yells, allowing his magic to flow out of his body enough to parted the fighting students.
Headmistress McGonagall carved a warm smile as she regarded them both. “Nice to meet you both, gentlemen.”
Screw Draco for having a straight man as his crush. Doesn't stop him from approaching though. Sometimes, you just have to try your luck.
” Malfoy parroted in annoyance and growled. “I swear to Merlin I'll never make your life easy if you're the reason I failed this class.”
McGonagall tried to suppress her smile seeing the familiar expression of the child in front of her. “And how sure are both of you of your father's virgin identity?”
It took Draco some moment to comprehend her words, and when it did he gasped at the people in front of him. “You're kidding?”
Henry touched his lips with his thumb, eyeing Harry with a look as if he was caught doing something bad. “I don't know what you're talking about, we didn't do anything.”
Draco openly stared at Potter in shock, as it took a moment for him to comprehend. Maybe he heard it wrong. “I'm sorry, what?”
Thus why Harry had taken his Invisibility Cloak during dinner. He wore them as he waited for Malfoy's arrival at the Gryffindor table, felt Hermione’s hand on him when the white-blond Slytherin finally made his way towards their own table with his friends, he noted that Malfoy discreetly brought his gaze towards them, pressing his lips when he didn't saw Harry which make him smirk in satisfaction. Gleefully, he watched as Malfoy took a seat with his back facing the Gryffindor's, attention grabbed by his friends particularly Par- Pansy who had agreed to his plan wholeheartedly when he went to see her earlier.
When he dragged his eyes to see their reaction, he was not disappointed; both Ron and Hermione sporting faces like someone just cast a Confundus Charm on them.
"Dragon," said Leo softly, voice controlled as he gathered himself carefully. "You're the only person who can perform this role with perfection."
Harry chuckled as he stepped out of the room, silently closing the door behind him. He took a moment to just stare at the door before he walked away, a fond smile carved upon his face when Draco’s voice got higher by the seconds, even through the closed door. He decided to let the two young adults deal with it themselves. It was something that they needed to talk privately, after all. Though, he had to admit, he and his Draco had dealt with it much better compared to their counterparts. Perhaps it was because by the time it happened, they had already forgiven each other, way before they had met each other again years after the war.
With that, they simultaneously turned to the person who had seated himself next to Harry, face slightly annoyed as he bore his blue eyes towards his brother's grey one, clearly unimpressed by his brother's behaviour.
His day goes by like that, and when he was done with dinner, he couldn't help but feel like there was something missing. It was not until he was settled down his bed, propped his blanket up to his chest and ready to go to sleep when the thought has finally dawn into him with a realisation; he sat up in an instant as he bore his eyes at Dean, who's hands occupied with a chocolate as he unwrapped them happily without a care in the world and pop them in his mouth, humming in contentment.
He saw from the corner of his eye as Malfoy shifted in his spot with an unreadable look on his face. “How should I know, Pans. I've never met him, remember?”
Later that day, if his eyes strayed towards the Slytherin’s more often than not on a particular person during dinner, he blamed it on the expensive taste of the heart shaped chocolate.
Draco’s heart decided to quicken their beats at the simple gesture. He covered it up with winks, “I surely will, Love.”
It took Hogwarts a year after the war to be reopened; and naturally, along with his fellow friends who didn't managed to complete their seventh year because of the said war, supplementary of not knowing what to do with himself now that he was officially free from the clutch of a lunatic man, Harry figured he might as well take his NEWTs; not that Hermione hadn't been grinding the idea to both Ron and him the moment she heard that Hogwarts has been rebuilt. Thus, they have come with a mutual agreement of coming back to Hogwarts even before they received the official letters from Headmistress Mcgonagall herself.
"Albus and Scorpius had told me about it." said Draco softly, and Harry was glad that he just said the right words.
"I know," said Draco, "But he won't stop apologising to me even when I said that I already forgive him. Stupid Gryffindor."
Harry strayed him away from the War topic when he saw Draco’s eyes turned glassy, no doubt mind was thinking about what had happened. He himself didn't want to revisit the War, though his trauma and nightmares has been getting better since he has been seeing a mind healer together with Ron and Hermione.
Harry helplessly stared at the door, hoping that he hadn't screwed their silent truce. Since they got back, the Slytherin was nothing but polite not only to him, but to everyone he interacted with. It was as if his self arrogant prat sucked out of his body, leaving a nice version of Draco Malfoy behind.
Draco waited anxiously as Henry closed the door. It was not that he was scared of the older man, it was more of an overwhelming feeling. He can't help but feel nervous around the man, like he doesn't know what to do with himself.
To his great surprise, the baby slows down, sobbing as he takes a broken breath in between calming down his cries. Draco’s heart swells when the baby drops his head on his shoulder, burying his face onto his neck and fist his collar with his miniature hand.
"I won't let him." said Harry, grinning as he waved Parkinson away when the girl walked backwards and shot him with a finger gun. No doubts an influence from Seamus. Harry proceeded his way into the Great Hall, widening his smile when he spotted his friends at the Gryffindor table. It was unintentional, but his first step of operation on making Malfoy his was already on a good path.
He understood now why he was given this particular assignment on a short notice, and why it was a compulsory assignment that must be executed as soon as possible; these two were a Perfect Match. It was rare for two individuals to become a Perfect Match considering that they needed to be matched above ninety percent, and these two individuals managed to exceed the expectation with the percentages over ninety-eight.
Draco shook his head, and slowly moved to the other side of the bed as Harry climbed in, and they worked together to peeled the quilt silently, putting over the warm material over their bodies and they lay down side by side, looking at the ceiling. It was a nice night, and Harry felt content to have Draco by his side. A reminder that being here was a definite chance that he could save Draco’s life. He knew that this time, he could make it happen.
Draco slowly turns only to see a person that he hasn't seen for almost a decade since after the war. He silently regards the other man, not sure with himself if he was truly him seeing that he looks different from the last time Draco saw him.
Okay, so maybe Harry HAS been pining after Malfoy for months, and maybe everyone in Gryffindor DOES know that Harry would murder the minister of magic with a blunt fork for a chance to sit in Malfoy’s lap.
“What’s the problem?” Potter asks, following Draco’s gaze down to the books. Draco watches, head filling with a fog of panic as Harry’s fingers brush over the top copy of The Highs and Lows of Hexes, lift it off to reveal the second: A Guilty Hexer, and when his hand covers that Draco starts forwards.
Kissing Draco... It’s like drowning in a vat of melted chocolate, warm and sweet, tantalising and addictive...
“For what it’s worth, Potter, Pansy is telling the truth. You know, sometimes I think I underestimate that girl.” He kisses him again. “You must remind me to buy her something from Honeydukes’ when I’m next there.”
“It’s like- you take it in turns to ask someone ‘Truth or dare?’” Seamus tries to explain over the sound of a cork being popped off a bottle. “And then, if they pick truth then you ask them a question that they must answer truthfully. And if they pick dare, you get to choose a task for them to carry out and it can be anything. Like, from performing the chorus of A Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love to taking off all their clothes and worshipping the moon on the grass outside I guess. But if they don’t want to do the truth or dare, they can just drink instead.”
“I… Potter, I, I don’t know if you’re even registering this but you’ve been spiked or something, and I’m so sorry for—“
“It doesn’t matter.” Draco’s heart is going so fast that soon Flitwick will be able to use it as percussion for the next school concert. “It- it doesn’t matter. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry for bringing you into this.”
“Impressive,” he says. “Didn’t know you would have it in you. Congratulations, Draco; this is a new one even for me.”
“Unfortunately yes. Unless of course you know someone else who has your name, is in Gryffindor and has ‘thighs like tree trunks’.”
“No… no, you’ve been hexed, it’s a love potion, it’s something, you’re not in your right mind- what the HELL was I thinking—!” He looks at Harry, panicked, fear showing clearly through the sharp contours of his face and guilt manifesting itself in his eyes. “I’d never… I couldn’t… it’s not right, not without… anyway.” He casts his eyes around. “We have to go to Snape or something- oh fuck, hang on, we can’t, imagine explaining that—
, but he has had to do it with Harry AND he’s had to actually seek out a conversation with the girls who keep muttering amongst themselves about ‘slow burns’ and ‘darkfic’ and even though Draco has no idea what they are he can only assume they’re planning to kill him slowly and painfully.
Blaise stares them up and down, perfect features unreadable from where he stands at the other end of the corridor. Harry is breathing hard where he stands before Draco, adam’s apple bobbing up and down. Draco can scarcely hear Blaise’s next words over how loudly his own heart is beating.
He is taller, more filled out around the edges, eyes still darkened but with a sort of peace that Harry doesn’t think he’s seen since second year. He interacts with others more, is more polite, more liked, and the absolute audacity of it all almost makes Harry wish they were having childish spats in corridors again just so that he could keep more of Malfoy to himself, keep his attention for longer, keep the younger years from Gawping at him like he’s Michelangelo’s Statue of David or something.
“Merlin, Potter, I always thought people were exaggerating when they said you had a hero complex. You think you can fix everyone, and anyone who doesn’t want to be fixed must have something to hide. Isn’t it enough that we’re not on opposite sides of a war anymore? Isn’t it enough that we can be,” he swallows, “friends?”
Now, Harry wants to clarify that the only reason he knows this is because the stupid little gang of second year Gryffindor girls will not Shut The Fuck Up about him and Harry just happens to be frequently and coincidentally in the common room whenever we they have their stupid little meetings or whatever.
Dean has quite cleverly hexed the glasses to make sure that anybody lying on their turn would have their glass turned red and would have to drink twice, which at least makes the game a little more entertaining as well as giving it higher stakes.
“How the hell should I know,” he quips, eyes searching his face. “You’re a gryffindor, the famous Harry Potter; what on earth would you want to be in here for? Probably not up to your usual standards, I suppose.”
There’s a general collection of nods and affirmations from around the room, a couple of half-hearted whoops from the braver ones. Harry stares down at his own glass, the house-elves’ cherry gin automatically rising to just below the brim as soon as it’s in his hand. The deep crimson liquid reflects a slightly distorted image of his face back at him as the telltale cheer of a game beginning draws his attention back to the room at large.
“Wanker.” Harry kisses him again, and this time it’s slow and unburdened and he takes his time with it. When they break apart, Draco’s smiling, and Harry feels like killing him for never directing one his way before because it’s so beautiful and sunny that Harry might be blinded by it.
“I wouldn’t worry about it, Draco. You know that here, nobody thinks you’re a deatheater. You publicly apologised to Hermione for all those times you’ve not- well- seen eye to eye and you’ve even been volunteering to help the younger years with quidditch; how can you possibly be the same person you were when you were sixteen? Victoire can stuff her quill up her arse and then broomstick ride all the way to Essex for all we care. Even Harry Potter is being civil with you these days.”
“Problem? There’s no problem, I just… well, I wanted to talk to you about what happened last night.”
Unfortunately it doesn’t stop him being a twat, and Draco likes to gleefully continue being just as patronising and smug as always, taking particular pleasure in taunting Harry at every possible opportunity.
“What do you want, Pansy.” (Harry is impressed, but he’s also Tired and really doesn’t want to be bullied this particular afternoon.) Pansy makes a point of sighing heavily, glancing at at least three separate locations around the library that aren’t Harry, and then finally turning her attention back to him in a way that implies she’d rather be making Christmas cards for every occupant of the hospital wing, perhaps even with glitter glue.
Tragically this is saying something, because there’s this little gang of Slytherin girls who seem to think that if Jesus and Zac Efron had an affair then Potter would be the result, and it makes Draco want to cry. Blaise has suggested that Draco just shouldn’t listen, but Blaise likes pineapple on pizza therefore his opinions aren’t valid. Things sort of come to a head when the Idiot Girls start asking
“Friendship starts with trust,” Potter says firmly. “Look, we can put these books away and then go back to the eighth year dorms? I know I could take a break from studying and maybe we can talk then.”
And, if suddenly Draco is much easier to handle and if he doesn’t start revising six months before the exams, then the Slytherins have Pansy to thank for it and sort of but not really Harry. Pansy enjoys the gratitude, and the chocolate, and so everything is Gucci except that Blaise is Big Mad about the fact that he has to sleep in that bed.
“Shut the fuck up, she said you liked me too and I…” Harry averts his gaze. “I thought it’d be worth a shot.”
However, Draco isn’t sure he can listen to one more conversation about how Potter’s jaw line could slice Gryffindor’s sword in two and Potter needs to tell these girls to Back The Fuck Off before Draco slits his wrists.
So why, why in the name of god, has Harry’s brain decided of its own accord to start obsessing over this walking personality disorder?? Like, not in a romantic way, definitely not, ABSOLUTELY NOT- but whenever Harry’s mind wanders in the middle of A History Of Magic, it always seems to trail along the exact same path which leads to white blond hair and clear blue eyes the colour of the sky on a sunny day... not that Harry had been staring. The thing was, Draco was... pretty. Well, perhaps ‘pretty’ wasn’t quite the word, not exactly, but Draco was at least attractive. He was blond, tall, slender, long fingers with perfectly manicured nails and cheekbones and a jaw line so sharp they could cut glass.
The girls all grin at each other before Small Brunette Girl with Twenty Bobby Pins in Her Hair places her roll of parchment in Draco’s hand with a sinister smile. Draco releases Harry’s wrist and Harry stares at it like he didn’t know he owned A Wrist, and a few of the girls grin at each other.
Draco lifts one elegantly manicured hand and touches Harry’s face, testing the waters, like he’s wondering whether his hand is going to pass right through him. Harry finds himself thinking that it’s going to be ridiculously easy to get Draco kissing him and get his mind off homework, and he then realises how completely fucking outlandish this situation is anyway, but before he can finish his thought Draco slaps him, hard, across the face.
“Truth or dare?” Ron echoes when Seamus first brings it up. “Isn’t that, like, a strategy they use when trying to get people to confess to crimes?”
“Wait, Potter,” he blurts out, and Harry glances up at him. “Maybe… maybe we should talk, right now, I mean— if you’ll just put down the books—“
Draco is beginning to think that perhaps Blaise has a point, and that information is utterly infuriating.
No, Harry concludes at last, she’s probably doing it to make Harry look like an idiot in front of Draco, and there’s no way in hell Harry’s going to innocently tumble right into her scheming little trap.. no fucking way. He’s stupid but he’s not that stupid.
“Good,” mutters the same girl as before, quickly moving her foot out of the way before someone can step on it.
It’s a clumsy affair, trying to find a good angle, but when Harry drops the books in an act of mercy and shock and his hands come up to cradle Draco’s face it feels as natural as breathing. Harry Potter smells like woody cologne and soap and tastes faintly of cherries and feels like a home he doesn’t have.
“I don't mean the two of you.” He waved them away. “I just can't believe-” He stared at the four Gryffindors in front of him. Granger and She Weasley’s faces looked like they had been painted with red, Potter looked rather embarrassed whilst Weasley coughed into his hand.
"Tough luck," nodded Seamus, before he leaned forward. "But I did know it was because they were planning something big, much bigger than those chocolates scheme they pulled."
It happened too fast for Harry to sink it in, but when he recognised it was a body that he had pulled blindly towards him, it was almost too late to save themselves as the person he collided into slipped their feet making them fall backwards but before they managed come into the contact with the floor, Harry grabbed the person's waist with a Seeker's speed and forced his feet to hold their ground. Hands flew forwards to grab Harry's shoulders and he felt another body pressed to his as he bent forward to stop this person from falling.
"If you don't come back to me within twenty four hours, I will kill everything." said Harry, agreeing reluctantly. After all, they were equal in every aspect and he has promised himself that he will never look down upon his lover's abilities. He refused to be an overprotective lover to the point that he was suffocating them. He was scared, obviously, but he knew he needed to put his trust on him.
He nodded in acknowledgement, lips curled up seeing his twins' antic. “Now, do you remember what kind of book you read?”
Harry stared openly at the older man with bewilderment, convinced that he finally lost it. He noticed Malfoy stepped closer to him, inch by inch until he was practically glued to Harry's back.
“Thank you for taking care of my sons while they were here, and I'm really sorry for any inconvenience that they have caused all of you.” said Henry kindly, stroking the twins head gently.
His twins will soon be going back to where they belong, far out there in future. Back to their real parents, the future him and his husband. Until then, he will wait patiently, and accept everything that he will have to get through to reach up that future later.
Albus whooped and Scorpius dropped his jaw in disbelief, “That's it? You just put your trust in us that easily?”
"I just didn't have a clue that the two of us could be friends. I was a bit bewildered." continued Draco.
Harry, who was looking down while playing with his fingers the entire time, looked up hearing the uncertainty in the older man's voice. He blinked when he saw Malfoy was facing the open window, face flushed with red down to his neck, spreading to his exposed chest that got Harry to flustered, heat creeping up his cheeks.
He bit his lips, thinking that perhaps including Draco in their plan was not a good idea after all. But, even if Harry's feelings were reciprocated somehow, Leo doesn't have to be worried because Draco will always do anything for him, he always has. That includes Harry, right?
He decided to play dumb, and narrowed his eyes at them. “I don't understand why all of you are too fascinated with Malfoy’s husband.”
“Come on, surely just for a moment?” asked the stranger, cocking an eyebrow in a very attractive manner.
Draco grinned and ran back towards awaiting Granger, who was tapping her foot impatiently and quickly led her out of the cafeteria. Granger shook her head at him, as they walked around the corner to their classroom, “If Harry's into bollocks, the both of you surely are in a loving relationship by now.”
"Like I said, I just want to see your condition. I might not be able to if I waited for tomorrow." Harry easily shrugged.
“Bloody hell!” Weasley gaped, and Draco rolled his eyes in annoyance. “Honestly, I don't see why that's a shock.”
"I know that." replied Harry, unwrapping his hands around Draco but letting a hand drop at the back of his lower waist, just because.
The luck was on their side as the room was empty the moment they stepped in, though they were amazed to see the whole space clearly screamed a room shared by boys. As soon as their dad stepped out, Albus immediately went to guard the door claiming that he'd done a better job at guarding their dad which left Scorpius to search for their dad's Map, taking too much time for their dad's bed was messy, his things were literally everywhere.
Potter stops right in front of him, standing awkwardly as he eyes the baby in Draco’s arms and scratches his head.
By the way his younger self evidently dropped his gaze down to Draco’s exposed chest, Harry knew instantly what the ruckus was about.
“Of course he's alive,” Scorpius giggled despite the remark, “Papa was just sick, he's not dead yet!”
“You love me more.” Potter frowned in disapproval and Draco sniffed haughtily, “I don't know, Potter.”
Draco sighed, “Yes, apparently the twins did find the cure, using the old way to reverse the curse by making the victims drink a potion brewed with their own pure blood.”
"Oh, this little arrow?" asked Harry innocently, and made a show of giving it a thought before he snapped the arrow into two with a smirk, successfully managed to plant a seed of fear inside Draco. The arrow was a sacred, unbreakable tool and Harry just destroyed it with his bare hand.
“What's wrong?” asked Potter, alarmed, and ran to catch Draco’s hand without thinking. “Are you alright?”
Pansy and Blaise hot on his tail; Pansy worried face mirrored Blaise while the Weasley siblings stayed on their spot, looking agitated. It took Granger a moment to process Draco’s implications before she hitched a breath, “Oh, Merlin.”
Draco sighed when the twins continued to bicker so he moved to wrap his hands around his twins, “Whoever kisses me first, can have the wand.”
This is the moment, this is the sign for him to stop pursuing Harry Potter. He wanted his reasons, and now he got it.
“Don't be an idiot. A simple Episkey can heal this.” He runs a finger to his lips and Harry pull it away as he cast the healing spell softly. He smiled in satisfaction when his boyfriend’s face free of blood and injury, so he dropped a soft kisses on the healed face. Harry pulled away to see Draco smiled at him fondly, reaching out to caress his face. They share kisses again, in between smiles and soft laughter when Harry suddenly remembered something.
“I'm asking again, do you have any excuses for yourself?” Harry repeats his question, pressing the words.
Malfoy looked up to him, expression fond and he took his gaze up from Harry's forehead, his eyes, his cheeks before they landed on his lips. "Do you even like me, Potter?"
“But it's true!” She continued, “Ever since Albus and Scorpius were here! Being a father made them want to get on with you.”
“You know I can't abuse my power, right? Just because I'm a Head Student doesn't mean I can use it every time my boyfriend did something stupid, like get into fights.”
And right now, right in front of him, were his sons. His twins, his future, his happiness and proof that he was definitely going to make it in the future. Tears began to gather around his eyes as he held it down. He shakily smiled before he asked, “Did I carry both of you myself?”
Draco rolled his eyes, "You don't understand, he doesn't need my forgiveness." he sighed then, lips pursed tightly as he threw his gaze towards the open window. "I already forgave him a long time ago."
“Chocolate?” Hermione picked up one of the small packages as she arrived together with Ginny and examined them.
"Well, what do you want to know?" asked Harry, grinning widely knowing that he got his little husband where he wanted him to.
He heard Potter laughed, patting his head. Draco disapprovingly frowned at the man, for messing his perfect hair.
"Look," said Harry, there was no way in the bloody hell he would give when he knew Malfoy felt the same too. "Do you like me?"
“Can we please settle down for a moment?” Malfoy loudly interrupted, stepping away from Harry as he went to pick his robes and covered half naked body. “Honestly, both of you, stop acting like children!”
“Harry, look at this.” said Hermione and lifted the chocolate she has received up to him. Ron copied her action despite his confusion and lifted his own half eaten chocolate close to Hermione’s.
Whilst Harry Potter doesn't seem to mind that Draco flirted with him, showing him his interest or his declaration of his admiration towards the man- he even played along upon entering the seventh month of Draco’s crush on him- there's a slight problem with that.
The baby's face was already red, fat tears running through his small face as they kept twisting their body around, trying to escape from the witch’s hold.
He and Granger gasped simultaneously, grasping each other's hands and threw a dirty look at the red haired man and he heard Potter chuckled at that.
He can't ruin this now. He needs to be patient, because if his culprit and his crush were the same person… Well, he doesn't know what to do yet, but he will figure out something.
"You will never know what will happen in the future. Your friendship with Hermione was something that didn't happen in a day. It took months, years even for the two of you to put a full trust towards each other." said Harry, slowly and softly as he carefully put a hand on top of Draco’s. His hands were cold, always did and it was Harry's job to provide him warmth.
He overheard that the boys would spend their time with McGonagall when Malfoy had to go to his class. Other than that, he mostly saw Malfoy brought his children to the library. Returning to their room- courtesy of McGonagall- with tons of books in their arms and seemingly to be working on something with Malfoy- if those close up discussion they were having given any indication.
There’s a moment of silence before Henry burst out laughing, bending down as he clutched on his stomach. Harry shared a look with Malfoy, both don't know what to comprehend of what to do with the older man.
He gave the man a smile- no matter what, he was still the apple to his eyes. “Potter, what can I help you with?”
“I admit that she's the first person I have a real feelings with but that was a long time ago. We're really good friends now because Ron is my best friend.” Potter explained, catching the new tears of Draco with his fingers, wiping them away.
Harry watched the swaying hips of Draco Malfoy with interest seeing as the man didn't have his robe on and jumped when a hand landed on his shoulder.
They continue to give each other remarks but Harry’s attention was not on them anymore. He threw his sight to where he looked before; where Hermione, Malfoy and the twins sat together, huddling close with the Book of Old Curses in between them.
Harry can feel his lips stretched into a full blown smile. He rolled on his side, pulling his blanket and gathered them up to his chest to form a bundle and wrapped his arms around it, imagining it was Malfoy that he was hugging.
"Potter's boyfriend." said Malfoy eventually, lips curved in a teasing way as he regarded Harry and it took willpower for him not to squirm in his seat.
There were a few moments of silence before it was broken by the loud laugh of disbelief coming from the last person Harry wanted to be in this plan of theirs.
A sudden tap on his office's window grabs his attention, he moves to peer at his window to see a small unfamiliar owl, blinking their eyes at him. Draco takes the small rolled letter tied on the owl’s leg once he let the small bird in, and opens the letter with mild curiosity, only to gasps when he reads the content.
Draco sighed as he followed his two friends’ step into the cold night. He doesn't know what he was doing, going for an unrequited love like that.
Harry merely hummed, not even bothered by Draco’s heated glare as he tightened his grip on Draco, pulling him even closer than before, closing all the spaces between them. Their bodies pressed tightly onto one another, and Draco felt his face hot all of a sudden, spreading down to his neck.
"That's none of your business." Henry turned to him with an unimpressed look. "You may go now, you're not needed. As you can see with your own two eyes, Draco is perfectly fine." He shooed Harry away, much to his annoyance.
Eyes wide with shock as adrenaline ran through his veins, Harry breathed heavily knowing he had managed to save both their necks in the nick of time. More so when he realised he was looking into a familiar pair of grey eyes who was looking back at him with great surprise.
Closing the door behind him, Malfoy has gone with a little bit of Harry's heart with him and he still can't tear his eyes from the door. He prays for Merlin to save him when they become boyfriends soon because he knew that he couldn't survive when the time's come.
Draco smiled at her in thankfulness and received a smile in return. He suddenly felt a set of eyes watching him so he lifted his eyes to meet a calculating green eyes. He raised an eyebrow in question which was answered by a set of shrugged and smiled.
"He's impossible! You know I can't stand him!" Harry marched towards Malfoy, receiving an unimpressed look from the other.
Harry calmly breathed out, while screaming out loud in his head. His culprit was just a few steps away from him and it took him a willpower to stay limp in his bed. His hand made a sudden jerk, muscle protesting for his lack of movement and he's praying to Merlin that he didn't notice that.
“No, I'm fine.” said Malfoy, “Really.” He emphasized when Harry sent him a doubt look. “He didn't do anything to me, it was an accident.”
There was a Japanese proverb that said; 'fall seven times and stand up eight'. Where he had read it, he didn't know but what he knew was he was not going to give up.
They looked at Potter in unison, managed to draw an amused smile from the man. “We need to read more about Time Travel, I guess.” He shrugged.
Irritated, he turned to look over his shoulder only to have his lips kissed in such a brief moment - only lips pressed against another lips - but hard enough to ensure Harry that it was not his imagination. His nose was prodded fondly with a gentle finger when the lips disappeared, and felt something was tucked just behind his back; a heart shaped chocolate.
“You did, papa.” said Scorpius brightly, “You nearly gave dad a heart attack when you went into labour two weeks earlier than expected.”
“Come on, Harry.” called Hermione, as she waited at the door along with the others. “Perhaps there was something that Henry needed to discuss with Draco.”
“You're a virgin!” announced Weasley. He noticed Potter promptly turned his head to Weasley in surprise before he turned back to Draco, dropping his jaw in shock.
Now that he saw Malfoy's condition with his own two eyes, he couldn't help the heavy feeling rested on his chest, gnawing his heart when he ran his eyes over the wounds on Malfoy's face. There was an ugly healing scratch across his cheek down to his lower lip, his cheekbone and forehead was bruised, and there was a healing split near his brow.
He may have become the King of the Demon Regime, he may have his victory, but it was nothing when he had lost everything.
“We noticed.” Hermione pointed out, moved to take a spot and sat by herself. Harry and Ron quickly followed. “They always appeared out of nowhere, and you'd looked like something possessed you.” She continued, and scrunched her face uncomfortably.
Harry grunted, annoyed that his friends basically own his life. So he did what he always did; he sighed heavily and crossed his arms together. "But I really need you to be part of this plan,"
“I don't think so?” He answered then, but Potter rolled his eyes and waved him to get closer. Draco frowned and sent Granger a questioning look but the bushy haired woman just shrugged, gesturing him to go to Potter.
It was in late November on Monday morning, the first time it happened. One moment it was just a regular breakfast within the Great Hall, when a chorus of delighted squeals broke out through the Slytherin’s table which promptly transformed the hall's atmosphere.
He follows the sound of the baby, and feels his heart squeezed painfully when he sees them in the arms of a stressful witch, surrounded by a few wizards and witches who probably tried to calm the baby down themselves and failed.
When they have taken their seats and distributed the drinks to their friends, Harry wrapped an arm around his boyfriend’s shoulder, giving a peck on his cheek before he softly whispered that only Draco can hear,
And he found that not thinking about Potter freed up rather a lot of space. A lot of his time, too (Draco pulled many an all nighter in order to get those badges finished on time). Even when he was offered a residency at St Mungo’s by Hermione Granger’s side (so appallingly high paid that his decadent dining habits and penchant for expensive antique rugs couldn’t resist), and some long discarded, eleven year old part of him started to rustle,
