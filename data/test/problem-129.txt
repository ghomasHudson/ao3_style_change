The town had returned to normal after Fotheringham had been caught. A team of Aurors had come in and rid the place of potions and every other sinister thing lurking in its corners. Harry, of course, had taken nothing to do with it, not since the trial. He and Draco had shown up together, walked hand in hand into the courtroom of the Wizengamot and then sailed happily out again as soon as they could. He thought that at some point he would return to that life more fully, but not just yet.
Draco turned his attention to the pitch, abandoning all hope for his ice-cream. “Shit, they are good.”
“Wait, you’re saying he can’t work a phone?”
Cold fingers pressed onto his cheeks. It was Draco. His grey eyes scanning his face, lips thinned and pressed into a line.
When in reach, Harry caught his hand and turned him around. “Stop, I’m not going to let that happen. You have nothing to do with this.” Draco was looking around at anywhere but Harry’s face. “I won’t let you get caught up in it, I promise. I can…I can go if you think that’s better. You don’t have to be involved at all, I can-“
He didn’t say any of this however, merely nodded briskly and tightened the grip of his wand.
“In that case, I think it wise to refrain from sending it at all.”
“You really are like a cat, you know.”
“So, what gave me away?” Draco sipped his drink elegantly, reclining back on the chair.
“I told you last weekend, the Willow gets you going and then he gives you a Bloody Baron and all bets are off!”
The room around him was in upheaval. Patil had sent a Patronus to Ron and Smith was looking through some type of manual like the useless prick he was.
A breath. “I see. And how exactly does he feel about that?”
Harry chuckled despite himself. “It’s a special that Draco concocted.”
It was another hour before everyone had cleared out and it was just the two of them. When Harry was done taking Draco’s statement, they made their way to the apartment and silently began the routine they had established: tea, shower, argue with the mirror, pyjamas, lie in bed.
“Alright. Number two?”
Draco’s eyes focused sharply on him and he knew that he was now fully awake. Harry waited for the moment Draco would calm, realising it was all over. Instead a sob erupted from his thin chest. One that tugged something loose inside of Harry, something that would from then on have Draco’s name attached to it.
Harry’s mind was in overdrive, straining to think of conceivable way to save the man who was gasping and dying in front of him. Faces floated across his mind. Those he hadn’t managed to save. Snape, Colin, Remus…Sirius. It was as if his brain had short-circuited. No connections being made and panic rearing its ugly head and climbing up his throat.
“Fuck!” He scrubbed a hand over his face and groaned into his palms.
Draco led the way into the small kitchen and put the kettle on the muggle way. This induced a raised eyebrow from Potter but he remained silent, simply watching Draco fetch the cups and tea.
“Well, firstly I’m not that drunk. Secondly, it’s important that I send it now because if I wait till tomorrow then I won’t send it.”
Harry stood from the stool and stretched, it had been a while since he had worked this hard. No wonder Draco slept like a rock. “Ready when you are.”
“Okay, so what do we need to do to keep him alive?”
Malfoy was in the kitchen, humming under his breath and making what can only be described as a mess. Flour was donning the countertops and his face by the looks of it, an egg was on the floor and some blueberries were washing themselves in a bowl in the sink.
Craning his neck, he read the name: The Cock’s Comeuppance. Pictured next to the sign was a rather grim picture of the severed head of a rooster. Lovely.
“You’re doing magic in front of muggles.”
. But he didn’t. Instead made Draco some tea and Harry tried to watch him without being caught.
Draco took a shaky breath and looked at Harry steadily. “I think I’ve always looked at you like this, but only when you were turned around.” He nodded, blond hair falling on his forehead again, then continued getting ready to leave.
“DIFFINDO!”
“How do you know he wants something from you?”
No, he would continue to hold Kingsley off and investigate further. There had to be something else. His gut rarely failed him but he had neglected for so long he worried he was misreading the signals.
He was screaming at the point when Draco slumped forwards on to him. Harry brought him to the floor.
Harry turned on his heel and caught up with Patil to the Apparition points of the ministry.
The fireplace was small and had a fire guard that was black with gold trimming, pink flowers painted on the front. It obscured most of the view of the fireplace itself and Harry wondered whether Draco had consciously meant to conceal the fire with it, perhaps in order to resist the temptation to use it. The thought made him want put his hands on Draco and simply hold him. Admittedly, he had established that this was something he wanted to do all the time.
Potter came up to the bar and sat in front of Draco.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Draco, I’m not sure many of our guests are going to be willing or able to drink that amount of alcohol,” Harry said, trying his best to sound reasonable.
Draco smiled at him.
When the last group were finally out the door, Draco celebrated by pouring himself and Harry a pint and lying down on the actual bar. His legs draped either side. Harry had to look away.
Smith merely gaped and Harry sat on the floor at the front of the table. Two quills were scribbling the transcript of the conversation that was happening and Harry read as fast as he could to get up to speed with this nightmare of a situation.
Harry amused himself by talking to the cat that was perched by the shop’s windowsill. Draco was now entertaining both the girls and the shop owner now and all three were clearly beholden to him. Harry shook his head conspiratorially at the cat. She ignored him and stretched luxuriously, paws soaking up the last of the afternoon sun.
Harry did.
Reaching the containers, Harry crouched to get a better view. Slowly, he peered round to get a clearer look. The light was bright around them and Harry had to squint at first to allow his eyes to adjust.
Harry, again busying himself with the tea, faffed with the cups and added sugar to Malfoy’s and milk to his.
Fotheringham roared with laughter in response.
“Kingsley are you listening to this drivel? I told you from the start it was a daft idea to send this one off to the middle of nowhere to investigate this case. And low and behold, here he is spouting rubbish about a Death Eater assisting with an investigation.”
“Difficult to throw a slimy person. Not enough grip.”
Patil and Jackson (at least Harry now knew Henry’s last name now) headed off round the side. Ron suggested that Harry do the wards as he had more heft when it came to adding weight to spells. Harry was still shit at spells that required any kind of finesse. To him it was the difference between picking a lock to open a door or blasting it off its hinges; he could throw most spells hard enough to make them stick.
“Hi – sorry, you don’t know me, but...I…what were you talking about there?” The two stared at him, mouths gaping. “It sounded…interesting,” Harry finished lamely.
He flew the tent’s flap open without even removing his wand from his sleeve and summoned his Auror’s notebook. Scribbles were in there already, mostly complete rubbish and nothing compared to what he had now. Something was happening in this place, and someone was most definitely feeding these muggles information about the Wizarding world.
Draco’s breaths, shallow and panicked, was the only thing to be heard on the receiver besides some footsteps.
He stepped in further, cautious and trying to be quiet. Draco’s hair was the first thing he saw and then his face. The cuts and the bruise had healed and he was awake somehow.
She studied him a moment, clearly pondering his question. “Hmm, guess not. Can’t take any chances though. I don’t know anything about Skele-gro as I’m not of age yet.”
“Well, it’s really none of their business. But if they speak to anyone in this town about either of us, then they’re going to get an answer. I mean half of the folk here assumed I was your mysterious gay lover the first time they say us in the same room together.”
“Just after ten. How are you feeling?”
The body next to him was curled in on itself and shaking. It was Draco. Helpless sounds, indiscernible to Harry were coming from as he shuddered.
Potter’s mouth opened and closed several times and he finally nodded. Draco nodded too and reached to the top shelf for the tea. He shook it in front of Potter. “Is this okay?”
“Really? Hmm.” He returned to the business of making a mess and Harry, in an attempt to do anything but stand and stare at him, began to make tea.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No.” Harry said with a frown.
Malfoy, or Draco, tripped over something invisible and Harry put a hand on his arm to steady him. “Steady, now…Draco.” He leant heavy on the name this time, deliberately teasing.
“That is the only thing I do in front of them, and they barely even notice. You can check my wand if you’re so concerned. Christ, question me under Veritiserum if you have to just don’t make this into something it’s not.”
The guard held out his hand for the merchandise and Harry complied, red faced and still spluttering.
“You’ve changed, Malfoy. It’s…good. ” He rolled over, back to Draco once more and Draco stared at his back, the curve of his shoulders. “Goodnight.”
“Ha! Your loss. And I wasn’t offering.”
Harry took in the situation before him. The man’s reaction was so sudden, barely even time for him to have ingested something and he had looked perfectly fine when Harry had left the drink with him.
“Whatever you say, Malfoy.”
People loved his enthusiasm and his weird and wacky names for the drinks and the fact that he served the cheapest drinks this side of Britain. Also, it amused him endlessly to hear the muggles ask for drinks with wizarding names. If he were being entirely honest with himself, he also saw it as a small ‘fuck you’ to the ministry for his banishment.
Finally, they reached the apothecary. “Just a moment, Harry, honestly – this is the last one.”
“Yes, or could you not tell I was talking to an idiot?” Draco spat. Harry’s instinct was to flinch but quickly reminded himself that Draco didn’t talk to him that way anymore.
“Wait, you’re annoyed that you are potentially being stolen…and annoyed for potentially being not stolen?”
“Harry, every muggle has a phone. Even the ones with very little money.”
Resolve firm in his mind he shrugged on a hoodie and jogging bottoms. If his prissy younger self could see him now he’d die of shock.
Draco made a point of stopping to talk to the people who had been at the pub last night. When Harry asked him about it he claimed that he was checking whether Smith had done him a favour and performed defunct memory charms on them, that way he could get away with short changing them from now on. But Harry knew he was concerned for them. It warmed him from the inside out.
Harry went along with the teasing, intrigued by this side of Draco he had never met before. One who could tease without taunt.
He kicked at a chair on his way to the drinks cabinet, opting instead for a liquid meal. He took a bottle, some old muggle whiskey, and a glass and went into the front room.
“My hair is incredibly delicate and the ends are ruined from the subpar hairdressing skills of this place.”
This last sounded borderline flirtatious, his voice low and teasing.
“I want you to know: I am not like that anymore.” As soon as Potter began to interrupt Draco pushed on, “I know you don’t believe it, you don’t have to and I am not seeking any forgiveness; it’s not owed to me. But I am different. I was a total bastard as a child and…and cruel as a teenager but so far, as an adult, refrained from anything nefarious.”
“Harry!” Ron’s voice. Rasping with effort.
“Brining me – wait, what are you – am I under arrest?”
“Ah, Draco! Such a pleasure and all alone I see.”
Draco shrugged. “If I told them what I really think I daresay they wouldn’t visit as often.”
Malfoy looked at him as he walked in and smirked. “Did she shout at you?”
“Do you know that this forest is directly connected to the Forbidden Forest? You understand all of the weird and not so wonderful things that live there and yet you’d rather stay?”
“Listen here,” the shite-van owner bellowed from his window, “If I unpack the crates here, you’ll never get it up the bleedin’ hill!”
The man paid and left Harry and Draco standing awkwardly in his wake. A glass smashed on the other side of the bar and Draco almost ran to fix it.
Pans.
“Off. Get off me please.” The owl feinted nipping at his fingers: she had clearly been there for a while. Ruffling her feathers, she stuck out her leg and looked away from him, clearly disgusted at having to wait.
The two discussed business and Harry looked around the office some more to see if there was anything of interest.
Fotheringham was the only muggle who was relatively painless to write to. Many would misinterpret his message as they struggled with his handwriting, which was excellent and one thing he could be proud of, or others would think he was pretentious by how he wrote. Not Fotheringham, however, who once commented that he enjoyed Draco’s letters as he had used ‘exceptional grammar and vocabulary so lacking by the youth in this place!’ Draco had tried not to take the compliment too seriously. Many in the village saw the man as a bit of a nutter, an eccentric. But Draco found him rather amusing and writing his list of obscure mixers was not chore at all.
“Just a little bit mad, I suppose. It’s weird that he didn’t think it best for you to come in too, don’t you think? I mean you’re the one that lives here and knows that place much better than I do. What’s the point in me telling them that when you can more accurately?” Draco’s amusement fell and he looked away. “I knew you wouldn’t want to come in so I didn’t push it, so…”
“Of course he is. He is capable of a great many things I’ve heard.” Draco lays back down and steeples his fingers on his stomach. “And then?”
The first thing he’s hit with is how busy it is. The entire place is packed with people, which explains why the rest of the pubs are empty as he reckons half the town is currently in here.
“No.” Harry said firmly. To soften his disobedience he added a quick ‘Sir’ afterwards. Kingsley sat back and appraised him for a moment. “I don’t mean to be rude, Sir, but I just don’t think it’s a good idea. I think the best option is for me to bring in the memories, have a quick discussion with the detectives as necessary and then I return here and continue with the-“
“No, that’s a cabana, Bernard.”
The supplier in question was an eccentric. Terrifically quaffed hair, peppered black and grey and pale eyes that missed nothing.
“You really shouldn’t be so glum, you know.” Her smile was overly bright, with too many teeth and not enough sincerity. “Many would kill for an easy position – danger free!” Her small hands wiggled in the air as she said this to add the cup of already overflowing humiliation.
Shame prickled down his spine at the mention of it. “I’m afraid I am not permitted to miss Hogwarts. Not anymore.”
“Well, if that’s all you’ve got, Potter I think I may try and sleep now.”
“No. it’s…it’s fine.”
The entrance they had come from banged open and he heard Patil and Henry shout for everyone not to move.
“I mean, between you and I, he was a madman that one, but he was on to something. I mean, this notion of half-bloods and muggleborns breeding with pure-bloods…obscene. Think about it: your ancestry, you lineage, a pure-blood man like yourself – can you imagine marrying a muggleborn witch?”
Draco asked again,
“Well, a muggle-born witch was visiting her sister a couple of months back and overheard some muggles talking about wands, witches, cauldrons – “
“That too. Mostly that I haven’t heard you use any slurs and you’re doing everything the muggle way; I thought that would be beneath you.”
“Been on the trails, have you?”
“Don’t start, you did it in front of me before you knew who I was – “
“No problem, Sir.”
“Of course. Like an ‘asking for a friend’ type of thing.”
“I will.” Harry grinned smugly but faltered when Malfoy grinned catlike, cream on his lips, as if this had been his plan all along.
As he approached, apprehension filled his gut. The pub looked welcoming; window baskets decked in flowers that he didn’t knew even grew this time of year and condensation dripping from the heat and no doubt bodies crammed inside.
Kingsley had the decency to at least look partially guilty. It felt like a crumb of validation for Harry. For so long he had just lived with the discomfort and now, having the chance to air it and see that Kingsley seemed to at least see where he was coming from felt like a victory Harry sorely needed.
“Airways. It closes airways. Slows the heart.”
“You have Harry Potter living with you, do you not?”
“I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. I think everyone expected me to do great things because…of who I am or something but now? I’m not doing anything.”
Harry’s jaw clenched but his voice remained calm, and if he was lucky, slightly threatening. “I won’t have you call him that again, Robards. Understand that.”
Hermione had been delighted that he had a real task to undertake, and Ron had been confused.
“Why not? He seems nice.”
When they had made their way round the warehouse and had signalled to others that they were ready to go in, Harry felt his pulse in his throat but not in the way he had become accustomed to lately. Not the kind he experienced when someone mentioned the war or the dead, their faces, floating and dead coming to hover next to him. Or when someone recognised him in the street, expressed their gratitude, and he would sit numbly for hours, aware of every beat of his heart. No, it was the kind of tension that had him coiled, ready for a fight. Like when he would stretch his hand for the snitch, knew he was winning some fight or when he held Draco between his fingers.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry reached out a hand to his shoulder in an attempt to wake him. “Draco? It’s okay. You’re okay, wake up.” It seemed to only disturb him further as the shaking doubled and wet, cries were being shaken from his chest.
The camping shop was bustling with a mixture of tourists and locals picking various…well camping equipment he supposes. There isn’t anything he particularly needs but finds the tools they have to offer quite interesting. He scoffs at how useful some of them would have been on his previous camping trip.
Draco slowly pulled his hands away from his face and gaped at him. “That’s why you’re here? To talk about the names of the drinks? You nearly gave me a bloody heart attack you stupid prick I thought you were carting me off to Azkaban?”
“I’m questioning him. Leave it alone.”
Draco Malfoy was standing in a muggle bar currently drenched in fruit juice for the third time that day. He was attempting to use the blender but was having trouble working the buttons and remembering to put the lid on.
“Don’t be a git,” Harry smiled. “Put your shoes on.”
A slow, unsteady breath left him; leaving the feeling of his lungs twisting in its wake. The watch on his wrist told him it was just after midday. He could do this. Close off his thoughts, smile, breathe, move on – only six more hours to go and then he could be free. Could sit in his kitchen by himself and take in his first real breath of the day. This he could manage.
Draco started babbling incoherently, arms wrapped around himself. “…couldn’t get him out. The fire…can’t go near the fire…he was there…that fucking snake…terrible things…I did terrible things…”
Harry had cackled wildly and shoved him. People behind the bar clapped wildly, perhaps assuming it was part of the show. Draco just winked and continued to light sparklers with a snap of his fingers.
“Yes, I’ll bet. Well, my friend would be happy to talk to him about it. As he is also…not straight. Far from it actually.” He smiled nervously, eyes flicking to Harry and then away again.
And then he was gone. Harry scrubbed at his eyes and groaned into the empty room. Loneliness seemed to be perpetually perched on his shoulder, shooing away any semblance of company, greedy in its want for him to be alone.
This had eventually led him to serving his own mad creations to muggles at a fraction of what he should have because what even was muggle currency and…it had somehow worked out. He ran the most popular pub in the town and people liked him and they fucking loved his drinks. Mainly because he was confused about measurements and mixers and his drinks were ninety mostly pure alcohol.
“Aye, that’ll do it. Need to get yourself fed and watered I suppose and then something to put you to sleep for a while. I recommend a large dose of Skele-gro. Disgusting, but gets the job done.” She laughed heartily while Harry stared at her. “Well, if you’ve been round these parts a couple days, you’ll know what I’m talking about. Have a nice night, son.”
The room was hot and sweat pricked at the back of his neck. Draco was a sea of skin and heat pooled in Harry’s stomach at the thought of it all under his fingers, of Draco under his hands.
“A muggle collapsed, poisoning – potion obviously. Considering that the suspect trusts the Malfoy boy, Smith thought it appropriate to send him in for some intel. I’m not really sure what all this is,” he gestured to the equipment Smith was muttering into, and Harry marvelled, not for the first time, how this man got a job in detecting, “But I believe it to be some type of communication device. Malfoy has something in his ear that means he can hear Smith and Smith can hear him. Apparently close to a muggle invention he was saying. Malfoy looked quite terrified to be honest.”
Draco’s voice was only a little shrill as he said it.
Harry felt endless. Endless as Draco stared, heavy lidded, up at him and free as he moved his hips in time with Draco’s breaths.
“Ah well, you needn’t be. I’ll get a little bag for you, hold on.”
“Third year.”
“Oh, morning. Hope you don’t mind,” he gestured the magazine, “I just didn’t want to move and wake you.”
“You did.”
“Well, that’s not exactly a reason not to trust him.”
An emotion Draco couldn’t identify washed over Potter’s face and then his lips drew into a thin line.
A healer, a middle-aged woman of Harry’s height and almost his build emerged from the room and took in the sight of them both.
“Now?”
It was dead silent in the room. Harry felt the familiar wave of humiliation at again being asked to stay away from the fray. It particularly stung coming from Kingsley, however. He thought of Draco, who had basically outted himself to this nutter and spouted a bunch of shite about muggles under the pretence of getting the guy to trust him. Draco, who had barely spent any time with anyone magical in two years and who had immediately refused to defend himself when faced with Smith. The thought of him being vulnerable and alone while random Aurors come near him made something vile bubble in Harry’s stomach.
“I told you, my boarding school was in Scotland. I understand what you’re saying, but it’s easy for one to get confused when you begin babbling nonsense about rockets and whatnot.” He threw his arms in the air at this and small spray of juice went flying onto the bar.
Draco coughed, disguising a laugh. “Of course, Fotheringham this is Harry. Harry meet Fotheringham.” Fotheringham clapped in response and then walked away causing them both to hurry after him.
“Not that we know of.” Kingsley had a familiar gleam in his eyes, he had always loved a good mystery.
“And others have for more. We don’t get to choose how people feel about us, Draco. We just get to try.”
The portkey was a tattered looking book which on closer inspection was the rules of various muggle drinking games where having your opponents strip was the primary objective. Someone in the portkey department had a strange sense of humour. They seemed to forgo the usual tea cups and other everyday objects for the unusual and often, plain bizarre. Robards had put his foot down when they had a sent an old muggle sex toy that everyone had refused to touch as they didn’t know where it had been. As a result, a bunch of Aurors were stuck in Wales for four hours until another, more suitable, portkey was sent. Later on at the pub that night, Harry had laughed at them and said they were ridiculous and asked if they were overly familiar with all of their portkeys. Clearly unamused by his mockery, a rumour started that Harry himself had a penchant for antique muggle sex toys. He stopped going to the pub after that.
Harry just shook his head and smiled, silently relived that Ron was still talking to him considering the stunt that was pulled this afternoon.
Draco paused and took in the sight before him. Harry Potter was in his bed. They were about to sleep in the same bed. He felt that he would have risen in fourteen year old Draco’s estimations.
“What am I doing? What the fuck does it look like? I’m working, earning a living, pouring pints.” The last was said with a flap of his arms. “Well not really pints as such, more cocktails and things but I do have lager, lots of it. Oh, Christ!”
“I think he might do that, especially since he is the reason for my friend’s sudden...interest in exploring this…” He gestured to nothing in particular as a way to explain himself.
“And you’re still happy with this, mad as it is?” Draco said this teasingly but from the way he bit his cheek there was the slightest hint of apprehension to Harry’s answer.
The place was a mess. Juice and booze lined the counters and the glasses piled high in the sink, threatening to topple. Draco was confronted by the stark difference between his current and former life. If he had known at fourteen this was how he would be spending his time he would have felt humiliated. At seventeen…at seventeen he would be surprised he was still alive and in one piece.
“No, I want to…I’m just thinking about how best to explain it,” Draco said simply.
They hadn’t turned the soft lamps off yet and instead lay on top of the covers exhausted and relieved both.
Stuffing it in his pocket, he walked out the door.
“Fine,” he said blandly.
“So…so the Finnegan things and – and nifflers…those are names of – “
“What? Why the fuck would you do that?” Draco had sat up on his elbows to study Harry, his eyes wide and face pinched in confusion.
A shaky breath left him and he cursed himself for getting caught up here and leaving Draco for so long. He had told him he would be quick.
“You – I…I mean…you’re wanting me to…with you?”
The loud rapping at his door knocks him out of his stupor.
Harry flushed, he had forgotten that. The longer he spent with Draco the more difficult it was to remember his past, what he had done. “Oh, right.” Harry chewed the inside of his cheek. “Can you side along?”
“I’d say Bloody Baron. Nice and refreshing,” Bernard said and begun rubbing his round stomach. Christ, he better be quick with the questions.
“We’re not stupid, Malfoy –“
“Aye, just a few drops before they go out and play. Put it in their water and they’re right as rain when they go out.”
“You have to be in the right frame of mind to be a decent person? Most people try it from birth you know.”
“So,” he began, “you’ll take Malfoy’s statement – perhaps away from here – and then when you’re done send it over to me.” Harry nodded and Draco continued to look at the floor, at anywhere but Ron it seemed. “You alright with that, Malfoy?”
“What – what are you doing here, Malfoy? You’re doing magic in front of muggles and telling them about our world? What are you doing to them? Have you forgotten about the Statue of fucking Secrecy?”
When he finished laughing, Draco’s face had taken on a more serious note. “Harry…when you go to speak to you delightful colleagues – what will you tell them about where you’ve been living?”
Kingsley could clearly smell some sort of victory as he smiled mischievously and leant back in his chair, arms stretching over his head.
How Potter had managed to stay here for however long was beyond Draco, then again Potter was definitely made of stronger stuff.
“Anyway,” Ron sighed heavily, picking at fraying arms of the chair. “Everyone’s heading to the pub, if you fancy it.”
Tempy smirked again, a bright red corkscrew curl falling into her eyes. “It’s not exactly rocket science, is it?”
With a final shove at his chest, Potter finally let him go. “You’ve got a minute to explain yourself, Malfoy or I’m bringing you in.”
“You’re so impatient, I’m getting there. Next, he would spend more time with his friends and not push people away so much.”
“Course they do, I’m not poisoning them.” Scott laughed heartily and then screamed at some poor sod called Johnson to pick his feet up.
“Turn round. Wait for the picture.”
“No. Quite alright. Anyway, I should probably head over there now. I’ve got my wand just in case. He asked for me to come alone.”
When Draco finished the last of tea he put in down on the counter with some finality. “Bed. I’m shattered.”
Not much longer, Harry’s mind intoned. He opened his mouth to say something, anything, but a gruff call from Robards stopped him.
“Drink up, lad!” She said and raised her two bags full of chips in farewell.
Currently, Draco was lying on the floor, legs splayed and arm thrown over his face. Harry was sat cross legged on the fluffy rug, back against one of the soft arm chairs. His eyes were trained on the small stretch of pale skin of Draco’s stomach as he stretched languidly.
It had been the only time in his life that he had felt timeless, tied to the earth through salt and breath. Draco had cried and they had laughed about it. Harry’s lips had kissed them away, cherishing each one as they melted Draco and changed him into something that was Harry’s.
“Tempy that’s just rude. I show great promise, you said so yourself.”
Vanishing the broken glass and empty bottles he made a list to send to Fotheringham, his eccentric booze supplier. It was always an experience to meet him in person. He either would not show up to their agreed meeting place or, when he did, greet Draco like a long-lost friend and ply him with strange sandwiches. Draco remarked to himself again on what a peculiar life he now led.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“Not yet.”
Draco was cursing quietly behind him and trying to keep everyone back from the two of them.
At one point, Draco had upped his antics with his bottle tossing and Harry was impressed with his ability of wandless magic. When he mentioned this to him, mouth close to the flesh of his ear, he had received a ‘God, Potter, stop talking about my wand so much! Seek help already, it’s an addiction!’
“Oh please, Draco, half the town is talking about him.”
“Harry – the girls were talking about this new cream.” He held it carefully between long, pale fingers.
Harry had to supress a smirk at his flushed cheeks. “Sorry,” Malfoy said with a wary smile. “Not used to having people in my bed.” Upon this confession, his face reddened even further. “Are you hungry? For breakfast? Do you want breakfast? I’ll make breakfast.” And then he was practically jumping out of bed and marching towards the kitchen.
“Wait, Harry – it’s fine, not your responsibility anymore mate.” Ron’s brown were knitted together and was looking at Harry strangely.
“But you said it wasn’t too limey! Four limes constitutes as very limey!”
Kingsley nodded and laughed kindly. Harry was aware of Draco sitting uncomfortably at the edge of the sofa, attempting to remain out of view from Kingsley.
He distantly heard Ron calling for Patil, some small part of him only vaguely aware of his surroundings.
The breath that was held in his chest found its way out, cracking halfway. It was like opening a dam from inside him. He was aware of the mild shaking of his shoulders and the way his chest ached, as if it had been stamped on.
He looked so young then, just a boy. A boy with a beautiful face and sharp edges. Tears fell and hung on his chin, unsure of where to go.
The stag disappeared.
“I…I don’t…I think I’m going to give it a miss tonight.”
He backed away from the mirror and over to the toilet. How did Malfoy live with this thing? From the sink, the mirror was listing all the ways his face was wrong and how if he just listened to her (it?) then all his worldly problems would be solved.
It felt as if someone was playing some elaborate practical joke and he was just about done.
“Merlin’s right arse cheek, not again!”
He rolled his eyes at himself. It had taken at least two years for Draco to unlearn all his past behaviours. He had to continually work at it. Stitch by stitch he unwound all his supposed beliefs and opinions and examined then, usually lay like this after a busy night at work. It was a tedious process, but worth it. It was so typical of Potter to just show up unannounced like a hurricane and send all of Draco’s good intentions running for the hills.
To stop himself from staring at the way the veins in those pale arms were showing, Harry set about firing all the cleaning charms he knew at various areas of the room. Floor, ceiling, tables – anything away from the bar and the man lying atop it, stretched out like a cat.
Kingsley was talking through what they were going to do about the case.
Draco preened. “Well, thank you. But I used to be prone to acne as a teenager and I can be terribly self-conscious about it.”
There was something inside Harry that still wanted to hold back when it came to interacting with Draco. He was unsure what is was but felt it all the same.
The town was fairly busy at this time in the afternoon. Locals were traipsing in and out of the bustling shops, many of them waving at Draco and some even had a smile for Harry.
“Yeah. Mental. Congratulations.” Harry tried to smile, his heart racing beneath his ribs at how Ron might respond. The man had lived in Harry’s shadow for over ten years, Harry wasn’t sure how much longer that could be endured.
“You’re from one of the most prestigious families in Britain, full of money, Harry fucking Potter is staying at your dank little flat – do you really think you can fool us?”
Of all the fuck-ups he had managed in his lifetime this had been the one that was the most ridiculous. He had made a drink that took the piss out of Harry Potter and had stupidly given said drink to Harry Fucking Potter. It seemed he was certainly atoning for his past sins, one painful, cringing moment at a time.
His eyes shot open and his brain tried to adjust to the sight in front of him.
He was really panicking now. Mouth dry, palms sweating and a small tremor in his body tell-tale signs that he had about five more minutes of normalcy before all hell broke loose within him.
“- or their alibi said they were at the pool but you knew for a fact that they had only gotten a perm the day before and therefore could not possibly even conceive the idea that they would be in the pool-“
“Wait, wait, wait – will you ask me lots of questions and wait for me to come up with the wrong answer –“
Harry’s eyes took in the rest of him. Long limps with the faintest hint of hair dusting them. His hair held a slight curl at the end and had fallen on his face in sleep.
“Darling, it’s been dreadful! That’s why I was coming to see you, I’m desperate for a little brandy.”
It was only when Harry was beginning to lose hope for the third day in a row that he got somewhere.
“No, you’ve to report for the Portkey room and then await further instructions. I think you’ll be travelling with someone too.”
Harry, who had never known what was good for him, ploughed on. “I just…I want to know why. Something doesn’t sit right here with –“
“Ready?” Draco asked.
“No…but I feel that I deserve an explanation for your need to call stuff after wizarding things in front of muggles. It’s weird, you’ve got to admit.”
“Harry! Come in.” Kingsley’s presence alone could fill up an entire room and when directed at you it felt rather overwhelming.
“Right. Well, I’m at a bit of an impasse with that I feel.”
The nip at his ear was less comforting and seemed to send an alert to this brain to wake the hell up. He grumbled and cracked an eye open. A round, amber eye was peering back at him. An owl was sitting on his chest and staring down at him with a look that can only be described as disappointment.
Harry felt his face heat. An anger that never seemed too far away came back suddenly and made itself at home in his chest.
“Knock, knock!”
Thanks for reading!
Draco’s eyes were roaming his face as if trying to commit it to memory and Harry almost couldn’t comprehend it. For it was almost painful looking at Draco, at his face and his hair. His lips. It caused and ache that went from his heart to his stomach. And to touch him? It awoke every nerve in his body.
Draco woke with start. Something he had been dreaming of had either finally stopped or finished him off and his mind had thrown him headfirst into consciousness.
Harry’s mind was reeling as he staggered out of the shop, shock coursing through him. Regular muggles in this tiny town talking about things they should have no idea about and in an entirely blasé manner. As if it was normal.
Swallowing a wave of nausea for the second time that day, he opened his eyes and took in his surroundings.
Draco’s face conveyed little to how he was feeling which Harry didn’t take as a good sign. “I see. That’s to be expected I guess. It’s just been so long since…since I was at home that I forget.”
Draco scoffed at the dig and the question. “That’s my point; I haven’t done anything. I am following all of the conditions of my parole and am now a remarkably pleasant citizen in the muggle world so please, pray tell, why you are showing up here and ruining my perfectly good shirt and Tuesday night?”
Harry swallowed thickly and moved his way towards Ron. He was surrounded by people but as soon as he saw Harry he moved towards him.
“Yup. Let’s go.”
The quills and parchment shuffled themselves over closer to Harry as he put the receiver to his ear. It was difficult to follow the conversation to begin with and jarring to hear not only Draco’s voice but Fotheringham’s silky tones coming through as well.
“Booze. Talking about booze.”
Ron nodded slowly. “Patil, you’re going with Harry. Apparate somewhere conspicuous – flat would probably be best. I’ll be along in a minute after I talk to Kingsley and Robards. Go.”
“Almost as if they’ve been dosed with something kind of weird?”
Harry frowned and Draco smiled at him, touched his face delicately. “You’re so beautiful. How did you get to be so beautiful?”
Draco hadn’t said much. Had instead busied himself things around the apartment but Harry knew he was worried. People were coming into his home and looking for evidence on a criminal, it was understandable that he was paranoid about himself.
“Hi – can I get two shots of Firewhiskey, three small Pissing Poltergeists, a Grey Lady and a…” She scrutinised the board with the drinks list, “…a Flirty Flitwick.”
Harry could hear his hands clap together in supposed triumph.
Ron raised his hand to get him to stop, it hurt more than he would have expected. Patil was staring at them both curiously. “Give me a minute,” he said and then left the room.
“Third year.” He smiled and looked at him and suddenly Harry felt terribly fond. “You were flying. I was on the ground dressed as a dementor, you may remember that time I was a massive wanker, and you thought it was real and shot a Patronus at me.” He chuckled softly. “I remember being terrified and humiliated and furious and so in awe. Anyway, I’ll never forget how you looked. Just all fierce and daring and so powerful at that age. And I remember thinking, I’d do anything to be near someone so powerful, so beautiful.” The words swirled around them. Fierce and lovely and terrifying circling above them like mist. “But I was such a prick and you hated me so the only way I could get a taste of you was to be an evil little swine and have you turn the power on me. And you never failed, Harry.” The smile was sad this time and Harry’s ears strained for any sounds Draco would make. A breath, a word, a heartbeat. “What will you do now?”
Harry was scanning the front pages of the local papers in an attempt to keep tabs with whatever mundane activities were happening in town, only vaguely aware of the conversation going on next to him.
Draco replied, a shaky breath escaping him. Harry could only hope Fotheringham hadn’t heard it.
The promise of what tomorrow could bring was something to be hopeful for and Harry felt a contentment settle deep in his bones.
Draco spent the majority of the morning testing various alcohols in his cellar for traces of potion ingredients and Harry quizzed him on anything suspicious Draco had experience while living there.
“Accio Order of Merlin.” His voice thudded dully off the walls of his small office before the black leather box flew to his hand. Calloused fingers wrapped around it, cool and heavy in his palm. Flicking the clasp the box snapped open its jaws and his eyes took in the medal within. The medal that he was continually instructed to wear at these events and, even long after he had taken it off, could still feel the weight of it, pinned to the fabrics of his robes or, as it truly felt, through the flesh underneath.
“Oh, hello, Potter. Smith sent in the Malfoy boy to the suspect’s house.”
“Are you serious about him?” She asked the question as one might ask to pass the salt. He felt more indebted to this woman than he could put into words.
“Ha! You’ve had one too, eh?” He looks Harry up and down. “Recently by the looks of it.” He then resumed his conversation, the other man laughing loudly causing a woman to tut as she walked past.
“Not the Manor; home. The wizarding world I grew up with. The only thing I know. I must alert the ministry if I intend to stay more than twenty four hours in a wizarding town. I…I haven’t known anything else besides the world I grew up in and I know that my education on anything outside of my world was severely lacking but…I can’t go home. Have you ever felt homesick?”
Harry kept his eyes on Draco in an attempt to puzzle what was causing him to act so weird. “Right.”
The door was suddenly thrown open and Harry jumped in the chair that his limbs were spilling over.
He smiled warmly at her although she couldn’t see it, too busy trying to make the bar floor not quite as sticky, an endeavour that Draco had given up on.
Harry’s mouth had opened slightly when Draco had brought him to the estate. The door had swung open, itself dramatic, and the man literally jumped out, arms in the air shouting Draco’s name.
Harry didn’t say anything and continued grin lopsidedly at him. Draco, who could never back down when it came to Harry looked smug that he had no retort. “What?” he said haughtily. “No comeback?”
The woman he is making the drink for cheers and claps wildly and he smiles wildly at her and winks as she puts a tip in the jar.
Harry awoke to the sound of sobs. Disorientated, he sat up, straining his eyes to see with only a sliver of moonlight coming through the window.
When the lights were finally out, he lay awake for a long time. Thoughts got tangled up in each other. He turned over to face Draco to find him also awake. Long fingers were tapping rhythmically on his chest.
“Nothing sinister we don’t think. But basically, it seems like someone is breaking the Statute of Secrecy – muggles are talking about things they shouldn’t know about is the gist of it.”
“Think about it, right? He has all this money, he’s invested in different businesses it seems. He works with the woman at the apothecary – who, by the way, can’t even remember who her supplier is for the acne cream that is definitely a potion. The rugby team are using a liquid luck potion - 100% and –“
“Yeah…yeah, fine. Excuse me.” Harry nodded and headed towards the door. Alarms screamed all around and a security guard stomped over red faced and nasty looking. He began barking questions at him and everyone in the small shop was staring, clearly enjoying the show.
His thin lips parted in a delicate but delighted smile. Hips swaying to the music, corny as it was. The muggles behind the bar couldn’t see some of the intricate footwork he was managing but Harry could. Long legs spinning, twisting, and turning. His hands threw bottles in the air, behind his back and he made a spectacle of only catching it at the last moment. Seeker’s fingers outstretched for their victory. The shouts from the patrons, thud of the music and flashing lights of the room did nothing to detract from him.
Years ago, when Harry had first came out, Ron would have been profusely apologetic and claimed that, while Harry was definitely handsome – he was most definitely straight. Harry had eventually lost count how many times he had explained to Ron that, despite having a dick, Harry was not attracted to him. At all. In any capacity. Ron had eventually taken the hint and regularly offered to wingman for Harry. It never worked, obviously. Ron was incredibly straight and seemed to send everyone who liked dick, male or female, running for the hills.
“Come again?”
“Only because I was never given the chance! Those detectives you’re talking about graduated from the academy at the same time as me but the difference is they were allowed to do their bloody jobs while I was paraded around in front of cameras. I am not doing that again, Kingsley – I can promise you that.”
He exhaled a shaky breath and pressed his lips to Draco’s. It was the first time they had kissed with clear minds. No alcohol or tears or jubilation. Harry kissed him because it seemed like the only possibly thing he could do in that moment. Words or looks just wouldn’t cut it.
“Pretend that everyone in that room believes I am entirely innocent. And I don’t blame them, it’s not like I haven’t fucking poisoned someone before. Christ!”
“Nope. But it’s great stuff so it is.” He then nodded to them both and then stepped onto the field.
“Bit of a big thing to forget to specify.” When Draco raised his eyebrow at this, Harry added, “I mean not that I think you would do anything with it. I know that, just…weird is all.”
“I will.”
“Business.” Fotheringham said simply.
When he had first gotten his job in the pub, Draco had wondered why Tempy was impressed with his work ethic. It took him a couple of months to realise that it was because he was using magic, and therefore got the work done in no time at all, and she was in fact impressed at his superhuman speed. When Draco was ill for a couple of weeks last year, Tempy had strong-armed her nephew in taking over his roles. When she discovered that he had taken four times as long as Draco had, as he was obviously sans magic, she had continually berated him and the poor sod had taken packet of pickled onion crisps to the face as a reward.
“I can’t believe you just said ‘no’ to the minister of magic. Are you mad, Potter?” Draco looked as if he were trying to hide a smile.
“Christ, someone Confund me so I can forget this conversation.”
Harry’s mouth opened uselessly and then snapped shut. “There’s no way….”
“Fuck off.”
“So why are you here then? With all these muggles?”
Holding his wand high above his head, Lumos shining brightly and illuminating the mass of trees above.
Voices of different kinds could be heard distantly as their hosts scuttled around to get a better view of what was happening. From the corner of his eye he could see the little row of cottages perched along the cobblestone, appearing disgruntled at the ongoing ruckus disturbing their usual peace.
Draco smiled, “Go on.”
“You don’t trust him either.” Draco accused.
“He won’t be any different than normal then, will he?”
“I am making pancakes, as if that wasn’t obvious and stop talking about how weird it is. You’re making it weirder.”
Harry looked at the faded envelope in his hands and the previous night’s ridiculousness came back to him with an accompanying wave of nausea. It was from Kingsley. A personal letter, from his personal owl to Harry himself.
The flat was the opposite. Warm, cosy and inviting with soft furnishings and bare wooden floors. Tempy, being his boss and landlord, had thankfully given him free rein to decorate it how he pleased, and Draco took liberty in doing so. Yellow and white gingham curtains donned the kitchen window and enough pillows to open a personal soft furnishings shop on every seat. His bedroom was the only room that hinted at his life as a wizard. Green and silver sheets on the bed, one waving photo of his mother, a few books he ignored. That was all he had; all he could bear at present.
“Shite, I’ll be there myself then. Need to get pissed all on my own.”
Harry carefully brought out the small bag from his rucksack that contained the small vials and held them out to Robards who leant forward careless and made to snatch them from him. Harry held them tight and addressed Kingsley whilst keeping his eyes on Robards. “Sir, I want it to be known that I was present for Draco’s memories. I was under the invisibility cloak at the time. The things that Draco mentions in the memory are not his true opinions…anymore. He saw an opportunity to get the suspect onside and thought that was the best way to do it. It greatly helped the information we got.”
His smile turned tighter then. “Yeah, thanks.”
With a huff he collapsed on his bed and stared at the ceiling. There was some odd damp spots in the corners and some of the paint was peeling. Long fingers drummed on his stomach as he thought of Potter in that bloody forest in a tent. He was probably too pig-headed to even put up wards, relying instead on good old Gryffindor bravery.
“Please don’t make me do any more research on your strange phrases, I can barely keep up as it is.”
“No, no, no…don’t…please don’t be embarrassed, it’s honestly okay. I mean, if anything, I’m the one that should be…” Harry trailed off.
“Please, let’s not pretend.”
“Right. And we have to do it by hand I suppose?”
Fotheringham answered almost right away. He was dressed in the most ridiculous set of pyjamas Harry had seen. Silky and royal blue with garden gnomes dotted around the soft material. On top was a dressing gown complete with fur lined cuffs and collar. A drink was held loosely between his fingers and his eyes were glinting.
Harry was in full strategy mode, firing Draco with questions about the town and its inhabitants. He knew he was probably going overboard, throwing questions that Draco had already answered, but to his credit the blond was patient and also clearly concerned with the events that were unfurling in his new home.
Harry was midchew when he spoke. “What?”
Someone at the back of the pub was screaming about changing the song and money was thrown at the jukebox in the corner. The man who was still dancing on the table began to cry at the sound of Dolly Parton’s ‘9 to 5’ being played.
It had a mixture of different liquors in it that shouldn’t go together but Draco’s alcohol addled brain thought it was brilliant and he was going with his instinct.
“Yeah but what if there’s someone else? A witch of wizard living here and –“
“Sure. Grab those two glasses. No, the ridiculous ones with the big heads– there’s a theme here, you must understand.”
The man did a double take then and his brow furrowed. Draco kept smiling and grabbed a glass and began to make a drink off the top of his head. The other night he had gotten a bit overwhelmed when Pansy had mentioned something about the war in her letters and he had spent the rest of his night with the jukebox blaring and creating the masterpiece that was this very drink.
He tried to hide his gulp. He had thought of this and when he couldn’t come up with an answer that felt comfortable and uncomplicated he put it out of his mind altogether. If he said that he was indeed sleeping with Draco Malfoy, in more ways than one, then surely they would be questioning his sanity or accuse Draco of cursing him or something. If he denied that he was staying with him, due to embarrassment of sleeping with a man or that the man was Draco then it would hurt them both in vastly different ways. He braved a look at Draco who was watching his little dilemma with fading self-confidence and the familiar feeling of ‘fuck it’ began to take hold.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I keep questioning things. Things about myself that  I  know are there but I haven’t really thought about before.” He sucked in a shuddering breath. “I think perhaps it’s always been there but I’ve avoided thinking about it. Like right now, I’m talking and thinking about it without actually talking or thinking about it.”
The Auror beckoned him in and he followed, reminding himself to breathe. The room was stifling and packed to the brim with bodies. Robards was in the middle of a speech.
Patil shouldered him out the way, began humming spells over him. Harry was reminded of a time like this before. Where Draco had been on the ground gasping, red all around him and someone trying desperately to save his life. But he hadn’t been in love with Draco then, it had hurt in a different way.
Draco just smiled at him, fingers at the nape of Harry’s neck.
Harry started immediately, mentally thanking Hermione for her knowledge of healing spells and persistence on forcing her knowledge upon others. “Send a Patronus to the ministry while I do this –“
“No, it’s four limes!”
Harry heard Draco shift in his seat. When he spoke next his voice was husky, bordering on flirtatious,
Somehow leaving this weird little town and leaving Draco was causing some kind of dilemma within him.
“Okay.” Draco breathed deeply, exhaling on the words, “Goodnight, Harry.”
Harry grimaced but nodded all the same.
The chiming of the shop’s door brought him out of his memories.
“The north of Scotland, not too far away from Hogwarts actually. I’d like you to investigate.”
“No, sir – I…I meant it. I just…I guess I didn’t mean to send it at midnight. While drunk. But the resignation is real – I am handing in my notice.”
Harry had never been one with words. Ever intense and impulsive. And that was why, without much thought behind it, other than to give Draco some sort of port in the storm that was brewing within him, he pressed his lips to Draco’s forehead. And cheeks. His nose, his chin and finally, when the sobs had lessened and the tremors were distant, his lips.
“People haven’t for less.”
They had found nothing so far. Absolutely nothing. His body was coiled tight as if with the lightest pressure he would spring apart.
It was cramped. So much so that Harry wondered if Malfoy had shrunk it slightly to make the bedroom a little more spacious. It would be the only way he could have fit that bloody big bed in.
“And…and you want me to go there? And figure out what nutter is talking to the muggles about goblins.”
He finished sorting the tea and they drank in silence, leaning against the counters. He wondered if Potter found it strange that Draco knew how he drank his tea. Potter didn’t say anything but Draco wondered all the same.
“Sorry, did you not want sugar?” Harry asked.
“Seriously?”
“Right, right, right, HE would fix up his house. It’s massively in need of a renovation and has lost some of its former beauty – that would be the first step in turning his life around and doing things because he wants to.”
There were footsteps to the side of him. The air wobbled slightly and then Potter was, for the second time that night, stomping towards him.
After pulling at his hair for what was the first of many to come after it, he made his way upstairs to get himself ready for the shitshow that would be the rest of this day.
“Thanks?”
It wasn’t exactly what he wanted but he thought better than to push Kingsley any further. The older man rubbed the back of his neck, dark eyes twinkling mischievously. “Robards is going to be a pain in the arse over this, Harry. I hope you realise that.” He quirked a smile at him.
“Draco you didn’t do anything.” Harry could see his sharp features even in the fragments of light left in the room.
The next thing he takes in is how bloody loud the music is. The song ‘500 Miles’ is booming from the speakers on the walls and the crowd randomly scream the lyrics. One person, a middle-aged gentleman, is on a table and looks as if he is singing to redhaired woman behind the bar. She is shaking her head in response and passing him a drink of something weirdly colourful for his efforts.
“I can see that.” At this point, a player that could almost rival Hagrid for body mass thundered past and practically threw one of the other players in the air. “Wow, what are you feeding them?” Harry laughed breathily, trying to seem as casual as possible.
“Please.”
Harry snickered as the idiot threw his hands up in the air and then stomped outside.
“Christ, Potter, have you ever thought about writing poetry?”
Potter then changed his line of questioning to focus on the drinks which Draco could tell was really vexing him, even beyond the open display of magic in front of the pubgoers.
“Hmm…well there is one drink that I would recommend, and I think it would suit you.”
“Not in the way you’d think. Its…unfulfilling. I’m a celebrity to them, not an Auror.”
They crept forwards, scanning all around them for threats. He could tell Ron was doing this a bit more thoroughly than he was. The closer they got, the voices became more distinct: between four and seven, male and viciously unpleasant.
“Because…it hurts to change things. But it needs to happen, so he’d do that.”
Malfoy nodded and muttered, “S’alright,” before fetching cutlery and levitating the plates to the small, circular table in the living room.
“You are very mysterious, they were not wrong on that front. It’s your eyes I think. Green is so unusual.”
“I didn’t realise…I didn’t know that it had scarred you. That I had scarred you.” He whispered this, as if voicing it properly would make it true.
Harry laughed to himself. He still found it charming, and occasionally unnerving, at just how domestic Draco could be when entertaining.
Draco paused only slightly, before removing his wand and locking the door with a thud. People were anxious now. Pressing in around them, he could feel the heat of the crowd at his back. The brief training he had received as an Auror allowed him to keep focused on the man in front of him.
“Can’t, I’m working tomorrow.”
“No, stop. I just…” He ran his hands through his hair and it fell perfectly back into place, Harry decided not be annoyed at this. Draco’s voice fell almost to a whisper, “I want to help and I don’t want you to go but I am terrified of having to go back to Azkaban, even for a week.”
“Tell him that a wizard is living here pretending to be a muggle, has definite skill with potions, has a history of disliking muggles and most likely is up to something nefarious…I wonder who they’ll want to investigate first?!” Draco marched ahead, leaving Harry to catch up.
Yours,
Draco nodded. “I don’t mind them now. Not really. They remind me of you.”
Cameras flashed and his name was shouted as he walked out of the door. He could feel his face heating and he struggled for slow, calming breaths.
Draco laughed sarcastically. “Yes, it’s really such a shame for me. I really have turned things around now that I’ve stopped trying to murder people. Why can’t everyone be like me?”
Harry was escorted around the back, still unspotted. The Auror leading him walked briskly and he strained to keep up.
“I…I don’t know. Maybe? I mean it’s all just happened so fast. He’s different, that’s for sure. Otherwise, I couldn’t have anything to do with him. But there are some parts of him that are exactly the same. Like his sarcasm and his, well, his face, but now it doesn’t make me want to punch him it makes me want to –“
He fished his wand from between the cushions and clumsily summoned parchment and quill.
“Okay, Draco I don’t have acne.”
“Tempy – you’re leaving me to fend for myself already?”
“POTTER!”
“Yeah, come on in.”
Draco quirked his head to the side, smiling back. “Indeed.”
“What do you mean?”
Harry
Ron ushered them all into the side of the building and out the sight of potential passers-by. Harry was impressed by his easy command of the team, his confidence putting everyone at ease. Well, everyone besides Harry would not be calm until Draco was safe and in his hands where he…he wanted to say ‘where he belonged’ but he wasn’t sure that was true.
There were three of them left still here. The rest of the group currently with Draco and the rest of the town. Harry was pleased to see Ron there for his own sake but that meant that Draco was left with Smith. Ron looked up and smiled at him, his usual mop of red hair in a disarray that could almost rival Harry’s. Almost. He waved and let himself into the room.
Harry literally rubs his eyes to see if he is seeing straight. He blinks again and takes in the sight before him. Tall, blonde, smiling wickedly and beginning to make his next cocktail is Draco Fucking Malfoy.
“The investigation, Potter, do keep up.”
Harry had taken to living in a home full of life and love incredibly easy. Easy as breathing. It was soothing to listen to the crackle of the radio every morning, to hear the doorbell go as Draco’s regulars dropped in some home baking or just to say hello. It often didn’t seem real to him, that he could have this.
“I had a hunch. What did he want?”
“What the fuck, Potter?” He  felt the old spike of outrage at him for always breaking the rules and getting away with it. “Have you lost your mind? I have to live here, you know! The ministry is going to have my arse, there’s no way they’ll think their golden boy would do such a thing.” Draco blustered and raged while Harry simply rolled his eyes and continued to shrink and levitate the van  back down the path.
A blackbird sang in the distance and from the street a child’s bicycle rang its shrill bell, an accompanying laugh in the background. Voices from the front door finally reached him and he heard someone call his name. His smile was heavy with those who couldn’t share the moment with him but it was a sadness that only lingered in the corners, watching from a distance.
As Draco and Fotheringham began to talk business, Harry walked around examining the proposed merchandise. Most of the names he had never heard of, despite feeling fairly comfortable in the muggle world.
Heart hammering, he looked at Potter whose features had returned now. He looked much the same really, bar the shorter hair.
Draco laughed and looked back to Harry, who was nowhere to be seen, neither was the van which was more troubling. “What? Dorothy, how did you –“
“Great. I’ll have two.”
She curled her lip in disapproval and got to work shovelling the chips and shouting at the other kid who was cleaning the counters. Harry paid and left a small tip, ministry money be damned, and then headed out the shop to see if the woman was still kicking about.
Grabbing everything he might need, purpose renewed, he took off at a brisk walk back into town he considered his options.
Harry snorted.
A look passed over Draco’s face. Soft and warm and Harry found it difficult to keep looking at him.
There was a breath. “Only for Hogwarts.”
She huffed and began to pull drawers open in search of the envelope. “Fine. Here! Make poor choices.” She thrust her hand into the fire and snapped the letter from his hand and stuffed it the envelope.
“No! Not like that! Wait, does he really? Shit, sorry, don’t answer that.”
“Not had that one.”
Eventually Draco beckoned him over to the bar to drink his pint. Harry sat on a stool just past Draco’s head so he had to tilt his chin up to look at him. It made his face look all the more delicate and Harry studied his pint instead.
Draco was biting his lip. “This is fucked up.”
A few minutes later, the healer came back and said he could go inside.
“Ah, they really are quite magical.” He winked and Harry felt something shift uncomfortably inside him. He simply nodded as Draco said his goodbyes.
“Sorry,” Harry replied sheepishly. “Are you having any luck?”
“I don’t have a cat.”
The sound of the gathering crowd buzzed in the streets and the back of Harry’s neck pricked with sweat. At the bottom of the stairs the suspects were unceremoniously handed over to Harry and the door was open.
“Well that’s simply not true.”
“Yeah,” he said.
She marched right up to him and held him. “Oh, Harry. Are you alright? Ron told me what happened, said you’d be here. Have you heard anything?”
“I am aware of how owl post works Harry but why on earth are you sending a letter at this time of night? And drunk?!”
“What?”
“That was interesting.” Harry said clumsily as a way to open the conversation.
“Alright, Tempy: anything for you.”
“And?”
Harry’s heart hammered. “Ron, what’s going on? Can I –“
“Good start, then what?”
Kingsley sighed warily and leaned back in his chair. “It is days like this where I wish I could drink on the job.” Harry laughed at the admittance. “Anyway,” he sighed, “I’m going to have to ask you to head over to MLE and give them what you know and we will go from there. You will need to work with Robards, it is his department after all.”
“What a beautiful office,” Draco remarked, “Much like one my father had, if I’m being honest.” Draco’s tone of voice was strange and not unlike one he used as a teenager when boasting about something.
Harry’s mind was reeling. For one thing, Fotheringham was definitely a wizard and Draco clearly had him on side.
Harry assumed that Draco was aiming for sarcasm but instead came off sincere. Draco seemed to realise that Harry had spotted the difference and his small smile was genuine. It spurred on Harry’s candour. “If they ask me, and you’re alright with it, I won’t lie, Draco.”
“Shut it, Potter! Honestly, you know that it’s always four limes in the Dirty Draco.” He smirked, finding it difficult to remain serious after saying the drink he had named after himself.
No, he would fix this. He would talk to Potter. Convince him that the drinks were just fun and perfectly harmless and then he could get back to his life the way it was before. He had worked too hard to throw this away. This little treasure of a place with its weird shops and weirder inhabitants. It was home when he had been banned from his previous. It was his. He belonged here. And if it took making nice with Potter in order to stay here then that is what he would do.
Draco’s back was to him, fussing over the napkins on the table when Harry came up and hugged him from behind. He could feel Draco smile, hands still moving over the table.
When he eventually spoke up Draco almost dropped the glass in surprise.
Harry shook his head. He was numb. The chill of his fingertips had seeped inside him and was refusing to leave. “They won’t tell me anything. Keep ignoring me. I don’t think it’s a good sign.”
Draco found mixing cocktails akin to potions; precise, occasionally experimental and if done incorrectly can cause the drinker to become violently ill. Judging by the sheer amount of alcohol in some of them it often seemed as if this was the primary purpose. The skills from potions was merely practically but the names he created became a creative outlet almost. It was a silly thing he did when he started the pub. His extreme lack of muggle knowledge meant that he was truly and utterly clueless when it came to muggle culture and had thus overcompensated.
“Draco!”
“Talk to me like that again and I’ll Expelliarmus your arse from here to Hogsmede. Now fuck off.”
“Someone’s talking to muggles about Gringotts? Of all the things they could tell muggles about they chose the bloody bank?” Ron had paced around the room as Harry had checked the tent.
She hesitated and then rolled her eyes and headed for the open window to call the owl. He called thank you and then brought his head out the fireplace. The motion caused a wave of nausea and he fell backwards onto the rug. He lay there, starfished on the rough material and stared at the ceiling as it danced and twirled around the room.
“Ridiculous! Who gives that kind of object to an eleven year old?”
Potter paused for a moment and studied Draco’s face; it was unnerving. “You’re up to something and I’ll find out.”
“Draco! Draco, stop. Will you please stop, you’re legs are longer than mine.” He didn’t stop but he did drop his pace for Harry to catch up with him.
“I honestly don’t know what you’re on about, son.”
Draco flushed a brilliant red and Harry cackled.
“I don’t understand why he can’t work a phone though.”
“The fuck?” he whispers to himself before shouldering the door open and heading inside.
“Azkabana Slammer? Azkabana – that’s the name of a kind of fancy hut, is it not?”
Draco had come first, spine arching and Harry’s name on his lips; words tumbling out one after the other, a deluge beautiful sounds. Harry followed soon after and then they lay there in the quiet, listening to the other’s breaths. And then sleep came, welcoming and safe.
The smile dies on his face. His eyes flick away to the pile of paperwork on his desk which seems to grow every time he looks away. He nods and attempts to gather himself under her watchful gaze. “Am I to Apparate straight there?”
“Not to worry, Side-Along should bypass that little issue.”
He chuckled darkly and it was terribly close to the Draco he once knew, who was cold and cruel.
Fuck it. he changed direction and made his way to the closest pub.
“Course. Where do you get it from?”
“Well, you’re in the right place.”
Harry smiled, eyes crinkling and teeth showing at Draco’s clever and evasive way of wheedling information out of him. “And we’re speaking here of hypotheticals of course?”
Dragging himself to the fireplace he threw in some floo powder and waited for the green flames to lick up the side of the dark brick.
“I have a weird feeling about things in this town and it isn’t just you.”
“It is a fucking magic trick, you arsehole; you’re using magic in front of muggles!” Potter screamed and some birds took flight.
They didn’t speak for a long time after that. Draco felt the need to say something spiteful, or interpret Potter’s silence for pity and use it to his advantage but he wasn’t doing that anymore. Unlearning selfishness was something he continually worked at; he was envious of those that it came to naturally.
Kingsley sobered again. “I know, Harry. I understand. Just this last favour and you’re free.”
Draco pointedly ignored him and began to explain to Bernard that Draco’s version of a Slippery Nipple was the same as the widely known version of a Slippery Nipple but, yes, he could add a strawberry if he so desired.
Kingsley sat behind his desk and avoided Harry’s eyes. He fidgeted with papers and quills, took a sip of coffee then when Harry found himself beginning to fidget, he looked up and finally cleared his throat.
Harry went to Ron and cupped the back of his neck. “Thank you. It’s…thank you.”
“I mean…that is sort of what I’m doing, Harry. Not the potions thing but living here as a muggle.”
As he was preparing to leave, he couldn’t help but feel the underlying feeling that this was the wrong thing to do. He had tried to talk himself round, blaming it on having to go back to a place where he didn’t feel respected or with people he didn’t see eye to eye with. But he could only fool himself so far.
Draco was shifting again.
“You can’t remember where you get it from?”
By this point, Patil had jumped off his desk and paused when she reached the door. “Sorry, one last thing – you’ve to wear the Order of Merlin. It’s a big one today and they need the press distracted.”
Blinking rapidly in an attempt to take in his surroundings his eyes finally settled on the large board behind the bar that had a list of the names of the drinks and their ingredients. Somehow, Harry’s mouth opened wider. There, plain as day, was an abundance of references to the wizarding world in drink form and a list of their ingredients. Vodka and tomato juice was a Bloody Baron instead of the well-known Bloody Mary. Egg whites, gin and orange liqueur was ‘A Grey Lady’ despite the resulting colour being whiter than it ever could be grey. Everything from Circe’s Tits to Expecto Crapula was listed on the blackboard, written in an elegant script in various colours of chalk.
It was creepy in here. The roots of the trees, raised in protest, made the path almost untenable and every unknown noise had the hairs on the back of Draco’s neck standing on end.
Many were confused at Hermione’s career choice, being as brilliant as she was she could have chosen anything and most assumed that field would be politics. She had surprised them all, however, with curse breaking. Harry and Ron had not been as surprised. She was a sucker for anything to she had to puzzle out and her job held the slightest bit of danger that kept her on her toes. The insane amount of reading, research and writing also made it a no-brainer.
“Things worse than you have tried to kill me and not manged to make it stick. Forgive me if I can tolerate being around you, Draco.” Harry rolled his eyes and stared up at the ceiling.
“Alright! It was an accident. I was…distracted.”
Draco smirked, “Yes, I remember. You were a right little rule breaking prick.” He sobered quickly and then, almost under his breath, said, “It’s different for me. You get to do that. Not me.”
Draco’s mood had picked up soon enough but he didn’t mention Fotheringham again. Harry had questioned Draco throughout the day on the town and his work but there seemed to be nothing in it.
“What do we do now?” Harry asked him.
“Well, I think if Cher and Sherlock worked together they would be amazing. Secondly, you’re definitely right about the bad luck thing. Your first assignment in ages and you end up in a quaint muggle town and the only wizard for miles is me.”
“Decent my arse, Potter. I was excellent. It wasn’t my fault that you were like a niffler in a jewellery shop when it came to the snitch.”
Harry seems to forget all his previous Auror training and stumbles forward into the conversation that the two men were having.
“Oh god, Hermione. He…fuck.”
She seemed pleased to see him, a gloved hand in the air greeting him. “Harry! How are you? How’s the case?” He smiled warmly at her, relieved that at least somethings never changed. When anyone asked how Hermione was she would give them a rundown of whatever mad object she was trying to pry open and check for its secrets. Her work was so pivotal to who she was and how she was feeling. For a while it had caused resentment to build up in Harry as he had wanted to feel that way for such a long time. He had grown used to feeling valued and worthwhile and like he had something to give. From time to time, he wondered if his time with the Dursleys had made it so easy for him to slip into the role of shutting up and accepting that you’re not important. Not worth something.
They moved slowly in the beginning, gentle and soft. Harry crowded Draco against the bedroom door, the wall and eventually to the bed. His hands were anchored to Draco’s hips and his lips to his throat. It was too much and not enough all at once and Harry couldn’t remember a time when he had felt so many things simultaneously.
Harry thought he did but was stubborn enough to make Draco say it. “Not sure I do actually.”
The phone rang from the other side of the room. Draco huffed and went in search of it. He found it under an enormous stack of pillows.
“Fuck it. Let’s go out. Walk around the town and see what we can find.”
That was he found himself, half an hour, later traipsing through the dark trails of the forest looking for the daft git. His imagination had supplied him with images of Potter being attacked by werewolves, vampires, and at one point a massive tic that had sent him scrambling for his shoes and out the door to look for him.
They made their way over to the aisle where Harry stood looking at the newspapers. Harry smirked as they began bickering over the latest football results. Apparently, the referee was a ‘complete nutter’ and ‘couldn’t tell his arse from his elbow’.
“Basically.”
The night continued without any mishaps, besides Bernard being on the table again, until it wasn’t.
When the tea was made he levitated the cups and walked to the bedroom, only hesitating slightly when wondering if doing this was in fact too weird. He decided it most definitely was but would continue nonetheless.
As Draco was determinedly cleaning a glass and ignoring Bernard’s pleas for ‘no more fucking Dolly Parton’ on the jukebox ,someone approached him at the bar. Draco looked up and dropped the glass onto the bar in front of him.
“No, why would I do that?”
“I’ll have another of these please, Draco,” Bernard said.
Was he flirting? Fuck, Draco really hoped he was. There was something about this guy that was…odd and Draco couldn’t put his finger on it. It felt like he wasn’t letting Draco away with anything, as if he knew not to be fooled by his smile or his practiced sincerity.
“Third year?”
“Not at all.” Draco said blandly; Harry tried to a snort.
“Yeah. Yeah that’d be nice. Dinner. Hermione likes going for dinner.”
He began marching back to the tent to take notes on what he had heard and formulate his next move. A feeling began to burn in his stomach, one he hadn’t felt in a long time. It was the feeling he got when he was close. Close to figuring something out and getting somewhere finally. Like when his hand was outstretched for the snitch, or when he they knew what the next horcrux would be. It filled him with a power that had been lying formant dormant for so long he had forgotten it had existed, that he could indeed feel like this. Like himself.
The suspects were quickly taken from him and marched swiftly to the holding cells and he found he felt rather sorry for them. They were criminals, certainly, but it required some ingenuity to pull off what they did.
Harry paused in order to ensure his reply gave little away. “Yeah, we’ve been working closely. He knows the town well, obviously, and the people.” And because he was an idiot proceeded to add, “He’s really clever actually. I never knew that about him. And funny. But shit at making cocktails if I’m being really honest.”
Draco studied him for a moment, eyes clouded in thought as they took in every detail of his face. Nodding, he squeezed Harry’s hand that was still gripped on his and began walking again.
His skin was buzzing as if he were tanning the drinks he was supposed to be handing out. Deciding to throw caution to the fucking wind, he leant into the madness that was this situation. “How about you make one and I’ll copy?” he suggested to Draco.
Harry nodded dumbly, took out his wand. His mind tried to summon a memory, one that was happy enough for a Patronus. Nothing came to him. Happiness had never felt to acutely out of reach as it was at this second with Draco’s eyes closed and his shirt sodden with his own blood.
“And also?” Draco pressed.
“…you’re fucking lying, Malfoy. We know you have connections,” the thug spat.
Fotheringham led the way with Draco and Harry following along behind him. A wave of his hand sent the door opening and they both said their goodbyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’d like to kiss you without you crying.”
The evening sun seemed to be emptying itself into their small kitchen. Boxes were still piled high on the counters and Harry just knew he was going to have learn Hermione’s expert extension charms to fit all the stuff Draco had brought from his flat.
Draco hummed in agreement. “Weird that we’re in a room together and not so much as raised a fist?”
“No, I don’t think that’s it. Perhaps he can’t use a phone because…he’s a wizard and hasn’t ever had to?”
The street was empty. He could hear some drunk but distant voices from one of the many pubs in the town but besides that not a soul could be seen. It was strange.
He was attracted to women, absolutely, but something was…missing? Like he was trying to cook something but missing a vital ingredient: the food was edible but didn’t quite hit the spot the way you would hope. It wasn’t like he had a problem, exactly. He could be horny, he could have sex, but it just felt like it could be better. Maybe it was just him, something wrong with how he was.
“Are you going back tonight?”
Before even stepping in front of the mirror, it began to spew vitriol at him. Its ornate frame was shuddering from the intensity with which the glass was chastising him from abandoning his skincare routine last night.
That lead to them buying the cottage, Draco continuing to work in the pub and Harry considering an apprenticeship to teach at Hogwarts.
Traipsing into the kitchen the lights turned on, a dim glow casting shadows on the round kitchen table.
What the fuck was going on with him? Teasing, smiling, and calling him Draco? Not for the first time in his life, Harry wondered whether he had been poisoned or was just going round the bend.
Was he flirting? Was he really flirting with Draco Malfoy? Not only two days ago, he had thought Draco a pretentious git who was easily led, if he ever thought about him. And now? Now he was flirting with him while supposedly on the job and blushing while he made muggle cocktails. Merlin’s arse, what was he doing?
“Right then. We’re almost done here and then this lot will be out your hair.” He nodded at them both and then walked off, turning his attention to Smith instead. “Smith if you’re going to be useless all night go home.”
Harry had continued to be gentle and considerate all morning and neither of them mentioned the kiss, despite the fact that it was running on a loop in Draco’s mind.
He shook his head. “Not interested in sports.”
Unfortunately, Harry had learned the long and hard way that governments are forever falling out of favour and that he would be brought out as a puppet until retirement or until people lost interest in Harry Potter.
“I’m taking the cloak. I’ll be with you but he won’t see me.” Harry said this with finality and went to fetch it from his bag.
“I…” Harry began, “Did you say…the Bloody Baron?”
“Hello? Sorry? I can’t – why are you muffled? Turn it around. No, you’re speaking into the wrong bit.” He rolled his eyes, lip curled in impatience, appearing remarkably similar to fourteen year old Draco. “Ah, Fotheringham. What can I do for you?” Draco looked over at Harry, his mouth tight.
Grimmauld place greeted him like toothache: familiar and dreaded at the same time. It seemed to be the physical embodiment of Harry’s feelings: sad, lonely but orderly.
(See the end of the chapter for
He took on acclimatising to his new world the same way he did with everything else he was unsure of at first: he studied.
The detective offices were not far from his own. They shared a communal kitchen and some small rooms with their partners. Ron’s was the farthest away and the only one Harry had ever been in despite the length of time he had worked there. He rapped on the door and went inside.
Draco was wresting with a jumper he was trying to get over his head without messing his hair. “Hmm?”
Throwing on a fresh t-shirt and his usual jeans he quickly stepped in front of the mirror to double check he didn’t look too hungover. He did, but there was really nothing he could do about it and, with a sigh and mounting dread, stuffed his feet in his boots and left the house for the Ministry.
“Yes, but you’re a wizard.”
As he took the elevators, punching the button to Kingsley’s floor, he briefly wondered what his life would be like now that he had officially quit his job. There was a fear, definitely, but an exhilaration too. That he was finally done with it, with the humiliation, the embarrassment of it. He had let it go on far too long, hopeful that it was only temporary. And as time had passed and nothing had changed, he waited for the public’s view of the ministry or the academy to improve and do something to inspire some kind of trust in its people.
“Grab your shit, you’re coming with me.”
Harry had never been called beautiful before. Perhaps his parents had, maybe even Sirius, but somehow it was enough that Draco had said it. Harry closed his eyes briefly at the thought and then continued removing Draco’s shirt.
“Do?”
“Fine, fine, it’s your arse.”
Draco tried to gather his composure, pursuing the conversation.
“When?”
“Smith,” he called, loud enough that he could be heard over the din.
He made the split decision to run for him, shield him from the spells that were coming everywhere when a shout tore through the air.
“So, what are we doing today?” Harry said it as a way to clear the air and Draco was grateful for it.
As soon as it saw him, its face froze in shock.
“I know, I know but that’s not going to happen, I won’t let it. I promise you, Draco.”
“What was that drink Draco here gave you last night? The green one.” A man with the biggest moustache Harry had ever seen asked him.
Harry could tell that Fotheringham was going on one of his, now notorious, rants that would provide them with little to no information other than the guy was a total bastard. And that intel had already been gathered.
Harry paused, wondering if he should be honest. It couldn’t really hurt, even if he told him. Soon enough, Harry would leave and Draco would be forbidden to visit. There was nothing particularly secretive about his job, anyone with a brain could see that the Auror department only used him for clout, to ease the worries of its citizens.
As he gave the girl her drinks, she smiled ever so sweetly at him, and he gave her his best ‘darling-if-you-had-a-dick-that-smile-would-definitely-work-but-those-tits-would-be-an-obstacle-for-me’ smile and rang up her total.
The tight feeling in his chest, one he had harboured for so long it felt like a part of him, began to loosen. He smiled suddenly into the empty room and basked in the excitement of being just a bit reckless, a hint of who he used to be. And it felt good. It felt good.
From what he could tell, Draco had been there for over an hour and had been sat in Fotheringham’s office the entire time. Harry’s hands clenched at the thought of how uncomfortable Draco had been despite Harry being stood right next to him, albeit invisible never mind being on his own and with Aurors pressuring him to do it. He promised himself, whether the operation was successful or not, he would fuck Smith up. The prick had it coming to him.
Draco nodded, blond hair falling across his face and fanning out on the pillow. “So, hypothetically then, consequences be damned, all relative, sensible thoughts aside -  what would one do?”
“What? No. I’m bitter that – do you know what, never mind. I call the drinks after wizarding things for a laugh, okay? No muggle has been harmed in asking for a Minxy McGonagall. The only pain they endure is a shite hangover in the morning from drinking Bacardi – that’s it. Now, I am actually on shift and seeing as you are not officially arresting me, I am going back to work, and you can fuck off to wherever you came from.”
“Robards, that’s enough. Take the vials and have them analysed. We are professionals.” Kingsley’s voice was firm and unmoving. Robards paused as if he were going to disobey but then nodded stiffly and stood, leaving the room with a thudding of the door.
“I am not predictable, Hermione. I am, in fact, very mysterious.” He smirked at her; in for a penny, in for a pound. “Draco said so.” This only caused her to laugh louder.
“Yeah…” Harry frowned at the scene before them. One half of the team appeared to be normal and the other half were incredibly lucky at every turn. Lucky...
“I’m afraid it’s not going to be as simple as that, Harry. I would like you to submit your statement to and have a chat with some of our detectives on what you’ve found.”
This train of thought always left him quite uncomfortable so of course his brain reminded him of it regularly. It had been a long time since he had sex with someone. The last time being a random muggle woman in a pub that was over very quickly leaving both parties rather unsatisfied but in entirely different ways.
When he finally caught up to Draco, he was panting and trying not to look at him.
A couple of hours in, the redhaired woman behind the bar the previous night, whom he later found out was the owner of the pub, came in and traipsed up to the bar to talk to Draco. She had looked Harry up and down and then looked to Draco, eyebrow raised. Draco had flushed brilliantly and muttered something under his breath. The woman had cackled loudly, head thrown back and thumping her hand on the bar.
Harry threw himself to the ground on instinct. A second passed, maybe two and he was sure it had missed him.
When they had walked for a few minutes in silence Harry was close to bursting with questions. Intrigue. Something. Draco’s demeanour had changed dramatically. He was sullen and holding himself tightly as they made their way back to the pub.
The rest of his day was spent walking down the country paths and remarking on the weather to some of the locals. They were cautious at first, they didn’t know him, and he clearly wasn’t from around here. But eventually they eased into the conversation and began recommending various cafes to visit and tourist points to see.
Tea was drank in relative silence and Harry found it was as easy as breathing. To just…be. To not have to stress about work or commitments, even lack of commitments and instead simply exist in the same space with a person. Even if that person was Draco Malfoy.
The pub that night was the busiest Harry had ever seen it. People were jostling each other at the bar, two fights broke out in which he had heard the filthiest things come out of Draco’s mouth in his clean, crisp accent. Overall, it was a shitshow.
“Stupefy!” They yelled and moved simultaneously, smooth and in control. He felt blinkered; all other thoughts and feeling and distractions non-existent besides getting to Draco and putting his foot on the throat of the bastard that touched him.
The gravel crunched under his feet as he cleared the last part of the path and walked up the aptly named ‘Main Road’ into the heart of the town. He found its name amusing as it was pretty much the only road here, not just the main one. It was the most direct route from the small cottages littering the coastline to the busiest part of the village with the community halls and the shops and pubs, but it was comical how tiny the place was.
Harry got the feeling it hadn’t been dreams Draco had seen, but memories. Things that had haunted him enough to wake him in the middle of the night with the overwhelming need to flee from his own skin. His mind pushed an image of Draco waking in the night with no-one to talk him down. Just the silence of the empty room to tell him it was all over. Harry pushed the thought away.
Draco’s head began to shake of its own volition, and he began to backup into the shelves behind him, but Potter was quicker. A hand had grabbed the front of his shirt and was dragging him out from behind the bar and to the nearest exit. Thankfully Tempy was on shift tonight and could take over, even if she were shit at making the cocktails.
“It’s not right.”
“This is ridiculous,” Robards spat. He turned to Kingsley, his hand still on the vials. “Potter here, seems to think that Malfoy, a Death Eater, is working for the Aurors! He is doing anything to save his skin no doubt. That’s what he’s doing, they’ve not changed you know.”
“Yeah, bit knackered now.” He said, attempting to smile in a nonthreatening way to this tiny woman.
Draco’s face morphed slightly into a more characteristically looking Draco. “No, it’s – they said it’s excellent. For acne.”
“Ah,” Said Draco, smirking properly now, “Am I about to get a glimpse of the magic that is Harry Potter detecting?”
As soon as he was outside, he sucked in a breath of fresh air.
“I never apologised to you, Potter. You know for…everything.” Words were directed to the ceiling as he held his pint between hands on his chest. “I didn’t realise how much it would spiral out of control. How I would spiral out of control. And how much everyone would pay for it.” He sat up, legs dangling over the bar. “I haven’t apologised to anyone else because –“ He gestured to the room around him. “- banishment. Not really something one can just put in a letter.”
Harry just stood there, wanting desperately to know anything, but only if it was good news. Otherwise, he would take the waiting. Would endure the interminable waiting and the white walls of the hospital to hold on to the possibility that all was going to be okay.
When he was cutting it close for time, he grabbed his rucksack and made his way to the door. Draco appeared from the room immediately. Thin shoulders hunched forwards and arms wrapped around himself. He smiled weakly at Harry and it very nearly broke his resolve.
A cool breeze wafted over his face. It was soothing. Mind still foggy from sleep, he pictured a small hill he was climbing, the freshness of the morning calling out to him.
Now that he was over the shock of it, he watched Draco with an intensity with which he had once watched quidditch. The way he used to watch Malfoy play quidditch. The way he moved was much the same really. Understated, lithe, purposeful, and performative. It was easy for him. Where Harry had always been brash and bold, here Malfoy…Draco was elegant, even graceful.
Harry briefly wondered if it was act. If it were, then Malfoy had had to have been to drama school since the last time Harry had met him. Something inside him, an instinct that he had neglected for so long, told him that this was genuine.
By the time the sun was going down he ventured to the fish and chip shop and stood in the queue, his legs aching from practically scaling a mountain several times that day. The woman in front of him took one look at him and chuckled.
“I brought my own accommodation, Malfoy, don’t worry.”
This did nothing to dampen Draco’s mood for making cocktails however. As had happened the night before, someone ordered Dolly Parton on the jukebox and Draco became alive as if powered solely by country music.
Draco snorted. “Dosed with what, liquid luck?” His eyes widened. “Harry, they’ve been dosed with liquid luck.”
“Calm down,” he said, rolling his eyes. “I’ve no intentions of stealing you.”
Patil spoke to the stag, her hands continuing to work over Draco’s chest, his neck. The stag looked to Harry and he nodded.
Draco replied, with fake sincerity.
“Potter?” Smith replied, turning his cruel smile upon Harry now.
Harry expected Draco to smile and gush as he did with the women earlier but instead he wore a polite smile that didn’t reach his eyes.
“Just move the van and I’ll sort it’s owner.”
She nodded primly and then promptly ignored him.
Draco quipped,
Harry began his slow walk back to the tent, deflated at having found hints to something but not anything concrete. He walked past the newsagents stand and saw the headlines for the local sports team decimating the town’s rival club. The locals seemed pleased. Flags and handmade signs could be seen in some of the windows on his various hikes across the town’s many hills that day.
Two elderly gentlemen toddled in, donning thick coats and tartan scarves. One had a cigarette behind his ear.
She threw the rag that was stowed in her back pocket at his face. He caught it without thinking. “Hm. Nice catch. Sports heavy not science heavy at that school, eh?”
“Sir.” Harry nodded to Kingsley and with the briefest of glances at the other man, “Robards.” Robards clenched his fist, keenly aware of Harry’s subtle disrespect in front of his boss.
Harry sighed. “I don’t think that’s up to you, you know. I think that, if people don’t want to forgive you, then that’s their right. But if they want to, then they should.”
When they left the shop, Draco was speaking quickly. “…just knew it. Her skin was flawless, no scars or anything and I could just tell there was something about it. And as soon as I smelled it I was literally thrown back to using everyday as a teenager.”
Two hours later found Harry with the tent packed and shrunken in his pocket and receiving a bizarre tour of the village. Malfoy was talking animatedly. Gesturing wildly at the various shops and crazy things he had experienced while living here. People stopped him on the street. Greeted him like an old friend.
“S’alright. What time is it?”
“Because I shared a bed with Malfoy.” It was his turn to go red.
Draco smiled tentatively, “It’s alright.”
Harry did as he was bid, anger bubbling just below the surface demanding to be released. He manoeuvred the two men with him and they complied, stunned by this show they were also being forced to perform in.
As he prepared to Apparate, he couldn’t help but feel he was missing a part of himself. Something, until now, he hadn’t been aware he had owned. And as the darkness swallowed him, a small tug at his heart beckoned to keep him here. To keep him home.
He began to walk towards his bedroom when Potter put a hand on his elbow.
He did not want to be that person again; he refused to.
“Hello, Dorothy. How are you? You look well.” He smiled graciously at her and she beamed.
“Mmm, I am trying,” Harry said to the side of Draco’s neck.
“And, your friend, he hasn’t done this before because…?”
“Now.”
Draco was pulling a t-shirt over his head. His hair was mussed and curled slightly from the humid temperature of the pub. Harry saw the slightest glimpse of a hip and almost poured the tea all over himself.
The mirror gushed. “Oh, how marvellous! Was he decent? He practises himself often enough!”
As soon as the door was closed behind them, Draco jumped in the air and pumped his fist. “YES! We did it – that slimy bastard! I bloody told you he was dodgy. Did I do alright? Say the right things and everything?” He looked so very dear to Harry just then, all smiles and bright eyed.
“Okay,” he said because he didn’t have any other words left within him that he could afford to leave.
To put off writing his overdue letter to Pansy, he instead wrote his letter to his supplier. In the same drawer that held his parchment also held his envelopes, stamps, and paper. It had taken him some time to get used to muggle quills and was never satisfied with his penmanship. It looked so…ordinary. The stubby little thing was silent as it moved across the bright white paper and lacked all the levity he was used to with parchment and quill. Writing the letter quickly, he listed the copious amounts of alcohol he required for the next week or so and then stuffed it into the envelope unceremoniously.
Almost everyone in the room stopped and stared at him. He wasn’t sure if it was because he was Harry Potter or from speaking out during an investigation in which everyone expected him to be silent.
Harry blinked. “…Okay. Thanks for clearing that up, I guess.”
“Alcohol? You’re talking about…alcohol.”
“Draco…you don’t think –“
He could feel his face heating and his palms began to sweat.
“Henry, tell me what’s going on.” He demanded.
“Bernard, what’s your favourite drink here?” Draco asked with a smile he reserved only for the stupid.
“Dunno, never thought about it much I guess.”
Harry panicked, grappling with the receiver with the barest attempt at a whisper. “Draco say no. Too dangerous. Arrange a time and date.”
“Hermione!” He gasped, equally horrified and delighted.
As soon as he woke in the mornings he would jump up and leave the tent as soon as he could, relief flooding him when he got outside and knew he was not in the Forest of Dean or some other godforsaken place on the run from Voldemort. It was as if the tent had soaked up his fears from that year and was only now gradually releasing them, the memories lapping at his feet as he paced around the small space.
“What the fuck are you doing here, Malfoy?”
“Ridiculous,” he muttered under his breath.
Draco seemed relieved that Harry had finally cottoned on and passed him the small vial. He pulled the stopper and looked inside. It certainly looked like a regular cream but when Harry leaned forward to sniff it the scent of Dittany came soaring out of the small jar. He froze and lifted his eyes to Draco.
“Oh, stop being such a prude! You have both been obsessed with each other for literal years, which was incredibly unhealthy given that you stalked him on a magical map and he was a blood supremacist.” He flinched at this. “But…perhaps both of your pasts help you to understand each other. I know it’s why you’ve struggled to be yourself in any relationship, Harry. You are terrified that people are only with you because of your name and they don’t truly know you. And, with Malfoy, well, he’s never been shy about telling you what he thinks of you. Perhaps what that’s the attraction for you.”
“You mean to check whether I’m slaughtering drunk muggles as a past time when I’m not deliberately breaking the Statute of Secrecy,” Draco asked.
Thankfully, he wasn’t there long and seemed to be wrangling the older woman into a business deal. He flounced to the door and held it open for a couple of teenage girls who giggled while coming inside. They exchanged silent, unreadable glances with each other and Harry wondered how he had ever held a conversation with a woman in his life,  they seemed to be capable of far more complex thoughts than he was.
Draco had never taken a sick or holiday day since and both Tempy and her ill fortuned nephew were thankful for it.
She marched away from him and took off down the small curving path, two Border Collies close behind.
The side of Ron’s mouth turned up slightly, whether it was disbelief or amusement Harry wasn’t sure. “Are you alright with Harry taking your statement?”
“But you aren’t going to arrest me?”
Draco rolled his eyes and fixed the set of his shoulders before marching on declaring that he had to see one of this suppliers and that Harry’s tour could wait.
He sucked in a breath and allowed himself to succumb to the familiar plunging and sucking sensation until he was finally transported to his destination.
Harry made his way towards the two burly men he was supposed to singlehandedly haul out of this house.
Pansy had sent a pleasant note reminding him to respond:
So he attempted to order his thoughts in a way that would make sense. At any given time, Harry had a list of things that caused him to lose sleep and a longer list of the ways in which he had failed to fix anything.
“Confused partially. Relieved mostly. I think it possibly explains some things.”
“…yes, I suppose I could. Can it not – ah, I see. Shall we meet, say, four o’clock?” Draco frowned suddenly. “I – I guess, yes that’s fine. I can come alone. Thank you, goodbye.”
This brought him up short. Potter straightened and looked at Draco imperiously. “Why, what have you done to merit going to Azkaban? Again.”
Kingsley smiled knowingly at him. “Harry, please sit. Apologies for my not meeting you on time.
“I need to go, Ron. I don’t care whether I’m on or off the case, I’m going there.”
Draco felt a little better now that they were both embarrassed.
Harry gazed over the heads of the journalists and fixed his eyes upon the roofs of the picturesque villages. Thatched roofs under painted clouds and rolling valleys spread out around them. Some owls were swooping down to rest on the chimneys and Harry had to look away.
Draco’s stomach took a dive, and his mind immediately went to listing the emergency exits. “Shit. Shit, shit, shit.”
Harry laughed. “You’re really good at it!”
He attempted to tune in to the direction Ron was giving.
“No, I’m not.” Draco stopped dead and turned around to face Harry straight on. “But I know when a powerful man wants something from me and is simply biding their time until I am not in a position to say no. I’ve had rather a lot of experience in that department, wouldn’t you say?”
Currently, they were mixing drinks for the housewarming they were finally having.
It took about an hour of anxious pacing for the tracking spell to come through and give them a rough location. It was hazier than it would have been normally but it at least put them in the correct vicinity.
Potter had dragged him to the alley at the back of the building next to the bins. It was dully lit, and the streetlamps, thought few, cast an ominous glow around them.
He decided to chance his luck and speak to Draco through is ear piece. Gingerly, he picked up the bottom of the device and held it close to his mouth, palms sweating. “Draco, it’s Harry.”
“It’s not that bad,” he said hotly.
“Okay fine…he says to me – ‘darling if you haven’t had this you haven’t lived.’ And then he hands me this ridiculous looking thing and he calls it-“ The man breaks off in a fit off giggles. “He calls it a Naughty Niffler! Can you believe it?” He cackles wildly and his friend slaps him on the back with a grin.
Potter turned his attention back on Draco. “So, you’re saying all of this is harmless? No muggles are being hurt in your culinary adventures? And, just out of curiosity, don’t they think your taste in drink names are alarming if not downright bonkers?”
“Even better.” He stood up, his usual smiled present again.
Fotheringham grinned lasciviously; it made Harry’s skin crawl. “Well, dear Draco, if your little Pureblood bow didn’t give it away then smelling cured Firewhiskey certainly ought to.”
Harry gripped the shoulder of one of the detectives, Henry he thought his name was. He was older than the rest and a bit of a fossil in the department, judging by the confusion written on his face at the paraphernalia spread out on Draco’s small coffee table.
“I’m going to head then.” He slapped his thighs and stood up, heading for the door. “Let me know if you change your mind.”
“Drinks, yeah. You alright, mate?”
Draco stopped dead, mouth agape. “What? You think that Fotheringham is a wizard? Are you mad?”
“Yes. Of course.”
“Come on, Harry he isn’t completely defenceless,” interrupted Henry, the great idiot that he is. “You’re acting like he’s some damsel in distress. He’s got grit, he’ll be fine and dandy.”
“Someone nearly died, Harry!” His hands covered his face, his breaths sounded wet and shaky.
Harry was surprised at how soothed he felt by being in this room, by being next to Draco. The smell of his shampoo washing over him, the slight buzz from his fridge in the kitchen and the small lamp on the beside that flickered now and again. Harry’s fingers rubbed over the worn cover that topped the bed, faded from age and use.
“I don’t care, I’ve been slighted.”
“Well, Draco it was a pleasure as always. You really are my favourite business partner.”
“Bit weird but that’s cocktails, isn’t it?”
It was Fotheringham, obnoxious as usual, who came striding in and demanding all attention on him. Harry did roll his eyes now, a much more worthy cause, as the man threw his arms wide and greeted the shop owner. He reminded Harry of a peacock, sauntering around the room slowly, as if to give everyone the chance to admire him fully. Feathers on full display and dark eyes that didn’t give much away, he was a peculiar picture altogether.
“As promised,” Draco said and did a strange little bow, his hand pressed to his chest. Fotheringham smiled widely and beckoned him inside.
“Perhaps you used up your quota of doing great things already and now you get to do what you want. Number three?”
He used the opportunity of being alone to look around the room. It was organised but not overly tidy. Much of the furniture looked worse for wear, perhaps from being transfigured into something else far too many times. The room itself was warm with soft sunlight filtering through the windows, creating a kind of haze on its surroundings. An assortment of belongings lined the window ledge and a crowded a desk in the corner.
Harry couldn’t quite believe how peaceful he had looked just a few moments ago and now he was like a cauldron overspilling, fumes and all.
“Don’t get distracted now, everyone will be arriving soon.” His voice was light, as free as Harry had ever heard it.
He was a strange creature, Harry thought then. Something about him that was both masculine and feminine and downright intoxicating.
“I wasn’t trying to upset you.”
“Weird like what? If I’m being honest, you’re the weirdest thing I’ve spoken to in a while, now away you go!”
“Like what?”
As instructed, he made a show of checking the bonds and began to read the two men their rights. The press were pushing in closer and it took everything in him to not flee from the place.
The suspects themselves seemed to be a caricature of your stereotypical criminal, as if they had recently read a book on ‘How to Look Like a Criminal for Dummies.’ Small tattoos littered their hands and faces and scars from old curses or duels donned their muscular arms. They must have had about five teeth between them, Harry surmised. They were both looking at him with an equal mixture of dislike and awe. This was common, Harry had found, criminals were never happy to be arrested but they at least got the story that Harry Potter had read them their rights and locked them up.
Slowly, Harry moved forward, coming in between his pale legs. Calloused fingertips pressed themselves to Draco’s cheeks, caressed the tip of his nose and under his eyes.
Harry laughed suddenly. “Kingsley, that’s quite normal. Muggles do – “
Their conversation moved on to other things until Kingsley’s Patronus interrupted and requested his presence, he hugged her tightly as he left.
“’Mione, please. Envelope, owl and I’ll leave you alone.”
Harry could imagine his sly smirk, leering over Draco. His grip on the receiver tightened.
It felt rehearsed to him as his descriptions left his mouth. Only half of his mind was present, the rest being with Draco. When Ron declared the inquisition over everyone began to head back to their offices.
The mirror thought for a beat. “I do not need to answer your questions. Why do you look so tired?”
The woman was heavyset, with round eyes that gave her a very owllike expression, but Harry reasoned she had a kind smile.
“He’s had a time of it, that’s for sure. But, yes, he’ll live. He lost a lot of blood, and it was close, closer than I would have liked. The healers are still attending to him, then you can see him.” She pressed her lips together tightly and raised the corners. It took a second for Harry to realise it was a smile.
“Onto business then. Robards is going to take the memories you’ve brought and submit them into evidence. We’ll have one of the detectives look into it in the ministry pensieve.”
Draco nodded, seeming to think over this information. “You know, you certainly have been holding out on me, this really is the best conversation I have had in a while.”
It was rather a lot of booze, even for Draco. Besides the boxes that were littering the counters, large bottles of unknown quantities of alcohol dotted about between the transfigured glasses.
“…Justice? I don’t know. Anyway, the details of my parole were…are…constrictive.” He felt Potter tense next to him and he hastened to add, “Not unjust, Potter, don’t misunderstand me. I did terrible things and I must pay a price for that. It’s just…the restrictions…let’s just say if I were not in the frame of mind to try and change it would not encourage me to do so.”
The winter sun was beating down on them and Harry insisted on ice-creams which Draco indulged. Walking past the rugby club, they stopped to watch them practice for a while.
She was holding back a smile. “Quite good looking too, I presume?”
When Harry looked closer, he could see Malfoy leaning into every friendly touch and gesture the women offered. Perhaps it was loneliness. Harry could understand. The pull of wanting to just reach out and touch someone, to have them touch you.
“Ron…I – it’ll be better if I don’t go. You know that. You should celebrate. We’ll maybe do something soon - you, me, and Hermione. Dinner or something.”
“Hermione Granger.” He said as he thrust his head into the fireplace, as clearly and as soberly as he could possibly manage given his current state. He briefly wondered how it worked with alcohol on his breath and talking into a fire but decided that there were occasions for pondering muggle science but being half cut and quitting your job was not one of them.
“Draco…?” He asked slowly.
Draco
He wondered how Draco had done this on his own for so long; he was exhausted. Sweat trickled down his back and above his brow. The heat, the noise and overall chaos made him slightly frantic as he poured drinks and asked people to repeat their orders for the third time.
Harry had barely listened and instead had darted around the room packing the tent with a frantic energy that made Hermione frown.
“Yes, well it’s been a while you see. I don’t sell anything as half as good as this to those muggles. They’d hardly appreciate it.”
“Yeah but you’re not an Auror.”
A fish and chips shop were the town’s pride and joy as it apparently had the best fish and chips for twenty miles. Harry couldn’t even imagine another village being close to here, it felt so cut off from everything and everywhere.
The conversation had been fairly innocuous to begin with. Discussing previous business interactions, the town, its residents, and their shared boredom of the place. However it had moved quickly from there; discussions of potions being smuggled into muggle shops, their owners being obliviated and how amusing it all was. Harry’s heart sank when he realised how good this was for the investigation, with him practically confessing, but how poor it looked for Draco. The quips about muggles and their uses seemed to be quick off the mark for him and Harry felt a twist in his stomach.
“Oh. Oh, right. I kinda thought that you had known for a while –“
“Well, what are you going to do?”
“No.” He could sense a trap and wouldn’t fall of it again. “No, I told you I want out. I’m not doing photo opportunities or – “
“Listen to me,” Harry said softly and waited until Draco looked at him. “Everything is going to be okay. This shit has nothing to do with you, they aren’t going to find anything on you, I will make sure of it. I’ll be back in a few hours and then we’ll be working together again to lock up this wanker. Okay?” Draco nodded weakly from between his palms. “And when I get back…we can have a conversation about…things. Things we want.” Harry couldn’t seem to stop talking and found words making their way out of his mouth that he wasn’t sure his brain had approved. “I want you to be safe. Stay the fuck away from any trouble that might happen when the Aurors get here. And Smith is an arsehole, they’ll probably send him. Stay clear of him. If Ron is there, trust him. I’ll be back soon.”
“Shit.” Harry kicked at a stone and surveyed where he stood. Sheep were milling around the hill he was on, and fields went on for miles until they hit the mountain that cut into the cloudless sky. “Shit, shit, shit.”
“No – I’ll continue this. Best you do it.” Draco didn’t wait for Harry and immediately began to mimic what Harry was doing, slowly opening the man’s lungs, and pushing air in for him.
“Firstly,” he began in a lecturing tone, “we get some Absinthe.” He smirks at Harry, “Because it’s fucking deadly. Next, we add a little tequila – you can never go wrong with tequila –“ Harry belly laughs at that. “And…” He long pours the tequila into the glass after the absinthe. “…some syrup, because to the right person it has the potential to be a little sweet.” Draco cleared his throat but his smile remained. “Some vodka for the madness. And some green syrup…” He winked a little and poured in what looked to be some kind of handmade looking syrup. As he poured it the man awaiting the drink clapped. The liquid had went from see-through, swirling quickly until it stopped suddenly, still and was a vibrant -  “Green. Green eyes.” Draco looked away from him and bowed slightly to the man who was still clapping. “And that, gentlemen, is the Harry Potter special.”
“No, all of my guest bedrooms are full but you’re welcome to the floor if you’d rather.”
“Knock yourself out,” he replied blandly. “Feel free to take that literally.” Potter smirked at this, and Draco’s stomach flipped. “I’d recommend staying at the B&B at the bottom of the road, it’s the nicest and the breakfast is excellent. So, I’ve heard.”
Extinguishing the light, he clambered onto the bed trying very hard to not touch Potter lest he be on the receiving end of a fist.
With that, he turned on his heel and stomped toward the door that led back inside. He could hear the cogs in Potter’s brain turning slowly from a clear lack of use and then blundering after him like the catastrophic asteroid that he was.
Malfoy was pointy and sneering and a right git. But this man? Face soft and dreamlike from bright sun throwing its warmth from the large window. Fair eyelashes cast shadows on his cheekbones that didn’t look quite as sharp in this light just…delicate. His nose was still pointy but in a way that added a childlike look to him. Thin lips pressed together in a pout which was the closest feature this person had to Malfoy.
Harry
Fotheringham, as if only remembering that Harry was present, flashed a row of pearly white teeth at him. The guy felt about as friendly as a Great White.
“I do hope so, Draco. Alas, I have kept you too long, you have a celebrity to entertain after all.”
Thanks again for reading! If you feel like leaving a comment/kudos that would simply make my day!
Capricious as ever, the weather changed suddenly, and a large raindrop fell on his forehead and ran down his face.
Draco fiddled with his hands and nodded slowly. It was such a contrast from the boy he had known. The boy who had always exuded confidence and superiority. His face was tentative as he caught Harry’s gaze. “I’m alright with it.”
He hadn’t tried dating any men. He didn’t even know anyone else who was like him so even attempting that was a daunting enough prospect to put him off.
Meanwhile, Malfoy blushed and stuttered at the attention. Large grey eyes looking at the women earnestly as they spoke away to him. Harry found his attention drifting from the conversation, which he wasn’t really included in anyway, to simply watching Malfoy. How he bit the inside of his lip, eyelashes fluttering and his eyes looked down when anything sincere was said to him.
Of all the strange things he had encountered since finding out about the magical world, engaging with objects that shouldn’t talk was the most annoying.
“This is weird, right? That I’m standing in your kitchen? That you’re cooking…something and I’m making tea.”
“Right…and they know about this? The players?”
He nodded at Ron and walked over, trying his best not elbow anyone in his pursuit as he didn’t fancy a rough shove in return. Robards had already left the room and was climbing the rickety staircase before Harry had reached him.
“Really taking the piss now…” But he was smiling, as if there was no other response to have to Draco’s mild teasing.
Draco’s breath was hitched in his ear as Harry removed his clothes, peeling off every layer with a hunger and curiosity. Harry sighed as he felt Draco underneath him, this sea of skin that met his.
“And his arse apparently,” Draco muttered under his breath. “He’s…a friend. Just visiting for a while.”
“Hiya, Draco,” he said cheerily.
He nodded again and she left, the door clicking shut behind her.
“Draco! Aha!” His smile was too wide, as if painted on for effect. A suit decorated entirely in a paisley pattern, which felt a bit like an optical illusion to Harry, was tailored to his long body.
Harry woke to the feeling of a weight across his chest and thigh.
Draco’s head shot up. “Sorry?”
“So….has he done something that has made you not trust him?”
Harry sensed that the thug’s grasp on his temper was finally the brink. He motioned to Ron, now crouched at the other end of the container, that he was jumping in now. Ron nodded and indicated that he would take the loose ends and Harry was to go for the main threat and get to Draco.
Suddenly, Draco was at his side, ashen white even under the lights of the pub. “Harry…Harry, he’s been poisoned. That’s a reaction to a potion. The smell its – I recognise it…Harry he’s –“
Everyone cheered and looked at the bar in anticipation. Entertainment perhaps? It was difficult to see over the heads of the other patrons, but Harry gets a glimpse of blonde hair, not Dolly’s, before the pub erupts in unadulterated glee.
Draco’s body seemed to move without his permission. He scrambled back from Harry’s touch, breaths hitched and coming quickly.
“So, Harry – will you be taking the town up on all it has to offer?”
The bell of the shop door tinkled and the door was thrown open and voice, like nails down a blackboard, boomed its greeting.
“Potter – in here.”
“Understandable.”
Thank you so much for reading everyone! I'd love any comments and kudos you feel like giving.
“You don’t need to worry about that,” Draco said hotly, “I’ll get the crates inside.”
Kingsley sighed and his remaining formalities dissolved almost instantly. “Harry – I know you are frustrated, I would be too, but you must understand that sometimes we just have to play things a certain way.”
The library was helpful with its various books on the artistry of mixing drinks, but he didn’t understand the references of their names, so he made his own; spending hours reading books on cocktails and eventually making his on concoctions. His main source material turned out to be a film aptly named ‘Cocktail’ with a famous muggle actor called Tom Cruise. Muggle Tom spent the entire film making impressive drinks and showing off by throwing the bottles and glasses in the air.
When Draco made a small noise in the back of his throat, hands snaking at Harry’s sides, he pulled back and headed for the door. He didn’t look back as he swung the bag on his back and closed the door firmly behind him. He wished he could just lock Draco in behind him. The remaining working part of his brain, the part that wasn’t continually chanting ‘Draco, Draco, Draco’ at him, knew that the Aurors would need to speak to Draco. He would have to brief them on what he knew about Fotheringham and the town but it still filled Harry with dread.
She busied herself behind the counter and Harry had a closer glance at some of the products on the shelves but nothing else particularly jumped out at him as being suspicious.
“Fuck off!”
“Well,” Kingsley was saying, “You have certainly done well here, Harry.”
As Malfoy finally pulled himself away from the women, he was blushing and looked as young as he had been at school.
Throwing himself onto the chaise lounge, the fire burst to life – the house’s way of apologising for its poor behaviour. He huffed in response.
Harry’s blood ran cold as he heard a rustling in the receiver, the device being removed from Draco’s ear.
As the elevator dinged and slammed open, he considered taking up gardening to keep him busy now that he would be soon having a lot of free time. He gingerly stepped out and began to walk the metaphorical plank to Kingsley’s office. Marion, his assistant, gave Harry a toothy smile and motioned for him to sit in a small chair. The chair was exceedingly small and had perhaps originally been something else and was transfigured. It made him feel like an oversized child outside the headmaster’s office. He thought that description wasn’t too far off the real thing.
Forcing his brain to wake up, he clumsily relieved the owl of her letter and then she made for the window.
Harry
Harry laughed wetly, “Hi.”
Draco’s eyes had drifted down to Harry’s lips. “Harry, I…”
“Shit, shit, shit.” Harry fumbled in his attempt to open the letter and right about this moment would take an Avada to the head if it meant he could skip this next part of his life.
“You know, after almost dying several times as a child,” he could feel rather see Draco’s flinch at this, “I’ve decided that I get to have what I want. Being with you the last few days has made me realise that I don’t just go ‘fuck it’ and do the thing I want to do anymore. I used to be like that. Just did what I thought I should, rules be damned.”
“Hey, shh – he’s alright. The guy is fine, he’ll just think he drank too much –“
“Do I look like I work for the police?”
“Yes, not sure why honestly.” When he saw the look on Harry’s face he added, “Oh, don’t look like that. Perhaps he just doesn’t like you, Potter.” He winked mischievously.
Draco approached the bar and noticed that it was mostly the regulars that were left, and some didn’t look half as drunk as they should for the time of night, so Draco resolved to get back to work.
The room around Harry was deathly silent, he could hear his heart thud in his ears. He didn’t dare glance at anyone.
“Hermione send it. And stop worrying.”
With a giggle, the blond turned around and snaked his arms round Harry’s neck. His eyes were light grey from the sun, cheeks pinked from running about all day or from proximity to Harry. Harry liked to think it was the latter.
Draco just looked at him from the corner of his eyes but continued walking.
Patil was continuing to look at him. “Are you alright, Harry? You’ve gone a bit pale.”
The thought of this however made Harry shift uncomfortably which seemed to stir Malfoy. Eyebrows drew together at being disturbed and he huffed in annoyance. And then he was awake and looking right at Harry, who must have looked terrified, because Malfoy all but jumped to the other side of the bed.
Kingsley was not alone in his office. Robards was also there and threw a dirty look at Harry as soon as he stepped into the room, lip curled nastily on his face.
There was spluttering down the end of the receiver, he could hear Fotheringham asking Draco if he was alright.
To him, it was humiliation of the highest kind. He wanted to help, to do something, to be…needed. And instead he was desked the majority of the time and only brought out to arrest suspects when the press were there and claim victory for once again triumphing over evil. He wished he were numb to it as the situation didn't seem as if it were going to change anytime soon. For now, however, it was something to be endured.
Harry made sure to stay under the cloak as they made their way back to the apartment. He could tell Draco was trying to keep himself restrained but the excitement was evident in his face.
What Harry sees next is an image he will never forget, even if he were obliviated, which would not be entirely unwelcome at this point. For at the bar, is a man with a devilish smile wiping a blonde curl out of his eyes and singing along to this ridiculous song. In his hands a plump cocktail shaker that he is rocking back and forth with his hips swaying in a way that is just damn indecent. He encourages the audience to sing along while he throws bottles of liquor up in the air and catches it behind his back. He clicks his fingers and lights a sparkler, the fucker is using wandless magic in front of muggles, and as the crowd screams, he places the sparkler in a tall glass and pours out the mixture from the shaker.
He was confused. His brain was trying to reconcile the fact that this was Malfoy. And Malfoy was beautiful.
Harry had remembered this bleak section of training. If the person you were looking for appeared to too far gone to save then catch the bad guys and try not to contaminate the scene as much as was possible. But he knew that Ron would not ask this of him and even if he did Harry would not grant it.
“Hello, Scott. This is my friend Harry – massive fan of rugby this one.”
“An alarming amount of knowledge about perms, too…”
It was like he was wearing a bright crimson bib. He never thought blood could move so fast, could be everywhere all at once. How could a person have this much blood, surely it wasn’t possible.
Long hair scraped back on his head and face framed by a dark beard the man held Draco’s gaze, eyes green and intense and fucking majestical.
About two hours in, Draco called him over, hands filled with glasses.
“What are you wanting?” She asked.
“What? Harry!” Harry could hear Draco jogging to catch up.
As soon as he finished he was moving again and directed the men toward the portkey. Robards was waiting there, a look of mild satisfaction flooding his face. He had done well today. His Aurors had performed well, the press were pleased and his performing monkey had obeyed every instruction. It made Harry hate him. It was his fault Harry was in this ridiculous situation. It didn’t matter how much Harry had protested, tried to become more involved, threatened even, Robards was unmoving. He saw a chance to improve the reputation of his department and he took it.
“Harry? You’re okay, but I need you to come back to me. I need you to help me, you can do it. Breathe, Harry.”
Harry was eventually ushered behind the bar and ordered to just pass things to Draco when he needed them.
