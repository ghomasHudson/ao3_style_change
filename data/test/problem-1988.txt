Now, the main question was where. The Wizarding world was still yet to fully accept gay wizards and witches so drinking in the Muggle world was the only option. That did mean no Firewhiskey though so maybe he might be alright for work tomorrow. At this point in time, Harry didn’t care where he drank, as long as there was some strong whiskey and a chair or high stool at the bar where he could drown his worries away.
However, it seemed like he would have to be on that floor sooner or later because Malfoy had spotted him staring at him during his dancing. It was like last time, except Malfoy didn’t have a partner. Harry tensed up as Malfoy, still smiling from the dancing, walked towards him.
“Well, I’ve already completed quite a lot of the paperwork without you.” Seamus stared at Harry as he reached into his bottom drawer of his desk. He withdrew a large, grey bottle.
“I think it’s best if we sit down for this Ginny. It’s not going to be easy.” Harry admitted, already starting to tear up. He headed to the sofa and sat down. Ginny got the message and sat down beside him. They both stared out into the fireplace, the flames illuminating each other’s faces. Harry took a deep breath before starting.
“Harry, we would never be disgusted by you. You are still you. Just because it isn’t really accepted in the Wizarding world doesn’t mean that it never will be.” Hermione laid her hand on Harry’s knee.
The atrium was still as busy as ever. Harry still got hushed whispers and the occasional glance and drool over but the magic that the Saviour was constantly at the Ministry had faded away over time and Harry was very thankful for that. Once he reached the lifts, two Auror trainees were already in the lift and they both stared at Harry as he made his way inside.
He needed to go back to the bar to see Malfoy but he couldn’t ask Hermione to get some of Ben’s hair again without being questioned nor could he ask Seamus for more polyjuice potion. Just before heading back to the crazy lunatics who still probably hadn’t started packing, Harry had a plan. A devious one at that but, what could he do.
“I ran into Malfoy last night.” Harry spoke suddenly, string straight ahead at the opposite wall. He then heard Hermione choke on her drink.
There was a part of him that wanted to go and see which picture they were looking at. Whether it was that time he and Ginny went to Paris on holiday and Ginny brought with her a stereotypical French person costume and forced Harry to go out in it (those memories shall never be re-lived), or whether it was the permanent marker drawings that Seamus drew on his face while he was asleep. But the other part of him was screaming to just get this done and over with.
“Hey. What will it be sir?” Jack asked Harry happily. Merlin, he must have really liked his job Harry thought.
“Coming right up.” Jack went away to grab one of the numerous whiskey bottles on the back shelf and filled up two fingers of whiskey. Sliding a few Muggle notes across the bar, Harry took his drink with a nod and left the bar to stand by the far wall, to be able to watch the dancers. To try and find the man he was looking for.
“It has taken you so long to get your head out of your arse to actually realise that you were! We all had a bet to see how long you’d deny it and then finally accept.”
“See, you weren’t terrible at dancing.” Malfoy said, a smile starting to bloom across his face. His lips looked much redder from when he first came in and it seemed from Harry’s point of view, his trousers had gotten tighter as well. Harry blushed.
It was much colder in the bathroom than Harry expected but it was welcomed. The air cooled down his skin and briefly distracted him from the sharp, stabbing pain he felt in his chest.
He looked very similar to when he was here the last time Harry was. A white button down with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, exposing his mark to the crowd and tight black leather trousers which emphasised his arse. Harry stared at him as he made his way to the bar, ordering some sort of complex drink to Jack and waited. He leaned forward on his pointy elbows, head resting in his right hand and a look of boredom on his face from where Harry was standing.
“This may sound quite abrupt, which it is, I’m not hiding from that fact. But, this relationship is not going to work out. I’m,” he didn’t think that actually saying it out loud would be that much of a big of a deal. “gay.” Silence swept into the room.
“Don’t call them that!” Harry warned Malfoy, now turning around in his seat to stare up at him. Harry could now see the grey pools that were his eyes, staring back at him. They were captivating, like you could get lost in them for hours.
“Thanks Ron.” Harry returned the clap to the shoulder before heading for the door, grabbing his coat along the way and walked out of the flat.
“But nobody did it because they had to or that it was Malfoy. They actually did it because they like him?” Harry was still trying to answer that question.
“A Malfoy? Nice? Never in a million years thought I would hear those two words together.” Ron joked while Hermione continued looking at Harry.
“So I am if you really are that blind!” Seamus joked but Harry could see that he was trying to rile it back in.
“We have plenty, don’t worry Ginny.” Hermione interrupted her as she reached into her coat pockets and withdrew small, brown boxes then spelled them back to original size.
Harry hadn’t really thought this through. In the midst of his small panic, he just went with his polyjuice donor’s name.
They all stayed like that for several minutes, trying to calm Harry down. Without leaving Harry’s side, Ron levitated the food being cooked onto plates and guided them to the coffee table in front of them. There was the clinking of glasses and the sound of splashing and 3 glasses of orange juice found their way to the table as well. Harry’s sobs subsided into just sniffles and rubbings of his nose. He looked at the platter of bacon, toast, eggs and sausages as well as the orange juice that Ron had put to the table and he suddenly realised how hungry he was. Thinking about it, the day before he didn’t have lunch nor dinner then he went to a bar and drank his little heart out.
Here is your chapter for the week. Now, this chapter is a bit more saucy. I know my friend is going to be reading this and for the love of God, please don't judge me (anymore than you do already, haha).
He finally made it to the office. He opened the door to find Seamus swamped with paperwork that over the piles of it, you could only see the top of his head.
Hermione moved herself out of the doorway so Harry could enter. The polyjuice potion was starting to wear off. His hair was now in splotches, a mixture of sandy brown and raven coloured hair. His skin was starting to return to normal colour and he could feel himself shrinking very slowly as he walked. Not by much though. Harry closed the door behind him and found his way to the sofa. Flopping back, he laid his head on the back of the sofa, resting his slightly throbbing head from the alcohol. He hadn’t drunk enough to be wasted but he was definitely tipsy. Harry wanted to rest his eyes and go to sleep when he remembered his two eagle-eyed best friends staring at him in front of the sofa.
The atmosphere was incredible. The music, although loud, suited the situation. The smell of alcohol was strong but not overpowering. At least not enough to give someone a headache. The dance floor was filled with people, not caring what they looked like, hands in the air, jumping to the beat. Like Harry thought, the atmosphere was incredible and care-free. The dancing group did look like a lot of fun however Harry’s mission was to consume as much alcohol until he couldn’t think straight.
Harry released a breath he didn’t know he was holding. He returned to his original comfy position on the sofa and nearly closed his eyes until Ron came back into the living room.
It had rained earlier in the day and puddles littered the cobbled street. Harry, not really realising where he was going, abruptly stepped in one, covering his entire right foot in freezing water.
“What is all this?” Harry pointed at all the paperwork, turning over a few pages on top of Seamus’ pile.
“But I should go back!” Harry got off the sofa and started pacing the space between the sofa and the opposite wall. “I can tell Seamus that I’ve sighted Malfoy and go undercover.”
It was probably about 1 in the morning by the time Harry left the gay bar. And his mission complete, he was utterly wasted. It was a surprise that he could make it out of the door without tripping up and falling on his face. Apparating in this state would definitely end very badly and he couldn’t Floo from anywhere. Harry had already planned ahead and during his time at the bar, he had texted Ron to come and pick him up at a certain station which wasn’t far from his current position. All he needed to do was put one foot in front of the other without falling over.
The water nearly ran over the brim of the sink as Harry was released from his thoughts. Acting quickly, he turned the taps off and splashed his face with the cooling water. He did that a couple of times to freshen himself up. His headache was starting to go away and would fully disappear when he would wake the next morning.
Harry, as Ben, entered the gay bar once again. There were bright flashing red and white lights and the dance floor was filled to the brim with men. Harry decided to dress up a little compared to his usual attire. He wore tighter dark jeans which hugged his legs in the right places, along with a fitted white t-shirt and a dragonhide jacket to top it off. It was still very vanilla compared to the rest of the bar’s choice of clothes but he did feel a bit more like he belonged here.
“Don’t worry about it,” and that was all Harry could make out before the music started belting again.
“Malfoy” Harry said back casually, returning to his glass and swallowing another mouthful of whiskey. The burn was much needed if he were to continue in this conversation.
To his surprise however, Ginny slowly took his hand in hers and squeezed reassuringly. The tears started to overflow from behind his eyelids.
Sorry about the delay. It's the start of term and I haven't had much time to write a new chapter but here it is!
“Ginny, you didn’t.” They were the first words that Harry had spoken directly to Ginny since breaking up.
“Nothing.” He quickly replied before returning to his folding of the last few items of clothing. In the silence, Ron and Harry had finished collecting Harry’s clothes and had them neatly (or at least to the boy’s standards) in the boxes. After grabbing the boxes, they went to exit the bedroom and into the living room where the girls were packing up the kitchen and living area. By the time they made it into the living area, both Hermione and Ginny were giggling. This made both boys rather concerned.
“Of money and power, yeah, yeah.” Harry interrupted him. Malfoy must have told this story to many, not just Harry. But Malfoy’s warning and threat weren’t enough to deter Harry from his goal so he raised his glass to Jack, “Another if you will, please.”
Malfoy huffed in amusement to that response. Now, the moment had come, leaving. It was like that awkward moment at the end of a date when nobody had a clue what to do. They both stared at each other, a look of longing in each other’s eyes. To Harry’s surprise, they leaned in at the same time. Harry had never kissed a man before but he didn’t think that it would be as gentle as this. Malfoy’s lips were soft, not chapped compared to Harry’s, well, Ben’s. It wasn’t rough, it was rather pleasant. Although it was only a chaste kiss, it still left tingles all over Harry’s body when Malfoy stepped back. His pupils had dilated, most likely the same as Harry’s.
“After the war I wasn’t quite settled and wanted a fresh start, so I wrote a list of things I wanted to change. I didn't expect a relationship to be part of it, but I’m not complaining.”
But Harry didn't have time to watch his competition. He needed to concentrate on his own tasks. Mix the dry ingredients, whisk the eggs, measure the sugar…
Draco was staring, his eyes wide and his lips twitching. And then he burst out laughing. "You're jealous!"
“That’s his problem, not mine.” Harry took a sip of his coffee and raised an eyebrow at the group a few tables away. “You know, I think I may have to go over there, Blaise is saying something about sneaking off to the Prefect's bath…”
Draco petted Harry’s head and Harry hummed with content. Draco giggled and spoke softly, hoping his tone would help Harry relax.
On the other side of London, two bodies slid together with abandon; muscle memory fueling exploration of their most intimate parts. The grip on Harry's hips, the angle Draco slammed into him...it had all been done before.
Ron slapped a hand over his mouth. “Nope, don’t want to know about your extracurricular activities in the Slytherin dorms, thank you.”
Harry shut his eyes and shuttered out the breath he’d been unknowingly holding. His shoulders relaxed and a smirk spread across his face. His eyes snapped open and zeroed in on Draco’s face. He pulled his wand and wordlessly locked the door, silenced the room, and sent a quick patronus.
Draco turned his head and kissed Harry’s palm. “I’d like that.” Harry kissed his forehead in reply. Draco jumped at the feel of something warm and slick encircle his penis. He looked down to see a cock ring and he knew the sweet moment was over.
Kreacher dropped into a bow, talking to the floor. "Kreacher made Chocolate Lava Cakes, Black Forest Gateau, and Hazelnut Meringue Cake drizzled in chocolate."
Harry gave Daisy a lopsided smile and agreed. He reluctantly let go of her arms and began to walk away.
"Minerva, Draco, today I've made a Tiramisu, a Hazelnut Dacquoise, and in case you want something a bit lighter, Jaffa Cakes."
Draco patted Harry’s shoulder. “I know just the thing, but it's going to take some work. You’re probably going to be here all morning...and maybe for lunch?”
Draco gripped Harry’s shoulders and slammed him back against the wall. Harry hissed in pain. “What the fuck, Mal...mmm.” His words trailed off when a plush pillowy mouth crashed into his. Harry tried to suck in a breath to protest, but only succeeded in parting his lips, allowing Draco to slip his tongue in. He moaned and shut his eyes, giving in to the delicious taste invading his senses. Draco started to retreat, but Harry quickly wrapped his arms around his waist and pulled him flush against his body. Draco sighed and draped his arms over Harry shoulders, sinking into the kiss and propping them against the wall. The air around them was heated with intent, sweat was pooling at the back of their necks while hands began to wander. Draco slid one leg in between Harry’s, pressing him further into the wall and moaning in delight. When their hardened lengths brushed, it startled Harry and he pushed Draco off of him, abruptly ending the kiss. Draco stumbled a bit, but caught himself. A chuckle broke the silence and Harry glared at where Draco was leaning back against the wall.
“So you can slow down mate. Also, I’m rubbish at folding clothes neatly anyway.” Ron joked to diffuse the tension. It helped.
“So, you’re really kicking me out? Merlin, Malfoy! I’d actually believe you if I was a bit drunker, which by the looks of things, you’re not gonna allow me to do. You’re acting like you own the bloody place.” Harry finally turned away to face the bottles of alcohol once more.
Harry slowed down to a more productive pace and helped Ron with folding and putting the clothes away in the boxes that Ron had provided. A comfortable silence fell upon the two. It was nice. Harry didn’t feel like talking anyway. There was nothing to talk about. Actually there was. There was something really interesting to talk about. But Harry didn’t think that Ron would want to get into a conversation about a certain blonde.
A burst of excitement coursed through Harry. He hadn’t had this thrill of excitement for a very long time. Recent cases that had come through weren’t very fulfilling and Harry thought that he was wasting his time. But now, he felt that every boring case has led to this one. Only Seamus stood in his way but he would probably say “Sure, go ahead.”
“Surprised to see you here, Potter” the familiar drawl coming from behind. He sounded the exact same from when he last talked to him in the Room of Requirement.
The night air was very cool and much needed. It cooled down Harry’s skin that was still on fire after Malfoy had kissed it and touched it. It was windy however so he still felt hot. Especially when Malfoy was hanging off his arm.
The music seemed to be louder tonight. Harry’s heart was beating rapidly in his chest. Yes, he was nervous. Even under the protection of polyjuice, he had to be cautious. He had enough to get him through the evening, but only just. Seamus had made sure that the bottle he gave him was only enough for one night, no more. This did annoy Harry but at least he would be able to satisfy his own curiosity.
Harry now felt desire. He wanted, needed something more, more contact. Gracefully, he leaned his head further to the side, giving more exposure to his neck and shoulder. He did feel sort of on display for Malfoy but he didn’t care. Malfoy looked down and seemed to have got the message.
“Thank you.” Harry choked out before sobbing his eyes out. Hermione’s fast reactions enveloped him in a tight hug so he could cry on her shoulder. Harry heard scuffling on the hardwood floorboards and felt Ron’s arms encircling them both in an even tighter embrace.
“Harry, how are you feeling?” Hermione’s soft voice spoke next to him. “You passed out as soon as you got into the car. Ron had to carry you up the stairs.” There was slight amusement in her voice, trying to lighten the situation.
This went on until the next song, Malfoy still grinding from behind, moving his hands up and down Harry’s sides, Harry still leaning against his shoulder. He was starting to go to the point of no return. His trousers were getting tighter, his eyes were closing in pleasure. Even if it was Malfoy doing this, Harry was enjoying himself. Enjoying dancing. Now there’s a thought he never thought he’d make.
The bar was dimly lit. A few tables surrounded a small dance floor and a stage. It was relatively quiet since the night was still young, but a few people were sitting and talking in hushed conversations. One person danced by himself to the upbeat song, uncaring of the world around him as he undulated his hips to the music.
It is a testament to my respect for Healer Rostova that I'm writing this letter. Honestly, years ago—when I was you, I suppose—I'd have thought that this exercise was for mentally ill people who were stuck ruminating on the past.
So he tried to tiptoe past the rowdy group taking care not to make a sound to alert them to his presence and cause them to invite him. He wasn’t sure whether he could continue to make this many excuses about homework and the like, since even
He trudged toward the door, not bothering to throw a dressing gown over his boxers and t-shirt, despite the constant chill of Grimmauld Place.
Because when he's with Draco, he doesn't feel like a "freak," nor is he the "Golden Boy." He's Harry, and he's a speccy git and he's an annoying prat and an idiot Gryffindor.
Harry’s jaw tightened. “That’s because we don’t kill suspects on sight. We bring them in for questioning or let the court determine their fate.”
Brooklyn Heights was about as suburban as you could get in New York without living upstate, and if you were that desperate for solitude, you should really move to Vermont or Rhode Island or even Canada. If you’re not inhaling a concerning amount of smog on a regular basis, Draco thought, you weren’t a New Yorker.
The icy ground crunched under Harry's boot when he stepped into the clearing. Dread twisted in his stomach as he surveyed the scene until his eyes caught on something red in the snow.
Harry pressed his lips together, nodding. "We do, if we're going to make it to the flat in Chicago."
If you were awake, you'd call me an idiot in that fond way of yours that really means that you think you deserved worse than the effects of a spell that neither of us knew at the time. And I'd just smile at you because I can't believe you let me be near you, let alone
Harry turns back onto his side, willing himself not to vomit and not knowing whether it was from the firewhiskey or the poison of heartache.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry, pulling them both down to lie on the couch. “I know, Harry. I’m always safe with you.”
The only marks I want to leave on your skin are ones made from love, with my mouth and hands. And I want them to fade eventually just so I can leave new ones in their place.
That's when Potter had leaned down from the beast and presented his hand and said, "Do you trust me?"
Draco let the statement linger between them for a moment, his throat tight with something he couldn’t identify. They continued walking long enough for it to loosen, for him to gather his courage.
She turned away and glanced back up at the clouds as she started down the path away from the potter’s field. If her calculations were correct, the next full moon was in three weeks.
Not mollified but still compliant, Potter sits on the bench. I watch recognition take over his features. Then he looks at me in surprise. "So, you..."
"Well, you are bisexual, right? You came out in the Prophet over the summer after your break up with Ginevra?"
I’ll admit—you’ve managed to outsmart my former colleagues, not that many of them were very bright, to begin with. I was always the real brains of the operation, not that any of them listened to me.
She walked until she reached a clearing far from the graveyard. She reached into her pocket and retrieved her knife. She took off her cloak, ignoring the freezing wind that nipped at her skin. With a grimace, she cut through the fabric, reducing it to shreds before leaving it in a pile.
The person smiled as they sat in their chair, patting the one next to them for Draco to sit. "My drag name is Nex Doughty, but my friends call me Cori."
Suddenly, a large rope wrapped around his arms and midsection, tightening and pulling him backward. Harry fell to the ground with an
Draco looked at him in confusion as Potter reached into his pocket and handed him his wand, making Draco’s eyes go wide.
Draco mimicked his petulant frown. “Aww, ickle Harry, being waited on for days by his flatmate-turned-boyfriend.”
“Remember, class, your homework for tomorrow is seven inches on the history of the Summoning Charm. You are dismissed," Flitwick turned to the board, casting a cleaning charm to erase the notes.
You turn your gaze away, and you try to look as enticing as possible when you sip your drink, knowing his eyes will soon risk glancing over at you.
Ron stared at Hermione almost as much as Harry stared at Malfoy, but surely Ron didn't think their friend was up to something.
Draco clicked his tongue. "Not quite, darling. I know you can do better for me. Now, care to try again before I find someone else to fulfill me for the evening?"
Harry didn’t think beyond getting up from his seat and striding toward the bar, quickening his pace when he saw Draco’s eyes widen in panic. He barely registered the look of horror on the stranger’s face when he grabbed the hand gripping Draco’s thigh and pinned the man face-down on the bar.
"No," Draco said. "I have some pride left. I don't need to see my dreams denied to me explicitly in some passive-aggressive rejection letter. 'Dear Mr. Malfoy,' it'll say, 'We regret to inform you that while your credentials are extraordinary and your NEWTS have the highest marks we've ever seen, you are, unfortunately, a disgrace to all Wizarding kind. You should retreat to some distant corner of Knockturn or take refuge in the Muggle world until you either die or give in to your evil tendencies and end up in Azkaban where you belong.'"
Malfoy nodded. "Good. Right then. Oh, Granger wanted me to give you this," Malfoy reached into his pocket and handed Harry a note.
Malfoy wasn't fazed. "It really shouldn't surprise you that your two best friends since childhood would be concerned for your wellbeing, even if it has been three years since you left them behind without so much as a note. They've been helping me with the investigation."
Harry didn't hesitate to use his free hand to yank the blindfold up and over his head, ignoring Draco's amused expression at the way his hair must be sticking up, staticky. He reached into his pocket to retrieve his glasses, blinking as his eyes adjusted.
harry moves his tongue just so, knowing that the quiver of His thighs precedes imminent come pulsing down his throat. harry licks the cock clean before it is tucked back into His trousers.
"You were in St. Mungos for nearly a week! Do you know how agonizing it was to see you like that? Do you--" Draco's voice cracked and he cut himself off, turning away from Harry.
It's a gorgeous home. It's still technically furnished, even if most of it was in disarray when officials found it. It's also just enough distance from the shore to watch the tide come in without the risk of flooding.
Potter nodded. “I can understand that. It’s an amazing city. But I will say—you were wrong about one thing.”
“Hmm,” Draco furrowed his eyebrows at the paper. “Except for Bellatrix, most of them were pretty quiet.”
The angry ones don't always come, but a few encounters are enough to deter us, no matter what the Wizengamot said when it declared I was still allowed to walk the same streets as everyone else.
So Luna took matters into her own hands. She used her gift; her creatures happily helped her sew the red cloaks. She made lists and plans, read books and cared for her father. It was best not to tell him; his nerves couldn’t take it.
Draco pressed into Harry, kissing him gently to stop his ranting. “It’s alright love. We’ll keep her. I’m sure we can figure out how to train her, seeing as neither of us has ever owned a cat.”
"She said you've been under the influence of a potion--that's why you've been forced into smiling. So she asked me to, er, snap you out of it."
Harry let himself laugh a little. "It's not that either. It's just--none of this," he waved a hand lazily at the mirror, "is mine. Everything in the mirror is from someone else. And that's all people care about. They see my face and think about what belongs to them or to someone else and they don't think about the fact that it's mine. It belongs to me, not them."
Draco let out an affected sigh. "Well, I'd better be off. I'm running late to meet Harry. I suppose I'll have to find some way to make it up to him..." He winked at Lucius and walked away, moving through the hallway and past the guards to the exit.
“My father is buried somewhere in a potter’s field in Romania because no one was there to claim his body before I could get there,” Luna said lowly. “I can’t let his killer get away with this, Harry. Give me two days.”
He doesn't have to wait as long as Hermione to unwrap the bandage. It's red and tender, and he's almost tempted to use a healing spell to speed up the process, but he doesn't. He can wait.
For a few minutes, neither of them spoke; they just kept walking slowly down the promenade, listening to the echoes of the city and the sound of the river as it moved with the wind.
She heard the groaning more clearly and sensed it coming from what appeared to be the bedroom. She stalked toward the bedroom door and opened it, letting it creak.
Draco laughed. “Potter, unless I had the entire Malfoy vault at my disposal, it wouldn’t be practical to live by myself in a flat in Washington Square Park just after moving to the city. No, I had roommates for five years and have lived alone the last two.”
Speaking of being an Auror, Harry was pretty sure this prick was breaking some sort of public indecency laws by the way he was sliding his hand further and further up Draco’s leg. Draco gently pried the man’s hand from his thigh, only for the stranger to laugh and reach over again, gripping it even more firmly.
“I suppose I'll go, but only since I've already finished my tea,” Draco said with another sigh, which Harry ignored as they both rose from their seats. While they walked to the Apparition point together, Harry replayed in his mind the flicker of emotion on Draco’s face when he said “home.”
Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He held his wand firmly in his hands, letting the magic course through his body one last time.
he said to Ron, a month into Auror training. He'd expected anger, shock. Instead, Ron just clapped him on the shoulder and gave him a thin-lipped smile that said
For example, I know you were in Diagon Alley sometime before you left. You sat at that bench outside Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes and you probably cast a cushioning charm. The people who go and sit on that bench and cast their own spells have no idea that they’re sitting on the last known traces of the Boy Who Lived’s magic in all of London. That spell you cast five years ago still lingers.
The hand on his arm squeezed gently, rousing Harry from his daze. He blinked and shook his head, his eyes focusing on Draco's entire face rather than just his mouth.
“Mate,” Harry rubbed over his eyes. “Let’s think about what we have here. This ‘Little Red’ person is obviously not someone we’ve encountered before. They keep using different methods of killing people, only targeting former Death Eaters, so it’s probably someone badly hurt by the war or who lost a loved one.”
He looked back to find Draco silent and staring at him curiously. Harry flushed under his searching gaze.
Even as instinctual fear wrapped his heart in an icy grip, he closed his eyes, preparing to be consumed by the fire. Soon, he would be mere ashes, indistinguishable from the remains of the Room.
. I wish I could memorize the look on your face when you see the headline: "Congratulations to Harry and Draco Potter on their nuptials!" I wish I could be a ghost in the room when you realize that your name will die with you like a disease.
"Shhh," Harry leaned forward, rubbing a soothing hand over Draco's. "We'll make it okay. We'll figure this out together, alright?"
5. He hates cardamom, and anything flavored with it. The man’s palate is so unrefined as to have an obsession with orange soda, but if cardamom is in any dish, he can taste it.
He carefully laced his fingers into Potter’s hair, feeling the soft strands and the remnants of the product that Pansy had used. He couldn’t see Potter’s face, but after a moment, he noticed the muscles in the other boy’s back begin to relax, starting to shift unconsciously closer to Draco.
"Whether or not you care that your friends and loved ones have been worried about you for three years? And what—if anything—you plan to do about that?"
They flew for a little while longer in comfortable silence. Draco closed his eyes, and he realizes that he's never felt safer or more free in his life than right now, with his arms around Potter's waist and the world and its problems so small below them.
Harry plastered a wide smile on his face; he didn't miss Draco's eyes narrowing slightly in suspicion. "N-nothing! Just--" he glanced quickly out the window of the restaurant on the boat, looking at the spot where the horizon met the sea. It looked to be just a few minutes until sunset. They'd just ordered their food; it would probably give him just enough time.
I wonder if my hair still gleams in the firelight, or if the dust has dulled that, too. I wonder if you'd like this—the way my heart, my body, my love have been preserved for you as if under a
I want to spend every season with you. I want to dance together in the April rain, tuck May flowers into your wild curls, feel the sand between our toes, light the fireplace, and drink warm spiked cocoa. I want your hand in mine to be the constant in a world that still never knows how it wants to feel.
His body felt heavy and sluggish, which wasn't helped by the stiff, unfamiliar mattress beneath him.
He was going to break up with him, and then kill him, and then revive him just to break up with him once more.
Father is waiting for me in the living room. His glower makes me miss the moon, and I almost try to Apparate away, but he turns on the wards before I can lift my wand, and I’m trapped.
"We'll be alright, Draco, I promise," Harry whispered into Draco's hair, kissing the top of his head.
Harry startled, not noticing that Malfoy had come up next to him, sat on the stool at the bar and rested his elbows on the table, chin resting in his palms.
Draco's eyes widened in understanding. He'd only heard his father grumble about drag queens when he'd had to go to Knockturn on business ventures, and he'd been taught that they were "freaks."
Potter, please, keep your distance from me. You make me feel radioactive, and I need as little chaos in my life as possible, and you can only lead to trouble.
To George Weasley, I leave the Cloak of Invisibility. I know you'll put it to good use. Thank you for the map; I hope this is enough to return the favor.
9. I always wanted to write him a story, one starring those little people he was doodling. I wanted to help describe the world created by his mind. I wanted to do it together, for it to be ours.
Harry grinned and turned back to Draco. “They’ll be alright without me. C’mon, let’s go home. I’ll make us some tea, yeah?”
Harry let out a short laugh and opened his mouth to respond when he caught sight of Malfoy darting quickly out of the room.
He raised an eyebrow “So...are you going to tell me what you want? Or am I going to go back to my flat?”
I want to thank you, really. You’ve been doing my work for me. I always intended to get revenge on them for how they treated me—like I was a dog.
Taygete let out a huff and flapped her wings. If Potter was bothered by Draco tightening his grip in fear, he didn't show it.
I'm not the sort of ghost you can see. And yet I haunt you, don't I? My sobs and whimpers echo in your ears. My magic is in the wand you stole from me, the one you claimed was lost but we both know is stowed away in your trunk. My lifeless eyes stare at you when you try in vain to sleep without thinking of my eternal rest.
The last thing he saw before he closed the door was Ginny put her head in her hands, her shoulders shaking.
Harry's feet kept taking him up the Muggle street and into a busier section of London. He had no idea where he was going. He just needed to rid himself of his troubles and let go of everything in his mind.
“Well, Jack was right about how he acts like he owns the place and that everyone does nearly everything for him.” Harry could see out of the corner of his eye Ron shuddering.
And there he was. Draco Malfoy in all his glory, a look of pure bliss on his face. His hair was a little longer at the front than when they were at school and it wasn’t slicked back. He had grown taller and had become more muscled from what Harry could see from sitting down at the bar. He was also dancing quite intimately with a man in front of him.
“I do kinda agree with the manipulation point? Because, come on, it’s Malfoy!” Ron quickly stated when Hermione gave him the warning look.
Harry silently moaned as he moved his head even further back and he started to take control of the movement downstairs. It was a weird, wet, warm sensation and Harry seemed to not get enough of it. Malfoy smiled against Harry’s skin and moved further upwards, his lips attaching to the sensitive part behind Harry’s ear which he didn’t know existed. Malfoy’s hands stopped moving up and down Harry’s sides and went in search of bare skin. Harry’s t-shirt wasn’t tucked into his trousers anymore so Malfoy casually slipped his hand underneath. Without looking, his long fingers outlined each one of the muscles that lay there. From when Harry looked in the mirror at Ben’s image before he headed out, Ben had some muscle there, not as much as Harry but he had a flat stomach and defined muscles. Harry moaned a little louder this time, also because Malfoy started to add biting and licking into the mix of things he was doing to Harry’s neck.
Harry removed the jacket from his body, exposing his arms to the chill to get a better look at the mark. It was on his left side of his neck where it meets the shoulder. It was bright purple, everyone could tell that it was a hickey. Harry carefully rubbed his fingers against it expecting it to hurt or at least feel sore. It did a bit but nothing he couldn’t manage. Harry was a little bit mesmerised by the mark. In some sort of perverse way it was like Malfoy marked him like an animal, like he just put a big sign on top of Harry’s head that said “mine”. Harry didn’t know how to feel about that.
A strange thought then occurred to Harry. Why was Malfoy, in all his pure-blood glory, dancing to Muggle music, surrounded by Muggles and dancing with a Muggle in a gay bar? His question was soon answered as Malfoy turned his head and found Harry staring. A complete look of surprise, and possibly disgust was placed on his face. But, as quickly as he saw Harry, Malfoy’s well trained smirk made its way onto his lips and he wrapped his arms casually around the shorter man’s neck from behind and lowered his lips to the man’s exposed shoulder.
“Sorry to tell you that. But really, how long do you think you can last with just the outfit you wore when you came to us?” That was Hermione talking, Harry thought to himself.
“Also mate, just a heads up. Ginny floo called earlier asking if you can come and get your things from your old place.” Harry was about to interrupt Ron but Ron put his hand up. “Don’t worry Harry. You can stay with us until you can find your own place.”
Harry groaned as he sat up, his hand immediately going to rub his eyes, the intense pain behind them. He reached out to where Ron was holding the bottle and grabbed it, swallowing the entire contents of the potion in one. The effect was instantaneous and the headache subsided.
“Any guy will be lucky to have you, Harry” and with that, Harry collapsed in her arms in a bunch of wet, cold tears. When he had played this situation in his head, he never thought that he would react so emotionally to it, neither did he think that Ginny would be so supportive. And by the sounds of things, all his friends.
“No, but because he is there so often and he is rich and powerful, he feels like he does. And all the staff and regulars know him, respect him. It’s really strange.”
“No you haven’t. Even if you are gay, you could have gone to any bar to have a drink.” Malfoy leaned in closer but still far enough away so he wasn’t entering Harry's personal space. “What did you really come here for? To dance and have fun? To find someone?” Did Malfoy’s voice suddenly get huskier?
“Department of Magical Law Enforcement please.” Harry asked the taller trainee who was standing nearest the buttons. The lift closed its doors and went down and there was silence. Harry could tell there were two pairs of eyes staring into the back of his head but he didn’t really want to get into an awkward conversation with others.
“Daisy? Bloody hell, it is you.” Harry threw his arms around Daisy and lifted her into a spin. She squealed, but covered her mouth to block the sound. Harry set her down and rested his forehead against hers. “I’ve waited so long to get you alone. I know we’ve had our brief moments in town, but I just can’t stop thinking about you. I want you.” Daisy let out a soft tinkling laugh and Harry smiled.
“The imperius cast on me warped the blood ritual or so my mind healers believe.” Bellatrix leans back in her seat and crosses her legs. Remus looks curiously at her for a long moment. “They’re not entirely sure why the imperius reacted with the blood ritual in such a way because my mind was more or less shattered when James died.  The forced breaking of our bonding contract caused the Black family magic to lash out and break both the imperius and the blood ritual but…it had been subdued somehow to the overwhelming force of the Black family magic damaged my mind in the process.”
“As much as I’d love to believe that sir, you are not my mother’s favorite person. All things considered, you’re not very high on my list either considering you tried to throw her into Azkaban when she was obviously severally mentally broken. My mother is a good woman but I am her only child and she would see you dismantled before allowing me to meet with you privately. Now, if you’ll excuse me, headmaster, I’ve got class with Professor Snape, and as I am not Professor Snape’s favorite person I would rather not be late.”
Hello everyone! I know it's been a very long time since I updated. Unfortunately, I just lost a lot of the inspiration I had for this work. I'm hoping to slowly work through it. My writer's block has been really bad this year, and I've struggled a lot recently to write at all. Part of this chapter has been sitting in my wips for months now because I just wasn't sure how to end this chapter. I also wanted to try and make it as long as the last few chapters posted. Though it isn't as long as the last chapters posted, I'm still happy with how it ended. I hope you all enjoy it.
Harry wheezes out a pained laugh when Draco elbows him harshly in the ribs and turns his nose up at the whole lot of them. “If you must know, Mother and father have their fun like normal parents must. They do not enjoy those beast chasing their heir!” Harry laughs again when Draco daintily picks up a piece of toast and curls his lips in a disgusted sneer toward Pansy and Blaise. Theo was a bit further down the table making eyes as a certain bushy haired Gryffindor. That was no surprise really.
“Bellatrix, you say? How is she?” Harry narrows his eyes at the headmaster who dared to question him about his mother. He’d practically sold her to Azkaban if Harry remembers reading correctly. Had it not been for Narcissa and Lucius pleading her case and showing the evidence through a reputable mind healer his mother would have never gotten out of her imprisonment. “I heard she had been seeing a mind healer for a time.”
Severus feels exposed when her eyes rest on him unflinchingly. They were vivid and unrelenting. He checks his occlumency shields just to be sure she wasn’t reading his mind. She was not. Bellatrix had always been scarily good at weeding out falsehoods and figuring out information many sought to hide beneath the floorboards. Severus is beginning to wonder if it had always been something she was naturally good at. She was charming in a way few could pull off...even purebloods. He wonders if it was another way of the Black familial magic making itself known not unlike the metamorphmagus trait.
Harion watches as the great beast tilts its head as if in wonder before tucking itself calming around him. He feels the softness of the serpent’s scales rub against his hand as the creature moves.
Her tone dares someone to question her and when they all glance at Draco he merely shrugs and turns his nose to the side trying to appear superior.
“Narcissa, our contract was a finalized one. It was not one of the ones that are made for children.” Narcissa’s eyes widen. There were several different types of bonding contracts. There were contracts made for young children that did not have any strict regulations. Children were merely told they would be bonding someone when they grew older but that was not to say they could not date someone else. They often did not date others but there were not magical consequences for doing so. There were also true soul bonding contracts that created magical guidelines leading up to a proper bonding. Both participants swore fidelity to one another on their magic lest they lose their magic entirely. The contract could be absolved if both parties sought it for differences in opinions. “Narcissa, I have no memory or memory gap in place that indicates our bonding contract was ever absolved. It broke on October 31th 1981. The mind healers believe that was what broke the control the imperius had over my mind.”
Her question hangs in the silence between them. Would he take her son from her? No. Harion was just as much her son as he was his son...if not more so. She had seen him grow and raised him in a household full of love and acceptance. Could Severus have done the same? Would he be so cruel as to tear away from his son what little happiness he had experienced in his short painful life? “No. You are his mother. You’ve shown him what it is to be loved and accepted and cherished something I fear I would not have been able to do even had I known...that he was my son.” It was the first time Severus had said it aloud. Harion was his son. Harion. Harry. Harrison. The small black-haired boy who flinched at the loudest noise and hadn’t spoken until he was seven was his son. He was beautiful.
“Oh yeah!” the guard pulls open his outer robes slight and pulls an official ministry file out before resizing it. “Here you are then.”
It seemed as if students were holding their breath the longer he sat while the hat made its decision. He was becoming uneasy with the length of time as well having thought the hat would choose just as instantly for him as it had the girl before.
. Some say you’re off living as a Muggle, and some believe you’re still here and walking around under your Invisibility Cloak. Others have presumed you to be dead. Granger and Weasley tell me you’d enjoy the way the media is largely ignoring you now, aside from publishing any random claim of having spotted you somewhere.
The space next to Harry suddenly felt empty, vacant. But Draco was in New York; he didn’t have time for the stars.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows. "Congruence? My, what an advanced word for you, Potter. Someone's been reading big boy books!"
Putting on his best Auror glare, Harry crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow. "Get lost," he said, warning lacing his tone.
' and the moving picture of himself snarling at the photographer, he was sure it sold plenty of copies. And this time, Harry couldn't just toss it away with a laugh. He couldn't just roll his eyes. Seeing the truth--his private, secret truth--broadcast for the world's hungry eyes was the last straw.
"As if," Malfoy scoffed. "I'm graceful and dignified. You, however, have the gait and balance of a drunk erumpent."
Again we meet, as you stand on this precipice to look at the view, above the jagged rocks and waves below.
Draco'd closed the door behind him when he came in, and he was still standing. Harry was already kneeling on the floor in front of the suitcase.
Malfoy cocked his head. "But that's what Hogwarts was going to do, right? Send you here to look around and then have you scurry right back to report your findings before claiming it for your own?"
Hermione had told him he needed to get out more, to see people, to "socialize, Harry, go meet someone..."
He was a genius, after all. Potter could be talking about anything: his knowledge of the city, his taste in wine. But at the moment, he was particularly proud of himself for thinking to take Potter to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. It was gorgeous, especially at night. Draco often came here alone when he needed to think, but he’d seen couples walk down the path, holding hands and whispering to one another. It was the perfect romantic spot.
Potter interrupted him with a chuckle. "No, nothing happened. You just wanted me to sleep in here. I was just too tired to argue anymore."
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "That won't work; they'll think McGonagall put us up to it to 'set an example.' This is just insane enough to be true."
“Yes, Ron gave Robards the full briefing. You’re not expected in the office until a Healer permits it.”
Draco waved a hand. "I might've embellished a little, but that would be the underlying message. So, as I said, it's a waste of time to even consider it."
“I needed a break. The Quidditch season is over. I just broke off my engagement with the girl everyone thought I was supposed to marry. I heard this was the place people go to find themselves. Or to find...something.”
His mother had warned him to lay low in the house of the snakes for the majority of his first year; not to make a name for himself. Her advice was merely to protect him from more powerful upperclassmen. She wanted nothing more than for him to fit in and be surrounded by the power of the rest of the house. The only issue with that was that there was one rule; there were to be no secrets in the house of snakes. So, when he had been asked of his parents, he answered honestly his mother’s name and denied the idea of having a father. His mother was now a common topic of the jeering upperclassmen. They turned their noses at him and talked down to him at every turn. They were only trying to intimidate the seemingly unafraid first year. Harry gave them credit, any other first year would have cracked by now. The others might have made a run for it to Snape but their jeering only served to irritate him.
“Don’t you worry my boy, you’ve been with me I’m sure Professor Snape would not mind.” Dumbledore smiles and his eyes twinkle happily but Harry knows that he is not one bit happy with Harry's attitude right now. “As for your mother, I’m sure she’s not likely to fuss over your being praised by the headmaster, now would she? That wouldn’t show she was properly sane, would it?”
The next few weeks found the small group of first years on a basic schedule. Their system was in no way disrupted by their members seemingly odd standing in the house of the snakes. In fact, older students gave them much more of a wide birth than they had in the past. Harry was enjoying the pleasant atmosphere among the snakes as their lessons progressed despite the annoying nagging of Gryffindor students who just so happened to share their classes. Harry questioned the wit of whoever decided Slytherin and Gryffindor students should be in classes with one another when theirs’ was a rivalry unmatched in Hogwarts.
“Regardless of whether it displeased Harion or not, you will remain for the festive if you come.” Her gaze is sharp and Severus finds himself unwilling to argue further with her. She and Narcissa certainly looked like siblings at this moment. “Though Harion is wise he is just a boy and he will show manners befitting of his station. Though, I suppose a conversation when he returns home couldn’t hurt anything either.” There is a teasing look on her face that is again unusual. It was like nothing he had ever seen on her features but he was not opposed. Again, it made her look younger...livelier than ever before.
Harion nods and the two share a sort of staring contest sizing one another up. His mother often told him that purebloods upon first meeting seemed rigid and cold. They ticked off every minuscule detail about someone in very few moments. This vision was powerful, more powerful than some common wizards but less powerful than most of the pureblood children he was acquainted with. That meant that this small sliver of magic feeding the vision was likely only half or a small fraction of this man’s true magic. There was only one thing on this magical earth that could house the magic of the soul like this.
“Death looks poor on you, cousin,” Narcissa says after a long moment. She waves a hand impatiently and does enough wandless magic to cancel out any charms placed on the room to listen in on what they wanted to say. Bellatrix warms both her seat and Narcissa’s before casting a stronger warming spell on Sirius who stares at her in confusion for a long moment. “Have they told you why we’re here?”
Slytherin house had one other important rule. All issues within the house must be dealt with inside the dorms and interference was strictly prohibited. Of course no killing of fellow students was allowed but close calls had occurred before. More often than not fights like these occurred every year or so with little regularities. They were a fight for dominance and submission. The dominant party would garner the respect of the submissive party.   This was looking to be one of those fights.
The welcome feast was already a boisterous affair when they were walked single file into the great hall. Countless eyes raked over them and it felt as if some were weighing and measuring each little first year student to decide where they would go. There was a gaggle of red headed boys on one end of the room at the Gryffindor table and it appeared as if another member of that gaggled was joining them this year as well because a pair of twins were taunting him loudly as they passed by. The Slytherin table sat at the other end of the massive room. There were several children of affluent families that he knew at least a little and their gaze swept over each children in interest. Once their eyes reach him most pause for the briefest of moments and then continue on. Their eyes pause once more at Dray before continuing on down the line.
Harion reaches out to press a finger into the scales of the massive beast with ease. She dips her head down to nuzzle against the top of his head. Had he perhaps been any other boy he would have been terrified to be wrapped up in the confines of the massive beast labeled as classified XXXXX.
His tongue felt dry when he finally stood before a certain tap. He wondered if his birth mother ever felt this way. If she too ever stood before this very mirror and felt the same dark welcoming draw. Would she have understood it? Would she have followed it? Severus surely wouldn’t have. His Slytherin self-preservation would have won out. His birth mother was Gryffindor would her courage have won out. Perhaps she had found this place in her youth as well and traversed its depths. It would have been less noticeable if a girl had entered the lavatory and disappeared for a while. A ghost did haunt this very room and it was possible for any girl to make friends. His birth mother was said to have been very friendly in her youth.
“I did some research.” Marvolo raises an eyebrow at that. “Your mother was different from your siblings’ mother, right? Albus pushed you off as your sister’s bastard child born off a love potion but her true child died; I’m assuming. Mother says children born through love potions never live very long. She said it had something to do with the effects of the potion on the development of the fetus. Was your mother still alive when you figured out what Albus did? Your father died in 1927 a year after you were born but there wasn’t a death date listed anywhere for his second wife. It was almost as if no one wanted anyone to ever know she even existed nor her child.”
“Besides, Uncle Sev doesn’t hate Harry per say he merely doesn’t like anyone.” Draco reaches forward to play with Harry’s fingers. Harry smiles indulgently at his best friend. “Except for me of course, I am a special case, after all.”
“Of course.” Sirius signs the document with a flourish and his signature is as beautiful as ever. Ten years in Azkaban had not taken a lifetime of lessons out of him. “Ask away cousin. If I know the answer, I’ll tell it to you as straight as I can.”
He dives into his mother’s chest and hugs her as tightly as he possibly could. He knew that he was going to miss their quiet little home in the country side. He’d miss laying in the library reading over books while his mother went about her Sunday morning cleaning the house.
With a flick of his wrist the ropes around the boys tighten a bit more painfully and they whine pathetically. Flint steps forward and presses a finger to both boys that fell quiet to make sure they were still alive. Everyone waits with baited breath while he checks. Harry merely returns to his seat and picks up the book he had been reading. Draco returns his head of platinum locks to Harry’s lap.
Harry nearly spits his pumpkin juice out of his mouth in laughter at the grumble Draco gives about the bloody peacocks. The Malfoys were well known for own a multitude of prized peacocks. Those very same peacocks wreaked havoc chasing around the young heir whenever he so much as stepped near their vicinity. “Bloody hell those things still chase you? Mother would have them put down.” Pansy sniffs daintily toward Draco who merely glowers in her direction.
Harry glances to the left to see a redhead looking their way with a disgusted sneer on his parched lips. Pansy bares her teeth in irritation and Draco slowly drops his hand from Harry’s ear. Harry drastically misses his best friend’s warmth. Pureblood intermarriage was a custom passed down from family to family and as it stood whether someone actually knew it or not, Harry and Draco were not actually blood-related. They had been betrothed from the moment Bellatrix officially registered Harion Black as her son.
“I’m not sure I’m following you, Bella,” Narcissa says with a sigh. “If you could explain from the beginning perhaps, I would understand it better.”
Narcissa takes the quill and documents back from Sirius who is smiling crookedly toward them. His teeth, which had always been beautiful, were not in great shape but still nicer than most prisoners likely were. Once he was freed, she had no doubt he would be once they pushed for it, then they would get his teeth fixed first and foremost as well as get him in to see a mind healer.
He could read fairly clearly between the lines of his mother’s letter through years of practice reading her words. They balanced one another. Despite being mother and child for all intents and purposes they understood the harsh reality of mental trauma. His mother had been uncharacteristically aware of every thought and feeling that went through his mind whenever he’d get in his mood and as he grew to understand his trauma he understood hers as well.
“Mother says both of my parents were in Gryffindor.” The blue eyed boy closes his eyes in content as fingers run through his hair once more. Their cabin was rather quiet as most students had not reach the majority of the compartments in the back and the older years knew most pureblood children knew to take those seats first. At least that was what his mother had told him. “Even my god father was, the first Black to be a Gryffindor apparently.”
Harion stands and gathers his bag following the quite hissing down the hall a bit further to the abandoned girl’s lavatory. What snake would be hiding in the bathroom? Harion could feel his magic shifting toward something as if it was reaching out for him calling to him. Something dark and alluring was drawing him closer to the sinks and he found his feet following the call without a fight. His mother had said that ancient pureblood familial magic could feel like this. Her exact words were hypnotic and dark in relation to the darkest of Black family magic.
“You look like her.” Marvolo chuckles and runs a hand through his hair. Harry used to have a very similar habit until her mother trained it out of him. “We were very similar. She had the same kind of drive that I did. She encouraged me often to take my studies seriously and if they didn’t challenge me enough to finish them first and then move on to things that I found challenging. She wrote quite often and when I first told her of Elspeth, she was overjoyed. Looking back, I’d like to think she liked her enough when they met. Surely they met before my mother met her death.”
Severus shifts a bit in his seat to get more comfortable. He doubted this was the end of their discussions for the evening as Bellatrix was carefully refilling his cup. She hands it back to him with only a slight tremor to her hands. They used to shake incredibly badly. Occasionally, Narcissa had told him, when she had bad days her hands shake worse than normal and she doesn’t seem all together present. Severus can understand that to some extent. He has moments where he swears he could feel Tobias breaking his fingers. They would get phantom pains where the drunk man had dug his hand into the shattered glass beer bottle he accidentally knocked over. He would shake on days like that.
He remembers once asking his mother what familial magic felt like having never truly experienced it before. She had replied somewhat vaguely unable to really put it into words for him. Though what she had said resonated with him. He was still so young that asking questions of adults petrified him and he often feared belittlement or being outright ignored. His mother never did that and always tried to answer him to the best of her ability.
