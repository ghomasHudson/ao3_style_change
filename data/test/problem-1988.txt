Harry felt himself being lifted, and knew the memory was over. He landed again in the same spot he had just left, messing with his head a little bit to see the changes in the office from then and now. The Headmaster gestured for Harry to take a seat.
“We’ll find a way, Harry. Even if it kills me, I will find a way to remove the Horcrux without having to sacrifice you in the process. That is not an option. Please calm down, son. We need to get back to Headquarters,” Severus said, his last comment directed more towards Remus than Harry. He glanced over his shoulder at Lucius, who had stupefied Pettigrew in Harry’s panic.
Draco looked up with innocent eyes at his godfather, his tell tale smirk gone almost immediately. “Of course not, Sev; we were just having a simple discussion about werewolf mating habits.”
Harry had to think about that a moment before realizing that, no, he’d never actually heard that term before – from Severus or his books on Occlumency. “No, actually, he didn’t. What is it?” he asked, feeling wary of the answer before Draco even began to explain.
Severus stopped midway to taking a sip of tea and stared at Dumbledore. He had expected to have to deal with having Harry for a few days, and was even prepared for a week or two, but the rest of the summer? “What about the Weasleys? Molly and Arthur immediately volunteered to take him when they heard what had happened. Surely they haven’t changed their minds?”
I learn things so quickly. Whether it’s their jealousy or envy or whatever it is, I don’t want people to resent me for something I can’t control. Sometimes I think it would be better to feign incompetence than let the other students see that I’ve mastered a spell much faster than everyone else.”
As Tonks blinked open her eyes and looked up into the face of the Minister for Magic, she knew already what he would say.
The front lobby was sparsely furnished, but clean and homey feeling. The desk had been erected out of an old sideboard, and adorned with a marble countertop. A pretty young hostess was seated behind the desk, standing quickly when she saw Severus and Remus approach.
“No, Hermione. You’re not going to change my mind on this. I’m still going to talk to Weasleys of course, but until I know Ron and Ginny would be ok with it, I’m not going to ask to be a part of their family,” Harry said firmly, accepting the parchment that Hermione was handing back to him.
Fitting, don’t you think, Severus?”
After getting a few more hours of mostly restless sleep, the inhabitants of the Bristol cottage spent most of the day in silence, focusing on their own things and letting the others in the house have their privacy.
alone! You don’t have to do
“From what Ms. Brown’s parents told us, they had been on a date. They were shopping for gifts to take to the Patil twins’ birthday party this weekend,” Kingsley answered, looking deeply saddened. It was horrible that two people who were so young had paid the ultimate price for this war.
Harry sensed the dismissal, not to mention felt as though his parents wanted a little ‘alone time’ from their display when they had first walked in. He and Draco made off to Draco’s room to spend their own time together, after literally taking an oath to keep their displays of affection to snogging.
“I have no idea where Harry is, I swear! Please,
Draco had been ecstatic when he found out he was allowed to do magic since he was at school. Harry and Poppy both had to wrestle his wand from him one evening when the Slytherin had excitedly brandished his wand and set the curtains around his hospital bed on fire.
A nice hot cup of tea was perched close to his lips as he spread out the
“What was that all about?”
“The boy has absolutely no respect for anyone, including himself! He has done quite enough to Harry this past year; he does not need more stress on top of it all. Harry was actually ashamed, Remus, ashamed of who he is because of that damned boy’s actions!” Severus hissed, pacing back and forth in his and Remus’ bedroom. He had made sure Harry was alright after the initial fight, but his anger for the Weasley boy had not subsided at all.
“Of course I want you to come back every day, Harry,” Draco whispered, finally breaking the long, unnerving silence that had threatened to engulf them both. Draco pulled his knees closer to his chest, resting his chin on one knee and staring at Harry instead of the wall.
“Imperius, or possibly Polyjuice,” Clancy responded, his wand held tightly in his hand as he watched the seasoned Head Auror stop a filing assistant to hand off a file.
Harry made his way out of the hall at the same time as Draco, but he failed to notice Ron following him out into the Entrance Hall as well. Draco had stopped and turned to stare at him with his arms crossed over his chest. Just when Harry thought he and Draco were doing so well...
Harry took a deep breath, glancing over at Severus and receiving a questioning look from him. “I was wondering, sir, if there was a way to include Remus in the bonding spells. If Severus has to welcome me into his family as his son, then Remus should be included in that as well.”
listen to
“Because the Horcruxes are probably those items that he kept. But how do I know what he took and from where?” Harry asked, feeling his heart speed up at the idea of finding the elusive Horcruxes that much easier. He had thought it would be near impossible, but if he had clues, he could solve the puzzle.
“Nonsense. Draco has both of us as well, and he has you. We’ve given him
“Do you really think your dad can just change his mind about everything and join the Order?” Harry asked after a long silence in which he finished half his eggs and bacon.
“Er...can I talk to you, Severus? In private, please?” Draco asked quietly, a crimson blush colouring his cheeks and Severus gave a rather dramatic sigh and nodded, his expression unreadable.
Severus sighed as he stood up and followed Remus out of the infirmary, glancing back at Harry and then at the curtain enclosed bed where he knew Draco to be. He was obviously doing something wrong; both of his charges were in hospital, after all.
No sooner had Severus spoke than the floo flared to life, the Headmaster’s head floating amongst the green flames. “Harry, my boy! I was wondering if you’d be willing to come to my office for a spot of tea? I have something very important to discuss with you.”
There was a long silence in which they all simply got lost in thought. Harry was starting to feel a little apprehensive though, and thought to keep the conversation going.
“Harry! Calm down, love. I’ll make sure he’s taken care of, alright? Don’t worry about Remus. Round up this group and head on over to Headquarters; I’m sure Molly is dying to feed you all some breakfast.”
“Not long; it’s ten in the morning still. I have an errand I need to run, so if you wouldn’t mind keeping an eye on the boys?”
Severus had moved all around the class, circling desks, gliding down aisles, and generally making the entire class fidgety and uncomfortable as he drawled on with his lecture. He had gotten them right where he wanted them.
are the ones in charge.”
“Perhaps I’ll receive another son or a daughter for my birthday!” Remus exclaimed happily, sharing a toast with the rest of the table. They all continued to eat and chat loudly through pudding, but the table went unnaturally quiet as Ron stood shakily from his seat and called everyone’s attention t himself.
“This is your interstice, Harry, or the in-between. You’re neither here nor there. Quidditch offered you the most joy and freedom in your life, and so in order to gently carry you to the After Life, fate decided to carry you through here. However, you’ll not be making the full trip. There are some very important things I must tell you, but we must be quick. You’ll need to return soon.”
Getting all of their possessions ready for the move seemed to take much more time than they had anticipated. The boys had indeed begun packing the first day they had discussed the move, but their belongings had been so strewn about the castle that their packing had taken a few days alone. Even Severus and Remus seemed to have a harder time packing, now that their singular status had been changed to plural. Packing as a couple was one thing Severus had never anticipated being a challenge. That is, until he and Remus had an argument over whether or not to leave some things behind, or take their entire lives with them.
“We may have located another Horcrux. We’re not one hundred percent positive, but I have a very strong suspicion, and we need to find out if it’s really there or not so we know to keep looking elsewhere,” Harry explained, trying not to let the worried look his parents shared annoy him. He knew it was their job to worry.
Draco bristled, shaking off Harry’s arm as the Gryffindor gripped his shoulder. “You’re no better than him! What makes you think you could be a better father to Harry than Lucius was to me? I see no difference.” He knew the instant the words were out of his mouth that he should never have said it, or even thought it, but he couldn’t take it back now. He winced as Harry flinched away from him.
“Your loyalty is not in question, Draco. I knew what I was getting into, and I prepared myself for your ire. I love you too, Son. I just hope you understand what you’re getting yourself into. You’re essentially the Dark Lord’s second worst enemy, being Potter’s right-hand man,” Lucius pointed out.
“Professor, I had another question, but I couldn’t ask in front of everyone. What about my father? Where will he be staying?” Draco asked quietly, still a bit paranoid about anyone else hearing that his father was currently in the castle.
“Do I at least have part of your trust now, Mr. Weasley?” Lucius asked the dumbstruck young man.
Draco stood up and rounded on Harry angrily, his gray eyes flashing silver; a definite Malfoy danger sign. “So don’t lead him on and make him suspect you know anything! Swear to me, Harry! I swore to keep your secret, now you have to keep mine!”
“Dumbledore reminded me that the diary that possessed Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets was actually the first Horcrux I ever came across, I just never knew that’s what it was. In the Chamber, I used a fang from the Basilisk to stab the diary, ‘killing’ Tom Riddle and destroying the Horcrux. Unknowingly, I used one of the only things truly able to destroy a Horcrux; Basilisk venom.”
Since when were you good at potions, and since when did Snape reward his students for doing what they were told? What did you do to him this summer, Harry? It’s like he’s a completely different person! Do you realize in one double-period, Snape
A flash of red light streaked through the air, and Dumbledore came out of his reverie with not a second to spare, sending up a weak shield charm to counter the Dark Lord’s cutting curse. Blood spurt from his pale cheek as part of the curse hit its mark, and he used much of his strength not to stumble and fall.
The basement kitchen was quiet. All of the Order members had just left to get in position. Once the wards around the Little Hangleton graveyard were broken, the Order would be apparating in strategically. The strategy group had planned and re-planned, all with the help of Ron, whose exemplary chess skills made him a great asset to the staging of the battle. It wasn’t fool proof, but they would make it work.
Harry snorted as he turned a page in his book, throwing Tonks a bored glance. “Trust me, I know it.”
“I don’t understand. That was definitely my happiest memory.”
“Everyone in this room is here to learn how to duel properly and effectively, in accordance with Wizarding laws and duelling etiquette. This club is not an excuse to take your aggression out on your classmates, nor is it a joke. Learning to duel properly could save your life one day, and is not to be taken lightly. So, if any of you do not agree to adhere to my rules and Wizarding law regarding duelling, leave now and do not return. I reserve the right to kick any of you out at any given time as I see fit.”
The other members of the Order were already in position, having left in shifts two hours previously. They received the signal from Severus that everyone was in place a scant five minutes ago, and were walking through the barrier a brief time later.
“I’m just Harry, and I can’t tell you that. That’s something you’ll have to figure out on your own,” said Harry, feeling his chest ache as he selfishly wished Draco never remembered who Harry really was to him. He couldn’t stand to lose this now, and it had only just begun.
! It was Harry’s birthday party! Weren’t Ginny and Neville supposed to be keeping an eye on everyone, making sure nothing stupid happened? What were you all
“Anyways, I tried to convince him to try to talk to Dumbledore. If he wants revenge and doesn’t want to support Voldemort anymore, then he should support the people trying to defeat him. He said he’d think about it,” said Tonks.
“He’s right, you know. Our son is far more mature than we give him credit for.”
“So, when do we get to start duelling?” Draco asked as he, Harry, Severus and Remus made their way out of the Great Hall and towards the dungeons.
“Yes sirs, of course! Dobby will bring Master Harry some onion and cheese soup like Master Professor Snape likes when he is sick.”
Harry felt his throat tighten as he wrapped his arms around Ron and gave a shuddering laugh. “The same goes for you, mate. Watch over Hermione; keep her safe.”
Harry tightened his grip around Ron and allowed his friend to sob into his shoulder, feeling tears slide down his cheeks. He felt Ginny come up on one side, then Hermione on the other, then was encased in the centre of another tearful group hug. Harry was extremely sick of crying already, but he had a feeling he’d be doing a lot more in the near future.
“These archives go back to the eighteen hundreds, and Mr. Malfoy said that Burke went missing in the forties. We might be able to find an article on his disappearance along with the dates Voldemort went to Hogwarts. You and Draco can go through this stack,” Hermione hefted a huge stack of aged
“I will only be the leader in name, however. I am not Albus; I do not know how he managed to pull all of the strings that he did, so I am going to need help. Personally, I think we should split the Order up into separate groups based on the services we need,” Minerva said as she sipped her cup of tea at the head of the long kitchen table in the basement.
already; he was starting to lose faith. “But you’ve already checked all of the books he had warded and protected. I don’t know where else it could
“Well he of course thought of Remus, but with the Werewolf Regulation laws passed last year, the Ministry would never let him adopt a child. His only other option, or at least the only other one he told me about, was myself. He immediately assumed I would turn him down, however, but I’ve since set him straight about making such assumptions. His first choice was the both of you, but perhaps he has had a change of heart,” said Severus, frowning as he remembered Harry’s expression when he discovered his new wardrobe. Perhaps he had been subconsciously trying to win the boy over, but his intentions had been purely innocent.
“One time when the other boys were teasing me at lunch, I made my glass of milk explode. Brooks thought I just slammed it down too hard. And another time, it was really cold outside during playtime, and I wanted to warm up, so I rubbed my hands together, and it started a fire. I had some nasty blisters after that.”
Harry woke up at around three in the morning after having the dream, this time a little more vividly. It took him much longer to get his breathing under control and to get the sense of fear to leave him, and wasn’t surprised when his father came in, sat on the edge of his bed and handed him a calming draught.
“Yes, but as I said, it’s a little early for the little one to be causing spikes in my magic. I suppose I am doomed to baths for the duration of the pregnancy. Forgive me, Hermione, but I’ll probably need your help getting out the further along I get,” Aurora said with a slight grimace.
“I’ve got it!” Remus shouted as he stood and began to rush out of the room, belatedly remembering that he was at Hogwarts and could not apparate within the castle. He started rushing towards the entrance hall and the marble staircase that would take him towards the Head’s office to floo to St. Mungo’s when Harry caught up with him.
Minerva shared a look with Hestia before she turned her attention back to the imposter. “Why did Voldemort have you impersonate Dumbledore, but not kill him?”
“Harry…there are so many things I want to say to you, but I’m having a hard time finding the words. I know things have been very tense between us recently, and I could not bear to go into this battle with this hanging over us. I know this may not be the best time for a heart to heart, but – but I may not get another chance.”
Severus reeled, quite taken aback. He had almost forgotten the relationship between his husband and the late Animagus; how completely foolish of him. “I hadn’t even thought of that, Minerva. This is going to be harder than even I expected. Remus and I have also discussed things with Aurora, and she said she is not remiss to living with us so that we may be able to protect her and the baby and take care of them both during her pregnancy. I went from being a single man to having a family of six in less than a year…I can hardly believe it.”
The high backed chair felt as uncomfortable as if it had been made of ice and nails. Remus squirmed in his seat, wishing he could move closer, but stayed where he was, lest he get in the Healer’s way. After taking the protective charm off of Severus, the Healer’s had immediately began to clean the wounds with a combination of Muggle and Magical means, trying to clear out the infection enough so that the wounds could heal now that they had the counter-curse.
“Don’t say that, Dad. I’m sorry,” Harry whispered. He couldn’t imagine the pain his father must be in. He had had to regrow bones in the past, but regrowing his spine? Harry was sure that was excruciating.
Harry beamed at his father before turning around and heading straight for Draco’s personal quarters, already missing his boyfriend even though they had seen each other at lunch a few hours previous. He was afraid that he was being a tad too clingy, but after the last few days, he had reason to be clingy.
Macnair ducked just in time, and the strong ropes hit the wall with a dull thud before falling just beside the trembling teen, who shrieked as the ropes nearly hit her as well. Severus ducked as Macnair turned and started throwing spells. He was already exhausted from trying to keep the other Death Eaters at bay near Knockturn Alley, and his reaction time was starting to slip.
S~S~S~S
. Stay here with Remus, Harry. I don’t want you wondering around the castle with the wards tampered with like they are.”
“Lily and I had those bracelets made on our first ever trip to Hogsmeade in third year; they were friendship bracelets. She still wore it, even after our fight in fifth year?” Severus asked, his voice strained as he absently stroked his own bracelet, which had been hidden under a glamour for years now, but was always on his wrist.
“Ah, that woman was a laugh indeed. She meant well, I’m sure. Besides, I never really intended to hide it. If I’d been asked out right if I was a Lesbian, I would have just said yes. There seems to be something about Hogwarts and having quite a queer staff...”
Hermione just smiled and laughed along with everyone else, her butterbeer hardly touched as she stared at the wall, obviously lost in thought. Ron could see she was not really paying attention to anything, however. Her laugh was only half sincere and her smiles never reached her eyes. As Aurora and Remus exclaimed excitedly as the baby gave a kick, Hermione’s eyes became over-bright, and she stared down into her half-eaten lunch instead.
Draco let out a sigh of relief. The way Severus was building up to it, Draco was convinced that he’d have to cross a burning bridge carrying Potter on his shoulders or something. “That’s it? I bet you want me to teach him Legilimency afterwards, too.”
, right?”
Severus had not expected that, of all things, nor had he expected Harry to seek
Severus sighed as he leaned back against Remus’ chest, unable to stop the bubble of worry that threatened to make him wake the boys up and separate them immediately. “No harm done...yet.”
“We’re all here to help, Harry. I hope you know that you are never alone in this,
Severus let a slight blush slide as he averted his eyes a bit, not aware that that had been a dead giveaway. “Well, she was practically my only true friend after Lily did away with me. She saved me those last two and a half years.” Severus’ blush deepened as he realized what he had said. He cleared his throat and proceeded to pretend like he had not said anything. “We should see if Harry is at lunch, and if not, find him.”
“Oh, Harry. It’s beautiful; thank you,” Remus choked out, pulling the teen into another hug. He looked over the untidy black hair to Severus, who had cleared his throat and blinked quite rapidly in order to control his emotions. They locked eyes for a minute. Remus had never been so happy before in his life.
There was a robust laugh from the woman that made Harry feel warm inside for some reason. He couldn’t believe he was actually hearing this; his parents were really serious about having another child. Harry was getting a sibling!
It was already six o’clock in the morning, and Severus was tired. He figured with Harry dosed on Dreamless Sleep, he could rest for a few hours himself without worry. He pulled out his wand and transfigured the couch into a comfortable looking four-poster bed, then flicked the lights off. He slipped off his shoes and robes and crawled underneath the sheets, falling asleep almost immediately after his head hit the pillow.
, especially while insulting me in the process!”
Severus nodded as he looked into Harry’s eyes. He was reading the boy as they sat their, seeing his thoughts and feeling his emotions. He was very confused, apparently. “You once told Dumbledore that you could feel the Dark Lord’s emotions. How do you think that is?”
S~S~S~S
Neville grabbed his own bag and hopped agilely over the top of the Gryffindor table so that he could walk alongside Harry. McGonagall glared at him for it and he cowed slightly. “Sounds like it. Hopefully he’ll not be as bad in classes this year, but I won’t keep my fingers crossed. Ron’s just being a git, Harry. He’ll get over it soon, I’m sure.”
“Get away from me!” Harry snapped, trying to pull his wrist out of her firm grasp and searching his pockets with his other hand for his wand. It wasn’t there. He had expected that, but it didn’t make the shock and renewed panic any easier to handle.
Draco thought about it for a few seconds before nodding. “So I’d hold out my wand, handle towards you, and say...what, exactly?” Draco asked, not quite sure if there was anything specific he had to say to make the Oath work.
Ron cleared his throat as Hermione’s eyes began to shine with tears. “Hey, none of this pre-emptive goodbye shite. We’ll see you after that nasty snake is dead, ok?”
call me Moony again. I only let my friends and family refer to me as such.”
“The left.”
Draco chuckled as he played with Harry’s wild hair, amused with the way it sprang back up even after he flattened it out. “I think he’ll like whatever you get him, Harry, but no, it doesn’t have to be something to do with potions. He’s essentially your dad now. What would a son buy their father for Christmas?”
“Come on, we’ll have Madam Pomfrey firecall Healer Smithson,” Severus called over his shoulder as he carried Draco out into the corridor and back into his quarters. He walked quickly over to the hearth, motioning for Harry to throw some floo powder in.
Severus was unsurprised when he received an armful of teary Gryffindor, curling up at his side on the narrow hospital bed and burying his face in his hospital robes. He rubbed the boy’s back and held him close, listening as the hiccups grew softer, and the shaking subsided. Harry’s breathing was growing quite deep and even now, and Severus was sure the boy had fallen asleep, until he spoke.
Harry put on a fake smile for Tonks and nodded to reassure her. “Yeah, that sounds good. Be careful.”
S~S~S~S
safe. He quickly spun the dial, his hands shaking as he heard the loud click that told him he’d gained access. He pulled the lever and opened the door, reaching in and pulling out the slender black box that contained his great grandfather’s wand. There were a few extra wands in the house, but none of them worked as well for him as this one. Replacing the box, he pulled out the pouch of Galleons he kept in the house, just in case of an emergency. It was quite a bit of money, so he only took about two-thirds of the gold, leaving the pouch in the safe. He closed the heavy metal door and armed it once more, replacing the portrait over the opening in the wall.
Just as he was about to turn to leave the library to investigate more, something caught his eye by the foot of his favourite armchair. He knelt down and reached under, his hand closing over something small, cold and round. He held up his hand, palm up, and stared at the diamond and emerald ring. For a few seconds, the only sound he could hear was the blood rushing through his veins, his heart pounding as his anger and sorrow battled for dominance in his heart and mind. Then there was a horrible, heart wrenching sob and a howl of sheer pain as he closed his hand over the ring, squeezing so hard he could feel the little jewels draw blood from his palm.
“Merry Christmas, Son,” Severus whispered into Harry’s hair, earning himself a tighter hug and a mingled laugh-cry from the Gryffindor as the teen pulled slightly away, wiping at his blotchy face embarrassedly.
Harry nearly stumbled back as lights suddenly flared into life, illuminating a small group of people. He saw a table laden with snacks, butterbeer and firewhiskey and instantly began to protest.
Ron had found together.
The Great Hall stayed deathly silent as all of the staff and students looked down mournfully at the tables, or looked around with wide, shocked eyes at their friends in silent surprise. After what felt like a year, Dumbledore clapped his hands loudly, making them all jump, and dismissed them.
S~S~S~S
“I think that is a great idea, Minerva. If we do things carefully, we might be able to set up some sort of network for those students who may need our help, so that when the time comes, we can bring them to Hogwarts and keep them safe. A Youth Protection Programme is a great idea,” Madam Pomfrey said from her seat near the opposite end of the table from the Headmistress.
A flash of lightning marked the loud rumble of thunder that rolled through the quiet house. The jagged outline of the bolt of electricity could be seen out the thin, green curtains hanging in a small window. With another loud clap of thunder and flash of light, heavy rain began to fall, making the little bit of visible glass opaque.
Severus glared and gave Harry a prod in the back to keep him moving, not wanting to linger too long on the high streets. “It’s for your own protection, idiot child, and you’re not told precisely because of that abysmal attitude you’re so fond of having. If you weren’t so insolent maybe Dumbledore would be more willing to divulge such information – ”
“I never thought of that,” Harry said thoughtfully, wondering if perhaps that was a getting a bit
Draco looked chagrined as he nodded, waiting for Severus’ nod before leaving the hospital wing, not sparing a glance for Harry or Remus. The door closed a bit harder than necessary behind him, making Harry jump. He felt a hand descend on his shoulder as he stared at the closed door, willing Draco to come back and tell him he wanted Harry to go with him, to be with him and help him through this.
“Hmm, something must be throwing the spell off; possibly wards. It’s definitely in here,” Remus said with a frown, the slimy feeling of dark magic seeping over his skin.
Unless the Dark Lord had taken over the Manor and done away with his possessions, Lucius knew those old books were still in the library at Malfoy Manor, and though he could not recall specifically ever reading about how to destroy Horcruxes, he thought that the books may be helpful in some way.
He wondered vaguely why Snape was out here, curled uncomfortably – or so it looked – in an armchair when he could be sleeping in his own bed. Harry’s first thought was that the man was watching over Draco as the Slytherin slept, but then he realized that Snape’s body was turned towards his bed, not Draco’s. It sent a surprisingly strong warm feeling through his veins at the thought of the Potions Professor watching guardian over him as he slept. He felt safe for the first time in a long time.
Harry nodded quickly and took off down the hall without a backward glance. A few floors down, students began to trickle out of the classrooms as the bell for dinner rang. People stopped and watched Harry fly by, or else jumped out of the way as he pushed through the hungry throng of students. He hoped Snape was either in the Great Hall, or en route; the dungeons were really quite a far walk.
“Enough of that for now; we should be celebrating! Now all that’s left are the interviews, which I’m sure you’ll both be fine with. Severus has always had a special way with words,” Remus said with a smirk, causing Harry to chuckle as the Potions Master scowled.
So I know it’s been a ridiculously, inexcusably long time, and I’m sorry. I won’t bore you with the details, but let’s just say adulating really really sucks. I started writing this story when I was 18. I am now 25. I have had a lot of growing up to do in the last 6 years, and that unfortunately did not leave enough time for my true passion; writing. I lied, this is not the last chapter. There will be at least one more, and an epilogue, or I might combine the last chapter and the epilogue into one. I’m not sure yet. You’ve waited long enough, so without further ado…
“Harry! Oh, thank Merlin.”
Tonks shook her head firmly, changing her hair from bubblegum pink to a white-blonde that matched Draco’s perfectly. “He said he wanted revenge, yes, but he told me that he did not intend to kill them. He did say that...well, he wasn’t quite sure where he stood anymore. If losing his family was the price for supporting Voldemort, he wasn’t sure he was going to continue that line of thinking. However, he wasn’t exactly ready to get buddy-buddy with Dumbledore and the Order either. He said he wanted to talk to Draco before he made any decisions, but he didn’t state any specific plans. The night after he told me that, I woke up in the Atrium of the Ministry.”
“And why, pray tell, did you agree to have the memory removed in the first place? That is a very delicate thing to trust to just anyone.”
“Er, I’ll just go start on my homework, then,” he said awkwardly as he trouped down the hall to his bedroom and quickly ensconced himself at his desk, setting out the things he needed to finish up on a few essays set earlier in the week.
Harry could see that a large portion of the land had been fenced off with short, white picket fences. The snow couldn’t touch the ground there, as if it had been charmed. As they got closer, it was clear that they were looking at a garden, although Harry only saw two different types of flowers. He looked over at Draco, his expression questioning.
“Because it makes sense. Like Dumbledore said, he considered Hogwarts to be a home to him, far more than anywhere else. Not only that, but because the ruby is connected to Gryffindor, which makes it also true that he’d want to hide it within the castle. He even had the opportunity to do it when he came back to ask for a job the second time.”
“We’ll see you in the common room, Harry. We’ve got to help monitor the new Prefects and do patrols until everyone makes it to their common rooms,” Hermione said as she stood and started to pull Ron along by the hand.
“You’re right, Potter, masking emotions and suppressing them are two very different things. However, the difference between needing to protect
“Yes, it was definitely him.”
“I was thinking Potions, since we have a test on Thursday, and I could use some help with the review,” Harry said, slightly distracted by the way Draco kept nibbling on a sensitive spot on his neck.
S~S~S~S
The Healers began to prepare Severus to go through the floo, casting a protective bubble around the cot as they levitated it. Remus stood and began to follow, turning around as Harry struggled to stand and follow as well.
“She may have, yes. Harry and I are looking through it now. Perhaps you could help Harry try to understand this; he’s about ready to throw a massive temper tantrum.”
Dumbledore told Tom how to get to the Leaky Cauldron, and also to ask Tom, the barkeep, to help him pass through the barrier into Diagon Alley. Young Tom looked quite annoyed that the barkeep shared his name, and it was the now-Headmaster’s first glimpse into his self-importance. Once he was about to leave, Tom stood up and grabbed his wrist.
“I felt the same exact way. I wasn’t thinking about reactions; I was thinking about making sure we were the winning side. Maybe I am selfish. I just want my family back, without the suspicion and anger. I want
Severus sighed as he wiped a hand over his tired eyes, blinking the moisture the smoke had caused back. “It could potentially hurt any one of us. It’s powerful and dangerous, and in the wrong hands could be deadly for all of us, the Wizarding world at large.”
“I’m so sorry, Harry. I was so caught up in making sure that Severus was taken care of that I forgot I had promised to keep you informed.”
“You’ve no idea. Ok, you might want to step back a little. The sink is going to move around and a hole will open up into a tunnel. Here goes nothing.
“Thank you all for being here for the start of term staff meeting. It’s the usual business most of you hear every year, but we have a new staff member this year.” Dumbledore gestured to Remus, who nodded in recognition.
“Draco! Thank Merlin, I didn’t know if this would work or not. You’ve been in a coma for nearly three months, Draco. The only way we’ve found so far to pull you out of it is just so; to literally pull you out of it, through your mind. There’s not enough time to explain it all now, but I promise I will when you wake up, alright?” Harry said gently, hardly noticing when the horrible memory that he’d latched on to faded away.
The four students stood together in the corridor, still too much in shock to make much intelligent conversation. Hermione was fussing over Ron, and Harry was clutching Draco close to him as the blonde looked blankly at the destroyed wall.
Harry stood up and walked slowly over to Draco, not saying a word as he slipped his arms around him and pulled Draco close, resting his head on his shoulder. “Why does everyone I love die?” Harry whispered, causing Draco’s throat to constrict as he held the Gryffindor close. He knew he was the only one who heard Harry whisper, so he didn’t respond out of respect.
Just before the bell was due to ring for the first class of the day, Dumbledore stood up from his seat, affectively silencing the Great Hall. He raised his arms with a warm smile, brushing the Potions Master’s shoulder, as if motioning for the man to stand up. Harry watched as his father rolled his eyes and stood beside the Headmaster, looking very disapproving of the fanfare.
“What about some of the other Order members like Kingsley or Emmeline? Hell, what about Tonks?”
“Look, I’m sorry for snapping at you the other night. Everyone was pretty stressed and tense, and things were said that none of us probably meant. I know you were only defending your father, but I was defending mine as well. It’s definitely something I’ve not had very much experience with, but when I heard you insulting Severus like that, I felt like I
“Actually, Draco and I were wondering if we could go to Hogsmeade to do some holiday shopping. Neither of us has had the chance to do any yet,” Harry said in a hopeful voice, putting on his best innocent expression.
Remus blinked a few times in shock before a smile spread slowly across his face. He nodded as he looked around at the small window and noticed the steadily darkening sky. “Yeah, you don’t want to see what comes next. You’re sleeping in there with the boys, right?” He waited for Severus to nod before leaning forward and stealing another quick kiss. “Ward and silence the room behind you. I don’t want to take any chances.”
Hermione looked like she wanted to say something, but she refrained and turned to her dinner and her newly arrived
Since the warding spells that had been performed between Severus and Harry would not go into full effect until the bonding occurred, the Joining of the Souls ceremony had to be performed quite quickly and on the fly. Since Severus was a very private man as it was, and privacy and secrecy were essential to survival, the ceremony was not made into a huge affair as it had been when Remus had performed the same with Sirius. It would be a quiet, private ceremony with very few people there to witness it.
“Simply that you help guide Harry through these tough times, and that you’ll always be there for him when he is in need. Something else I might suggest is giving him a sense of stability while protecting him. How would you feel about allowing Harry to live in your quarters here at the school with you? You can protect him better that way, and your relationship can grow stronger with constant contact. What Harry needs is a father, Severus, and you can be that for him.”
Hermione had snuck quietly into the drawing room, reluctant to bother Harry when she knew he was upset. She had been doing research on Tom Riddle’s life, trying to discern what else the mad man may have turned into a Horcrux when she came across a picture of an old orphanage. She looked through her notes from when Harry had explained his forays into the pensieve with Dumbledore and, searching through old
“That was different! Snape already knew about the Prophecy and that it puts me in grave danger! This, though…Draco, what that man did to you was
of Healer Smithson,” Remus drawled, trying to bait the uneasily baited man.
Severus, however, was too busy studying the golden ring that caused the panic. He used his wand to make it levitate before him as he walked around it in a wide circle, examining the badly made jewellery. “Goblin made, I’d say around the twelfth or thirteenth century. The stone is not a precious one, and it’s been cracked right down the centre. That’s a curious design etched on there...It reminds me of something, no idea what,” Severus continued to make observations about the ring, trying to gain as much knowledge from the thing as possible.
Draco snorted into his cup of juice, managing to spray both Harry and Remus as he laughed raucously. He wiped his tears of mirth away as he tried to mop up the mess he made with a couple of napkins. “I’m s–sorry; I just think that Severus is a r–real asset to your c–current positions.” This started a whole new round of guffawing as Draco slumped over the table, enjoying the onslaught of unintentional innuendos.
Harry stood up quickly and made his way out of the dungeon quarters, feeling the tears well up behind his eyes. He didn’t want to have to explain what had happened to Draco, so he decided it would be better if he just spent some time alone instead.
“Dora, we need to weaken him just long enough to get one curse off. If I can weaken him, will you curse him?”
There was a long silence as Ron looked anywhere but at Harry or Draco, obviously stalling for time to decide what to say. He looked extremely uncomfortable, and Harry couldn’t help but think that he deserved all the discomfort.
“Well, based on the information we already know, the Horcruxes that we know Voldemort has made and where he hid them, I came up with other possible Horcruxes and where they could be. Dumbledore said that Voldemort was fond of keeping mementos from the things he did, like the toys he stole from the other children at the orphanage. From the memories Dumbledore showed you, I think it’s safe to say that the ruby stolen from the sword of Gryffindor is a Horcrux. Now, where it might be, I’m not sure. We need to think of significant things he’s done, people he’s killed. Whose death did he use for the ruby?”
, Severus!
Dumbledore sighed and nodded gently. “If that would be more amendable to the situation, then I am not opposed to the three of you returning to Hogwarts a bit early. Harry might be a bit upset about not riding the train with his friends, but I think I can talk him into it, if I must.”
“How the hell does this madman expect to get all of this done?” Tonks asked from near the end of the table, where Charlie Weasley was sitting almost indecently close to her and holding her hand tightly in his own.
“Did he intimidate you, sir? He seemed extremely brazen for an eleven-year-old, especially after admitting to his powers. You seemed unnerved. Did you know then?” asked Harry, still quite shaken up about their similar appearances. That he could share something so intimate as his appearance with Voldemort felt like a horrible violation.
Remus was still trying to heal Harry’s nose and clean up the blood, but Harry pushed him away. He moved towards the window seat and curled up on the padded edge, his knees pulled up to his chin. He stared out at the overgrown backyard as tears streamed silently down his cheeks.
“This is where the speculation and guesswork comes in. The Dark Lord did not give me any details as to what his research had provided him, and the Order’s own research brought up a frightening possibility; with your blood running in the Dark Lord’s veins, your mother’s blood-sacrifice may be null and void. As soon as we discovered this, we worked to ward your home with spells instead of just letting the ancient magic your mother had placed there protect you alone. Apparently our efforts were in vain, for the Dark Lord’s followers were able to break through these to get to you. A sort of alarm notified the Order that the wards had been broken, however, and when the Death Eaters realized this, they fled without completing their mission. The force of their spells to break the wards was what caused the explosion to occur, and a massive one it was at that,” Severus said the last part a little quietly as he remembered the state he had found the house in when he first Apparated to Harry.
“I’ve been learning Occlumency from Snape; paranoia is second nature. He’s pulled that one so many times, it was pretty predictable. I used a weak shield at first, but as soon as I saw you turn with your wand up, I strengthened it,” Harry explained, feeling slightly accomplished already. “So how do I maintain that weak shield? I usually have to concentrate for quite a bit to keep the shield up for long periods of time. It’s distracting, really.”
Minerva ignored the interruption with a good-natured glare at the Professor before her. “The Order have expressed concerns about where your family will be staying this summer. Your cottage was unfortunately destroyed, so you cannot return there, and I know you would prefer not to return to Spinner’s End unless absolutely necessary. Have you given this any thought, Severus?”
Remus entered the kitchen just as Severus was tucking into a plate of kippers and eggs. He looked refreshed and relaxed as he sat down across from the Potions Professor. He poured himself some coffee and stirred in a bit of cream and sugar before taking a careful sip.
“Moony! Be careful,” Harry said, giving Remus a tight hug before watching him walk away. He was torn, but he knew if he stayed, everyone would want a piece of his hide for not following orders, and he needed to get the Horcrux some place safe. Sending his hopeful thoughts out to every member of the Order involved, Harry turned on the spot and apparated to the square outside of Grimmauld Place.
Severus moved quickly to his son’s side and knelt down beside him, wrapping an arm around his shoulders as the young Gryffindor leaned against him and dissolved into tears. He brushed Harry’s hair back and placed a kiss on the teen’s forehead as he felt tears burn in the back of his own eyes. No one person should have to feel so much pain.
I feel unclean now,” Draco said with a shudder as they entered their room.
Hermione too was gripping her wand, as was everyone else. A wand was a very personal thing, very specific to each witch or wizard it belonged to as well. “I don’t think that would work. Whoever he switched wands with would have to have nearly the same magical strengths as Harry in order for it to work for him at all. Wands aren’t just interchangeable like that. The wand chooses the wizard, remember?”
Harry sat bolt upright, nearly smacking his forehead into Tonks’. He looked around and noticed his vision was bleary; Tonks must have removed his glasses. “Is there any news of Snape?” Harry asked in a slurred voice. He wasn’t sure how long he had been asleep, but the sun was shining faintly through the curtains across the room.
Ten minutes later, Tonks was spinning through the green flames and stepping out of the floo, her wand raised and ready for a fight. She looked around and spotted Harry, sitting on Snape’s bed and staring at the fireplace she had just stepped out of.
Harry was still curious and suspicious, but he did what he was told anyways. Five minutes later, Severus, Lucius, Harry, and Draco came back into the library. The Potions Master was the last one in, and he turned to place what seemed like an excessive amount of locking and warding spells on the door, including silencing spells.
Harry looked up and stared straight into Snape’s eyes, his own eyes looking haunted. “I don’t ask for things I know I won’t get, Professor.”
Severus chuckled and pulled his husband close for a deep kiss. It had been awhile since they had truly any time to spend alone with just the two of them. After Remus’ close brush with death, Severus was feeling a pressing need to solidify their relationship, to make sure the man was fully and truly there. “My poor, naïve little werewolf. Think of all the things you did when you were sixteen, then rethink that thought.”
Hermione smacked her forehead, looking crestfallen and angry. “I should have known that! Why didn’t I think of that?”
“You’ve never heard the Tale of the Three Brothers, Harry?” Ron asked, surprising Hermione by knowing something she obviously didn’t. When he received blank looks he sighed traumatically and walked over to one of the shelves of books, pulling out a small book that looked well worn.
“The last of the potion is in, looks like everything has dissolved properly. We’ll get in position. Good luck,” Hermione whispered as she grabbed hold of Ron’s held out hand and they both apparated to their pre-planned destination on the edge of where the wards used to be, ready to meet with Fred and George to start creating diversions and set traps to keep most of the battle away from Harry and Sirius.
“Thank you.”
The graveyard was quiet, except for the usual night time sounds of crickets and owls in the distance. The wind had a slight chill to it, but the Headmaster paid it no heed. He was here for a specific purpose; to remove and try to destroy one of Voldemort’s ever dwindling Horcruxes.
“I – I’m not sure. Yes, I’ve been there, but it’s only ever been Borgin in there when I went. As far as I know, Burke is dead and has been for a while, but I can’t confirm that.”
“Why does everyone around me have to
Draco was levitating his pillow and directing it to float across the room, summoning it back to him as he let it drop to the bed opposite his. He chuckled as he made the pillow do a kind of complicated flip in the air as he summoned it to himself. Being able to do magic was exciting and liberating, and Harry had been right; it got easier the more he learned.
Harry could not agree with that statement more. He moved forward somewhat excitedly as Dumbledore pulled his pensieve out and sat it on the desk between them, a vial with swirling silver mist lying beside it. He tipped the opened vial into the swirling, ethereal light in the pensieve, and beckoned Harry closer.
don’t! And it’s not because he’s my dad, or because somebody helped me; I did it
Severus chuckled at the horrified expression on his son’s face, relishing the fact that he was doing something all parents eventually did. In an odd way, it made him feel closer to his son. “I don’t think you are stupid, but whether you believe you need the talk or not, you’re getting it. I’ll give you some time to prepare and warn Draco, but there is no avoiding it, Harry, so don’t even try.”
Harry tried hard not to talk about himself as if he would not be there to help with the research for destroying the Horcruxes. Before Severus could respond, Remus joined them, sending his husband a questioning look.
“I will never get tired of kissing you,” Draco whispered, smiling against Harry’s lips as they were pressed against his once more.
“Uh huh, but I knew him when I was still alive, long ago. He was a Slytherin Prefect, two years ahead of me in school. Very quiet boy, never really got into too much trouble. One time, he gave Olive detention for making fun of me. But...”
“Oh no you don’t, Severus Snape! What on earth have you been hiding, why did you go to Hogwarts, what the hell is in your hand?” Remus demanded as he stepped forward, his wand clenched in his fist. The tension had finally snapped and the heat of Remus’ anger was almost too much to bear.
, we’ll call it, during your third year regarding changes in lesson plans and homework assignments. This year, however, Professor Snape has agreed to stick to my lesson plans and homework, so there should not be any confusion. I fully expect you all to respect Professor Snape and to do the assignments he assigns while he is covering for me, as they’re technically my own assignments. Anyone who decides they want to disrespect Professor Snape gets whatever punishment he feels you deserve; I will not revoke the punishments he gives out, so be careful what you say. Now, onto today’s lesson; Lycanthropy and Vampirism: comparing and contrasting societal values regarding these creatures, and debunking the numerous myths that have attached themselves over the years…”
Draco rolled his eyes, but nodded his agreement not to curse his father, though that was what he had been most looking forward to. However, he knew it wouldn’t solve anything, and would only make things worse, if anything. If he wanted to be treated like an adult, then he must act like one. He set off towards his father’s private room once more, formulating his argument as he went.
The Transfiguration Professor was hard put not to grudgingly offer Draco a slight smile and a nod of approval. Perhaps the boy had worked harder than she thought. “Ten points to Slytherin. Can anyone tell me the correct spell to use when trying to change an animal from one species to another?”
Draco looked towards Snape, hoping this man would be able to tell him what was happening. “What’s going on?”
Remus smiled, grasping Severus’ hand and holding it tight. He looked over at Harry, who had seemingly fallen asleep in an awkward position in Severus’ favourite armchair, wrapped in Severus too-large cloak, after finishing his soup. He looked so young when he slept that it was hard to believe there was less than a year until Harry would be of age, and a man himself.
At the end of class, Harry couldn’t believe he had actually turned in a vial of his potion, and received a passing grade for it. He bounded down the hall, pulling Draco by the hand, smiling so wide his cheeks hurt.
. I worked on it all day and the quill only twitched a bit. Learning magic is hard,” Draco whined in a way the sixteen-year-old Draco would have despised.
“Help! He’s dying!” Remus shouted. Three Healers ran up and started to remove Severus’ torn robes and clothing. The wounds were gaping slashes all across his body, bone and organs visible in some place. Draco wretched as Harry tore into the room, and promptly began screaming at the sight of his father.
Remus chuckled as he performed a freshening charm, but the stench seemed to permeate his very skin. His sensitive nose wrinkled in distaste, but he was used to being assaulted by strong smells he was not a fan of. Such is the life of a werewolf.
still a Gryffindor you know, I can be in here whenever I want,” he teased, one of his eyebrows shooting up in an uncanny resemblance to the Potions Master’s.
“Yes, we’ll be at lunch. Just leave Draco to his thoughts for a while, though. He needs time to sort all of it out. I know it’s not easy for you either, Harry, but some things are just better done alone. Understand?”
“We need to get word to Dedalus down in the Department of Mysteries as soon as possible. Tonks, send a Patronus to Emmeline. She should have clearance to get down there,” Kingsley instructed as he waved his wand apologetically at Laurel, erasing the last fifteen minutes from her memory.
to. I couldn’t possibly live with myself if I didn’t say goodbye one last time,” he said quietly, eyeing all of their wands nervously as they seemed to surround him.
Draco chuckled as he sat down on the couch, reaching over and closing the Occlumency book. He figured they were done for the day, as they both had massive headaches and could use a break. They had made much progress already though, at least in the way Harry actually understood what he was supposed to do; now he just needed to figure out
Other than Harry’s rather blatant admission of knowing about his relationship with Remus in the library nearly a month ago, Severus had not deigned to discuss his love life with the boy, nor had he had the desire to discuss Harry’s own. That is, until it became obvious to Severus that the boy clearly had it in spades for his godson.
Severus smiled as he wrapped his arm around Draco in a one-armed hug, pulling the blonde close to him. “The wand is yours to keep, Draco. I wouldn’t dream of asking for it back, though I appreciate that you’ll take good care of it. Now, go use your new wand to make lunch,” Severus said with an affectionate chuckle and a ruffle of Draco’s hair.
Dumbledore gave Harry a knowing look and smiled. “Indeed he did, but he never saw fit to release that information until I asked him for that memory. Perhaps he saw more in the boy than anyone else did, and never considered the consequences of Tom’s thievery.”
Harry and Draco were both packed and ready to go. Harry was excited to finally get to go camping, considering the Dursleys had never taken him along on their trips before. Draco, on the other hand, had a long list of complaints. When Harry described to him what camping would be like
“Sure, let me see yours,” Harry said as he handed his time-table over to the bushy-haired witch. He took Hermione’s offered one and nearly choked on his breakfast. “Geez Hermione! Are you going to need another Time-Turner this year?” Hermione was taking far more subjects than he was, and she was a Prefect to boot.
Tonks frowned and grasped Harry’s shoulder gently. Her vibrant blue eyes turned slate grey and Harry felt his heart skip a beat. She looked so much like Sirius. The Black genes were strong, it seemed. “I did see him, Harry. He’s asleep because the Healers put him in a magical coma to help his body cope, but…he doesn’t look good, Harry, but that doesn’t mean anything. They can’t close his wounds because they’re cursed, and they have a protective force around him to keep any contamination away from his wounds, but…I don’t think you’d want to see him like this, Harry. You don’t want that to be your last memory of him if it comes to that.”
Severus sighed as they stopped in front of Harry’s bedroom door. He wanted to make sure he told everyone together, as he had no desire to explain it all once more. He had already told Remus about it when he first learned of the Hallows, but the man was either playing dumb, or didn’t realize why Severus had asked Harry to fetch his cloak.
, do you understand?” Severus said firmly, feeling the panic rise in his chest. He needed to get to his godson, but he also had to make sure Harry stayed where he could be watched and protected.
“How the hell do you know anything has been achieved if you won’t let me check?”
being here again.
And that was when Severus lost the last of his iron-clad control over his emotions. He looked over at Remus, who was looking the worse for wear as his bloodshot and streaming eyes met Severus’. The Potions Master gestured for the werewolf to move closer, and a sort of group hug was initiated.
Severus sighed and shook his head in exasperation. He had already formulated a slightly altered answer for this question when he was fetching the many potions. Why he was so concerned about the boy’s feelings, however, was lost on him. “It is the full moon tonight, Potter. Or it was, since the sun is rising as we speak. On the night of every full moon, Lupin brings the device to me so that I may be able to help you if you activate it; a good thing, too, seeing as how it just happened to be the full moon when you needed help. Lupin will be informed shortly about the happenings. I alone came to your aide, and brought you here after informing the Order that you were alright, then had an emergency meeting with everyone while you were still unconscious.”
“I’m sorry for what I said the other night. I know how much Severus has sacrificed for me, and it was very selfish of me to accuse him of being a bad father. He’s been more of a father to me than my biological father, and I do appreciate everything he’s done for me.”
“Father?”
“Remus!” Harry shouted as he threw his potions book and jumped off the sofa. He almost knocked Remus over with the force of his hug, grasping the man’s robes as if his life depended on it.
“I’m not going anywhere. I don’t care if you ground me for life; I’m staying with Draco tonight,” Harry snapped, turning back towards Draco and reaching for the blonde’s hand.
Draco nodded as he tiredly rubbed the sleep from his eyes. He did remember his dream, but he wasn’t sure if he was willing to divulge exactly what the dream was about. He had been reliving the scene every night since...well, since he had escaped his Aunt Bella’s clutches. No matter what he did, he saw his mother die over and over again, the warm blood spraying across his face, the taste of iron on his tongue as he screamed in horror. Draco turned his gaze from Snape and his eyes landed on bright green ones, which also held the strange emotion of worry. “Yes, unfortunately.”
Severus shared a looked with his husband, both of them in agreement that Hermione was right – they had no other leads and nothing to lose by investigating this one. If they did find another Horcrux, this would be the last one, which meant they could focus on removing the Horcrux from Harry and destroying the rest of them. It was better than nothing.
“You are both very right, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy. I wish there was more I could do directly for my students, but the only thing I can do is open up Hogwarts as a sort of half-way house to those who need it and provide them as much protection as Hogwarts can offer,” Minerva said with a worried glance at the few of her students seated at the table now. There were so many out there in danger, and she wished she could protect them all.
“I think the people you should apologize to are Harry and your significant other, who was disrespectfully treated like some dirty little secret. Just out of pure curiosity because of such dramatic circumstances, who on earth could you be associated with that would put the adoption in such jeopardy?” Adeline asked, almost afraid of the answer she would receive.
A week later and they were no closer to finding the answers to what these ‘dreams’ of Harry’s were, or how and why they started. Severus had done plenty of research, but yet it was fruitless. All things led to the same conclusion; the dream was not technically a dream. If that were the case, then it had to be a vision, but that didn’t make sense either. If Harry was seeing another false memory, that had to mean that Voldemort had somehow broken through his Occlumency shields. But that didn’t seem likely either, as Harry’s scar never twinged one bit.
The cloying smell of antibacterial soap, cleaning charms, and antiseptic filled the air. Harry took a minute to take in the sounds and smells around him, and had no doubt that he was in some sort of hospital wing. As he slowly opened his eyes, he heard a quick rustling and felt someone grab his hand.
Harry didn’t know what to do other than hug her back, rubbing her back soothingly. He looked to his left and saw Fred and George leaning against one another, obviously gaining comfort from their twin. Bill and Charlie were greeting other guests, and of course, Percy was not there. Harry felt more saddened than ever by that fact.
“Dad said you can come study with me, even though I’m supposed to be grounded.”
Harry shook his head, his breath coming in sharp gasps. “Don’t go up there, Professor! Something isn’t right with Dumbledore, I need to get to Severus right away,” said Harry in a quick whisper. There was no one out in the hall, but Merlin only knew what kind of spells could be around them, tracking them and listening to them.
Neville looked particularly relieved as he took his schedule back and handed Harry his back as well. “That’s great, thanks Harry. Ron was being awfully rude last night. He even made a first year cry because she was standing in front of the wrong staircase looking confused, the poor thing. Hermione was right livid with him and he stomped up to bed ranting and raving away how you were betraying everyone. What’s he on about, mate? I heard you guys fighting last night after dinner, but I didn’t exactly linger to find out why,” Neville asked, peeling a banana and taking a bite out of the fruit.
“Yeah, if I never cry again it will be too soon,” Harry said with a dramatic sigh, earning himself a soft chuckle from Severus and a smile from Remus. As they joined the few others still lingering in the Great Hall, Tonks bounded up to offer her congratulations.
“It’s alright, Minister,” Laurel said in a quiet voice as she accepted the cup of tea that appeared on the desk before her.
The Slytherin turned to look at Snape and sighed in relief, pushing himself into a more dignified sitting position as he rearranged the sheets around him. “Severus, what’s going on? Why am I in the hospital wing?”
Neville scooted into the seat Hermione had just vacated, dragging his plate across the table with him. “Hey, Harry. I heard you had a pretty crazy summer. Ron certainly had a lot to say about it,” Neville said under his breath, avoiding looking over in Ron’s direction.
“The Headmaster would not hold it against you, Harry. I’m sure even without an apology, he knew things said in anger are most often not true.”
The grouchy barn owl was sitting atop a wardrobe placed against a wall to hold the staff’s coats and robes while they relaxed, blinking in an irritated way as it restlessly ruffled it’s feathers. Severus gave a short whistle and beckoned the owl down, holding out his arm for the bird of prey. He carefully untied the thick scroll from the leg of the owl, giving it a few pets down it’s back before heading towards the open window and allowing the few seconds of pressure as the owl took flight.
“The cores...the twin cores of yours and Harry’s wands. I was researching the phenomenon that happened here just two years ago. The magic...the magic leaves echoes, residue. I’m here for Harry,” Dumbledore explained in a croak, feeling a sense of peace wash over him already as Voldemort gave a bark of laughter that told of early victory.
Remus looked up from his breakfast at Severus’ expletive, shocked by the man’s uncharacteristic cursing. He leaned over to look at the front page, and shouted his own colourful expletive.
“Get.
Hermione gasped and dropped Ron’s hand as she stood up and began to pace. “Harry, that is
Just then, the kitchen door swung open slowly and Harry stepped in, his shoulders slumped and his head hung in what appeared to be shame. He had tried to sleep for the past five hours or so, but regretful thoughts, replaying memories, and deep shame marred any rest he might have gotten. He didn’t dare look up, afraid to meet Snape’s gaze.
Harry stood up from the bed, stretching high above his head as he headed towards the door. Though he seemed stoic and calm, his stomach was a rolling mess and he was full of panic. He needed to be alone just then, before he cursed Tonks just for something to vent his frustration on.
Remus chuckled as he accepted the gift and carefully tore away the paper. A small wooden chest was revealed, made of fine smelling cedar. A saying had been burned into the wood, a saying that Remus would never expect to show up on anything Severus ever gifted to him.
“No, I do not plan on killing anyone tonight, or contributing to anyone’s murder, either. What I want is to see my son, and I know that you, of all people, would be able to take me to him.”
“Yes, the quidditch pitch. I wondered where you’d end up, but now it seems perfectly predictable,” Albus said with a little chuckle as he fondly surveyed the goal posts on either end of the pitch and the wide expanse of emerald green far below them.
Harry lifted his head very slowly, his expression distraught. “I don’t think it was a nightmare, Professor…I was in His mind again…H-he just….” Harry’s voice cracked as he tried to catch his breath.
Remus winced and shuddered, causing his husband to laugh openly, which made him feel warm and secure. “Now I’m very glad my da’ gave me the talk, even though he was about six months too late.”
“Dad!
Harry stopped breathing. His heart stopped beating. His world fell apart; the sky was falling, up was down and left was right. Everything Harry had ever known suddenly exploded into billions of pieces as every cataclysmic event Harry had ever feared amassed into one and royally fucked his world up. He looked up at his parents, who were wearing similar horrified expressions, and uttered the words that would haunt his dreams for a long time to come.
The floo roared to life just then, the Headmaster’s face appearing in the green flames. He looked worn out, but determined. “The interrogation is over. As I promised, Severus, you may come watch it in the Pensive at your convenience. I will tell you now, however, that I believe Lucius Malfoy to be sincere in his concerns and decisions to leave Voldemort’s service. He still has a few qualms about blood-status, but has agreed to help with whatever he can regarding the Order. There will be an Order meeting later tonight. For now, we both need our rest. The Pensieve is ready on the desk for you.”
“Oh come now, you’re still fairly young for a witch, Minerva. I’m sure you’ll still be here to see my unborn child go through school as well.”
“You look exhausted, Dad.”
Severus let out a long breath and nodded reluctantly, already missing the warmth of Remus’ calloused hand on his shoulder and his warmth beside him. He had the strongest urge to reach out his hand and pull Remus back to him. Without really thinking about the consequences, he followed the urge and grabbed Remus’ hand before he could walk away. “Remus...Stay, please,” Severus whispered, hating how pathetic he sounded. He’d never allowed anyone else to see him so weak before.
“What prompted this disagreement anyways?” Severus asked, realizing his son had failed to elaborate on that part of the story. He knew he had hit a sore spot when Harry tried to avoid his eyes. “Harry…”
injure my mind. I will be absolutely no good to you as a drooling invalid.”
Harry shrugged as he rubbed at his eyes some more. “My head hurts a bit, and I’m kind of hungry.”
With one last lingering glare that held just the right amount of hurt, anger, and pity, Severus followed Remus, letting the werewolf’s words sink in. The final blow for Draco was when Harry frowned at him and shuffled off to his own room, closing the door firmly behind him.
had the sense to fill me in on that. Severus never once mentioned it, nor did any of the Occlumency books Snape has.”
!” Harry shouted at the top of his lungs, earning strange looks from the people they passed. They had a free period before charms, and then lunch. Draco wasn’t sure he was up to dealing with a disgustingly cheerful Harry for the next hour.
Having to drop the Notice-Me-Not charms in order to defend themselves, both Severus and Lucius were being targeted like crazy. Their status as traitors had not earned them any fans, and they were having a hell of a time. Tonks, Bill and the Weasley twins were trying to help take on some of the Death Eaters intent on revenge, but they were overwhelmed.
The silence stretched on for what felt like forever, making Harry squirm slightly in his seat. He had no idea what he had done this time, but Dumbledore’s actions and tone spoke of ill boding circumstances. “Sir?” Harry asked quietly, wanting to get on with it then.
“I wish I’d stayed dead.”
“I fail to see the good in your impending death, and you have forbidden me from following my instincts. What am I to do, Albus?” Severus asked, knowing that his voice sounded desperate, but beyond caring.
to get myself heard. I’ve had it with her ridiculous rumour mongering already. I’m damn
“The Heir’s Duty is a special form of magic that is invoked when the head of a pure-blood family makes requests regarding the family name, wealth, and overall social and political standing of the Heir. If the Heir should refuse, deny, or ignore the duties, they will be disinherited and shunned. I won’t even be a Malfoy anymore.”
Harry’s brow wrinkled as he thought that question over. Draco had a point, there. Those missing years in which Tom Riddle had changed from an enigmatic young man, to the Dark Wizard Lord Voldemort were extremely important, but so shrouded in mystery that Harry had no idea where to start. He knew he needed to find out what had happened in those years in order to unlock the answers he was searching for. He had no idea how he was supposed to go about doing that, however.
All the while, Severus was trying but failing to get Draco to speak to him about where he’d been. He’d push, be denied, then back off for a little while, then come right back again and try it all over. He was getting nowhere, and because he didn’t wish to distress his godson anymore, he gave up near dinner time.
“Of course not, Ron. I love her to death, but not like that. Besides, I would never do that to you. I know how you feel about her,” Harry assured his friend, catching the fearful glint in Ron’s eyes no matter how hard the redhead tried to hide it.
“It’s Professor Dumbledore! I think he’s dying,” Harry choked out, his chest heaving after running all the way up to the Tower. He had no idea how he knew Snape and Remus would be up here. He came up here to think when he needed to be alone, so he followed his instincts, and sure enough, here they were. It was obvious he was interrupting an important conversation, but this was beyond talks of relationships.
Harry nodded in tired agreement as he turned towards the door and turned the rickety handle, pulling the heavy dungeon door open. He looked back at Snape, who was standing up once more and arranging the parchment on his desk in a distracted way. “Goodnight, Professor.”
“Nice work you two!”
The door made a soft click as Severus closed it carefully behind him, noticing that the fire had died out and the room had grown quite cold. He moved over to the fireplace and pointed his wand at the still slightly smouldering logs behind the grate. “
“I never wanted any of this – the fame, fortune, fans. I just want to be a normal teenager, but I guess that’s too much to ask. I guess you were never technically a ‘normal’ teenager, either. You’re life hasn’t exactly been drama-less, given who you were raised by. At least we can say we have that in common…” Harry continued to talk about everything and nothing with the comatose Slytherin, feeling immensely better just getting everything off of his chest.
Severus chuckled, though the information was actually more horrifying than funny. He was glad his son could joke about it, however, and wasn’t currently breaking down from the stress of such an added expectation. “You know I must let Remus know. I cannot rightfully keep him in the dark concerning his son’s welfare.”
S~S~S~S
Being so very close to the Potions classroom, Harry took a moment to hesitate before knocking on the classroom door and waiting for a response. A girl that could be no older than twelve opened the door and looked up at him with wide, adoring eyes.
Harry smiled appreciatively at his two friends’ concerned looks. He really did miss having his friends to vent to when he needed it most. “I’m alright, thanks. I mean, I was never that close with the Dursley’s because of the way they treated me and thought of magic. I guess it’s a bit disconcerting to know I have absolutely no family left in the world whatsoever, but I’ll be alright. I miss you guys, and Ginny and everyone. Can you tell them all I said hello and I’m sorry for not being able to make it for a visit?”
“Dumbledore is finally giving Severus the Defence position?” Draco asked, gobsmacked by the very idea. His godfather had long been bitter about his constantly refused application to fill the ever elusive Defence Against the Dark Arts post due to his past dabbling in the Dark Arts themselves. Draco was curious as to what had changed the old man’s mind.
Harry hung back intentionally, expecting to be cursed eight ways from Sunday if he got within twenty feet of Snape. He leaned heavily against the wall behind him and slid all the way down until he was crouched on the floor, his forehead resting on his knees.
Harry sprinkled a little bit of parmesan cheese over his alfredo before taking a large bite. It was fairly decent cooking, if he did say so himself. “I don’t know if I would ever want to learn Legilimency, though. I think thoughts should remain private; I’d hate to break into somebody else’s thoughts and memories. It’s such a serious breach of privacy, and I don’t want to put somebody through that,” Harry said as he carefully spread some butter across a warm roll.
Draco was flipping through a folder that detailed the sale of the closed down orphanage to a man named Sir Alexander Murdock. Reading the details of the transfer of the deed, Draco discovered that the man had decided to turn the rundown orphanage into a hotel.
Harry sat up and looked his father straight in the eye, his throat tightening as he saw the naked fear in the man’s eyes. “I’m scared too, Dad. It’s ok to be frightened. Just have faith in Remus, even if you can’t trust Dumbledore’s instincts right now. Trust that Remus knows what he’s doing and that he’ll do everything he can to come back to us,” Harry said firmly, knowing that the werewolf was nothing if not extremely strong-willed and loyal to those he loved. He’d be back, come Hell or high water.
Harry frowned, wondering what else Dumbledore had left him. No one had seen fit to tell Harry that Dumbledore had left him anything, let alone the fact that the bloody Ministry had taken possession of all of it. Just as Harry was about to start ranting about not being told anything, The Potions and Defence Professors joined Harry and Hermione at the table, Ron and Draco trailing along from the other side of the library.
“Fine, you may go on your own, but I will be checking in on you in about an hour, and I don’t want to hear any back talk, understand me? I understand this is all a bit much for you to handle right now, but the last thing you should be doing is pushing the people who care about you away. We’ll give you your space, but you need to realize that we are only trying to help, so stop with the attitude. And no, I don’t have any classes to teach because it’s Saturday, smart-aleck.”
Severus looked up at Harry, who looked like he was ready for an explosion of epic proportions. A glance at Remus revealed a hopeful expression. He looked back down at the watch in his hands, the gold chain curled neatly underneath it. It looked just as he remembered it when his mother had given it to him, telling him to keep it safe for her while he was away at school. The reason it had stopped working was because his father had smashed it under his heel in a fit of rage. It had never worked the entire time Severus had had it. That was the summer before his mother had passed away. He felt the moisture on his cheeks before he even realized that they were tears. He had no idea what to say.
“Harry, would you mind grabbing a potion out of my lab for me? The one in the purple bottle next to the bi-corn horn bin,” Severus asked suddenly, catching both Harry and Remus off guard.
Remus cast a strong shield charm at Ron and Hermione, encasing them in a bubble of glowing protection. He grabbed blindly for a few seconds before pushing the invisible teens towards the closest shop, indicating they should hide out.
Harry felt like a hippogriff had been lifted from his shoulders. He had not realized how utterly terrified he was of losing what he had with Draco until Hermione reassured him. “Thanks, Hermione. I was really worried that he’d start hating me again.”
“When someone has been affected by a Memory curse, they must relive their worst memory in their sleep, despite Dreamless Sleep. Because it is not technically a ‘dream’, the curse can replay the memory without interference from the potion.” Remus explained all of this while looking for his wand, which happened to be under Snape’s bed for some reason.
Harry shook his head fervently, wanting to grab Snape by the front of his robes and shake the stupid out of him. How could the man be so foolish as to walk right into the flames of Hell? “This is suicide! He knows you were there in my mind, he could tell! There’s no way your cover hasn’t been blown; he’ll torture and kill you! Please don’t go, Severus…” Harry pleaded, shocked by his own use of the man’s first name. He’d never even spoken the word out loud as far as he could remember.
Severus blinked a few times as he savoured the comforting feeling of somebody willingly touching him, even it was just his shoulder. “Sorry. I’m just...I’m trying not to imagine all of the horrible things Draco must have been through. Like Dumbledore, I want to know what’s happened, but I know if I try to force it out of him it’ll just make it worse. I didn’t realize how much this would affect me.”
“I told you to go back to bed, now
Remus shook his head, frowning lightly. “Dumbledore told him he needed him here in England for the Order, so he decided to move back to London, at least until the war is over. He said he misses his work and all the Dragons immensely, but he has an obligation to the Order. It sickens me the way everyone is expected to just give up their lives for Dumbledore’s precious Order. I’m very much in favour of doing what we can to win this war, but we shouldn’t have to give up our lives in order to do it. I include you in that, too, Harry. I’m sure the world wouldn’t end if Ron and Hermione came for a visit here, but Dumbledore of course forbids it. I moved here to help Severus heal properly and take care of and protect you, yet Dumbledore was still against it. He’s got a hidden agenda, and I’m tired of fighting blindly for him and getting nothing but pain in return.”
machinations, and then probably hex him before going back to Harry.”
add,” Severus snapped. He walked forward and lifted Harry’s chin so he could better see the bruising on the boy’s neck. “I’m also taking fifty points from Gryffindor for your irresponsible lack of ability to return to your bed. I have turned a blind eye to your sneaking out of your bed out of respect for your feelings concerning Draco’s situation, but no more! The reason you were moved into my quarters was so that I can protect you, but it’s a little hard to watch over you if you’re
“I’m afraid the manner in which Albus’ body was left is not one you would want to encounter, Severus. Kingsley was obviously upset himself, and I could only hear it in his voice from his Patronus. I elected to have him picked up by St. Mungo’s until we figure out what we’re to do.”
“Nah, Dobby wouldn’t do anything like that, especially since he knows how important you are to me,” replied Harry, who was sticking candles into the cake and using his wand to light them. Remus began to help with the candles, placing them strategically amongst the letters and details in the icing.
Severus sat down next to the trembling boy, his hand still on his shoulder. “I’m sure you do, Harry, but leaving yourself in that dangerous situation was not something Black would have wanted you to do. He would have wanted you to seek help, not allow yourself to be mistreated like that,” Severus said softly, trying to comfort the boy, but not exactly sure he was succeeding.
Before Remus could answer, memories came flooding in. The battle. Spell lights flashing everywhere, the sound of people grunting in pain and sobbing with grief. Voldemort yelling at his loyal Death Eaters to
Remus rolled over as he heard the whispered spell and watched as the logs in the fireplace blazed warmly into life. He sat up slowly and propped himself against his pillows, running a hand through his messy golden locks. Severus was frowning at him, twirling his wand around as if deep in thought. “Thank you, Severus. It was starting to get a bit chilly in here.”
, do you understand?” Draco whispered furiously as he shoved Harry forcefully into a chair and sat down in the one beside him, clenching his fists to keep his temper in check.
“But...but the cloak. That’s Sirius’ cloak,” Harry said barely above a whisper, looking over at Remus as he said it. He was sure it had been Remus who had included that in the outfit, as Severus probably didn’t even know it had belonged to the Animagus.
Harry flinched with each word as Draco hugged him closer. Lucius had also taken his leave earlier, giving his condolences and making a quick exit. Remus saw the pale, drawn look on Harry’s face and sighed.
it,” Harry groaned, his head falling desolately into his hands. Draco rubbed his back comfortingly and shrugged helplessly when Hermione gave him a pointed look.
“You can’t promise me that. We can’t even figure out how to destroy the Horcruxes in inanimate objects, how the hell are we supposed to destroy the one in me without destroying me too?”
before, and Harry wondered if he had regained more memories, bringing him closer to his real age, with the real hormones of a sixteen-year-old Wizard. “They don’t teach that here, Draco.”
“Hogwarts infirmary!”
“Where were Michael and Lavender? Why were they there?” Ginny asked, wiping her own tears away. She had dated Michael for a brief time, and though she’s had always found Lavender quite annoying, it was a shock to hear that two of your classmates had been killed.
“Did you just call Ron ‘the Weasel’?” Hermione asked with a strangely happy expression. Harry and Draco both gave her incredulous looks before Harry caught on and smiled at his boyfriend. Draco was even more confused now.
“What do you mean, Wormtail? What about Potter?” Lucius asked, since Severus and Remus were both going through similar internal battles as their son at Peter’s words.
“I love you too. We’ll get through this, all of us. Just give it time.”
Harry scrambled away from Snape as fast as he could, only then recognizing that he was laying in a bed, the light that had awoken him coming from a warm, blazing fire in the grate across the room. “Where’s Remus? M-my stick thing, it was supposed to contact Remus,” Harry said in a scratchy voice. He was eyeing Snape’s black wand wearily as the man glared slightly at him. Why on earth had Snape come for him and not Remus?
Remus made a face and shuddered at the very idea. “Perish the thought, Harry. I would not want to know how Lucius could have acquired any one of those things from Voldemort.”
“I don’t think I can forgive you for this, Harry, whatever the reason. Besides, I need to focus on school and getting all of my memories back and you’re...you’re just a distraction,” Draco said plainly, keeping as much emotion out of his voice as he could, though he was clearly upset.
have done such a thing had I known it was a Horcrux,” Lucius explained quietly, allowing his mask to slip so that the young man would see his genuine remorse over the situation.
“You can call me Harry. I just have one rule, alright?” Harry waited until Pansy gave a sign that she was ready to hear his rule before going on. “You’re not to insult my friends –
Remus had eyes only for Harry, however, as he moved forward the last few feet and gathered him into a tight hug, closing his eyes as Harry hugged him back.
need to be destroyed in order to kill Voldemort; there’s no other way,” said Hermione, her notes spread out on the coffee table in front of her. There was a detailed diagram and Harry leaned over to look at it curiously.
Lucius did not wish Severus and Harry luck, he simply bowed his head and then disapparated to the previously arranged meeting spot he and Draco had agreed upon.
Remus left before Harry, giving Tonks her chance to get a word in. “You haven’t been abandoned, Harry; never believe that. I’ll write to you, ok? You can come to me for anything – I’ll always be willing to help with whatever you need.”
Severus tried very hard not to roll his temporary honey brown eyes at his husband, resisting the urge to also flip his hair out of his face, considering it had been charmed to a severely short length. Surely no one would recognize either one of them.
Severus just stared, letting reality soak in as his trembling subsided, but not fully. He blinked as he looked over at the werewolf, who had stood up and was moving towards him. “I’m sorry...I didn’t mean to wake you,” he whispered into the darkness.
be done, it may be far too late now. Did you ever consider that?” Severus snapped, using his experienced fingers to test the elasticity and firmness of the decaying flesh. It was like burnt parchment wrapped around frail bone.
“You cannot do everything yourself, Harry! You have a very specific job, and you
what Harry had expected. The pocket watch obviously meant much more to the Potions Master than even Harry had suspected. “You’re welcome, Sev. I knew it meant a lot to you, and I had it fixed up completely the muggle way. No magic was used on it.”
“Ready to go, Harry? I think it best we get your things while Severus is still at St. Mungo’s so he has a bit more time to cool off,” Remus said, trying to make the situation seem less serious than it really was. He felt so torn, afraid to abandon Harry, and not willing to risk Snape’s wrath if he sided with the boy instead.
The clock that showed every member of the Weasley family and their whereabouts had been altered, as Molly couldn’t stand to see Arthur’s hand listed as ‘deceased’ any longer. Instead, Arthur’s hand on the clock now read ‘on the next Great Adventure’, and there was an additional hand: a picture of Harry and his name in gleaming letters, his hand pointing at ‘home and well’.
Severus sneered as he pulled away from Remus and continued to pace. “Of course not. Dumbledore doesn’t give a damn if Draco lives or dies, as long as precious Potter is unharmed,” he snapped, sending a glare in Harry’s direction, though the boy still had his face buried in his knees.
S~S~S~S
“Wait, wait! We’re forgetting something here; I can’t use my wand against Voldemort, unless we want a repeat of the Priori Incantatem fiasco that happened in the graveyard. I don’t think I could handle that again. I can’t even begin to describe the power it took to force the spell back into Voldemort’s wand. I still don’t know how I did it, to be honest.”
Harry sighed and nodded, stepping closer to the Potions Master and hugging him tightly for a few seconds before pulling away. “I forgive you. It’s a good thing Mrs. Luther was so open minded. We got lucky when they sent her to us.”
Lucius chuckled quietly, brushing the hair from Draco’s forehead in an oddly tender gesture. “And yet, you want another. I always thought one was quite enough.”
“You know about the D.A., right?” Harry asked, almost afraid of the answer. He knew his dad knew about their illegal club, and he was afraid he was going to get in trouble for it all over again.
Harry felt slightly bemused by that comment, but nodded amiably as he pulled the covers closer to him. He had not realized that he was fighting the potion until he allowed his eyes to slam shut. It took Harry a little while to realize that that last comment from Snape must have been the man’s idea of humor. He let out a soft chuckle at the pathetic attempt just before his mind shut off completely and he was thrown into a deep, dreamless slumber.
He smiled at the Gryffindor Head of House and blushed slightly as the other Prefects caught on to the hidden meaning by checking their own lists. Hermione giggled while Ron groaned.
“Have you managed to do what I asked of you, Yaxley? You know we cannot set this plan in motion without him under our command,” the snake-like man rasped, his voice not far off from the hissing that had come from his lips moments before.
Remus let go of Severus’ shoulder and took a step closer to the cowering man. His emotions were going wild, but the most prominent was betrayal. “I lost all three of my best friends because of you. You sold out James and Lily, and you sent Sirius to Azkaban. He was never the same –
“What did you wish for?” Draco asked as he began removing candles from the cake, licking the icing from the ends as he sat them aside.
Harry looked up at the elder Malfoy, surprised that the man was still in the room. It was a good thing he already knew of the Horcruxes, or they would have just given themselves away. “What do you mean? Did Voldemort ever mention them to you?”
Harry smirked as a thought occurred to him. He waited until Draco looked into his eyes, then concentrated hard on the spell, imagining that he was focusing the magic through his eyes instead of his wand. A flash of a scene where Lucius Malfoy was beaming and clapping him on the shoulder assaulted his mind, accompanied by mixed feelings of elation and annoyance before he was forcefully pushed out.
“I reckon either the Wizengamot will appoint someone, or there will be an election. I just hope whoever it is has more sense than Fudge,” said Harry, stabbing a sausage link rather viciously as he remembered all the things Fudge had refused to believe.
Severus frowned as he patted Draco awkwardly on the shoulder. He didn’t know what exactly the memory was, but he knew it couldn’t possibly be pleasant. “Not right away, no, but in order for me to try to dispel the curse, I’ll have to view it eventually. Is that alright?”
“One thing you must understand about Dumbledore is that he’s a strategy type of player. All of this – the war, Voldemort, you and the Prophecy – it’s all a part of a big elaborate game, and Dumbledore is like the Master Player. Everybody on the Light side are essentially pawns in Dumbledore’s game plan, including you, though you’re more like the Knight than a pawn like everyone else, and I guess you could call me the Rook.” Severus noticed Harry’s increasingly bemused expression and decided chess references were obviously lost on the boy.
Harry and Remus apparated from the square outside of Number twelve Grimmauld Place to the alley outside of the Leaky Cauldron, already disguised by polyjuice. Remus went into the pub first, followed a minute or two after by Harry. They both returned the friendly wave from Tom, the barkeep, and went to the back door to the entrance of Diagon Alley.
There were many Order members in attendance who were content to sit back and let the rest suss things out, it seemed, but that was why they were doing this, to gain order and organization.
Severus gently clasped his shoulder and pulled the hood of the cloak back just enough to see his son’s face. “No matter what happens tonight, know that I am so incredibly proud of you, and I love you more than I could ever explain,” Severus whispered before placing a light kiss on Harry’s forehead.
like he’s you’re new best friend, and you’re calling that greasy bat ‘Dad’! It’s
“I don’t believe I ever apologized for cutting off your Occlumency lessons. It was very foolish of me and…and it could have meant Black’s life if I had taught you correctly in the first place.”
“You’re welcome, Harry. We all need an escape sometimes. Just remember what I told you, and don’t get discouraged if things remain a little tense for a little while. I’m sure everything will smooth over. They both love you; they can’t stay mad forever.”
“I know most people will take the Headmaster’s word with a grain of salt these days, no offense Albus, but why exactly should we believe anything you say? I certainly haven’t forgotten who you are, and what you’ve done. In fact, I think I know more than anyone else here about who you
The desk in the corner of his and Draco’s room was neat and tidy. A stack of thick, fresh cream parchment sat ready in the centre of the desk, the matching cream envelopes waiting to be joined with their letters, once completed. There was a handsome eagle feather quill sitting beside the stack of parchment, the nib sharp and promising a clean stroke. An unopened ink well with charcoal, pearl dust ink sat ready to be used. Everything was set up and ready for Harry to write the letters he had told himself he was going to write.
“Alright, is everyone ready? The way the spells are performed is very similar to that of an Unbreakable Vow, which Severus at least is very familiar with,” Dumbledore chuckled, ignoring the half-hearted glare that the Potions Master fixed him with.
“I’m so sorry, Ron.”
Hermione had fresh tears rolling down her cheeks, sighing in relief when Ron sat on the floor in front of her and took her hands. “I knew there was little chance of finding something, but I wasn’t willing to give up. I don’t understand, Harry. How are you here –
“There will be a temporary mess hall set up, as well as restroom and hygienic facilities. The house elves must also be evacuated from the castle, so they will have their own area as well. A reminder; no living creature can be within the castle during this process. That said, all students must take their pets with them and watch after them appropriately. The wards around the pitch will keep them from escaping into the forest or anything else from creeping onto the pitch and feasting on said pets. Post owls will be sent to the Hogsmeade post office for the time being, and a collection will be made to send letters out every few days.”
A low growl emitted from Remus throat as he went to raise his wand, but someone caught his arm before he could fire a hex.
S~S~S~S
As Draco stood panting out the bodies of Mulciber and Avery, he didn’t hear another Death Eater coming up behind him until it was almost too late. Draco felt white hot pain in his abdomen, clutching his ribs out of pure instinct. His shaking hands came away bloody, and he fell to his knees. His ears were ringing, and then suddenly the Death Eater standing over him fell to the ground, and Remus was there. He lifted Draco with ease and apparated to the edge of the graveyard.
it was from a trustworthy source.
Remus could feel Harry trembling even more against him. He peeled Hermione away from Harry as he put his arm around the boy’s shoulder to help keep him steady. “We need to get going, before a repeat occurrence takes place. You both should go straight home as well; order your school supplies by owl order instead if you don’t have them all already.”
The other Weasley children didn’t move. Harry looked around and saw six identical glares pointed directly at Percy, the rage practically radiating from the siblings. Ron had let go of Hermione, and Ginny had pushed herself away from Harry. Had it not been extremely serious and saddening, they way they all pulled their wands at the same time would have been quite humorous. It was so obvious that the Weasleys were very close-knit, which just made the fact that one of them had passed that much more horribly sad.
Severus squirmed in his sleep, his eyes flickering wildly from side to side as what he could only deem as a nightmare took over his dreaming mind.
fancying Tonks, then?” Hermione asked in a bewildered whisper.
“While we won’t directly ask the state of your virtue, we’ll just assume that it is not altogether intact, being healthy nearly seventeen-year-old boys. The main thing we want to stress is waiting to go all the way. You’re both very young and have all the time in the world to experience such things together, but the responsibilities and emotions associated with taking that big step in your relationship are immense. You’ve both been through a hell of a lot in your lives, granted, but it’s important to wait until you’re ready to handle such a monumental thing, and also be able to recognize
“It was a very dark time in my life, Remus. Besides, I was simply curious about spell creation. I never intended for that spell to ever be used by anyone else. I’m still not sure how it got spread as it did. I must have slipped up and mentioned it to someone at some point, but I cannot remember.”
When they reached the gargoyles flanking the Headmaster’s office, Dumbledore stepped forward and waved his hand instead of using a password as usual. Harry felt even more confused as he followed the elderly Wizard onto the ever-spiralling staircase that took them to the door of the office.
The Healer nodded and smiled gently at Severus before heading back towards the Matron’s office to floo back to St. Mungo’s. Madam Pomfrey walked over with Draco’s robes and wand, shooing everyone away so the Slytherin could dress in peace. When the curtains were opened once more, Draco found that Harry, Severus, and Remus had all waited for him.
“Is everything alright? I thought your next appointment wasn’t until next Monday,” Severus asked, trying to keep the slight edge of panic out of his voice. After having his episode earlier and reaffirming his decision to have this baby, he couldn’t bear it if there was something wrong with the child or the mother.
“I...I never even realized I was doing that. I’m sorry that I’ve been so inconsiderate. He
“There was nothing you could do, Lucius. There was no attack...it was suicide. I gave Draco a sleeping potion; he was so hysterical and Severus and I panicked. I'm sorry to just dump him on you in such a state, but you understand we have our own grief to contend with...”
Severus turned back to Harry, who was watching him curiously. The boy was probably shocked by his manners with the elf, but that didn’t bother Severus. There was much about himself that Harry did not know, and would probably learn if they had to spend very long together. As transparent as he made himself seem as a Hogwarts Professor, Severus Snape was a very complicated man.
“He was hit with Sectumsempra! It’s a spell of his own creation; I don’t know the counter-curse.”
“Can you confirm that you are in fact Albus Dumbledore?” asked Minerva, who had conjured a straight-backed chair and sat facing the Headmaster.
for the next meeting!” Ron said excitedly, nearly knocking over the pitcher of pumpkin juice in his enthusiasm.
“The carpet, it looks fairly modern, and the floors are wood downstairs. If they just carpeted over the wood – ”
The boy who walked through the door looked much the same as he had when Harry first saw him four years previous, though there were dark smudges under his eyes, and he looked a bit thinner. Tom Riddle was a suave and elegant young man, who had the same air of power about him that Harry had felt the first time he had come across Lucius Malfoy. Harry was also glad to note that there was almost no comparison for likeness between himself and the older version of Tom.
“Yes, but there was more than that, and you
“See ya, Sev.”
Harry felt extremely stupid as he listened to Snape. Of course, Remus couldn’t possibly be able to help him during the full moon. What had he expected? Well, he’d like to think that Remus would hand over Harry’s safety to someone other than Snape, but he was not complaining since the man had saved his life. “So…What happened? The last thing I can remember is some sort of explosion is my guess. What’s the Order’s guess for why they attacked, and where are the Dursleys?”
“Ready?” Severus asked as he grasped his husband’s hand in his own, his wand hovering over the surface of the swirling memory. Remus’ wand was raised similarly and he squeezed Severus’ hand in reassurance.
“Ron, would you just spit it out already! I’m jumping out of my skin here!” Harry demanded, extremely confused as to what Ron was going on about. It apparently had nothing to do with him and Draco, which he was glad for.
strange to be this close to the Potions Master. He was still in shock with the entire situation.
never
Harry felt his heart sink at the tone of Draco’s voice. He sounded really confused, and the way he said Potter didn’t exactly sound kind, not to mention Draco hadn’t called him ‘Potter’ in some months.
“That’s part of what I’m afraid of. I can’t lose you, Dad. Or Moony, or Draco, or anyone else. I can’t, I don’t have the strength to deal with anymore death or tragedy. I want this to be over.”
The startled laughter from his father made Harry grin as he handed the letter back and gave the Potions Master’s a quick, tight hug.
“That was a really good lesson! He talked about stuff that even
“I believe there’s another Muggle saying, about cats and being in possession of one’s tongue?” Remus mocked, ducking as the Potions Master launched a throw pillow at his head.
Severus nodded and motioned for Harry to follow him into his bedroom, where the fireplace was roaring warmly in the grate. Severus then sat down on the rug in front of the fire and looked up at Harry. “Sit facing away from me,” he instructed the boy.
“While retrieving a Horcrux from Borgin and Burkes, there was another attack on Diagon Alley and a few Hogwarts students were killed. Dad was severely injured and was dying. He was put under a stasis spell while we looked for the counter-curse. Luckily Moony found it, but it was a near thing. Dad took me to see my parents’ graves because I had never been, and there was a Horcrux there. That was…unpleasant. We ran out of resources for finding the remaining Horcruxes, so Dad and Lucius decided to kidnap Pettigrew and use his Life Debt to me for saving him in third year to see if he had any inside information on the Horcruxes, as he spent the most time around Voldemort as his little assistant. That’s when I found out that I was a Horcrux myself; my scar was cursed.”
let me go!
“Harry!” Hermione shrieked, breaking away from Ron to run towards the chair. Remus caught her by the middle, however, and held her back.
Harry just shook his head, not wanting to move his still sore jaw anymore than he absolutely needed to. He just wanted to sleep naturally, and he was exhausted enough to do it on his own, but first, he wanted to see Draco.
Harry gasped, leaving his lips parted slightly. Should he kiss back, or let Draco decide if this was what he really wanted? He knew getting too involved with the Slytherin in his current state could prove to be a damning mistake once his full memory returned, but he had been powerless to stop the rampaging feelings that they both shared for each other. The decision was taken out of his hands as Draco grasped the back of his head and pulled him closer, eliciting a soft moan from his throat as the kiss deepened.
It was the strangest sensation Harry had ever felt. He had heard the message from Bill just like the rest of the group, but it had played out in his head, not out loud. He assumed it was that secret form of communication between Order members that Dumbledore had mentioned once before.
“Professor McGonagall! We were all just sitting in there talking when the walls started to close in on us. Harry, Draco and I managed to squeeze through the door before it closed off, but Ron couldn’t make it through. I had to do something before the walls crushed him to death!” Hermione said, her voice sounding quite hysterical as she realized how much damaged her spell had inflicted on the corridor.
birthday.
Severus felt his stomach do a flop as he watched Harry cry. He had the strangest urge to reach out and hug the boy, though that was completely ridiculous. Severus Snape didn’t hug anyone, especially not Harry Potter. “She was, Harry…She was.”
“Wait. Remus, are you alright? I can’t imagine how hard this is for you, but I understand. It would be like seeing Lily again for me. It’s ok to be upset; I won’t hold it against you. I know I could never replace Sirius in your heart, that he would always have a place there.”
“So, are you glad you finally caved?” Hermione asked from beside Harry, who was still standing next to the table full of snacks and alcohol.
Harry was looking between his father and step-father, feeling quite uncomfortable. He didn’t know who to agree with, or what to do. He feared that if his father did question Lucius, he wouldn’t be very nice about it. However, Harry wasn’t all that concerned about Lucius being treated fairly. But he knew it would hurt Draco, and so he was torn.
“Spying is not the only means of gaining information, Headmistress. There are those in his ranks who pretend to be loyal, but are in fact terrified, but reluctant to try to leave. If we offer those people protection from both the Dark Lord and the Ministry, they may be willing to spill what they know.”
Severus nodded curtly, finally willing to let his venomous attitude towards Harry go in favour of a truce. After all, if he had to be stuck with the righteous Gryffindor for the remainder of the war, they might as well be stuck together in peace rather than hate. "Thank you, Harry, for admitting to your mistake and apologizing for it. I must admit that I was a little too harsh with you, but you must understand that Draco is all I have left in this world, and vice versa; any parent would have overreacted accordingly. However, it was not only Draco I failed to protect. You were my responsibility as well, and if not for Draco's uncharacteristic self-sacrifice, you would be in Draco's place now. As unfortunate as it is that he is injured and may never recover, it would have been more devastating a blow if it were you in the coma.”
“You’re just saying that because your dads told you to. You can’t say you didn’t know about all this before the rest of us did,” Jenicka Jenkins said, a few of her friends nodding in agreement.
“Fine! You can sleep in Harry’s room, but so help me I’ll be checking in randomly to make sure you’re both
“Merlin Harry, what is with you today? You’re as a taught as a bowstring. Relax, love,” Draco insisted, running a hand affectionately through the Gryffindor’s hair.
“The Headmaster sent me to find you. He seemed to be under the impression that you wanted to ask me something, though he refused to clue me in as to what. Clearly you were either distracted, or had no intentions of asking me anything.”
“Professor Dumbledore told me about the warding and the requirements. I want you know that I would do anything to be able to do that for you, Harry. If it were possible at all, I would do it in less than a heartbeat. I’m so sorry,” Remus whispered into Harry’s hair as he leaned his cheek against the Gryffindor’s mop of messy hair.
The Ministry of Magic was crumbling at the foundation as well. Fudge was steadfastly ignoring much of the highly publicized murders and crimes, claiming that it was the fault of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. He’d fired the Head, Kingsley Shacklebolt, in an attempt to make it look like they were doing something within the Ministry itself, and had appointed the last person anyone would have thought as the man’s predecessor; Arthur Weasley. It was great news for the financially lacking Weasley family, but a very strange move on the Minister’s part, making many people wary of his sanity. People simply don’t go from Muggle Liaison piss-on, to Department Head of Magical Law Enforcement. Kingsley Shacklebolt had actually started a petition to impeach the Minister on principle of his lacking intelligence. It was gaining popularity, much to the dismay of poor, foolish old Fudge.
“Hmm...Well, the conditions of both of our Oaths are the same, right? So I was going to say ‘I solemnly swear to an Oath of Silence regarding what I may or may not see in your mind during our Occlumency lessons.’ Sound good?” Harry asked, coming up with that just now, even though he passed it off as being planned out previously.
right to speak my name! I’ll give you five seconds to get your sorry arse up and out of my sight before I start throwing hexes, Unforgivables included,” Pansy threatened, now pressing her wand into Harry’s neck with bruising force.
S~S~S~S
protect him by the Vow, even after you’ve gone?”
“Sir, these wards are different than the bonding spell, right? We’ll have to do that separately as well?” Harry asked, trying to repeat the strange words of the spell in his head over again just to make sure he didn’t forget it.
Harry jerked back as if Draco had physically slapped him. He could have sworn his heart had literally cracked in two in that instant as his chest ached horribly. “I’m just a
“I’m sorry…I wasn’t thinking clearly. I just – I didn’t want to think of Sirius at all. It’s bad enough that I see him every night in my dreams, falling through the veil, helplessly. I miss him…” Harry croaked as he tried to hide his tears from the Potions Professor.
“The Malfoys descend from the Laurettes. There’s actually a portrait of my great, great Grandmother wearing what we thought of as the ‘Peverell ring’ in Malfoy Manor. The ring was lost from my family long ago. I never suspected it was anything special…” Lucius Malfoy said, seeming a little punch-drunk after hearing a bit of family history he was not aware of. Most pure-bloods, like the Malfoys, prided themselves on knowing their pedigree very well. It was not often a pure-blood was schooled on their own history.
“We need to keep up our patrols! Even if Potter here is safe within this house, there are other places, other people who still need to be carefully watched. Constant vigilance!” Mad-Eye Moody growled from the other end of the table, opposite Professor McGonagall.
Having learned the password from Nearly Headless Nick, Harry entered the Gryffindor common room and made straight for Hermione, who was sitting at a back table, wrapping what looked like Christmas gifts. The brunette looked up as she heard the portrait hole open and she beamed at Harry from her sitting position.
“Of course I do,” Draco said, his tone scandalized, even as he pulled Harry closer to him. “I love you too, you prat.”
When they entered the hospital wing, the Matron, Healer, patient and Potions Professor all looked up and paused in whatever they were doing. There was a tense silence as Severus stood from his seat beside Draco’s bed before walking towards his lover.
“Speaking of talks, the one we knew we’d need to give the boys soon? It’s time. The fight started over Harry and Draco asking Ron to switch rooms with Draco so that they may share instead. Harry did confirm that they’ve yet to have sex, though,” Severus admitted, smirking at the look of relief that crossed his husband’s face.
“It gets kind of blurry after that, because one of the men made me drink something and my vision and hearing got really fuzzy, but...they...they stripped me and...and touched me...”
“Now then, I’m sure your fathers have undoubtedly let you in on Voldemort’s most recent plans, despite my urging them to keep it to themselves?” the Headmaster asked, his eyes twinkling as ever.
Harry sat down and sighed, rubbing his hands over his tired face. “I’m not exactly sure. After I…blacked out – ”
Severus sighed as he rubbed Harry’s back gently, hoping he could find the right words for the boy. “She didn’t necessarily have to do anything to anyone, Harry. Just being on the side of the Light made her a target. I’m sure the Order are searching for her. I’ll make sure of it, Harry.”
” Draco groused, giving the ghost a pointed look.
Harry gasped just before the dream ended, reaching for the orb again to play the dream once more, but Severus caught his wrist before he could touch it.
“Owl for you, Severus,” McGongall said from her seat at the spindly table in the centre of the small staff room. There were a few other professors sitting around the room, reading paperwork, drinking tea, or having quiet conversations with each other. Severus despised the staff room.
“Yes, I do love you, and I’m sorry for avoiding you for the last couple of days.”
Severus smiled warmly at the Defence Professor as he walked over and pulled him into a hug that shocked both Remus and Harry. Up until then, Severus had been adamant about not being too affectionate around Harry, but apparently the occasion warranted some affection.
Scanning his own House’s table carefully, Severus noticed that there were also a few students missing from there as well; Parkinson, Crabbe, and Goyle. A sense of foreboding rose in his throat, successfully curving his appetite. “There are a few worrisome Slytherins absent from breakfast as well...ones who have made an active attempt at harming Potter before.”
“Stop it, all of you! Put your wands away
“Oh! Pardon me; I was just wondering what all the fuss was about. I’ll just leave you to it!” She bustled from the room in a hurry, the door closing firmly behind her.
“Transmogrification often results in grotesque or amusing shape-shifting, is more often than not a useless practice as the results are never practical, and Transfiguration is more widely used as not just shape-shifting, but complete transformation from one thing to another, sometimes permanently.”
After warding and silencing the room, Remus reached slowly for the stone and picked it up. It was light, almost weightless in his palm, and the way the fire in the grate reflected off the onyx edges reminded Remus of cold, lonely night filled with despair after Lily and James had been killed and Sirius taken to Azkaban. Before the memories could take root, Remus thought as hard as he could about his deceased lover, his best friend and confidant as he turned the stone, one – two – three times in his palm, and closed his eyes.
,” Ron whispered, looking around to make sure no one who wasn’t supposed to hear was listening in. Their table was mostly secluded, as the study hall began to thin out as it grew later into the evening.
Harry turned the tap on in the shower until the water was almost unbearably hot. As the bathroom filled with steam, Harry undressed and set his clothes aside. When he turned back towards the shower, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror and paused. Wiping away the fog that had collected on the mirror already, Harry lifted his fringe and glared at the jagged, pink scar that had essentially sealed his fate. He felt the fear and anger grip his heart as he angrily pulled his glasses off and threw them in the basin of the sink, turning quickly away from the mirror and his dark expression to climb into the steaming hot shower.
Upon entering, both men spotted Harry sitting beside Dumbledore immediately, looking much less distressed and very clean from a recent shower. Remus sighed audibly in relief, while Severus’ relief was not quite as obvious. They walked over and slid onto the bench beside Harry, not commenting on his finally surfacing to spare him the embarrassment. Lunch passed quite amiably that day.
The Transfiguration book snapped closed as Hermione glared at the redhead. She shoved it back into her book bag under the table and took up her fork and knife once more. “I’m not freaking out about it, Ron; I’m just making sure I have the facts right. This is a really complicated chapter, you know.”
“You know what I mean, though. I want it to mean something. Every time it happens, you give a little piece of yourself away. I only want to give myself to you,” Harry said quietly, feeling extremely exposed. He wanted Draco to see all of him, though; he wouldn’t hold back in front of the person he loved.
S~S~S~S
Abigail. He regained control of himself and nodded curtly. “She’s an old friend from Hogwarts. I’m sure you remember her; she was the Slytherin female Prefect. You probably knew her from your duties.”
“As most of you are aware, Remus has indeed taught here before, but because of some…bad press, shall we say, he could not continue on with us. However, with the Wizengamot’s surprisingly fair new Legislation for Wizards who suffer from Lycanthropy, it is now illegal to refuse employment to Mr. Lupin based on his condition. A letter has been sent out to all the parents explaining this new law, and I am happy to say that only two students have been withdrawn from Hogwarts and switched to Durmstrang, and they were first years to start this year. So, let us discuss some upcoming events and a few tweaks in rules for House points, then we’ll have some lunch!”
“Well that was easy,” Remus whispered as they stepped into the lift, the door making a pleasant chiming noise as it began to ascend.
Severus shook his head, brushing off Remus’ reproachful glare. “No, they’re not bad qualities, but in the words of a wise werewolf and his mate ‘everyone is stupid at fifteen’. I guess it may have come out the wrong way, but I’m not saying that being like James is a bad thing; I only meant that Harry doesn’t have the arrogance and foolishness James suffered at Harry’s age. I’ve forgiven James, as part of my Life Debt to him and for Harry’s sake.”
Severus nodded, his lips sliding against his husband’s as he gripped his hips tight, holding on for dear life. “I promise,” Severus said before pressing his lips fully to Remus’, earning an appreciative groan as he let his tongue explore the other man’s mouth briefly, but thoroughly.
“One strange pair for every year that I’ve taught here,” Severus replied as he set his empty plate beside Remus’ on the coffee table.
Harry looked over Neville’s schedule and saw that they shared all of the same classes, but Neville was also taking Muggle-Studies. “Professor Snape had to lower his expectations for the class because there weren’t very many students who did receive O’s, and there were quite a few with E’s that needed the course. I got in his class that way too. He’s not too happy about it, but he did agree to lower the class standards, so I think us E students will be ok. We’ll stick together, since Ron is being a prat and will probably partner with Hermione instead.”
“Do not be such an infernal brat, Potter! I am only trying to insure your safety by being extra cautious. I expect you to start doing so for yourself from now on, meaning you need to practice curse revealing spells on your own as well as in class. Do I make myself clear?”
“I may not have ever been fond of Black, but I
“Everything I own is in there! Make it stop!” Tom yelled, wanting to run to the wardrobe and save his things, but fearing the heat of the tall flames.
“See you at school, mate,” Harry said with a chuckle as he saw the bemused, elated and shocked expression on Ron’s face.
“We didn’t know, Severus. He never gave us any indication. We can’t blame ourselves. Maybe....maybe he left a note somewhere. Did you see one?” Remus asked in a hushed voice, allowing the other man to hold onto him with bruising force.
Remus clenched his eyes closed as his breath caught painfully in his chest. Severus was right,
The Deputy Headmaster hid his frown, and patted Tom gently on the shoulder. “It is a rare gift in the Magical world, but certainly not unheard of. It is allowed outside of school. However, it would be best if you refrained from doing so around the Muggles, or non-magical folk. It is not normal in the Muggle world, and that’s why the children make fun of you for it. I shall see you September the first, Tom. Goodbye.”
wards, including myself. They essentially locked me out using my own defences. Anyways, once I finally got through the wards, everything was gone, and the cottage was nearly burnt to the ground. The Dark Mark was hovering over the wreckage.”
“That we did. Now if you’ll excuse me for a little while, I think I need to go apologize to Remus for being such a prat. I’m sure you’re just dying to tell Draco everything, so go ahead,” Severus said with a small smile as he opened the door, intending on heading up to the Defence corridor.
“Where are you going to keep it?” Harry asked, feeling a bit wary now that it was actually gone from his mind.
“I’m ok, Harry, I just had a bad dream I wanted to discuss it with Severus. You can go back to sleep, it’s alright.”
Harry smiled gently at the old man as he took his usual seat before the Headmaster’s desk. He glanced at the bowel of lemon drops and took one, just to see the man’s eyes twinkle as he smiled. “I’m doing pretty well myself, Professor.”
Shocked speechless, that was the only way Severus could describe how he felt in that moment. He knew that the relationship between Harry and himself had changed quite drastically in just a few short months, and that in asking Severus to adopt him, Harry was admitting that he felt some sort of affection for the Potions Professor. However, Severus had never expected nor imagined that Harry would truly think of him as an actual father, especially considering the bad blood between Severus and James. It took Severus quite some time to decide what he wanted to say, and a little bit longer to figure out how to go about saying it.
be faking this ignorance. He kept his cool, however, and indulged Remus’ dumb-act. “Yes, I think we should perform a bonding ceremony. There are many different types, and many different ways, but I think that the best option would be The Joining of the Souls.”
Severus sighed as he brushed the messy locks of hair away from Harry’s scar. That one little piece of flesh, that little jagged scar, was the reason for so much pain in his son’s life. He’d heard about all the nightmares and the visions, though he had yet to play witness to one. He vowed then that he would do everything in his power to keep his son from suffering needlessly anymore.
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen him in any colour besides black, but he must have had to wear green and silver while at Hogwarts at least. He certainly didn’t play Quidditch, either,” said Draco, glad to move away from the subject of his morning sob session.
“People have searched the wreckage of the Potters’ cottage; nothing of significance was found, besides Harry of course,” Remus said with a gentle smile towards the brunette in question.
“As for feeling broken – well, I can try everything in my power to put you back together again, and I will learn how, eventually. I know I can never take the place of Sirius in your heart; you’ll always hold him there, no matter what. All I ask is that you make room for me, and stop assuming I’ll cast aside your feelings when it comes to this kind of thing. I
Really, Harry. Do you even remember that you’re a Wizard?” Draco asked as he rolled his eyes and entered their tent, scowling at how tiny it was. He immediately began measure how far he could extend the Wizard’s space without altering the outside appearance of the tent.
“Urgh, stop it! I’m trying to eat here!”
Harry cowered slightly and flinched as Snape raised his voice. He was shaking very slightly as he continued to avoid Snape’s gaze. “I didn’t want to be taken back to Grimmauld Place…I didn’t want to be in the place that Sirius hated so much…”
As some of you will undoubtedly notice in this chapter, I have used some of JKR’s ideas and warped them into something different. I did this for a reason, and I give full credit to JKR for anything you may recognize as her work/wording/ideas.
“You’ve been
Ron took a few gulping breaths as he leaned his elbows on his knees and stuffed his hands into his messy hair. “She wants to, but she’s afraid the Professor will tell your parents, and she’s too scared to let anyone know. I think she’s mainly afraid that people will think her stupid and irresponsible, but it’s not only her fault. I feel wretched, Harry. What are we going to do?”
, you have a damn baby on the way! You’re both acting more childish than when Draco and I fight. Now I’m going to go calmly speak with my boyfriend and resolve our own fight. I suggest the two of you do the same.”
“A rule, eh? And who made this rule?” Severus asked as he grudgingly accepted the piece of cake that was being shoved into his hands.
It was a morning like any other in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. The secretaries were dictating to their quills as the filing assistants delivered and picked up files from the various cubicles of the Auror Department. Paper plane memos flew overhead as the sound of quills against parchment, light conversation and quiet laughter was heard. Everything was going quite smoothly, and nothing was out of the ordinary.
“Get your feet off of my table, Malfoy, or I shall see fit to permanently remove said feet,” Severus snapped as he entered his quarters to find Harry and Draco doing homework in the sitting room, the Slytherin sprawled on the sofa in a most undignified way.
Harry moved around to the other side of Draco’s bed and frowned. “You have to Obliviate him?”
Remus was flipping idly through the pages, pausing every now and then at another scribbled note in the margins. He reached the back cover and was about to set it aside when he paused.
no breezes down there, and his room had never smelt like damp earth before. His eyes flashed open as his stomach plummeted; he was in the Forbidden Forest, and this time, it wasn’t a dream.
“And lastly, will you protect Harry with your life, no matter what the circumstances may come to be?” Dumbledore asked, his gaze very intense as he grasped Severus’ hand firmly.
“Severus, this is extremely dangerous! What if it doesn’t work, what if you become trapped in his mind as well?” he said, trying to keep the hysteria out of his voice, if only for Harry’s sake.
Harry sputtered and gaped, setting his tea cup aside before he really did drop it. How on
the acid green light of the Killing curse jet from a bone-like wand and strike beautiful Lily Potter in the chest so hard that she spun around and crashed into the side of Harry’s crib, scaring the sobbing toddler into hiccoughing gasps as he screamed, “
Each one of the Unspeakables opened a door at the same time, and Dedalus cursed as his hand was scolded by the handle, the door slamming in his face. Emmeline smirked and headed through the door she had opened, her wand still at the ready.
Harry had closed his eyes while listening to his father’s voice, slowly letting his Occlumency shields down. As he felt his father move around him, he opened his eyes and concentrated on the headstone. He could feel a shiver of fear and anxiety run down his spine at the sound of the cracking headstone, and he held his breath as he waited for the inevitable.
Severus sat there, fuming at the boy who was supposed to be his son’s best friend. After all the hell the redhead had put him through during the school year after learning of his close relationship with Severus and his budding friendship with Draco, Severus had no idea how Harry could make excuses and forgive him so easily.
it, Harry…” Remus moaned, clutching his head in his hands as he felt a surge of guilt. He should have made sure to reassure Harry more that they would find a way. What kind of father was he, to not know his son was on the brink of suicide?
you have fallen asleep in the infirmary when you do not come home.” He had not meant to say that last word in such a fond tone, but it had slipped out. When he saw the grateful smile on Harry’s face, however, he lost all desire to take it back.
Hermione slid into the seat beside Ron at the dinner table, looking around for Harry, but not spotting him. She hadn’t seen him all day and it was starting to worry her a bit. She pulled a plate of chicken towards her as she tried to convince herself that she was hungry.
clean up quite nicely,” Arthur said with a warm smile as he gave Harry a tight hug as well.
WARNING: This chapter includes a scene that may be slightly triggering for some readers, though it is not graphic in any way. Please proceed with caution!
“I’ll never be able to forgive myself for stunning Albus,” Remus muttered as the group trouped into the office behind Severus.
“Severus...”
that Harry had left him as his third choice? “With all due respect, sir, I was fairly certain you’d say no right away.”
how Snape felt. He watched as the Potions Professor pulled back the curtain of Draco’s little corner of the infirmary, and sat down beside the bed, looking all the role of a worried father. Oh, how his world seemed to have fractured in such a short amount of time.
A bright, mist-like light expelled forth from his wand, causing many people around Draco to pause and stare. After a few seconds, it was obvious he hadn’t been completely successful, as it did not form into a familiar, but dissipated. Draco frowned and shook his head.
Remus sighed heavily as he crossed off yet another piece of bad information on a seventh year’s midterm. Really, the of-age students should know better! His musing was interrupted quite welcomed when Severus returned from his meeting with the Headmaster, although Harry was no longer with him.
“I took the liberty of extracting Mr. Riddle’s disciplinary file for ya’. Sorry to say that the thickness of it doesn’t lie; the boy is a troubled soul,” Ms. Brooks said, her tone sad, but her expression wary.
Severus was momentarily stunned before he was pulled back to the present, a leaden sensation in the pit of his stomach threatening to make him sick up. The Dark Lord knew he was with Harry, could possibly know everything that had happened that summer. One thing became infinitely clear to Severus right away; his spy disguise was blown.
Remus furrowed his brow, not expecting Severus to try to explain himself. He was fully prepared to be dumped right then and there, but he never expected this. “Go on, then,” he said, turning back towards Severus slowly. He felt his chest constrict at the contrite expression on the man’s face.
“Why does it have to mean anything, Draco? I love you, and all it means is that I’d do anything in the world for you if it meant keeping you safe and happy, such as pulling you out of a hopeless coma and giving you your life back. But I’ll also give you this, Draco, just because you asked nicely. You can have all the time in the world, because while you’re figuring out what loving me
Harry on the Light side. He doesn’t have minions or followers; he has friends and people who care about him and want to end this stupid war. He has equals, and I’m one of them. I do not stand behind Harry, but firmly beside him.”
The Potions Professor sighed as he did one last scan of the curse-ridden arm, and then moved to take the seat in front of the large oak desk. He rubbed a hand over his tired face, fixing his mentor with a mild glare. “Despite my telling you that you had a year, maybe less, when the curse had spread to no more than your wrist? Albus, you’ll be lucky to get three, maybe four more months. If you had told me, there could have been
Hermione nodded as she covered her mouth to stifle her yawn. “Go on, get your goodnight kiss,” she said with a quiet giggle, dodging the pillow that Harry tossed her way.
A whole week passed in which Harry and Severus continued with Occlumency lessons and living peacefully together. A fight or five occurred over trivial things, but they were getting along alright for the most part.
“There are things in life much more important than Quidditch, Ginny! Draco has been in a coma for nearly two months, and all you care about is Quidditch! You may not give a damn about whether or not he ever wakes up, but I do. We’re fighting a war, Ginny. I can’t be a careless teenager like you; my destiny has been chosen for me and I must fulfil it, or else everyone will suffer. I carry the weight of the Wizarding world on my God damn shoulders; I don’t need the added pressure of you constantly on my back as well,” Harry snapped, gaining a few scandalized and curious stares from fellow students leaving the Great Hall. He’d had enough already today; he just couldn’t handle Ginny’s mollycoddling as well.
“Minerva is fine, Severus. We’ve known each other too long to mess about with trivial things like professionalism. I remember you’re sorting, for Merlin’s sake!” Minerva said with a good-natured chuckle at the younger man.
Harry turned his annoyed glare on his Potions Professor, who was standing in the doorway with his arms crossed over his chest. “Is there something you wanted, Professor?” he asked in a clipped tone.
“Overreacting? Aurora, you nearly fell in the shower because the baby kicked! You could have injured yourself and the baby. I think we have plenty of reason to worry. Is this not something typical of pregnancy?” Remus asked, looking as though he felt guilty for not knowing the typicality of pregnancy.
Severus nodded and pulled Remus out of the room with him, offering Harry a small smile and a wink before closing the door to give the boy some privacy. He turned to Remus in the hall and sighed, knowing the man would have to avoid him and his quarters for the rest of the day so as not to arouse suspicion.
Harry could have left or been taken. My concern is finding my son as soon as possible. Raise the alarm, or I will go to every staff member and do it myself,” Severus warned, crossing his arms over his chest, masking how bad his hands had begun to shake.
Harry couldn’t help the smile that traced his lips, or the sense of relief he felt at those words. He hadn’t realized he was so afraid of Snape pulling out of the deal before then. “So he did go get the application, then?” Harry asked, sounding more earnest than he had intended.
“Well, the most obvious ones I think are Harry’s parents. But would he have had time to make Horcruxes? The curse backfired on him when he tried to kill Harry, but did he make Horcruxes from James and Lily?” Draco asked, gently grasping Harry’s hand as the Gryffindor paled slightly.
Dumbledore sighed wearily, leaning back in his chair as he looked as old as every one of his one-hundred plus years. “I have suspected this information for about five years now; since you brought me Tom Riddle’s diary and described to me the memory of young Tom, stealing Ms. Weasley’s life force. I have done much research since then, and upon finding a Horcrux of my own, my suspicions were confirmed. I have been collecting memories and information for years on this matter, Harry, but I did not receive confirmation until this past year, when I was burdened with this curse,” Dumbledore said, shaking back his sleeve to expose the spreading curse scar up his arm.
“Yes he has all of his memories back, but he’s really confused about everything and he asked me to give him some space, so I left. Healer Smithson was running diagnostics on him when I left. Dad should still be there. Do you want to go see him?” Harry asked, hoping Remus would want to go alone so he wouldn’t have to see Draco again.
Gryffindor sixty points, and
“See you.” Hermione walked off towards the staff table, leaving Harry sitting alone with his breakfast.
Harry sat back down too, frowning at the stack of notes he still didn’t understand, and was frankly afraid to understand now. “I think you should apologize to him,” he said abruptly, bringing Snape’s glare back onto him.
Harry pulled back from the hug, though he stayed sheltered in Remus’ arms. “There’s no need to apologize, Remus. It’s not your fault that the Ministry are a bunch of morons. I’m glad you’d be so willing to do that for me, and I appreciate the sentiment, at least. But all’s not lost.” Harry turned towards Snape, who was looking both concerned and slightly bemused by the display and Harry’s words.
“Everything? Even from before the accident?” Severus asked, preparing to call for Healer Smithson. If Draco had indeed regained his memory, she would no longer be needed other than to do annual check-ups.
Harry was slightly shocked by that information. He never knew it could be an inborn power. How he wished he could have had Occlumency and Legilimency as in-built powers. “No, but how can I try if I don’t even understand the mechanics of it?” Harry asked as he sat the Legilimency book aside and turned more towards Snape.
What happened, is Draco alright?” Hermione didn’t waste any time in attacking Harry with questions when he entered the Gryffindor common room. A few people turned to stare in curiosity, making Harry immediately uncomfortable.
“You’ve never done anything more right in your entire life, Severus.”
“Uh, sure. Thanks, sir. So…am I in trouble?” Harry asked, having no idea what he could possibly have done to get in trouble, other than his foolish mistake in the Diagon Alley attack.
The last class of the day, Transfiguration, was nearly over. However, Harry couldn’t wait any longer, and raised his hand to ask to use the restroom. As he made his way down the Transfiguration corridor, he had the strange feeling that he was being watched. He paused, looking around to make sure there was no one following him. He shrugged and shook his head, willing his paranoia to go away.
Remus gripped Severus’ hand in his own, noticing how the man was rubbing his own wrist, as if the phantom bracelet was still there. “You had no way of knowing its true nature, Severus. There’s every reason to believe it’s still where you buried it; all hope is not lost.”
Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled mischievously as he twirled his wand. A package roughly the size of a sweater appeared on the coffee table. “A few things were saved because they were in your Hogwarts trunk, though not everything was saved.” Dumbledore indicated for Harry to open the package.
“Is everyone in agreement, then? Remus, you’ll still wait at Spinner’s End with Harry, I assume?” Severus asked icily, his words delivered with the intent to insult.
Neville accepted hugs from Ginny and Hermione and handshakes from Ron and Draco before turning back to Harry with his classic crooked smile. “Ginny’s been going on about it for a while now and invited me along. Gran even agreed to let me stay the night.”
Hermione sat on the edge of her best friend’s bed, glad to offer comfort when Harry leaned his head on her shoulder and let out a shuttering breath, full of heartache and exhaustion. Some people just had all the bad luck, and Harry was unfortunately one of them.
“Why don’t you like your birthday, Sev?” Draco asked hesitantly, wondering if he just hated any sort of celebration or if there was a specific reason.
“Harry, do you want to play chess or something? I’m bored! I can’t just sit there and read like you can; books drive me mad,” Tonks complained as she popped a Bertie Bott’s into her mouth and rested her feet on the coffee table in front of the couch.
“No, oh Merlin no,” Draco moaned, rocking back and forth. What was he supposed to do? He couldn’t just leave his father there!
Harry’s look of chagrined guilt made Ron’s face grow dangerously redder. “I didn’t have much of a choice, Ron. Dumbledore thinks it’s the safest place for me until Hogwarts starts up again. It’s not as horrible as you may think, actually. Snape has helped me loads this summer, not to mention saved my life –”
Severus glared pointedly at his godson. “Watch your tongue, child. I can still punish you like I did the summer before your fourth year if you’re not careful,” Severus hissed with a sneer of his own. Draco was just feeding him ways to intimidate him; he’d be nice and softened up by the time Severus actually told him what he wanted from him. Such was the way of manipulating people, especially easily frightened Slytherins.
“In fact, I don’t think Wizarding Family Services would have allowed Severus to adopt Mr. Potter had they known he was responsible for the poor child losing his parents to begin with,” Lucius continued on, obviously taking pleasure in Severus’ reactions.
“Why did you ever create such a curse, Severus?” Remus asked quietly. He looked down at the pale man, who was lying on his back, the covers pulled up to his bare chest. He slid the blanket down a little and very gently traced the angry scars that littered the man’s chest like lattice work, so very like his own cursed scars.
“I received an owl from the ministry; they’ve approved me to continue on with the adoption process. Next up is the interview, which isn’t going to be easy, but the worst is over as far as I’m concerned. I was more worried about the background check than anything else.”
Remus shook his head as he pushed the paper aside. “No, not technically. Severus will only get the position should the curse render me from teaching more than one term in a row. There’s still a possibility that I can teach continuously.”
“Divination is a shoddy subject at best, but there are a very few who actually possess the gift of Second Sight. It is an inborn skill, not a learned one,” Severus assured his son. He reached into his robes and pulled out a small vial of purple potion, handing it to Harry.
supposed to see that,” Draco whispered, his pale hand covering his worried gray eyes.
Severus shrugged as he stood up from the hospital bed as he heard Madam Pomfrey bustling around behind the curtain closing off Draco’s bed. “Yes, but I have other properties to replace it. Besides,

“Emotions are a sign of weakness, Potter. Letting the enemy know your state of emotion gives them an advantage over you. It lets them know exactly how to push your buttons and what affects you the most simply by reading your emotions. They can manipulate you without ever having to enter your mind at all. You’re handing the Dark Lord weapons by expressing anger, sadness, panic, distress, even a sense of affection for someone else. They can all be used against you, but I’m sure you’ve already learned as much,” Draco said snidely, trying to make the stubborn Gryffindor realize he was wrong in this. He was feeling a bit stung as well, as he often blocked his emotions as well. Maybe Potter thought him heartless as well.
“You know I love you, right?”
“Yes, I do believe more warding spells are in order. That is twice already that you have been taken away from protective hands by a hidden portkey, and it’s quite nonsense. You should have been secure here in the dungeons, and I feel like it is my fault that you were taken,” said Severus, his voice holding a weary tone that Harry had never heard in his father’s voice before.
Severus set aside his book and leaned forward in his armchair, which was facing the sofa that Harry occupied. He summoned the newspaper away from his son and folded it by his side, demanding the boy’s attention. “I’m not stupid, Harry.”
of his memories back, including his past relationship with the Slytherin girl.
“Severus, Remus; to what do I owe this late and rare pleasure?” the wizened old man asked, his blue eyes twinkling as ever.
. Neither did Hermione, a Muggle-born witch who’s at the top of our class. She’s brilliant, and her magical abilities far surpass many of the pure-blooded students at Hogwarts.
“I...I was having a dream, or nightmare, rather,” Harry whispered, trying to get his breathing under control. He realized he was shaking, and tried pulling his blanket closer to warm himself up.
“Thanks Sev!” Harry beamed as he gave Severus another hug before heading off to his room to put on something more comfortable to walk around Hogsmeade. He of course had to grab his money pouch as well.
Albus silently touched the tip of his wand to the handle of Remus’, a faint glow emitting from the wood for only a few seconds before it was gone. “Good, very good. Now then, on your knees, Severus,” Albus instructed as he slowly got down on his knees as well. Old age slightly hindered the excitement of kneeling to take the Vow, but only by a little. He held out his left hand and waited for Severus to copy.
Severus held his wand aloft, lighting the area in front of him as he searched for any sign of Harry or his family. He stopped short when he caught sight of a pale hand sticking out from under and large piece of fallen dry wall. He moved quickly around the debris and knelt down, trying to lift the wall up. The hand was that of a woman’s, and the wall was too heavy to lift using just his body strength. Severus clasped his fingers around her wrist, checking for a pulse. There wasn’t one.
“Where am I?”
The door to the drawing room banged open, causing both professors and Harry to jump in fright. Harry stood with a wide smile on his face as he saw Draco come running in, only to have that smile wiped right off of his face when Draco punched him square on the nose –
With a broken sob, Harry ran out of the room too, the black sheet descending slowly to the floor as Ron, Hermione, and Remus all stared blankly at the door.
Ah, so there was the book. He knew from the moment he saw it that, at some point, he would be reading it. No matter, it would be better for everyone if Harry learned to close his mind, and that was exactly what he was going to do. “Yes, sir.”
“Oh, Percy!”
Tonks shook her head as she picked up Harry’s glasses and handed them to him. “No news yet, Harry. Dumbledore is working on it, though, so don’t worry yourself, yeah? Why don’t you let me make you a spot of breakfast and we’ll talk some.”
No one could sleep that night. Ron and Hermione had joined Draco, Harry and Remus at the kitchen table around three in the morning, sharing in their silent vigil. Harry made sure Hermione was alright, as he had seen Ron and Draco drag her in. She had been hit with a Cruciatus and a stunning spell, but she was alright.
Draco sighed heavily as he ran his hands agitatedly through his silky blonde locks. “I know you think I’m disgusting now, but please don’t tell anyone, Harry…
“No, you may not. You missed all of your classes on the first day of the term! That’s a wonderful way to start out. What on earth did you say to Draco as well? He looked completely distraught for the entire day after Defence.”
Albus could ignore the facts no longer. The castle’s ancient wards were malfunctioning, and he needed to get to the bottom of it fast, before any more of the staff or students ended up with injuries. “It seems as though the ancient wards woven into the castle itself have begun to go amiss. I shall look into the process of fixing such a thing. For now, be on high alert and inform your Prefects to be on alert as well. I fear this may not be an easy problem to solve.”
forget it – and latched on, pulling himself into the memory. Though he didn’t want to see what happened at all, he could not allow for hesitancy, lest the attempt fail due to lack of will.
The trio all sat down at the Gryffindor table in their usual spots in the middle, Harry in the middle as Hermione continued to berate him with questions. “A coma? Oh no, that’s terrible! They’ve no idea how to wake him up?”
“Let me do the talking, Potter. Weasley, Harry here seems to have misplaced his wand, and there is some suspicion that you may have taken it. Do you have the wand?”
Abigail cocked her head slightly, trying to figure out who this man was. He obviously knew her, so she must have known him. That gentle smile, and those soft amber eyes...Of course, Remus Lupin, Gryffindor Prefect. “Remus? Sweet Merlin, it’s been a long time. I feel like I’m at a Hogwarts reunion these days, after running into Severus and plenty of others at Mungo’s. Are you teaching here as well?”
“Sorry Draco; what was that?”
back up and placed it back into his inside pocket.
my business, Potter. I’m supposed to help keep an eye on you and protect you, and I cannot do that properly if you keep suspicious letters hidden away from your friends and Professors.” Severus had noticed how Harry had quickly stashed the letter away when Granger seemed to gain interest in it, which only served to make the letter even more suspicious, at least to him.
“That’s not what I said at all, Severus. Do not put words in my mouth like that. You’ve never been convicted of anything, and Albus has vouched for you since you turned your back on Voldemort so many years ago. Do you not think he’ll vouch for you now when the caseworker undoubtedly asks about you? You don’t give yourself enough credit; you’re no more a Death Eater now than I am,” Remus said firmly, reaching out and cupping Severus’ cheeks in his hands, forcing the man to look him in the eyes so he would know he wasn’t being dishonest at all.
Draco stood up and walked over to Harry, wrapping his arms around his neck and pulling him down for a kiss. They both ignored the horrified sound from Ron’s general direction as they lingered in the kiss on purpose, just to annoy the other Gryffindor in the room. “Make sure you study for that potions exam, Harry; you’d never hear the end of it if you failed your father’s class.”
Harry had curled himself up on the sofa with his Defence book, watching his Professors from the corner of his eye as he pretended to be studying for an exam the next day. He frowned as he saw the look of shame and pain on Severus’ face; a rare look into his prospective father’s emotions, he was sure.
Remus tugged Harry towards the lift, which clattered and banged as it stopped and opened its wiry gate for them. They both stepped in and Remus closed the gate before pushing the round ‘four’ button to the right of the lift. They made their way steadily up until the lift jangled to a stop and the gate slid open noisily.
to do with Sirius Black.
Severus gave Harry and pointed look. He knew the Gryffindor wasn’t stupid; the boy had to know what he was getting at, but he would humour him. “After this is all over, after Voldemort is gone…I think we should obliviate some of the knowledge about the Horcruxes from those who know, including myself. You should be the only one left with all of the information in the end.”
Dumbledore gave him a knowing smile, as if he had been waiting for Harry to get to this point, and ask this question. “The box of trinkets Tom retrieved from his wardrobe was full of things that did not belong to him. He had stolen them from victims of his various bullying schemes. They were treated as prizes or talisman for his work. This trait stayed with Tom Riddle as he got older. He took trophies, items that would help remind him of the things he had done. This is important because – ”
“You’re taking Care of Magical Creatures again? I didn’t even think about continuing on in that; I dropped it.”
to have done it after she died, and I always blackout right as she dies when the Dementors are near. I don’t think I remember anything past that.”
want to see it either.” Harry gulped as he tried not to think about the horrible memory he was going to have to live through once more. Only thinking of finding another Horcrux kept him from a full on panic attack.
Severus pulled away from the hug and kneeled down in front of Harry, his hands held lightly to the Gryffindor’s shoulders. “I’m sorry you’re going through such a rough time right now, Harry, and in time I will forgive you. You must understand that I have considered Draco as a son since the boy was born, so yes, I am a bit biased. I am not saying I care about him more, I have just cared about him longer, and the boy truly has no one else in the world. Draco will forgive you too; he just needs to come to terms with the things he’s been through. We both know that none of it is your fault, but you could have made things a little bit easier by telling someone before he remembered on his own.”
Sirius nearly fell out of his chair as he quickly removed his legs from the table and leaned forward to grasp Harry’s shoulder. “Oh Merlin, Harry, are you ok? How on Earth is that even possible?”
Harry gave the blonde man a strange look, not sure if he was hearing things correctly. “You’d go back to Azkaban willingly?”
Everyone at the table, even Snape, was eyeing Harry with something akin to pity. He looked miserable, utterly exhausted, and very vulnerable. Severus rolled his eyes as he uncrossed his arms and leaned across the table towards Harry.
“Oh no, never. We believe in firm discipline through lecture, loss of privileges, and instil in our students the best we can the sense of shame that comes with breaking rules, and the honour that comes with following them.”
Harry huffed and glared at his boyfriend. He forgot how nasty Draco could get when he was in a foul mood. “I didn’t say it was simple, Draco. I just meant that there might be a different way, something we haven’t thought of. The Prophecy doesn’t say I have to kill Voldemort using magical means. What if I attacked him muggle style? He’d never expect us to attack with guns.”
“The point of the lessons is to make sure people
“I’m sorry, Draco…I should never have done what I did. I should have listened to you. I feel like such an idiot. But…I have a question for you. Why on earth did you pull me out of the way, sacrifice yourself, for
Harry grinned as he felt his chest tighten. He’d always been so fond of the Weasley family for taking him in and treating him as one of their own, but he always felt especially warm around Mrs. Weasley. It reminded Harry what he was missing, not having a mum of his own, and as much as it saddened him, he was grateful for the lucky substitution that was Molly Weasley.
Severus shrugged as he opened the double hinged door to the kitchen and waited for Draco to follow. “That is up to Harry to decide, so you’ll have to ask him about it. I’m sure he’d be willing to have the same discretion with you as you will have with him,” Severus assured his godson.
Now that the adoption was official, it had come time for the wards to be put in place. Early in the morning, much earlier than Harry appreciated, Severus woke him up and led him very sleepily to the Headmaster’s office. Severus knocked gently with the Phoenix-shaped door knocker, waiting for the gentle reply from the other side.
Harry glared at his bushy haired friend as he checked the storage cabinet for the fourth time. “Don’t you think I’ve already tried that, Hermione? That was the
Severus glared slightly at the old man before getting out of bed and pulling his dressing gown on over his night clothes. His swept a hand through his long hair before wordlessly leaving the bedroom and indicating for Dumbledore to follow him.
“Remus, Minerva; very carefully hover the piece of stone up on off of his leg so I can assess the kind of break and whether Skele-Gro is going to be needed,” Poppy instructed, grimacing at the odd angle Snape’s leg was turned at under the stone.
“You have to detect emotions to tell if someone is lying?” Harry asked, slightly confused by that. He thought the only thing you needed to do was try to bring forward the true memory to put the lie to shame.
“I will not be blamed if you end up passing out halfway there. Mr. Potter will escort you.”
“Harry...are you there, mate?”
The atmosphere suddenly became tense as Harry tried to distract himself with a catalogue dedicated to socks. He lost interest quickly.
Remus nodded slowly, feeling that tightly coiled sense of panic in his stomach loosen, if only just a little. He moved forward and cupped the Potion Master’s cheek, waiting to be pushed away. It never happened. “Thank you.”
Severus pointedly turned Harry towards him as the rest of the group nodded their consent to the game-plan. “You are not to be included in this. You’re not an Order member, and Merlin only knows who could be possessing or impersonating the Headmaster. I want you to go sit with Draco in the infirmary until I go and collect you from there. Do you understand? Do not go anywhere else or leave until I get there.”
Severus and Remus exchanged an identical look of horrified realization. “He must have a Memory curse on him,” Severus said as he extracted himself from his bed and pulled his dressing gown over the sleep shorts he was wearing.
I want to give a big shout out to Utena-Puchiko-nyu, who sent the 100th review for Never Alone (on FF.net)! Woo hoo! I’m so excited that this story is getting so much recognition and feedback! Please keep reading and reviewing, it keeps me going! On another note, I received a flame for making Remus gay and called an imbecile, my knowledge of the series questioned. Obviously this person doesn’t get the way AU fiction works, so I will laugh it off and encourage people to send reviews to help cheer me up!
